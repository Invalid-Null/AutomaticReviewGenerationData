Particle size effect of SiO2-supported ZnO catalysts in propane dehydrogenation†
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has shown great potential to meet the increasing global demand for propylene. However, industrial Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are either costly or toxic. The development of cost-efficient and environmentally friendly catalysts is highly desirable. Herein, we synthesized a series of SiO2-supported ZnO catalysts (ZnO/SiO2) from atomically dispersed species to particles of a few nanometers and to continuous films using atomic layer deposition. In the PDH reaction, we showed that the mass specific rates and propylene selectivity both exhibited a volcano relationship with the size of ZnO, where a ZnO/SiO2 catalyst with a size of approximately 4.8 nm had the maximum PDH activity and a propylene selectivity of 95%, along with good long-term stability for at least 10 h. Photoluminescence spectroscopy and temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 revealed that the amount of oxygen vacancies and acidity sites in ZnO had the same trend with the PDH activity as a function of ZnO size and reached the maximum on the 4.8 nm-sized ZnO/SiO2 catalyst. This result suggests that unsaturated Zn cations accompanied by oxygen vacancies are the active sites for the activation of C–H bonds in propane.
Introduction
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an atom-economic reaction process, has become an important alternative to traditional methods of propylene production, e.g., steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, to meet the ever-increasing demand for propylene.1–4 The commercial PDH process utilizes either Cr-2,5,6 or Pt-based2,4,7–10 catalysts, with market shares of approximately 30% and 60%, respectively. Cr-based catalysts are toxic and deactivate rapidly. Pt-based catalysts with scarce precious metals are costly and require the use of ecologically harmful chlorine for frequent catalyst regeneration. Therefore, the development of a cost-efficient and environmentally friendly PDH catalyst is highly desirable.
Tremendous efforts have been devoted to the design of a transitional metal oxide catalyst containing earth-abundant elements. To date, a series of metal oxide catalysts, including ZrO2,11,12 GaOx,13,14 VOx,15–19 ZnO,20–28 isolated FeOx,29,30 and CoOx,31 have been investigated. In metal oxide-catalysed PDH reactions, the coordinatively unsaturated acidic sites of metal oxides are considered catalytically active sites. For example, by adjusting the surface vanadium density to vary the fractions of V5+, V4+, and V3+ ions on an alumina support, Gong et al. demonstrated a close relationship between the PDH activity and the amount of V3+ ions, indicating that coordinatively unsaturated V3+ ions are the main active sites for PDH.19 Müller et al. also reported that the increased relative abundance of weak Lewis acid sites in β-Ga2O3 relative to α-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3 was responsible for the higher initial catalytic activity in PDH.32 Miller and co-workers performed in situ UV-resonance Raman and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) characterization of SiO2-supported single-site Zn(ii) catalysts. They revealed that under PDH reaction conditions, Zn(ii) ions on SiO2 cleaved one Zn–O bond and transformed into coordinatively unsaturated 3-coordinated Zn2+ Lewis acid sites.23 Therefore, the development of strategies to regulate the acidity and the coordinated environment of metal oxides is of great importance to design efficient metal oxide catalysts for PDH.
Similar to the prominent particle size effect in metal nanoparticles,33–35 variation in the size of metal oxide particles could also greatly alter both the electronic and geometric structures,36–38 thus greatly tuning their catalytic performance.39–43 For their applications in the PDH reaction, Kondratenko et al. fabricated a series of size-controllable monoclinic ZrO2 catalysts from 9.1 to 43.4 nm and found that propylene formation was increased by a factor of up to 70 as the ZrO2 particle size decreased from 43.4 to 9.1 nm. The higher activity of the 9.1 nm ZrO2 catalyst was attributed to the increase in the concentrations of oxygen vacancy-related acidic sites.12 Similar observations were found in tetragonal ZrO2.44 There are also a number of studies on the role of oxide dispersions of supported metal oxide catalysts in PDH by varying the oxide contents.19,25,27,45–48 Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, there has been hardly any detailed investigation yet on the particle size effect of metal oxide catalysts in PDH, especially in a broad size range, from single atoms to clusters, nanoparticles, and bulk crystals.
In this work, we synthesized a series of size-controllable ZnO catalysts on a SiO2 support in a broad size range from atomically dispersed Zn1O to ZnO particles and thin films using atomic layer deposition (ALD), a technique relying on alternative self-limiting molecular surface reactions.49–51 In the PDH reaction, we found that both the activity and product selectivity showed a volcano trend with the ZnO particle size. Interestingly, the highest propane conversion and propylene selectivity were simultaneously achieved on a 4.8 nm ZnO/SiO2 catalyst. The photoluminescence (PL) and NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) results reveal that the size-dependent catalytic activity is proportional to the amounts of both surface oxygen vacancies and the unsaturated Zn sites, suggesting that the oxygen vacancy-induced unsaturated Zn sites are the active sites for PDH. This work provides valuable insights into the particle size effects in tuning the unsaturated Zn sites of ZnO catalysts for efficient PDH.
Experimental
Catalyst synthesis
SiO2 (with a surface area of 300 m2 g−1) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. ZnO/SiO2 catalysts with different particle sizes were synthesized using ALD.52 ZnO ALD was performed in a viscous flow stainless tube reactor (ACME (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd) with a carrier gas of ultrahigh purity N2 (UHP, 99.999%) at a flow rate of 150 mL min−1 at 100 °C. The base pressure was 1.0 Torr. Diethyl zinc (DEZ, 99%, Aimouyuan) was used as the zinc precursor, and deionized water was used as the oxidant. The two precursors were contained in two separate stainless-steel bottles kept at room temperature (RT). After loading the SiO2 support into the ALD reactor, ZnO ALD was carried out with different cycles to obtain a series of ZnO/SiO2 catalysts (denoted as xZnO/SiO2, where x represents the number of ALD cycles). The ALD timing sequence was 100, 480, 100, and 480 s for DEZ exposure, N2 purge, H2O exposure and N2 purge, respectively. For comparison, a commercial ZnO catalyst (Alfa Aesar, ZnO, denoted as ZnO-bulk) was also purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All these samples were reduced ex situ at 600 °C under 10% H2 in Ar for 30 min before conducting any of the following characterization techniques.
Catalyst characterization
The loadings of the xZnO/SiO2 catalysts were determined using an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES, iCAP7400, Thermo Fisher). The morphology was investigated using aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) at 200 kV (JEM-ARM200F, University of Science and Technology of China). Elemental mapping using energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was performed on a JEM-F200 (University of Science and Technology of China) instrument operated at 200 kV. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of these samples were measured in the range of 10–80° on a Japanese Rigaku SmartLab rotation anode X-ray diffractometer equipped with graphite monochromatized Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å).
XAS measurements at the Zn K-edge were conducted at the BL14W1 beamline at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), China. A double Si(111) crystal monochromator was applied for energy selection under the fluorescence mode with a solid-state detector at room temperature. The Athena software package was used for the data analysis.
PL spectra were recorded on an FLS920 spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp as the excitation source (LabRamHR) at room temperature. Prior to PL measurements, all samples were reduced at 600 °C for 30 min under 10% H2 in Ar with a flow rate of 20 mL min−1. The photocatalytic exciton was measured at 325 nm, and the emission was recorded in a wavelength range of 330 to 600 nm.
NH3 TPD was conducted on an automatic chemical adsorption instrument (VDsorb-91i). The amount of 1ZnO/SiO2 was 200 mg, while the amount of the other catalysts was varied to keep the same Zn content. Prior to TPD measurements, all samples were first reduced at 600 °C for 30 min under 10% H2 in Ar with a flow rate of 20 mL min−1. Next, the sample was cooled to RT in He, and NH3 gas was then introduced to the sample for 60 min to ensure saturated adsorption. Afterward, the sample was purged with He to remove the weakly bonded NH3 on the sample. The TPD spectrum was then recorded by increasing the sample temperature from RT to 500 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 in He.
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) measurements were performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 apparatus. Approximately 50 mg of the used catalysts was pretreated at 200 °C for 1 h under flowing Ar (30 mL min−1). Upon cooling the catalyst to 100 °C, the catalyst temperature was gradually increased at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under 10% O2 in Ar (20 mL min−1) from 100 to 750 °C to burn off the accumulated coke. The CO2 in the effluent was monitored and recorded online using a Pfeiffer OmniStar mass spectrometer (MS).
Catalytic performance
The catalytic performance of the ZnO-based catalysts in PDH was determined in a fixed-bed quartz tube reactor under atmospheric pressure at 450–600 °C. The amount of 1ZnO/SiO2 was 600 mg, while the amount of the other catalysts was adjusted to keep the same Zn content. All samples were diluted with 0.8 g of 60–80 mesh quartz chips. Prior to the reaction test, the catalyst was first reduced under 10% H2 in Ar at 600 °C for 30 min. Then, the reaction gas, consisting of 10% propane and 10% H2 balanced by Ar, was introduced into the reactor at a flow rate of 20 mL min−1 to start the reaction. The product was analysed using an online gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-2014) equipped with a flame ionization detector and a capillary column (50 m × 0.53 mm). The propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and deactivation constant rate were defined by the following equations:

Higher kd values indicate a faster deactivation rate.
Results and discussion
Morphology and structural characterization
ZnO/SiO2 catalysts with different ZnO sizes were synthesized by depositing ZnO on the SiO2 support using ZnO ALD at 100 °C with various ALD cycles (denoted as xZnO/SiO2, where x represents the number of ALD cycles). ICP-AES analysis showed that the ZnO loadings increased from 1.4 to 24.1 wt% as the ALD cycles increased from 1 to 10 (Table 1). XRD showed that the bare SiO2 support had a broad diffraction peak between 20 and 30°, assigned to the typical reflection of amorphous SiO2 (Fig. 1). After one cycle of ZnO ALD on SiO2, there was no visible change in the XRD pattern compared with that of the SiO2 support, suggesting the high dispersion of ZnO species. A weak and broad peak located between 30 and 40°, assigned to the diffraction signals of hexagonal phase ZnO (JCPD No. 79-0205), appeared on 3ZnO/SiO2, and its intensity gradually increased as the ZnO ALD cycles increased, indicating the gradual growth of the ZnO size. Such a broad diffraction peak suggests that the ZnO particles in all samples have poor crystallinity. The commercial ZnO catalyst, denoted as ZnO-bulk, showed sharp diffraction peaks at 31.9°, 34.6°, and 36.4°, assigned to (100), (002), and (101), respectively, implying the crystalline hexagonal phase.

HAADF-STEM measurements were further carried out on the xZnO/SiO2 catalysts after H2 reduction at 600 °C (Fig. 2 and S1–S3†). We found that one cycle of ZnO ALD on SiO2 (1ZnO/SiO2) yielded highly dispersed Zn species with a particle size of 0.3 ± 0.1 nm without the formation of any visible clusters or nanoparticles (Fig. 2a and f and S1†), indicating the high stability of atomically dispersed Zn species on the SiO2 support in H2 even at 600 °C. Executing 3 and 5 ZnO ALD cycles further increased the ZnO average size to 2.2 ± 0.4 nm and 4.8 ± 1.0 nm, respectively (Fig. 2b, c and f). When the number of ALD cycles reached 7 and 10, the ZnO island particles became interconnected and resulted in the formation of a discontinuous ZnO thin film (Fig. 2d and S2 and S3†). TEM measurement of the commercial ZnO-bulk catalyst showed that the average ZnO particle size was approximately 44 ± 7 nm (Fig. 2e and f).

To obtain more structural information on the Zn species, XAS was further carried out on the xZnO/SiO2 samples after ex situ reduction at 600 °C. The absorption edge (1s–4p transition)52 position of the X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) curves of all the xZnO/SiO2 samples resembled that of ZnO-bulk, indicating that the valence state of Zn species in all xZnO/SiO2 samples is +2 (Fig. 3a). In addition, we noticed that the peak at 9679 eV, assigned to multiple scattering of Zn–Zn shells according to the ZnO reference,53,54 was barely observed in 1ZnO/SiO2 but its intensity gradually increased as the number of ZnO ALD cycles increased. The Fourier transforms of the extended X-ray absorption fine-structure (EXAFS) curve of 1ZnO/SiO2 exhibited a peak at 1.5 Å (Fig. 3b), assigned to Zn–O coordinations, while the Zn–O–Zn coordination located at 2.9 Å was not detected, confirming the atomic dispersion of Zn, in line with the HAADF-STEM observation (Fig. 2a). As the number of ZnO ALD cycles increased from 1 to 10, the intensity of the Zn–O–Zn coordination peak at 2.9 Å gradually increased, implying the growth of isolated Zn1O species to ZnO particles, in good agreement with the XRD and HRTEM results (Fig. 1 and 2). Least-squares EXAFS fittings showed that the coordination numbers of Zn–O were all similar at approximately 3.7, while the coordination numbers of Zn–O–Zn were 0, 2.1 ± 0.5, and 5.3 ± 0.8 in 1ZnO/SiO2, 5ZnO/SiO2, and 10ZnO/SiO2, respectively (Fig. S4–S6, and Table S1†).

Catalytic performance
The catalytic performance of xZnO/SiO2 and ZnO-bulk catalysts was investigated in the PDH reaction, where the amounts of catalysts were adjusted to keep the same Zn contents. Strikingly, we found that the propane conversion showed a volcano relationship with the number of ALD cycles (or the ZnO particle size) over a broad temperature range from 450 to 600 °C, and all were considerably higher than that of the bare SiO2 support (Fig. 4a), of which 5ZnO/SiO2 showed the highest propane conversion and propylene selectivity at all temperatures. The activity of commercial ZnO-bulk was rather low, reaching a propane conversion of only 8% at 600 °C, consistent with previous reports.55 Reducing the ZnO particle size to 4.8 nm considerably increased the propane conversion to 27%; meanwhile, with a further decrease in the ZnO particle size to isolated Zn1O species, the propane conversion dropped to 13%. Fig. 4b compares the propylene selectivities with the same propane conversion. We surprisingly found that 5ZnO/SiO2, the most active catalyst, showed the highest propylene selectivity, approximately 95%, even at a conversion of 27%. In contrast, all other samples, including 1ZnO/SiO2 with atomically dispersed Zn species, showed considerable decreases in propylene selectivity. The commercial ZnO-bulk showed the lowest propylene selectivity (below 90%) when the conversion was above 5%.

Catalyst durability is a long-term concern in PDH owing to metal sintering and heavy coke formation.56–59 Surprisingly, we again found that the stability of these catalysts as the change of ZnO particle size showed a similar trend with PDH activity and propylene selectivity (Fig. 4c). During the 10 h PDH reaction, all xZnO/SiO2 catalysts deactivated rapidly in the first 1 h and then gradually stabilized, consistent with the literature.23,60 Among these samples, 5ZnO/SiO2 was the most stable catalyst. Meanwhile, 5ZnO/SiO2 retained the highest propylene selectivity during the 10 h stability test. The catalyst stability in PDH can be further reflected by the deactivation constant. The deactivation constant of 5ZnO/SiO2 was 0.030 h−1, considerably lower than that of the other catalysts (Fig. 4d). In addition, we found that the space time yield of olefin formation and deactivation constant of the optimized 5ZnO/SiO2 catalyst were both comparable to those of representative Pt-, CrOx-, or ZnO-based catalysts reported in the literature (Table S2†). Here, the catalyst deactivation was mainly attributed to the loss of Zn according to ICP-AES and coke deposition (seen in the latter discussion). The regeneration capability of 5ZnO/SiO2 was further evaluated, but could be only partially recovered through regenerations due to the loss of Zn (Fig. S7†).
In the oxide-catalysed PDH reaction, the unsaturated metal sites induced by oxygen vacancies have been found to play an essential role in the activation of C–H bonds, where the activation of the first C–H bond in propane is the rate-determining step.12,15,19,23,32,61–65 To further examine whether the oxygen vacancies in xZnO/SiO2 govern the activity in the PDH reaction, PL spectroscopic measurements were conducted. We found that there was one dominant peak located at 518 nm in the PL spectra of all the xZnO/SiO2 catalysts (Fig. 5a), which is assigned to the recombination of two-electron-trapped oxygen vacancies with photogenerated holes.66–68 Evidently, as the number of ZnO ALD cycles increased, the intensity of the peak at 518 nm first increased, reached a maximum on 5ZnO/SiO2, and then decreased gradually as the number of ZnO ALD cycles further increased. Apparently, the number of oxygen vacancies is tightly related to the size of ZnO.12,69 It is also worth mentioning that the propane conversion at 600 °C exhibited an approximately linear function on the amount of oxygen vacancies determined by the peak area of the PL spectra at 518 nm (Fig. 5b and S8†). This result strongly suggests that the unsaturated Zn sites induced by oxygen vacancies are the active sites in ZnO catalysts, in line with the literature.12,15,19,23,32,61–65
Fig. 5 (a) The PL spectrum (λex = 325 nm) and (b) the correlation between the amount of oxygen vacancies and the conversion of propane at 600 °C. (c) The NH3-TPD profiles of the xZnO/SiO2 catalysts with different ZnO sizes and (d) the correlation between the amount of LASs and the conversion of propane at 600 °C.
Unsaturated surface metal sites in metal oxides are often considered Lewis acid sites.15,19,30,61–63,70–73 Thus, NH3-TPD measurements were further conducted to directly probe unsaturated Zn sites on the surfaces of these samples, where the amounts of the samples were varied to ensure the same Zn content. The TPD spectra of all the samples showed a broad asymmetric peak, with the maximum located near 207 °C, assigned to weak Lewis acid sites (LASs), and a shoulder peak at a higher temperature of approximately 329 °C, associated with medium LASs.72 When the ZnO size increased from atomically dispersed Zn1O species to 4.8 nm, the amount of surface LASs increased rapidly (Fig. 5c) and reached a maximum on the 4.8 nm ZnO sample. However, as the ZnO size further increased, the total amount of LASs gradually decreased. Such a volcano relationship of the NH3 adsorption amount and the ZnO particle size is in excellent agreement with the PDH activity and the PL results (Fig. 4a and 5a). LASs have been attributed previously to the active sites in PDH.22,32,47,60,61 To understand the volcano-shaped size dependence of the PDH activity, we further plotted the catalytic activity with the number of LASs (Fig. 5d and S9 and Table S3†), which again exhibited a linear correlation. These results provide strong evidence that surface unsaturated Zn cations accompanied by oxygen vacancies are active sites in PDH, in line with the literature.22,32,47,60,61
It is well known that carbonaceous species can be heavily deposited on the surface of catalysts during the PDH reaction, blocking the active sites and leading to rapid catalyst deactivation.56–59 Here, the total amounts of coke accumulated on the used catalysts were analysed by TPO measurements. It can be seen from Fig. 6 that all the TPO curves of the used catalysts showed one major peak located at 601 °C, which is attributed to the combustion of coke on the catalysts. According to the TPO results of the used catalysts, 5ZnO/SiO2 showed the lowest amount of carbon deposition compared to 1ZnO/SiO2 and 10ZnO/SiO2 with either smaller or larger ZnO sizes (Fig. 6), which is again in line perfectly with the stability trend (Fig. 4c) and the colours of the used samples (Fig. S10†). In conclusion, the higher stability of 5ZnO/SiO2 was attributed to the slower rate of coke accumulation. These results are very interesting, while the underlying mechanism still requires further investigation in the near future.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have prepared a series of xZnO/SiO2 catalysts with sizes varying from atomically dispersed Zn1O species to ZnO nanoparticles and interconnected thin films using ALD by altering the deposition cycles. In the PDH reaction, we demonstrated that the catalytic performance of the xZnO/SiO2 catalysts strongly depends on the ZnO size. The catalyst activity, propylene selectivity and stability all showed a volcano relationship with the ZnO particle size. Very impressively, the 5ZnO/SiO2 catalyst with an average size of 4.8 nm exhibited the highest activity, selectivity and stability simultaneously. PL and NH3-TPD measurements revealed that the amount of unsaturated Zn cations accompanied by surface oxygen vacancies might play an important role in facilitating the cleavage of the C–H bond. In brief, the insight into the particle size effect in ZnO-catalysed PDH reactions in this work points out a way to design advanced metal oxide catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
