Foreword for the Special Issue “Hydrocarbon Chemistry: Activation and Beyond”. Responsible or Irresponsible Use of Hydrocarbons? You Be the Judge!
SPECIAL ISSUE
This article is part of the Hydrocarbon Chemistry: Activation and Beyond special issue.
In the process of choosing contributors for this special issue in Organometallics entitled “Hydrocarbon Chemistry: Activation and Beyond”, we focused our attention on science that interfaced with the frontier areas of organometallic chemistry. Our target was to place special emphasis on organometallic applications that implicated novel transformations and catalysis with, but not limited to, hydrocarbons. This special issue highlights different approaches and synthetic strategies to target unique organometallic reagents as well as to understand C–X bond-activation or bond-making reactions that interface with energy-related transformations, especially those that hold promise in industry. This issue also interfaces homogeneous, heterogeneous, and theoretical communities, all sharing common interests in catalysis and the understanding of reaction mechanisms. As a result, this special issue captures some of the best content in organometallic chemistry involving the “responsible usage” of hydrocarbons. The meaning of the term “responsible” relates to the exploration of noncombustible processes that can better take advantage of the energy stored in these natural resources. We try to emphasize the importance of controlled C–H bond activation and functionalization in our cover art for this issue, as an alternative to the more detrimental (but simpler) process of combustion.
With Guest Editors Christophe Copéret and Alan Goldman, we are privileged to showcase some of the most entertaining reactions involving M–C bonds, hydrocarbon activation, and hydrocarbon functionalization, as well as catalytic processes leading to their functionalization and/or coupling. It is notable to mention that early, mid, and late transition metals, in addition to main-group and lanthanide (and rare-earth) examples, are integral parts of this special issue with solid-, solution-, and gas-phase reactions being included.
A well established pillar of organometallic chemistry has been the preparation of reactive metal–carbon bonds (or multiple bonds) that promote C–H activation reactions of hydrocarbons. (1-4) In this vein, is a series of papers involving the highly electropositive transition and lanthanide metal ions. Legzdins and co-workers (5, 6) publish back-to-back manuscripts that describe the use of well-defined tungsten complexes that can activate and subsequently functionalize hydrocarbons (including methane). (7) Speaking of methane, one major impediment to utilization of this valuable resource is the limited understanding of its reactivity in the gas phase. Schwarz and co-workers (8) address this challenge in their combined experimental and theoretical study of the thermal gas-phase chemistry of CH4. By moving diagonally from tungsten to niobium compounds with strained organometallic ligands, Etienne and co-workers (9) report stereospecific C–H bond splitting reactions via a 1,3-CH addition process. (10) Cundari and Parveen (11) compliment some of the early-transition-metal chemistry by “theoretically” tuning Ta(III) systems that can undergo oxidation addition of a C–H bond. The chemistry of a rare example of a zirconium methylidene is also reported in this issue (Mindiola and co-workers (12)), including its ability to transfer the CH2 unit to arene C–H bonds. Tilley, Levine, and Andersen (13) push the boundary even further by demonstrating, irrefutably, that scandium and yttrium methylidenes can be generated. If you think C–H bonds are tough, wait until you read Diaconescu and Huang’s work (14) on C–F activation with rare-earth metals! (15) Organometallic chemistry is further extended to the lanthanides in work from Rozenel, Perrin, Eisenstein, and Andersen, (16) who report an elegant combination of experiment and theory involving classical metallocene systems of La and Ce, to understand how an amide is transformed into an enamide. Just when we thought we were finished with electrophilic metals, our special issue was fortunate to include a theoretical study by Ess and co-workers (17) addressing the mechanism of action for arene C–H functionalization using the p-block complex Tl(TFA)3 (TFA = trifluoroacetate). (18)
Moving to the more electron rich transition metals, included in this issue are fundamentally important transformations that help to elucidate the role of the metal in the C–X bond-breaking and -making processes. An example is reported by Esteruelas and co-workers (19) involving the oxidative addition of carbon–chlorine and −hydrogen bonds to rhodium complexes supported by a pincer ligand. Baudoin and co-workers (20) further show how changes in the biarylphosphine ligand have profound effects on the selectivity of ester enolate arylation with palladium reagents, while Shi and co-workers (21) apply nickel catalysts to the oxidative coupling of unactivated sp3 C–H Bonds in conjunction with mechanistic studies.
When one considers the C–H activation of hydrocarbons, it is virtually unthinkable to understand how the metal promotes this reaction without the formation of an elusive σ-complex. (22) Weller and co-workers report on just such a complex, by using an electron-rich Rh(I) cation. (23) If you think you understand the influence of superacids on metal–carbon bonds in Shilov-type chemistry, (24) take a good look at the report by Roddick and co-workers. (25) Protonation reactions of complexes having two Pt–CH3 bonds are featured in this article, and in a bizarre twist of events it is found that one metal–alkyl bond is significantly more resistant than the other to protonation using the superacid mix HF/SbF5!
Not unexpectedly, catalytic organometallic transformations are at the core of many applications in science and energy. Paving the way for greener science are various papers reported in this issue that illustrate the use of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts for important transformations. One particular reaction that has drawn incredible attention is the borylation of hydrocarbons with a diboron reagent. (26) Chirik and co-workers (27) present an air-stable Co(II) precatalyst that promotes the borylation of arenes and heteroarenes, along with some evidence for how the catalyst becomes deactivated. Moving down the periodic table to the more precious iridium, Sunoj and co-workers (28) apply theoretical studies to help understand how an Ir(III) tris-boryl species can selectively catalyze the borylation of the sp3 C–H bond in the substrate (2-propylphenyl)dimethylsilane. (29) Catalytic reactions involving the arylation of sterically congested aromatic C–H bonds are also reported by Kakiuchi and co-workers (30) using Ru(II) precursors, while Sanford and co-workers (31) show how silver salts play critical roles in palladium-catalyzed C–H activation and functionalization of arenes and heteroarenes. If you want to learn about the coinage effect (32) involving carbene insertion reactions into C–H bonds, I urge you to examine the paper by Perez and co-workers. (33) Moving down the triad from Cu to Ag to Au delivery agents brings in a big surprise! If you are instead seeking crystalline, air-stable, nonhygroscopic, and nontoxic carbene sources purely designed to carry out cyclopropanation, I recommend you read the paper by Chen and co-workers. (34) Their reagent is easier to handle than diazoalkanes and provides an alternative to the Simmons–Smith reagent. (35) The set of catalytic reactions in this special issue also includes oxidation reactions. Martins and Pombeiro (36) use microwave irradiation, an Fe(II) catalyst, and peroxides to effect cyclohexane oxidation, while Crabtree and co-workers (37) show that Cp*- or CO-supported Ir(IV) oxo species (also known to oxidize water) (38) can oxidize unactivated C–H bonds. Using 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol-d1 as the labeling source, Vedernikov and co-workers (39) demonstrate that platinum-catalyzed oxidation can effect H/D exchange in benzene or other arene substrates having benzylic hydrogens, with high selectivity at the sp2 C–H bond. To complete our catalytic-based papers in this issue, we also include hydrogenation and its microscopic reverse reaction, dehydrogenation, (40-42) recognizing that these are burgeoning areas in organometallic catalysis. Using homogeneous systems, Mankad and Karunananda (43) show how cooperativity between Ag and Ru can endorse the E-selective semihydrogenation of alkynes. Moving in the oppose direction, Shih and Ozerov (44) report an iridium complex, supported by a unique pincer ligand, that engages in the catalytic transfer dehydrogenation of cyclooctane. We are also delighted to include an example of heterogeneous catalysts that carry out hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions. Copéret and co-workers (45) demonstrate that Cr(III) ions supported on SiO2–Al2O3 and Al2O3 surfaces can perform propane dehydrogenation at high temperatures, and hydrogenation reactions are also explored to study the corresponding mechanism.
The guest editors and I want to thank all of the authors for their excellent contributions and for providing us with an unforgettable and tasty flavor of the exciting science in the realm of C–H bond activation and beyond. We also wish to extend thanks to all the invaluable feedback provided by our reviewer community on all the original submissions. If you are seeking inspiration from experimental and theoretical studies that target important transformations pertinent to hydrocarbon utilization as well as transformations (methane and beyond), then the material shown in this issue will be of great interest to you! We part on a note of caution to the reader: the following content may contain elements (rare-earth, early, mid, late, lanthanide, and main group like) that are not suitable for some audiences (especially chemists that do not care for hydrocarbons and catalysis), so reader/viewer discretion is strongly advised!

The guest editors and I want to thank all of the authors for their excellent contributions and for providing us with an unforgettable and tasty flavor of the exciting science in the realm of C–H bond activation and beyond. We also wish to extend thanks to all the invaluable feedback provided by our reviewer community on all the original submissions. If you are seeking inspiration from experimental and theoretical studies that target important transformations pertinent to hydrocarbon utilization as well as transformations (methane and beyond), then the material shown in this issue will be of great interest to you! We part on a note of caution to the reader: the following content may contain elements (rare-earth, early, mid, late, lanthanide, and main group like) that are not suitable for some audiences (especially chemists that do not care for hydrocarbons and catalysis), so reader/viewer discretion is strongly advised!

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
