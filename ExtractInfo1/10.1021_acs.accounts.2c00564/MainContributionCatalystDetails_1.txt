The provided document discusses hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanomaterials and their applications in catalysis, but does not specifically relate to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document focuses on the synthesis methods for producing h-BN nanomaterials and using them as metal-free catalysts or supports for metal nanoparticles. However, it does not report any data on propane conversion to propylene. Therefore, I have indicated that the document is not directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation.
