The given document discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using CO2 over metal-promoted Cr/SiO2 catalysts. It does not relate to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document focuses on evaluating different metal promoters (Zr, Ce, Sr, Sn) for Cr/SiO2 catalysts and their effect on the catalytic performance for ethane ODH with CO2. No information is provided regarding propane dehydrogenation.
