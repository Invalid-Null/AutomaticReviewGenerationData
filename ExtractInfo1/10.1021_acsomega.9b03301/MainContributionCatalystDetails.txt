 Unfortunately, the given documents do not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation as they all focus on oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. Since no propane dehydrogenation details are provided, I cannot aggregate or synthesize any meaningful information. The output would simply indicate no relevance:

	<Relevance>No</Relevance>

The documents discuss ethane ODH, not propane dehydrogenation or oxidative dehydrogenation. Therefore, there is no relevant information to extract or summarize regarding advances in propane dehydrogenation catalysts or processes.
