The provided extracts do not contain any information relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. They focus on the synthesis and characterization of lanthanum-doped gamma alumina nanoparticles as potential catalyst supports, without any mention of propane conversion or propylene yield. Since there are no details provided about using these materials as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, I cannot synthesize any meaningful information for the XML structure. The documents appear unrelated to propane dehydrogenation research based on the given excerpts.
