Spectroscopic Characterizations of Porous Mixed Metal Oxides Derived from Metal–Organic Framework MIL-53(Ga, Al) for Propane Dehydrogenation
Abstract
The structure and properties of porous mixed metal oxide catalysts (GaxAl2–xO3 and Pt/GaxAl2–xO3) derived from calcination treatment of bimetallic MIL-53(Ga, Al) precursors were comprehensively characterized using XRD, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, TEM, and solid-state NMR. Both Ga and Pt species are highly dispersed in Pt/Ga0.1Al1.9O3 and Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3 catalysts with low Ga content, whereas Ga2O3 particles are present in Ga1.0Al1.0O3 and Ga1.5Al0.5O3 catalysts with high Ga content. Well-mixed Al and Ga species in the calcined Ga0.1Al1.9O3 and Ga0.5Al1.5O3 samples are identified from 1H–71Ga S-RESPDOR and 1H–27Al TRAPDOR NMR experiments. The coordination states and relative amounts of Al and Ga species in the MIL-53(Ga, Al) derivatives are determined by 27Al and 71Ga MAS NMR measurements. It is found that Pt species are readily anchored with pentacoordinate Al, favoring the formation of tetrahedral GaIV species, and the synergy between highly dispersed Pt and tetrahedral GaIV active species in Pt/Ga0.1Al1.9O3 and Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3 catalysts renders their superior catalytic performance with high conversion and good recyclability toward the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

Propylene is an important raw material for the production of industrial chemicals such as polypropylene and polyacrylonitrile. With the growing demand for propylene, the production of propylene via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has attracted widespread attention. Pt–Sn-based catalyst, chromium oxide-based catalyst, and gallium supported oxide are highly efficient for promoting the propane dehydrogenation process. (1−3) The Pt-based catalyst exhibits excellent propane dehydrogenation activity due to its affinity for paraffinic C–H bonds, but it tends to be coked and sintered. The CrOx-based catalyst is highly toxic and environmentally unfriendly in spite of its high catalytic activity. Ga2O3-containing catalyst exhibits low toxicity and low cost for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. It is well-recognized that Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalyst displays superior catalytic performance for dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence or absence of CO2. (4−8) Moreover, loading Pt onto a Ga2O3/Al2O3 support could significantly improve the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation reaction due to its high activity, high selectivity, and simple regeneration process. (9−14) The synergistic effect between Ga and Pt species on Pt–Ga/Al2O3 catalysts could result in high activity for propane dehydrogenation (9) in which the coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species is active while the Pt species acts as promoter. In addition, a high content of pentacoordinate Al sites in Al2O3 can lead to high dispersion of Pt and Ga species on the support, thus increasing the synergistic effect between Pt and Ga2O3 in the dehydrogenation of propane. (15)
Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) as a class of porous materials with well-defined crystalline structure and facilely tailored pore properties have attracted broad attention in various application fields. (16−18) Thermal treatment of MOFs can produce porous derived materials such as metal oxides, carbon nanostructures, metal-based compounds, and their composites. (19−25) The MOFs derivatives with large surface area, excellent stability, and tunable structures afford their extensive applications in thermocatalysis, photocatalysis, and electrocatalysis. (26−32) Direct calcination of MOF precursors under air atmosphere could generate metal oxide catalysts and supports utilized in heterogeneous catalysis including oxidation reaction, hydrogenation reaction, dehydrogenation reaction, and Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. (33−37) The MOF derivatives such as cobalt oxides derived from ZIF-8, Zn/Co bimetallic ZIFs, and Fe-BTC have exhibited great potential in the direct propane dehydrogenation process. (38−40) Moreover, Al-based MIL-53-derived mesoporous Al2O3 can be used as catalyst support in the selective hydrogenation of m-chloronitrobenzene, (41) hydrogenolysis of furfural, (42) and dry reformation of methane. (43) To the best of our knowledge, the fabrication and characterization of Al-based or Ga-based MOFs derivatives for the highly efficient propane dehydrogenation reaction has not been reported so far.
In this work, porous GaxAl2–xO3 catalysts were synthesized by calcining the bimetallic MIL-53(Ga, Al) precursor in air at high temperature, and the Pt/GaxAl2–xO3 catalysts were obtained by loading Pt onto GaxAl2–xO3 via wetness impregnation. The physicochemical properties of these MIL-53(Ga, Al) derivatives as catalysts were comprehensively characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, TEM, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The propane dehydrogenation reactions on both the GaxAl2–xO3 and Pt/GaxAl2–xO3 catalysts were examined to evaluate their catalytic activity, selectivity, and recyclability. The Pt/Ga0.1Al1.9O3 and Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3 catalysts exhibit high conversion and good recyclability toward propane dehydrogenation reaction.

2.1. Sample Preparation
2.1.1. Synthesis of MIL-53(Al) and Bimetallic MIL-53(Ga, Al)
MIL-53(Al) and bimetallic MIL-53(Ga, Al) as precursors were synthesized according to the previous literatures with minor modifications. (44,45) For the synthesis of MIL-53(Al), 18.8 g of Al(NO3)3·9H2O and 4.1 g of terephthalic acid (H2BDC) were dissolved in 30 mL of water. The mixture was placed in the autoclave and heated at 220 °C for 3 days for crystallization. The obtained MIL-53(Al) was centrifuged and washed with DMF three times to remove the unreacted H2BDC linkers. For the synthesis of bimetallic MIL-53(Ga, Al), 0.6 g of Ga(NO3)3·xH2O, 17.8 g of Al(NO3)3·9H2O, and 4.1 g of terephthalic acid (H2BDC) were dissolved in 30 mL of water. The resulting solution was stirred and subsequently transferred to an autoclave and heated at 220 °C for 72 h for crystallizations. The obtained sample herein was designated as MIL-53(Ga0.1, Al1.9). Likewise, other bimetallic MIL-53(Gax, Al2–x) (x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5), where x and 2–x represented the relative content of Ga and Al species, respectively, were harvested using a similar procedure by modulating the amounts of Ga(NO3)3·xH2O and Al(NO3)3·9H2O.
2.1.2. Synthesis of GaxAl2–xO3 Catalysts
The as-prepared bimetallic MIL-53(Gax, Al2–x) (x = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) precursors were placed on a quartz crucible for a calcination treatment in dry air atmosphere at specified temperatures in a tube furnace. Typically, the temperature was raised from room temperature to a target temperature (550, 600, and 650 °C) at a rate of 1 °C/min and then kept at that temperature for 10 h. After the calcination treatment, the MIL-53(Ga, Al) precursors were transformed into white powders. The obtained samples are denoted hereafter as GaxAl2–xO3(T) where T represents the calcination temperature (550, 600, and 650 °C).
2.1.3. Synthesis of Pt/GaxAl2–xO3 Catalysts
As-synthesized GaxAl2–xO3 (x = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0) samples (0.2 g) were impregnated with 3 mL of hydrochloric acid solution of H2PtCl6. The resulting mixtures were dried at 50 °C under stirring and subsequently calcined under flowing air at 550 °C for 2 h to yield the Pt/GaxAl2–xO3 (x = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0) catalysts. Pt/Al2O3 was prepared using a similar procedure. Each above-mentioned sample contained a Pt loading of 0.5 wt %.
2.1.4. Dehydration of Samples
Prior to 1H MAS NMR experiments, ca. 60 mg of samples was packed into glass tubes, which were connected to a vacuum line. The temperature was gradually increased from room temperature to 400 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min and kept at 400 °C and a pressure below 2 Pa for 12 h to dehydrate the samples. The glass tubes were flame-sealed. The sealed sample was transferred into a 4 mm NMR rotor under a dry nitrogen atmosphere in a glovebox for subsequent measurements.
2.2. Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements of as-prepared samples were conducted on a Bruker D/Max2550 instrument using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) were performed on a FEI Talos F200X instrument at 200 kV. The N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were carried out at 77 K on a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 system. Prior to nitrogen adsorption, all samples were dehydrated under vacuum for 8 h at 200–300 °C. The total surface area and the pore volume were determined by BET equation and a t-plot method, respectively.
Solid-state NMR experiments were carried out on a Bruker Avance III 500 spectrometer. The Larmor frequencies were 500.6, 130.4, and 152.7 MHz for 1H, 27Al, and 71Ga nuclei, respectively. 1H and 27Al MAS NMR experiments were conducted with the 4 mm double-resonance probe at a spinning speed of 14 kHz. 1H MAS NMR spectra were recorded with a π/2 pulse length of 4 μs and a recycle delay of 2 s. 27Al MAS NMR spectra were acquired with a pulse length of 0.3 μs (< π/12) and a recycle delay of 1 s. In the 2D 27Al multiple-quantum (MQ) MAS z-filtering NMR experiments, (46) the pulse length applied for the excitation and the reconversion of triple-quantum coherences was 5.6 and 2.3 μs, respectively. The length of the soft π/2 pulse was set to 19.6 μs. 1H/27Al TRAPDOR experiments (47) were carried out with a spinning speed of 14 kHz, an irradiation time of 143 μs, and a radio frequency (RF) field strength of 62.5 kHz for 27Al. 1H–71Ga S-RESPDOR experiments (48) was acquired with the repetition scans of 512 and recycle delay of 2 s at a spinning speed of 12.5 kHz. In the 1H–71Ga S-RESPDOR experiments, the duration of 71Ga saturation pulse was set to 1.5 rotor periods with a RF field strength of 110 kHz. 1H–71Ga dipolar coupling was reintroduced by applying an SR412 heteronuclear recoupling scheme on 1H channel with pulse strength of 25 kHz. 71Ga MAS NMR spectra of various MIL-53(Ga, Al) derivatives were collected using a 2.5 mm double-resonance probe at a spinning rate of 30 kHz, irradiation pulse width of 0.7 μs, recycle delay of 1 s. 1H, 27Al, and 71Ga chemical shifts were referenced to adamantine (1.78 ppm), 1 M Al(NO3)3 solution (0 ppm), and 1 M Ga(NO3)3 solution (0 ppm), respectively.
2.3. Catalytic Propane Dehydrogenation Evaluation
The propane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a continuous flow reactor system equipped with a fixed-bed quartz tubular reactor (4 mm inner diameter) using 0.15 g of catalysts pellets with 40–60 mesh. Before the reaction, the catalysts were heated in the reactor from room temperature to 550 °C at a ramp rate of 1 °C/min under 30 mL/min He gas and kept at that temperature for 60 min. Subsequently, the reaction was initiated by switching the reaction feed to a mixture of propane and N2 (C3H8/N2 = 1:9, 20 mL/min) through a mass flow controller with a WHSV of 1.4 h–1. The propane dehydrogenation reactions over the various catalysts were examined at 550 °C for 140 min. The gas compositions were analyzed online using an Agilent 7890B GC equipped with a flame-ionization detector (FID) and a fused silica capillary column Supel-Q PLOT. For the regeneration test, the spent catalysts were regenerated at 550 °C for 45 min in a flowing dry air (17% O2 in N2). The conversion of propane and selectivity of propylene were calculated using the following equations

3.1. Characterizations of MIL-53(Ga, Al) Derivatives
Figure 1 shows the PXRD patterns of calcined GaxAl2–xO3 (x = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) at 550, 600, and 650 °C in comparison with the MIL-53(Ga, Al) precursors. As shown in Figure 1, the XRD patterns of as-made MIL-53(Gax, Al2–x) (x = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) demonstrate the high crystallinity of synthesized samples. (49,50) After calcination treatment of the MIL-53(Gax, Al2–x) precursors, the XRD patterns of obtained GaxAl2–xO3 resemble those of Al2O3 and/or Ga2O3 monocomponent oxides, confirming that the MIL-53(Gax, Al2–x) precursors were decomposed and transformed into the metal oxides. Only the amorphous phase can be resolved in the XRD patterns of Ga0.1Al1.9O3 and Ga0.5Al1.5O3 (Figure 1a,b), while the XRD patterns of the Pt/Ga0.1Al1.9O3 and Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3 samples exhibit a crystallized phase of γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS card no. 29-0063) as manifested in Figure 1c,d, implying that the addition of Pt likely benefits the crystallization of γ-Al2O3. (41) Both the addition of HCl solution and calcination treatment could result in the structural change of metal oxides. The absence of reflection peak from Ga and Pt species reveals that the corresponding species are highly dispersed on Pt/Ga0.1Al1.9O3 and Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3 catalysts. In the XRD patterns of the Ga1.0Al1.0O3 and Ga1.5Al0.5O3, α-Ga2O3 and β-Ga2O3 phases gradually appear as the calcination temperature increases (Figure 1e,f). (51) Thermal treatment of bimetallic MIL-53(Ga, Al) with high Ga contents results in the partial phase separation of Ga2O3 particles. The XRD results provide clear evidence for the structural variation from MIL-53(Ga, Al) precursors to metal oxides.

XRD patterns of MIL-53(Ga, Al) precursors and MIL-53(Ga, Al) derivatives: (a) MIL-53(Ga0.1, Al1.9) and Ga0.1Al1.9O3, (b) MIL-53(Ga0.5, Al1.5) and Ga0.5Al1.5O3, (c) Pt/Ga0.1Al1.9O3, (d) Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3, (e) MIL-53(Ga1.0, Al1.0) and Ga1.0Al1.0O3, and (f) MIL-53(Ga1.5, Al0.5) and Ga1.5Al0.5O3.
The morphology and nanostructures of MIL-53(Ga, Al) precursors and their derivatives were further characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Figure 2a shows the TEM image of the MIL-53(Ga0.5, Al1.5) precursor, in which flakelike and smooth-surfaced particles are present. (52,53) Upon thermal treatment of MIL-53(Ga0.5, Al1.5) at 550 °C, the surface of calcined Ga0.5Al1.5O3(550) becomes obviously rough (Figure 2b). The increase of calcination temperature results in appearance of channel-like mesopores structure in Ga0.5Al1.5O3(600) and Ga0.5Al1.5O3(650) (Figures 2c,d and S1). As manifested in Figure 2e, Pt particles could not be discernible in the TEM image of Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3(650), suggesting the high dispersion of Pt particles in the catalyst. Note that the small Pt particles cannot be clearly identified due to the resolution limit of the TEM image (Figure 2e). In addition, HAADF-TEM and EDX elemental mapping clearly indicate a homogeneous distribution of Al, Ga, and Pt species in the Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3(650) catalyst (Figure 2f). Similar results could be observable in the TEM image and EDX mapping of Pt/Ga0.1Al1.9O3(550) (see Figure S2).

In addition, N2 adsorption–desorption analysis was conducted to characterize the textural structures of GaxAl2–xO3 (x = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) catalysts. As shown in Figure 3a (inset), the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm of MIL-53(Ga0.5, Al1.5) exhibits a typical type-I pattern, corresponding to the microporosity of MIL-53 (Figure 3b). The isotherms of GaxAl2–xO3 samples show hysteresis loops between adsorption and desorption curves, a characteristic feature of type-IV isotherm, confirming the presence of mesopores in these calcined catalysts (Figure 3a,c). The BET surface areas and porosity parameters of each sample are calculated from the adsorption–desorption isotherms and summarized in Table 1. The MIL-53(Ga0.5, Al1.5) precursor exhibited the highest surface area of 1090 m2 g–1 and a micropore volume of 0.55 cm3 g–1. After calcination treatment at 550 °C, the decrease of the BET surface area (43 m2 g–1) and pore volume (0.18 cm3 g–1) in Ga0.5Al1.5O3(550) is mainly arising from the collapse of the MIL-53 framework. Coke species is likely retained on the Ga0.5Al1.5O3(550) catalyst, whereas the increase of calcination temperature can efficiently remove these carbon species. The complete decomposition of 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid from MIL-53(Ga, Al) at 600 °C results in an increased surface area (270 m2 g–1) and pore volume (0.91 cm3 g–1) of Ga0.5Al1.5O3(600) compared to those of Ga0.5Al1.5O3(550) (see Table 1). The pore volume of Ga0.5Al1.5O3(650) is relatively greater than that of Ga1.5Al0.5O3(650), which is probably due to the aggregation of Ga2O3 particles inside the latter (Figure 3d). As the increase of Ga contents, the formation of Ga2O3 species as detected by XRD partially blocks the pores of Ga1.5Al0.5O3(650), thus resulting in the decline of BET surface area and pore volume of the samples. Based on the textural analysis, the obtained GaxAl2–xO3 (x = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) samples possess porous features with moderate surface area.

Solid-state NMR has been extensively utilized to characterize the structure and property of porous materials and metal oxides. (54−66)13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of bimetallic MIL-53(Gax, Al2–x) (x = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) precursors confirm the synthesized samples are in large pore (lp) and/or narrow pore (np) forms (Figure S3). (67) Herein, 1H, 27Al, and 71Ga solid-state NMR were used to extract the structural information and coordination environments of the MIL-53(Ga, Al)-derived porous metal oxides. Figure 4a,b shows the 1H MAS NMR spectra of MIL-53(Ga0.5, Al1.5) precursors and their derivatives. In the 1H MAS NMR spectrum of MIL-53(Ga0.5, Al1.5), two signals at 7.9 and 2.6 ppm are unambiguously assigned to BDC aromatic protons and Al-OH-Al bridges, respectively. (49,50) After thermal treatment of MIL-53(Ga0.5, Al1.5) at the temperature in range of 550–650 °C, four signals can be clearly distinguished in the 1H MAS NMR spectra of Ga0.5Al1.5O3 (Figure 4a). The shoulder resonance at 0.3 ppm is tentatively assigned to a terminal Al-μ1-OH group or basic GaOH group. (68,69) The main peak at 1.9 ppm is arising from the double Al-μ2-OH group or double Ga-μ2-OH group. In addition, the chemical shift at 4.0 ppm can be assigned to triple Al-μ3-OH. The minor signal at 7.7 ppm is ascribed to bridging (Ga-OH-Al) species according to the previous work conducted by Cook and co-workers. (70) The presence of hydroxyl groups linked to one Al and one Ga center (Ga–OH-Al) was also confirmed by Ashbrook and co-workers in mixed-metal MIL-53(Ga, Al) using 17O MQMAS NMR measurements. (49,50) It is notable that 1H NMR chemical shifts of Ga0.5Al1.5O3 could not be unambiguously assigned due to the spectral overlapping. These signals are also evident in the 1H MAS NMR spectra of Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3, Ga0.1Al1.9O3, Ga1.0Al1.0O3, and Ga1.5Al0.5O3 (see Figures 4b and S4). The relative intensity of each component in the 1H MAS NMR spectra is affected to some extent by the variation of the Ga/Al ratios, thermal treatment temperatures, and Pt loadings. In order to examine whether the protons were in close proximity to 71Ga/27Al nuclei or not, 1H–71Ga S-RESPDOR and 1H–27Al TRAPDOR NMR experiments were carried out. 1H NMR signals would undergo dipolar dephasing as the irradiation of neighboring 71Ga/27Al nuclei. S and S0 represent the signal intensity with and without 71Ga/27Al irradiation, respectively, in the 1H–71Ga S-RESPDOR and 1H–27Al TRAPDOR NMR spectra. ΔS obtained by subtracting S from S0 denotes the difference spectrum, which is used to determine the dipolar dephasing degree and explore the spatial proximity between protons and Ga/Al nuclei. The signals at 0.3, 1.9, 4.0, and 7.7 ppm exhibit dipolar dephasing in both the 1H–71Ga S-RESPDOR and 1H–27Al TRAPDOR NMR spectra (Figure 4c,d). The peak at 4.0 ppm arising from the Al-μ3-OH group undergoes more pronounced dipolar dephasing in the 1H–27Al TRAPDOR experiment compared to that of the 1H–71Ga S-RESPDOR experiment. All of these signals undergo simultaneous dipolar dephasing with 71Ga and 27Al irradiation, indicating the good mixing of Al and Ga species in the Ga0.5Al1.5O3. Thermal treatment of mixed-metal MIL-53(Ga0.5, Al1.5) at 650 °C in air atmosphere results in Al and Ga species in close spatial proximity in Ga0.5Al1.5O3 catalyst. Similar results could be observed in the 1H–71Ga S-RESPDOR and 1H–27Al TRAPDOR NMR spectra of Ga0.1Al1.9O3(650), Ga1.0Al1.0O3(650), and Ga1.5Al0.5O3 (650) (see Figure S5).

27Al MAS NMR and 27Al MQMAS NMR were further applied to examine the aluminum states in the MIL-53(Ga, Al)-derived metal oxides. Parts a–d of Figure 5 show the 27Al MAS NMR spectra of MIL-53(Ga, Al) derivatives in comparison with MIL-53(Ga, Al) precursors. The well-defined quadrupolar line shape is arising from AlO6 octahedra with an identical Al environment in the 27Al MAS NMR spectra of the parent MIL-53(Gax, Al2–x). (71−73) After thermal treatment, three main signals at 6, 38, and 68 ppm could be well resolved in the 27Al MAS NMR spectra of calcined GaxAl2–xO3 samples, which can be assigned to octahedral AlO6, pentacoordinate AlO5, and tetrahedral AlO4, respectively. (74) Moreover, 27Al signals from octahedral AlO6, pentacoordinate AlO5, and tetrahedral AlO4 sites are clearly observable in the 27Al MQMAS spectra of calcined GaxAl2–xO3 (x = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) (see Figure 5g and Figure S6). The peak assignments and the corresponding integrated areas obtained from spectral deconvolution of 27Al MAS NMR spectra are manifested in Table S1. Note that quantitative analysis of the tetrahedral AlO4, pentacoordinate AlO5, and octahedral AlO6 sites is strongly subjected to the hydration state of the samples. (75) The relative amount of AlO5 species is gradually reduced with an increase of Ga content in the mixed-metal oxides (see Figure 6a). Meanwhile, the total amounts of AlO5 and AlO4 species in the GaxAl2–xO3 (x = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) samples decrease slightly as the calcination temperature increases (see Table S1). In the 27Al MAS NMR spectra of Pt/Ga0.1Al1.9O3 and Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3 samples as shown in Figure 5e,f, it is obvious that the relative peak intensity of pentacoordinate AlO5 significantly decreases upon loading of Pt as manifested in Figure 6a, implying that the Pt species is readily anchored by the pentacoordinate AlO5 site. By using ultrahigh magnetic field 27Al MAS NMR measurements, Kwak and co-workers demonstrated that strong interactions between pentacoordinate Al and catalytically active phase (Pt) are present in the Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.

In order to unravel the coordination state of Ga species in MIL-53(Ga, Al) derivatives, 71Ga MAS NMR spectra were recorded. Figure 7 shows the 71Ga MAS NMR spectra of GaxAl2–xO3 (x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) and Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3 catalysts. After calcination treatment of the MIL-53(Ga, Al) precursors, two signals centered at ca. 200 and 10 ppm can be observable in the 71Ga MAS NMR spectra, which can be assigned to tetrahedrally coordinated gallium (GaIV) and octahedrally coordinated gallium (GaVI), respectively (9,51,77) (Figure 7a–c). Based on quantitative analysis of the integrated areas, the relative intensity of the tetrahedral GaIV site gradually increases as the calcination temperature increases (see Table S2). The relative peak intensities of tetrahedral GaIV species in Ga1.0Al1.0O3 and Ga1.5Al0.5O3 are significantly lower than that in Ga0.5Al1.5O3, probably due to the formation of Ga2O3 clusters in the catalysts with high Ga content as observed from XRD measurements (see Figures 1e,f and 6b). According to the previous literature, (51,78) Ga2O3 in various forms consisted of high amounts of octahedrally coordinated gallium (GaVI) and low amounts of tetrahedrally coordinated gallium (GaIV). In the 71Ga MAS NMR spectra of Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3, the relative peak intensity of the GaIV species increases obviously upon loading of Pt compared with that of Ga0.5Al1.5O3 (see Figure 7a,d), indicating the enrichment of tetrahedral GaIV species on the surface of Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3. A similar phenomenon was observed on the surface of platinum-promoted Ga/Al2O3 catalyst. (9)

Based on our experimental observations, significant variations can be discerned in the 1H, 27Al, and 71Ga MAS NMR spectra of bimetallic MIL-53(Ga, Al) upon thermal treatment. The good mixing of Al and Ga species in calcined metal oxides is identified from the 1H–71Ga S-RESPDOR and 1H–27Al TRAPDOR NMR experiments. The coordination states and the relative amounts of Al and Ga species in MIL-53(Ga, Al) derivatives are quantitatively determined from the 27Al and 71Ga MAS NMR spectra. The unsaturated pentacoordinate AlO5 site tends to anchor the loaded Pt active species via oxygen bridges to generate a more stable octacoordinate AlO6 site. (15) The presence of Pt results in the enrichment of tetrahedrally coordinated gallium (GaIV) species, probably due to the formation of Pt–Ga alloy on the Pt/GaxAl2–xO3 catalyst surface. (9) It can be deduced that the Pt active species is readily anchored by pentacoordinate Al and readily promotes the formation of tetrahedral GaIV species in Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3.
3.2. Catalytic Performance of Propane Dehydrogenation Reaction over MIL-53(Ga, Al) Derivatives
To investigate the catalytic performance of the MIL-53(Ga, Al) derivatives, the propane dehydrogenation reaction over the GaxAl2–xO3 and Pt/GaxAl2–xO3 catalysts was conducted at 550 °C. Figure 8 shows the propane conversion and propene selectivity over the GaxAl2–xO3 (x = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) and Pt/GaxAl2–xO3 (x = 0.1, 0.5) catalysts. The initial C3H8 conversion for Ga0.1Al1.9O3(650), Ga0.5Al1.5O3(650), Ga1.0Al1.0O3(650), and Ga1.5Al0.5O3(650) is determined to be 30%, 44%, 48%, and 34%, respectively. After 140 min of time on stream, the C3H8 conversions for these four samples decrease to 14%, 16%, 16%, and 12%, respectively, due to the formation of coke over the catalysts (Figure 8a–d). High C3H6 selectivity (>85%) is preserved as the increase of time on stream over the GaxAl2–xO3 catalysts. High conversion of propane on Ga0.5Al1.5O3 and Ga1.0Al1.0O3 is probably attributed to the large concentration of the highly dispersed GaIV species in these catalysts. Generally, the initial activity of the PDH reaction is strongly related to the amounts of GaIV species acting as active center in the Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts. (4,6,79) It is notable that the increase of calcination temperature of the parent MIL-53(Ga, Al) from 550 to 650 °C can slightly improve the PDH catalytic activity of the GaxAl2–xO3 catalysts, probably due to the slight increase of GaIV content.

Loading of Pt on the GaxAl2–xO3 catalysts can further improve the PDH catalytic reactivity. The C3H8 conversion on Pt/Ga0.1Al1.9O3 and Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3 is significantly higher than that on Ga0.1Al1.9O3 and Ga0.5Al1.5O3 samples (Figure 8e,f). However, the increase of Ga content on Pt/Ga1.0Al1.0O3(650) cannot effectively improve the C3H8 conversion (see Figure S7). According to the XRD analysis, the calcination of the MIL-53(Ga, Al) precursor with high Ga content leads to the formation of Ga2O3 particles, which may block parts of pores and make the catalyst less active for the PDH reaction. The initial C3H8 conversion on Pt/Al2O3 (46%) is significantly lower than that on Pt/Ga0.1Al1.9O3 (70%) catalyst, implying that the synergistic effect between Pt and Ga species plays an essential role in the PDH reactivity. According to our 27Al MAS NMR measurements, the pentacoordinated AlO5 acts as an anchor site for highly dispersed and stabilized Pt on the surface of the Pt/Ga0.1Al1.9O3 and Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3 catalysts. The synergy between highly dispersed Pt and GaIV species facilitates the prominent reactivity toward propane dehydrogenation reaction.
In order to examine the stability for the PDH catalytic process, the dehydrogenation–regeneration cycles over Pt/Ga0.1Al1.9O3(550) and Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3(650) catalysts were conducted. Figure 9 shows the C3H8 conversion and hydrocarbon selectivity as a function of time on stream over three cycles with an air oxidation regeneration treatment. The initial C3H8 conversion on Pt/Ga0.1Al1.9O3 is determined to be 70% in the first cycle and slightly dropped in the third cycle (Figure 9a). A slight decline for the C3H8 conversion on Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3 (650) in the dehydrogenation–regeneration cycles is observed as well (Figure 9b). Note that C3H6 selectivity remains stable during the three cycle tests for these two catalysts. It can be revealed that the deactivation of the catalysts is associated with deposition of coke and the subsequent block of the active sites. The coke species can be combusted in the presence of air, resulting in the recovery of catalytic activity toward the propane dehydrogenation reaction.

In this work, porous and well-mixed GaxAl2–xO3 metal oxides were generated from thermal treatment of bimetallic MIL-53(Ga, Al) precursors at 550–650 °C. Highly dispersed Pt and Ga species are present in the catalysts prepared by wetness impregnation of Pt on Ga0.1Al1.9O3 and Ga0.5Al1.5O3. The synergy between highly dispersed Pt and tetrahedral GaIV active species in Pt/Ga0.1Al1.9O3 and Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3 catalysts renders their prominent reactivity and recyclability toward propane dehydrogenation reaction. In the past decade, numerous highly efficient catalysts including PtSn@MFI, PtIn/Mg(Al)O, PtSn/SiO2, VOx/SiO2, and CrOx/H-ZSM-5 (80−88) have been successfully fabricated to improve the catalytic performances of nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction including propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and catalyst lifetime. Our current work supplies a new strategy for the catalytic propane dehydrogenation reaction using bimetallic MOFs derived porous mixed metal oxides.
4. Conclusion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Porous mixed metal oxides GaxAl2–xO3 (x = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) were obtained by thermal treatment of bimetallic MIL-53(Ga, Al) precursors in air atmosphere and high temperatures. The Pt/GaxAl2–xO3 catalysts were prepared by loading Pt on GaxAl2–xO3 via a wetness impregnation approach. Spectroscopic methods including XRD, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, TEM, and solid-state NMR were employed to characterize the physicochemical properties of these MIL-53(Ga, Al) derivatives. Based on the textural analysis, the GaxAl2–xO3 (x = 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5) catalysts possess mesoporous features and moderate surface area. It is revealed Ga and Pt species are highly dispersed in Pt/Ga0.1Al1.9O3 and Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3 catalysts according to the analysis of XRD patterns and elemental mapping. Thermal treatment of bimetallic MIL-53(Ga, Al) with high Ga contents results in the formation of Ga2O3 particles. According to double-resonance MAS NMR measurements, the mixing of Al and Ga species in calcined metal oxides is identified. Moreover, the coordination states and the relative amounts of Al and Ga species in MIL-53(Ga, Al) derivatives are quantitatively determined from 27Al and 71Ga MAS NMR spectra. The Pt active species is readily anchored with pentacoordinate Al and promotes the formation of tetrahedral GaIV species in Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3 catalyst. The excellent reactivity and recyclability toward the propane dehydrogenation reaction on Pt/Ga0.1Al1.9O3 and Pt/Ga0.5Al1.5O3 catalysts is mainly attributed to the synergy between highly dispersed Pt and tetrahedral GaIV active species in the sample.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
