Based on the multiple document extracts provided, none of them seem relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation research. All the extracts discuss CO2 capture using various amine-grafted hollow fiber sorbents, with no mention of converting propane to propylene or any details related to propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Since there is no pertinent information related to propane dehydrogenation, I have indicated "No" relevance and left the rest of the XML structure blank. Please provide relevant document extracts containing details of propane dehydrogenation catalysts, process conditions, and performance to populate the XML output structure.
