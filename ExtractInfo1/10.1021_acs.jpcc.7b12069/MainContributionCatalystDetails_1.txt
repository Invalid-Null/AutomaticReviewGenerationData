The provided document discusses the use of a silica-supported vanadium oxo organometallic complex (VCAT) as a catalyst for propene hydrogenation and propane dehydrogenation reactions in the presence of parahydrogen. While it examines these catalytic reactions, the document does not specifically pertain to propane dehydrogenation for the conversion of propane to propylene. The focus is on observing parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) effects to gain mechanistic insights into the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions, rather than optimizing conversion, selectivity, or other performance metrics for PDH or ODH processes. Since the document does not relate to PDH or ODH for propane to propylene conversion, I have indicated "No" for relevance and did not include the <IfRelated> section.
