Roles of niobium in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over a Pt/Nb-modified Al2O3 catalyst†
The application of Pt-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is restricted by low propylene selectivity, metal sintering and carbon deposition. It has been reported that the performance of catalysts is strongly related to the electronic and geometric properties of the Pt particles and the acidity of the support. Herein, we report that a niobium-modified alumina supported platinum catalyst exhibits high propylene selectivity and superior stability. A high conversion of 28.8% and a high propylene selectivity above 96% are achieved over the Pt/Nb1Al2-O catalyst for propane dehydrogenation at 600 °C after 8 h in a fixed bed reactor. Consecutive dehydrogenation–regeneration operations showed that the stability of Pt/Nb1Al2-O was much higher than that of Pt/Al2O3. NH3-TPD revealed that the strong acidity is decreased, while the medium acidity is increased after introducing niobium into Al2O3, which may be attributed to the formation of new acid sites, probably Lewis acid sites from niobium oxide species. CO-adsorbed FTIR spectroscopy, CO chemisorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) results revealed the enhancement of electron density and the decrease of dispersion of Pt particles after the introduction of Nb, which is beneficial for inhibiting the by-reactions (carbon formation and C–C bond cleavage).
1. Introduction
As mining shale gas technology matures, many efforts have been dedicated to finding efficient catalysts for propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH).1–8 However, the PDH reaction is highly endothermic and a high reaction temperature is essential, which results in the major challenges of undesired reactions, such as hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation.9,10 Compared with other noble metals, Pt is the only noble metal utilized in the commercial PDH process due to its superior activity in C–H bond activation and low activity for C–C bond cleavage.11,12 However, the selectivity to propylene still needs to be enhanced and coke formation as well as sintering of Pt particles needs to be prevented.13–16 It was found that the electronic state and geometric properties of Pt have an effect on the reaction.9,12 The higher electron density of Pt is beneficial for weakening the adsorption of olefins, thereby reducing coke formation. A small particle size of Pt favors the dehydrogenation reaction, but it is also beneficial to some undesired side reactions, such as cracking of C–C bonds, isomerization, and coke formation.17 So, there is still no general consensus regarding the suitable dispersion and particle size of platinum for the PDH process. It was reported that the dispersion and stability of Pt particles are closely related to the support,18,19 and in addition, the acidity of the support also influences the performance, because a higher acidity will lead to serious coke formation.20,21
Alumina is widely used as the carrier in Pt-based catalysts in the PDH reaction due to its high thermal stability and large surface area.19,22 However, unsatisfactory catalytic performance was achieved over the sole Pt/Al2O3 catalyst because of the catalyst acidity of Al2O3 and metal sintering. In order to reduce support acidity and suppress the sintering of Pt particles, Sn, In, Cu and alkaline metals (Li, Na, and K) have been introduced as auxiliary agents into Pt/Al2O3 and a higher catalytic stability was achieved over these catalysts.21,23,24 So, suitable promoters are necessary for the traditional Pt/Al2O3 to achieve excellent catalytic performance.
Nb-containing catalysts show excellent performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes.25–28 For example, Lemonidou et al. developed a kind of Ni–Nb–O oxide catalyst that is highly active and selective in ODH.26 MoVTeNbO catalysts, prepared by López Nieto et al., showed high selectivity in the ODH of ethane.27 Lewis acidity was proven to be beneficial for the dehydrogenation of isobutane via promoting C–H activation and accelerating H2 desorption, thus leading to an improved reactivity.29,30 So, we propose that the Nb-containing catalysts, which were reported to be catalysts with high Lewis acidity,31 should be a promising candidate for achieving good performance in the PDH process.
In this work, niobium was introduced into the traditional Pt/Al2O3 catalyst in two steps. First, NbAl-O supports with different Nb/Al ratios were synthesized by a co-precipitation method, and then Pt/NbAl-O catalysts were prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation method. It was found that the selectivity to C3H6 was improved greatly after introducing Nb into Al2O3. After systematic characterization, we found that, compared with Pt/Al2O3, the Pt/NbxAly-O catalysts have a higher Pt electron density and a smaller amount of low-coordinated Pt, which could reduce coke formation, weaken the deep C–C bond cracking and enhance the catalyst stability. In addition, the decrease of the strong acidity of the catalyst also inhibits carbon deposition.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and methods
Materials Propane, C3H8 (99.9%) was obtained from Shanghai Chunyu Special Gas Co., Ltd. Ammonium niobate(v) oxalate hydrate was bought from Dibo Reagent Co., Ltd. Aluminum nitrate nonhydrate was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Pt(NO3)2 was bought from Heraeus Materials Technology Shanghai Co., Ltd. NaOH was obtained from Shanghai Titan Scientific Co., Ltd. All chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification. Synthesis of Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/NbAl-O catalysts The supports were prepared by a precipitation method. In a typical synthesis, Ammonium niobate(v) oxalate hydrate and Al(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in 50 mL of water, respectively. Then, the solutions of aluminum nitrate and ammonium niobium oxalate were simultaneously dropped into a 250 mL beaker and the system was heated in a 70 °C oil bath. The pH of the system was maintained at 7 by continuously dropwise adding an aqueous solution of NaOH. After stirring and heating for 1 h, the solid formed was filtered, washed with distilled water and dried at 50 °C for 12 h and 100 °C for 12 h, respectively. After calcining at 600 °C, the NbxAly-O supports were obtained, where x/y indicates the mass ratio of Nb/Al.
The γ-Al2O3 support was prepared in the same way by using Al(NO3)3·9H2O as the only precursor.
An incipient wetness impregnation method was adopted for catalyst preparation. In a typical case, a certain amount of deionized water was added to 0.4 mL of an aqueous solution of Pt(NO3)2 (0.025 g mL−1 Pt). Subsequently, 1 g of the support was added to the above solution and stirred to obtain the precursor. The Pt-based samples were obtained after drying (50 °C for 12 h, and 100 °C for 12 h) and further calcination at 450 °C for 5 h in air.
Material characterization Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a D8 Focus diffractometer using Cu Kα1 (λ = 0.15406 nm) radiation. The operation conditions were 40 kV and 40 mA.
Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) characterization was performed using a ThermoFisher Talos F200X. High angle annular dark field (HAADF)-STEM images were recorded using a convergence semi-angle of 11 mrad, and inner- and outer collection angles of 59 and 200 mrad, respectively.
Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was used to determine the Pt, Nb and Al contents by using an Agilent 725ES. A Micromeritics ASAP 2020 M sorption analyzer was used for the nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements. Before measuring at −196 °C, the samples were degassed at 200 °C for 6 h. The specific surface area was calculated based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation. CO chemisorption was performed on a Huasi DAS-7200 automatic chemisorption system at room temperature (CO : Pt = 1 : 1).
H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was conducted on a Huasi DAS-7200 automatic chemisorption system. Before each measurement, to remove the physically adsorbed species on the surface of the catalyst, the samples were pretreated by using pure Ar at 150 °C for 1 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the samples were heated to 800 °C with a 10 °C min−1 ramp in 10% H2/Ar flow.
NH3-TPD was carried out using an instrument (PX200, Tianjin Golden Eagle Technology Co. Ltd) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The detailed experimental procedures are described in our previous work25 except herein the weight of the samples was changed from 100 mg to 200 mg.
Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of CO-adsorption was performed on a Nicolet Model iS-50 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with an MCT/A detector. For all of the CO-adsorption DRIFTS measurements, the catalyst was reduced in situ in a flow of 5% H2/Ar at 600 °C and then flushed in Ar flow for 10 min at 600 °C, followed by cooling to 25 °C. Then, a flow of CO (30 mL min−1) was introduced into the catalyst cell, and the DRIFTS spectra were collected.
X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250 Xi system with Al Kα radiation operated at 250 W. The C 1s level at 284.6 eV as an internal standard was used to calibrate the binding energy. X-Ray adsorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements were conducted at the beamline 44A of Taiwan Photon Source, National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center in Taiwan. XAFS measurements were conducted for the Pt L3-edge in fluorescence mode. Before the measurements of XPS and XANS, the samples were reduced at 600 °C for 1 h under 5% H2/Ar, cooled down to room temperature, then purged with N2 for 1 h, and finally transferred to bottles and sealed in a glove box for use.
The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra were measured at −196 °C by using a Bruker A300 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG/DTA) was performed on a PerkinElmer Pyris Diamond in air with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
C3H6-TPD was carried out on a Huasi DAS-7200 automatic chemisorption system with MS to determine the desorption energy of C3H6. Prior to C3H6 adsorption, the sample (0.2 g) was reduced with 5% H2/Ar at 600 °C for 1 h, and C3H6 (99.5%) was adsorbed for 1 h after cooling to 50 °C. After purging He (30 mL min−1) for 2 h, the temperature was ramped up to 800 °C with a rate of 10 °C min−1.
Catalytic reactions The PDH reaction was conducted in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor with a 6 mm inner diameter. Prior to the test, 0.11 g of catalyst with 40–60 mesh was in situ activated at 600 °C for 1 h with H2 (H2/N2 = 1 : 4) under atmospheric pressure. After reduction, the reactant gas mixture (C3H8/H2/N2 = 1 : 1 : 3) was introduced through the catalytic bed at 30 mL min−1 and the propane weight hourly space velocity (WHSV (C3H8), grams of propane fed per gram of catalyst per hour) was 6 h−1. The PDH process was conducted at 600 °C under atmospheric pressure, and the reactor effluent was separated in a phase separator and analyzed by online gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The blank experiment was performed by running reactions at normal temperature, and the influence could be neglected. The conversion of propane (C3H8) and selectivity to the products (CxHy: C3H6, C2H6, C2H4, and CH4) were calculated using the following equations:

3. Results
XRD was used to analyze the phase composition of the samples with different Nb contents, and the results are shown in Fig. 1. It was found that Al2O3 shows broad peaks at 39.5°, 45.8°, 66.8° and 85.0°, assigned to the γ-Al2O3 phase (PDF No. 29-0063), while Nb2O5 shows diffraction peaks centered at 22.6°, 28.4°, 36.6°, 46.1° and 55.1°, which correspond to the TT-Nb2O5 (pseudohexagonal Nb2O5) phase (PDF no. 30-0873). Interestingly, the NbAl-O samples show amorphous phases except Nb1Al8-O, which is similar to the γ-Al2O3 phase. The absence of the diffractions of γ-Al2O3 and TT-Nb2O5 suggests that the coordination and crystallinity of the oxides were changed after mixing Nb and Al together. After loading with Pt, the XRD patterns were also recorded and they are presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The diffraction peaks of Pt can hardly be seen in Fig. S1 (ESI†), indicating that very small Pt particles are dispersed on all supports.
Fig. 1 XRD patterns of various supports.
The composition of various catalysts was measured by ICP and the data are collected in Table 1. It shows that the mass ratio of elements of the resultant catalysts is in line with the initial composition. N2 adsorption was used to measure the surface area and the results are also summarized in Table 1. It shows that the specific surface area first increases and then decreases. For Pt/Nb1Al2-O, the specific surface area is 157 m2 g−1.

a d means the particle size of Pt estimated from its dispersion. The calculation formula is d (nm) = 1.13/dispersion.
HAADF-STEM imaging was utilized to investigate the Pt particle size and dispersion of the two representative catalysts. As shown in Fig. 2, tiny Pt nanoparticles showing a high Z-contrast were observed on the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Nb1Al2-O samples, indicating the high dispersion of Pt particles in these two catalysts. The average size of Pt particles of Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Nb1Al2-O is 1.30 nm and 1.50 nm, respectively. To measure the Pt dispersion, CO-pulse adsorption was employed and the results are also collected in Table 1. It was found that the dispersion of Pt on the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was 68.4%, while it is 54.7% over the Pt/Nb1Al2-O catalyst.

The reduction of the supported Pt catalysts, as well as the interaction of Pt with the support was examined by using the H2-TPR technique, and the results are presented in Fig. 3. It can be seen that two reduction peaks appeared for all catalysts. The first one appears between 200 and 300 °C, while the latter exists between 350 and 450 °C. These two peaks are assigned to (i) the reduction of weakly interacting Pt species, and (ii) the reduction of Pt species that interacted strongly with the alumina support.32–35 Both peaks slightly shift to a higher temperature with increasing Nb content, suggesting that the interaction was enhanced after introducing niobium, which would help to curb the sintering of Pt particles and improve the catalyst stability.

The PDH reaction was carried out at 600 °C in a fixed reactor and the results for the above catalysts are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. S2 (ESI†). Fig. 4a shows the time-on-stream of the propane conversion over different catalysts. The highest conversion was achieved over the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, being around 32% after 8 h. However, a low selectivity (<80%) to C3H6 and poor stability were observed for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 4b). It has been reported that a smaller particle size of Pt and a higher metal dispersion favor the dehydrogenation reaction, but they are also beneficial to some undesired side reactions, such as the cracking of C–C bonds and coke formation. In addition, the strong acidity of Al2O3 would also lead to coke formation; this will be discussed later. Hence, a high C3H8 conversion but low C3H6 selectivity was achieved over the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. For Nb-containing catalysts, although the conversion decreases with the increase of Nb content, the selectivity is higher and reached 96% over the Pt/Nb1Al2-O catalyst. So, we finally chose Pt/Nb1Al2-O as the best catalyst, because of its high stability (deactivation rate parameter, κd = 0.0520), higher conversion (28.8%) and highest selectivity (96.0%) (Table S1, ESI†). The following characterization discussions also focused on the Pt/Nb1Al2-O and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. The selectivity to by-products (CH4, C2H6 and C2H4) given in Fig. S3 (ESI†) shows that C–C bond cleavage is greatly reduced (CH4 yield was reduced from 10% over Pt/Al2O3 to 3% over Pt/Nb1Al2-O) after the introduction of Nb. The catalytic performance during consecutive dehydrogenation–regeneration operations over Pt/Nb1Al2-O and Pt/Al2O3 catalysts was also studied and the results are presented in Fig. 5. It was found that the activities of both decreased, but compared with Pt/Al2O3, better catalytic stability and higher C3H6 selectivity were still obtained over the Pt/Nb1Al2-O catalyst. The characterization performed on the spent catalyst (Fig. S4–S7, ESI†) indicated particle sintering for both Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Nb1Al2-O. During the reaction, the Pt particles of Pt/Al2O3 gradually form aggregates of 8.65 nm (after 1 reaction cycle) and 12.17 nm (after 3 reaction cycles), which explains the decrease of C3H8 conversion and increase of C3H6 selectivity over Pt/Al2O3. For Pt/Nb1Al2-O, the Pt particle sizes are 7.70 nm and 9.53 nm after 1 reaction cycle and 3 cycles, respectively. The slower particle aggregation means that the particle stability is improved by introducing Nb. However, the anti-sintering ability of Pt/NbAl-O still required strengthening by adding other promoters.

After each PDH run, the catalyst was regenerated by burning coke at 600 °C in flowing air for 2 h and then by H2 reduction at 600 °C for 1 h.
4. Discussion
It was reported that besides the properties of Pt, the acidity of the catalyst also influences the catalytic performance, so the influence of acidity is first discussed. NH3-TPD was carried out to measure the number and distribution of acidic sites, which are shown in Fig. 6. It is well known that the peaks of NH3 desorption at around 120–200 °C, 200–300 °C and above 300 °C are regarded as representing weak, medium, and strong acid sites, respectively.36 The NH3-TPD profiles in Fig. 6 and the calculated number of each type of acid site listed in Table S2 (ESI†) both show that the number of strong acid sites decreases, while the number of medium acid sites increases significantly after introducing Nb into Al2O3. The increased medium acid sites are Lewis acid sites coming from NbOx species, as shown in the Py-FTIR spectra (Fig. S8, ESI†). It is well accepted that the strong acid sites of a catalyst can promote the formation of coke.5,12 The conversion of propane is higher over the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, which is due to the deep cracking to smaller molecules and the coke formation, while the fewer strong acid sites and more medium acid sites of Pt/Nb1Al2-O are beneficial for C–H activation, but detrimental for carbon deposition and C–C bond cracking, thus improving the selectivity to propylene and enhancing the catalytic stability.
Fig. 6 NH3-TPD profiles of Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Nb1Al2-O catalysts.
To further compare the carbon deposits on the two catalysts, TG was used to analyze the amount of coke formed after PDH reaction at 600 °C for 8 h (shown in Fig. S10, ESI†), and less weight loss was observed for Pt/Nb1Al2-O (13.8 wt%) than that of Pt/Al2O3 (17.9 wt%), indicating that doping of niobium in Al2O3 really suppressed coke deposition.
The properties of Pt nanoparticles play key roles in PDH, so CO-adsorbed FTIR spectroscopy was used to investigate their coordinated states. The DRIFTS spectra for CO adsorption on these three catalysts (Pt/Al2O3, Pt/Nb1Al2-O and Pt/Nb2O5) are given in Fig. 7 and Fig. S11 (ESI†), respectively. It can be seen that CO adsorption peaks are present at 2000–2100 cm−1 for all three catalysts, which can be attributed to CO species linearly absorbed on the Pt atoms. According to the previous literature, the little peaks of both catalysts at around 2080 cm−1 can be attributed to very highly coordinated Pt sites, which are reported to be unfavorable for the dehydrogenation reaction.12,37 For Pt/Nb2O5, it could be seen that there is a very high number of highly coordinated Pt sites, which are reported to be unfavorable for the dehydrogenation reaction and the by-reactions (cracking of C–C bond, isomerization, and coke formation), so even though the selectivity to propylene is high, the conversion is very low. To compare the differences between Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Nb1Al2-O catalysts, the linearly adsorbed CO curves were fitted and separated into four peaks. (1) CO adsorption on very highly coordinated Pt sites at some low index plane. (2) CO adsorption on high index planes of small clusters. (3) and (4) CO adsorption on low coordinated Pt sites, such as steps, edges, corners and defect sites.9,38,39 It could be found that after introducing Nb into the support, peak 4 (low coordinated Pt sites) decreased from 26.6% to 14.7% as the amount of peak 2 (high index planes of small clusters) increased. DFT calculations by Yang et al. indicated that low coordinated Pt favors hydrogenolysis and its side reactions (coke formation and hydrocarbon cracking).37 These results mean that the doping of niobium decreased the amount of low coordinated Pt and prevented hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation.

Besides the support acidity and coordination state of Pt, previous reports revealed that the electron density of Pt-based catalysts is key for the PDH process.9,36 To clarify the difference of the surface states of Pt after introducing Nb, XPS analysis was performed, but the signals of Al 2p and Pt 4f are overlapped (Fig. S12 and S13, ESI† and discussed therein). So, XAS spectra were used to identify the chemical states of Pt. Fig. 8 shows the normalized X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra at the Pt L3-edge for the catalysts and the reference spectra of Pt foil and PtO2 powder. It can be seen that the intensities of Pt in the catalysts are all slightly higher than that of Pt foil, which may be due to the slight oxidation of the samples. Compared with Pt/Al2O3, the intensities of Pt on Nb1Al2-O are lower, which means a higher electron density. This indicates that the NbAl-O support donates electrons to Pt, which may be due to an increased number of oxygen vacancies (Ov) formed with the introduction of niobium. Therefore, EPR measurements were employed to explore the Ov of the catalysts, and the results are shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†). For these two catalysts, there is an obvious signal with a g value of 2.003, which is attributed to the single electron of the O2− radical trapped by Ov.40,41 The existence of Nb facilitated the generation of Ov, which transfer electrons to Pt and also generate more Lewis acid sites, finally enhancing propylene selectivity and preventing coke formation.

In order to compare the adsorption strength of the catalysts to propylene, the adsorption of propylene on the catalysts was examined by means of C3H6-TPD, and the desorption profiles are presented in Fig. 9. The MS signal of TPD measurements shows that the propylene adsorbed on both Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Nb1Al2-O can desorb at a relatively low temperature. But obviously, the desorption of C3H6 from the Pt/Nb1Al2-O catalyst shifts to a lower temperature compared with that of Pt/Al2O3, which decreased from 99 °C to 80 °C. More interestingly, the peak area of C3H6 desorption reduced a lot for Pt/Nb1Al2-O, suggesting weaker C3H6 adsorption. The TPD characterization results are in line with the TG results. Weaker interaction between the catalysts and C3H6 leads to less coke formation and higher catalyst stability.
Fig. 9 C3H6-TPD of Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/Nb1Al2-O catalysts.
Based on the above results and discussion, we found that compared with Pt/Al2O3, the decrease of strong acidity and low coordinated Pt is beneficial for preventing the formation of coke and hydrocarbon cracking. In addition, the higher electron density of Pt over Pt/NbxAly-O weakens the interaction between C3H6 and Pt, which also lessens the formation of coke.
5. Conclusion
In summary, we prepared a novel catalyst by introducing Nb into the traditional Al2O3 support for the PDH reaction, in which the C3H8 conversion and the C3H6 selectivity reached 28.8% and 96.0% after 8 h, respectively. The function of Nb was investigated and it was found to play key roles in tuning the support acidity and Pt state. NH3-TPD results show a reduction of strong acidity, which favors the stability of the catalyst by lessening the coke formation. CO-pulse adsorption and DRIFTS for CO adsorption results proved the decrease of Pt dispersion and low coordinated Pt sites, which helped to avoid C–C bond cleavage (formation of CH4, C2H6) and enhance propylene selectivity. The increase of electron density of the Pt particles, which was proven by XPS and XANES, can weaken the ability to adsorb propylene and also prevent coke formation. Moreover, the fast sintering of Pt was also reduced after Nb modification. It is believed that these findings possess potential for the further design of high selectivity and stability catalysts for the PDH process.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
