Based on the multiple document analyses provided, it appears these documents are not relevant to propane dehydrogenation research. The documents focus on titanium hydride catalysts supported on various metal oxides for applications like alkene epoxidation, wax hydrogenolysis, and ethylene polymerization. None of the documents discuss the use of these catalysts for propane dehydrogenation specifically. Therefore, I have indicated that these documents are not relevant and have not provided any additional synthesized details.
