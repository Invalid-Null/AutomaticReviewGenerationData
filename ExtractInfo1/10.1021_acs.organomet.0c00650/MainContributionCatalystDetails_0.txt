The provided document does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). It focuses on the preparation and characterization of titanium hydride species supported on various metal oxides (silica, silica-alumina, alumina) and evaluates their catalytic activity for 1-octene epoxidation, Fischer-Tropsch wax hydrogenolysis, and ethylene polymerization reactions. No data or discussion related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is presented.
