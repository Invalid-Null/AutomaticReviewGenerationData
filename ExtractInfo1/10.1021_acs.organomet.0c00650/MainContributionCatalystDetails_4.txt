The document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on the preparation and characterization of titanium hydride catalysts supported on different oxides like silica, silica-alumina and alumina. While it evaluates the performance of these catalysts in epoxidation, wax hydrogenolysis and ethylene polymerization reactions, it does not cover their use in propane dehydrogenation specifically.
