Separation of propylene/propane mixtures by titanosilicate ETS-10 membranes prepared in one-step seeded hydrothermal synthesis
Abstract
Titanosilicate ETS-10 membranes were prepared by one-step seeded hydrothermal synthesis using titanium tetrabutoxide as the Ti source and fluoride ions onto α-alumina tubular supports. The membranes were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, temperature-programmed permeation (to measure the single gas permeances of propylene and propane), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and separation experiments. The duration of the hydrothermal synthesis had a strong effect both on membrane reproducibility and membrane performance measured at 30 °C and 100 kPa in terms of propylene permeance and propylene/propane selectivity. All of the ETS-10 membranes prepared in 8-h syntheses showed propylene/propane selectivities higher than 4, with average values of selectivity and propylene permeance of 5.5 and 7.9 × 10−8 mol/(m2 s Pa), respectively. On the other hand, after 15 days on stream, the ETS-10 membranes lost part of their capability to separate propylene/propane mixtures. However, the propylene/propane separation could be restored by thermal treatment in air at 350 °C. XPS analysis indicated that the decline in separation performance was due to carbonaceous species strongly adsorbed on the ETS-10 membrane surface.
1. Introduction
The synthesis of ETS-4 and ETS-10 titanosilicates was first reported by Kuznicki at Engelhard Corporation [1]. In particular, the structure of ETS-10 comprises corner-sharing SiO4 tetrahedra and TiO6 octahedra linked through bridging oxygen atoms giving rise to a three-dimensional 12-ring pore system with excellent diffusion characteristics [1] with the ideal formula (Na, K)2Si5TiO13·xH2O. These titanosilicates and other mixed octahedral–pentahedral–tetrahedral framework oxides have potential application in the fields of catalysis, sorption, ion exchange, optical devices and magnetic materials [1]. These applications can be complemented with their use as membranes or films.
A few reports are available on the preparation of microporous titanosilicates membranes or films. ETS-4 membranes have been prepared [2], [3], [4], [5] and used for dehydration of water/ethanol mixtures by pervaporation [2] and gas separation of nitrogen from its mixture with oxygen, argon, methane and carbon dioxide [3]. Microporous titanosilicates and stannosilicates both with structures similar to mineral umbite have been prepared as continuous layers and were able to separate H2 from N2, CO2, and propane with high selectivity [6].
ETS-10 membranes were first grown heteroepitaxially on titanosilicate ETS-4 layers [7]. Later, ETS-10 membranes were synthesized by seeded hydrothermal synthesis and used for the dehydration by pervaporation of water/alcohol [8], [9] and water/acid acetic [9] mixtures, and for the gas phase separation of propylene/propane mixtures [10]. Also, AM-6 vanadosilicate (isomorphous structure of ETS-10, replacing titanium by vanadium) membranes have been prepared and tested in the propylene/propane gas separation [10]. Recently, ETS-10 films have been synthesized on fused silica optical fibers [11] and on dense α-alumina and stainless steel followed by ion exchange with Eu3+ for use on photoluminescent devices [12].
Propylene is one of the most important raw materials in the petrochemical industry, with applications in the synthesis of a wide variety of products (for example, polymers and propylene oxide). The usual processes to obtain propylene (such as naphtha cracking and propane dehydrogenation) give rise to propylene/propane mixtures. Distillation, considered a costly energy process, has often been used to separate these mixtures; due to its low relative volatility, a high number of stages and a high reflux ratio are needed increasing also the cost. This has led to the proposal of alternative technologies (e.g. adsorption). Membrane separation is an interesting alternative for alkenes/alkanes separations on account of a potentially high selectivity and low energy consumption. Polymeric membranes have been used for this purpose [13], but they have strong limitations in terms of mechanical and chemical stability [14]. On the other hand, inorganic membranes have a much wider range of operation, and therefore constitute suitable candidates for processes in which chemical environment and mechanical restrictions prevent the use of polymeric membranes. However, up to now the studies concerning the use of inorganic membranes to separate propylene/propane mixtures are rather scarce [14], and involve alumina–silica microporous membranes [15], zeolite membranes [16], [17], carbon membranes [18], [19], [20] and mesoporous alumina or microporous silica membranes modified with Ag [14]. Different investigations have found that ETS-10 is capable of adsorbing alkenes with preference to alkanes. This is the case of ethylene–ethane [21] and propane–propylene [22] systems. Consequently, membranes with a separation layer of ETS-10 could also be candidates to separate propylene–propane mixtures.
In previous works [8], [10], we have reported the preparation of ETS-10 membranes with a viscous gel based on the original patent of Kuznicki [1], using TiCl3 as the Ti source. Permeation test carried out on these membranes suggested that the ETS-10 membranes needed two-step seeded synthesis to be useful for propylene/propane separation [10]. In this work, we have prepared ETS-10 membranes in a single-step seeded synthesis by means of a lower viscosity gel based on the use of titanium tetrabutoxide as the Ti source and with fluoride instead of chloride ions. The obtained ETS-10 membranes have been characterized (SEM, XRD and XPS) and tested in the separation of the propylene/propane mixture under different operating conditions.
2. Experimental
ETS-10 membranes were prepared on commercial α-alumina tubular symmetric supports (Inocermic GmbH) with 1900 nm pore size, by seeded hydrothermal synthesis using Teflon-lined autoclaves with a volume of 160 mL. The internal and external diameters of the tubes were 7 and 10 mm, respectively, with 8 cm length of which 5 cm were permeable.
Before hydrothermal synthesis, the outside of the supports was seeded by rubbing ETS-10 seeds. These seeds had a particle size of approximately 500 nm (measured by SEM and photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), Malvern Zetasizer 3000 HS), and were synthesized according to the procedure given by Rocha et al. [23]. For the synthesis of the membranes a gel was prepared following a procedure previously reported [2], [9]. In a typical synthesis, 3.8 g of titanium(IV) butoxide (99%, Aldrich) was added into a solution with 2.64 g of KF (99%, Aldrich), 4.54 g NaOH (Merck) and 116.03 g of distilled water. To this mixture 7.71 g of H2O2 solution (30 wt.%, Riedel-de Haen) and 25.22 g of Na silicate solution (27 wt.% SiO2, 8 wt.% Na2O, Merck) were consecutively added, always under vigorous stirring. The final ETS-10 gel had the following molar composition: 10 NaOH:4 KF:TiO2:10 SiO2:675 H2O. Hydrofluoric acid (48 wt.% in water, Merck) was added to adjust the pH to 10.4. pH measurement was always performed with gel diluted 100 times with water. This pH value was chosen because preliminary synthesis experiments with powder showed that highly crystalline and pure ETS-10 could be obtained with 12–24 h of synthesis time. At higher pH 10.8, the main product was ETS-4 and AM-3 (with structure similar to mineral penkvilksite) instead of ETS-10. At lower pH 10.3, the product was ETS-10 with quartz impurity. These results are in agreement with other pH studies in ETS-10 synthesis [23], [24]. The inner side of the 8 cm long tubes was not seeded and before the introduction of the seeded support in the autoclave both ends were plugged with Teflon caps to avoid crystal growth in the inner region. Hydrothermal synthesis was carried out at 230 °C for different times (8–48 h). Quenching the autoclave in running water terminated the synthesis. Membranes were washed with boiling distilled water and dried at 100 °C.
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Rigaku/Max diffractometer using filtered Cu Kα radiation. The samples were also examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in a JEOL JSM-6400 instrument operating at 3–20 kV. Temperature-programmed permeation (TPP) experiments were run to gather valuable information on the membrane permeation regimes. The membrane was placed in a stainless steel cylindrical membrane module where it was sealed with silicone o-rings, and TPP system (described in [25]) was employed to measure single gas permeances of propylene and propane. Before running TPP experiments, the membranes were heated in nitrogen gas to 230 °C to remove any adsorbed species, then consecutively propane and propylene single gas permeance measurements were performed.
Mixture permeation tests were carried out in similar membrane module to that used for TPP experiments. Different propylene/propane mixture compositions were fed to the outside of the membrane. The gas permeating through the membrane was swept by a He stream fed to the inner side. All the streams were mass flow controlled (Bronkhorst Hi-Tec). The concentrations of permeate and retentate streams were determined using on-line gas chromatography (HP 5890 SERIES II equipped with TCD and FID using a Phase 23% SP-1700 Support PAW 80/100 column). The membrane permeance was defined as moles of gas permeated per unit time and unit membrane area, divided by the logarithm mean of partial pressure difference between the retentate and permeate sides. The propylene/propane selectivity was calculated dividing propylene permeance by propane permeance.
X-ray photoelectron analysis (XPS) was performed with an Axis Ultra DLD (Kratos Tech.). The samples were mounted on a sample rod placed in the pre-treatment chamber of the spectrometer and then evacuated at room temperature. The spectra were excited by the monochromatized Al Kα source (1486.6 eV) at 15 kV and 10 mA. A pass energy of 20 eV was used for the individual peak regions. Survey spectrum was measured at 160 eV pass energy. Ar+ ion beam etching was performed with an ionization gun operating at incident energy of 5 kV and current of 20 mA. Analyses of the peaks were performed with the software provided by the manufacturer, using a weighted sum of Lorentzian and Gaussian components curves after background subtraction. The binding energies were referenced to the internal standard C 1s (284.9 eV).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization by XRD, SEM and TPP
Table 1 shows weight gain (mg of zeolite/g of support), propylene and propane permeances and propylene/propane selectivity for all the membranes prepared in this work, whereas Table 2 gives the same values averaged for each group of membranes prepared using the same synthesis time. Permeances will be discussed later. Between 8 and 12 h of synthesis time, the weight gain is the same within the margin of error. For longer times, the weight gain increases with synthesis time, as expected. Fig. 1 displays the XRD patterns of ETS-10 membranes prepared with different synthesis times. These patterns were obtained by analyzing directly the outer surface of the membrane. In addition to the peaks at 2θ equal to 25.6°, 35.2° and 37.8° corresponding to the alumina support, for all the analyzed membranes, the XRD data show that ETS-10 was the only crystalline phase obtained after 8 h of synthesis time. However, reflections at 21° and 26.8° corresponding to quartz could be clearly observed after 24 h and their intensity increased after 48 h of hydrothermal treatment. This impurity has been previously reported in the preparation of ETS-10 powder [23] and has been related to the presence of F− ions which could catalyze the polymerization of silicate species resulting in the formation of quartz [24]. The indexing (h k l) of ETS-10 reflections by Anderson et al. [26] with two polymorphs (A and B) is used in the following discussion. The intensity ratio of peaks is quite similar in the powder and membrane, except peak at ca. 2θ = 13° (which corresponds to (0 0 4) or to (0 0 2) for polymorphs A and B, respectively) is not detected for the ETS-10 membrane (inset of Fig. 1) and peak intensity at 6° 2θ (which corresponds to (1 0 0) or to (1 1 0) for polymorphs A and B, respectively) increases for the ETS-10 membrane.

Fig. 2 shows SEM images of membranes prepared with different synthesis time (membranes M13, M7 and M1, 8, 24 and 48 h, respectively). The top and cross-section views of membranes confirm the existence of a continuous layer of well-intergrown crystals. The crystal size observed on the surface layer is uniform for each membrane and increases clearly with synthesis time from 3–5 μm (8 h) to 6–7 μm (24 h) and to 7–8 μm (48 h). For all the membranes, the thickness is approximately 7–9 μm and is not possible to identify a trend of thickness variation with synthesis time. The cross-section of membrane M1 (Fig. 2f, 48-h synthesis) shows a comparatively denser layer related to the longer synthesis of this membrane, also SEM pictures (not showed) have shown a higher quantity of ETS-10 crystals inside the pores of the alumina support in 48-h syntheses than with lower synthesis time. All the three membranes in Fig. 2 possess a uniform crystal morphology corresponding to ETS-10: a truncated bi-pyramid morphology, where the a and b directions are the linear dimensions of the square basal plane shared by the two pyramids and the c direction is perpendicular to this square basal plane [11]. Comparison of the crystal morphology observed for the crystals in the membrane surface and the typical morphology of ETS-10 crystals suggests some degree of preferential crystallographical orientation with c parallel to the support in agreement with XRD results; this orientation has been previously observed in SEM analysis by Lin et al. [8], [12] on ETS-10 films synthesized on dense alumina supports.

Fig. 3 shows the TPP analysis of propane and propylene obtained with membrane M5. As expected for a microporous membrane, both propane and propylene permeances increase with increasing temperatures. At 40 °C, the ideal propylene/propane selectivity is 2.9. In the 40–150 °C temperature range, the increase of propane permeance is higher than that of propylene, and the ideal selectivity decreases to 0.9. At higher temperatures there is a slight increase in the ideal selectivity. Depending on temperature, the increase of permeances with temperature can be related to either adsorption of the organic compound (the permeance increases because the increase in temperature enhances the mobility of adsorbed species even though the amount of physically adsorbed material starts to decrease) or to activated diffusion through micropores (Arrhenius-like dependency of activated transport through micropores). In the case of the most studied silicalite-1 zeolite membranes [25] adsorption mechanism produces a maximum with temperature that usually correlates with the adsorption strength of the hydrocarbon on the zeolite. In our ETS-10 membranes such a maximum should appear in experiments at higher temperatures. However, due to the catalytic character of ETS-10 [1], higher temperatures would give rise to reactions (decomposition and/or oligomerization), whose products could block the membrane pores (as will be shown later) distorting the experimental permeation trends.

3.2. Propylene/propane separation
As shown in Table 1, Table 2, the mean values of selectivity show a decreasing trend with synthesis time. Thus, for membranes prepared with 8 h synthesis time, the highest value of selectivity (7.2) was obtained, whereas the average value of the selectivity was 5.5. From 8 to 12 h synthesis time, the propylene and propane permeances increase but for longer synthesis times permeances decrease, an apparently erratic behaviour. In fact, the permeances show the expected evolution with respect to weight gain (Table 2). A larger weight gain implies a denser layer and ETS-10 material inside the pores of the support, as has been observed by SEM; as a consequence, a higher resistance to gas transport (lower permeance) results. Moreover, XRD of membranes with 24 and 48 h of synthesis has shown the presence of quartz, a dense material that would decrease gas permeance. Finally, the highest standard deviation was found for the membranes synthesized in 48 h, also indicating a lower reproducibility of the synthesis carried out at longer times.
From the data in Table 1, the yield of high-quality membranes with a permselectivity higher than 4 (four times the Knudsen selectivity, 1.02) is 100% for membranes prepared with 8-h syntheses. Using the same criterion for membranes prepared in 12 h and 24 h of synthesis, the membrane yield would be 66%, and would decrease to 33% for 48 h, in agreement with the high standard deviation exhibited by these membranes for the separation of the propylene/propane mixture (Table 2). The membrane yields reported here are comparable to other values found in the literature. Giannakopoulos and Nikolakis [17] prepared four FAU-type zeolite membranes with the same synthesis conditions showing always propylene/propane selectivity higher than 8 at higher temperatures (100 °C). However, these membranes had lower propylene permeances compared to those prepared in this work. Using other criterion, Noack et al. [27] reported for silicalite-1 membranes a yield of 70% in terms of H2/SF6 permselectivity of 43 (which is five times the Knudsen factor). Applying this criterion of selectivity of at least five times the Knudsen factor (5.1), to the membranes prepared in this work would produce a yield of 66% for membranes prepared in 8-h syntheses. Li et al. [28] obtained a 50% ZSM-5 membrane yield with the criteria H2/n-butane ideal selectivity higher than 27. Kong et al. [29] reported a 70% silicalite-1 membrane yield (H2/n-butane ideal selectivity higher than 25). Finally, Navajas et al. [30] reported a 73% yield for mordenite membranes with water/ethanol pervaporation separation factors higher than 35.
Fig. 4 shows the evolution of the propylene/propane selectivity and of the propane and propylene permeances of membrane M16 as a function of time. It can be seen that, over a period of 15 days of operation, both permeances decrease to about one third of their original values. At the same time, the selectivity also decreased from 5.3 to 4.3 because of the slightly faster decrease of propylene permeance. At this point, the ETS-10 membrane was treated at 240 °C for 12 h under a He stream (“A” period in Fig. 4). After this treatment, both the propylene permeance and the selectivity dramatically decreased from 2.6 × 10−8 mol/(m2 s Pa) to 6.5 × 10−9 mol/(m2 s Pa) and from 4.3 to 2.2, respectively. Next, the membrane was removed from the module and calcined in an air furnace for 8 h at 350 °C (“B” period in Fig. 4) and tested again for propylene/propane separation. With this second thermal treatment, the ETS-10 membrane recovered part (when compared to corresponding values for the fresh membrane) of the selectivity and propylene permeance values. With a further treatment under air for 8 h (“C” period in Fig. 4) at a slightly higher temperature (380 °C), the membrane recovered a higher propylene permeance (5.8 × 10−8 mol/(m2 s Pa)), corresponding to 75% of its initial value (7.8 × 10−8 mol/(m2 s Pa)) and also the selectivity was mostly recovered (4.8 vs. the initial value 5.3). A similar behaviour was found for ETS-10 and AM-6 vanadosilicate (isomorphous material of ETS-10) membranes prepared with a different synthesis method but which underwent a similar experimental history [10].

Membrane treatments: (A) He atmosphere for 12 h at 240 °C; (B and C) air atmosphere for 8 h at 350 and 380 °C, respectively.
These results suggest that strongly adsorbed hydrocarbons blocked the selective membrane pores even at low temperature (30 °C). When the temperature increased up to 240 °C (period A of Fig. 4), due to the aforementioned catalytic character of ETS-10, some decomposition/pyrolysis reactions of the adsorbed hydrocarbons took place, leading to blockage of membrane pores by the resulting carbonaceous deposits. Finally, at higher temperatures (350 and 380 °C) under air the combustion of carbonaceous deposits took place, and the permeation properties were for the most part recovered. These hypotheses were corroborated by subsequent XPS analysis.
The influence of the propylene concentration in the feed on membrane performance is presented in Fig. 5 for membranes M5 and M11. These experiments were carried out sequentially at propylene partial pressures of 30, 50 and 70 kPa, propane being the remainder to a total pressure of 100 kPa. After the highest propylene partial pressure (70 kPa), the lowest partial pressure (30 kPa) was tested again. The figure also shows the protocol of variation of propylene partial pressure (Fig. 5a); between each feed composition the membrane was swept with inert gas. The values represented in Fig. 5b and c correspond to mean permeances and fluxes for the last 3 h of experiment at each partial pressure. Within the interval studied, the propylene and propane permeances (Fig. 5b) declined, whereas the selectivity slightly increased for M11 membrane and there is not a clear trend for M5 by the change of propylene concentration. A similar trend, for the permeance of the most permeable component (propylene), has been observed by other authors [18] with carbon membranes, although in that case the selectivity changed considerably. This behaviour for propylene permeance is characteristic of adsorption-controlled membrane transport processes, when the surface concentration of adsorbed compounds is close to the saturation regime (the values of propylene partial pressure used are above those found to correspond to saturation coverage for pure propylene on ETS-10 powder at approximately 20 kPa [22]). Under these conditions, an increase in the partial pressure of propylene (the preferentially adsorbed component) produces a decreasing of permeance (flux per unit of partial pressure difference). In spite of this, the increase in partial pressure of propylene from 30 to 70 kPa was still able to produce a noticeable increase of its permeation flux, and a corresponding decrease of the propane flux (Fig. 5c), which is displaced from the membrane pores by propylene. Similar changes in the propylene and propane fluxes with increasing propylene partial pressure were observed by Giannakopoulos and Nikolakis [17] in FAU-type zeolite in the 15–95 kPa range at 90 °C.

Operating conditions—feed: 60 mL(STP)/min of propylene/propane mixture. He sweep gas: 60 mL(STP)/min. T = 30 °C. The open symbol represents the final experimental run with a repeated experiment at the lower propylene partial pressure.
The effect of temperature on the selectivity and propylene permeance is presented in Fig. 6 for membranes M5, M11 and M12. M5 and M11 membranes were previously used to study the influence of propylene composition in the feed, therefore before use they were subjected to treatment at 380 °C in air for 8 h to remove any adsorbed species or carbonaceous deposits. As shown in Fig. 6a, these experiments were carried out increasing the temperature from 30 to 110 °C, then to 130 °C (M5) or 150 °C (M11 and M12); finally, the lowest temperature (30 °C) was tested again. The values represented in Fig. 6b and c are mean values for the last 3 h at each temperature. As expected, the membranes M11 and M12 prepared with the lower synthesis time (8 h) show higher propylene permeance than membrane M5 (24 h synthesis time) at any temperature. In all cases, the propylene permeance increased with temperature which is probably due to both the increase in the mobility of adsorbed species and activated flow through ETS-10 micropores. This is in accordance with the previously discussed results of TPP experiments. Regarding the selectivity, in agreement with the results in Table 2, membrane M5 with longer synthesis time displays lower values than membranes M12 and M13 in 8-h syntheses. In any case, selectivities decreased with temperature because adsorption (the main mechanism governing the separation of propylene from propane in our membranes) decreases with temperature. This agrees with TPP results which showed that the propane permeance increased with temperature faster than that of propylene in this temperature range. Also, the fact that the C3H6/C3H8 ideal selectivity is lower for membrane M5 than the corresponding selectivity indicates that the preferential adsorption of propylene is the key to the separation behaviour observed, with adsorbed propylene hindering propane permeation. The final repeated experiment at the lowest temperature (30 °C) corroborates the already discussed deactivation of propylene permeance and selectivity with time on stream, which can be reversed by treatment in air at higher temperatures.

Finally, Fig. 7 compares the propylene/propane separation properties obtained for the membranes synthesized in this work with some of the results extracted from a literature survey for inorganic and polymeric membranes. It should be taken into account that results from different laboratories are often difficult to compare because of the different experimental conditions used. Fig. 7 shows the experimentally observed C3H6 upper bound line found by Burns and Koros [13] using data available from the literature based on pure gas measurements. Mean values of the results presented in this work at 30 °C are plotted in the graph for each synthesis time, taking as the ETS-10 membrane thickness the value of 8 μm, as determined by SEM. Permeation properties corresponding to membranes prepared at longer synthesis times (24 and 48 h) are below the upper bound line, while membranes with 8 and 12 h of synthesis time are above. It should be noted that the preparation of ETS-10 membrane reported in a previous work [10] involved a laborious method (two-step seeded synthesis) and used a different gel preparation method. In spite of this, these membranes had similar selectivities with a lower permeability. Therefore, the single-step synthesis of ETS-10 membranes with a gel based on titanium tetrabutoxide as the Ti source and with fluoride ions reported in this work can be considered as an improvement in terms of membrane performance through a synthesis process less costly than two-step synthesis with a gel based on TiCl3 as the Ti source and chloride ions [10]. Since, the role of Na+, K+, and F− in ETS-10 crystallization is unclear [33], the performance improvement observed in the single-step synthesis could be related to the lower viscosity of the gel prepared in this work which allows a good contact between the support and the ETS-10 growing layer; also, a lower viscosity gel increases mass transfer rates (and therefore the rate of reactant supply to the growing membrane) during synthesis, producing an ETS-10 layer with good quality in a single-step synthesis. The membranes prepared in this work have one of the highest permeabilities reported, about 4000 Barrer (12 h synthesis time) and 1900 Barrer (8 h synthesis), together with selectivities ranged between 4 and 7.2.

3.3. XPS analysis
The results of XPS measurements have been used to explain the loss of permeance and selectivity of the membranes exposed to the organic mixture. The survey spectra of M12 and M13 membranes (not shown) contained the Si, Ti, O, C, Na and K peaks. As was already reported for ETS-10 powder [22], the O 1s region was decomposed into two contributions; the high-intensity peak at a binding energy of 532.3–532.4 eV is attributed to O in Si–O–Si and Si–O–Ti linkages. The low binding energy (BE) peak with lower intensity (530.4–530.8 eV) is due to Ti–O–Ti bonds [34].
An interesting feature was the high carbon concentration found in the surface of the used membranes that had lost their separation properties (Table 3), around twice the concentration found in the powder. The C 1s spectrum of the powder consists of a peak with a shoulder on the high-binding energy side but on the surface of the used membranes M12 and M13 a third contribution at higher BE appeared (Fig. 8). The C 1s spectrum in this case was deconvoluted into three peaks: the one at lower BE (284.7–284.9 eV) can be attributed to C–C and/or CC [34], the second at 286.2–286.8 eV would be related to C–O bonds, and the last one at the highest binding energy could indicate the presence of ROCO groups [35]. As was expected, after 1200 s etching, the amount of carbon on the sample diminished in both membranes, whereas the peak at high-binding energy disappeared. This would indicate a different nature of the carbon deposit on the surface and inside the pores of the membrane. As already explained, when the membranes were treated in a He flow at 240 °C for 12 the carbon deposits remained. However, treatment in air at 380 °C for 8 h not only diminished the amount of carbon but also reduced the species with high BE (Table 3); this could explain the recovery of separation properties observed after the calcination. The origin of ROCO groups could be related to a reaction occurring during the separation process. Studying the interaction of methyl and ethyl acetylene on H-ETS-10 at room temperature, Zecchina et al. [36] showed the formation of carbocationic double bond conjugated systems. In a first step of the interaction, the formation of 1:1 π hydrogen-bonded adducts were observed; by increasing the contact time, an oligomerization reaction took place. On the other hand, Krisnandi and Howe [37] found that the presence of stacking faults in ETS-10 promoted the photo-polymerization reaction of ethene. The contact of the organic mixture during the separation process could lead to the formation of similarly complex molecules on the surface of the membrane that would be removed by calcinations in air.

XPS C 1s core level spectra of membrane M12: (a) after 5 days under operating conditions indicated in Table 1, (b) after step (a) calcined with He at 240 °C for 12 h, (c) after step (b) calcined with air at 380 °C for 8 h. Membrane M13: (d) after 1 day under operating conditions indicated in Table 1, (e) after step (d) calcined with air at 380 °C for 8 h. ETS-10 powder is included for comparison.
The Ti 2p3/2 peak in the ETS-10 powder (Table 3) is positioned at 458.9 eV is attributed to the octahedral Ti atoms in the –O–Ti–O–Ti–O– chains [38]. For used membranes the Ti 2p peaks became broader and could be deconvoluted into two doublets. Ti 2p3/2 main feature in the surface of the membranes appeared at the same BE that in the powder (458.8–458.9 eV), whereas a second small peak was observed at lower BE, 456.8–456.9 eV for the calcined samples and 457.0–457.2 eV for the used ones. This second peak suggests the existence of titanium species with different states other than the octahedral one in the –O–Ti–O–Ti–O– chains. The presence of this lower energy peak could be due to extra framework TiO2: the shift of the Ti 2p3/2 line from 458.8 (characteristic of the titanium oxide) to lower BEs would be related to an electron donating effect of oxygen atoms on the oxide particles [39]. After etching the Ti 2p3/2 spectrum went back to only one peak; the lower BEs observed (458.0–458.2 eV) can now be attributed to the reducing effect of the ion etching. This fact leads to another less probable explanation in which species of Ti produced by the exposition to the organic mixture would be involved, since Ti in organic molecules presents binding energies around 457 eV [40].
4. Conclusions
High-quality titanosilicate ETS-10 membranes with a good degree of crystal intergrowth can be prepared by one-step seeded hydrothermal synthesis on porous alumina tubular supports. Controlling the pH of the precursor solution and the synthesis time are key factors in this process. ETS-10 membranes prepared under the optimum synthesis conditions (pH 10.4 and synthesis time equal to 8 h) were able to separate at 30 °C a 30/70 propylene/propane mixture with an average selectivity of 5.5 and a propylene permeance of 7.9 × 10−8 mol/(m2 s Pa), giving a maximum selectivity of 7.2 at a propylene permeance of 13 × 10−8 mol/(m2 s Pa). The propylene/propane separation was possible over a wide range of operating conditions: temperature from 30 to 150 °C and propylene partial pressure in the feed from 30 to 70 kPa. Also, the membranes prepared here have a performance comparable to that of other membranes in the literature: their average permeability is about 2000 Barrer (calculated using 8 μm of membrane thickness as obtained by SEM analysis). For this level of permeability the selectivity is one of the highest reported in the literature. The membranes prepared with longer synthesis times (24 and 48 h) exhibited quartz impurities and lower selectivities.
When exposed to propylene/propane mixtures, after 15 days on stream, the separation performance of ETS-10 membranes declined: the selectivity and propylene permeance decreased, respectively, to 81% and 33% of the initial values. XPS analysis on the membrane surface helps to understand this behaviour by showing that, due to the strong basicity of ETS-10, prolonged contact of the membrane with the separation mixture leads to the formation of hydrocarbon deposits giving rise to blockage of selective pores. A thermal treatment (380 °C) with air produced the combustion of the adsorbed organic compounds/hydrocarbon deposits, leading to a significant recovery of the separation properties of the membranes.
