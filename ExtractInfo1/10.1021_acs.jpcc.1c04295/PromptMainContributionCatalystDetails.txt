Origin of Performances of Pt/Cu Single-Atom Alloy Catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation
Abstract
The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction converts cheap propane to value-added propene. Pt-based catalysts show high performance in PDH, but suffer from coke formation and deactivation. Therefore, promoter, that is, a second metal component, is required to enhance its stability. Our previous study has constructed Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalysts and achieved high PDH selectivity and anticoke ability. However, the nature of its high performance in PDH still remains to be revealed. This paper describes the origin of catalytic performance for Pt/Cu SAA in PDH via density functional theory (DFT) calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations. We constructed a complex reaction network with 54 reversible reaction steps, including adsorption, desorption, C–H bond breaking, and C–C bond cracking processes on the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst. The high selectivity of propene has been demonstrated because of the higher occurrence of propene formation and, simultaneously, the high energy barriers for deep dehydrogenation of propene. The lower coverages of the coke species origin from the deep dehydrogenation instead of the C–C bond cracking for Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, which is different from that proposed for Pt catalyst. The simulation suggests that hydrogen (H2) cofeeding can further reduce the surface coke species. Overall, the current study provides fundamental insights into the origin of high selectivity and anticoke ability to help the design of stable and high-performance Pt-based catalysts.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The increasing demand of propene, which is basic raw material for many important industrial products, and the abundant source of propane due to the appearance of shale gas have promoted the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology for the production of propene. (1−7) However, the PDH reaction is highly endothermic with the standard enthalpy of 124.3 kJ/mol requiring high operation temperatures resulting in the severe side reactions, including deep dehydrogenation, cracking, and coke formation. (8) Therefore, the design of stable and high-performance catalysts is constrained for the PDH. (9) Currently, several catalytic processes have been commercialized including Catofin (CrOx/Al2O3) and Oleflex (Pt/Sn/Al2O3) technologies. (10) Particularly, Pt-based catalysts are the first to be implemented in the industrial alkane dehydrogenation process due to their superior activation of C–H bonds. (3,4) However, the Pt catalyst has problems of coke deposition and severe sintering causing the catalyst deactivation and poor selectivity of propene. Thus, metal promoters play key roles in modifying the properties of Pt, such as Sn, (11−14) Cu, (15−17) Zn, (18,19) Fe, (20,21) Ga, (22,23) In, (24,25) and Co. (26) Many theoretical and experimental studies have been implemented to explore the nature of high performance for Pt-based metal alloy catalysts in PDH. (14,18,26−29)
Regarding the roles of the metal promoters, geometric effect, and electronic effect have been proposed. From a geometric perspective, Zha et al. has adopted DFT to indicate that the metal In plays an essential role in the dispersion of Pt atoms, which induces the weak π mode of propene adsorption. (25) Pham et al. concluded that the Sn could help in the redispersion and regeneration of Pt by providing nucleation sites on the alumina surface. (11) As for the electronic effect of the promoter elements, it has been found that Pt-skin catalyst surfaces with the d-band moving away from the Fermi level can decrease the desorption energies of propene, contributing to higher selectivity than Pt catalyst in PDH. (20) Similar effects also appear in the other promoters, such as Ga (27) and Sn. (14) DFT calculations have supported that the introduction of Sn decreases the energy barriers of propene desorption and simultaneously increases that of deep dehydrogenation. (14) On the other hand, Cybulskis et al. has studied the role of Zn promoter and proposed that the promoting effect results from the energy of Pt 5d electrons instead of the electron occupancy. (18) Our previous work has found that the Pt/Cu single atom alloy (SAA) catalyst can break the scaling relationship to promote selectivity of propene with less coke and, meanwhile, maintain reasonable propane dehydrogenation activity. (16) However, the mechanism studies are based on several dehydrogenation steps and neglected lateral interactions, which stays away from a complex PDH reaction network. Therefore, the nature of its high performance and anticoke ability in PDH still remains to be further explored.
Based on the molecular-level research, the complex reaction network and lateral interactions of active sites and adsorption species should be considered to further illustrate the nature of performance for Pt-based catalysts in PDH. The kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) method considers the lateral interactions, multiadsorption as well as the spatial inhomogeneity, which is suitable for the complicated PDH catalytic system. (30,31) Lian et al. has applied kMC to reveal the origin of Pt catalyst deactivation, (30) which provides appropriate data for us to compare and analyze the nature of high performance for the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst.
Herein, a total of 54 reversible PDH reaction steps were performed on the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst that includes four kinds of active sites. Based on the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters from DFT and kMC simulations, the nature of high performance and anticoke ability for the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst is revealed when compared with a Pt catalyst in PDH. Overall, the current study provides theoretical analysis of the origin of PDH performance and guidance for the design of stable Pt-based catalysts.

Density Functional Theory Calculations
The geometry optimization, energy barriers, and adsorption energies were calculated by density functional theory calculations implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). (32) The Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF-vdW) was used to describe the electron exchange and correlation effects. (33) The interaction between atomic cores and electrons was depicted by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method. (34) The slab models with p(4 × 4) and p(3 × 3) supercell were selected to simulate Pt/Cu SAA (111) surface and Pt(111) surface, respectively, with five-layer slab models whose bottom three layers were fixed. The k-point mesh was generated by following the Monkhors–Pack procedure with a 3 × 3 × 1 mesh. To avoid periodic interaction between different slabs, a sufficient 15 Å of vacuum region was placed in the Z direction. The atomic force convergence employed in the geometry optimization was 0.02 eV/Å.
The minimum energy reaction pathways searching was performed by the climbing image nudged elastic band (CL-NEB) method with six images during the process. (35,36) Then the dimer method was applied to locate the transition state structure with an atomic force convergence of 0.02 eV/Å.
The adsorption energy Eads and activation energy Ea were calculated as the following:

where Eads/slab and Eslab, are the calculated energies of the surface with and without adsorbate; Egas is the gas energy calculated by DFT; ETS and EIS are the energies of transition states and initial states in the reaction.
The zero-point energy (ZPE) was calculated by the vibrational frequency as the following:

Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulations
The thermodynamic and kinetic parameters calculated by DFT were input into the kMC performed by software package Zacros to simulate PDH reaction dynamics. (37,38) The Hamiltonian energy of a lattice structure was calculated from the energetic model named cluster expansion, which considered lateral interactions between the adsorbates. The details of the method have been published in the previous articles. (37−39)
The forward (kfwd) and backward (kbwd) rate constants were calculated by the Arrhenius equation. For surface reactions,

The surface model consists of a total of 10800 sites (20 × 20). As shown in Figure 1, every unit cell contains one Pt top site, six Pt/Cu hollow sites, eight Cu top sites, and Cu/Cu hollow sites. The interactions between the adjacent coadsorption species as well as the adjacent sites are considered. To carry out the simulations under the experimental reaction conditions, the total pressure and the temperature are set to be 1 bar and 873 K, respectively.

DFT Calculations
Adsorption
The saturated hydrocarbons, including propane, ethane, and methane, are composed of strong C–H and C–C bonds, performing weak interactions with the catalyst surface, which accounts for their higher activation energy barriers and weak adsorption on the catalyst surface. To obtain more accurate adsorption energy, the BEEF-vdW functional was applied to calculate adsorption energies of propane, ethane, and methane on the Pt/Cu SAA(111) surface, which are −0.25, −0.18, and −0.11 eV, respectively. Obviously, the light alkanes generally physisorb on the catalyst surface. On the other hand, olefins and alkynes can chemisorb on the Pt/Cu SAA(111) and Pt(111) surface strongly with their unsaturated bonds, accompanied by higher adsorption energies shown in Table 1. Compared with the Pt/Cu SAA(111) surface, propene adsorption is stronger on the Pt(111) surface, resulting in more difficult propene desorption. The detailed adsorption structures of propane and propene are shown in Figure 2.

Reaction Network
The PDH reaction network consists of adsorption and desorption processes, C–H bond breaking, and C–C bond cracking in our kMC simulation. Due to the weak adsorption of H2 (+0.11 eV), propane, ethane, and methane, they were regarded as the dissociated adsorption on the Pt/Cu SAA(111) surface. The PDH reaction network and transition states are given in Figures 3 and 4. It suggests that activation energy barriers of all dehydrogenation steps (named DX, X = 1–17, 30–41, 46–49) on the Pt/Cu SAA(111) surface are below 1.54 eV (Figure 5), representing the superior activation ability of C–H bonds. On the contrary, energy barriers of almost all the C–C bond breaking steps (named CX, X = 18–29. 42–45) are above 2.0 eV, contributing to the decrease of side reaction steps, which is different from the Pt catalyst that the energy barriers of C–H and C–C bond breaking are close at the later reaction steps, which corresponds to the cracking of propyne.

kMC Simulations
Rate Constants and Lateral Interactions
The rate constants (k) were evaluated by the energy barriers (Ea) of elementary steps calculated by DFT and the pre-exponential factors, as shown in Table 2. Moreover, lateral interactions play an essential role in the calculation of the adsorption energy and activation energy barriers. The kMC simulation takes the lateral interactions into account by means of the cluster expansion. (40) Here, only lateral-interaction energies of the first nearest neighbors between the C3 species and the H atoms were considered due to the lack of C–C bond cracking and the existence of a considerable number of H on the surface (Table 3). The lateral interactions between the C3 species were negligible, which is because different C3 species adsorbed around the separated Pt atoms, resulting in the weak interactions. Among them, the lateral-interaction energy between the CH3CHCH and H species is even up to −0.33 eV, suggesting the necessity of the lateral interactions in dynamic simulations. The computational details of rate constants and lateral-interaction energies are in Supporting Information, S1 and S2.

Origin of the High Performance for Pt/Cu SAA Compared with Pt Catalyst in PDH
To explore the nature of the high performance and anticoke ability for Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, the temporal evolution of turnover frequency (TOF) and selectivity of propene for the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst are shown in Figure 6. The TOF for Pt/Cu SAA keeps stable at ∼0.5 site–1 s–1 after the time of ∼1300 s, less than the value of ∼25 site–1 s–1 for the Pt catalyst, (30) which indicates lower activity for the single site on the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst. This mainly results from the large difference in energy barriers of propane dehydrogenation, which are 1.16 eV (Table 2) for the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst and 0.78 eV (30) for the Pt catalyst, respectively. Meanwhile, it also suggests that the higher conversion rate of propane for the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst when compared with the Pt catalyst is related to the ∼100% dispersion of Pt atoms in Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, which has exposed many more Pt active sites. (41)
Figure 6
Figure 6. Temporal evolution of the turnover frequency (TOF) and the selectivity of propene on time scales of (a) 1.0 s and (b) 2000 s, obtained from a 20 × 20 lattice simulation.
In addition, selectivity of propene for the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst drops off rapidly from 0.04 to 0.06 s and rises again as shown in Figure 6a, which is possibly relevant to the rate of coke deposition. Therefore, we recorded the temporal evolution of the coverage of the coke species during this period, as shown in Figure 7a, and it manifests the coverage curve that suddenly steepens between the time of 0.04 and 0.06 s. This indicates that the side reaction steps tend to occur on the Pt/Cu SAA surface to produce the coke species at the beginning of the PDH reaction, which accounts for the temporary decrease in the selectivity of propene. However, with the occupancy of the active sites for coke formation, the selectivity of propene increases again. To investigate the coke species in detail, the temporal evolution of the coverages of surface species over the time of 2000 s is shown in Figure 7b. In addition to the considerable coverage of H adsorbates on the surface, the main coke species are CH3CCH2 and CH3CHCH during the early period, but the number of CH3CH2C increases rapidly and takes priority later, which is steady after ∼1300 s. However, it is estimated that the main surface species are C1 and C2 on the Pt surface. (30) The difference explains that C–C bond breaking becomes unattainable on the Pt/Cu SAA surface, but available on the Pt surface, which induces the occurrence of side reactions to produce more coke species on the Pt surface.
Figure 7
Figure 7. Temporal evolution of coverages of (a) coke species on a time scale of 0.20 s and (b) all surface species on a time scale of 2000 s.
To further understand the origin of higher selectivity and less coke for the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, the analysis of event frequency for all elementary steps is shown in Figure 8. Due to the smaller event frequency of the forward step compared with that of the backward step in deep dehydrogenation of propene (D9 and D10), the propene formation tends to occur and, simultaneously, deep dehydrogenation of propene is limited. Furthermore, the difference in occurrence of forward and backward steps to propene is larger by comparing the propene formation (D4 and D5) with the side dehydrogenation reactions (D3 and D6). Therefore, selectivity of propene for the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst is higher than that for the Pt catalyst (∼85%), simulated and analyzed by Lian et al. (30) As mentioned above, the main coke species are C1 and C2 species on the Pt surface, but it is almost impossible for C–C bond cracking on the Pt/Cu SAA surface. Meanwhile, the event frequencies for deep dehydrogenation of C3H5 and C–C bond cracking are zero, which indicates that C3H5 is the dead-end species, as shown in Figure 8. The formation of C3H5 results from the side dehydrogenation steps rather than the deep dehydrogenation of propene, whose reaction paths are shown in Scheme 1. Thus, the main coke species originates from the side dehydrogenation and deep dehydrogenation of CH3CCH3 and CH3CH2CH on the Pt/Cu SAA surface.

Effect of H2-Cofeeding
The dehydrogenation activity and selectivity of propene for Pt/Cu SAA catalyst have been promoted when H2 is cofed in the PDH reaction, as suggested in our previous work. (16) To further clarify the effect of H2 cofeeding, the propane and hydrogen were mixed into the PDH reaction under the experiment conditions (C3H8/H2 = 1:1). Compared with pure propane feeding, TOF has a slight improvement (Figure S2), and the coverage of the surface coke species decreases with H2 cofeeding, as shown in Figure 9a, but the improved selectivity is not obvious due to the sufficiently high selectivity without H2 cofeeding, as mentioned before. The calculated selectivity (∼100%) is higher than the experimental results (∼90%), which may result from the acidity of the alumina support, causing the carbon formation and the destruction of SAA catalyst due to Cu sintering at the high temperature in experiments. Meanwhile, the time of thermodynamic equilibrium moves from ∼1300 s to ∼1650 s, satisfying the thermodynamic analysis. Through the analysis of the difference in event frequency between forward and backward steps, as shown in Figure 9b, D1 and D2 steps representing dehydrogenation of propane suggest forward steps have been promoted with H2 cofeeding, which explains its better dehydrogenation activity. Moreover, the forward steps of the propene formation (D4 and D5) are enhanced with H2 cofeeding. Simultaneously, the deep dehydrogenation of propene (D9 and D10) has been limited due to the enhanced backward steps. Thus, surface coke species can be reduced.

DFT calculations and kMC simulations have been performed to compare the PDH performance and coke formation for Pt/Cu SAA with that for the Pt catalyst by analyzing the whole reaction network, including adsorption and desorption processes, C–H bond breaking, and C–C bond cracking. Due to the weak adsorption of H2, propane, ethane, and methane, they perform the dissociated adsorption on the Pt/Cu SAA(111) surface. The energy barriers of almost all the C–C bond cracking are above 2.0 eV, larger than that of C–H bond breaking, resulting in the difficult C–C bond breaking to reduce the side reaction steps, which differs from the Pt catalyst that the activation energy barriers of C–H and C–C bond breaking become close to each other. (30) In addition, the significant difference in TOF results from the larger gap (∼0.4 eV) of energy barrier in propane dehydrogenation for Pt/Cu SAA and Pt catalysts. Moreover, the fluctuation of selectivity of propene at the beginning of the PDH reaction is related to the rate of coke deposition. The higher selectivity of propene for the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst originates from the larger difference in event frequency between forward and backward steps for propene formation compared with the side dehydrogenation reaction steps. Another reason is the limited deep dehydrogenation of propene due to the smaller event frequency of the forward step compared with that of the backward step. Furthermore, the main coke species for the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst changes from CH3CCH2 and CH3CHCH to CH3CH2C later along the time evolution. The reaction paths of coke species on the Pt/Cu SAA surface are also revealed, which suggests that the formation of dead-end C3H5 results from the side dehydrogenation steps of CH3CCH3 and CH3CH2CH, rather than the deep dehydrogenation of propene. Meanwhile, by the analysis of event frequencies for elementary steps, the coke formation originates from deep dehydrogenation for the Pt/Cu SAA catalyst instead of C–C bond cracking due to their higher C–C activation energy barriers, which is different from the origin proposed for the Pt catalyst. (30) To understand the effect of H2 cofeeding, we carried out the PDH dynamic simulation under experimental conditions (C3H8/H2 = 1:1) and found that H2 cofeeding could reduce the surface coke species and increase the conversion rate of propane by regulating the process of forward and backward steps. Compared with the Pt catalyst, we have analyzed the origin of high PDH performance for Pt/Cu SAA catalyst, which also applies to Pd/Cu SAA (42) and other single-atom alloys. (43) Overall, the study may shed some light on the design of stable and high-performance Pt-based catalysts.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
