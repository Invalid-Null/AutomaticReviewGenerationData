 Unfortunately the provided documents do not seem to contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation research. All the documents discuss unrelated topics like selective hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenylacetylene. Since there is no pertinent information, I cannot provide a meaningful summary.
