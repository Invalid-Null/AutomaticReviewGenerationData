Based on the analysis of the multiple document extracts provided, there is no relevant information contained related to propane dehydrogenation catalysts, processes, or performance enhancements. The documents focus on catalytic cracking of hydrocarbon mixtures using zeolite-based additives and do not pertain to converting propane to propylene specifically via dehydrogenation routes. Since no pertinent details could be extracted, I have indicated "No" relevance and left the rest of the XML structure empty. Please provide any additional instructions if I have misunderstood the objective.
