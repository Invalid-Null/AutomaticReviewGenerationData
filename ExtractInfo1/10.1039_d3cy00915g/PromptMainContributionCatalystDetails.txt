High transformation of propane in reaction with CO2 to propylene on ZrO2-combined Fe-based catalysts†
Propane dehydrogenation coupled with CO2 transformation has attracted interest for facilitating propane conversion. The performance of Fe2O3–nZrO2 catalysts obtained using an oxalate coprecipitation procedure was studied for the first time for propane dehydrogenation in a CO2 atmosphere. It was found that an appropriate combination of ZrO2 significantly promoted the transformation of propane. On Fe2O3–nZrO2 (n = 2–4), initial propane conversion (>38%) and CO2 conversion (>27%) were achieved at 550 °C and a set contact time, with a propylene yield above 33%. By means of characterizing the active phase evolution, the effects of surface acidity–basicity and carbon deposition were revealed. The interaction between the iron species and ZrO2 for preserving the active Fe3O4 phase from transition to Fe, and for promoting the adsorption of propane and CO2 on the respective acidic and the basic sites is discussed.
1. Introduction
The exacerbation of the rise in global temperature means it is necessary to reduce the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a way to obtain propylene has attracted interest1 and iron-based catalysts have been explored to promote this process.2–5 But propane conversion was below 20% under the tested conditions and unstable. The main causes were the decline in the iron active species and carbon deposition. It was reported that Fe2+ and Fe0 in reduced Fe2O3/Al2O3 were the active species for PDH, and FexC was the active phase for propane cracking.2,3 Isolated and three-fold coordinated FeII was also active for PDH,4 whereas metallic Fe0 and FeIIOx nanoparticles showed low activity and propylene selectivity. In the initial stage of PDH on a 3Fe:P/Al2O3 catalyst, Fe0 was formed which eventually changed into active FexC species.5
Oxidative propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (OPDH-CO2) is thermodynamically advantageous over PDH, as shown in reactions (1) and (2). Propane is dehydrogenated on catalysts to produce propylene and H2, followed by the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, which would enhance the equilibrium-limited PDH.6–11
C3H8 → C3H6 + H2 (1)
CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O (2)
However, the catalysts suffer from fast deactivation due to carbon deposition. For OPDH-CO2 on an iron-based catalyst, the issue of carbon deposition would be mitigated via the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C → 2CO).12,13 Nevertheless, the conversion of C3H8(CO2) was insufficient. During this two-step reaction process, both the redox properties and the acid/base properties of the catalysts play important roles.14,15 It was demonstrated that balancing the acid/base properties of an In2O3–Al2O3 composite was indispensable to its catalytic performance via synergism between the PDH and RWGS steps.16 Though acidic sites benefited propane adsorption for the PDH step, too strong acid sites could cause deep reactions of propane, including cracking and carbon deposition.14,17 Moreover, the strength and concentration of basic sites on the catalyst surface affected the adsorption and reactivity of CO2.15,18 Higher conversion of CO2 was achieved on In/Al(1) oxide than on In/Al(2) oxide and on In/zirconia owing to the high total concentration of basic sites.16 The study of a PtFe bimetallic catalyst for OPDH-CO2 showed that Fe0 was responsible for carbon deposition, and Fe3O4 was the active species for propylene formation;19 the conversion of propane and CO2 was low because only 24% of H2 produced by the PDH reaction was consumed by the RWGS reaction. CeO2-supported bimetallic Fe3Ni also showed lower conversion of propane and lower propylene selectivity.12 To enhance OPDH-CO2, it is necessary to control the active phases and the acid/base properties of the catalysts.
Surface active sites are one of the dominant factors determining the catalytic performance in CO2 reactions.20,21 Maintaining the good dispersion and stability of the active phases is a prerequisite to achieving the anticipated activity.22 Oxide carriers are widely used to disperse active phases as much as possible and to make full use of active phases.23 Besides, oxide carriers often provide catalysts with acid/base properties, observably affecting the catalytic performance.16 Furthermore, the interaction between active phases and carriers has been shown to affect the active phases and to change the acid/base properties of catalysts.2,3,13 An Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalyst displayed weak interaction between Fe2O3 and Al2O3, and a certain acidity, showing propane conversion below 10% in OPDH-CO2 under the tested conditions;13 Fe2O3/MgO showed low conversion due to the formation of a stable MgFe2O4 spinel phase and strong basicity. The sulfation of Al2O3 increased the interaction of Al2O3 with Fe2O3,2 which also changed the acidity of the catalyst, thereby improving propane adsorption and propylene desorption during PDH.
ZrO2 has oxo/hydroxyl surface groups and showed an ability to adjust catalytic properties.24,25 The ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen in a reducing atmosphere was identified as the main factor affecting PDH activity and propylene selectivity.26 The resulting surface coordination of unsaturated zirconium cations made them more active than their regular counterparts for the formation of propylene. If the redox and acid/base properties of iron-based catalysts were controlled more precisely, a high conversion of propane and CO2 would be possible. However, the effect of ZrO2 combination on iron-based catalysts for OPDH-CO2 has not been reported to the best of our knowledge.
In this work, Fe2O3–nZrO2 catalysts were prepared using an oxalate coprecipitation procedure and their catalytic performance for OPDH-CO2 was studied with the aim of promoting the conversion of propane and CO2. Their multifunctionality, including redox and acid/base properties, is discussed by means of multiple characterization techniques. The effects of the interaction between the iron species and ZrO2, and the effects of the acid/base properties on the catalytic performance are elucidated.
2. Experimental methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (analytical reagent, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) and Zr(NO3)4·5H2O (analytical reagent, Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.) in the desired molar ratios of ZrO2/Fe2O3 were first dissolved in 60 mL of anhydrous ethanol (analytical reagent, Tianjin Damao Chemical Reagent Factory) and stirred to form homogeneous solution A. H2C2O4·2H2O (analytical reagent, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) in a molar ratio of H2C2O4·2H2O to (Fe2O3 + ZrO2) of 4 was dissolved in 40 mL of anhydrous ethanol and stirred to form transparent solution B. Next, at 50 °C and under intense agitation, solution B was added dropwise into solution A, and stirred for 4 h. The resulting homogeneous gel was dried at 110 °C for 12 h and then calcined in air at 600 °C for 4 h to obtain Fe2O3–nZrO2, where n represents molar ratios of ZrO2/Fe2O3 of 1, 2, 3, 4, 9 and 19. For comparison, Fe2O3 and ZrO2 were also prepared using a similar procedure.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
For the characterization procedures for catalyst phases (powder X-ray diffraction), micro-morphology (electron microscopy), textural parameters (N2 physicoadsorption), temperature-programmed surface desorption/reduction behavior (CO2/NH3/C3H8-TPD and H2-TPR), surface element valences (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and carbon deposition (thermogravimetry and Raman spectroscopy), see ESI.†
2.3. Catalytic activity evaluation
A tubular fixed-bed microreactor (length: 400 mm, o.d. 12 mm, i.d. 8 mm) equipped with three gas mass flowmeters and temperature controllers was used to evaluate the catalytic activity for OPDH-CO2. 1 g of catalyst (20–40 mesh) was loaded into the reactor, and the feedgas (C3H8, 8.9 mL min−1, CO2, 8.9 mL min−1 and Ar, 13.1 mL min−1) was switched into it. Before the reaction temperature rose, the number of moles of carbon of the inlet C3H8 and CO2 were analyzed. Afterwards, C3H8 and CO2 were turned off. The reactor was heated under Ar flow to the set reaction temperature. Then, C3H8 and CO2 were switched once again into the reaction zone and contacted the catalyst. As the reaction started to proceed at normal pressure, the effluents from the reactor outlet were sampled at intervals of 30 min with maintenance of 180 °C. The samples were synchronously analyzed on an online gas chromatograph (GC-9560), using TCD for H2, CO and CO2 analysis through a TDX separation column (1 m) and using FID for hydrocarbon analysis through an HP-Al2O3/KCl capillary column (50 m × 0.535 mm × 15 μm).
Considering the following reactions involved (no C3+ hydrocarbons were detected),
C3H8 → C3H6 + H2; H2 + CO2 → CO + H2O
C3H8 → CH4 + C2H4; C2H4 + H2 → C2H6
C3H8 → 3C + 4H2; C + CO2 → 2CO
the activity performance indices were defined and calculated on a carbon mole basis as follows.
where nC3H8(CO2)in and C3H8(CO2)out express the molar number of the inlet C3H8(CO2) and the outlet C3H8(CO2) flow, respectively. n(Ci)out represents the molar number of the hydrocarbon product with carbon number i in the outlet; C3H6(CO)out indicates the molar number of C3H6(CO) in the outlet flow; H2out expresses the H2 molar number in the outlet effluents.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. OPDH-CO2 on Fe2O3–nZrO2
The catalytic activity of Fe2O3–nZrO2 for OPDH-CO2 was evaluated at 550 °C and normal pressure for a reaction of 340 min and the results can be seen in Table 1. Both Fe2O3 and ZrO2 alone showed activity for OPDH-CO2, and the activity on Fe2O3 was much higher than that on ZrO2, indicating the main catalytic function of the iron species.

C3H8/CO2/Ar = 1/1/1.5, W/F = 12.5 g h mol−1, 550 °C and 0.1 MPa. The data outside and inside the brackets were collected at reaction times of 10 min and 340 min, respectively.
With a ZrO2 combination, at a certain molar ratio of Fe2O3 to ZrO2, the conversions of both C3H8 and CO2 on Fe2O3–nZrO2 (n = 2–4), and the corresponding C3H6 yield were significantly increased, demonstrating cooperative promotion by ZrO2. Apart from the target product C3H6, CO, CH4, H2, C2H4 and C2H6 were produced. The higher yield of CO indicated that the RWGS reaction occurred during OPDH-CO2, which shifted the equilibrium-limited PDH as expected. It can also be seen that C3H6 selectivity decreased and CH4 selectivity increased, in comparison with those on Fe2O3. This reciprocal change in the C3H8(CO2) conversion and C3H6 selectivity during OPDH-CO2 could be due to the effect of catalyst acidity.11
Among all the n(ZrO2)/n(Fe2O3) ratios (n = 1–19) tried, Fe2O3–3ZrO2 exhibited the optimum combination effect (high and durable activity), achieving C3H8 conversion amounting to 83% of equilibrium conversion (Fig. S1†), and C3H6 yield above 33%, indicating that the promotional effect of ZrO2 required an appropriate molar ratio of ZrO2 to Fe2O3. This enhancement was attributed to the tuned acid–base properties of Fe2O3–nZrO2, which were conducive to the adsorption of C3H8 and CO2.14
Although strong surface acidity favored the adsorption of C3H8, it also increased the secondary reactions of C3H6.14 The decrease in C3H6 and the increase in CH4 on Fe2O3–nZrO2 compared with those on Fe2O3 were inferred to be caused by the secondary reactions of C3H6 on the acidic sites of Fe2O3–nZrO2. The Lewis-acidic sites were found to accelerate the formation of CH4.16 For this reason, the reaction of C3H6 with CO2 on Fe2O3–3ZrO2 was carried out under the same conditions. It was found that C3H8, CH4, C2H4, C2H6, CO and H2 were produced, with higher selectivity for C3H8 and CH4 (Fig. S2†), implying that both cracking and hydrogenation of C3H6 took place. The initial C3H6 conversion and CH4 selectivity reached 52% and 30.6%, respectively, evidencing the deep reaction of C3H6.
Furthermore, during the OPDH-CO2 reaction on Fe2O3–nZrO2 over 340 min-on-stream, the C3H8(CO2) conversion tended to decrease (Fig. 1a), whereas the C3H6 selectivity increased slightly. The CH4 selectivity gradually decreased (Fig. 1b) possibly due to the slowing-down of the secondary reaction of C3H6. Fe2O3–3ZrO2 retained the highest C3H6, CO and H2 yields (Fig. 1c and d), with the lowest decline in the activity indices, versus the greater decline in Fe2O3, demonstrating slow deactivation of Fe2O3–nZrO2. The causes of this trend in activity performance were inferred to be the change in the active phases, including coverage by carbon deposition and incomplete restoration.

For all tested catalyst samples, the carbon balance in a reaction of 10 min (Table 1) was above 90%, slightly lower than that for a reaction of 340 min due to faster carbon deposition in the initial stage. Compared with the reported activity (Table S1†), Fe2O3–nZrO2 (n = 2–4) displayed high activity for C3H8(CO2) conversion and C3H6 production.
These data demonstrated that ZrO2-combined Fe-based catalysts in the appropriate molar ratio of Fe2O3 to ZrO2 evidently enhanced the reaction of C3H8 with CO2 to give C3H6. The promotion should be related to the effects of the interaction between the iron species and ZrO2, and of the tuning of the acid/base properties of Fe2O3–nZrO2 as well as the dispersion of the active iron species on ZrO2.
3.2. Texture and phase evolution of catalysts
A fresh Fe2O3–3ZrO2 catalyst sample contained spheroidal particles (Fig. 2b), smaller by ca. 35 nm than those of Fe2O3 (Fig. 2a). Uniform and smooth particles of 10–15 nm were observed for Fe2O3–3ZrO2 (Fig. 2c and d). The Fe2O3(121) crystal plane with lattice spacing of 0.276 nm and the ZrO2(111) crystal plane with lattice spacing of 0.288 nm were observed. The diffraction rings indicate the Fe2O3(130) and ZrO2(220) crystal planes, with lattice spacings of 0.149 nm and 0.174 nm, respectively. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron micrograph images and elemental mapping of Fe2O3–3ZrO2 (Fig. 2e) demonstrated that the distributions of Fe, Zr and O were uniform. The type IV isotherm with H3-type hysteresis loop (Fig. S3a†) indicated the mesopores of Fe2O3–nZrO2. As the ZrO2 content was raised, the pore diameter tended to become smaller and more uniform (Fig. S3b†). Comparatively, Fe2O3–3ZrO2 had the highest specific surface area and the smallest average pore size (Table S2†). The larger the specific surface area, the higher the dispersion of the active species; Fe2O3–3ZrO2 was thereby more stable.

Fresh Fe2O3–nZrO2 catalyst samples produced the characteristic X-ray diffraction peaks of the tetragonal ZrO2 phase (Fig. 3a), at 2θ of 20.4°, 35.2°, 50.6° and 60.3° (PDF#27-0997).27,28 Fe2O3–1ZrO2 showed the Fe2O3 phase (PDF#85-0599).29,30 From Fig. 3b, as Fe2O3–3ZrO2 was heated in 550 °C exposed to a C3H8–CO2 (1 : 1) atmosphere, starting from 10 min, the pattern of the Fe3O4 phase (PDF#99-0073) was observed, and gradually became stronger until it was stable during the subsequent 150 min. The cause was attributed to the reduction by C3H8. This phase transition was further highlighted by the in situ XRD of Fe2O3–1ZrO2 with a higher Fe2O3 content (Fig. 3c), where the four diffraction peaks for the Fe2O3 phase gradually diminished along with the formation of the Fe3O4 phase. The diffraction peak intensity of Fe3O4 remained stable during the 130 min. The Fe3O4 phase was responsible for the PDH step19 during OPDH-CO2, which was concurrently active for CO2 conversion throughout the RWGS reaction.31

Compared with Fe2O3, fresh Fe2O3–nZrO2 showed obviously different H2-consumption peaks for the reduction of Fe2O3 (Fig. 4). Fe2O3 produced two H2-consumption peaks. The narrow peak at 280–400 °C was assigned to the transition of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4. The broad peak at 400–800 °C was ascribed to the reduction of Fe3O4 to FeO and some FeO to Fe.32 By contrast, Fe2O3–1ZrO2 exhibited three H2-consumption peaks: a (250–400 °C), b (400–550 °C) and c (550–770 °C), attributed to Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, Fe3O4 to FeO, and FeO to Fe, respectively.33 However, with an increase in the n(ZrO2)/n(Fe2O3) ratio of Fe2O3–nZrO2, the areas of these three peaks tended to diminish. When n(ZrO2)/n(Fe2O3) was greater than 3, peak b disappeared. In this case, Fe3O4 would be directly reduced to Fe.32 Moreover, the summit temperature of c shifted to higher temperature while the summit temperature of a shifted to lower temperature, reflecting that the reduction of FeO to Fe was inhibited whereas the reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 was promoted due to the interaction between the iron species and ZrO2. These results demonstrated that an appropriate combination of ZrO2 to Fe2O3 was advantageous for forming more of the stable Fe3O4 phase, which was active for OPDH-CO2 to C3H6. And formation of the Fe phase was restrained in the high-temperature reaction environment, which was active for C3H8 cracking and carbon deposition during the PDH step.2,19
Fig. 4 H2-TPR profiles of fresh catalysts.
The valences of surface iron species of fresh and used Fe2O3–3ZrO2 after OPDH-CO2 reaction for 340 min were measured. From Fig. 5a, fresh Fe2O3–3ZrO2 showed binding energy (B.E.) peaks at 710.7 and 713.1 eV, attributed to Fe2+(2p3/2) and Fe3+(2p3/2),34 and peaks at 723.8 and 725.9 eV attributed to Fe2+(2p1/2) and Fe3+(2p1/2), respectively. The observed Fe2+ suggested that the surface Fe2O3 phase was reduced; the reductant should be CO produced by decomposition of oxalic acid during calcination of the catalyst precursor. For the used Fe2O3–3ZrO2 in OPDH-CO2, the peaks of Fe 2p shifted slightly to higher B.E. Furthermore, the contents of surface Fe, Zr, O elements, and the Zr/Fe molar ratio were obtained from the XPS measurement results (Table S3†), indicating that the Zr/Fe molar ratios were comparable to the nominal ones in the catalyst preparation.

The B.E. of Fe2+ and Fe3+, and the Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio based on Fe 2p3/2 for fresh and used catalysts are summarized in Table 2. The Fe3+/Fe2+ ratios of the fresh catalysts were higher than those of the used catalysts, demonstrating the formation of Fe3O4 during the reaction, consistent with the XRD phase analysis. The Fe3+/Fe2+ ratio in Fe2O3–nZrO2 (n = 2–4) was 0.75–0.94, which should be an appropriate value beneficial to the PDH step in OPDH-CO2.

From Fig. 5b, fresh Fe2O3–3ZrO2 showed the B.E. peak of Zr 3d5/2 at 181.9 eV ascribed to the Zr4+ species.35 After OPDH-CO2 or PDH reaction, the shift to higher B.E. of this peak demonstrated higher electron density owing to stronger interaction between the iron species and ZrO2.36
3.3. Effects of acidity/basicity of catalysts
Fresh Fe2O3–nZrO2 presented evidently weak (95–225 °C) and medium-strong (225–350 °C) desorption peaks of NH3 compared to either Fe2O3 or ZrO2, which showed only weak desorption peaks (Fig. S4†). As the n(ZrO2)/n(Fe2O3) ratio was increased, Fe2O3–3ZrO2 exhibited the least amount of weak acid but the greatest amount of medium-strong acid (Table 3). This change in acidity was attributed to the interaction between the iron species and ZrO2 promoted by the oxo/hydroxyl surface of ZrO2. The moderate amount of weak acid and high amount of medium-strong acid not only facilitated the adsorption–activation propane,14,16 but also promoted the cracking of propane, and was adverse to the desorption of C3H6, thus lowering the C3H6 selectivity. By contrast, with merely weak acidity and less adsorption of C3H8, the C3H8 conversion on Fe2O3 was low. Cracking reactions on the weak acidic sites occurred slowly,14 and the C3H6 selectivity accordingly tended to be high, in agreement with the activity results (Table 1).

Fig. 6 shows the C3H8 desorption test results of fresh catalysts. Unlike the low desorption on Fe2O3, Fe2O3–3ZrO2 produced three desorption peaks of C3H8 at 50–200 °C, 250–400 °C and 500–650 °C, demonstrating more adsorption of C3H8 on Fe2O3–3ZrO2 due to its medium-strong acidity.
Fig. 6 C3H8-TPD profiles of fresh catalysts.
Fresh Fe2O3–nZrO2 samples produced two desorption peaks of CO2 at 50–150 °C and 250–400 °C (Fig. 7), ascribed to weakly basic sites and medium-strong basic sites, respectively.37 The desorption peak areas were increased on Fe2O3–nZrO2 compared to those on Fe2O3, indicating an increased number of basic sites. With an increase in ZrO2 content, the desorption peak at 50–150 °C shifted to lower temperature, and the peak area gradually decreased, suggesting a decreased amount of weakly basic sites. Fe2O3–3ZrO2 showed the lowest peak area of medium-strong basic sites. More medium-strong basic sites could cause excessive adsorption of CO2, which may hinder the adsorption of propane. Hence, appropriate acidity and basicity were favorable in maintaining high activity for C3H8(CO2) conversion. The greatest medium-strong acidity but the least medium-strong basicity of Fe2O3–3ZrO2 was suitable for high activity toward OPDH-CO2.

3.4. Insight into the catalytic mechanism
For the used Fe2O3–3ZrO2 catalyst after reaction for 340 min, the diffraction peak intensity of the t-ZrO2 phase was evidently increased (Fig. 8), and the weak diffraction peak of the Fe3O4 phase was observed due to its relative dispersion. The used Fe2O3 catalyst produced strong diffraction peaks of the Fe3O4 phase (PDF#99-0073) due to the formation of the Fe3O4 phase from the reduction of Fe2O3 during the reaction. These results confirmed that Fe3O4 was the active phase for OPDH-CO2.

Fe2O3–nZrO2 performance during the OPDH-CO2 reaction was better than that of Fe2O3 (Table 1). To understand the mechanism, the activity of Fe2O3–3ZrO2 for the PDH reaction was evaluated comparatively. As shown in Fig. 9, with a reaction of 10 min, the product was mostly C3H6 with a small amount of CH4. After a reaction of 40 min, a high amount of CH4 was produced as the main product while the production of C3H6 was dramatically reduced. At this moment, the active phases should change quickly and the resulting phases speed up the CH4 generation. As the reaction time was further extended, the C3H6 selectivity increased while the CH4 selectivity decreased slightly. The formation of C2H6 slightly increased. When the reaction proceeded for 100 min, the catalyst bed was found to be blocked due to severe carbon deposition, although C3H8 retained a conversion above 40%. This result showed that the active phase of Fe2O3–3ZrO2 during PDH was unstable, and carbon deposition was rapid. By contrast, for OPDH-CO2 on Fe2O3–3ZrO2 (Fig. 1), the durability of the activity (or the active phases) remained better, demonstrating that CO2 could somehow retard carbon deposition by cracking side reactions.

From the XPS analysis in Fig. 5a, the used Fe2O3–3ZrO2 in PDH presents a peak at 707.5 eV, which was ascribed to Fe.38 From Table 2, the Fe phase was not found in the used Fe2O3–3ZrO2 in OPDH-CO2. It was deduced that during OPDH-CO2, the reduction of Fe2+ in the Fe3O4 phase to Fe was prevented because of the oxidation of the surface iron species by CO2, and thus the Fe2+ in the Fe3O4 phase remained. Referring to the activity of Fe2O3–3ZrO2 for PDH in Fig. 9, Fe should act as the active phase for the CH4 formation from C3H8 cracking during PDH.
Thermogravimetric loss of the used catalysts after different reaction times on stream were measured. From Fig. 10a, as the OPDH-CO2 reaction time extended from 120 min to 600 min, the used Fe2O3–3ZrO2 showed a small rise in weight loss, whereas after the PDH reaction for a mere 100 min its weight loss significantly increased (Fig. 10b). The weight loss was mainly caused by carbon deposition. In other words, during the 100 min reaction, the amount of carbon deposition on Fe2O3–3ZrO2 was ca. 40 times lower during OPDH-CO2 than that during PDH. This could be explained by the formation of the Fe phase needed for cracking of C3H8 being inhibited by the presence of CO2. In addition, the reverse Boudouard reaction occurred to some extent.13

Raman spectra of the used catalysts under different activity evaluation conditions were deconvoluted. The D band and G band indicative of carbon species were observed (Fig. S5†), where the D4 band at 1193 cm−1, the D1 band at 1339 cm−1, and the D3 band at 1496 cm−1 were assigned to disordered graphitic lattices, disordered graphitic lattices, and amorphous carbon, respectively. The G band at 1593 cm−1 was ascribed to crystallized graphite lattices.39–41 The graphitization degree of carbon deposition was quantitatively compared using the ratio of D1/G (Table 4). That is, the higher the ratio, the more carbon there was with a disordered graphitic structure which was easily eliminated. After the OPDH-CO2 reaction for 340 min, Fe2O3–3ZrO2 showed the least amount of carbon and the highest value of D1/G. In this case, further transformation of the carbonaceous species into crystallized graphite could be prevented, which was advantageous to carbon elimination via the reverse Boudouard process. As a result, the decline in activity was slower.

The aforementioned discussion demonstrated that the active phases of the catalysts and carbon deposition affected the activity performance. For the OPDH-CO2 reaction on Fe2O3–3ZrO2, the stable and active Fe3O4 phase and the appropriate acid–base properties from the interaction between the iron species and ZrO2 substantially promoted the C3H8(CO2) conversion. And carbon deposition was lowered remarkably through prevention of a higher degree of graphitization of the deposited carbon and through the reverse Boudouard reaction, which was responsible for the slow decay in activity. The selectivity of the main product C3H6 remained stable and even underwent a slight rise due to inhibition of the side reaction of cracking on the adjusted acid sites.42 By contrast, the transition of the active phase and rapid carbon deposition existed during the PDH reaction on Fe2O3–3ZrO2.
The catalytic cycle during OPDH-CO2 on Fe2O3–nZrO2 was proposed, as depicted in Fig. 11. During the course of the reaction, adsorption of C3H8 was promoted on the medium-strong acid sites on the surface, and it was oxidized to produce C3H6. It was speculated that Fe3O4 was reduced to FeOx (some lower oxidation state of iron, with x in the range of 4/3–1). On the other hand, adsorption of CO2 was promoted on the medium-strong base sites, and it was reduced to CO by FeOx. FeOx was oxidized to Fe3O4 (rather than Fe2O3), regaining Fe3O4, as shown in reactions (3) and (4), considering the FeOx species
Fe3O4 + (4 − 3x)C3H8 → 3FeOx + (4 − 3x)C3H6 + (4 − 3x)H2O (3)
3FeOx + (4 − 3x)CO2 → Fe3O4 + (4 − 3x)CO (4)
could not be fully oxidized to Fe(iii) by CO2 under the reaction conditions because it is thermodynamically disadvantageous.43 Fe3O4 was hardly reduced further to Fe(0) due to the interaction between the iron species and ZrO2 (see Fig. 4 and Table 2). To sum up, the catalytic cycle involved reduction and oxidation steps. It is worth noting that carbon deposition affected the durability of the catalytic cycle. More effective inhibition of carbon deposition on Fe2O3–nZrO2 needs to be further solved. In contrast, during the reaction course of PDH on Fe2O3–nZrO2, Fe3O4 was reduced to Fe (Fig. 5a and Table 2) by the product H2 along with reduction by C3H8. The main product quickly changed from the initial C3H6 to CH4, and then finally to carbon (Fig. 9).

Conclusions
Fe2O3 with an appropriate combination of ZrO2 obtained using the oxalate coprecipitation method exhibited high catalytic activity toward the OPDH-CO2 reaction at 550 °C and normal pressure. The interaction between the iron species and ZrO2, on the one hand, preserved the active Fe3O4 phase for the PDH step to propylene; specifically, the reductive restoration of Fe3O4 from FeOx was promoted, whereas the formation of Fe was inhibited. On the other hand, the interaction adjusted the acid/base properties of the catalyst to promote the respective adsorption of propane and CO2. Fe2O3–3ZrO2 with more medium-strong acidic sites and weak medium-strong basic sites showed initial propane and CO2 conversions of 39.9% and 28.2%, respectively, a propylene yield of 33.4% at the set contact time, and the slowest decline in activity. Furthermore, the acid property of Fe2O3–3ZrO2 was the main cause of methane formation through the reaction of propylene with CO2 rather than Fe-promoted propane cracking as occurs during PDH. The slow decline in the Fe2O3–3ZrO2 activity was attributed to carbon deposition. Additionally, the oxidation of CO2 also contributed to the prevention of FeOx transitioning to Fe.
