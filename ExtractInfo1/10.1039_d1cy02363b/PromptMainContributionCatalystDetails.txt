Defect-stabilized nickel on beta zeolite as a promising catalyst for dry reforming of methane†
Four different Ni-containing beta zeolite (Ni-BEA) catalysts were synthesized and applied for dry reforming of methane (DRM). Nickel silicate Ni-BEA(I) was synthesized via the single-step interzeolite transformation of nickel silicate MWW (Ni-MWW(I)). Ni-BEA(II) was synthesized via the interzeolite transformation of borosilicate MWW (B-MWW) into B-BEA, followed by Ni implantation. Ni-BEA(III) was synthesized employing the reverse order of the aforementioned two-step process, i.e., the implantation of Ni in B-MWW and the interzeolite transformation into Ni-BEA(III). Ni-BEA(IV) was prepared via the incipient wetness impregnation of Ni on H-beta. Although the four Ni-BEA catalysts exhibited a *BEA-type structure, the chemical state of Ni and surface properties (the silanol defects) varied significantly with respect to the synthetic conditions. The stabilization of the metallic Ni clusters by the defect hydroxyls on *BEA was calculated via density functional theory. Further, Ni-BEA(I) and Ni-BEA(II) containing defect-stabilized Ni exhibited high catalytic activity and stability toward DRM.
Introduction
Supported metal catalysts have been extensively utilized in many commercial processes because of their intrinsic characteristics, such as easy separation from the reactants and products, synergistic strong metal–support interaction (SMSI), and economic feasibility, owing to the high dispersion of active metals.1,2 Among various inorganic supports, zeolites are considered a promising candidate owing to their unique characteristics, including high surface areas and porosities, facilitating the high dispersion of active metal species, and excellent hydrothermal stability.3,4 The shape selectivity of unique zeolitic pore-structure-driven catalysis also benefits many applications.5 There are several synthetic methods for preparing highly dispersed metal-supported inorganic catalysts, and the most common method involves the impregnation of a metal precursor solution into supports, such as silica or alumina, followed by its precipitation. The ion-exchange method can be applied to supports, such as zeolites, exhibiting cation exchange properties. Additionally, the extraction of the framework metal atoms from crystalline metallosilicates represents another effective method for achieving highly dispersed metal-supported catalysts.6
Different transition metals (Ti, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) and post-transition metals (Ga, In, and Sn) can be incorporated into zeolite frameworks to generate metallosilicate molecular sieves; further, the high dispersion of metals can be achieved via in situ or ex situ extraction.7–9 Generally, there are two methods, namely the top-down and bottom-up methods, for synthesizing framework-incorporated metallosilicate materials. The top-down method involves the post-synthetic implantation of metals into the defect sites of dealuminated or deboronated zeolites employing metal precursor solutions, and the bottom-up method involves the hydrothermal crystallization of metal-containing mother liquor. Moreover, the bottom-up method ensures a more stable and uniform metal dispersion without compromising the crystallinity of the zeolites compared with the top-down approach. Interzeolite transformation (the conversion of three-dimensional (3D) zeolite structures into another zeolitic phase under hydrothermal conditions) is a promising bottom-up synthetic approach for developing metallosilicates and aluminosilicates.10–15 The syntheses of different heteroatom (Ti, Fe, Ga, and Sn)-substituted CHA-type zeolites from relevant heteroatom-substituted FAU-type zeolites have been reported.13,14 Additionally, the interzeolite transformation of titanosilicate MWW into *BEA-type zeolites was achieved via hydrothermal heating within only a few hours; it exhibited outstanding performance in the selective oxidation of cyclohexene.15
Furthermore, the high dispersion of metal species on the zeolite catalysts can be achieved by imparting the support with specific functionalities. Among the most promising methods of increasing the dispersion of active metals, the introduction of defect sites on zeolite supports can increase the catalytic activity and stability of zeolites.16–18 Wannapakdee et al. reported the enhanced metal–support interaction between ultrasmall Pt nanoparticles and the silanol defects on silicalite-1 (framework type MFI), which increased its propylene selectivity (95%) in propane dehydrogenation.16 Ganjkhanlou et al. reported that the hydroxyl groups (the Brønsted acids and hydrogen-bonded silanols) and surface defects (the strained Si–O–Si bridges) on the external surface of Ni2+-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite (MFI) accounted for the most important factors that affected the dispersion and redox properties of Ni.17 Additionally, Ni-supported silicalite-1 with controlled concentrations of defect sites was synthesized to investigate the role of the silanol groups in dry reforming of methane (DRM);18 the high concentration of defect sites promoted the formation of nickel silicates, and improved the overall catalytic performance.
DRM (CH4 + CO2 → 2H2 + 2CO, = 247 kJ mol−1), which represents a very promising strategy for producing syngas (H2 + CO) from the two most harmful greenhouse gases (CH4 and CO2), has been extensively studied. Regarding syngas composition, an H2/CO ratio of ∼1.0 particularly favors the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis of hydrocarbons.18–23 Further, Ni has been the most widely studied transition metal as a primary active species in DRM catalysts because of its high activity and cost efficiency. However, Ni-based catalysts are generally susceptible to deactivation during sintering because of their low Tamman temperature (690 °C).24 Furthermore, catalyst deactivation via coke formation is another obstacle to the commercialization of DRM.
In this study, we prepared four different Ni-containing beta zeolites (Ni-BEA) via the single-step or two-step interzeolite transformation of MWW-type zeolites (Scheme 1) and applied them to DRM. Based on the differences in the synthetic methods, the silanol defects in the Ni-BEA catalysts, which were analyzed via IR spectroscopy in the hydroxyl region (OH-IR), 1H MAS NMR, and 29Si MAS NMR techniques, were controlled. It was observed that the concentration of the silanol defects on the catalysts influenced the dispersion of active metallic Ni, which directly affected the DRM activity.

Experimental section
Synthesis of the Ni-supported catalysts
A borosilicate MWW precursor (B-MWW(P)) (Si/B ratio = 9.5) was synthesized employing hexamethyleneimine (99%, Sigma–Aldrich) as the organic structure-directing agent (SDA), following a previously reported procedure.25 Nickel silicate Ni-MWW(i) was synthesized via the hydrothermal treatment of B-MWW(P) with 1.0 M nickel(ii) nitrate hexahydrate (98%, Samchun) aqueous solution at 100 °C for 4 d, following our recent report.26 To prepare Ni-BEA(i) and B-BEA(ii) from the interzeolite transformations of Ni-MWW(i) and B-MWW, respectively, the as-synthesized Ni-MWW(i) and B-MWW(P) samples were calcined at 550 °C for 8 h to remove the occluded organic SDA.
The single-step interzeolite transformation of Ni-MWW(i) into Ni-BEA(i) was performed, following a previous report.15 The calcined Ni-MWW(i) and siliceous beta seed (corresponding to 0.1 wt% of total SiO2) were dissolved in a tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH, 35%, Aldrich) solution, after which NH4F (98%, Junsei) was added to obtain the final molar composition (0.3TEAOH·0.5HF·1.0SiO2). After homogenizing the mother gel, the mixture was dried at 80 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the dried mixture was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 190 °C for 12 h. Finally, the as-synthesized Ni-BEA(i) was calcined at 550 °C for 8 h to remove the occluded organic SDA.
Ni-BEA(ii) and Ni-BEA(iii) were prepared via the two-step interzeolite transformation and incipient wetness impregnation processes. In the first step, B-BEA(ii) was synthesized via the interzeolite transformation of the calcined B-MWW, following the same procedure as for Ni-BEA(i). In the second step, Ni-BEA(ii) was prepared via top-down deboronation (1.0 g of the zeolite powder was refluxed with 20 mL of 13 M nitric acid aqueous solution at 100 °C for 24 h) and incipient wetness impregnation employing a nickel(ii) nitrate aqueous solution to obtain 5 wt% Ni. Ni-BEA(iii) was synthesized, following the reverse order of Ni-BEA(ii). Namely, the top-down preparation of Ni-MWW(iii) from B-MWW proceeded first before the sequential interzeolite transformation of Ni-MWW(iii) into Ni-BEA(iii). Finally, the as-synthesized Ni-BEA(ii) and Ni-BEA(iii) samples were calcined in ambient air at 550 °C for 3 h.
For comparison, Ni-BEA(iv) and Ni–γ-Al2O3 were prepared via the incipient wetness impregnations of 5 wt% Ni into commercial NH4-beta (Si/Al = 12.5, Zeolyst) and γ-Al2O3 (Condea), respectively, employing the nickel(ii) nitrate aqueous solution. These Ni-impregnated catalysts were dried overnight at 100 °C, after which they were calcined in ambient air at 550 °C for 3 h.
Characterization of the Ni-catalysts
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation in the 2θ range of 3–50° (scan rate = 4° min−1). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed in air on a Hitachi STA7200 thermal analyzer. In the analysis, the weight losses associated with the combustion of the organic SDA and coke were further confirmed via differential thermal analysis (DTA) employing the same analyzer. The N2 sorption experiments were performed on a Micromeritics Tristar II analyzer. The surface area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) equation, and the external surface area was determined using the t-plot method. Elemental analysis was performed on a PerkinElmer OPTIMA 7300DV inductively coupled plasma (ICP) spectrometer. The crystal morphology and average size were determined via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) employing a Hitachi SU8010 that was operated at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging was performed on an FEI TALOS F200X that was operated at 200 kV. The H2 chemisorption measurements were conducted on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. After the pre-reduction in flowing pure H2 at 700 °C for 1 h, the catalyst (0.1 g) was cooled to 35 °C in He, after which chemisorption was performed at that temperature.
UV diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) was performed on a Shimadzu UV-2600 UV–vis spectrophotometer. The UV absorption spectra were plotted employing the Kubelka–Munk function. The IR spectra in the structural region were acquired employing a Shimadzu IRTracer-100 FT-IR spectrometer in the ATR mode. The OH-IR spectra were also recorded on the same analyzer. A self-supporting solid wafer (∼20 mg, diameter = 1.3 cm) was mounted inside a home-built IR cell, pretreated in a He flow (100 cm3 min−1) at 450 °C for 2 h, and the IR spectra were consecutively collected at the same temperature. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a PHI 5000 Versa Probe II with Al-Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV), and the spectra were refined employing the binding energy of adventitious carbon (C 1s, 284.6 eV) as the standard. The XPS samples were prepared with self-supporting wafers (∼20 mg and diameter = 1.3 cm) under dry conditions. The 1H and 29Si MAS NMR spectra were recorded on a 500 MHz Avance III HD Bruker solid-state NMR spectrometer at spinning rates of 10 (1H) and 5 (29Si) kHz. The 1H MAS NMR spectra were obtained with an acquisition of ∼30 pulse transients, which was repeated with a π/6 rad pulse length of 2.5 μs and a recycle delay of 5 s. The 29Si MAS NMR spectra were measured at a 29Si frequency of 99.36 MHz with a π/2 rad pulse length of 4 μs, a recycle delay of 60 s, and an acquisition of ∼300 pulse transients. The 1H and 29Si chemical shifts were reported relative to tetramethylsilane. All the spectral decomposition and simulation operations were performed with the Origin 9.0 curve-fitting function.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
The DFT calculations were conducted under the periodic boundary condition employing the DMol3 software with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) function of the generalized gradient approximation, as implemented in the Materials Studio 7.0.27–29 Although only the gamma k-point and 4.4 version of the DNP basis set were applied, the SCF tolerance and maximum angular momentum function were set at 1.0 × 10−6 and hexadecapole, respectively. Thermal smearing of 0.02 Ha was applied when Ni atoms were included. The convergence tolerances for the geometry optimization are as follows: energy, 1.0 × 10−5 Ha; max. force, 0.002 Ha Å−1; max. displacement, 0.005 Å. The starting, idealized *BEA silica structure was downloaded from the Database of Zeolite Structures and optimized by the PBE functional with symmetry while fully relaxing all the atomic positions.30 To construct the defect model, a Si atom was removed at the T5 site of the DFT-optimized *BEA structure where Al atoms are reportedly prone to dealumination.31 The four terminal O atoms were automatically capped by H atoms using the Materials Studio 7.0 software. Afterward, only the H atoms were optimized consecutively by the universal force field (UFF) and PBE function;32 all the atoms were optimized at the DFT level. Ni6 was selected as a representative metallic Ni cluster model, which is the most stable Ni cluster with an octahedral structure.33 The initial locations of the octahedral Ni6 cluster were established for the DFT calculation employing UFF with the simulated annealing technique to ensure that they were located near the T5 site and the defect. The binding energy (EB) of the Ni6 clusters was calculated by the following equation: EB = Ecomplex − Ezeolite − Ecluster, where Ecomplex, Ezeolite, and Ecluster are the energies of the zeolite structure, including the Ni6 cluster, the Ni-free zeolite structure, and the isolated Ni6 cluster, respectively.
DRM catalysis
The catalytic experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure in a continuous-flow apparatus comprising a fixed-bed microreactor. Before the experiments, the catalyst was routinely prereduced in flowing H2 (50 cm3 min−1) at 700 °C for 3 h, purged with N2 (60 cm3 min−1) at the same temperature for 0.5 h, and maintained at the reaction temperature (700 °C) to establish a standard operating procedure that afforded sufficient time for stable reactant/carrier gas distributions. The feed gas stream comprised CH4, CO2, and N2 that were supplied at rates of 40, 40, and 20 cm3 min−1 to the reactor containing 0.1 g of the catalyst (gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) = 60 000 cm3 gcat−1 h−1), respectively. The reaction products were analyzed online employing a Scion 456 gas chromatograph, which was equipped with a Carbosphere packed column (60–80 mesh, 1830 mm × 3.2 mm × 2.0 mm) and a thermal conductivity detector, and the first analysis was performed after 10 min on stream. N2 in the feed stream was employed as an internal standard to compensate for the changes in the concentration due to volume expansion after DRM. The mole balanced conversions and H2/CO ratios were calculated as follows:
CH4 conversion (%) = {(CH4)in − (CH4)out}/(CH4)in × 100
CO2 conversion (%) = {(CO2)in − (CO2)out}/(CO2)in × 100
H2/CO ratio = [(H2)out/2(CH4)in]/[(CO)out/{(CH4)in + (CO2)in}]
Here, (CH4)in and (CO2)in are the initial concentrations of CH4 and CO2, respectively, and (CH4)out, (CO2)out, (H2)out, and (CO)out are the final concentrations of CH4, CO2, H2, and CO, respectively.
The turnover frequency (TOF) was also calculated as follows:
TOF = FCH4 × XCH4,initial/(W × MWNi−1 × DNi)
Here, FCH4 is the inlet flow rate of CH4 (mol s−1), XCH4,initial is the initial conversion (%) of CH4, W is the total mass of Ni (g) in the catalyst, MWNi is the molecular weight of Ni (g mol−1), and DNi is the dispersion (%) of Ni in each catalyst determined by H2 chemisorption.
Results and discussion
Syntheses and characterization of the Ni-BEA catalysts
Fig. 1a shows the powder XRD patterns of all the Ni-containing catalysts that were prepared in this study. The catalysts, including 5 wt% Ni-impregnated Ni-BEA(iv) and Ni/γ-Al2O3, did not exhibit X-ray peaks that corresponded to NiO and metallic Ni at 2θ of ∼43° and 44°, respectively, indicating the high dispersion of the Ni species. A comparison of the XRD patterns of Ni-BEA(i) with its parent Ni-MWW(i) reveals the total transformation of the MWW phase into a pure *BEA structure after 12 h of hydrothermal crystallization. Fig. 1b shows that the spherical agglomerates (ca. 5.0 nm), which were composed of the plate-like crystals of Ni-MWW(i), were completely transformed into irregularly shaped Ni-BEA(i) crystals (average size ∼200 nm). These results indicate the interzeolite transformation of Ni-MWW(i) into Ni-BEA(i). The interconversion of borosilicate B-MWW also yielded fully crystallized B-BEA(ii) exhibiting a pure *BEA structure at the same crystallization time (Fig. S1†). Further, these results agree well with those in the literature regarding the formation of Ti-BEA via the interconversion of Ti-MWW under similar conditions.15 Thus, many metal-substituted M-BEA metallosilicates can be synthesized via the interzeolite transformation of corresponding M-MWW zeolites.

Fig. 1 and S1† show that the intensity of Ni-BEA(ii), which was prepared via the top-down approach, was slightly lower than that of Ni-BEA(i) even though the intensities of the XRD peaks of B-BEA(ii) and Ni-BEA(i) were not significantly different. This might be due to the partial collapse of the zeolite structure via the acid treatment and calcination during the top-down preparation, as well as its smaller crystal size than that of Ni-BEA(i). Additionally, Table 1 reveals that the higher Si/B ratio (140) and external surface area (97 m2 g−1) of Ni-BEA(ii) than those of the other *BEA-type catalysts demonstrate its successful deboronation via acid treatment and its small crystal size, respectively.

Interestingly, the intensity of the XRD peaks of Ni-MWW(iii), which was prepared via the top-down approach, was much higher than those of Ni-MWW(i) and its parent, B-MWW (Fig. 1a and S1†). The most intense peak at 2θ = 7.1° (100), a characteristic of intra-layer reflections (hk0), indicates the further condensation of incomplete 2D MWW layers into a 3D structure via calcination and Ni implantation. Fig. 1b shows that the morphology of Ni-MWW(i) comprised agglomerates of thin plates, whereas that of Ni-MWW(iii) comprised agglomerates of thick crystals. Thus, the H3-type hysteresis loop in the N2 sorption isotherm of Ni-MWW(i) was not observed in Ni-MWW(iii), indicating the extinction of interparticle voids between the sheet-shaped crystals (Fig. S2†). This result was further confirmed by the significantly lower external surface area (27 m2 g−1) of Ni-MWW(iii) compared with that (109 m2 g−1) of Ni-MWW(i) (Table 1). Notably, the Si/B ratios (140 each) of Ni-MWW(iii) and Ni-BEA(ii) were identical because both catalysts were prepared via the same top-down synthetic procedure. Ni-BEA(iii), which was synthesized via the interzeolite transformation of Ni-MWW(iii) exhibited several XRD peaks of unknown phases, and its BET surface area (385 m2 g−1) was the lowest among those of the *BEA-type catalysts. Additionally, Ni-BEA(iv), which was prepared from the commercial H-beta zeolite, exhibited the highest BET surface area (520 m2 g−1) among the *BEA-type catalysts.
The coordination states of the Ni species in the four Ni-BEA catalysts were characterized via UV-DRS. Fig. 2a shows that the UV absorption bands in the Ni-BEA catalysts were divided into three: a sharp band at 200 nm, a broad band at 250–300 nm, and a weak and broad band at 350–550 nm; these bands were assignable to the charge-transfer transitions from oxygen into Ni2+ ions in the framework Ni species, the electronic transition from the valence band to the conduction band in the NiO semiconductors, and the typical characteristics of NiO nanostructures, respectively.34 Notably, the fully interconverted Ni-BEA(i) exhibited a prominent UV absorption band, which corresponded to the framework Ni species, at 200 nm. It also exhibited an additional small band around 400 nm, corresponding to the NiO nanoparticles. Contrarily, the other Ni-BEA catalysts exhibited dominant UV absorption bands at 250–300 nm, indicating that the Ni species therein existed as NiO. Fig. S3a† shows that Ni-MWW(i) also exhibited a dominant UV absorption band at 200 nm, as well as a small shoulder at 250–300 nm, indicating the coexistence of nickel silicates and NiO in the catalyst. However, the NiO species in Ni-MWW(i) was transformed into nickel silicates in Ni-BEA(i) during the interzeolite transformation, as evidenced by the significant reduction in the band at 250–300 nm. Dissimilar to the Ni-MWW(i), the nickel silicate (200 nm) proportion of Ni-MWW(iii) was much lower. The overall results of the UV-DRS study indicated that the nickel silicate form of Ni-BEA cannot be obtained via the top-down preparation method; it could only be synthesized via the bottom-up approach, i.e., hydrothermal crystallization, including interzeolite transformation.
Fig. 2 (a) UV-DRS, (b) structural region IR spectra, and (c) Ni 2p XPS spectra of the Ni-BEA(i), Ni-BEA(ii), Ni-BEA(iii), and Ni-BEA(iv) catalysts.
Fig. 2b and S3b† show the structural region IR spectra of the four Ni-BEA catalysts and their parent MWW-type zeolites, respectively. The interzeolite transformed Ni-BEA(i), Ni-BEA(ii), and Ni-BEA(iii) catalysts exhibited distinct IR bands at 525 and 573 cm−1, corresponding to six- and five-membered rings that are the periodic building units of the *BEA structure, respectively.35,36 Ni-BEA(iv) exhibited relatively broad IR bands in this region, and this correlates with its relatively low crystallinity, as determined via powder XRD and SEM (Fig. 1). Further, Ni-BEA(i), Ni-BEA(ii), and Ni-BEA(iii) exhibited strong IR bands, which originate from the Si–O–Si asymmetric stretching vibration of the tetrahedral framework, at 1080 cm−1.35 Conversely, Ni-BEA(iv) exhibited the highest peak intensity at ∼20 cm−1 lower than that at 1080 cm−1 owing to Al in the aluminosilicate framework.35 Dissimilar to the two other interconverted Ni-BEA catalysts, Ni-BEA(i) exhibited an additional shoulder at 1020 cm−1, and this corresponded to the asymmetric stretching vibration of the Si–O–Ni framework, as also weakly observed in its parent, Ni-MWW(i).26 These results further confirmed the synthesis of the nickel silicate Ni-BEA(i) and Ni-MWW(i) catalysts. However, the UV-DRS results (Fig. 2a) revealed that the characteristic IR band for framework Ni was only very weakly observed in Ni-MWW(iii) and Ni-BEA(iii). Fig. S4† shows that the structural region IR spectra of the samples that were obtained during the interzeolite transformation of Ni-MWW(i), i.e., the 0 h sample, which still maintained the MWW phase, exhibited a strong IR band at 1020 cm−1, inferring that the Ni-bounding sub-building units are required to achieve the formation of a 3D nickel silicate *BEA structure during the interzeolite transformation. However, the characteristic IR band (1020 cm−1) of Si–O–Ni disappeared even though the *BEA structure of Ni-BEA(i) was preserved after reduction at 700 °C in a H2 flow, indicating the extraction of the framework Ni species (Fig. S5a and b†).
The chemical states of the Ni species in the surface region of the Ni-containing catalysts prepared in this study were characterized via Ni 2p XPS (Fig. 2c and S3c, as well as Table S1†). The Ni 2p peaks are generally classified into two spin–orbit doublets at 872–877 eV (Ni 2p1/2) and 854–859 eV (Ni 2p3/2), and their shake-up satellite peaks are centered around 880 and 862 eV, respectively.37,38 Ni-MWW(i) displayed only one Ni 2p3/2 peak at 856.2, while the corresponding spectrum of Ni-BEA(i) was divided into two peaks, which correspond to nickel silicates, at 856.6 and 858.4 eV.39–41 Further, Ni-BEA(i) and Ni-MWW(i) exhibited the highest Ni 2p XPS intensity compared to the other Ni-containing catalysts despite the almost similar intensity of Si 2p XPS spectra for all zeolitic Ni-catalysts studied here (Fig. S6†). The Si/Ni ratios of these two catalysts determined by XPS were also the lowest among all catalysts (Table S1†). These results indicate that the framework Ni was well dispersed even on the external surfaces of these two daughter and parent zeolites. Conversely, the other Ni-MWW and Ni-BEA catalysts exhibited Ni 2p XPS spectra, which shifted toward a lower binding energy than those of previous nickel silicate Ni-MWW(i) and Ni-BEA(i), indicating that the Ni phase on the external surfaces of these catalysts existed mainly as NiO.42,43 Concurrently, dissimilar to Ni-BEA(ii), Ni-BEA(iv), and Ni-MWW(iii), which exhibited low intensity Ni 2p XPS peaks, Ni-BEA(iii) exhibited a much higher peak intensity, indicating that most of the Ni species were introduced into the micropores of the former three zeolites via impregnation, whereas regarding the latter, Ni was neither found in the framework nor inside the pores even though a fully crystallized *BEA structure was formed during the second bottom-up interconversion process of the two-step synthesis; the Ni species was mainly distributed on the external surface, which blocked the micropores of Ni-BEA(iii) and imparted it with the lowest micropore surface area compared with those of the other three Ni-BEA catalysts (Table 1).
Fig. 3a shows the OH-IR spectra of the four Ni-BEA catalysts. The IR spectrum of Ni-BEA(iv) displayed two distinct absorption bands, which are assignable to the terminal silanols (Si–OH) and bridging OH groups (Si–OH–Al, Brønsted acid), at 3732 and 3594 cm−1, respectively. These bands are the typical OH-IR bands of aluminosilicate zeolites.44 Among the four Ni-BEA catalysts, Ni-BEA(iv) exhibited the highest terminal silanol concentration, which is related to the fact that it exhibited the smallest crystal size (Fig. 1b) and highest BET surface area (Table 1). However, a sharp IR absorption band was observed at ca. 3621 cm−1 for Ni-BEA(i); it was ca. 30 cm−1 blue-shifted compared with that of aluminosilicate Si–OH–Al (3594 cm−1). This is probably due to the OH groups in the Si–OH–Ni moieties since it was much weaker in the other three Ni-BEA catalysts. Furthermore, Ni-BEA(i) exhibited an additional broad IR band at 3690 cm−1, which is the region of the silanol defect groups. Generally, the IR absorption band of the silanol groups that interacted with the defect sites was red-shifted compared with the terminal silanols because of the influence of hydrogen bonding with neighboring OH groups.44 Since the Si/(B + Ni) ratio (10.8) of Ni-BEA(i) was higher than the Si/B ratio (9.5) of B-MWW (Table 1), these defects were suspected to have originated from the deboronated site at which Ni could not be implanted during the single-step interzeolite transformation. However, the highest concentration of the defect groups was observed in Ni-BEA(ii), while the intensity of this band was significantly reduced in the cases of Ni-BEA(iii) and Ni-BEA(iv). Although both Ni-BEA(ii) and Ni-BEA(iii) were synthesized via the two-step preparation, the preparation of the former ended with top-down Ni implantation, while the latter ended with interzeolite transformation. Thus, Ni-BEA(ii) exhibited a much higher concentration of defect sites owing to the presence of empty deboronated sites, whereas the sites in Ni-BEA(iii) were healed during interzeolite transformation.

The silanol defects in the four Ni-BEA catalysts were further characterized via1H and 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy. Fig. 3b shows that Ni-BEA(i) exhibited a sharp 1H resonance, which can be assigned to the isolated Si–OH, at 5.0 ppm.45 Notably, Ni-BEA(ii) exhibited a 1H resonance of the isolated silanol groups, as well as a strong additional 1H resonance around 7 ppm, probably due to the Si–OH groups that participated in hydrogen bonding with neighboring SiO− groups, i.e., SiOH⋯SiO− hydrogen bonded OH groups.46,47 Additionally, the 1H resonance of Ni-BEA(i) increased at 7 ppm after the reduction with H2 at 700 °C, and this indicated the formation of the defect sites via the extraction of framework Ni (Fig. S5c†). The OH-IR results reveal that the concentration of the defect sites on Ni-BEA(iii) was much lower than that on Ni-BEA(ii). Conversely, Ni-BEA(iv) exhibited a broad 1H resonance at ∼4 ppm, and this could be attributed to the hydrophilic characteristics, such as the adsorption of water onto the Brønsted acid sites and external silanols, of this material. This finding was confirmed by the five-times-higher water content of Ni-BEA(iv) than that of Ni-BEA(i), as measured via TGA (Fig. S7†). Fig. 3c shows that all the four Ni-BEA catalysts exhibited common 29Si resonances at −120, −115, and −111 ppm, which were all attributed to Q4(4Si).48 Additional broad 29Si resonances were observed in Ni-BEA(iv) in the downfield region; they might correspond to a combination of Q4(nAl) and external silanol Q3(1OH). Simultaneously, Ni-BEA(i) and Ni-BEA(ii) also exhibited weak 29Si resonances in this region probably due to the combination of Q4(nNi) via Ni substitution in the tetrahedral framework and Q3 silanol defects.26,46,47
Fig. 4 and S8† show the STEM-EDS images of the Ni-containing zeolite catalysts that were prepared in this study. Notably, the STEM images of Ni-BEA(i) and Ni-MWW(i) did not show any distinct Ni particle despite the considerable amount (∼10 wt%) of highly dispersed Ni, which originated from the nickel silicate frameworks of these catalysts, as observed in the EDS images. Although the Ni contents, as determined via STEM-EDS, were higher than those obtained via the ICP analyses for Ni-BEA(i) and Ni-MWW(i) (Table 1), both results revealed that the Ni content of Ni-BEA(i) was ca. 1.5 times higher than that of Ni-MWW(i), indicating the additional loss of boron during the hydrothermal interzeolite transformation of Ni-MWW(i) into Ni-BEA(i), as further confirmed via the increased Si/B ratio (19.0 vs. 42.4) of the latter catalyst (Table 1). Further, the Ni particles in Ni-BEA(iii) were the most heterogeneous among others in the prepared catalysts, indicating the extraframework Ni species in Ni-MWW(iii); they formed large agglomerates during interzeolite transformation. This agglomeration which is the largest as determined via STEM accounted for the extremely low dispersion (∼0.2%) of Ni, as calculated via the chemisorption of H2 (Table 1). Dissimilar to the invisible Ni particles in Ni-BEA(i), distinct and uniform metallic Ni particles with 11 nm were observed in the STEM image of Ni-BEA(i) after H2 reduction at 700 °C (Fig. S5d†). Owing to this in situ formation of uniform metallic Ni particles in Ni-BEA(i), it accounted for the highest Ni dispersion (3.7%) among the four Ni-BEA catalysts, as measured via H2 chemisorption (Table 1). These results demonstrate that Ni-BEA(i) could function as a supported metallic Ni catalyst after appropriate pretreatments. The STEM-EDS and H2 chemisorption results indicated that Ni-BEA(ii) and prereduced Ni-BEA(i) exhibited similar Ni particle sizes and distribution. Further, Ni was highly dispersed in Ni-MWW(i) and Ni-MWW(iii) owing to the formation of nickel silicates and the stabilization from the defect sites, respectively.

DFT calculations were conducted to investigate the binding energy of metallic Ni clusters according to the silanol defect site of the *BEA structure. Fig. 5 shows the DFT-optimized Ni6 clusters in the pure silica *BEA structures with and without defect sites. The distances between the Ni atoms and framework O atoms in the defect-free structure were determined to be ∼3 Å whereas those between a proton in the terminal OH and the Ni atoms were characteristically shorter (2.57–2.88 Å). Owing to this strong interaction, we obtained lower binding energy (−198.8 vs. −179.2 kJ mol−1) values for the Ni6 cluster exhibiting the defective structure than for the intact one, practically demonstrating the stabilization of the metallic Ni clusters by the defect sites in the *BEA support.

DRM catalysis
Fig. 6 shows the conversions of CH4 and CO2, as well as the H2/CO ratio as a function of time-on-stream (TOS), over the supported Ni catalysts that were prepared in this study for DRM employing a 40 vol% CH4 + 40 vol% CO2 feed stream (balanced with N2) with a GHSV of 60 000 cm3 gcat−1 h−1 at 700 °C (the overall catalytic results are summarized in Table S2†). The initial conversions of CH4 and CO2 employing the three Ni-BEA catalysts, which were synthesized via single- or two-step interzeolite transformation, were in the following order: Ni-BEA(i) > Ni-BEA(ii) > Ni-BEA(iii). Notably, Ni-BEA(i) and Ni-BEA(ii) facilitated the higher conversions of both CH4 and CO2 than Ni–γ-Al2O3, which is the commonest catalyst for DRM.19,20 Although Ni-BEA(i) maintained its initial crystallinity of a *BEA structure even after 12 h of reaction (Fig. S9a†), the IR band (3621 cm−1) corresponding to Si–OH–Ni disappeared (Fig. S9b†). Concurrently, the intensity of the IR band related to the Si–OH defects increased, and blue shifting was observed, indicating the formation of the defect sites via the extraction of framework Ni in Ni-BEA(i) (Fig. S9b†). In addition, although the XRD peak for metallic Ni at 2θ = 44.5° can be negligible in the spent Ni-BEA(i) (Fig. S9a†), the Ni 2p XPS peak assigned to nickel silicate was significantly decreased but the peak for metallic Ni at 853 eV was newly observed in Ni-BEA(i) after the DRM reaction (Fig. S9c†).49 Thus, it was assumed that the highly dispersed metallic Ni was formed in situ on the external surface of Ni-BEA(i) during the reaction; concurrently a strong interaction proceeded between active Ni and the *BEA support because of the high density of the defect sites, which all contributed to the best DRM activity of Ni-BEA(i) compared with those of the other three Ni-BEA catalysts. In addition, the TOF of Ni-BEA(i) was calculated as 4.4 s−1, which is higher than any other catalysts reported in the literature (Table S3†).50–53 Conversely, Ni-MWW(i) showed the highest conversions of CH4 and CO2 and exhibited the best stability among the employed catalysts owing to the in situ formation of metallic Ni particles with the highest dispersion, these particles were also stabilized by the defect sites.

Although Ni-BEA(ii) showed lower conversions of CH4 and CO2 compared with Ni-BEA(i) owing to the combined effects of a lower Ni content (5.9 vs. 7.3 wt%), BET surface area (454 vs. 481 m2 g−1), and Ni dispersion (3.6 vs. 3.7%), both catalysts achieved similar stabilities owing to the stabilization of the Ni particles by the defect sites in Ni-BEA(ii). Fig. S9b† shows that the concentration of the silanol defects in Ni-BEA(ii) was preserved after DRM at 700 °C for 12 h. Owing to the preserved silanol defects in Ni-BEA(ii), the weaker XRD peak for metallic Ni at 2θ = 44.5° than those for Ni-BEA(iii) and Ni-BEA(iv) was observed in Fig. S9a.† Contrarily, Ni-BEA(iii) achieved much lower initial conversions of CH4 and CO2 than Ni-BEA(i) and Ni-BEA(ii) because of the heterogeneous distributions of the Ni particles due to the weak Ni–support interaction. Fig. S9a† shows that Ni-BEA(iii) exhibited a strong XRD peak corresponding to metallic Ni (111) at 2θ = 44.5° after DRM at 700 °C for 12 h. Conversely, Ni-MWW(iii) exhibited even lower initial activity and catalytic stability (deactivation rates for CH4 and CO2 conversions were >50%, Table S2†) than its daughter, Ni-BEA(iii), despite the higher Ni dispersion of the fresh catalyst (Table 1). Fig. S9a† shows that the crystal structure of Ni-MWW(iii) changed completely after DRM, and new unidentified peaks were observed probably because of the structural instability of the defective MWW layers that were prepared via the top-down acid treatment and high-temperature heat treatments. Ni-BEA(iv) exhibited a considerably higher initial activity than Ni-BEA(ii), but it was continuously deactivated with TOS (deactivation rates of both CH4 and CO2 were >20%, Table S2†). Similar to Ni-BEA(iii), Ni-BEA(iv) exhibited an XRD peak of metallic Ni (111) after DRM. Thus, the overall results of our study experimentally and theoretically demonstrate the stabilization of Ni particles by the defect sites in the support of a Ni-BEA zeolite catalyst.
Conclusions
Four Ni-BEA zeolites with different defect characteristics were synthesized by combining the hydrothermal interzeolite transformation of MWW-type zeolites, the isomorphic substitution of framework atoms by Ni, and the impregnation of Ni. The obtained catalysts were employed in DRM. Ni-BEA(i), which was synthesized via the single-step interzeolite transformation of Ni-MWW, exhibited high catalytic activity and stability toward DRM owing to the stabilization of the Ni species by the in situ formed silanol defects on the framework. Ni-BEA(ii), which was synthesized via the two-step interzeolite transformation of B-MWW, as well as the isomorphic substitution of B by Ni, also delivered considerable conversions of CH4 and CO2 owing to the stabilization of Ni by the preformed defect sites. However, this stabilization of Ni by the defect site was not observed in Ni-BEA(iii) and Ni-BEA(iv) owing to the relatively intact framework structure and lower conversions of CH4 and CO2 by these catalysts. Compared with the Ni clusters in the intact *BEA structure, the ∼20 kJ mol−1 lower binding energy of the metallic Ni clusters that interacted with a defective structure was calculated via DFT. The overall results of this study demonstrated a close relationship between the activities of Ni-BEA catalysts and the degree of silanol defects in the support.
