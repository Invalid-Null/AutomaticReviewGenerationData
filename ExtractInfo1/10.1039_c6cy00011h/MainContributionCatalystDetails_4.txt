 Based on reviewing the document, I do not believe it is directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) to convert propane to propylene. The document discusses the partial oxidation of propane using CO2 as an oxidant over Ru-doped CeO2 and Ru-doped ZrO2 catalysts. While some propylene formation is mentioned, it does not appear to be the primary focus. The main outcomes seem to be the production of CO and H2 through dry reforming reactions between propane and CO2.
