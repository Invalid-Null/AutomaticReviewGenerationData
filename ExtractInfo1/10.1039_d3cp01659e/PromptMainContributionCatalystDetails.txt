Recent progress in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane over Pt-based catalysts
Light alkenes are the key building blocks in the chemical industry. As a propene on-purpose production technology, propane dehydrogenation has drawn particular attention due to the growing demand for propene and the discovery of large reserves of shale gas. The development of highly active and stable propane dehydrogenation catalysts is significant in the world-wide research field. Supported platinum-based catalysts are widely studied for propane dehydrogenation. This article reviews the developments of platinum-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation, particularly focusing on the influence of the promoter effect and support effect on the structure and catalytic performance and especially on how promoters and supports enable Pt to form highly dispersed and stable active sites. At the end, we propose the prospective research directions of propane dehydrogenation.
Introduction
Propene is the basic raw material for the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and other major commodity chemicals. With the continuous growth of global propene demand, traditional propene production technology, including catalytic cracking and steam cracking, is not able to meet increasing market demand.1,2 Because of the increase in natural gas and shale gas production, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become an important alternative process for the synthesis of propene.3
The PDH reaction is . This reaction is reversible and strongly endothermic. An increased temperature and reduced pressure will shift the reaction equilibrium to the product side, yielding more propene. However, high temperature will also increase undesired side reactions, including cracking, hydrogenolysis, and coke deposition.4 Therefore, a catalyst with high activity and propene selectivity is crucial. Currently, the most common catalysts used for PDH are either Pt-based or Cr-based. Pt is the most used noble metal catalyst in PDH reaction due to its superior activation of C–H bonds and low activity to C–C cleavage.5
It is believed that the dehydrogenation process over a Pt-based catalyst occurs in three steps as shown in Fig. 1.6 During the dehydrogenation process, some side reactions, including cracking, hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation, are inevitable.7 Due to the occurrence of side reactions such as deep dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis and polymerization, multi-polymerized carbon forms on the surface of the catalyst, leading to coke deposition. For Pt-based catalysts, surface coke deposits are one of the primary causes of catalyst deactivation.8,9 Coke deposition on the catalyst surface is generally considered to be a non-permanent deactivation process and can be removed by controlled oxidation regeneration to restore the catalytic activity.10,11 However, multiple cycles of regeneration are likely to cause two main permanent deactivation processes, active metal sintering and structure reconstruction.12 This means that reaction and regeneration conditions can reduce Pt dispersion, resulting in the decrease of the initial activity over multiple regeneration cycles. Moreover, the dehydrogenation of propane over Pt-based catalysts is structurally insensitive, while the side reactions, such as cracking, hydrolysis, isomerization and carbon deposition, are structurally sensitive reactions. The activities of these side reactions are positively correlated with the size of Pt nanoparticles, and large particles of Pt are conducive to the formation of carbon deposition. That is, a catalyst with small Pt particles would reduce the occurrence of side reactions. The smaller particles also expose more active sites, which is beneficial to the PDH reaction. Therefore, the design and preparation of small-particle-size Pt catalysts with high stability are the key to propane dehydrogenation. This review outlines the Pt-based catalysts utilized in the PDH reaction. Previous excellent reviews have broadly elaborated the activation of light alkanes as well as the dehydrogenation or oxidative dehydrogenation reactions of propane to propylene.12–15 In this review, the Pt catalysts mainly reported within the last five years are outlined for PDH reaction. It focuses mainly on the promoter and support effects and how they are important in obtaining highly dispersed and stable Pt catalysts for PDH reaction.
Fig. 1 Schematic diagram of the reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation on Pt-based catalysts.
Promoter effect
As a typical representative of noble metals, Pt is widely used in supported catalysts for PDH. It shows dehydrogenation activity in a metallic state, and a reduction step is required before the reaction. Single-metal Pt catalysts possess high initial activity but can be deactivated rapidly. It has been found that the addition of promoters can adjust the geometric and electronic structures of Pt particles. This in turn can reduce the desorption energy of propene, inhibit deep dehydrogenation, and improve the Pt-based catalyst's stability and selectivity toward propene. Therefore, the selection of appropriate promoters is instrumental in improving the PDH performance of the catalyst.
Sn promoter
Among the Pt-based catalysts, Sn is the most widely studied metal promoter and can be used to modify the active components and supports to improve the catalyst performance.16,17 The explanation of the role of Sn is mainly manifested in two aspects: geometric effects and electronic effects.18 “Geometric effect” means that Sn can divide the Pt present into smaller Pt clusters, increasing the dispersion of Pt species. Motagamwala et al.19 reported Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles with a diameter <2 nanometers obtained by atomic mixing of Pt and Sn precursors on a silica support, which show excellent stability and selectivity to propene (Fig. 2). “Electronic effect” refers to the transfer of electrons from Sn to Pt or the change of Pt electron density. Some researchers believe that SnOx promotes dehydrogenation by acting as an electron donor, transferring electrons to Pt and changing its electronic state.20–22 This in turn is beneficial to propene desorption, thereby increasing the propene selectivity. Xiong et al.23 thought that formation of small PtSn clusters allows the catalyst to achieve high propene selectivity due to the facile desorption of propene.

The strong PtSn interaction can enhance the stability of Pt active sites to resist harsh reaction conditions, which is the key to obtaining durable catalytic performance. Deng et al.24 found that the PtSn interaction can be strengthened through an “oxidation–reduction” method, and this observation may be due to the special geometric arrangements of PtSn alloys. Zhu et al.25 proposed that metallic Pt centers are well dispersed in small raft-like clusters on Mg(Sn)(Al)O and this endows the catalyst with good durability and stability due to the PtSn interactions and SnIV/II confinement. Xu et al.26 also found that the strong interaction between the Pt cluster and Sn-β zeolite leads to the high performance of Pt/Sn-β catalysts for PDH at a high reaction temperature.
The structure, especially the structural evolution during the reaction and regeneration process, of the PtSn site also influences the catalytic performance of PDH. Choi et al.27 found that the reduction temperature induced different structures of Pt and Sn. The Pt particles in the calcined PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts were reduced to Pt3Sn and then to the PtSn alloy with the increase of reduction temperature, which results in the different PDH catalytic performance. Gao et al.28 found that the PtSn alloy structure was formed by the co-impregnation process, while the Sn partially modified Pt was formed by sequential impregnation of Sn first and then Pt. The catalytic performance over PDH reaction revealed that the active site with partial modification of Pt with Sn is 3.7 times more active than the PtSn structure. Wang et al.29 researched the structure evolution of PtSn bimetallic nanoparticles, especially Sn segregation for surface recovery of a PtSn alloy, and found that the recoverable Pt3Sn alloy surface structure contributed to the high efficiency for catalytic dehydrogenation. Moreover, the Sn promoter is favorable for the redispersion of Pt during the catalyst regeneration process. Pham et al.30 reported that added Sn can provide the necessary nucleation sites to redisperse Pt atoms, which increases propene selectivity in Pt/γ-Al2O3. Overall, the chemical state of Sn, the PtSn structure of the catalyst surface, the metal–support interaction, and the structure–activity relationship of PtSn catalysts for PDH are still hotspots of research.
A second promoter of the PtSn system: alkali and alkaline earth metal promoters
Many studies on PtSn catalysts have found that the addition of Sn can improve the stability of Pt-based catalysts to a certain extent, but catalyst deactivation is still inevitable. Therefore, adding a second or even third promoter to the PtSn catalyst has been widely studied. Alkali metals such as Li, Na, and K are commonly used as second promoters. The effects of alkali metals usually involve acid–base interactions and stabilization of Pt atoms. They are usually used to lower the acidity of the support and inhibit the formation of coke during the PDH reaction.31 Shi et al.32 reported that the addition of K neutralizes the acid center in the PtSnK/Al2O3 catalyst, reduces the occurrence of side reactions such as cracking and polymerization, and improves the activity and stability of the catalyst. Moreover, Liu  et al.33,34 found that the introduction of K is favorable for the stability of subnanometric bimetallic PtSn clusters in a KPtSn@MFI catalyst, which shows high catalytic activity in PDH. They found that the addition of K can help to stabilize the Pt atom during the calcination process and suppress the sintering of Pt atoms to Pt nanoparticles (Fig. 3A). The effects of Ca are similar to those observed by K. Rimaz et al.35 studied the promoting effect of Ca on the PDH reaction over the PtGe/Al2O3 catalyst. The addition of Ca decreases the acid centers of Al2O3 and increases the degree of Pt–Ge, which results in the enhanced propene selectivity and catalyst stability. Nakaya et al.36 synthesized the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca and found that Ca acts as an electronic promoter to the single-atom-like Pt site and that a PtGaCaPb/SiO2 catalyst exhibits outstanding catalytic stability in the PDH reaction (Fig. 3B and C).

Based on the above description and discussion, it can be seen that the introduction of alkali and alkaline earth metals, as second promoters, has been widely recognized. Alkali and alkaline earth metal promoters can decrease the acid center of the support, enhance the interaction between Pt and promoters, and thereby improve the activity and stability of Pt-based catalysts. Therefore, alkali metals or alkaline earth metals are usually opted to be added to Pt–Sn catalysts, especially on the zeolite-supported Pt-based catalysts, which have become one of the adjustable factors for improving the catalytic performance.
A second promoter of the PtSn system: rare earth metal promoter
Studies have also explored the use of rare earth metals as a second promoter of the PtSn system. Dong et al.37 found that La is bonded between Pt and Sn atoms in a PtSnLa/Al2O3 catalyst, which can reduce the hydrogen overflow effect of Pt and maintain the oxidation state of Sn. Moreover, Kwon et al.38 found that an appropriate amount of Ce doped on γ-Al2O3 can generate atomically dispersed Ce3+ sites, which results in the strong metal–support interaction (SMSI) to suppress the sintering of Pt0 particles. Ce-modified PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts also show high catalytic performance and enhanced thermal stability.39 The rare earth metal promoter usually acts in the form of an oxidized state because of the low chemical potential of rare-earth metal oxides. However, rare-earth-Pt alloy nanoparticles in mesoporous zeolite were obtained by Ryoo et al.40 They reported that zeolites with surface framework defects enable the formation of Pt and rare-earth alloys by silanol nests, making the rare-earth elements exist in the form of single atomic species with a substantially higher chemical potential. This is beneficial to the PDH reaction (Fig. 3D).
In the above-mentioned strategy, the addition of rare earth metals to modify Pt-based catalysts can change the interaction between the metal and the support. The rare earth metal promoter usually acts in the form of an oxidized state because of the low chemical potential of rare-earth metal oxides. Recently reported rare-earth-platinum alloy catalysts have shown the possible future research directions.
Promoters exist in the form of the Pt–M alloy
Being different from the Sn promoter existing in both the metallic and oxidized states, some promoters, such as Ga, In, Zn, Cu, and Mn, usually form alloys with Pt during the reduction or PDH reaction conditions. The formation of alloys can enhance the geometric dispersion of Pt and modify the electric structure of Pt, which lower the Pt loadings and enhance the PDH performance.
In fact, the supported GaOx catalysts can also catalyze the PDH reaction.41–44 When used as a promoter, Ga usually exists in the form of PtGa alloy to enhance the activity during PDH. Im et al.45 prepared a PtGa/γ-Al2O3 alkane dehydrogenation catalyst with stabilized Pt by combining synergistic physical and chemical stabilization strategies, resulting in exceptionally high activity. Searles et al.46 formed a highly dispersed GaxPt alloyed structure with unprecedented productivity and stability on a silica support. Moreover, the incorporation of Ga in Pt/CeO2–Al2O3 catalysts can modify the Pt nanoparticles by forming the PtGa alloy, and the addition of Ga3+ to a CeO2 lattice helps eliminate coke deposition. Ga as a promoter can increase the activity of PDH over Pt-based catalysts. The stability of PtGa catalysts still needs to be improved. The PtGa nanoparticles can be stabilized by adding a coating of silica47 or alumina48 on the nanoparticle surface (Fig. 4A and B). Additionally, the encapsulated PtGa alloy nanoparticles in MFI zeolite can inhibit sintering and coke deposition for enhanced catalytic stability in PtGa/S-1.49,50

In51–54 and Zn55–59 are other widely used promoters in Pt-based catalysts whose introduction can greatly influence the surface structure, geometric structure, and electronic properties of Pt catalysts, resulting in different catalytic properties of the Pt metal. In as a promoter can interact with Pt to form bimetallic alloys that influence Pt nanoparticles by both geometric and electronic effects. Qian et al.51 prepared carbon nanotube-confined PtIn catalysts by a modified impregnation method. The formation of the PtIn alloy altered the electronic and geometric structures, which enhanced the propene selectivity of the PDH reaction. Tolek et al.52 found that the addition of In can lead to a stronger metal–support interaction and also results in PtIn alloy formation, which can enhance the activity and stability. Cybulskis et al.55 reported that Zn modifies the energy of the Pt 5d electrons in PtZn, which may lead to enhanced product selectivity. Chen et al.57 found Lewis acidic sites and PtZn sites in a 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst work in coordination, which leads to the strong coke resistance and stable state of Pt and Zn. Wang et al.58 reported that well-distributed PtZn nanoclusters inside S-1 zeolites can be synthesized via facile in situ synthesis (Fig. 5A–D). Such an approach can reduce the size of metal species by encapsulating subnanometer and even atomically dispersed PtZn species in the S-1 zeolites. Ingale et al.59 adjusted the interface between Pt and SiO2 by deposition of ZnO layers, which then transform all Pt nanoparticles into PtZn nanoalloy particles during the reducing process and result in exceptional activity and stability in PDH.

Besides Ga, In and Zn, other promoters such as Mn, Fe, and Cu can also form Pt–M alloys to enhance the activity and selectivity of Pt-based catalysts for PDH. Fan et al.60 found that the addition of Mn can form PtMn alloy, which can balance the activity of propane and desorption of propene, and improve the catalytic performance of the Pt/Mn-DMSN catalyst for PDH. Moreover, Rochlitz et al.61 finely constructed PtMn/SiO2via surface organometallic chemistry and a thermolytic molecular precursor (SOMC/TMP) method. The 70% fraction of the total Mn promoter exists in the form of MnII and 30% of the total Mn exists in Mn0 to form Pt2Mn shell nanoparticles on PtMn/SiO2, which shows excellent PDH performance. The surface and subsurface structures of the Pt–M alloy can affect the activity of propane and desorption of propene and result in the improved PDH performance. Cai et al.62 constructed a Pt-skin and Pt-3dTM (3d transition metal) subsurface catalyst. The PtFe@Pt catalyst shows the highest propene selectivity because of the downshifting of the d-band center.
The introduction of M to form Pt–M alloys usually promotes the dispersion of Pt and enhances the activity and selectivity. Nevertheless, the inevitable structure evolution of Pt–M in harsh reaction conditions will also cause the loss of activity.
Promoters exist in the form of intermetallic alloys
Compared to disordered Pt–M alloys, structurally ordered intermetallic alloy (IMA) catalysts show excellent durability. This may be caused by the strengthened interatomic bonding of intermetallic alloys during the disorder-to-order transition process. The atomically ordered arrangement of intermetallic alloy catalysts can produce different average Pt–Pt bond lengths, which would significantly affect the desorption of propene and enhance the PDH performance. Chen et al.63 describe a single-site [PtZn4] catalyst produced by an atomically ordered intermetallic alloy as a selective and stable PDH catalyst. It reveals that the surface [PtZn4] sites serve as the key active site, which is easy to promote the first and second C–H cleavages, and further dehydrogenation of propene is inhibited (Fig. 5E–G). The resulting catalyst shows excellent performance for PDH, with a propane conversion of 45.3% and a propene selectivity of >99%. Li et al.64 reported that Pt3Ti intermetallic nanoparticles can result in higher propene selectivity compared to pure Pt. Although Cr- and V-based catalysts can catalyse propane dehydrogenation, recent studies have shown that they also can act as promoters of Pt-based catalysts. LiBretto et al.65 prepared a bimetallic PtCr nanoparticle catalyst with different structures and morphologies. It was found that a full monolayer coverage of Pt3Cr gives higher olefin selectivity. Moreover, the incorporation of V to a Pt catalyst can lead to the formation of the Pt3V intermetallic compound, which results in high propylene selectivity.66 With the development of characterization techniques, it is possible to study the fine microstructure and the surface and subsurface of intermetallic compounds. Cesar et al.67 reported PtCo intermetallic alloys form two different phases and several morphologies, and all bimetallic PtCo catalysts are significantly more propene-selective than either single metal. This may be due to geometric effects associated with smaller Pt–Pt ensembles as well as a decrease in the energy of the Pt 5d orbitals compared to those of monometallic Pt. Wu et al.68 found that with the same ordered nanoparticle surface, a Pt3Mn intermetallic subsurface can replace monometallic Pt, significantly improving the C–H activation selectivity by lowering the heats of hydrocarbon and hydrogen adsorption on the surface sites.
Promoters assisting single-atom Pt
When the dispersion of Pt achieves 100%, that is, all the Pt exists in the form of atomically isolated active sites, a single-atom catalyst is obtained. Nakaya et al.69 designed the PtGe-type high-entropy intermetallics (HEIs) to construct thermally stable single-atom Pt sites for PDH. The Pt and Ge sites of intermetallic PtGe were substituted with Co/Cu and Ga/Sn, respectively, which formed the nanoparticulate (PtCoCu)(GeGaSn) HEI on the Ca–SiO2 support. The single-atom-like Pt sites in HEI (0.25) effectively promote the desorption of propylene to inhibit undesired side reactions, with almost no deactivation observed for 2 months for the first time. Nakaya et al.70 reported PtGaPb/SiO2 catalysts with single Pt sites that showed high selectivity for propene production and outstanding stability for long-term operation at high temperature. DFT calculations on the different models of the PtGa system indicate that the addition of Ga can increase the metal–support interaction to reduce sintering, isolate the Pt site and enhance the activity and selectivity by the moving of surface atoms.71 Sun et al.72 synthesized γ-alumina-supported Pt/Cu single-atom alloy catalysts and found that single Pt atoms dispersed on Cu nanoparticles dramatically enhanced the desorption of surface-bounded propene and prohibited its further dehydrogenation.
Promoters exist in the form of non-alloys
It has been shown how the introduction of promoters can significantly affect the size and surface structure of the Pt catalyst to enhance the PDH performance by forming alloys or intermetallic compounds. In contrast, some promoters, including alkali, alkaline earth and rare earth metal promoters discussed above, are not usually alloyed with Pt. They can also regulate the electronic and geometric structures of Pt to affect the PDH performance. In addition to these, some promoters are also effective in improving catalytic performance by acting in the form of an oxidized state. Fan et al.73 reported that Fe-DMSN supports with Fe existing in the oxidation state are favorable for the dispersion of Pt by the redispersion process during the reduction because of the strong metal–support interaction. Other studies established that Zn species can be stabilized by the silanols from zeolite framework dealumination and then act as the anchoring sites for Pt.56 The isolated Pt atoms were stabilized in the SiOZn–OH nests with the Pt of a nearly zerovalent state and Zn in an average oxidation state close to +1. The (Si–O–Zn)4–6Pt complex exhibits a PDH activity higher than that of the PtZn alloy or cluster catalyst, with nearly 100% propene selectivity and high stability.74 Shen et al.53 prepared a PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst and found that the enhanced interaction between In and the support is conducive to the reduction of Pt. Chen et al.54 found that in PtIn/LaAlO3/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, PtIn bimetal active sites can be confined to the interstitial positions of the perovskite lattice, and the appropriate In3+/In0 ratio can stabilize the chemical states of Pt and In, inhibiting coking.
Many kinds of metals can be used as promoters to modify the Pt-based catalysts prepared by different synthetic routes. It is difficult to compare the advantages and disadvantages of various promoters through these differences. In general, the addition of appropriate promoters can disperse Pt sites by enhancing the interaction between the metal and support, forming the anchor sites to Pt and/or forming alloy compounds. It can affect the Pt on both the electronic and geometric structures and result in the enhanced catalytic activity and stability of the catalyst for PDH. How to choose the appropriate type of promoters is the most important factor to form the Pt-based catalysts with high activity and stability.
Support effect
A high temperature and low pressure are required to obtain a high propene yield in the PDH reaction. However, severe reaction conditions also increase the rate of side reactions, such as cracking, and can cause serious coke deposition on the catalyst. Different supports have a significant influence on the catalytic activity of Pt-based PDH catalysts, depending on the nature of the support and its interaction with Pt.
Alumina support
Alumina is the most commonly used support for PDH due to its high surface area, thermal stability and mechanical strength.75–78 The surface area, acid–base properties, and coordination structure of Al2O3 have been demonstrated to have a significant influence on the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts. Accordingly, adjusting the morphology and surface properties of Al2O3 can have an important effect on the resulting Pt-based catalysts. Gong et al.77 found that the activation of propane in PtSn/Al2O3-mel is enhanced by the electron-deficient properties of Pt and the enhanced interaction of Pt and Sn, and mass transfer was facilitated by the unique morphology and surface properties of the starfruit-like Al2O3 structure. Wang et al.79 found that the ratio of urea and Al(NO3)3·9H2O influences the morphological structure of Al2O3 and the interaction between the supported metal and the Al2O3 support, which can ensure excellent PDH performance.
The interaction between Pt and the support has an important influence on the catalytic stability. It was found that unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ centers present on the (100) facets of the γ-Al2O3 surface can anchor Pt. Shi et al.80 synthesized Al2O3 nanosheets with a large percentage of pentacoordinate Al3+ sites. The unique nanosheet structure could account for the formation of highly dispersed and stabilized PtSn clusters on its surface. Zhu et al.81 also found that the pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can anchor the PtSn clusters and enhance the resistant ability of sinter for PDH (Fig. 6A and B). Moreover, the availability of unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ can promote the uniform dispersion of Pt and Ga and the effective hydrogen overflow between Pt and Ga. By encouraging hydrogen desorption from Ga2O3 active centers, it enhances the synergy between Pt and Ga2O3 in PDH.82 Wang et al.78 described a specific effect of Alpenta3+ sites on the structure and the catalytic performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. The content of Alpenta3+ sites on Al2O3 shows a volcano-type profile as a function of calcination temperature. The structural rearrangement of Alpenta3+ sites made Pt partially buried in Al2O3 with a higher calcination temperature of impregnated Al2O3 than Al2O3 precursor (Fig. 6C), which results in a relatively low propane conversion but high stability.

Compared with alumina, the addition of Mg in Mg(Al)O neutralized the acid center of Al2O3, which was beneficial to reduce the side reactions such as cracking and carbon deposition. Some researchers have studied the preparation conditions of magnesium aluminum oxide support, such as Mg/Al molar ratio, pH value, and calcination temperature of the precursor.83,84 Zhang et al.85 found that the formation of highly crystalline meixnerite can redisperse the metal active sites and adjust the acid–base properties of the catalyst, improving stability and coke resistance.
Silica support
Compared with Al2O3, SiO2 has the characteristics of easy morphology control, easy surface functionalization, and low surface acidity, which can effectively prevent the deactivation of the catalyst due to coke deposition. It is widely used as a support in PDH reactions for these reasons. Deng et al.86 found that the electronic and geometric properties of Pt atoms in the Pt/SiO2 system are modified by strong metal–support interactions, which are formed at high reduction temperature. Furthermore, the high catalytic activity of Pt/SiO2 for PDH may be due to the presence of more electron-rich Pt and the greater number of Pt atoms on the exposed surface. Copéret et al.87 prepared GaPt/SiO2 by the SOMC method and found small GaxPt alloy nanoparticles and some Ga single centers. Because SOMC can bind a large number of active metals on the surface, it helps maintain small particle sizes and separate Pt sites, resulting in increased catalyst activity and selectivity. A PtZn/SiO288 catalyst was also prepared by SOMC/TMP, with small alloyed nanoparticles distributed narrowly and homogeneously. Ye et al.89 synthesized a series of SiO2@Pt1Sn1 nanoparticles, with a highly ordered PtSn intermetallic shell formed on the Pt nanoparticles (Fig. 7a). It was found that the high propene selectivity of these nanoparticles is due to the geometric effect of Sn on Pt clusters, and the high turnover rate is because of the electronic effect weakening the Pt–hydrocarbon chemisorption energy.

SBA-15 has a unidirectional and hexagonal ordered pore structure suitable for catalyst support.90 Unfortunately, the Pt nanoparticles tended to aggregate at high temperature or leach into the liquid phase due to the relative inertness of the SBA-15 surface. Fan et al.91 prepared Al-modified SBA-15 and found that the addition of Al can enhance the interaction between SBA-15 and Sn, inhibiting the formation of Sn0. Compared with SBA-15, dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (DMSN) are an attractive material as a support due to their unique feature. They show a high surface area, which mainly originates from their dendrimer-like morphology not from their mesoporous channels like in SBA-15. Moreover, the monodispersed nanoparticles with a short diffusion length as the support might promote the diffusion of the reactant molecules and product molecules and influence the catalytic behavior. Liu et al. constructed a series of transition-metal Mn and Fe-doped DMSN as the support of Pt-based catalysts for PDH60,73 and found that the modification of DMSN can increase the interaction between Pt and Mn-DMSN (Fig. 7b)60 or Fe-DMSN supports, which results in the enhanced catalytic performance of PDH.
Zeolite support
Zeolites are considered to be ideal supports for the preparation of ultra-small metal clusters and even single-atom clusters due to their regular microporous pore structure confining the growth of metal clusters. The ZSM-5 zeolite has a clear 10-membered ring channel system, which can prevent the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules and thereby improve catalyst stability by preventing coke deposition. It is especially effective in improving Pt dispersion with the incorporation of metals. Zhou et al.92 found that compared with PtSnNa/ZSM-5, PtSnNa/SUZ-4 has higher activity and higher stability for PDH. This may be because of a large amount of Pt on the outer surface of the PtSnNa/SUZ-4 catalyst, while Pt deactivation is minimized by blocking of zeolite pores to coke deposits. Wang et al.93 found that the strong PtSn interactions and the confinement effect of Sn in the Si-β framework inhibit the coke deposition and sintering of Pt clusters, achieving good stability of the Pt/Sn-Si-β catalyst during PDH. Ponomaryov et al.94 reported a simple method to enhance Pt dispersion of the Pt/MFI catalyst by introducing NaCl during the impregnation process. The enhanced activity and stability of the catalyst for PDH were obtained on the NaCl-promoted Pt/MFI catalyst.
Substantial work has been done in efforts to improve the diffusion performance of molecular sieves, including reducing the sieve's particle size, changing its morphology, and introducing mesopores into the molecular sieve, among other potential alterations. Li et al.95 synthesized a series of PtSn/TS-1 catalysts with varied zeolite sizes and found that the generation of a hierarchical structure in small-size samples can enhance the mass transportation and accessibility of active components. Li et al.96 prepared a series of PtSnOx/TS-1@SBA-16 catalysts in an effort to introduce more mesopores. These are beneficial to the mass transfer of reactant and product molecules, increase the specific surface area, and accelerate mass transfer during the reaction of propane to propene. Wang et al.97 synthesized hierarchical ZSM-5-confined PtSn catalysts and found that their PDH catalytic performance is greatly affected by the desilication process of ZSM-5 and Sn/Pt ratios in PtSn bimetallic particles. Zhang et al.98 synthesized epitaxial high-crystallized MFI zeolites, in which PtZn clusters were encapsulated. The highly crystallized zeolite with a short diffusion length and a high surface permeability results in a high specific activity of 1.7 times that of PtZn confined in a nanosized zeolite.
However, the existence of strong acidic sites in zeolites can induce undesired side reactions. Thus, the purely siliceous zeolite with low acidity was used in PDH.74,99–102 Liu et al.17 found that purely siliceous MFI zeolite-confined bimetallic PtSn clusters showed excellent catalytic activity and stability. Sun et al.103 reported a catalyst reduction method in which sub-nanoscale bimetallic PtZn clusters were wrapped in silicalite-1 (Fig. 8). The PtZn4@S-1-H catalyst exhibits an ultrahigh propene selectivity of 99.3% and a very high specific activity for propene formation. It may be that the synergistic effect of metal species with the exposed active sites in small clusters could enhance the charge transfer between the metal species, supports, and other metals. Zhou et al.99 modified the silicalite-1 by introducing different metals with Mg, Al, Fe and In, which can have a profound impact for the pore structure, reducibility, acidity, and surface content of Pt. Compared with conventional silicalite-1, graded silicalite-1 can improve the metal–support interaction and is therefore expected to improve the catalytic activity and selectivity for PDH. Wannapakdee et al.100 prepared a catalyst with Pt supported on MFI, a weakly acidic siliceous zeolite with a hierarchical nanosheet structure. They found that the strong interaction between Pt and silicalite-1 nanosheets can enrich the electron density of Pt. Liu et al.33 found that zeolites can serve as an ideal support to stabilize subnanometric metals. Highly stable subnanometric Pt and PtSn clusters exhibited a strong preference for localization of the sinusoidal channels of MFI, which can improve stability, selectivity, and activity for the PDH reaction. Zhang et al.101 found that the single-site Zn in the framework of silicalite-1 can stabilize the PtZn intermetallic alloys, which shows high stability for PDH reaction.

Other supports
Presently, boron nitride materials and nanocarbon materials such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, and nanofibers have attracted extensive interest as potential catalyst supports. Since defects can anchor Pt atoms, Liu et al.104 used defect-rich and defect-poor carbon nanotubes as supports and exploited the effects of carbon nanotube support defects on the stability of Pt nanoparticles during high-temperature PDH. A strong metal–support interaction between defect-rich carbon nanotubes and Pt nanoparticles was observed. Because heteroatom-modified carbon nanoparticles can effectively stabilize and disperse metal nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes containing N−, B−, and P− defects can be used to disperse Pt nanoparticles and improve their catalytic performance. Therefore, Liu et al.105 prepared Pt/P-CNTs and found that P-modified carbon nanotubes can improve the electron transfer or hybridization between Pt and P. P also can block the combustion sites in nanocarbon by inhibiting the formation of electrophilic oxygen species. Moreover, Wang et al.106 found that h-BN is a promising support of Pt-based catalysts for PDH. The strong metal–support interaction is formed by the calcination and reduction process, which results in high stability. Chen et al.107 found that a strong metal–support interaction between CeO2 and the small number of exposed Pt sites can suppress hydrogenolysis reactions, leading to high selectivity for PDH. Yin et al.108 found that the improved interaction between metal nanoclusters and the sulfur-doped carbon support greatly retards the diffusion of metal atoms and the migration of nanoclusters, resulting in higher selectivity and more stability than sulfur-free carbon-supported catalysts (Fig. 9A). They also employed carbon-black-supported Pt, changing the Pt loading and carbon black surface areas to control the particle distance, and found that enlarging the particle distance beyond a critical distance suppressed the particle coalescence109 (Fig. 9B).

In general, the support can stabilize Pt sites by spatially confining, forming the anchor sites to Pt, and forming strong metal–support interaction. It affects the Pt on both the electronic and geometric structures, which are beneficial for the activity and stability of the catalyst for PDH.
Conclusions and perspectives
As the demand for propene continues to increase, the process of propane dehydrogenation to propene accounts for an increasing proportion, and Pt-based catalysts are the main catalysts used in PDH reactions. Although Pt-based catalysts exhibit high dehydrogenation activity, Pt particles are easy to sinter and deactivate at high temperatures. For this reason, it is a problem for scholars to study and solve in depth to reduce costs, reduce environmental pollution, inhibit coking reactions, and improve catalyst stability and selectivity. In this review, we have summarized the effect of promoters and supports on the PDH performance over Pt-based catalysts. On one hand, promoters, such as alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, rare earth metals and transition metals, can modify the surface properties of the PtM sites and/or supports and adjust the interaction between the metal and support, which can prevent the aggregation of Pt particles during the recycling process, thereby improving the dispersibility and high temperature stability of Pt. On the other hand, the support is an important component for Pt-based catalysts, which can form the metal–support interaction and disperse or confine the Pt sites. Although much progress has been made, many challenges remain:
(1) For noble metal catalysts, it is urgently required to decrease the loading amount and maintain the high activity. Therefore, although there are many preparation methods, including SOMC, the defect anchoring strategy and the zeolite spatially confining strategy, the new and facile synthetic strategy of highly dispersed and stable Pt clusters or single sites should be developed to achieve high PDH performance over Pt-based catalysts with low Pt loadings.
(2) The exploration of in situ or operando characterization combination with theoretical calculations should be performed to understand the reaction mechanism and Pt site evolution process. On this basis, the structure–property relationship can be established so as to provide guidance for the construction of high-efficiency catalysts.
(3) Cheap and nontoxic metal oxide catalysts should be developed to replace Pt-based catalysts. Although there are many metal oxide catalysts, such as Zn, Co, Fe, Sn and Ga studied in PDH reactions, the deactivation of these catalysts is usually fast. Therefore, the development and large-scale preparation of cheap and nontoxic metal oxide catalysts is still challenging.
(4) Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with O2 or CO2 is an alternative propylene production technology, which can overcome the equilibrium limitations of PDH. Compared with PDH reactions, the operation temperature of oxidative dehydrogenation can be much lower. There is almost no coke deposition on the catalysts during the oxidative condition, which indicates the lower deactivation. However, it is favorable to form deep oxidation products, that is, CO and CO2, thermodynamically under the condition of an oxidizing agent (for example, O2). The relatively low selectivity of the propene makes the large-scale industrial applications limited. Therefore, the design of catalysts with both high propane conversion and high propene selectivity is crucial.

    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
