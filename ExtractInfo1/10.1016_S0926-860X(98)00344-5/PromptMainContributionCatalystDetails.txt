Supported chromium oxide catalysts using metal carboxylate complexes: dehydrogenation of propane
Abstract
The present paper constitutes the first stage of a systematic study of the influence of precursor nature and structure on the catalyst behavior in dehydrogenation of propane, by varying the nature of the ligands and the nuclearity of the starting compounds at fixed net surface potentials. We show results obtained by the use of different Cr carboxylates to design the Cr2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst at low loadings and these results are compared with those obtained for chromic acid. The following short chain chromium compounds were selected as precursors: citrate (Cr(III)), dimer monohydrate acetate (Cr(II)), acetyl acetonate (Cr(III)) and hydroxyacetate (Cr(III)). An exhaustive characterization by means of BET surface, XPS, XRD, X-ray fluorescence, laser Raman spectroscopy, EPR and catalytic test in propane dehydrogenation enabled us to draw relevant conclusions. Low metal–support interaction might be the major cause of polymerization in Carbox. The interaction between the chromia phase and the support surface, which stabilizes different oxidation stages and coordinations of the chromia species, defines the surface architecture. Part of the Cr3+ is incorporated in the vacant octahedral sites of the spinel surface. The larger extension of this phenomenon in Cral might be responsible for surface inactive species that could cause a loss of catalytic activity. Deactivation between cycles might depend on the catalyst stabilization by the incorporation of Cr3+ into the support structure. The surface array of monomer species in a polymer species environment stabilizes the catalyst architecture and confers characteristics of high stability between cycles. The above considerations permit to infer that chromium carboxylates are interesting precursors for the control of surface species in chromia/Al2O3 catalysts.
1. Introduction
Both supported chromium and α-Cr2O3 are known to be active catalysts in the dehydrogenation of alkanes. Numerous attempts have been made to identify the catalyst active sites. These studies have shown that several oxidation states of chromium can simultaneously be present in the supported chromium oxide phase as a function of chromium loading and calcination temperature. In fact, Rahman et al. [1]reported that fresh catalyst Cr/Al2O3 presents Cr in two oxidation states, Cr6+ and Cr3+ after calcination at temperatures of 500°C or higher. The appearance of Cr3+ is accompanied by a decrease of Cr6+, which might suggest that Cr3+ is formed from Cr6+. Besides, Cr6+ is relatively easy to reduce in a bulk catalyst than in a supported one. According to Vuurman et al. [2], the molecular structure of the surface species of oxide and chromium(VI) are functions of surface coverage and calcination temperature, since under ambient conditions the surface structure depends on the point of zero charge of the hydrated oxide. Increasing surface coverage causes a decrease of the net surface pH and formation of more polymerized chromium oxide species.
Chromium in the +6 oxidation state affects both catalytic activity and coke formation in the initial stages of a reaction, when the catalyst is being reduced. The activity and stability of the catalyst system studied here were determined by Cr dispersion and by the effect of the chromia content on the porous structure of the catalyst, respectively [3]. The catalytic stability of catalysts with high chromia content was lower because the chromia content affected the surface texture. When chromium nitrate was used as a precursor up to a surface coverage of 9% CrO3/Al2O3, the chromium oxide was stabilized by the alumina support in the +6 oxidation state after calcination [2].
It can be expected that when the metal oxide forms a monolayer on the support surface, not only can it be more efficiently used, but it will also be able to further interact with the support. Such influence can either hinder or enhance the formation of new surface species. Such changes can considerably influence the catalyst activity and selectivity. The catalysts so far studied have been obtained by impregnation of predominantly γ-Al2O3 with chromic acid, which sets a net surface pH. It is known that there are different oxo species in Cr2O3 aqueous solution, depending on their concentration and therefore on their pH [4].
Numerous papers have been published regarding the characterization of chromium oxide on different supports. Many studies have dealt with the use of a specific technique. The effects of the type of support and of some preparation parameters (calcination temperature, chromium oxide loading) on the nature of the chromium species have been the object of most of these investigations. However, no studies have been carried out to study the effect of the precursor characteristics and the medium in which they are dissolved.
The following chromium compounds were selected as precursors for the present investigation: Citrate (Cr(III)): Carbox4, dimer monohydrate acetate (Cr(II)): Carbox3, acetyl acetonate (Cr(III)): Carbox2, and hydroxyacetate (Cr(III)): Carbox1. Due to their tendency to generate bridge structures, ligands of the carboxylate type are likely to favor the interactions between the metal atoms by the formation of polymers. Therefore, these ligands are of interest for the preparation of multinuclear species. Carboxylates decompose to metallic oxide at moderate temperatures in air.
The present paper constitutes the first stage of a systematic study on the influence of the nature and structure of precursor on the catalytic behavior in the dehydrogenation of propane, by using precursor compounds of different ligands and nuclearity, deposited on the support, at fixed net surface potentials. Results obtained for Cr2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalysts prepared at low Cr loadings with Cr carboxylates are compared with those obtained for catalysts prepared from chromic acid.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared from ALCOA F110 high purity γ-Al2O3, having a surface area of approximately 180 m2/g. Chromium(III) acetate hydroxide (Aldrich), chromium(III) acetylacetonate (Aldrich), dimer monohydrate acetate(II) (Aldrich) and chromium citrate synthesized by us were used as preparation reagents. Two types of catalysts are distinguished according to the impregnation method used.
Type I: The first method consisted of slowly passing an aqueous stream of chromic acid (2 M) over alumina. This is called the continuous adsorption method. The process of adsorption was checked by determining the metal content in the effluent.
Type II: The alumina was impregnated by the incipient wetness method with an amount of solution equal to the pore volume. For this type of catalyst, different solutions of carboxylates in toluene or water were added to an amount of support particles.
Both types of catalyst were dried for 10 h at 253 K. Afterwards, the catalyst was calcined in air at 873 K for 5 h.
2.1.1. Surface area
The surface areas (SSA, m2/g) of all samples were measured by N2 adsorption at 77 K (BET method). A Micromeritics Accusorb 2100 E was used.
2.1.2. X-ray fluorescence
The metal contents of the catalysts were determined with a Philips PW1400 X-ray spectrometer [5].
2.1.3. X-ray diffraction
XRD patterns were obtained with a Rigaku diffractometer operated at 35 kV and 30 mA, employing Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.15418 nm).
2.2. Spectroscopic measurements
2.2.1. Laser Raman spectroscopy
Raman spectra were recorded from powdered samples, with a JASCO TRS600SZP multichannel monochromatic spectrometer. The samples were pressed into self-supporting wafers. The Raman spectra were recorded at room temperature and using the 514.5 nm line of argon ion laser as the excitation source. The laser power at the catalyst wafers was 200 mW, unless stated otherwise. The samples were placed under a microscope in such a way that it was possible to point the laser beam to any desired particle.
2.2.2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
XPS spectra were obtained with a Shimadzu spectrometer employing a Mg Kα X-ray excitation source (hν=1253.6 eV). The sample, as fine powder, was pressed into a wafer. The reported binding energies have been referenced to C1s as 284.6 eV. Referencing was performed both before and after a complete set of spectra had been obtained. The spectra were analyzed in the sequence Cr2p, C1s, O1s, Al2p, C1s to minimize the time of exposure to X-ray for the first recording of Cr2p region (about 6 min). Ratios of atomic concentration in the outer layers of the samples were expressed as the corresponding XPS area ratios by using the effective ionization cross-section of ejected electrons tabulated by Scofield and the formulas given by Seah and Dench [6]. The deconvolution of Cr2p spectra was accomplished with a standard peak synthesis program, in which spectra are synthesized from arbitrary Gaussian singlet lines. Constraints providing physical consistency are introduced by the user. In particular, this applies to line widths and intensity ratios of doublets and of lines with adjacent satellites. The Cr2p1/2/Cr2p3/2 intensity ratio was kept in the limits of 0.40±0.03 for Cr(VI) and 0.55±0.03 for all other chromium species [7]. The satellite structure of Cr(III) lies between the Cr2p1/2 and the Cr2p3/2, showing a peak shifted to 4.1±0.1 eV from the main one and an intensity ratio of 0.32±0.03 for all the spectra.
2.2.3. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)
EPR measurements were made at room temperature on a Bruker spectrometer operated at X-band frequencies. A Klystron frequency of 9.7 GHz and 100 kHz magnetic field modulation were used. The spectrometer was equipped with an on-line computer for data processing.
2.3. Catalytic test
The activity was measured in a flow apparatus at atmospheric pressure. The partial pressure of propane was 0.2. The equipment has previously been described in detail [8]. The catalyst (usually 1.0 g) in the form of pellets (usually 0.5–0.85 mm particle diameter) was placed on a fritted disk sealed inside a steel reactor. The gas flow rate was 24 ml/min. The reaction temperature was 873 K. The height of the catalyst bed was 5–10 mm. The reactor temperature was controlled within ±1 K by a commercial device. Isothermal conditions were approached by feeding the reactant diluted in an inert gas. The analysis of reactants and products was carried out with a gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard GC 5780) with an activated alumina packed column and employing nitrogen as the carrier gas. A flame ionization detector (FID) was used. The regeneration procedure was carried out with air feeding at 723 K for 90 min. The system allowed the separation of hydrogen, methane, ethane, propane and propene, which were eluded in this order. The areas of the gas chromatography peaks were evaluated by an integrator (Hewlett-Packard, Model 3390A).
3. Results
3.1. X-ray fluorescence
The chromium content analyses for the studied catalysts are presented in Table 1. A chromium concentration of approximately 6%, expressed as chromium oxide, was found for all the samples.

3.2. Specific surface area, BET
The specific surface areas, Table 1, were approximately the same for all the impregnated catalysts independent of the precursor. In all cases, the surface area decreased by 20% with respect to that of the support (178–140 m2/g). From these results, it can be inferred that chromium oxide does not cause plugging of the alumina pores. Rather, the alumina is apparently sintered due to the fact that it was used with no previous thermal treatment. In fact, the specific surface area of the support without Cr drops from 178 to 145 m2/g after being calcined under the same conditions as the catalysts.
3.3. X-ray diffraction
For all the samples, the X-ray diffractograms exhibited the patterns assigned to γ-Al2O3 and α-Al2O3 corundum, which are those corresponding to the support.
Different crystalline phases were detected and their intensities depended on the precursor. Patterns corresponding to Cr2O3 crystallites were not observed for any of the samples. The crystalline phase corresponding to Cr3O8 was detected in all the Carbox but not in Cral. The intensity of its main peak follows the order: Carbox1≫Carbox4>Carbox3≅Carbox2. The patterns corresponding to CrO3 were also detected. The intensity order was Cral>Carbox2≫Carbox3>Carbox4≅Carbox1.
3.4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS
Surface atomic ratios (Table 1) between Cr2p and Al2p were calculated according to Scofield's factors. These ratios can be compared directly since the specific surfaces areas of the different catalysts were similar. From this table, it can be observed that the results obtained before and after the catalytic test showed differences that can be considered significant. In no case the formation of a Cr monolayer in the support surface was reached. A slight increase of the Cr2p/Al2p ratio was observed in the Cral catalyst while in Carbox1, Carbox3 and Carbox4, a decrease of the Cr/Al ratio was observed. Only Carbox2 showed a slight increase in the surface atomic ratio.
Table 2 presents the binding energy values (BE) of the peaks observed for Cr2p3/2 and the energy differences ΔEs,o due to the spin–orbit interaction associated with the Cr2p level. The binding energy values of Cr2p3/2 peaks were obtained by applying a fitting program.

Carbox1 577.5 579.9 1.1 9.7
Carbox2 578.0 580.4 0.7 9.3
Carbox3 577.8 580.2 1.0 9.5

Cral 577.4 579.9 0.4 9.0
The binding energies for Cr3+ differ between catalysts, showing values ranging from 577.4 to 578.0 eV. These BE values for Cr3+ are higher than those normally assigned to Cr3+ species.
The Cr3+/Cr6+ surface distribution is different for each catalyst. Assuming the same relative sensitivity values for Cr3+ and Cr6+, the Cr3+/Cr6+ relative intensity reported in Table 2 represents the quantitative values of the superficial concentrations. It can be expected that due to low chromium loading of the catalysts, these values are very different from and higher than those of the bulk [9]. Grünert et al. [7]have reported that even in the case of a catalyst reduced for a long time, Cr3+ and Cr0 signals were detected, while those corresponding to Cr5+ and Cr2+ were not.
The Cr3+/Cr6+ ratios were different for different carboxylate catalysts though they were always close to the mean value (0.9). However, it is notable that the highest value was observed in the catalyst with the highest ΔEs,o. The value obtained for Carbox2 was similar to that reported by Kytokivi et al. [10]for the same precursor.
The ΔEs,o values of the Cr2p peaks of carboxylates associated to Cr3+ were between 9.5 and 9.7 eV. For the Cral catalyst, the value observed for ΔEs,o (Cr3+) was much lower (9.0 eV). The increase of the surface Cr/Al ratio for the Cral catalyst presented in Table 1 might support the hypothesis of a dispersion increase of chromia phase over the alumina. The Carbox2 sample also had a low but higher Cr3+/Cr6+ ratio of 9.3, and a smaller increase in the Cr/Al ratio after reaction. All the other Carbox catalysts had higher Cr3+/Cr6+ ratios and a decrease in Cr/Al ratios. This might indicate that the interaction between Cr and the support for the carboxylate based catalysts is weaker than that of the Cral catalyst.
3.5. Laser Raman spectroscopy
All the samples showed interference by fluorescence, probably due to hydrocarbide impurities.
Fig. 1 shows the Raman spectra of the four carboxylate-based catalysts in the region 1264–514 cm−1. The Carbox1–4 samples showed intense Raman bands at 855, 965, and 1000 cm−1. Low intensity bands at 600 and 875 cm−1 were also observed for Carbox1 and 3, and with a markedly lower intensity for Carbox4. The bands observed at ∼1000 and ∼600 cm−1 were assigned to νs (CrO) and νs (Cr–O–Cr) of polymeric surface species on Al2O3, in agreement with the results obtained by Kim and Wach [11]for 1% Cr on Al2O3. The band at ∼875 cm−1 was assigned to νs (O–Cr–O) of monomeric species. The Raman band corresponding to the CrO asymmetric stretching mode was not observable, since its intensity was much weaker compared to the symmetric stretching mode. Bands at 965 and 855 cm−1 were assigned to tri- or tetrameric species. It is important to note that the 765 cm−1 band corresponding to νas (Cr–O–Cr) was not observed. The Carbox3 sample showed an additional band at 550 cm−1. This band was assigned to metal–oxygen vibration of distorted octahedrally coordinated chromium atoms in crystalline Cr2O3 by Vuurman et al. [2].

Fig. 2 shows the Raman spectrum of the catalyst synthesized by impregnation with chromic acid. The Cr/Al2O3 sample showed an intense band at ∼855 cm−1 and those at 875 and 965 cm−1 were poorly resolved. The band at ∼875 cm−1 can be assigned to the symmetrical stretching of tetrahedral chromium oxide species. This band would correspond to a hydrated species of the type CrO2−4, this is to say, a monomer. This catalyst did not present bands at ∼600 and 1000 cm−1. The presence of surface tri- or tetramers could not be separately identified due to difficulties for detecting their characteristic frequencies. However, according to the results reported by Vuurman et al. [4]for tri- or tetramer structures, the prevalence of one of them might be detected by the presence of one or two Cr″O2 groups, respectively, and by the fact that both exhibit two Cr′O3 groups. Therefore, the ratio between the Cr′O3 (904 cm−1) and Cr″O2 (962 cm−1) bands would decrease with higher amounts of Cr″O2 groups. However, these bands were not resolved in our spectra.

3.6. Electron paramagnetic resonance
The most salient characteristics of the spectra obtained were a wide symmetric band situated at about 3500 G corresponding to highly interacted Cr3+, called beta-phase (in small aggregates characterized by a variable band width in the 750–1100 range); a derivative signal close to 1500 G assigned to Cr3+ with low electronic interaction and known as delta phase; and a sharp additional signal of resonance corresponding to Cr5+ and termed gamma phase, also located in the central portion of the spectrum. In most of the fresh catalysts, the gamma phase Cr5+ signal was composed of two resonance signals of weak resolution, which are here denoted as γ1 and γ2, and which are characterized by g1=1.967, ΔHpp=56–60 G and g2=1.983, ΔHpp=20 G, respectively. In the used catalysts, this signal practically disappeared, while in the regenerated catalysts, a single Cr5+ signal corresponding to gamma phase 1 was observed, which was highly symmetric with the same g value and characteristic width (ΔHpp=60) in all the cases.
The EPR spectra of regenerated catalysts showed the same signals as those in the fresh and used catalysts. The apparent changes shown were due to changes in the microwave frequency. Regenerated catalysts were analyzed using a frequency of ν=9.843 GHz, while 9.773 GHz was used for fresh and used catalysts.
In all the cases, the signal intensities of the spectra presented here were corrected for sample mass, chromium content, equipment gain and attenuation. The g values mentioned are approximate, though they matched well with the published data for these catalytic systems.
Fig. 3Fig. 4Fig. 5 show EPR spectra of Carbox1, Carbox2, Carbox3, Carbox4 and Cral samples in fresh, used and regenerated state, respectively. The amplitude of the signals corresponding to the beta, delta and gamma phases are summarized in Table 3 so that the changes produced in each of these phases when the catalysts were subjected to catalytic test and regeneration treatments can be clearly seen.

The Cr3+ contents in the beta phase in fresh catalysts were considerably lower than those of used and regenerated catalysts. The beta phase signal increased by 45% for Carbox1 and Cral, 63% for Carbox3 and Carbox4, and 74% for Carbox2 after use. These changes were indicative of a high Cr6+ content in the fresh catalysts, which was reduced to Cr3+ during the reaction.
The Cr3+ intensities in the beta phase in regenerated catalyst were similar to those of the used catalysts. In most cases, they recovered the Cr5+ gamma phase 1 signal from the fresh catalysts.
In all the cases, the amplitudes of the signals in regenerated catalysts were higher than those of the fresh catalysts. The increase was 27% for Carbox1, Carbox4 and Cral, and 39% and 60% for Carbox2 and Carbox3, respectively.
The delta phase Cr3+ also exhibited important changes, particularly for Carbox2, Carbox4 and Cral, which showed an increase of this signal of approximately 50% between fresh and regenerated and/or used catalysts. The increase was 30% and 25% for Carbox1 and Carbox2, respectively.
3.7. Catalytic activity
Table 4 shows the results of the catalytic tests in the propane to propylene dehydrogenation reaction. Propane conversions and propylene selectivities are presented for two different times on stream (initial and after 80 min). Similarly, data are presented for the fresh (first run, labeled f) catalyst and the regenerated (second run, labeled r) catalyst.
1.
Carbox1: No significant changes were observed between first and second run. After 80 min reaction time, the activity of FC dropped to 28%, while that of UC only decreased to 32%. The UC was much more stable than the FC. No changes were detected for propylene selectivity.
2.
Carbox2: Practically, no changes in the initial activity were observed after regeneration. After 80 min, the FC activity fell to 26%, while the UC reached 31%.
3.
Carbox3: The initial activities of FC and UC were markedly different. However, the FC suffered a loss of activity after 80 min decreasing to 32%, while the UC stayed at 40%.
4.
Carbox4: The initial activity of the FC was 37%, while that of the UC was 31%. After 80 min, both activities were lower and in the order of 32% and 26%, respectively.
5.
Cral: After 80 min, the FC showed 47% conversion, which greatly differed from that of the UC (27%). This catalyst exhibited a marked difference between FC and UC.

4. Discussion
4.1. The nature of chromium species
The chromium loadings in all the catalysts, measured by X-ray fluorescence, were similar and could even be considered equivalent. The same applied to BET specific surface areas. It is important to note that the alumina support was the same in all the cases.
The nature of supported chromium species has been shown to depend on various factors. Some of the factors reported in the literature include the nature of the support, the amount of deposited chromium, the degree of hydration and the calcination temperature. The results presented here indicate important changes in the nature of the chromic oxide species formed as a function of the chromium precursor. They showed that several oxidation states of chromium can be present simultaneously. It has been reported that at low chromium contents, the dominant surface oxidation state is Cr(VI), while the Cr(III) phase appears in catalysts with high chromium content [2]. Laser Raman spectroscopic results show condensation of the chromate species. Species containing Cr6+ and Cr3+ can be observed. In the Carbox samples, polymeric species (possibly trichromates and tetrachromates) are observed. Although Vuurman et al. [2]only found α-Cr2O3 crystallites at higher chromium loadings, in our catalysts, they were found at very low loadings. Under equal chromium loading, it has also been reported that the nature of the support is a determining factor for the degree of oligomerization of chromia species [4]. Here, this is shown to depend on the precursor used. Above monolayer coverage, Cr3+ was always found in the samples. The occurrence of Cr3+ is related to the formation of α-Cr2O3, and according to Fouad et al. [12], also to the presence of highly dispersed Cr3+ species. In contrast to literature reports 2, 4, we detected Cr3+ in our Carbox catalysts even at low Cr loadings.
The reaction temperature was well above that of carboxylate degradation. Therefore, the degradation stage does not imply any sintering supplementary to that resulting from the experimental conditions of the catalytic test. The ligands degrade to carbon and water oxides, without poisoning the catalyst by the formation of solid deposits likely to clog the catalytic sites or alter the structure.
The data obtained by XPS indicate that there is no formation of a monolayer of the chromia phase on the alumina support. After the catalytic test and reoxidation, the Cr/Al ratio of the Carbox catalysts decreased, except for Carbox2. This indicated that, to different extents, the dispersion of the carboxylate-based catalysts tends to decrease. Such is not the case for the Cral catalyst used as the reference. For this catalyst, redispersion occurred after catalytic test and reoxidation, reaching a Cr2p/Al2p atomic ratio value higher than that of the fresh catalyst and approximately double to that of the Carbox with the highest Cr2p/Al2p atomic ratio. One difference between these catalysts is that Cral was prepared using chromic acid which interacts strongly with the support, whereas the Carbox catalysts were prepared with aqueous solutions of the Cr salts. This may result in different support surfaces that interact differently with the Cr species.
The difference between Carbox and Cral with respect to the relative concentrations of Cr6+ and Cr3+ species is striking. Since the catalysts were calcined in air, grafted Cr6+ was formed. This species would distribute on the alumina surface by anchoring through Al–O–Cr bridges as monomeric species. Cavani et al. [9]observed by means of UV–Vis–NIR DRS that the maximum amount of these species is 1.5 wt% CrO3, the same for all the samples studied. A rather strong chromium precursor–support interaction is needed for this anchoring to occur, which is likely only when chromic acid is used. This interaction might be the driving force for redispersion of Cr on the support surface after regeneration. Carboxylates impregnated catalysts showed a similar behavior as those impregnated with chromium nitrate. In both cases, there is weak precursor–support interaction, which leads to segregation of the chromia phase after catalytic test. In the case of carboxylates, the formation of chromium polymers might further favor this segregation. The Cr2p/Al2p surface atomic ratios observed by XPS prior to and after catalyst test supports this statement.
Some information about the state of this strongly interacting Cr6+ species is obtained from the Cr2p spin–orbit splitting (ΔEs,o), which reflects exchange interactions between 2p and unpaired electrons. Thus, ΔEs,o is at a maximum for Cr3+ (three unpaired 3d electrons) and a minimum for Cr6+ (no unpaired electrons). The decrease in the binding energy for Cr3+ of the Cr2p3/2 peak and the reduced value of its spin–orbit splitting, ΔEs,o, has been related in the literature both with the increase in metal dispersion and the metal–support interaction [13]. However, the anchoring of Cr6+ to the surface does not necessarily account for this behavior. The spin–orbit splitting of the Cr2p doublet in a mildly reduced Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst depends on the chromia content, while the binding energy remains nearly constant (14). By analogy with the results obtained by Best et al. [15]and Merryfield et al. [13]for the Cr(III) doublet in the chromia/SiO2 system, it might be suggested that the low ΔEs,o (9.0 eV) values found for Cr3+ in Cral catalysts indicate interaction between chromia species and the Lewis acid centers of the alumina. Grünert et al. [7]observed that the Cr2p/Al2p intensity ratio was markedly increased after reduction, especially at lower chromia contents. In our case, this increase was only observed in the Cral catalysts. Low chromium content of these catalysts does not allow to assume a pore clogging due to loading, an effect observed for higher chromia contents by Bremer et al. [16]. Obviously, the results obtained for the Cr3+/Cr6+ ratio might indicate that at low chromia contents, the greater interaction between the Cr precursor and the support might stabilize Cr principally at 6+ oxidation state. As stated in Section 3, the BE values for Cr3+ are higher than those usually reported for these species. A peak with a similar BE value has been reported for alumina-supported Cr and has been ascribed to the binding energy contribution attributed to Cr5+ [14]. Similar studies have been carried out with silica-supported chromia catalysts by Jagannathan et al. [17]. As can be observed in Table 3 once the catalyst reoxidates, the Cr5+ concentration is increased or stays at the initial values in practically all the cases (Carbox3). It is surprising that in O2 atmosphere and at 673 K, not all the Cr3+ reaches oxidation state 6+. Cimino et al. [18]have reported that Cr5+ is observed on zirconia in a square pyramidal configuration together with mononuclear Cr6+ species.
Weckhuysen et al. [19]proposed that part of the Cr3+ is incorporated in the vacant octahedral sites of the spinel surface. Diffusion into these vacant Al3+ sites is facilitated by the similar ionic radii and charge of Cr3+ and Al3+. This might account for the Cr3+ concentration increase with respect to fresh catalysts, as shown by the amplitude of the δ-phase, Table 3. It might be stated that these occluded Cr3+ species on the surface had lower exposition to the oxidant agent used in reoxidation.
In all the cases, the β phase of Cr3+ increases after reoxidation of the used catalyst. This could be due to a probable polymerization of the chromium species caused by lower net surface potential of the medium where the carboxylates are. An approximation to the final architecture of the catalyst surface is offered by the results obtained by Raman spectroscopy. The chemistry of the surface oxide is different from that of the bulk oxide. Such architecture is defined by the interaction between the chromia phase and the surface of the support, which stabilizes different oxidation states and chromium coordinations.
In addition to the support occluded Cr3+ species, Cr3+ species might exist on the catalyst surface under at least two other forms: amorphous or crystalline Cr3+ oxides, and α-Cr2O3 crystalline phase. XRD does not show the diffraction lines corresponding to α-Cr2O3. It is evident that the Cr3+ is dispersed in amorphous or microcrystalline phase (undetectable by XRD). On the other hand, Cavani et al. [9]observed α-Cr2O3 crystallites when the CrO3 contents are above 7–8 wt%.
The Raman bands assigned to polymeric species are well defined for all Carbox, though not for Cral. According to our observations, tri- and tetrameric structures co-exist (Cr3O2−10 and Cr4O2−13). Due to poor resolution of the band at 904 cm−1 (Cr′O3 in the model by Vuurman et al. [4]), it is not clear which of them prevails.
Monomeric species were only observed in Carbox2 and in Cral. It can therefore be said that polymeric and monomeric species coexist in Cral, while most of the chromium species are monomeric and thus free to form new surface arrays between the catalytic test-reoxidation cycles.
It can be inferred that weak metal–support interaction is the cause of polymerization in Carbox. Besides, XRD only shows the most intense band of a polymer in Carbox, which is indicative not only of its presence but also of the formation of aggregates large enough to be detected by this technique.
4.2. Relationship between chromium species and catalyst stability
The structure and aggregation of the species indicated that Cr3+, Cr5+ and Cr6+ form different kinds of compounds of different reducibility and probably catalytic behavior. It can be stated that selectivity is related to Cr3+ species since Carbox3, due to its higher activity and similar selectivity, presents higher yield to propylene. This matches observations by Gorriz et al. [8]. Moreover, selectivity also depends upon the free surface of the alumina, Gorriz et al. [20].
Cr5+ species might be indicative of initial activity levels. However, these species, according to Cimino et al. [18], might occlude in the Cr6+ configurations. Since the concentration and array of Cr6+ vary, it is not possible to accurately establish a relationship between initial activity and Cr5+ concentration.
If only the relative amount of surface chromium atoms is taken into account, it becomes difficult to establish some kind of correlation. In order to make this clear, it is necessary to note that Cral presents monomeric species and because of its precursor (chromic acid), it has a high metal–support interaction. Even though Cr presents higher dispersion in this catalyst (Cr2p/Al2p surface atomic ratio from XPS), the higher metal–support interaction might give rise to the formation of inactive species. As described in Section 4.1, Cr3+ might occlude into the alumina structure exchanging for Al3+. These species would thus be occluded in the alumina matrix. This is not the case of Carbox2, which also presents monomeric species but these do not redisperse, probably because they have little interaction with the support and they are in a polymeric species medium.
According to De Rossi et al. [21], the linear correlation between dehydrogenation activity and Cr concentration indicates that mononuclear chromium is the active site. The results reported by Kytokivi et al. [10]are consistent with this conclusion, because even the low-loaded catalysts, in which dispersion presumably is at atomic level, were active.
From the observations of the present study, it is not possible to establish correlations of catalytic activity. However, some relationships between catalyst stability and final architecture of each precursor can be proposed.
In all the cases in which the carboxylate precursors did not present monomeric species together with polymeric ones, there is segregation after the catalytic test-reoxidation cycle. Segregation was accompanied by a decrease of the activity in the second run. Such a decrease is not proportional to the degree of segregation, but is related to the type of polymerization of the chromia phase. However, as observed by phase βCr3+ of EPR, there is always polymerization after the catalytic test-reoxidation cycle. Carbox3, which exhibits the highest activity decrease, additionally polymerizes to the detectable formation of α-Cr2O3. In Cral, which only showed monomeric species, there is redispersion of the chromia phase accompanied by an important activity decrease (from 51% to 28%). Only Carbox2 presents no change of initial activity or dispersion of the chromia phase. From the analysis of the ΔEs,o values, Carbox2 is the one presenting highest interaction with the support. This confirms the assumption put forward by Kytokivi et al. [10]as regards the occlusion of Cr3+ in the structural defects of the alumina, substituting for the Al3+. It could be inferred that the surface array of monomeric species in a polymeric species ambient stabilizes the catalyst architecture. Probably, the Cr3+ included in the alumina matrix is an additional factor of anchoring.
Considering the catalyst surface architecture, deactivation might be determined by the occlusion of Cr3+ in the alumina matrix. Apparently, the alumina is able to incorporate a considerable amount of chromium as compared to the total chromium of the catalysts under study. Those catalysts which incorporate the maximum amount of Cr3+ allowed by the support during calcination showed minor changes between each catalytic cycle. The chromium incorporated to the alumina matrix might be related to the δ-phase observed by EPR. This phase corresponds to isolated chromium and is not susceptible to oxidation or reduction. These species are not active and those catalysts which initially have amounts of occluded Cr3+ in the alumina close to equilibrium exhibit less activity changes between cycles.
5. Conclusions
Catalysts prepared with chromium carboxylates as precursor show Cr3+ even at low chromium loadings.
Carboxylates provide surface polymers while chromic acid does not. Low metal–support interaction might be the major cause of polymerization in Carbox. These polymeric aggregates are large enough to be detected by XRD and they increase between catalytic cycles due to higher polymerization accompanied by segregation. The interaction between the chromia phase and the support surface, which stabilizes different oxidation states of coordination of the chromia species, defines the surface architecture.
The Cr3+ species can exist on the catalyst surface under at least two forms. Part of the Cr3+ is incorporated in the vacant octahedral sites of the spinel surface. The larger extension of this phenomenon in Cral might be responsible for surface inactive species which cause a loss of catalytic activity. Another portion of Cr3+ might be amorphous or microcrystalline Cr3+ such as the polymeric α-Cr2O3 species.
The presence of species containing Cr5+ was observed in all cases even after reoxidation. Cr5+ could be in a square pyramidal configuration in the Cr6+ oxide structure.
Catalysts impregnated with carboxylates are more stable between cycles of catalytic activity because the attack to the support surface is avoided, thus decreasing the possibility of impregnant–support reaction for the formation of inactive species. However, deactivation between cycles might depend on the catalyst stabilization by the incorporation of Cr3+ in the support structure.
The surface array of monomeric species in a polymeric species ambient stabilizes the catalyst architecture, also conferring catalytic stability between cycles.
Chromium carboxylates constitute an interesting precursor for the control of surface species in chromia/Al2O3 catalysts.
