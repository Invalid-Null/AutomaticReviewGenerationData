Atomic Layer Deposition Overcoating Improves Catalyst Selectivity and Longevity in Propane Dehydrogenation

Abstract
Propylene, a precursor for commodity chemicals and plastics, is produced by propane dehydrogenation (PDH). An increase in PDH yield via added catalyst activity, lifetime, or selectivity represents significant energy and economic savings. Using Pt dispersed on Al2O3 extrudate supports as a commercially relevant model system, we demonstrate that atomic layer deposition (ALD) metal oxide overcoats, used to tailor metal-active sites, can increase PDH yield and selectivity. We investigate the interplay of Pt loading, ALD overcoat thickness, and Al2O3 support surface area on PDH activity, selectivity, and catalyst stability to show that applying a 6–8 Å thick layer of Al2O3 on low-surface area Al2O3 supports of ∼90 m2/g surface area yields the optimal combination of stability and activity, while increasing propylene selectivity from 91 to 96%. Increased stability upon steaming deactivation occurs because the Al2O3 overcoat prevents the Pt nanoparticles from sintering. We speculate that the ALD overcoat selectively binds to the undercoordinated sites on the Pt nanoparticles, while leaving the more selective terrace sites available for dehydrogenation.

1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propylene is a crucial chemical building block for the production of chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, and propylene oxide. (1) Today, propylene is produced primarily via steam and fluidized catalytic cracking of naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts. Recently, increases in shale gas production have resulted in a downward trend in the price of the propane and therefore increased interest in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a source of propylene. (2,3) Among the multiple metals known to catalyze dehydrogenation where catalysts have been industrially commercialized, platinum-based catalysts are among the most successful. (4,5) Platinum-based catalysts/processes are both highly active and very selective to the desired product. However, under the high reaction temperature (∼600 °C) required for PDH, sintering of platinum nanoparticles can occur, which lowers the available surface area of platinum used to catalyze the reaction. With increased sintering, the activity and selectivity to propylene decreases significantly. A technique developed in the field to counteract these effects is frequent regeneration under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse the platinum nanoparticles, but frequent regeneration reduces the lifetime of the catalyst materials. (5,6)
In addition to PDH, sintering of the supported metal nanoparticles is a major technical issue limiting the lifetime and performance of many commercial heterogeneous catalysts. Consequently, in the field of heterogeneous catalysis, there is a tremendous incentive to mitigate sintering and improve catalyst longevity. One strategy for synthesizing sinter-resistant catalysts is overcoating a protecting layer to inhibit active nanoparticle mobility. Because of its self-limiting surface reaction nature, atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been utilized as a well-controlled method to deposit overlayers on powdered oxide-supported nanoparticles, which have been utilized in gas and liquid phase catalytic reactions. (7−14) Feng et al. demonstrated that palladium catalyst sintering can be inhibited by adding ALD Al2O3 overcoats. The catalytic activities for methanol decomposition improved by preventing the loss of the active surface area during the reaction. Using CO as a probe molecule, they found that the Al2O3 deposited by ALD preferentially nucleates at the corners, steps, and edges of the palladium nanoparticles, while leaving the catalytically active Pd (111) facets accessible. (15) Lu et al. overcoated palladium nanoparticles with an Al2O3 ALD layer, which effectively reduced deactivation by both coking and sintering in the high-temperature oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane to ethylene. In their study, the yields of all products quickly decreased to zero in less than 30 min on uncoated Pd/Al2O3. However, after 45 cycles of Al2O3 ALD, the catalyst showed a dramatic improvement in ethylene yield and stability for ∼1700 min. (10) Using a similar overcoating technique, Zhang et al. applied TiO2 ALD overcoating to copper chromite catalysts, preserving 75% of the activity for 2-furfuraldehyde hydrogenation. (16)
Most studies in the ALD literature focus on powders, but for industrial catalytic application, formed technical bodies such as extrudates are utilized. (17,18) Commercially, powders are converted to extrudates before Pt is impregnated. Therefore, a major area to be investigated for application of ALD processes to catalysis is whether conformal coatings can be achieved in high-surface area, nonplanar substrates such as oxidic extrudates. In this work, we investigate the benefits of ALD overcoating to improve the stability of an industrially relevant, extruded Pt catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane. Neither nonoxidative dehydrogenation nor difficult-to-coat substrates have been previously studied in this context. In these Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, we focus on incorporation of Al or Ti overcoats throughout the length and width of the extruded catalyst. Further, we investigate the interplay of Pt loading, ALD overcoat thickness, and the surface area of the alumina support on propane dehydrogenation activity, selectivity, and catalyst stability. Importantly, the Pt nanoparticle size is not affected by the ALD process, and we utilize H2 chemisorption as a key technique to understand the extent of overcoating on Pt nanoparticles. High-temperature steaming, a surrogate for deactivation via time on stream, does sinter Pt nanoparticles in non-overcoated catalysts, but the Al2O3 overcoating protects against sintering while increasing selectivity to propylene in propane dehydrogenation.

2.1. Catalyst Synthesis
Alumina extrudates were synthesized by peptizing Versal-251, a boehmite alumina produced by UOP, with nitric acid and extrusion as 1/16″ cylinders. The Al2O3 extrudates were calcined in air using a 3 °C/min ramp rate and held for 6 h at 500, 600, 750, 1050, or 12 h at 1185 °C to adjust the surface area and porosity. Pt was impregnated at 0.1 and 0.5 wt % using H2PtCl6 solutions of the appropriate concentration at a 1:1 solution:extrudate volume at room temperature. Impregnated catalysts were then oxidized using a ramp rate of 5 °C/min and held for 3 h at 500 °C in air prior to reduction in 5% H2/N2 using a ramp rate of 2 °C/min and held for 12 h at 500 °C. For catalysts comprising extrudates previously calcined at 1185 °C, this oxidation and reduction was performed at 250 °C. Al2O3 ALD was performed on the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst extrudates at 200 °C and between 5–20 Torr, using alternating exposure to trimethylaluminum (TMA) and deionized water in an ALD fixed-bed reactor (Forge Nano Inc., Prometheus P6). Each precursor was actively heated to 40 °C to maintain a consistent vapor pressure and entrained slowly, limited by a needle valve set to 10–15 um, to limit the reactive precursors from bypassing the bed. This half cycle exposure time varied from 20 min to 2 h depending on the surface area of the substrate. Purge times were similarly long and established from precursors and byproduct in situ mass spectrometry signals returning to baseline. Typically, these ALD treatments were carried out on 3 g of the substrate. TiO2 ALD was performed on the same reactor using alternating exposure to titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and deionized water at 150 °C. An integrated mass spectrometer on the reactor exhaust monitored the ALD reaction in real time. (19) Prior to deposition, the catalyst extrudates were degassed under a nitrogen flow at 300 °C to remove adventitious water from the surfaces before lowering the temperature to the deposition temperature and proceeding with the ALD process. We categorize these catalysts as ncAlO/x%Pt/m. n represents the number of Al2O3 ALD cycles, x represents the initial Pt loading (in wt %), and m represents the support name for the Al2O3 extrudates listed in the last column of Table 1.

2.2. Characterization
N2 physisorption was measured at 77 K with a porosimeter (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, ASAP 2020 analyzer) to characterize both the specific surface area and changes in pore size. Prior to the measurement, the samples were degassed overnight at 250 °C. Thermogravimetric analysis (TA Instruments, Discovery TGA 5500) was used to investigate the moisture loss from the extrudates. In the TGA experiments, around 20 mg of an extrudate was placed in a crucible. The crucible was heated from room temperature to 800 °C at the rate of 5 °C/min in air passed through a VICI purifier at a flow rate of 45 sccm. The thickness of the Al2O3 and TiO2 thin films was measured using a J. A. Woollam alpha-SE variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometer (VASE). The data were obtained over a wavelength of 380–900 nm and an incidence angle of 70°. Elemental compositions of the samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) and alumina phase by XRD. ICP-MS utilized a Perkin-Elmer NexION 300D, while XRD was performed on a Bruker D4 in Bragg–Brentano mode using a Cu Kα source. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images were taken at the Electron Microscopy Center at the Argonne National Laboratory using a FEI Talos Scanning Transmission Electron Microscope. The Pt particle sizes were determined using ImageJ software by counting about 100 to 200 particles from the images for each sample. (20) The scanning transmission electron microscope is equipped with an energy-dispersive spectrometer. The lamellas for energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS) mapping were prepared using a Zeiss 1540XB focused ion beam-scanning electron microscope (FIB-SEM). H2 chemisorption was performed on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer using the double isotherm method. (21) The samples were reduced in H2 at 500 °C and then re-oxidized at 40 °C. After flowing helium, H2 chemisorption was performed at 40 °C to generate the first isotherm, which gives the total amount of chemisorbed hydrogen. After flowing additional He, a second H2 isotherm was generated at 40 °C, providing the reversible bound chemisorbed hydrogen. The difference between the two isotherms gives the irreversible chemisorbed hydrogen, corresponding to the hydrogen adsorbed on the Pt surface. The two isothermal curves were obtained in the 70 to 400 mmHg pressure domain. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was carried out using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer equipped with an iS50 Automated Beam splitter exchanger (ABX). Catalysts were first reduced at 500 °C for 1 h in 2.8% H2/Ar, cooled down to room temperature in 30 mL/min He, exposed to 30 mL/min 1% CO/He for 10 min, and then purged with 30 mL/min He for 2 min. The spectra were collected during He flush. After that, the sample temperature was increased to 500 °C in 30 mL/min He. The samples were then exposed to air at 30 mL/min for 1 h, purged with He for 20 min, and then reduced in 2.8% H2/Ar for 1 h. After reduction, the samples were cooled down to room temperature and exposed to 30 mL/min 1% CO/He for 10 min followed by a purge with 30 mL/min He. All spectra were collected during He flush. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements were conducted at the Pt L3 edge (∼11,564 eV) at beamline 10-BM of the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team (MRCAT) at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at the Argonne National Laboratory. The XAS spectra were recorded in the transmission mode. The samples were pressed into a cylindrical holder that can hold six samples simultaneously. The loading of the sample was optimized to achieve a step height of 1. Before measurement, the samples were fully reduced in 3.5% H2/He at 250 °C for 30 min and subsequently cooled to room temperature in ultrahigh purity helium.
2.3. Measurement of Catalytic Activity
The catalytic reaction for propane dehydrogenation was carried out in a vertical quartz tubular reactor with a diameter of 10 mm. The quartz tube reactor was placed within a furnace. The catalyst was supported on quartz wool with an internal thermocouple monitoring the reaction temperature of the catalyst bed. Approximately 120 mg of 0.5 wt % Pt catalysts and 600 mg of 0.1 wt % Pt catalysts were crushed to 60–80 mesh and then loaded for testing. For catalysts with ALD overcoating, the amount of catalysts added was adjusted to maintain the same Pt content in the reactor based on the Pt loading from ICP analysis. Two grams of quartz sand (80 mesh size) was used to dilute the catalyst to improve temperature uniformity.
Steaming of the catalysts was performed at 700 °C for 1 h using the same quartz tubular reactor. Steam was introduced into the reactor tube by bubbling nitrogen (50 mL/min) through a water bubbler. The bubbler was placed inside an oil bath, and the temperature was maintained at 70 °C. The steaming temperature was monitored by a thermocouple inserted into the catalyst bed.
The catalysts were reduced in 10% H2/Ar for 30 min at 500 °C before the catalytic measurement. The ALD-overcoated catalysts were calcined in air at 500 °C for 1 h before reduction. The reactant mixture consisted of 50/50 vol % of hydrogen (Airgas, 99.999%) and propane (Airgas, 99.5%) in down flow mode with a total flow of 260 mL/min. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), defined as the volume flow rate of feed in ml/min divided by catalyst loading in volume, is 78,000 h–1 for 0.1 wt % Pt catalysts and 390,000 h–1 for 0.5 wt % Pt catalysts. The GHSV is 26,000,000 mL h–1gPt–1 on Pt basis, which is the same for both 0.1 wt % and 0.5 wt % Pt catalysts because the same Pt content was kept in the reactor. The reaction was carried out at 600 °C at atmospheric pressure.
The concentration of the reactants and products was measured by an online gas chromatograph (Agilent, 6890 GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using a capillary column (Agilent, HP-Plot Al2O3–S). The propane conversion, product selectivity, and propylene yields were calculated directly as follows:
3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Characterization of Al2O3 Extrudates
In catalyst synthesis, using high surface area oxide supports can help to disperse and stabilize Pt nanoparticles. However, in terms of ALD coating, a low substrate surface area is favorable because less time and quantity of ALD precursors are needed to saturate the substrate surface. To investigate the effects of the support surface area on the ALD overcoating process, Al2O3 extrudates were calcined at 500, 600, 750, 1050, or 1185 °C. Table 1 shows the expected result; increasing the support calcination temperature results in a decrease in the surface area as well as the pore volume, falling from ∼280 to ∼8 m2/g, as the consecutive phase transitions from γ-Al2O3 through Θ-Al2O3 to α-Al2O3 are observed by XRD (Figure S1). (22) Multiple batches of each calcination were performed, showing about ±4% difference in the surface area and pore volume in N2 physisorption experiments. The moisture content retained inside the extrudates was measured by TGA, and the results are shown in Figure S2. The decrease in moisture loss with the rise of calcination temperature can be attributed to the loss of surface area and thus surface hydroxyls. Water loss is thus a proxy for the amount of Al(CH3)3 required during the ALD overcoating step because more Al(CH3)3 is required to react with surface hydroxyls to reach saturation for support with a higher surface area.
3.2. Characterization of Pt Nanoparticles
Following Pt impregnation on the supports characterized above, Figure 1 shows representative STEM images of the uncoated Pt catalysts, where the Pt nanoparticles were highly dispersed on support Al2O3 extrudates. The average Pt nanoparticle sizes are listed in Table 2. With the exception of 0.5%Pt/ultralow SA, which has the largest Pt nanoparticle size (1.12 ± 0.36 nm) because of the limited surface area on which to disperse Pt, all 0.1 and 0.5 wt % Pt-loaded catalysts have average nanoparticle sizes around 0.9 nm with narrow size distributions. The amount of the H2 chemisorbed per Pt is similar for each 0.1 and 0.5 wt % Pt catalyst; moreover, the increase in Pt loading (5 times more from 0.1 to 0.5 wt %) leads to around 5 times more H2 chemisorbed (4.5 to 24.0 μmol/g), demonstrating the formation of similar-sized Pt nanoparticles. Again, the only exception is catalyst 0.5%Pt/ultralow SA, where larger and unevenly dispersed Pt nanoparticles are formed. For this catalyst, the amount of H2 chemisorbed is only 15.9 μmol/g. Peak intensity of the Fourier transformed EXAFS spectra is known to reflect the average nanoparticle size and is shown in Figure S3. (23) Peak intensities are similar among the four catalysts studied in Figure S3a,b (0.1 and 0.5 wt % Pt on both medium and ultrahigh SA supports), again indicating that the average Pt nanoparticle sizes are similar. For catalysts on ultralow SA support, the higher peak intensity suggests larger Pt nanoparticle formation (Figure S3c). The platinum dispersion and the average Pt nanoparticle size calculated accordingly are listed in Table 2, (24) which are similar to the diameters from the STEM measurements, which demonstrates the close agreement between these two techniques.

3.3. Characterization of the Material Properties after ALD
While ALD is capable of conformal coverages even in situations where nonconformal coverage could be expected, depositing materials by ALD on porous supports is significantly more complicated than on planar supports. Reaction kinetics and diffusion of the precursors and products into and away from reaction sites within formed bodies can be slow. Thus, an understanding of precursor penetration into the Al2O3 extrudates is very important. Because it is not feasible to distinguish Al2O3 deposited by ALD from Al2O3 extrudates, TiO2 ALD (TiCl4 and H2O as precursors at 150 °C) was utilized to understand precursor penetration behavior. To demonstrate the precise control of deposition at the atomic level for both Al2O3 and TiO2 ALD, ex situ spectroscopic ellipsometry was used to measure the thin film thickness after 50, 100, and 200 cycles of Al2O3 and TiO2 ALD on clean Si (100) wafers. The results are shown in Figure S4. The thickness of Al2O3 and TiO2 increases linearly as a function of ALD cycles with the growth rate of 1.2 and 0.4 Å per cycle, respectively. By extrapolating the linear fit to the x-axis, the intercept crossed very near to the origin, which shows that there is negligible delay before film growth starts. The growth rate for both ALD processes is equivalent to values reported in the literature. (25,26)Figure 2 displays the EDS mapping analysis of medium SA Al2O3 extrudates after five cycles of TiO2 ALD. The four samples shown were extracted from various portions of the Al2O3 extrudates with the help of a micromanipulator in the FIB-SEM. Regardless of the location, EDS maps show a homogeneous distribution of Ti throughout the extrudates. Compared with other ALD reactions, Al2O3 ALD using TMA and H2O has the highest reaction enthalpy, which makes it very efficient and self-limiting. The saturation of the ALD precursors for both Al2O3 and TiO2 has been well controlled. If TiO2 can be deposited by ALD throughout the extrudates, it is highly possible for Al2O3.
Figure 2
Figure 2. Dark field STEM images and the corresponding EDS maps on four different parts of TiO2-coated medium SA extrudates.
N2 physisorption analysis was carried out to investigate the surface area and porosity change after different cycles of Al2O3 ALD overcoating. As shown in Figure 3, a negligible change in the total surface area and pore volume occurs after 0.1 and 0.5 wt % Pt impregnation, but the total surface area and pore volume decreased with subsequent cycles of Al2O3 ALD. We therefore posit well-controlled layer-by-layer Al2O3 deposition by ALD. The relative decrease in surface area as a function of ALD cycles is dependent on the starting surface area, but is typically about 30% of the starting value by the 7th cycle.
Figure 3

A comparison between 0.1%Pt/ultrahigh SA and 0.5%Pt/ultrahigh SA catalysts prepared on the same batch of extrudate shows that the surface area (Figure 3a) and pore volume (Figure 3b) after the same number of ALD cycles are very close, demonstrating the excellent repeatability for the ALD overcoating process and the minimal effect of Pt loading on the ALD process. For catalysts on the low SA support, there is no analytically detectable surface area change after Al2O3 ALD overcoating (Figure 3g). Based on the growth rate of 1.2 Å per cycle, the thickest Al2O3 layer deposited after seven cycles of ALD is ∼0.9 nm, which is not thick enough to change the surface area of the support with the largest average pore size ∼16.1 nm (cf. Table 1).
During the Al2O3 ALD process, the precursors TMA and H2O are sequentially dosed into the ALD chamber held at 200 °C under vacuum. STEM images were taken on catalyst 10cAlO/0.5%Pt/low SA to exclude the possibility of Pt nanoparticle size change after ALD. This catalyst has the highest possibility for Pt nanoparticle sintering during ALD because it spent the longest time in the ALD reactor and has a low surface area. As shown in Figure S5, the Pt particle size remains constant (0.83 ± 0.11 nm) after ALD. From these characterization results, we conclude that the ALD overcoating process does not alter the Pt nanoparticle size and that Pt loading does not significantly affect deposition of the overcoated layer.
IR spectra of CO chemisorption are shown in Figure S6. The broad CO peaks formed at a frequency of 2040–2090 cm–1 were assigned to linear-bonded CO on Pt. The weaker peaks at 1830 cm–1 were assigned to bridge-bonded CO on Pt. (27,28) For the catalyst 0.5%Pt/medium SA, after 5, 7, and 10 cycles of Al2O3 ALD, the intensity of the CO chemisorption peaks decreased, showing that the exposed Pt atoms are being covered by Al2O3 ALD. After calcination in air at 500 °C for 1 h, the CO peaks became more pronounced, which has been shown to be due to the nanopore formation in the overcoated Al2O3 layer. (29,30) The active surface of the underlying Pt nanoparticles is thus exposed, allowing propane dehydrogenation to occur.
H2 chemisorption was used to further quantify the accessibility of the Pt atoms before and after the ALD overcoating process. As shown in Figure 4a,b, the amount of adsorbed H2 decreases linearly with an increasing number of ALD cycles for both series of 0.1 and 0.5 wt % Pt catalysts, showing that the Pt nanoparticles were gradually coated with Al2O3 and the amount of deposited Al2O3 can be well controlled by the ALD process, even in these classical extruded forms. The relative decrease in surface Pt atoms is typically about 80% of the starting value after 7 cycles of Al2O3 ALD (5 to 1 μmol/g and 25 to 5 μmol/g for 0.1 and 0.5 wt % Pt catalysts, respectively). This linear decrease in Pt accessibility illustrates that ALD coats the Pt nanoparticles equivalently regardless of the support surface area. Because ALD processes deposit the precursor via reaction with surface hydroxyls, for lower surface area catalysts, less Al2O3 is deposited per cycle.

H2 chemisorption results for Al2O3 ALD-overcoated (c) 0.5%Pt/ultrahigh SA, (d) 0.5%Pt/high SA, (e) 0.5%Pt/medium SA, and (f) 0.5%Pt/low SA catalysts. Diamond markers indicate the as-prepared catalysts; circle markers indicate catalysts after air annealing; triangle markers indicate catalysts after 1 h steaming.
The circle markers in Figure 4c–f show the chemisorbed H2 amount for all the 0.5 wt % Pt catalysts investigated following air annealing. After annealing at 500 °C in flowing air for 1 h, additional Pt atoms were exposed, which shows the same results as in IR spectra of CO chemisorption (Figure S6). The absolute amount of chemisorbed H2 after ALD overcoating and after air annealing is listed in Table 3. The stability of the 0.5 wt % Pt catalysts after ALD overcoating and air annealing was tested following steam treatment at 700 °C for 1 h. As can be seen in Figure 4c–f, the triangle markers show the amount of chemisorbed H2 after steaming. The reduction in accessible Pt sites is inversely proportional to the number of Al2O3 ALD cycles. The trend for the adsorbed H2 amount after steaming is similar but with lower adsorbed H2 concentrations. Considering that Al2O3 gradually covers the surface Pt atoms with additional ALD cycles, this similarity suggests that smaller Pt nanoparticles (i.e., higher Pt dispersion) exist in the steamed catalysts with an increasing number of ALD cycles. The results suggest the use of Al2O3 ALD overcoating can improve the catalyst stability by preserving the Pt nanoparticle size.

3.4. Catalyst Testing Conditions
Dehydrogenation of propane is a highly endothermic reaction requiring heating to 500 to 700 °C and is subject to equilibrium limitations. We calculated the equilibrium conversion at varying C3H8 to H2 ratios in HSC Chemistry. (31−33) As shown in Figure S7a, the equilibrium conversion decreases with increasing H2 concentration. At our reaction conditions of 600 °C and C3H8:H2 molar ratio of 1:1, the equilibrium conversion is 36%. As shown in Figure S7b, the C3H8 conversion from thermal cracking decreases with the increase of the total gas flow rate. To minimize the effect of high thermal cracking conversion in the analysis of the catalytic performance, the total flow rate was set to 260 sccm. Here, in our reactor, propane conversion due to thermal cracking is below 1%.
3.5. Catalyst Performance
Figure 5 shows the C3H8 conversion vs reaction time for uncoated 0.1 and 0.5 wt % Pt catalysts. With increased time on stream, the C3H8 conversion decreased from ∼16 to ∼11% for all catalysts except for catalyst 0.5%Pt/ultralow SA (which decreased from 10% to 4%). The low C3H8 conversion (<10%) is due to the formation of unevenly distributed larger Pt nanoparticles (cf. Table 2) because at the same Pt loading, increases in the Pt particle size lead to a decrease in the number of surface Pt sites. Pt nanoparticle sintering is another possible reason to explain the low conversion for the ultralow surface area catalyst, which has a higher probability of encountering other Pt during the reaction. Thus, we did not utilize ALD overcoating for catalysts on ultralow surface area support.

Reaction condition: 1 atm, 600 °C; GHSV: 78,000 h–1 for 0.1 wt % Pt catalysts, 390,000 h–1 for 0.5 wt % Pt catalysts. Data were collected for 20 h with an interval of 20 min. To normalize the Pt loading for testing, the amount of 0.1 wt % Pt catalysts loaded is 5 times more than the 0.5 wt % Pt catalysts.
Figure S8a shows that the average Pt nanoparticle size remains the same after 20 h under reaction conditions for an uncoated catalyst (0.5%Pt/medium SA). Comparing the fresh versus spent catalysts (0.92 ± 0.19 nm versus 0.88 ± 0.11 nm, derived from STEM images), there is no obvious change of the Pt nanoparticle size. Deactivation observed during the 20 h of catalytic testing shown here is therefore largely due to coking and not Pt sintering. Because even 20 h on stream in the lab reactor cannot simulate long-term catalyst deactivation, steam treatment was used to simulate the long-term effects (weeks/months) under commercial reaction conditions. Figure S8b shows the average Pt nanoparticle size (1.96 ± 1.18 nm) after 1 h steam treatment at 700 °C, showing the growth of Pt nanoparticles after steaming. In addition, the decrease in the chemisorbed H2 amount shown in Figure 4c–f also suggests agglomeration of the Pt nanoparticles after steaming.
Thus, to test the ability of ALD to prevent long-term nanoparticle sintering, each catalyst was tested prior to and following a 1 h steam pretreatment. The C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield at the 10th hour of the reaction are shown in Figure 6 (0.5 wt % Pt) and Figure S9 (0.1 wt % Pt). The total bar height (combined trellis bar and diagonal bar height) represents the C3H8 conversion (top, a–d) or C3H6 yield (bottom, e–h) for each fresh catalyst (prior to steam pretreatment), while the diagonal bar height represents the C3H8 conversion (top, a–d) or C3H6 yield (bottom, e–h) for each catalyst following steam treatment. Thus, the trellis bar height represents the drop (absolute value) of C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield after steaming compared to fresh catalysts. Broadly, the goal of the ALD overcoating process is to maximize the diagonal bar height (representing the activity of the steamed catalyst) and minimize the trellis bar height (representing the activity loss after steaming), while keeping the total bar height (representing the activity of the fresh catalyst) similar even as Pt is overcoated. The changes in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield with time on stream for catalysts prior to and following steam pretreatment are quite parallel, which means that the delta of conversion and yield are very similar regardless of time. Thus, for brevity, we reported the data at the 10th hour, which is the middle point of the reaction.

(Diagonal bar: C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield for steamed catalysts; trellis bar: change in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield between fresh and steamed catalysts; 0 cycle represents the uncoated catalysts)
Generalizing, for all fresh catalysts, it is notable that the C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield do not substantially change as a function of ALD coating thickness. As summarized from previous studies, undercoordinated surface metal atoms (edge or corner) are sites for both metal sintering and coke formation. (34,35) These undercoordinated sites are also the most reactive sites toward ALD, and the overcoated Al2O3 appears to selectively cover those undercoordinated sites leading to improvements in longevity as well as faster C3H6 turnover frequency (defined as moles of C3H6 produced per second/mole of exposed Pt atoms determined by H2 chemisorption). (15,36,37) At the catalytic testing conditions, the C3H8 conversion for all catalysts we investigated is below ∼20%. This is nearly half of the equilibrium conversion (36%), thus excluding the possibility that the conversion is too close to equilibrium to tell the difference among catalysts.
In contrast, the C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield of the steamed catalysts (Figure 6 and Figure S9, diagonal bar height) increases as a function of ALD thickness, showing the improvement in catalyst longevity following ALD overcoating. The amount of the exposed Pt sites are similar after steaming (H2 chemisorption results in Figure 4), so the increase in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield with the additional ALD cycles suggests that more selective terrace sites are exposed and deactivation due to coking on undercoordinated sites is reduced, once again showing that the Al2O3 ALD blocked the less productive Pt sites for C3H6 formation. Because of the similar performance for fresh catalysts and improved performance for steamed catalysts, the change in C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield between the fresh and steamed catalysts (trellis bar height) is decreasing as a function of increasing ALD thickness, which shows that the activity loss is alleviated via ALD overcoating.
Figure 7 shows the product selectivity for all the 0.5 wt % Pt catalysts. The C3H6 selectivity is maintained or slightly increased as a function of ALD cycles and is accompanied by a decrease in selectivity for two major byproducts, CH4 and C2H6. The product selectivities reported here correspond to C3H8 conversion at ∼12% for all the fresh catalysts and ∼ 7% for all the steamed catalysts. The selectivities of CH4 and C2H6 for each catalyst are very similar, strongly suggesting that those two byproducts are mainly produced through hydrogenolysis reaction because the molar ratio for those two byproducts is 1:1 (C3H8 + H2 →CH4 + C2H6). The slight increase in C3H6 selectivity can be attributed to the inhibition of this hydrogenolysis reaction due to blockage of the undercoordinated surface Pt sites after Al2O3 ALD. The product selectivity for all the 0.1 wt % Pt catalysts is shown in Figure S10; the selectivity shows the same trend, which again suggests the improvement in C3H6 selectivity after Al2O3 ALD overcoating.

4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Through combined synthetic, characterization, and catalytic studies, we have shown that ALD overcoating can be applied to formed Pt catalysts (e.g., extrudates) to improve the performance of propane dehydrogenation reaction. Increased Pt nanoparticle stability to sintering during steam deactivation tests along with increasing selectivity to propylene during catalytic tests was observed with increasing Al2O3 ALD cycles. TiO2 ALD, which was performed to differentiate from the Al2O3 support, shows that the ALD precursor is able to penetrate the internal pores of the extrudates equally and that the overcoating reacts both with the support walls and the active metal (Pt). The gradual, nearly linear, decrease of the chemisorbed H2 amount on Pt nanoparticles with an increasing number of ALD cycles shows a very good control of layer-by-layer deposition, and STEM also demonstrates that the Pt nanoparticle size remains the same after ALD overcoating. While the number of accessible Pt sites after ALD overcoating is decreased, an increase in the number of accessible Pt sites after air annealing suggests nanopore formation in the ALD overcoat. This effect and agglomeration of Pt nanoparticles after steaming are shown through the use of H2 chemisorption.
The similarity of the C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield for each catalyst after ALD overcoating, which runs counter to the H2 chemisorption results, indicates that ALD-derived Al2O3 preferentially deposited on less active Pt sites for propane dehydrogenation. We speculate that the overcoat is selectively located on the undercoordinated sites (edges and corners), leaving the more selective terrace sites still available for dehydrogenation. As the number of ALD cycles increases, the selectivity to propylene is slightly improved, as C1 and C2 yields are reduced through reduction in hydrogenolysis. The overcoated catalyst shows improved performance in terms of resistance to sintering and appears to be optimized after five to seven ALD cycles (6–8 Å thickness of Al2O3 coating).

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
