The abstract indicates that this document discusses the use of encapsulated Pt-Sn intermetallic nanoparticles to catalyze the hydrogenation of propyne to propene with high pairwise selectivity, which is not directly related to propane dehydrogenation to propylene. No discussion of propane dehydrogenation or oxidative dehydrogenation was found.
