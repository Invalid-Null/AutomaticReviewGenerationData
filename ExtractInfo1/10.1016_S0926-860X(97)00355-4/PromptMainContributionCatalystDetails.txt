Regenerability of coked H-GaMFI propane aromatization catalyst:: Influence of reaction–regeneration cycle on acidity, activity/selectivity and deactivation
Abstract
The influence of the reductive reaction (deactivation)–oxidative regeneration cycle of the propane aromatization H-gallosilicate (MFI) zeolite catalyst on its surface and catalytic properties has been thoroughly investigated. The zeolitic strong acidity was measured by the chemisorption of pyridine at 400°C, TPD of ammonia from 330 to 600°C and acid catalyzed model reactions viz. toluene disproportionation at 500°C and m-xylene isomerization at 400°C. This acidity and also the external acidity of the zeolite (measured in terms of the isooctane cracking activity at 400°C) are decreased continuously due to a gradual degalliation of the zeolite during the reaction–regeneration cycles. The degalliation has resulted from the mild hydrogen treatment during the reaction and from the hydrothermal treatment by the steam produced in the oxidative regeneration. The degalliation is associated with a small decrease in the crystallinity, but with little or no change in the N2 sorption capacity of the zeolite. However, the propane conversion activity of the zeolite is increased because of the formation of active and well-dispersed extra-framework Ga-oxide species from the slow but continuous degalliation. The para-shape selectivity of the zeolite is also increased appreciably by increasing the regeneration cycle, mostly due to the increased diffusional resistance by the presence of additional Ga-oxide species (formed due to the continuous degalliation) in the zeolite channels. The deactivation due to coking of the zeolite in the propane aromatization is found to be faster for the regenerated zeolite because of its increased propane conversion activity.
1. Introduction
Aromatization of lower alkanes over Ga-modified ZSM-5 type zeolites is a process of practical importance 1, 2, 3. H-Galloaluminosilicate (MFI) zeolite shows high activity and selectivity in the aromatization process 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. The high aromatization activity/selectivity of this zeolite is attributed to its high activity for the dehydrogenation of alkane and naphthene intermediates 6, 9, 14. The active gallium species for the dehydrogenation are not the framework Ga 5, 9but the extraframework gallium species 5, 6, 8, 9, 15present in the zeolite due to their formation during zeolite synthesis or pretreatment 6, 9, 15. However, the extra-framework species alone are not active [8], rather, their combination with zeolitic acid sites is essential for high catalytic activity/selectivity in alkane aromatization 8, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17. The deactivation of this zeolite catalyst in the propane aromatization is, however, quite fast 6, 9, 10.
Because of the fast deactivation of the zeolite (within a few hours) in the propane aromatization, it is necessary to regenerate the zeolite catalyst by removing the coke deposited on it by oxidative treatment. It is, therefore, of both scientific and practical interest to study in detail the influence of regeneration cycles on the physico-chemical properties (viz. crystallinity, non-framework Ga-oxide species formed due to degalliation and zeolitic acidity) and on the catalytic activity and selectivity and deactivation due to coking of the zeolite catalyst in the propane aromatization. The present investigation was undertaken for this purpose.
2. Experimental
H-GaMFI (bulk Si/Ga=30.2, crystal size 6 μm and Na/Ga=0.02) was obtained by deammoniation of its NH4 form at 600°C for 1 h in a flow of moisture-free N2 (750 cm3 g−1 h−1). The NH4-GaMFI was prepared by exchanging repeatedly Na-GaMFI with aqueous ammonium acetate (1 M) solution at 80°C, washing with demineralized water, drying at 90°C for 4 h under vacuum, pressing binder-free and crushing to 0.2–0.3 mm size particles. The Na-GaMFI was synthesized by its hydrothermal crystallization from a gel of Na-trisilicate, gallium nitrate, TPA-Br, sulfuric acid and demineralized water in a SS autoclave at 180°C for 24 h. The TPA-GaMFI zeolite crystals were washed and dried at 120°C for 4 h and then calcined at 600°C in static air for 15 h to remove the occluded organic template.
The MFI structure of the zeolite was confirmed by XRD (using a Phillips diffractometer 1730 series and CuKα radiation). The incorporation of Ga in the zeolite framework was confirmed by the
MAS NMR peak at +156 ppm. The framework (FW) Si/Ga ratio of the zeolite was obtained from its
MAS NMR peaks: Si(0Ga) at −112 ppm and Si(1Ga) at −104 ppm, by the method described earlier [18]. The
and
MAS NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker MSL 300 MHz NMR instrument. The crystal size and morphology of the zeolite was studied by SEM (using a JOEL Scanning Electron Microscope). The zeolite particles are spherical agglomerates composed of tiny unit crystallites. The bulk Si/Ga ratio and Na-content of the zeolite samples were determined by chemical analysis.
The numbers of strong acid sites on the zeolite were measured in terms of the pyridine chemisorbed at 400°C. The acidity was determined by using the GC adsorption/desorption method [19]. The acid strength distribution of the zeolite was measured by temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of ammonia (chemisorbed at 100°C) from 50 to 600°C with a linear heating rate of 20°C.min−1 in a flow of He (7700 cm3 g−1 h−1). N2 sorption capacity of the zeolite was determined by measuring the sorption of N2 at liquid nitrogen temperature from a N2–He mixture (30 mol% N2), using a Quanta Chrome (USA) Surface Area Analyzer based on the dynamic adsorption–desorption technique.
The initial catalytic activity/selectivity of the zeolite in acid-catalyzed model reactions, [viz. isooctane cracking (at 400°C) for characterizing the external acidity, and m-xylene isomerization (at 400°C) and toluene disproportionation (at 500°C) for measuring the overall acidity] and also their initial aromatization activity in the reaction of propylene (at 400°C) and propane (at 550°C) were determined using a pulse microreactor (made up of a quartz tube with i.d.=4.5 mm and o.d.=6.0 mm and length=30 cm) packed with 0.1 g zeolite catalyst. The microreactor was connected directly to a gas chromatograph with FID and a computing integrator. The pulse reactions were carried out by injecting 0.4 μl of liquid reactant and 0.2 cm3 of gaseous reactant at the respective reaction temperatures. The reaction products were analyzed by the on-line GC, using a Porapak-Q (3 mm×3 m) and Bentone-34 (5%)-dinonylphthalate (5%) on Chromosorb-W (3 mm×5 m) columns. Moisture-free N2 (flow rate: 20 cm3.min−1) was used as a carrier gas. The pulse microreactor and procedures for evaluating the zeolite samples for their initial catalytic activity in the acid-catalyzed model reactions and aromatization reactions were described in detail earlier 10, 11.
Propane aromatization reaction (at 550°C) over the zeolite was carried out at atmospheric pressure in a continuous flow quartz reactor (i.d.=13 mm) provided with a Chromel-Alumel thermocouple in the center of the catalyst bed (containing 1 g catalyst), using a propane–nitrogen mixture (50 mol% propane) as a feed with a space velocity of 3100 cm3 g−1 h−1. The catalytic activity and selectivity were measured as a function of time-on-stream (up to about 4.5 h). The reaction products were analyzed by the on-line GC as described above. The zeolite catalyst deactivated (due to coking) in the propane aromatization after it was on-stream for about 4.5 h was regenerated in situ by subjecting it to the following sequence of the oxidative treatments in a flow of N2–air mixture (2500 cm3 g−1 h−1) with different concentrations of O2.
1. 1.0 mol% O2 at 400°C for 0.5 h.
2. 1.0 mol% O2 at 450°C for 0.5 h.
3. 1.6 mol% O2 at 550°C for 1.0 h.
4. 2.0 mol% O2 at 550°C for 1.0 h.
5. 5.0 mol% O2 at 550°C for 1.0 h.
After the regeneration, the time-on-stream activity of the regenerated zeolite was carried out as above. By following these catalyst deactivation–regeneration procedures, twelve regeneration cycles of the zeolite have been carried out. The fresh zeolite and the zeolite after 3rd and 12th regeneration were subjected to thorough characterizations. The activity and selectivity of the zeolite in the propane aromatization (at 550°C) in the absence of catalyst deactivation were measured at different space velocities by using a square pulse technique. This is done by passing the reaction mixture at different space velocities over the zeolite samples for a short period (2–5 min) under steady state and then replacing the reactant mixture by pure N2 during the period required for the product analysis. The reaction products of the square pulse experiment were analyzed by the on-line GC.
The conversion and selectivity in the catalytic reactions were obtained from the product distribution, as follows: conversion (%)=100−wt.% of reactant in products; product selectivity (%)=[(wt.% of particular product in reaction products)/(100−wt.% of reactant in products)]×100. The dehydrogenation/cracking (D/C) activity ratio was obtained from the products selectivities as follows: D/C activity ratio=[(100−selectivity for C1 and C2)/(selectivity for C1 and C2)].
3. Results
3.1. Time-on-stream activity/selectivity of fresh and regenerated zeolite
Results showing the variation of propane conversion and conversion-to-aromatics (or aromatics yield) with time-on-stream in the propane aromatization (at 550°C, GHSV=3100 cm3 g−1 h−1) over the fresh and 1–11th regenerated H-GaMFI zeolite are presented in Fig. 1Fig. 2.

The results show a strong influence of the regeneration cycle of the zeolite on its propane conversion and aromatization activity. Both the propane conversion and aromatization activities of the zeolite are increased markedly by increasing the regeneration cycle (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3). The product selectivity also seems to be strongly influenced by the zeolite regeneration cycle (Fig. 4). Also, there is an appreciable increase in the p-X/m-X ratio (X=xylene), indicating an increase in the para-shape selectivity of the zeolite with increasing the regeneration cycle (Fig. 5). The increase in the p-X/m-X ratio is, however, larger for the zeolite deactivated due to coking (i.e. when the zeolite is on the stream for a longer period).

Since product selectivity in the propane aromatization is strongly dependent on the propane conversion 9, 11, it is necessary to compare the fresh and regenerated zeolites at the same propane conversion (or isoconversion) levels. The fresh and 11th regenerated H-GaMFI zeolites are, therefore, compared for their product selectivity, para-shape selectivity (i.e. p-X/m-X ratio) and dehydrogenation/cracking (D/C) activity ratio in the propane aromatization at the isoconversions of propane (20, 30 and 45%) in Table 1. The comparison of the regenerated zeolite for its performance in the propane aromatization with the fresh zeolite at the three different isoconversions of propane shows clearly a strong influence of the regeneration on the product selectivity, para-shape selectivity and D/C activity ratio of the zeolite. The zeolite regeneration causes a decrease in the selectivity for aromatics and also in the D/C activity ratio, but an increase in the selectivity for propylene, ethylene, methane and ethane and C4 hydrocarbons. It also causes an appreciable increase in the p-X/m-X ratio and hence an increase in the para-shape selectivity of the zeolite.

After the 3rd and 12th regenerations of the zeolite, the residual carbon in the regenerated zeolite samples was determined by microanalysis. The amount of carbon which was retained after the zeolite regeneration is as follows.
Regeneration cycle 3rd 12th
Carbon on regenerated zeolite (wt.%) 0.3 0.17
This shows that the carbon removal from the coked zeolite by the oxidative treatment at 400–550°C (described earlier) is not complete. Yet the regenerated zeolite in both the cases (3rd and 12th regeneration) shows much higher propane conversion/aromatization activity than the fresh zeolite (Fig. 3). It may also be noted that the carbon retained on the 3rd regenerated zeolite sample is higher than that on the 12th regenerated zeolite sample. This indicates that the carbon removal in the zeolite regeneration is increased by increasing the regeneration cycle.
A comparison of the decrease in the propane conversion activity relative to the initial propane conversion activity, At/A0 (where At and A0=conversion of propane at the reaction time of t=t and t=0, respectively) with the time-on-stream for the fresh and regenerated zeolite (Fig. 6) indicates that the rate of deactivation due to coking of the regenerated zeolite is, in general, higher than that of the fresh zeolite. Thus the deactivation is also influenced by the regeneration.

3.2. Characterization of fresh and regenerated zeolite
The fresh and regenerated (in 3rd and 12th regeneration cycles) zeolite samples were characterized for their crystallinity, N2 sorption capacity (at liquid nitrogen temperature), FW-Si/Ga ratio and acidity/acid strength distribution by the chemisorption of pyridine (at 400°C) and TPD of ammonia (from 50 to 600°C) and also by the acid catalyzed model reactions (viz. m-xylene isomerization and toluene disproportionation reactions for the intracrystalline acidity and isooctane cracking for the external or intercrystalline acidity of the zeolite).
Results in Fig. 7 show that, because of the regeneration of the zeolite and the increase in the regeneration cycle, the crystallinity of the zeolite is decreased to a small extent, its FW-Si/Ga ratio is increased very appreciably but its N2 sorption capacity is decreased only to a very small extent. The increase in the FW-Si/Ga ratio indicates degalliation of the zeolite, resulting in the formation of extra-framework Ga-oxide species during the regeneration cycles. The crystallinity of regenerated zeolite was obtained from the XRD data by comparing the intensity of its XRD peaks at 2θ=22–25° with that of the fresh zeolite; the crystallinity of the fresh zeolite was assumed as 100%.

Results of the TPD of ammonia (chemisorbed at 100°C) on the fresh and regenerated zeolite samples from 50 to 600°C are presented in Fig. 8. The TPD curves for both the fresh and regenerated zeolite samples indicate the presence of weak, intermediate strength and strong acid sites corresponding to the TPD peaks below 200°C, between 200 to 330°C and above 330°C, respectively. It is interesting to note that the acidity (particularly the strong acid sites) of the zeolite is decreased after the regeneration. The variation in the strong acid sites (measured in terms of the NH3 desorbed above 330°C) and the weak and intermediate strength acid sites (measured in terms of the NH3 desorbed below 330°C) with the regeneration cycle is shown in Fig. 9(a). Both the strong and weaker acid sites are decreased appreciably by increasing the regeneration cycle. The strong acid sites measured in terms of the chemisorption of pyridine at 400°C are also found to be decreased appreciably by increasing the regeneration cycle (Fig. 9(b)).

The decrease in the acidity with the increase in the regeneration cycle was further confirmed by carrying out the m-xylene isomerization and toluene disproportionation reactions (which are catalyzed by acid sites) over the zeolite samples. Fig. 10 shows that both the xylene and toluene conversion activities, and hence zeolitic acid sites, are decreased by increasing the regeneration cycle. The isooctane cracking activity of the zeolite (Fig. 10) is also decreased by increasing the regeneration cycle. Since isooctane cannot penetrate the channels of pentasil (or ZSM-5 type) zeolites 20, 21, the isooctane cracking activity reflects the external or inter-crystalline acidity of the zeolite. Thus, the results of the acid-catalyzed model reactions show that both the internal and external acid sites of the zeolite are decreased by increasing the regeneration cycle.

3.3. Initial aromatization activity of fresh and regenerated zeolite
In order to find the influence of the regeneration cycle on the initial aromatization activity of the zeolite, the pulse reactions of propylene and propane over the fresh and regenerated zeolite at 400 and 550°C, respectively, have been carried out. The results are presented in Fig. 11. The aromatization activity of the zeolite in both the propane and propylene aromatization reactions is increased by increasing the regeneration cycle. However, the increase is much more pronounced for the propane aromatization. The increase in the propane-to-aromatics conversion activity is consistent with that observed in the continuous propane conversion reaction as a function of the time-on-stream (Fig. 2, Fig. 3(b)). It is interesting to note that the rate of propane aromatization on the fresh zeolite is lower, but that on the regenerated zeolite is higher than that of the propylene aromatization.

4. Discussion
4.1. Influence of regeneration on acidity
The results of the TPD of ammonia and the chemisorption of pyridine (at 400°C) and also those of the acid-catalyzed model reactions (viz. m-xylene isomerization and toluene disproportionation) indicate that the zeolitic acidity is decreased appreciably by increasing the regeneration cycle. The external acidity of the zeolite (measured in terms of the activity in the isooctane cracking reaction) is also decreased. A decrease in the acidity is consistent with the increase of the FW Si/Ga ratio of the zeolite. This clearly shows that the decrease in the acidity is mostly due to the degalliation of the zeolite, resulting in a decrease in the tetrahedral gallium (i.e. FW-Ga), which is responsible for the zeolitic strong acidity. The decrease in the strong acidity could also be due to the formation of (GaO)+ species from nonframework Ga2O3 by its reduction with H2 produced in the catalytic process, replacing zeolitic protons [22]. The continuous degalliation in the deactivation–regeneration cycles is because of the H2 treatment received by the zeolite during its time-on-stream for the propane aromatization, as hydrogen is produced in the reaction. The degalliation can also result from the thermal/hydrothermal treatments received by the zeolite in its oxidative regeneration because of the steam produced and a small increase in the temperature due to combustion of coke.
It may be noted that the T-sites in ZSM-5 type zeolites are not crystallographically identical; hence, the determination of the FW-Si/Ga ratio or FW-Ga from
MAS NMR is not very accurate [23]. Nevertheless, the changes in the FW-Si/Ga or FW-Ga are large enough and also are consistent with the change in the zeolite strong acidity, so we can draw a conclusion about the degalliation during the reaction–regeneration cycles.
4.2. Influence of regeneration on catalytic activity/selectivity and deactivation
The propane conversion and propane aromatization activity at the different times-on-stream are increased with the increase in the deactivation–regeneration cycle. The initial aromatization activity of the zeolite in the propylene and propane aromatization, measured by the pulse reaction technique, is also increased. An increase in the propane conversion/aromatization activity due to the reaction–regeneration cycles was also observed earlier in cases of the Ga-exchanged H-ZSM-5 zeolite [24]; it was attributed to the increased Ga dispersion and the formation of dispersed Ga species which are efficient for the heterolytic recombinative release of hydrogen. The regeneration cycles of Ga/H-ZSM-5 zeolite caused migration and redistribution of Ga and also a change in the chemical nature of the Ga-species [25].
Our earlier studies on H-GaMFI show that the degalliation of the zeolite due to various thermal and hydrothermal treatments results in a decrease not only in the zeolitic strong acidity but also in the propane conversion/aromatization activity 12, 13. On the contrary, in the present case, the degalliation causes a large increase in the catalytic activity of the zeolite. This is expected mostly because of a slow and gradual degalliation of the zeolite during the deactivation–regeneration cycles, resulting in active Ga-oxide species well dispersed in the close vicinity of the zeolitic acid sites (or FW-Ga), since a combination of both the Ga-oxide species and zeolitic acid site is essential for the high catalytic activity. But in the thermal and hydrothermal treatments, the degalliation is expected to be relatively much faster, causing agglomerization or segregation of the extra framework Ga-oxide species, which is expected to result in a non-uniform and/or poor dispersion of the Ga-oxide species. Nevertheless, the bifunctional catalytic activity of the zeolite is increased because of the deactivation–regeneration cycles.
In the aromatization of propane (at 550°C) and propylene (at 400°C), the fresh zeolite shows lower activity for the propane aromatization. But after the regeneration, it shows higher catalytic activity for the propane aromatization (Fig. 11). The lower propane aromatization activity of the fresh zeolite is due to its low propane dehydrogenation activity. But after the regeneration, the dehydrogenation activity of the zeolite is greatly enhanced due to the formation of well-dispersed active Ga-oxide species. Because of this and the higher reaction temperature, the rates for propane aromatization over the regenerated zeolite are higher.
The p-X/m-X ratio and hence the para-shape selectivity of the zeolite is increased by increasing the regeneration cycle (Fig. 5). The increase is, however, more pronounced when the zeolite is on-stream for a long period (i.e. when the zeolite is deactivated due to coking). The increased para-shape selectivity is mostly because of the formation of extra framework Ga-oxide species in the zeolite channels and the presence of bulky coke precursors at the channel intersections and coke at the outer surface of the zeolite crystallites. These are expected to cause an increase in the diffusion resistance by partially or completely blocking some of the channels and their openings and/or by reducing the effective channel diameter of the zeolite. The observed more pronounced effect on the coked zeolite is due to a combined effect produced by the Ga-oxide species and coke precursors in the channels and the coke deposited on the outer surface.
The rate of deactivation is increased appreciably after the regeneration (Fig. 6). This is expected because of the increased dehydrogenation activity of the zeolite after its regeneration. The carbon content of the 12th regenerated zeolite is found to be lower than that in the 3rd regenerated zeolite. This is mostly because of the presence of extra framework Ga-oxide species at higher concentration. Our earlier studies on the temperature programmed oxidation of coked H-GaMFI zeolite [26]also showed that the coke removal from the zeolite is easier (i.e. it occurs at lower temperature) because of the higher concentration extra-framework Ga-oxide species. It may be noted that, since the degalliation occurs continuously in the reductive reaction (deactivation)–oxidative regeneration cycles, the performance of the zeolite would be deteriorated after a large number of regeneration cycles because of the imbalance between the FW Ga (i.e. zeolitic acidity) and non-FW Ga, causing a irreversible catalyst deactivation.
5. Conclusions
The deactivation and regeneration studies on the propane aromatization H-GaMFI zeolite catalyst lead to the following important conclusions.
1. The reductive reaction (deactivation)–oxidative regeneration cycles result in a slow but gradual degalliation of the zeolite, causing a continuous decrease in both its external and its internal acidity but a large increase in its propane conversion/aromatization activity. The increased activity is mostly due to the formation of well-dispersed active Ga-oxide species in the slow but continuous degalliation during the reaction–regeneration cycles due to cyclic mild hydrogen and hydrothermal treatments.
2. The para-shape selectivity of the uncoked and coked zeolite is also increased continuously by increasing its reaction–regeneration cycles; the increase for the coked zeolite is more pronounced. This is because of the increased intracrystalline diffusional resistance due to the presence of the additional Ga-oxide species formed due to the degalliation and bulky coke precursors in the zeolite channels and the coke on the external surface of the zeolite.
3. The regeneration, however, causes a significant decrease in the aromatic selectivity and dehydrogenation/cracking activity ratio but an increase in the selectivity for ethylene, propylene and other hydrocarbons in the propane aromatization. It also causes an appreciable increase in the rate of deactivation (due to coking) due to the increased concentration of extra framework Ga-oxide species, which are responsible for the high dehydrogenation activity of the zeolite.
