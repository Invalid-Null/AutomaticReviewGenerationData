 Unfortunately the provided excerpts do not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation research. Since there are no details provided on catalyst composition, performance metrics, or reaction conditions related to propane dehydrogenation, I cannot synthesize a meaningful summary. The documents focus on n-heptane hydroisomerization and do not discuss propane, propylene or any propane dehydrogenation process.
