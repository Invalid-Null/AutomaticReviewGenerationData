The document does not appear to be relevant, as it does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The abstract mentions oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, but the focus seems to be on synthesizing and characterizing a boron-substituted MCM-41 catalyst, rather than analyzing its performance for PDH or ODH. No catalyst performance details related to PDH/ODH such as conversion, selectivity, stability, etc. are provided. Therefore, I have indicated that the document is not relevant.
