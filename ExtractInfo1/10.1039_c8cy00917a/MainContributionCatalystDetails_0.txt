The given document discusses the aromatization of isobutane over Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts, which is not directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) to propylene. While propane and propylene are briefly mentioned, the focus is on the conversion of isobutane to aromatic hydrocarbons, not specifically propylene. There is no discussion of improving propylene yield or selectivity through PDH or ODH processes.
