Isobutane aromatization over a complete Lewis acid Zn/HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst: performance and mechanism†
In short-chain alkane aromatization catalyzed by metal-modified HZSM-5, the metal cations acting as Lewis acid sites are considered to be the active centres for the dehydrogenation. However, other possible effects of the metal cations during the reaction have been neglected. In this study, a combination of experiments and DFT calculations has been carried out to investigate the complete effects of the Zn on ZSM-5 in isobutane aromatization. Zn8.47/HZSM-5 (Zn/Al > 1) with weak acidic properties was prepared as a Lewis acid sites-dominated catalyst. It was found that the (Zn–O–Zn)2+ Lewis acid sites acted as the main active sites and no bridged hydroxyl groups (Brønsted acid sites) were present. In isobutane conversion, it was surprisingly found that Zn8.47/HZSM-5 showed better catalytic performance at low temperature than HZSM-5 (Brønsted acid sites-dominated catalyst) and Zn2.34/HZSM-5 (Brønsted and Zn-Lewis acid sites co-existing catalyst). DFT calculations and operando dual-beam Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (DB-FTIR) characterization were employed to understand how the isobutane aromatization could be catalyzed on the Lewis acid site (Zn–O–Zn)2+ exclusively without the participation of bridged hydroxyl groups. It was directly observed over DB-FTIR that the Lewis acid-type Zn/HZSM-5 enjoyed a faster aromatization rate and higher stability than HZSM-5 under real aromatization conditions. This firstly testified that the complete reaction of isobutane aromatization could be exclusively catalyzed by (Zn–O–Zn)2+ Lewis acid sites without the participation of bridged hydroxyl groups. The [Zn-(OH)−]+ species could be produced in situ and acted as the Brønsted acid sites. Owing to the weak acidity of [Zn-(OH)−]+, the Lewis acid sites played a key role during the aromatization reactions via the carbanionic mechanism.
Introduction
As important starting materials, light aromatics benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX) are widely used in many chemical industries to manufacture plastics, synthetic fibres, resins, various-purpose rubbers, dyes, etc. Traditionally, BTX are mainly produced from reforming and thermal cracking of naphtha, but as the market demand has increased and due to the shortage of fuel oil, the production of aromatics from the traditional route cannot meet the increasing demand. In recent years, the large-scale extraction of shale gas has greatly lowered the price of light alkanes, creating an alternative way to produce aromatics. Therefore, the catalytic conversion of short-chain alkanes with low value to light aromatic hydrocarbons has attracted lots of attentions from both industrial and academic points of view.1–6 The HZSM-5 zeolite, which is classified as a medium-pore zeolite, is known as an efficient catalyst for the aromatization of light hydrocarbons.7–11 The initial dehydrogenation (activation) of light alkanes is reported to be the rate-limiting step for aromatization, which is mainly catalyzed by Brønsted acid sites. Owing to the strong acidity of Brønsted acid sites, C–C bond cracking is 1.5–2.0 times faster than C–H bond cracking,12 which brings down the overall selectivity of the aromatics. Moreover, the hydride-transfer reaction is catalyzed by Brønsted acid sites, resulting in a high selectivity of light alkane by-products. Thus, the addition of dehydrogenation metals is required to improve the selectivity of aromatization by suppressing the protolysis and hydride-transfer side-reactions. Zn-modified HZSM-5 zeolites are reported to be effective catalysts with a considerably improved selectivity of aromatics.13–16 The reaction mechanism of short-chain alkane aromatization over Zn/HZSM-5 is thought to be an extremely complicated procedure involving alkane activation and dehydrogenation, chemisorption of the alkene, oligomerization, hydride transfer, cracking, cyclization and dehydrogenative aromatization. Despite the complication of the full process of aromatization, even the mechanism of the initial activation of alkanes over Zn/HZSM-5 is still debatable, which really inhibits the development of ideal catalysts. As Ono et al. reported,17 the initial activation of propane is exclusively catalyzed by the zeolitic Brønsted acid sites (BASs), while the Zn-Lewis acid sites (LASs) are responsible for the olefin-to-aromatics conversion. While, several other groups found that Zn LASs were responsible for the initial activation of alkanes, Guisnet et al.18,19 proposed a totally different mechanism whereby Zn LASs play a crucial role in the initial propane dehydrogenation to propene, while the BASs catalyze the oligomerization and cyclization to higher hydrocarbons. Mole et al.20 and Ivanova et al.21–23 pointed out that Zn LASs could activate the dissociation of C–H bond of alkanes. Kazansky et al.24–26 proposed that the initial step on Zn2+ LASs proceeds through alkane dissociative adsorption, resulting in the formation of zinc alkyl and the rebirth of BASs. Moreover, a synergetic action of Zn LASs and BASs at the initial stages of propane activation has been proposed. Inui et al.,27 le van Mao et al.28 and Iglesia et al.29–32 pointed out that Zn2+ LASs catalyze the recombinative desorption of H atoms as H2 through the formation of the intermediate Zn–H species, while the initial C–H cleavage occurs on the BASs. Stepanov et al.33–35 suggested the synergetic role of both ZnO species and BASs in C–H bond activation and in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes.
Associated with previous studies, although the initial activation of short-chain alkanes over Zn/HZSM-5 is debatable, the aromatization of short-chain alkanes is widely accepted to occur via a bi-functional mechanism. The BASs in Zn/HZSM-5 are thought to play an indispensable role in the aromatization of light alkanes, even though they would trigger some side reactions, such as deactivation of the catalysts and the large generation of dry gas to reduce the selectivity of aromatics. While, for metal cations, besides the dehydrogenation of alkanes, little is known about their other functions in aromatization. Thus, it makes us wonder whether it is true that metal cations only take part in the dehydrogenation of alkanes in the whole process of aromatization. If not, what other parts of the process may metal cations participate in? Having a full view of metal cations participation in the aromatization process would improve the understanding of light alkane aromatization catalyzed by metal-modified HZSM-5, which is useful for the improvement of catalysts. Therefore, in order to figure out the complete effects of metal cations as Lewis acid sites in light alkane aromatization catalyzed by metal-modified HZSM-5, an associated study by experimentation and DFT calculations was carried out. Experimentally, a Zn/HZSM-5 (8.47 wt% Zn, Zn/Al > 1) catalyst with low acidic properties was prepared, in which oxygenated zinc clusters LASs acted as the main active sites and there was no absorption band for bridged hydroxyl groups observed by IR. Brønsted and Zn-Lewis acid sites co-existing in Zn2.34/HZSM-5 and Brønsted acid sites-dominated HZSM-5 catalysts were also prepared for comparison.
Taken isobutane as a probe reactant, it was surprisingly found that compared with HZSM-5 and Zn2.34/HZSM-5, the Zn8.47/HZSM-5 catalyst showed better activity and higher aromatics selectivity, and largely suppressed the hydride-transfer reaction at low temperature. It is interesting for us to know how isobutane aromatization happens on this Lewis acid-dominated catalyst. To answer this question, here, operando dual-beam Fourier transform infrared (DB-FTIR) spectrometry36 and DFT calculations were employed. We firstly observed over DB-FTIR that the Lewis-type Zn8.47/HZSM-5 enjoyed a faster aromatization rate and higher stability than HZSM-5 under real aromatization conditions. The DFT calculations results suggested that isobutane aromatization could be exclusively catalyzed on oxygenated zinc cluster LASs without the participation of bridged hydroxyl groups. The [Zn-(OH)−]+ species could be produced in situ and acted as the Brønsted acid sites. Owing to the weak acidity of [Zn-(OH)−]+, the Lewis acid sites played a key role during the aromatization reactions via the carbanionic mechanism.
Experimental
Materials
Nano-sized NaZSM-5 zeolite (20–50 nm) with a SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of 26 was manufactured by Dalian Ligong Qiwangda Chemical Technology (Dalian, China). The NaZSM-5 zeolite powder was extruded with Al2O3 powder at the weight ratio of 80/20. Then, the HZSM-5 extrusion was obtained by exchanging the NaZSM-5 extrusion twice at 80 °C with 1 M solution of NH4NO3 with a liquid-to-solid weight ratio of 5 for 1 h. The sample was filtered and washed with deionized water each time after exchange, and finally dried at 110 °C for 12 h and then calcined at 540 °C in flowing dry air for 6 h.
The Zn-modified samples were obtained with an incipient wet impregnation (IWI) method. The impregnation was conducted at 80 °C with HZSM-5 catalysts using the solutions of zinc nitrate. The real loadings of Zn in the modified samples were determined by ICP.
Characterization
The samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-visible, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), nitrogen physisorption and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained by a Rigaku D/max-2004 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 100 mA) at a 0.02° min−1 (2θ) scanning speed. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements were performed with a Bruker SRS3400 spectrometer to determine the bulk silicon-to-aluminium ratio. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were conducted with VG ESCALAB MK2 instrument using Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) in order to estimate the surface silicon-to-aluminium ratio. The voltage and power for the measurements were 12.5 kV and 250 W, respectively. The vacuum in the test chamber during the spectrum collection was maintained at 2 × 10−10 mbar. The binding energies were calibrated for the surface charge by referencing to the C1S peak of the contaminant carbon at 284.6 eV. NH3-TPD measurements were employed to investigate the overall acidity of the catalysts. Profiles were obtained with a Quantachrome ChemBet 3000 chemisorb instrument. The samples (150 mg, 380–830 μm sieve fraction) were pretreated in He (99 wt% purity, Dalian Special Gases CO. LTD) at 600 °C for 1 h and then cooled down to 100 °C for ammonia adsorption. The ammonia (99 wt% purity, Dalian Special Gases CO. LTD) adsorption was carried out at 100 °C for 30 min with a mixture of 5% NH3 in He. After adsorption, the cell was purged in 50 mL min−1 He flow for 30 min to remove all the non-chemically adsorbed NH3. Then the NH3-TPD profiles were recorded in a 50 mL min−1 He flow by ramping the temperature from 100 °C to 600 °C at a rate of about 16 °C min−1. Temperature-programmed reduction experiments were carried out using a Quantachrome ChemBet 3000 chemisorb instrument. The samples (150 mg, 380–830 μm sieve fraction) were placed in a quartz tube between two quartz wool plugs and introduced in to an oven. Prior to reduction, the sample was calcined at 450 °C (10 °C min−1) in 5% O2 in He for 1 h. Then, the sample was cooled down to room temperature in a N2 flow. The TPR measurements were performed in a flow of 5 vol% H2 in N2 under heating at a ramp of 10 °C min−1 until a temperature of 800 °C was reached.
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was also used to characterize the acidity of the samples. The spectra of the surface hydroxyl (OH) vibration and NH3 (99 wt% purity, Dalian Special Gases CO. LTD) adsorption were obtained with a Nicolet is10 FT-IR spectrometer. The zeolitic samples were pressed into a self-supporting thin wafer (approximately 15 mg) and decontaminated at 400 °C under vacuum (10−3 pa) for 4 h in a quartz IR cell equipped with CaF2 windows. After the pretreatment, the cell was cooled down to room temperature for the sample measurements. The spectrum was recorded from 4000 to 400 cm−1 with an optical resolution of 4 cm−1. The hydroxyl vibration spectra were obtained by subtracting the background spectrum (recorded with an empty IR cell in the absence of sample) from the measured sample spectra. The spectrum of NH3 was obtained as follows: first, NH3 adsorption was carried out at 150 °C in a continuous NH3 flow at the speed of 3 ml min−1 for 30 min. Then, evacuation treatment (10−3 pa) was conducted for 30 min at 300 °C. The spectra were obtained by subtracting the background spectrum (obtained with decontaminated wafers before NH3 adsorption) from the measured sample spectra.
Nitrogen physisorption was conducted on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument at −196 °C to obtain textural information. Prior to the measurement, the samples (380–830 μm sieve fraction) were degassed at 400 °C for 6 h. The surface area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method using the adsorption branch in the p/p0 range from 0.10 to 0.15, and the pore volumes were estimated at p/p0 of 0.99, while the micro- and mesoporosity were discriminated by the t-plot method.
The aromatization of propylene (99 wt% purity, Dalian Special Gases CO. LTD) over pristine and Zn-modified HZSM-5 catalysts was carried out over an operando DB-FTIR spectrometer.28 The catalysts were pressed into self-supporting thin wafers (1 cm2) that were placed in the sample beam, while the reference beam was vacant. The sample was activated in the IR reactor cell at 400 °C for 4 h under vacuum (10−3 Pa), and the spectra were recorded at a resolution of 4 cm−1 with 64 scans in the region of ṽ = 4000–1000 cm−1. The intensities of the reference and sample beams were adjusted to the same level. The effluent from the IR reactor cell was analyzed by a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Omnistar, 1–200 amu, QMS 200). The spectra of CO (99 wt% purity, Dalian Special Gases CO. LTD) were obtained as follows: first, CO adsorption was carried out at room temperature in a continuous CO flow at the speed of 3 ml min−1 for 30 min. Then, evacuation treatment (10−3 pa) was conducted for 30 min at room temperature. The spectra were obtained by subtracting the background spectrum (obtained with decontaminated wafers before CO adsorption) from the measured sample spectra.
Catalytic tests
A continuous flow fixed-bed reactor was used to evaluate the isobutane aromatization over both pristine and Zn-modified HZSM-5 catalysts. All the catalyst samples were crushed, and sieved into 20–40 mesh particles before they were loaded into the reactor. Here, 2.0 g catalyst was loaded in the middle part of a stainless steel reactor 600 mm in length and 10 mm in diameter and the temperature of the catalyst bed was monitored by a thermocouple. Before the test, the catalyst was kept at 540 °C for 1 h in a N2 flow to remove water. During the test, the isobutane feedstock was pumped into the reactor by a double plunger pump at the speed of 3 ml h−1 with a liquid weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 0.75 h−1. No dilutant was added during the test. The mass balance was obtained by weighing the gross weight of the feedstock, products and carbon deposits over the catalyst. Liquid products were collected in a cooling trap and analyzed by using a Shimadzu GC-14C gas chromatograph (OV-1 capillary column 50 m × 0.2 mm, FID detector), while the gas products were analyzed by using an online GC (Agilent 7890, OV-1 capillary column 50 m × 0.2 mm, FID detector).
DFT calculation
A 268 T cluster model, including the whole intersection of the straight and zigzag channels, was obtained by cutting the periodic structure, as shown in Fig. 1.37 The dangling silicon atoms were terminated by hydrogen along the bond direction of the next lattice oxygen atoms with the distance of 1.46 Å. To improve the energetic properties and take into account the effect of the entire zeolite framework on the reaction mechanism, a two-layer scheme ONIOM was employed. Based on the pioneering works published by van Santen et al.,38–43 two adjacent five-rings on the wall of the straight channel of the ZSM-5 zeolite have been suggested as a possible cationic site for the zinc ion with Al atoms placed in the T12 and T8 lattice positions. Therefore, these regions with an intimate relationship with catalytic reactions were treated with a high-level functional ωB97XD along with the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set for accuracy, which is a long-range corrected functional, while the regions away from the active centre were treated at a lower-level with the semi-empirical calculation method (AM1) for efficiency. In all the calculations, the positions of the terminal SiH3 atoms were fixed, whereas the positions of the remaining atoms and guest molecules were optimized. The transition state structures were characterized by means of frequency calculations with only one imaginary frequency. The intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) method was used when necessary to identify the two minima connected by a transition state.

Results and discussion
Characterization of the Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts
Two Zn-modified HZSM-5 catalysts with different Zn loadings were prepared. The Zn loadings of the catalysts were 2.34 and 8.47 wt%, respectively. The XRD patterns indicated that (Fig. 2(a)) all the catalysts (Znx/HZ) maintained the MFI structure. When the Zn loading was 8.47 wt%, the characteristic peaks at 2θ = 32°, 35° and 37° suggested the formation of ZnO clusters. The formation of ZnO clusters at a high Zn loading was further evidenced by the UV-vis absorption spectra. As shown in Fig. 2(b), a UV absorption band in between 350 and 400 nm appears, related to the absorption of ZnO clusters.44 This means that a small amount of bulky ZnO particles was formed on the zeolite. The Zn2.34/HZ mainly showed a strong UV absorption band between 250 and 350 nm. This band has been attributed to sub-nanometre ZnO clusters, i.e. Zn oligomers with a (Zn–O–Zn)2+ structure. Moreover, the weak adsorption between 350 and 370 nm could result from a small quantity of bulky ZnO particles. Table 1 shows that the BET specific area of the modified zeolite decreases with increasing the Zn loading. Roughly speaking, the decrease in the BET specific area can be mainly attributed to the decrease in specific area of micropores when the Zn loading is low, and the decrease in external surface area when the Zn loading is high. These results suggest that at low Zn loading, the Zn species mainly reside inside the micropores, while, at high Zn loading, the Zn species not only reside inside the micropores but also start to accumulate on the external surface of zeolite, resulting in the formation of bulky ZnO particles (Fig. 2).

Fig. 3(a) shows the DB-FTIR spectra of CO adsorption on the Zn-modified catalysts, which were employed to evaluate the Zn species. The parent HZSM-5 showed no adsorption bands after exposure to CO. After Zn modification, two clear adsorption bands at 2213 and 2221 cm−1 could be observed. These adsorption peaks are related to the Zn species. According to the literature,21 the band at 2221 cm−1 could be attributed to the CO complexes with the Zn oligomers with the (Zn–O–Zn)2+ structure, while the band at 2213 cm−1 could be attributed to the CO adsorption over Zn2+ cation. It could be clearly observed that the main Zn species over Zn8.47/HZ are (Zn–O–Zn)2+. Fig. 3(b) shows the XPS spectra of the Zn species-modified catalysts, which were employed to evaluate the Zn species. The Zn (2p3/2 and 2p1/2) spectra of Zn-containing HZSM-5 zeolites were compared with that of pure ZnO. The distinct variation of the XPS spectra in terms of the shape and position demonstrated the existence state of the surface zinc species. Pure ZnO (2p1/2) showed a peak at 1021.9 eV, while no peaks were observed for Zn2.34/HZSM-5, suggesting the absence of bulk ZnO species. For Zn8.47/HZSM-5, a peak at 1022.7 eV could be observed, and the shift of this peak for ZnO species to higher binding energy was possibly related to the effect of the zeolite framework on the ZnO species, as the framework has a much stronger electronegativity than the O2− group.45,46 TPR profiles for the pure ZnO reference sample, Zn2.34/HZSM-5 and Zn8.47/HZSM-5 are shown in Fig. 3(c). A reduction peak between 90 °C and 150 °C could be seen over Zn2.34/HZSM-5 and Zn8.47/HZSM-5. According to the literature,16 this peak could be attributed to the heterolytic dissociation of H2 over isolated Zn2+. Another reduction peak at a higher temperature between 600 °C and 800 °C could also be seen associated with the reduction of oxygenated Zn aggregates. Its position is close to that of bulk zinc oxide. The high-temperature reduction peak for Zn2.34/HZSM-5 and Zn8.47/HZSM-5 was more intense because of the much smaller size of the zinc oxide-like particles confined in the micropores of the ZSM-5 zeolite. Moreover, the intensity of the high-temperature reduction peak over Zn8.47/HZSM-5 was much higher than that of Zn2.34/HZSM-5, caused by the higher zinc oxide content.

Based on the above-mentioned results and literature reports,30–32 the most probable species from nitrate solution is (ZnOH)+, but this Zn species is not thermally stable. Upon heating, Zn/H-ZSM5 undergoes dehydration. At low Zn loadings (<1.30 wt%), (ZnOH)+ couples with a nearby OH group to form H2O, which desorbs, and a Zn2+ cation. At high Zn loadings, (ZnOH)+ may couple with another (ZnOH)+ to form H2O and a (Zn–O–Zn)2+ cation interacting with two Al sites and connected by a bridging oxygen. Further increasing the Zn content will lead to the formation of ZnO aggregates inside and outside the HZSM-5 zeolite. We calculated the size of ZnO aggregates and the ZSM-5 zeolite channel by DFT. As the results show in Table S1,† the n of (Zn–O–Zn)n2+ could be 1,3,5 and the largest number of (Zn–O–Zn)n2+ was 7. These (Zn–O–Zn)2+ species were stable and active. According to Iglesia et al.,30 the bulky ZnO crystallites over the surface of the HZSM-5 zeolite are inactive for butane conversion and could be easily reduced to Zn metal and vaporized during reaction. According to Dergachev et al.47 and Ivanova et al.,21 the content of large ZnO crystals determined from XRD in Zn/HZSM-5 amounted to 5% of the total amount of Zn introduced (0.42 wt% in the sample). Therefore, the contribution of large ZnO crystals in the transformation of isobutane over Zn8.47/HZSM-5 was negligible. We further performed H2 reduction experiments with Zn8.47/HZSM-5 at different temperatures and the results are shown in Fig. S1.† The bulky ZnO species were not stable and were reduced to Zn metal and vaporized in hydrogen atmosphere at temperature higher than 550 °C. Based on the previous discussion, due to the low Si/Al ratio and high Zn content (Zn/Al > 1), the main active sites of Zn8.47/HZSM-5 were zinc oxide aggregates inside the zeolite channel, while, the existence of (ZnOH)+ and Zn2+ could not be excluded. In order to make the calculation and discussion more intuitively, (Zn–O–Zn)2+ was chosen as the representative Zn species of Zn8.47/HZSM-5.
Fig. 4(a) shows the IR spectra of the hydroxyl groups on the Zn-modified HZSM-5 zeolites. Three adsorption bands could be identified from the spectra between 3500 and 3750 cm−1. It is well known that the 3610 cm−1 band is attributed to the bridging hydroxyl group (Si(OH)Al). The 3726 cm−1 band belonged to the free internal silanol (SiOH), and the 3740 cm−1 band could be associated with the isolated external silanol (SiOH). The acid strengths of these hydroxyl groups are as follows: bridge hydroxyl > free internal silanol > external silanol.48 Generally speaking, an increase in Zn loading led to a weakening of the bands at 3610 cm−1 and 3726 cm−1. This suggests that the density of Brønsted acids were reduced after the Zn modification. The IR spectra of NH3 adsorption on the Zn-modified catalysts were employed to evaluate the Brønsted and Lewis acid populations (Fig. 4(b)). The reason for using NH3 instead of pyridine to distinguish the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites is that the pore channels of HZSM-5 with the high Zn loadings (8.47 wt%) are too narrow for bulky pyridine molecules to access. In the selected wavenumber region, two clear adsorption bands were obtained from the NH3 adsorption IR spectra. Based on the literature,49 the 1460 cm−1 band was attributed to the Brønsted acid sites, while the 1617 cm−1 band was ascribed to Lewis acid sites. It is easily observed that the parent HZSM-5 has more Brønsted acid sites and less Lewis acid sites. When the Zn loading is 2.34 wt%, the increase in Zn loading results in a remarkable increase in Lewis acid sites at the expense of Brønsted acid sites. When the Zn loading is 8.47 wt%, the Brønsted acid sites vanish and the number of Lewis acid sites further increases. These results suggest that Zn preferentially occupied the acidic hydroxyl groups during modification. As a result, Brønsted acid sites were transformed to Lewis acid sites. As shown in Fig. 4(c), when the Zn loading was 2.34 wt%, the Zn modification apparently transformed the strong acid sites (corresponding to the high-temperature desorption peak) into weak ones (corresponding to the desorption at lower temperature). This was likely due to the replacement of the acidic hydroxyl groups (such as the strongly acidic bridge hydroxyls) by Zn, thus simultaneously the Brønsted acid sites are transformed into Lewis acid sites, which leads to a partial conversion of strong acid sites to weak ones. Based on the previous characterization results, HZSM-5 was denoted as a Brønsted acid catalyst, Zn2.34/HZSM-5 as a Brønsted–Lewis acid catalyst and Zn8.47/HZSM-5 as a Lewis acid catalyst.

Catalytic performance of HZSM-5 and Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts in isobutane aromatization
Isobutane as an important short-chain hydrocarbon feedstock was chosen as a probe to study the aromatization performance of HZSM-5, Zn2.34/HZSM-5 and Zn8.47/HZSM-5. All the samples exhibited good stability at different temperatures during the 72 h test (Fig. S2 and S3†) and the results at 24 h were chosen to compare. Fig. 5 shows that the Zn2.34/HZSM-5 and Zn8.47/HZSM-5 exhibit better activity and BTX selectivity in the aromatization of isobutane at different temperatures. The activity of isobutane at different temperatures follows the sequence of Zn8.47/HZSM-5 > Zn2.34/HZSM-5 > HZSM-5. At low temperature (400–430 °C), Zn8.47/HZSM-5 showed a higher aromatics selectivity while Zn2.34/HZSM-5 exhibited better performance at high temperature. This is obvious evidence that Zn is an effective modifier for HZSM-5 in preparing an aromatization catalyst and shows that the Zn species play a crucial role in the aromatization performance. At 400 °C, isobutane transformation over different catalysts obtained a similar activity at 5 wt%. As shown in Fig. 6, the selectivity of aromatics over Zn8.47/HZSM-5 was 2.5 times of that of Zn2.34/HZSM-5. Moreover, the selectivity of dry gas (methane, ethane) and alkanes (propane, butane) was much lower, suggesting that the protolysis of isobutane and hydride-transfer side-reactions are largely suppressed by Zn8.47/HZSM-5. Based on the previous results, isobutane could undergo aromatization reactions merely catalyzed by (Zn–O–Zn)2+ LASs over Zn8.47/HZSM-5. It is widely accepted that the aromatization reaction needs both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites and the Zn modification could largely improve the aromatization selectivity by the incorporation of a dehydrogenation active centre. However, as Fig. 4(a) shows, the Zn8.47/HZSM-5 contains few bridged hydroxyl groups, which are considered indispensable during the aromatization process. So, how could the aromatization reaction happen in the absence of Brønsted acid sites? There are two possible reasons: one is the regeneration of Brønsted acid sites during the isobutane conversion, the other is that the aromatization could be mono-catalyzed by the (Zn–O–Zn)2+ Lewis active centre. Operando DB-FTIR characterization and DFT calculations were made to further certificate the overall process of isobutane aromatization merely over the (Zn–O–Zn)2+ of Zn8.47/HZSM-5.

Operando DB-FTIR in the characterization of isobutane and propene aromatization over HZSM-5 and Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts
Isobutane aromatization over HZSM-5 and Zn/HZSM-5 was studied by operando DB-FTIR spectrometry under real reaction conditions (150–450 °C, 101.33 kPa and 1080 h−1) to decouple the relationship between the active sites and the aromatization performance. The influence of the reaction temperature on isobutane aromatization over these catalysts is shown in Fig. S4.† One thing worth mentioning is that the initial temperature needed for the aromatization of isobutane over Zn8.47/HZSM-5 was lower than for the other two catalysts. As shown in Fig. 7, in the isobutane reaction at 150 °C, three bands can be observed at 2966, 2916 and 2848 cm−1 over HZSM-5 and Zn2.34/HZSM-5. For Zn8.47/HZSM-5, four additional bands can be observed at 2978, 2952, 2982 and 2979 cm−1. Increasing the reaction temperature to 200 °C, these four bands could also be seen over the HZSM-5 and Zn2.34/HZSM-5. These bands could possibly be attributed to the intermediates during isobutane aromatization. Moreover, further increasing the temperature to 450 °C, these bands could be seen over Zn2.34/HZSM-5 and Zn8.47/HZSM-5. The above-mentioned results suggested that the Lewis acid Zn8.47/HZSM-5 could catalyze the initial activation of isobutane at lower temperature than the Brønsted acid HZSM-5 and Brønsted–Lewis acid Zn2.34/HZSM-5 catalysts.

Propene, as an important intermediate of isobutane aromatization over HZSM-5 and Zn/HZSM-5, was further chosen to decouple the relationship between the active sites and the aromatization performance. Operando DB-FTIR spectrometry was further applied to study propene aromatization over HZSM-5 and Zn/HZSM-5 catalysts under real reaction conditions (250 °C, 101.33 kPa and 1080 h−1) and the products were analyzed by mass spectroscopy. The overall three-dimensional FTIR profiles of propene aromatization on these catalysts in 60 min are shown in Fig. S5.† Propene underwent rapid reactions over these catalysts in the first 15 min and then reached a relatively constant level. One thing worth mentioning is that the reaction of propene over Zn8.47/HZSM-5 was faster than for the other two catalysts. In order to get more detailed information, the spectra collected in the first 15 min were selected and are displayed in Fig. 8. For HZSM-5 (Fig. 8a), the absorbance at 3610 cm−1 attributed to Si(OH)Al hydroxyl groups (Brønsted acid sites) decreased with the reaction time. As the reaction went to 6.35 min, the absorbance at 3610 cm−1 disappeared. While the intensity of the bands between 2850 and 2960 cm−1 attributed C–H bond stretching vibrations obviously increased, suggesting that the Brønsted acid sites took part in the activation of propene. According to the literature,50 the CC bond of propene possibly goes through an addition with H+ Brønsted acid sites to form allylic carbocation. Prolonging the reaction time, in the 3000–3100 cm−1 region, three bands were observed at 3078, 3091 and 3103 cm−1. These bands are ascribed to the C–H stretching vibration of an aromatic ring.51 The adsorption bands appearing in the C–H stretching region (2800–3000 cm−1) are much stronger than the bands observed between 3000 and 3100 cm−1. There are three major absorption bands in the C–H bending region (1400–1600 cm−1). Among these, the band at 1506 cm−1 is related to the aromatic ring.51 These spectra suggest that propene aromatization over the H+ acid sites of HZSM-5 occurred. The products were analyzed by mass spectrometry, as shown in Fig. 9, and showed that propene underwent a fast reaction in the first 5 min and then reached saturation point. The benzene formation started right after the saturated adsorption of propene. The formation rate of benzene increased with the reaction time in the first 15 min and then decreased with further elongation of the reaction time. These results suggest that the stability of propene aromatization over H+ Brønsted acid sites was poor, and the fast-formation of coke due to H+-catalyzed polymerization might be the reason.

A similar trend was observed in propene aromatization over Zn2.34/HZSM-5 in the DB-FTIR spectra, suggesting the participation of H+ Brønsted acid sites. However, as shown in Fig. 9, Zn2.34/HZSM-5 exhibited a higher stability than HZSM-5, indicating that the synergy of H+ Brønsted acid sites and Zn-Lewis acid sites could improve the aromatization stability. Interestingly, the aromatization performance of Zn8.47/HZSM-5 exhibited different trends from the other two catalysts. None of H+ Brønsted acid sites was observed over Zn8.47/HZSM-5, but the initial propene reaction happened at 1.27 min (Fig. 8). Since the initial propene reaction over HZSM-5 and Zn2.34/HZSM-5 started at 6.35 min, we could say that Zn8.47/HZSM-5 could accelerate the propene reaction. Moreover, the first aromatics appeared at 5.08 min over Zn8.47/HZSM-5, while they appeared at 11.43 min for the other catalysts. Associated with the mass spectra (Fig. 9), the stability of propene aromatization over Zn8.47/HZSM-5 was higher than over HZSM-5. The above-mentioned results further testify that isobutane and propene aromatization could be catalyzed by the Lewis acid-type Zn8.47/HZSM-5 catalyst, which exhibited a faster speed and better stability than the Brønsted acid-type HZSM-5 catalyst. Associated with the isobutane aromatization results, the higher activity and aromatics selectivity of the Lewis acid-type Zn8.47/HZSM-5 catalyst at low temperature could be attributed to the improved initial activation of the isobutane reactant and propene intermediate.
Calculation results
To understand the mechanism of isobutane conversion on (Zn–O–Zn)2+ active centres of Zn/HZSM5, theoretical calculations were adopted. The optimized structures for all the reactants, reaction intermediates and transition states are shown in Fig. S6 and S7.†
The dissociation adsorption of isobutane on (Zn–O–Zn)2+
Scheme 1 shows the potential energy surface and reaction paths for the initial activation of isobutane conversion on (Zn–O–Zn)2+ active site located at two adjacent (SiOAl) sites of the zeolite framework. After the physical adsorption of isobutane, two possible paths for C–H bond dissociative adsorption were considered: (1) isobutane dissociation between the (Zn–O–Zn)2+ site and framework (SiOAl)− to generate [(Zn–O–Zn)2+–(C4H9)−]+ and Si(OH)Al Brønsted acid sites with a higher active energy (>38.14 kcal mol−1, the transition state could not be found); (2). isobutane dissociation on the (Zn–O–Zn)2+ site to generate [Zn-(OH)−]+ and a Zn-alkyl fragment [Zn-(C4H9)−]+ with an energy barrier of 21.26 kcal mol−1. As we can see, the initial activation of isobutane (C–H bond cleavage) could be selectively activated by (Zn–O–Zn)2+ sites from the viewpoint of the thermodynamics and kinetics.
Scheme 1 Isobutane dissociative adsorption over the (Zn–O–Zn)2+ active centre.
After the initial activation of isobutane, [Zn-(OH)−]+ was produced. To understand the acidity of [Zn-(OH)−]+, a comparison study using different hydroxyl groups with NH3 as the probe molecule was performed. As shown in Fig. 10, the adsorption energy of [Zn-(OH)−]+ was much higher than for the terminal SiOH of the zeolite, and slightly higher than that of [Zn-(OH)−]+ in zinc oxide, but obviously lower than that of the bridged hydroxyl groups Si(OH)Al. It is well known that the terminal SiOH of zeolite has no acidity, while zinc oxide is amphoteric and Si(OH)Al is a strong Brøstend acid site in the zeolite. Therefore, it can be concluded that [Zn-(OH)−]+ generated during the reactions possesses a weak Brønsted acidity, which could possibly catalyze the oligomerization, cyclization and hydride-transfer reactions.

The primary reaction of isobutane conversion on (Zn–O–Zn)2+
For the dissociative adsorption of isobutane over the (Zn–O–Zn)2+ site, there are two kinds of C–H bond cleavage: central or terminal C with H. The latter is favourable from the viewpoint of the thermodynamics and dynamics. For the Zn-alkyl fragment [Zn-(C4H9)−]+, there are two different reaction paths that are possible: (1) dehydrogenation activation, which abstracts H from (C4H9)− to generate isobutene and [Zn–H−]+, then [Zn–H−]+ reacts with the nearby [Zn-(OH)−]+ to generate H2 and recover the active sites of zeolite (Scheme 2a). This process is labelled in red in Fig. 11; (2) demethylation activation, which abstracts CH3 from (C4H9)− to produce propylene and [Zn-(CH3)]+, then [Zn-(CH3)−]+ reacts with the nearby [Zn-(OH)−]+ to generate CH4 and recover the zeolite (Scheme 2b). As we can see from the potential energy surface, the dehydrogenation reaction is dynamically favourable. The rate-limiting step is the desorption of H2 with a 45.49 kcal mol−1 energy barrier. However, the demethylation reaction is thermodynamically favourable. The rate-limiting step is the desorption of C3H6 from (C4H9)− with a 57.83 kcal mol−1 energy barrier. Olefins intermediates (isobutene and propylene) are the main products in the primary reaction of isobutane conversion.

The secondary reaction of isobutane conversion on (Zn–O–Zn)2+
Based on previous calculations, propylene is an important intermediate generated by the initial activation of isobutane. Therefore, in the secondary reaction, we took propylene as a reactant to study the following mechanism. As shown in Fig. 12, after the physical adsorption of propylene on the active site of zeolite, a dissociative adsorption without an energy barrier results in the formation of an hydroxyl group (Zn–OH) and Zn-alkyl fragment [Zn-(C3H5)−]+. Then, there are two possible reaction paths (detailed reaction mechanism are shown in Schemes S1–S3†): (1) the carbocation mechanism, in which the second propylene molecule (central or terminal C=) reacts with H+ of [Zn-(OH)−]+ to form [Zn–O(CH2CH2CH3)+]+ carbocation with an energy barrier 35.66 kcal mol−1 or [Zn–O(CH(CH3)2)+]+ carbocation with an energy barrier of 29.88 kcal mol−1. To simplify the calculation, we took [Zn–O(CH2CH2CH3)+]+ carbocation as an example for the subsequent reaction. The [Zn–O(CH2CH2CH3)+]+ carbocation oligomerizes with a nearby [Zn-(C3H5)−]+ carbanion to give n-hexene with an energy barrier of 36.81 kcal mol−1 and recovery of the zeolite. Then, n-hexene could be continuously catalyzed on (Zn–O–Zn)2+ through C–H cleavage (energy barrier 1.10 kcal mol−1) and cyclization with the participation of the adjacent [Zn-(OH)−]+ to produce cyclohexane, which needs to overcome a 23.48 kcal mol−1 energy barrier. This process is labelled in black in Fig. 12; (2) the carbanion mechanism, in which the olefin intermediate reacts with (C3H5)− of [Zn-(C3H5)−]+ to give the [Zn-( )−]+ carbanion with an energy barrier of 20.12 kcal mol−1. Under the assistance of the nearby [Zn-(OH)−]+, the [Zn-( )−]+ carbanion was cyclized to generate a methyl cyclopentane and to simultaneously recover the active site of zeolite, which needs to overcome a 39.61 kcal mol−1 energy barrier. Then the produced methyl cyclopentane could also be continuously catalyzed on (Zn–O–Zn)2+ through C–H cleavage and ring expansion to get cyclohexane. This process is labelled in red in Fig. 12. Finally, the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene should be prone to occur with relatively lower energy barriers; however, this was not studied in this paper. To sum up, for olefin intermediates to aromatics through the carbocation or carbanion mechanism, the rate-limiting step is the oligomerization of [Zn–O(CH2CH2CH3)+]+ and [Zn-(C3H5)−]+ to n-hexene with an energy barrier of 36.81 kcal mol−1, and the cyclization of [Zn-( )−]+ with the assistance of [Zn-(OH)−]+ to methyl cyclopentane with an energy barrier of 39.61 kcal mol−1, respectively. Compared with the energy barriers of the rate-limiting step in the primary reaction (45–57 kcal mol−1), the energy barriers of the rate-limiting steps in the olefin intermediates to aromatics are both less than 40 kcal mol−1. Therefore, we thought that the carbocation and carbanion mechanism for the olefin intermediates to aromatics are both possible. Moreover, owing to the participation in oligomerization and the cyclization of olefin intermediates to aromatics, the weak Brøstend acidity of [Zn-(OH)−]+ was further proofed.

Based on all the calculated results, it was found that isobutane aromatization could be exclusively catalyzed on Lewis acid sites (Zn-O-Zn)2+. The primary reaction of isobutane over (Zn–O–Zn)2+ could undergo two paths: (1) demethylation to propylene and methane (thermodynamically favourable); (2) dehydrogenation to isobutene and hydrogen (dynamically favourable). Olefin intermediates generated by isobutane activation could undergo oligomerization and cyclization over the (Zn–O–Zn)2+ site through carbanion and carbocation mechanisms, owing to the synergic role of Lewis–Brønsted acid sites. Owing to the weak Brønsted acidity of [Zn-(OH)−]+ produced during the reactions, the Lewis acid sites play a relatively important role, characterizing the carbanion mechanism. For all the reactions of isobutane aromatization, the production of olefins intermediates is the rate-determining step.
Conclusions
The (Zn–O–Zn)2+ active sites-dominated Zn8.47/HZSM-5 catalyst was successfully prepared by a wet impregnation method. The Zn8.47/HZSM-5 catalyst showed superior performance at low temperature. Experimental results testified that the aromatization of isobutane could be merely catalyzed by the (Zn–O–Zn)2+ Lewis acid sites over Zn/HZSM-5. We first observed that the Lewis-type Zn/HZSM-5 catalyst enjoyed a faster formation rate of aromatics and a higher stability than the HZSM-5 catalyst under real aromatization conditions by operando DB-FTIR spectrometry. Associated with DFT calculations, it was found that after the dissociation adsorption of isobutane over (Zn–O–Zn)2+, [Zn-(C4H9)]+ and [Zn-(OH)−]+ was formed. Then, the [Zn-(C4H9)−]+ could go through C–C bond cracking to produce methane and propylene (thermodynamically favourable) or C–H bond cracking to produce hydrogen and isobutene (dynamically favourable). Subsequently, the oligomerization and cyclization of olefin intermediates to aromatics could still exclusively occur over (Zn–O–Zn)2+ sites. There are two possible paths (C3H6 chosen as the intermediate): after the initial activation of the first propylene, where [Zn-(C3H5)−]+ and [Zn-(OH)−]+ were formed. Then, (1) the carbocation mechanism occurs, in which the second propylene molecule reacts with H+ of [Zn-(OH)−]+ to generate [Zn-O(CH2CH2CH3)+]+ carbocation. [Zn–O(CH2CH2CH3)+]+ carbocation oligomerizes with a nearby [Zn-(C3H5)−]+ carbanion to n-hexene. Then n-hexene could be continuously catalyzed on (Zn–O–Zn)2+ through C–H cleavage and cyclization with the assistance of adjacent [Zn-(OH)−]+ to produce cyclohexane; (2) the carbanion mechanism occurs, in which the olefin intermediate reacts with (C3H5)− of [Zn-(C3H5)−]+ to form the [Zn-( )−]+ carbanion. Under the assistance of the nearby [Zn-(OH)−]+, the [Zn-( )−]+ carbanion was cyclized to generate methyl cyclopentane and could simultaneously recover the active site of zeolite. Then the produced methyl cyclopentane could also be continuously catalyzed on (Zn–O–Zn)2+ through C–H cleavage and ring expansion to get cyclohexane. Therefore, it was first found that isobutane aromatization could be merely catalyzed by the (Zn–O–Zn)2+ Lewis acid sites over Zn8.47/HZSM-5 characterizing the carbanion mechanism.
