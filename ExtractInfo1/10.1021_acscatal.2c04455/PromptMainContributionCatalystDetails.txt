Adsorption-Enhanced Bifunctional Catalysts for In Situ CO2 Capture and Utilization in Propylene Production: A Proof-Of-Concept Study

Abstract
In this study, cooperative bifunctional materials (BFMs)─composed of combined adsorbent and catalyst materials─are synthesized and processed through additive manufacturing by 3D printing adsorbent/catalyst monoliths with a CaO adsorbent phase balanced against an M@ZSM-5 (M = In, Ce, Cr, or Mo oxide) heterogeneous catalyst phase. The adsorbent/catalyst monoliths were characterized using NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, N2 physisorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, pyridine-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, C3H8-diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy. Their performances were evaluated for combined CO2 capture and propane dehydrogenation at 600–700 °C. These experiments revealed that a reaction temperature of 600 °C generates the best performance for all samples due to the shift toward thermal cracking at higher temperatures. Moreover, 600 °C was usable for both CO2 adsorption and catalysis, so the materials reported here could truly perform both adsorption and catalysis isothermally. Of the materials, CaO-Mo@ZSM-5 displayed the best performance, generating 20.4% propylene yield, 20% propane conversion, 75% CO2 conversion, and 5.4 mmol/g CO2 capture capacity at 600 °C. The stability of this sample was then assessed across ten adsorption/reaction cycles at T = 600 °C, where its propane conversion, CO2 conversion, and propylene yield varied by less than 5% across the entirety of the experiment. Overall, this work accomplishes three key goals: it (i) expands the concept of BFM materials to a previously unexplored reaction for direct CO2 capture from air (direct air capture) or flue gas, and subsequent utilization, (ii) provides a facile way of structuring BFM materials into practical contactors, and (iii) allows adsorption and catalysis to occur at the same temperature with high cyclic stability within a single bed.

1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
It is undeniable that atmospheric CO2 emissions are directly contributing to climate change, so many technologies have been developed to curtail this greenhouse gas. (1,2) One way of capturing CO2 has been with adsorption technology because this process incurs low energy costs, minimal waste output, and exceptional long-term stability; (3−5) however, the key issue of managing the stored CO2 has been questioned with regard to long-term viability of this strategy. The reason being that captured CO2 emissions are often adsorbed onto a group-II metal oxide to form solid-state metal carbonates and buried underground or captured using aqueous amine scrubbers; however, these technologies constantly consume energy and resources without providing significant capital return on investment, so they draw criticism in the industrial sector. (6) Of course, one could recycle the CaCO3 by reheating the material to form CaO, but this approach returns the gas back to its greenhouse state and incurs additional emissions in the form of the energy required to reactivate the adsorbent. (6) Therefore, alternative strategies for CO2 management are actively being considered.
Finding new strategies of curtailing atmospheric CO2 emissions has been an important area of research in recent years; however, the question of how best to dispose of the said emissions remains. One approach is to utilize CO2 as a feedstock in dehydrogenation reactions; however, adsorption/catalysis processes are typically performed in separate beds, which necessitates large thermal gradients and generates high-energy-costs. For examples, researchers have reported the use of CO2 as a light oxidant feedstock in dehydrogenation reactions─such as oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) or oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP)─where the gas both (i) reoxidizes spent active sites and (ii) is converted into CO, which is a precursor for synthetic fuels. (7−10) Granted, using CO2 as a synthetic fuel would still end with it being emitted into the atmosphere, but recent advancements in direct air capture (DAC) technology could eventually allow for atmospheric capture followed by subsequent CO2 utilization as a feedstock. By powering this process with renewable or nuclear energy, a circular carbon economy can then be achieved with this approach. As might be imagined, this circular economy is industrially attractive since it would enable a profitable means of curbing CO2 emissions that does not incur the ever wasteful material consumption expenditures of long-term storage solutions. Nevertheless, one issue with utilizing CO2 in this manner is that the adsorption and catalysis steps are typically performed over separate beds due to the large thermal gradient which occurs between the two processes. From a processing standpoint, separating these processes is problematic because the heating and cooling of two-stage adsorption/catalysis systems necessitates two large thermal gradients, leading to long cycle times (i.e., low productivity) and high energy costs. (10−12) As such, there have been considerable attempts to develop combined single-bed adsorption/catalysis processes in recent years in efforts of addressing these issues.
To this end, there have been several recent reports of the so-called “cooperative-bifunctional materials” (BFMs) which contain both (i) an active high-temperature CO2 adsorbent (i.e., CaO, K-Ca, etc.) and (ii) a heterogeneous catalyst (e.g., metal oxide/ZSM-5 or metal oxide/Al2O3 composites) that can both adsorb and react with CO2 at high temperature. (13−15) For example, we reported in our previous work K-Ca/ZSM-5 (Cr) BFM composite powder for singular bed CO2 adsorption and utilization in ODHE reaction, (10) whereas Jeong-Potter and Farrauto (14,15) recently reported CaO/Al2O3 BFMs with various metal dopants for methane reforming. However, either of these processes have still required thermal gradients between the adsorption and reaction steps, which limits their suitability for industrial applications, also, have failed to form these BFMs into practical contactors. Thus, the ttechnologies demonstrated therein are still limited from an industrial point-of-view.
Furthermore, although these materials both showed reasonably high performances for their respective reactions, it is worth noting here that there is a large oversight present in the state of BFM adsorbent/catalyst materials which must be addressed. Namely, active materials─either adsorbents or catalysts─must be converted into practical contactors prior to scale-up to prevent scattering, enhance mass transfer, and reduce systemic pressure losses. (7) Regarding BFM composites, this aspect of scale-up is particularly difficult because the conventional pathways for structurization─including granulation, pelletization, and extrusion─use water as a means of ensuring intraparticle binding, which inevitably alters the phase distribution of the BFM materials and influences the adsorptive/catalytic properties in unpredictable ways. This is especially true when considering the often used CaO component of BFMs, which would transition to Ca(OH)2 in the presence of water and could corrode the other phases due to its highly basic chemistry, thereby lowering the catalytic activity. Therefore, a novel method should be employed for the sake of generating the first-ever structured BFM materials.
To this end, we theorized that our recently reported direct metal oxide printing method, whereby insoluble commercial metal oxides, ZSM-5, and bentonite clay are formed into a self-standing ink, could be applied to formulate BFM composites. (8,9,16,17) In particular, we speculated that the adsorbent phase could be introduced into the ink by 3D-printing CaCO3 and then using calcination to convert the carbonate into CaO. Thus, this technique should be capable of generating the first-ever structured BFM materials. Having said this, another area which is currently underdeveloped in the area of BFM materials for CO2 capture and utilization processes is the extent to which such composites have been employed for different reactions, as there have only been a handful of applications in this area. We anticipated that the printed BFM monoliths could be reasonably applied to singular-bed CO2 capture and ODHP utilization, as our previous studies indicated that directly 3D-printed heterogeneous catalyst monoliths without the adsorbent phase have exceptional performance in this reaction. (8,9) Nevertheless, because combined CO2 capture and ODHP reaction would likely require higher temperature compared to ODHP, alone, we concluded that a metal screening would be needed to identify which BFM composites would be best suited for this process, as the best material for ODHP at 550 °C─which was reported previously─is unlikely to display the best performance at 600–700 °C.
Motivated by the possibility of expanding BFMs to previously unexplored reactions and by the need to develop the first generation of structured BFM materials, we embarked on a proof-of-concept metal screening study which formulates CaO-M@ZSM-5 (M = In2O3, CeO2, MoO3, or Cr2O3) into monolithic contactors by the direct metal oxide 3D printing technique. Here, it should be noted that these metal oxides were chosen because of their high catalytic acidities and previous application to oxidative dehydrogenation processes. (10−15) To garner a full understanding of the monolith physiochemical properties, a myriad of characterizations were performed, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), N2 physisorption, H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), elemental mapping, pyridine-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Py-FTIR), and C3H8-diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (C3H8-DRIFTS). The performances of the monoliths for combined CO2 capture and ODHP utilization were then assessed in a single packed bed at 600 °C, where the best performance was observed in the MoO3-doped sample which generated 20.4% propylene yield with ∼75% CO2 conversion. Overall, this study further advances the area of BFM materials by expanding singular-bed adsorption/catalysis to a new reaction and is used to manufacture the first generation of structured BFM contactors. Hence, this study should be considered an important advancement in the areas of materials science, CO2 utilization, and bifunctional adsorption/catalysis.

2.1. Materials
H-ZSM-5 (Al/Si = 30) was purchased from Zeolyst International. The following materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich for the formulation and characterization of our adsorbent/catalyst monoliths: pyridine (ACS), CaCO3 (99%), CeO2 (99.9+%), Cr2O3 (99%), MoO3 (99.5%), In2O3 (99.99%), bentonite clay, and methylcellulose (99%). All UHP gases were purchased from Airgas.
2.2. Monolith Formulation
The monoliths were 3D-printed using our established direct printing technique with the ink ratios outlined in Table 1. (8,9,16,17) It should be noted here that the CaCO3 concentration before printing was greater than 50 wt %; however, after calcining the printed structures and removing CO2 from CaO, the ratio of the adsorbent to the catalyst was 1:1. Before printing, the powder components were placed in a PTFE bottle and mixed with ∼10 mL of DI water, after which they were rolled at 60 rpm for 2 day at 25 °C. The inks were then densified at 60 °C to extract the solvent and produce appropriate rheological behavior, which has been defined for ceramic inks as (i) self-standing, (ii) good solvent retention, and (iii) shear-thinning rheology. (7) After printing, the monoliths were dried for 12 h in the fume hood at 25 °C to prevent structural cracking, whereafter they were heated in air at 10 °C/min to 550 °C for 6 h to burn out the methylcellulose, transition the CaCO3 into CaO, and generate structural strength.

2.3. BFM Monolith Characterization
The textural properties were analyzed by N2 physisorption at 77 K on a Micromeritics (3Flex) gas analyzer, and the samples were degassed at 350 °C for 6 h on a SmartVac Prep system before analysis to remove any contaminants. After analysis, the surface area and pore size distribution were calculated with the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) and nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) methods, respectively. A PANalytical X’Pert multipurpose X-ray diffractometer with a scan step size of 0.02°/step at a rate of 137.2 s/step from 5 ≤ 2θ ≤ 5° was used to assess the monolith crystallinities with XRD. A combination of backscattering microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was performed on a Quanta 600F ESEM with a Bruker Quantax EDS to map the dispersion of the oxide phases. It should be noted here that the coking amount on the catalysts could not be quantified by conventional techniques, as the CaO phase is susceptible to CO2 adsorption after removal from the reaction chamber. Hence, the carbonate formation cannot be distinguished from that which occurs from sample contamination, meaning that a new characterization technique to quantify the coking on aged BFMs is required. This is considered to be outside of the scope of this work because such a technique requires method development and validation, whereas this study is solely focused on demonstrating a proof-of-concept material screening. A means of quantifying the coke formation on aged BFMs is thus to be targeted in subsequent studies.
2.4. Assessment of Redox Properties and Catalytic Acidities
The redox properties of the samples─which influence the degree to which the BFMs could be reduced on-stream─were analyzed by temperature-programmed reduction in H2 (H2-TPR), whereas the acidities─which drive the hydrogen removal from propane─were assessed with temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD). The CO2 bond strengths on the BFMs were assessed via temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD). All of these analyses were performed on the Micromeritics 3Flex instrument, and the various conditions can be found in our earlier studies. (18,19) The orbital structures of the metal dopants were characterized by XPS on a Thermoscientific Nexsa 128 channel XPS system using a scan voltage step of 0.1 eV as a supplement to H2-TPR. The scan conditions for each metal are summarized in Table 2. Finally, as a supplement for NH3-TPD, the type of acid sites present in the BFM composites was characterized by pyridine-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Py-FTIR) on a Nicolet iS50 FTIR equipped with an attenuated total reflectance (ATR) diamond. Before characterization, the samples were degassed for 12 h under vacuum at 200 °C to ward off any preadsorbed species. Then, the samples were sealed in glass jars with 10 mL of liquid pyridine and heated to 50 °C for 12 h to saturate the acid sites with pyridine vapor.

2.5. C3H8-DRIFTS
The reactivity behavior of each BFM adsorbent/catalyst monolith was assessed as a function of temperature from 100 to 500 °C in the presence and absence of CO2 using diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). It should be noted here that the DRIFTS experiments were only performed up to 500 °C because there was light interference above this temperature, leading to data which were no longer reliable. Although this temperature was lower than that which was used in the adsorption/reaction experiments, differences in behavior of the various BFMs were still observed, which could provide subsequent insights into their performances at-temperature. The experimental setup consisted of a Nicolet iS-10 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) coupled with a catalytic reaction cell (Harrick Scientific, Pleasantville, NY, USA), and the experimental setup used for C3H8-DRIFTS is shown in Figure 1. Before analysis, the samples were first crushed and ground into a fine powder. Each catalyst was heated in 120 mL/min of helium (UHP, Airgas) to 500 °C and held at that temperature for 15 min prior to treatment in a mixture of 21%O2/79%N2 (UHP, Airgas) at 50 mL/min. Thereafter, helium was once again flowed, and scans in helium were taken at 500, 300, and 50 °C in order to obtain a suitable background spectrum. Next, either a mixture of 5%C3H8/95%N2 or 5%C3H8/5%CO2/90%N2 was flown at 100 mL/min, and scans were taken at 100, 200, 300, 400, 450, and 500 °C.

2.6. Combined Adsorption/Catalysis Experiments
The combined adsorption/catalysis performances of the samples were assessed using our in-house setup which has been reported previously. (8,9) A sample weight of 0.2 g was packed into the reactor bed with quartz wool. The monolith dimensions are shown in Figure 2. It should be noted that the printed structure had a cell density of ∼200 cells per square inch, which is lower than that of typical extrudates. However, a lower cell density is preferential for printing because the geometric repeatability across samples is less sensitive to rheological constraints, meaning that one can more simply isolate the effects of the material composition on catalytic performance. Once the best material is known, then the said material can be printed into different geometric structures. Hence, only a cell density of 200 cells per square inch was considered in this study, but in subsequent studies, the geometric properties of the BFMs will be varied to further improve their performance. A similar method to that which we reported previously for combined CO2 capture and ethane dehydrogenation over dual-salt/ZSM-5 (Cr) catalysts was used here to assess the CO2 capture/ODHP performances of the samples in this study. (10) First, the bed was heated at 10 °C/min to 700 °C under 20 mL/min of Ar for 1 h to desorb CO2 and activate the CaO adsorbent. Next, the bed was cooled to 600 °C while keeping under Ar, where 20 mL/min of 10% CO2/Ar was allowed to flow into the system for 1 h to saturate the adsorbent phase upon reaching the target temperature. Then, the system was heated at 10 °C/min to the desired reaction temperature (600, 650, or 700 °C) while maintaining the flow of CO2. Once reaching the desired temperature, the flow of CO2 was terminated and 20 mL/min of 5% C3H8/Ar was flowed into the reactor. It should be noted here that CO2 was generally not observed in the reaction streams after terminating its flow because its presence was only due to its release from the adsorbent phase, so it was too low to be detected compared to the other species.

Here, it should also be noted that the adsorption and catalysis steps were performed separately because the adsorption step was held constant at 600 °C in effort of eliminating too many experimental variables since the work in this study was already quite extensive with regard to the materials science. In subsequent studies, we will systematically vary the adsorption temperature and co-feed the adsorbent and reactant streams to determine the effects of performing both processes simultaneously. It should further be noted that a control experiment using these same conditions was performed on a ground CaO-Mo@ZSM-5 powder catalyst to demonstrate benefits in performance from structuring the material into a honeycomb monolith. It should finally be noted that the abovementioned process was repeated across 10 cycles for the CaO-Mo@ZSM-5 honeycomb monolith─the best performing catalyst─to demonstrate its cyclic stability. A 10 cycle assessment was considered to be appropriate because the performance of the catalyst was observed as stable after the fifth cycle, with variations in performance heuristics for subsequent cycles being less than 5% and showing no discernible systematic losses. The cyclic experiments were performed under fully isothermal conditions using a reaction and adsorption temperature of 600 °C. The concentration profiles of the species were collected with an MKS Cirrus II mass spectrometer throughout the entirety of all experiments. The MKS mass spectrometer is capable of decoupling overlapping atomic mass signals for the products via its interface and accompanying Process Eye Professional software. To avoid overlapping signals due to similar atomic masses of some gases, all the files used in the calibration were checked, and whenever overlapping peaks are available between gases, the matching peaks were removed. In other words, the main peaks (e.g., one or two peaks) of each gas which did not match with the peaks of the other gases were the only ones used for each species.
It should be further clarified that a carbon balance was not used in our calculations, since the presence of CaO could lead to some degree of CO2 retention during activation and/or after the adsorption step, which could propagate systematically to high error in the carbon number. For this reason, eqs 1–4 were used to calculate the various reactant conversions, product selectivities, and propylene yields as has been conventionally performed with BFM composites, where i represents the hydrocarbon product in the effluent gas, ni is the number of carbon atoms of component i, and Fi is the corresponding molar flow rate. In a similar fashion, the CO2 adsorption capacities of the different samples were assessed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on a Q500 thermogravimetric gas analyzer from TA Instruments to ensure more complete activation of the materials and to garner the true CO2 capacities at saturation. Herein, the samples were heated at 10 °C/min to 750 °C under 40 mL/min of N2 to remove CO2 from the CaO phase. After 1 h, the system was cooled to 600 °C, and 60 mL/min of 10% CO2/N2 was passed over the sample for 90 min.

3.1. Characterization of BFM Monoliths
The crystallinity of the BFM monolith domains and dispersions of the metal dopants were assessed via XRD and EDS, respectively, as shown in Figure 3. First looking at the XRD spectra (Figure 3a), peaks were observed at 2θ = 7.5, 8.8, 22.5, and 49°, which are characteristic diffractive indices for pristine ZSM-5 powder. (18) Given that these representative indices were present in all samples without any observable broadening relative to the pristine zeolite, the XRD data indicated that (i) ZSM-5 was the predominant crystalline phase and (ii) calcining the zeolite alongside these metal dopants did not induce any sort of structural decomposition. Granted, it should also be noted here that the metal-doped samples all displayed a new diffractive peak at 2θ = 30°, which coincides with the [104] plane for CaCO3, so it is possible that the dopants somewhat strengthened the bonds between CaO and CO2, preventing complete conversion of the adsorbent. (20,21) This peak aside, it is worth noting here that some of the samples displayed crystalline phases of the metal dopants as well, signifying that the calcination process led to some degree of phase transition from the amorphous metal oxide precursors. For example, the Ce-doped sample displayed a diffractive peak at 2θ = 28° which indicates the [111] plane of CeO2, (22,23) whereas the Mo-doped sample displayed a new diffractive index at 2θ = 29° which corresponds to the [011] plane of MoO3. (24) As previously noted, these peaks indicated that crystalline phases of the Ce- and Mo-oxide dopants were present; however, it is unclear currently how such crystalline phases influenced the catalytic properties of the materials for ODHP reactions. It could only be stated with certainty that they were contained within the composite to some degree or another.
Figure 3
Figure 3. (a) XRD spectra of 3D-printed BFM adsorbent/catalyst monoliths and composite EDS maps for (b) In-, (c) Ce-, (d) Mo-, and (e) Cr-oxide dopants.
On the other hand, the relationship between metal dopant dispersion and catalytic behavior is generally more well-defined, as it is typically accepted that the metal dopant should be well-dispersed to ensure sufficient contact with the primary ZSM-5 phase. (25−28) Targeting such behavior, the EDS maps revealed that all dopants were present both on the catalyst surfaces and deep within the structure (circled); however, there were clear differences between the individual dispersions of the oxides. For example, In2O3 (Figure 3b) displayed large agglomerations that outcropped onto the surface with small pockets of the dopant being visible under the surface, whereas the other samples displayed higher dispersions of the oxide phases. Granted, EDS mapping only covers a localized area, so it cannot be said for certain if these maps were representative of the entire surface; however, it should be noted here that samples produced by direct ink writing of zeolite/oxide inks─such as those produced here─do not generate any surface discoloration and are homogenized at high mixing during densification, so they can be considered macroscopically homogeneous. However, at the microscopic level, migration and clustering of the metal oxides can lead to localized heterogeneity. For example, the CaO-In@ZSM-5 sample had the worst contact between the bifunctional catalyst components, whereas particularly high dispersions were observed in the Ce- (Figure 3c) and Cr-doped (Figure 3e) samples, as evidenced by the nonlocalized clustering observed in the EDS maps. In contrast, the MoO3 dopant (Figure 3d) seemed to have similar dispersion, but it appeared to lie more in the subsurface region of the composite. On the basis of these results, it was difficult to make any judgement pertaining to the performances of the Ce-, Cr-, or Mo-doped samples, but one might expect that the In-doped sample could display reduced activity if the localized clustering was present throughout the structural bulk. Of course, the metallic dispersion is only one small factor which determines catalytic activity, so this conclusion was not a very strong one as the ODHP behaviors are impacted to a larger degree by the acidities and redox properties of the catalyst phases, since these aspects control the degree to which ODHP is favored over thermal cracking and the degree to which H2 is removed from C3H8.
The textural properties of the BFM composite monoliths were assessed by N2 physisorption to further confirm that there was no deterioration of the ZSM-5 phase during calcination of the structures. The N2 physisorption and NLDFT pore distributions are shown in Figure 4a,b, respectively, whereas the corresponding textural properties are summarized in Table 3. First, looking at the physisorption profiles, it was observed that all samples displayed type-II physisorption behavior with type-H4 hysteresis, confirming their microporous texture as defined by the IUPAC classification. (29) Such behavior was anticipated because ZSM-5 was the primary source of pore volume in these materials, and it is known to be a microporous zeolite. It is also worth noting that the metal-doped samples showed miniscule reductions in textural properties compared to the CaO-ZSM-5 sample, which confirmed that there was no deterioration in the zeolite structure during calcination. Indeed, this was reflected in the pore distributions as well, where all samples showed a dominant pore structure within the microporous regime. Therefore, Figure 4 and Table 3 signified that the BFM monoliths had good retention of the ZSM-5 textural structure, likely signifying the fact that the catalytic activity of the zeolite was also retained.

3.2. BFM Monolith Redox Properties
The catalyst redox properties were analyzed with H2-TPR, and supplemental XPS was performed to confirm the oxidative states of the metal dopants, as shown in Figure 5. First looking at the XPS profiles of the dopants, it was observed that all metals displayed peaks which were consistent with the literature for the expected oxidative state of the oxide phase. For example, the In-doped sample (Figure 5a) showed characteristic peaks at 444 and 452 eV which indicated the orbital spins of In-3d5/2 and In-3d3/2, respectively, and signified that In3+ was the dominant oxidation state. (30,31) Meanwhile, CaO-Ce@ZSM-5 (Figure 5b) displayed XPS peaks at 883, 889, 898, 902, 908, and 917 eV which coincide with the Ce-3d5/2, Ce-3d5/2, Ce-3d5/2, Ce-3d3/2, Ce-3d3/2, and Ce-3d3/2 orbital spins, respectively, and are consistent with the Ce4+ XPS spectra. (32) As another example, the Mo-doped sample (Figure 5c) displayed the anticipated XPS peaks at 232.5 and 235.5 eV which correspond to the Mo-3d3/2 and Mo-3d5/2 orbital states of Mo6+. (33) Finally, CaO-Cr@ZSM-5 displayed the typical XPS peaks at 575, 579, and 586–588 eV which corresponded to the orbital spins of Cr-2p3/2, Cr-2p3/2, and Cr-2p1/2, respectively, in Cr3+. (34) Given that these peaks were consistent with the well-established literature of these metals, it was concluded that the dopants did not undergo any sort of reduction during calcination. This was to be expected since monolith calcination occurred in air and no reductive atmosphere was present.

In a similar way, the H2-TPR profiles (Figure 5e) signified that the reductive temperatures of the metal dopants were comparable to the values observed in the literature. For example, the In-doped sample underwent reduction at 275, 375, and 625 °C, where the first peak corresponds to the surface reduction of In2O3, whereas the latter two peaks stem from different bulk reductions of In3+ into In0. (35) Meanwhile, CaO-Ce@ZSM-5 showed the reductive peaks of CeO2 at 280 and 375 °C which relate to the surface reduction of CeO2 and the bulk reduction of Ce4+ to Ce0. (36,37) Linganiso et al. (37) studied the effect of Ca on the reduction of ceria by TPR-XANES and found that the surface shell reduction (defect formation) of Ca-doped ceria occurs at a lower temperature than observed with the ceria alone. Without Ca, bulk CeO2 typically has surface shell reduction at T = 450 °C and bulk reduction at T = 700 °C or higher. Therefore, the two different peaks may reflect differences in the Ce/Ca ratio for the surface reduction step. In CaO-Mo@ZSM-5, a shoulder was present from 250 to 300 °C with the major peak appearing at 350 °C, where both peaks coincide with Mo6+ reduction into Mo4+ with the shoulder relating to surface reduction and the major peak relating to bulk reduction. (38,39) Finally, the Cr-doped sample displayed typical reductive behavior for Cr2O3, as it generated TPR peaks at 325 and 550 °C and a shoulder from 375 to 450 °C, where the shoulder and 325 °C peak correspond to the surface reduction of Cr3+ into Cr2+, while the major peak at 550 °C indicates bulk reduction of Cr3+ into Cr0. (40) As with the XPS data, these reductive temperatures were consistent with the open literature, so it was concluded from Figure 5 that the calcination process did not significantly influence the redox properties of the metal oxides. It should also be noted here that the bare CaO-ZSM-5 sample displayed no reductive behavior as well, aside from water desorption from bentonite at high temperature, which signified that the ZSM-5 phase was also uneffaced by the metal dopants with regard to its redox properties. Pertaining to the ODHP performance of these materials, it is difficult to speculate how these differences in redox behavior will influence the propylene selectivity and propane conversion because singular bed CO2 capture and ODHP utilization have never been reported before. However, previous reports suggest that the undoped sample may generate the worst performance because the metal oxide phases impart alternative pathways for reduction, thus shifting the reaction equilibrium toward dehydrogenation over thermal cracking. Indeed, this was observed in the capture/conversion experiments, as will be discussed in Section 3.4.
To provide further insight into the physiochemical properties of the catalyst phases within the 3D-printed BFMs, the acid sites were quantified with NH3-TPD and characterized by type using Py-FTIR, as shown in Figure 6. First looking at the NH3-TPD profiles (Figure 6a), the samples all displayed a combination of weak and strong acid sites corresponding to the ammonia desorption at 170 and 650 °C, respectively. Evidently, the Cr-doped sample was the most acidic of the monoliths, as indicated by its highest amount of ammonia desorption, which was not surprising, given that Cr2O3 is a strong acid. Hence, it is commonly used as a ZSM-5 dopant. (41) With regard to the ODHP performance, this acidity may not be advantageous because it could make the sample too active at a high temperature of 600–700 °C; however, this could not be said for certain without running the actual experiments. It should also be noted here that the other metal-doped samples displayed similar acidities, but the concentration of strong acid sites was slightly less for CaO-Mo@ZSM-5 compared to the other monoliths. Granted, the difference in acidity was not that much, so it could have stemmed from the experimental error, effectively indicating that the undoped, Ce-, Mo-, and In-doped monoliths were similarly acidic, albeit less acidic than CaO-Cr@ZSM-5. All of this being said, the acidity of the samples is not the only factor which influences catalytic performance, as the type of acid site is equally important since it determines the overall dehydrogenation behavior and cracking/ODHP equilibrium. In this regard, in Py-FTIR (Figure 6a), spectra indicated that all samples had a mixture of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, with most of the sites being composed of Lewis sites, as evidenced by the strong peak at 1440 cm–1. Such dominant Lewis acidity was anticipated because ZSM-5 (i.e., the primary catalyst) is a known Lewis acid, meaning that the Brønsted acid sites should arise from the low-concentration dopants. (42−44) Therefore, Figure 6 indicated that differences in the catalytic behaviors of the BFM composites should arise mostly from the redox properties and metal dispersions, given that the acidities were similar except for the Cr-doped sample. That said, it is possible that any differences in catalytic behavior for CaO-Cr@ZSM-5 could stem from both the redox properties and heightened acidity, since this was the only sample which displayed an enhancement in acid site strength/density.

3.3. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy
The reactive behaviors of the catalysts with and without CO2 from 100 to 500 °C were assessed via C3H8-DRIFTS to determine how CO2, temperature, and metal dopant influence the ODHP reaction. First, it should be noted that in both the presence and absence of CO2, all samples displayed vibrational bands at 2144 and 1934 cm–1, signifying CO formation and indicating that some form of propane reaction occurred at 500 °C for all samples regardless of the oxidant concentration in the atmosphere. (45) However, it is also worth noting that the CO bands were more intense during the CO2-containing runs, thereby also suggesting that CO2 was converted into CO and acted as a light oxidant as per our intention. Nevertheless, the presence of CO in the samples in the CO2-free runs also indicated that the catalyst phases, including the bentonite binder, acted as oxidants in the reaction, given that oxygen donation would have been impossible otherwise. Such behavior was present to a stronger degree in the metal-doped samples, which indicated that the dopants acted as oxidative sources for CO synthesis from propane, which is the first time this behavior has ever been reported for structured materials to the best of our knowledge and appears to be a unique property of these 3D-printed BFM adsorbent/catalysts.
Regarding the actual CO2-ODHP behavior, it should first be noted that the samples all generated the typical vibrational bands for propane (e.g., 1750, 1700, 1600, 1425, 1350, and 1200 cm–1), (46,47) which indicated that the reactant was not immediately converted over the samples upon introduction into the chamber. Therefore, the CO2-ODHP reaction mechanism could be considered as a true two-step adsorption/catalysis mechanism, since the propane had to be introduced to the catalyst surface before incurring any charge transfer across the various phases. Such effects are typical for heterogeneous catalysts used for CO2-ODHP, so these modes of vibration were not considered to be overly important. Therefore, most of the rest of this discussion is focused solely on the vibrational bands for propylene, which occur below 1200 cm–1. Pertaining to this behavior, there were clear differences in the sample DRIFTS vibrations which signified higher activity in some samples and minimal propylene production in the others. To be specific, Figure 7 indicated that introducing metal dopants generates a greater chance for propane/propylene conversion, as the undoped sample (Figure 7a,b) did not display the characteristic peak for at 1026 cm–1 that coincides with allylic attachment of propylene to metal oxides. (6,48,49) This peak was similarly absent in the Cr-doped sample (Figure 7i,j), meaning that CaO-Cr@ZSM-5 also failed to generate propylene at 500 °C or below. On the other hand, this characteristic peak was present to some degree over the In- (Figure 7c,d) Ce- (Figure 7e,f), and Mo-doped (Figure 7g,h) samples when CO2 was present, which indicated that all three of these monoliths successfully synthesized propylene from propane. Upon removing CO2, however, this peak disappeared in all but the In-doped samples, which signaled that (i) CaO-In@ZSM-5 likely generates propylene via nonoxidative dehydrogenation and (ii) CO2 plays an important role in the ODHP mechanism for the Ce- and Mo-doped monoliths.

These samples also displayed intense vibrational bands from 1150 to 1080 cm–1 in the presence of CO2, which relate to bidentate attachment to metal oxide (i.e., CaO) active sites. (50,51) Relating this behavior back to propylene synthesis over these samples, the DRIFTS spectra suggested that CO2 was both adsorbed and consumed from the CaO adsorbent during the ODHP experiments. For instance, the bidentate attachment in the presence of CO2 and lack of propylene in the absence of CO2 likely signified that some degree of adsorption-release-consumption occurred over the heterogeneous adsorbent/catalyst phase. Granted, this behavior is not fully understood at present, especially considering that this is the first time any sort of CO2-ODHP over BFM composite materials has been reported, but the conventional literature which focuses on both (i) CO2 adsorption onto CaO (50−52) and (ii) direct CO2-ODHP over heterogeneous catalysis agrees with this working theory. (6,48,49) Therefore, it was concluded from Figure 7 that CaO-Ce@ZSM-5 and CaO-Mo@ZSM-5 were likely the most active BFM materials for combined CO2 capture and ODHP utilization. Having said this, it should also be noted here that, due to limitations in our DRIFTS setup, we were unable to perform this experiment under the realistic actual conditions of 600–700 °C, so the behaviors observed in these experiments merely signaled that these samples were the most active at 500 °C. However, the DRIFTS experiments did not fully discount the possibility of CO2-ODHP occurring over the other catalysts, given that the elevated reaction temperature could be sufficient for overcoming the activation barrier of CaO-ZSM-5, CaO-Cr@ZSM-5, and CaO-In@ZSM-5, thus still leading to propylene synthesis.
3.4. Combined Adsorption/Catalysis Experiments
The combined adsorption/catalysis results are shown in Figure 8, whereas the summarized product selectivities at different temperatures are shown in Table 4. For reference, the dynamic product distributions are shown in Figures S2–S6, Supporting Information. Additionally, the various ODHP reaction mechanisms are defined in Eq S1−S5, Supporting Information. First looking at the adsorption capacities of the samples (Figure 8a), all monoliths displayed adsorption capacities of 5.0–5.2, signifying that there were minimal effects from the metal dopants on the affinity for CO2. Looking at the actual adsorption/catalysis experiments, it should first be noted that all samples generated propylene to some degree or another while also consuming CO2, signaling a successful first-ever proof-of-concept for the application of structured BFMs to ODHP applications. It should also be noted here that the samples displayed higher propane conversion but reduced CO2 conversion and propylene yield as the temperature was increased, which could be attributed to a reactivity shift toward thermal cracking instead of dehydrogenation as evidenced by the increased light hydrocarbon selectivity at 650 and 700 °C in Table 4. Interestingly, this behavior differed from that which has been observed for ethane dehydrogenation over BFM materials, (10) where CO2 desorption and subsequent utilization do not occur below 700 °C due to retention of the adsorbate in the form of CaCO3. This suggests that ODHP over BFMs is of higher thermodynamic favorability compared to ODHE, as the former process utilizes CO2 to a higher degree at lower temperature. It is generally accepted that such differences in behavior are driven by a combination of catalyst dispersion, redox properties, and catalytic acidity; however, the performances of these BFM composites may be additionally affected by unforeseeable adsorbent/catalyst phase interactions that are yet to be studied. Therefore, the underlying reasons for the differences in behavior across these materials still require investigation which will be targeted in later studies; however, the first aspect in this area was to confirm that BFM-ODHP was even possible over composite materials and to determine which materials were effective for such applications. In this regard, these initial findings showed that combined adsorption/catalysis for ODHP can occur solely at 600 °C. Thus, ODHP over these 3D-printed BFM monoliths completely eradicates the adsorption/catalysis thermal swing, thereby enhancing the process output and considerably lowering the energy requirement.

Regarding the actual propylene yields, Figure 8 indicates that selection of the metal dopant is critical for optimizing the ODHP behavior but is of lesser importance compared to the effects on product selectivity. It should be noted here that the product selectivities were low compared to what would be expected from the propylene yield, but this was a byproduct of how the selectivities were calculated. For instance, the selectivities were calculated using a methodology which considers all reactionary pathways and byproducts, whereas other studies typically only consider the hydrocarbon selectivities. Hence, the individual product selectivities are less meaningful as compared to the propylene yields. Regrading this, the undoped sample (Figure 8b) displayed the highest CO2 conversion at 600 °C but also generated the lowest propylene yield (i.e., 15%). In contrast, at the same temperature, the metal-doped samples all displayed some degree of enhancement in both propane conversion and propylene yield. Specifically, the highest propylene yields were observed in CaO-In@ZSM-5 (Figure 8c), CaO-Mo@ZSM-5 (Figure 8e), and CaO-Cr@ZSM-5 (Figure 8f), which achieved 22, 20.4, and 24% yields, respectively. Between these, it is worth noting that─although the Mo-doped sample displayed a slightly lower propylene yield─it was the only sample which achieved a comparable CO2 conversion to the undoped monolith. Therefore, it could be argued that CaO-Mo@ZSM-5 was the best overall sample for bifunctional CO2 adsorption and ODHP catalysis if a good balance of CO2 conversion and propylene yield is desired. The high performance of this sample could likely be attributed to its slightly lower acidity than Cr2O3, as was observed in NH3-TPD, which imparted high catalytic activity with good control over the dehydrogenation mechanism. However, Figure 8 also suggests that it may be worth doping Cr2O3 alongside MoO3 to enhance the catalytic properties of the composite, as the propylene yield did benefit somewhat from the high chromia acidity. Nevertheless, such efforts should be the target of subsequent studies as this work is focused on establishing a proof-of-concept for the use of 3D-printed BFM monoliths for CO2 capture and ODHP reaction in a single bed. In this regard, Figure 8 successfully proves this possibility as propylene was generated while CO2 was consumed in all samples, thus demonstrating the efficacy of metal oxide 3D printing as a route of formulating structured BFM contactors.
To demonstrate the cyclic stability of CaO-Mo@ZSM-5─the best performing catalyst of those screened─isothermal adsorption/reaction experiments were performed across 10 cycles at 600 °C. The performance of the catalyst is summarized in Figure 9 with the various selectivities and conversions being shown in Table 5. The product profiles are contained in Figure S7, Supporting Information. For reference, we also performed a single cycle on a powdered CaO-Mo@ZSM-5 analogue to demonstrate comparison to the honeycomb (Figure 9a). Its product distribution is shown in Figure S8, Supporting Information. As evident from the comparison, the performance of the honeycomb was somewhat comparable to the powder; however, the monolith achieved ∼5% more CO2 conversion and less H2 production, indicating that it more favored true oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, whereas the powder more favored thermal propane cracking. This suggests a slight enhancement in reactionary kinetics in the honeycomb monolith. Regarding the stability of the printed honeycomb monolith (Figure 9b), the CO2 conversion trended slightly downward across cycles, although it was maintained above 70% across all 10 runs. However, the propane conversions and propylene yields remained relatively constant throughout, indicating that there may have been a small shift toward cracking when CO2 was not being converted, albeit a small shift due to the fact that CO2 conversion remained high throughout the 10 runs. In this context, the CaO-Mo@ZSM-5 BFM could be considered stable for CO2 capture and ODHP conversion, which is especially impressive considering that the two steps occurred at the same temperature. Such effects indicate that the BFM could truly act as both an adsorbent and catalyst simultaneously, and with high stability, without incurring the energy expense which is commonly touted as a reason for which these materials cannot be implemented. Therefore, Figure 9 further cemented the performance of these BFM materials, especially CaO-Mo@ZSM-5, since the material was catalytically stable across 10 runs with unprecedentedly high CO2 conversion.

4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In this study, we reported the first generation of structured BFMs by 3D printing and applied the concept of combined adsorption/catalysis to the previously unreported area of oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propylene. In particular, this study screened different metal dopants within 3D-printed BFM monoliths, performed thorough characterization, and optimized the reaction temperature. The multitude of characterizations clearly indicated that the various metal dopants led to different behaviors with respect to metal dispersion, redox properties, and catalytic acidity. However, it is presently difficult to relate such properties with the behaviors of BFMs in adsorptive/catalytic processes, given the relatively unknown nature of BFM composites and lack of literature for ODHP applications. Nevertheless, it can be argued based on the reactivity results presented here that the catalyst should be weakly acidic and contain some amount of strong acid sites, as this combination of properties can both drive the dehydrogenation reaction while leading to good CO2 oxidation. This is further evident by the fact that both adsorption and catalysis were successfully performed at the same temperature with high stability being observed across 10 cycles for the Mo-doped sample, meaning that issues of (i) adsorbed CO2 being lost during temperature swing, (ii) long cycle cooling times, and (iii) BFM recyclability are not concerns with these materials. Of the composites considered, the best overall performance observed was in the Mo-doped sample, which generated a respectable 20.4% propylene yield while also achieving a ∼75% conversion of CO2. Noteworthy behaviors were also observed in the In- and Cr-doped samples, which achieved higher propylene yields with lesser degrees of CO2 conversion. Accordingly, it may be worth making a composite monolith of these metal oxides to generate a BFM with exceptional performance for ODHP. It is otherwise pertinent to vary the dopant/zeolite/adsorbent ratio to further optimize propylene yield, but the first step in building such a knowledge base─that is, identifying dopants of interest─was accomplished here. Subsequent studies can now build upon this foundation and generate structured BFMs with performances more tuned to practical use. As additional follow-up, we also propose that work can be performed related to understanding the performances of the materials under more realistic conditions, such as feeds which contain O2, acidic contaminants, and or humidity, since this will be more analogous to at-scale performance. Of course, these subsequent studies would not be possible had a structuring method for BFMs not been successfully proven. In this context, the work herein provides significant progress toward this goal and an initial baseline metal screening and proof-of-concept for BFMs over 3D-printed adsorbent/catalyst monoliths, which were able to successfully perform CO2 adsorption and catalytic processes at the same temperature with high stability across 10 cycles. The importance of the latter two aspects to the area of BFM materials should not be understated, as these capabilities can allow one to fully eliminate the thermal swing of capture-conversion processes and reuse the spent material indefinitely. As such, this study should fundamentally advance BFM material science─in that it demonstrated the first generation of structured BFMs─and single-bed capture/conversion technology.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
