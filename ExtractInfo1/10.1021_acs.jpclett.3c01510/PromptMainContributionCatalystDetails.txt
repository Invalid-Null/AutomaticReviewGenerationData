Extending Carrier Lifetime of Antiferromagnetic LaFeO3 Perovskite by Regulating Magnetic Ordering: Time-Domain Ab Initio Analysis
Abstract
Focusing on LaFeO3, we investigated the effects of magnetic ordering on carrier relaxation using time-domain density functional theory and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics. The results show that the hot energy and carrier relaxation occur on a sub-2 ps time scale due to the strong intraband nonadiabatic coupling, and the corresponding time scales are distinct depending on the magnetic ordering of LaFeO3. Importantly, the energy relaxation is slower than hot carrier relaxation, guaranteeing photogenerated hot carriers can be effectively relaxed to the band edge before cooling. Following hot carrier relaxation, the charge recombination occurs on the nanosecond scale due to the small interband nonadiabatic coupling and short pure-dephasing times. In addition, the A-AFM system has the longest carrier lifetimes because of its weakest nonadiabatic coupling. Our study suggests that the carrier lifetime can be controlled by changing the magnetic ordering of perovskite oxides and provides valuable principles for the design of high-performance photoelectrodes.

Metal oxides have attracted great research interest due to their low cost, photostability, and suitable band gap. (1−9) At the same time, their band edge energies straddle the water reduction and oxidation potentials. (10−13) These excellent performances motivate the usage of metal oxides as photoelectrodes in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting. (14−16) However, the efficiency of water-splitting based on metal oxides is lower than the theoretical limit, significantly limiting their practical applications. (17) The major reason is the fast charge and energy losses caused by nonradiative carrier relaxation in metal oxides. (18−21)
Recent studies have shown that many factors, including polarons, (22) defects, (23−25) doping passivation, (26) and molecular adsorption, (27) significantly affect the nonradiative carrier relaxation in metal oxide semiconductors. For example, Zhang et al. have reported that the formation of a small polaron induced by photoexcitation can accelerate the charge recombination in rutile TiO2. (22) Long and coauthors have demonstrated that oxygen vacancies reduce nonradiative electron–hole recombination in WO3 photoanode, (23) while oxygen vacancies accelerate nonradiative electron–hole recombination in BiVO4 photoanode. (24) At the same time, they propose that ionized oxygen vacancies can eliminate the trap states within the band gap of BiVO4 and prolong the charge recombination time. (24) In addition to polarons and defects, the concentration and spin state of oxygen vacancies also dramatically regulate carrier relaxation. Gao et al. have shown that the low-concentration oxygen vacancies prolong the carrier lifetime, while high-concentration oxygen vacancies create recombination centers, accelerating the nonradiative charge recombination. (28) Prezhdo and coauthors have proposed that hole trap states’ energy level position can be changed by enhancing the degree of spin polarization of oxygen vacancies, increasing the charge carrier lifetime in a BiVO4 photoanode. (25)
In addition to the above factors that regulate carrier dynamics, magnetic ordering is also a valuable factor that influences the photoelectric performance in magnetic materials. Perovskite-type metal oxides are common antiferromagnetic materials; the valence electrons of magnetic elements have opposite spins, and the total magnetic moment is zero. (29) There are three common magnetic orderings in antiferromagnetic materials (Figure 1), including E-type (E-AFM), C-type (C-AFM), and A-type (A-AFM) antiferromagnetic ordering. Today, most theoretical studies are focused on the study of static electronic structures. How magnetic ordering affects the nonradiative carrier relaxation has not been reported in antiferromagnetic perovskite-type metal oxides.

Perovskite-type lanthanum iron oxide, LaFeO3, is a common antiferromagnetic semiconductor. (30) Focusing on LaFeO3, we have investigated the effects of magnetic ordering on the electronic structures and photogenerated charge carrier relaxation using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD). The simulations show that changing the magnetic ordering of LaFeO3 can significantly regulate the nonradiative hot carrier relaxation and electron–hole recombination. The A-AFM system has the longest hot carrier relaxation time compared to the E-AFM and C-AFM systems due to its weaker NA coupling. Importantly, A-AFM also has the largest electron–hole recombination time even though it has a smaller band gap and longer pure-dephasing time. This is because the NA coupling between the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) in the A-AFM system is small compared to that of other systems, indicating that the NA coupling is the major factor that determines the charge transition process. In three systems, the charge carrier dynamics are caused primarily by vibration with frequencies near 600 cm–1. The time domain NAMD simulations enhance our understanding of the effects of magnetic ordering on the physical properties of LaFeO3 perovskites and propose that the performance of antiferromagnetic photoelectrode materials can be controlled and enhanced by changing the magnetic ordering.
All spin-polarized DFT calculations are performed using Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP), (31) including geometric optimization, electronic structure, adiabatic MD, and NA coupling calculations. The exchange–correlation interactions are described using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. (32) The interactions between the valence electrons and ionic cores are treated via the projector augmented wave (PAW) method. (33) The van der Waals (vdW) interactions are described using the Grimme DFT-D3 method. (34) The energy cutoff of the plane wave is set to 500 eV. A 2 × 4 × 3 Γ-centered Monkhorst–Pack k-point mesh is adopted for geometric optimization and electronic structure calculations. To overcome the shortcoming of the PBE functional that underestimates the band gap of metal oxides, we use the DFT+U method to describe the local properties of Fe 3d orbitals (U = 4.3 eV). (35) During the calculations, the magnetic moment of Fe atoms is set to 4.6 μB. (36)
After geometric optimization at 0 K, all systems are heated to 300 K through repeated velocity rescaling. Then, a 6 ps microcanonical ensemble (NVE) MD calculation at 300 K is carried out with a time step of 1 fs, and the generated adiabatic trajectories are used to compute the NA Hamiltonian. Finally, two thousand initial configurations are chosen from the 6 ps MD trajectories for NAMD simulations. The simulations of the nonradiative charge carrier relaxation processes are carried out using the NAMD and TD-DFT (37) in the Kohn–Sham representation. (38−40) The hot carrier relaxation and electron–hole recombination process are calculated using the fewest switching surface hopping (FSSH) (41) and decoherence-induced surface hopping (DISH), (42) respectively. During the NAMD simulations, the electrons and nuclei are treated quantum mechanically and (semi)-classically, respectively. Traditionally, the charge recombination time is orders of magnitude shorter than the decoherence time. Thus, it is needed to consider the decoherence effects in electron–hole recombination simulations. (43−45) The decoherence time is expressed as the pure dephasing time in the optical response theory, which can be computed using the second-order cumulant approximation. (46) The NAMD method has been successfully applied to investigate the photogenerated charge carrier dynamics in many semiconductor materials, such as perovskites, (47−50) metal oxides, (51−53) transition metal dichalcogenides, (54,55) and black phosphorus. (56,57)
First, we discuss the geometric properties of LaFeO3 with different magnetic ordering. Then, we analyze their electronic structure and nonadiabatic coupling. Finally, we investigate the hot carrier relaxation and electron–hole recombination dynamics in three systems to uncover the effects of magnetic ordering on the charge carrier lifetime in antiferromagnetic LaFeO3 perovskite.
Figures 2 and S1 show the geometries of LaFeO3 supercell (2 × 1 × 1) with different magnetic ordering at 0 and 300 K. LaFeO3 is a typical perovskite with an orthorhombic crystal structure and belongs to the Pbnm space group. (58−61) At 0 K, the averaged Fe–O bond lengths have little difference in the three systems (2.017 Å in E-AFM, 2.018 Å in C-AFM, 2.022 Å in A-AFM), and the averaged Fe–O bond lengths agree well the with experimental value (2.006 Å). (62) As the temperature increases to 300 K, the increments of the averaged Fe–O bond lengths are 0.015 0.017, and 0.015 Å for E-AFM, C-AFM, and A-AFM systems, respectively. These tiny changes in the average Fe–O bond lengths indicate that the employed structures are reasonable and stable. This can also be proven by the evolution of the Fe–O bond lengths for the FeO6 octahedron. The Fe–O bond lengths have small fluctuations in equilibrium, demonstrating that the influence of heating on Fe–O bond lengths is minor and the Fe–O inorganic lattice is rigid (Figure S2).

To investigate the effects of heating on the nuclear dynamics in LaFeO3 perovskites, we further calculated the canonically averaged standard deviations of the position of each atom using the equation, σi =

. Here, r⃗i stands for the position of the atom, and the angular brackets represent ensemble averaging. The computed data, Table 1, show that the total standard deviations in the positions of all atoms for the three systems increase in the following order: E-AFM < C-AFM < A-AFM. The A-AFM system has the largest standard deviation in the three systems, while the total standard deviations are small (≤0.112 Å), indicating that heat has little effect on the structural stability of LaFeO3 perovskites. In addition, the standard deviation of the O atoms is largest compared to La and Fe atoms because the weight of the O atoms is lighter than that of the La and Fe atoms. At the same time, the standard deviations for heavier La atoms are larger than those of lighter Fe atoms. The reason is that La atoms exist as ions in the LaFeO3 perovskite and they migrate more easily.

Using the optimized geometries, we further calculated the electronic structures of LaFeO3 with different magnetic ordering, including the projected density of states (PDOS), charge densities of the VBM and CBM involved in electron–hole recombination, and band structures. The spin-up PDOS of LaFeO3 with different magnetic ordering shows that the VBM is primarily dominated by the p orbitals of O and d orbitals of Fe atoms, and the CBM are primarily formed by the d orbitals of Fe atoms (Figures 3a–c and S3), agreeing well with other DFT calculation. (63) It is worth noting that magnetic ordering has a strong influence on the band gap of the LaFeO3 semiconductor. The band gaps of the E-AFM, C-AFM, and A-AFM systems are 2.05 2.06, and 1.23 eV, indicating that changing the magnetic ordering of the antiferromagnetic LaFeO3 perovskite can create a different band gap.
Figure 3
Figure 3. Spin-up projected densities of states (PDOS) and band structures of (a, d) E-AFM, (b, e) C-AFM, and (c, f) A-AFM. The Fermi level is set to zero. The PDOS of LaFeO3 with different magnetic ordering shows that VBM is mainly supported by the O and Fe orbitals and CBM is primarily formed by Fe orbitals. All three systems have direct band gaps at the Γ point.
The spin-up charge densities of the VBM are concentrated close to the O and Fe atoms, while the charge densities of the CBM are mainly gathered around Fe atoms, which agree well with the PDOS (Figure 3a–c). Meanwhile, the charge density of the VBM is distributed on the O and Fe atoms, and the charge density of the CBM is delocalized on the Fe atoms within the entire simulation cell in the E-AFM system (Figure S5a). As for the C-AFM system, the charge density of the VBM is delocalized on the whole structure, while the charge density of the CBM is localized on just the partial Fe atoms (Figure S5c). By contrast, the charge densities of VBM and CBM are localized in different regions of the simulation cell in the E-AFM system (Figure S5e). Thus, the value of wave function mixing, −iℏ⟨ϕj | ∇R | ϕk⟩, between VBM and CBM changes in the order E-AFM > C-AFM > A-AFM, and as a result, the NA coupling between VBM and CBM follows the same trend (Table 2). We also further calculated the spin-up band structures of three systems (Figure 3d–f). It can be seen that the positions of the VBM and CBM are at the Γ point, indicating that the LaFeO3 perovskite is a direct band gap semiconductor. This is in good agreement with the experimental reports. (64,65) In addition, the changing trend of the band gap agrees well with the PDOS analysis (Figure 3a–c). The corresponding PDOS, charge densities, and band structures in the spin-down channel are shown in Figures S4 and S5b,d,f. We can draw the same conclusion as the results in the spin-up channel.

We select two electronic states higher than the CBM and VBM 0.6 eV as initial states to simulate the hot carrier relaxation process because the experimental hot carrier energy is about 0.6 eV. (66,67) Figure 4 shows the hot energy and carrier relaxation dynamics calculated by using the fewest switching surface hopping (FSSH) method in three systems. The time scales presented in Figure 4 are obtained by fitting the curves with an exponential function, Y(t) =

. It can be seen that the energy relaxation times are longer than the corresponding hot electron and hole relaxation times. The long-lived “hot” carriers guarantee that photogenerated carriers can be effectively relaxed to the band edge before cooling. In addition, the hot electron relaxation times increase in the following order: C-AFM < E-AFM < A-AFM, and the hot hole relaxation time changes in the order E-AFM < C-AFM < A-AFM. The A-AFM system has the longest hot electron and hole relaxation time, indicating that the lifetimes of the hot carrier can be prolonged by changing the magnetic ordering of the LaFeO3 perovskite.

To investigate the regulatory mechanism of magnetic ordering on energy and carrier relaxation in three systems, we further calculated the NA coupling strength between adjacent and nonadjacent electronic states participating in the hot carrier relaxation process. Figure 5 shows the spin-up averaged value of the NA couplings for hot carrier relaxation within the CB and VB. The diagonal line is the NA coupling between adjacent electronic states, and the nondiagonal line represents the NA coupling between nonadjacent electronic states. The NA coupling is the main factor causing the nonradiative transition of hot carriers. Traditionally, the stronger the NA coupling, the faster the hot carrier relaxation. It can be seen that the NA coupling along the diagonal line is strong, indicating that nonradiative transition between adjacent electronic states is the major channel for hot electron and hole relaxation. The NA coupling along the nondiagonal line is weak because the strength of the nonadiabatic coupling is inversely proportional to the energy level difference, (68) which plays a minor role in hot carrier relaxation.

The stronger NA coupling between electronic states, the faster hot energy, and carrier relaxation. The number 1 represents CBM or VBM, and the number 1 + N denotes the CBM + N or VBM – N.
Seen from Figure 5a–c and Tables S1 and S2, the values of NA coupling between adjacent electronic states involved in the hot electron relaxation process in CB increase in the following order: A-AFM < E-AFM < C-AFM (Figure 5a–c), resulting in the hot energy and electron relaxation time reducing in the reverse order (Figure 4). Similarly, the values of NA coupling between adjacent electronic states involved in the hot hole relaxation process in VB increase in the order A-AFM < C-AFM < E-AFM (Figure 5d–f). Thus, the hot hole and energy relaxation time are a result of the reverse trend (Figure 4). The corresponding time evolution of the energy and population decay and visualization of the spin-up averaged NA coupling for the hot carrier relaxation in the spin-down channel are presented in Figures S6 and S7, which well consists of the analysis of the spin-up channel.
Nonradiative electron–hole recombination has strong effects on the photoelectric performance of the LaFeO3 perovskite. The long charge recombination time benefits obtaining an excellent catalyst. Generally, the band gap, quantum decoherence, and NA coupling determine the nonradiative electron–hole recombination time. (69,70) First, we computed the time-dependent band gaps and frequency distributions of the band gaps for 6 ps trajectories in three systems (Figure 6a–c). The obtained data show that the band gaps of E-AFM (Figure 6a), C-AFM (Figure 6b), and A-AFM (Figure 6c) primarily fluctuate around their band gaps calculated by using the PBE+U function because of the thermal effect. The averaged band gaps of E-AFM, C-AFM, and A-AFM are 1.96, 2.11, and 1.46 eV (Table 2), which are close to the band gaps (2.05 eV in E-AFM, 2.06 eV in C-AFM, and 1.23 eV in A-AFM) computed using the PBE+U function. The difference values of energy gaps at 0 and 300 K are only −0.09 eV in E-AFM, 0.05 eV in C-AFM, and 0.23 eV in A-AFM, respectively. Such minor changes in band gaps demonstrate that the temperature has little impact on band gaps in LaFeO3 perovskite with different magnetic ordering.

Second, we further calculate the value of NA coupling to investigate the effects of magnetic ordering on NA coupling between CBM and VBM using the following function: (71)

The obtained NA coupling of the 2000 fs trajectories is shown in Figure 6d,e, and the averaged values of NA coupling between the CBM and VBM are summarized in Table 2. It can be seen that the magnetic ordering significantly influences the NA coupling between CBM and VBM. The value of NA coupling is 3.07 meV in E-AFM, which decreases by a factor of 1.27 (2.41 meV) in C-AFM and 2.36 (1.30 meV) in A-AFM. Thus, we can conclude that changing the magnetic ordering can weaken the intensity of NA coupling and suppress the nonradiative electron–hole recombination and energy losses, enhancing the catalytic activity of LaFeO3 perovskite.
To characterize the phonon modes participating in the nonradiative electron–hole recombination, we obtained the spin-up Fourier transforms (FTs) of autocorrelation functions (ACF) of the CBM–VBM band gap fluctuations in the three systems. The intensity and frequency of each peak in the FTs characterize the strength of electron–vibrational interaction. Seen from Figure 6g, only low-frequency vibrations below 800 cm–1 participate in the nonradiative electron–hole recombination process in LaFeO3 with different magnetic ordering, interpreting the weak NA electron–phonon coupling between the CBM and VBM in LaFeO3 semiconductors. The weak peaks around 300 cm–1 and major peaks near 600 cm–1 can be attributed to the Ag assigned modes, two-photon, and impurity related scattering. (72,73) The minor peaks around 400 cm–1 can be ascribed to the vibrations of B3g assigned modes. (72,73) The peak below 200 cm–1 can be assigned to the Ag and B1g assigned modes. (72,73) As for E-AFM and C-AFM systems, the FTs have higher frequencies than those in the A-AFM system, resulting in stronger electron–phonon interactions (Table 2) in the first two systems than the latter. In addition, the intensity of FTs in E-AFM is stronger than that in C-AFM. Thus, the value of electron–phonon interactions is larger in the former than in the latter.
Quantum decoherence also affects the nonradiative electron–hole recombination dynamics, and the shorter decoherence time favors slower quantum dynamics. (70) This can be interpreted using the quantum Zeno effect. (74) Figure 6h shows the pure-dephasing functions computed with the second-order cumulant approximation in optical response theory. (46) The pure-dephasing time, τ, is obtained by fitting to the curves using the Gaussian function, D(t) =
exp[−0.5

, and the obtained data are summarized in Table 2. The pure-dephasing times of all three systems are less than 10 ps, which favors slow charge recombination. At the same time, the pure-dephasing times are 6 orders of magnitude smaller than the nonradiative charge recombination times. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the decoherence effects in the NAMD simulation. (42)
To further study the effects of magnetic ordering on the pure-dephasing process, we computed the unnormalized autocorrelation functions (ACFs) for the fluctuations of the CBM–VBM band gaps (inset of Figure 6h). The initial value represents the square of the phonon band gap, and the larger initial value of un-ACF results in faster pure-dephasing times. The results show that all ACF decay on similar time scales, while their initial ACF values are different. The initial ACF values in three systems decrease in the order: C-AFM > E-AFM > A-AFM, leading to the opposite order of the pure-dephasing times.
Finally, we performed the NAMD simulations to analyze the nonradiative electron–hole recombination dynamics in three systems. The charge recombination times are obtained by fitting the function P(t) =
exp(−

)
. Figure 6i shows that the electron–hole recombination time is 2.26 ns in the E-AFM system. The corresponding time increases to 2.33 ns in the C-AFM system due to its weaker NA coupling and faster pure-dephasing compared with the E-AFM system. Moreover, the electron–hole recombination time is the longest in the A-AFM system because of its smaller value of NA coupling compared to other systems. We also calculated the time-dependent and frequency distributions of the band for 6 ps trajectories, NA coupling, FTs, pure-dephasing, ACF, and electron–hole recombination dynamics in the spin-down channel (Figure S8 and Table S3). The obtained data agree well with the results in the spin-up channel (Figure 6). The above simulations demonstrate that changing the magnetic ordering can effectively prolong the carrier lifetime in LaFeO3 perovskite.
In summary, we have investigated the effects of magnetic ordering on hot carrier relaxation and electron–hole recombination using ab initio nonadiabatic (NA) molecular dynamics combined with time-domain density functional simulations. The simulations demonstrate that magnetic ordering has a significant influence on the hot carrier relaxation and charge recombination dynamics in LaFeO3 perovskite. In all systems, the hot carrier relaxations are significantly faster than the charge recombination process, because the NA coupling between electronic states participating in the former is stronger than that in the latter. Importantly, both hot carrier and charge recombination are longest in the A-AFM system compared to other systems. This is because the A-AFM system has the weakest nonadiabatic coupling, which is the major factor determining charge carrier relaxation and recombination rate. Our simulations suggest that magnetic ordering can act as a valuable factor in the performance of perovskite oxidates, providing design principles for prolonging the charge carrier lifetime and enhancing photocatalytic performance.

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. Three types of magnetic ordering in antiferromagnetic LaFeO3 perovskite. (a) E-AFM, (b) C-AFM, and (c) A-AFM.
Figure 2
Figure 2. Optimized geometries of LaFeO3 perovskites. (a) E-AFM, (b) C-AFM, and (c) A-AFM at 0 and 300 K. The green, light brown, and red balls represent La, Fe, and O atoms, respectively.
Figure 3
Figure 3. Spin-up projected densities of states (PDOS) and band structures of (a, d) E-AFM, (b, e) C-AFM, and (c, f) A-AFM. The Fermi level is set to zero. The PDOS of LaFeO3 with different magnetic ordering shows that VBM is mainly supported by the O and Fe orbitals and CBM is primarily formed by Fe orbitals. All three systems have direct band gaps at the Γ point.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Spin-up time evolution of the energy (a–c) and population (d–f) decay of hot electrons and holes in E-AFM (a, d), C-AFM (b, e), and A-AFM (c, f) systems.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Visualization of the spin-up averaged NA coupling between electronic states in the CB and VB for hot carrier relaxation in E-AFM (a, d), C-AFM (b, e), and A-AFM (c, f). The stronger NA coupling between electronic states, the faster hot energy, and carrier relaxation. The number 1 represents CBM or VBM, and the number 1 + N denotes the CBM + N or VBM – N.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
