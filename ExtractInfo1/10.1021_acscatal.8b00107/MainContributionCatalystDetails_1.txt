 Based on the document, this does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses computational modeling of propane dehydrogenation reactions on platinum catalysts, but does not present any specific experimental results for a new catalyst. Since it does not contain details about performance enhancements for a particular catalyst, I would output the following:
