The supplied document does not pertain to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation for converting propane to propylene. It discusses oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene, but the main focus is on comparing different process concepts rather than focusing on a specific catalyst material or enhancement. Since it does not meet the criteria for assessing a main scientific contribution for a catalyst for propane/oxidative propane dehydrogenation, I have indicated that it is not relevant.
