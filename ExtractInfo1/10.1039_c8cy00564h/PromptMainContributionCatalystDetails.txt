Catalytic function of VOx/Al2O3 for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane: support microstructure-dependent mass transfer and diffusion†
The intrinsic effect of the support microstructure on the catalytic function of VOx/Al2O3 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) was studied. The results of characterization indicate that similar vanadia species are supported on Al2O3 with different microstructures, but that the interactions between VOx and alumina are slightly modified. In this case, the microstructure-dependent catalytic function in the ODHP reaction is rigorously revealed. The flower-like morphology with non-compact and non-monolithic particles assembled as nanoribbons exhibits inter-particle stacking pores, which contribute to a severe extra-granular diffusion limitation (EGDL). The sphere-like morphology with compact and monolithic particles assembled as nanosheets possesses both inter-particle and intra-particle pores, which lead to a moderate EGDL. However, neither catalyst exhibits an intra-granular diffusion limitation (IGDL). Conversely, the bulk-like morphology with monolithic particles and without the assembly of secondary granules only exhibits intra-particle pores, which results in a slight EGDL and IGDL. Moreover, these two disturbances of diffusion can be excluded by means of controlling the reaction parameters. A comparison of the apparent and intrinsic kinetics, together with the structure–function relationship, determines that the EGDL might play an important role in influencing the ODHP efficiency. An in situ FT-IR study shows that the adsorption-activation of propane and that of propylene proceed via different initial intermediates and transformation processes. The former initially involves surface propoxide species that will be transformed into aldehydic and ketonic intermediates at the reaction temperature. The latter directly involves π-allyl alkoxidic and σ-allyl aldehydic species, as well as vanadia-carboxylate species with a quasi-anhydride structure at ambient temperatures, at which these intermediates are prone to catalytic combustion.
1. Introduction
Propylene, as one of the most important petrochemicals and starting feedstocks, is used for the production of a wide variety of downstream products, including commodity and bulk chemicals. Currently, propylene is mainly produced together with other light olefins by naphtha steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of higher hydrocarbons, as well as the methanol to olefin (MTO) process.1–3 However, with the depletion of crude oil and the growth of the polypropylene (PP) market, the production of propylene via the conventional paths could not meet the increasing demand. In addition, the shale gas revolution and the increase in the cumulative total of light alkanes are also driving the search for an alternative process for enhancing the production of propylene in a more economic manner.4 Propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is a purpose-built technology for the production of propylene and hydrogen, has been successfully implemented in industrial processes in the form of the UOP-licensed Oleflex™ and KBR-licensed Superflex™ technologies.5,6 In general, commercial catalysts used for direct dehydrogenation are based on either chromium oxide or platinum.7–9 However, the endothermic reaction (ΔH298 = +29.7 kcal mol−1) in the PDH process requires a high operating temperature to achieve a considerable yield of propylene,10 which suffers from serious thermal cracking to generate lower alkanes and a carbon deposit, which results in rapid deactivation of the catalyst. In addition, the use of a noble metal makes the cost of propylene very high, and chromium is associated with serious environmental pollution.
In this respect, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), as a game-changing technology, represents a promising alternative process to close the growing gap between the demand for and the production of propylene, because the overall reaction is exothermic (ΔH298 = −28.3 kcal mol−1) and thermodynamically unrestricted at lower temperatures. Moreover, the addition of molecular oxygen could minimize the formation of coke deposits and enhance the durability of the catalyst.11,12 Most importantly, it is estimated that the potential energy savings from moving to ODHP would be approximately 45% of the energy consumption.13,14 Unfortunately, this process has not yet been implemented in a large-scale application, because several undesirable over-oxidation reactions result in a low yield of propylene at a moderate propane conversion.15 One main reason is the higher activation energy of the C–H bonds in the alkane in comparison with those in the alkene, which results in rapid sequential oxidation of the alkene at the temperatures required for activation of the C–H bonds in the alkane.16 Hence, a potent driving force has compelled us to develop a highly selective catalyst and an optimized reaction process for ODHP in order to avoid catalytic combustion.
Thus far, of the catalysts reported for the ODHP reaction, vanadia,17 molybdena,18,19 chromium oxide,20 and gallium oxide21 supported on a metal oxide such as SiO2,22 ZrO2,23,24 MgO,25–28 Al2O3,29 TiO2,30 Nb2O5 31 and Bi2O3 32 have been extensively investigated. In addition, heteroatom-doped nanocarbon materials as metal-free catalysts have also been approved for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions.33–35 More recently, the ODHP reaction has even been introduced into the realm of boron nitride5,36,37 and metal–organic frameworks.10,38 Of these, it is commonly accepted that vanadia is one of the most promising catalyst systems for the ODHP reaction owing to the favourable redox properties of its oxidation states of V3+, V4+, and V5+.17,39–41 Moreover, the activity and the selectivity toward the formation of propylene are highly dependent not only on the nature of the active species (e.g., monovanadates, polyvanadates, and V2O5 crystallites) but also on the identity of the support.22,42–44 Research efforts aimed at the relationship between the nature of dispersed vanadia and its catalytic function have revealed that the initial vanadia species are present as V5+ on the fresh catalyst surface before the reaction45–47 and then undergo subsequent reduction and reoxidation by the alkane and oxygen, respectively, to form a mixture of vanadia species (III, IV and V), where the extent of reoxidation depends on the reaction temperature. In general, the reoxidation of V3+ to V5+ cannot be completely achieved at temperatures of less than 673 K, as reported in a previous study.40 It is therefore accepted that both V5+ and V4+ might be active sites for the activation of propane, and the redox cycle between V5+ and V4+via one-electron transfer is more preferred for the ODHP reaction.39–41
Typically, it is well known that the heterogeneous catalytic ODHP reaction includes adsorption, surface reaction and desorption. The resulting catalytic performance (activity and selectivity) is necessarily related to the distribution of active species and the mass transfer and diffusion of reactants and products. In view of the support effect, the crystal morphology is deemed to be a key factor in determining the catalytic function, because in many cases the morphology not only enables active sites to be well tailored without changes in the composition of the support, but also offers an accessible opportunity to intensify mass transfer and diffusion by means of pore architecture engineering. It necessitates, therefore, an understanding of the correlation between the support morphology and catalytic function via an insight into mass transfer and diffusion, as well as kinetics.44,48 In recent years, much significant effort has been focused on the synthesis of Al2O3 supports with different morphologies owing to its excellent mechanical and chemical stability, as well as wide variety of applications in heterogeneous catalysis.49,50 For example, Lu et al.51 reported that a nanosheet-like Al2O3 support contained abundant and well-dispersed pentacoordinate Al3+, which stabilized Pt–Sn species as a result of strong interactions between the metal and the support. Moreover, sheet-like nanoarchitectures could facilitate the kinetic transfer process. Wang et al.52,53 demonstrated this when nanoflake-like Al2O3 was used to support FexOy clusters and CeO2–ZrO2, respectively. It was found that the flake-like nanoarchitecture possessed abundant surface oxygen vacancies and slit-shaped pores, which contributed to the high dispersion of the active phase and enhanced the catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene.
On the basis of the abovementioned analysis, it is concluded that the identity and morphology of the catalyst support are the key points for optimizing the ODHP reaction. In this contribution, which is a continuation of our previous work on a vanadium-based catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of a light alkane,54 we aim to achieve a fundamental understanding of the intrinsic effect of the support microstructure on the catalytic function of VOx/Al2O3 in the ODHP reaction. Hopefully, the knowledge gained from this work would not only lay the foundation for further study of the intrinsic kinetics and mechanism of the ODHP reaction but also provide several reference parameters for the rational design and re-engineering of tailor-made vanadium-based catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
All reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and were used without further purification. Aluminium nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O) was purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Urea (CO(NH2)2) was purchased from Tianjin Tianli Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Ammonium metavanadate and glucose were purchased from Tianjin Fuchen Chemical Reagent Factory. All the gases, including C3H8 (99.9%), O2 (99.7%) and N2 (99.999%), were provided by Xi'an Longteng Chemical Co., Ltd.
2.2 Preparation of support
Flower-like particles of Al2O3 were synthesized by a solvothermal method. A typical procedure was as follows: 18.75 g Al(NO3)3·9H2O and 6 g CO(NH2)2 were dissolved in 100 mL and 30 mL deionized water, respectively. Subsequently, the aqueous solution of urea was dropped into the aluminum nitrate solution. The mixed solution was transferred into a 200 mL autoclave with a Teflon liner, which was sealed and heated at 200 °C for 24 h. The solid sample that was obtained was filtered, washed several times with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried at 60 °C for 24 h. Finally, the as-synthesized flower-like Al2O3 was calcined at 500 °C for 5 h with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 and denoted as F-Al2O3.
Sphere-like particles of Al2O3 were synthesized by a solvothermal method. Typically, 7.5 g Al(NO3)3·9H2O was dissolved in 40 mL deionized water and stirred until the solution was homogeneous. Subsequently, 5.0 g glucose was added to the solution. The mixed solution was transferred into a 100 mL autoclave with a Teflon liner, which was sealed and heated at 180 °C for 20 h. The solid sample that was obtained was centrifuged, washed several times with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried at 80 °C for 3 h. Finally, the as-synthesized sphere-like Al2O3 was calcined at 500 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 and denoted as S-Al2O3.
Bulk-like particles of Al2O3 were prepared by a direct roasting method. Specifically, 36.75 g Al(NO3)3·9H2O was dissolved in 50 mL absolute ethanol, and 8.82 g CO(NH2)2 was dissolved in 40 mL deionized water. Subsequently, the aqueous solution of urea was dropped into the aluminum nitrate solution. The mixed solution was stirred until it became a sol and was then transferred into a crucible to be roasted with an induction cooker. White solid particles were obtained and named as B-Al2O3.
2.3 Preparation of catalysts
All catalysts were prepared via an incipient wetness impregnation method. Typically, NH4VO3 was dissolved in an aqueous solution of oxalic acid (molar ratio: NH4VO3/oxalic acid = 1/2), which was then heated and stirred until it was clear. The as-synthesized Al2O3 supports with different morphologies were impregnated with the NH4VO3 solution at room temperature for 24 h. The vanadium loading of 5 wt% was determined according to the weight ratio of V/Al2O3. After impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 80 °C for 12 h and then calcined at 550 °C for 6 h (heating rate of 2 °C min−1). The catalysts that were prepared were named as 5V-M-Al2O3, where M represents the morphology of the support (F for flower, S for sphere and B for bulk).
2.4 Characterization of catalysts
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed in the 2θ range between 10° and 85° using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer employing monochromated Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA). The samples were scanned with a step size of 0.02° and a counting time of 0.2 s per step. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded with a Bel Sorp-Max analyzer (Bel Japan, Inc.) at −196 °C. The as-synthesized Al2O3 supports and catalysts were outgassed at 300 °C for 8 h. The surface areas were estimated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method using data from the adsorption branches. The total pore volumes were determined from the amount of adsorbed N2 at a partial pressure of P/P0 = 0.99. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of samples were obtained using a Hitachi SU-8020 field emission scanning electron microscope. H2-TPR experiments were carried out using a Micromeritics Autochem 2920 apparatus with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). After being charged with about 50 mg of the catalyst, the system was purged at 500 °C in an argon flow for 1 h. Then, the gas was switched to 10 vol% H2 in Ar with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1, and H2-TPR was started at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 up to 800 °C. The water generated during the reduction was retained by an isopropanol-liquid nitrogen cold trap (−80 °C).
Raman spectra of all catalysts were recorded under anhydrous conditions at ambient temperature using a LabRAM HR spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) equipped with both UV (λ = 325 nm) and visible (λ = 532 nm) excitation lines (Ar-ion laser). Because an in situ cell in UV mode is not allowed at elevated temperatures, UV Raman measurements were performed in quasi-in situ conditions, namely, by conducting pretreatment of the sample via calcination in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for 6 h. Subsequently, the sample was transferred into the cell immediately for Raman analysis. In situ visible Raman measurements were carried out with an in situ cell. Before a measurement, the sample was heated at 550 °C for 6 h to desorb surface condensed moisture and then cooled to ambient temperature to record an enhanced Raman signal.
In situ UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) were recorded in the range of 200–800 nm with a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer and a praying mantis cell made by Harrick using BaSO4 as a reference. All catalysts were previously diluted with BaSO4 in the same weight ratio (mBaSO4 : mcat = 5 : 1) and pretreated at 550 °C for 6 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 in accordance with the conditions used for preparation of the catalysts. After treatment, inert N2 was immediately introduced into the in situ cell with a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 to attain a pristine state of the catalyst surface and for cooling. All spectra were recorded at ambient temperature owing to an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio. The absorption edge energy (Eg) was determined using Tauc's relationship by finding the x-intercept of a straight line fitted through the low-energy rise in the near-edge region of a plot of [F(R∞) × hν]1/2 against hν on the basis of the procedure used for amorphous semiconductors with indirect electronic transitions, where F(R∞) is the so-called Kubelka–Munk or remission function and hν is the energy of the incident photons.55,56
Solid-state MAS NMR experiments were performed with a Bruker Avance III 400 MHz spectrometer. In situ FT-IR experiments were conducted using a Bruker Tensor 27 infrared spectrometer equipped with a home-made quartz cell with CaF2 windows. Two major adsorption-activation experiments were performed with propane and propylene as the feed gas, respectively. Initially, all the catalysts were pretreated at 470 °C under continuous evacuation for 0.5 h and cooled to ambient temperature to record a background spectrum. Typically, the adsorption-activation experiments included the following steps: (1) introducing C3H8 into the sample cell at ambient temperature and holding for 10 min; (2) introducing oxygen into the sample cell at ambient temperature and holding for 10 min; (3) increasing the temperature to 470 °C, holding for 10 min, and cooling to ambient temperature; and (4) evacuating the resulting sample at ambient temperature. The spectrum for every step was recorded under vacuum conditions at ambient temperature.
2.5 Catalytic assessment
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane was performed in a laboratory-scale continuous-flow fixed-bed reactor (stainless steel tubular reactor with an i.d. of 8 mm and a length of 300 mm) at atmospheric pressure. The corresponding process flowchart is shown in Scheme S1.† The feed gases, which consisted of a mixture of C3H8/O2/N2 in a molar ratio of 1/2/7, were fed by mass flow controllers. The reactor was equipped with a coaxial thermocouple for measuring the temperature in the catalyst bed. Typically, to avoid hot spots and equalize the temperature gradient inside the catalyst bed, 0.1 g of the catalyst (40–60 mesh) was diluted with 0.5 g of quartz powder (40–60 mesh) and loaded into the reactor. The flow rates of C3H8, O2 and N2 were set at 8, 16 and 56 mL min−1, respectively, which resulted in a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 9.43 g gcat−1 h−1 based on the propane flow rate under conditions of standard temperature and pressure (STP). To achieve different levels of propane conversion, the WHSV was varied from 2.36 to 14.14 g gcat−1 h−1 at a constant temperature, and the reaction temperature was varied in the range of 470–560 °C at a constant WHSV. Analysis of all hydrocarbon compounds was carried out with an on-line gas chromatograph (GC-9560, Shanghai Huaai Chromatographic Analysis Corp., Ltd.) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and an HP-AL/KCL column (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.2 μm), whereas CH4, CO, CO2, N2 and O2 were separated by a TDX carbon molecular sieve column and analyzed by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
2.6 Definitions
In the present work, all quantitative analyses that were performed were based on the relationship of the carbon balance. Specifically, a series of basic parameters involved in characterization of the catalysts, reaction conditions and catalytic performance, such as the surface density (SD), weight hourly space velocity (WHSV, g g−1 h−1), propane conversion, selectivity for propylene, propane consumption rate (h−1), propylene formation rate (h−1), surface specific activity (TOF × 1023, molC3H8 V−1 h−1) and space–time yield (STY, g g−1 h−1), are defined in detail, as described in the ESI.†
3. Results
3.1 Characterization of supports
The morphology and textural properties of the as-synthesized Al2O3 supports were characterized by SEM, XRD, and N2 adsorption–desorption, as shown in Fig. 1. SEM images show that the method of solvothermal crystallization in an aqueous solution of urea generated flower-like Al2O3 (Fig. 1a), and the aqueous solution of glucose formed sphere-like Al2O3 with a diameter of 25 μm (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, the sol precursor obtained from the mixture of the ethanolic solution of aluminium nitrate and the aqueous solution of urea after calcination yielded bulk-like Al2O3 (Fig. 1c). From the XRD patterns (Fig. 1d), it is observed that F-Al2O3 and S-Al2O3 possessed relatively higher crystallinity than B-Al2O3 and exhibited a series of characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ = 32°, 37°, 39°, 46°, 61° and 67°, which correspond to the (220), (311), (222), (400), (511) and (440) planes of the γ-Al2O3 phase, respectively. However, peaks due to the (220), (311), (222), (400) and (511) lattice planes are extremely weak or even not observed for the B-Al2O3 support, which generally indicates a high degree of disorder of Al(iii).51,57 The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm curves (Fig. 1e) of all the as-synthesized Al2O3 supports display mixed type I/IV isotherms with different hysteresis loops, which indicates the presence of different pore architectures. The corresponding parameters of the textural properties were further quantified and are summarized in Table 1.

3.2 Characterization of catalysts
Initially, all the catalysts (5V-M-Al2O3) with the same vanadium loading (5 wt%) were characterized by XRD and N2 adsorption–desorption, as shown in Fig. 2. With the given loading, only the diffraction peaks of the γ-Al2O3 phase were detected for all the catalysts (Fig. 2a), which suggests a high dispersion of the vanadia species on the Al2O3 surface and the absence of separate bulky V2O5 crystals. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm curves (Fig. 2b) show that all the catalysts retained the original type of isotherm and shape of the hysteresis loop, which is indicative of retention of the inherent microstructure. In comparison with the pristine supports, there were slight changes in textural properties (e.g., surface area, pore volume and size) for all the catalysts. In view of the effect of the calcination temperature (Fig. S1 and Table S1†), it can be concluded that the changes in textural properties should be ascribed to both the impregnation process and the increase in the calcination temperature. In addition, it seems that such changes are related to the morphology of the support. Furthermore, to determine the vanadium coverage, the surface densities of the catalysts were calculated and are listed in Table 1. For all the catalysts, the surface density was similar at a vanadium loading of 5 wt%, i.e., 3.2 V nm−2 for the 5V-F-Al2O3 catalyst, 4.2 V nm−2 for the 5V-S-Al2O3 catalyst, and 3.2 V nm−2 for the 5V-B-Al2O3 catalyst. According to previous works,22,29,58 below monolayer coverage (<8 V nm−2) a supported VOx phase is generally present as monomeric and/or oligomeric vanadia species.

Considering that a surface vanadia phase supported on alumina materials (hydrophilic oxide surface) is readily solvated by moisture, which has been systematically studied by Wachs et al.,59–61 it is therefore necessary to conduct Raman spectroscopic characterization in anhydrous conditions. In addition, it is generally established that UV Raman spectroscopy is more sensitive to isolated and less highly polymerized VOx species, whereas visible Raman spectroscopy has higher sensitivity to bulky V2O5 crystallites.62–64 As a consequence, to study the nature of the surface VOx species, UV and visible Raman spectra were recorded, as shown in Fig. 3. As observed in the UV Raman spectra of all the catalysts excited by a 325 nm line (Fig. 3a), the bands at 1021 cm−1 can be attributed to the symmetric stretching mode of terminal vanadyl groups (short VO bonds) in tetrahedral and non-polymeric mono-oxo VO4 species with three V–O–S (S = support) bonds and one VO bond.17,22,60,65–67 In addition, the broad Raman features at 800–930 cm−1 are conventionally assigned to the stretching vibrations of bridging V–O–V linkages in oligomeric vanadia species62,68–72 and/or interface modes (V–O–Al), according to DFT calculations on the VOx/Al2O3 system.62,73 It is striking to note that the characteristic bands of V2O5 crystallites at 994 cm−1 are not detected in the UV Raman spectra, which is possibly due to the lower sensitivity of the UV source. In this regard, visible-excited (λ = 532 nm) Raman spectra were also recorded (Fig. 3b) and display very weak bands at 994 cm−1, which suggests the presence of a tiny amount of V2O5 crystallites. Moreover, the characteristic bands of terminal vanadyl groups are also observed but at different Raman shifts owing to a selective resonance enhancement effect, which has been observed in previous works by Wu and Stair.62,68

UV-vis DRS characterization is generally employed to provide information about the dispersion and degree of polymerization, as well as the local coordination geometry of surface vanadia species.74Fig. 4 shows the in situ UV-vis DRS spectra of the 5V-M-Al2O3 catalysts under anhydrous conditions. Clearly, in the case of all the catalysts it is found that there is a broader and unresolved band in the range of 200–500 nm. After multiple peak fitting, a set of absorption bands due to ligand (oxygen)-to-metal (vanadium) charge transfer (LMCT) at 222, 243, 325, 385 and 532 nm can be observed (Fig. 4a–c). Specifically, the bands at 222 and 243 nm can be attributed to two different kinds of isolated vanadium sites that are tetrahedrally coordinated and strongly and less strongly distorted, respectively.75,76 The bands at 325 and 385 nm are generally ascribed to low-oligomeric species in either tetrahedral or octahedral coordination environments, as reported in the previous literature.46,62,65 In addition, it is noted that there is an extremely weak band at 532 nm, which indicates the presence of V2O5 crystallites but in negligible quantities, as evidenced by the XRD and Raman results. On the other hand, it is well established that the absorption edge energy (Eg) can provide a more convenient description of the electronic properties and degree of aggregation of vanadium oxide species.22,55,77Fig. 4d shows the Eg values calculated from the UV-vis DRS spectra of 2.41, 2.54 and 2.46 eV, which correspond to the 5V-F-Al2O3, 5V-S-Al2O3 and 5V-B-Al2O3 catalysts, respectively, and suggest that these catalysts have similar degrees of polymerization of vanadium. In general, the Eg value for O2− → V5+ LMCT is in the region of 2–4 eV and decreases with an increase in the degree of polymerization78,79 or under anhydrous conditions.55 Moreover, previous studies have revealed that an absorption edge energy of greater than 2.5 eV is attributable to V5+ in a distorted tetrahedral coordination environment, and an Eg value of less than 2 eV is typically ascribed to V2O5 crystallites.29,56,80 Thus, it is determined that monomeric and oligomeric vanadia are the predominant species, with almost no V2O5 crystallites.

To better understand the interactions between surface vanadia species and the Al2O3 support, these catalysts were characterized by H2-TPR and 27Al MAS NMR, as shown in Fig. 5. The H2-TPR profiles (Fig. 5a) show that these catalysts exhibited only one broad peak with the maximum reduction temperature (Tmax) in the range of 468–482 °C, which indicated comparable reducibility. By analogy with previous studies,65,76,81 this low-temperature peak can be attributed to the reduction of monomeric and oligomeric VOx species in tetrahedral coordination geometries. This result is in good agreement with the aforementioned spectroscopic characterization and is indicative of similar dispersions of vanadium in all the catalysts. In addition, it is interesting to note that the reduction temperature of 5V-F-Al2O3 was slightly lower than those of the 5V-S-Al2O3 and 5V-B-Al2O3 catalysts. To discover the intrinsic reason, these catalysts were further characterized by 27Al MAS NMR. Specifically, the F-Al2O3 support gave rise to peaks due to two characteristic Al species at isotropic chemical shifts of 9.6 ppm and 66.7 ppm (Fig. 5b), respectively, which corresponded to octahedral and tetrahedral coordination geometries. For the S-Al2O3 (Fig. 5c) and B-Al2O3 (Fig. 5d) supports, however, it is interesting to note that there was an additional resonance signal at an isotropic chemical shift of 36.1 ppm, which was attributed to unsaturated Al(iii) cations with pentahedral coordination geometries. In general, such unsaturated pentacoordinate sites are formed on the external surface owing to dehydration and dehydroxylation at elevated temperatures and play a positive role in anchoring the active phase (e.g., noble metal or clusters) and maintaining catalytic stability.51,82,83 It is thus assumed that there is a relatively stronger interaction between vanadium atoms and unsaturated pentacoordinate Al(iii) sites, as evidenced by the reduction peak at higher temperatures.

3.3 Catalytic function
All the catalysts prepared using the Al2O3 supports with various morphologies were assessed in the ODHP reaction. The effects of the reaction temperature and WHSV on the initial propane conversion, selectivity and space-time yield (STY) of propylene are compared in Fig. 6. In the case of all the catalysts, an elevated reaction temperature in the ODHP reaction can enhance the propane conversion, but at the cost of decreasing the selectivity for propylene (Fig. 6a). Notably, it seems that these catalysts exhibited comparable propane conversion levels in the selected range of reaction temperatures (470–560 °C). Nevertheless, upon making a close observation of the selectivity and STY of propylene, it is found that the dependence on the support morphology is related to the reaction temperature. Typically, the 5V-B-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited a higher selectivity and STY of propylene above 470 °C, in comparison with the 5V-F-Al2O3 and 5V-S-Al2O3 catalysts. In addition, it is striking to note that every catalyst gave rise to a slow increase in the STY of propylene with an increase in the reaction temperature (Fig. 6b). In particular, the highest STY of propylene (1.47 g gcat−1 h−1) was obtained over the 5V-B-Al2O3 catalyst at 560 °C. Moreover, the STY value reached a maximum and almost remained unchanged when the reaction temperature was above 530 °C.

Subsequently, the effect of the WHSV on the ODHP reaction was further studied at the optimized temperature of 530 °C, as shown in Fig. 6c and d. As expected, the effect of the WHSV on catalytic performance in the ODHP reaction was closely related to the support morphology. Specifically, it is observed that a low WHSV (below 4.72 g gcat−1 h−1) resulted in a high propane conversion over the 5V-F-Al2O3 catalyst, but with an inferior selectivity for propylene. Moreover, the conversion decreased and the selectivity increased with an increase in the WHSV, which was probably due to the short residence time on the catalyst surface at a high WHSV. In contrast, this catalytic behaviour was not observed for the 5V-B-Al2O3 catalyst, because the propane conversion and selectivity for propylene were not dependent on the variations in the WHSV. Interestingly, the catalytic behaviour of the 5V-S-Al2O3 catalyst was similar to that of the 5V-B-Al2O3 catalyst at a low WHSV (2.36–9.43 g gcat−1 h−1) but was similar to that of the 5V-F-Al2O3 catalyst at a high WHSV (9.43–14.14 g gcat−1 h−1). On the other hand, it was found that there was a linear increase in the STY of propylene over all the catalysts with an increase in the WHSV, especially over the 5V-B-Al2O3 catalyst. As a result, the highest STY of propylene over the 5V-B-Al2O3 catalyst increased to 2.23 g gcat−1 h−1 at the highest WHSV (14.14 g gcat−1 h−1). With regard to the product distribution (Fig. S2†), a carbon balance of almost 100% was observed, which indicated that there was no formation of coke deposits. Moreover, the results for the catalytic stability at a time on stream of 75 h show that all the catalysts displayed relatively stable propane conversion and selectivity for propylene (Fig. S3†), which indicated long-term stability and no deactivation.
3.4 Diffusion behaviour
To elucidate differences in catalytic performance, a study of the diffusion behaviour of these catalysts was performed. To begin with, the effect of extra-granular diffusion limitation (EGDL) was investigated by varying the weight of the catalyst (W) and the flow rate (F) of the feedstock simultaneously. The propane conversion was plotted as a function of W/F, as shown in Fig. 7a–c. In the case of the low-flow-rate region, it is clearly observed that there was a severe disturbance of extra-granular diffusion for every catalyst, especially for the 5V-F-Al2O3 catalyst, followed by 5V-S-Al2O3 and 5V-B-Al2O3. With an increase in the flow rate, however, a change in W/F gave rise to a slight effect on the propane conversion, which indicated a decrease in EGDL. In particular, it is noted that in the range of W/F values from 0.008 to 0.017 g min mL−1, EGDL was completely eliminated for the 5V-B-Al2O3 catalyst and was slight for the 5V-S-Al2O3 catalyst. On the other hand, intra-granular diffusion limitation (IGDL) was studied by means of altering the granule size of the catalysts from 20–40 to 60–80 mesh (Fig. 7d). Specifically, in the cases of the 5V-F-Al2O3 and 5V-S-Al2O3 catalysts there was almost no influence on the propane conversion with a decrease or increase in granule size, which suggested that no IGDL occurred. However, dependence of the propane conversion on the granule size was observed for the 5V-B-Al2O3 catalyst, which implied the presence of IGDL. Notably, the catalyst with a larger particle size (20–40 mesh) contributed to a lower propane conversion because of unfavourable mass transfer and diffusion within long channels. Nonetheless, IGDL for the 5V-B-Al2O3 catalyst was completely removed when the granule size of the catalyst was decreased to the range from 40–60 to 60–80 mesh.
Fig. 7 Diffusion behaviour in the ODHP reaction over the 5V-M-Al2O3 catalysts: (a)–(c) extra-granular diffusion, reaction conditions: mcat = 0.1 or 0.2 g, F = 2–16 mL min−1, T = 530 °C, TOS = 1 h and (d) intra-granular diffusion, reaction conditions: mcat = 0.1 g with different mesh sizes, T = 530 °C, WHSV = 9.43 g gcat−1 h−1, TOS = 1 h).
3.5 In situ FT-IR study
Several mechanistic sequences toward irreversible steps in the activation of C–H bonds on surface VOx species have been proposed for the ODHP reaction.84,85 To offer an insight into the mechanism of the ODHP reaction, in situ FT-IR spectroscopy for the adsorption-activation of propane and propylene was conducted for the 5V-M-Al2O3 catalysts. The corresponding spectra are shown in Fig. 8. The IR spectra of the pristine catalysts before adsorption-activation were also recorded for reference. In the case of the adsorption of propane at ambient temperature, bands in the region of 2800–2975 cm−1 and at 1388 cm−1, which are attributed to stretching vibrations of aliphatic C–H bonds and deformation vibrations of methyl groups in physisorbed propane molecules, can be observed for all the catalysts. In addition, the broader peaks with a symmetric shoulder with a center at 1463 cm−1 are attributed to propoxide species, with the formation of σ-bonds between the most active hydrogen atoms in propane and surface oxygen sites in vanadia.86 After the introduction of molecular oxygen, there was no change in the spectra, which indicated that the above adsorption process can be triggered by surface oxygen species in catalysts at ambient temperature. At an elevated temperature of 470 °C, there are a set of characteristic peaks in the region of 3010–3100 cm−1 and at 1637 cm−1, which are assigned to stretching vibrations of C–H and CC bonds, respectively, in an unsaturated hydrocarbon with sp2 hybridization. Moreover, it is observed that the intensity of the peaks centered at 1463 cm−1 decreased significantly, which indicated the transformation of propoxide species. In addition, weak bands at 1662 and 1714 cm−1 could be observed, which were assigned to σ-allyl aldehydic species and carbonyl intermediates. On the other hand, the typical bands of CO2 molecules at 2335 and 2365 cm−1 started to appear, which suggested the over-oxidation of propane and/or propylene. After evacuation, characteristic peaks of chemisorbed surface intermediate species were sporadically observed, but those of propane almost disappeared because propane could barely be strongly chemisorbed on the catalyst surface.
Fig. 8 In situ FT-IR spectra recorded for the adsorption/activation of propane (top) and propylene (bottom) on the 5V-M-Al2O3 catalysts. Experimental items: (E-1) pristine catalyst with pretreatment at 470 °C under vacuum conditions, (E-2) introduction of propane and adsorption at ambient temperature, (E-3) introduction of oxygen and adsorption at ambient temperature, (E-4) surface reaction at an elevated temperature of 470 °C, and (E-5) evacuation at ambient temperature.
For the adsorption of propylene at ambient temperature, characteristic peaks in the regions of 2800–2975 and 3010–3100 cm−1 assigned to stretching vibrations of –C–H and C–H bonds, respectively, and bands at 1444 and 1637 cm−1 due to C–H in-plane deformation and CC stretching vibrations, respectively, can be clearly observed because of the physisorption of propylene. In addition, the bands at 1473 and 1662 cm−1 might be associated with stretching vibrations of C–C bonds in surface intermediates (π-allyl alkoxide species and σ-allyl aldehydic species).87 Interestingly, it is noteworthy that two additional bands with low intensity at 1810 and 1837 cm−1 are visible, which are usually attributed to anhydride-type species containing a carbonyl group. It is hence tentatively speculated that this intermediate might be a sort of vanadia-carboxylate with a quasi-anhydride group. Similarly, it is also confirmed that surface oxygen species in the catalysts are able to trigger the formation of these intermediate species in the absence of molecular oxygen. Upon an increase in temperature to 470 °C, it is noted that the intensity of the characteristic peaks of propylene and surface intermediates decreased, whereas the typical bands of CO2 molecules appeared with very high intensity. Moreover, the new band at 1714 cm−1 was also observed at elevated temperatures, which might be attributed to carbonyl intermediates derived from the transformation of alkoxide or vanadia-carboxylate species. Upon evacuation, all physisorbed propylene molecules were removed completely from the catalyst surface, but the chemisorbed intermediate species that contained a carbonyl group remained on the catalyst surface.
4. Discussion
4.1 Structure–function relationship
The structural and textural characterizations reveal that these catalysts have a distinct microstructure. Typically, the 5V-F-Al2O3 catalyst displayed a pronounced H3 hysteresis loop and a rapid increase in the amount of N2 adsorbed in the region of P/P0 = 0.80–1.00, which are usually ascribed to the filling of inter-particle stacking pores. The 5V-S-Al2O3 catalyst displayed a mixed H2/H3 hysteresis loop, which indicated the presence of both inter-particle pores and intra-particle pores. However, the 5V-B-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited a characteristic H2 hysteresis loop in the range of 0.5 < P/P0 <1.0, which suggested the presence of intra-particle pores alone. In combination with the results of SEM characterization, it was determined that the flower-like morphology was formed by the assembly of nanoribbons, as reflected by the non-compact and non-monolithic particles. The sphere-like morphology with compact and monolithic particles was assembled as nanosheets. Conversely, the bulk-like morphology is an inherent monolithic structure without the assembly of secondary granules. As a result, it is proposed that the morphological features and pore architecture are mainly responsible for EGDL and IGDL, respectively.
With regard to the surface active species, it is commonly accepted that VOx species can be present on an alumina support in three distinct forms, which typically include monomeric vanadia at a low surface density (<2.3 V nm−2) and oligomeric and polymeric forms at an intermediate surface density (2.3–7.5 V nm−2), as well as crystalline V2O5 at a high surface density (>8 V nm−2).22,29,58 In combination with the results of spectroscopic characterization, it can be concluded that the surface species in all the catalysts predominantly consisted of monomeric and oligomeric vanadia at the present surface density (3.2–4.2 V nm−2). In addition, it can also be concluded that there was a certain extent of interaction between vanadia and the alumina supports, as evidenced by the formation of V–O–Al linkages. As a consequence, it is therefore assumed that these catalysts (5V-M-Al2O3) could to some extent be modeled as similar surface active species supported on Al2O3 with different microstructures, as illustrated in Fig. 9.
Fig. 9 Models of 5V-M-Al2O3 catalysts with similar surface active species and different microstructures proposed on the basis of fundamental characterization.
To better understand the dependence on the intrinsic microstructure, the selectivity for propylene determined by means of varying the reaction temperature and WHSV was plotted as a function of the propane conversion, as shown in Fig. 10. It is clearly seen that in the case of a variation in temperature the selectivity for propylene decreased with an increase in the propane conversion for all the catalysts (Fig. 10a), because propylene exhibits a higher affinity for and higher reactivity with most surfaces than propane, where the readsorption and reoxidation of the propylene formed on the catalyst surface limit the selectivity. This observation is in good agreement with previous reports.46,65,66,88–90 On the other hand, upon a variation in the WHSV (Fig. 10b) it is noted that the relationship between the selectivity for propylene and the propane conversion exhibited a totally different behaviour. Specifically, the 5V-F-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited a gradual decline in the selectivity for propylene with an increase in the propane conversion. The 5V-S-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited a volcano curve with a maximum selectivity value. However, it is interesting to note that the selectivity for propylene was almost independent of the propane conversion for the 5V-B-Al2O3 catalyst. Therefore, it can be concluded that the 5V-B-Al2O3 catalyst is more active and selective, as demonstrated by the higher conversion and selectivity.
Fig. 10 Variation in the selectivity for propylene as a function of the propane conversion: reaction conditions: (a) mcat = 0.1 g, WHSV = 9.43 g gcat−1 h−1, T = 470–560 °C, TOS = 1 h and (b) mcat = 0.1 g, WHSV = 2.36–14.14 g gcat−1 h−1, T = 530 °C, TOS = 1 h.
Considering the aforementioned diffusion behaviour, it is well established that the 5V-F-Al2O3 and 5V-S-Al2O3 catalysts experienced a relatively strong and slight EGDL, respectively, under the present reaction conditions (green squares in Fig. 7a and b). However, neither of them experienced an IGDL (Fig. 7d). For the 5V-B-Al2O3 catalyst, both EGDL and IGDL can be excluded under the present reaction conditions (green squares in Fig. 7c and d). By correlating the microstructures of these catalysts, it is thus concluded that the 5V-F-Al2O3 catalyst with a non-compact and non-monolithic architecture and inter-particle stacking pores contributes to EGDL but could avoid IGDL. In contrast, the bulk-like morphology (5V-B-Al2O3) with a monolithic architecture and intra-particle pores experiences IGDL but without EGDL. Thus, it seems that a non-compact and non-monolithic architecture assembled as secondary granules is more accessible and suffers from extra-granular mass transfer resistance, whereas an inherent monolithic architecture without the assembly of secondary granules could mitigate extra-granular mass transfer resistance. In addition, intra-particle pores are liable to experience intra-granular mass transfer resistance. As a result, it is reasonable to expect that the sphere-like morphology (5V-S-Al2O3) with a compact and monolithic architecture that bears both inter-particle pores and intra-particle pores is liable to suffer from both EGDL and IGDL. However, IGDL has not yet been observed, which is probably because of the favourable large diameter of the mesopores (8.8 nm, Table 1) and short channels within thin nanosheets. Actually, this assumption can be supported by an investigation of adsorption equilibrium in the diffusion of light hydrocarbons, as reported by Grande and Rodrigues.65,91 They demonstrated that the diffusion of propane and propylene in narrow pores with an average pore diameter of 4.4 nm was mainly controlled by Knudsen diffusion. Therefore, it is assumed that EGDL might play a considerable role in determining the catalytic function of these catalysts in ODHP.
Taking the surface active species into account, the surface specific activities (per V atom) of these catalysts in the ODHP reaction, which were expressed as the turnover frequency (TOF × 10,23 molC3H8 V−1 h−1), were quantified at the given reaction temperature (530 °C) and WHSV (9.43 g gcat−1 h−1), as shown in Fig. 11a. Considering that the surface density of vanadium (3.2–4.2 V nm−2) was less than the theoretical monolayer density (<8 V nm−2), it is thus assumed that almost all the V atoms were exposed on the external surface and were accessible for participation in the ODHP reaction. Specifically, equal TOF values were observed for all the catalysts, which indicated that monomeric and oligomeric vanadia species exhibit almost the same catalytic activity in the ODHP reaction, which is in good agreement with previous reports.58 In addition, it can be further concluded that tiny V2O5 particles with smaller sizes make a negligible contribution to the catalytic activity. As a result, the microstructure of the support is the only, or at least the most important, factor that influences the ODHP efficiency. On the other hand, it is interesting to note that the temperature-sensitive regions of plots showing the dependence on the microstructure of the rate of consumption of propane and rate of formation of propylene are contrasting (Fig. 11b and c); the former occurs at low temperatures, whereas the latter occurs at high temperatures, respectively. Specifically, it is observed that the rate of consumption of propane follows the order 5V-F-Al2O3 > 5V-S-Al2O3 > 5V-B-Al2O3 at lower temperatures and finally reaches a maximum with similar levels at higher temperatures. In contrast, the rate of formation of propylene is almost the same at lower temperatures but finally follows the order 5V-B-Al2O3 > 5V-S-Al2O3 > 5V-F-Al2O3 at higher temperatures. Notably, the present reaction conditions, in the cases of all the catalysts, excluded IGDL. By correlation with the order of the extent of the disturbance of extra-granular diffusion (5V-F-Al2O3 > 5V-S-Al2O3 > 5V-B-Al2O3), it is thus assumed that a given catalyst with a higher external mass transfer resistance at a lower temperature makes desorption of the propane reactant more difficult, which results in a long residence time and a higher conversion. However, the given catalyst without, or with a lower, external mass transfer resistance at a higher temperature contributes to favourable desorption of the propylene product or intermediates, which avoids deep oxidation and facilitates the formation of propylene.
Fig. 11 Catalytic activity and kinetic profiles of the ODHP reaction over the 5V-M-Al2O3 catalysts (40–60 mesh): (a) turnover frequency, (b) rate of propane consumption, (c) rate of propylene formation, and (d) Arrhenius plot of initial rates.
It is well established that the rate of the ODHP reaction over a vanadium-based catalyst is proportional to the partial pressure of propane and independent of the partial pressure of O2 when H2O is not added to the C3H8/O2 feed gases, as reported previously.19,24,92 Therefore, the kinetic rate equation for the overall reactions in the ODHP process can be expressed as eqn 1:
rC3H8consumption = k[PC3H8]1[PO2]0 (1)
On the basis of the Arrhenius relationship, the apparent activation energies (Ea) of the ODHP reaction over the 5V-M-Al2O3 catalysts were calculated, as shown in Fig. 11d. As expected, the apparent Ea values of the ODHP reaction over the 5V-F-Al2O3 and 5V-S-Al2O3 catalysts are 52.0 and 67.6 kJ mol−1, respectively, which are lower than that (Ea = 75.1 kJ mol−1) for the 5V-B-Al2O3 catalyst. As noted above, both extra-granular and intra-granular diffusion limitations for the 5V-B-Al2O3 catalyst can be definitely excluded under the given reaction conditions. As a result, it is concluded that the Ea values that were determined should be derived from the intrinsic kinetics without disturbances of mass transfer and diffusion. In this respect, it is further confirmed that the 5V-F-Al2O3 and 5V-S-Al2O3 catalysts experience EGDL at different levels, which results in a decrease in the apparent value of Ea.
4.2 Mechanistic insight into adsorption and activation
The in situ FT-IR results strongly support the fact that the adsorption-activation of propane and that of propylene involve different initial intermediates and transformation processes, as illustrated in Scheme 1. Specifically, the propane/catalyst interaction occurs via the extraction of the most active hydrogen atom from propane, which gives rise, as the first surface intermediate, to the corresponding propoxide species. Upon an increase in the reaction temperature, these surface alkoxide species are transformed into aldehydic and ketonic intermediates. At the same time, the dehydrogenation product (propylene) and combustion products (CO2 and H2O) are generated by partial oxidation and over-oxidation, respectively. Distinctively, the detectable surface intermediates involved in the adsorption-activation of propylene directly involve π-allyl alkoxidic and σ-allyl aldehydic species, as well as vanadia-carboxylate species with a quasi-anhydride structure, at ambient temperature. Furthermore, the surface species that have a higher ability to be activated tend to be transformed into combustion products, together with carbonyl intermediates that are strongly chemisorbed on the catalyst surface. On the other hand, it is confirmed that surface oxygen species in the catalysts are able to trigger the formation of these intermediates for both propane and propylene. The role of molecular oxygen is to supplement the surface oxygen species and enable the redox cycle, as proposed in the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism.86,93 To some extent, it seems fully evident that the formation of CO2via the over-oxidation of propylene is easier than that from propane, which indicates that the energies of the C–H bonds in the alkane are higher in comparison with those of the C–H bonds in the alkene.

5. Conclusions
In summary, a set of supported vanadia catalysts using Al2O3 with different microstructures were synthesized via an incipient wetness impregnation method. Systematic studies involving spectroscopic characterization, reactivity, kinetics, diffusion behaviour and the surface intermediates involved in the adsorption/activation of propane and propylene provided an insight into the intrinsic effect of the microstructure of the support on the catalytic function of VOx/Al2O3 in the ODHP reaction. It appears that a bulk-like morphology with compact and monolithic particles and without the assembly of secondary granules, which possesses only intra-particle pores, is favourable for avoiding disturbances of mass transfer, which contributes to enhanced catalytic performance in the ODHP reaction. In addition, it is found that the adsorption-activation of propane and that of propylene involve different initial intermediates and transformation processes. The propane/catalyst interaction proceeds via surface propoxide species, which could be further transformed into aldehydic and ketonic intermediates at elevated temperatures, together with propylene and combustion products. The surface intermediates involved in the adsorption-activation of propylene directly include π-allyl alkoxidic and σ-allyl aldehydic species, as well as vanadia-carboxylate species with a quasi-anhydride structure at ambient temperature, at which these intermediates are prone to catalytic combustion. More importantly, the knowledge gained from this work could lay the foundations for further study of the intrinsic kinetics and mechanism of the ODHP reaction and provide several reference parameters for the rational design and re-engineering of tailor-made vanadium-based catalysts.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
