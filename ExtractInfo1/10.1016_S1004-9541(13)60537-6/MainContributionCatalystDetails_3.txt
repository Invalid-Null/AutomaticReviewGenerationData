The provided document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The abstract indicates it is studying isobutane dehydrogenation over a commercial Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. While this is related to dehydrogenation processes, it is not focused on conversion of propane to propylene. Therefore, I have indicated this document is not directly relevant to the analysis requested.
