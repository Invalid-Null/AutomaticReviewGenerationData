The supplied document discusses propane dehydrogenation catalysts, but does not provide any specific details about improvements in conversion, selectivity, or stability of a particular catalyst. The document focuses on computational screening and analysis of hypothetical 3N-coordinated single atom catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. While it provides useful insights into understanding catalyst design principles, it does not present experimental results demonstrating enhanced performance of a real catalyst. Therefore, I cannot extract details on any specific performance enhancements of an actual catalyst as requested.
