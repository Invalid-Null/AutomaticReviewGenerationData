The document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation for converting propane to propylene. It focuses on time-gated Raman spectroscopy as an analytical technique to study coke formation on propane dehydrogenation catalysts. No specific catalyst design or performance enhancements for propane dehydrogenation are presented as the main scientific contribution.
