The given document discusses the development of H2-selective SiO2 membranes for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide details on a specific catalyst that represents a main scientific contribution for enhancing propane dehydrogenation performance. The focus is on the membrane development and testing. Since the document does not contain information about a catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, I have indicated that it is not relevant in the XML output.
