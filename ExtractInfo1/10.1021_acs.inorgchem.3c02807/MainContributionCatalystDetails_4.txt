 Based on the information provided in the document, this does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses a catalyst based on ruthenium nanoclusters anchored on nitrogen-doped porous carbon for hydrogen evolution reaction, which is not directly related to converting propane to propylene. Since propane dehydrogenation is not discussed, I cannot extract the requested details about the catalyst performance, feed composition, etc.
