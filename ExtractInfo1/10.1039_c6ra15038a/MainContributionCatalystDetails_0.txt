The supplied document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation to propylene. It focuses on dehydrogenation of propane to propyl species, not complete dehydrogenation to propylene. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) to produce propylene.
