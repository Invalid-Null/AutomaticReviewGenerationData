Development of a Rapid, Targeted LC-IM-MS Method for Anabolic Steroids
Abstract
Anabolic steroids are of high biological interest due to their involvement in human development and disease progression. Additionally, they are banned in sport due to their performance-enhancing characteristics. Analytical challenges associated with their measurement stem from structural heterogeneity, poor ionization efficiency, and low natural abundance. Their importance in a variety of clinically relevant assays has prompted the consideration of integrating ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) into existing LC-MS assays, due primarily to its speed and structure-based separation capability. Herein we have optimized a rapid (2 min) targeted LC-IM-MS method for the detection and quantification of 40 anabolic steroids and their metabolites. First, a steroid-specific calibrant mixture was developed to cover the full range of retention time, mobility, and accurate mass. Importantly, this use of this calibrant mixture provided robust and reproducible measurements based on collision cross section (CCS) with interday reproducibility of <0.5%. Furthermore, the combined separation power of LC coupled to IM provided comprehensive differentiation of isomers/isobars within 6 different isobaric groups. Multiplexed IM acquisition also provided improved limits of detection, which were well below 1 ng/mL in almost all compounds measured. This method was also capable of steroid profiling, providing quantitative ratios (e.g., testosterone/epitestosterone, androsterone/etiocholanolone, etc.). Lastly, phase II steroid metabolites were probed in lieu of hydrolysis to demonstrate the ability to separate those analytes and provide information beyond total steroid concentration. This method has tremendous potential for rapid analysis of steroid profiles in human urine spanning a variety of applications from developmental disorders to doping in sport.

Introduction

Ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) has emerged over the past decade as a promising technique for the analysis of steroidal compounds in a variety of applications. (1) Early examples included primarily targeted analysis focused on one or a few compounds, including work involving testosterone and epitestosterone glucuronides, (2) separation of derivatized endogenous isomer pairs, (3) development of a targeted clinical assay for five endogenous compounds with differential mobility (DMS), (4) and differentiation of anabolic steroid isomers via dimerization. (5,6) As technology has improved, the ability to simultaneously monitor dozens of compounds has enabled more significant biomedical research. (7,8) The basis for these measurements is the rotationally averaged ion-neutral collision cross section (CCS), a characteristic property of an ion measured under given experimental parameters. Several groups have endeavored to create broad CCS libraries, (9,10) and even some more focused databases focused on steroid compounds. (6,11−15) These values can provide tremendous value in identification and structural characterization. But, importantly, the widespread measurement of this parameter has shed light on the importance of standardizing CCS across different instrumental platforms such as drift tube, traveling wave, and trapped (TIMS) ion mobility systems. (16−18)
Steroids, as a broadly defined molecular class, have seen significant interest in the IM-MS community in recent years. Dodds and Baker recently demonstrated the benefits of implementing IM-MS in a newborn screening assay for congenital adrenal hyperplasia, focusing primarily on separation of endogenous isomers such as 17-hydroxyprogesterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone. (19) Bile acids comprise a structurally challenging subclass, due to the presence of numerous hydroxyl group positional and stereochemical isomers, but further incorporation of complementary computational modeling could assist in identification. (20) IM-MS has even seen utility in identifying steroids in food safety applications. (21−23) Other steroid subclasses that have been profiled using IM-MS have included vitamin D metabolites, (24) glucorocorticoids, (11) and serum estrogens. (25)
Another area of high interest is the analysis of anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) in sport doping. Each year, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) publishes its Prohibited List (26) which explicitly names dozens of substances (within several classes) and methods which are prohibited, either in-competition or at all times. In the most recent version (2023), Class S1: Anabolic Agents names 65 AAS compounds, as well as “other substances with a similar chemical structure or similar biological effect(s).” That class also includes other anabolic agents, such as selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs). Because of the sensitivity and selectivity required for analysis of these substances in complex biological matrixes (e.g., urine, plasma, etc.), the added separation dimension of IM-MS is attractive. These benefits are well outlined in a two-part series of research articles by Guillarme and co-workers. (14,27) The first part revealed development of UHPLC-IM-HRMS for nearly 200 doping agents including several anabolic steroids, glucocorticoids, and their metabolites. They demonstrate good intraday, interday, and interweek relative standard deviation (RSD) (≤2%), for the CCS measurement of all compounds. Importantly, they also demonstrate good separation of isomeric/isobaric species and the ability to reduce interferences by IM filtering. (14) To supplement the annual Prohibited List, the Thevis group also publishes its Annual Banned Substances Report (28) which outlines the most recent analytical advances in sports drug testing programs, organized by class in parallel with the Prohibited List. This report especially highlighted recent work by our group, in which Velosa et al. demonstrated improved selectivity by incorporating CCS measurement with an LC-IM-MS method. (12) This initial testing procedure (ITP) provided qualitative analysis of 26 AAS, with resolution of sodiated isobaric species. Nevertheless, the structural similarity of many compounds (i.e., stereoisomers) and poor ionization efficiency necessitated derivatization by 1,1-carbonyldiimidazole and Girard’s Reagent P, respectively. (29) More recently, Bressan et al. published CCS values for over 100 steroids (conjugated/unconjugated), demonstrating <2% standard deviation for all compounds in matrix. Importantly, they observed trends in CCS based on structural differences (i.e., conjugation position or α/β stereochemistry) that could be helpful in identification of future unknowns. (13) The present work aims to develop a rapid, targeted LC-IM-MS method that can be used to simultaneously separate and quantify prohibited anabolic steroids and their metabolites in complex mixtures.

Chemicals and Reagents
All steroids were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI) as powders and prepared as 1 mg/mL stock solutions in acetonitrile. Working standards for standardization of the steroid-specific calibrant mixture were prepared in 50/50 water/methanol. Individual steroid standards and mixtures of isomer/isobar groups were spiked into pooled human urine (see the Supporting Information) at concentrations ranging from 10 pg/mL to 1 μg/mL (as indicated). Water (0.1% formic acid) and methanol were Fisher Scientific Optima LC-MS grade (Pittsburgh, PA).
Instrumentation and Tuning
All analyses were performed using an Agilent Technologies 6560 IM-QTOF instrument coupled to a 1290 Infinity II UHPLC (Santa Clara, CA). Samples were injected (1 μL) onto an Agilent ZORBAX Extend-C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 1.8 μm) maintained at 50 °C. Mobile phase A was water (0.1% formic acid), and mobile phase B was methanol. The flow rate was maintained at 0.500 mL/min over a two min gradient with the following conditions: 0.00 min −60% B; 0.50 min −60% B; 1.00 min −100% B; 1.50 min −100% B; 1.51 min −60% B. Ionization was performed using an Agilent Jet Stream (AJS) dual ESI source operated in positive mode. The instrument was operated in low mass mode (m/z 100–1700). Multiplexed acquisition (4-bit) was enabled for all LC-IM-MS measurements, which allowed for a maximum ion funnel trap fill time of 2500 μs (for 40 ms max drift time) and release time of 150 μs. All IM measurements were made in nitrogen drift gas maintained at approximately 3.95 Torr and 25 °C with a uniform field strength of 18.6 V/cm. Other relevant instrument parameters can be found in Table S1. The single-field method (described elsewhere) was used for measuring DTCCSN2 by calculating slope (β) and y-intercept (tfix) based on the Agilent Tune Mix ions. (18)
Data Processing and Analysis
Simple data visualization was achieved using Agilent MassHunter IM-MS Browser 10.0. All raw data was first preprocessed using the PNNL PreProcessor (version 4.0 2022.02.18) (30) to smooth (interpolating 3:1 drift bins) and demultiplex. Preprocessed data was then uploaded to Agilent Mass Profiler for feature finding. High-resolution demultiplexing (when used) was performed using the Agilent HRdm 2.0 software. (31) Targeted quantitative analysis was performed using Agilent Mass Profiler and Qualitative Analysis software to determine the integrated peak area under a chromatographic peak, which was extracted based on both m/z and drift time.

Development of a Steroid-Specific Calibrant Mixture
The first step in our targeted method optimization was to develop an anabolic steroid-specific calibrant mixture. The major goal of this mixture was to provide for retention time and ion mobility quality control (and alignment as necessary). Furthermore, we envision this mixture being used for any future nondrift tube-based measurements (i.e., traveling wave-based) to properly calibrate for CCS; this is especially important because of the systematic bias that has previously been reported for steroids with traveling wave-based instruments. The compounds were selected to span the full retention time, drift time, and m/z range expected for the target anabolic steroids (Table 1). To demonstrate reproducibility, this mixture was analyzed in triplicate daily for a week to assess intra- and interday error in retention time, collision cross section (CCS), and m/z; the latter two values were measured for both protonated and sodiated species (when detected); however, all quantitative analyses were performed using the most abundant species (as indicated in the subsequent discussion). Retention times were reproducible with intra- and interday relative standard deviation ≤2% for all compounds. Mass measurements were also reproducible with mass error consistently below 5 ppm. Lastly, CCS measurements were reproducible with intra- and interday relative standard deviation ≤0.4% for all compounds. The combination of these robust values was used to create extracted ion chromatograms that could be used for quantitative measurements based on peak area. All reproducibility plots (i.e., CCS standard deviation vs analysis day) are included in the Supporting Information.

aThe values demonstrate the mean and standard deviation for measurements made (daily triplicate) over a week. The most abundant ion for each steroid was subsequently used for quantitative studies. All CCS measurements were achieved by using the single-field method. Standards were prepared in 50/50 water/methanol.
Development of a 2 min Chromatographic Gradient
In an effort to develop a method more amenable to high-throughput (i.e., clinical) assays, we endeavored to optimize a 2 min gradient capable of providing qualitative separations (via a combination of LC and IM) and quantitative performance (e.g., sufficient points across a peak). This method was in contrast to our previous work with a 10 min gradient. Optimization of IM-MS acquisition parameters was imperative for maximizing both duty cycles and points across a chromatographic peak. The former parameter was optimized primarily through the use of multiplexed acquisition, which involves injection of multiple ion packets (specifically 8 injections for 4-bit acquisition) within a single IM frame. With a maximum ion trapping time of 2500 μs in a 40 ms IM frame, the duty cycle approaches 50%. Optimizing points across a chromatographic peak is dependent on average chromatographic peak width; for this 2 min method peaks were on average 4–8 s baseline width (Figure 1A). As such, with the goal of producing 10+ points across each peak, conditions of 7 IM transients/frame resulted in 3.1 frames/second. This did indeed provide 10+ points across each peak, such as demonstrated for nandrolone, which shows 15+ points (Figure 1B).

(B) The optimized IM-MS acquisition parameters allowed for 15+ points across the chromatographic peak for nandrolone to optimize quantitative performance. Standards were prepared in 50/50 water/methanol.
Targeted Multidimensional Separations of Isomers
One of the major challenges in steroidomics is the presence of numerous isomers, both endogenous and synthetic. We combined the power of our 2D LC-IM separations to effectively differentiate multiple compounds within each isomer class. For example, we analyzed boldenone (C19H26O2) and three additional isomers (1-androstenedione, androstenedione, and methyldienolone) and demonstrated that our simple chromatographic method could separate out boldenone and 1-androstenedione with retention times of 0.80 and 1.10 min, respectively (Figure 2A). However, androstenedione and methyldienolone were observed to chromatographically coelute. The extracted mobility plots (Figure 2B–D) for the sodiated species at m/z 307 showed unique CCS for boldenone and 1-androstenedione, but more importantly, they yielded resolution of the coeluting isomers, with androstenedione and methyldienolone CCS measuring at 196.3 and 197.6 Å2, respectively. The incorporation of the high-resolution demultiplexing (HRdm) algorithm was especially important for separation of androstenedione and methyldienolone, which differ structurally by an additional C9 carbon–carbon double bond and C17 methyl group (for methyldienolone). Their CCS differs by only ∼0.7%, which is nearly baseline resolved with HRdm processing.
Figure 2
Figure 2. (A) Extracted ion chromatogram of the isomers of boldenone. The extracted mobility plots for (B) boldenone, (C) androstenedione and methyldienolone, and (D) 1-androstenedione provided an additional measure of separation, especially in the case of coelution. Standards were prepared either individually as a mixture, spiked into urine at 1 μg/mL, and extracted prior to analysis.
Isomers of testosterone (C19H28O2) comprise another challenging isomer class. In this instance, there were two chromatographic peaks for the mixture (Figure 3A) that corresponded to two pairs of coeluting isomers. Testosterone and methylnortestosterone coeluted at 1.05 min, but their protonated species at m/z 289 (which yielded comparable abundance to the sodiated species) resulted in clear mobility separation with measured CCS of 172.5 and 173.9 Å2, respectively (Figure 3B). Similarly, 1-testosterone and epitestosterone coeluted at 1.20 min, but their sodiated species at m/z 311 resulted in mobility separation with measured CCS of 196.7 and 197.5 Å2, respectively (Figure 3C). HRdm was again useful for separating these coeluting isomer pairs, with ΔCCS of 0.8% and 0.4%, respectively.
Figure 3
Figure 3. (A) Extracted ion chromatogram of the isomers of testosterone. The extracted mobility plots for (B) testosterone and Methylnortestosterone and (C) 1-testosterone and epitestosterone provided an additional measure of separation, especially in the case of coelution. Standards were prepared either individually as a mixture, spiked into urine at 1 μg/mL, and extracted prior to analysis.
Isomers of methyltestosterone (C20H30O2) were another class of compounds that required dual LC-IM separation to differentiate. In this instance, there were three chromatographic peaks for the mixture (Figure 4A). 7-Keto DHEA (RT 0.45 min) and methyltestosterone (RT 0.15 min) were well resolved from the other species and yielded CCS measurements of 196.2 and 201.4 Å2, respectively (Figure 4B,C). The third chromatographic peak at 1.25 min corresponded to coeluting methyl-1-testosterone and norethandrolone, but fortunately their sodiated species at m/z 325 resulted in clear mobility separation with measured CCS of 202.1 and 202.9 Å2, respectively (Figure 4D).
Figure 4
Figure 4. (A) Extracted ion chromatogram for the isomers of methyltestosterone. The extracted mobility plots for (B) 7-keto DHEA, (C) methyltestosterone, and (D) methyl-1-testosterone and norethandrolone provided an additional measure of separation, especially in the case of coelution. Standards were prepared either individually as a mixture, spiked into urine at 1 μg/mL, and extracted prior to analysis.
Overall, there were a total of 41 WADA-prohibited anabolic steroids/metabolites. Aside from the three isomer groups already discussed, there were three additional groups of isobaric species: androsterone, epiandrosterone, 4-androstenediol, and 5-androstenediol (C19H30O2); 7α-hydroxy DHEA (C19H28O3), methandriol, mestanolone, drostanolone, and mesterolone (C20H30O2); and methylclostebol (C20H29ClO2) and fluoxymesterone (C20H29FO3). Using a combination of LC, IM, and MS these isobars could be well separated in the developed two minute method. Measurements for retention time, CCS, and m/z for all species are included in Table S2. The single-field method (described elsewhere) was used for measuring DTCCSN2 by calculating slope (β) and y-intercept (tfix) based on the Agilent Tune Mix ions; (18) however, we further demonstrated the class-independence of single-field drift tube-based CCS measurements by also calibrating based on developed steroid calibrant mix and observed similar CCS values with ΔCCS generally within 0.6% (Table S3). When future TW-based measurements are made (i.e., via SLIM-based IM platforms), we expect that the steroid-specific calibrant mixture will provide more accurate CCS measurements.
Analysis of Phase II Metabolites
These anabolic steroids are typically metabolized to create polar Phase II metabolites for excretion via urine, resulting in a combination of free steroids (i.e., free testosterone) and conjugated steroids (i.e., testosterone glucuronide, testosterone sulfate, etc.). Historically, these species have been enzymatically hydrolyzed to measure the total steroid concentration (i.e., total testosterone) using GC-MS. However, the advances in LC have provided the potential to separate and analyze those intact conjugated metabolites, thus providing a more comprehensive picture of steroid concentrations. To demonstrate this capability, we analyzed intact conjugated steroid isomers, specifically testosterone, epitestosterone, and 4-dehydroboldenone glucuronides. The most abundant peak observed for each was the [M + Na]+ species at m/z 487.234. Despite their increased polarity, they were able to be adequately retained and well separated with our 2 min LC method (Figure 5A). More importantly, where IM separation of their unconjugated counterparts is tremendously challenging, glucuronide addition resulted in baseline resolution without any additional data processing, resulting in CCS measurements for testosterone, epitestosterone, and 4-dehydroboldenone glucuronides of 231.7, 212.1, and 214.6 Å2, respectively (Figure 5B).

(A) Extracted ion chromatogram, [M + Na]+ at m/z 487, for a mixture of 4-dehydroboldenone glucuronide (4DHB-Gluc), epitestosterone glucuronide (Epi-Gluc), and testosterone glucuronide (Test-Gluc). (B) These compounds can further be identified by their collision cross section (CCS). Standards were prepared individually, spiked into urine at a concentration of 1 μg/mL, and extracted prior to analysis.
Steroid Quantitative Analysis by LC-IM-MS
Using the previously developed 2 min LC-IM-MS method, we characterized the quantitative performance for several steroids (endogenously via standard addition or exogenously via direct spiking). Data were fully processed as described above (PNNL PreProcessor, feature finding by Mass Profiler, HRdm demultiplexing, and follow-up quantitative feature finding by Mass Profiler). Using the measured CCS and mass, we could measure the chromatographic peak area that was extracted directly from those parameters. We previously demonstrated (Figure 1B) that the points across a chromatographic peak (>10 points) was adequate for quantitative purposes; however, we also show in Figure S1A the number of points across a standard DT ion mobility peak, which is in excess of 25 points for an ion mobility peak with a baseline width of ∼1 ms. A similar representation of points across a mobility peak has been included in Figure S1B. This resulted in excellent sensitivity and limits of detection for epitestosterone (Figure 6A) and androstenedione (Figure 6B) of 183 and 90 pg/mL. For anabolic steroids, these values are considerably better than the minimum required performance level (MRPL) defined by WADA for these compounds, which is 2.5 ng/mL. (32) Other compounds quantified included testosterone (175 pg/mL) and stanozolol (84 pg/mL); the former value is a considerable improvement over previously reported values closer to 500 pg/mL12 due primarily to the quantitative performance associated with the low-mass mode and optimized IM-MS conditions. Steroid profiling, such as via the Athlete Biological Passport, (33) is another useful measure as an indication of administration of synthetic forms of endogenous anabolic androgenic steroids (EEAS). This is typically performed by quantitative ratio of several endogenous steroids including: (i) testosterone/epitestosterone, (ii) androsterone/epitestosterone, and (iii) androsterone/etiocholanolone. To demonstrate the utility of this, we also performed quantitation of these compounds in mixtures; this fully demonstrates the quantitative ability of the method because testosterone/epitestosterone must be separated chromatographically, androsterone/epitestosterone can be differentiated by mass, and androsterone/etiocholanolone must be separated by ion mobility. Overall, the ratio of these compounds (when present at 1:1 concentration) was consistent over the full concentration range down to 500 pg/mL.

Conclusion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In this work, we optimized a rapid (2 min) LC-IM-MS method focused on separation and quantification of anabolic steroids and their metabolites. We first developed a calibrant mixture containing nine anabolic steroids that collectively bracket the retention time, CCS, and m/z window for the target compounds collectively. We then demonstrated that even with the accelerated LC gradient, a combination of chromatographic- and ion-mobility-based separations were adequate to resolve multiple isomeric compounds in mixtures. Lastly, we showed the quantitative performance of this method (including for ratios of endogenous compounds that are relevant to doping), with limits of detection surpassing the required values. Overall, we expect that this method will have tremendous potential for targeted quantification of anabolic steroids in complex biological samples in a variety of applications.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
