CO2-Assisted propane aromatization over phosphorus-modified Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts†
Modification of HZSM-5 with phosphorus (P) and gallium (Ga) was found to enhance the activity of CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation and aromatization (CO2-ODA) of propane to liquid aromatics. Flow reactor studies measuring the simultaneous CO2 reduction and the CO2-ODA of propane were performed at 873 K at atmospheric pressure over unmodified HZSM-5 and P/Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts. At comparable propane conversion, HZSM-5 showed a high selectivity toward the undesired methane product (41.4%) with a relatively low selectivity toward aromatics (16.5%). In comparison, P/Ga/ZSM-5 demonstrated a significantly higher aromatics selectivity (42.3%) with a simultaneous reduction in methane selectivity (13.5%). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations identified the mechanisms for propane dehydrogenation and aromatization over P/Ga/ZSM-5 and the role of CO2. Cooperative with P, CO2 addition avoided the formation of molecular H2 and reduced the barriers for benzene formation, leading to an enhanced activity and selectivity to aromatics from CO2-ODA of propane over P/Ga/ZSM-5.
1 Introduction
Owing to the growing energy demand and increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, it is desirable to identify effective hydrocarbon transformation reactions in tandem with CO2 conversion. Research on direct transformation of light alkanes into aromatics has gained considerable importance because of its potential implementation in the production of liquid fuels from C2–C4 alkanes in shale gas.1–4 The catalytic conversion of propane into liquid aromatics with the assistance of CO2 provides opportunities to simultaneously reduce CO2 to CO and convert alkanes into value-added products.
Medium pore HZSM-5 zeolites have been identified to be active for propane aromatization but typically with low selectivity toward aromatics.5,6 The introduction of platinum (Pt) into the H-ZSM-5 zeolites considerably increased the activity for the aromatization of propane.7 However, this promoting effect of Pt was accompanied by the production of methane and ethane through hydrogenolysis of alkanes and of alkylaromatics, reducing the selectivity for the aromatics products. Zinc (Zn) or gallium (Ga) modified HZSM-5 catalysts were also investigated for propane to aromatics transformation, with the Zn or Ga promoters being introduced by incipient wetness impregnation,8–11 ion exchange,12–15 incorporation into the framework of the zeolite,16–20 or only physical mixing.21–24 The selectivity for aromatics was considerably improved as Zn or Ga was involved in the dehydrogenation of propane to produce alkenes that would undergo oligomerization, followed by cracking and cyclization reactions on the zeolite's Brønsted acid sites.25–27 Both Ga and Zn ions were reported to increase the aromatics selectivity by providing active sites for the removal of hydrogen adatoms as H2 molecules.28,29 However, hydrogen removal still limited the aromatization rate over the Zn or Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts. Recently, Zhou et al.30 used Pt and Fe to modify Zn/ZSM-5 to improve propane conversion and aromatics selectivity and concluded that the FePt bimetallic sites helped the [ZnOZn]2+ sites to release the strongly adsorbed atomic hydrogen. A common issue in the above-mentioned catalysts was that the activity of the Zn or Ga modified ZSM-5 catalysts decreased with time on stream because of the coking of catalysts.25,31–34 Guisnet et al.27 found that dispersed Ga facilitated the coke removal through oxidative treatment over Ga/HMFI. Samanta et al.35 reported that Pt-modified Ga/ZSM-5 deactivated slower than Ga/ZSM-5 because the presence of Pt facilitated hydrogen spillover, resulting in the hydrogenolysis of coke precursors. Yamauchi et al.36–38 reported that CO2 was reduced into CO by propane, concurrently converting propane as a reducing reagent into more valuable products such as aromatics. The results showed that CO2 suppressed the by-production of ethane and the deposition of coke in the aromatization of propane over the Zn/ZSM-5 catalysts. Furthermore, Ihm et al.39 compared the activity of propane aromatization without and with CO2 addition over Zn/ZSM-5, and found that CO2 could not only hinder the catalyst deactivation but also decreased the aromatics selectivity and propane conversion.
As reported in a recent work,40 modifying Ga/ZSM-5 with phosphorus (P) has resulted in an enhancement in hydrothermal stability and aromatics yields in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation and aromatization (CO2-ODA) of ethane. However, it is unclear whether such an enhancement can also be achieved for CO2-ODA of propane. Compared to ethane, propane could be more easily activated by protons and decomposed to methane and ethylene by protolytic C–C bond scission.41–43 Therefore, the selectivity control for CO2-ODA of propane should be more challenging than that of ethane. In the current study, propane aromatization was evaluated in a flow reactor with and without CO2 over P/Ga/ZSM-5, Ga/ZSM-5 and HZSM-5 to identify the synergy between P and CO2 during propane aromatization over P/Ga/ZSM-5. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to identify the reaction mechanisms and kinetically controlling steps of CO2-ODA of propane over P/Ga/ZSM-5.
2 Experimental methods
2.1 Experimental details
2.1.1 Catalyst preparation All the catalysts were synthesized with HZSM-5 containing a Si/Al molar ratio of 30 (sourced from Riogen Catalysis for Chemicals and Energy). P modification to produce P/ZSM-5 (with 0.8 wt% P) was achieved via a slurry technique by mixing the desired precursors at 313 K for 12 hours. The mixture of ethanol, water, and 85 wt% H3PO4 was sonicated for 10 min before combining with a paste of HZSM-5 (mixture of 7.20 g of HZSM-5 and 20 mL of H2O). The dried mixtures were then calcined at 823 K for 6 hours (5 K min−1 ramp). The incorporation of 2 wt% Ga to P/ZSM-5 was achieved via incipient wetness impregnation on 2.65 g of P/ZSM-5 with 0.28 g of Ga(NO3)3·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) diluted in 1180 mL of H2O. The mixture was dried overnight and was then calcined at 563 K for 2 hours (0.8 K min−1 ramp) to obtain P/Ga/ZSM-5. 2.1.2 Flow reactor studies The CO2-ODA of propane was studied in a flow reactor at atmospheric pressure and 873 K. A sample of 50 mg of 40–60 mesh catalyst was deposited in a 4 mm quartz tube. All the catalysts were pretreated with an activation period under Ar flow for 1 hour at 873 K (20 mL min−1, 9.6 K min−1 ramp) before being brought into contact with reaction gasses, followed by additional 14 hours of steady-state experiments. The reactant gas mixture (30 vol% C3H8 and 30 vol% CO2, balance Ar) was introduced with a total flow rate of 10 mL min−1. The gases were analyzed with an Agilent Technologies 6890N online gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID) with an HP Plot Q column. Argon was used as the inert internal standard to calculate the total flow rate and was the basis for quantification of product distributions. The apparent activation barrier and reaction order experiments were conducted under slightly different reaction conditions (see details in the corresponding figure captions) to minimize the effects of heat and mass transport by keeping the conversion of propane below 15%. 2.1.3 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments TGA experiments were conducted using a TA Instrument 8500 TGA. Approximately 12 mg of spent sample was placed onto a tared weighing pan. The spent catalyst was then subjected to a drying program in which it was ramped from room temperature to 473 K at 15 K min−1 and held at the temperature for 5 min in the presence of Ar (40 mL min−1). Then, the sample was heated to 1273 K with a 10 K min−1 ramp rate in the presence of O2 (20 mL min−1 each). 2.1.4 Characterization of catalysts The P/Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts were characterized and reported in detail in the previous study of CO2-ODA of ethane.40 In brief, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements revealed that the ZSM-5 crystalline structure was retained after the introduction of Ga and P. Results from X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) revealed the presence of both Ga3+ and Ga1+. The FTIR measurements of pyridine adsorption confirmed the presence of both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites in the P/Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts.
2.2 DFT details
2.2.1 Electronic structure methods Periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) with the ion cores described by projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials.44–46 The exchange and correlation energies were computed using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA).47 To consider dispersion interactions of zeolite systems, the PBE+D3 method was employed for all calculations.48,49 The valence electrons were expanded in a plane wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 400 eV. A Gaussian smearing with an electronic temperature of kBt = 0.02 eV was applied to achieve fast convergence. The atomic structures were optimized using a damped molecular dynamics method implemented in the VASP code until the forces on all atoms were less than 0.03 eV Å−1. Transition states were searched using the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method.50 The minimum energy pathway was examined by interpolating 8–14 images, including the initial and final states, during transition state optimization. Each transition state was confirmed to have a single imaginary vibrational frequency along the reaction coordinate.
The adsorption energy (Eads) of the adsorbate is defined by Eads = Eadsorbate-zeolite − Ezeolite − Eadsorbate, where Eadsorbate-zeolite represents the total energy of the adsorbed species with the zeolite catalyst, Ezeolite is the energy of the zeolite, and Eadsorbate is the energy of the adsorbate in the gas phase. A more negative Eads indicates a stronger adsorption interaction. The activation barrier (Eact) is defined by Eact = ETS − EIS, where ETS is the energy of the transition state, and EIS is the energy of the reactant associated with the elementary step. The reaction energy (Erxn) is defined by Erxn = EFS − EIS, where EFS represents the energy of the product associated with the elementary step.
2.2.2 Computational models The ZSM-5 zeolite model was constructed using a periodic MFI unit cell with an experimental lattice constant of 20.02 Å × 19.90 Å × 13.38 Å. The Γ-point was used for all calculations. In the literature, the T12 site located in the 10-membered ring channel was reported as the most favorable site for Al substitution in the framework of ZSM-5.51–55 The T12 site also provided sufficient space to be accessed easily by adsorbates at the intersection of the 10-membered ring and the zigzag channel of ZSM-5, and was a common choice for Al substitution in computational studies of adsorption and reaction with the ZSM-5 zeolite.56–60 Previous studies also identified the preferential location of Al at both sites T12 and T2 in the MFI framework, leading to the formation of Al-pairs (Al12–O–Si–O–Al2) that were identified to be energetically favored.52,61 Therefore, in this work, two Al atoms were introduced into the framework to substitute for two Si atoms located at the T12 and T2 sites. A protonic HZSM-5 zeolite was constructed by adding two protons onto the bridging O36 and O13 atoms of the –Si–O–Al– framework while for Ga/ZSM-5, the proton bound to O13 was replaced by a Ga atom. To examine whether the energetics was sensitive to the substituted sites of Al and the locations of Ga and proton, DFT calculations on the relative stabilities of different ZSM-5 models as well as the adsorption energies of propane on these catalyst models were performed. As illustrated in ESI† Fig. S1, although the Al pair sitting positions and locations of Ga and H impacted the structural stability of ZSM-5, the energy differences of these models were not significant (<0.2 eV). In addition, small differences (<0.1 eV) in the adsorption energies of propane were observed, and the T12–T2(Ga) model used in this work was relatively favorable for propane adsorption. With respect to P/Ga/ZSM-5, a H3PO4 species was introduced into the Ga/ZSM-5 pore, which interacted with both the Brønsted acid proton of the zeolite and framework O atoms by forming multiple hydrogen bonds. This species was also reported as the most possible structure of P species within the ZSM-5 pore in the literature.62,63 Due to the covering of the original Brønsted acid site of ZSM-5, a new weak Brønsted acid site was created within the H3PO4 species. The optimized structures of these zeolite models are illustrated in ESI† Fig. S2.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Flow reactor measurements
3.1.1 Steady-state catalytic activity over HZSM-5 and P/Ga/ZSM-5 with and without CO2 The conversion and product selectivity values obtained by averaging the data from 560–670 minutes on stream are listed in Table 1. In the absence of CO2, HZSM-5 was not a selective catalyst for propane aromatization. The direct dehydrogenation and aromatization (DDA) of propane exhibited product distributions with 71.5% cracking products (41.4% CH4 and 30.1% C2 products) and 16.5% liquid aromatics with a 35.8% propane conversion. Such poor aromatics selectivity indicated a facile scission of the C–C bonds of propane by the protonic sites over HZSM-5, producing more undesired methane product. Ga modification dramatically enhanced the aromatics selectivity and decreased the cracking activity. Propene became the dominant product with 41.7% selectivity and the aromatics selectivity also increased to 31.1%. In the absence of CO2, the P modification had no pronounced effect on the catalytic performance over Ga/ZSM-5 or HZSM-5.

a Values were obtained by averaging the data from 560–670 minutes on stream; selectivity was on a C3H8 basis (including carbonaceous species only). For catalysts containing modifiers, the Ga and P loadings were 2 wt% and 0.8 wt%, respectively, and the Si/Al molar ratio for all the catalysts was 30. Reaction conditions: C3H8 (3 mL min−1), CO2 (0/3 mL min−1) a total flow rate of 10 mL min−1 at 873 K with an Ar diluent (4 and 7 mL min−1, respectively), 50 mg of catalyst (40–60 mesh), except for DDA of propane over HZSM-5 using 20 mg HZSM-5 diluted with 30 mg SiO2 to achieve a comparable C3H8 conversion.
In the presence of CO2, the aromatics selectivity over HZSM-5 remained the same at 16.5% while propane conversion decreased. For Ga/ZSM-5, compared with that in the absence of CO2, both aromatics selectivity and propane conversion decreased. In comparison, the P/Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst showed a high aromatics selectivity (42.3%) and low methane selectivity (13.5%) in the presence of CO2, demonstrating its advantage in CO2-ODA of propane.
To better understand the catalytic behavior, the profiles of propane conversion and the production rates of CH4 and aromatics following time on stream with and without CO2 over HZSM-5 and P/Ga/ZSM-5 are compared in Fig. 1. The conversion of propane over HZSM-5 decreased significantly in the presence of CO2, which was accompanied by a decrease in the production rates of both methane and aromatics. In the case of P/Ga/ZSM-5, the presence of CO2 led to an increase in propane conversion and aromatics production while decreasing CH4. From the point of view of catalyst stability, HZSM-5 without CO2 demonstrated the least extent of deactivation among the catalysts under the reaction conditions in Fig. 1, although the production rate of aromatics over P/Ga/ZSM-5 remained to be higher than that over HZSM-5 after 10 hours on stream. The spent catalysts were characterized using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to determine the extent of coking, as shown in Table S1.† The weight loss, normalized by propane conversion, was much lower after P was incorporated into Ga/ZSM-5 either with or without CO2, suggesting that P had the capability to decrease coke formation.

Reaction conditions: C3H8 (3 mL min−1), CO2 (0 or 3 mL min−1) a total flow rate of 10 mL min−1 at 873 K with an Ar diluent (7 mL min−1 for DDA and 4 mL min−1 for CO2-ODA), 50 mg of catalyst (40–60 mesh), except for DDA over HZSM-5 using 20 mg HZSM-5 diluted with 30 mg SiO2 to achieve a comparable C3H8 conversion.
3.1.2 Kinetic studies over P/Ga/ZSM-5 Kinetic studies were performed to further understand the CO2-ODA of propane over the P/Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst. Kinetic measurements were performed under conditions with a propane conversion below 15% to minimize the effects of heat and mass transport, as shown in Fig. 2 and 3. When the concentration of propane vol% in the feed increased from 10% to 50%, the production rate of liquid aromatics (Fig. 2a) increased. However, it started to decrease slightly at a propane concentration of 60 vol%, suggesting that either CO2-derived or propane-derived intermediates likely competed for the active sites in aromatics formation at high concentrations of propane. In contrast, the production rate of aromatics remained nearly constant as the CO2 vol% increased from 10% to 60% (Fig. 2b), indicating that the concentration of adsorbed CO2 (or CO2-derived intermediates) either remained in surplus under these reaction conditions or they were occupying sites that were different from those for propane activation and aromatics formation.
Fig. 2 Effect of the vol% of reactant C3H8 (a) and CO2 (b) in the feed on the production rates of aromatics under CO2-ODA of propane. Reaction conditions: 823 K, 50 mg of catalyst (40–60 mesh), with a total flow rate of 30 mL min−1 by increasing one reactant content while maintaining the other constant (30 vol%). The total flow rate remained the same by varying the Ar diluent accordingly.
Fig. 3 Apparent activation energies derived by varying temperature over the P/Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst for C3H8 (a) and CO2 (b) activation, aromatics (c) and propene (d) production. Reaction conditions: varying the reaction temperature from 798 K to 823 K, with a total flow rate of 30 mL min−1 (C3H8 : CO2 : Ar = 1 : 1 : 4), 50 mg of catalyst (40–60 mesh).
The apparent activation energies were estimated by measuring production rates in the temperature range of 798–823 K over P/Ga/ZSM-5, as shown in Fig. 3. The apparent activation barrier for propane activation was estimated to be 112 ± 1 kJ mol−1, similar to the barrier for aromatics production (110 ± 2 kJ mol−1). Although the apparent activation barrier for the production of propene was slightly lower (98 ± 1 kJ mol−1), it suggested that propene formation was unlikely the rate-determining step. The apparent energy barrier for CO2 activation, 115 ± 7 kJ mol−1, was consistent with reported values of CO2 activation by metal/oxide interfacial sites in the literature, such as the value of 115 kJ mol−1 for CO2 activation at metal/CeO2 interfaces.64
3.2 Mechanistic studies from DFT calculations
Based on the experimental results, although modification of the HZSM-5 catalyst with Ga altered the product distribution to produce more propene (41.7%) and aromatics (31.1%), the promoting effect of CO2 was only achieved after the incorporation of P into Ga/ZSM-5, leading to a selectivity toward liquid aromatics of 42.3% with a lower methane selectivity of 13.5%. To understand the mechanism and kinetically controlling steps for CO2-ODA of propane over P/Ga/ZSM-5, DFT studies were conducted to investigate the energy pathways of propane dehydrogenation and aromatization in the absence and presence of CO2.
3.2.1 Propane dehydrogenation and aromatization over P/Ga/ZSM-5 On the basis of previous studies in the literature,65–68 the [GaH]2+ species was identified to be the active site for alkane dehydrogenation over Ga/ZSM-5 rather than the Brønsted acid site. The transfer of Brønsted acid H in H3PO4 species to the Ga site had a barrier of 1.24 eV and a reaction energy of 0.31 eV (Fig. S3†). The dehydrogenation of propane over P/Ga/ZSM-5 was investigated over the generated [GaH]2+ site. As illustrated in Fig. 4, three elementary steps were involved in propane dehydrogenation to propene, i.e. (1) dehydrogenation of C3H8, forming an –OH with the O of H3PO4, (2) H2 formation from H(O) and H(Ga), and (3) dehydrogenation of C3H7(Ga) to C3H6 coupled with the Brønsted acid site regeneration of H3PO4. The transition state configurations of the three elementary steps are included in Fig. 4, with the structures of the reactant, intermediates and product given in Fig. S4.† Both dehydrogenation steps had large barriers (1.66 and 1.76 eV for step (1) and (3), respectively), and the reaction energies were endothermic by 0.21 and 0.82 eV, respectively. The H2 formation from H(O) and H(Ga) had a lower barrier of 0.26 eV. The effective energy barrier of propane dehydrogenation to propane over P/Ga/ZSM-5 predicted from DFT was 2.00 eV (Fig. 4). For comparison, DFT calculations were also performed for propane conversion on HZSM-5. The details are provided in the ESI.† Over HZSM-5, propane cracking was found to be kinetically more favorable than its dehydrogenation to propene due to lower barriers, resulting in methane being the dominant product. The DFT calculations were consistent with the experimental results given in Table 1 that the selectivity to methane was higher than other products such as propene and aromatics over the HZSM-5 catalyst.

Since benzene was found to be the dominant product among the aromatics in the experimental measurements (Table 2), the energy pathways for propene transformation to benzene over P/Ga/ZSM-5 were calculated as an example of aromatization. The reaction energy diagram is plotted in Fig. 5 while the optimized structures of all states involved in the path are provided in Fig. S5.† Two propene molecules were adsorbed around the H3PO4 species inside the ZSM-5 pore, going through protonation, dehydrogenation, H2 formation, five membered ring (5MR) formation, ring-isomerization of 5MR to 6MR, and H transfer, eventually leading to benzene production. Three H2 formation steps were involved in benzene formation, which were all uphill in reaction energies, as shown in Fig. 5. As demonstrated in the previous work on ethane aromatization over Ga/ZSM-5 and P/Ga/ZSM-5,40 H2 formation reactions were found to have considerable barriers and would be slow steps in benzene formation. Therefore, the activation barriers of the three H2 formation steps associated with propene aromatization to benzene over P/Ga/ZSM-5 were calculated and the results are given in Fig. 6. The dehydrogenation of the C6H12 species and reaction with Ga(H) resulted in the first H2 formation, which had a barrier of 0.55 eV. However, the barriers of the subsequent C6H10 + Ga(H) → C6H9Ga + H2 and C6H8 + Ga(H) → C6H7Ga + H2 reactions were 2.07 and 2.31 eV, respectively, which were higher than the effective energy barrier (2.00 eV, Fig. 4) calculated for propane dehydrogenation to propene. These results indicated that propane dehydrogenation to propene should not be the rate-determining step, consistent with the experimental kinetic studies (Fig. 3). In the experimental results (Table 1), the promoting effect of CO2 for aromatics formation was only observed after the incorporation of P into Ga/ZSMP-5. In the literature, CO2 was considered to react with the produced hydrogen to form CO and H2O via the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction and acted as a weak oxidant in alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization.40,69–72 Therefore, identifying the role of CO2 in the H2 formation steps should be an important aspect for understanding the mechanism for CO2-assisted propane aromatization. The presence of CO2 may facilitate the reaction since the produced –H from dehydrogenation should be directly consumed through the RWGS, as discussed below.

3.2.2 Effect of CO2 on aromatics production over P/Ga/ZSM-5 In the presence of CO2, the reaction mechanism and kinetic barrier of dehydrogenation of C6H10 + Ga(H) and C6H8 + Ga(H) were examined since these two steps had large barriers and formed molecular H2 from dehydrogenation. The optimized structures of all transition states generated in these reactions are illustrated in Fig. 7 while the structures of reactants, intermediates and products are provided in Fig. S6.† The CO2 molecule was adsorbed around the H3PO4 species and reacted with the H of Ga(H) to form a COOH intermediate bound to the O atom of H3PO4. Then, the COOH dissociated into CO and OH(Ga) species. The reaction was completed by the transfer of H from C6H10 or C6H8 species to OH(Ga), generating a H2O molecule simultaneously. Thus, in the presence of CO2, the reaction mechanism was altered and the direct formation of molecular H2 was avoided. Most importantly, the kinetic barriers associated with the elementary steps in the presence of CO2 were decreased as compared to the case without CO2, as shown in Fig. 8. Although the DFT calculated energy barriers for individual elementary steps could not be directly compared to the experimentally measured apparent activation barriers, the trends predicted from DFT agreed well with the experimental results. The introduction of P not only modified the acid site strength but also tuned the pore structure of Ga/ZSM-5, thus influencing the stability of intermediates and transition states inside the pore. The promoting effect of P addition on aromatics production from propane was enhanced when CO2 was co-fed with propane, attributed to which the formation of the H2 molecule was circumvented and the kinetic barriers in benzene formation were reduced, demonstrating a synergy between P and CO2. These DFT results provided mechanistic insight into the understanding of the experimentally observed CO2-promoted aromatics production from propane over P/Ga/ZSM-5.

4 Conclusions
In summary, the P/Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibited promising activity and stability during the process of CO2-ODA of propane to produce liquid aromatics, demonstrating the feasibility to produce value-added liquid products from the inexpensive and abundant light alkane in shale gas while simultaneously mitigating a greenhouse gas. CO2 enhanced the dehydrogenation kinetics while P improved the stability and tuned the acidic properties, making P/Ga/ZSM-5 a promising catalyst for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation and aromatization of propane. Adding P should also influence the pore structure of ZSM-5, altering the formation and stability of intermediates and transition states. DFT calculations provided mechanistic insight into the understanding of the energetic pathways and kinetically controlling steps for aromatics production from propane over P/Ga/ZSM-5 and identified the important synergetic role between P and CO2 in promoting the selectivity toward aromatics.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
