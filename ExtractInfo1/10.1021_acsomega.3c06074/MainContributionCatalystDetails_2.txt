 Based on the content in the provided document, this does not appear to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The document focuses on studying the structure-activity relationships of human ether-Ã -go-go-related gene (hERG) blockers and their interactions with the hERG potassium ion channel using computational modeling approaches. It does not mention propane, propylene, PDH, or ODH. Therefore, I would output the following:
