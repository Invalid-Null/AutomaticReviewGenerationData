Enhanced propane dehydrogenation to propylene over zinc-promoted chromium catalysts
Direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an attractive technology for propylene production. We show here that propane conversion is significantly enhanced by the addition of ZnO to Cr2O3. Furthermore, its activity is strongly dependent on the Zn/Cr molar ratio and one with Zn/Cr = 0.3 gives the highest propane conversion and propylene selectivity among the studied ZnxCr catalysts (x denoting the molar ratio, 0–0.5). Characterization with X-ray diffraction, nitrogen physisorption, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, temperature-programmed reduction, temperature-programmed desorption, transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates that addition of zinc to Cr2O3 leads to formation of a spinel phase and reduction of the particle size, and hence forms more defect sites. The Arrhenius plots suggest that the apparent activation energy of the PDH reaction is significantly lowered over Zn0.3Cr.
Introduction
Propylene is an important and basic building block in the chemical industry, and is employed for the production of polymers, oxygenates and other chemical compounds.1–3 Currently, propylene is commercially manufactured by steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process.4–6 With the rapidly growing demand for propylene and the availability of large reserves of shale gas, direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene has become an attractive alternative process for production of propylene.7,8
Cr-Based catalysts have been extensively studied for the PDH reaction since the first report by Frey and Huppke.9 A wide range of Cr-based catalysts have been examined including Cr/Al2O3, Cr/SiO2, and Cr/ZrO2.10–12 De Rossi et al. reported highly selective Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/SiO2 catalysts for PDH in the temperature range of 723–823 K. However, these catalysts underwent a deactivation process with time on stream and their activity was still low.11 For the most frequently studied Cr/Al2O3 catalyst, its selectivity needs to be improved due to the side reactions such as cracking and coking over the surface acid sites of Al2O3, hence leading to reduced propane conversion and propylene selectivity. Therefore, great efforts have been made to improve the performance of the Cr/Al2O3 catalyst by use of different promoters, preparation methods and support materials.13,14 Fujdala et al. synthesized Cr/Si/Al/O and Cr/Si/Zr/O catalysts via a cothermolysis method capable of exhibiting propane conversion above 35% and propylene selectivity greater than 95% at 723 K in the PDH reaction.13 In the typical CATOFIN process, γ-Al2O3-supported catalysts contained 18–20 wt% CrOx promoted by 1–2 wt% Na or K.15 In addition, other catalysts based on V, Ga, Zr and Zn have also been investigated for the PDH reaction.16–19 Among them, Zn-based catalysts were thought to be promising due to their low cost and high catalytic performance in PDH.20 Chen et al. reported that small ZnO nanoclusters supported on a dealuminated β zeolite showed high catalytic activity and propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction.20 Schweitzer et al. found that coordinatively unsaturated Zn2+ supported on silica exhibited Lewis acid properties and could catalyze the PDH reaction with a high propylene selectivity of more than 95%.21 Therefore, the issue whether zinc oxide is an effective promoter for Cr-based catalysts in the PDH reaction is worthy to be explored.
Zn–Cr based oxides are typical methanol synthesis catalysts from syngas derived from coal, natural gas and biomass at relatively high reaction temperature and are also employed for other reactions. Tian et al. reported a Zn–Cr catalyst with a Zn/Cr element ratio of 1 : 1 exhibited an outstanding isobutanol synthesis activity from syngas.22 Al-Wadaani et al. studied Zn–Cr catalysts with a wide range of Zn/Cr ratios (20/1–1/30) for dehydroisomerisation of α-pinene to p-cymene and one with a Zn/Cr ratio of 1 : 1 showed the highest yield.23 According to X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of Zn–Cr mixed oxides used in these reactions, the catalysts have a Zn–Cr spinel phase with an excess of Zn2+ cations. Bertoldi et al. proposed that the excess Zn2+ located at the octahedral sites, which were coordinatively unsaturated, had a remarkable adsorptive capacity towards CO and other molecules, resulting in high catalytic performance.24 However, little research has been done on Zn–Cr mixed oxides with excess Cr3+ and Zn–Cr based oxides were not yet studied for the PDH reaction.
Therefore, we prepared a series of Zn–Cr mixed oxides with different Zn/Cr molar ratios (0–0.5) as catalysts for the PDH reaction. Interestingly, these bi-component oxides are active in the PDH reaction and the catalyst Zn0.3Cr shows the highest activity with 31.3% propane conversion and around 94% propylene selectivity. Detailed characterization studies were carried out and revealed that the excellent performance of Zn–Cr mixed oxides in the PDH reaction could be attributed to the formation of a small-size Zn–Cr spinel with defect sites.
Experimental
Catalyst preparation
ZnxCr oxides (x = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5) were prepared by a co-precipitation method, with x standing for the molar ratio of Zn/Cr. Taking the Zn0.3Cr sample as an example, the following synthesis procedure was used. 0.03 mol Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.10 mol Cr(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in a certain amount of deionized water to form a solution having a concentration of 1 mol L−1. A 200 ml aqueous solution with 0.2 mol (NH4)2CO3 was used as a precipitant. The aforementioned solutions were simultaneously added into a beaker containing 200 ml deionized water under stirring at 70 °C. During the process, the pH of the suspension was controlled between 7.0 and 7.1. The suspension was then aged for 3 h at 70 °C under stirring, followed by filtration and washing with deionized water three times. The resulting sample was dried at 100 °C for 12 h and then calcined at 500 °C in air for 4 h. ZnO, Cr2O3 and other ZnxCr samples were prepared by following the same procedure under the same conditions.
For comparison, CrOx/Al2O3 was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of Al2O3 with a Cr(NO3)3·9H2O aqueous solution.25 After impregnation, the sample was dried at 120 °C overnight and then calcined at 550 °C in air for 4 h. The actual concentration of Cr2O3 in the prepared catalyst is 17 wt%.
Catalyst characterization
The BET surface areas were obtained by nitrogen physisorption on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 system at 77 K. Prior to measurements, the samples were degassed at 625 K for 4 h. The chemical composition of all the samples was determined by XRF on a Philips Magix-601 XRF spectrometer.
The crystal phases of the samples were characterized by XRD, which was performed on a PANalytical X'Pert PRO X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The crystallite sizes were calculated by the Scherrer equation. The particle size was also estimated by TEM, which was performed on a JEM-2100 microscope operating at 200 kV. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) spectra were obtained on a JEM-2100F microscope operating at 200 kV.
XPS was performed on an ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer with monochromatized Al Kα as the exciting radiation. The binding energy of contaminant carbon C1s at 284.8 eV was used as a reference. In situ XPS was performed on a SPECS EnviroESCA spectrometer. 10 mbar 5% C3H8/Ar was introduced into the sample at 480 °C, before and after which the XPS spectra of the sample were measured.
The reducibility was characterized by H2-TPR, which was performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 analyzer. The samples were firstly treated in flowing Ar at 150 °C for 1 h before the test. After that, the samples were reduced in 10% H2/Ar flow at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. NH3-TPD was also carried out on the Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 analyzer. Before the measurement, the sample was firstly treated in flowing He at 450 °C for 1 h. Then, 10% NH3/He was introduced into the sample at 100 °C for 30 min followed by flushing with He. Subsequently, the sample was heated in He at a rate of 10 °C min−1 while NH3 desorption was monitored using a TCD detector.
Catalytic activity measurement
PDH reactions were performed in a fixed-bed stainless steel reactor fitted with a quartz lining. 0.3 g of the catalyst was loaded and heated to 400 °C for 1 h and 480 °C for 30 min in N2 (30 ml min−1). A mixture of 5% C3H8 and 95% Ar was fed into the reactor at a flow rate of 25 ml min−1. The reaction was monitored after 5 min from the start and was allowed to proceed for 5 h. Effluents were analysed with an on-line Agilent 7890B gas chromatograph, which was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). Propane conversion (XC3H8) and propylene selectivity (SC3H6) were calculated on a carbon atom basis and were expressed as the following:
Fi = fi × ni,
Among these, fi stands for the molar correction factor of the product i, ni is the carbon number of the product i, and Ai refers to the peak area of the product i measured by FID.
Results and discussion
The performance of all the catalysts for the PDH reaction was evaluated at 480 °C, 0.1 MPa, 5% C3H8/Ar and a space velocity of 5000 ml h−1 gcat−1. Upon addition of Zn, the activity improves obviously. However, there appears to be an optimum range of Zn addition. Among all the catalysts tested, Zn0.3Cr exhibits the optimal activity. As shown in Fig. 1, an initial conversion of 21% over Zn0.3Cr is obtained and further increases to 31.3% with time on stream, which is much higher than that of 7% over Zn0.1Cr and 11% over Zn0.5Cr. Meanwhile, the Zn0.3Cr catalyst also exhibits the highest selectivity to propylene, with SC3H6 maintaining around 94% along time on stream up to 300 min. Methane and C4 hydrocarbons are the main by-products for Zn0.3Cr with very little ethylene and ethane (Fig. 1c). For comparison, the single components Cr2O3 and ZnO were used as catalysts for the PDH reaction under the same reaction conditions. Fig. 1a shows that Cr2O3 gives a propane conversion of about 10% initially and drops rather quickly to around 5% and then levels off with a propylene selectivity of around 88%, which is lower than Zn0.3Cr. By contrast, ZnO is much less active, with XC3H8 lower than 2%, demonstrating the weak ability of ZnO to activate propane. In addition, Cr2O3/Al2O3, which has been frequently studied, was synthesized for comparison. The impregnation method was employed and the Cr2O3 loading was 17 wt%. Fig. 1d shows that its PDH activity under the same conditions is much lower than the Zn0.3Cr catalyst as its propane conversion is only 9% after reaching steady state.

To understand the origin of the high activity of Zn0.3Cr, we prepared a physically mixed ZnO–Cr2O3 catalyst with single components ZnO and Cr2O3 with the same molar ratio of Zn/Cr = 0.3 (denoted as ZnO–Cr2O3). One sees that XC3H8 is only 3%, which is similar to that obtained over ZnO, lower than that obtained over Cr2O3, and one order of magnitude lower than that on Zn0.3Cr (Fig. 1d). These results suggest that the high activity of the Zn0.3Cr catalyst could not be solely attributed to the coexisting ZnO and Cr2O3. Therefore, we turned to understanding the physicochemical properties of the ZnxCr catalysts in comparison to references ZnO and Cr2O3.
XRD was carried out in order to identify the crystal phase structure of the catalysts and the results are shown in Fig. 2a. The single component catalyst Cr2O3 exhibits only the crystal phase of Cr2O3 with an average crystal size of 32.8 nm, estimated according to the Scherrer equation, as listed in Table 1. With the addition of Zn to Cr2O3 at Zn/Cr = 0.1, the diffraction peaks of ZnCr2O4 appear in addition to those of Cr2O3 and the crystal size of ZnCr2O4 is estimated to be 7.9 nm. At Zn/Cr = 0.3, the intensity of Cr2O3 reduces further and the diffraction peaks of the ZnCr2O4 phase become more prominent but still rather broad. Interestingly, the estimated crystal size of the ZnCr2O4 phase becomes smaller (4.8 nm) with respect to that over Zn0.1Cr, but the remaining Cr2O3 crystals still retain a large size. At Zn/Cr = 0.5, there is only the ZnCr2O4 spinel phase detected and its crystal size increases to 8.8 nm compared to Zn0.3Cr. It is noted that the crystal structure does not change after the reaction, as evidenced by the XRD pattern of the spent Zn0.3Cr catalyst (Fig. 2b).

Smaller particles generally result in a higher surface area, as evidenced by the textual properties of these catalysts (Table 1). The specific surface areas and pore volumes of the bi-component catalysts ZnxCr are much higher. They are 43.0 m2 g−1 and 0.11 cm3 g−1 for Zn0.1Cr, and 148.4 m2 g−1 and 0.29 cm3 g−1 for Zn0.3Cr. However, further increasing the Zn/Cr ratio to 0.5 leads to a reduced specific surface area and pore volume (85.0 m2 g−1 and 0.19 cm3 g−1), consistent with the crystal size.
Further characterization with HRTEM (Fig. 3) shows that the particle size of the Cr2O3 catalyst is not uniform, with an average size of around 75.7 nm. The Zn0.1Cr and Zn0.3Cr catalysts show two different phases, i.e. Cr2O3 and ZnCr2O4, consistent with the XRD results. Interestingly, the particle size of the ZnCr2O4 phase is rather uniform being around 7.3 nm, whereas the Cr2O3 phase is composed of large particles around 100 nm for Zn0.1Cr. The particle size of ZnCr2O4 decreases to 6.2 nm for Zn0.3Cr. There are only few Cr2O3 particles observed. In comparison, HRTEM validates that Zn0.5Cr merely exhibits the ZnCr2O4 crystal phase and the particles are rather uniform but the size increases further to around 11.6 nm with respect to Zn0.3Cr. The above results indicate that the addition of zinc to Cr2O3 leads to the formation of a ZnCr2O4 spinel phase with particle size lower than 10 nm, whereas the Cr2O3 phase in the bi-component catalysts ZnxCr still retains a bulky particle size larger than 50 nm. Among them, the ZnCr2O4 phase in Zn0.3Cr has the smallest size being 4.8 nm. Generally, smaller particles give a higher surface area, and thus it is understandable that Zn0.3Cr exhibits the highest surface area. Furthermore, the EDS mappings of the ZnCr2O4 phase in the Zn0.3Cr catalyst in Fig. 4 show that the Zn and Cr elements are evenly distributed. Besides, the Zn/Cr molar ratio is 0.32 measured by EDS analysis, in agreement with the value measured by XRF (0.29). Therefore, the remarkably enhanced PDH activity is likely related to the formation of small sized Zn–Cr spinel species because smaller particles are frequently accompanied by defects.

Defect sites on oxides usually exhibit Lewis acidic properties and NH3-TPD is frequently employed to characterize the properties.18,26 It is generally accepted that the position and area of the ammonia desorption peak are directly associated with the acid strength and the acid amount, respectively.26 As shown in Fig. 5a, there are several NH3 desorption peaks for ZnxCr mixed oxides, implying the presence of multiple types of defect sites with different binding strengths to NH3. These peaks fall in a similar temperature range for the three ZnxCr samples. It appears that the Zn0.3Cr sample has another strong peak emerging beyond 400 °C. A blank temperature programmed experiment in He under the same conditions suggests that the decomposition of the catalyst itself has some contribution to the signal after 500 °C since it was calcined at 500 °C, as shown in Fig. 5b. NH3-TPD further shows that the amount of NH3 desorbed from Zn0.3Cr is considerably higher than that from the other two, as listed in Table 2. Tian et al. studied Zn–Cr spinel catalysts with excessive Zn (Zn0.8Cr and Zn1.2Cr) for isobutanol synthesis from syngas and they pointed out that the acidic character over these Zn–Cr spinel catalysts characterized by NH3-TPD was closely related to their surface properties. The higher peak area reflects the presence of more defect sites.27,28 Although non-stoichiometric spinels with excessive Zn have been widely studied for methanol and higher alcohol synthesis,24,27,28 Zn-deficient spinels were rarely studied. Elucidation of the actual structures of these defects will require more sophisticated experimental and theoretical studies.

Gao et al. reported that the metastable structure of non-stoichiometric Zn–Cr spinels with cation disorder and many defects could be stabilized by hydroxyl groups.29 Therefore, we studied the surface hydroxyl by XPS. As shown in Fig. 6, the signal at a low binding energy of 530.3–530.7 eV is assigned to lattice oxygen (labeled as Olatt) and the signal at a higher binding energy of 531.9–532.2 eV is derived from surface hydroxyl groups (labeled as OOH), as reported previously.29,30 The ratio of (OOH)/(Olatt + OOH) is estimated and summarized in Table 2. For the Zn–Cr oxides, the ratio of (OOH)/(Olatt + OOH) increases from 27.6% to 33.9% when the Zn/Cr molar ratio increases from 0.1 to 0.3, and then decreases to 29.6% when the Zn/Cr molar ratio further increases to 0.5. These data further validate the presence of more defect sites in the small-size Zn–Cr spinel of the Zn0.3Cr catalyst.

In order to further understand the promotion effect of zinc on Cr-based catalysts for the PDH reaction, the apparent activation energy over ZnxCr catalysts is estimated according to the formation rate of propylene in a temperature range between 480–540 °C. As shown in Fig. 7, the Zn0.3Cr catalyst exhibits a much lower apparent activation energy than the other two catalysts. It indicates that the addition of zinc to Cr2O3 promotes the active sites in addition to generating the ZnCr2O4 spinel phase and reducing the particle size.

H2-TPR was conducted to investigate the reducibility of the catalysts and the profiles of the ZnxCr catalysts are shown in Fig. 8. For comparison, the H2-TPR profiles of the single component Cr2O3 and ZnO catalysts are also presented. The results show that no obvious reduction peak is observed for ZnO below 650 °C. There is an obvious reduction peak at around 441 °C for Cr2O3. It was reported that there existed a small amount of Cr6+ species over the freshly calcined Cr2O3 oxides.31 The reduction peak around 441 °C over Cr2O3 was likely attributed to the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+, as reported by Akula et al.32 Interestingly, there are two reduction peaks observed for the ZnxCr oxides and the reduction temperatures (<361 °C) are much lower than for the single component Cr2O3. This implies the presence of more than one type of chromium species over ZnxCr oxides. For Zn0.1Cr, there are two reduction peaks observed at around 252 and 361 °C, which could be assigned to the reduction of Cr6+, from the Zn–Cr spinel phase or partially oxidized Cr2O3 phase, to Cr3+ as reported by Simard et al.33 The Zn and Cr cations within the stoichiometric Zn–Cr spinel (normally ZnCr2O4) are very difficult to reduce.34 Therefore, the broad reduction peak in the temperature range of 100–350 °C for Zn0.3Cr and the reduction peaks at around 256 and 300 °C for Zn0.5Cr could be assigned to the surface Cr2O3 species and/or Zn–Cr spinel phase with defects.34 Interestingly, the Zn0.3Cr catalyst exhibits the highest hydrogen consumption among all the ZnxCr catalysts, which is consistent with its highest concentration of defect site Cr3+.22 Lin et al. stated that there was a direct relationship between catalytic activity and the reducibility of a catalyst, i.e. the higher the reducibility of supported chromium oxide catalysts, the higher the catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4.35 Consequently, it is understandable that the Zn0.3Cr catalyst exhibits the highest PDH activity among the studied catalysts.

The Zn0.3Cr catalyst was further characterized by in situ XPS. The spectra were taken before propane was fed in and after the reaction had been allowed for 5 and 30 min, respectively. As shown in Fig. 9a, the peaks at 1021.4 and 1044.6 eV are attributed to Zn2+,36 which did not change during the reaction.
Fig. 9 In situ XPS spectra taken before propane was fed in (0 min) and after the reaction had been allowed for 5 and 30 min: (a) Zn 2p; (b) Cr 2p.
The spectra of Cr 2p are shown in Fig. 9b. Deconvolution of the Cr 2p3/2 spectrum indicates the presence of both Cr6+ and Cr3+ species over the catalyst before the reaction, represented by the signals at binding energies of 576.8 and 579.3 eV, respectively.37 However, after the reaction for 5 min at 480 °C, the surface Cr6+ species disappear and there are only Cr3+ species left. The Cr 2p spectrum of Zn0.3Cr after the reaction for 30 min exhibits a similar feature and there is not much change with respect to that for 5 min. These results indicate that some Cr6+ species on the fresh catalyst surface are reduced to Cr3+ during the initial stage of the PDH reaction and remain as Cr3+ during the reaction. The reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ species during the initial stage of the PDH reaction was also observed by in situ XANES and UV-vis spectroscopy previously.38,39 De Rossi et al. reported a correlation of the concentration of the coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ species with the PDH activity over Cr/Al2O3 and Cr/SiO2 catalysts.11 They further concluded that the most active Cr3+ species were those with two coordinative vacancies, according to the IR studies of CO and NO adsorption on Cr/SiO2.11 In this work, we observe some reducible Cr6+ species on the surface. However, the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Cr3+ on the defect sites of Cr2O3 and small particles of ZnCr2O4, and even their interfaces cannot be excluded completely. These may have led to a lower apparent activation energy for Zn0.3Cr than the other two catalysts, and hence enhanced its PDH activity.
Conclusions
We report here that Cr2O3 promoted with zinc has remarkably enhanced its catalytic activity in the PDH reaction. Furthermore, this enhancement is dependent on the molar ratio of Zn/Cr and Zn0.3Cr exhibits the highest activity and selectivity to propylene. For instance, propane conversion reaches 31.3% and propylene selectivity is 94% under reaction conditions of 480 °C, 0.1 MPa, 5% C3H8/Ar and a space velocity of 5000 ml h−1 gcat−1. In comparison, propane conversion is only 7% and propylene selectivity is 92% over Zn0.1Cr and 11% and 93% over Zn0.5Cr, respectively. All are higher than those over the single component catalysts Cr2O3 and ZnO. XRD, TEM, NH3-TPD, XPS and H2-TPR indicate that Zn0.3Cr contains small spinel particles, which could lead to formation of more defect sites around ZnCr2O4 particles and/or their interfaces with Cr2O3 though the latter phase still retains a large particle size. Furthermore, the lowest apparent activation energy over Zn0.3Cr implies that the Zn additive may have also modified the properties of the active sites.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
