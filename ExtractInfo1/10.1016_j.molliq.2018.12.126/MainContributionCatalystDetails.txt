The provided extractions do not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation catalysts. The documents focus on photocatalytic dye degradation and do not discuss conversion of propane to propylene. Since there are no mentions of PDH, ODH, propane, or propylene, I cannot extract and synthesize details about advancements in these reaction systems. The documents appear unrelated to the topic of interest.
