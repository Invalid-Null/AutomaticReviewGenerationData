The provided document does not seem to discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically for the conversion of propane to propylene. The manuscript focuses on the fabrication of an OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite photocatalyst and its application for the degradation of a dye pollutant (fast green). It does not mention the use of this catalyst for propane dehydrogenation reactions. Therefore, I do not believe this document is relevant to extract details about advancements in PDH/ODH catalysts.
