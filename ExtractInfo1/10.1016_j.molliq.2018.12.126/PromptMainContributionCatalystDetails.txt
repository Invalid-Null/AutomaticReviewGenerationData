Catalytic reduction of fast green dye by OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite
Abstract
The dyes are one of major pollutants discharged to water bodies without any premeditation. Their undesirable detection in aqueous bodies has created a menace as they tend to disturb the complete aquatic ecosystem by directly hindering the photosynthetic process of aquatic flora. Thus pre and post discharge remediation of these dyes are of immense significance. In the present study, novel OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite having high photocatalytic ability was prepared by co-precipitation method. Visible photocatalytic ability of the nanocomposite was employed for the degradation of fast green dye as a target pollutant. The OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite was well characterized using various techniques as FTIR, XRD, SEM, TEM and XPS etc. The nanocomposite also exhibited adsorption capability due to the presence of oxidized graphite (OG) sheets those provided high surface area for the fast green molecules to get adsorb onto them. High degradation efficiency (89%) was obtained within 90 min of visible light irradiation. Effect of pH, photocatalyst amount and light intensity was also studied. Superoxide and hydroxyl radicals were found to be the major reacting species as confirmed by the scavenging studies. Furthermore, OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite exhibited high reusability interpreting the nanocomposite as a proficient photocatalyst with active utilization for treating industrial waste water.

1. Introduction
Uncontrolled discharge of wastes without any pre-treatment from textile, pharmaceutical, paper or pesticides industries has contaminated our water system to an extremely hazardous level [1,2]. The waste direct discharges into the environment cause a serious threat to the aquatic animals as well as to the human life. Industries such as cosmetics, textile, plastics and paper utilize dyes to color their products [3,4]. Among them, textile industries are the major pollution causing since approximately 10–15% of the dyes from these industries are discharge directly into water system during processing. Presence of these dyes in the water system even in minute concentrations have quite adverse effects as it is carcinogenic to human beings, highly visible and also reduces the sunlight availability to the water developers [[5], [6], [7], [8]]. Their removal is quite difficult due to their complex aromatic structure that is hard to degrade as a result of which these dyes remain in the environment for longer time period [9]. Therefore, it is of immense importance to develop some technical methods to eradicate these dyes [[10], [11], [12]]. Various conventional biological treatment processes are not that much effective for dye removal due to the low biodegradability of these dyes. However, photocatalysis has been found to be an effective method for dye removal [[13], [14], [15], [16]]. This process has been used for disinfecting water [17,18], hydrogen production by water splitting [19,20] and production of self-cleaning surface [21]. Photocatalytic activity of the concerned photocatalyst depends upon its tendency to form electron-hole pairs that helps in the production of reactive free radicals [[22], [23], [24]]. For the effective generation of free radicals, photocatalyst should have well-arranged band gap, photostability, chemical stability, and high affinity to the electromagnetic radiations [25,26].
Graphite and its derivatives as graphene, oxidized graphite and reduced graphene oxide are the most promising two-dimensional carbon material that has been broadly engaged in various fields such as electrodes [27], transparent films [28] and polymer composite fillers [29,30] due to its exceptionally improved properties; high surface area, high electron conductivity and exceptional thermal conductivity [31,32]. In addition, recent literature has recognized graphene as the supreme candidate for accepting and transporting photogenerated electrons from the surface of photocatalysts by effectively employing the electron conductivity of graphene resulting into superior transfer proficiency and prolonged lifetime of photogenerated electrons [[33], [34], [35]]. The various nanocomposites have been designed especially for waste treatment [36,37]. These nanocomposites have superior properties then their constituent's parts [[38], [39], [40]].
Zirconia owns many beneficial properties such as high mechanical and thermal stability, large surface area, basicity, acidity, enhanced semiconductor properties and high oxidizing or reducing abilities among other metal oxides. Zirconia shows synergistic effects during catalysis due to the presence of hydroxyl groups which are basic in nature, Brönsted acidic and unsaturated Lewis acidic-basic Zr4+O2– pairs on its surface [41,42]. Composites of zirconia, formed by coupling zirconia with other metal oxides exhibits higher catalytic activity as compared to single zirconia [43]. Lanthanum oxide, a rare earth promoter, displays a substantial enrichment of catalytic activity because of enhancement in number of active site. It expands the resistance to thermal sintering and thwarts the early deactivation [44]. Furthermore, Lanthanum oxide has been found to proficiently improve the catalytic activity of diverse solid acids like zeolite [45]. Therefore, the combination of two metal oxides (ZrO2 and La2O3) can strengthen the interaction of metal-support and intensifies the catalytic activity. In context of this, a systematic study has been carried out to synthesize OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite by co-precipitation method utilized for the photocatalytic degradation of fast green under xenon lamp. Major participating species in the degradation were ascertained by the scavenger studies. The importance of this study lies in the fact that OG/La2O3/ZrO2 based nanocomposite was fabricated for the visible light induced degradation of noxious dye.
2. Materials and methods

Graphite flakes, sulphuric acid (H2SO4), potassium permanganate (KMnO4), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), l-ascorbic acid, hydrochloric acid (HCl), lanthanum nitrate, sodium borohydride (NaBH4) were purchased from Loba Chemie Pvt. Ltd. India. Zirconium oxy chloride (ZrOCl4), fast green and ammonia solution (NH3) were obtained from Qualikems Chem. Pvt. Ltd. India. Double distilled water was used throughout the experimental section.

2.2. Synthesis of oxidized graphite
Modified hummers method was used for the preparation of OG. In this method, 1 g of graphite flakes was added to 50 mL of 98% H2SO4 taken in a 250 mL volumetric flask, kept on ice bath to maintain low temperature (between 0 and 5 °C) with constant stirring for 2 h. 3 g potassium permanganate was then added to the suspension slowly followed by the dropwise addition of 1 M NaOH solution. A proper check over the pH of solution was also carried out. When the solution pH became 6, 0.01 M l-ascorbic acid was added and the solution was then again subjected to continuous stirring for 1 h at 95 °C. Black colored precipitates formed were then filtered out, washed with 1 M HCl solution several times and dried in hot air oven at 50 °C.
2.3. Synthesis of oxidized graphite/lanthanum oxide nanocomposite (OG/La2O3)
The composite of OG/La2O3 was synthesized by precipitation method. In typical procedure, 40 mM lanthanum nitrate solution in 50 mL double distilled water was prepared to which 100 mg above prepared OG was added. The mixture was then ultrasonicated for 1 h and was followed by the addition of reducing solution of 0.2 M NaBH4. The mixture was then continuously stirred for 2 h using magnetic stirrer. The obtained precipitates were then filtered and dried in hot air oven at 50 °C.
2.4. Synthesis of oxidized graphite/lanthanum oxide/zirconium oxide nanocomposite (OG/La2O3/ZrO2)
For the synthesis of oxidized graphite/lanthanum oxide/zirconium oxide nanocomposite (OG/La2O3/ZrO2), 0.2 M zirconium oxychloride solution was prepared. Under constant stirring of 2 h, 30 mg of above prepared OG/La2O3 was added to solution of zirconium oxychloride (40 mL) and ultrasonicated for 15 min. 30 mL of 25% ammonium hydroxide solution was added to the above reaction mixture till the pH becomes 9 and then again stirred for another 50 min. Precipitates obtained were then filtered out, washed several times with double distilled water and dried in hot air oven at 50 °C.
2.5. Characterization
FTIR studies were carried out using Nicolet 5700 FTIR spectrophotometer KBr disk method. Surface morphological and size determination studies were carried out using JSM 6100 scanning electron microscope and Techni G2 20 S-Twin transmission electron microscope. X-Ray diffraction patterns were carried out by Philips 1830 diffractometer using CuKα radiations. INCO Instrument and Chemical Pvt. Ltd. based double beam UV–Vis spectrophotometer was used for the dye degradation analysis. XPS characterization was studied on a Auger Electron Spectroscopy (AES) Module Model/Supplier: PHI 5000 Versa Prob II,FEI Inc. instrument using monochromatic Al K (10 mA, 15 kV) and achromatic Mg KX-ray radiation (5 mA, 15 kV). 20 eV of analyzer energy was kept for obtaining 0.53 eV of resolution. The base pressure was kept below 10−7 Pa in analysis chamber during analysis. The photoelectrochemical nature of La2O3, ZrO2, and OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite was examined. The electrodes preparation was done using indium-tin oxide (ITO) as substrate. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was then carried for the La2O3, ZrO2, and OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite with 0.05 M Na2SO4. The AC voltage amplitude was 5.0 mV (frequency: 0.01 Hz to 100 kHz). Photo-current response was also recorded.
2.6. Photocatalytic degradation
The synthesized OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite was utilized for its photocatalytic ability and all the experiments were carried out at ambient temperature with fast green as the targeted pollutant dye. 100 W xenon lamp was used as the visible light source. Before undertaking the final degradation experiments, parameters such as pH, photocatalyst amount and light intensity were optimized first. In final experimental sets, optimized pH and photocatalyst amount was dispersed in 100 mL of 30 mg/L fast green dye solution and was subjected to xenon lamp for visible light irradiation. Besides, 3 mL of dye solution was taken out before and after the solution exposure to visible-light. Changes in the absorption spectrum of fast green were analyzed by double beam UV–vis absorption spectrum at 620 nm [46]. Furthermore, the degradation efficiency of fast green dye was determined by the equation [47,48]:
(1)
where C0 is the initial dye concentration in mg/L and Ct is the dye concentration at any time t in mg/L.
2.7. Catalytic reduction of fast green
In typical catalytic reduction experiment, catalytic reduction of fast green by OG/La2O3/ZrO2 was determined by the degradation of 20 ppm fast green solution (20 mL). To the fast green solution, 0.1 M NaBH4 solution was added and stirred continuously for 5 min at room temperature. This was followed by the addition of 5 mg OG/La2O3/ZrO2 and the mixture was again stirred till the color of the solution disappeared completely. The reduction of fast green was monitored by double beam UV–vis spectrophotometer at 620 nm [49].
3. Result and discussion
3.1. Characterization
Fig. 1(a–b) shows the FTIR spectrum of OG/La2O3 and OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposites. In Fig. 1(a), the characteristic peak at 3345 cm−1 is due to the OH stretching of the hydroxyl group [50]. The strong and intense peak at 1365 and 978 cm−1 are ascribed to the appearance of CC stretching and CH bending respectively [51]. Peak at 1481 and 1642 cm−1 corresponds to the presence of aromatic CC and carboxyl group of OG [32]. Stretching of CH group corresponds to the 2357 cm−1 [52,53]. Peak at 670 cm−1 is confirming the presence of LaO [54]. Fig. 1(b) shows the characteristic peaks of OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposites. Change in the characteristic peaks of OG and LaO shows the bonding of zirconia particles onto the OG/La2O3. Peak at 903 cm−1 confirms the presence of ZrO in the nanocomposite [54]. Bonding of zirconia to OG/La2O3 shifted the characteristic peak of LaO from 670 cm−1 to 662 cm−1.

X-ray diffraction patterns of OG/La2O3 and OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite are shown in Fig. 1(c–d). It shows characteristic peaks at 26°, 27.5°, 32.99°, 30.82°, 50.37° and 60.76°. Peaks at 27.5° and 32.99° correspond to the (002) and (220) diffraction planes of lanthanum confirming its hexagonal nature; which is in accordance with standard JCPDS card no. 02-0607 [54]. A comparatively less intense peak at 26° confirms the presence of reduced phase of graphite in OG [55]. Distinct diffraction peaks at 30.82°, 50.37° and 60.76° correspond to the diffraction planes of (101), (112) and (211), confirming the presence of tetragonal ZrO2 (JCPDS 50–1089) [56,57]. Change in the peak values of OG and lanthanum confirms the formation of the desired nanocomposite OG/La2O3/ZrO2. Scheme 1 represents the synthesis mechanism for OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite.

Scheme 1. Mechanism for synthesis of OG/La2O3/ZrO2.
The morphological elucidations of OG, OG/La2O3 and OG/La2O3/ZrO2 have been studied using scanning electron microscope and presented in Fig. 2(a–c). Fig. 2(a) shows the sheet like structure of OG [58]. Fig. 2(b) shows the presence of LaO particles onto the OG sheets. Highly irregular lanthanum oxides particles are clearly visible. Fig. 2(c) shows the morphological changes that arise due to the formation of OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite. Addition of ZrO2 to the OG/La2O3 resulted in more agglomeration of particles on the surface of OG sheets. TEM image of OG shows its sheet like structure (Fig. 2d). Fig. 2(e) shows the presence of lanthanum oxide particles into the OG sheets that have also been marked in the figure. Fig. 2(f) reveals the changes in surface morphology on addition of ZrO2. Irregular surface with high agglomeration is clearly visible. Thus TEM reveals the formation of OG/La2O3/ZrO2 at nanorange. Fig. 2(g) shows HRTEM image reveling the lattice fringes for La2O3 and ZrO2. The SEM images in Fig. 2(h and i) demonstrated that OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite in mechanical strong as its retains the morphology even after photodegradation.

Fig. S1(a–b) shows the EDS spectrum for OG/La2O3 and OG/La2O3/ZrO2. These two confirms the presence of carbon, oxygen, lanthanum and zirconium in the synthesized nanocomposite. To understand the chemical state and surface composition of OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite XPS was performed. Fig. 3(a) demonstrates the complete survey scan of OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite showing the existence of C, O, La, & Zr elements. The deconvoluted spectra for all elements are shown in Fig. 3(b, c, d, e). The O 1s spectrum (Fig. 3b) shows four deconvoluted peaks at 530.63 eV for lattice oxygen, 530.13 eV for adsorbed oxygen and peaks at 531.66 eV and 534.34 eV for CO and COH groups of OG [59]. The C 1s (Fig. 5c) deconvoluted spectrum shows sharp peaks around 283.64 eV, 285.18 eV and 287.47 eV are attributed to the CC/CH, CO and CO of pure reduced graphene oxide respectively [59,60]. The deconvoluted spectrum of La (Fig. 3c) shows two sets peaks which are ascribed to La 3d 5/2 (834.30 eV and 837.42 eV) and La 3d 3/2 (854.28 eV and 850.95 eV) showing their multiplet split, respectively [61]. The deconvoluted Zr 3d spectrum (Fig. 3d) shows peaks at 181.57 eV for Zr 3d5/2 and 183.68 eV, 184.07 eV for Zr3d 3/2 the shift in binding energies has been observed which may be due to binding of ZrO2 with other counter parts [62].

3.2. Optical studies
The Tauc plots for La2O3, ZrO2 and OG/La2O3/ZrO2 has been presented in Fig. 4(a). Energy band gap values as calculated have been found to be 2.91, 2.49 and 2.82 eV for La2O3, ZrO2 and OG/La2O3/ZrO2, respectively. Various band gap parameters have been presented in Table S1. Fig. 4(b) shows the PL spectra of La2O3, ZrO2 and OG/La2O3/ZrO2. It suggests the high PL emission intensities for La2O3 and ZrO2. However, in case of OG/La2O3/ZrO2, the curve almost flattens which indicates the decrease in e−/h+ recombination ability. The photoluminescence is prompted by the recombination of holes and electrons. Lower PL intensity indicates decreased recombination. Fig. 4(c) shows the probable heterojunction for the fabricated semiconductor OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite. The conduction band of ZrO2 (0.46) lies below of La2O3 (−0.21) that resulted in movement of electrons from La2O3 to ZrO2. Electrons also migrated to the Fermi level of OG. In addition, the valence band energy of ZrO2 (2.9) is greater than La2O3 (2.73), that generalizes the movement of holes from ZrO2 to La2O3. Fig. 4(d) demonstrates the Nyquist plots for EIS spectra of photoanodes of ZrO2, La2O3 and OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite. It is visible in Nyquist plots that OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite has small semi-circle in comparison to its constituents counter parts i.e., ZrO2, La2O3 thus demonstrating that charge transfer resistance is low for nanocomposite hence having superior charge carrier separation and conductivity. Fig. 4(e) shows generated photocurrent by La2O3, ZrO2 and OG/La2O3/ZrO2 (against Ag/AgCl) when illuminated with visible light. OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite showed highest photocurrent as compared to La2O3 and ZrO2. This may be as addition or OG which reduces the electron-holes recombination.

3.3. Photocatalytic performance
The photocatalytic experiments for the degradation of fast green dye by synthesized OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite were carried out using xenon lamp irradiation of light intensity 70 mW/cm2. Before undertaking the photocatalytic experiments, plain photolysis of the fast green solution was done in which 50 mL of 30 mg/L fast green solution was subjected to xenon lamp radiations for 90 min. Results presented in Fig. 5(a) shows that only 5.1% degradation occurred without the presence of any photocatalyst.

For the initiation experiments, 0.05 g of OG, OG/La2O3 and OG/La2O3/ZrO2 were individually dispersed into the 50 mL fast green solution (30 mg/L) with the purpose of adsorption-desorption equilibrium and the readings were noted at 30, 60 and 90 min (Fig. 5b). Results showed that out of three, OG/La2O3/ZrO2 showed maximum efficiency of 35% for the adsorption-desorption equilibrium that was attained within 90 min of shaking in thermostatic shaker. OG/La2O3/ZrO2 exhibited high adsorption ability towards fast green as compared to OG and OG/La2O3 that showed its high contaminant removal efficiency. The adsorptive tendency of OG for fast green was due to the π-π interactions [63].
A comparative degradation study was also determined for OG, OG/La2O3, OG/ZrO2 and OG/La2O3/ZrO2 the results have been presented in Fig. 5(c). Results showed that the removal of fast green by bare OG was only 21% after 90 min. However, after the addition of La2O3 to OG, around 62% degradation and addition of ZrO2 to OG 65% degradation was noted individually. Whereas the degradation was found to be 76% using to OG/La2O3/ZrO2 suggesting the high photocatalytic degradation ability of nanocomposite for fast green (without optimization of photocatalysis parameters). This enhanced degradation tendency can be ascribed to the highest mobility of charges and reduced electron-hole pair recombination ability. The OG present in the nanocomposite provides high surface area for adsorption and degradation of dye to take place [64].
3.3.1. Effect of pH on photodegradation of fast green
Fast green is an anionic dye and is very sensitive to the solution pH. The effect of pH was studied in the range of 2–14. The pH was adjusted using 0.1 M NaOH/HNO3 solution and the results have been presented in Fig. 5(d). It is evident from the data that the degradation decreases with increase in pH value from 4 to 14. Maximum degradation efficiency was observed at pH 4 [65]. It can be explained on the basis that at pH 4, the negatively charged fast green dye was attracted towards the positively charged OG/La2O3/ZrO2. Fig. 5(d) inset shows point zero charge of OG/La2O3/ZrO2. Results have shown that pHpzc for designed OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite is 5.3, denoting the positively charged surface below this pH and negatively charged above pH 5.3. However, further increase in pH, turned the surface of OG/La2O3/ZrO2 negative that resulted in decrease in the degradation efficiency.
3.3.2. Effect of photocatalyst dosage
The effect of amount of photocatalyst on the degradation efficiency was studied by varying the amount of OG/La2O3/ZrO2 from 10 to 40 mg. The results are shown in Fig. 5(e). Degradation proficiency of OG/La2O3/ZrO2 increased from 20 to 81% with increase in photocatalyst amount from 10 to 30 mg. At low dosage amount, the number of active sites is less but as soon as the photocatalyst amount increases to 30 mg, the degradation efficiency also increases due to increase in actives sites. However, over dosage of the catalyst amount (above 30 mg) resulted in agglomeration, turbidity and light scattering that blocks the path of illumination penetration as result of which the degradation efficiency of photocatalyst decreases.
3.3.3. Effect of light intensity on the photodegradation of fast green by OG/La2O3/ZrO2
Effect of variation of light intensity on the photodegradation of fast green was also investigated and the results have been presented in Fig. 5(e). Results indicated that the degradation rate increases with increase in light intensity from 10 to 70 mW/cm2. Increase in light intensity increases the number of photons striking per unit area of the OG/La2O3/ZrO2. However, further increase in light intensities was avoided due to thermal effects.
3.4. Photocatalysis, COD, TOC, scavenger study and reusability
Fig. 6(a–b) shows the UV–Vis absorption spectra of fast green treated with 10 and 30 mg of OG/La2O3/ZrO2 under irradiation for the different time interval. As can be seen from the spectra, maximum absorbance was recorded at 620 nm that gradually decreases with time interval and maximum degradation was recorded with 30 mg of OG/La2O3/ZrO2 loading.

Final photocatalytic activity of OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite towards fast green was evaluated using the pre-optimized effects such as pH, photocatalyst amount and light intensity. In typical process, 100 mL of 30 mg/L fast green solution with pH 4 and 30 mg OG/La2O3/ZrO2 amount was subjected to 70mw/cm2 visible light irradiation (using xenon lamp). Results have been presented in Fig. 6(c). Fig. 6(c) shows that maximum degradation observed was 89% within 90 min of visible light irradiation. The kinetic studies were also carried out to underline the major undertaking degradation mechanism of fast green by OG/La2O3/ZrO2. The linear plot of time versus ln C0/Ct showed that the degradation of fast green by OG/La2O3/ZrO2 followed pseudo-first order generalizing the high dependence of degradation rate onto amount of OG/La2O3/ZrO2 in the solution (Fig. 6d).
The possible photocatalytic mechanism of the degradation of fast green by OG/La2O3/ZrO2 is generally associated with the adsorption ability of OG/La2O3/ZrO2 and possible decreased recombination of electron-hole pairs generated during the excitation processes [66]. In the present photocatalytic degradation experiment, high efficiency has been observed which is probably due to the synergistic effect between the OG sheets, La2O3 and ZrO2. Other probable reasons are the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs and high adsorption ability of OG sheets.
The mineralization ability of OG/La2O3/ZrO2 for fast green was evaluated by TOC and COD (Fig. 7a–b). Results presented that COD reduced to 32% in the experimental time period of 90 min (Fig. 7a). However TOC results, presented in Fig. 7(b) revealed that 49% was removed with 120 min during the contact between fats green and OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite. The major reactive species in the photodegradation of fast green were determined by the scavenger study. Various scavengers such as 4-hydroxy-2,2, 6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy (TEMPOL), ammonium oxalate (AO) and triethanolamine (TEOA) were employed for quenching the activity of O2⁎−, ⁎OH and h+ respectively [55] and the results have been presented in Fig. 7(c) [67]. It was observed that when 1 mM TEOA was added to the reacting solution, the percent decreased from 88 to 81%, indicating that h+ were not the major degrading species. However, addition of 1 mM TEMPOL decreased the percent degradation from 89 to 39% and in case of AO, percentage decreased from 87 to 52% generalizing the major reacting species were O2⁎− followed by ⁎OH.

The reusability of the OG/La2O3/ZrO2 determines its practical application under real systems. Thus the photocatalyst was tested for consecutive 5 cycles. Results presented in Fig. 7(d) shows that the percent degradation decreased from 84% to 74% after 5th cycle which shows its high reusability. Observed decrease in degradation ability may be because of the blocking of active sites due to the adsorption of fast green dye molecules and degradation intermediates onto it.
3.5. Reduction of fast green
The catalytic reduction results of fast green by OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite have been presented in Fig. S2. Results revealed the changes in absorbance of dye under double beam UV–Vis spectrophotometer at 0 (initial) and after 2 min. Complete reduction of fast green was achieved within 2 min. Major steps involving the reduction process are (a) first adsorption of NaBH4 onto OG/La2O3/ZrO2 surface; (b) secondly, adsorption of fast green onto OG/La2O3/ZrO2 and (c) reduction of fast green by OG/La2O3/ZrO2.
4. Conclusion
In summary, OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite has been fabricated by co-precipitation method. FTIR, XRD, SEM and TEM results confirmed the deposition of lanthanum oxide and zirconia onto the OG sheets. OG sheets provided high surface area for the adsorption of dyes to take place and the deposition of other two metal oxides onto the OG helped in suppressing the electron-hole pair recombination ability thus, leading to high photocatalytic activity of OG/La2O3/ZrO2 towards the degradation of fast green dye. Photocatalytic results showed 89% fast green degradation under visible light irradiation using xenon lamp and the degradation results followed the pseudo-first order kinetics. Scavenger activity generalized that the major reacting species involved in degradation were O2⁎− followed by ⁎OH. High reusability of the OG/La2O3/ZrO2 nanocomposite expresses its high reusable nature. Thus, OG/La2O3/ZrO2 can further be utilized for the photocatalytic degradation of other organic pollutants in near future.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
