Pentacoordinate Al3+ Sites Anchoring Synthesis of Palladium Intermetallic Catalysts on Al2O3 Supports
Abstract
Size control of supported Pd-based intermetallic nanoparticles (i-NPs) remains a major challenge because the required high-temperature annealing for atomic diffusion and ordering easily causes metal sintering. Here, we described a pentacoordinate Al3+ site (Al3+penta) anchoring approach for the preparation of Pd-based i-NPs with controlled size, which takes advantage of the strong chemical interaction between Al3+penta sites and Pd-based i-NPs to realize size control. We synthesized six types of Pd-based i-NPs, and four of them can remain an average particle size of <6 nm. Furthermore, one of our prepared Pd-based i-NPs (that is, Pd3Pb) demonstrated outstanding performance in catalyzing the semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene.

Synopsis
A pentacoordinate Al3+ site anchoring approach was developed to prepare small-sized Pd-based intermetallic nanoparticles with an enhanced catalytic performance.
Supported Pd-based alloy nanoparticles have great potential in many catalytic processes, including selective hydrogenation, biomass conversions, organic coupling reactions, and electrocatalysis of oxygen reduction. (1−3) The performance benefit of the alloy system in comparison to the monometallic system originates from the optimization of geometric and electrical structures because of the incorporation of second transition metals. (4,5) In particular, constructing the alloy with regular structures (ordered intermetallic compounds) is critical for maximizing their catalytic performance because it allows the production of enhanced geometric or electrical effects. (6−10) Another advantage of intermetallic compounds is that their well-defined structures make it possible to investigate the structure–activity relationships. (3,11,12)
Nevertheless, the preparation of intermetallic nanoparticles (i-NPs) usually requires high temperatures to overcome the kinetic energy barrier of atomic diffusion and ordering, which frequently accelerates interparticle sintering, (9) especially for Pd-based i-NPs, which are more likely to suffer the sintering issue during high-temperature annealing because of the relatively low Taman temperature of Pd-based alloys. (13) To this end, several strategies have been proposed recently to address the preparation challenges for size control of Pd-based i-NPs, including wet-chemical synthesis with organic capping ligands, (14,15) metal–organic framework-confined coreduction, (16−18) coating with polymer shells, (19) and KCl matrix-assisted annealing. (20,21) Unfortunately, these methods often require tedious multistep processes involving the formation of physical encapsulation structures, which causes limited exposure of active sites and a poor mass-transfer property. Therefore, it remains a challenge to achieve the preparation of small-sized Pd-based i-NPs via a confinement-free method.
Here, we report a confinement-free approach for the preparation of Pd-based i-NPs with controlled size by using nanosheet-assembled Al2O3 (NA-Al2O3) as a support. Our interests in NA-Al2O3 arise from its ability to provide abundant Al3+penta sites, (22−25) which have been demonstrated to be capable of forming a strong chemical interaction with monometallic Pd to suppress sintering. (26) In this regard, we explore the synthesis of six Pd-based i-NP catalysts via a high-temperature annealing process with the NA-Al2O3 support. The NA-Al2O3 support exhibited a distinct advantage in the particle size control of Pd-based i-NPs, compared to commercial Al2O3 supports. We further demonstrated the superiority of the prepared Pd3Pb i-NP catalyst for selectively catalyzing the semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene.
The NA-Al2O3 support was prepared via a hydrothermal method using AlCl3·6H2O, K2SO4, and CO(NH2)2 as raw materials. (26) Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations revealed that NA-Al2O3 has a hollow microsphere morphology with a shell thickness of 600–800 nm and a diameter of 3–4 μm (Figure S1a). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations indicated that the shell of the hollow microsphere consisted of interconnected 10-nm-thick nanosheets in a manner to form a flower-shaped superstructure (Figures S1b and S2). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern showed peaks that correspond to γ-phase Al2O3 (Figure S1c). The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm corroborated the presence of a hysteresis loop (Figure S1d), indicating the mesoporous nature of NA-Al2O3, which was further supported by the pore-size distribution (Figure S3). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area (SBET) of NA-Al2O3 was calculated to be 160 m2 g–1. No apparent structural deformation, phase transformation, or significant SBET loss (154 m2 g–1) was observed for NA-Al2O3 after high-temperature annealing at 700 °C (Figure S4). These results indicated that the use of NA-Al2O3 to support metal nanoparticles is capable of avoiding the sintering issue of metal nanoparticles caused by structural destruction of the support material.
To prove the ability of NA-Al2O3 to stabilize metal nanoparticles, we conducted sintering tests of monometallic Pd (8 wt %) on the NA-Al2O3 support. We prepared the sample for a sintering study by wet impregnation of PdCl2 on the NA-Al2O3 support, followed by air calcination at 500 °C (denoted as Pd/NA-Al2O3). For comparison, a commercial Al2O3-supported Pd sample (denoted as Pd/Com-Al2O3) was prepared by the same process, wherein the as-employed Com-Al2O3 support featured a bulk microparticle morphology with a SBET value of 302 m2 g–1 (Figure S5). After high-temperature treatment at 700 °C, the SBET value of Com-Al2O3 was decreased to 244 m2 g–1 (Figure S5b). The sintering experiments were performed at 600–800 °C under 5.0 vol % H2/Ar [marked as Pd/NA-Al2O3-X or Pd/Com-Al2O3-X, where X represents the temperature]. The XRD patterns showed that the particle size of Pd/NA-Al2O3-X is significantly smaller than that of Pd/Com-Al2O3-X (Figure S6). As for Pd/NA-Al2O3, high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) observations demonstrated that the average particle size of Pd nanoparticles increased from 6 to 8 nm when the temperature was raised from 600 to 800 °C, and in all cases, Pd nanoparticles were homogeneously distributed over the whole support (Figures S7 and S8). In contrast, the overgrowth of Pd on Com-Al2O3 already appeared at 600 °C, showing an average size of 9.9 nm; subsequent temperature increases further aggravated the sintering of Pd and widened the particle size distribution (Figures S7 and S8).
This outstanding antisintering property prompted us to explore the preparation of Pd-based i-NPs. The Pd-based i-NPs were prepared by wet-impregnation of Pd/NA-Al2O3 with metal salt precursors followed by a subsequent H2 reduction process. The H2 reduction process was conducted at 600–800 °C to overcome the kinetic energy barrier of alloying and atomic ordering. We totally prepared six binary Pd-based i-NPs, including Pd3Pb, Pd3Fe, Pd2Ga, PdIn, PdZn, and PdCu3, to demonstrate the universality of the method. For comparison, Com-Al2O3 was also used as the support to prepare Pd-based i-NP catalysts by an identical process.
XRD patterns revealed that the diffraction peaks of the prepared i-NPs matched well with the corresponding Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) cards (Figure 1), illustrating the successful preparation of the targeted intermetallic phases. The statistical results from HAADF-STEM revealed that the average particle size of most NA-Al2O3-supported i-NPs (denoted as i-NPs/NA-Al2O3) was less than 6 nm, except for Pd2Ga (8.71 nm) and PdIn (12.56 nm) (Figure S9 and Table S1). Notably, the average particle size of the Com-Al2O3-supported i-NPs (denoted as i-NPs/Com-Al2O3) was 1.5–7 times larger in comparison to that of the NA-Al2O3-supported counterparts (Figure S9 and Table S1).

We selected Pd3Pb/NA-Al2O3 and Pd3Fe/NA-Al2O3 to verify formation of the ordered structure by aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM imaging. As presented in Figure 2a,b, both cases demonstrated a periodic square array of alternating light and dark spots along the [001] zone axis, corresponding to the typical L12-ordered structure. The as-measured lattice spacing of 0.403 and 0.381 nm can be assigned to the (100) plane of Pd3Pb and Pd3Fe, respectively. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns with superlattice reflections (Figure 2a,b) and the alternating intensity profiles (Figure S10a,b) provided further evidence for the formation of ordered structures in both cases. In addition, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) element mapping showed that Pd and non-Pd elements were homogeneously distributed in individual particles, illustrating the generation of highly alloyed structures without phase separation (Figures S10c,d and S11).

We used two-dimensional 27Al multiple-quantum magic-angle-spinning (MQ MAS) NMR spectroscopy to examine the chemical interaction between the NA-Al2O3 support and i-NPs. For the pristine NA-Al2O3 support, we observed three evident chemical shifts at 14, 41, and 72 ppm, which represent Al3+ ions with octahedral (Al3+octa), pentahedral (Al3+penta), and tetrahedral (Al3+tetra) coordination configurations, respectively (Figure 2c). After Pd3Pb i-NPs were loaded onto the NA-Al2O3 support, the peak intensity of Al3+penta was substantially decreased, indicating that numerous Al3+penta sites were occupied by Pd3Pb i-NPs (Figure 2d). It has been well-established that the Al3+penta sites have an unsaturated coordination nature and can chemically interact with metal species through oxygen bridges. (22−24) Thereby, the advantage of the NA-Al2O3 support in the size control of i-NPs should originate from the strong interactions between i-NPs and Al3+penta sites. In contrast, no Al3+penta sites were found in the Com-Al2O3 support (Figure S12).
We investigated the utility of the Pd3Pb i-NPs toward the semihydrogenation of phenylacetylene. Semihydrogenation of alkynes to olefins represents one of the most important reactions in the polymer industry because the alkyne impurity in the olefin feed stream easily makes catalyst poisoning used for the olefin polymerization. (27−29) Using Pb to partially poison Pd has been widely regarded as an efficient strategy to block hydrogenation of the C═C bond to improve selectivity. (30−32) We evaluated the catalytic performance of the Pd3Pb/NA-Al2O3 catalyst in an autoclave reactor at 25 °C under 3 bar of H2. Pd3Pb/Com-Al2O3 and Pd/NA-Al2O3-600 were also tested under the same conditions for comparison. Both Pd3Pb/NA-Al2O3 and Pd3Pb/Com-Al2O3 exhibited a high selectivity of >97% when the conversion of phenylacetylene reached nearly 100%, and only a slight decline of selectivity by <6% was observed in both cases when the reaction time was prolonged to 24 h (Figure 3a,b). Rather, we observed a considerable loss of selectivity for the Pd/NA-Al2O3-600 catalyst at high conversions of >99% (Figure S13).

Note that Pd3Pb/Com-Al2O3 required approximately 2 times the reaction time (16 h) to reach near 100% conversion compared with Pd3Pb/NA-Al2O3 (8 h) (Figure 3a,b), suggesting that the activity of the former is much lower than that of the latter. Further, we calculated the apparent turnover frequencies (TOFs). As shown in Figure 3c, the TOF of Pd3Pb/NA-Al2O3 was determined to be 404 h–1, which was almost 4 times higher than that of Pd3Pb/Com-Al2O3 (100 h–1). We attributed the activity advantage of Pd3Pb/NA-Al2O3 to its smaller particle size in comparison to Pd3Pb/Com-Al2O3, thus resulting in increased atom utilization. We further examined the stability of Pd3Pb/NA-Al2O3 by cyclic tests under a partial conversion of approximately 50%. As presented in Figure 3d, the phenylacetylene conversion was well-sustained in the range of 48–53%, with a nearly constant high selectivity to styrene (>98%) throughout the four consecutive cycles.
In summary, we demonstrated a method to realize size control over Pd-based i-NPs by using NA-Al2O3 as the support. We confirmed that the ability of the NA-Al2O3 support for stabilizing Pd-based i-NPs originated from the strong metal–support interaction between Al3+penta sites and Pd-based i-NPs. Benefiting from the well-controlled particle size, the NA-Al2O3-supported Pd3Pb i-NPs exhibited enhanced catalytic activity. We expect that this Al3+penta site anchoring approach can be further generalized to the size control of other i-NPs, with application potentials for diverse reactions.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
