Identification of the Intrinsic Active Site in Phase-Pure M1 Catalysts for Oxidation Dehydrogenation of Ethane by Density Functional Theory Calculations
Abstract
Heterogeneous catalysts for alkane conversion reactions are required to possess both high activity for C–H bond cleavage and selectivity to target products. This work employed an atomic substitution strategy to investigate the active site of the phase-pure M1 MoVNbTeOx catalyst for the oxidation dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) reaction. Density of states and crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) based on density functional theory calculations indicated that the transition metal–O (M–O) bonds were weakened after H adsorption. Both integrated COHP and Bader charge were useful descriptors to correlate the electronic structure with catalytic performance. The results showed that the content of V in phase-pure M1 catalysts had a linear relationship with ethane conversion. Synergetic interactions between Te–O and V–O sites were accordingly considered as the intrinsic active sites for the ODHE reaction.

C1–C3 light alkanes, the main components of shale gas, can be directly converted into other value-added chemicals (i.e., olefins, alcohols, acids, etc.) in the chemical industry. (1,2) Alkanes are all closed-shell species, while atoms form σ-type bonds with each other and do not contain non-bonding electrons. (1) The high bond dissociation energy shows that C–H bond cleavage is the rate-determining step for most reactions of alkane conversion, such as steam reforming, (3) dry reforming, (4,5) and selective oxidation. (6) In addition, deep oxidation will produce COx, leading to difficulties in the separation of products. How to activate alkanes selectively is challenging for alkane conversion processes, while heterogenous catalysts play a key role in tuning the balance between activity and selectivity. A number of heterogenous catalysts have been exploited for catalytic conversion of alkane including metal (alloy) catalysts, (7,8) oxide catalysts, (7,9,10) zeolite catalysts, (10,11) and others. (12) Among them, MoVNbTeOx multicomponent metal oxides are promising catalysts for oxidation dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE), oxidation dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), and ammoxidation of propane. (13−15) In addition, the C–H bonds of high-carbon hydrocarbon molecules can be also broken by the MoVNbTeOx catalyst. (16,17) The MoVNbTeOx catalyst is composed of the M1 phase and M2 phase, (18,19) while the (001) lattice plane of M1 phase is considered as the active surface. (15,20) In recent years, the active site on the phase-pure M1 surface has attracted extensive attention. V[+5]–O is widely considered as the active site for C–H bond cleavage. (13,20−22) Nevertheless, the C–H dissociation barrier is lower for the Te–O site in hexagonal channels, (23) while the O– radical formed by Te reduction and inter-related electron transfer under reaction conditions is also considered as the active site. (24) The sophisticated structure of the M1 phase leads to a lack of understanding of the electronic structure and reaction mechanism of C–H bond activation. With increasing computational resources, establishing the structure–activity relationship at an atomic level through density functional theory (DFT) calculations has become a powerful tool for investigating catalytic reaction mechanisms and predicting new materials with high catalytic activity. Deshlahra et al. (25,26) provided the reaction network for ODHE and ODHP including all intermediates and products combined with experiments and DFT calculations. The confinement reaction was also illustrated by choosing light alkane (ethane and propane) as probe molecules. (16,17) Rösch et al. (27−29) analyzed the electron distribution on the M1 (001) plane and established a mathematical model that can predict charge population. However, the active site on the M1 (001) plane is not precisely identified based on the electronic structure. In this work, we constructed different transition metal–O sites on the M1 (001) plane for the ODHE reaction. The characteristics of M–O bonds were examined by DFT calculations of the electronic structures and adsorption behaviors. A structure–activity relationship was established, and the active site for the ODHE reaction was identified at an atomic level.

2.1. Computational Methods
DFT calculations for different metal-modified M1 catalysts were performed by the Vienna ab initio simulation package based on the plane-wave basis set. (30,31) Generalized gradient approximation in the form of PBE functional with DFT-D3 correction was used to describe the electronic energy. (32−34) The kinetic energy cut-off was set at 450 eV, and Gaussian smearing was used with a width of 0.05 eV. Spin polarization was taken into account especially for magnetic metal elements such as Co and Ni. According to the research studies by Deshlahra et al., (17,35) DFT + U was not used for a more suitable description for metal oxide systems. The electronic and geometry structures were converged until the difference of adjacent electronic step energy reached less than 1 × 10–5 eV, and the force for each atom was less than 0.05 eV/Å, respectively. The density of states (DOS) and Bader charge were calculated to analyze the electronic structure. Crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) calculations were performed by the Lobster program package for quantifying the strength of chemical bonds. (36−39) COHP was integrated to the Fermi energy level (ICOHP) to quantitatively characterize the strength of metal–O bonds. The d-orbital projected crystal orbital Hamilton population (dCOHP) and integrated COHP (dICOHP), the contributions between d orbitals of transition metal and O atom orbitals as d-orbital projected density of states, were also calculated.
2.2. Modeling Methods
As that in previous literature studies, (16,17,29,40) the M1 (001) plane was selected in this study to investigate the active site. The structure skeleton of the phase-pure M1 catalyst was formed by Mo and V atoms while these atoms’ locations could be substituted for each other without the damage of the crystal phase. (19,23) The Mo atom in the skeleton position was replaced with other transition metal atoms as shown in Figure 1a. The replaced elements and bond parameters are shown in Table S1. Reconstruction occurred in some modified surfaces after geometry optimization, for instance, Zn as shown in Figure 1b. These surface structures were assumed to be different from the M1 phase and were not investigated in this study. A 1 × 1 unit cell including O–M–O three atom layers was used for modified M1 (001) lattice plane models, and the upper two layers were allowed to relax. The Brillouin zone was sampled with the Gamma point only. The slab model was used with a vacuum of 15 Å. The adsorption energy of species X was calculated by the following equation:

where Eads+X is the total energy of slab and species X adsorbed, Eslab is the energy of modified M1 slab, and EX is the energy of species X in the gas phase, respectively. In this study, X represents H and C2H4, and EH is calculated by 1/2EH2.

2.3. Experimental Methods
The hydrothermal method was used for the preparation of M1 catalysts with different molar ratios of Mo:V:Nb:Te elements. (41) The reaction activity of all catalysts for the ODHE reaction was evaluated by a fixed-bed reactor equipped with online chromatography. 0.1 g of catalysts and 1 g of inert particles were packed and operated at atmospheric pressure and 400 °C with a contact time of 9.26 gcat·h/molC2H6. Under this reaction condition, these catalysts with different element compositions exhibited almost identical selectivity to ethylene (as shown in Table S2). Thus C2H6 conversion was used to represent the catalytic activity (for correlation). The conversion and selectivity were calculated by the following equations:

3. Results and Discussion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In general, H adsorption energy (HAE) on the M–O site is regarded as a descriptor for the C–H bond dissociation barrier for transition metal oxides in heterogeneous catalysis, (35,42) which is consistent with a generalized Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relationship for elementary reaction steps. (43) Liu et al. (17,25) investigated the lattice O activity of MoVNbTeOx and V2O5/SiO2 catalysts based on HAE values and found a linear relationship between HAE values and C–H dissociation barriers as expected.
The change of the M1 phase structure after H absorption was examined first. The change of the geometric structure (bond parameters) before and after H absorption is shown in Table S1. The addition of H lengthens the distance between the transition metal and neighboring O atom. The interaction between metal and oxygen atoms is weakened, attributing to the attraction between oxygen and hydrogen atoms. A similar phenomenon was reported by Xu et al. (44) in perovskite systems. The electronic structure of the M1 phase is influenced by hydrogen adsorption and hydroxyl group formation. For the V-modified M1 surface, the PDOS for V atoms and COHP plot for V–O bonds are shown in Figure 2. Overlapped regions of valence bands are obtained at around −1.4 eV, indicating that polar covalent interaction is formed between V and O atoms no matter whether H is adsorbed or not. (45) Oxygen and hydrogen atoms also form a covalent bond through O-2p and H-1s orbitals. There is a slight difference between the α orbital and β orbital ascribed to spin polarization. The conduction bands composed of V-3d and O-2p orbitals are shifted toward lower energy near the Fermi level after H adsorption. The COHP curves between V and O atoms are composed of positive (representing bonding components) and negative (representing antibonding components) -COHP values, which correspond to the location of covalent bonds and conduction bands in PDOS, respectively. As with the conduction bands in PDOS, the antibonding states in the COHP plot shift near the Fermi level and are partially occupied by electrons after H adsorption, causing the V–O bond to weaken. ICOHP values also demonstrate this result (i.e., the more negative ICOHP, the weaker V–O bond) as shown in Table 1. Similar to PDOS, dCOHP and integrated COHP (dICOHP) were also calculated considering the main contribution of transition metal d electrons. A similar tendency is found as above. Next, we will discuss the electronic structure based on d-orbital contribution to figure out the special properties of transition metals. More information about the electronic structure of other M–O bonds is shown in Supporting Information.

Four typical metal-modified M1 catalysts were chosen to compare C–H bond dissociation activity of different transition metal–O (M–O) sites. We aim to establish a model to describe the structure–activity relationship between electronic structures and HAE values. For these catalysts, the locations of antibonding states shift toward lower energy regions for both the α-orbital and β-orbital as shown in Figure 3a,b. As discussed above, this phenomenon implies the filling of antibonding orbitals by electrons and weakening of M–O bonds. In addition, the dICOHP values could be correlated with HAE values in a linear relationship as shown in Figure 3c, indicating that C–H bond dissociation activity of M–O sites is associated with the strength of M–O bonds. ICOHP could also be an appropriate descriptor to characterize the activity of M1 surface lattice oxygen (please refer to the Supporting Information). It can be found in Figure 3 that the electron distributions of the α-orbital and β-orbital are different, leading to different dICOHP values. In this study, we calculated the average values to establish the correlation with HAE values. On the other hand, β-orbital ICOHP (or β-orbital d-band center) is also used because of the β-orbital occupied by electrons in a higher energy level with higher activity in some literature studies. (46) As discussed above, less negative dICOHP for M–O bonds implies more negative HAE values and higher adsorption ability. Hence, M–O sites on the M1 surface are more reactive for C–H bond activation, corresponding to higher conversion for the ODHE reaction. In addition, hexagonal channels of the M1 phase are occupied by Te–O–Te chairs, and the Te–O site is also regarded as the active site for C–H bond activation based on DFT calculations. (23) Thus, the electronic structure of Te–O bonds was calculated including ICOHP and p-orbital projected ICOHP (pICOHP). It can be seen in Figure 3c that the relationship between the HAE value and pICOHP value of the Te–O bond is in good agreement with this well-established model.

In addition to C–H bond dissociation activity (conversion), selectivity is also a key criterion for catalyst performance. Limited by high computational cost, it is unrealistic to calculate all elementary reaction step barriers and selectivity to specific products. As discussed above, an alternative solution is to use a descriptor to represent ethylene selectivity. Gong et al. (47−49) reported that propylene desorption played an important role in the propane dehydrogenation reaction, and rapid desorption of propylene could avoid deep reactions to improve propylene selectivity. Thus, ethylene selectivity could be scaled with ethylene adsorption energy.
Then ICOHP and dICOHP (Te–O bond: pICOHP) are correlated with the ethylene adsorption energy of different M–O sites, and linear relationships are also obtained as shown in Figure 4a,b, which indicate that ethylene selectivity declines with the rise of ICOHP (dICOHP) values while the conversion improves. The electronic structure shows an opposite effect on conversion and selectivity for the ODHE reaction. This trade-off phenomenon requires that ICOHP values could neither be too positive nor too negative, similar to the Sabatier principle. (50) It is essential to determine the range of ICOHP values for rational design of catalysts. We approximately choose the optimal range of ICOHP (dICOHP) values based on these values of Te–O bonds as shown in Figure 4a,b. Mn–O and Ru–O sites are found in this interval range, indicating that they exhibit a positive effect on the catalytic performance for the ODHE reaction. In our previous work, the addition of MnOx had been proven to improve the reaction performance of the phase-pure M1 catalyst, (51) consistent with our DFT calculation. In addition, the Ti–O site is located in the region of high activity but low selectivity, corresponding to our experimental work that ethane conversion of the M1 catalyst is improved but ethylene selectivity is reduced after the incorporation of TiO2. (52) MnOx and TiO2 are introduced in the form of oxides and play a catalytic role through M–O bond active sites. Their reaction mechanisms are considered to be consistent with our DFT calculations.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Correlation between (a) average ICOHP of the M–O bond; (b) average dICOHP of the M–O bond and H (corresponding to activity) and C2H4 (corresponding to selectivity) adsorption energy, respectively. (b) Tendency of dICOHP and Bader charge of different transition metals; (d) correlation between the Bader charge of the M atom and H and C2H4 adsorption energy, respectively.
ICOHP (dICOHP) values reflect the interactions between M and O atoms, which are associated with HAE and C2H4 adsorption energy. Electronic transfer between M and O atoms is also related to the strength of M–O bonds so Bader charge populations were calculated (in the Supporting Information). As shown in Figure 4c, dICOHP between M and O atoms has a similar tendency to Bader charge of M atoms. Bader charge is used to correlate with the adsorption energy of H and C2H4 (Figure 4d). The linear relationships are also obtained, and a similar model that screens the catalytic performance of M–O sites rapidly is established. The additions of the M–O bond distance also have a linear relationship with HAE values (Figure S2). This phenomenon is explained based on Bader charge of different metal atoms and shorter elongations due to more positive charge of metal atoms. In addition, the d-band center, one of the most important descriptors for transition metals in heterogeneous catalysis, (53,54) is also analyzed (in the Supporting Information), but there is no significant correlation with catalytic performance. As discussed above, it seems that the Te–O site is the optimal surface reaction site for the ODHE reaction among the elements inherent to the M1 phase because of its electronic structure.
To verify the locations of active sites, phase-pure M1 catalysts with different elemental components (normalized based on Nb) were synthesized, and catalytic performances were tested with the identical selectivity under reaction conditions (in the Supporting Information). There is almost no correlation between Te contents and C2H6 conversion as shown in Figure 5a. Te content in M1 catalysts is low while the reduction and migration of Te will occur under reaction conditions. (55) Thus Te–O might be not the single active site for the ODHE process. To identify the contribution of Te–O and V–O sites in the mixed reaction, a detailed derivation was performed (in the Supporting Information), and the dehydrogenation activity is mainly contributed by the V–O site. Then V content is correlated with C2H6 conversion, and a linear relationship is obtained as shown in Figure 5b. Based on this result, we speculate that multiple sites (corresponding to the mixed reaction) might be involved in the dehydrogenation reaction instead of single sites (corresponding to the individual reaction). The locations of active sites are figured out in Figure 5c. Figure 5d shows the reaction coordinate of both the individual reaction and mixed reaction. It is clearly seen that the individual reaction has higher dehydrogenation activity, but the mixed reaction is thermodynamically favorable for the ODHE process (more positive adsorption energy of C2H4 corresponding to higher selectivity to C2H4). The hydroxyl dehydration process was calculated between Te–OH and adjacent V–OH (other mixed reaction coordinates are shown in the Supporting Information).

4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In this work, the atomic substitution strategy was applied to investigate the intrinsic active site in the M1 phase-pure catalyst for the ODHE reaction. The characteristics of the electronic structure and geometry structure were studied by DFT calculations. The addition of hydrogen atoms weakened the M–O bond, and the antibonding states were occupied by electrons. ICOHP and Bader charge were found to be great descriptors for catalytic performance of M–O active sites. Te–O was considered as the optimal active site for the ODHE reaction in the M1 (001) plane combining both conversion and selectivity. M1 phase-pure catalysts with different elemental components were prepared, and the content of V was demonstrated to have a linear relationship with ethane conversion. Mixed reactions between multiple sites were thermodynamically more favorable for the generation of C2H4 in the ODHE process.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
