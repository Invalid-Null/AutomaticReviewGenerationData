Based on my review, the supplied document does not appear to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The document focuses on the synthesis and characterization of iodine(I) and silver(I) complexes incorporating 3-substituted pyridines. While it briefly mentions some reactivity studies with ethers like tBuOMe and iPr2O, it does not discuss the conversion of propane to propylene or include any details related to PDH or ODH catalyst performance. Therefore, I have indicated that the content is not related to propane dehydrogenation in the output.
