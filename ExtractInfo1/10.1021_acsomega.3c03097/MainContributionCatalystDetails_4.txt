The provided document does not contain information directly related to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) for converting propane to propylene. While it discusses the synthesis and characterization of some iodine(I) and silver(I) complexes, it does not examine their usage as catalysts or application to PDH or ODH processes. No catalyst details, performance metrics, or process conditions specific to propane dehydrogenation are presented. Therefore, I cannot extract the requested information about a catalyst's composition, conversion, selectivity, stability, etc. or how it enhances PDH/ODH performance. The content appears to be focused on fundamental coordination chemistry rather than catalysis.
