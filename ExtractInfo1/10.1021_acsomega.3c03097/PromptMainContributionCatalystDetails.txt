Iodine(I) and Silver(I) Complexes Incorporating 3-Substituted Pyridines
Abstract
Building upon the first report of a 3-acetaminopyridine-based iodine(I) complex (1b) and its unexpected reactivity toward tBuOMe, several new 3-substituted iodine(I) complexes (2b–5b) have been synthesized. The iodine(I) complexes were synthesized from their analogous silver(I) complexes (2a–5a) via a silver(I) to iodine(I) cation exchange reaction, incorporating functionally related substituents as 3-acetaminopyridine in 1b; 3-acetylpyridine (3-Acpy; 2), 3-aminopyridine (3-NH2py; 3), and 3-dimethylaminopyridine (3-NMe2py; 4), as well as the strongly electron-withdrawing 3-cyanopyridine (3-CNpy; 5), to probe the possible limitations of iodine(I) complex formation. The individual properties of these rare examples of iodine(I) complexes incorporating 3-substituted pyridines are also compared to each other and contrasted to their 4-substituted counterparts which are more prevalent in the literature. While the reactivity of 1b toward etheric solvents could not be reproduced in any of the functionally related analogues synthesized herein, the reactivity of 1b was further expanded to a second etheric solvent. Reaction of bis(3-acetaminopyridine)iodine(I) (1b) and iPr2O gave [3-acetamido-1-(3-iodo-2-methylpentan-2-yl)pyridin-1-ium]PF6 (1d), which demonstrated potentially useful C–C and C–I bond formation under ambient conditions.

Halogen bonding enjoys being one of the most studied types of intermolecular interactions after hydrogen bonding, and as such has been deftly employed to construct a myriad of magnetic, porous, phosphorescent, and liquid-crystalline materials toward applications such as biomolecular engineering, chemical separations, and ion-pair recognition. (1−3) The incorporation of halogen bond donors into polymers has led to the development of topochemical polymerization, molecularly-imprinted polymers, functional-/stimuli-responsive polymeric materials, (1,2,4) and, most recently, shape-memory polymers. (5) A main advantage of halogen bonding is its highly directional nature, owing to its electronic origin as a σ–hole interaction (i.e., the tightly confined electropositive region along the axis of the halogen bond donor’s R–X bond), (6) which has found great utility in the construction of a variety of supramolecular architectures. (7−14)
The epitome of halogen bonding is the linear halogen(I) (also termed halonium) complexes, (15,16) which comprise a halenium ion (X+; X = Cl, Br, and I) and a pair of stabilizing Lewis bases (L; commonly nitrogen-based aromatic ligands such as pyridine), [L–X–L]+. The stability of halogen(I) complexes follows the trend: I > Br ≫ Cl, (17,18) which is reflected in the number of solid-state examples reported for each type, (19) with Barluenga’s reagent, bis(pyridine)iodine(I) tetrafluoroborate, being the paradigm of iodine(I) complexes due to its widespread use in a multitude of organic transformations as a mild iodinating and oxidizing reagent. (20−24) Halogen(I) complexes, [L–X–L]+, feature a 3-center 4-electron (3c–4e) bond, the symmetric nature of which has been confirmed computationally and in solution. (25,26) The negatively charged [O–I–O]− complexes are also known to have applications as organic reagents, (27) and recently the ability to instigate asymmetry in the halogen bonding, via hydrogen bonding with one of the two saccharinato ligands, in the analogous [N–I–N]− complexes has been demonstrated. (28) Interest in halogen(I) chemistry has been steadily increasing in recent years, with a whole slew of recent advances being reported, including the first examples of unrestrained heteroleptic, (29−31) hierarchical, (32) and nucleophilic interactions of iodine(I) complexes, (33−35) as well as the resurgence of (isolable) non-chiral (24,36−38) and chiral (39) carbonyl hypoiodites in the context of being halogen-bonded iodine(I) complexes.
The aforementioned first report of a hierarchical iodine(I) complex, [I(3-AcNHpy)2]PF6 (1b; 3-AcNHpy = 3-acetaminopyridine), (32) which was concomitantly the first report of an iodine(I) species incorporating a 3-substituted pyridine as the stabilizing Lewis base, displayed unexpected reactivity toward the tBuOMe to give the product 1c (Scheme 1). However, the origin and scope of this reactivity was not fully explored and will be further investigated herein.

A range of 3-substituted iodine(I) complexes of the form [L–I–L]PF6 (L = 3-substituted pyridine; 2b–5b) were synthesized incorporating functionally analogous substituents that would provide insights into the unexpected reactivity of 1b, which included 3-acetylpyridine (2), 3-aminopyridine (3), and 3-dimethylaminopyridine (4). The strongly electron-withdrawing 3-cyanopyridine (5) was also included to provide a more comprehensive overview of the scope of iodine(I) complexes incorporating 3-substituted pyridines, in contrast to the weakly electron-withdrawing (1/2) or strongly electron-donating (3/4) other substituents. The synthesis of the iodine(I) complexes (2b–5b) was achieved via cation exchange of their respective silver(I) complexes, (40,41) [L–Ag–L]PF6 (2a–5a), which themselves were straightforwardly prepared by the addition of two equivalents of each ligand (2–5) to one equivalent of AgPF6 (Scheme 2).

All of the silver(I) and iodine(I) complexes were studied by 1H and 1H–15N heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) NMR studies in CD3CN and, where possible due to its prevalence in prior literature examples, in CD2Cl2, with the exception of 5b for which satisfactory NMR studies could not be performed prior to degradation, as had been observed for its 4-substituted analogue [I(4-cyanopyridine)]PF6. (24) 1H NMR spectroscopy following reaction progression, starting from the uncoordinated ligands (2–5) to the silver(I) complexes (2a–5a) and finally to the iodine(I) complexes (2b–5b), all demonstrated the previously observed general trend of becoming more deshielded. (41−43) The largest shift of uncoordinated ligand to iodine(I) complex of 0.66 ppm was observed for the conversion of 3 to 3b, and the smallest shift of 0.05 ppm was observed between 4 to 4b.
The 15N NMR chemical shifts were determined via 1H–15N HMBC studies, as these have been shown to be particularly responsive and characteristic in halogen(I) chemistry for the pyridinic nitrogen atoms (Table 1). (29,36) Those of the uncoordinated ligands (2–5) in CD3CN all fell within the extremely narrow range of −63.2 (5) to −65.3 (2) ppm. A similarly narrow and characteristic range of 2.0 ppm was observed for the iodine(I) complexes, again in CD3CN, of −175.9 (2b), −173.9 (3b), and −174.0 (4b) ppm, which compared well to that reported for 1b of −174.5 ppm (also in CD3CN). For the two iodine(I) complexes that could also be studied in CD2Cl2, 2b (−175.2 ppm) and 4b (−173.4 ppm), the 15N NMR resonances showed negligible differences of 0.7 and 0.6 ppm (from the CD3CN-recorded chemical shifts), respectively, supporting prior studies indicating the oblivious nature of the iodine(I) center toward external interactions such as with counterions (40) or as found here with potentially coordinating solvents like MeCN. The possibility of MeCN coordinating to iodine(I) centers has been previously explored, and discounted, by Erdélyi and co-workers due to the orbital structure of the iodine(I). (44)

The silver(I) complexes, however, displayed much greater variety in their pyridinic 15N NMR chemical shifts, with a much larger range of values (in CD3CN) from −68.8 ppm (5a) to −103.3 ppm (4a). In contrast to halogen(I), the silver(I) cations are amenable to additional interactions supplemental to their linear coordination geometry, such as from weakly coordinating anions like triflate or potentially coordinating solvents like MeCN (as was reported for 1a). (19,32,43) The necessity of using more strongly polar deuterated solvents like MeCN for the NMR studies, however, does complicate analysis of the solution-state NMR data for complexes 2a–5a, given that the observed 15N NMR chemical shifts will be of an equilibrium of a complicated mixture of MeCN-solvated silver(I) complexes that exist in solution, e.g., 2a·(MeCN)n (n = 0–4). (45,46) Unfortunately, the diminished organic-solvent solubility that results from the Ag+ cations proclivity to facilitate more intermolecular interactions only enabled 4a to be studied in CD2Cl2, with the 15N NMR resonance of −132.3 ppm being significantly different from the one taken in CD3CN (cf. −103.3 ppm). This difference can be explained by the CD3CN solvent coordinating to the silver(I), which the essentially non-coordinating CD2Cl2 solvent is incapable of, as demonstrated recently by solid-state NMR studies of similar silver(I) complexes. (46)
Put in the context of previously reported analogous series of ligand (L) to Ag+ to I+ conversions for the structurally isomeric 4-substituted pyridines, meaningful electronic structure comparisons can be drawn. The 4-substituted analogues of iodine(I) complexes 3b (with different anions other than PF6) and 5b, [I(4-aminopyridine)2][anion] (anion = Cl, IBr2, I7) and [I(4-cyanopyridine)2]PF6, are known; (24,47) however, no 15N NMR data was reported for either of these iodine(I) complexes for comparison. Fortunately, the comparative NMR data for 4-dimethylaminopyridine (4-NMe2py) is available, for which the pyridinic 15N NMR resonances in CD2Cl2 were −108.9 (ligand), −169.8 (silver(I) complex), and −217.8 (iodine(I) complex) ppm, and when compared to those of the analogous series (also in CD2Cl2) of 4 (−67.4 ppm), 4a (−132.3 ppm), and 4b (−173.4 ppm), 4–4b were all observed to be more deshielded (ΔδN) by 41.5, 37.5, and 44.4 ppm, respectively. These differences demonstrate significantly modulated electronic structures in solution, as would be expected for the resonance-favored coordination of 4-NMe2py and the resonance-disfavored coordination of 3-NMe2py.
The solid-state structures were also determined for all silver(I) (2a–5a) and iodine(I) complexes (2b–5b) by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Unlike their halogen(I) analogues with their strong preference for 2-coordinate linear geometries, the silver(I) complexes display a myriad of coordination geometries. (19) Nevertheless, complexes 2a and 4a were observed as the linear 2-coordinate complexes with Ag–N bond lengths of 2.149(3)/2.153(4) Å and 2.118(2)/2.119(2) Å and N–Ag–N angles of 175.9(1) and 174.12(9)°, respectively (Figure 1). Complex 2a was found to be a discrete salt, with the only intermolecular interaction being the acetyl oxygen atoms coordinating to the silver(I) center of a neighboring cation with a Ag···O distance of 2.866(3) Å. On the other hand, 4a was found to be an argentophilic dimer (Ag···Ag = 3.2805(3) Å) that also possessed a close contact between the nitrogen atom of a neighboring NMe2 group and the Ag+ center (Ag···N = 3.217(3) Å) that was just below the sum of van der Waals radii (Ag + N = 3.27 Å).

Interestingly, the solid-state structures for the potentially coordinating 3-substituents in 3 (NH2) and 5 (CN), both returned silver(I) complexes with opportunistically expanded coordination spheres (3a·3 and 5a·5, respectively), with the presence of an additional molecule of their respective ligands (3 or 5) bridging two tetrahedral silver(I) centers to give 1D polymers (Figure 2) with overall ratios of ligand/silver(I) of 2.5:1 (3a·3) and 3:1 (5a·5). These tetrahedral coordination spheres were reproducible from evaporation of an initial 2:1 stoichiometry of the free ligands 3 or 5 with AgPF6, despite being performed in the weakly coordinating MeCN solvent. The MeCN solvent might have aided in satisfying the valency of the silver(I) centers as reported for 1a, (32) though if present, MeCN was ultimately out-competed in favor of the proximal 3-substituted functional groups, NH2 and CN.

The iodine(I) complexes (2b–5b; Figure 3) did not display the same variety of coordination modes as the silver(I) complexes, owing to the linear coordination geometry of the [L–X–L]+ 3-center-4-electron (3c–4e) bond, with 2b–5b all being observed as discrete salts, with two crystallographic polymorphs being observed for 2b (2b_1 and 2b_2). It should be noted that two polymorphs were also observed for 1b, though these occurred from different crystallization temperatures (253 or 298 K). (32) No intermolecular interactions were found for any of the iodine(I) complexes, except for hydrogen bonding of the NH2 group in 3b with the PF6 counterion, and a close contact of the cyano groups of 5b with the I+ center (3.64(1) Å) which is approaching the sum of van der Waals radii (3.53 Å). However, this appears to be a consequence of the packing with all cyano groups coordinating to the H6 (ortho-position) atom of the 3-CNpy ligand of a neighboring [I(3-CNpy)2]+ cation of 5b in a 1D-array (Figure 4). In general, the iodine(I) complexes showed good adherence to linearity, ranging from perfect, symmetry-defined (180°) linear geometries (3b and 5b) to minor deviations from linearity of 178.6(4)° (4b), 177.4(1)° (2b_2), or 174.9(2)° (2b_1). The relative configurations of the 3-substituents of the iodine(I) complexes (2b–5b; Figure 3) in the solid state did not appear to have any correlation with 2b_1, 2b_2, and 4b having syn configurations and 3b and 5b anti configurations, with 1b demonstrating both the anti configuration when crystallized at 298 K and the syn configuration when crystallized at 253 K. The range of I–N bond distances (2.241(3)–2.277(3) Å) for 2b–5b all comfortably fell within the range of values previously reported for known iodine(I) complexes (2.23(1)–2.32(1) Å), (16) the majority of which incorporated 4-substituted pyridine derivatives, (19) with the shortest and longest distances both from 2b_2. The narrow range is unsurprising given the diminished influence of the identity of the substituents due to their 3-positions being resonance-disfavored toward nitrogen coordination, unlike their 4-substituted counterparts. However, given that only seven solid-state examples (from five different species) of iodine(I) complexes incorporating 3-substituted pyridines are known (not including derivatives of isoquinoline), (48) including the five reported herein for 2b–5b, this cannot be analyzed in more detail.

In comparison to the I–N bond lengths of the two polymorphs reported for 1b (cf. 1b_1 = 2.237(5)/2.296(5) Å; 1b_2 = 2.250(5)/2.251(4) Å and 2.253(4)/2.255(4) Å, two crystallographically independent molecules present in the asymmetric unit cell of 1b_2), (32) the I–N bond lengths of 2b–5b are again very similar to each other, many even being crystallographically indistinguishable to a 3σ tolerance, except for the outlying distance of 2.296(5) Å in 1b_1, which deviates significantly from the I–N bond lengths of all six other solid-state structures. It is unclear if this anomalous I–N bond length has any relevance to the differing reactivity observed for 1b in comparison to 2b–5b, though given the values of the other iodine(I) complexes, it is likely just a packing effect that will not persist in solution and therefore will have no bearing on the reactivity of 1b in solution.
While a (relatively) close contact I+···I+ of 3.777(2) Å was observed in the solid-state structure of [I(py)(4-NMe2py)2]PF6 (py = pyridine) (29) and of 3.887(1) Å for a helical bis-iodine(I) complex, (10) both of which are shorter than the sum of van der Waals radii of 3.96 Å, the closest I+···I+ intermolecular distance of 2b–5b observed herein was for 2b_1 (4.3856(5) Å), though it greatly exceeded the sum of van der Waals radii for this potential close contact.
As previously noted for the NMR studies, the 4-substituted analogues of 3b (with different anions other than PF6), 4b, and 5b are known, as are their solid-state structures, (24,29,47) which provide an excellent basis of comparison to structurally assess the impact of structural isomerism (3- vs 4-substitution) on the halogen bonding of the iodine(I) complexes. The halogen bonding of halogen(I) complexes has predominantly been observed to prioritize itself over other electronic structure considerations, which gives rise to the narrow range of solid-state I–N bond lengths despite a wide variety of ligands being utilized in these endeavors. Nevertheless, 4-substituted pyridines like 4-NH2py still impart an electronic structure influence to the halogen bonding motif they are incorporated into, as demonstrated by [I(4-NH2py)2]+ possessing one of the shortest reported I–N halogen bonds. (47)
A comparison of the solid-state structures of 3b with [I(4-NH2py)2]Cl shows that the I–N bond lengths of 3b are longer (2.262(3) Å vs 2.240(3)–2.254(2) Å; two independent molecules present in the asymmetric unit cell), though ultimately overlapping when the error of the measurement is accounted for. A similar trend is observed for 4b (2.253(8) Å) with [I(4-NMe2py)2]PF6 (2.236(3)/2.251(3) Å), as well as for 5b (2.266(4) Å) and [I(4-CNpy)2]PF6 (2.241(4)–2.284(4) Å; three independent molecules present in the asymmetric unit cell). This solid-state data suggests that the stability of iodine(I) complexes incorporating 3-substituted pyridines should be comparable to those observed for the 4-substituted analogues, at least in the solid state. However, the longevity enjoyed by [I(4-NMe2py)2]PF6, (24) which can persist for months at ambient temperature, is not mimicked by 4b or any other of the 3-substituted pyridine iodine(I) complexes. In strong contrast to their 4-substituted pyridine analogues, the iodine(I) complexes 2b–5b were all observed to degrade within days if not kept at reduced temperatures, for example, a freshly prepared sample of 2b (white solid) was observed to completely decompose to a dark brown solid within hours at ambient temperature.
The formation of the reaction product 1c, which entailed the breaking and iodination of a normally inert tBuOMe upon reaction with iodine(I) complex 1b was the first time such reactivity had been observed for an iodine(I) complex. However, when viewed from the broader perspective of being a Lewis acid, the reactivity of the iodine(I) complex 1b toward ethers can be seen as analogous to that reported for other Lewis and Brönsted acids, (49,50) as can the subsequent alkylation of the liberated pyridine-based nucleophile 1. The observation of brominated products from the cleavage of ethers was also noted upon reaction with Br2 when strongly acidic conditions were employed. (50)
The reaction of 1b was found to proceed over several days with a huge excess of tBuOMe, was reliably reproducible, and theorized to originate from 1b acting as a source of “I+” to generate, in situ, the highly reactive IOMe and tBu+ (itself subsequently losing a hydrogen atom to generate 2-methylpropene), instigating the reaction. Extensive 1H NMR studies, attempting to monitor the progression of the stoichiometric reaction of 1b and tBuOMe in CD3CN unfortunately failed to proceed after 72 h. This suggested that the formation of 1c required the enormous excess of tBuOMe to be present to occur in appreciable amounts, which rendered such monitoring 1H NMR studies no longer fit for purpose.
Nevertheless, the scope of the reactivity could still be explored by reproducing the reaction conditions for the synthesis of 1c using other common ethers, with the common laboratory anti-solvents Et2O and iPr2O selected for this purpose. For these solvents, the previously proposed mechanism would therefore generate the hypoiodites IOEt and IOiPr, which was reasonable, however, the accompanying carbocation intermediates of Et+ and iPr+ would be less stabilized than the tertiary tBu+ due to the decreasing stabilization of the positive inductive effect (tBu+ > iPr+ ≫ Et+), with the expectation of the primary carbocation Et+ (and possibly the secondary carbocation iPr+) being too transient for the novel reactivity to be observed here. The probable formation of iPr+, and subsequent conversion to propene via the loss of a hydrogen atom, was demonstrated by the observation of the analogous product 1d (Figure 5) being isolated from the reaction of 1b and iPr2O, though no similar species was observed upon reaction of 1b with Et2O.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Crystal structure of complex 1d, formed upon crystallization of iodine(I) complex 1b in the presence of a large excess of iPr2O (thermal ellipsoids at 50% probability).
There is precedence for the stabilization of carbocations with a pair of Lewis bases in a directly analogous fashion to bis(pyridine)iodine(I) complexes, which may play a role in the mechanism. (51) Additionally, the synthesis of analogous N-alkylated-β-halogenated compounds upon reaction of aromatic amines and alkenes has been reported. (52−54) A tentative mechanism could therefore be suggested from the initial formation of 2-methyl-2-pentene from propene (itself from iPr+) that in turn reacts with a liberated 3-acetaminopyridine ligand and a source of I+ (either the iodine(I) complex 1b or the in situ generated IOiPr) to give 1d. This is supported by the knowledge that 2-methyl-2-pentene can be directly formed from iPrOH, (55) with iPrOI also being a potential chemical precursor. Nevertheless, the exact reaction mechanism for the formation of 1d remains unclear, though it is clear that it involves the addition of two in situ generated propyl fragments and an iodine atom, making it a potential method for creating synthetically useful C–C and C–I bonds in the same vein as the ubiquitous Barluenga’s reagent.
With respect to the breadth of this unexpected reactivity among other structurally related 3-substituted iodine(I) complexes, no analogous reactivity as that observed for 1b with tBuOMe (1c) or iPr2O (1d) was observed for any of the other iodine(I) complexes synthesized herein (2b–5b), indicating that it is likely several properties of 1b that contribute to its reactivity, such as the 3-substitution of the acetamino group, it being simultaneously a hydrogen bond donor (NH) and acceptor (C═O), or a consequence of it being a hierarchical material.
Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Iodine(I) complexes (2b–5b), synthesized via cation exchange from their respective silver(I) complexes (2a–5a), incorporating functionally related substituents to that of the previously reported 1b (including 3-Acpy, 3-NH2py, and 3-NMe2py, as well as 3-CNpy to test the boundaries of iodine(I) formation), were synthesized and studied in both solution (with the exception of the highly reactive 5b) and the solid state for all complexes reported herein. The solid-state structures of 1b–5b represented the only five examples of iodine(I) complexes bearing 3-substituted pyridines (encompassing seven solid-state structures due to 1b and 2b both having two polymorphs), and internal comparisons indicated that these species demonstrated the same consistency observed for all reported iodine(I) complexes in their I–N bond lengths (and N–I–N angles, as expected for halogen bonding originating from a pair of p-hole type interactions), (15,56) with a particularly narrow range of I–N bond lengths of only 0.04 Å (compared to the 0.09 Å of all currently reported iodine(I) complexes). The 1H–15N HMBC determined 15N NMR chemical shifts demonstrated the same general trend of being more shielded going from uncoordinated ligand to silver(I) to iodine(I) complex as previously observed for analogous iodine(I) complexes, though significantly deshielded in comparison to their iodine(I) complexes bearing 4-substituted pyridines, commensurate with the electronic environments of the nitrogen atoms in the 3-substituted pyridines utilized herein. None of the new iodine(I) complexes (2b–5b) demonstrated the same unexpected reactivity as 1b with tBuOMe to give 1c. However, the reactivity of 1b was further extended to a second etheric solvent (iPr2O) to give the N-alkylated salt 1d, which (similar to 1c) included C–I bond formation but also involved synthetically useful C–C bond formation as well, revealing further potential of this serendipitous reactivity if its origins can be fully established.

General Considerations
All reagents and solvents were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. The NMR and solid-state data for 1, 1a, 1b, and 1c have been previously reported. (32) For structural NMR assignments, 1H NMR and 1H–15N NMR correlation spectra were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III 500 MHz spectrometer at 25 °C in CD2Cl2 or CD3CN. Chemical shifts are reported on the δ scale in ppm using the residual solvent signal as internal standard (CH2Cl2 in CD2Cl2: δH 5.32; CH3CN in CD3CN: δH 1.94) or for 1H–15N NMR spectroscopy to an external CD3NO2 standard. For 1H NMR spectroscopy, each resonance was assigned according to the following conventions: chemical shift (δ) measured in ppm, observed multiplicity, observed coupling constant (J Hz), and number of hydrogens. Multiplicities are denoted as: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), m (multiplet), and br (broad). For the 1H–15N HMBC spectroscopy, spectral windows of 4–8 ppm (1H) and 300 or 400 ppm (15N) were used, with 1024 points in the direct dimension and 512 increments used in the indirect dimension, with subsequent peak shape analyses being performed to give the reported 15N NMR resonances.
The single-crystal X-ray data for 1d, 1e·1, 4b, and 4f were collected at 120 K using an Agilent SuperNova dual wavelength diffractometer with an Atlas detector using mirror-monochromated Cu Kα (λ = 1.54184 Å) or Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation. The single-crystal X-ray data for 2a, 3a·3, 4a, 5a·5, and 5b were collected at 120 K using a Rigaku XtaLAB Synergy-R diffractometer with a HyPix-Arc 100 detector using mirror-monochromated Cu Kα (λ = 1.54184 Å) radiation. The single-crystal X-ray data for 3b was collected at 120 K using an Agilent SuperNova dual wavelength diffractometer with a HyPix-Arc 100 detector using mirror-monochromated Cu Kα (λ = 1.54184 Å). The single-crystal X-ray data for 2b_2 was collected at 120 K using an Agilent SuperNova diffractometer with an Eos detector using mirror-monochromated Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation. The single-crystal X-ray data for 2b_1 was collected at 170 K using a Bruker-Nonius Kappa CCD diffractometer with an APEX-II detector with graphite-monochromatized Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation, with the COLLECT program for data collection and DENZO/SCALEPACK for the data reduction. (57,58) All structures were solved by intrinsic phasing (SHELXT) (59) and refined by full-matrix least squares on F2 using Olex2, (60) utilizing the SHELXL module. (61) Anisotropic displacement parameters were assigned to non-H atoms, and isotropic displacement parameters for all H atoms were constrained to multiples of the equivalent displacement parameters of their parent atoms with Uiso(H) = 1.2 Ueq(NH2, NH, aromatic, methylene, methine) or Uiso(H) = 1.5 Ueq(methyl) of their respective parent atoms.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
