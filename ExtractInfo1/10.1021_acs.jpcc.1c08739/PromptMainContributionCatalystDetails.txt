Selective Oxidation of Methane to Formaldehyde over a Silica-Supported Cobalt Single-Atom Catalyst
Abstract
Catalytic oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and methanol has attracted attention because of its advantage in energy efficiency over the conventional multistep reaction process involving endothermic steam reforming of CH4; however, it is challenging to selectively obtain the partial oxidation products in the direct oxidation of CH4. In the present study, Co/SiO2 with various Co loadings was tested for the CH4/O2/H2O gas flow reaction. As a result, Co/SiO2 with a low loading of ≤0.1 wt % showed high selectivity for the partial oxidation reaction and mainly produced HCHO, while Co/SiO2 with high Co loadings proceeded to complete oxidation. Structural analysis using X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and scanning transmission electron microscopy suggested that single Co atoms generated at low Co loadings were effective in the selective oxidation of CH4 to HCHO, while Co3O4 nanoparticles generated at high Co loadings promoted the complete oxidation.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Interest in catalyst technology for the direct conversion of CH4 to HCHO and CH3OH is growing, as natural gas has attracted increasing attention as a hydrocarbon resource for chemicals. (1−4) In the current industrial process, CH4 is converted to CH3OH and HCHO through steam reforming of CH4 to syngas (CO + H2). The steam reforming is an endothermic reaction that requires high-temperature conditions exceeding 800 °C. Therefore, a large amount of energy is consumed in this CH4 conversion process. (1,5) In contrast, the direct synthesis of CH3OH and HCHO by the partial oxidation of CH4 is an exothermic reaction, and therefore, this reaction can be achieved with much less energy. Consequently, the direct partial oxidation of CH4 can greatly reduce the energy required for CH4 conversion. However, CH3OH and HCHO are easily oxidized as compared to CH4, which makes it challenging to obtain the partially oxidized products under relatively harsh reaction conditions for the activation of CH4 with high chemical stability. Therefore, effective catalyst materials and reaction systems for C–H activation have been explored and tested for the selective oxidation of CH4. (3,4,6−8) For instance, it has been found that copper zeolites and supported vanadium catalysts are actively involved in the production of CH3OH and HCHO. (9−13) In the case of Cu zeolites, Cu multimers such as Cu dimers or trimers have been proposed as active species for the oxidation of CH4 to CH3OH. (14−16) In the case of V catalysts, low oligomeric or monomeric VOx species have been proposed as active species for the synthesis of HCHO. (9−11) In addition, supported single-atom transition metal catalysts, including V, Cr, Fe, and Co, are effective in the activation and conversion of hydrocarbons. (17) Furthermore, theoretical calculations have proposed that Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu in zeolites are able to activate C–H of CH4 and produce the partially oxidized compounds. (4) These previous studies suggest that atomicity-specific structures of active metal species, such as multinuclear or single-atom structures, are effective in the selective oxidation of CH4 over supported metal catalysts. In fact, single-atom catalysts of Rh, Fe, Cu, Au, and Pd have been recently reported to show selective oxidation activity for CH4 oxidation using H2O2 as an oxidant. (18−25) However, their catalysis for CH4 oxidation using O2 has not yet been well-investigated.
Cobalt is a highly active transition metal species used for the activation of hydrocarbons. (17,26−30) It is well-known that Co spinel oxides such as Co3O4 and NiCo2O4 exhibit relatively high catalytic activity for complete oxidation of CH4 to CO2. (26−28) However, such Co oxides are in the form of nanoparticles. If Co species form atomicity-specific structures on supporting materials, they may exhibit activity for the selective oxidation of CH4. In fact, in reactions other than CH4 oxidation, the atomicity-specific structures of Co have exhibited unique catalytic performances. (17,31,32) For instance, supported Co sub-nanoclusters exhibit low-temperature activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of cyclohexane. (32) In addition, supported Co single atoms catalyze the C–H activation of hydrocarbons and exhibit high selectivity for propane dehydrogenation. (17,31) Furthermore, computational investigations have suggested that CoOx species in zeolites have the ability to catalyze CH4 partial oxidation. (4) It is expected that supported Co species with atomicity-specific structures will show different selectivity for CH4 oxidation compared to that of CoOx nanoparticles. However, to our knowledge, CH4 oxidation performance of supported Co catalysts having such atomicity-specific structures has not yet been experimentally investigated. In the present study, SiO2 having a relatively high specific surface area was chosen as a support of the Co catalyst to prepare such atomicity-specific structures. SiO2-supported Co (Co/SiO2) catalysts were prepared at various Co loadings to control the structure of Co species and were tested for aerobic CH4 oxidation to investigate the structural effects of Co catalysts.

Catalyst Preparation
Co/SiO2 catalysts with various Co loadings were prepared by impregnation of SiO2 (JRC-SIO-13 supplied by the Catalysis Society of Japan, 336 m2 g–1) in an aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation) at 80 °C. After drying at 110 °C, the catalysts were calcined at 600 °C for 3 h. The prepared catalysts are denoted as X wt % Co/SiO2, where X indicates the Co loadings determined from the amounts of the Co precursor and SiO2 used for impregnation. The specific surface areas and the Co loadings of the prepared catalysts were evaluated by N2 adsorption and X-ray fluorescence (XRF), as shown in Table S1. The surface areas of the catalysts maintained almost the same value as SiO2 before the impregnation and the calcination. The Co loadings evaluated by XRF were in the same order of the Co loadings calculated from the Co precursor used in the preparation.
Catalytic Reaction
CH4 oxidation was performed on a six-line fixed-bed reactor at 0.1 MPa, where six catalysts were tested under the same conditions simultaneously. Prior to the catalytic tests, 50 mg of the catalyst inside each quartz tube (inside diameter = 4 mm) was pretreated at 550 °C under an O2 flow of 1.5 × 10 mL min–1 for 30 min. After cooling to 400 or 500 °C, the pretreated catalyst was purged with a N2 flow of 5.0 × 10 mL min–1 for 30 min. Subsequently, the catalytic tests were conducted under the gas flows of CH4/O2/N2/H2O = 48/2/50/10, 48/2/60/0, or 48/2/0/10 at 1.1 × 102 mL min–1. The effluent gas from each line was trapped at 10 °C and analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) (Agilent 490) to evaluate the CO2 and CO production. The detection limits for CO2 and CO were about 10 and 50 ppm, respectively. The trapped liquid was analyzed by HPLC (JASCO LC-2000 Plus with RI-2031 and UV-2070 detectors) to evaluate the HCHO yield. The liquid was also analyzed by 1H NMR (JEOL JNM-ECZ400R) to evaluate the CH3OH yield. The NMR samples were prepared by mixing 700 μL of the trapped liquid and 200 μL of D2O. The mixed liquid was transferred to an NMR glass tube (3 mm diameter) with an inner tube containing ∼0.03% tetramethylsilane (TMS) solution in CDCl3. The CH3OH yield was corrected by adding the same amount of evaporated CH3OH and calculated using Raoult’s law under 5692 Pa (9.96 °C) of CH3OH vapor pressure. The HCHO yield was not corrected because most of the HCHO was assumed to be hydrated to methanediol (H2C(OH)2), and therefore, the evaporated amount of HCHO was negligible [<0.4% of the total HCHO amount based on the estimation using 16.1 Pa (25 °C) of H2C(OH)2 vapor pressure]. The production rates of all products were evaluated from the total amounts in the reaction for 6 h. The selectivity for HCHO and CH3OH was evaluated based on the amounts of products detected: (HCHO + CH3OH)/(HCHO + CH3OH + CO2).
Characterization
N2 adsorption measurements were performed using a BELSORP mini. XRF measurements were performed using a Rigaku EDXL 300.
Co K-edge X-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) measurements were performed on BL11 at the SAGA Light Source. The XAFS spectrum of 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2 was obtained by a fluorescence method using a silicon drift detector, and those of the other samples were obtained by a transmission method. Data were analyzed using Athena software included in the Demeter package (33)
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out on a K-ALPHA instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Al Kα radiation. The energy was calibrated by referencing the C 1s peak to 285.0 eV.
Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) observations and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mappings were obtained using a JEM-ARM200F microscope (JEOL Ltd.) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The samples were prepared by adding ethanol suspensions of the catalysts onto the carbon-coated grids (QUANTIFOIL R1.2/1.3 on 200 mesh Cu).
In situ UV–vis spectral measurement was carried out on JASCO V-750 equipped with an in situ flow cell (JASCO VHR-764B) having a quartz window. BaSO4 powder was used as a reference for the background spectrum. UV–vis spectra of 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2 were obtained before and after the pretreatment under O2 at 420–501 °C for 30 min and those after flowing wet N2 gas (H2O/N2 = 10/100 mL mi–1), the reaction gas (CH4/O2/H2O/N2 = 48/2/10/50 mL min–1), the oxidation gas (O2/H2O/N2 = 2/10/98 mL min–1), and the reduction gas (CH4/H2O/N2 = 48/10/52 mL min–1) at 387–467 °C. The abovementioned temperature ranges (i.e., 420–501 and 387–467 °C) were measured using a noncontact thermometer detecting infrared radiation at the sample surface in the in situ UV–vis cell when the temperatures in the sample holder of the cell were set at 550 and 500 °C, respectively.
Results and Discussion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Figure 1a shows the product yields of the CH4/O2/H2O flow reaction over the Co/SiO2 catalysts at 400 °C for 6 h (Table S2). For comparison, SiO2, CoO, and Co3O4 were also tested. The catalytic performance of Co/SiO2 varied with the Co loading. The application of 0.05–0.5 wt % Co/SiO2 yielded a significantly larger amount of products as compared with that of SiO2 without Co loading. In the case of low Co loading, that is, 0.05–0.5 wt %, only partially oxidized products, that is, HCHO (main product) and CH3OH (minor product), were produced with 85–89% and 11–15% selectivity, respectively. The increase in the Co loading to 0.25 and 0.5 wt % slightly increased the HCHO yield; however, complete oxidation of CH4 to CO2 also occurred. Further increasing the Co loading to 10 wt % decreased the HCHO yield and increased the CO2 production. In addition, application of CoO and Co3O4 catalysts yielded less amounts of partially oxidized products and showed high CO2 production. The variation in the selectivity of the partially oxidized compounds with different Co loadings is presented in Figure 1b. The selectivity decreased significantly at a Co loading of 0.25 wt %. Afterward, it decreased gradually with the increase in Co loading. Co/SiO2 with a relatively low Co loading of 0.05–0.1 wt % exhibited good selective oxidation activity for the aerobic oxidation of CH4. The turnover numbers (TONs) for 6 h over 0.05 and 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2 were calculated to be 2.4 and 3.9, respectively, based on the loading amount of Co and the total yield of partially oxidized products (Table S2). The TONs suggested that the selective oxidation over 0.05 and 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2 was not a stoichiometric reaction but was a catalytic reaction.

(b) Variation in the selectivity of partially oxidized compounds with different Co loadings in Co/SiO2 for the CH4/O2/H2O reaction.
CH4 oxidation using Co/SiO2 was performed under flow reaction conditions without H2O (CH4/O2 flow reaction) for a control experiment. The results are shown in Figure 2a, where HCHO decreased, and CO2 increased in comparison with the results of the CH4/O2/H2O flow reaction (Figure 1). Figure 2b shows the selectivity of partial oxidation products under the CH4/O2 flow reaction, where the selectivity was obviously lower than that under the CH4/O2/H2O flow reaction (Figure 1b). Therefore, complete oxidation was enhanced without H2O, whereas the presence of H2O vapors was effective for partial oxidation. Presumably, H2O promoted desorption of HCHO from the catalyst surface before successive oxidation of HCHO. In another control experiment, the reaction was performed without O2 (CH4/H2O flow reaction). As shown in Figure 2c, no oxidized products were detected on application of 0.05–0.1 wt % Co/SiO2, and only a small amount of CO2 was yielded on the application of 1–10 wt % Co/SiO2 probably due to stoichiometric reaction between CoOx and CH4. These results confirmed that H2O did not work as an oxidant, and therefore, O2 was responsible for the partial oxidation of CH4 over Co/SiO2 in the CH4/O2/H2O flow reaction.

(c) Results of the CH4/H2O (without O2) flow reaction over Co/SiO2 at 400 °C for 6 h.
The reaction temperature of the CH4/O2/H2O flow reaction over Co/SiO2 increased from 400 to 500 °C. The results of the reaction at 500 °C are shown in Figure 3 and Table S3. On increasing the reaction temperature, the production of HCHO at 0.05 wt % Co/SiO2 increased by ∼ 10 times. Figure 4 shows the TONs and the selectivity for the partial oxidation on Co/SiO2 with various Co loadings. The TONs increased by ∼ 10 times with the increase in the reaction temperature. The TON increased with a decrease in the Co loading, indicating that Co species formed on Co/SiO2 with low Co loadings is relatively active for the CH4 partial oxidation. In the case of the reaction at 500 °C for 6 h, the highest TON was 44 on 0.05 wt % Co/SiO2. These results confirmed that Co species formed on Co/SiO2 with low Co loadings acted as a catalyst for the partial oxidation of CH4 to HCHO. However, the selectivity for partial oxidation decreased on increasing the reaction temperature from 400 to 500 °C. Moreover, the selectivity increased on decreasing the Co loading (Figure 3b), which was similar to the results obtained at 400 °C (Figure 1b). The selectivity of 0.05 wt % was relatively high (75%) at 500 °C. Therefore, Co/SiO2 with low Co loadings was effective for the catalytic partial oxidation of CH4 to HCHO.

To investigate the active Co species for the partial oxidation of CH4, the catalysts were analyzed using Co K-edge XAFS spectroscopy. Figure 5a shows the Co K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of Co/SiO2 with various Co loadings, along with CoO, Co3O4, and Co foil as references (Figure S1). It was observed that the spectral features drastically changed between 0.1 and 1 wt % Co loadings. The spectra of 1–10 wt % Co/SiO2 were almost the same as those of Co3O4. However, the spectrum of 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2 showed an X-ray absorption edge at a lower energy than that of Co3O4 and exhibited the spectral features similar to those of CoO (Figure S1). It suggested that Co(II) species were formed on Co/SiO2 at Co loadings of less than 1 wt %. In addition, the XANES spectral features of 0.01 and 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2 were similar to the previously reported spectra of highly dispersed Co(II) species including Co single atoms and sub-nanoclusters. (17,31,32,34) Additionally, the Co valences of the Co/SiO2 catalysts were analyzed using XPS. The Co 2p XPS spectra of 0.1–10 wt % Co/SiO2 are presented in Figure 6. Satellite peaks owing to Co(II) species were observed in the Co 2p XPS spectrum of 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2. The satellite peaks became much smaller at 1–10 wt % Co loadings in Co/SiO2, which was consistent with the formation of Co3O4, as suggested by the XANES analysis. Therefore, on decreasing the Co loading to less than 1 wt %, the Co species varied from Co3O4 to Co(II).

The structure of the Co species was investigated by Co K-edge extended XAFS (EXAFS) analysis (Figure S2). Figure 5b presents the Fourier transform-EXAFS (FT-EXAFS) spectra of Co/SiO2 (0.1–10 wt % Co loadings) along with the spectra of CoO, Co3O4, and Co foil as references. The spectrum of 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2 was different from those of 1–10 wt % Co/SiO2. The spectra of 1–10 wt % Co/SiO2 were similar to that of Co3O4 with the first shell peak corresponding to Co–O scattering at 1.5 Å and the large second shell peak corresponding to Co–Co scattering at 2.6 Å. The results suggested that 1–10 wt % Co/SiO2 had relatively large Co3O4 particles. 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2 presented the small first shell peak as the CoO reference. In addition, 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2 exhibited much smaller peaks at the second shell compared to that of CoO and the other Co/SiO2 catalysts. The results indicated that highly dispersed CoO species, such as single-atom species, are formed on 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2. The structure of Co/SiO2 catalysts was also analyzed by XRD. As presented in Figure 7, 0.01 and 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2 catalysts showed similar XRD patterns to that of SiO2 and no diffraction lines due to Co3O4. The results suggest the formation of highly dispersed Co species such as single Co atoms and no formation of relatively large Co3O4 particles. In contrast, the XRD patterns of Co/SiO2 with ≥0.5 wt % Co loading exhibited the diffraction lines due to Co3O4, suggesting the formation of Co3O4 particles in the case of ≥0.5 wt % Co loading. The results are consistent with the EXAFS analysis results.
Figure 7
Figure 7. XRD of Co/SiO2 with various Co loadings together with SiO2.
The highly dispersed Co species on 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2 were directly observed at atomic resolution using Cs-corrected STEM (Cs-STEM). A typical high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) STEM image of 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2 is presented in Figure 8a. The contrast of Co species against the SiO2 support was low because of the thickness of SiO2, small difference in the atomic numbers of Co and Si, and some degradation of SiO2 by electron beam. Nevertheless, isolated white spots corresponding to Co single atoms were observed on SiO2, as indicated by the yellow arrows in the figure. During wide-area observation with STEM-EDS mapping, a few small CoOx clusters and no CoOx nanoparticles were observed, as shown in Figures 8b and S3–S5. Therefore, 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2 was mainly composed of single Co atoms. Such small CoOx clusters were not observed in the case of 0.05 wt % Co/SiO2 (Figures S3–S5). Therefore, the presence of these small CoOx clusters might be the cause of lower selectivity of 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2 than that of 0.05 wt % Co/SiO2. For comparison, 1 and 10 wt % Co/SiO2 were observed using STEM-EDS mapping, as presented in Figures 7b and S3 and S4. CoOx nanoparticles were obviously observed. Combined with the results of XPS, EXAFS, and XRD analyses, the observed CoOx nanoparticles were assigned to Co3O4 nanoparticles. Therefore, single Co(II) atoms were formed on Co/SiO2 at low Co loadings (≤0.1 wt %), whereas Co3O4 nanoparticles were dominantly formed on Co/SiO2 on increasing the Co loading.

Based on the aforementioned results, the Co/SiO2 having Co(II) single atoms was active for partial oxidation of CH4 to HCHO and CH3OH. (17,31,34) In order to investigate the reaction mechanism, 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2 was analyzed using in situ UV–vis spectroscopy. Figure 9 shows the in situ UV–vis spectra of 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2 before and after the O2 pretreatment and those after flowing wet N2 gas, the reaction gas, the oxidation gas, and the reduction gas. The oxygen pretreatment increased the absorption at 250–500 and 550–750 nm. The absorption at 250–500 nm was reduced by the wet N2 flow but was still larger than that before the pretreatment. The absorption at 250–500 nm was further reduced by flowing the reaction gas. When the oxidation gas was fed, the absorption at 250–500 nm increased. In contrast, the absorption was reduced by flowing the reduction gas. From these changes, the increase and the decrease in the absorption at 250–500 nm are considered to be due to the oxidation of Co(II) to Co(III) and the reduction of Co(III) to Co(II), respectively. (35,36) Based on the results, the Co(II)/Co(III) redox of the Co species proceeds during the reaction and drives the catalytic partial oxidation of CH4. Furthermore, this in situ UV–vis analysis was also performed in the absence of water. As a result, similar spectral changes were observed as in the presence of water (Figure S6). It seems that water does not have a significant effect on the active species. Water is considered to play a role in desorption of the partially oxidized products from the catalyst surface.
Figure 9
Figure 9. In situ UV–vis spectra of 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2 before (gray) and after the O2 pretreatment (black) and those after flowing wet N2 gas (H2O/N2, blue), the reaction gas (CH4/O2/H2O/N2, red), the oxidation gas (O2/H2O/N2, green), and the reduction gas (CH4/H2O/N2, yellow).
It should also be mentioned that the amounts of partially oxidized products did not change significantly with the varying Co loadings (0.1–10 wt %), but the CO2 production increased significantly (Figures 1a and 3a). The amount of single Co atoms might not be changed significantly on varying the Co loading from 0.1 to 10 wt % during a significant increase in Co3O4 nanoparticles at the Co loadings of >0.1 wt %. Finally, the catalytic activity of Co/SiO2 having single Co atoms is compared to the other reported catalysts. Recently, our research group has carried out the same gas flow reaction using Cu zeolites at 300 °C. When Cu-CHA was used, CH3OH and HCHO were produced with the TON of ca. 10 for 6 h. Since the TON of 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2 was 3.9 at 400 °C, the partial oxidation activity of single-atom Co species is not high compared to the Cu zeolite catalysts (Table S1). However, it is important that Co single atoms were found to have catalytic activity for the partial oxidation of CH4. Future development of single-atom Co catalysts with modification or interaction with supports and ligands as well as the exploration of other metal species is expected to improve catalytic partial oxidation of CH4.
Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Co/SiO2 catalysts with various Co loadings were tested for the CH4/O2/H2O flow reaction at 400–500 °C. At low Co loadings (≤0.1 wt %), CH4 was selectively oxidized to HCHO and CH3OH, whereas at high Co loadings (>0.1 wt %), CH4 was completely oxidized to CO2. The structural analysis of Co/SiO2 using XAFS, XPS, and Cs-STEM showed that Co(II) single atoms were dominant at the Co loadings of ≤0.1 wt %, but Co3O4 nanoparticles became the dominant species with the increased Co loading of >0.1 wt %. The in situ UV–vis spectroscopy analysis of 0.1 wt % Co/SiO2 suggested that the redox of Co(II)/Co(III) of single Co atoms drives the catalytic oxidation of CH4. Therefore, Co/SiO2 having single Co atoms was considered active for partial oxidation of CH4 to HCHO and CH3OH in the CH4/O2/H2O flow reaction. In contrast, the formation of Co3O4 nanoparticles caused complete oxidation of CH4 to CO2. The findings in this study not only exhibited the specific performance of single-atom Co catalysts for the partial oxidation of CH4 but also suggested that the atomicity-specific structure-based catalyst designs were effective for the development of such challenging catalytic reactions.

        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
