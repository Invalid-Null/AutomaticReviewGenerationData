Ultrathin TiOx Nanosheets Rich in Tetracoordinated Ti Sites for Propane Dehydrogenation

Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) exhibits promising potential for propylene production. However, the primary challenge of its application is the development of environmentally benign, low-cost, and high-performance catalysts as alternatives to CrOx- or Pt-based catalysts. This paper describes the design of highly dispersed, around 2-atomic-layer-thick TiOx ultrathin nanosheet catalysts with a high formation rate of propylene (0.175 mol·gTi–1·h–1) and steady-state selectivity toward propylene close to 93% with a low deactivation rate constant (kd) (0.0126 h–1) and robust regeneration performance at 600 °C. A combined study of ex/in situ characterization elucidated tetracoordinated titanium atoms (Ti4c) surrounding oxygen vacancies (Ovac) as the more reactive sites, which effectively promote C–H bond activation and/or H2 desorption by altering the binding state of propane molecules during dehydrogenation and recombining with the H extracted from propane to form H2, leading to more enhanced catalytic activity. This work gives enlightenment to strategy for designing highly efficient oxide catalysts by constructing coordinately unsaturated metal centers in the ultrathin nanosheet structure.

Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as an on-purpose propylene production technology exhibits promising potential. (1) Supported Pt and CrOx catalysts are composed of two major commercial catalytic systems for the Oleflex process from UOP and CATOFIN process from CB&I Lummus. (2) Platinum exhibits superior ability to activate paraffinic C–H bonds. However, the application of Pt is strongly limited by its high expense. (3) In comparison, CrOx systems suffer from heavy pollution and severe deactivation because of carbon deposition and require frequent regeneration during the reaction process. (4,5)
In parallel, the utilization of cheap and environmentally benign catalysts continues to be extensively investigated. Various transition-metal oxide materials including VOx, (6) (6) GaOx, (7) ZnO, (8) and so forth (2) have emerged as promising candidates to catalyze the PDH process with considerable activity and selectivity. Different from the aforementioned oxides, ZrO2, (9) TiO2, (10) (10) and Al2O3 (11,12) have been regarded as inactive supports for propane dehydrogenation. However, recent studies revealed that such oxides also displayed potential activity when transforming from stoichiometric surface to partially reduced one with oxygen vacancies (Ovac) and coordination unsaturated metal cationic sites (Mcus). The active centers were identified as either Lewis acid–base pairs composed of coordinatively unsaturated metal cations and adjacent lattice oxygen near oxygen vacancies (13) or two coordinatively unsaturated cations (14) by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Compared with defect-free ZrO2(111), the C–H bond activation barrier over O-deficient d-ZrO2(111) is lowered by 1.09 eV, changing the rate-determining step from C–H activation to H2 formation (1.40 eV). (14) Several factors influencing the concentration of Ovac and Mcus on the catalyst surface have been proposed including reduction temperature, (15) nanoparticle size, (16,17) crystal phase composition, (16) exposed facets, and doping. (13) For example, the relative fractions of exposed Zrcus vary with nanoparticle sizes and higher propylene formation rates were observed on small nanoparticles with larger fractions of Ovac and Zrcus. (16) Similar results have also been reported for nanosized TiO2 catalysts. (17) Although relevant bulk catalysts have been investigated, the formation and stabilization of a high concentration of coordinatively unsaturated cations on the surface of catalysts during the long-term reaction still suffer.
When exposed to the reaction atmosphere, the active site reconstruction, especially surface adsorbates interacting with the active site during the reaction, can trigger deviation in its geometric and electronic structure, altering the binding states of reactants and intermediates and consequent catalytic behavior. (18,19) In addition, several important studies by Bell and co-workers have shown that cofeeding H2 has a positive effect on activity during alkane dehydrogenation over Pt-based catalysts (20,21) where the increased H coverage on Pt-based catalysts promoted propylene desorption while inhibited deep dehydrogenation, (22,23) leading to higher propylene selectivity and lower coke precursor coverage. However, the detailed mechanism of defective metal oxide surface interacting with absorbates during the PDH reaction remains elusive. (24)
In this paper, we described the construction of an ultrathin TiOx nanosheet structure supported on Al2O3 as a highly active and stable PDH catalyst. The clear monotonous relationship between the concentration of Ovac and tetracoordinated titanium atom (Ti4c) sites and the catalytic dehydrogenation activity validated that the coordinatively unsaturated Ti sites can be identified as the more reactive centers with stronger C–H bond activation ability. Meanwhile, the formation of dynamic H adsorbates on tetracoordinated Ti4c sites during PDH reaction effectively promotes C–H bond activation and/or H2 desorption by altering the binding state of propane molecules during dehydrogenation and recombining with the H extracted from propane to form H2, leading to more enhanced catalytic activity.

2.1. Catalyst Synthesis and Characterization
The TiOx/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by the sol–gel method using HNO3 as a hydrolysis catalyst. Aluminum tri-sec-butoxide (Alfa Aesar, 97.0%) and tetrabutyl titanate (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., 98.0%) used as organic precursors were dissolved in isopropanol with an appropriate amount of the hexadecyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) addition. After 2 h of continuous stirring, an aqueous solution of HNO3 was dropwise added into the precursor solution, followed by a hydrolysis process for 0.5 h under vigorous stirring. Nominal molar ratios utilized were water/isopropanol/acid/CTAB/alkoxide = 20:6:0.2:0.05:1. The obtained alcogels were ripened for a 24 h period, followed by vacuum drying at 70 °C for 18 h. Finally, the gels were held at 250 °C for 2 h and calcined at 600 °C for 4 h. The weight ratio of TiO2/(TiO2 + Al2O3) was determined as 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 1. The commercial rutile (99.8%) and anatase (99.7%) TiO2 were purchased from Aladdin (China) Chemical Co., Ltd. For CrOx/Al2O3 reference catalysts, 20 wt % of Cr was utilized with Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (99.5%, Aladdin (China) Chemical Co., Ltd.). The catalysts were dried for 2 h at 60 °C and overnight at 120 °C, followed by calcination at 600 °C for 3 h.
2.2. Catalytic Test
Catalytic tests were carried out at the atmospheric pressure and 600 °C in a quartz fixed-bed reactor with an 8 mm inner diameter and 24 cm length. 0.3 g of catalyst with a 20–40 mesh size distribution was loaded in a quartz tubular reactor. The catalyst was first pretreated at 600 °C for 1 h under H2/N2. Afterward, the reaction was operated under a mixture of C3H8 (14 vol %) and H2 (14 vol %) in N2 at a total flow of 50 mL/min. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was 2.8 h–1. The product gas was analyzed by an online GC equipped with a flame ionization detector (Chromosorb 102 column) and a thermal conductivity detector (Al2O3 Plot column). The gas-phase selectivity to propylene was determined from eq 1

The long-term regeneration stability tests were performed under the same reaction conditions as the catalytic tests during every cycle. The catalysts were regenerated at 500 °C in air (20 ml/min) for 30 min and sequentially at 600 °C in H2/N2 for 1 h.
2.3. Characterization
XRD measurements were performed with 2θ values between 10 and 90° by using a Rigaku C/max-2500 diffractometer with the graphite-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). XRD measurements were performed with 2θ values between 10 and 90° by using a Rigaku C/max-2500 diffractometer with the graphite-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å).
Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and high-angle annular dark-field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) were carried out on a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope, equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) detector for elemental analysis.
In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained on a Thermofisher ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a monochromated Al Kα as the X-ray source. In situ XPS measurements were performed using a Phoibos NAP-150 hemispherical analyzer from Spec GmbH. The sample was treated with N2, 10 vol % H2/N2, 10 vol % C3H8/N2 at 600 °C inside the XPS system. All binding energy (BE) values were referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV.
In situ Raman spectroscopy was performed using a Raman microscopy system (LabRAM HR Evolution, Horiba Jobin Yvon) with a 325 nm Ar ion laser beam. The powdered sample was filled into the reactor and ramped up to 600 °C with N2. Afterward, the sample was treated with 10 vol % of H2/N2 for 2 h.
Temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) was measured on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument equipped with a Hiden QIC-20 mass spectrometer. 100 mg of catalysts was pretreated at 600 °C for 1 h under 10 vol % of H2/Ar and cooled to 80 °C in Ar. The analysis was carried out in 10 vol % of C3H8/Ar (30 mL/min) from 80 to 1000 °C at 10 °C/min. The output products (C3H8, m/e = 29; C3H6, m/e = 41; H2, m/e = 2 and CH4, m/e = 16) were measured via a mass spectrometer.
Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFTS) spectra of CO chemisorption were collected on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet IS50 spectrometer, equipped with a Harrick Scientific DRIFT cell and a mercury–cadmium–telluride MCT detector cooled by liquid N2. All of the samples were pretreated at 600 °C for 1 h under 10 vol % of H2/He and then cooled to 25 °C in Ar to obtain a background spectrum. Then, CO was injected for 30 min until CO adsorption was saturated, followed by purging with He for 30 min. The spectra were recorded every 1 min.
Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurement was performed with a Bruker EMX-6/1 spectrometer (Germany) at 8.802 GHz (298 K) using a 100 kHz field modulation and a 0.5 G standard modulation width.
The X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectral data at Ti K-edge were collected at the BL14W1 station in Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). The electron storage ring was operated at 3.5 GeV with a maximum current of 250 mA. All samples were pelletized as disks of 13 mm diameter with 1 mm thickness.
2.3.1. Computational Details
Spin-polarized DFT calculation was performed by using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (26) with the projector-augmented wave model. (27) The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) refined by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzernhof (PBE) is used to depict the exchange–correlation effect. (28) Considering incomplete cancellation of the Coulomb self-interaction, an effective Hubbard U of 4.0 eV was applied to the 3d states of Ti. (29−32) The valence wave functions were expanded by the plane wave with a cutoff energy of 400 eV. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a 3 × 3 × 1 k-point mesh for geometry optimization and self-consistent calculations. All of the structures were optimized until the force on each atom was less than 0.02 eV Å–1.

3.1. Preparation and Formation of Ultrathin TiOx/Al2O3 Nanosheets
The TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalyst was synthesized by the sol–gel method with a weight ratio of TiOx/(TiOx + Al2O3) of 1:10 as shown in Figure 1a. For the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the prepared TiOx/Al2O3 catalyst, the diffraction peaks attributed to any crystalline TiO2 were not observed, indicating that TiOx species were thermodynamically stabilized (33) and uniformly dispersed on Al2O3, while for pure TiO2 synthesized by the same method, the diffraction peaks can be assigned to the predominant rutile TiO2 phase (PDF#21-1272) and concomitant anatase phase (PDF#21-1276). Noticeably, in the low-magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of the TiOx/Al2O3 catalyst (Figure 1b), a sheet-like structure was observed with an ultrathin character judging from the nearly undistinguishable contrast, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) analysis (Figure 1e) can capture nanosheets standing on their edges with the thickness estimated to be around 1–2 nm (only nanosheets parallel or at a small angle to the electron beam can be observed, while those perpendicular to the electron beam are difficult to observe due to the ultrathin character). By identifying the lattice fringes as rutile TiO2(210), we assume that the catalyst forms a highly dispersed TiOx ultrathin nanosheet structure.

Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)-mapping analysis over nanosheets captured by the high-angle annular dark-field-scanning transmission microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image (Figure 1f–i) also revealed a uniform overlapping distribution of Al, Ti, and O elements. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis (Figure 1c,d) confirmed that the majority of synthesized nanosheets were around 1.5 nm thick, which agrees well with the estimation from HR-TEM images, with the coexistent small portion of thicker nanosheets. The thicker nanosheets were deliberately intercepted (Figure 1d), and the thickness was around 3.5 nm, which may result from the stacking of nanosheets. According to the thickness of the TiO2 atomic layer measured from its crystal structure in the literature, (34) we suppose the TiOx ultrathin nanosheets are about 2-atomic-layer thick. Based on the relationship between the nanosheet thickness and surface unsaturated coordination ratio over various metallic oxide nanoparticles summarized by Liu et al., (35) a TiOx nanosheet with similar thickness to our catalyst can achieve a surface unsaturated coordination ratio of about 50%, significantly increasing the exposure and concentration of unsaturated Ti sites (Ticus).
3.2. PDH Performance and Regenerability Test
The catalytic performance of various catalysts was examined for propane dehydrogenation under 600 °C. The TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts exhibited exceptionally improved propane conversion (∼30%) and selectivity to propylene (92.3%), almost 3 times the value of commercial anatase TiO2 (7.8%) and rutile TiO2 (10.9%). A physical mixture (1:1 in weight ratio) of Al2O3 prepared by the same sol–gel method and rutile TiO2 showed similar propane conversion (13.7%) with rutile TiO2 itself, ruling out the active contribution of Al2O3 supports to the observed increase in conversion on TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts (Figure 2a). The loading of TiOx was optimized to be 10 wt % by comparing the propane conversion of TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts with 5, 10, and 20 wt % of TiOx (Figure 2b).

(a) Comparison of the conversion of C3H8 and selectivity of C3H6 as a function of time on stream over various catalysts: anatase, rutile, TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts, and physical mixture of rutile TiO2 and Al2O3 synthesized by the sol–gel method. (b) Comparison of the conversion of C3H8 (con.) and selectivity of C3H6 (sel.) as a function of time on stream over TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts with different TiOx loadings, 5–20 wt %. (c) Comparison of the long-term stability test result over TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts. (d) The multicycle regeneration stability test over TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts. Reaction conditions: 0.03 MPa, 600 °C, WHSV: 2.8 h–1, C3H8/H2 = 1/1 with N2 balance, total flow rate: 50 sccm. Regeneration conditions: 500 °C in air atmosphere for 30 min and sequent 600 °C in H2 for 1 h.
During the long-term test for 20 h (Figure 2c), a high steady-state selectivity remained over the TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalyst toward propylene close to 93%, with only a slight decrease in propane conversion from 28.0 to 23.2% at the high formation rate of propylene (0.175 mol·gTi–1·h–1), indicating superior catalyst stability especially when compared with that of CrOx/Al2O3. TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts exhibited an exceedingly lower deactivation rate constant (kd) value (0.0126 and 0.09 h–1 with and without H2-cofeeding, respectively) than that of CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts (0.32 h–1 with H2-cofeeding), which, according to the catalytic performance of oxide-based catalysts summarized in the Supporting Information (Table S1 and Figure S4), outperformed most of the reported TiO2-based and other metal oxide-based catalysts. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) profiles of TiOx/Al2O3 after 20 h of reaction (Figure S5) showed negligible coke deposit (around 4.5 wt % weight loss). In addition, the regeneration stability test result (Figure 2d) confirmed that the initial activity for the TiOx/Al2O3 catalyst can be completely recovered after regeneration and remained stable throughout the whole six consecutive dehydrogenation regeneration cycles, indicating that no obvious sintering or reconstruction occurred over the TiOx ultrathin nanosheet structure and the electronic states and coordination environments of TiOx active sites remained intact during the dehydrogenation and regeneration processes (Figure S7). The improved catalytic activity and excellent regeneration ability, as well as coke resistance of TiOx nanosheet, display huge potential in propane dehydrogenation.
3.3. In Situ Characterization of Tetracoordinated Ti Sites
Surface-sensitive characterization technologies were performed to detect the electronic states and coordination environments of surface defect sites. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFTS) measurements using CO adsorption as a probe over TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts with H2 prereduction were conducted. The intense band was observed at around 2199 cm–1 at the maximum CO coverage, which gradually shifted upward to 2205 cm–1 at a decreasing CO coverage (increasing purging time to 30 min) (Figure 3a). The shifting with CO coverage (purging time) is indicative of changes in lateral interactions within the adlayer of CO oscillators. CO adsorption at frequencies higher than the stretching mode of the free CO molecule in the gas phase is characteristic of adsorption on the positively charged metal oxide sites with the C pointing toward the metal cation and the shift in frequency increases as the strength of the positive field increases. (36,37) Ti ions as positive centers with different coordination configurations are endowed with different polarizing field strengths which increases with the decrease of coordination numbers. (38,39) Meanwhile, they can also be classified as Lewis acid sites with different acidic strengths, which determines the adsorption strength of CO. The adsorption of CO on TiO2 is reported (38,39) to generate two IR bands at 2206 and 2186 cm–1, which were attributed to tetracoordinated Ti4C–CO and pentacoordinated Ti5C–CO complexes, respectively, also evidenced by DFT simulations (Figure S8), and the intensity of the latter decreased drastically when changing the adsorption temperature from low temperature (77–100 K) to room temperature due to the less acidic character of the Ti5C site and the consequent relatively unstable CO adsorbates. The position of the dominating band observed for TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts indicates a high concentration of surface tetracoordinated Ti4C sites adjacent to Ovac after H2 reduction, which agrees well with the coordination numbers of Ti–O determined by XAFS fitting (Figure S9 and Table S1).

(e) Comparison of the initial temperature of propylene formation during C3H8-TPSR profiles on commercial TiO2 and TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts with and without H2 prereduction (TiOx, no red).
In situ Raman spectra for TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts under a H2-reducing atmosphere (Figure 3b) exhibited two sharp bands at 341 and 412 cm–1 and a relatively broadband at 707 cm–1. Noticeably, these bands cannot be assigned to the characteristic bands of the anatase phase at 144 (Eg), 197 (Eg), 399 (B1g), 516 (A1g + B1g), 639 (Eg), and 796 cm–1 (Eg) or the rutile phase at 143 (B1g), 447 (Eg), 612 (A1g), 826 (B2g), and 236 cm–1 (two-phonon scattering band) (34) but more analogous to the O–Ti–O bending mode (338 cm–1) and asymmetric stretching mode (709 cm–1) observed over some doped-titania nanocomposites, (40−42) which is reasonable considering the TiOx nanosheet is only 2-atomic-layer thick, strongly enhancing the interaction with the aluminum oxide support and thus presenting nanocomposite-like features in Raman spectra. The significant variation in Raman bands compared with the TiO2 phase indicated the high distortion of the Ti–O coordination, which further validated the promoted mobility of O and the generation of Ovac and coordinatively unsaturated Ti sites. Also, since the Eg mode (O–O breathing mode along the c-axis) is much more sensitive to oxygen deficiencies than the Ti–O stretching mode, the band at 412 cm–1 tentatively arises from the downshift of the rutile Raman Eg band, suggesting the change in O stoichiometry by a decrease in the O coordination number around Ti sites and/or the creation of Ovac. (43,44) During H2 reduction for around 120 mins, the band shifted to a lower wavenumber of 407 cm–1 and then remained unchanged with the duration of a prolonged reduction time, suggesting the further increase in the concentration of Ovac and Ticus upon H2 reduction.
In situ XPS measurements were further performed to acquire information about the chemical bonding and valence distribution of surface Ti and O species under a dynamic atmosphere (Figure 3c). The catalyst under an inert N2 atmosphere exhibited two peaks centered at about 464.5 and 458.7 eV, which can be ascribed to the characteristic Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 peaks of Ti4+, respectively. (45) After H2 treatment for 1 h, the Ti 2p3/2 peak became asymmetric due to the contribution of the formation of Ti3+ located at a lower binding energy (457.5 eV). The fraction of Ti3+/ (Ti3++ Ti4+) obtained by peak deconvolution confirmed that TiO2 was partially reduced to TiOx species and more O were released from the lattice to generate more Ovac under a H2 atmosphere, consistent with the fitting analysis of O 1s spectra shown in Figure S8 and Table 1 where the growing fraction of Ovac (14.1–22.2%) upon reduction was observed. The relative concentration of Ovac can be precisely manifested by the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra where the signal is exclusively sensitive to the concentration of unpaired electrons and the signal at g = 2.002 corresponds to unpaired single electrons trapped at the Ovac sites, which originate from the removal of O atoms according to the F-center-type O defect formation mechanism. (46) As shown in Figure 3d, while the conventional stoichiometric TiO2 species presented no observable signals, (47) the EPR analysis of the TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts without H2 prereduction exhibited an obvious feature at g ≈ 2.002 whose intensity became stronger after reduction, indicating the abundance of Ovac and corresponding Ticus sites in the as-prepared ultrathin TiOx nanosheet whose concentration was further increased after H2 reduction.

In general, the formation of the unique structure of 2D TiOx ultrathin nanosheets renders an enhancing proportion of Ovac and Ti4c sites on the catalyst surface whose concentration further boosts during the reduction process. The correlation between the concentration of Ovac and Ti4c sites and the C–H bond activation ability was further investigated in an attempt to elucidate the structure–activity relationship by C3H8-temperature-programmed surface reaction (C3H8-TPSR) tests (Figure 3e). The initial C–H activation temperature on commercial TiO2 is around 380 °C and that of unreduced TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts shifted to a lower temperature of around 300 °C, which further decreased to around 220 °C for reduced TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts with higher Ovac and Ti4c site concentrations. The strong correlation between the concentration of Ovac and Ti4c sites and the catalytic dehydrogenation activity implied that the coordinatively unsaturated Ti sites can be identified as the more reactive centers with stronger C–H bond activation ability for propane dehydrogenation reaction.
3.4. Kinetic Relevance and Involvement of Tetracoordinated Ti Sites in PDH
When exposing to the reaction atmosphere, the active site reconstruction, especially surface adsorbates interacting with the active site during the reaction, can alter the binding state of the intermediates and consequent catalytic performance. (18,19) To further monitor the possible dynamic changes in surface active sites and catalytic performance, we dive into the investigations of reaction kinetics. As illustrated in Figure 4a, the cofeeding H2 significantly affected the activity of the prereduced TiOx ultrathin nanosheet catalyst during PDH. The initial propylene formation rate increased from 28.5 to 32.8 mmol gcat–1 h–1 with increasing cofeeding H2 pressure from 0 to 21.3 kPa, completely opposite to the negative trend observed for the prereduced anatase TiO2 (Figures S10 and S11). The calculated reaction positive orders of C3H8 and H2 for the prereduced TiOx nanosheet catalysts are 1.0 and 0.11 (Figure S12), respectively, indicating that H2 cofeeding favors the forward reaction of PDH despite H2 being the reaction product, not matching the traditional kinetic reaction models (H2 order: zero or negative) regardless of which step is identified to be the rate-determining step (RDS). (48) The potential influence of reduction degrees of catalyst on the catalytic performance due to the different H2 pressures during PDH reaction has been excluded since prolonged reduction time and increased reduction temperature exhibited no enhancement in catalytic activity (Figure S13). The dissociative adsorption of cofeeding H2 was further confirmed by the H–D isotopic exchange experiment at 600 °C of prereduced TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts (Figure 4c,d). The resulting presence and absence of HD signal without or with an interval of 30 min of Ar purging when exchanging H2 by D2 indicate the existence of metastable H species adsorbed on the defective TiOx nanosheet surface with abundant Ovac and Ticus sites, which readily desorb upon the removal of H2 feeding at a high temperature (600 °C), while the appearance of the HDO signal, which originated from the combination of the hydroxyl group (Ti–OH) and D atom, was unaffected by the purging step. The different atmosphere-dependent behavior of HD and HDO signals suggests that the metastable H species absorbed on the defective surface are connected to certain sites different from the oxygen sites, representing another form of H-containing adsorbate rather than the hydroxyl group. The involvement of such H-containing adsorbates in the PDH reaction pathway was verified by the C3H8-TPSR profiles of TiOx nanosheet catalysts with prereduction at 600 °C in D2 for 1 h (Figure 4b). After D2 reduction, the catalyst was cooled down to 30 °C with a constant feeding of D2 to retain the forming D-containing adsorbates. The distinct HD signal appearing near the initial C–H activation temperature shows that this D species directly participate in the propane dehydrogenation.

(b) C3H8-TPSR profiles of TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts with prereduction at 600 °C in D2 for 1 h. After reduction, the catalyst was cooled down to 30 °C with constant feeding of D2. Mass spectroscopy signals of H2, D2, HD, H2O, and HDO recorded during the H–D isotopic exchange experiment at 600 °C of prereduced TiOx/Al2O3 nanosheet catalysts without (c) or with (d) an interval of 30 min of Ar purging.
On the basis of the discussion above, we herein propose the kinetic relevance and involvement of tetracoordinated Ti sites as illustrated in Figure 5a,b. The formation of the unique structure of 2D TiOx ultrathin nanosheets renders an enhancing proportion of coordinatively unsaturated Ti4c sites adjacent to Ovac on the catalyst surface, whose concentration further boosts during the H2 reduction process with the generation of a quasi-dative bonding between the Lewis basic terminal hydroxyl group (Ti–OH) and Lewis acidic Ti4c sites. (49) This surface-frustrated Lewis pair (HO–Ti–Ovac–Ti4c) further facilitates the heterolytic dissociation of cofeeding H2 by providing lone-pair electrons in Lewis base and empty orbitals in Lewis acid sites to bind H+ and H-, respectively, generating hydridic H adsorbates on tetracoordinated Ti4c sites, which, according to the projected density-of-state calculation, (50) creates an energy state close to the Fermi level in the band structure as depicted in Figure 5c, altering the binding state of propane molecules during dehydrogenation, and recombines with the H extracted from propane to form H2. The involvement of tetracoordinated Ti as active sites during the PDH reaction derived from the unique structure of 2D TiOx ultrathin nanosheets effectively promotes C–H bond activation and/or H2 desorption, leading to more enhanced catalytic activity.

4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In summary, a highly dispersed, around 2-atomic-layer-thick 2D TiOx ultrathin nanosheet structure was successfully created, with its morphology verified by the combined HR-TEM, EDS mapping, and AFM techniques. A series of ex/in situ characterizations further reveal the surface abundance of Ovac and coordinatively unsaturated Ti4c sites on the TiOx ultrathin nanosheet, whose concentration further boosts during the H2 reduction process, and a clear monotonous correlation between the concentration of Ovac and Ti4c sites and the catalytic dehydrogenation activity, indicating that the coordinatively unsaturated Ti sites can be identified as the more reactive centers with stronger C–H bond activation ability. Meanwhile, the formation of dynamic H adsorbates on tetracoordinated Ti4c sites during the PDH reaction effectively promotes C–H bond activation and/or H2 desorption by altering the binding state of propane molecules during dehydrogenation and recombining with the H extracted from propane to form H2 and desorb, leading to more enhanced catalytic activity. This nanosheet catalyst exhibited an exceedingly lower deactivation rate constant (kd) value (0.0126 h–1) at the high formation rate of propylene (0.175 mol·gTi–1·h–1), which outperformed most of the reported oxide-based catalysts. The effective strategy for generating highly active and stable ultrathin TiOx-based nanosheet catalysts for the PDH process can provide insight into the design of diverse metal oxides with enriched coordination unsaturated metal cation sites for heterogeneous catalysis.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
