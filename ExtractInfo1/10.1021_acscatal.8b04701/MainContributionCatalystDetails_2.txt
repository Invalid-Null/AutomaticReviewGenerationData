 Based on my analysis of the document, this does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses oxidation of propane to acetone and CO2, but does not mention conversion of propane to propylene specifically. Therefore, I do not have relevant information to extract about improvements to propane dehydrogenation catalysts or processes.
