 Based on my analysis of the document, this does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses vanadium oxide catalysts for oxidation reactions, but does not specifically mention their application to propane dehydrogenation. Therefore, I will not extract details about the catalyst performance.
