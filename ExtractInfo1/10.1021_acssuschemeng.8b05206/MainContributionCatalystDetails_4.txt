The document discusses recycling spent Cr adsorbents that were used to remove Cr(VI) from wastewater as catalysts for methyl mercaptan (CH3SH) abatement and propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, it does not specifically discuss propane dehydrogenation to propylene, which is required for it to be relevant. The document focuses on reusing spent adsorbents as catalysts in general, but does not contain details directly related to improving selectivity, conversion or stability of propylene production from propane dehydrogenation.
