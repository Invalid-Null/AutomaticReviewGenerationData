The supplied document does not focus on propane dehydrogenation. It discusses oxidative propane dehydrogenation using sulfur instead of oxygen as the oxidant. As oxidative dehydrogenation does not fit the criteria for propane dehydrogenation specified, I have indicated that the document is not relevant.
