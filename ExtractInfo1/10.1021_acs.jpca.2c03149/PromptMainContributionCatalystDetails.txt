Ultrasmall Cluster Model for Investigating Single Atom Catalysis: Dehydrogenation of 1-Propanamine by Size-Selected Pt1Zr2O7 Clusters Supported on HOPG
Abstract
The selective dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and their functionalized derivatives is a promising pathway in the realization of endothermic fuel systems for powering important technologies such as hypersonic aircraft. The recent surge in interest in single atom catalysts (SACs) over the past decade offers the opportunity to achieve the ultimate levels of selectivity through the subnanoscale design tailoring of novel catalysts. Experimental techniques capable of investigating the fundamental nature of the active sites of novel SACs in well-controlled model studies offer the chance to reveal promising insights. We report here an approach to accomplish this through the soft landing of mass-selected, ultrasmall metal oxide cluster ions, in which a single noble metal atom bound to a metal oxide moiety serves as a model SAC active site. This method allows the preparation of model catalysts in which monodispersed neutral SAC model active sites are decorated across an inert electrically conductive support at submonolayer surface coverage, in this case, Pt1Zr2O7 clusters supported on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). The results contained herein show the characterization of the Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG model catalyst by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), along with an investigation of its reactivity toward the functionalized hydrocarbon molecule, 1-propanamine. Through temperature-programmed desorption/reaction (TPD/R) experiments it was shown that Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG decomposes 1-propanamine exclusively into propionitrile and H2, which desorb at 425 and 550 K, respectively. Conversely, clusters without the single platinum atom, that is, Zr2O7/HOPG, exhibited no reactivity toward 1-propanamine. Hence, the single platinum atom in Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG was found to play a critical role in the observed reactivity.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Endothermic fuel systems are increasingly attractive for their potential role in a variety of technological applications, such as in hypersonic aircraft. (1,2) Such systems require molecular species that can absorb energy to undergo a transformation into product species which are either themselves consumable as fuel or, at the very least, not inhibitive to successive conversion cycles. Much of the work in this area has focused on the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons. (3,4) Of particular promise is the selective dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, i.e., the dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes, which in principle can make effective use of excess thermal energy present in the system to drive the formation of partially dehydrogenated hydrocarbons and H2. (5−7) The selective dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes requires the activation and cleavage of C–H bonds, which typically have a greater bond enthalpy than the C–C bonds within a given alkane molecule. This presents a serious problem during the elevated temperatures required in applications like that of endothermic fuel systems, in which the thermal cracking resulting from C–C bond cleavage is especially problematic. Hence, the use of a proper catalyst, promoting the selective activation and cleavage of C–H bonds, while minimizing the propensity for breaking C–C bonds, is therefore required in such applications.
C–H bonds are known to be closed-shell σ orbitals, (8) requiring activation via a metal or metal oxide catalyst to accomplish practical selective dehydrogenation. (9) By far the most prominent metal catalyst species used for the selective dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons has been platinum. (10) Commercial platinum-based catalysts employed for alkane dehydrogenation have generally consisted of platinum particles supported on a metal oxide, typically Al2O3. (11) In these catalysts, the active platinum species are in the form of small nanoparticles dispersed across the metal oxide support. (12) Such small particles offer a variety of platinum atoms in different coordination environments as opposed to the extended planar facets of large particles and single crystal surfaces. For many heterogeneous catalytic systems, it has long been hypothesized, (13,14) and in some cases already well-evidenced, (15) that coordinatively unsaturated metal atoms associated with defect sites are the primary drivers of catalytic activity. In small Pt nanoparticles, there is a significant relative amount of both coordinatively saturated and unsaturated atoms, associated with terrace sites and step/edge sites, respectively─all of which can contribute to observed activity and selectivity. Further complicating the picture, it has even been shown that for hydrocarbons of different sizes, different activity and selectivity effects can be demonstrated for given active sites. (16) In all known cases, some specific active site is able to activate a host of undesirable side reactions, including thermal cracking, overdehydrogenation, isomerization, and polymerization. (17) One long-standing goal of research in this area has been to understand and minimize these effects.
Even in the presence of a catalyst, dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons requires significant energy input, introducing the potential for coking, i.e., the formation of soot-like carbonaceous deposits, which is known to deactivate catalyst surfaces (18,19) and cause overheating problems in fuel systems. (20) In addition to thermal cracking of hydrocarbons into decreasingly smaller fragments, overdehydrogenation, leading to the formation of alkyne species, is also problematic. There is broad consensus that surface-bound alkyne species are likely coking precursors, (21) and as such, the avoidance of coking requires the selective dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons to alkenes, without further dehydrogenation to alkynes. There has been work devoted to elucidating the coking propensity for a wide variety of platinum-containing systems, ranging from well-controlled ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) studies with model catalysts, including single crystal surfaces, (22,23) to studies of commercial supported nanoparticle catalysts. (24−26)
Especially innovative work by Baxter et al., sought to determine the onset of coking propensity for ultrasmall, size-selected platinum clusters supported on typical oxide surfaces. (27) A comparison of the ethylene dehydrogenation activity of samples prepared by depositing monodispersed Pt4, Pt7, or Pt8 clusters on Al2O3 thin films showed that the Pt7 clusters were especially prone to coking, whereas the Pt4 and Pt8 clusters were not. Supporting theoretical calculations suggested this observed effect was a result of the accessibility of a flat, single-layer cluster geometry for Pt7 clusters supported on Al2O3, allowing a larger number of binding sites active for ethylene dehydrogenation.
Another theoretical investigation sought to compare the observed activities and selectivities for the dehydrogenation of n-alkanes, ranging in size from ethane to hexane, over two distinct forms of platinum, namely, a Pt(111) surface and a Pt55 cluster having a diameter of approximately 1 nm. (28) The results showed that undercoordinated Pt atoms typical of Pt clusters and small nanoparticles demonstrate higher activity for alkane dehydrogenation, but poorer selectivity to forming an alkene which can subsequently readily desorb. This is in agreement with experimental studies which have found the same effects for propane dehydrogenation, namely, an inverse relationship between activity and selectivity with platinum nanoparticle size in the 1–10 nm size regime. (12,16)
Especially useful insights into the role of both geometric and electronic structure of various platinum morphologies on alkane dehydrogenation have been gleaned by fundamental studies of the effects of promoter species included to augment the catalytic properties of platinum-based catalysts. Promoters have been shown to inhibit side reactions by limiting the domain size of the active metal surface (29−31) and by reducing the activity of step edges and corner sites. (32) This ability points toward any ensembles of particularly active atoms, even of the undercoordinated variety, being potentially problematic from the standpoint of selectivity. Another type of effect involves changes to the electronic structure of active sites by the presence of a promoter species, which can either involve changes to the electron density of the active site platinum atoms or a band gap alteration. (33)
These effects have been demonstrated down to the smallest size scales in additional work on size-selected supported platinum clusters involving nanoalloying of Pt7 clusters with either boron (34) or tin (35−37) atoms in an attempt to suppress the coking propensity of the cluster. Incorporation of boron resulted in a cluster that less strongly binds ethylene and is less active for ethylene dehydrogenation, whereas tin resulted in almost complete suppression of ethylene dehydrogenation without reducing the actual binding energy of ethylene. Clearly, electronic and geometric effects can profoundly influence the observed dehydrogenation activity and selectivity of even the smallest assemblies of platinum atoms.
Though much useful knowledge has been gleaned about alkane dehydrogenation over the years, one promising avenue worth consideration for endothermic fuel applications is the use of functionalized hydrocarbons, chosen specifically to bolster the selective endothermic properties of the primary fuel. If properly transformed during the catalytic cycle, such species could potentially give an even higher yield of useful H2, while forming a product species that is especially resistant to coking and other side reactions. Recent work by Gorte et al. demonstrated the endothermic dehydrogenation of 1-propanamine (1-PA) over a ZrO2 powder catalyst to selectively produce propionitrile and H2. (38) This reaction, performed at realistic elevated pressure and temperature conditions, was shown to be highly endothermic and catalytic, with promising activity and selectivity. H2 formed via such a process could go on to be used as a fuel in a subsequent stage, whereas the nitrile formed constitutes a product species that should be relatively resistant to undesired side processes at elevated temperatures, (39) like coking. Hence, the dehydrogenation of functionalized hydrocarbon species like 1-PA over model catalysts merits further investigation at a more fundamental level.
New advances in the nanoscale design tailoring of heterogeneous catalysts offers a chance to further exploit the exotic effects of ultrasmall platinum species. Over the past decade, the long-speculated small-size limit of heterogeneous catalysis, namely, single atom catalysis (SAC), has been convincingly demonstrated. (40−42) The use of an isolated single metal atom, anchored to a support structure, as the catalytically active site offers the prospect of high selectivity for a wide range of chemical reactions. (43,44) Such systems have the added benefit of maximizing the surface-to-volume ratio of active species and thereby limiting the amount of expensive precious metal material required to produce a functional catalyst. Moreover, these systems constitute the epitome of interfacial effects, where the interaction between the single metal atom and nearby support atoms can have an especially pronounced effect on reactivity. Much attention has been paid to SACs of platinum on various supports in recent years, as it is both a widely used catalytic metal and quite expensive. (45) In the context of this study, the combination of single platinum atoms and ZrO2 species is especially relevant because of the ability of Pt (46) and ZrO2 (47,48) each individually to catalyze dehydrogenation reactions, as well as because of the widely known excellent thermal stability of ZrO2 as a support material.
Modeling SAC Active Sites with Small Supported Clusters
By their nature, real SAC systems exhibit a very low metal loading, typically <1 wt % of the single atom metal species. Hence, the vast majority of the atoms composing the metal oxide support have no interaction with the dispersed single metal atoms decorating the surface, making interrogation of the metal–support interface by spectroscopic means highly cumbersome and in many cases intractable. Our concept is to use ultrasmall clusters, wherein a single metal atom is bound to a metal oxide moiety acting as a small portion of the larger metal oxide support, to model isolated active sites of bulk SAC systems. This concept is illustrated below in Scheme 1.
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Illustration Showing an Example of a Bulk Metal-Oxide Supported Single Atom Catalyst and Its Corresponding Small Cluster Model
These clusters, prepared in the gas phase as ions, can then be interrogated by mass spectrometry, and subsequently mass-selected and soft-landed with low kinetic energy, onto a prepared, electrically conductive, cooled substrate, allowing for charge neutralization of the cluster ion to give the corresponding neutral species. A combination of soft landing and low substrate temperature helps to ensure the preservation of the clusters’ structural integrity upon deposition. If the choice of substrate is made such that cluster–support interactions are minimized, the properties of a supported neutral cluster will be primarily governed by its own internal structure, allowing it to more properly mimic an SAC active site. Maintaining a low, submonolayer cluster coverage suppresses the possibility of agglomeration, at least during initial preparation and reactivity experiments, making it more likely that the clusters decorating the surface retain the stoichiometry selected for in the gas phase. A particular advantage of this fundamental approach is that all active atoms in prepared cluster model samples are confined to the topmost surface layer of the substrate, allowing for maximal signal during spectroscopic investigations. By comparison, many bulk SAC systems prepared through other synthetic methods have the active single atom dispersed throughout a porous material or around the three-dimensional structure of much larger nanoparticles. This can often make spectroscopic investigations rather cumbersome and can prevent crucial information about the SAC active site from being readily attainable.
There have been recent reports of SAC materials making use of small clusters as support moieties for an active single metal atom, albeit via an approach wholly different from the experimental concept we propose here. In these works, single metal atoms were preferentially decorated onto the metal oxide cluster nodes of various metal organic frameworks (MOFs). (49−55) Although these materials are structurally distinct from our model samples involving single metal-atom doped metal oxide clusters monodispersed on a crystal support surface, in that the cluster nodes are coordinated within an organic ligand framework, the spirit of the approach is similar. Many of these studies involved the isolation of a single metal atom, having positive charge character, onto a zirconium oxide hexamer cluster node, through which various reactions including ethylene hydrogenation, (49) nitrophenol reduction, (55) CO oxidation, (50) and others were demonstrated. Moreover, the demonstration of real materials in which fairly small metal oxide clusters decorated with a single metal atom serve as the active species further motivates fundamental single atom-doped cluster studies of the kind we report here.
Herein, we report our first application of this experimental approach to investigate the dehydrogenation of 1-PA on a prepared Pt1Zr2O7 SAC model cluster system. To our knowledge, this is the first reported instance of the use of surface supported heteroatomic metal oxide clusters to model the active site of an SAC material. Cluster anions synthesized in a combined magnetron sputtering/inert gas condensation source were transported along an ion optical beamline, analyzed and mass-selected via quadrupole mass spectrometry, and soft-landed onto a prepared highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrate maintained at 100 K under UHV conditions. The model catalysts were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and their reactivity toward 1-PA was investigated via temperature-programmed desorption/reaction (TPD/R). XPS measurements acquired before and after TPD/R experiments served to provide additional insight into the reaction occurring on the model catalysts. The role of the single Pt atom was evidenced by comparing the reactivity observed for the Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG system with that of Zr2O7/HOPG, lacking the single Pt atom. It was found that the presence of the single Pt atom is critical in defining the reactivity toward 1-PA, with Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG exhibiting dehydrogenation of 1-PA to propionitrile and H2, whereas the Zr2O7/HOPG system was inactive, deviating from the activity reported previously for bulk ZrO2 powder catalysts.
Experimental Methods
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
This work was conducted using a newly constructed apparatus with substantial improvements over its predecessor, the latter of which was used in previously published work from our laboratory (56−58) and described in detail previously. (59) The cluster ion beamline was completely redesigned, and the cluster deposition/surface analytical region of the apparatus underwent significant modification, while retaining much of the same analytical instrumentation. A detailed description of the newly constructed apparatus is given in the Supporting Information.
Sample Preparation
The beams of metal oxide cluster anions used in preparing samples were synthesized using our magnetron sputtering/inert gas condensation cluster source, the operative principles of which have been described previously. (51) Both single atom Pt-doped zirconium oxide cluster anions, Pt1ZrxOy–, and the corresponding zirconium oxide cluster anions without the single Pt atom, ZrxOy–, were synthesized via reactive magnetron sputtering using a gas mixture of argon (Airgas, 99.999%) and helium (Airgas, 99.999%), administered via dosing valves (Leybold 28341) each with a backing pressure of 30 psi, seeded with oxygen (Airgas, 99.994%) using a precision dosing valve (INFICON, VDH016-x) with an O2 backing pressure of 15 psi. The Pt1Zr2O7– species were formed using a pure zirconium metal sputtering target (Kurt J. Lesker, grade 702) onto which several thin Pt metal strips (1 × 10 mm) were spot-welded within the sputtered region of the target. The ZrxOy– species were formed using a pure zirconium metal sputtering target (Kurt J. Lesker, grade 702) with no Pt present.
After a cluster anion beam was generated, it was guided by the beamline optics to the inlet of the in-line QMF, where the beam composition was analyzed, and the chosen cluster stoichiometry was mass-selected with suboxygen resolution. Following mass selection, the cluster anions were guided and focused onto a grounded HOPG substrate (Bucker, ZYB grade, 12 × 12 mm2, 2 mm thickness) with an estimated deposition spot size of ∼5 mm in diameter, under soft-landing conditions (<1 eV/atom). The substrate was prepared via mechanical exfoliation in air, and immediately transferred to UHV, where it was annealed (T = 773 K, Δt = 50 min) to ensure a clean surface. Surface cleanliness was confirmed via XPS, and an example survey spectrum of postannealed HOPG is shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). Because of the conductive nature of the substrate, cluster anions lost their charge to the surface upon deposition to become neutral clusters. A digital picoammeter (Keithley 6514) controlled by a custom Labview program designed in-house was used to monitor the resulting cluster discharge current and allowed a retarding bias voltage (−10 V) to be applied to the HOPG substrate surface via an external power supply to ensure soft-landing conditions for the cluster anions. Integration of the measured cluster discharge current over time allowed the calculation of the total number of clusters deposited for a given preparation, assuming one unit of elementary charge per cluster. Samples in the experiments reported here were typically prepared by depositing 5 × 1013 mass-selected clusters onto the HOPG substrate surface. The time required to accomplish a full deposition of this cluster coverage was typically ∼3 h with readily achievable mass-selected cluster anion intensities within our system.
Samples of 1-PA (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99%) were prepared by loading a vessel with ∼1 mL of liquid and attaching it to a bakeable stainless steel vapor dosing setup. 1-PA samples were purified via several freeze–pump–thaw cycles using liquid nitrogen.
X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
XPS measurements were acquired using the nonmonochromatic Mg Kα X-rays (1256.3 eV) generated via the Mg/Al dual anode X-ray source to induce core electron photoemission in the samples, and the kinetic energies of photoemitted electrons were analyzed via the hemispherical electron energy analyzer. All XPS spectra reported were calibrated to a graphitic carbon 1s binding energy value of 284.5 eV. Quantitative data analysis and peak model fitting was performed using CasaXPS (Casa Software Ltd.) software.
Carbon 1s (C 1s) spectra were numerically fitted using an asymmetric Gaussian-broadened Lorentzian peak (A(0.4,0.38,20)GL(20)) for the C 1s transition arising from sp2-hybridized graphitic carbon and a symmetric Gaussian-broadened Lorentzian (GL(30)) peak for the satellite peak corresponding to the π–π* transition in HOPG. A full width half-maximum (fwhm) of ∼1.6 eV was obtained for the sp2 C 1s peaks in all spectra. Oxygen 1s (O 1s) spectra were numerically fitted using Gaussian-broadened Lorentzian peaks (GL(30)) following linear background subtraction. A fwhm of 2–2.3 eV was allowed during initial fitting, with an optimal value of 2.20 eV obtained and thereby constrained for all spectra. Zirconium 3d (Zr 3d) and platinum 4f (Pt 4f) spectra were each numerically fitted with sets of Gaussian-broadened Lorentzian peaks (GL(30)), following Shirley background subtraction. The Zr 3d peak pair was constrained to have an integrated peak area ratio of 3:2 corresponding to the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 states, and a spin–orbit splitting of 2.43 eV. The Pt 4f peak pair sets were each constrained to have an integrated peak area ratio of 4:3, corresponding to the 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 states, and a spin–orbit splitting of 3.33 eV. A fwhm of 1.7–2.5 eV was allowed during initial fitting for both Zr 3d and Pt 4f spectra, with an optimal value of 2.2 eV obtained for each. The constraints for each species were maintained for the fitting of all XPS acquired using a constant analyzer pass energy of 71.55 eV.
Temperature-Programmed Desorption/Reaction
TPD/R experiments were performed by heating prepared samples at a well-controlled linear rate of 1 K/s, positioned in front of the inlet aperture of the low-profile ionization region of the QMS. Temperature programming was accomplished by resistive heating of the HOPG substrate via the current generated by an external power supply (Sorensen DCS 55-55) driven by a programmable PID controller (Eurotherm 2048) interfaced with a thermocouple temperature–voltage converter (Dataexel, DAT4531A) connected to the K-type thermocouple monitoring the substrate temperature. Dosing of 1-PA was accomplished using a variable leak valve (Varian, 951-5106) and simultaneously monitoring the mass fragments indicative of 1-PA (m/z = 30, 59) via the QMS, an example of which is shown in the accompanying Supporting Information (Figure S4), with exposure to 1-PA maintained for 100 s upon attaining a QMS signal of ∼2 × 104 counts for m/z = 30 in all cases. All samples were initially heated via a linear temperature ramp (1 K/s) to 223 K for 300 s as a thermal pretreatment to remove physisorbed 1-PA from the HOPG substrate and then were rapidly cooled to 100 K. The typical desorption profile observed for 1-PA multilayer physidesorption is shown in the accompanying SI (Figure S5). During this pretreatment, the QMS was used to measure the desorption profile of all m/z ratios monitored during the full temperature ramp, with the samples positioned approximately 5 cm away from the inlet aperture to prevent overloading of the SEM detector during the desorption of molecularly adsorbed species. The samples were then positioned to within several millimeters of the inlet aperture and heated via a linear temperature ramp (1 K/s) until reaching a final temperature of 773 K.

Cluster Ion Mass Analysis and Deposition
Typical mass spectra collected for beams of Pt1ZrxOy– and ZrxOy– generated by reactive magnetron sputtering are compared in Figure 1.
Figure 1
Figure 1. Mass spectra acquired for cluster anion beams generated by magnetron sputtering of Pt/Zr (blue) and Zr (black) targets.
Comparison of the mass spectra acquired for each sputtering target composition allows the confident assignment of Pt-containing clusters to candidate peaks based on the coincidence of their presence in the Pt1ZrxOy– beam and their absence from the ZrxOy– beam. Moreover, the assigned Pt1ZrxOy– peaks in Figure 1 clearly show why the Pt1Zr2O7 cluster was chosen for these experiments, as it is the most readily attainable cluster stoichiometry in which the Zr content exceeds that of Pt, and this cluster gives a clean peak in the mass spectrum with virtually no overlap with other species.
Ensuring soft-landing conditions is critical in the preparation of supported size-selected cluster samples. If clusters are deposited with excessive kinetic energy, fragmentation of the clusters and surface damage to the substrate become highly likely. (60,61) Hence, for typical cluster beamline conditions, the energy of mass-selected clusters deposited onto a prepared HOPG substrate was determined empirically via retarding field analysis. Assuming one unit of elementary charge per cluster ion, the energy spread of the cluster beam can be calculated by taking the negative first derivative of the measured discharge current as a function of voltage bias applied to the substrate. The result of this analysis is shown in Figure S3 within the Supporting Information. Based on the calculated beam energy distribution shown in Figure S2, virtually all cluster anions impinging on the surface do so with between ∼7.3 and 21.3 eV of total energy per cluster, corresponding to an energy range of 0.73–2.13 eV/atom for each cluster. During depositions for preparing supported cluster samples, the HOPG substrate was maintained at approximately −10 V, the maximum bias possible before considerable degradation of the deposition current was observed. This ensured that all deposited cluster ions were well below the 1 eV/atom threshold for soft-landing conditions.
Though great care was taken to ensure that samples of intact, monodispersed clusters were prepared on the HOPG support, it is still possible for clusters to become mobile on the support surface after deposition. This is especially true for substrates where the cluster–support interaction is quite weak, as is known to be the case for HOPG. (62−65) The low temperature of the substrate (100 K) maintained via LN2-cooling should minimize this phenomenon during cluster deposition and reactant dosing, but the propensity for cluster mobilization and diffusion across the surface will likely increase with increasing surface temperature. Previous work in this laboratory sought to compare the propensities of size-selected metal and metal oxide clusters for diffusion on a defect-free HOPG surface. (59) A comparison of STM imaging done for samples prepared via soft landing at room temperature of exclusively Mo100±2.5– or (MoO3)67±1.5–, these being metallic and metal oxide clusters having the same nominal mass, found that the metallic clusters were preferentially organized along step edges, while the metal oxide clusters were stochastically distributed across terraces. These observations suggest that, although metal clusters appear to diffuse readily across the surface to find more ideal binding sites, metal oxide clusters of similar mass need not feel such inclination.
In another investigation using metal oxide clusters of similar size to the Pt1Zr2O7 clusters used here, (WO3)3– clusters were soft-landed at submonolayer coverage onto defect-free HOPG at 100 K and were characterized by ex-situ AFM imaging. (66) After exposure to the atmosphere during sample transfer, the clusters were found to have formed two-dimensional, ramified fractal assemblies, which were stable upon annealing to as high as 673 K. Similar structures have been observed and reported by others for samples prepared by depositing small, mass-selected metal oxide clusters onto relatively inert substrates, such as Au(111), in UHV. (67,68) Therefore, even if the supported clusters become mobilized and diffuse across the surface, there is ample evidence that the clusters may indeed not experience transformative agglomeration, that is to say, a complete loss of the model SAC-active site within the initial clusters. The most important factor to ensure here in this study, is the isolation of single Pt atoms, as opposed to the formation of larger Pt particles, during the initial interaction and reaction with 1-PA.
Characterization of Supported Clusters
After mass selection and deposition of the chosen cluster anion species on the cold HOPG substrate, the resulting supported neutral cluster sample was characterized by XPS. The results of XPS measurements for each of the as-prepared cluster samples are shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2
Figure 2. XPS measurements acquired for cluster samples as-prepared in vacuo at 100 K. (a) Pt 4f region for as-prepared Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG fitted with spin–orbit doublets corresponding to Pt2+ (green) and Pt4+ (purple) states. (b) Comparison of Zr 3d and O 1s regions for as-prepared Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG and Zr2O7/HOPG. The Zr 3d region is fitted with spin–orbit doublets corresponding to the Zr4+ state, and the O 1s region is fitted with single peaks corresponding to various oxygen-containing species.
The Pt 4f spectrum is typical of those acquired for a broad range of Pt SACs prepared on a variety of metal oxide supports. (42) In particular, the observed states are in general agreement with measurements acquired for a Pt1/ZrO2 catalyst prepared by Li et al. via atomic layer deposition in their comparison of several synthesized Pt SACs in the room temperature hydrolytic dehydrogenation of ammonia borane to generate H2. (69) The spectrum here for Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG shows that Pt2+ is the predominant state for Pt in the prepared cluster samples, with some Pt4+ present as well. Integrated areal analysis of the spin–orbit doublets fitted to each state allows for quantitative comparison of the prevalence of each state and gives a ratio of 4.6:1 for the relative amount of Pt2+ to Pt4+. Notably, there is no detectable presence of the Pt0 state, indicating that all the Pt atoms in the sample are oxygen-bound, and there is no feature corresponding to metallic Pt, excluding the presence of Pt nanoparticles (70−73) which could form via cluster fragmentation and subsequent agglomeration in a deposition process. (74−77) This supports the successful soft landing of cluster ions at the substrate surface with low kinetic energies. The Zr 3d spectrum acquired for as-prepared Zr2O7/HOPG shows a Zr 3d5/2 binding energy of 182.1 eV, which is consistent with a Zr4+ state. (78−80) By comparison, the Zr 3d5/2 feature for the Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG sample is shifted to a higher binding energy of 182.7 eV, comprising a 0.6 eV binding energy shift. We expect the Pt1-containing clusters to be structured such that the Pt atom is coordinated to oxygen atoms shared with Zr atoms in the cluster. The Zr 3d data observed here support this prospect, in particular there is no evidence of direct bonding, i.e., alloying, of Pt to Zr, which would produce a lower binding energy shift for the Zr 3d feature. (81)
The O 1s spectra have been fit with a semiempirical peak model resulting from comparison between data spanning multiple supported cluster samples and experiments. The peak model fitted to the O 1s spectrum acquired for as-prepared Zr2O7/HOPG suggests the presence of multiple distinguishable oxygen-containing species. The lowest binding energy feature (red) fitted to the O 1s spectrum has a binding energy of 530.4 eV and is attributed to zirconium-bound oxygen, typical of that measured for ZrO2. (82) The next lowest binding energy feature (blue) fitted has a binding energy of 531.6 eV and is consistent with oxygen in various metal-bound hydroxyl species reported in the literature. (83,84) The two higher binding energy features fitted are the results of the cold substrate surface adsorbing residual oxygen containing species from the vacuum chamber volume. This was determined by a series of control experiments performed for our system which show that these features manifest for clean HOPG after cooling to 100 K in vacuo (Figure S6). The intensity of the features increases with time spent at this temperature and decrease because of molecular desorption as the substrate is heated.
A similar peak model can be fitted to the O 1s spectrum acquired for as-prepared Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG, with some slight differences. The lowest binding energy feature (red) fitted to this spectrum is shifted to a lower binding energy of 529.6 eV, comprising a shift of 0.8 eV relative to the metal oxide O 1s feature for Zr2O7/HOPG. This shift is likely because of the presence of Pt-bound oxygen species in the Pt1Zr2O7 cluster, as atomic oxygen chemisorbed to Pt single crystal surfaces has been found to exhibit O 1s binding energies less than 530.4 eV. (85) While occurring at the same binding energy as in the Zr2O7/HOPG sample, the O 1s feature assigned to metal-bound hydroxyl species has an intensity surpassing that of the metal oxide feature. This suggests that Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG has a greater propensity for forming metal hydroxyl species than Zr2O7/HOPG does. The two higher binding energy features are more intense for as-prepared Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG relative to Zr2O7/HOPG, but this is expected in part because of the longer deposition time required because of a lower and less stable mass-selected cluster ion flux for the Pt1Zr2O7– cluster beam compared with that of the Zr2O7– beam in our experiments. This leaves more time for residual species from the vacuum chamber to adsorb onto the cold substrate.
Cluster Reactivity with 1-PA
The reactivity of Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG and Zr2O7/HOPG with 1-PA was probed via TPD/R experiments and XPS measurements. The results of the TPD/R experiments for each supported cluster sample are compared in Figure 3.
Figure 3
Figure 3. TPD/R spectra acquired for prepared cluster samples exposed to a dose of 1-PA in vacuo at a substrate temperature of 100 K and following initial thermal treatment to 223 K. In both cases, the m/z ratios indicative of 1-PA (59), propionitrile (54), and H2 (2) are shown. The signal for m/z = 54 has been corrected for contributions because of fragmentation of 1-PA and the signal for m/z = 2 has undergone subtraction of a rising background feature.
The TPD/R spectrum acquired for Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG exposed to 1-PA shows the desorption of intact 1-PA, along with propionitrile, and H2. The desorption profile for 1-PA closely matches that observed during a control TPD experiment for clean HOPG exposed to 1-PA (Figure S9). Hence, this desorption feature is largely because of 1-PA molecularly desorbed from the bare regions of the HOPG surface or from the sample holder assembly. The desorption profile for propionitrile is centered at 425 K and has been corrected for contribution because of fragmentation of 1-PA. The desorption profile for H2 is centered at 550 K and has undergone the subtraction of a rising background feature, which is present in the signal for m/z = 2 in all TPD/R spectra for our system. The raw TPD/R data acquired for Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG exposed to 1-PA is shown in the accompanying Supporting Information (Figure S7). The desorption of propionitrile and H2 are not observed during control TPD experiments for 1-PA on clean HOPG. In a control TPD experiment performed for as-prepared Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG without 1-PA exposure (Figure S8), some slight desorption of H2 is observed at a slightly higher temperature than that observed during the TPD/R experiment. This weak effect can be attributed to the desorption of H2 resulting from recombination of H atoms from cluster-bound hydroxyl species already present on the clusters, likely because of interaction with adventitious H2 or H2O in the UHV system during the time between the beginning of sample preparation (cluster deposition) and performance of the TPD experiment. Some very slight desorption for m/z = 28 is observed during the control TPD experiment, but notably there is no corresponding desorption signal observed for m/z = 54. This feature is attributed to the desorption of adventitious CO, having adsorbed during sample preparation. Given that some contamination of samples by adventitious species within the system had occurred, attempts were made to minimize the time between initiation of cluster deposition and the performance of measurements for given experiments. For this reason, TPD/R and XPS experiments were always performed on separately, but identically, prepared samples. By comparison of the results of these two experiments, it is apparent that the evolution of propionitrile and H2 stemming from exposure of the Pt1Zr2O7 clusters has occurred.
The TPD/R spectrum acquired for Zr2O7/HOPG exposed to 1-PA is virtually identical to that of the control TPD experiment for 1-PA exposed to clean HOPG (Figure S9). Not only was there no desorption of propionitrile or H2 observed, but neither was there desorption of any other obvious oxidative reaction products that was checked for, including propanamide, propionaldehyde, propylene, propane, or combustion products (see Figure S10). Hence, the reactivity observed for Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG toward 1-PA seems to be intimately dependent on the presence of the single Pt atom.
To further investigate the nature of the reaction between Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG and 1-PA, a series of XPS measurements were acquired immediately following (i) exposure of the as-prepared sample to a dose of 1-PA at 100 K, (ii) thermal pretreatment to 223 K, and (iii) a full TPD/R heating ramp to 773 K. These measurements included the N 1s, C 1s, O 1s, Zr 3d, and Pt 4f core level regions. The spectra acquired for the N 1s region are shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4
Figure 4. XPS measurements for the N 1s region acquired for as-prepared Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG exposed to a dose of 1-PA in vacuo (i) at a substrate temperature of 100 K, and after cooling back to 100 K following (ii) thermal pretreatment at 223 K, and (iii) full TPD/R heating ramp to 773 K.
The feature present after exposing Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG to 1-PA at 100 K comprises a slightly asymmetric feature with a peak binding energy at 399.7 eV, which is consistent with adsorbed propylamine and other primary alkylamines. (86,87) After thermal pretreatment and cooling back to 100 K, the N 1s feature has been dramatically reduced, with a hint of signal within the binding energy range spanning 402 to 398 eV. Unfortunately, because of the low surface coverage nature of the prepared cluster sample and the resulting low density of active adsorption sites, coupled with the low relative sensitivity to nitrogen in XPS measurements, we are unable to extract more useful information about any surface-bound N-containing species for the present system. Moreover, based on the overall signal measured for the Pt 4f region for our samples, even if 1-PA was present at a ratio of 1 molecule per cluster, the expected N 1s signal would be hardly above baseline detection limits within our system. Furthermore, the C 1s signal arising from the HOPG substrate overwhelms any signal present because of carbon in adsorbed organic species like 1-PA or any surface-bound intermediates at such low coverage, making further direct identification impossible.
The corresponding spectra acquired for the Pt 4f, Zr 3d, and O 1s regions for are shown in Figure 5.
Figure 5
Figure 5. XPS measurements acquired for as-prepared Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG exposed to a dose of 1-PA in vacuo (i) at a substrate temperature of 100 K, and after cooling back to 100 K and following (ii) thermal pretreatment at 223 K and (iii) a full TPD/R heating ramp to 773 K. (a) Pt 4f region fitted with spin–orbit doublets corresponding to Pt0 (yellow), Pt2+ (green), and Pt4+ (purple) states. (b) Zr 3d region fitted with a spin–orbit doublet corresponding to the Zr4+ state. (c) O 1s region fitted with singlet peaks corresponding to various oxygen-containing species.
Comparison between the Pt 4f and Zr 3d regions for the as-prepared Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG and following exposure to 1-PA at 100 K shows no discernible difference for the Pt states present but does exhibit a 0.4 eV shift toward lower binding energy for the Zr 3d5/2 peak. This suggests the binding of 1-PA to a Zr atom in the cluster, which is known to occur via the nitrogen lone pair for a number of amines on metal and metal oxide surfaces. (88−90) In the O 1s spectra, the amount of signal arising from metal hydroxyl species relative to that arising from metal oxide species after exposure to 1-PA and subsequent thermal pretreatment, is greater than that for pretreated Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG without 1-PA exposure by ∼25%. This suggests the presence of additional hydroxyl groups after exposure to 1-PA and heating to 223 K, indicating at least some dehydrogenation beginning to occur at fairly low temperature. After a full TPD/R temperature ramp, the total signal for metal hydroxyls has decreased to below that of the metal oxide oxygen. This agrees with the observed liberation of H2 in the TPD/R experiments embodied by the H2 desorption feature. After the full temperature ramp, the Zr 3d spectrum remains largely unchanged, which agrees with the reported high-temperature stability observed for various forms of ZrO2. (91) The Pt 4f spectrum, however, shows a fairly dramatic change, with the complete disappearance of the Pt4+ state, as well as the diminution of the Pt2+ state and the appearance of a dominant feature at 71.7 eV, typical of a Pt0 state for very small forms of Pt. (92)
ZrO2+x Ultrathin Film Reactivity with 1-PA
In order to further investigate whether the lack of observed reactivity toward 1-PA for Zr2O7/HOPG stemmed from the small size of the monodisperse Zr2O7 clusters, an additional experiment was performed involving a substantially higher loading of overly oxidized Zr. A non-mass-selected beam of ZrxOy cluster anions was deposited onto a clean HOPG substrate at 298 K with no retarding voltage, allowing the deposited clusters a greater chance for mobility on the substrate surface. The goal of this deposition procedure was to form an amorphous zirconium oxide sample, with the same overly oxidized nature as the Zr2O7 clusters, but without the monodispersed character of Zr2O7/HOPG. XPS measurements acquired for the prepared ZrO2+x/HOPG sample are shown in Figure 6.
Figure 6
Figure 6. XPS measurements acquired for an as-prepared ZrO2+x/HOPG sample at a substrate temperature of 298 K. (a) Zr 3d region fitted with a spin–orbit doublet corresponding to the Zr4+ state. (b) O 1s region fitted with singlet peaks corresponding to a metal-bound oxygen and organic-bound oxygen.
The Zr 3d region was fitted with a single spin–orbit doublet with a Zr 3d5/2 binding energy of 182.8 eV, in very good agreement with other ZrO2 thin film results reported in the literature. (91) The O 1s region was fitted with two distinct singlet peaks to account for the observed slight asymmetry of the feature, with a dominant singlet at 530.5 eV, assigned to the oxygen bound to Zr, and a weak feature at 532.6 eV, assigned to the oxygen bound to carbon in HOPG. Moreover, integrated areal analysis of these spectra confirmed that the sample was excessively oxidized, with a calculated O:Zr relative atomic ratio of 2.5:1, after accounting for the relative sensitivity to each element. (93)
A TPD/R experiment was also performed for the prepared ZrO2+x ultrathin film following exposure to 1-PA at 100 K. The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 7.
Figure 7
Figure 7. TPD/R spectra acquired for ZrO2+x/HOPG exposed to 1-PA in vacuo at a substrate temperature of 100 K and following thermal pretreatment to 223 K. The m/z ratios indicative of 1-PA, propionitrile, and H2 are shown. The signal for m/z = 54 has been corrected because of fragmentation of 1-PA.
The TPD/R spectrum acquired for ZrO2+x/HOPG highly resembles that of Zr2O7/HOPG. There is no clear feature indicative of propionitrile or H2 desorption, and no evidence was observed for any other oxidation products that were checked for (see Figure S11). Hence, excessively oxidized zirconium in both monodisperse small cluster form and an amorphous ultrathin film form appear to be unreactive toward 1-PA.
Though there has not been much investigation into the propensity for ZrO2 to facilitate the selective dehydrogenation of primary alkylamines to nitriles and H2, aside from early work demonstrating this ability (47) and the recent report by Gorte et al., (38) extensive work has been done to reveal the nature of light alkane dehydrogenation over ZrO2 in various forms. Very compelling experimental studies reported by Otroshchenko et al. strongly evidenced the critical role of coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ cations associated with oxygen vacancies as the active site for dehydrogenating several light alkanes, including propane, isobutane, and n-butane. (94,95) Moreover, it was shown that the inclusion of promoter metal oxide species into the bulk of the ZrO2 catalysts facilitated an increased concentration of oxygen vacancies, which was directly correlated to an increase in dehydrogenation activity. (96) This phenomenon has been observed by others as well, for example, in the promotion of coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ defect density driving an increase in propane dehydrogenation activity. (97) High-temperature reduction treatments were necessary to induce the formation of vacancy sites, which showed marked improvements in catalytic performance over their fully oxidized counterparts. In separate work reported by Zhang et al., it was similarly demonstrated that the cations of oxygen vacancy sites play a crucial role in dehydrogenation activity for nanosized ZrO2 crystallites, with their increasing concentration on smaller crystallites driving an increase in activity upon reducing the size of the crystallites from 43 to 1 nm. (98,99) It is reasonable to expect that such active sites are likely responsible for the dehydrogenation of 1-propanamine observed on bulk samples of ZrO2 as well. This would seem to agree well with the results reported here, as both the monodisperse Zr2O7 clusters and ZrO2+x ultrathin film constitute samples that are severely deficient in the critical oxygen vacancies.
Conclusion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The application of surface supported, mass-selected cluster soft landing in preparing model SAC active sites was reported here for the first time. This was accomplished through the use of a newly constructed cluster ion beamline and surface analytical apparatus. The combination of mass spectrometry and mass-selection predeposition and XPS characterization postdeposition confirmed the successful soft landing of Pt1Zr2O7– cluster anions onto a prepared HOPG substrate, resulting in a monodispersed Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG model SAC system. The reactivity of this system toward a model functionalized hydrocarbon molecule, 1-PA, was investigated via TPD/R and XPS measurements. It was shown that the Pt1Zr2O7 cluster successfully reacted with 1-PA to exclusively form propionitrile and H2, which are the optimal reaction products for endothermic fuel applications. By comparison with Zr2O7/HOPG, it was shown that the observed reactivity for Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG is critically dependent on the presence of the Pt atom, as its absence results in a complete loss of activity. Moreover, it was shown through comparison with an overoxidized ZrO2+x ultrathin film that the inactivity of Zr2O7/HOPG likely results from a lack of oxygen vacancy sites, rather than the monodisperse nature of the Zr2O7 clusters.

Figure 2
Figure 2. XPS measurements acquired for cluster samples as-prepared in vacuo at 100 K. (a) Pt 4f region for as-prepared Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG fitted with spin–orbit doublets corresponding to Pt2+ (green) and Pt4+ (purple) states. (b) Comparison of Zr 3d and O 1s regions for as-prepared Pt1Zr2O7/HOPG and Zr2O7/HOPG. The Zr 3d region is fitted with spin–orbit doublets corresponding to the Zr4+ state, and the O 1s region is fitted with single peaks corresponding to various oxygen-containing species.
Figure 3
Figure 3. TPD/R spectra acquired for prepared cluster samples exposed to a dose of 1-PA in vacuo at a substrate temperature of 100 K and following initial thermal treatment to 223 K. In both cases, the m/z ratios indicative of 1-PA (59), propionitrile (54), and H2 (2) are shown. The signal for m/z = 54 has been corrected for contributions because of fragmentation of 1-PA and the signal for m/z = 2 has undergone subtraction of a rising background feature.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
