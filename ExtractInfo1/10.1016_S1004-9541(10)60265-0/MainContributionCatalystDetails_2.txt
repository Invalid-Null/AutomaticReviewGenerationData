The given document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation. It discusses modeling and simulation of coke combustion regeneration for a Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst used for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide details on improvements to the catalyst composition, structure, or performance. The document focuses on modeling coke combustion during catalyst regeneration rather than enhancing the catalyst activity, selectivity or stability for propane dehydrogenation.
