 Based on the details provided in the document, this does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses size-dependent structures and catalytic properties of supported bimetallic PtSn catalysts in general. While it mentions application in propane dehydrogenation as an example, the main focus is on the characterization of PtSn catalysts with different sizes rather than optimizing propane dehydrogenation specifically. Therefore, I do not have the relevant details to populate the XML output.
