An oxygen-assisted conversion of butanol to value-added products on nanocarbon catalysts: tuning product selectivity via nitrogen doping†
The dehydrogenation of n-butanol (nB) to butyraldehyde and the dehydration to butene are important high value-added industrial processes for the refinery of biomass resources. The present work reported the activity and mechanistic and kinetic analysis of nB conversion on nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube (NCNT) catalysts. NCNT catalysts exhibited an nB conversion of 22% with 73% ODH product selectivity under gentle reaction conditions, which was over 15 times higher than the undoped carbon nanotube. The high ODH activity of NCNT may stem from the donated electrons from nitrogen to ketonic carbonyl groups, which was testified by XPS. In addition, the basic reaction kinetics and mechanism analysis, such as reaction orders, apparent activation energy, and rate determining step for the oxidative dehydrogenation and dehydration of nB were studied systematically, which provided an in-depth understanding of the mechanism and structure–function relations in nitrogen-doped nanocarbon catalyzed redox reactions.
1. Introduction
The conversion of biomass as renewable feedstocks to high value-added products has attracted enormous attention in the field of chemistry, chemical engineering, and materials science facing the ever-increasing demand for green and sustainable development.1–4 The exploration of new catalytic systems for efficient conversion of biomass resources to value-added products becomes one of the key scientific challenges. n-Butanol (nB) is one of the most important new generation biomass platform molecules, exhibiting unique advantages of high calorific value, inexpensive sources of raw materials, and environmental friendliness compared with conventional bio-methanol or bio-ethanol.1,5 The conversion of nB to corresponding butene and butyraldehyde and butyric acid via dehydration and dehydrogenation are feasible routes for fine chemical synthetic industry, and the conventional catalyst systems are normally zeolites,6 mineral acids,7 heteropoly acid compounds for dehydration8 as well as noble metal (Ru, Ag, Au),9,10 iron oxide/molybdenum/vanadium species for dehydrogenation reactions.11 Applications of these conventional precious or toxic metal-based catalysts face severe problems that cannot meet the strict requirement of green chemistry and environmental protection. The substitution of these non-sustainable catalysts with nanocarbon materials becomes one of the most feasible ways for upgrading the related state-of-art chemical industrial process to meet the urgent demand of limited fossil resources, and nanocarbon materials are well proven effective catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation/direct dehydrogenation reactions of alkanes for alkene synthesis, however, using nanocarbon materials as acid/redox bifunctional catalysts for primary alcohol conversions has rarely been reported.12–14
Recently, we have shown that oxidized carbon nanotubes (oCNTs) can catalyze the oxygen-assisted nB conversion with the main value-added products of aldehydes (selectivity at ∼60%) and alkenes (selectivity at ∼30%).1 This new reaction route does not need any non-renewable fossil or metal-based resources since the renewable carbon catalysts and the nB reactants can both be produced from biomass, exhibiting its unique advantages in sustainability and economy.15,16 However, the in-depth understanding of the structure–function relations of nanocarbon catalysts in this acid and redox bifunctional reaction processes, i.e., how the electronic structure influences the acidity and redox ability of nanocarbon and thus the conversion and selectivity of the reaction system, is still one of the most important scientific challenges for the rational design and further development of potential applications for this reaction process.17–20 Aiming at above problems, we have shown the effect of nitrogen doping on the acidity and redox ability of CNTs in the present work, and the synthesized nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (NCNTs) with different nitrogen contents exhibited various electronic structures due to the electron transfer from nitrogen to graphitic carbon lattice,21 which effectively affected the product yield and selectivity of the nB conversion reaction in the presence of oxygen. The present work indicates the potential of nitrogen-modified nanocarbon materials in nB catalytic conversion reactions, and they also built a basic structure–function relation theory for carbon catalyzed acid/base and redox reactions, shedding light on the rational design and synthesis of novel and efficient carbon catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Citric acid monohydrate (C6H8O7·H2O, 99.9%) and n-butanol (C4H9OH, 99.9%) were purchased from Alfa Aesar. Iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, 99.0%), aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O, 99.0%), ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 99.0%), hydrochloric acid and imidazole (C3H4N2, 99.0%) were all purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All the chemicals used in the experiments were used without further purification unless mentioned.
2.2. Synthesis of FeMoAl and NCNT catalysts
In a typical experiment for synthesizing the FeAlMo catalyst, the citric acid monohydrate (11.38 g), iron nitrate nonahydrate (3.38 g), aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (6.82 g), ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (0.35 g) were mixed with deionized water (50 mL) with mild stirring at room temperature. The obtained solution was then dried at 80 °C for 24 h. The collected sample was then thermally treated at 700 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace and was finally labelled as FeMoAl catalyst.
NCNTs were synthesized through a modified chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process.22 FeMoAl catalyst (0.10 g) was heated to 700 °C in a tube furnace, and imidazole (5.0 g) was heated to 250 °C in a separate tube furnace connected to that with the catalysts. Ar was subsequently introduced to the linked furnaces from the imidazole side at a flow rate of 150 mL min−1 for 15 min. The obtained raw products were dispersed in concentrated HCl (50 mL HCl gproduct−1) under vigorous stirring for 6 h at RT to dissolve the metal catalyst. The NCNT products were collected by filtration, washed with H2O until the pH of the filtrate reached 7, and dried in an oven at 80 °C overnight and then grounded to fine powder. The NCNT obtained at different CVD temperatures of 700, 800, and 900 °C were denoted as NCNT700, NCNT800, and NCNT900, respectively. The oxidized carbon nanotube (oCNT) applied for comparison was synthesized following the same procedure as that in our previous work.1 The raw commercial multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT) sample was first washed thoroughly with HCl (hydrochloric acid 37%) to remove metal residue or other impurities, and then it was refluxed with concentrated nitric acid to obtain the oCNT catalysts.
2.3. Catalytic nB conversion reaction in the presence of oxygen
The nB conversion reactions were performed with 100 mg catalysts at a desired temperature using a fixed-bed reactor with He plug-flow. The reactant nB was introduced into the reaction system via a peristatic pumping of the liquid nB and the subsequent gasification process. O2 and balanced He were introduced directly to the reactor by controlling the desired partial pressure with the electronic gas flowmeter. The products were detected by online gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7890B) with both a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
2.4. Characterization of materials
The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded with an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) ESCALAB 250 system equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were recorded with the FEI Tecnai G2 F20 microscope. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were collected on a Micrometrics ASAP 3020 instrument. The Raman experiments were performed on a HORIBA LabRam HR800 Raman spectrometer equipped with a laser source at a wavelength of 532 nm. The thermogravimetric analysis was performed on a NETZSCH STA 449 C.
2.5. Catalytic activity measurement
The conversion of nB (X) is defined as the molar flow rate (μmol s−1) ratio between the converted and added nB (eqn (1)), namely the sum of the quantity of the products divided by that of the reactant nB since the carbon balance (eqn (2)) of the reaction is observed at 100 ± 5%.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Chemical structure of the fresh NCNT catalysts
NCNT materials were synthesized via a modified CVD process for growing carbon nanotubes with imidazole as carbon and nitrogen resources and FeMoAl compounds as CVD catalysts (Scheme 1).21 Taking the sample obtained from the CVD process at 700 °C as an example, the TEM characterization results (Fig. 1) indicated that NCNT700 samples exhibited the typical multi-walled tube structure with bamboo-like morphology, and the mean diameter of NCNT700 was around ∼50 nm. Corresponding elemental mapping results suggested that C, N, and O elements were distributed uniformly in the synthesized NCNT sample, suggesting the successful introduction of nitrogen and oxygen species into carbon nanotubes.

XPS survey spectra further testified that C, N, and O were the only elements that existed in NCNT samples, and the metal catalyst residues (FeMoAl) for the CVD process had been totally removed after acid leaching (Fig. 2a). The surface nitrogen content in NCNT decreased from 8.9 at% to 2.0 at% with the elevation of the synthesis temperature from 700 to 900 °C, showing that the nitrogen content could be effectively controlled by tuning the CVD temperature (Tables 1 and S1†). As shown in Fig. 2b, NCNT samples showed similar N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms exhibiting similar mesoporous morphology. The specific surface areas (SSA) of the NCNT samples were determined using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and the BET surface area of NCNT would decrease from 155 m2 g−1 to 59 m2 g−1 with the CVD temperature increasing from 700 to 900 °C. This phenomenon may be related to the sintering effect and the decrease of nitrogen content with the increase in CVD temperature. The decrease of nitrogen content could decrease the extent of defects or distortion caused by the introduction of nitrogen hetero-atoms due to their larger size than carbon atoms.23 However, Raman analysis (Fig. 2c) suggested that these series of NCNT samples from different synthetic temperatures (700 to 900 °C) exhibited similar ID1/IG values, which was defined as the intensity ratio between the D1 band at ∼1350 cm−1 and G band at ∼1580 cm−1, suggesting their similar degree of graphitization.24 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) on NCNT samples under air atmosphere (Fig. 2d) indicated similar profile shapes due to their similar structures. T50 was defined as the temperature at which 50 wt% of the material decomposed during TGA in air, which also reflected the oxidation stability of the material and the degree of graphitization of carbon materials. As shown in Fig. 2d, T50 values for all the NCNT samples were similar (524, 524, and 525 °C for NCNT700, NCNT800, and NCNT900, respectively), suggesting the similar oxidation stability for these series of samples. In addition, all these three samples will not decompose before 450 °C, showing the operation window and the possibility of these samples for their applications as catalysts for nB conversion in the presence of oxygen. The characterization data on oCNT are shown in Fig. S1 and S2.†

3.2. Catalytic activity of NCNT in nB conversion reactions
The conversion of nB in the presence of oxygen was selected as a model reaction to evaluate the acid and redox catalytic activity of NCNTs. The reaction was performed under gentle reaction conditions (atmospheric pressure, 210–330 °C) in order to ensure the structural integrity of carbon catalysts and evaluate and compare their activity in the kinetic region. The main products for nB conversion on NCNT catalysts in the presence of oxygen included alkenes (1-butene, 2-butene, and 1,3-butadiene) and aldehydes (butyraldehyde and propionic aldehyde) via dehydration and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) routes, respectively, with the slight formation of CO2 as a combustion byproduct.1 The carbon balance of the reaction system was maintained at 100 ± 5%, indicating that the products could be accurately quantified and NCNT catalyst kept its structural integrity under the chosen reaction conditions. As shown in Fig. 3, the NCNT700 catalyst exhibits the highest nB conversion and selectivity to ODH products at 22% and 73%, respectively among all the NCNT catalysts, which should be due to the relatively high surface area and nitrogen content of NCNT700. In addition, the activity of the NCNT catalyst would keep steady for over 12 h without obvious deactivation, suggesting its relatively high stability.
Fig. 3 Catalytic activity (nB conversion and product selectivity) of different NCNT catalysts (NCNT700 (a), NCNT800 (b), NCNT900 (c)), conversion rate of ODH and dehydration reaction normalized by BET surface areas (d)1 (reaction condition: 260 °C, 1.0 kPa nB, 1.0 kPa O2, space velocity 10.7 mL mg−1 h−1, He balance, 100 mg catalysts).
As shown in Fig. 3d, nB ODH conversion rates, which are normalized by catalyst weight and surface area, decreased with the nitrogen content, showing its obvious impact on the catalytic activity. We have shown in our previous work that oxygen functionalities, especially ketonic carbonyl groups are active sites for nB ODH reactions on nanocarbon materials.1 It should be noted that the surface content of functionalities in NCNT and oCNT catalysts were used for analyzing the structure–function relations because this value better represents the surface structure of carbon at a steady state, which can be in situ altered (desorption, generation, and transformation of oxygen functionality, etc.) under ODH reaction conditions. The NCNT catalysts listed in Fig. 3d exhibited similar oxygen content but obviously different catalytic action functionalities may be different. This activity evolution should be attributed to the introduction of nitrogen species, which may affect the electronic structure and influence the intrinsic redox catalytic activity of nanocarbon materials.21,22 It can be observed from Fig. 3d that the ODH conversion rate for NCNT700 increases by over 15 times than that on undoped commercial OCNT catalysts (135.6 × 10−5 μmol s−1 m−2vs. 15 × 10−5 μmol s−1 m−2) under the same reaction condition,1 suggesting the significant improvement effect of nitrogen heteroatoms. In addition, the introduction of nitrogen species also leads to a decrement in butene formation rates, which should be due to the decrease in the acidity of the carbon nanotubes, since carboxylic acid sites (Brønsted acid species) are recognized as the active sites for the dehydration reactions forming alkene molecules.15,25
3.3. Physical chemical nature behind the activity promotion from nitrogen species in NCNT catalysts
Based on the above catalytic activity measurement results, the ODH and dehydration activity of NCNT samples depends strongly on the content of nitrogen and the electronic structure of oxygen functionalities on the catalysts.22,26Fig. 4 shows the XPS analysis results of the spent NCNT and OCNT catalysts after the reaction, which reflects the content and chemical state of nitrogen and oxygen species in the catalysts under reaction conditions. Comparing with fresh nanocarbon catalysts, both nitrogen and oxygen content decrease to a certain degree (Table 2) due to the removal of unstable species, except for the oxygen content in NCNT900 increasing slightly from 3.3 at% to 4.6 at% under reaction conditions, which should be attributed to the partial oxidation of NCNT900 in the presence of oxygen because the oxygen content in NCNT900 is relatively low after high-temperature calcination.27 This phenomenon for the evolution of oxygen species on CNT catalysts could also be observed during the alkane ODH reaction process.28

Deconvolution of N 1s XPS fine spectra yields four typical nitrogen species, including pyridinic nitrogen (N1, BE = 398.2 ± 0.1 eV), pyrrolic nitrogen (N2, BE = 399.8 ± 0.1 eV), graphitic nitrogen (N3, BE = 401.3 ± 0.1 eV) and nitro oxide species (N4, BE = 405.0 ± 0.1 eV).29 In addition to the decrease of the total nitrogen content in NCNT with the increase of the CVD temperature (from 8.5 at% for NCNT700 to 1.8 at% for NCNT900), the ratio among different nitrogen species also varies with the synthetic temperature. The content of pyrrolic nitrogen decreases from 1.7 at% (NCNT700) to 0.7 at% (NCNT800) with the increase in the synthesis temperature from 700 to 800 °C, while the pyridinic nitrogen content is similar for these two samples (2.1 at% vs. 2.0 at%). The pyridinic nitrogen content would only decrease with the synthetic temperature above 900 °C (0.5 at% for NCNT900 vs. 2.1 at% for NCNT700 and 2.0 at% for NCNT800). These regular alternations of nitrogen content are consistent with previous literature results in that nitrogen species are reported to decompose and desorb as NH3, HCN, or N2 molecules, and pyridinic nitrogen shows higher thermal stability than pyrrolic nitrogen species.24
It has been reported that oxygen species, especially ketonic carbonyl groups, are active sites for ODH reactions. The deconvolution of O 1s XPS spectra exhibits four typical oxygen species, including ketonic carbonyl groups (CO, O1 BE = 531.5 ± 0.1 eV), carboxylic acid groups (HO–CO, O2 BE = 532.8 ± 0.1 eV), hydroxyl groups (C–OH, O3 BE = 533.9 ± 0.1 eV) and the adsorbed water (H2O, O4 BE = 535.0 ± 0.1 eV).14,30 However, the binding energy for the first three oxygen functionalities (O1, O2, and O3) gradually shifted to a lower energy position as shown in Fig. 4b due to the introduction of nitrogen species, which would influence the nucleophilicity of oxygen species thus affecting their catalytic activity for C–H bond dissociation and dehydration.31 The doped N, such as graphitic N, refers to nitrogen atoms substituting carbon in the graphitic structure, and it provides two p-electrons into the π-conjugated system. The additional electrons into the delocalized π-system could enhance the electronic spin density and nucleophilicity, as well as the reducibility of the quinone active site.32,33 For example, it has been reported that graphitic N could enhance the activity of nanocarbon in EB dehydrogenation. The ketonic carbonyl group (CO) serves as an active site that directly activates and dissociates the C–H bond, while the graphitic N provides additional electrons leading to the improved chemical reactivity of CO.34
As shown in Fig. 5a, the binding energy of oxygen functionalities decreases with the increasing content of pyridinic (N1) and pyrrolic (N2) nitrogen species, suggesting that these oxygen species may have different chemical activity. We have shown in our previous work that ketonic carbonyl and carboxylic acid groups serve as active sites for nB ODH and dehydration reactions, respectively.1,17Fig. 5b exhibits the ODH turnover frequency (TOF, ODH formation rate normalized by the number of ketonic carbonyl groups from XPS in Table 2), namely the intrinsic ODH activity, as a function of the binding energy of ketonic carbonyl groups. It is interesting to observe that the binding energy of ketonic carbonyl groups can serve as an effective descriptor for the intrinsic ODH activity of nitrogen-doped nanocarbon materials. The intrinsic ODH activity of nanocarbon increases with the introduction of nitrogen species (from TOF of OCNT at 3.1 × 10−5 s−1 to NCNT700 at 22.5 × 10−5 s−1, around 7 times). This phenomenon should be related to the regulation of the redox property via nitrogen doping. Nitrogen species could donate electrons to nanocarbon and thus increase the nucleophilicity of ketonic carbonyl groups and enhance their intrinsic ODH activity.22,31 Similarly, the Brønsted acidity of carboxylic acid groups on nanocarbon decreases with the increasing content of nitrogen species since the ability of carboxylic acid sites for donating protons would be declined due to the introduction of extra electrons from nitrogen species. TOF for nB dehydration on –COOH on undoped OCNT is around 7 to 23 times that on nitrogen-doped NCNT catalysts (TOF = 34.8 × 10−6 s−1 for OCNT vs. 1.5–5.1 × 10−6 s−1 for NCNTs), as shown in Fig. 5c. However, the relationship between dehydration TOF and the degree of electron transfer (shift of BE) for NCNT samples deviates slightly from this regularity. For example, the sample of NCNT700 with a higher degree of electron transfer exhibits higher intrinsic dehydration activity than NCNT900 (TOF = 4.9 × 10−6 s−1vs. 1.4 × 10−6 s−1). This phenomenon should be related to their different content of nitro oxide species (N4), which also has acidity and may contribute to dehydration reactions.35 In this case, the sample of NCNT700, which has shown the highest content of nitro oxide species, exhibits the best dehydration activity among NCNT samples as shown in Fig. 5d.
Fig. 5 Binding energy (BE) shift of different oxygen-containing functional groups on the NCNT surface related to OCNT as a function of the content of pyridine (N1) and pyrrole (N2) species on nanocarbon surface (a), the intrinsic ODH catalytic activity of carbonyl groups as a function of BE (b), the intrinsic catalytic activity of carboxyl groups as a function of BE (c), normalized dehydration reaction rate as a function of the content of acidic groups on the surface of the nanocarbon (d).
Fig. 6 summarizes the basic kinetic response for NCNT samples in nB conversion reactions. As shown in Fig. 6a, the apparent activation energy (Ea) for nB ODH reactions decreases with the nitrogen content increasing (from 63.6 to 57.9 kJ mol−1 for NCNT900 and NCNT700, respectively), which is slightly lower than that for undoped OCNT catalysts (64.8 kJ mol−1). This result indicates that the introduction of nitrogen species would lower the apparent activation energy of carbon materials for butanol ODH reactions, which is an important structure–function relationship for constructing highly efficient carbon-based ODH catalysts. However, the apparent activation energy of NCNTs for nB dehydration reaction (located in the wide range of 92.2 to 121.9 kJ mol−1) does not show an obvious trend with the nitrogen content or thermal treatment temperature. The very different activation energy for NCNT samples also indicates the existence of multiple active sites (carboxylic acid and nitro oxide species) that may follow different reaction mechanisms.
Fig. 6 nB ODH and dehydration reaction rates as a function of reaction temperature (a and b Arrhenius plot) and nB (c and d) partial pressure.
The reaction order of nB for ODH and dehydration reactions on NCNT are 0.57–0.67 and 0.41–0.46, respectively. The positive value means that we can increase the ODH and dehydration reaction rates by increasing the partial pressure of nB, and the activation of nB may be the rate-determining step during this process. These values are similar to that observed on OCNT catalysts (0.64 for ODH and 0.58 for dehydration reactions),1,36,37 suggesting that nB conversion reactions on these samples may follow the same reaction mechanism, except that the introduction of nitrogen species would influence both the intrinsic ODH and dehydration activity of nanocarbon materials.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we present here an efficient nB conversion route for synthesizing high-value-added products via nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes as catalysts. This reaction route exhibits its unique advantages, considering that the reactant and catalyst can be all obtained from sustainable resources (biomass, etc.) and the whole reaction system does not need any metal or fossil resources. The apparent and intrinsic ODH catalytic activity of NCNTs increased by around 15 and 7 times, respectively, compared with undoped OCNT materials (ODH rate = 135.6 × 10−5 μmol s−1 m−2vs. 8.6 × 10−5 μmol s−1 m−2, TOF = 22.5 × 10−5 s−1vs. 3.1 × 10−5 s−1) with nB conversion at 22% and ODH product selectivity at 73%. The physical–chemical nature behind the activity promotion effect originates from the electron donation of nitrogen dopants, especially the pyridinic and pyrrolic nitrogen species. The binding energy of oxygen functionalities (i.e. ketonic carbonyl groups) decreases with the increasing nitrogen content, suggesting their improved nucleophilicity and activity for C–H bond dissociation. The present study exhibits the basic structure–function relations for enhancing the nB ODH catalytic activity of nanocarbon materials, shedding light on their potential applications in the biomass resources refinery industry.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
