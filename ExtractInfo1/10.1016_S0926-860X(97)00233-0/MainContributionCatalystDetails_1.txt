The given document does not contain any details about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. It discusses deactivation kinetics and modeling for a general catalytic system, but does not provide specifics about propane dehydrogenation. Therefore, I have indicated that the document is not relevant to assessing advances in propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
