New insight into the enhanced catalytic performance of ZnPt/HZSM-5 catalysts for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene†
Catalysts comprising zinc and platinum supported on high-silica HZSM-5 (HZ) were prepared for catalyzing the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH). The catalysts were characterized by a series of techniques, including XRD, N2 sorption, TEM, H2-TPR, NH3-TPD, XPS and TGA. The optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst (consisting of 1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn) shows a high propylene yield (about 46%) and extraordinary dehydrogenation stability over 65 h at 525 °C without any regeneration procedure or H2 as auxiliary gas. It is revealed that this catalyst has two kinds of active centers which work corporately: (i) Lewis acidic sites created by framework Zn species and (ii) small-sized PtZn particles. In addition, the stable state of the active species and strong carbon resistance of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ related to the interaction effect between Pt and Zn are confirmed, accounting for the admirable reaction stability of PDH. This catalyst contains much more Zn and less Pt than previously reported PtZn-based dehydrogenation catalysts, breaking the traditional understanding about Pt–Zn catalysts and opening a wide avenue for the design of stable dehydrogenation catalysts.
1. Introduction
Propylene is an essential raw material for a number of chemical products, such as acrolein, acrylic acid and polypropylene. Due to a shifted focus towards higher ethylene selectivity in steam crackers and the increasing demand for propylene, the gap between conventional propylene supply and market demand is expected to grow.1,2 Thus, the expansion of propylene production has obtained intensive attention, and a method of direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) is believed to have great potential for boosting propylene production.3,4 The primary industrial catalysts for PDH are CrOx and Pt based catalysts, but the former is noxious and the latter is expensive. Moreover, both of them are easily deactivated, requiring frequent regeneration.5–7 Hence, the exploration of effective and stable PDH catalysts without regeneration equipment is very much needed.
In recent years, some transition metals such as Zr, Co, V and Zn have been used as independent PDH catalysts rather than promoters of Pt catalysts, having drawn tremendous attention.8–12 Among them, Zn species with Lewis acidic character, of great promise for catalyzing alkane dehydrogenation reactions, have been widely reported.13–16 For instance, Schweitzer et al. reported that isolated Zn2+ on silica had the ability to activate the C–H bond and showed a certain catalytic activity in PDH.17 Gong et al. found that the framework Zn species in HZSM-5 zeolite were of Lewis acidic character,18 which could promote the cleavage of the C–H bond as a promising PDH catalyst. Recently, our group found that ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated Beta zeolite exhibited high catalytic activity and selectivity in PDH,19 demonstrating that the Zn species bonded to the zeolite framework can create Lewis acidic sites which are responsible for catalyzing the dehydrogenation reaction. Nevertheless, the unsatisfactory catalytic performance and fast deactivation of Zn catalyst hamper its further development in the PDH reaction.13
It has been demonstrated that Pt-based catalysts with small particle size are more active than the bulk ones in PDH,20,21 and the preparation of bimetallic Pt-based catalysts by using various promoters (e.g., Sn, Zr, In, Zn, etc.) is an efficient strategy to disperse and prevent the sintering of small-sized Pt species.7,13,14,22–24 Thus, as for the bimetallic Pt–Zn catalyst, most reports just put attention on the catalytic ability of Pt and think of Zn only as serving as a promoter.6,13,25,26 For instance, Zhang et al. reported that Pt supported on Zn modified ZSM-5 exhibited better catalytic performance than that on Zn-free ZSM-5,27 wherein the Zn exclusively functioned as a promoter of Pt in terms of geometric and electronic effects. Considering the catalytic capacity of Lewis acidic Zn species, Gong's group employed ZnO supported on Al2O3 upon the addition of a trace amount of Pt as the catalyst in the PDH reaction.28 It was verified that ZnO species were the active sites, and Pt served as a promoter which was able to strengthen the Lewis acidity of the ZnO species. This report broke the traditional notion that metallic Pt was the active site and Zn was just a promoting element in Pt–Zn dehydrogenation catalysts. Usually, a bifunctional catalytic center configuration is added to a new metal site whose main role is to speed up desorption of the olefinic species from the acidic sites.29,30 Given the above, we further obtain that the catalytic activity of both Pt and Lewis acidic Zn species in the Zn–Pt combination system should be taken into consideration in the PDH reaction.
In this work, we prepared ZnPt catalysts with different Zn/Pt ratios supported on high-silica HZSM-5 zeolite (HZ) via a co-impregnation method and tested their catalytic activity for the PDH reaction under different conditions. Sole Pt and Zn catalysts supported on HZ were also prepared for comparison purposes. The activity test results showed that the propylene yield over the optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ (1000 ppm Pt and 10 wt% Zn) catalyst maintained a value of around 41% after 65 h time on stream without any regeneration procedure and H2 co-feeding. It is noteworthy that the high catalytic activity was reached at a low reaction temperature of 525 °C. A series of techniques were employed to investigate the structural and surface properties of the prepared catalysts, unveiling that both the framework Zn species and small-sized PtZn particles contribute to the excellent catalytic performance. Meanwhile, the interaction between Pt and Zn brought about the high thermal stability and strong carbon deposition resistance, thus causing commendable reaction stability in the PDH reaction. The catalyst system is of great potential to be applied in propylene production, which can reduce cost due to the elimination of regeneration apparatus and reduced Pt usage. Additionally, it provides vital guidance for the design of stable catalysts in other heterogeneous reactions.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Catalyst preparation
ZnPt/HZ catalysts with different Zn/Pt ratios were prepared by a traditional co-impregnation method. The required amounts of Zn(NO3)2·5H2O and H2PtCl6 were dissolved in 20 ml of distilled water, followed by adding 1 g of HZSM-5 zeolite (SiO2/Al2O3 = 260) powder. The above solutions were stirred at room temperature overnight. After that, the impregnated solutions were dried at 80 °C for 12 h and then calcined at 600 °C for 6 h under air atmosphere. The obtained samples were denoted as xZnyPt/HZ, where x and y represent the weight percent (wt%) of Zn and Pt, respectively. 10Zn/HZ and 0.5Pt/HZ catalysts were prepared by using the same method without the addition of H2PtCl6 and Zn(NO3)2·5H2O, respectively.
2.2 Catalyst characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a Rigaku D/MAX-2500 (Mini FlexII) with Cu-Kα radiation. N2 sorption analysis was performed on a Quantachrome NOVA 2000e sorption analyzer at 77 K, and all the samples were degassed at 200 °C overnight before the measurement. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEOL JSM-2800 microscope at 200 kV. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analysis was conducted on a Quantachrome ChemBET 3000 analyzer, which contains a U-shaped tubular micro-reactor placed inside an electrical furnace. The samples were pretreated in a He flow (120 ml min−1) at 600 °C for 30 min before the test. After that, the samples were reduced by a 10% H2/Ar flow (110 ml min−1). Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) profiles were similarly obtained with a Quantachrome CHEMBET-3000 analyzer. The samples were pretreated with He at 600 °C for 1 h. NH3 adsorption was performed with NH3 and then the temperature was kept at 80 °C for 30 min. Afterward, the reactor with the loaded sample was purged with He to remove adsorbed NH3 from 80 to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were recorded on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a TA SDT Q600 instrument, and the heating rate was 10 °C min−1 from ambient temperature to 800 °C in air atmosphere.
2.3 Activity test
Propane dehydrogenation was tested in a fixed-bed quartz reactor (6 mm in diameter) under atmospheric pressure. The reaction temperature was measured by a thermocouple which was inserted into the catalyst bed and fixed at the target reaction temperature. Pre-weighed catalysts were held in between two quartz wool plugs in the isothermal zone of the reactor. The reactant was introduced into the reactor at a flow rate of 20 mL min−1, consisting of 5 vol% propane and balance nitrogen. The space velocity (WHSV) was controlled by changing the weight of catalysts between 0.05 and 0.5 g. The products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (SP-6800A6) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The propane conversion (Cpropane), propylene selectivity (Spropylene) and yield (Ypropylene) were defined as follows:
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Catalytic activity and stability of ZnPt/HZ catalysts
3.1.1. Effect of Zn and Pt addition The catalytic activities of 0.5Pt/HZ, 10Zn/HZ and 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ were tested in PDH at 525 °C, and the propylene yields are displayed in Fig. 1. The initial propylene yield over the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst (above 40%) is high and stays almost unchanged during 10 h on stream. In contrast, the 0.5Pt/HZ and 10Zn/HZ catalysts show much lower initial propylene yield, about 10% and 20%, respectively. Moreover, the 0.5Pt/HZ catalyst undergoes fast deactivation over a 3 h period, and the 10Zn/HZ catalyst shows around 10% loss of the propylene yield after 10 h time on stream. Therefore, the coexistence of Zn–Pt on the HZ support leads to a much better catalytic performance than the corresponding monometallic catalysts. Table 1 summarizes some important information about the prepared catalysts. As exhibited in Table 1, the catalytic performance comparison of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ under different WHSVs, of 0.24 and 0.4 h−1, shows slight differences possibly because the propane dehydrogenation equilibrium has almost been reached. Comparison of the catalytic performance of ZnPt/HZ to each of the sole 10Zn/HZ and 0.5Pt/HZ catalysts, tested at the lower WHSVs with propane conversions below equilibrium, shows a dramatic improvement of the catalytic activity for the bimetallic system.

3.1.2. Effect of Pt loading A series of activity tests of PDH were performed over the 10ZnPt/HZ catalysts with different Pt loadings at 525 °C in order to investigate the influence of Pt content. The propane conversion and propylene selectivity over the 10ZnPt/HZ catalysts are presented in Fig. 2. With the increase of the Pt loading from 0.1 to 0.5 wt%, the initial propane conversion increases from 52.7% to 56.3%. Then, the initial propane conversion decreases to 46.6% when the Pt content is up to 1 wt%. Thus, rationally elevating the Pt loading brings about a promotion of propane conversion, whereas excessive Pt leads to the reduction of catalytic activity. From the standpoint of stability, the propane conversion of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ keeps at a value of about 47.0% after 6 h on stream and shows a loss of 8.7% during a 10 h period. By contrast, the 10Zn0.5Pt/HZ and 10Zn1Pt/HZ catalysts exhibit evident activity loss during 10 h time on stream of about 19.5% and 18.3%, respectively. Compared to propane conversion, the propylene selectivity over these catalysts exhibited in Fig. 2b shows a similar growth trend. After 4 h on stream, all the catalysts show outstanding propylene selectivity of over 90%. Overall, the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst is considered as the optimal catalyst for PDH, which shows a commendable propylene yield maintained at around 41% (Fig. 1) and the least activity loss after 10 h time on stream.

3.1.3. Effect of reaction temperature PDH tests were carried out over the optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst at different reaction temperatures of 525, 550 and 600 °C, in view of thermodynamic constraints. It is observed that the reaction temperature has a significant influence on the propane conversion and propylene selectivity. As shown in Fig. 3a, the initial propane conversion of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst increases as the temperature goes up, while the stability becomes worse. The propane conversion of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ decreases from about 80% to 50% at 600 °C after 20 h time on stream; in contrast, it only decreases from 56.2% to 48.2% below 525 °C. In addition, the propylene selectivity obtained at 600 °C is obviously low, because that high temperature favors the occurrence of side reactions.31 The overall catalytic performance of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ can be determined from the propylene yield as a function of reaction time, as displayed in Fig. S1.† Therefore, in spite of the lower initial propane conversion, 525 °C is the most suitable reaction temperature from the point of view of long-term stability and energy saving effects.
Fig. 3 Propane conversion (a) and propylene selectivity (b) of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ vs. reaction time at different reaction temperatures (reaction conditions: WHSV: 0.24 h−1).
A long-term dehydrogenation stability experiment, consisting of 65 hours of uninterrupted operation, was performed on the optimal 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst. The catalytic performance of the catalyst during the PDH test is exhibited in Fig. 4. It needs to be stressed that no air and hydrogen were introduced during the whole activity test. The calculated carbon balance values of the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst during the reaction remain at around 99%. A propane conversion of about 60% is reached at the first hour with a propylene selectivity higher than 80%. After 65 h on stream, it still shows a high propane conversion of around 43% and selectivity toward propylene of about 93%. The propylene yield stabilizes at about 41% with a slight loss of about 5% after 65 h on stream, clearly demonstrating the superior stability of the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst. Thus, the co-impregnation of Zn and a trace amount of Pt greatly prolongs the lifetime of the PDH reaction with high catalytic performance. We also performed the PDH experiment under different WHSVs by varying the amount of the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst (WHSV values = 0.24, 0.4, 2 and 4 h−1, respectively) and listed the results in Table S1.† According to the results in Table S1,† there is an acceptable reduction of propane conversion with the increase of WHSVs from 0.24 to 4 h−1. Meanwhile, much improved propylene selectivity can be obtained with the WHSV value of 4.0 h−1. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reported Pt-based catalysts so far that could realize such an ideal catalytic performance under comparable conditions, in which the test result of the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst was obtained with the WHSV value of 2.0 h−1 (Table S2†) for reducing the influence of mass transfer resistances. In summary, the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst shows a marked improvement in catalytic activity and stability at 525 °C, suggesting a synergistic effect and/or a highly superior combination that potentially take the most positive attributes of Pt and Zn.

3.2 Characterization of the metallic phase
3.2.1. Textural properties and XRD results The textural properties of the samples, including the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and total pore volume, were measured by applying the N2 sorption technique. The results are listed in Table 1. The 10Zn/HZ and 0.5Pt/HZ catalysts possess specific surface areas of 333 and 326 m2 g−1, respectively. However, the 10ZnPt/HZ catalysts exhibit relatively lower specific surface areas, probably due to a partial blockage of the HZ channel pores by platinum and/or zinc. For the 10ZnPt/HZ catalysts, the increased Pt loading leads to a further decrement of the specific surface area. The total pore volume increases from 0.213 cm3 g−1 for 10Zn1Pt/HZ to 0.229 cm3 g−1 for 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ, indicating that the metal catalysts have better dispersion in 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples are displayed in Fig. 5. The diffraction peaks of all samples agree with the typical MFI structure of HZSM-5 zeolite,32,33 confirming that the impregnation of Zn and/or Pt has a slight effect on the lattice structure of the HZ support. Inevitably, the intensity of the diffraction peak is reduced upon the addition of Zn and/or Pt. Two peaks at 2θ = 34.44° and 36.25° corresponding to hexagonal phase ZnO (JCPDS No. 36-1451) are clearly observed in the 10Zn/HZ catalyst and become weak upon Pt addition,18 which may be attributable to the redistribution or amorphous form of Zn species. What is more, no typical diffraction peaks of metallic Pt or PtZn alloy can be seen in all samples, possibly ascribed to the high dispersion of particles and low metal loadings.

3.2.2. TEM results The micromorphology and microstructure of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ (Fig. 6a and b) and 10Zn1Pt/HZ (Fig. 6d and e) catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Much smaller sizes and better dispersion of particles are seen in 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ than in the 10Zn1Pt/HZ catalyst. The EDX elemental mappings of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ and 10Zn1Pt/HZ (Fig. S2†) show that Pt and Zn are well dispersed with a similar distribution trend. The particle size distributions of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ and 10Zn1Pt/HZ, as shown in Fig. 6c and f, mainly distributed in 3.30 ± 2.4 and 9.2 ± 4.2 nm, respectively. These particles are evidently larger than the pore size of the HZ support, suggesting that most Pt species may form a mixture structure with partial Zn on the support surface.34,35

3.2.3. NH3-TPD results The amounts and strengths of acid sites on the selected samples were measured by NH3-TPD. The NH3-TPD curves of HZ, Zn/HZ and 10ZnPt/HZ catalysts are depicted in Fig. 7a–e, and the quantified titration results are listed in Table S3† and displayed in Fig. 7f. Generally, the NH3 desorption peaks at <300 °C, 300–400 °C and 400–550 °C can be classified as weak, medium, and strong acid sites, respectively.36 The TPD profile of 10Zn/HZ shows that the medium acid sites at 315 °C appear at the expense of strong acid sites, in comparison to the HZ support which contains exclusively weak and strong acid sites. Thus, the Zn species incorporation leads to the generation of medium acid sites and the decrement of strong acid sites by interacting with the strong acid sites (Si–OH–Al) in the HZ framework.16,37,38 This phenomenon is strengthened on the sole Zn/HZ catalyst in comparison to the Zn–Pt/HZ catalyst. As shown in Fig. 7f, the total acidity of 10ZnPt/HZ catalysts decreases upon Pt addition and further decreases with rationally decreasing Pt loading, because a small amount of Pt tends to promote dispersion and thus leads to a reduced effect on acidity; a similar result was reported by Jarvis et al.39 The reduction of strong acidity will minimize undesirable side reactions and promote the selectivity to propylene.6 In contrast to the strong and weak acid sites, the medium acid sites suffer a slight influence with the addition of a small amount of Pt, and the amount of medium acid sites decreases from 0.19 to 0.15 mmolNH3 g−1 with the increase of Pt loading from 0.1 to 1 wt%. For the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst, the low total acidity (0.33 mmolNH3 g−1) and number of medium acid sites (0.19 mmolNH3 g−1) indicate that Zn species disperse well and a large proportion of them are bonded to the zeolite framework.19,40 It is reported that the bonded Zn species with medium acidity behave as Lewis acidic sites which are active for PDH.18,27,41 The increasing Zn/Pt ratio can reduce the total acidity but not medium acidity, suggesting that extremely low Pt addition can well preserve the Lewis acidic Zn species.39

3.2.4. H2-TPR results The reducibility of Pt and Zn in the 10ZnPt/HZ catalyst and the Zn–Pt interaction were characterized by H2-TPR measurement. As exhibited in Fig. 8, two reduction temperatures are observed over the 10Zn/HZ catalyst. The reduction peak at about 473 °C is ascribed to surface Zn oxides which weakly interact with the HZ support.13 The higher reduction peak, which occurs at around 654 °C, corresponds to the reduction of framework Zn species attributable to the strong interaction with the zeolite framework.13,42 For the 0.5Pt/HZ catalyst, no peak below 200 °C is observed, indicating a reduction of the majority of Pt species to the metallic state upon calcination.43 Also, the reduction peak at 500 °C of 0.5Pt/HZ is related to Pt oxide weakly interacting with the HZ support or Zn species.13,35,44 There are two reduction peaks for all 10ZnPt/HZ catalysts, having shifts to varying degrees. The reduction peak in the range of 459–482 °C is in between the reduction temperatures of platinum oxides and zinc oxides, demonstrating that the interaction between surface Zn and Pt on the HZ support can be expected.13,16 Also, the co-reduction peak shifts to a lower position with the increase of the Zn/Pt ratio, ascribed to the decreased loading of the interacted Pt. Upon loading different Pt loadings, the peak location at about 650 °C of the framework Zn species is slightly influenced, while its peak intensity obviously decreases with increasing Pt loading, indicating that the content of the framework Zn species reduces with a higher Pt loading.

3.2.5. XPS results XPS analysis was used to identify the element chemical states of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ and 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalysts, as exhibited in Fig. 9. The corresponding data of 0.5Pt/HZ and 10Zn/HZ were also collected for comparison. Fig. 9a shows the binding energies of Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 in 0.5Pt/HZ of 70.7 and 73.9 eV, respectively, indicating that the main Pt species in the monometallic catalyst have zero valence state, corresponding to metallic Pt.45,46 The binding energy of Pt 4f7/2 of 0.5Pt/HZ is lower than that of bulk metallic Pt (71.2 eV),47,48 ascribed to the electron transfer from the zeolite framework O atoms to Pt.49 Further, these values shift to 70.3 and 73.6 eV in both 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ and 10Zn1Pt/HZ catalysts; it can be proposed that the occurrence of electron transfer from Zn to Pt is due to the nature of the Zn–Pt interaction.34 Thus, the Pt particles in 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ and 10Zn1Pt/HZ catalysts are well dispersed and interact with surface Zn species. The binding energies of the Zn 2p XPS spectra of selected samples shown in Fig. 9b are higher than those of bulk ZnO (1021.0 and 1046.0 eV), indicating the electron transfer from Zn to the zeolite framework and/or Pt.32,39 The 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst possesses higher Zn 2p binding energies, indicating that there are more framework Zn species. Zn LMM Auger spectra are more sensitive to the differences in the Zn chemical environment than the Zn 2p spectra. The Zn LMM spectra of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ and 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ are shown in Fig. 9c, and both exhibit two kinetic energy peaks related to two kinds of Zn species. The kinetic energy for the Zn2+ species is located in a lower position (Zn1: ∼990 eV), attributable to the bonding of Zn with lattice O atoms or Pt oxide species. In addition, the LMM peak of Zn0 (Zn2: ∼993 eV) indicates the presence of metallic Zn possibly derived from PtZn alloy.50,51 It is seen that the concentration of Zn2+ species in 10Zn1Pt/HZ is lower than that in the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst, indicating that fewer Zn species incorporate into the zeolite framework with increasing Pt loading amount.

3.3 Characterization of the spent catalysts
The main focus of the catalyst deactivation is coke formation, so thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was employed to determine the coke deposition over the spent catalysts after 10 h time on stream at 525 °C. The change of weight percent per temperature interval as a function of temperature is shown in Fig. 10. There are two weight loss steps for the catalysts; the first one before 300 °C is attributed to absorbed water and the second stage in the range of 300–650 °C is associated with the decomposition of coke. The weight percentages of coke over 10Zn0.5Pt/HZ and 10Zn1Pt/HZ are 2.08% and 3.14%, respectively. The least amount of coke is obtained on 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ, only about 1.32%, so a high Zn/Pt ratio strongly resists coke formation, possibly due to the presence of small Pt particles which can promote the desorption of hydrocarbons.21,52 For the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst, the weight percent of coke is only 1.36% over the duration of the activity test lasting for 65 h (Fig. S3†), which is almost equivalent to that found after 10 h on stream. Therefore, coking mainly occurs during the initial stages of the reaction. 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ with an ultra-low mass of coke possesses great anti-coking ability which is responsible for high dehydrogenation stability. Moreover, the prominent anti-coking capability allows the ZnPt catalyst to be implemented in an industrial fixed-bed reactor, which is cheaper and more simple and reliable.
Fig. 10 TGA profiles of the spent 10ZnPt/HZ catalysts with different Pt loadings after 10 h time on stream at 525 °C.
The changes of the chemical states of Zn and Pt in 10ZnPt/HZ catalysts before and after the PDH reaction were also analyzed by the XPS method and compared in Fig. 11. The Zn 2p and Pt 4f spectra remain unchanged after the reaction, indicating the stable states of Pt and Zn in 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst. The Zn LMM spectra of the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst before and after the reaction are shown in Fig. S4,† with no obvious change, further validating the stability of Zn species in 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ. However, the binding energies of Zn 2p and Pt 4f in 10Zn1Pt/HZ shift to a higher position (Fig. 11b), with a positive shift of 0.8 eV for Zn and 0.3 eV for Pt. As described above, the two binding energies of 70.2 and 73.6 eV of Pt are assigned to Pt (4f7/2) and Pt (4f5/2), respectively, fitting well with that of small Pt particles. Thus, the binding energies of Pt in 10Zn1Pt/HZ moving to a higher position may be due to the aggregation of PtZn particles.7 Consequently, a high Pt loading results in the aggregation of particles during the PDH reaction, consistent with a report by Camacho-Bunquin et al.,34 and the highly stable state of metal phases in the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst is also responsible for the excellent stability.
Fig. 11 XPS spectra of Pt 4f and Zn 2p of the fresh and spent catalysts after 10 h on stream: 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ (a) and 10Zn1Pt/HZ (b).
The TEM images and the corresponding particle size distributions of the used 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ and 10Zn1Pt/HZ catalysts are displayed in Fig. 12. The particle sizes of the spent 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst are distributed in 3.48 ± 2 nm and have no obvious changes with respect to the fresh material (3.30 ± 2.4 nm). However, the particle sizes distribute in 21.42 ± 15 nm for the spent 10Zn1Pt/HZ catalyst, much larger than that of the fresh counterpart (9.2 ± 4.2 nm), indicating the occurrence of particle aggregation of this catalyst during the operation process. Therefore, a high Zn/Pt ratio can lead to high dispersion and great thermal stability of metal phases,34 in line with the above XPS results.
Fig. 12 TEM images of the spent 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ (a and b) and 10Zn1Pt/HZ (d and e); (c) and (f) show the particle size distributions of the spent 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ and 10Zn1Pt/HZ catalysts, respectively.
3.4 Discussion
The sole 10Zn/HZ and 0.5Pt/HZ catalysts show weak catalytic activity and dehydrogenation stability at 525 °C. However, the combination of Zn–Pt on the HZ support greatly improves the catalytic activity and stability. The activity test results reveal that both high temperature and high Pt loading are detrimental for long-term stability, and the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst shows remarkable catalytic activity (around 46% propylene yield) and long-term stability over 65 h at 525 °C with a WHSV of 0.24 h−1. In Fig. S5,† it is obvious that the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst exhibits a catalytic performance that far surpasses that of the 10Zn0.05Pt/HZ and 5Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalysts. Thus, the reduction of Pt or Zn leads to an evident decrease of the catalytic activity, which indicates the common contribution of Pt and Zn in this catalyst system. Specifically, the activity comparison of ZnPt/HZ catalysts with different Zn/Pt ratios after 10 h on stream is displayed in Fig. 13. The propane conversion (about 43%) of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ is still higher than that of the other catalysts, regardless of the similar selectivity of around 94%, proving that there is a balance between the metal Pt and Lewis acidic Zn species which leads to the high catalytic activity and long-term stability at low reaction temperature.

Referring to previous reports, the small-sized and highly dispersed Pt-containing particles can effectively catalyze PDH and restrain the generation of by-products via the C–C bond cleavage.53,54 The particle size distributions show that small-sized PtZn particles are obtained with a high Zn/Pt ratio, as seen in Fig. 6, because an increase of Pt loading leads to a decrease of Pt dispersion.55 Also, the XPS results of Pt 4f show the low binding energies of metallic Pt of 10ZnPt/HZ catalysts derived from the well-dispersed and small-sized PtZn particles. The highly dispersed PtZn species result in the low total acidity of the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst, which is reflected from the NH3-TPD results in Fig. 7. The content of Lewis acidic Zn species also plays an important role in PDH.18,28 With the decrease of the Zn/Pt ratio, the H2 reduction peak at ca. 650 °C becomes weaker, ascribed to the lower content of framework Zn species, as shown in Fig. 8, suggesting that high Pt loading can inhibit the formation of framework Zn species. The NH3-TPD results demonstrate that the medium acid sites of 10ZnPt/HZ are created by the framework Zn species, the content of which decreases with the increase of Pt loading of 10ZnPt/HZ, in line with the H2-TPR results. Further, the Zn LMM spectra indicate that the Zn states in 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ and 10Zn1Pt/HZ are different because the introduction of Pt promotes the reduction of partial Zn species, and low Pt loading leads to a high content of framework Zn species. The synergistic effect between Pt and Zn is proved by the H2-TPR results, in which the co-reduction peak of partial Pt and Zn is in between the reduction temperatures of platinum oxides and zinc oxides. In addition, the XPS results recognize the existence of a partial PtZn alloy and the interaction between Zn and Pt in the bimetallic catalyst. Therefore, the small-sized PtZn particles (alloy or mixed oxides) and high level of framework Zn species are obtained on the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst, and the interaction effect between them makes contributions to the high catalytic activity of the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst at 525 °C.56
The stability of the catalysts is proved by the characterization of the used counterparts. TGA results show that the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst possesses strong coke resistance which is essential for dehydrogenation stability. The XPS results of the spent catalysts indicate the evident state change of Pt and Zn in the 10Zn1Pt/HZ catalyst. However, the binding energies of Pt 4f and Zn 2p of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ keep unchanged after a long-term reaction period. The TEM image of the used 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ (Fig. 12) shows almost no particle agglomeration compared with its fresh counterpart, demonstrating its highly stable state. Thus, the high coke resistance and the stable state of Pt and Zn of the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst cooperatively lead to such a superior stability. Accordingly, we assume that the adsorption and dissociation of propane occurred on the framework Zn2+ species, and then the surface dispersed Pt particles can transfer the intermediates and promote them to desorb.16,17 Based on all the above, the combination of Zn and extremely low Pt can result in a high catalytic activity and extraordinary stability in the PDH reaction at 525 °C. Still, the synergistic catalysis between metal species and acid sites and the reason for the high catalytic performance at 525 °C and unsatisfactory propylene selectivity need in-depth investigation.
4. Conclusions
A series of ZnPt/HZ catalysts supported on HZSM-5 zeolite were tested in PDH. The activity results exhibited that the catalytic activity and reaction stability were varied within the ZnPt/HZ catalysts with different Zn/Pt ratios. The catalyst consisting of 1000 ppm platinum, 10 wt% zinc and a high-silica HZSM-5 support showed much better catalytic performance at 525 °C than the sole Zn/HZ and Pt/HZ as well as 10ZnyPt/HZ catalysts with other Zn/Pt ratios.
Both the small-sized PtZn particles and Lewis acidic framework Zn species make contributions to the high catalytic activity of PDH, following a metal–acid bifunctional mechanism, and a balance between the metal and acid functions can be realized on the 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ catalyst. It is confirmed that a high Pt loading has side effects on the catalytic performance of the ZnPt/HZ catalyst due to the formation of bulk PtZn particles and the reduction of framework Zn species. The surface interactions between Pt and Zn are revealed by the H2-TPR and XPS measurements, leading to the strong coke resistance and the stable state of Pt and Zn of 10Zn0.1Pt/HZ which are responsible for the ultra-stable activity for PDH over 65 h at 525 °C. As a result, the supported Zn and a trace amount of Pt work corporately and result in high catalytic activity and great stability at 525 °C, and this sheds a bright light on the design of other hyperstable dehydrogenation catalysts.
