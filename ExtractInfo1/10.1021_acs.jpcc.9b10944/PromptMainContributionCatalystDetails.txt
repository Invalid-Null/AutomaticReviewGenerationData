Pt–Ga Model SCALMS on Modified HOPG: Thermal Behavior and Stability in UHV and under Near-Ambient Conditions
Abstract
We have prepared model systems for Pt–Ga supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS) by physical vapor deposition of Pt and Ga onto highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Prior to metal deposition, the HOPG support was modified by Ar+ bombardment. In this work, we focus on the stability of the Pt–Ga deposits toward agglomeration, which is a critical challenge in application. Specifically, we study the behavior of the model catalysts in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and under near ambient pressure (NAP) conditions at different temperatures. We use CO as a probe molecule to examine changes in the surface composition of the Pt–Ga deposits by in situ infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS). In specific, we combine IRAS and ex situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) to study changes induced by annealing. We find that sintering effects are strongly dependent on the thickness of the deposited Pt–Ga layers. Our data suggest that particle ripening leads to a separation of the system into disperse Pt-rich and large Ga-rich particles. In the NAP regime, we performed simultaneous measurements with polarization modulation IRAS (PM-IRAS) and near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS). The alloying of Pt and Ga is accompanied by a shift of Pt 4f and Ga 3d photoelectron lines to higher binding energies. Although partial oxidation of Ga is observed upon CO exposure at pressures in the millibar regime, PM-IRAS shows adsorbed CO at a frequency typical for Pt ensembles in a Ga matrix.

ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Efficient use of precious metals such as Rh, Pd, or Pt is an important driving force in the development of new supported noble metal catalysts. Ultimate efficacy is achieved in single atom catalysts (SACs), where every noble metal atom can catalyze the desired reaction. (1) Ideally, SACs should also be single site catalysts, (2) which provide the highest possible control over selectivity. In most cases, however, the active sites are heterogeneous in nature because the active atoms are located in different environments on polydisperse particles on an inhomogeneous support. (3) Often, defect sites such as vacancies or impurities on the support, which are intrinsically difficult to control, provide the strongest binding to the catalyst particles or atoms.
Consequently, the biggest challenge in single site catalysis is the stabilization of a well-defined site under reaction conditions. (1) Typically, the high surface free energy of single atom centers must be compensated by strong binding to the support in order to prevent agglomeration. (4) On oxide supports, the bonding is governed by metal–support interactions, (5,6) while carbon or metallic supports typically require direct incorporation of the catalytically active atoms into the lattice by covalent bonding or alloying. (7,8) Single atom distribution is then usually achieved only at very low loading of the active metal. (8)
A novel method for preparation of SACs was recently introduced by Taccardi et al. (9) The concept of supported catalytically active liquid metal solutions (SCALMS) is based on the dilution of active species (e.g., Pd, Pt, Rh) in a low melting point metal matrix such as gallium. Pt–Ga, Pd–Ga, and Rh–Ga catalysts were already tested for application in alkane dehydrogenation. (9−11) SCALMS show high activity and selectivity, and they are normally more resistant to deactivation by coking than their pure counterparts. The high resistance to coking was associated with their liquid nature at reaction conditions, which ensures the presence of highly uniform, isolated reaction sites, which are dynamically formed during reaction. (10,11) The active atoms are preferentially located in the subsurface layer of the liquid alloy and dynamically appear at the surface in form of isolated single sites. (9−14) At the surface, the desired adsorption and reaction of molecular species is possible, while the formation of larger carbon aggregates is suppressed. (9−11)
Only a few SCALMS systems have been examined so far, (9,11,13−15) and deeper understanding of the working principles is lacking. In our recent work, we have studied SCALMS-like Pd–Ga and Pt–Ga model catalysts prepared by surface science methods. (13,14) For the Pt–Ga system, we showed that alloying of Pt with Ga leads to formation of isolated Pt atoms in a Ga matrix. We also showed that the alloy nanoparticles are dynamic already at 300 K, leading to changes in the Pt surface concentration upon exposure to strongly interacting reactants such as CO. (14)
In this work, we address an aspect which is of highest relevance for the practical application of SCALMS, i.e., their thermal stability. To this aim, we explore the morphology and thermal stability of Pt–Ga model SCALMS prepared under ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) conditions. As a substrate, we use carbon in the form of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG). Carbon is a versatile support material which comes with several benefits. It is lightweight, shows high thermal stability, can be modified in many ways, and is chemically inert (i.e., it does not alloy with Ga and it does not corrode under the reducing conditions of dehydrogenation). (16−18) HOPG, a well-defined form of carbon, is frequently used as a substrate for surface science studies. (19,20) Yet, it is rarely employed in combination with infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS). Notably, HOPG fulfills the metal surface selection rule nearly perfectly, and the surface intensity function is only moderately lower in comparison to metal single crystals. (21) Thus, high quality surface IR spectra can be obtained in reflection geometry. (13,14,22−24) However, the interaction of HOPG with most metals is very weak. To obtain small particles, the surface must be modified prior to metal deposition, for instance by ion bombardment. (19,25,26) The consequences of such modification by Ar+ or O+ bombardment were described in our previous publication. (22)
Here, we prepared Pt–Ga SCALMS-like model systems by physical vapor deposition (PVD) of Ga and Pt onto HOPG modified by Ar+ bombardment. The Pt–Ga system has been studied in the past with respect to formation of various intermetallic compounds (IMCs). (27−29) Regarding the atomic composition, we can expect the formation of various intermetallic phases such as Ga6Pt, Ga7Pt3, or Ga2Pt, in the systems studied in this work. We note that SCALMS differ greatly from ordered IMCs, for example regarding the concentration of Pt (for SCALMS ideally 1–3%) in the material and regarding their principle of operation, which relies on the dynamic self-assembly of the active site. (9−11)
As shown in previous work, (14) it is not possible to reach the liquidus temperature for Pt–Ga systems and simultaneously observe CO adsorption under high vacuum conditions (1 × 10–6 mbar of CO or below). This is due to the relatively high melting temperature of Pt–Ga SCALMS (300 °C and above) and the fact that the CO adsorption energy is reduced in Pt–Ga and Pd–Ga alloys in comparison to the pure noble metal. (13,14) Disregarding nanoscale and particle-size effects, the Pt–Ga nanoparticles (NPs) are, therefore, expected to consist of coexisting phases of pure Ga and/or various IMCs. (28) Despite the fact that all these phases may be in the solid state at room temperature, our observations suggest that isolated Pt atoms are present at the surface of the NPs which are similar to those in SCALMS. Therefore, we denote the model catalysts in the present study as SCALMS-like model systems.
We used CO as a probe molecule in IRAS to obtain information on the surface structure, composition, and morphology of the active particles during sample treatments. The data are complemented by ex situ atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. Additionally, we aim to connect our studies in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) to catalytic studies at higher pressures. To this end, we investigated the Pt–Ga system under near-ambient conditions by near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) and polarization modulation IRAS (PM-IRAS).
This work is separated into three parts. In the first part, we study Ga/Pt/HOPG samples sequentially prepared at 110 K and focus on the changes in the surface composition upon CO exposure and annealing. We show that alloy dynamics observed previously in Pt–Ga systems at 300 K is suppressed at 110 K. (14) In the second part, we investigate the stability of Ga/HOPG and Pt/Ga/HOPG samples during thermal treatment. We observe that the morphological stability of the deposits is strongly dependent on the nominal layer thickness. Thermal treatment and ripening can lead to separation into disperse Pt-rich and large Ga-rich particles. In the last part, we scrutinize the behavior of the Pt–Ga system under near-ambient conditions.

The IRAS measurements were carried out in an UHV system with a base pressure of 1 × 10–10 mbar. The system is equipped with a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer Bruker Vertex 80v along with other sample preparation and characterization tools (electron beam evaporators, quadrupole mass spectrometer, low energy electron diffraction (LEED), ion gun, load lock chamber, gas inlet system). The sample holder allows for heating/cooling of the sample in the temperature range from 100 to 1300 K. The HOPG samples were mounted on sample holders with a hole of approximately 8 mm which allows for direct heating of the sample via electron bombardment from the backside. The temperature was measured on the sample holder plate with an estimated precision of ±5 K. The spectrometer is connected to the UHV system via differentially pumped KBr windows. The evaporators for Pt and Ga were installed in a geometry that allowed metal deposition while performing IR spectroscopy.
The HOPG samples (MikroMasch, ZYA, 0.4° mosaic spread) were cleaned by using the “Scotch tape” method prior to insertion into the UHV chamber. In the UHV chamber, HOPG was briefly heated to 800 K and, subsequently, bombarded with Ar+ ions (Linde, purity 5.0, 500 eV, ∼0.5 μA/cm2) for 1 h at an angle of incidence of approximately 45°. All samples were prepared on HOPG substrates pretreated by Ar+ bombardment in order to roughen the surface and create anchoring sites. The chemical and structural changes of HOPG surfaces upon bombardment were investigated in our previous publication. (22)
Pt was deposited using a commercial electron beam evaporator (Focus EFM 3) from a Pt wire (Alfa Aesar, 99.95% purity, 1 mm in diameter), while the HOPG substrate was kept at room temperature. Gallium (Alfa Aesar, 99.99999% purity) was evaporated from a pyrolytic boron nitride crucible in a second electron beam evaporator (Focus EFM3) at an angle of approximately 45° with respect to the sample normal. The deposition rates, as determined by a quartz crystal microbalance, were 0.15–0.3 Å/min for Pt and 0.5 Å/min for Ga. For the adsorption experiments, CO (Linde, 3.7) was purified with a combination of a home-built liquid nitrogen cold trap and a commercial filter assembly (Pall Gaskleen II) before dosing.
The AFM measurements were performed ex situ after the sample preparation and IRAS measurements. We used a combined AFM/scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) system (Keysight Technologies, Series 5500 AFM/SPM) equipped with a combination of active and passive noise damping. For AFM experiments, silicon cantilevers were used (Pointprobe-Plus Silicon SPM Sensor PPP-NCHR, nominal spring constant of 10–130 N m–1, resonance frequency of 204–497 kHz), and the experiments were performed in noncontact mode. AFM images were postprocessed (row aligning, data leveling) using Gwyddion software (version 2.49). (30)
PM-IRAS and NAP-XPS measurements were conducted at the HIPPIE undulator beamline at MAX IV synchrotron (Lund, Sweden). The beamline delivers a photon flux of >1013 photons/s up to 1000 eV, and an energy range of 109–2000 eV is available. The X-rays are focused to a 60 × 60 μm spot. (33) For the presented XPS experiments we use photon energies of 320, 530, and 780 eV. The energy resolution as determined from the Pt Fermi edge of a Pt(111) single crystal was 0.25 eV for 780 and 530 eV, and 0.2 eV for 320 eV. All binding energies are given with respect to the Fermi energy. The spectra are scaled to normalized height. Linear backgrounds were subtracted from all signals. Metallic peaks were fitted using functions with Doniach–Sunjic alike asymmetries (“LF” line shape as implemented in Casa XPS); nonmetallic peaks were fitted using symmetric Voigt product functions (“GL” line shape as implemented in Casa XPS).
During the PM-IRAS and NAP-XPS measurements, the sample was placed in an ambient pressure cell which allowed applying gases at pressures up to ∼0.5 mbar while heating the sample up to 450 °C. The base pressure in the analysis chamber was in the low 10–9 mbar range after the near ambient pressure experiments. A detailed description of the analysis chamber and ambient pressure cell can be found in ref (31). The PM-IRAS system is equipped with an FTIR spectrometer Bruker Vertex v70 coupled with a PMA 50 photoelastic modulator kit (Bruker) and an F350 polarizer. The IR light passes through two pairs of KBr windows placed on the analysis chamber as well as on the ambient pressure cell and is collected on an MCT mid-band detector.
Sample preparation was performed in a separated preparation chamber with a base pressure of 2 × 10–10 mbar equipped with a number of preparation and characterization tools (ion gun, LEED, gas inlet system, quartz crystal microbalance, metal evaporators, etc.). Pt was deposited from a wire (Alfa Aesar, 99.95% purity, 1 mm in diameter) using an electron beam evaporator (Focus EFM 3T). Ga (Alfa Aesar, 99.99999% purity) was deposited from a second electron beam evaporator (Focus EFM 3) at an angle of 45° with respect to the sample normal. The deposition rates for Pt and Ga were 0.015 and 2.5 Å/min, respectively.
For the PM-IRAS data, the Bessel function measured in UHV after the sample preparation was used for background subtraction from all spectra.
The Ga 3d XPS spectra were fitted with three components, representing chemically different Ga species. Each component consists of a doublet formed by the spin–orbit split Ga 3d5/2 and Ga 3d3/2 states. Due to the expected degeneracy, the ratio of Ga 3d3/2/Ga 3d5/2 was set to 2/3. Moreover, all three species were fitted with an identical full width at half-maximum (FWHM), and the spin–orbit splitting was constrained to 0.42 eV, which is a value obtained from the spectrum of Ga/HOPG.
3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Thermal Behavior of Pt–Ga
For the first experiment, we deposited 15 Å of Pt on HOPG at 300 K in UHV. The sample was then cooled to 110 K and exposed to 1 × 10–6 mbar of CO in several steps. The corresponding IRAS data are shown in Figure 1A. Starting from the lowest CO coverage, we observe a peak at 2060 cm–1 which shifts toward higher wavenumbers with increasing exposure. In addition, we observe another band emerging at 1877 cm–1, which gradually red shifts to 1859 cm–1 (note that, due to instabilities caused by cooling of the sample, the background for the right-hand column of Figure 1 was taken at 110 K). For the assignment of the bands, we rely on the literature on CO adsorption on Pt NPs and Pt single crystals. (32−39) Accordingly, the bands at 2060 and 1877 cm–1 correspond to CO adsorbed on on-top and bridge sites, respectively.
Figure 1
Figure 1. (A) IR spectra recorded during stepwise adsorption of CO at 110 K on Pt NPs (nominal coverage 15 Å) predeposited on HOPG (pretreated by Ar+ bombardment). (B) IR spectra recorded at 110 K in 1 × 10–6 mbar of CO during Ga deposition (final coverage 45 Å) onto the sample in (A).
The deposition of Pt on Ar+ modified HOPG at room temperature in UHV results in growth of disordered NPs smaller than 10 nm. (14) The presence of CO bands already at 0 langmuirs (L) exposure is caused by CO adsorption from the background gas during Pt deposition and sample cooling. The blue shift of the on-top band during CO exposure reflects the increase of CO coverage, giving rise to increasing dipole coupling. (32−35) The heterogeneity of Pt NPs is responsible for the observation of a single broad band, which most probably consists of several components. We suppose that the transition from the CO-edge band at low coverage to the CO-terrace band at high coverage is smooth and gives rise to the decrease of bandwidth at high coverage. (40,41) As a result of dynamic dipole coupling and intensity borrowing, only the contributions with the highest vibrational frequency are observed at high coverage. (38,42) The final wavenumber of 2088 cm–1 is slightly higher than the wavenumber of 2084 cm–1 observed on Pt NPs at room temperature. (14) This can be explained by the higher CO coverage achieved at 110 K. (32,39) The band corresponding to bridge-bonded CO appears only at higher coverage and shifts to lower wavenumbers with increasing CO exposure. (32,41)
In the next step, we deposited 45 Å of Ga on the same sample (final Pt concentration of 30.3 atom %) at 110 K in 1 × 10–6 mbar of CO and followed the changes of the IR spectra (see Figure 1B) during deposition. We observe that the on-top band gradually red-shifts while losing intensity. At a Ga thickness of 37.5 Å, the band reaches a position of 2047 cm–1 and vanishes subsequently. The band of bridge-bonded CO decreases rapidly in intensity during the initial steps of Ga deposition and disappears completely already after deposition of 7.5 Å of Ga. The upward-pointing feature appearing at 1870 cm–1 suggests that some bridge-bonded CO was present on the surface already during the collection of the background spectrum at 110 K. The disappearance of the band of bridge-bonded CO during the initial deposition steps indicates that Ga hinders CO adsorption on bridge sites on terraces. The limited mobility in the Pt–Ga system at 110 K explains that a smaller amount of Ga is required to completely block all Pt sites as compared to room temperature. In contrast, some on-top CO is still observed after deposition of 45 Å of Ga in an identical experiment performed at 300 K. (14)
In Figure 2A, we display the spectra recorded during subsequent annealing of the same sample in 1 × 10–6 mbar of CO. No CO band is observed up to 163 K, when a broad feature emerges at 2038 cm–1. The band narrows and shifts to 2046 cm–1 with increasing temperature and reaches its maximum intensity around 259 K. At higher temperatures, the intensity of the band decreases, and the band finally disappears at 371 K. Notably, after the initial blue shift, the band remains at 2046 cm–1. At 323 K an additional band appears at 1990 cm–1, which gradually grows and blue-shifts to 2007 cm–1 with increasing temperature.

The full set of data is shown in the Supporting Information. (B) Schematic representation of the Ga/Pt alloy during annealing. (C) IR spectra of CO adsorbed on the sample (A) after cooling to 300 K in UHV. The spectrum recorded immediately after cooling was used as a background.
The observed behavior can be explained by structural rearrangements in the sequentially deposited system. The sample structure proposed is schematically depicted in Figure 2B. After Ga deposition at 110 K, all Pt atoms are initially covered by Ga, as suggested by the complete disappearance of the CO bands in Figure 1B. The appearance of the broad band at 2038 cm–1 after annealing to 163 K is interpreted as the emersion of individual Pt atoms at the surface. The width of the band indicates that the local structure of the Pt sites differs, which is associated with the preparation at low temperature where diffusion processes in the bimetallic system are slowed down and Pt atoms may be trapped in different local environments. Notably, in a similar experiment performed at a constant temperature of 300 K, CO adsorption led to appearance of a stretching band at 2048 cm–1, which was assigned to isolated Pt atoms in our previous study. (14) Once the kinetic limitations are overcome, we expect the formation of solid IMCs coexisting with a Ga-rich phase (depending on the Pt concentration). (28) Note that IMCs and single Pt atoms at the surface of Ga-rich phases (in both the solid and liquid states) will expose Pt surface sites in a similar and (more or less) isolated environment. (43,44)
Theoretical calculations predict that the stretching frequency and binding energy of CO on Pd–Ga SCALMS are dependent on the number of Pd atoms in the coordination environment of the surface Pd atom that binds CO. (13) Accordingly, we ascribe the broad band at 2038 cm–1 observed at low temperatures to isolated Pt atoms. With increasing temperature more Pt atoms migrate to the surface region. This would result in an increasing number of Pt neighbors in the subsurface layer, as suggested by the blue shift of the CO on-top band. The highest intensity of CO adsorbed at surface Pt sites is observed at 259 K, where the CO wavenumber of 2046 cm–1 is in agreement with the value of 2048 cm–1 observed in the experiment at a constant temperature of 300 K. (14) At even higher temperature, we observe gradual desorption of CO.
The band appearing at 1990 cm–1 at temperatures above 320 K is attributed to H–Gaδ+ stretching on partially oxidized gallium. Collins et al. reported two bands at 1980 and 2003 cm–1 for hydrogen on partially reduced gallium oxide. (45) A single band at 2020 cm–1 was also reported for hydrogen adsorbed on Gaδ+ on reduced Pd/GaOx. (46) Note that the H–Gaδ+ bands in the reported work were observed only at temperatures above 500 K in hydrogen at atmospheric pressure. Here, the oxygen and hydrogen species may originate from adsorption and dissociation of contaminants (residual hydrogen, oxygen, water, hydrocarbons). Assignment to dissociated contaminants is supported by the observation of C–H stretching bands at ∼2900 cm–1 in the TP-IRAS (see the Supporting Information). Interestingly, the onset of the hydrogen band coincides with the disappearance of the CO band at 323 K. This temperature is considerably lower as compared to the onset of H–Gaδ+ formation reported on powder catalysts. (11) This observation may indicate that Pt atoms at the surface are required for the formation of H–Gaδ+.
In Figure 2C, we show the IR spectra for CO adsorption after cooling the sample to 300 K in UHV. Note that the band at 2007 cm–1 associated with H–Gaδ+ was still present after cooling to 300 K (the band is not seen as a new background was taken before CO exposure). We observe the reemergence of the CO stretching band at 2048 cm–1 after the exposure to 80 L of CO and more. However, the band is very weak. The low intensity can be explained by particle agglomeration, which will be discussed in section 3.2. Nonetheless, the increasing intensity between the first and second exposures to 1 × 10–6 mbar of CO shows that the structural dynamics of the alloy is preserved after annealing and Pt, again, migrates to the surface. It also demonstrates that, despite the partial oxidation of gallium, Pt surface sites become available. Also, the CO band remains at 2048 cm–1 indicating similar local environment of Pt before and after annealing.
For the next experiment, we deposited 45 Å of Ga at 300 K and, subsequently, deposited 4.5 Å of Pt at 110 K (11.5 atom % of Pt). The sample was then exposed to CO at 110 K (see Figure 3A). Initially, we observe a CO on-top band at 2052 cm–1. With increasing CO exposure, the band splits into two components: a main band blue-shifting to 2090 cm–1 and a small feature persisting at 2052 cm–1. Surprisingly, the 2052 cm–1 feature diminishes after exposure to 1 × 10–6 mbar of CO (note that a feature at 2052 cm–1 is visible prior to CO exposure due to CO adsorption from the background gas). Because the main band grows in intensity and blue-shifts with increasing CO dose, we ascribe this band to larger Pt ensembles, while we attribute the feature at 2052 cm–1 to CO at isolated Pt sites in a Ga-rich matrix. Similarly, single Pd atoms on Ga were observed on model Pd–Ga SCALMS after Pd deposition on Ga at low temperature. (13) The disappearance of the feature at 2052 cm–1 after exposure to 1 × 10–6 mbar of CO reflects the dominance of Pt ensembles after extended CO exposure at 110 K. (47)
Figure 3
Figure 3. (A) IR spectra recorded at 110 K during stepwise adsorption of CO on a Pt/Ga/HOPG (4.5 Å of Pt/45 Å of Ga) sample prepared by PVD of Ga at 300 K and Pt at 110 K in UHV. (B) Temperature-programmed IR spectra of sample (A) taken during annealing from 111 to 471 K in 1 × 10–6 mbar of CO. The full set of spectra is shown in the Supporting Information.
During the following TP-IRAS measurement (see Figure 3B), we observe only the main band without any indications of the component at 2052 cm–1. During annealing, the band gradually shifts to 2059 cm–1 and disappears at temperatures around 400 K. The H–Gaδ+ band appears at 332 K around 2002 cm–1 and blue-shifts to 2008 cm–1. The gradual red shift of the CO on-top band during the annealing is induced by progressive dilution of Pt in Ga. Notably, the CO band is observed at 2059 cm–1 before it completely disappears. This frequency is higher than that observed in the first experiment at 300 K (∼2046 cm–1). We ascribe this effect to the higher Pt concentration at the interface leading to formation of Pt ensembles. The effect can be rationalized by the different deposition order of the Pt and Ga metals. Also, CO stabilizes Pt at the surface and hinders Pt dissolution in Ga. (14) CO desorbs from Pt ensembles at 400 K, which is approximately 30 K higher in temperature than observed for isolated Pt atoms in Ga in the first experiment (Figure 2A). This suggests that higher Pt concentration at the surface (and the formation of ensembles) leads to increased binding energy of CO.
For the next experiment, we prepared two samples at 300 K with identical nominal metal thicknesses (2.25 Å of Pt on 45 Å of Ga, i.e., 6.1 atom % of Pt). Sample I was prepared by Ga and Pt deposition in UHV, while sample II was prepared by Ga deposition in UHV and Pt deposition in 1 × 10–6 mbar of CO. The corresponding spectra recorded in 1 × 10–6 mbar of CO are shown in Figure 4. For both samples we observe a band at 2056 cm–1, ascribed to CO adsorption on isolated Pt atoms and small Pt ensembles. The intensity of the band differs drastically, however, from the sample prepared in CO showing an approximately 5 times stronger CO band. (We note that the samples of identical composition prepared in identical fashion show similar CO band intensities: differences are usually lower than 40%. This is in stark contrast to the situation here with a difference of 500%.) We ascribe this effect to the influence of CO, hindering Pt dilution in the Ga matrix. We conclude that Pt deposition on Ga in 1 × 10–6 mbar of CO yields Pt enriched surface, whereas deposition in UHV results in Pt enriched subsurface and bulk.

3.2. Stability of Ga and Pt–Ga on HOPG
In order to study the stability of the model SCALMS during heating, we prepared several samples by evaporation of Ga and Pt in UHV onto pretreated HOPG at 300 K. The samples were studied by IRAS, subsequently annealed, and, eventually, characterized ex situ by AFM. The corresponding AFM images are shown in Figure 5. Because the samples are completely oxidized after the ex situ measurements, new samples were prepared in UHV for each AFM measurement. In Figure 5A,B, we show the result of moderate thermal treatment of a pure Ga sample (15 Å of Ga/HOPG). After preparation (Figure 5A), the surface of HOPG is uniformly covered with 1.5 nm high and approximately 15 nm wide Ga NPs (particle density of approximately 1.2 × 1012 cm–2). Upon annealing to 613 K (Figure 5B), the islands increase in size and the size distribution also changes. Due to coalescence, size and height distributions are broadened, with an island height of 2 nm for the smaller and 6 nm for the bigger particles. These bigger particles reach lateral sizes of up to 25 nm. The situation is completely different at larger Ga loading (75 Å of Ga) after annealing to the same temperature (613 K, see Figure 5C). Here, we observe large islands with a height ranging from 10 to 20 nm on a more uniform background consisting of small aggregates. The roughness of the small aggregates is around 0.5 nm, making it hard to differentiate them from the bare Ar+-bombarded HOPG (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). The apparent size of large islands is between 40 and 80 nm (note that their size is affected by tip effects). We conclude that annealing leads to strong sintering with the morphology heavily dependent on the initial thickness of deposited Ga.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Representative AFM images of (A, B) 15 Å of Ga on HOPG, (C) 75 Å of Ga on HOPG, and (D–F) 2.25 Å of Pt/45 Å of Ga/HOPG. Metal deposition was performed in UHV at 300 K. The samples were annealed in UHV prior to the ex situ AFM measurement.
In Figure 5D–F, we show AFM images reflecting the morphological changes on a Pt/Ga sample (2.25 Å of Pt/45 Å of Ga/HOPG, 6.1 atom % of Pt). After preparation at 300 K, the surface is densely covered with NPs (Figure 5 D, particle density 6 × 1011 cm–2). Annealing to 600 K leads to strong agglomeration and formation of particles with an average height of around 12 nm (see Figure 5E). Structures with a roughness between 0.5 and 1 nm remain in between the islands similarly as observed for the Pt-free sample (see Figure 5C). Upon annealing to 800 K (Figure 5F), the larger islands disappear and the height of the residual aggregates is between 1 and 2 nm.
We explain the disappearance of most of the deposited material by agglomeration into huge islands sparsely distributed on HOPG. Alternatively, intercalation into HOPG may be considered; however, this process is less likely in comparison to intercalation of metals on supported graphene. (48,49) The experimental findings suggest that it is mainly the total thickness of the deposit that controls the sintering process. Most probably, the surface defects on HOPG stabilize small Ga NPs with nominal thickness of <15 Å such as the ones in Figure 5B.
In addition, we investigated the morphological stability of the Pt–Ga layer using IRAS and CO as a probe molecule. We prepared three samples (1.125 Å of Pt/45 Å of Ga/HOPG, 2.25 Å of Pt/45 Å of Ga/HOPG, 0.75 Å of Pt/15 Å of Ga/HOPG) differing in thickness and Pt concentration (Pt concentrations of 3.2, 6.1, and 6.1 atom %, respectively). All samples were prepared by deposition of Ga and Pt at 300 K on modified HOPG. The samples were annealed in UHV in steps of 50 K up to 800 K. After each step, the samples were cooled to 300 K, and IR spectra were recorded in UHV and in 1 × 10–6 mbar of CO. For the measurements up to 400 K, we used the initial background acquired after sample preparation while the reference measurements in UHV were used as a background for higher temperatures.
The results are shown in Figure 6. Initially, we observe a CO band at 2056–2060 cm–1 which red-shifts during the first annealing steps to 2043–2047 cm–1 and decreases in intensity. Starting at 550 K, however, its intensity increases again and the band shifts back to 2060–2062 cm–1. Qualitatively, the behavior is similar for the three different Pt concentrations. Surprisingly, the final CO band intensity is larger than the initial band intensity for two of the samples (see Figure 6A,B).

Figure 6. IR spectra of (A) 1.125 Å of Pt/45 Å of Ga/HOPG, (B) 2.25 Å of Pt/45 Å of Ga/HOPG, and (C) 0.75 Å of Pt/15 Å of Ga/HOPG recorded at 300 K in 1 × 10–6 mbar of CO after stepwise annealing in UHV and subsequent cooling. The samples were prepared in UHV by PVD of Ga and Pt on HOPG at 300 K (HOPG pretreated by Ar+ bombardment).
The initial and final band positions of 2056–2060 cm–1 are typical for CO adsorption on small metallic Pt ensembles. At the beginning, we form a platinum-rich mixture with Pt ensembles at the surface due to sequential deposition of Ga and Pt. With increasing temperature, Pt dilutes in the Ga bulk and the surface concentration of Pt drops. As a result, the band positions red-shift into the region of single Pt atoms (around 2048 cm–1). (14) The different loss in intensity is attributed to agglomeration of the nanoparticles, being more pronounced for thicker layers.
The increase in intensity above 500 K indicates the reappearance of Pt at the surface. Apparently, the process goes hand in hand with agglomeration. We associate the reappearance of Pt with the observation of the smaller aggregates on the Ar+ modified HOPG surface. We suggest that growth of the large Ga agglomerates is caused by coalescence of particles and Ostwald ripening of mobile Ga. Pt is less mobile as it remains anchored to defects on the HOPG surface and also to partially oxidized Ga aggregates. As a result, the concentration of Pt increases in the small aggregates as the Ga droplets grow. Therefore, we attribute the CO band emerging above 500 K to small NPs which contain a larger fraction of Pt and smaller amounts of Ga which, in addition, may also be partially oxidized.
3.3. Pt–Ga Alloy in Near-Ambient Conditions
In the last step, we studied the behavior of the model Pt–Ga/HOPG system under near-ambient conditions. We prepared a Pt/Ga/HOPG sample (12.8 Å of Pt/22.6 Å of Ga, 42.4 atom % of Pt) in a separated preparation chamber in UHV and characterized each preparation step by XPS. We note that higher Pt concentration was necessary due to low CO signal intensity in PM-IRAS. This can be rationalized by the necessity to use two pairs of KBr windows in the NAP setup (see the Experimental Section) as well as by the fact that the IRAS signal from HOPG should be approximately 3 times lower when using the phase modulation setup (for more details see the Supporting Information). After preparation, the sample was investigated simultaneously by NAP-XPS and PM-IRAS in the catalysis cell. First, we followed the changes during stepwise increase of the CO pressure and afterward during annealing of the sample. The results from PM-IRAS and NAP-XPS are shown in Figure 7.

(A) PM-IR spectra and (B) C 1s, (C) Pt 4f, and (D) Ga 3d NAP-XPS data measured on a 12.8 Å of Pt/22.6 Å of Ga/HOPG sample during CO pressure steps and annealing. For the NAP-XPS data, spectra recorded in UHV at 300 K were normalized. The following spectra were then scaled with the same normalization factors to maintain the relative intensities.
In Figure 7A we show PM-IR spectra for CO adsorbed on Pt/Ga/HOPG (12.8 Å of Pt/22.6 Å of Ga). With increasing the CO pressure from 10–6 to 10–2 mbar, we observe the appearance of a CO on-top band at 2067 cm–1. The band shifts to 2063 cm–1 and decreases in intensity after heating to 373 K in 0.5 mbar of CO. After decreasing the CO pressure, the CO band disappears. The sample was subsequently annealed in 0.5 mbar of CO to 473 K, but no CO band was observed (data not shown). The sample was simultaneously investigated by NAP-XPS. Parts B, C, and D of Figure 7 show the C 1s, Pt 4f, and Ga 3d regions measured at photon energies of 530, 320, and 780 eV, respectively. In Figure 7B, we see a peak at 284.1 eV and a small feature at 286.7 eV, which changes as a function of CO pressure and temperature. Notably, the intensity of this feature changes in parallel to the intensity of the CO band in PM-IRAS.
The peak at 284.1 eV corresponds to carbon signal from HOPG, while the feature observed in C 1s spectra at 286.7 eV is attributed to CO adsorbed on Pt. (50) The evolution of intensities of the CO-related bands in NAP-XPS and PM-IRAS can be explained in view of the considerations above. After preparation in UHV, Pt is located mainly in the subsurface. With increasing CO pressure (10–2 mbar), more CO is adsorbed and more Pt migrates to the surface layer. The CO frequency indicated the presence of Pt in the form of small ensembles. In comparison to the IRAS experiments in UHV, the position of the band is blue-shifted implying somewhat higher Pt concentration at the surface, which is expected considering the difference in nominal composition (here Ga/Pt ≈ 2). The behavior upon annealing is similar to the one observed in UHV (see Figure 3), suggesting that the morphological development is similar in UHV and under near ambient pressure conditions.
NAP-XPS spectra of the Pt 4f region are shown in Figure 7C. We observe a doublet with a binding energy (BE) of the Pt 4f7/2 component of 71.5 eV. The signal is shifted by 0.6 eV to higher BE with respect to Pt(111) (see upper part of Figure 7C for comparison). The shift can be explained by alloying of Pt with Ga. Similar shifts to higher binding energies were previously reported for Pd–Ga and Pt–Ga. (12,15)
The corresponding Ga 3d spectra are shown in Figure 7D. Three components were fitted with BEs for Ga 3d5/2 of 18.8, 19.1, and 20.1 eV (components colored in blue, yellow, and red). For further details, see the Experimental Section. The red and yellow components appear during measurements at higher CO pressures. For comparison, we show also a Ga 3d spectrum of the Ga/HOPG sample (recorded prior to the Pt evaporation) in the upper part of Figure 7D. In this spectrum, the Ga 3d5/2 peak is located at 18.4 eV. The shift of this doublet to higher binding energy upon Pt deposition is attributed to alloying of Ga with Pt. A similar shift of the Ga 3d binding energy was observed by Grabau et al. when studying the alloying of Ga with Au. (51) The red and yellow components indicate the presence of Ga in higher oxidation states. The peaks of Ga2O3 are reported to appear around 20.5 eV. (52,53) Signals at the observed BEs of 20.1 and 19.1 eV are usually ascribed to Ga suboxides such as GaO and Ga2O. (54,55) A shift to higher binding energies by 0.15 eV was also observed for Pd–Ga exposed to 10 L CO. (56) However, the yellow component is observed also at 373 K in UHV when CO was no longer adsorbed in large quantities on the surface. Therefore, we ascribe both the components at 20.1 and 19.1 eV to suboxides of Ga. We propose that these suboxides are formed from oxygen-containing species in the background gas (e.g., water) or from the impurities in the CO at near ambient pressure conditions.
In principle, the partial oxidation of Ga at near-ambient pressures could lead to incorporation of Pt into GaOx, similarly to what was observed by Grabau et al. during oxidation of Pt–Ga to Pt–Ga2O3. (15) Even though this could explain the increase in Pt concentration on the surface at higher pressures, the fact that we see here only a negligible shift of Pt 4f to lower binding energies (instead of a shift by +0.9 eV reported in ref (15)) suggests that the appearance of the CO signal in both PM-IRAS and XPS is rather caused by the remaining mobility of the Pt species in the partially oxidized Ga.
4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
We have studied the thermal behavior and stability of a model SCALMS by IRAS in UHV, by AFM, and by PM-IRAS and NAP-XPS under near ambient pressure conditions. The model SCALMS were prepared by physical vapor deposition of Pt and Ga onto HOPG. Prior to metal deposition, the HOPG surface was modified by Ar+ bombardment. Adsorption of CO was used as a probe to study the surface composition and morphological changes by IRAS and by PM-IRAS. The morphological changes were also probed ex situ by AFM. Our findings are summarized as follows:
1. Behavior of Pt–Ga alloys at low temperatures: While Pt shows mobility in Ga at 300 K, the mobility is strongly suppressed at 110 K. Upon Ga deposition onto Pt in CO, Ga atoms eventually fully cover the surface of the formed nanoparticle. Upon subsequent annealing, individual Pt atoms migrate to the surface (160 K). The IR spectra of CO suggest a gradual increase in the Pt surface concentration without formation of larger Pt ensembles. On the other hand, Pt deposition onto Ga leads to formation of Pt single atom sites, which may be part of IMCs, together with larger Pt ensembles on the surface of Ga nanoparticles.
2. Influence of CO on the Pt diffusion into Ga: In the presence of CO, Pt diffusion from the surface to the subsurface region of a Ga nanoparticle is partially suppressed. The effect is ascribed to adsorbed CO which stabilizes Pt atoms at the surface.
3. Stability of Ga and Pt–Ga films during annealing: AFM measurements show that the morphological stability of the metal layers strongly depends on the nominal thickness of the deposit. For thin Ga films, agglomeration is less pronounced and mainly observed at temperatures above 600 K. For thicker films sintering is more pronounced and the Pt–Ga nanoparticles tend to agglomerate into very large particles. At higher temperature, sintering leads to separation of the Pt–Ga deposit into smaller aggregates, which contain a larger fraction of Pt (and possibly also partially oxidized Ga), and very large Ga-rich aggregates.
4. Pt/Ga/HOPG systems at near ambient pressure conditions: At higher CO pressures, the appearance of a CO stretching band and a larger C 1s CO adsorption signal suggests higher CO coverage and diffusion of Pt to the surface. Concurrently, we observe the formation of gallium suboxides. PM-IRAS and NAP-XPS suggest the formation of larger Pt ensembles in Pt-rich mixtures. With increasing temperature, CO is lost and Pt diffuses back into deeper layers. The process is accompanied by particle agglomeration.
5. Chemical changes observed by XPS: Alloying of Pt and Ga leads to shifts of the Pt 4f levels by 0.6 eV to higher binding energies with respect to Pt(111). A shift to higher BEs was also observed in the Ga 3d region. We also observed the formation of GaO and Ga2O suboxides in the NAP experiments. Formation of oxidized Ga species results from impurities in the background gas under NAP conditions.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
