The supplied document does not directly pertain to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation for converting propane to propylene. While it studies Pt-Ga alloy model systems, it does not evaluate their performance for propane dehydrogenation specifically. The document focuses on the characterization of the thermal behavior, morphology changes, and stability of Pt-Ga nanoparticles supported on graphite, rather than application for PDH or ODH. Since propane dehydrogenation is not discussed, I cannot extract details on conversion, selectivity, stability, or other catalyst performance metrics.
