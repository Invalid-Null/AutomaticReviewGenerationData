 Unfortunately this document does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on studying the mechanism of H/D hydrogen exchange between deuterated propane (propane-d8) and indium-modified zeolite catalysts. While it mentions that some propene and other products can form from propane during heating, propane dehydrogenation to propylene is not the main focus.
