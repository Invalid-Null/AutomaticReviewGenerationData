H/D Exchange of Propane on Indium-Modified Zeolite BEA Investigated by 1H MAS NMR In Situ
Abstract
The pathways of propane molecule activation on indium-modified zeolite have been studied by 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy in situ at temperatures of 453–573 K. The kinetics of H/D hydrogen exchange between propane-d8 and Brønsted acid sites (BAS) of the H-BEA zeolite, modified with indium species in the form of either InO+ or In+ cations (InO+/H-BEA and In+/H-BEA samples), were monitored. It is shown that the presence of either InO+ or In+ species in zeolite pores provides regioselectivity of the H/D exchange in methyl groups of the propane molecule. For the InO+/H-BEA zeolite, the process is characterized by greater rates and a lower activation energy compared to those for the unmodified H-form zeolite. The two-exponential kinetics of the exchange for InO+/H-BEA is rationalized in terms of two mechanisms: a direct mechanism assisted by the InO+ species and an indirect mechanism initiated by a propene intermediate. Both mechanisms provide the regioselectivity of the exchange and low activation energy. In+/H-BEA zeolite demonstrates less activity with regard to the rate of the exchange, but it shows a lower activation energy compared to H-BEA zeolite. It is inferred, for In+/H-BEA, that the mechanism of the direct regioselective exchange competes for the same BAS with the mechanism of unselective H/D exchange. The latter results in a specific growth of protium concentration in the methyl and methylene groups of propane-d8 upon the increase of the reaction temperature.

Light alkane transformation to valuable chemicals, including aromatic compounds and oxygenates, is an important constituent part of a worldwide strategy to make the industrial hydrocarbon processing more effective, cheap, and profitable. One of the promising ways for light alkane processing is a catalytic technology based on zeolites modified with metallic components (Zn, Ga, In, etc.). (1−5) Combination of the Brønsted acidity of zeolite framework and dehydrogenation activity of the metal species leads to outstanding catalytic activity of the metal-modified zeolite in a number of complex reaction steps providing light alkane aromatization. Additionally, the reaction may be directed toward the oxidative pathway because the metal sites usually exhibit redox properties. (6)
The activation of an alkane molecule is the most important step of alkane transformation. Considerable efforts were devoted to the fundamental studies of activation mechanisms upon alkane interaction with zeolites modified with Zn and Ga. (7,8) In particular, investigation of H/D hydrogen exchange of alkanes with zeolite Brønsted acid sites (BAS) was performed for establishing the mechanism for C–H bond activation and the related processes. (9−12) It has been shown that the presence of metal cationic species in the zeolite pores leads to regioselective H/D exchange in methyl groups of C3–C4 alkanes. It was suggested that a specific adsorption complex between methyl group of alkane and metal site preceded the exchange with BAS. The metal cations stabilized by framework (SiOAl)− sites facilitate the H/D exchange of alkane with the neighboring Brønsted acid site in the zeolite framework. Another hypothesis for the pathway of alkane activation suggested the heterolytic splitting of the C–H bond and the formation of metal–alkyl species as an intermediate in the H/D exchange reaction. However, it was demonstrated that kinetic parameters for metal–alkyl formation did not correlate with those for hydrogen exchange. (13) This implied that metal–alkyl formation and the H/D exchange represented two independent pathways of alkane activation. Furthermore, the hypothesis of the promoted H/D exchange due to increasing acidic strength of BAS located in vicinity of the Lewis acid sites (metal cations) (14) was not confirmed for Zn-modified zeolite. (15)
It was claimed that the activity for alkane aromatization of In- and Ga-modified zeolites was comparable. (16) However, systematic studies on the activation step are scares. Methane activation was studied by H/D exchange method on In-ZSM-5 zeolite containing either In+ or InO+ cationic species. (17) It was concluded that, compared to unmodified zeolite H-ZSM-5, the rate of H/D hydrogen exchange between methane and BAS of the zeolite increased one order of magnitude due to presence of In+ cations in pores of the zeolite. Two order of magnitude increase in the rate of H/D exchange was observed when In+ cations were substituted for InO+ cations. Significant increase of the rate and decrease activation energy for the H/D exchange indicated that reversible brake and formation of C–H bond was facilitated by the presence of InO+ species.
1H MAS NMR spectroscopy represents a powerful technique for investigating C1–C4 alkane activation mechanisms via monitoring of the kinetics of the H/D exchange in situ. (13,14,18−28) It was shown recently that this method allowed the evaluation of the kinetic parameters for the steps that were concurrent to direct H/D hydrogen exchange between alkane and BAS, e.g., for the step of intramolecular hydride transfer. (11,29) So, a detailed picture of the processes related to the direct or indirect C–H bond activation mechanisms can be established with the assessment of the corresponding kinetic parameters.
In this article, we have performed a kinetic study of the H/D exchange between deuterated propane-d8 and BAS of In-modified zeolite BEA to elucidate the role of In-species of different nature in the protolytic activation of propane upon interaction with In-modified zeolite. Two zeolite samples were prepared containing different indium species, either In+ or InO+ cations. Application of the 1H MAS NMR method for monitoring the H/D hydrogen exchange in situ allowed us to follow the protium content in the methyl and methylene groups of propane independently of each other. We have found that preferable activation of the C–H bonds in methyl groups occurs with lower activation energy on both zeolites containing either In+ or InO+ species. The presence of InO+ leads also to an additional indirect hydrogen exchange via the propene intermediate formed at propane dehydrogenation.

2.1. Zeolite Sample Preparation and Characterization
Zeolite BEA was synthesized using tetraethylammonium hydroxide as the templating agent following the procedure described in ref (30). The structure of the zeolite BEA was confirmed by XRD. The Si/Al atomic ratio was 19 as determined by ICP analysis. The zeolite sample was converted to NH4-form via the ion exchange with ammonium nitrate and calcined at 773 K to obtain the H-form. Further, the H-BEA zeolite was mixed mechanically with indium oxide (In2O3) in a mortar and treated in a flow of H2 (50 mL/min) at ramping the temperature up to 773 K with a rate of 7 K/min. The indium content in the resulting sample (In-BEA) was determined by chemical analysis to be approximately 5 wt. %. The sample of In-BEA zeolite was kept under air at ambient conditions.
Additional procedures were performed to prepare the final state of indium species in the form of either In+ or InO+ cations. First, adsorbed water was removed from In-BEA zeolite by evacuation at 673 K for 20 h (P < 10–3 Pa). Then, the sample was kept in H2 atmosphere (800 mbar) at 773 K for 30 min followed by evacuation at 673 K for 3 h. This procedure ensures a reduced state for indium particles. Thus, no partly oxidized state, which could possibly form after keeping the In-BEA sample in air and/or water, remains. The resulting sample is designated as In+/H-BEA. The In 3d5/2 core-level XPS spectrum shows the peak at 445.7 eV, evidencing that the main state of indium is In+. (31) To prepare the oxo-cations (InO+), the In+/H-BEA sample was oxidized by treatment in O2 atmosphere (800 mbar) at 623 K in a closed volume followed by evacuation at 673 K for 3 h. The resulting sample is designated as InO+/H-BEA. The XPS analysis showed increase of binding energy for the In 3d5/2 core-level peak up to 446.2 eV, (31) which confirms the InO+ presence as the main state for indium particles.
The detailed characterization of samples and the state of indium in the samples is given in ref. (31). Briefly, electron microscopy shows that the BEA zeolite samples represent crystals with the diameter of 0.35–0.75 μm. The EDX elemental mapping confirms uniform distribution of In atoms over the zeolite crystals. No particles of indium oxide In2O3 exist on the external surface of the zeolite crystals after the mechanical mixture In2O3 + H-BEA was treated in a H2 flow. (31) This is the evidence that indium species are transferred into zeolite pores.
27Al MAS NMR shows the presence of 4.2% of extra-framework aluminum atoms in both InO+/H-BEA and In+/H-BEA samples, (31) whereas 2.5% of extra-framework aluminum exist in the parent H-BEA zeolite.
The amount of surface OH groups was determined by 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy using adsorbed CH4 as internal intensity reference. (32) The accuracy of concentration determination by this method was ca. 10% for the bridged SiOHAl and silanol SiOH groups in the InO+/H-BEA sample. For In+/H-BEA zeolite, a broad signal from the surface bridged SiOHAl groups was observed, that gave larger error for the corresponding concentration. We have further verified the amount of accessible Brønsted acid sites by titration experiments with propane-d8 for both In+/H-BEA and InO+/H-BEA zeolites. A known amount of adsorbed deuterated propane was heated at 353 K for a prolonged time, and reaching the maximum (equilibrium) concentration of protium in propane was observed by a 1H MAS NMR spectrum recorded at room temperature. Table 1 shows the hydroxyl group concentrations that represent the consistent values of the two methods, the 1H MAS NMR with adsorbed CH4 and the titration experiment with propane-d8. Table 1 shows also the calculated unit cell compositions for the three BEA zeolite samples. To estimate the unit cell composition, we have taken into account the amount of extra-framework aluminum species from 27Al MAS NMR and the measured concentration of SiOHAl groups, and we have assumed that framework aluminum species does not change upon indium loading.

2.2. Materials
Tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEA–OH) water solution (30 wt. %, Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc.), sodium aluminate (Na2O·Al2O3·3H2O, Fisher Scientific Co.), colloidal silica water solution (28.9 wt. % SiO2, Alfa Aesar), NaCl and NH4NO3 (chemically pure, Reachim, Russia), In2O3 (99.9%, Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc.) were used without further purifications to synthesize the indium modified BEA zeolite samples. Industrially produced gases O2 (99%), H2 (99.99%) were used for oxidative and reductive treatments of In–zeolite.
Isotope reagents, propane-d8 (99% D) and propane-1-13C (99% 13C) were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc. These reagents were purified before use from possible admixtures (air, water vapor) by several freezing/thawing cycles in vacuum system. Methane CH4 (99%) was used as a standard for estimation of OH group quantity with 1H MAS NMR.
2.3. Kinetics Measurement
Kinetic measurements were performed by 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy in situ in a sealed glass ampules (diameter 5.5 mm) that could be tightly inserted into zirconia NMR rotor (outer diameter 7 mm). Zeolite sample In-BEA (90 mg) was placed into glass ampule, treated at elevated temperatures in vacuum and in the H2 (O2) atmosphere to prepare the In+/H-BEA or InO+/H-BEA samples (see Section 2.1). The known amount of propane-d8 (275 μmol g–1 with respect to dry zeolite sample) was loaded by adsorption from calibrated volume at liquid nitrogen temperature followed by sealing the glass ampule by flame. The sealed ampules were kept at liquid nitrogen temperature to prevent chemical conversion before the start of kinetic measurements. The parallel experiments with propane-1-13C were performed at a similar alkane loading (275 μmol g–1).
NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance-400 spectrometer (magnetic field 9.4 T). For 1H MAS NMR, the Hahn-echo pulse sequence (π/2−τ–π–τ–acquisition) was applied at resonance frequency of 400.13 MHz. The length of the π/2 pulse was 5 μs, and the delay τ was set to 333 μs in order to synchronize echo with the magic angle spinning (3 kHz). Twenty four scans were acquired per spectrum with repetition delays from 4 to 60 s. Kinetic measurements were started after preheating the sample in the NMR probe at ca. 373 K for 5 min, and then, the temperature was quickly raised to the desired target value and 1H MAS NMR spectrum recording was started after a short stabilization period. Approximately 5 min was required for the temperature to increase and be stabilized. Temperature of the sample was controlled by BVT-1000 variable-temperature unit, a 207Pb MAS NMR chemical shift thermometer method (33) was applied to calibrate the temperature inside the glass ampule within the NMR rotor. The Dmfit software (34) was used for deconvolution of the NMR spectra.
13C (CP)/MAS NMR spectra were recorded at the resonance frequency of 100.61 MHz at room temperature. High-power proton decoupling was performed at field strength of 11.7G (equivalent to 5 μs of the π/2 pulse). Also, the cross-polarization (CP) technique was applied to increase the signals from rigid surface species. The Hartmann–Hahn matching conditions were fulfilled at 50 kHz and the contact time of 2 ms was used. The repetition delay between scans was 2–10 s, the MAS spinning rate was 5–7 kHz, and the number of scans per spectrum was 1000–30000.

3.1. H/D Exchange of Propane-d8 on InO+/H-BEA
3.1.1. Regioselectivity of the Exchange
Figure 1 shows an evolution of the 1H MAS NMR spectra with time for propane-d8 adsorbed on the InO+/H-BEA zeolite. The first spectrum (bottom) displays the signal at 1.8 ppm of the silanol groups of the zeolite and two signals of small intensity from propane CH2 (1.25 ppm) and CH3 groups (0.8 ppm). In this spectrum, the intensity of signals of propane corresponds to residual protium content in the initial deuterated propane-d8. A significant increase of the intensity of the signal of the CH3 groups is observed with reaction time. This indicates that protium atoms are transferred to the methyl groups of deuterated propane, because of the H/D exchange of the alkane with zeolite hydroxyl groups. No significant increase is found for the intensity of the signal of the CH2 group. Therefore, the H/D exchange occurs regioselectively with the methyl groups of the alkane upon its interaction with the surface hydroxyl groups of the zeolite. The behavior is drastically different from that of unmodified H-form zeolites that perform H/D hydrogen exchange in both methyl and methylene groups of propane. (18,20,25) Thus, the presence of InO+ species in the zeolite pores induces the regioselectively of the exchange in the methyl groups of propane-d8.

3.1.2. Which OH Groups Are Involved in the Exchange?
The source of protium for the regioselective H/D exchange in propane is not obvious from our kinetics measurements with 1H MAS NMR in situ. There are at least three types of hydroxyl groups in InO+/H-BEA zeolite including terminal SiOH, extra-framework AlOH, and bridged SiOHAl that exhibit characteristic resonances in the 1H NMR spectrum at 1.8–2.0 ppm, 2.6–2.8 ppm, and 4–5 ppm, respectively. (35) Contrary to propane signals, the change of the intensity of the signals of OH groups cannot be quantitatively measured with short repetition delay of 4 s used for spectrum acquisition. The T1 relaxation times were estimated to be 1.2 s for SiOH, 1.5 s for AlOH, and 2.8 s for bridged SiOHAl, while T1 for propane signals was 0.3–0.5 s at temperature of 453–573 K for the kinetics measurement. Indeed, inspection of the 1.8–5 ppm region of the 1H MAS NMR spectra reveals nearly unchanged NMR intensities of OH groups during the kinetics measurements (see Figure S1) that cannot be correlated with the increasing intensity of the propane signal (0.8 ppm).
In order to establish the balance of protium atoms leaving zeolite and entering the alkane molecule in the course of the H/D exchange reaction, we have compared the 1H MAS NMR spectra of propane-d8 recorded at 296 K with long repetition delay to avoid spectrum saturation before and after kinetic measurements at 453 K (Figures S2). We have concluded that the bridged SiOHAl groups are the OH groups, which are involved in the H/D exchange with propane-d8. Also, the participation of the extra-framework AlOH groups could not be excluded, because we observed negative NMR intensity at ca. 2.6–2.8 ppm in the difference spectrum (Figure S2c). The SiOH groups are not involved in the exchange at this temperature. Thus, at 453 K propane exchanges hydrogen atoms mostly with bridged SiOHAl groups of InO+/H-BEA zeolite. A contribution from extra-framework aluminol sites cannot be excluded, but this one is difficult to evaluate quantitatively because the signal overlapping with bridged hydroxyls. We further ignore the contribution from AlOH sites in the H/D exchange because the extra-framework aluminum species is not abundant (4.2% of the overall aluminum content in the zeolite).
At 573 K, the SiOH groups becomes involved in the H/D exchange, which is clearly demonstrated by negative peak at ca. 1.8 ppm in the difference spectrum (Figure S3c). It is estimated that the total intensity of the SiOH groups decreases by ca. 20% after the H/D exchange reaction at 573 K for 24 h. Figure S4 shows that the involvement of silanol groups in the H/D exchange with propane-d8 on InO+/H-BEA zeolite increases with the reaction temperature. From these data, we conclude that the contribution of silanol groups to hydrogen exchange with propane-d8 can be noticeable at temperatures above ca. 480 K and becomes notable at higher temperatures. Contrary, the degree of the involvement of bridged SiOHAl groups in the H/D exchange seems to have no significant variation with temperature.
Involvement of zeolite silanol groups in the hydrogen exchange with alkanes was observed previously. (36) It was assigned to high acidity of some of silanol groups in the BEA zeolite structure as was estimated based on observed shift of the SiOH stretch in the FTIR spectrum due to CO adsorption. (37)
3.1.3. Kinetics of the H/D Exchange
Figure 2 shows kinetic curves for the H/D exchange in the CH3 and CH2 groups of propane-d8 on InO+/H-BEA zeolite in the temperature range of 453–573 K. The kinetics profile for the CH3 group shows a sharp growth in the initial part that changes further for less significant increase in the final part of the kinetic curve. Moreover, we observe an increase of maximum protium concentration reached by the end of the kinetics (from ca. 250 μmol/g at 453 K to ca. 400 μmol/g at 573 K). This behavior of the CH3 group kinetics may imply two different reaction pathways that lead to protium transfer to methyl groups (vide infra, Section 4). In order to assess activation barriers related to the initial and final parts of the CH3 kinetic curve, we have applied two-exponential model YCH3 = A – B × exp(−k1CH3t) – C × exp(−k2CH3t) that allow fairly good fitting of the experimental data by the least-squares method. The fitting curves are shown in Figure 2 and the corresponding rate constants k1CH3, k2CH3 are listed in Table 2. We note that the rate constant k1CH3 could not be reliably determined at the highest studied temperature of 573 K, because our method of kinetics registration implies the uncertainty of the temperature during the first 5 min of the reaction occurrence. This time is needed for stabilization of the temperature in the NMR probe. The initial part of the CH3 kinetic curve becomes too fast to be registered with 1H MAS NMR at this temperature. The rate constant k1CH3 determined for 573 K was not on the linear trend with other temperatures on Arrhenius plot (vide infra), and we did not take it into account for evaluating the activation energy (84 kJ mol–1, see Table 2).

The rate constants are listed in Table 2.

The CH2 groups of propane-d8 demonstrate a different behavior compared to the CH3 groups. Figure 2 shows that the protium concentration in the CH2 group is unchanged with time, it does not show any kinetics at all, except for temperature of 573 K where slight linear increase is observed for the CH2 group. Thus, the CH2 group in propane is not activated by the interaction with InO+/H-BEA at temperature below 573 K.
3.2. H/D Exchange of Propane-d8 on In+/H-BEA
3.2.1. Regioselectivity of the Exchange
Figure 3 shows 1H MAS NMR spectra of propane-d8 adsorbed on In+/H-BEA zeolite that were recorded successively with an increase of the reaction time. Increase the CH3 signal indicates that the methyl groups of propane molecule are involved in H/D hydrogen exchange with the surface OH groups. No significant growth is found for the CH2 group signal. Therefore, the H/D exchange occurs mainly with the methyl groups. Note however that In+/H-BEA zeolite is essentially less active for the H/D exchange reaction compared to InO+/H-BEA. The protium concentration in CH3 groups does not reach equilibrium by the end of kinetic measurements, see Figure 4. Figure S5 shows a wider spectral region for the stacked spectra from Figure 3. No additional kinetic information could be extracted from the 2–5 ppm region referred to OH signals due to saturation of the signals of OH groups because of large T1 values.

Permanent curves are the least-squares fits that correspond to first-order kinetic law Y = A – B × exp(−k × t) applied to both CH3 and CH2 kinetic curves (the corresponding rate constants, designated as kCH3 and kCH2, are listed in Table 2).
3.2.2. Which OH Groups Are Involved in the Exchange?
Figure S6 shows the 1H MAS NMR spectra accumulated with long repetition delay before and after kinetics measurements at 573 K. The difference spectrum (Figure S6c) indicates that protium atoms are transferred from both bridged SiOHAl and silanol groups to the methyl groups of deuterated propane at this temperature. However, the contribution from SiOH species decreases almost to zero by lowering the reaction temperature below 543 K as shown in Figure S4. This is different from the behavior of silanol groups in the InO+/H-BEA sample where they exhibit good activity in the H/D exchange at the same temperature. Thus, the presence of In+ cations in zeolite pores leads to lower overall activity toward regioselective H/D hydrogen exchange in methyl groups of propane and lower degree of the involvement of silanol groups in the exchange compared to zeolite with InO+ species.
3.2.3. Kinetics of the H/D Exchange
Figure 4 shows kinetic curves for protium in the CH3 and CH2 groups of propane-d8 on In+/H-BEA zeolite. Due to the lower activity of the In+/H-BEA sample, the equilibrium exchange level was not reached. Thus, only the initial kinetic period can be analyzed. The rate constants for H/D exchange were evaluated on the basis of the first-order kinetic law. However, the kinetic parameters for the CH2 group are determined with less accuracy because of the less pronounced increase of protium concentration in the experimental curve. The rate constants for the H/D exchange in the CH3 groups of propane were found to be ca. 100 times lower for In+/H-BEA zeolite compared to those for InO+/H-BEA zeolite (see Table 2), confirming the different activity of these two samples with respect to protolytic C–H bond activation in propane molecule.
The concentration changes of the CH2 groups in propane adsorbed on In+/H-BEA are remarkable. The protium concentration, accumulated by the methylene group, has a steady tendency to diminish at higher reaction temperatures (see Figures 4 and S7). This is an unexpected observation. At the same time, despite preferential exchange to the methyl group, both CH2 and CH3 groups exhibit similar rate constants in each experiment at the studied temperature range (cf. kCH2 and kCH3 in Table 2). This fact can be accounted for by the presence of two different pathways for the protium transfer to the methyl groups on In+/H-BEA zeolite. These two pathways for the exchange in the methyl groups should have different rates and compete with the exchange in the CH2 group for the same surface hydroxyls.
3.3. Activation Energy
The measured rate constants (Table 2) for the H/D exchange on InO+/H-BEA and In+/H-BEA zeolites are compared on the Arrhenius plot in Figure 5. Regioselective H/D exchange in methyl groups of propane on InO+/H-BEA required two rate constants (k1CH3 and k2CH3) to describe the experimental kinetics. The largest measured rate constants k1CH3, referred to the initial period of regioselective exchange in the methyl groups, exhibits an activation energy of 84 kJ mol–1. The rate constants k2CH3, describing the final period of the regioselective exchange, exhibit a lower activation barrier of 58 kJ mol–1. Significant difference between the activation barriers, corresponding to initial and final parts of the CH3 group curve, indicates two reaction pathways for the exchange on InO+/H-BEA zeolite for the transfer of protium between the OH groups of the zeolite and propane methyl groups. The pathway that is realized in the initial part of the reaction demonstrates higher exchange rate (k1CH3) and higher activation energy.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Arrhenius plots for the rate constants of the H/D exchange in propane-d8 on InO+/H-BEA (k1CH3, k2CH3) and In+/H-BEA (kCH3, kCH2). Data for the H/D exchange on unmodified H-form zeolite BEA (kHBEACH3) are taken from ref (11).
The hydrogen exchange in the methyl groups of propane on In+/H-BEA has the activation energy of 86 kJ mol–1. This value is similar to that one for the fast kinetics component on InO+/H-BEA (84 kJ mol–1), though the exchange rate ca. 2 orders of magnitude slower on In+/H-BEA (cf. k1CH3 and kCH3). It should be also noted that the measured activation barriers and rate constants for the exchange between the CH3 and CH2 groups in propane on In+/H-BEA are similar (see Table 2), despite the protium exchange level being much lower for the CH2 group compared to that for CH3 groups. It should be emphasized that the measured activation barriers in this study refer to the intrinsic activation energies because, under the conditions used, the main contribution in the NMR signal occurs from the propane molecules adsorbed in zeolite pores. (38)
To compare the kinetics of the H/D exchange on In-modified zeolites with that on unmodified H-form zeolite, we plot additionally the data (kHBEACH3) on the exchange for the methyl group in propane on H-BEA (11) (Figure 5). The activation barrier for the H/D exchange on H-BEA is 112 kJ mol–1, while we observe lower activation energy (84–86 kJ mol–1) for both In-modified zeolites, InO+/H-BEA and In+/H-BEA. Thus, the protolytic cleavage of the C–H bonds in the methyl groups of propane is less energetically demanding process in the presence of cationic indium species (InO+ or In+). A similar result was observed for H/D hydrogen exchange with deuterated methane (17) on the In-modified ZSM-5 zeolite that was prepared by the similar procedure. However, we observe significantly lower rates for the H/D exchange in propane-d8 on both InO+/H-BEA and In+/H-BEA as compared to the corresponding data for methane-d4 on In-modified ZSM-5 zeolite. (17) Taking into account that In-content and BAS amount are approximately the same, we tentatively suggest that the different zeolite topology for the ZSM-5 material may promote hydrogen exchange better in the presence of indium species in the zeolitic pores.
3.4. Propane Conversion on In-Modified BEA Zeolite
An important question to elucidate is the chemical conversion of propane that may occur concurrently with the H/D exchange process discussed above. We have performed the additional experiments with propane-1-13C that was adsorbed on the zeolite samples and heated for prolonged time at temperatures 453–573 K. 13C MAS NMR revealed the formation of propene with the signals at 19 and 125 ppm and the carboxylate fragment exhibiting the signal at 31 ppm at 453 K (Figure S8a). (31) The overall propane conversion at 453 K was estimated from quantitative 13C MAS NMR data to be ca. 10%. At higher temperature, 553 K, propane conversion increases up to 20%. The main product is carbon dioxide (CO2), exhibiting the signal at 125 ppm in the 13C MAS NMR (Figure S8c). The surface products are represented by aromatics (most probably toluene with the signals 130 and 20 ppm) and carboxylate species (probably acetate and propionate with the signals at 187, 31, and 8.7 ppm), as shown by the 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum (Figure S8d).
Thus, 10–20% propane conversion could be reached by the end of monitoring of the H/D exchange kinetics with propane-d8 (ca. 1200 min) on InO+/H-BEA zeolite. At the same time, no chemical transformation occurred with propane on In+/H-BEA after prolonged heating at 573 K (Figure S9). Therefore, we conclude that monitoring of the H/D exchange with propane-d8 on In+/H-BEA zeolite is not accompanied by any other propane reaction in the range of 493–573 K.
4. Discussion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Monitoring of the H/D exchange of propane-d8 on In-modified zeolites, InO+/H-BEA and In+/H-BEA, reveals a peculiar picture of protium transfer from the OH groups to the alkane molecule. In particular, the regioselectivity of the exchange in the methyl groups is detected. Evidently, it is obliged to the presence of In species in zeolite pores, because both the methyl and methylene groups of propane are involved in the exchange for pure H-form zeolites. (18,20,25) The mechanism of the promoting effect of In species, providing regioselectivity of the exchange and its notable acceleration as compared to H-form zeolites, may be similar to that inferred for Zn-modified zeolites. (11,22,26) It presumes the formation of molecular complex of propane with In species preceding the exchange with BAS of the zeolite. Only the methyl group is activated by the interaction with In species in this complex. The methylene group of propane may be not accessible for interaction with In species because of specific mutual disposal of In species and BAS in zeolite pores (spatial hindrances).
4.1. H/D Exchange on InO+/H-BEA
On InO+/H-BEA zeolite, two-exponential kinetics is observed for the regioselective exchange in the methyl groups with two rate constants (k1CH3, k2CH3), describing fast initial kinetic period and slower final part of the kinetics. There are several possibilities to account for this observation.
Two different types of Brønsted acid sites (BAS) are involved in the exchange. The first type of BAS is SiOHAl sites presumably located in vicinity of InO+ species. The second one is SiOHAl sites without neighboring indium species. The exchange of the alkane with the first type of BAS with Ea = 84 kJ mol–1 is promoted by vicinal InO+ species. (17) The second type of BAS remoted from the InO+ species should demonstrate the pristine H/D exchange activity (kHBEACH3) with propane-d8 typical for unmodified H-BEA zeolite. (11) This suggestion is discarded by the Arrhenius plot (Figure 5) showing the activation energies of 58 kJ mol–1 for the rate constant k2CH3 different from that on the H-BEA zeolite (kHBEACH3, 112 kJ mo1–1 (11)). Moreover, the involvement of the CH2 group in the exchange should be also detected with the second type of BAS; however, it is not the case.
An alternative for this possibility is that two different types of BAS are represented by framework SiOHAl site and terminal SiOH group. Both of them should be located in vicinity of InO+ species. We have shown (vide supra) that a part of SiOH groups is indeed involved in H/D hydrogen exchange with propane-d8 (see Figures S3 and S4). In this case, one can relate faster exchange (k1CH3) to the exchange with more acidic SiOHAl sites, and slower exchange (k2CH3) should be related with generally accepted less acidic SiOH sites. However, acidity estimation of SiOH of the H-BEA zeolite clearly showed high acid strength of some of SiOH groups similar to that of SiOHAl groups. (37) Within this alternative, it remains unclear why for SiOHAl and SiOH with similar acid strengths the activation barrier for the exchange with one of them, e.g., SiOH groups, decreases to a lower value (58 kJ mol–1) compared to the exchange with the other OH (SiOHAl) groups (84 kJ mol–1) due to the presence of InO+ species in the zeolite pores. Thus, we conclude two-exponential kinetics with rate constants k1CH3 and k2CH3, and the corresponding different values of Ea cannot be rationalized in terms of the involvement of BAS of different types in the H/D exchange of propane-d8 on InO+/H-BEA.
Observation of the kinetic profile with two rate constants (k1CH3 and k2CH3) cannot be related to the fact that propane is partly converted to other products on InO+/H-BEA zeolite. One could suggest that the majority of the active sites are poisoned by the adsorbed products formed from propane at the middle of the kinetic curves in Figure 2, where the fast increase of the kinetic curve is stopped. However, the overall level of protium content in propane, including the final part of these kinetic curves, increases with reaction temperature that contradicts poisoning of the active sites. We thus infer that k1CH3 and k2CH3 may reflect different mechanisms of the H/D exchange providing such specific kinetics for the protium transfer from BAS to the methyl groups of propane-d8.
Having excluded the effect of BAS of different types and chemical conversion of propane, the observed kinetics may be rationalized in terms of two mechanisms of the exchange providing both regioselectivity of the exchange and two- exponential kinetics (Scheme 1). The fast hydrogen exchange in the initial period, performed with k1CH3, may occur via the direct H/D exchange between surface BAS and the methyl groups of propane with assistance of InO+ species. Promoting effect of InO+ species provides high rate and the activation energy of 84 kJ mol–1, which is lower than Ea = 112 kJ mol–1 for the exchange on H-BEA zeolite. The promoted hydrogen exchange results in relatively fast equilibration of protium between propane methyl groups and the Brønsted acid sites located in vicinity of InO+ species. This equilibration is finished within ca. 100–400 min of reaction time at temperatures 453–573 K (Figure 2). Further accumulation of protium content in methyl group of propane-d8 becomes impossible by this mechanism. The slower increase of protium content in the final part of the CH3 group kinetic curves, with the rate constant k2CH3, may result from another mechanism providing the regioselectivity of the exchange as well. This mechanism is represented by the indirect H/D hydrogen exchange of the alkane with BAS with the assistance of the olefin (propene) intermediate. (11,39) Formation of some quantity of propene in the course of the H/D exchange reaction is confirmed by the 13C MAS NMR spectra (see Figure S8 and ref (31)). Protonation of propene molecule by BAS forms an isopropyl cation that is able to abstract hydride from the other propane molecule, resulting in selective transfer of protium from BAS to the methyl groups of propane. The propene intermediate may scavenge protiums from BAS located distantly from InO+ cations, which explains why the accumulated protium content in methyl groups further increase in the final part of the kinetics (Figure 2).
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Two Possible Pathways for Protium Transfer from BAS to Methyl Groups of Propane-d8 on InO+/H-BEA Zeolite
Two suggested mechanisms of the exchange accounts for the particular features of the experimental kinetic curves for propane CH3 group on InO+/H-BEA zeolite (Figure 2), including two different rate constants for the initial and final periods and the variation of maximum exchangeable protiums quantity with temperature at the final period. The exchangeable protium quantity exhibits the trend to increase with temperatures that is explained by the increase of the quantity of the formed propene intermediate that provides protium transfer from BAS to the methyl groups.
It appears from the Arrhenius plot in Figure 5 that the indirect H/D exchange via propene intermediate at the final kinetics part represents the less energetically demanding process as compared to the process of the direct exchange with the assistance of InO+ species in the initial part of the kinetics. The activation barrier of 84 kJ mol–1 for the exchange in the initial period of the reaction is similar to Ea for the regioselective H/D exchange of the alkanes on the zeolites promoted with various metal cationic species (ca. 74–105 kJ mol–1 (9,11,17,29,40)). On the other hand, the observed activation barrier for the exchange with k2CH3 (58 kJ mol–1, Table 2) corresponds to Ea for the exchange in alkanes by the mechanism of indirect exchange via the olefin intermediate realized on solid acid catalysts (ca. 51–58 kJ mol–1 (19,27,29)). Thus, the measured Ea for the initial and final parts of the kinetics are in line with literature data for the suggested mechanisms of the exchange.
4.2. H/D Exchange on In+/H-BEA
Lower rates of the H/D exchange in the CH3 groups of propane-d8 are observed for the In+/H-BEA zeolite compared to InO+/H-BEA, but the activation energies are similar (Table 2). Hence, In+ cations modify similarly the mechanism of the H/D exchange with respect to that on the H-form of the zeolite. (20,25,41,42) Formally, the lower rate on In+/H-BEA may indicate larger entropy contribution affecting pre-exponential factor for the rate constant, compared to that on InO+/H-BEA. Note however that the kinetics profiles for CH3 and CH2 groups (Figure S7) indicate the presence of the additional (second) reaction pathway that redistribute protiums in to methyl groups at the expense of methylene groups. The redistribution effect increases with the reaction temperature. This implies that the second pathway of the exchange performs with a larger activation barrier or is to be induced by some intermediate species accumulated in larger amounts with the increase in temperature. Both reaction mechanisms should compete for exchangeable hydroxyl groups, which is of principal importance in order to account for the ratio of protium level in the CH3 and CH2 groups (Figures 4 and S7) at similar rate constants for these groups (Table 2). Involvement of olefinic species (propene) in the exchange could not be realized, because such an intermediate is not formed in the case with In+/H-BEA (see Figure S9). Thus, the two exchange mechanisms are bound with the properties of In+ cations affecting the interaction between propane-d8 and BAS on the In+/H-BEA zeolite sample. Presumably, one of the pathways is the regioselective H/D exchange between CH3 group and a surface OH group located near In+ cations. The other pathway is unselective protium transfer from the same OH groups to both the CH3 and the CH2 groups of propane molecule. Provided that regioselective pathway is activated at higher temperatures, the kinetic behavior could be like that one observed experimentally (Figure 4). In this study, we have managed to estimate only the effective rate constant for CH3 groups on the basis of the first-order kinetic law. This does not allow to perform a comparison of the exchange for propane-d8 with some previously published data, e.g., the more straightforward case of methane (CD4) exchange on ZSM-5 zeolite modified with either In+ or InO+. (17)
5. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Kinetics of H/D hydrogen exchange between propane-d8 and Brønsted acid sites (BAS) of the In-modified BEA zeolites, InO+/H-BEA and In+/H-BEA, was monitored by 1H MAS NMR spectroscopy in situ at 453–573 K. The regioselectivity of the exchange in the methyl groups of the alkane molecule was detected for both In-modified zeolites. The rate of the exchange is two orders of magnitude higher on InO+/H-BEA compared to that on In+/H-BEA zeolite. At the same time, the rate of the exchange is one order of magnitude higher on InO+/H-BEA and lower on In+/H-BEA zeolite compared to unmodified H-form zeolite BEA. These facts show a promoting effect of indium species loaded in zeolite on the performance of the reaction of H/D hydrogen exchange. Two-exponential kinetics of the regioselective exchange was revealed for InO+/H-BEA zeolite. It was rationalized in terms of two different mechanisms providing the regioselectivity and acceleration of the exchange compared to H-BEA zeolite. According to the first mechanism (it is called a direct exchange with assistance of In species), the adsorption complex is formed by the interaction of InO+ species with the methyl group of propane. Thus, the activated methyl group of the alkane is further involved in the exchange with BAS of the zeolite. The second mechanism (the mechanism of indirect exchange) contributes to the H/D exchange after accumulation of propene formed in small quantities in the alkane dehydrogenation. Deuterated propene is protonated by BAS to form an isopropyl cation with protium label in the methyl group. The cation abstracts further hydride (deuteride) ion from the incoming propane-d8, affording propane with a protium label in the methyl group.
For In+/H-BEA zeolite, two competitive pathways were suggested, providing protium transfer to methyl groups of the propane molecule. One of the pathways may be a promoted H/D hydrogen exchange between the methyl group and the surface OH group located near the In+ cation. The other pathway is unselective protium transfer from the same OH group to the CH3 and CH2 positions in the propane molecule.

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. Stack plot of 1H MAS NMR spectra of propane-d8 adsorbed on InO+/H-BEA zeolite in the vicinity of 0.4–2.6 ppm at 473 K. The first spectrum (bottom) was recorded 5 min after the temperature was raised to 473 K. The time between subsequent spectra recording was 20 min.
Figure 2
Figure 2. Kinetics of the H/D exchange in the CH3 and CH2 groups of propane-d8 on InO+/H-BEA zeolite. Points represent experimental data. Permanent curves are the least-squares fits that correspond to equations YCH3 = A – B × exp(−k1CH3 × t) – C × exp(−k2CH3 × t) and YCH2 = A – B × exp(−kCH2 × t), where rate constants k1CH3, k2CH3, kCH2 and values A, B, and C are treated as free parameters. The rate constants are listed in Table 2.
Figure 3
Figure 3. Stack plot of 1H MAS NMR spectra of propane-d8 adsorbed on In+/H-BEA zeolite in the vicinity of 0.3–2.5 ppm at 493 K. The first spectrum (bottom) was recorded 5 min after the temperature was raised to 493 K. The time between subsequent spectra recording was 60 min.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Kinetics of the H/D exchange in the CH3 and CH2 groups of propane-d8 on In+/H-BEA zeolite. Points represent experimental data. Permanent curves are the least-squares fits that correspond to first-order kinetic law Y = A – B × exp(−k × t) applied to both CH3 and CH2 kinetic curves (the corresponding rate constants, designated as kCH3 and kCH2, are listed in Table 2).
Figure 5
Figure 5. Arrhenius plots for the rate constants of the H/D exchange in propane-d8 on InO+/H-BEA (k1CH3, k2CH3) and In+/H-BEA (kCH3, kCH2). Data for the H/D exchange on unmodified H-form zeolite BEA (kHBEACH3) are taken from ref (11).

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
