The given document does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation to propylene. It focuses on investigating the mechanisms of H/D hydrogen exchange between propane molecules and indium-modified zeolite catalysts using NMR spectroscopy. While it mentions that some propene is formed during the exchange reactions, especially on InO+/H-BEA, this appears to be a secondary process and the focus is on analyzing the kinetics and mechanisms of the H/D exchange specifically. There is no discussion of converting propane to propylene or using the catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions. Therefore, I do not believe this document contains the key information needed to assess advancements in PDH or ODH catalyst performance.
