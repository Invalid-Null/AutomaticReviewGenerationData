The document discusses propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene over zirconia (ZrO2) catalysts. It does not discuss oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The key points are:

- The nanostructure and crystallite size of bare ZrO2 catalysts significantly affects activity, selectivity, and coke formation in PDH. Smaller crystallites give higher activity and selectivity.

- DFT calculations suggest zirconium cations located at oxygen vacancies are the active sites for homolytic C-H bond activation. This differs from previous mechanisms invoking metal cations with neighboring lattice oxygen. 

- Bare ZrO2 with 9 nm crystallites shows superior PDH performance compared to state-of-the-art catalysts with CrOx, GaOx, VOx, and even Pt. No promoters or supported metals are needed.

- The feed gas contains only propane and nitrogen. No oxidizing agent is present, indicating this is PDH not ODH.

- The main scientific contribution is using nanostructured bare ZrO2 as an efficient PDH catalyst without added promoters/metals. Performance is enhanced by controlling crystallite size to increase active sites and limit coking.
