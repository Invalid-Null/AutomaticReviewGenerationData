Propane Oxidative Dehydrogenation on Nanosized Boron Carbide: Effect of Boron Content and Its Oxidation Implicated by DFT Calculations
Abstract
Metal-free boron-containing materials are growing to be promising choices in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to alkenes, while it remains unclear how the boron content and the second element that constitutes the scaffold to accommodate B in the materials may influence their catalytic activity. Herein, by means of the density functional theory study of nanosized boron carbide, we studied the mechanisms of ODH of propane (ODHP) catalyzed by three types of boron carbides, B13C2, B4C, and h-BC, which differ from each other in their B contents and their chemical topologies. The influence of hydroxyl coverage on the surface was also evaluated to address the structure–catalytic activity relationship in the ODHP reaction. The calculations show that (1) the B element content and the hydroxyl groups could regulate the electronic structure and significantly increase the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy to promote chemical reactivity. (2) Boron carbide with higher coverage of hydroxyl groups on the surface (B13C2-H and B4C-H) exhibits higher activity for catalyzing ODHP reaction owing to the enhanced nucleophilicity, which is further confirmed by the noncovalent interaction (NCI) analysis. (3) The reactivity of the catalyst is positively correlated with the B content, and the ODHP catalyzed by B13C2 is kinetically more favorable than that by B4C and h-BC. This study is expected to enrich our understanding of the structure–activity relationship of boron-based catalysts in the ODH system and benefit the optimization of the catalytic systems.

Light olefins, such as propene, are essential chemical building blocks in the chemical industry for a vast array of polymers and fine chemicals. (1−5) The global production of propene exceeds 100 Mt/year since 2017, and the industrial demand for propene continues growing, which is forecasted to reach 130 million tons in 2023. (6−8) Conventional production methods for propene, such as steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, are tremendously energy demanding and increase environmental concerns. (9) The dehydrogenation of propane, either via direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) and oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODHP), offers an alternative method with high atom economy in propene production. (10) Compared with the PDH process, which requires much higher reaction temperature and can cause rapid coking of the catalyst detrimental to propene selectivity, (11,12) the ODHP process is free of thermodynamic equilibrium and exhibits good coking resistance. (13−16)
Earlier studies applied metalloxides, e.g., V2O5, MoO3, and NiO, and alkaline-earth metal oxychlorides as the catalysts, and high ODHP reactivity was reported. (9,17−19) On these metal-based catalysts, the ODHP proceeds following a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, and the surface dangling bond can detain and activate the propene. This could lead to serious deep oxidation of propene to COx, causing significant CO2 emission and low propene selectivity, which is the major obstacle to industrialize these catalytic systems. (20−22) In recent years, endeavors to search for highly selective catalyst for ODHP with low COx yields have discovered boron-based materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), elemental boron, (23) the B2O3 catalyst, (24) silicon boride, (25) boron carbide, (26) and so on, (27) showing remarkable catalytic activity independently reported by Hermans, (28,29) Lu, (30,31) and Su (32) and co-workers. The catalytic performance to achieve high propene selectivity is inherently related to the formed oxidized B active centers (B–O, B–OH, and B(OH)xO3–x). (9,33)
Mechanistic studies revealed a complex reaction network in the boron-based ODHP systems featured by the coplay of on-surface channels and gaseous channels, and the abundant elementary reaction steps were grouped into three stages, initialization, propagation, and termination. (34) The studies also showed the dependence of mechanism on the composition of the catalyst and identified the rate-determining step being the dehydrogenation of >B–OH groups in the ODH catalyzed by h-BN (30,31,35) while being the activation of propane in the ODH catalyzed by supported boron oxide and boron phosphide. (36,37) In the study of BP-catalyzed ODHP, higher oxidation extent of BP surface, i.e., higher coverage of hydroxyl groups, was found to enhance its catalytic activity. The unique ability of the boron-based ODH systems to remarkably suppress deep oxidation of propane was also investigated, which was attributed to two reasons: (1) the rich presence of boron peroxo, a mild oxidant, enhances the selectivity for the dehydrogenation of 2o-H over 1o-H, resulting in a higher yield of iso-propyl radical than n-propyl intermediate. (38) (2) The surface boron sites could eliminate alkoxy radical intermediates in their vicinity, which inhibits the further oxidation of alkoxy to deep oxidation products. (39)
Among the abundant boron-rich compounds, boron carbide represents a family of binary materials mainly with a stoichiometric ratio of B13C2 and B4C, both of which have potentials as superhard materials. (40) B4C is a p-type semiconductor with outstanding physical and chemical characteristics. (41−45) In the crystal structure of B13C2, the vertices of the boron carbide rhombohedral cell are replaced by C atoms. (40,46)
Recent studies have shown that boron-containing materials, such as boron oxide and boron nitride, display reactivity in the ODHP reaction, and efforts have been devoted to elucidating the underlying mechanism. (36,47−52) It remains unclear how B extent may regulate the electronic structure of boron carbide and influence its catalytic reactivity. (53) This motivated the present study by exploring the ODHP mechanism at the B-containing materials B13C2, B4C, and h-BC to address how the ratio of B in boron carbide and its oxidation affect the catalytic activity in the ODHP reaction. This work is expected to benefit the design and optimization of boron-containing catalysts with improved activity in the alkane ODH reactions.

Quantum chemistry calculations were carried out by using the Gaussian 09 package, (54) employing the B3LYP functional together with the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set. (55−58) Vibrational frequency calculations (59) were conducted to identify each stationary point as a saddle point or an energy minimum and to obtain zero-point energy and entropic corrections at 298.15 K and 1 atm. The intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations were employed to verify the transition state and the two minima it connected in each elementary reaction step. (60,61) The energies were refined at the B3LYP-D3/6-311++G(2df,2pd) level of theory.
The Fukui functions were calculated and proposed by Parr and Yang (62−64) in a finite difference scheme as implemented in the Multiwfn (65,66) program

For this purpose, three boron carbides (B13C2, B4C, and h-BC) were considered, and for the compromise of accuracy and computational cost, nanosized models truncated properly from the three types of boron carbides were used to represent the active sites and their vicinity on the surface (Figure 1) in order to evaluate the influence of the ratio of B element on the ODHP reaction. Their oxidized models were prepared to investigate how the coverage of hydroxyl groups on the surface may regulate their reactivity. Both the ground state (3∑g–) and the first excited state (1Δg) of dioxygen were considered by setting appropriate multiplicity (three for triplet and one for singlet) of the model systems. Since the singlet state has higher energy than the triplet state and its generation from the triplet state is low under thermodynamic condition, here we focus on the reactions of dioxygen in its triplet state.

3.1. Electronic Density of States of Boron Carbides in Their Native and Oxidized States
The B13C2, B4C, and h-BC (Figure 1) were used to study the influence of boron content in boron carbides on their electronic structural properties. The total density of states (TDOS) of B13C2, B4C, and BC and the partial density of states (PDOS) of B element in these three systems were calculated and are shown in Figure 2b–d. For comparison, the TDOS analysis of the B cluster is shown in Figure 2a, and the PDOS of the C element in boron carbides is given in Figure S1. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level is indicated by the vertical dashed line.

The presence of B element significantly influences the density of states, and with the increase of boron content, the HOMO energy gradually goes up (−12.6 eV (h-BC), −7.88 eV (B4C), −6.26 eV (B13C2), and −4.52 eV (B)). In other words, a higher boron content in boron carbides increases their HOMO level. The major components of HOMO in B13C2 and B4C are the py (90.5%) and pz (53.7%) orbitals of the B atom. The HOMO of the h-BC cluster is mainly composed of the C pz orbitals (66.5%). These values indicate that the B and C contributions in the HOMO orbitals of B13C2, B4C, and h-BC are positively correlated with their percentages, i.e., the contribution of B atoms increases monotonously (33.5, 53.7, and 90.5%) as the B content goes up (50, 80, and 87 at %).
Oxygenated boron species on the boron-containing materials, e.g., the B–OH sites, have been considered to be responsible for the catalytic ability of the materials in the ODH reactions. (34,75) These species can be created during the fabrication of the catalysts (native >B–OH sites) and bred by hydrolyzing the surface B–O–B bridges during the reaction (in situ generated >B–OH sites). In order to obtain an in-depth understanding of the active sites of boron carbides and the origin of their catalytic ability in the ODHP reaction, the three boron carbide materials (B13C2, B4C, and h-BC; Figure 1), which differ from each other in their B/C ratios (87, 80, and 50 at %, respectively) and topologies (cage-like for the former two and hexagonal for the third), were chosen to prepare the oxygenated boron carbide catalysts (Figure 3). For the cage-like B13C2 and B4C, to investigate the influence of the coverage of hydroxyl groups, two types of models differing in the coverage of hydroxyl groups at the surface B sites were prepared with B13C2-L/B4C-L sparsely hydroxylated (Figure 3d,e) and B13C2-H/B4C-H highly hydroxylated (Figure 3b,c). For the two-dimensional hexagonal boron carbide (h-BC), three types of oxygenated edges, zigzag-B_OH, armchair_OH, and zigzag-C_OH, were considered (Figure 3f–h).

The highly surface-hydroxylated cage-like models: (b) B13C2-H and (c) B4C-H; the sparsely surface-hydroxylated cage-like models: (d) B13C2-L and (e) B4C-L; the edge-hydroxylated h-BC models: (f) zigzag-B_OH, (g) armchair_OH, and (h) zigzag-C_OH.
The total density of states (TDOS) for B13C2-L/B4C-L and B13C2-H/B4C-H are plotted in Figure 4. The partial densities of states (PDOS) of the O and H are also shown to evaluate their contribution to the TDOS. Redistribution of TDOS and HOMO energies was observed in the hydroxylated models for B13C2 and B4C. In the highly hydroxylated models (B13C2-H and B4C-H), O atoms contributed more to the TDOS than H atoms in the energy range of −16 to −4 eV, mainly attributed to their 2p orbitals. In the sparsely hydroxylated models (B13C2-L/B4C-L), the opposite phenomenon was observed and the PDOS of H atoms is more significant than that of O atoms in the frontier region (energy range of −12 to −6 eV). Meanwhile, the high coverage of hydroxyl groups could increase the HOMO energy level in view of the higher HOMO energy level in the highly hydroxylated models (−5.876 eV for B13C2-H and −6.411 eV for B4C-H) than in the sparsely hydroxylated models (−6.142 eV for B13C2-L and −7.246 eV for B4C-L).

3.2. Activation of Surface Sites
In the initial stage of the ODHP reaction, two active species, >BO• and •OOH, were generated from the activation of atmospheric dioxygen at the >B–OH site. In this stage, we considered both the densely hydroxylated (B13C2-H and B4C-H) and sparsely hydroxylated (B13C2-L and B4C-L) surfaces of B13C2 and B4C, as well as the oxygenated edges of h-BC (zigzag-B_OH, armchair_OH, and zigzag-C_OH). The structures of the stationary points and their relative free energies are collected in Tables 1 and 2.
Table 1. Key Stationary Points and Relative Free Energies (ΔG≠ and ΔG, kcal/mol) in the Dehydrogenation of the B13C2-L, B13C2-H, B4C-L, and B4C-H Surface >B–OH Sites to Produce Active B–O• Species
Table 2. Key Stationary Points and Relative Free Energies (ΔG≠ and ΔG, kcal/mol) in the Dehydrogenation of the >B–OH Sites at the Zigzag-B_OH, Armchair_OH, and Zigzag-C_OH Edge Modes of h-BC to Produce Active B–O• Species
For the B13C2 catalyst, the free-energy barriers to the dehydrogenation of >B–OH by O2(T0), which produces >B–O• and •OOH species, are 40.7 kcal/mol on B13C2-L and 35.1 kcal/mol on B13C2-H, respectively (Table 1). For the B4C catalyst, these values are calculated to be 43.2 kcal/mol for B4C-L and 38.7 kcal/mol for B4C-H, respectively (Table 1). These high reaction barriers implicate that an induction period may exist in the boron carbide-catalyzed ODHP reaction, consistent with the experimental work. (23)
In general, there are two ways to lower free-energy barriers: the destabilization of reactants or the stabilization of transition states. To understand the underlying mechanisms that cause the lowering of free-energy barriers to the dehydrogenation reactions on the highly hydroxylated surfaces, the bond orders of the activated O–H bonds and the NPA charge distributions in these transition states were calculated to analyze the electronic properties of the transition states. The bond orders of the O–H bonds in B13C2-H-TS1 (0.48) and B4C-H-TS1 (0.49) are higher than that in B13C2-L-TS1 (0.40) and B4C-L-TS1 (0.37). And the O–H bond order difference between the corresponding RC1 and TS1 follows the order of B13C2-H-TS1 (0.56–0.48 = 0.08) < B4C-H-TS1 (0.59–0.49 = 0.10) < B13C2-L-TS1 (0.53–0.40 = 0.16) < B4C-L-TS1 (0.57–0.37 = 0.20), which matches the calculated reaction energy barrier trend. The data indicate that the O–H bonds on the highly hydroxylated surfaces have weaker covalency than those on the sparsely hydroxylated surfaces in the RC1 while stronger in the TS1, suggesting that the active site experienced smaller change when going from RC1 to TS1 on the surfaces with higher coverage of hydroxyl groups (B13C2-H and B4C-H models).
Meanwhile, the NPA charges of the migrating H atom of B13C2-H-TS1 (0.47e) and B4C-H-TS1 (0.49e) are marginally more positive than those of B13C2-L-TS1 (0.45e) and B4C-L-TS1 (0.45e), which agrees with the lower covalency of the O–H bond in the former than the latter. These data show that on the densely hydroxylated catalyst models (B13C2-H and B4C-H), the >B–OH groups are more activated to be dehydrogenated by O2(T0) than those on the sparsely hydroxylated models B13C2-L and B4C-L, which results in differences in their free-energy barriers of 5.6 and 4.5 kcal/mol, respectively. This is attributed to the enhancement of the electrophilicity of the >B–OH sites with higher coverage of hydroxyl groups on the surface. The topological parameters of the electron density at the bond critical point (ρbcp) and its Laplacian (∇2ρ(r)) and the bond ellipticity (ε) (76) of the >BO–H bond in the transition states were calculated to characterize the nature of the dehydrogenation in different catalyst models (Table S1), further confirming the above bond order analysis.
The population analysis (Figure S3) showed that upon the dehydrogenation of surface >B–OH sites of B13C2-L, B13C2-H, B4C-L, and B4C-H (IM1), the spin density was not confined on the dehydrogenated >B–O site but able to delocalize to their neighboring boron sites of the B13C2 and B4C cages. This is different from the cases of h-BN where the spin density is localized only on the dehydrogenated >B–O• site.
It merits a discussion on the difference in the spin density distribution in the B13C2 and another two binary boron-containing materials, BP (37) and h-BN, (77) upon the dehydrogenation at their surface >B–OH site. In B13C2 and BP, besides the reactive oxygen species, the spin density may also delocalize to the B sites of the B13C2 cage and the P site of the BP skeleton, while in h-BN, the spin density was confined at the >B–O• site in h-BN-IM1. The difference is attributed to their electronic structures, which dictate the B13C2 and BP as semiconductors, while h-BN as an insulator (Figure S4). This suggests that the conducting bands of the former two are more accessible for unpaired electrons than that of the latter, resulting in more dispersed spin density distribution in B13C2 and BP than in h-BN. The more delocalized nature of the spin density in B13C2 and BP stabilizes the >B–O radical intermediate more than that of h-BN-IM1, thus with lower reactivity to dehydrogenate propane. This explains the previous findings that in the h-BN system, the dehydrogenation of the h-BN surface to produce BNOH is characterized as the rate-determining step, (77) while in the BP (37) and B13C2 (see later part of this work), the dehydrogenation of the propane is identified as the rate-determining step.
In the case of the h-BC catalyst, the free-energy barriers to the dehydrogenation of >B–OH by O2(T0) are 40.5 kcal/mol for zigzag-B_OH, 43.8 kcal/mol for armchair_OH, and 45.7 kcal/mol for zigzag-C_OH (Table 2), indicating that it is easier to generate active >B–O• species at the zigzag-B site than at the other two types of sizes (zigzag-C site and armchair edge).
3.3. ODHP Mechanism Catalyzed by Boron Carbide
Two reaction pathways of the ODHP catalyzed by boron carbide are schematically shown in Figure 5 using B13C2-H as a representative. The two pathways, denoted as pathway a and pathway b, differ from each other in their first/second step of dehydrogenation of propane to break the primary C–H bond (C-1o–H, pathway a) or the secondary C–H bond (C-2o–H, pathway b) at the >BO• sites of boron carbide catalysts. During this step, one 1o-H or 2o-H (numbering in Figure 3) atom of propane is abstracted by the >B1–O1• group of boron carbide via a transition state B13C2-H-TS2a (pathway a)/B13C2-H-TS2b (pathway b), which is featured by a partially cleaved H···C bond and a partially formed BO···H bond (B–O···H···C). This step generates n-C3H7 (B13C2-H-IM2a) and i-C3H7 (B13C2-H-IM2b) species. Subsequently, under the assistance of gaseous oxygenated radical (•OH and •OOH), the •C3H7 species then undergo dehydrogenation to form C3H6. (34)
Figure 5
Figure 5. Schematic elucidation of the stepwise dehydrogenation reaction at the >B–O• site of the B13C2-H model.
Both the B13C2-L/B13C2-H (Table 3) and B4C-L/B4C-H (Table 4) models have been considered for 1o-H and 2o-H-abstractions at the surface >BO• sites (Tables 3 and 4). On the sparsely hydroxylated surface, in the transition state of the dehydrogenation of propane (TS2a for the primary H and TS2b for the secondary H), the C-1o–H and C-2o–H bonds of propane are lengthened from 1.09 to 1.31 Å (B13C2-L-TS2a) and 1.28 Å (B13C2-L-TS2b), respectively, and 1.25 Å (B4C-L-TS2a) and 1.25 Å (B4C-L-TS2b), respectively. The reaction free-energy barrier to the abstraction of the primary H catalyzed by B13C2-L and B4C-L is calculated to be slightly higher (15.2 and 23.3 kcal/mol for B13C2-L-TS2a and B4C-L-TS2a, respectively) than that of the secondary H (14.8 and 21.5 kcal/mol for B13C2-L-TS2b and B4C-L-TS2b, respectively), which is consistent with their bond energy difference.

Table 4. Key Stationary Points and Relative Free Energies (ΔG≠ and ΔG, in kcal/mol) in the Dehydrogenation of the Propane by the Active >B–O• Species of B4C-L/B4C-H
A similar phenomenon was observed in the reactions on the highly hydroxylated surfaces. The C-2o–H bonds of propane are lengthened to 1.25 Å in B13C2-H-TS2b and 1.24 Å in B4C-H-TS2b, which is shorter than that of the C-1o–H bonds in B13C2-H-TS2b (1.30 Å) and B4C-H-TS2b (1.29 Å). This shows that the dehydrogenation at the secondary C site on both B13C2-H and B4C-H passes an earlier transition state than at the primary C site. The free-energy barrier to the former case is 0.4 and 1.0 kcal/mol lower than that to the latter, which is consistent with the Hammond postulate. (78) In view of the lower free energy of B13C2-H-TS2b (8.2 kcal/mol, entry 11 in Table 4) than that of B4C-H-TS2b (15.0 kcal/mol, entry 15 in Table 5), B13C2-H exhibits a higher reactivity toward the activation of propane than B4C-H kinetically by 6.8 kcal/mol. Meanwhile, thermodynamically, the former is also more favorable than the latter by 6.1 kcal/mol.
Table 5. Key Stationary Points and Relative Free Energies (ΔG≠ and ΔG, kcal/mol) in the Dehydrogenation of the Propane by >B–O• Species of Zigzag-B_OH, Armchair_OH, and Zigzag-C_OH
We also calculated the free-energy barriers to the dehydrogenation of C3H8 by the •OH or •OOH radicals (data collected in the Supporting Information, Table S2). The values for the dehydrogenation of 2o/1o-H by the •OH radical are 9.2 (TS2OH) and 10.5 (TS1OH) kcal/mol, which are lower than the corresponding •OOH-assisted 2o/1o-H activated process by 17.4 and 19.5 kcal/mol. These data show the stronger reactivity of •OH and surface >B–O• radical sites than the •OOH radical. The peroxyl radical behaves as a mild oxidant in the ODH system, which agrees with the recent work that reports that surface boron peroxo species can also work as mild oxidants to guarantee the higher selectivity for the dehydrogenation of 2o-H than that of 1o-H of propane. (38)
The data of the h-BC-catalyzed propane dehydrogenation at the zigzag-B_OH, armchair_OH, and zigzag-C_OH sites are collected in Table 5. The free-energy barrier to the 2o-H dehydrogenated process of ODHP at the zigzag-B_OH/armchair_OH/zigzag-C_OH active site is 19.4, 22.0, and 27.2 kcal/mol, respectively, suggesting that the dehydrogenation activity decreases in the order of zigzag-B_OH > armchair_OH > zigzag-C_OH. We note that these sites are less active than the >B–O• site in the B4C-H and B13C2-H models, and the barrier of the propane dehydrogenation at the zigzag-B_O• site of h-BC is higher than that at the >B–O• site of B4C-H and B13C2-H by 4.4 and 11.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data indicate that a higher boron content and surface oxidation could enhance the catalytic reactivity of boron carbides in the ODH of propane.
The nascent •C3H7 can be converted into olefin products via another H-abstraction step either in the gas phase (Table S3, entries 1 and 2) or on the B13C2-H and B4C-H surfaces (Table S3, entries 3 and 4). For the 1o-H-transfer assisted by gaseous •OH and •OOH radicals, the free-energy barriers are calculated to be 5.6 kcal/mol (TSOH) and 14.6 kcal/mol (TSOOH), respectively. The dehydrogenation of •C3H7 through the surface channels is calculated to be barrierless. This suggests that both channels feasible under ODH conditions and their contributions are determined by the diffusion of the propyl radicals and appropriate collisions.
3.4. Regulation Effect of Boron Content and Hydroxyl Coverage on Surface
The free-energy profiles are plotted in Figure 6 for the optimal pathways of the ODHP reaction catalyzed by the three studied boron carbides, including B13C2-H (B13C2, in green), B4C-H (B4C, in red), and the zigzag-B_OH (h-BC). The whole reaction envelopes the activation of dioxygen at the boron carbide surface sites and the subsequent two sequential dehydrogenation steps of the propane.
Figure 6
Figure 6. Free-energy profile of the optimum ODHP reaction pathways on B13C2-H (in green) and B4C-H (in blue) and zigzag-B_OH of BC (in red) models.
The computed apparent free-energy barriers to the ODHP reaction catalyzed by these three boron carbide catalyst models are 54.0, 61.3, and 74.4 kcal/mol for B13C2-H, B4C-H, and h-BC, respectively (Figure 6). This shows that the B13C2-H-catalyzed ODHP reaction is kinetically more favorable than that catalyzed by B4C-H and h-BC.
3.5. NCI Analysis
The noncovalent interaction (NCI) analysis is performed to identify the interactions responsible for the stabilization of the transition states catalyzed by B13C2-H and B4C-H (Figure 7). The total number and strength of noncovalent interactions in transition states catalyzed by B13C2 and B4C with a low coverage of hydroxyl groups on the surface are less than those with a high coverage of hydroxyl groups on the surface. In the B13C2-H-TS1, B4C-H-TS1, B13C2-H-TS2b, and B4C-H-TS2b besides the interactions between the migrating H and the surface O–B< site (C–H···O–B<), additional hydrogen bond interactions are formed between the O–B< site and its neighboring >B–OH on the surface (>B–O–H···O–B<). In the transition states, the >B–OH groups on the surface with a higher hydroxyl coverage are more involved in the hydrogen-bonding interactions (blue regions, O–H···O and C–H···O) than those on the surface with lower hydroxyl coverage. Previous findings have shown that more and stronger intermolecular interactions could render the transition-state structures more stable. (79) Therefore, the B13C2-H-TS1/TS2b and B4C-H-TS1/TS2b is more stabilized than B13C2-L-TS1/TS2b and B4C-L-TS1/TS2b through the contribution of O–H···O and C–H···O hydrogen-bonding interactions.

3.6. Frontier Molecular Orbital (FMO) Analysis
The frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) were analyzed to identify the orbital interactions for B13C2-H, B4C-H, and h-BC. The HOMO–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) gap is defined as the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and can be used to differentiate the chemical reactivity of molecules (Figure 8). A molecule with a narrow frontier orbital gap is more polarizable with low kinetic stability and high chemical reactivity. (80) As seen in Figure 8, the FMO analysis shows that boron carbide with a higher B percentage has a significantly narrower HOMO–LUMO gap (1.90 eV for B13C2-H, 2.58 eV for B4C-H, and 2.97 eV for h-BC). This is consistent with the higher reactivity of B13C2-H than that of B4C-H and h-BC and demonstrates the influence of the B content, which varied from 87.7 at % B in B13C2, 80.0 at % B in B4C, and 50.0 at % B in h-BC, on the composition of HOMO, which modulates their electronic properties.

3.7. Condensed Fukui Functional Analysis
In previous studies, the condensed Fukui function has been calculated for the metal-free B2O3, h-BN, and BP to explore the influence of their second element (O, N, and P) on their catalytic performance in the ODHP reaction. In these materials, the second element is part of the scaffold to pin boron atoms and can also assist in the formation of oxygenated sites to activate the reaction. In boron carbide, the second element is C, and here we calculated the condensed Fukui functions for B13C2-H to evaluate its influence on the nucleo- and electrophilicities of surface B and hydroxyl sites of B13C2-H. For comparison, the condensed Fukui functions of B2O3, h-BN, and BP were also calculated, and the data are shown in Figure 9, which were obtained using the atomic Hirshfeld charges. (81−83)

Condensed Fukui functions f–, f+, and f0, relative electrophilicity index (S+/S–), and relative nucleophilicity index (S–/S+) of (a) BC1, BP, BN, and BO sites of B13C2-H, BP, h-BN, and B2O3 and (b) HC1, HP, HN, and HO sites of B13C2-H, BP, h-BN, and B2O3. (c) The structure of B13C2, BP, h-BN, and B2O3.
In the previous study, the ability of B to donate electrons for bonding and to accept external electrons in its empty 2pz orbital was reported to determine the nucleophilicity of surface boron active sites. (34) The calculations in the present study show that, in the boron carbide catalysts, the nucleophilicity of the catalysts is slightly stronger than their electrophilicity (higher S–/S+ than S+/S–) and, as seen in Figure 9, the values of nucleophilicity index (S–/S+) of these >B–OH sites decrease in the order of HO(B2O3) > HP(BP) > HC(B13C2) > HN(h-BN), showing that the compositions of the catalysts can regulate the electronic properties of the surface boron hydroxyl sites. This is in accord with the difficulty to dehydrogenate the >B–OH group on these catalysts. We note that, for the reactions catalyzed by B13C2 and BP, the rate-determining step is the dehydrogenation of propane, which is different from that catalyzed by h-BN; thus, the higher propensity of B13C2 and BP to react with dioxygen does not necessarily guarantee their higher reactivity in the ODHP.
4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
A mechanistic study of the ODHP reaction catalyzed by three types of boron carbides (B13C2, B4C, and h-BC) by density functional theory is reported to address the relationship between their B/C ratio and their catalytic reactivity. The influence of hydroxyl coverage on the surfaces of B13C2 and B4C is also discussed. Concerning the porous structure of B13C2 and B4C rich with broad channels and the layered structure of h-BC with wide spanning, this study is expected to enrich our understanding of the essence of ODHP catalyzed by boron carbides and provide insights into the role of C element as the second element of the catalyst.
The whole ODHP reaction encompasses three stages: triggering of the reaction through dioxygen activation and surface dehydrogenation and the two sequential propane dehydrogenation steps to generate propene product. The results show that free-energy barriers to the dehydrogenation of >B–OH by O2(T0) are lower on B13C2-H/B4C-H than that on B13C2-L/B4C-L. On h-BC, the zigzag-BOH shows higher reactivity to dehydrogenate its >B–OH groups than the other two types of edge sites (armchair_OH and zigzag-C_OH). The reaction free-energy barrier for the transition states of subsequent dehydrogenation at the primary H site is slightly higher than that at the secondary H site. The free-energy profiles for the optimum pathways of the ODHP reaction show that the B13C2-H-catalyzed reaction process is kinetically more favorable than B4C-H and BC, which shows a correlation with the ratio of B in boron carbide.
The TDOS for the sparsely (B13C2-L/B4C-L) and densely (B13C2-H/B4C-H) hydroxylated surfaces and the PDOS of the O and H atoms of the hydroxyl groups of the transition states (TS1) indicate that in the highly hydroxylated models (B13C2-H and B4C-H), O atoms contributed more to the TDOS than H atoms in the energy range of −16 to −4 eV, which is opposite in the sparsely hydroxylated models (B13C2-L/B4C-L) that the PDOS of H atoms is more significant than that of O atoms in the frontier region (energy range of −12 to −6 eV). Moreover, the higher coverage of hydroxyl groups could increase the HOMO energy level compared with those in sparsely hydroxylated models. NCI and condensed Fukui functional analysis confirmed that the composition and the boron content can regulate the electronic structure of boron carbides and affect their catalytic ability in ODHP.
In conclusion, this work shows that boron carbide material with higher B content and higher coverage of the hydroxyl group on the surface exhibits better catalytic activity for the ODHP reaction. This enriches our understanding and benefits the rational design of novel B-containing catalytic materials with improved activity in the alkane ODH reactions.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
