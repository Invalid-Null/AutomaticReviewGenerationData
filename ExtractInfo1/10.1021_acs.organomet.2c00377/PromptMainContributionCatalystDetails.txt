Preparation of Tripodal Vanadium Oxo-Organometallic Species Supported on Silica, [(≡SiO)3V(═O)], for Selective Nonoxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane
Abstract
In this work, a strategy based on the grafting of a vanadium molecular complex, [V(═O)(OtBu)3], (1), bearing tert-butoxide ligands, on a partially dehydroxylated silica, followed by a thermal treatment has been used for the preparation of supported tripodal V oxo complex, [(≡SiO)3V(═O)], active species, for important chemical processes. The molecular complex reacts with a silica partially dehydroxylated at 200 °C (SiO2–200) to lead to bipodal [(≡SiO)2V(═O)(OtBu)] (2) as major surface species, while monopodal surface species [(≡SiO)V(═O)(OtBu)2] (3) are obtained on SiO2–700. These materials were thermally treated to form active supported tripodal vanadium oxo species by releasing isobutene via a β-H transfer, leading to V–OH intermediate. The latter species lead to the targeted tripodal oxo species [(≡SiO)3V(═O)] after restructuration of the support and will be represented as materials (2a) and (3a). All of the supported vanadium complexes were characterized by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT), UV–vis, solid-state NMR, and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopies. In particular, the structure of isolated vanadium oxo tripodal species, [(≡SiO)3V(═O)], was confirmed by 51V NMR with a major peak at −670 ppm, as reported in the literature. The catalytic property of (2a) and (3a) was evaluated for the direct propane dehydrogenation and showed promising performances that can be solely assigned to the isolated vanadium tripodal species.

ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propylene is an important intermediate in the chemical industry and is used for the synthesis of several key products such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, and propylene oxide. (1,2) It is mainly produced by steam cracking (SC) and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of hydrocarbon feedstocks. (1,3) With the increasing demand for propylene globally, SC and FCC will be unable to satisfy the market need. Hence, alternative routes such as on-purpose technologies have been developed, like olefin metathesis, (4−6) methanol to olefin process, (7) and, more recently, the direct CO2 conversion to light olefins (8,9) as well as catalytic propane dehydrogenation. (1,10) The latter uses catalysts that can operate under oxidative or nonoxidative conditions. The main issue of the oxidative dehydrogenation is the low selectivity to olefins as CO2 can easily be produced from a total oxidation of light hydrocarbons. Nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is widely used at the industrial scale as it offers many advantages, such as a high selectivity toward the desired alkene (propylene) and the production of valuable dihydrogen. This reaction is highly endothermic (ΔH° = 124 kJ·mol–1) and requires high operating temperatures (above 550 °C), resulting in undesired side reactions (cracking) and deactivation of the catalyst due to the formation of coke and degradation/restructuration of the active phase. Two PDH processes dominate the market, known as Oleflex and Catofin. The first one employs supported hetero-bimetallic particles based on a noble metal Pt, alloyed with toxic Sn as a promoter, to enhance the selectivity to propylene and to avoid cracking reactions and the fast deactivation of the catalyst at high temperature. However, despite the presence of promoters, high operating temperatures still lead to deactivation as a function of time on stream, which requires frequent regeneration treatments to maintain the catalytic performances. The Catofin technology employs a cheap catalyst based on chromium oxides (typically 18–20 wt % Cr) supported on alumina with working temperatures ranging from 575 to 625 °C at reduced pressures (0.2–0.5 bar). The high temperature required to improve the catalytic activity toward the desired product leads inevitably to the formation of coke. Consequently, the regeneration cycles occurring every 15–30 min decrease the activity, and therefore, a replacement of the catalyst every 2 years is needed. In addition to coke formation, the process conditions lead to aging of the catalyst. This causes (i) a decrease of the dispersion of chromium species on the surface; (ii) an incorporation of the Cr active species within alumina, resulting in an increase of the catalyst’s acidity that reduces propylene selectivity; and (iii) an increase of the surface Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio after each regeneration cycle by calcination. (11)
To overcome these challenges, other metal oxides such as VOx, GaOx, InOx, or MoOx have been widely explored in the literature for PDH. (1) Supported vanadium oxide catalysts have been intensively studied for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and showed promising results, while a few examples were reported in the case of the nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation. Vanadium(V) oxide supported on silica, alumina, or titanium oxide shows promising activities for the catalytic dehydrogenation of light alkane. (12−17) The conventional synthesis methods of these catalysts described in the literature involve various processes such as aqueous impregnation, sol–gel, chemical vapor deposition, to name a few. (1) However, depending on the nature of the vanadium precursor and the support used, these synthesis methods of supported vanadium oxo complexes lead to a distribution of monomeric, dimeric, and oligomeric VOx species on the surface or even to particles of oxide. (18,19) Several studies in this area have been reported and suggest that the structure of the supported precursor of the active species, for example, onto silica, is postulated as an isolated vanadium center bearing an oxo and three siloxy ligands. In the case of vanadium systems, it is reasonable to propose that the active species is V3+ trisiloxy (Scheme 1) obtained during the initiation step after an activation of propane on V5+ oxo tripodal species, (20) similar to chromium and gallium catalytic systems.
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Proposed Tripodal V(III) Active Species for PDH
Based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and Operando studies, the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the case of metal oxides has been proposed to occur via a heterolytic C–H bond cleavage via activation on a surface M–O– bond, leading to a coordinated alkyl, M–R, and a surface hydroxyl, −OH, or via a σ-bond metathesis on an M–H intermediate. (1,21) The low concentration of active sites hampers their characterization, and thus limited information is available on their role in catalysis and the understanding of the elementary steps. In fact, many attempts to characterize the surface-active sites of supported VOx species, prepared by conventional methods, using spectroscopic techniques for bulk systems such as XAFS and 51V MAS NMR led to inconsistent results. (22−29) An obvious strategy to access the real model of the active species and to increase the activity in PDH is to control the number of active sites and to eliminate presumably inactive oligomeric VOx sites. Regarding the preparation of well-defined functional materials at a molecular scale, especially single-site catalysts for PDH, surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) has proven to be a powerful approach. This methodology involves a controlled grafting of a reactive organometallic precursor on a pretreated support. With a judicious choice of the precursor in combination with the pretreatment of the support, supported species with a desired podality, oxidation state, and coordination environment around the metal center can be designed. (30) This approach has resulted in highly active catalysts associated with the propylene chemistry, mainly through olefin metathesis, (4−6,31−38) as well as for PDH. (39−45) Therefore, we intend to apply surface organometallic chemistry for the synthesis of a silica material containing supported trisiloxy vanadium oxo species as precatalyst for propane dehydrogenation reaction. We recently developed a new synthetic method for the preparation of supported active sites, using a molecular complex of group VI bearing tert-butoxide ligands [M(═O)(OtBu)4] (M = Mo or W). After a grafting reaction of these complexes onto silica followed by a thermolysis, [(≡SiO)2M(═O)2] species were obtained and showed high activities for the metathetic oxidation or the metathesis of olefins. (46,47) In the case of vanadium, we expect that this strategy would result in the formation of a well-defined tripodal vanadium oxo species after the grafting of [V(═O)(OtBu)3], (1), onto silica supports (dehydroxylated at 200 and 700 °C). A thermal treatment at high temperature of the resulting surface species, bearing one or two tert-butoxide ligands, leads to the targeted active species by a β-H elimination of isobutene from V-OtBu, resulting in a hydroxy ligand σ-coordinated to vanadium, V–OH. This reaction can be followed by a ring opening of a neighboring siloxane (≡Si–O–Si≡), which forms a new V–OSi≡ bond and a surface hydroxyl group, ≡Si–OH. These well-defined surface species have been further characterized by elemental analysis and different spectroscopic techniques such as diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT), solid-state NMR of different nuclei (1H, 13C, 51V), UV–vis, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and studied as catalysts for the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane in a continuous flow reactor.

General Procedure
All experiments were carried out using standard air-free methodology within an argon-filled glovebox on a Schlenk line or in a Schlenk-type apparatus interfaced to a high-vacuum line (10–5 mbar). Solvents were purified and dried according to standard procedures. [V(═O)(OtBu)3] was synthesized in one step followed by purification. Elemental analyses were performed at Mikroanalytisches Labor Pascher. Diffuse reflectance infrared spectra were collected with a Nicolet 6700 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometer in a 4 cm–1 resolution with a SMART module. An airtight IR cell equipped with CaF2 windows was employed, and the final spectra comprise 64 scans. Diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra in the range of 200–850 nm were recorded on a Perkin Elmer λ1050 UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer adapted with the Praying Mantis optical unit provided by Harrick. The samples were diluted in dry BaSO4, and the spectra were recorded against a BaSO4 baseline. An airtight cell equipped with quartz windows was used.
Solution NMR spectra were recorded on an Avance-300 Bruker spectrometer. All chemical shifts were measured relative to residual 1H or 13C resonance of the deuterated C6D6 solvent: δ 7.15 ppm for 1H and 128 ppm for 13C. Solid-state NMR spectra were acquired with a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer (1H: 500.1 MHz, 13C: 125.7 MHz). For 1H experiments, the spinning frequency was 10 kHz, the recycle delay was 5 s, and 8 scans were collected using a 90° pulse excitation of 3 μs. The 13C CP MAS spectra were obtained at a spinning frequency of 10 kHz, with a recycle delay of 5 s and 12288 scans were collected. Chemical shifts were given in ppm with respect to tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the external reference for 1H and 13C NMR. The 51V MAS NMR spectrum was acquired on a Bruker DSX 300 spectrometer (51V: 78.9 MHz) using a single pulse excitation. The signal was optimized with crystalline V2O5 (δ = −609 ppm) as the external standard with a pulse angle of π/2. Two spinning rates were used to determine the isotropic chemical shift (10 and 12 kHz).
X-ray absorption spectra were acquired at ESRF on BM23 beamline at room temperature at the vanadium K-edge. A double Si(111) crystal was used as a monochromator, and a system based on a total reflection through a double X-ray mirror with an incidence angle variable from 2 to 5 mrad allowed harmonic rejection to a level better than 10–5. (48) The spectra were recorded in the transmission mode between 5.3 and 6.44 keV at room temperature (295 K). Each data set was collected simultaneously with a V metal foil reference and was later aligned according to that reference (first maximum of the derivative of the V foil spectrum set at 5465.1 eV). The molecular complexes and vanadyl sulfate were homogeneously mixed with dry BN, and the supported V samples were packaged as pellets within an argon-filled glovebox in a double airtight sample holder equipped with kapton windows. The data analyses were performed by standard procedures using, in particular, the program “Athena”. (49)
Preparation of the Complex
The vanadium precursor [V(═O)(OtBu)3], (1), was synthesized by the reaction of V2O5 (Sigma-Aldrich) with tBuOH in benzene. The entire preparation procedure was carried out in an inert atmosphere using a Schlenk line. Twenty grams of V2O5 was first placed in a 1 L round-bottom flask and connected to a Dean–Stark trap to capture the water from the reaction coming through the reflux condenser. After adding 300 mL of dry benzene, 165 ml of dry tBuOH was added to the benzene suspension of V2O5. The temperature was increased to 100 °C and maintained for 48 h. The solution was filtered away from unreacted V2O5. After removing the solvent by distillation, white crystals were observed. This product was further dried overnight under reduced pressure. To purify the freshly formed product, [V(═O)(OtBu)3], a sublimation was conducted under vacuum at 40 °C. 1H NMR (C6D6): δ = 1.43 ppm (CH3); 13C{H} NMR (C6D6) δ = 31.4 ppm (CH3) and 86 ppm (C-CH3).
Preparation and Characterization of (2), (2a), (3), and (3a) Materials
A mixture of [V(═O)(OtBu)3] (in excess with respect to the total amount of Si–OH groups, 0.6 g in this case) and SiO2-(200) (2 g) in pentane (10 mL) was stirred at 25 °C for 4 h. After filtration, the solid was washed 4 times with pentane and the liquid was transferred to another reactor to quantify the tBuOH evolved during the grafting reaction by gas chromatography (GC) and using an internal standard. The resulting material, (2), is a white powder that was dried under vacuum (10–5 mbar). Elemental analysis: V 1.6 wt % C 1.5 wt %. The catalyst was characterized by DRIFT, solid-state NMR, UV–vis, and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES).
The same procedure was employed with SiO2–700 to yield (3), which was also characterized as (2). Elemental analysis: V 1.12 wt %, C 2.23 wt %.
Both materials (2) and (3) were heated to form tripodal V species leading to the synthesis of (2a) and (3a) materials, respectively. These species were characterized by DRIFT, solid-state NMR, UV–vis, and XANES, and their catalytic performances were evaluated for propane dehydrogenation.
Catalyst Evaluation
Catalytic propane conversion was carried out in a stainless steel continuous flow reactor (Ptotal = 1 bar, T = 540 °C, total flow rate = 5 mL·min–1: 20% propane in argon; mass of the catalyst = 500 mg diluted in 2.0 g of SiC). The gases were purified with a column of molecular sieves and activated Cu2O/Al2O3 and controlled by Brooks mass flow controllers. The catalyst was charged in the glovebox. A 4-way valve allowed the isolation of the charged catalyst in the reactor from the environment and extensive purging of the tubes before the reaction. The products were determined by an online HP 6890 GC equipped with a 50 m KCl/Al2O3 column and an flame ionization detector (FID).

Preparation and Characterization of [V(═O)(OtBu)3], (1)
The precursor, [V(═O)(OtBu)3], was easily synthesized using commercially available compounds V2O5 and tBuOH in benzene at 100 °C for 48 h. After purification, this complex was identified by intense 1H NMR signal at 1.43 ppm, attributed to the proton of methyl fragments and 13C NMR signals at 31.4 ppm, corresponding to carbons of methyl groups, CH3, and at 86 ppm attributed to the quaternary C of the tert-butyl ligand (Figure S1). In addition, 51V NMR showed a signal at −642 ppm, corresponding to a tetrahedral vanadium-supported complex, bearing an oxo and three alkoxy ligands (Figure S2). (42)
Reactivity of [V(═O)(OtBu)3], (1), with a Silica Dehydroxylated at 200 °C, Synthesis of Material (2)
Amorphous silica, Aerosil 200, from Degussa was partially dehydroxylated at 200 °C under high vacuum (10–5 mbar) to afford SiO2–200 with a density of silanols ca. 2.5 OH per nm2 (0.86 mmol OH·g–1). (40) The grafting of [V(═O)(OtBu)3] on SiO2–200 was carried out by an anhydrous impregnation in pentane at 25 °C. Then, the powder was washed four times with dry pentane to remove the excess of complex affording V(═O)(OtBu)3/SiO2–200(2) as a colorless material. The reaction of [V(═O)(OtBu)3] proceeds with the consumption of almost all of the free (or “isolated”) silanols of SiO2–200, as shown by the irreversible disappearance of the νO-H stretching band at 3747 cm–1 (Figure 1, left). Importantly, the intensity of the other large νO–H band centered at 3600 cm–1, attributed to vicinal silanols, did not decrease after reaction with the complex due to the low reactivity of these vicinal silanols. This phenomenon was already observed for the reaction of SiO2–200, with several complexes of metal of groups IV, V, and VI. (50) Concomitantly, two groups of bands appear in the 3000–2700 cm–1 and 1500–1300 cm–1 regions, assigned, respectively, to ν(CH) and δ(CH) vibrations of the methyl groups of the perhydrocarbyl ligands.

The amounts of vanadium and carbon, as quantified by the elemental analysis of V(═O)(OtBu)3/SiO2–200 material, (2), are 1.6 wt % V and 1.5 wt % C, respectively, which accounts for an atomic ratio of ca. 4.0 C/V. The vanadium loading of the material is thus 0.315 mmol·g–1, and since the concentration of silanols is ca. 0.86 mmol OH/g on SiO2–200, (40) this gives a V/OH ratio of 0.365. The quantification of the tBuOH evolved during the grafting reaction was carried out by GC analysis, using octane as an internal standard. It leads to a release of 1.8 tBuOH/V. Thus, the results of these characterizations are in line with the formation of a major bipodal species bearing one tert-butoxide ligand, [(≡SiO)2V(═O)(OtBu)].
Further spectroscopic characterizations provided additional information on the grafting of [V(═O)(OtBu)3] on SiO2–200. 1H MAS NMR shows one signal at 1.4 ppm assigned to CH3 protons (Figure S3) and one signal in 13C CP MAS NMR at 28 ppm attributed to the carbon of the methyl groups (Figure 2). The lack of a significant signal for the quaternary carbon of the tert-butoxide ligand is most probably due to the larger chemical shift anisotropy, owing to a lower mobility of the surface species compared to the case of SiO2–700 support (material (3)), as previously observed. (51,52) No improvement for the 13C signal of the quaternary carbon was shown under the 13C{1H} MAS mode.

51V NMR is a powerful technique that brings additional information on the coordination sphere and geometry of the vanadium centers in supported catalysts. (53,54) The 51V MAS NMR of (2) reveals a signal with an isotropic chemical shift of −693 ppm (Figure 3, top), which represents an upfield shift of 51 ppm in comparison to [V(═O)(OtBu)3] molecular complex, (1), which shows a signal at −642 ppm (Figure S2). This result is consistent with the formation of a bipodal surface species on SiO2-200. In fact, the upfield shift was also reported in the literature for a [V(═O)(OiPr)3] complex with a 51V NMR signal at −630 ppm, which shifts to −650 ppm when two OiPr ligands of this complex are exchanged by two siloxy groups from the silica surface, leading to [(≡SiO)2V(═O)(OiPr)]-supported species. (55)

The UV–vis spectrum of (2) comprises absorption bands starting from 200 to 400 nm (Figure 4). The absence in the spectrum of any absorption in the d → d transition part suggests that the supported vanadium is in its highest oxidation state. (56) The broad peak in the UV region (λmax = 267 nm) can be assigned to a ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) originated from the tert-butoxide ligands. The energy edge (Eg) derived from the O → V charge-transfer peak (determined from the intercept of the [F(R∞)hν]2 vs hν plot in the low energy rise) reflects the degree of vanadia polymerization. (57) This value is extrapolated to be 3.58 eV for (2), suggesting that the vanadium sites are present as monomer on the surface. (58)

XANES Analysis of the Molecular Complex on SiO2–200
Additional information on the vanadium coordination geometry, its structural environment, and oxidation state in the case of the molecular complex, (1), and materials (2) and (3) was given by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Normalized V K-edge XANES spectra of the molecular complex, [V(═O)(OtBu)3], of the presumed [(≡SiO)2V(═O)(OtBu)] complex in material (2), obtained from the grafting of [V(═O)(OtBu)3] onto SiO2–200 are shown in Figure 5. In the two spectra (a and b), there is a prominent pre-edge peak. This pre-edge feature arises from electronic transitions from 1s core levels to the empty 3d levels, more or less 4p hybridized by the ligands of vanadium. These electronic transitions become electric-dipolar allowed in the absence of an inversion center. In this case, the loss of symmetry allows partial overlapping and mixing of the unfilled d states of the metal with its 4p orbitals. Several studies of the V K-edge XANES features have considered the pre-edge intensity as well as its absolute position to determine both the vanadium oxidation state and its symmetry. (59−61) The position of the pre-edge peak on its own is generally insufficient to accurately evaluate the vanadium oxidation state.

The position and intensity of the main pre-edge peak along with the position of the edge of different vanadium compounds studied are reported in Table 1. For the molecular complex (1) and material (2) referenced above, the position of the pre-edge peak at ca. 5470.4 eV and its high intensity (0.79–0.85) are consistent with those observed in other complexes or materials containing V(V) in a tetrahedral symmetry. (60) Moreover, the position of the K-edge of the three samples, shifted by 16 to more than 18 eV to higher energy relative to the metal foil, is within the range of K-edge energies reported for known V(V) compounds.

Reactivity of [V(═O)(OtBu)3] with a Silica Dehydroxylated at 700 °C, Material (3) Synthesis
The same amorphous silica support was partially dehydroxylated at 700 °C (SiO2–700) under high vacuum (10–5 mbar) to compare the structure of the supported species on the resulting material, (3), to those obtained on material (2), after the grafting of [V(═O)(OtBu)3] on SiO2–200. SiO2–700 presents a density of ca. 0.70 OH per nm2 corresponding to 0.27 mmol OH·g–1. (39) The impregnation of [V(═O)(OtBu)3] on SiO2–700 in a pentane solution occurred at room temperature for 4 h. After an intensive washing with pentane to remove the excess of the complex and a drying under high vacuum, a white powder was obtained (3). The infrared spectroscopy of V(═O)(OtBu)3/SiO2–700(3) revealed the consumption of all of the isolated silanols initially present on SiO2-700, shown by the disappearance of the νO–H band at 3747 cm–1 (Figure 1, right). Simultaneously, alkyl bands in the range of 3000–2800 cm–1 (νC–H) and 1500–1300 cm–1 (δCH2 and δCH3) appeared, confirming the grafting of the vanadium complex on the silica surface. Elemental analysis of material (3) indicates V and C wt % contents of 1.12 and 2.23 wt %, respectively, corresponding to an atomic ratio of 7.9 C/V. The V/OH ratio is ca. 0.815 since 0.220 mmol of V/g of silica is grafted on the surface. GC analysis of tBuOH released during the grafting revealed a release of 0.88 tBuOH/V after the reaction. The comparison of the mass balance analyses obtained after the grafting of [V(═O)(OtBu)3] on SiO2–200 and SiO2–700 is resumed in Table 2. It is obvious from these results that the structure of the resulting species in materials (2) and (3) depends on the dehydroxylation temperature of the support. Thus, the characterization results suggest the formation of a major monopodal species, [(≡SiO)V(═O)(OtBu)2], for (3), from SiO2–700, and a bipodal species, [(≡SiO)2V(═O)(OtBu)], for (2), from SiO2–200.

The characterization of material (3) by 1H MAS NMR shows a similar result to that observed for material (2). The spectrum also consists of a main signal at 1.4 ppm corresponding to CH3 protons of tert-butoxide ligands (Figure S3). The 13C CP MAS spectrum of V(═O)(OtBu)3/SiO2–700, (3), shows two signals at 86 ppm and 28 ppm, assigned to the quaternary carbon and CH3 terminal groups, respectively (Figure 2, right). It is important to note that the signal attributed for the quaternary carbon at 86 ppm is visible compared to (2). This is due to the presence of either two tert-butoxide ligands on the surface (higher concentration), compared to the main surface complex of (2), or to a higher mobility of the surface species in (3), leading to a narrower chemical anisotropy. A signal centered at −687 ppm appears in the 51V MAS NMR spectrum, attributed to the monopodal complex [(≡SiO)V(═O)(OtBu)2] (Figure 3, down). This chemical shift corresponds to an upfield shift of −45 ppm compared to the precursor [V(═O)(OtBu)3] (−642 ppm). Nevertheless, the observed chemical shift is rather similar to the bipodal [(≡SiO)2V(═O)(OtBu)] (−693 ppm). (42,55) Taking into consideration the peak broadening (full width at half maximum (FWHM) ≈ 35 ppm), the podality of supported [V(═O)(OtBu)3] is indistinguishable by 51V MAS NMR spectroscopy. The UV–vis spectrum of [(≡SiO)V(═O)(OtBu)2] consists of an absorption band between 200 and 400 nm with a λmax = 262 nm, corresponding to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT O2–→ V5+) (Figure 4). Similarly to the bipodal species, no absorption band at 650 nm was observed; hence, the vanadium adsorbed on the surface has the highest oxidation state (+V). (56) The energy edge (Eg) is 3.6 eV (compared to 3.58 eV in the case of V(═O)(OtBu)3/SiO2–200), which is in line with the formation of monomer vanadium sites on the surface. (58)
XANES Analysis of the Molecular Complex on SiO2–700
The normalized V K-edge XANES spectra of the molecular complex, [V(═O)(OtBu)3], of [(≡SiO)V(═O)(OtBu)2] complex, obtained from the grafting of [V(═O)(OtBu)3] onto SiO2–700 are shown in Figure 6. The position and intensity of the main pre-edge peak along with the position of the edge of these vanadium compounds are also reported in Table 1. For V(═O)(OtBu)3/SiO2–700-supported species, the position of the pre-edge peak (5470.3 eV), its relative intensity (0.85), and the position of the edge (5483.2 eV) are also indicative of V(V) tetrahedral species.

In conclusion, well-defined single-site catalysts with low loading of vanadium were obtained by grafting [V(═O)(OtBu)3] onto SiO2–200 and SiO2–700. A bipodal as major species was formed on the SiO2–200 surface noted as [(≡SiO)2V(═O)(OtBu)] (2). The grafting of [V(═O)(OtBu)3] on SiO2–700 led to monopodal species represented by [(≡SiO)V(═O)(OtBu)2] (3) (Scheme 2).

Tripodal Species
Controlled thermolyses of [(≡SiO)V(═O)(OtBu)2], (2), from 25 to 300 °C (for 2 h), 400 °C (for 2 h), and 500 °C (for 2 h) were conducted under vacuum in a reactor equipped with a cold trap (liquid N2) to collect the gas phase evolved during the process. The analysis of the gas phase by GC after thermal treatment at 300 °C revealed the formation of 0.88 isobutene/V for (2), and some traces of tBuOH were observed. As reported in the case of silica-supported Mo and W complexes bearing oxo tert-butoxide ligands, (46,47) the formation of isobutene is triggered by the elimination from a methyl group of a H in the β-position of the oxygen coordinated to the metal, M-O-C(Me)2-CH2-H, to form a hydroxy intermediate, M–OH. This step can be assisted by the presence of an oxo ligand in the coordination sphere of vanadium.
The DRIFT analysis of the resulting materials from bipodal [(≡SiO)2V(═O)(OtBu)] species after heating at 300 °C revealed the total disappearance of the alkyl vibrational bands in the range of 3000–2800 and 1500–1300 cm–1, assigned, respectively, to ν(CH) and δ(CH) vibrations from the perhydrocarbyl ligands (Figure 7, left). At 300 °C (after 2 h), we observed the reappearance of the isolated silanol groups at 3747 cm–1 as well as the appearance of a new band at 3660 cm–1 attributed to νVO–H. (62,63) At 400 °C, the intensity of the band characteristic of νSiO–H increases while the one of the νVO–H band decreases. At 500 °C, we observed the absence of the vibration band attributed to the VO–H elongation vibration, accompanied by the decrease in intensity of the ≡SiO–H silanol vibration band. This phenomenon could be explained by a partial condensation of V–OH with the remaining silanols, leading to the formation of water and V–OSi bonds and thus tripodal V oxo surface species (Scheme S1).

Similarly, these phenomena were also observed by 1H MAS NMR of (2) thermally treated from 25 to 500 °C (Figure 8, left). The intense signal at 1.3 ppm attributed to the methyl groups of tert-butoxide ligands decreased and almost disappeared at 300 °C. Simultaneously, a signal at 1.8 ppm corresponding to the isolated silanol groups appears at 300 °C and increases during the thermolysis (up to 500 °C). The release of isobutene during the thermolysis reaction and the appearance of silanol groups along with the disappearance of vanadium hydroxy intermediates suggest that supported surface species in (2) lead to the formation of the targeted tripodal oxo species [(≡SiO)3V(═O)] (2a) upon a thermal treatment under vacuum.

The same procedure including a thermal treatment under vacuum at progressively increasing temperatures has been applied to surface species of (3). This leads to similar observations from DRIFT and 1H MAS NMR data (right parts of Figures 7 and 8, respectively), allowing for the formation of a tripodal vanadium oxo on SiO2–700(3a) with a release of 1.9 isobutene/V. The resulting vanadium surface species (2a) and (3a) were further characterized by XANES, UV–vis, and 51V MAS NMR.
XANES of the Tripodal Species
Both tripodal vanadium systems obtained on silica were characterized by XANES spectroscopy to provide additional details on the vanadium structural environment after thermal treatment of the grafted species. Normalized V K-edge XANES spectra of tripodal systems on SiO2–200(2a) and SiO2–700(3a), in contrast with [V(═O)(OtBu)3] and species (2) and (3), are shown in Figures 5c and 6c. The position and intensity of the main pre-edge peak along with the position of the edge of targeted species [(≡SiO)3V(═O)] are compared to molecular complex [V(═O)(OtBu)3], surface species (2) [(≡SiO)2V(═O)(OtBu)] and (3) [(≡SiO)V(═O)(OtBu)2] (Table 1). Similar to the complex and to the grafted species, the XANES spectra of tripodal oxo species (2a) and (3a) displayed a pre-edge peak located at ca. 5470.4 eV. The relative intensities of these pre-edges are high and range from 0.85 (for grafted species (2) and (3)) to 0.81 for tripodal species (2a) and (3a). These results are consistent with those observed for other complexes or materials containing V(V) in a tetrahedral symmetry. (60) Moreover, the position of the K-edge of the samples, shifted from 16 to more than 18 eV to higher energy relative to the metal foil, is within the range of K-edge energies reported for known V(V) compounds. (59)
Additional characterizations of the surface tripodal oxo species (2a) and (3a) were given by UV–vis spectroscopy (Figure 9). This method allows the detection of isolated V(IV), V(V), and vanadium oligomeric species. The UV–vis spectra of (2a), [(≡SiO)3V(═O)] species, on SiO2–200 exhibited a band at 253 nm along with a shoulder at 286 nm attributed to π(t2) → d(e) and π(t1) → d(e) oxygen-to-tetrahedral V(V) charge-transfer transitions, involving oxygen in bridging (V–O–Si) and terminal (V═O) positions, respectively, in agreement with the reported literature. (64) A similar result was obtained in the UV–vis spectrum of (3a), [(≡SiO)3V(═O)], on SiO2–700 with two bands at 256 and 287 nm. The absence of (d–d) transitions in the 600–800 nm range indicates that V(IV) species are not significantly present. Indeed, the energy edges (Eg) of the tripodal V species on SiO2–200 and SiO2–700 are ca. 3.50 and 3.35 eV, respectively (compared to 3.58 and 3.6 eV in the case of (2), V(═O)(OtBu)3/SiO2–200, and (3), V(═O)(OtBu)3/SiO2–700, respectively). The slight red shift in the energy edge when transforming the grafted complexes into the tripodal species may be due to the creation of supplementary restrains around the deformed tetrahedral vanadium centers. These results are in agreement with the formation of monomeric vanadium sites on the surface, as supported by XANES and 51V MAS NMR.

51V MAS NMR is a complementary technique to IR, 1H MAS NMR, XANES, and UV–vis used to identify the surface vanadia species on the supported catalysts. Due to the importance in catalysis of the isolated tetrahedral vanadium complexes on various supports, the intensive 51V solid-state NMR characterization of these types of catalysts by several groups showed that the chemical shift is generally in the range of −460 to −700 ppm. (53,65−67) The attribution of the signals in the 51V NMR spectrum of these materials remains challenging due to the lack of supporting models (such as (Ph3SiO)3V(═O) and vanadium oxo containing POMSS) (68,69) and to the variety of experimental conditions during the NMR acquisition. (70,71) Grant et al. (72) have studied 51V MAS NMR silica-supported vanadia catalysts prepared by impregnation with a surface coverage between 1.3 and 15.4 V·nm–2. In the 51V NMR spectra obtained, the authors observed two different isotropic shifts, depending on the surface coverage of vanadium. For the materials prepared with the highest vanadium content (13.4 and 15.4 V·nm–2), a sharp peak appeared at −614 ppm, corresponding to the square pyramide geometry of crystalline V2O5, which is in line with previous work revealing a close isotropic shift of crystalline V2O5 at −612 ppm (73) or −610 ppm. (53) In parallel, another signal was also observed at −675 ppm in all samples, but its intensity in the case of catalysts prepared with a lower coverage of vanadium, in particular, for 1.3 V·nm–2, was very low. This signal is attributed to dispersed monomeric species, [(≡SiO)3V(═O)]. (74) Recently, Jaegers et al. (70) confirmed these MAS NMR attributions, by employing faster spinning rates (above 30 kHz) at a higher field (19.975 T), and reported a better resolution of the signal assigned to tripodal V species (at −675 ppm), even at low V content (0.6 V·nm–2). In the case of the supported species of (2a) and (3a), with low V coverages, ca. 1.1 and 0.8 V·nm–2, respectively, 51V MAS NMR revealed a similar signal with a chemical shift of −670 ppm for both samples (Figure 10), attributed to [(≡SiO)3V(═O)] isolated vanadium surface species, on SiO2–200 and SiO2–700 (Scheme 3).

Grafted species in (2) and (3) revealed a major peak at −693 and −687 ppm, respectively. Tripodal species in (2a) and (3a) exhibited a major peak at −670 ppm.
Scheme 3
Scheme 3. Proposed Mechanism for the Formation of [(≡SiO)3V(═O)] Species
The above characterizations by DRIFT, 1H and 51V MAS NMR, XANES, mass balance analysis, and UV–vis of the resulting species after a thermal treatment of bipodal (2) and monopodal (3) vanadium species revealed the formation of tripodal vanadium species, [(≡SiO)3V(═O)], in (2a) and (3a) materials.
The mechanism of the formation of these active species would be similar to SiO2–200 and SiO2–700. It has been proposed that a hydrogen transfer from a methyl group of a tert-butoxy ligand to the vanadyl oxygen occurs, leading to a V–OH fragment. The latter reacts with a siloxane bridge from the support of a Si–O–Si ring opening, leading to the formation of new isolated silanols, as described in Scheme 3 (e.g., on SiO2–200). The hydrogen transfer to the vanadyl oxygen can occur either by a transfer of one hydrogen to the oxo ligand or by the direct migration of one hydrogen from a methyl group to the oxygen of a tert-butoxide ligand, thus releasing a tBuOH molecule. It was indeed demonstrated that the thermal treatment of metal derivatives of −OSi(OtBu)3 led to the direct elimination of isobutylene, even at low temperatures (100–150 °C), to form silanols without any assistance of other ligands. (75)
Catalytic Properties
The catalytic behavior of the tripodal V species supported on SiO2–200 and SiO2–700 was evaluated in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane. A continuous fixed-bed-type reactor was used, under the following operating conditions: θ = 540 °C, P = 1 bar, and a total flow of 5 mL·min–1 (20% of C3H8 in Ar). The reactor was heated from room temperature to 540 °C under a flow of 4 mL·min–1 of argon, and then propane was introduced at 540 °C.
When propane was fed to the catalytic bed of tripodal V obtained on SiO2–200(2a), a conversion of 19% was reached at early times on stream and slightly decreased to 17% after 1000 min (Figure 11). At that time, the selectivity toward propene was 84.5%, and the byproducts included methane (6.8%), ethene (4.7%), and ethane (2.5%) as well as traces of C4 (<2%) (Figure 12, left). On the other hand, tripodal V on SiO2–700(3a) exhibited a different behavior in function of time on stream. A lower initial conversion of 15% followed by a gradual deactivation was observed, leading to 10.4% after 1000 min. Initially, the products comprised propene (88.4%), methane (6.8%), ethane (2.4%), and ethane (2.4%). However, after 1000 min, the selectivity toward methane increased to 11.4% and propene decreased to 81.7%, while ethane and ethene slightly increased to 3.6 and 3.2%, respectively. The activity and selectivity observed with (2a), composed of tripodal V species on SiO2–200, seem better than those with (3a), composed of tripodal V species on SiO2–700. Such a tendency was previously obtained in the case of vanadium species resulting from the grafting of O=V(mesityl)3 complex on SiO2–200 and on SiO2–700. (40) This is probably due to the difference in the local structure of the tripodal V on a silica pretreated at different temperatures. This difference in terms of structure has also been observed in the 51V solid-state NMR of the tripodal species [(≡SiO)3V(═O)] obtained on SiO2–200 and SiO2–700 after a thermal treatment. In fact, the larger signal observed in the case of vanadium supported on SiO2–700(3a) is attributed to the presence of different tetrahedral vanadium species, with the same coordination sphere but different local environments, which could explain the difference in terms of catalytic activity.

The present catalytic results can be directly associated with the vanadium tripodal species obtained through SOMC. These silica-supported vanadium species exhibit different behaviors in the propane dehydrogenation reaction with respect to conventional V2O5/SiO2 catalysts prepared by aqueous impregnation. (13) This is potentially due to the presence of different vanadia species (from monomeric to oligomeric) on the surface of the latter catalyst. The determination of the mechanism and the nature of the active species in each step is of high interest. However, these key issues cannot be addressed with our current ex situ characterization techniques. As reported for chromium, it is reasonable to assume that the structure of the active species in PDH is a tripodal V(III), [(≡SiO)3V]. In fact, at the initiation step, the first hydrogen abstraction of propane occurs on the V═O ligand of [(≡SiO)3V(═O)], yielding an intermediate V(V) bearing an alkyl and a hydroxy ligand. This latter species would then undergo a β-H elimination of the V-coordinated propyl ligand, leading to the formation of V hydrido hydroxyl species and the release of one propylene. The reductive elimination of the water from the V hydrido hydroxyl species, would then lead to the formation of the active species, [(≡SiO)3V(III)], during propane dehydrogenation (Scheme S2).
The full catalytic cycle can be described by two mechanistic pathways. Both involve an initialization of a V–O bond of [(≡SiO)3V] by a C–H activation of propane, giving V-propyl species and an adjacent SiOH group. The next step is comprised of a β-H transfer to give a V–H and a coordinated propylene. Following a new activation of C–H of propane, the products (propylene and hydrogen) are released. The latter reaction scheme has previously been reported for supported metal hydride catalysts. (76,77) The second mechanistic pathway may involve the cleavage and reconstruction of the V–H species with propylene coordinated, resulting in direct product release and regeneration of the tripodal species, as described for the chromium(III) system. (78) This mechanism has been earlier proposed in several reports. First, Harlin et al., who observed that the reduced V2O5-based catalyst has an enhanced activity in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane and i-butane, suggested that the reduced states of vanadium (V(IV) or V(III)) are more active. (79) Moreover, Chen et al. have revealed the presence of V(III) as a V2O3 phase by XRD after the dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene under nitrogen at 550 °C. (80) In addition, Takahara et al. have studied the hydrogen treatment of silica-supported V2O5 and suggested that a cleavage of V–O bonds has occurred with the formation of V–O–H sites adjacent to the presumably V(IV)/V(III) hydrides. (13) Hence, the V(IV)/V(III) species are most likely responsible for the dehydrogenation, whereas VO–H acidic sites are believed to trigger the formation of carbonaceous deposit, which increases with time on stream. Advanced operando techniques and theoretical calculations should offer additional insights into the reaction mechanism (Scheme S3).

In conclusion, supported oxovanadium(V) complexes were prepared by surface organometallic chemistry from the grafting of the molecular complex [V(═O)(OtBu)3], (1), onto SiO2–200 and SiO2–700, leading to materials exhibiting bipodal species [(≡SiO)2V(═O)(OtBu)] on SiO2–200(2) and monopodal species [(≡SiO)V(═O)(OtBu)2] on SiO2–700(3). They were fully characterized by elemental analysis, IR, UV–vis, solid-state NMR (1H, 13C, 51V), and XANES. A new original method has been developed in this work for the preparation of supported tetrahedral vanadium oxo tripodal species [(≡SiO)3V(═O)] via a thermal treatment of the grafted species, triggering β-H transfer and isobutene release. In addition to the characterization of all of these tripodal species by mass balance analysis, IR, UV–vis, solid-state NMR (1H), and XANES spectroscopy, the characterization by 51V MAS NMR allowed the confirmation of the chemical isotropic shift of tripodal V at −670 ppm, which is in agreement with recently reported results. The catalytic behavior of the resulting tripodal species was evaluated in the direct dehydrogenation of propane to propene, exhibiting high activity and propene selectivity. Importantly, the presented catalytic results are exclusively originated from the isolated tripodal species. Regarding the gradual deactivation of the catalyst generally reported and attributed to the formation of carbonaceous species, this phenomenon was barely observed in our case compared to the conventional V2O5 supported on silica catalysts, which presents V–O–H acidic sites responsible for coke formation.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
