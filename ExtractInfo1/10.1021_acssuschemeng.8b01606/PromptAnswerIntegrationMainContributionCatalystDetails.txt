The document is a technoeconomic analysis comparing different pathways for producing isopropanol, including from propane, but does not go into details about specific catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on process simulation, design and economic evaluation of the different routes. Since there is no discussion of propane dehydrogenation catalysts and their performance, I do not have any relevant information to extract about catalyst composition, conversion, selectivity, stability, etc.

The document focuses on the techno-economic analysis of different pathways for producing isopropanol, including from propane via propylene. However, it does not provide any details on specific PDH or ODH catalysts. The process conditions and economics are analyzed at a high level without discussing catalyst composition, preparation, or performance factors. Therefore, I do not have the necessary details to populate the XML output template. The lack of relevance is indicated in the XML.
