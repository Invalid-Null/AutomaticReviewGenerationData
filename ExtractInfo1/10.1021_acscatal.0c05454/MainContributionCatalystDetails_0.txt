The document discusses propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to produce propylene over single-atom-doped Ga2O3 catalysts. However, it does not provide sufficient details on a specific catalyst's composition, conversion, selectivity, stability, feed composition, etc. that would allow extracting a complete catalyst profile per the provided template. The main scientific contribution appears to be using DFT calculations and experiments to show Ir1-Ga2O3 breaks through the volcano plot activity pattern due to Lewis acid-base interactions, outperforming the previously reported Pt-Ga2O3 catalyst. But comprehensive catalyst performance data is not provided to populate the structured output.
