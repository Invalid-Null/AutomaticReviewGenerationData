The provided document discusses theoretical modeling of propane dehydrogenation mechanisms on palladium and palladium alloy surfaces using density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling. However, it does not contain any experimental catalyst testing data or discuss specific enhancements in catalyst performance. While it provides insights into selectivity trends, it does not report measured conversion, selectivity, or stability data for an actual catalyst. Therefore, this document does not contain the required information to extract details on a catalyst's main scientific contribution or performance enhancements.
