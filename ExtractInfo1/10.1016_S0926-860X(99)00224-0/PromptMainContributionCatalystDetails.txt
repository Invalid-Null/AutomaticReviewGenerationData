Catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) of light paraffins combined with selective hydrogen combustion (SHC): I. DH → SHC → DH catalysts in series (co-fed process mode)
Abstract
Sb2O4, In2O3, WO3 and Bi2O3, supported on 50% SiO2, were found to be highly selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) catalysts. Their respective selectivities are 99.8, 99.7, 98.5 and 98.1% at 500°C, atm pressure, WHSV 2 h−1 and C°3/C3=/H2/O2 = 80/20/20/10. Their activities vary greatly, reflected by the first-order hydrogen combustion constants (kH2, s−1) which are: In2O3 1.57, Bi2O3 0.53, WO3 0.36, Sb2O4 0.22. Among the SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2 and ZrO2 supports tested, ZrO2 was found to be the best overall carrier for the highly active In2O3.
When a 0.7 wt% Pt-Sn-ZSM-5 dehydrogenation (DH) catalyst and a 10 wt% In2O3/ZrO2 SHC catalyst are used in a sequential microreactor DH → SHC → DH co-fed process mode, higher than equilibrium yields of light olefins are obtained from the corresponding paraffins. At 550°C, atmospheric pressure and WHSV of 2 h−1 propylene yields of 29.7% at 97% selectivity (0.3 air/propane in SHC), and 33% at 89% selectivity (0.6 air/propane in SHC) are realized, compared to the equilibrium yield of 25% at 99% selectivity when only the DH catalyst is used. The yield improvements over equilibrium dehydrogenation are 19 and 32%, respectively. Under the same operating conditions but 0.2 air/isobutane ratio in the SHC stage, the isobutylene yield from isobutane is 47.5% at 99+% selectivity as compared to 40% and 99+% selectivity when only the DH catalyst is used; i.e. an 18% yield improvement over equilibrium.
The above metal oxide SHC catalyst systems might find application to improve conventional DH processes such as Oleflex and Catofin.
1. Introduction
Conventional catalytic dehydrogenation of light paraffins is well established and practiced commercially worldwide. An in-depth review of the field has recently been published [1] and includes the following processes: Oleflex (UOP) [2], STAR (Phillips Petroleum) [3], Catofin (Houdry, United Catalysts Inc., ABB Lummus Crest) [4], Linde-BASF [5] and FBD (Snamprogetti, Yarsintez) [6]. The catalysts used are either promoted Pt supported on various carriers (alumina and Group II spinels are preferred) [7], [8], [9] or variously doped chromia–aluminas [10], [11], [12]. Although these processes and their respective catalysts are highly optimized, they all suffer from the common disadvantage that their olefin yields are thermodynamically limited and that they are inherently endothermic and hence heat-deficient. All require an external supply of heat which is expensive.
In contrast to conventional dehydrogenation, oxydehydrogenation is exothermic and its olefin yields are not thermodynamically limited. Therefore, it might be expected that oxydehydrogenation would ultimately displace conventional dehydrogenation. However, because of the rather halting olefin yields, this has not occurred as yet. Propylene yields from propane as high as 35% at about 80% selectivity have been claimed for oxydehydrogenation [13], [14], but a more realistic and reproducible range lies around a 20% yield at 70% selectivity [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21].
Alternative approaches to oxydehydrogenation for obtaining higher-than-equilibrium olefin yields and for making the overall process thermoneutral or exothermic include autothermal dehydrogenation (ADH) [22], as well as combination processes of catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) and selective hydrogen combustion (SHC), i.e. DH/SHC. One of the embodiments of the latter is a sequential DH → SHC → DH process (Fig. 1) pioneered by Imai, et al., at UOP for the conversion of ethylbenzene to styrene [23], [24], [25], [26]; but has also been applied by them to the conversion of propane to propylene [27]. Either alkali-promoted Fe–Cr oxides or Group VIII noble metals were used as DH catalysts and alkali-promoted Group VIII noble metals, in particular Cs–Pt–(Sn)-based alumina-supported systems as SHC catalysts. Olefin yields in excess of equilibrium were demonstrated by these researchers in staged DH → SHC → DH operation and with oxygen (e.g. air) supplied to the SHC zone [23], [24], [25], [26], [27].

Lin et al. [28] utilized Cu-, Fe-, or Ni-ZSM-5 compositions as SHC catalysts by controlling the poremouth dimensions of the zeolite via CVD of TMOS, thereby achieving preferential hydrogen combustion over isobutane (highest selectivity obtained was 98% at 530°C with a 40.5 h TMOS-treated SiCuHZSM-5). No experiments are recorded in conjunction with a DH catalyst, nor are any competitive experiments shown between propane/propylene and hydrogen. It is surmised that TMOS treatments in excess of 40.5 h would be required to constrict the zeolite’s poremouth sufficiently to achieve, if at all possible, satisfactory SHC selectivity for propane/propylene/hydrogen mixtures.
It is unclear at this juncture why the DH/SHC process concept has not been commercialized thus far. There may be many reasons for it, not least of which might be the instability of the Cs–Pt-based SHC catalysts caused by the volatility of the Cs under reaction conditions, the difficulty of achieving sufficient SHC selectivity for hydrogen propane/propylene mixtures with poremouth-modified zeolite based compositions, as well as, potential safety hazards arising from simultaneously handling hydrogen and oxygen in the same (SHC) reactor.
In view of the limited amount of open literature accorded the DH/SHC process and their catalysts, and because of the appealing future potential of the process, we chose to further explore this concept and its catalysts. Recently, we have discovered that certain base metal oxides exhibit excellent SHC properties [29]. In that study the effort was primarily concentrated on the identification of effective metal oxide systems for SHC and the underlying principles governing their efficacy. It was found, that all useful SHC metal oxides contained at least one element having a lone pair of electrons in their prevailing oxidation state under reaction conditions. The current study extends this working hypothesis to include additional metal oxides and explores their use in actual DH → SHC → DH microreactor process studies.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts
The metal oxide catalysts were prepared in general as described earlier [29]. Specifically, the 50 wt% SiO2-supported In2O3, Bi2O3, Pb3O4 and ZnO systems were prepared from aqueous solutions of the appropriate metal nitrate salts and silica sol (Ludox AS-40); the resulting slurries were refluxed for 16 h, dried at 120°C, pulverized, calcined in air at 290°C for 4 h and at 600°C for 4 h. The supported Sb2O4- and Nb2O5-containing catalysts were prepared by refluxing aqueous slurries of Sb2O3 and Nb oxalate, respectively, with silica sol; the supported MoO3 and WO3 catalysts by refluxing ammonium heptamolybdate and ammonium metatungstate, respectively, in an ammoniacal solution with appropriate amounts of silica sol; and the alumina-supported V2O5 by refluxing a dilute nitric acid solution of ammonium metavandate with Catapal alumina. Following calcination, all of the resulting materials were crushed, pelletized and sized to 20–40 mesh, before use in catalytic evaluations. The In2O3 catalysts supported on ZrO2, TiO2 and Al2O3 were prepared in an analogous manner.
The Pt-Sn-ZSM-5 (0.7 wt% Pt) was obtained from Dr. Dessau (Mobil Technology Company) and was prepared according to the well-known Argauer and Landolt method, also utilizing tin in the synthesis [30].
2.2. Experimental setup and procedures
2.2.1. SHC tests
The SHC properties of the supported metal oxides were tested at 500°C and atmospheric pressure in fixed-bed microreactors and the products analyzed by conventional GC (Hewlett Packard) [29]. The feed was a simulated conventional dehydrogenation product containing propane, propylene and hydrogen in an 80 : 20 : 20 mole ratio (i.e. a simulated typical Oleflex or Catofin effluent). The oxidant was simulated air (i.e. 21% O2 + 79% He) which was co-fed with the feed to the SHC reactor. The amount of oxygen fed to the reactor was the stoichiometric requirement (i.e. O2/H2 = 10 : 20) to combust all of the hydrogen in the feed to water. With this hydrogen/oxidant ratio a 100% conversion of hydrogen and oxygen would be expected with an ideally selective SHC catalyst. Since none of the examined catalysts are perfectly selective, some of the oxygen is also used to combust part of the hydrocarbons.
The heats of combustion of propane, propylene and hydrogen at 500°C are 538, 450 and 58 kcal/mole, respectively. Since the heat requirement for propane dehydrogenation is 29.5 kcal/mole, the heat generated by just the hydrogen combustion at complete oxygen utilization of the above feed is about twice that required for the dehydrogenation of 20% of the propane which would be fed to the DH reactor preceding the SHC stage of a DH → SHC → DH assembly. Thus, irrespective of the selectivity of the SHC catalyst, the heat requirement of conventional dehydrogenation will be more than compensated by the SHC reaction in a staged DH → SHC → DH process.
2.2.2. DH and DH → SHC → DH tests
The DH → SHC → DH co-fed process experiments were carried out, using three quartz microreactors connected in series (Fig. 1). In the baseline DH experiment, the first and third reactor contained 1 g of the DH catalyst and the second reactor sized quartz. When DH → SHC → DH was carried out, the second reactor contained 0.1 g of the SHC catalyst diluted with quartz. Neat propane was fed to the first reactor in both cases, no oxygen or air to the second reactor in the DH-only experiments, while synthetic air was cofed to the SHC reactor in pre-determined measured amounts in the DH → SHC → DH experiments.
A 0.7 wt% Pt-Sn-ZSM-5 was used as the DH catalyst; the SHC catalyst was a 10 wt% In2O3/ZrO2. The carbon balances were 100 ± 2%.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Selection of SHC catalysts
A number of metal oxides were recently identified showing exceptional selectivity for the preferential combustion of hydrogen (SHC) over that of paraffins or olefins [29]. The most selective among them contained elements in stable oxidation states during reaction conditions having a lone pair of electrons and comprise the systems Bi2O3, Bi2Mo3O12 and In2Mo3O12. In this earlier study the primarily emphasis was on the identification of metal oxides having superior SHC selectivities.
The aim of the present catalyst selection process was to expand the range of metal oxide compositions and to identify metal oxides which show not only excellent SHC selectivity, but also superior SHC activity, particularly in the presence of co-fed air. In order for the SHC catalyst selection test to be meaningful, so that the selected catalysts could ultimately be used in a DH → SHC → DH process assembly, the candidate catalysts were tested under process conditions and with a process feed typical of the effluent coming from a conventional dehydrogenation unit (e.g. from an Oleflex or Catofin unit). Hence, the testing feed was composed of C°3/C3=/H2 = 80/20/20, the temperature 500°C and the pressure atmospheric. To this simulated conventional dehydrogenation effluent mixture, oxygen was co-fed at a ratio O2/H2 = 10/20 (see details in Section 2).
The results of these tests are illustrated in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, and Table 1. From Fig. 2 it is apparent that the hydrogen conversion is rather stable over the 5 h the tests were carried out. Table 1 reveals that the ratios of the first-order rate constants for hydrogen conversion vs. hydrocarbon conversion k (H2)/k (HC) for Sb2O4 and In2O3 are exceptionally high, i.e. 423 and 313 respectively. These values translate to SHC selectivities of 99.8 and 99.7%, respectively. The next highest selectivities are found for WO3 (98.5%) and Bi2O3 (98.1%). Certainly In3+, Sb3+ and Bi3+ (with WO3, partial reduction and the generation of some W4+ centers is invoked) satisfy the lone pair hypothesis advanced earlier [29]. The lone pair of electrons is deemed to impart a partial radical character to the oxygen attached to this metal ion, creating the active center to homolytically dissociate the hydrogen molecule in preference of hydrocarbons.

All metal oxides are supported on silica (50% active phase), except V2O5 which is supported on Al2O3. Experiments were performed by co-feeding 80cc/min propane, 20cc/min propylene, 20cc/min hydrogen and 10cc/min oxygen over the metal oxides at 500°C, atm pressure and WHSV of 2h−1. Hydrocarbon rate constants were calculated assuming first-order kinetics; selectivities shown are the ks for hydrogen conversion divided by the sum of the ks for hydrogen plus hydrocarbon conversion.
For clarification purposes it might be of interest at this juncture to point out the differences between the SHC selective metal oxides identified by us above and earlier [29] and those of Lin et. al. [28]. The SHC selective metal oxide catalysts identified by us derive their effectiveness because of their intrinsic chemical and electronic properties. The catalysts of Lin et. al. do not fulfill the lone pair of electrons requirement discussed above and their active phases are unselective by themselves. Their systems derive SHC selectivity only through mechanical manipulation of constricting the pore size of the zeolite containing the active phase.
While the proposed lone pair of electrons hypothesis appears to hold for SHC selectivity of metal oxides, e.g. the relative ratio of hydrogen and hydrocarbons activities, it does not say anything about the absolute activities of these compositions. Since it is important that potential SHC catalysts possess not only excellent SHC selectivities, but also good activities, the absolute activities must be assessed experimentally. As illustrated in Table 1, the hydrogen activities of the preferred selective SHC compositions vary substantially. The first-order rate constants for hydrogen combustion kH2 (s−1) at 500°C are: In2O3 1.57, Bi2O3 0.53, WO3 0.36, and Sb2O4 0.22.
Somewhat surprising is the high hydrogen combustion activity of In2O3. Since it is three times that of Bi2O3 and seven times that of Sb2O4, the In2O3 system was investigated more thoroughly and on various supports. Comparing In2O3 loadings of 2, 10 and 50 wt% on SiO2 it was found, that the 10 and 50 wt%-supported materials exhibited about the same hydrogen conversion activity, while the 2 wt% sample was considerably less active. The 10 wt% sample corresponds approximately to a monolayer of In2O3 on SiO2, assuming uniform spreading of In2O3 over the support. With additional supports it was found that at the 10 wt% In2O3 loading level (at WHSV = 37 h−1,C3/C3=/H2/O2 = 80/20/20/10 and 500°C) hydrogen conversion increased in the order SiO2 < TiO2 < Al2O3 < ZrO2. The SHC selectivity of In2O3/ZrO2 was still high at >97%, the TiO2- or Al2O3- supported systems were less selective. No decline in SHC performance is observed over extended periods of time (e.g. 100+ h) with the 10 wt% In2O3/ZrO2 system even at the rather severe throughput conditions of WHSV = 37 h−1, while the other three supported materials show some activity decline with time on stream. Therefore, the 10 wt% In2O3/ZrO2 system was chosen for the microreactor co-fed mode performance studies reported below.
3.2. Dehydrogenation (DH) of propane
The DH base experiment was conducted with a 1 g 0.7 wt% Pt/Sn/ZSM-5 loaded into Reactors 1 and 3, quartz chips into Reactor 2, and no air fed to Reactor 2 (see Section 2 and Fig. 1). The neat propane flow-rate was adjusted so that near-equilibrium propylene yield was obtained. At 550°C and WHSV of 2 g C°3/g cat/h the propylene yield was 25% (illustrated in Fig. 4 as the first bar at zero air/propane). The propylene yield was about the same when only the first reactor was used at the same flow-rate. Hence, the yield obtained was considered the equilibrium yield under the experimental conditions used, forming the comparative basis for the DH → SHC → DH experiments discussed below. Some hydrogenolysis by-products, such as methane and C2s were also observed, but amounted to no more than 2% of the total hydrocarbon feed.

DH catalyst = 0.7% Pt-Sn-ZSM-5, SHC catalyst = 10% In2O3/ZrO2, WHSV = 2 h−1, feed = neat propane to the DH catalyst (reactor 1), co-fed oxidant = artificial air (21%O2/79% He) to the SHC catalyst (reactor 2).
3.3. DH → SHC → DH of propane
A simple calculation was made to estimate the anticipated DH → SHC → DH olefin yields from propane and isobutane (Fig. 5) as a function of the DH stages in the assembly. The calculations are based on thermal data and assume that complete equilibrium conversion is achieved in each of the DH stages and complete hydrogen conversion in each of the SHC stages. At 538°C and 1 atm pressure, the anticipated ideal propane conversions to propylene (assuming no by-product formation) are: An equilibrium propylene yield of 27.7% using only a DH stage, a 41.2% yield using one DH stage, followed by one SHC stage, followed by another DH stage (i.e. DH → SHC → DH), etc. A doubling of the equilibrium propylene yield is anticipated after only three DH and two SHC stages, (i.e. DH → SHC → DH → SHC → DH). In practice, the DH → SHC → DH staging could be repeated as often as practical to achieve commercially desirable olefin yields.

Calculation based on equilibrium thermodynamic data. Assumptions: Temp. = 538°C, press. = 1 atm., complete hydrogen conversion between each DH stage via SHC.
Preliminary to the actual DH → SHC → DH experiments, the performance of the In2O3–ZrO2 SHC catalyst was tested by itself at varying air flow rates, fed to Reactor 2. Even at the highest air/propane ratio, no oxygen was detected in the effluent of Reactor 3, i.e. all the oxygen fed to Reactor 2 had been converted to H2O and a minor amount to COx. The SHC catalyst performed as expected.
The DH → SHC → DH results (DH catalyst = 1 g of 0.7 wt% Pt/Sn/ZSM-5, SHC catalyst = 0.1 g of 10 wt% In2O3/ZrO2 diluted with quartz) for the conversion of propane at varying air-flow-rates fed to Reactor 2 are shown in Fig. 4. The propylene yield obtained from neat propane at 550°C, 1 atm, WHSV 2 h−1 is 29.7% with 97% selectivity at 0.3 air/propane, and 33% with 89% selectivity at 0.6 air/propane in the SHC stage. These values correspond to 19 and 32% propylene yield improvements, respectively, over the 25% equilibrium propylene yield obtained when the DH catalyst is used alone (vide supra).
As the air/propane ratio is increased to the SHC reactor the propylene yield increases, but so does the COx content. Air/propane ratios in excess of 0.5 are therefore not desirable with the SHC catalyst examined here.
3.4. DH → SHC → DH of isobutane
As is the case with propane, higher-than-equilibrium olefin yields are also anticipated from isobutane employing the DH → SHC → DH process concept. At 538°C and 1 atm pressure, the anticipated idealized isobutane conversions to isobutylene are: 47.5% using a DH catalyst alone; 65.6% using one DH stage, followed by one SHC stage, followed by another DH stage, (i.e. DH → SHC → DH); etc. (Fig. 5).
The DH → SHC → DH experimental results using the 0.7 wt% Pt-Sn-ZSM-5 DH catalyst and the 10 wt% In2O3–ZrO2 SHC catalyst are shown in Fig. 6. The isobutylene yield obtained using the DH catalyst alone (i.e. again with quartz in Reactor 2 instead of an SHC catalyst) was 40%, and considered the reference equilibrium olefin yield under the experimental conditions used. With the SHC catalyst in Reactor 2, an isobutylene yield of 47.4% was obtained at an air/isobutane ratio of 0.2 and with no observable COx formation. This is an 18% isobutylene yield enhancement over DH operation alone and with no sacrifice in selectivity. As the air-to-isobutane ratio increases to 0.4, the isobutylene yield rises slightly to 47.6, but 0.4% COx is also formed. As the air/isobutane ratio increases still further to 0.6, the isobutylene yield begins to decline, with 44.0% isobutylene formed and COx rising to 1.8%. High air/isobutane ratios are therefore counterproductive when using this particular SHC catalyst.

4. Conclusions
Extending and consistent with an earlier study [29], certain metal oxides when subjected to a simulated feed representative of a typical conventional dehydrogenation effluent to which gaseous oxygen is co-fed, exhibit excellent selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) properties. Among the most selective are Sb2O4, In2O3, WO3 and Bi2O3 (all supported on 50% SiO2) giving SHC selectivities at 500°C of 99.8, 99.7, 98.5 and 98.1%, respectively. All of these metal oxides contain metal ions in an oxidation state during reaction conditions having a lone pair of electrons (e.g. Sb3+, In3+, W4+, Bi3+) imparting a partial radical character to its neighboring oxygen and thereby creating catalytic centers to homolytically dissociate hydrogen in preference of hydrocarbons (i.e. an earlier advanced hypothesis [29]).
The most active of these compositions is In2O3, while the least active is Sb2O4. The first-order hydrogen combustion constants (kH2) for In2O3, Bi2O3, WO3 and Sb2O4, at 500°C are 1.57, 0.53, 0.36 and 0.22 s−1, respectively.
Among SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2 as carriers, ZrO2 was found to be the preferred support for In2O3. A 10 wt% In2O3–ZrO2 composition (i.e. monolayer coverage of the support) gave the highest SHC selectivity, activity and stability over extended periods of time (i.e. 100+ h on stream) under co-fed reaction conditions (500°C, atm pressure, WHSV 2 h−1 and C°3/C3=/H2/O2 = 80/20/20/10).
This 10 wt% In2O3–ZrO2 SHC catalyst when used in conjunction with a 0.7 wt% Pt-Sn-ZSM-5 DH catalyst in a DH → SHC → DH co-fed microreactor arrangement at 550°C, atmospheric pressure and WHSV 2 h−1, gave propylene yields from neat propane of 29.7% at 97% selectivity (0.3 air/propane in SHC stage) and 33% at 89% selectivity(0.6 air/propane in SHC stage). The DH catalyst alone gave a 25% yield at 99% selectivity. The olefin yield enhancement above equilibrium is therefore 19 and 32%, respectively. Similarly, isobutylene yields of 47.5% at 99+% selectivity were obtained from neat isobutane with a 0.2 air/isobutane ratio in the SHC stage, the DH catalyst alone gave a 40% yield at 99+% selectivity. The olefin yield enhancement over equilibrium is therefore 18%.
The SHC metal oxides identified here might form a base to improve well-known conventional dehydrogenation processes such as Oleflex or Catofin via DH → SHC → DH co-fed process operation.
