The given document discusses the synthesis and characterization of a ZSM-5@meso-SAPO-34 core-shell zeolite composite catalyst and its application in methanol to aromatics conversion. It does not relate to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The catalyst is utilized for the conversion of methanol to benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX), not for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
