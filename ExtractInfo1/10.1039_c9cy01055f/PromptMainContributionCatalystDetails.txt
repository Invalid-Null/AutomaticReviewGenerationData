Understanding trends in methane oxidation to formaldehyde: statistical analysis of literature data and based hereon experiments†
A regression tree analysis of about 300 literature data sets on selective oxidation of methane to methanol/formaldehyde was applied to identify fundamentals affecting catalyst performance and being relevant for tailored catalyst design. According to this analysis, the kind of catalytically active metal in metal oxide species does not play a significant role in both activity and product selectivity. Such apparent unpredictability was explained by the fact that the support also affects the selectivity thus hiding the effect of supported metal oxide. To minimise the support contribution, we have initially screened various bare supports for their activity and selectivity. SiC was identified as the most inert material in the target reaction even in comparison with SiO2. A series of SiC-based catalysts with supported VOx, MoOx, FeOx or CuOx species were prepared and tested for elucidating the effects of the kind of active metal, its surface density and temperature on formaldehyde selectivity. We established that the Allen electronegativity of the active metal can be used as a descriptor for the latter catalyst property. The electronegativity seems to correlate with the overall activation energy of methane conversion thus suggesting the importance of electron transitions for catalyst functioning.
Introduction
Methane is the major constituent of natural gas (70–90%),1 methane hydrate, i.e. CH4·5.75H2O (15%, gaseous),2 and biogas (50–75%)3 with the latter being a renewable feedstock. The world natural gas production in 2015 amounted to 3.5 × 1012 m3. However, about 90% of this amount has been simply combusted for heat and energy purposes. In view of limited crude oil resources, the development of processes for conversion of methane into value-added products is of substantial economic interest. The main commercial routes are the catalytic steam reforming of methane to a mixture of CO and H2 for the large-scale synthesis of ammonia (Haber–Bosch process) and production of methanol or higher hydrocarbons through the Fischer–Tropsch process.4 To a minor extent, methane is also converted into hydrocyanic acid via the Andrussow or Degussa processes.5
Such hampered methane valorisation is mainly caused by the nature of methane itself. The highly symmetric molecule is thermodynamically very stable due to the high H–CH3 bond strength of 438.9 kJ mol−1 (298 K).6 Therefore, it is resistant to many chemical reactions. This situation is, however, changed in the presence of oxidising agents. For example, methane can be oxidised to C2 hydrocarbons (C2H4 and C2H6)7–11 or methanol and/or formaldehyde.10,12–20 The latter reaction is considered to be an energy-efficient alternative to the current large-scale methanol production from synthesis gas with the latter being generated through the highly endothermic methane steam reforming.
Various metal oxides have been applied for development of catalysts for methane oxidation to methanol and/or formaldehyde.10,12–16 Oxides of V, Fe, Sc, W, Mo and Os are the most suitable candidates for the target reaction as concluded from systematic high-throughput testing of catalysts consisting of one of the catalytically active 43 different elements.21 The use of iron oxide seems to be attractive when taking into account the fact that iron is a part of the active centre in methane monooxygenases selectively converting methane into methanol under ambient conditions.22 The mimicry of such a natural process as a catalytic reaction would be sustainable with regard to the substrate-to-product conversion. Another aspect of sustainability is the application of inexpensive and abundant active metals.23 Cu, Mo, Co and V belong to abundant materials and have already been applied for preparation of catalysts for methane oxidation to methanol.10,12–16
The creation of a certain structure of catalytically active metal oxide is a challenging task and depends on the element. For example, isolated FeOx species on the surface of SiO2 are considered to be active and selective for formaldehyde formation from methane.24,25 The selectivity decreased when the amount of iron was higher than 2 wt%.24 A similar effect of metal loading was observed for V2O5/SiO2 catalysts with respect to the activity; the methane conversion increased with increasing vanadium site density up to 1 atom per nm2.26 The choice of an appropriate support is a further crucial point in catalyst design. SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, SnO2 and various zeolites are the typical supports often used for designing methane oxidation catalysts. Silicon carbide (SiC), which is a non-oxygen containing material, is a very suited support in heterogeneous catalysis due to its high thermal conductivity, high resistance to oxidation, high mechanical strength, low specific weight, and chemical inertness.27,28 The advantages that can be offered by SiC for the development of active and selective catalysts were recently demonstrated for Fischer–Tropsch,29 the partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas30 and the oxidative coupling of methane.31
For designing catalytic materials with improved activity and selectivity, it is highly desired to establish the relationship(s) between the catalyst composition and performance. To this end, various statistical and optimisation tools were applied for analysing a large number of literature data.11,32,33 For example, the regression tree algorithm originally proposed by Breiman et al.34 has been successfully demonstrated in the analysis of literature data on the oxidative coupling of methane.11 On the basis of a huge number of experimental data (1868 data sets from 421 references), a strategy for designing selective catalysts was suggested. Later, this strategy was validated experimentally by some of the present authors.33 Recently, a meta-analysis method applied for analysing literature OCM data concluded that well-performing catalysts should be composed of elements forming stable carbonates under OCM conditions.35
Against the background described above, the main purpose of the present contribution was to identify parameters relevant for design of catalysts for methane oxidation to formaldehyde through regression tree analysis of available literature data. Another purpose of our study was to prove the predictive power of such analysis experimentally. As supports were found to be one of the important factors determining catalyst performance, we firstly screened various bare supports for their activity and selectivity in the target reaction with β-SiC being identified as the most inert one. To investigate the effects of the kind of active metal and its loading, supported catalysts possessing supported oxide species of V, Fe, Cu, or Mo with low site densities (≤0.34 atoms per nm2) were prepared. The catalysts were characterised by H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF STEM) to describe the supported metal oxides with regard to their dispersion. Methane oxidation tests were carried out in the temperature range from 500 to 650 °C under continuous-flow conditions.
Mathematical approach and experimental details
Regression tree analysis
Regression trees are mappings into intervals of real numbers that are composed according to tree graphs. Their principle consists of repeatedly splitting the set of available input data into disjoint subsets in such a way that the sum of squared errors (SSEs) with respect to the mean values of the response in those subsets is minimal. In more detail, consider a set S = {x1,…,xn} of input data for which the corresponding values y1,…,yn of the response variable are known. Each input xi is a vector of values of some p descriptors d1,…,dp, in particular, xi = (d1,i,…,dp,i). According to each of those descriptors, the set S can be in various ways split into two disjoint subsets S1 and S2 such that S1 ∪ S2 = S. For example, if dj is a real-valued descriptor, then the splits
S1 = {xi: dj,i ≤ v}, S2 = {xi: dj,i > v} or
S1 = {xi: dj,i ≥ v}, S2 = {xi: dj,i < v} for some value v
are commonly used. The SSE for the split (S1, S2) is
where |Si| denotes the number of elements of the set Si. Among all possible splits according to all possible descriptors, always a split leading to the minimal SSE is used: SSE = min {SSE(S1,S2):(S1,S2)}.
This approach is at first applied to the whole set S of available input data, then to the resulting sets , etc. This splitting continues as long as needed, yielding a hierarchy of areas in the input space, which in the case of real-valued descriptors are rectangular.
Depending on the number of such splits that are consecutively performed, trees of different sizes can be obtained. The most appropriate tree size is usually chosen using cross-validation:
• The set of available catalytic data is randomly partitioned into k parts of approximately equal size.
• With each possible tree size, k trees are constructed using, for the construction of each of them, always k – 1 parts and leaving the remaining k-th part to measure the SSE of predictions Tr(xi) by the constructed tree, Tr.
• To assess the appropriateness of the considered tree size, the SSE values for the test data are averaged over all k constructed trees with this size.
Catalyst preparation
Silicon carbide, β-SiC, served as a support in the form of grains as received (SICAT catalyst, Willstädt, Germany; impurities in ppmwt: Fe: 60, Al: 15, Ca: 80, Na: 80, K: 100, S: 50; sieve fraction: 250–500 μm; BET specific surface area: 25.5 m2 g−1; incipient wetness pore volume: 0.84 mL g−1).36 The support was impregnated with an aqueous solution of V, Fe, Cu or Mo salt (cf.Table 1) via the incipient wetness impregnation method at room temperature.37 The apparent surface site density (Sd) of the active metal expressed as the number of metal atoms per nm2 of the β-SiC support was adjusted to 0.02, 0.15, and 0.34 nm−2 assuming that the total amount of the supported metal oxide is a hundred-percent dispersed. These three Sd levels correspond to the metal loading (Ld) varying from 43 ppmwt (V) to 1380 ppmwt (Mo). After drying at 70 °C for 10 h, the catalyst precursors were calcined in a muffle furnace in static air at 500 °C for 6 h. The samples are abbreviated as 0.xx MOx/β-SiC with 0.xx = site density (0.02, 0.15, and 0.34 atoms M per nm2) of the metal oxide, M = V, Fe, Cu, and Mo. The respective metal salt, its aqueous solution concentration, Sd, and Ld are given in Table 1.

Characterisation
Powder X-ray diffraction data were collected in a reflection geometry on a theta/theta diffractometer (X'Pert Pro, PANalytical, Almelo; CuKα (λ = 1.5418 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA)) in the 2θ range of 5 to 80° with an X'Celerator RTMS detector. Phases were identified using the ICDD PDF-2 database.
The BET specific surface area of each sample was determined from nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms collected at 77 K on a BELSORP-mini II apparatus (BEL Japan, Inc.).
For determining the degree of agglomeration of VOx, FeOx, CuOx, and MoOx species, temperature-programmed reduction tests with H2 (H2-TPR) were performed in a set-up containing eight individually heated continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactors.38 Analogously to the pre-treatment before catalytic tests (see below), the samples were initially heated in a flow of 10 vol% O2 in Ar at 600 °C for 1 hour to oxidise metals to their highest oxidation state and to remove adsorbed water. After cooling to 50 °C, they were purged with Ar for 15 min and then heated in a flow of 0.25 vol% H2 in Ar at 10 K min−1 to 900 °C. The amount of differently loaded catalysts for the H2-TPR tests was chosen in such way that the criterion for appropriate operating variables according to Monti and Baiker was fulfilled.39 An on-line mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum Omnistar) was used to record signals with a frequency of about 1 s−1 at the following m/z units: 2 (H2), 18 (H2O) and 40 (Ar).
A further appropriate characterisation technique providing insights into MOx species dispersion is electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). X-band (9.8 GHz) EPR spectra were recorded on a Bruker EMX CW-micro spectrometer at 293 and 100 K with a microwave power of 6.3 mW, a modulation frequency of 100 kHz and a modulation amplitude of 5 G.
The STEM images were recorded on a JEM-ARM200F microscope (JEOL, corrector: CEOS) coupled with a JED-2300 (JEOL) energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer for elementary analysis. The aberration corrected HAADF STEM images were taken at the following settings: 200 kV with a spot size of approximately 0.13 nm, a convergence angle of 30–36°, and collection semi-angles of 90–170 mrad. After grinding by hand in an agate mortar, the 0.34 FeOx/β-SiC and 0.34 MoOx/β-SiC samples were deposited on a holey carbon supported Cu grid (300 mesh). They were pre-treated similar to those for catalytic tests (heated in static air at 600 °C for 4 h in a muffle furnace, cooled down in air to room temperature, stored in a desiccator over P4O10 overnight).
Catalytic tests
Catalytic tests were carried out in an in-house developed set-up equipped with 8 fixed-bed tubular (∅i.d. of 4 mm) reactors made of quartz operating in parallel at 1.5 bar (absolute). Formaldehyde as the main target product is susceptible to decomposition at high temperatures.40 Therefore, to avoid its decomposition, the reactor volume after the catalyst bed was reduced by inserting a quartz rod of 3 mm in outer diameter thus resulting in a decrease in residence time due to an increase in the linear gas velocity. To prevent condensation of the reaction products, the reactor outlet and all connection lines were heated to about 150 °C. Each reactor was loaded with 1.000 g of fresh catalyst diluted with SiC (1 : 1 by weight, ESK-SiC Germany, sieve fraction: 250–355 μm, treated with boiling nitric acid (65%) for 17 h, washed and rinsed twice in deionised water at room temperature and finally heated in a muffle furnace at 700 °C for 11 h). The modified residence time, τmod = m(cat)/(gas), was varied in the range from 0.9 to 11.6 g s mL−1 which was achieved by varying the feed flow rates per reactor (66.7, 33.3, 16.7, 8.3, and 5.2 mL min−1). To test the bare supports and to take into account their different specific surface areas, the sample amounts were 0.10 (ZSM-5), 0.20 (CeO2, ZrO2–SiO2, ZrO2–WO3, Nb2O5, and SiO2), 0.31 (β-SiC–TiC), and 1.03 g (β-SiC). The feed flow rates per reactor were 66.7, 33.3, 16.7, and 8.3 mL min−1 thus resulting in τmod between 0.09 and 7.44 g s mL−1. The catalysts as well as the bare supports were tested at 500, 550, 600 and 650 °C using a CH4/O2/N2 (30/10/60) feed (CH4: 3.5, Linde; O2: 6.0, Air Liquide; N2: 5.0, Air Liquide). Catalytic data were measured after 1 h stabilisation. Before testing, the catalysts were heated in an air flow (11 mL min−1 per reactor) to 600 °C (7 K min−1) for 4 h. N2 served as an internal standard.
The feed components and the reaction products were analysed using an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890A) equipped with a methaniser (operated at 400 °C), flame ionisation detector with an HP Plot Q column for analysis of CO, CO2, hydrocarbons and oxygenates and thermal conductivity detector with HP Plot Q and Molsieve 5A columns for analysis of O2 and N2. Each sample was measured three times under selected reaction conditions. The conversion of oxygen was calculated from its inlet and outlet molar flow rates (eqn (1)), while the methane conversion was calculated on a product basis (eqn (2)). The product selectivity was calculated on a product basis (eqn (3)). The carbon balance was 100 ± 6%.

Calibration of formaldehyde as the main product and methanol in minor concentration was performed by dosing a quantitative mixture of 1,3,5-trioxane and methanol in water, respectively, with a heated dispensing syringe pump (ISCO, Lincoln USA). This mixture was evaporated and trioxane was thermally decomposed at 220 °C in a CH4/N2 carrier gas. Other gaseous components were calibrated by using a certified reference mixture (Messer).
Results and discussion
Statistical analysis of literature data
To identify parameters affecting methane conversion and product selectivity in methane oxidation to methanol/formaldehyde, we have initially analysed about 300 experimental data reported in various scientific articles on this topic. Each data set contains essential data related to the catalyst composition, preparation method, catalyst activity and product selectivity as well as reaction parameters such as the temperature, contact time and feed composition.20 We applied regression tree analysis for methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity as a function of various parameters summarised in Table 2. Such analysis is an advanced approach for establishing dependence of continuous response variables on arbitrary input variables without any models or assumptions about possible relationships between independent and dependent variables. The obtained trees are shown in Fig. 1. The numbers in the circles represent average values of methane conversion (Fig. 1(a)) or formaldehyde selectivity (Fig. 1(b)). Those in the starting nodes with the highest position in the hierarchy stand for the mean values among all data in the database for methane conversion (0.054, Fig. 1(a)) and the selectivity to formaldehyde (0.40, Fig. 1(b)). The paths from the root illustrate how a certain parameter influences the conversion and the selectivity. The ratio of CH4 : O2 has the most decisive influence on the conversion. On average, decreasing this ratio below the stoichiometric ratio of 0.88 positively affects the conversion. As expected, the second important parameter is the reaction temperature; the higher the temperature, the higher the conversion. The catalyst preparation method, the kind of active metal and its apparent surface density are located at lower levels of the tree hierarchy.

Fig. 1 Regression trees for (a) methane conversion and (b) formaldehyde selectivity.
In comparison with methane conversion, the most relevant parameters for achieving high formaldehyde selectivity are the method of deposition of active components on the support, the kind of support, and the apparent surface density of the catalytically active metal, while the reaction temperature and CH4 : O2 ratio are less significant. Surprisingly, the kind of metal oxide does not appear to be significantly relevant for the selectivity. On the basis of the decision tree in Fig. 1(b), selective catalysts should consist of supports such as SiO2, ZSM-5, α-Fe2O3, WO3, or SnO2 having on their surface less than 0.5 active metal per nm2 and operating below 850 K with a reaction feed with the ratio of CH4 to O2 higher than 2.3.
Identifying the inert support material
In order to unambiguously understand if and how the kind of supported metal oxide and its surface density affect the product selectivity and catalyst activity, it is highly important to prepare catalysts on the basis of support(s) with negligible activity in methane oxidation. Therefore, we firstly tested various supports such as CeO2, ZrO2–SiO2, ZrO2–WO3, Nb2O5, β-SiC–TiC, β-SiC, ZSM-5, and SiO2 for their activity and selectivity at 600 °C. The supports strongly differ in their acidic and redox properties. ZSM-5 (ref. 41–48) and SiO2 (ref. 24, 40, and 49–57) have been often used for preparation of catalysts for the oxidation of methane to formaldehyde, while all other materials have not been applied up to now. Fig. 2(a) shows methane conversion as a function of modified contact time (τmod). The slope of such dependence at low τmod values represents the initial rate of methane oxidation, i.e. the larger the slope, the higher the rate. The supports can be ordered according to their activity as follows CeO2 > ZrO2–SiO2 > ZSM-5 > ZrO2–WO3 > Nb2O5 > SiO2 ≫ β-SiC–TiC > β-SiC.
Fig. 2 (a) Methane conversion versus modified contact time (τmod) and (b) the selectivity to CO and CO2versus methane conversion obtained over bare supports at 600 °C.
Carbon oxides, formaldehyde and methanol were detected over all the supports tested, with the alcohol being formed in trace amounts only. The effect of methane conversion on the selectivity to carbon oxides over the supports is shown in Fig. 2(b). The selectivity increases with the conversion as a consequence of consecutive oxidation of methanol/formaldehyde primarily formed from methane. It is also worth mentioning that the lowest selectivity to carbon oxides was obtained over β-SiC, which showed the lowest methane conversion. Thus, this material was selected for preparation of supported catalysts possessing VOx, FeOx, CuOx or MoOx species with the purpose of elucidating the effects of the kind of active metal and its surface density on the activity and product selectivity in the oxidation of methane to formaldehyde.
MOx/β-SiC catalysts and their selected physicochemical properties
The X-ray powder patterns of the bare β-SiC support (Fig. S1†) matched with the powder diffraction file [PDF 00-029-1129] of β-SiC as the main phase with a small fraction (<5%) of Si [PDF 01-089-5012]. Moreover, a low intensity of reflection at 34.0° 2 theta indicated the presence of a small amount of α-SiC.27
The specific surface area of β-SiC was 25.5 m2 g−1. On the basis of this value, we prepared MOx/β-SiC (MOx stands for FeOx, VOx, CuOx, or MoOx) with an apparent metal density of 0.02, 0.15, or 0.34 nm−2. These values are lower than 0.7 and 0.3 nm−2 for SiO2-supported catalysts with monolayer coverage by VOx and MoOx, respectively.58,59 The latter values are actually the lowest limit reported in the literature for catalysts on the basis of other metal oxide supports. Therefore, it might be expected that the metal oxide species on the surface of β-SiC in our study are distributed statistically. However, a possibility exists that some of them interact with each other forming dimers or aggregates with a higher degree of polymerisation.
To derive insights into the distribution and redox properties of supported MOx species on β-SiC, we performed H2-TPR tests. The potential of this method for such purposes is well documented for VOx/SiO2,60 FeOx/SiO2,41,54 CuOx/SiO2,61,62 MoOx/SiO2 (ref. 63) and MoOx/Al2O3.64 UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy typically applied for studying the degree of aggregation of MOx species failed due to a strong absorption of β-SiC in the wavelength range where MOx species also absorb (cf. Fig. S2†).65–67
Using an on-line mass spectrometer, we monitored water (m/z = 18) formed upon hydrogen oxidation by surface MOx species. The obtained profiles of H2O are summarised in Fig. 3. For comparison, the profile for the bare β-SiC support is also shown. All profiles were scaled with respect to the sample amount and H2 flow to easily compare the samples in terms of H2 consumption. The low-intensity signal at about 720 °C in the case of bare β-SiC is due to the decomposition of residual OH groups not desorbed during the preceding oxidative catalyst treatment at 600 °C for 1 h. As the intensity of the H2O signal in H2-TPR tests with the catalysts was significantly higher in comparison with the bare support, the below discussion is exclusively related to redox properties and distribution of supported MOx species.
Fig. 3 H2O concentration profiles (ratio of m/z = 18 to m/z = 40 (Ar)) for β-SiC-based catalysts with supported (a) VOx, (b) FeOx, (c) CuOx, or (d) MoOx species with site densities of 0.02 nm−2 (red), 0.15 nm−2 (light blue), and 0.34 nm−2 (dark blue). The profile for bare β-SiC is shown in (b) as a green line. The profiles are offset for clarity according to rising density.
As seen in Fig. 3, a single reduction peak above 600 °C is present in the H2-TPR profiles of all the samples with an apparent site density of 0.02 nm−2. This implies the existence of highly dispersed metal oxide species. The temperature of maximal hydrogen consumption (Tmax) was 760, 770, 775, and 771 °C for the catalysts with VOx, FeOx, CuOx, and MoOx, respectively. For higher loaded VOx/β-SiC and MoOx/β-SiC samples, the reduction profiles retained the features of their counterparts with the site density of 0.02 nm−2 thus indicating that the speciation of VOx or MoOx species does not depend on the density of the corresponding metal oxide between 0.02 and 0.34 nm−2.
In contrast to VOx/β-SiC and MoOx/β-SiC, an increase in the density in FeOx/β-SiC and CuOx/β-SiC resulted in significant alterations of the H2O profile. This is an indication for structural changes of supported MOx species. An additional shoulder at 670 °C is evident in the H2O profile of 0.15 FeOx/β-SiC. In the case of 0.15 CuOx/β-SiC, a second sharp reduction peak at ca. 420 °C became visible. For Fe or Cu-containing samples with the highest site density (0.34 nm−2), the changes in the H2O profiles became more pronounced. Additional reduction peaks at 380 and 560 °C are seen in the H2-TPR profiles of the FeOx/β-SiC system. The presence of different maxima of H2O evolution in H2-TPR tests is an indication of different metal oxide aggregation states. Arena et al.54 previously observed broadening of H2-TPR signals and the shift of Tmax to lower temperatures with increasing site densities from 0.018 to 0.135 nm−2 in an FeOx/SiO2 system. However, the Tmax of 680 °C reported in this study is ca. 90 K lower in comparison with our data. The difference may be caused by different interactions of supported FeOx species with SiO2 and β-SiC. For the present CuOx/β-SiC catalysts, the intensity of the reduction peak at 420 °C increased significantly and a shoulder at 660 °C became observable. The existence of two H2O peaks agrees with previous studies of low-loaded CuOx/SiO2 catalysts.61 In general, earlier TPR experiments with supported Cu-containing catalysts prove that reduction of CuOx species proceeds in up to three steps in a wide temperature range (230–800 °C) depending on the support, copper loading, preparation method and experimental conditions.61
Beside H2-TPR tests, EPR spectroscopy is also known to be a powerful technique to characterise the metal state in low-loaded supported catalysts, e.g., in ref. 41 for FeOx/SiO2 catalysts. The EPR spectra of FeOx/β-SiC catalysts (0.02, 0.15, and 0.34 Fe nm−2) as well as bare β-SiC are presented in Fig. 4. The EPR spectrum of the bare β-SiC support (cf. Fig. S3(a)†) is characterised by a very strong isotropic signal at g = 2.004 due to the presence of paramagnetic intrinsic defects (carbon vacancies).64
Fig. 4 EPR spectra (only low field range is shown) of the bare β-SiC support (green) and the FeOx/β-SiC catalysts and with different metal site densities (0.02 (red), 0.15 (light blue), and 0.34 (dark blue) nm−2) at 100 K.
A signal in the low field region (g = 4.275) is present in the spectrum of FeOx/β-SiC. It can be attributed to isolated Fe(iii) ions in rhombic or tetrahedral symmetry.68 Its intensity increased with increasing FeOx loading. No EPR signals characteristic for VOx, CuOx, or MoOx were identified in the spectra of the corresponding catalysts. The location and distribution of FeOx and MoOx species in 0.34 FeOx/β-SiC and 0.34 MoOx/β-SiC were further analysed by HAADF STEM (Fig. 5).

The contrast of the well aligned crystalline lattice visible in the right lower quarter of Fig. 5(a) is a feature of the β-SiC support and is not caused by the iron oxide lattice. Both samples exhibited white spots, some of which are marked by dashed circles for the sake of clarity. These spots represent iron (Fig. 5(a)) or molybdenum (Fig. 5(b)) oxides on the surface of β-SiC. The STEM images revealed that for the FeOx/β-SiC and MoOx/β-SiC samples, the site density of 0.34 nm−2 is far away from the monolayer coverage. In the case of 0.34 MoOx/β-SiC, a molybdenum-containing particle was proven by EDX (cf. inset in Fig. 5(b), MoLa = 2.29 keV, MoLb = 2.39 keV), while the concentration of iron in the FeOx/β-SiC sample was below the detection limit of EDX.
Effect of metal and its loading on the performance of MOx/β-SiC
Carbon oxides and formaldehyde were the main carbon-containing products detected upon methane oxidation between 550 and 650 °C. Methanol was formed in trace amounts. We shall start our discussion with the activity data, while the product selectivity will be discussed hereafter. The effect of the kind of active metal and its apparent surface density on the rate of methane conversion at different reaction temperatures is shown in Fig. 6. When comparing samples with the same metal surface density, the FeOx/β-SiC catalysts revealed the highest activity. It also increased with iron loading. A similar effect of vanadium loading on the rate was observed for VOx/β-SiC, while the strength of the positive effect was less pronounced for MoOx/β-SiC and CuOx/β-SiC. This should be related to the increasing degree of polymerisation of MoOx and CuOx with metal loading (Fig. 3).
Fig. 6 The rate of methane conversion at (a) 550 °C and (b) 650 °C over MOx/β-SiC catalysts (VOx ( ), FeOx ( ), CuOx ( ), and MoOx ( )) versus metal site density.
Selectivity–conversion relationships for formaldehyde obtained for all the catalysts at 650 °C are exemplarily shown in Fig. 7. The corresponding results for other temperatures are summarised in Fig. S4 and S5.† Regardless of the reaction temperature and the kind of active species, the selectivity to formaldehyde decreased with methane conversion as a consequence of formaldehyde oxidation to carbon oxides. The selectivity, however, increased with reaction temperatures. The positive effect of temperature can be explained by the different activation energies of formaldehyde formation and undesired oxidation. The former reaction seems to proceed with higher activation energy than the latter.

As seen in Fig. 7, S4, and S5,† there are differences between the active metals and particularly their loading with respect to formaldehyde selectivity. For the catalysts with highly dispersed MOx species, i.e. with the site density of 0.02 nm−2, the metals can be ordered in terms of the desired selectivity as follows Cu ≤ Fe ≈ Mo ≈ V (Fig. 7(a), S4(a) and S5(a)†). The difference between the metals becomes larger with the increase in metal loading (Fig. 7(b and c), S4(b and c) and S5(b and c)†). The CuOx/β-SiC materials showed the lowest selectivity followed by the FeOx/β-SiC catalysts, while the VOx/β-SiC and MoOx/β-SiC catalysts revealed higher selectivity and did not significantly differ from each other. When comparing these catalytic data with the results of catalyst characterisation (Fig. 3), it becomes obvious that the effect of the metal on the selectivity to formaldehyde over the catalysts with the site density of 0.15 or 0.34 nm−2 should be due to the different speciation of MOx species, with the polymerised ones having lower selectivity than the isolated MOx species regardless of the kind of active metal (Fig. 7(a), S4(a) and S5(a)†). The negative effect of the polymerisation degree of MOx can be related to the fact that oligomerised species favour formaldehyde oxidation to carbon oxides due to the high concentration ratio of lattice oxygen to adsorbed formaldehyde. A similar conclusion has been drawn in previous studies of methane oxidation over FeOx/SiO2 catalysts.51,57 A further explanation is presented below.
Fundamental relationships for selective methane oxidation
For deriving fundamental insights into the effect of the kind of active MOx species, we determined the apparent activation energy of methane conversion (Ea(CH4)) from the Arrhenius plots obtained for each catalyst between 550 and 650 °C (Fig. S6†). The lowest values were determined for CuOx/β-SiC (Fig. S7†). Moreover, Ea decreased with the increase in Cu loading. A similar effect was determined for FeOx/β-SiC. In contrast, the Ea values for MoOx/β-SiC passed over a maximum at the site density of 0.15 nm−2 but slightly increased for VOx/β-SiC. In general, methane activation over these two catalysts required higher activation energy than that over CuOx/β-SiC and FeOx/β-SiC with an exception for 0.02 FeOx/β-SiC requiring a higher activation energy than similarly loaded samples with CuOx, VOx, or MoOx (Fig. S7†). We also determined the apparent activation energy of CH2O formation (Ea(CH2O)). A linear relationship between the activation energies of the methane conversion and formaldehyde selectivity was obtained (Fig. S8†). Such dependence suggests that the C–H bond activation in CH4 is the rate-limiting step in formaldehyde formation.
To elucidate the role of the active metal in the mechanism of methane oxidation to formaldehyde, we established a correlation between the electronegativity (EN) of the active metal and the activation energy of methane conversion (cf.Fig. 8(a)) and the formaldehyde selectivity (Fig. 8(b) and S10†). We used the Allen EN scale, which was determined spectroscopically and applied successfully for the prediction of element periodic properties like the type of bonding (covalent, ionic, and metallic), atomic radii, and oxidation numbers.69 As seen in Fig. 8(a), the higher the EN value of the active metal, the lower the activation energy of methane conversion. This behaviour resembles the ability of the tested metal oxides to release their lattice oxygen upon H2-TPR. Likewise, this metal oxide property was previously determined as a descriptor for explaining the effect of the kind of metal oxide for C–H bond activation in the course of the oxidative coupling of methane.70
Fig. 8 Apparent activation energy of (a) methane conversion and (b) CH2O selectivity at 650 °C over MOx/β-SiC catalysts (VOx, FeOx, CuOx, and MoOx) with different metal surface densities (0.02 ( ), 0.15 ( ), and 0.34 nm−2 ( )) as a function of the metal electronegativity according to the Allen scale.
As seen in Fig. 8(b) and S10,† the selectivity to formaldehyde decreases with the EN value of the active metal. Metals with lower EN, i.e., with lower electron-attracting power like Mo (1.47) and V (1.53), favour the target reaction. Importantly, such a correlation is valid for all temperatures and different surface densities of supported metal oxides. Under this consideration, it is also worth mentioning that an increase in surface metal density results in a decrease in the desired selectivity (Fig. 8(b)). The effect of EN and surface density of supported metal on formaldehyde selectivity can be understood when considering the results of structure–activity analysis for the oxidative propane dehydrogenation over MoOx/Al2O3 catalysts with a wide range of Mo surface densities (0.4–12 Mo nm−2).64,71 An increase in the propane conversion rate was observed with increasing surface density and decreasing edge energy of MoOx species. This effect was explained by the increased ability of larger domains to accept electrons and to stabilise transition states with lower band gap energies required in the metal reduction step according to the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism. In addition to the structure of supported MOx species, the electronegativity of the metal determines the electronic properties and the kinetics of reduced MOx species to be reoxidised by gas-phase O2 and accordingly the steady-state catalyst reduction degree. As demonstrated in our previous study72 on oxidative propane dehydrogenation over VOx/support catalysts, the higher the reduction degree is, the higher the selectivity to propene can be achieved. Thus, this kinetic concept and the electron density concept applied in ref. 65 correspond with the effect of EN on formaldehyde selectivity established in the present study. Recently, in ref. 73 EN was established successfully as a descriptor for the physicochemical property oxygen storage capacity of perovskites which emphasises the generality and usefulness of EN-based approaches for understanding the fundamentals of heterogeneous reactions.
We also established a correlation between the activation energy of methane conversion and the selectivity to formaldehyde. Fig. 9 shows the correlation for the selectivity data determined over all the catalysts at 650 °C, while the corresponding data at 600 °C are given in Fig. S9.† It is seen that the higher the Ea value, the higher the obtained selectivity to formaldehyde. Importantly, the selectivity values for different materials were determined at a close degree of methane conversion. This correlation suggests that catalysts strongly reducing the barrier for C–H bond activation in CH4 favour COx formation. This can be rationalised when considering the mechanism of C–H bond activation upon alkane oxidation on reducible metal oxides, where lattice oxygen is required for this reaction step.

Conclusions
A mathematical approach composed of statistical analysis of available literature data was developed and applied with the purpose of identifying catalyst properties relevant for the selective oxidation of methane to formaldehyde. In comparison with the empirical methodology still dominating currently in catalyst development, this approach is advantageous in the sense of discovering the relationships between the catalyst composition and performance owing to the analysis of a large number of experimental data without any restrictions. Therefore, it has potential to be established as a more general methodology for catalyst “discovery” and design.
Supports were concluded to be important for achieving high formaldehyde selectivity, as they contribute to undesired total oxidation of methane and formaldehyde. Bare β-SiC was identified to be less active and selective towards carbon oxides in comparison with often used SiO2. On the basis of catalytic tests with MOx/β-SiC (M = V, Fe, Cu or Mo), theoretical conclusions about the effects of the kind of metal in MOx and their speciation were experimentally validated. Thus, for catalyst design, it is important to prepare isolated species on the surface of the inert support. The species should also be hardly reducible and have lower electron-attracting power to minimise formation of carbon oxides. The electronegativity of the active metal has been established as an appropriate descriptor for methane activation and formaldehyde selectivity.
