Dehydrogenation of propane over a hydrothermal-synthesized Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalyst in the presence of carbon dioxide†
The hydrothermal synthesis method was adopted to prepare a highly active Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalyst (GA-HS), which displayed superior catalytic performance for dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2). The highest propane conversion on GA-HS was 35.2%, which was much higher than that from the catalysts prepared using the grind-mixture method (8.7%) or coprecipitation method (26.2%). Moreover, propylene selectivity over the GA-HS catalyst was higher than that over the other catalysts in a period of 9 h of reaction. These catalysts were characterized by N2 physical adsorption, ICP-AES, XRD, TGA, TEM, SEM, DRIFT, Py-FTIR, NH3-TPD, XPS, 27Al MAS NMR and 71Ga MAS NMR techniques. The characterization data indicated that the hydrothermal treatment increased the surface area, expanded the pore size and promoted the formation of more tetrahedral Ga ions and the generation of more medium-strong Lewis acid sites. Furthermore, this catalyst mainly displayed an amorphous sponge-like morphology as well as a new morphology whereby some pieces were covered with amorphous nanoparticles. The superior activity of GA-HS was attributed to the higher surface area of this catalyst and the larger amount of tetrahedral Ga ions (Ga3+ and probably Gaδ+δ < 2) related to the medium-strong Lewis acid sites.
1. Introduction
At present, there is an urgent demand for propylene, which has drawn the attention of academic and industrial sectors to deeply investigating the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, as this represents a way in which more expensive alkenes can be produced economically from low-cost saturated hydrocarbons.1,2 However, the dehydrogenation of propane has inherent disadvantages such as thermodynamic limitations for propane conversion, high energy requirements ascribed to the endothermic reaction and limited catalytic stability in virtue of coke formation.3,4 Recently, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen as an alternative process for propylene production has offered a new promising technology in terms of its energy-saving. By using oxygen as an oxidant, the dehydrogenation can proceed well, but a dramatic decrease of propylene selectivity due to excessive propane oxidation is still a problem.2 Considering this, CO2, as a mild oxidant, is being used in attempts to develop a safer and more economical process for propane dehydrogenation.5–7 With the introduction of CO2, the dehydrogenation efficiency is increased because of the new additional production process of propylene: a direct surface redox mechanism in which the catalyst undergoes reduction (by propane) and reoxidation (by carbon dioxide) cycles8–10 or a more complex reaction pathway involving a simple dehydrogenation followed by the reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction.11–13
Ga2O3-containing catalysts have been considered for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation processes due to their relatively good catalytic performance.14–34 This was verified by Nakagawa et al.35 According to their results, commercial Ga2O3 showed a higher activity in the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 compared with Cr2O3 and V2O5 catalysts. Zheng et al.36 investigated the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 (DHP-CO2) over four polymorphs of gallium oxides. They supposed that the superior performance of the β-Ga2O3 catalyst was ascribed to an abundance of surface medium-strong Lewis acid sites related to the unsaturated Ga3+ cations and the conjugation effect of the proton and oxide. The optimal propane conversion and propylene selectivity that could be achieved were 23% and 95%, respectively, at 500 °C with the feed gas mixture CO2/C3H8 (molar ratio = 2 : 1) and at a flow rate of 3 L g−1 h−1. Based on this, supported-gallium oxide catalysts (Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3, Ga2O3/SiO2, Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/MgO) were also used for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with CO2 by Bingjun Xu et al.37 It was found that Ga2O3/TiO2, Ga2O3/Al2O3 and Ga2O3/ZrO2 showed a stronger ability for the dehydrogenation of propane than Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO, due to the abundant medium-strong Lewis acid sites on these catalysts' surface and the special interactions between the support and Ga2O3. Ga2O3/TiO2 showed the highest activity, and a high propane conversion over this catalyst of 39% was achieved at 600 °C with the feed gas mixture CO2/C3H8 (molar ratio = 2 : 1) and at a flow rate of 6 L g−1 h−1. Michorczyk et al.30 prepared ordered mesoporous Ga2O3 and Ga2O3–Al2O3 by nanocasting, which were used as effective catalysts for DHP-CO2. The results revealed that the pure mesoporous gallium and gallium–aluminium oxides (Ga/Al = 4 : 1) exhibited promising catalytic performance in the DHP-CO2. Over the most active materials, propylene was produced with yields of 10–18% and high selectivities of 91–95% during 4 h on stream at 550 °C with the feed gas mixture CO2/C3H8 (molar ratio = 5 : 1) and at a flow rate of 9 L g−1 h−1. Moreover, Chen et al.11,12 studied the effects of the preparation method and treatment process on the activity and stability of Ga2O3-containing catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane. The results suggested that a larger number of surface Ga3+ sites with weak Lewis acidity were presented on a gallia–alumina solid solution prepared using a coprecipitation method than that on Ga2O3–Al2O3 oxide catalysts prepared using the physical mixture method, thereby leading to its better performance in propane dehydrogenation with CO2. It was found that the initial conversion of propane and the selectivity of propylene over Ga8Al2O15 were 49.7% and 91.7%, respectively, at 500 °C with the feed gas mixture CO2/C3H8 (molar ratio = 2 : 1) and at a flow rate of 3 L g−1 h−1. To understand this reaction, many researchers36–38 drew their attention to investigating the influence of surface Ga3+ in the Ga2O3-containing catalysts on the dehydrogenation of propane. Their results suggest that hydrocarbon activation proceeded on low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, accordingly forming propyl-Ga species,36,37 and the dehydrogenation products were then generated via a subsequent decomposition of the resulting propyl-Ga species. In particular, the low-coordinated Ga3+ sites over gallium oxide were highly effective in the heterolytic dissociative adsorption of propane, because of the very strong polarizability of the C–H bonds, resulting from the perturbation of propane on the low-coordinated Ga3+ sites.39 It is obvious that more active catalysts for propane dehydrogenation can be obtained with a higher population of low-coordinated surface Ga3+ sites in the Ga2O3-containing catalysts.
In the present study, a facile hydrothermal synthesis method was adopted to prepare a Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalyst for DHP-CO2. The as-prepared catalyst displayed better catalytic performance than the catalysts prepared using the grind-mixture method or coprecipitation method. We rationalized the results in detail by various characterizations, such as N2 physical adsorption, ICP-AES, XRD, TEM, TGA, SEM, DRIFT, Py-FTIR, NH3-TPD, XPS, 27Al MAS NMR and 71Ga MAS NMR techniques, with an aim to unveil the correlations between the structure and physical properties of the Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalyst and its activity for propane dehydrogenation.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Catalyst preparation
Herein, Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts as well as the simple oxides of Ga2O3 and Al2O3 were prepared using different methods as follows.
Ga2O3 and Al2O3 were obtained from Ga(NO3)3 and Al(NO3)3, respectively, through the same treatment involving drying at 120 °C for 8 h in a constant temperature oven and subsequent calcinations at 550 °C for 5 h (from room temperature to 550 °C at a ramp rate of 3 °C min−1) under static air in a muffle oven.
In the grind-mixture method, 0.01 mol Ga(NO3)3 and 0.02 mol Al(NO3)3 (Ga/Al = 1 : 2), as the precursors, were first mixed and ground, followed by drying at 120 °C for 8 h in a constant temperature oven. The resulting mixture was heated to 550 °C from room temperature at a ramp rate of 3 °C min−1, and then kept for 5 h under static air in a muffle oven. The obtained catalyst was defined as GA-GM.
In the coprecipitation method, the Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalyst was prepared through an alcoholic coprecipitation pathway.40 In a typical synthesis, 0.01 mol Ga(NO3)3 and 0.02 mol Al(NO3)3 (Ga/Al = 1 : 2) were completely dissolved in 40 mL ethanol. Then, 40 mL concentrated aqueous ammonia (28 wt%) was added dropwise to the abovementioned ethanol solution. The resulting suspension was filtered and washed by ethanol. Afterwards, the cake was dried at 120 °C for 8 h in a constant temperature oven, followed by calcination at 550 °C for 5 h (from room temperature to 550 °C at a ramp rate of 3 °C min−1). The obtained catalyst was defined as GA-CP.
In the hydrothermal synthesis method, 0.01 mol Ga(NO3)3 and 0.02 mol Al(NO3)3 (Ga/Al = 1 : 2) were completely dissolved in 40 mL ethanol. Then, 40 mL concentrated aqueous ammonia (28 wt%) was added dropwise to the abovementioned ethanol solution. The resulting suspension was transferred into a 200 ml Teflon cup inserted in a stainless steel autoclave, then heated to 170 °C from room temperature at a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 and kept for 24 h. Afterwards, the crystalline product was washed repetitively with ethanol, followed by drying at 120 °C for 8 h in a constant temperature oven, and calcined at 550 °C for 5 h under static air similar to that carried out in the coprecipitation method. The obtained catalyst was defined as GA-HS.
Compared with GA-HS, pure Ga (G-HS) and Al (A-HS) were prepared using the hydrothermal synthesis method. Moreover, Ga2O3–Al2O3 materials with different Ga/Al molar ratios (1 : 1 and 2 : 1) were also prepared by the grind-mixture method, coprecipitation method and hydrothermal synthesis method, defined as G1A1-GM, G2A1-GM, G1A1-CP, G2A1-CP, G1A1-HS and G2A1-HS.
2.2 Catalyst characterization
The textural properties of the catalyst were measured by N2 physical sorption at 77 K using a Tristar 3000 machine. The surface areas were calculated by the BET method and the micro-, meso- and macropore volumes were calculated by the t-plot method.
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on a Rigaku MiniFlex II X-ray diffractometer using CuKα radiation. The anode was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The 2θ angles were scanned from 10° to 70°.
Diffuse reflectance infrared spectra (DRIFT) measurements were performed using a Bruker Tensor 27 instrument with an MCT detector (64 scans, 4 cm−1). 20 mg catalyst was placed in to an infrared cell with KBr windows for the in situ treatments. The DRIFT spectra were obtained after treating the catalyst at 300 °C for 1 h in a flow of argon.
Pyridine-adsorbed Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (Py-FTIR) was used to determine the number of Brønsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites using the Bruker Tensor 27 equipment. 20 mg of catalyst was pressed into a regular wafer (R = 1.3 cm) and then placed in an infrared cell. The infrared spectrum was obtained after sample treatment at 400 °C for 2 h under vacuum, wherein this spectrum was used as a background for the adsorbed pyridine experiments. Pyridine was then adsorbed with a 5.0 × 10−2 Pa equilibrium pressure at 40 °C. FTIR spectra were obtained after consecutive evacuation at 400 °C.
The temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was used to test the number and strength of the Lewis acid or Brønsted acid sites of the as-prepared catalysts in a TP-5080 chemisorption instrument. The catalyst (100 mg) was pre-treated at 500 °C under a flow of N2 (30 ml min−1) for 2 h and then cooled down to 100 °C. Then, NH3 was introduced in to the flow system. The TPD spectra were acquired after about 1 h evacuation time until the baseline of the TCD signal was steady at a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 from 100 °C to 600 °C.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyse the change of surface composition measured by an AXIS ULTRA DLD equipment. The binding energy values were corrected for the charging effect by referring to the adventitious C1s line at 284.5 eV.
The chemical compositions (Al and Ga) of the as-prepared samples were determined by the inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES) method using a Thermo iCAP 6300 equipment.
71Ga MAS NMR measurements were performed on Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz equipment. 71Ga MAS NMR spectra were obtained by a single pulse length of π/6, and the Ga chemical shifts were referenced to Ga(NO3)3.
27Al MAS NMR measurements were performed on Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz equipment. 27Al MAS NMR spectra were obtained by a single pulse length of π/6, and the Al chemical shifts were referenced to Al(NO3)3.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained for morphologic identification using a JSM-7001F.
The pulsed reaction technique was used to measure the activities of these catalysts carried out on a chemisorption instrument (TP-5080) and OMNI star. The transient responses of m/z = 44 (C3H8 and CO2) and m/z = 44, 43 (C3H8) over the as-prepared catalysts were tested by an online mass spectrometer against a pulsed introduction of C3H8 under a steady flow of the mixture gas: 10% CO2 and 90% Ar, with the reaction conditions: catalyst = 100 mg; CO2 and Ar carrier = 30 ml min−1; C3H8 = 1 ml; furnace temperature = 550 °C.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a Rigaku TG analyzer to determine the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst after the reaction. 10 mg of the sample was heated from room temperature to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in flowing air.
2.3 Catalyst evaluation
The catalyst test was carried out in a horizontal quartz tube fixed-bed reactor. The reaction conditions were T = 550 °C; P = 100 kPa; mcat. = 150 mg; the feed gas mixture was C3H8/CO2/N2 with the molar ratio of 1 : 3 : 27 and the total flow rate was 15 cm3 min−1.
The products were analysed by an offline gas chromatograph (HUAAI GC 9560) equipped with a FID with an Al2O3 packed column, and an offline gas chromatograph (East & West GC 4000A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) with a carbon molecular sieves packed column, respectively. The propane conversion and propylene selectivity were calculated using the following eqn (1) and (2).

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Catalyst test
The conversion of propane and the selectivity of propylene over these as-prepared samples as a function of time on stream are shown in Fig. 1. Compared with single Al2O3, the activity of Ga2O3-containing catalysts was remarkably superior for propane dehydrogenation (Fig. 1A), indicating that the presence of the Ga species is necessary to generate active sites for propane dehydrogenation.35 Especially on GA-HS, the initial propane conversion was the highest (35.2%), which is much higher than that on Ga2O3 (5.7%), GA-GM (8.7%) and GA-CP (26.2%). From Fig. 1B, it is noticeable that propylene selectivity over these Ga2O3-containing catalysts achieved about 95.0%, which was obviously higher than that on single Al2O3 (only 73.2%). Propylene selectivity over Ga2O3 and GA-GM decreased by 13.7% and 26.5%, respectively, after 9 h reaction, while that over GA-HS and GA-CP almost remained unchanged during the running period accompanied by the decline in propane conversion. Seemingly, propylene selectivity over GA-HS was slightly higher than that over GA-CP. These test results suggest that the activities of Ga2O3-containing catalysts are strongly affected by the preparation method and treatment process. Moreover, our adopted hydrothermal synthesis method was remarkably favourable for preparing catalysts for the efficient dehydrogenation of propane, in comparison with the grind-mixture method or coprecipitation method. In addition, pure Ga2O3 (G-HS) and Al2O3 (A-HS) were prepared using the hydrothermal synthesis method and compared with GA-HS. The initial propane conversions on G-HS and A-HS were 21.4% and 0.8% (Fig. S1a†), respectively, much lower than that on GA-HS, implying that a single Ga2O3 or Al2O3 component is indifferent for propane dehydrogenation but their synergistic effect has an active effect due to them forming a special structure. Moreover, the rapid decreases of propylene selectivity on G-HS and A-HS (Fig. S1b†) are seen with increase of time on stream in comparison with GA-HS. Moreover, Ga2O3–Al2O3 materials with different Ga/Al molar ratios (1 : 1 and 2 : 1) were also investigated. From the evaluation results of these catalysts, it was found that the conversions of propane on the Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts were enhanced with the increase in the Ga/Al molar ratio (Fig. S1a†). The Ga2O3–Al2O3 prepared using the hydrothermal synthesis method still showed a superior activity for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 compared to those catalysts prepared using the grind-mixture method or coprecipitation method with the same Ga/Al molar ratio. Propylene selectivity over the hydrothermally prepared catalyst achieved about 95.0% during the whole test period, similar to the coprecipitated-prepared catalyst (Fig. S1b†), but higher than that over the catalyst prepared by the grind-mixture method.

In order to study the effect of CO2 on this reaction, catalytic tests without CO2 were performed over these Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts for comparison (Fig. S2 and Table S1†). The initial conversions of propane on these Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts without CO2 were higher than that with CO2, indicating that the presence of carbon dioxide is not positive to promote the dehydrogenation of propane as expected. Xu et al.37 considered that the negative effect could be attributed to the greatly reduced propane adsorption capacity due to the competition of CO2. However, compared with the catalytic tests in the presence of CO2, a rapid deactivation of these Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts in the absence of CO2 was observed. Moreover, propane conversions on these Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts tested in the presence of CO2 were higher than that in the absence of CO2 after 9 h on stream. This may indicate that the presence of CO2 is beneficial for improving the durability of the catalysts. The enhanced stability of these Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of CO2 may be due to their low coking tendency.12 In addition, the primary product (propylene) and the by-products (methane, ethylene, and ethane) are formed during the dehydrogenation process of propane regardless of the presence of CO2. However, it is worth noting that the selectivity to by-products over these Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts in the presence of CO2 is lower than that in the absence of CO2. It is thought that CO2, as a mild oxidant, can promote the dehydrogenation of propane preferentially and slightly weaken the cracking and hydrocracking reactions, thereby increasing the selectivity of the target product propylene compared with the situation in the absence of CO2. With the observation of a higher conversion of CO2 and a lower molar ratio H2/CO over GA-HS (Table S1†), it can be further confirmed that GA-HS has a superior activity to GA-GM and GA-CP in the present reaction. The catalytic tests of GA-HS after regeneration with air or CO2 were performed (Fig. S3†). The comparative results of the regeneration with O2 and CO2 indicate that both agents are effective in removing coke. However, propane conversion and propylene selectivity on regenerated GA-HS with CO2 after 9 h reaction on stream were much lower than that with air, implying that CO2 can partly remove the coke through the Boudouard reaction.37
Considering the differences between the test conditions (such as reaction temperature, GHSV and CO2/C3H8 molar ratio of feed gas mixture), it is difficult to make a definitive conclusion about which preparation method is more preferential by comparing the activities of the Ga2O3-containing catalysts prepared by different researchers. However, it is widely accepted that the presence of Lewis acid sites related to Ga3+ ions in tetrahedral sites, which is obtained through a special treatment process such as hydrothermal synthesis, is favourable for propane dehydrogenation. However, propane conversion and propylene selectivity over GA-HS are higher than that over these catalysts prepared using the grind-mixture method or coprecipitation method under the same test conditions, indicating that hydrothermal synthesis can greatly improve the activity of Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts. In the present study, we focus on the effects of the preparation method on the activity of Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts for DHP-CO2.
Propane conversions over these Ga2O3-containing samples decrease as a function of reaction time. It is thought that this gradual deactivation of the catalysts is caused by the coke deposition on the surface of these catalysts.25,36 Based on this, coke deposition on the spent Ga-containing samples was quantified by TG-DTA, as shown in Fig. 2A. The weight loss of these spent samples decreases in the order: GA-HS > GA-CP > GA-GM > Ga2O3. Spent GA-HS displays maximum weight loss compared with the Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts prepared using the grind-mixture method or coprecipitation method, demonstrating its high coke performance. Published work19,30 reported that the high catalytic performance of Ga-containing materials can be attributed to the surface gallium sites with Lewis acidity, which are also the coke deposition sites. For the present catalysts, GA-HS should possess more Lewis acid sites than the others based on its relatively good performance (as shown in Fig. 1A). This implies that there are more coke deposition sites on GA-HS. Moreover, the initial conversion of propane (Fig. S2†) and the initial selectivity of propylene (Table S1†) over these Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts in the absence of CO2 are much higher. This result suggests that the concentration of propylene in the absence of CO2 in the initial step is also high. Because propylene is more reactive than propane, its higher concentration in the reaction zone probably leads to a higher coke amount, which also contributes to faster deactivation of the catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane in terms of the substrates-products reactivity.17,30 Thus, coke is easily formed on the GA-HS catalyst during the DHP-CO2 process due to its high activity. In addition, coke also has significant effects on the durability of these catalysts. From our observations, propane conversion decreases dramatically with the increase of time on stream. In addition, DTA profiles of the spent Ga-containing catalysts (Fig. 2B) show that both spent GA-GM and spent Ga2O3 only display one peak at 460 °C and 426 °C, respectively, corresponding to one type of carbon species. However, the spent GA-CP shows two peaks at 454 °C and 479 °C, assigned to two different types of carbon species. Spent GA-HS displays a similar DTA profile to the spent GA-CP, but with higher amounts of carbon species. Nevertheless, further study is required to understand the details about the mechanism of formation of the different carbon species.

3.2 Catalyst composition and textural properties
The pore volume, pore size and BET surface areas (SBET) of the different catalysts were obtained based on sorption isotherms of N2 condensation at 77 K. N2-sorption isotherms of these catalysts (Fig. S4†) are a type IV with a steep increase around P/P0 = 0.4, indicating that these samples belong to typical mesoporous materials.41,42 From the profiles of the pore size distributions in Fig. 3, it can be seen that GA-GM and GA-CP have a very narrow pore size distribution with average pore diameters of 7.6 nm and 7.9 nm, respectively, while GA-HS has a broad pore size distribution with an average pore diameter of 12.5 nm. This suggests that a special pore structure can be produced after the hydrothermal treatment. The BET surface area and total volumes of the catalysts were calculated and the results are shown in Table 1. The BET surface area and total volumes of GA-HS were 234 m2 g−1 and 0.730 cm3 g−1, respectively, higher than that of GA-GM, GA-CP, pure Ga2O3 and pure Al2O3. In combination with the abovementioned test results, it is thought that active Ga species can be more easily dipersed on GA-HS due to its higher BET surface and volumes than that of GA-GM and GA-CP, thereby leading to its good performance. Moreover, the higher micropore surface area and micropore volumes of GA-CP than that of GA-HS and GA-GM means that using the coprecipitation method can lead to the preferential formation of micropores over GA-CP than over other catalysts. Based on the larger number of meso- and macropores in GA-HS than in GA-CP and GA-GM, the conclusion can be made that hydrothermal synthesis promotes the formation of meso- and macropores over the Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalyst, but the coprecipitation method is in favour of the formation of micropores.

To clarify the thermal stability of the catalyst prepared by the hydrothermal method, the textural properties of the samples after the DHP-CO2 test and regeneration with air were characterized by low N2 adsorption and the data are listed in Table 2. Compared with the fresh samples, the spent GA-CP and spent GA-HS both show an obvious decrease in the SBET (decrease by 96.2 m2 g−1 and 74.0 m2 g−1) and pore volume (decrease by 0.297 m3 g−1 and 0.543 m3 g−1), respectively, whereas the spent GA-GM shows some increase in the SBET and pore volume (increase by 33.1 m2 g−1 and 0.014 m3 g−1) due to the cumuli of coke deposition. After regeneration with air, the pores of these spent Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts were recovered partly. Herein, the regenerated GA-HS still showed the highest SBET and pore volume among the regenerated samples, indicating that the hydrothermal synthesis method is superior to the other preparation methods in this study.

Fig. 4 illustrates the XRD patterns of these Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts, along with simple Ga2O3 and Al2O3. The diffraction lines of the as-prepared samples are very broad, demonstrating a low crystallinity of all the samples. This low crystallinity is a common feature of the metastable γ-variety of both alumina and gallia polymorphs.12 The as-prepared Ga2O3 reveals the typical characteristics of γ-Ga2O3, as inferred from the 2θ angles (30.8°, 36.2° and 64.2° in curve a) of the diffraction peak, while simple Al2O3 suggests the typical characteristics of γ-Al2O3 based on the 2θ angles (45.4°, 60.3° and 67.1° in curve e) of the diffraction peak. GA-GM closely resembles γ-Ga2O3 and γ-Al2O3 in light of the diffraction maxima (curve b), indicating that no new structures were formed in the physical mixture process. However, GA-CP and GA-HS do not exhibit typical characteristics of simple γ-Ga2O3 and/or γ-Al2O3 unlike GA-GM. Herein, d(440) spacing, which corresponds to the cubic lattice parameter a0, can be used to distinguish the cubic spinel-type structure (gallia–alumina solid solution) by the location of the (440) peak.40 It can be seen that the (440) peaks of γ-Ga2O3 and γ-Al2O3 are located at 64.2° and 67.1°, respectively. The (440) peaks of GA-CP and GA-HS lie between that of γ-Ga2O3 and γ-Al2O3, indicating that cubic spinel-type structures are formed on GA-CP and GA-HS.43 In comparison with GA-CP, the (440) peak of GA-HS shifts to a higher 2θ angle due to the preparation method. This suggests that different structures are present on GA-CP and GA-HS despite the presence of similar cubic spinel-type structures on these two catalysts, which results in their activity differences for propane dehydrogenation.

3.3 Coordination state and oxidation state of Ga
To reflect the coordination state of the Ga3+ ion, 71Ga MAS NMR chemical shift measurements were conducted and the spectra of different catalysts are shown in Fig. 5. The two asymmetric bands within the range from −100 ppm to ∼300 ppm are assigned to tetrahedral Ga (GaT) ions and octahedral Ga (GaO) ions, respectively.14,40,44–46 Peak deconvolutions of the NMR GaT and GaO bands were also done to provide more information about the Ga distribution (among tetrahedral and octahedral sites) in the structure of these catalysts. The deconvoluted results in Table 3 suggest that most of Ga ions in GA-GM and Ga2O3 occupy octahedral GaO sites, while those in GA-CP and GA-HS are mainly located at tetrahedral GaT sites. In particular, for GA-HS, the GaT ions percent achieves 85.5%. This indicates that the hydrothermal synthesis method promotes the formation of tetrahedral GaT ions. Moreover, the content of total GaT ions was also calculated in combination with the bulk content of Ga obtained by ICP-AES. The results show that the content of total GaT ions of GA-HS is higher than for GA-GM and GA-CP. Already published research36,37 indicated that the low-coordinated GaT cations contributed to the activity of Ga2O3-containing catalysts for DHP-CO2. This is consistent with our results that the content of GaT cations has a positive relationship with the activity of Ga2O3-containing catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Propane can heterolytically dissociate on low-coordinated surface Ga3+ sites in gallium oxide, forming gallium hydride and gallium alkoxide species, as shown in step (3), and the alkoxides then decompose further to the dehydrogenation products, as shown in steps (4) and (5) as follows:

It is apparent as the low-coordinated surface Ga3+ sites obtained in the Ga2O3-containing catalysts increases, their catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation increases. Moreover, the coordination state of the Al3+ ion was also investigated by 27Al MAS NMR, and the results are shown in Fig. S5† and the percentage of Al3+ ions is listed in Table S2.† The results suggest that the percentage of Al3+ ion in GA-HS is higher than that in GA-GM and GA-CP, indicating that hydrothermal synthesis promotes the formation of more tetrahedral AlT ions as well as tetrahedral GaT ions.
XPS is an effective technique to characterize the surface situation of catalysts.47–52 The oxidation states and the quantity of the elements that are present within the top 1–12 nm of the sample surface can be obtained by this technique. The surface Ga/Al ratios measured by XPS and the bulk Ga/Al ratios determined by ICP-AES are shown in Table 3. The surface Ga/Al ratio of GA-GM is lower than the bulk Ga/Al ratio, while the surface Ga/Al ratios of GA-CP and GA-HS are higher than their bulk Ga/Al ratios. This indicates that the coprecipitation synthesis and hydrothermal synthesis could make more Ga species be exposed on the surface of Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts. This was also verified by the SEM-EDS results (Fig. S6†), which showed that the surfaces of GA-CP and GA-HS are remarkably enriched in Ga, compared with GA-GM. The Ga 3d and Ga 2p1/2 XPS spectra of these catalysts are displayed in Fig. 6. From the deconvoluted spectra on the Ga 3d region (Fig. 6A), it can be observed that only two peaks appear in the spectra of GA-GM and GA-CP at about 24.1 and 20.6 eV, respectively, which can be assigned to the O2s and Ga3+ 3d bands.53 As for GA-HS, a new and additional low-energy peak at 19.6 eV is found, which can be attributed to the presence of Gaδ+ species (δ < 2),21,54 suggesting that the reduced Ga species are probably generated by the hydrothermal synthesis. This can be further verified by the Ga 2p1/2 XPS spectra (Fig. 6B). It can be observed that the GA-CP and GA-GM only show one oxidation state and that the Ga 2p1/2 binding energy (BE) value for GA-CP (1144.6 eV) is higher than that for GA-GM (1144.2 eV), while GA-HS shows two oxidation states (1144.2 eV and 1147.9 eV, respectively). It can be deduced that the other Ga oxidation state (1147.9 eV) ascribed to the Gaδ+ species was also probably formed on GA-HS, due to the surface enrichment of Ga species and the generation of more low-coordinated GaT species by hydrothermal treatment. The dehydrogenation of propane over reducible metal oxide catalysts, such as chromium and iron oxides, in the presence of CO2 has been suggested to follow a redox mechanism.55 Propane is oxidized to propylene with the simultaneous reduction of metal oxide (e.g. Fe2O3, Cr2O3), and subsequently the reduced metal oxide catalyst is reoxidized by CO2. According to the above results, Gaδ+ species (δ < 2) exist in our prepared GA-HS and the mentioned redox mechanism is probably applicable for the present catalyst system. However, compared with the fresh catalyst, the spent GA-HS with or without CO2 (Fig. S7A†) shows two binding energy peaks in the Ga 3d XPS spectra at about 24.1 eV and 20.8 eV, which can be assigned to the O2s and Ga3+ 3d bands, respectively, and yet the original low-energy peak at 19.6 eV attributed to the presence of Gaδ+ species (δ < 2) disappears. It can be deduced that these Gaδ+ species have likely been converted into Ga3+ species. This can be also further verified by the disappearance of the binding energy peak at 1147.9 eV (ascribed to the Ga oxidation state) in the Ga 2p1/2 XPS spectra (Fig. S7B†) after reaction with or without CO2. Compared with fresh GA-HS, the oxidation states in the spent GA-HS with CO2 are similar to the case without CO2, implying that the redox mechanism in which CO2 is used as an oxidant is not available for the present catalyst. However, CO2 still plays a positive role in the enhancement of dehydrogenation activity through the reverse water-gas shift reaction and by the elimination of coke by the Boudouard reaction.37 The reduced gallium ions (Gaδ+ species δ < 2) are also thought to have high dehydrogenation efficiency. The gallium–hydrogen bond can be formed on these reduced gallium ions by heterolytic hydrogen dissociation and can then be stabilized on the support surface.21 Therefore, dehydrogenation proceeds on the supported gallium oxide catalysts probably through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway instead of a redox mechanism. It should be pointed out that further work needs to be done to clarify the mechanism of conversion of Gaδ+ species (δ < 2) to Ga3+ species with and without CO2.

3.4 Morphologies of the as-prepared samples
In order to reveal the morphologies of these as-prepared samples, TEM is applied and the results are shown in Fig. 7. Al2O3 shows smooth pieces (Fig. 7a), while Ga2O3 takes on an irregular and segregated morphology (Fig. 7b). GA-GM, as shown in Fig. 7c, mainly contains two types of morphologies. It is thought that they are ascribed to Ga2O3 and Al2O3, respectively, in combination with Fig. 7a and b. While GA-CP (Fig. 7d) just exhibits a unified distinct sponge-like morphology probably ascribed to the gallia–alumina solid solution (cubic spinel-type structure), it can be inferred from the XRD results that gallia–alumina solid solution (cubic spinel-type structure) is generated. In the case of GA-HS, in addition to an amorphous sponge-like morphology such as GA-CP, as shown in Fig. 7d, an additional morphology (Fig. 7e) whereby some pieces are covered with amorphous nanoparticles is also seen. Furthermore, some amorphous nanoparticles can embed into these pieces (Fig. 7f). It is easily understandable that the distinct multiple morphologies of these samples are ascribed to their different structures, which are determined by the preparation method and treatment process.

3.5 Acidity of the catalysts
A comparison of the DRIFT spectra in the OH stretching region for the as-prepared samples is showed in Fig. 8. The stretching band of the Ga–OH groups for Ga2O3 and Al–OH for Al2O3 is located at 3650 cm−1 and 3716 cm−1, respectively. As for GA-GM, no stretching bands of Al–OH groups or Ga–OH groups are observed, instead only a broad region, probably because of the formation of a disordered mixture between Al2O3 and Ga2O3. GA-CP and GA-HS both show a new stretching band of a special group at about 3683 cm−1, which can be assigned to Ga–OH or Al–OH in the cubic spinel-type structure. The appearance of the new OH group somewhat affects the acidity of the catalyst. Based on this, the distribution of acidity on these different catalysts was measured by NH3-TPD and the profiles are shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen that there is only one NH3 desorption peak over these catalysts. The desorption peak on GA-HS shows an obvious shift to higher temperature (315 °C) in comparison with that on GA-GM (284 °C) and GA-CP (303 °C), meaning that the acidity strength of the GA-HS is enhanced facilely via the hydrothermal synthesis, and medium-strong acid sites are generated on the catalyst accordingly. Moreover, the increased number of acid sites over GA-HS, in comparison with GA-CP and GA-GM (Table 3), implies that the hydrothermal synthesis promotes the formation of medium-strong acid sites. It has been proven that the dehydrogenation of propane proceeded mainly on the Lewis acid sites related to the low-coordinated Ga3+ ions on Ga2O3-containing catalysts, which intensively affected their activities for the dehydrogenation of propane.12,56 It is plausible that the large number of Lewis acid sites over GA-HS plays a key role in improving the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation.

Apart from the acidity number and acidity strength of the active sites over these catalysts, the acidity type also contributes to their catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation. Based on this, FTIR spectra of pyridine adsorption on different catalysts were obtained to identify the Brønsted acid sites and Lewis acid sites, and the results are shown in Fig. 10. Two peaks, at 1458 cm−1 and 1620 cm−1, respectively, appear over all these catalysts, which were assigned to Lewis acid sites,44,57i.e., only Lewis acid sites exist on these Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts. In view of the NH3-TPD profiles, it can be deduced that the desorbed NH3 arises from Lewis acid sites. Moreover, these Lewis acid sites are related to coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ ions in the tetrahedral position.57 It is apparent that GA-HS possesses more Ga3+ ions in the tetrahedral sites than GA-GM and GA-CP because of the greater number of Lewis acid sites on GA-HS inferred from the NH3-TPD, thereby showing its better catalytic performance. This result is consistent with the NMR results.

Chen et al.11,12 reported that surface acidity (specifically the Lewis acid sites density of surface) on the Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts is crucial to obtaining high activity and stability in propane dehydrogenation. In this case, the surface acidity is attributed to the surface tetrahedral Ga3+ ions. Therefore, the investigation of the surface tetrahedral Ga3+ sites is helpful to understand propane dehydrogenation in depth. As proposed, propane activation first proceeds on these low-coordinated Ga3+ cations, forming propyl-Ga species, and then the dehydrogenation products are generated by a subsequent decomposition of the resulting propyl-Ga species. In our study, a positive correlation between the number of Ga species in the tetrahedral sites and the number of surface Lewis acid sites on GA-HS further verifies the previous study.12
3.6 Pulsed reaction
To gain more insights into the mechanism of DHP-CO2 over the different catalysts, a pulsed reaction technique was used to measure the activities of these catalysts.13 The transient responses over the as-prepared catalysts against a pulsed introduction of C3H8 at 550 °C under a steady flow of mixture gas (10% CO2 and 90% Ar) were tested by an online mass spectrometer as well as by contrast tests, and the results are shown in Fig. 11. When C3H8 was introduced in a pulse under a steady flow of pure Ar, similar narrow and positive peaks with the transient response of m/z = 44 (C3H8) over all these catalysts (Fig. S8†) could be seen. Moreover, the transient response of m/z = 43 determined as C3H8 could also be noticed.58,59 When the steady flow was introduced with 10% CO2, the peak responses of m/z = 43 and m/z = 44 over these catalysts were clearly different. The transient response of m/z = 43 over GA-GM, GA-CP and GA-HS was all similar and presented as narrow peaks (Fig. S9†), suggesting that C3H8 was detected over these catalysts. In case of the responses of m/z = 44 over GA-HS, the inverted peaks apparently indicate that the introduced C3H8 and CO2 had been greatly consumed (Fig. 11c), whereas the narrow and positive peaks of GA-CP imply that a remarkable amount of C3H8 feedstock is still reserved (Fig. 11b). The largest broad and positive peaks of the transient response (m/z = 44) over GA-GM (Fig. 11a) indicate the weak conversion of C3H8. Conclusively, the abovementioned results suggest that the activity of GA-HS for DHP-CO2 is higher than the activity over other catalysts, which agrees with the previous test results.

Reported study60–63 has shown that the hydrothermal conditions (generated self-pressure, hydrothermal temperature and time) have great influence on the crystallization and formation process of catalysts. In this study, the characterization data suggested that the hydrothermal conditions, such as generated self-pressure, hydrothermal temperature and time (170 °C for 24 h), played significant roles in improving the dispersion and distribution of the surface gallium sites. Through the hydrothermal process, more tetrahedral Ga3+ sites were exposed on the surface of GA-HS, thus contributing to the formation of surface Lewis acid sites. Moreover, this hydrothermal treatment was also favourable for improving the surface area and increasing the pore volume of the catalyst. The superior structure and physical properties obtained by hydrothermal synthesis ultimately result in the high activity for the dehydrogenation of propane. Therefore, it can be concluded that hydrothermal synthesis is quite an effective method to obtain an efficient Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation.
4. Conclusion remarks
A Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalyst (GA-HS) prepared using a hydrothermal synthesis method showed prominent activity for the DHP-CO2 reaction. The highest propane conversion achieved on the GA-HS catalyst was 35.2%, which was much higher than that of GA-GM (8.7%) prepared using a grind-mixture method and GA-CP (26.2%) prepared using a coprecipitation method. Furthermore, the propylene selectivity over GA-HS was highest among these catalysts during the whole reaction time. On the other hand, propane conversion and propylene selectivity as a function of time on stream on regenerated GA-HS with CO2 are somewhat low in comparison with that on fresh GA-HS, implying that coke can be partly eliminated with CO2 through the Boudouard reaction. Moreover, the introduction of CO2 to this reaction system improved durability of the catalysts in spite of the decreased initial conversions of propane on these Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts. Characterization results, including BET and XPS, suggested that the hydrothermal conditions such as generated self-pressure, hydrothermal temperature and time (170 °C for 24 h) played significant roles in improving the dispersion and distribution of surface gallium sites. This process made more tetrahedral Ga3+ sites exposed on the surface of GA-HS, which contributed to the formation of surface Lewis acid sites. Moreover, hydrothermal treatment is favourable for improving the surface area and increasing the pore volume of the catalyst. The texture of GA-HS was largely well recovered with air regeneration even after 9 h reaction time. The higher surface area and larger number of tetrahedray ions (Ga3+ and probably Gaδ+) related to the strong Lewis acid sites were responsible for the superior activity of the GA-HS catalyst. Correlative work about the generation and effect of Gaδ+ ions are still ongoing.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
