Abstract
In this work, we evaluate reaction mechanism and kinetics of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) over Pt single-atom-doped Cr2O3 catalyst by combining density functional theory calculations and microkinetic analysis. Pt single-atom-doped Cr2O3 achieves superior propane conversion and propene selectivity to PtSn alloy and pristine Cr2O3 under typical operating conditions. Pt serves as a promoter to activate nearby Cr-O Lewis-Pair sites. The promotion effect of Pt single-atom on activity is attributed to the lowered energy level of conduction band minimum of nearby O Lewis-base site, enhancing its H capture ability and accordingly facilitating first step of dehydrogenation of propane. The Pt single-atom promoter also enhances propene selectivity by adjusting the Cr-O Lewis acid-base interaction with the deep dehydrogenation product, impeding deep dehydrogenation process. This work provides theoretical insights into the feasibility of atom-level dispersion Pt promoter activating CrOx-based catalysts for PDH process, and guidance for future rational design of other oxide-supported single-atom catalysts for PDH.

1. Introduction
Propylene is an important raw material for petrochemicals, and it has commonly been obtained through petroleum catalytic cracking or steam cracking [1]. With the large-scale exploitation of shale gas, it is easy to obtain a large number of light alkanes, which makes the technology of propane to propylene more and more concerned. The existing technical routes are divided into propane dehydrogenation (PDH) and propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) via oxygen or air [2]. The current commercial PDH process routes are mainly Oleflex and Catofin craft, where the former uses a Pt-based catalyst, and the latter uses a CrOx-based catalyst [3,4]. In the commercial PDH process, Pt-based catalysts and CrOx-based catalysts would be deactivated by coking, so they need to be frequently regenerated by air calcine. Among them, Pt-based catalysts would agglomerate and decrease specific surface area of active site after repeated regeneration, resulting in decreased activity or even deactivation after several cycles. Besides, there is a pair of contradictions between the high conversion rate of propane required at a higher temperature and the avoidance of propane cracking to coking. Therefore, how to develop catalysts with high activity, selectivity and thermal stability is of great significance.
Many researchers have contributed to the improvement of Cr-based catalysts. Han et al. [5] used phosphorus dopant to improve the stability and selectivity of Cr-Zr-Ox binary solid acid catalysts. Lapidus et al. [6] found that the addition of potassium reduced coke formation. In addition, some progress has been made in adding transition metals to CrOx catalysts for performance enhancement. The addition of Na, Li, K, Mg, Ca, Cs [7] and other elements to CrOx can regulate the electronic structure of the active site, and is helpful for the activity, selectivity, and resistance to carbon deposition of PDH process. Besides, there are also many studies on Pt-based catalysts, of which the catalytic performance are very dependent on the metal dispersion [8], [9], [10]. The dispersion engineering strategies of Pt species mainly includes alloying strategy, strong metal support interaction strategy and so on. The introduction of secondary metals effectively diluted active component Pt, and promoted the desorption of propylene products. Gong et al. [11] prepared ordered intermetallic compound PtZn4 catalyst with atomically isolated Pt sites, reducing the adsorption strength of propylene and hindering side reactions of deep dehydrogenation. The catalyst selectivity was over 95 % in the range of 520 °C and 620 °C, and no obvious deactivation was found after 160 h of testing. Van Assche et al. [12]. Low loading of Pt on γ-Al2O3 adjusts the acidity of γ-AL2O3 and effectively reduces the appearance of coking. Serykh et al. [13] found that highly dispersed ZnO significantly improved the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation. Shi et al. [14] synthesized the nanosilin catalyst with pentacoordinate Al3+ as the carrier loading Pt-Sn cluster, where both pentacoordinate Al3+ ions and Pt-Sn cluster were well dispersed to obtain a good catalytic performance. Zhou et al. [15] found that the strong acid side of the SUZ-4 molecular sieve made the Pt and Sn highly scattered, which ensures that Pt is not easily sintered into large particles, and effectively reduces the activation energy of dehydrogenation. In summary, adding transition metal dopants can improve the catalytic performance of CrOx-based catalysts for PDH, while the enhanced selectivity of propylene and the reduced occurrence of side reactions are achieved through dilution or high dispersion of Pt-based active component.
Inspired by both the dispersity improvement of Pt-based catalysts and the metal dopant modification on CrOx-based catalysts to enhance performance for propane dehydrogenation, it is reasonably suggested that the coupling between highly dispersed Pt and CrOx become a promising catalyst system. The limit to the degree of dispersion of metal species is that they exist in the form of single atoms. Since Zhang et al. [16] proposed the concept of single-atom catalysis, single-atom catalysis present a very good application prospect, including PDH, due to its high atom utilization and high intrinsic activity. Kong et al. [17] screening out V single atom supported on carbon nitride as a promising PDH catalyst by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Zhang et al. [18] found that the weak Lewis acid-base interactions of V2O3 catalysts could be tuned by Mn single-atom dopant, leading to good activity and selectivity of PDH. Hannagan et al. [19] designed the RhCu single-atom alloy catalyst by first-principles calculations and experimentally prepared highly active and coke-resistant Rh single-atom dispersed on Cu nanoparticles. Therefore, modifying CrOx with Pt single atoms may achieve the improvement of activity, selectivity and stability in the PDH reaction. What's more, the elucidation of the role of Pt single atoms and CrOx in the catalytic reaction may assist future rational design of other oxide-supported single-atom catalysts for PDH.
In this work, we employed DFT calculation to explore whether Pt single atoms can exist stably on the surface of CrOx under the conditions of catalyst calcination and regeneration. Next, we calculated and compared the intermediate adsorption and reaction energy barriers on the surfaces of Pt3Sn (111), pristine Cr2O3 (0001) and Pt1@Cr2O3 (0001). The effect of Pt single-atom on the catalytic behavior of PDH was regarded as a promoter to activate nearby Cr-O sites. It accelerated the first dehydrogenation of propane, as well as suppressed the deep dehydrogenation of propylene and the CrOx reduction under hydrogen environment. The promotion mechanism of Pt single-atom promoter was attributed to the engineering of Cr-O Lewis acid-base sites.
2. Computational details
2.1. DFT calculations and models
The Vienna Ab-initial Simulation Package (VASP) is used in DFT calculation in this paper. The exchange-correlation functional is the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional (PBE). The cut-off energy of the expansion of the plane is 400 eV. Through previous literatures [20], chromium oxide mainly exposed the (0001) crystal surface. There are two possible exposed termination, namely O-termination and Cr-termination. The latter one is found to be more stable through the calculation of surface free energy in Fig. S1. The surface energy (Es) is calculated using the following equation:
(1)
where Esurface is the energy of slab model, Ebulk is the energy of chromium oxide bulk and S is the surface area of the slab. As the energetically most favorable termination, Cr-exposed Cr2O3(0001) with a five-atom-layer slab and (2 × 2) supercell is employed in this work. In addition, a four-layer slab with a (2√3 × 2√3)R30°supercell is used to represent the Pt3Sn(111). The relaxed structure is cut into two atomic layers, the lower atomic layer is fixed, and the upper atomic layer is completely relaxed. A 15 Å vacuum layer is established to ensure no interaction between the upper and lower surfaces. The k-point grid used in the flat plate model is (3 × 3 × 1) for Cr2O3(0001) and (5 × 5 ×1) for Pt3Sn(111). An additional Hubbard-type term is applied in the simplified (rotationally invariant) DFT+U method for Cr in Cr2O3, and an effective on-site Coulomb interaction parameter U = 5 eV is used as defined in Ref. [21]. The convergence criterion for all intermediates and transition states is 0.03 eV/Å. The transition states are roughly identified with the nudged elastic band method [22] and further refined with the dimer [23] method.
The adsorption energies ΔEads are evaluated as

where Esurface+adsorbate is the total energy of the intermediate adsorbed on the reaction surface, Esurface is the energy of the slab and Eadsorbate is the energy of the isolated reaction intermediate. The details of the calculation of free energy can be found in S1 of Supporting Information.
The Lewis acid-base interaction(ΔEint,acid-base) is defined as follows [24]:

2.2. Microkinetics analysis
The reaction is treated in a quasi-steady state manner, and the turnover frequency (TOF) and selectivity of propylene are simulated at pH2 of 0.2 bar, pC3H8 from 0.3 bar to 3 bar, pC3H6 of 0.2 bar. More computational details are in the S2 of Supporting Information. The conversion ratio of propane is simulated using the continuous stirred tank reactor model.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Stability analysis of Pt1@C2O3(0001)
On the surface of Cr2O3(0001), we identified three position for Pt single atoms after structure relaxation test, namely Pt single atoms adsorbed on Cr hollow site (corresponding to I), Pt single atoms replacing surface O atoms (corresponding to II), and Pt single atoms replacing Cr surface atoms (corresponding to III), as shown in Fig. 1a. And the corresponding Gibbs free formation energy is calculated using the equation:

As shown in Fig. 1b, although the surface energy of III increases with increasing temperature, it is still the most stable state at the reaction temperature. Therefore, Pt single-atom prefers combining with Cr2O3 by doping in Cr vacancies.

In order to evaluate whether Pt single-atom exist stably against sintering under the reaction conditions of PDH, we calculate the chemical potential of Pt single-atom for Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) under the propane pressure of 0.1bar∼1.9 bar and temperature of 740K∼1000 K, as shown in Fig. 1c. The chemical potential calculation method of single-atom catalysts in the presence of propane and oxygen is shown in the S3 of Supporting Information. The chemical potential of Pt single-atom increases with increasing temperature and decreasing propane partial pressure. The negative values are maintained over the entire temperature variation and propane partial pressure variation range. We also investigate the variation of the chemical potential of Pt particle with different diameter under the reaction conditions of PDH, as shown in Fig. S2a. In the presence of propane, the chemical potential of Pt particles are all positive, and higher than that of Pt single-atom, indicating the thermodynamics stability against sintering of Pt single-atom under the reaction conditions of PDH. It is well known that the propane dehydrogenation catalyst needs to undergo a catalyst regeneration step by oxygen calcination, to achieve the purpose of removing carbon deposits. Therefore, we also test the chemical potential of Pt single-atom on Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) under catalyst regeneration conditions at different temperature and oxygen partial pressures. As shown in Figs. 1d and S2b, in the catalyst regeneration stage, the chemical potential of Pt single-atom is always lower than Pt particles, suggesting the thermodynamics stability against aggregation of Pt single-atom under the catalyst regeneration conditions. In order to investigate the kinetics stability Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) against sintering, the Pt single-atom migration energy barrier is calculated in Fig. S3, and it is as high as 4.31 eV. Therefore, it can be concluded from the above results that the Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) with Pt single-atom doping in Cr vacancies is stable.
In addition, the charge density difference (Fig. 1e) showed that the Pt atom undergo charge transfer to the surrounding four oxygen atoms. Based on partial density of states analysis (PDOS) on the Pt atom and its adjacent O atom (Fig. 1f), the orbital coupling between the 5d orbital of Pt and the 2p orbital of adjacent O exists from −8 eV to the Fermi level, indicating a strong interaction between them. The above electronic structure analysis demonstrates the strong electronic interaction between Pt single-atom and Cr2O3, accounting for the stability against diffusion and aggregation of Pt single-atom.
3.2. Propane dehydrogenation process on Pt1@C2O3(0001)
Since the reaction network of propane dehydrogenation is very complex, the reaction network of propane dehydrogenation in this work is simplified by only considering representative elementary steps playing a major role in PDH kinetic behavior [10]. The simplified reaction network is shown in Schema 1, including two steps of propane dehydrogenation and propylene/H2 product desorption as main reaction pathway, as well as deep propylene dehydrogenation, intermediate cracking as side reaction pathway. According to previous studies, the first dehydrogenation steps on the alloy surface and oxide surface are involved with methyl hydrogen [27] and methylene hydrogen [28], respectively.

3.2.1. Active site identification
The difficulty of breaking the CH bond determines the kinetics feasibility of propane dehydrogenation. There are two ways to activate the CH bond on the oxide surface, one is activated by the M-M and OO sites following the homolytic mechanism [29], the other one is activated by the M-O ion pairs via the heterolytic mechanism [30]. Some researchers proposed that on the surface of chromium oxide, the dehydrogenation of alkane occurs on the Cr-O ion pair, and then the H is adsorbed on the O site while the propyl group is adsorbed on the Cr site [29,30]. The previous authors [31] pointed out that the first step of dehydrogenation on the surface of chromium oxide occurs at the methylene position, but the situation after Pt atom doping is unknown. To clarify the reactive sites on Pt1@Cr2O3 (0001), we took the first step of dehydrogenation(Occurs in the methylene position) to test two types of sites, namely Cr-O and Pt-O pairs (Fig. 2a). As shown in Fig. 2b, Cr-O pair site binds propane molecule stronger, and the energy barrier of dehydrogenation on Cr-O pair site (1.13 eV) than that on Pt-O pair site (1.78 eV), suggesting the superior ability of Cr-O pair site to capture and activate propane. We performed a Bader charge analysis on the transition state for the first step of dehydrogenation on both Cr-O and Pt-O pair site. As shown in Fig. 2c, d, the electrons of H atoms are transferred to O atoms. The H atom on Cr-O pair site loses 0.14 electrons more than that on Pt-O pair site, making more stretched HO bond length (1.184 Å and 1.127 Å). H loses more electrons on Cr-O pair site accounts for a more stable transition state of propane dehydrogenation, which in turn leads to a lower energy barrier. So we infer that the active site for PDH on Pt1@Cr2O3 (0001) is still Cr-O pair site. Pt single-atom acts as a spectator nearby and may play an auxiliary role in the reaction, which need to be confirmed in the following.

3.2.2. First step dehydrogenation of propane
To demonstrate the high catalytic performance of Pt1@Cr2O3(0001), we adopted the Cr2O3(0001) and Pt3Sn(111) as a comparison. Gibbs free energy diagram and configuration for each state along PDH on Pt1@Cr2O3(0001), Cr2O3(0001) and Pt3Sn1(111) are shown in Fig. 3. After test (Fig. S4), methylene-hydrogen of propane are preferentially taken away by surface O at Pt1@Cr2O3 (0001). The 2-propyl is adsorbed on the Cr site and H is taken away by the oxygen ions nearby the Cr Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) and Cr2O3(0001). Fig. 3a showed that the first step dehydrogenation energy barrier on the Cr2O3 (0001) surface is 1.28 eV. The energy barrier for the first dehydrogenation at the same Cr-O site is lowered to 1.13 eV after doping with Pt single atoms. The energy barrier of first dehydrogenation on Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) is also lower than that of Pt3Sn(111) (1.26 eV). From the results in Fig. 3a and d, Pt single-atom does not change the reaction site but increase the activity of the Cr-O pair nearby, lowering the reaction energy barrier.

3.2.3. Second step dehydrogenation of propane
As shown in Fig. 3d, the active site of the second step dehydrogenation is the same as that of the first step dehydrogenation. We assumed that the H atom in the first step of dehydrogenation becomes gaseous H2 with the H atom in the adjacent position to release the O site (H2 generation step will be considered next). The hydrogen on the methyl group is taken away by the neighbor O of the Cr binding 2-propyl group, and then the product propylene is formed and adsorbed on Cr2O3 (0001). The energy barrier of the second-step dehydrogenation on Cr2O3 (0001) surface is 1.10 eV. The O atom next to the Pt single-atom on the Pt1@Cr2O3 (0001) abstracted the hydrogen atom of the 2-propyl group on the methyl group, and the product propylene is formed with the second-step dehydrogenation energy barrier of 0.89 eV. The beneficial effect of Pt single-atom on Cr-O pair site is still obvious in second dehydrogenation step.
3.2.4. Deep dehydrogenation of propylene and intermediate cracking
The desorption of propylene and the deep dehydrogenation of propylene are two competing steps. The desorption of propylene brings about the desired product propylene, but the further dehydrogenation of propylene will lead to the formation of by-products and even coke poisoning active sites. Therefore, the difference between the propylene desorption energy and the deep dehydrogenation energy barrier is a selectivity index for PDH. As shown in Fig. 3b, the energy barrier for deep dehydrogenation on Cr2O3 (0001) is the lowest (0.83 eV), and the energy barrier for deep dehydrogenation on Pt3Sn(111) is relatively higher (1.47 eV). Pt single-atom successfully impedes deep dehydrogenation of propylene on Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) by greatly increasing energy barrier to 1.75 eV. All the above deep dehydrogenation paths were determined by screening the most stable final state structures. The adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) surface is comparable to that on the pristine chromia surface. However, the difference between the propylene desorption energy and the deep dehydrogenation energy barrier on Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) is much higher than that of Cr2O3(0001), which indicates that the addition of Pt single-atom may lead to high propylene selectivity of PDH on Pt1@Cr2O3(0001).
We also investigated another side reactions of PDH, namely the cleavage reaction, which results in severe precursor of carbon deposition covering the reaction sites. As shown in Fig. S5, we find that the cracking barrier are 1.26 eV, 3.79 eV and 3.63 eV on Pt3Sn(111), Cr2O3 (0001) and Pt1@Cr2O3(0001), respectively. The activation of CC bonds on chromium oxide is much more difficult than that on Pt-based alloy, indicating that the contribution of cracking to side reactions on Cr2O3 (0001) and Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) is negligible, while the CC bond activation on Pt3Sn(111) is easier and cannot be ignored.
3.2.5. Formation of H2 or H2O
The formation of H2 affects the renewal of the active site. We calculated the energy barriers of H2 formation at different sites in the three systems respectively. The intermediate configuration along this process is shown in Fig. S6. The most probable dehydrogenation site on the Pt3Sn(111) is Pt-Pt, and its H2 formation energy barrier is 0.24 eV. The position for H2 formation on Cr2O3 (0001) and Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) surfaces are Cr-O sites, and the energy barriers are 0.44 eV and 0.65 eV. The addition of Pt single-atom makes the adsorption of H atoms more firmly, which slightly increases the H2 formation energy. Although the energy barrier of H2 formation on Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) has been improved, it is still relatively low and will not have much impact on PDH.
In addition to generating H2, the H atoms on the catalyst surface may also reduce the surface O of Cr2O3(0001) to form H2O, which leads to the deactivation of the catalyst. We compared the energy barriers for the reduction of lattice O to H2O on Cr2O3(0001) and Pt1@Cr2O3(0001), as shown in Fig. 3c. The energy barrier of this step is 0.45 eV on the Cr2O3(0001) and 0.52 eV on the Pt1@Cr2O3(0001). The surface O adjacent to Pt single-atom on the Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) is more stable than that on pristine Cr2O3(0001), which is due to the strong interaction between the 5d orbital of Pt and the 2p orbital of O. As shown in Fig. S7, the electron localization between Cr and O in is much lower than that between Pt and O. The doping of Pt single-atom resulted in the loss of 0.14 electrons (Bader charge analysis) from neighbor O. The more covalent-bond-like of Pt-O bond and less negative charged of surface O may bring about more difficult of Cr2O3 to be reduced by H2 in Pt1@Cr2O3(0001).
3.3. Microkinetic analysis on PDH of Pt1@Cr2O3(0001)
Based on DFT numerical calculation on free energy profile of each elementary step among PDH process, microkinetic analysis based on mean field approximation are performed to obtain PDH kinetics behavior under a wide range of operating conditions. As shown in Fig. 4a, Propylene production turnover frequencies (TOF) of Pt3Sn(111), Cr2O3(0001) and Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) increased with the temperature from 800 K to 1000 K. Among the three systems, the Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) is the best which proves that Pt single-atom doping indeed greatly improves the catalyst activity. We also studied the effect of propane partial pressure on TOF (Fig. 4b). The reaction rate increases with the increase of the propane partial pressure, and its distribution is roughly equivalent to that of Fig. 4a. The activity of Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) is the highest, followed by the Pt3Sn alloy catalyst and undoped Cr2O3. The continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) model is employed to simulate conversion of propane under actual operating conditions, as shown in Fig. 4c. Because of the lower activation energy of dehydrogenation steps, the conversion of Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) is higher than other catalysts in the temperature range of 700K∼1000 K. As shown in Fig. 4d, then we simulated the propylene selectivity at 800K∼1000 K, where Pt single-atom activated Cr2O3 (0001) and made Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) exhibit excellent selectivity approaching 99 % and superior to Cr2O3 (0001). As shown in Fig. S8 The coverage of coking precursors on the Pt3Sn(111) and Cr2O3 (0001) surfaces gradually increases with temperature, which is the reason why conventional catalysts require frequent regeneration. The coverage of coking precursors on Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) surface side reactions is low under very wide operating conditions, which also means that Pt can play a promoting role in extending the catalyst lifetime. In a wide range of operating conditions, the propane consumption and propylene selectivity of PDH on Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) surpassed those on Pt3Sn(111) and Cr2O3(0001) as traditional catalyst benchmark.

(f) Degree of selective control (DSC) for propylene production by propylene desorption step and propylene deep dehydrogenation step on Cr2O3(0001) and Pt1@Cr2O3(0001).
In order to further clarify the mechanism of Pt single-atom promoter benefiting activity and selectivity of PDH on Pt1@Cr2O3(0001), the reaction key steps have to be identified. The rate control degrees for propylene production by first dehydrogenation step (R2) and second dehydrogenation step (R3) are calculated in Fig. 4e, presenting that first dehydrogenation step (R2) play a main role in controlling propylene production. So the superior propylene TOF and propane conversion ratio of Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) to Cr2O3(0001) are attributed to the lowered energy barriers of first dehydrogenation step (R2) derived from Pt single-atom promoter. Since the desorption of propylene and the deep dehydrogenation of propylene are two competing steps determining propylene selectivity, the degree of selectivity control (DSC) is performed in Fig. 4f. Although propylene desorption is important factor controlling selectivity for both Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) and Cr2O3(0001) (DSC=−1), Pt single-atom promoter did not augment selectivity of propylene through facilitating propylene desorption, since the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) is comparable to that on pristine Cr2O3(0001). The DSC by propylene deep dehydrogenation fluctuated between 0.1 and 0.3 on the Pt1@Cr2O3(0001), and is 1 on Cr2O3(0001), indicating that higher energy barrier of propylene deep dehydrogenation leads to higher propylene selectivity. Therefore, the enhanced propylene selectivity of Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) compared with Cr2O3(0001) is attributed to the higher energy barrier of deep propylene dehydrogenation induced by Pt single-atom promoter. This finding has also been confirmed in related studies [32,33].
3.4. The role of pt single-atom promotor
To comprehensibly explore the role of Pt single-atom promoter in the PDH reaction, we also studied Pt single-atom concentration dependent promotion effect by further simulating diatomic and triatomic Pt doped systems as shown in Fig. 5a, b. The addition of Pt atoms do not change the adsorption mode of propane, where propane is adsorbed on the surface through physical adsorption, but changed the adsorption energy of propane from −0.38 eV to −0.52 eV. Stronger adsorption behavior eventually also leads to lower dehydrogenation barrier. The energy barrier of rate-control step R2 decreased to 0.82 eV and 0.87 eV when the number of Pt atoms increased to two or three. Therefore, the addition of Pt atoms indeed plays a role in lowering the energy barrier of the first step dehydrogenation. The TOF of propylene formation on the pristine Cr2O3(0001) and Cr2O3(0001) with different Pt single-atom concentration are shown in Fig. 5c. With the increase of Pt single-atom content, the TOF of the reaction increases, and remains almost unchanged when the Pt doping amount continues to increase to 3.

(c) TOF of Cr2O3(0001), Pt1@Cr2O3(0001), Pt2@Cr2O3(0001), Pt3@Cr2O3(0001) TOF at 800 K temperature. (d) H adsorption energy versus R2 energy barrier. (e) Projected density of states of 2p orbital of O Lewis-base site for Cr2O3(0001), Pt1@Cr2O3(0001), Pt2@Cr2O3(0001), Pt3@Cr2O3(0001). (f) CBM and H adsorption energy of Cr2O3(0001), Pt1@Cr2O3(0001), Pt2@Cr2O3(0001), Pt3@Cr2O3(0001).
It can be seen from Fig. 5d that the addition of Pt makes the H adsorption energy more negative, and consequently the barrier of the first dehydrogenation is lower. In the first step of dehydrogenation, H is more likely to be adsorbed on the O Lewis-base site, so the electronic structure on the O Lewis-base site have a great impact on the reaction. So we calculated the Bader charge analysis and charge density difference to get the electron transfer situation. As seen from Fig. S9, less electrons transferred from Pt single-atom to the adjacent O atoms than Cr sites did, which leads to the less valence electrons (from 7.04 to 6.87) and downward shift of the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the 2p orbital of O Lewis-base site shown in Fig. 5e. At last, the lower energy level of CBM benefits the electron acceptance process of H adsorption on O Lewis-base site upon propane dihydrogen. The CBM value of O Lewis-base site and H adsorption energy versus different Pt single-atom amounts in Fig. 5f, supports our demonstration above. Therefore, we attributed the promotion effect of Pt-single atom on the increased activity to the decreased CBM of O Lewis-base site and accordingly strengthened H adsorption, which reduced energy barriers of first dehydrogenation step (R2).
According to DSC analysis on Fig. 4f, energy barrier of propylene deep dehydrogenation (R4) is the key factor to control propylene selectivity. The addition of Pt single-atoms increases the deep dehydrogenation barrier from 0.83 eV to 1.94 eV, and then decrease to 1.27 eV and 1.57 eV, as the number of Pt single-atoms increase. It has been shown that the acidity of the catalyst surface has a great influence on the selectivity [34], [35], [36]. The electron transfer redistribution induced by Pt single-atom described above also made the Lewis acid-base interaction discrepant among studied models. As seen from Fig. S10, the Lewis acid-base interaction with deep dehydrogenation product is weakened when introducing more and more Pt single-atom, which bring about a volcano relationship with R4 energy barrier. The Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) with Lewis acid-base interaction nearest zero possess the highest deep dehydrogenation barrier and superior propylene selectivity. Therefore, we attributed the promotion effect of Pt-single atom on the enhanced propylene selectivity to the optimized Lewis acid-base interaction with deep dehydrogenation product, impeding deep dehydrogenation process.
4. Conclusion
In this paper, the catalytic performance of Pt single-atom supported on Cr2O3 catalysts in the PDH is studied by combining DFT calculations and microkinetic analysis. Pt single-atom is found to exist in the Cr vacancies of Cr2O3 in the form of dopant, which generates strong interactions with adjacent O and is able to maintain atomic-level dispersion under reaction and catalyst regeneration conditions. Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) is more active than Cr2O3 and Pt3Sn alloy catalysts for PDH, possessing superior the propane conversion rate and propylene selectivity simultaneously. Pt single-atom serves as a promoter and decreases the CBM of nearby O Lewis-base site, which reduces the energy barrier of the first step of dehydrogenation by strengthening the adsorption of H atoms. The high selectivity of Pt1@Cr2O3(0001) is attributed to the weakened Cr-O Lewis acid-base interaction to zero due to Pt single-atom promoter, which weakens the adsorption of deep dehydrogenation products and increases the energy barrier of deep dehydrogenation. This work provides theoretical insights into the feasibility of atom-level dispersion Pt promoter activating CrOx-based catalysts for PDH process, and guidance for future rational design of other oxide-supported single-atom catalysts for PDH.
