 Unfortunately, the provided extractions do not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation catalysts. The documents focus on the production of cellulosic ethanol from wheat stillage, with no mention of PDH or ODH processes. 

Since there are no relevant details to summarize, the output XML would be:

<output>
	<Relevance>No</Relevance> 
</output>

The output indicates that the aggregated information from the multiple extractions is not relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation research. No catalyst or process details can be synthesized since the documents are unrelated to the specified topic.
