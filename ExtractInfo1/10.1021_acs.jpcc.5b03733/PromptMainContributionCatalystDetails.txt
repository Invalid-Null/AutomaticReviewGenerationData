Selective Oxidation of Hydrogen in the Presence of Propylene over Pt-Based Core–Shell Nanocatalysts
Abstract
Coupling of propane dehydrogenation with selective hydrogen oxidation is a practical strategy to achieve high propylene yield and low energy consumption. In this work, the detailed reaction mechanism on Pt(111) is explored using density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling to benefit the design of new catalysts. Calculated results indicate that the O2 dissociation pathway is dominant for hydrogen oxidation, and the dissociation of O2 is kinetically relevant. With the comparison between the energy barriers for dehydrogenation and oxidation, propyne is found to be the starting point for C3 oxidation. To obtain a high hydrogen oxidation rate and suppress the consumption of propylene, the catalytic performance of 11 M@Pt (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Os, Ir, Pd, Ag, and Au) core–shell surfaces is examined. Among all the core–shells, Ag@Pt not only has a high catalytic activity for hydrogen oxidation, but also exhibits a high selectivity toward propylene and is, therefore, the best candidate for selective hydrogen oxidation in the presence of propylene.

ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In the past decade, the demand for propylene has increased rapidly and the development of on-purpose propylene production techniques has become one of the focuses of fundamental research. (1-7) Currently, catalytic dehydrogenation to produce propylene using cheap propane is rather a promising solution and has many advantages, such as high selectivity and long-term stability of catalyst. (1, 7) However, this reaction is strongly endothermic and has an increased molecularity and, therefore, prefers high reaction temperature, low pressure, or strong dilution to achieve high conversion. To break up the equilibrium limitation, a recently adopted strategy is to introduce a selective hydrogen oxidation process that takes place after the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to obtain a reasonable propylene yield. The principal idea of this coupled process is to supply heat for propane dehydrogenation by selective combustion of the hydrogen molecules formed in the dehydrogenation process, which can make the overall process heat-balanced or slightly exothermic. (8) Another benefit is that the combustion of hydrogen can shift the equilibrium toward the product side, and the resultant steam can prevent coke formation and therefore inhibit the deactivation of catalyst. (1, 9)
In the presence of propylene, the oxidation of hydrogen is found to be kinetically more favorable than that of propylene on Pt catalyst, as evidenced by experimental observations. (8, 9) There is, however, still 20% of oxygen consumed by propylene with the H2 to O2 molar ratio in the feed gas being 2. Therefore, significant improvements in the selectivity for the oxidation of hydrogen are demanded in order to suppress the consumption of propylene and to provide more energy for the dehydrogenation process.
Hydrogen oxidation is a canonical chemical reaction because of its ubiquitous presence in the combustion, corrosion, and energy storage, as well as energy conversion processes. (10) Experimentally, the oxidation of hydrogen has been studied extensively, especially in polymer-electrolyte membrane fuel cells or proton-exchange membrane fuel cells. (11-13) Well-defined single crystal surface studies over Pt, Au, and Ag have been conducted to probe the oxidation activity. (14-16) The structure sensitivity and oxidation reaction mechanisms were found to depend strongly on the employed electrolyte. (15, 16) These single-crystal surfaces have also been studied through theoretical calculations in recent years. The oxidation of hydrogen involves seven intermediates and three possible reaction pathways, namely, the OH, OOH, and HOOH dissociation pathways. (17) It was found that the reactivity of the catalyst for H2 oxidation is related to the binding of oxygen, which should be neither too strong nor too weak. (12, 18) This is because a strong binding will hinder the further reduction of oxygen, while a weak binding will result in a slow dissociation rate of gaseous oxygen. According to the recent experimental and theoretical work, Pt, Pd, Pt–Pd, and Fe–Pt are good candidates for the oxygen reduction reaction. (12, 19)
On the other hand, Pt is catalytically active for the oxidation of alkenes. (8, 9, 20-23) The oxidation of propylene involves numerous derivatives ranging from C1 to C3 species, which makes the mechanism much more complicated than the oxidation of hydrogen. In recent years, DFT calculations and spectroscopic measurements have been performed to identify the possible reaction intermediates for propylene oxidation on the catalyst. (8, 22, 24) The stoichiometries of C3H5 and C3H4, which derive from the oxidehydrogenation, were verified using the in situ soft X-ray fluorescence method. (22, 25) On the basis of these detected reaction intermediates, the mechanism for propylene oxidation was proposed: hydrocarbons first are dehydrogenated on the Pt(111) surface at low temperatures, followed by the partial oxidation to ketones or alcohols and then completely combusted to CO2 at higher temperatures. (21, 22, 25) Nevertheless, the attempt to obtain a more detailed oxidation mechanism is still unsuccessful because much less theoretical information is available.
Once the oxidation mechanisms are revealed, a promising approach to improve the catalytic performance of Pt is to introduce a second metal to form the near-surface alloys, which are also called core–shell catalysts. (26, 27) On one hand, the utilization of active metals that are often precious would be improved with the substitution of core regions by nonprecious metals; on the other hand, the electronic structure (and hence the catalytic property) of catalyst could be tuned through the synergistic effect of core metals on shell metals to meet the requirements of specific reactions. (26-30) For the oxidation of hydrogen, the core–shell catalysts using Pt as the shell metal shows higher activity than Pt. (11, 17, 31, 32) As an example, Pd@Pt shows the highest activity for oxygen reduction reaction at a cell potential of 1.23 V. (16) Therefore, it is practically feasible to apply the core–shell catalysts, which are made up of a transition metal core covered with a Pt shell to achieve a high selectivity toward hydrogen oxidation.
In this work, the reaction mechanism for the oxidation of hydrogen and propylene is first investigated on the Pt(111) surface. The dominant reaction pathway and the corresponding rate-determining step for hydrogen oxidation are identified, and the starting point for C3 oxidation is revealed. On the basis of the reaction rate for hydrogen oxidation and the energy barrier difference between propylene activation and propylene desorption, 11 M@Pt core–shell catalysts (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Os, Ir, Rh, Ru, Pd, Ag, and Au) are screened to single out the best candidate that catalyzes hydrogen oxidation in the presence of propylene.

In the present work, all DFT calculations were carried out with the VASP package. (33-35) The exchange-correlation energy and potential were described self-consistently within the generalized gradient approximation proposed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE). (36) The Kohn–Sham one-electron valence states were expanded in a basis of plane waves with kinetic energy below 400 eV to achieve a tight convergence. The interactions between valence electrons and ion cores were represented by Blöchl’s all-electron-like projector augmented wave (PAW) method. (37) Ionic core of O was described by soft version pseudopotential. Given the symmetry of the system, Monkhorst–Pack grid was used to sample the Brillouin zone. The electronic occupancies were determined based on a Methfessel–Paxton scheme (38) with an energy smearing of 0.2 eV.
Catalyst surfaces were modeled using five-layer slabs, with at least 12 Å of vacuum separating periodic images of metal slabs in the z-direction of the unit cell. To determine the adsorption configurations and activation barriers for H2 and propylene oxidation, a p(3 × 3) surface unit cell was employed, achieving the adsorbate coverage of 1/9 ML. In all the cases, convergence with respect to various calculation parameters was confirmed. Monkhorst–Pack meshes of 5 × 5 × 1 k-point samplings in the surface Brillouin zone were used. In our calculations, the bottom two atomic layers were fixed at their equilibrium bulk positions, while all the other atoms were allowed to relax. The ground-state atomic geometries of bulk and surfaces were optimized by minimizing the Hellman–Feynman forces and the convergence criteria was 0.03 eV/Å on each ion. For the magnetic elements, namely, Fe, Co, and Ni, spin-polarized effect was considered.
Transition states were located with the minimum mode following the dimer method. (39-41) The most stable adsorption configurations of the reactants on the surface were determined by the standard DFT optimization. These configurations were used as the initial states to find the lowest curvature mode and to climb up the potential energy surface from minimum to saddle point through the dimer method. All the saddle points obtained in this work were verified by frequency analysis, and only one imaginary frequency was identified for each transition state.
The M@Pt core–shell catalysts were modeled by a single layer of Pt atoms placed on top of four-layer slabs of Fe(100), Ni(111), Cu(111), Ir(111), Rh(111), Pd(111), Ag(111), Au(111), Co(0001), Os(0001), and Ru(0001), as shown in Figure 1. In experiments, a multilayered structure was observed in the shell of core–shell nanoparticles. As an example, the Pt@Pd core–shell nanoparticles containing 3–10 Pd layers in the shell were prepared with different Pd loadings. (19, 42, 43) Given the fact that the lattice mismatch arising from the different atomic sizes between core and shell metals is much lower under our computational conditions than that under realistic experimental conditions, and since the synergistic effect of core metals on Pt would be enhanced with decreasing Pt layers, here we constructed a single-layer structure in the Pt shell, which is also the typical treatment of core–shell catalyst models in DFT calculations. (28, 44, 45)
The segregation energies of Pt from the bulk core metals to the surface have been reported by Wang and Johnson, and they found that Pt atoms prefer to stay on the surface for most of the core–shell models, except for Cu, Pd, Ag, and Au. (46) Considering the ligand effect, however, the bonding ability of these four metals is much weaker than Pt, and this difference in bonding ability may probably induce the restructuring of the core–shell nanoparticles. (47) For example, the adsorption energies for propylene on Cu(111), Ag(111), and Au(111) are lower than −0.10 eV, while on Pt(111), the corresponding value is as high as −0.91 eV, which might suggest that the core–shell models for Cu@Pt, Pd@Pt, Ag@Pt, and Au@Pt are stable under propylene atmosphere.

3.1 H2 Oxidation on Pt(111)
For hydrogen oxidation, three possible reaction pathways were constructed according to the dissociation of intermediates involved, as shown in Figure 2. First, the adsorbed O2 can dissociate on the surface to generate two adsorbed O atoms and then react with H atoms to form water, which is referred to as Path I. Second, the adsorbed O2 can react with a hydrogen atom to form OOH, followed by its dissociation to O and OH and the hydrogenation of these species to water, which is referred to as Path II. Third, the adsorbed OOH generated from the hydrogenation of O2 can be further hydrogenated to H2O2. After the O–O bond is broken, the remaining OH is hydrogenated to form water, which is referred to as Path III. The activation barriers and reaction heats for the elementary steps involved in hydrogen oxidation are listed in Table 1, and the geometries of the transition states are schematically represented in Figure 3.

Starting from molecular H2 and O2 in the gas phase, we illustrate the energy profiles for these three reaction pathways on Pt(111), as shown in Figure 4. The dissociative adsorption of H2 is barrierless and lowers the potential energy of the whole system by 0.47 eV per 1/2 H2. Along Path I, the dissociation of adsorbed O2 takes place at an FCC site, with one O atom adsorbed at the Bridge site and the other at the Atop site, as shown in Figure 3 (step 1). The energy barrier for this step is 0.39 eV, which is an energy-gain process because of the strong binding of O to Pt(111). The subsequent OH formation process, O* + H* ⇋ OH*, also occurs at an FCC site and is hindered by an energy barrier of 1.01 eV, which is much higher than those for the other two reactions involved in this pathway. Similar results (0.98 (48) and 0.85 eV (28, 44)) have been reported. Once OH is formed, it will be consumed to form water with a low hydrogenation barrier of 0.40 eV. Along Path II, the adsorbed O2 first reacts with H at an FCC site to produce OOH with a hydrogenation barrier calculated to be 0.44 eV, which is close to the data by Nilekar et al. (28) The dissociation of OOH at the Bridge site is almost barrierless (the energy barrier is less than 0.1 eV). The generated O and OH will follow the same mechanism as described in Path I to form water. In addition, the OOH fragment may undergo a hydrogenation step at a Bridge site to form hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) through Path III, but the energy barrier is 0.33 eV higher than that for the dissociation of OOH. The last step for Path III, dissociation of H2O2, is barrierless, which suggests that H2O2 is readily consumed on Pt(111).

To identify the dominant reaction pathway and the corresponding rate-determining step, microkinetic modeling was performed. According to experimental conditions, (8) the modeling was carried out at 773.15 K, 23 kPa with the BET area of Pt catalyst of 483 m2/g, and the initial volume fraction of H2 and O2 being 0.67 and 0.33, respectively. The value of W/F0 is set to be 0.01 gcat·h/mol. The details on the modeling can be found in the Supporting Information. After the microkinetic model was solved, the reaction rates for the elementary reactions and the surface coverages of the reaction intermediates are obtained and presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. From Table 1, one can see that (1) the reaction rate for step 1 is much faster than that for step 2, indicating that Path I (O2* dissociation pathway) is preferred compared to Path II; (2) the reaction rate for step 4 is much faster than that for step 5, indicating that Path II (OOH* dissociation pathway) is preferred compared to Path III; (3) though the OH formation process, O* + H* ⇋ OH*, has a high energy barrier, the reaction rate is as high as 2.53 × 103 because of the high surface coverage of O* and H*, as shown in Table 2. In summary, Path I is the dominant reaction pathway for hydrogen oxidation on Pt(111), and the rate-limiting step for Path I is suggested to be O2* + * ⇋ 2O*.

3.2 Propylene Oxidation on Pt(111)
In the selective hydrogen oxidation process, most of the oxygen reacts with hydrogen to form water. However, the simultaneous consumption of propylene on Pt catalyst is inevitable. (8, 9) The oxidation of propylene involves a sequence of elementary steps including dehydrogenation, oxidation, and C–C bond breaking, which leads to a complicated reaction mechanism. In our previous study, dehydrogenation was found to be kinetically more favorable than C–C bond cleavage for most of the C3 derivatives, which enables us to exclude cracking in the oxidation mechanism. (5) As a consequence, we can identify the most likely C3 intermediate that favors oxidation by examining the competition between the dehydrogenation and oxidation of each C3 intermediate. As the C3 intermediates could be oxidized either by O or OH under experimental conditions, and therefore, both of the two oxidants are taken into account.
3.2.1 Dehydrogenation with Coadsorbed Oxidants
According to our previous work, (5) propylene can be readily dehydrogenated to C3H4 [propenylidene (CH3CHC) or propyne (CH3CCH)] on Pt(111) because the energy barriers are as low as 0.70–0.80 eV, while the deep dehydrogenation of C3H4 to form propynyl (CH3CC) is hindered by very high activation energies. This indicates that C3H4 is the ending point for propylene dehydrogenation on Pt(111). Hence, the possible products for propylene dehydrogenation on Pt(111) are 1-propenyl (CH3CHCH), 2-propenyl (CH3CCH2), propenylidene, and propyne. To investigate the effect of an oxidation atmosphere on dehydrogenation, we preadsorbed the oxidants, namely, O and OH, on the Pt(111) surface, and the structures with the lowest total energy were identified. As shown in Table 3, the dehydrogenation barriers increase by 0.09–0.17 eV with O coadsorbed, and 0.03–0.08 eV with OH coadsorbed, as compared to the data on bare Pt(111), signifying that the dehydrogenation is slightly inhibited by the coadsorption of oxidants.

3.2.2 Oxidation by O and OH
In an oxidation atmosphere, the aforementioned five C3 species yielded in the dehydrogenation process, namely, propylene, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, propenylidene, and propyne, could be oxidized by O or OH, which eventually gives rise to the formation of complete combustion product CO2, (8, 22, 23) and the corresponding reaction pathways are referred to as O and OH pathways.
The geometries of the transition states for oxidation of the C3 intermediates are schematically represented in Figure 5, where the interatomic distances between the activated C and O atoms are given. From this figure, some general trends can be observed: (1) In the activated complex, the O atom keeps sitting at the Bridge site, while the OH group keeps sitting at the Atop site; (2) With careful examination of the configurations of the remaining C3 fragments, it is found that the −CH2/–CH– group is tilted away from the surface (shown in steps 15 and 16), the −CH/–C– group is driven from the Bridge site to the adjacent Atop site (shown in steps 17 and 18), and the C– group favors the FCC site (shown in step 19); (3) C atoms that do not react directly with O/OH are kept sp3-hybridized.

The calculated energy barriers for these oxidation reactions are summarized in Table 4. According to this table, it is found that the middle C atom is more readily activated than the terminal C atom. For example, the energy barrier for the oxidation of propylene at the middle C atom by O is 1.19 eV, 0.31 eV lower than that at the terminal C atom. Moreover, for each C3 intermediate, the energy barrier for the oxidation reaction by O is higher than that by OH, which indicates that the hydrocarbons favor to be coupled with OH to produce oxygenated hydrocarbons. In particular, the energy barrier for the oxidation of propyne by OH is only 0.42 eV, which is 1.17 eV lower than that by O.

3.2.3 Dehydrogenation versus Oxidation
In order to single out the most likely C3 intermediate to be oxidized, we analyzed the competition between dehydrogenation and oxidation for the five aforementioned C3 species. As the activation energies for the O oxidation pathway are higher than those for the OH oxidation pathway, only the OH oxidation pathway was taken into account. Similarly, the C–C bond cleavage is not considered here because of the much higher barriers than those for C–H bond activation. (5) The energy profiles for the dehydrogenation and oxidation of C3 intermediates by OH are compared in Figure 6. As for propylene and 2-propenyl, one can see that the energy barriers for the dehydrogenation and oxidation are rather close, with the energy difference being 0.12 and 0.07 eV, respectively. For propenylidene, though the dehydrogenation pathway is hindered by a high energy barrier, the oxidation pathway is still not preferred because it can be readily hydrogenated back to form 1-propenyl (Ea = 0.57 eV). (5) For propyne, however, the oxidation reaction is dramatically promoted and the energy barrier is 0.82 eV lower than that for its dehydrogenation. As the sole C3 species that favors C–O bond activation, propyne is likely to be the starting point for oxidation.

For selective hydrogen combustion in the presence of propylene, the primary objective is to convert hydrogen completely with little propylene consumption. In this sense, desorption of propylene from catalyst surface is highly desired. On Pt(111), however, the energy barriers for dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, and oxidation are lower than that for its desorption, (5) indicating a low selectivity toward gaseous propylene. A practical solution to this problem is to alloy Pt with a second metal to obtain core–shell nanoparticles, which has ever been found effective to tailor the selectivity of catalysts for certain reactions. (28, 44)
3.3 Core–Shell Nanocatalysts for Selective Oxidation of Hydrogen
The core–shell nanocatalysts show unique reactivity that is different from the metals both in the core region and on the catalyst surface. As suggested by Mavrikakis et al., the Pt-rich overlays show higher activity for hydrogen oxidation than pure Pt. (11, 17, 31, 32) In the present work, we calculated the binding energies of the reaction intermediates and energy barriers for the elementary steps that are involved in both hydrogen and propylene oxidation on 11 M@Pt core–shell surfaces. These alloys are classified into two groups according to their d-band centers (εd), as shown in Table 5. Group I contains Co@Pt, Fe@Pt, Cu@Pt, Ni@Pt, Ru@Pt, Rh@Pt, Os@Pt, and Ir@Pt, which have lower d-band centers than that of Pt(111); Group II contains Pd@Pt, Ag@Pt, and Au@Pt, which have higher d-band centers in energy.

3.3.1 Adsorption on Core–Shell Nanocatalysts
As the lattice constants for the core metals are different from that of Pt, upon deposition on the core metals, the Pt monolayer is laterally compressed or stretched compared to the lattice constant of pure bulk Pt. It was reported that the compression would weaken the bonding ability of the surface Pt atoms in Ru@Pt nanoparticles. (44) The compression would increase the embedding electron density from neighboring atoms and leads to the d-band center shifting away below the Fermi level, whereas the expansion reduces the d-orbital overlap and leads to an upshift in d-band center. (49) For example, the expansion of Pt by Ag substrate leads to an upshift in εd of 0.38 eV, while the compression by Ru substrate leads to a downshift of 0.76 eV, which is consistent with experimental observations. (44) The variation in the Pt d-band has been shown to change the binding strength of various adsorbates to the M@Pt surfaces. The calculated binding energies of the species that are involved in selective hydrogen oxidation are presented in Figure 7 (the detailed data are listed in the Supporting Information). The atomic O is bound most strongly among all the species, and the binding energies on the core–shell surfaces that are included in Group I are less negative than those on the alloys in Group II. It is worth noting that the binding of propylene on all the core–shell surfaces are weaker than that on Pt(111), which indicates a lower saturation coverage of propylene on the alloy surfaces under experimental conditions.

3.3.2 Reactivity of Core–Shell Nanocatalysts
Having known the bonding ability of the core–shell surfaces, we are now proceeding to investigate the catalytic activity of these alloyed surfaces. The energy barriers for the elementary steps involved in the oxidation of hydrogen and the dehydrogenation of propylene are listed in Table 5. These reactions are classified into two categories, namely, bond-making and bond-breaking reactions. The bond-making reactions contain the hydrogenation of O2, O, OH, and OOH, and the bond-breaking reactions contain the dissociation of O2, OOH, and H2O2. On the basis of our calculations, it is found that the alloyed surfaces that are in Group I exhibit higher activity for bond-making reactions than Pt(111), as evidenced by the lower energy barriers. This is because, for bond-making (bond-breaking) reactions, the downshift of the d-band center weakens the binding of the initial state (final state) more greatly than that of the final state (initial state) because of the surface-mediated bonding competition effect (50) and, consequently, the reaction enthalpy becomes more negative (less negative), which finally gives rise to a lower (higher) energy barrier according to the BEP relationship. (51-53)
Here microkinetic modeling was also performed to examine H2 oxidation on the core–shell catalysts. The reaction rate for all the elementary steps can be found in the Supporting Information. It is found that Path I is the dominant reaction pathway on all the core–shells, which resembles the results on Pt(111), and the rate-determining step is O2 dissociation. Moreover, we calculated the conversion of H2 oxidation on all the core–shells under the same reaction conditions (773.15 K, 1 bar, and the initial volume fraction of H2 and O2 being 0.67 and 0.33), as shown in Table 5. It can be seen that Ag@Pt has the highest conversion of H2 than the other surfaces, including Pt(111) and is therefore suggested to be the most active catalyst for H2 oxidation.
On the other hand, the core–shells also show different reactivity for propylene activation. Table 5 lists all the energy barriers for propylene activation, including dehydrogenation, hydrogenation, oxidation, and C–C bond breaking. In selective hydrogen combustion, desorption of propylene is highly desired to inhibit the consumption of propylene. In this sense, it is of great importance to examine the competition between propylene desorption and other propylene activation reactions. Here the activation energy difference (Ereac – Edes) between the activation of propylene and desorption of propylene is defined as the selectivity descriptor, which has been used in our previous work. Ereac denotes the lowest energy barrier among all the activation of propylene. (5) A positive energy difference indicates that desorption is preferred. From Table 5, one can see that Co@Pt, Fe@Pt, Cu@Pt, Ni@Pt, Ru@Pt, and Ag@Pt have positive activation energy difference. That is, the core–shell catalysts with lower d-band show higher selectivity toward gaseous propylene. For selective hydrogen oxidation in the presence of propylene, a good catalyst should meet two requirements: high activity for hydrogen oxidation and low conversion of propylene. Among these six core–shell catalysts, the highest activity for H2 oxidation is achieved on Ag@Pt, which is therefore the best candidate for the catalyst.
4 Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In summary, we have systematically examined the reaction mechanism for the oxidation of hydrogen and propylene on Pt(111) by employing density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling. Three possible reaction pathways are taken into account for hydrogen oxidation. The microkinetic analysis shows that the O2 dissociation pathway is the dominant reaction pathway, and the dissociation of O2 has the slowest reaction rate and is the rate-limiting step.
Dehydrogenation of C3 species is slightly inhibited by the coadsorption of oxidants. The OH oxidation pathway of C3 species is kinetically more favorable than the O oxidation pathway. With the comparison between the energy barriers for dehydrogenation and oxidation, propyne is found to be the starting point for C3 oxidation.
The reactivity of 11 M@Pt core–shell surfaces for the oxidation of both hydrogen and propylene is investigated. Among them, Co@Pt, Fe@Pt, Cu@Pt, Ni@Pt, Ru@Pt, and Ag@Pt have a positive activation energy difference between propylene activation and propylene desorption, indicating a high selectivity toward gaseous propylene. On the other hand, Ag@Pt shows the highest reaction rate for H2 oxidation. Considering both the catalytic activity for hydrogen oxidation and selectivity toward propylene, Ag@Pt is the best candidate for selective hydrogen oxidation in the presence of propylene.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
