Small-Molecule Modification Provides Pt Nucleation Sites for Enhanced Propane Dehydrogenation Performance
Abstract
The rational synthesis of catalysts with controllable structures and the study of their structure–activity relationships to break the limitations of traditional catalysts remain challenging. Herein, tetrakis(dimethylamido)tin (TDMASn) exposures were used to modify silicalite-1 (S-1) lacking suitable chemisorption sites on their surfaces to provide Pt nucleation sites, obtaining a Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 sample. For comparison, Pt species supported on bare S-1 (Pt/S-1) and Pt species supported on the S-1 of pre-deposited SnO2 (Pt/20SnO2/S-1) were also prepared. Catalysts were characterized extensively by X-ray diffraction, temperature-programmed reduction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy of adsorbed CO. The results showed that this surface modification (TDMASn or SnO2) yielded up to about a 40-times increase in Pt content after 20 cycles of Pt atomic layer deposition (ALD). Compared with Pt/20SnO2/S-1, Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 had a smaller particle size, stronger interactions between the metal species and the support, and a lower Sn0 content, thus resulting in a remarkably higher initial propane conversion in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction. The catalytic activity could also be optimized based on the number of ALD-TDMASn exposures. As a consequence, Sn not only provided nucleation sites for Pt but also acted as a promoter to enhance the catalyst performance. This fundamental understanding will help researchers obtain suitable catalysts for PDH processes.

Catalysts are widely utilized to accelerate chemical reactions in various applications, including industrial syntheses, energy conversion processes, and environment pollution control. (1−4) Designing and obtaining catalysts with the desired activity, selectivity, and stability are essential. (5) In general, the catalytic performances of catalysts strongly depend on the size of the active particles. (6,7) The precise configuration of the catalyst is the key to clarifying the catalytic mechanism and designing new high-efficiency catalysts, and it is the focus of the research on heterogeneous catalysis. (8,9) Therefore, it is urgent to develop new methods to precisely control the nucleation of active particles.
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is an outstanding technique for depositing nanoparticles or thin films, which can precisely control the deposition process at the atomic level through its unique abilities. (10−14) Lu and co-workers synthesized Pt2 dimers by performing one additional cycle of Pt ALD by alternately exposing trimethyl(methylcyclopentadienyl)platinum (MeCpPtMe3) and molecular O3 at 150 °C to ensure chemisorption of only one MeCpPtMe3 molecule on a Pt1/graphene single-atom catalyst, where O2 was selected at 250 °C to prevent the creation of any additional nucleation sites. (15) Qin and co-workers proposed a new high-temperature pulsed ozone strategy to controllably pre-create abundant in-plane epoxy groups on graphene as anchoring sites, which was combined with ALD technology to enable the controllable synthesis of single-atom, dimer, and cluster catalysts. (16) Effective ALD approaches are important and necessary to build precise composite catalysts. (17−19) However, for some supports, due to the lack of nucleation sites, it is difficult to exploit the advantages of ALD to regulate particle nucleation, hindering the improvement of the catalyst performance.
In this work, tetrakis(dimethylamido)tin (TDMASn) exposures were used to modify silicalite-1 (S-1) to provide Pt nucleation sites, obtaining Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 sample. For comparison, Pt species supported on bare S-1 (Pt/S-1) and Pt species supported on the S-1 of pre-deposited SnO2 (Pt/20SnO2/S-1) were also prepared. The structure and chemical properties of the catalysts were characterized by various characterization experiments. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and inductively coupled plasma (ICP) results showed that the modification of TDMASn/SnO2 as nucleation sites shows promise function in improving the Pt ALD, yielding up to about a 40-times increase in the Pt content at 20 cycles of Pt ALD. Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 exhibited a remarkably higher initial propane conversion (36.46%) in the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction than Pt/20SnO2/S-1(9.28%). Compared with Pt/20SnO2/S-1, Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 had a smaller particle size, stronger interactions between the metal species and the support, and a lower Sn0 content, thus improving the surface active sites favorability for the propane conversion. The influences of the Sn and Pt ratio on the PDH performance over the Pt/xTDMASn/S-1 catalysts were also explored.

2.1. Synthesis of S-1
The S-1 zeolite was prepared by the hydrothermal synthesis method as described previously. (20) Briefly, it was synthesized with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH), and deionized water with the chemical compositions of 1 SiO2:0.4 TPAOH:35 H2O. First, TPAOH was mixed with water, and then a certain amount of TEOS was dropped into the above solution. After stirring at room temperature for 12 h, the resulting gel was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and crystallized at 170 °C with rotation (15 rpm) for 72 h. Finally, the obtained product was filtered, washed to neutrality, dried at 100 °C for 12 h, and calcined at 600 °C for 10 h to remove the template to obtain S-1.
2.2. Catalyst Preparation
First, 20 mg of S-1 dispersed in ethanol was spread out on a quartz wafer and dried in air, and then it was transferred to the ALD reactor. The ALD process was carried out in a hot-wall, closed-chamber-type ALD reactor using ultrahigh-purity N2 (99.999%) as the carrier gas. Pt particles were deposited at 250 °C with MeCpPtMe3 (Strem Chemicals, 99%) and O3 as precursors. MeCpPtMe3 was held at 65 °C. The pulse, exposure, and purge times for MeCpPtMe3 were 0.5, 14, and 35 s, respectively, and the corresponding O3 values were 0.1, 12, and 30 s. SnO2 was deposited at 150 °C in the ALD reactor with TDMASn (Strem Chemicals, 99.99%) and deionized water as precursors by ALD. TDMASn was held at 65 °C. The pulse, exposure, and purge times were 3, 30, and 35 s for TDMASn and 0.1, 8, and 25 s for deionized water, respectively.
2.2.1. Synthesis of the Pt/S-1 Catalyst
This sample was obtained by directly depositing 20 cycles of Pt on S-1 and then reducing.
2.2.2. Synthesis of the Pt/xTDMASn/S-1 Catalyst
First, S-1 was modified with the TDMASn for x exposures. Then, 20 cycles of Pt deposition and the following reduction were performed.
2.2.3. Synthesis of the Pt/20SnO2/S-1 Catalyst
The catalyst obtained through 20 cycles of SnO2 deposition, 20 cycles of Pt deposition, and reduction was named Pt/20SnO2/S-1.
In the reduction process, the samples were heated to 550 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min under a 5% H2/Ar atmosphere and maintained for 1 h.
2.3. Catalyst Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source (40 kV, 100 mA). Measurements were conducted in the 2θ range of 5–50° with a scanning speed of 2° min–1.
The morphology and size of the metal Pt particles were observed by TEM using a JEM-2100F field-emission transmission electron microscope with an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The samples were dispersed in ethanol by ultrasonication and supported on carbon-film-coated copper grids before TEM images were recorded.
N2 physical adsorption–desorption experiments on the samples were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 HD88-type gas adsorption instrument at −196 °C to determine the textural properties, for which the samples were outgassed at 200 °C under a high vacuum for 8 h prior to the measurement. The specific surface area was determined using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and the total pore volume was estimated with nitrogen adsorption at a relative pressure of 0.99. The micropore volume and micropore surface area were determined by the t-plot method. In addition, the micropore size distributions of the samples were estimated by Horvath–Kawazoe (H-K).
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on an AXIS ULTRA DLD spectrometer (Shimadzu/Kratos) with the Al Kα line as the excitation source. Sn 3d and Pt 4f spectra were collected to elucidate the electronic states and relative surface contents of the Sn and Pt species.
The diffuse-reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) data was collected using a Bruker Tensor II spectrometer.
H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) measurements were performed on a Micromeritics Auto Chem II 2920 apparatus. Typically, the samples were pretreated with Ar at 400 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 50 °C, 10 vol % H2/Ar was allowed to pass through the catalyst bed and then heated to 800 °C at a ramping rate of 10 °C min–1.
2.4. Catalyst Tests
The catalytic reaction for PDH was carried out at atmospheric pressure and 550 °C in a quartz fixed-bed reactor with a 10 mm inner diameter, 20 mm outer diameter, and 54 cm length. Prior to the test, 0.1 g of catalyst mixed with 1.5 g of quartz sand was reduced at 550 °C under H2/N2 for 1 h with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. Afterward, H2/N2 was replaced by a PDH reaction mixture of C3H8 (25 vol %) in N2 at a total flow of 20 mL/min. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was 5.4 h–1. The product gas was analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) to determine the amounts of H2, C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, C2H6, and CH4 in the products.

3.1. Catalyst Preparation and Characterization
A schematic illustration of the preparation process of the catalyst is shown in Figure 1. The catalyst obtained by directly depositing 20 cycles of Pt on the support followed by reduction was named Pt/S-1. Pt/xTDMASn/S-1 was obtained by modifying the support with the TDMASn for x exposures, depositing 20 cycles of Pt, followed by reduction. The catalyst obtained by depositing SnO2 for 20 cycles and Pt for 20 cycles followed by reduction was named Pt/20SnO2/S-1. In the reduction process, the samples were heated to 550 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C/min under a 5% H2/Ar atmosphere and maintained for 1 h.

The in situ DRIFTS spectrum for the TDMASn ALD process on S-1 is shown in Figure 2A. This process was investigated in an in situ DRIFTS and ALD system (ALD-DRIFTS) at 150 °C. After TDMASn exposure, the removal of the functional −OH groups on the surface was observed, as indicated by the decreased absorbance at 3750–3450 cm–1. (21) At the same time, the characteristic features of the alkylamino ligands could be distinguished. The −CH3 asymmetric stretching vibration peak at 2940 cm–1, the −NMe2 stretching vibration peak at 2770 cm–1, the C–H stretching deformation peaks at 1564 and 1314 cm–1, the C–N stretching vibration peak at 1178 cm–1, and the −NC2 stretching vibration peak at 970 cm–1 were observed. (21−24) Their characteristic peak intensities increased gradually with the increase in the TDMASn exposure number, which proved that the TDMASn was successfully modified on the surface of S-1. It could be seen from the infrared and XPS spectra of TDMASn/S-1 and SnO2/S-1 (Figure S1) that there were more organic ligands on TDMASn/S-1 because there was no pulse H2O to remove them. A schematic of the surface chemistry during the TDMASn ALD is shown in Figure 2B. The surface reaction involved in the process was

TEM revealed the morphologies and microstructures of the catalysts. There were only few particles on Pt/S-1, while a large number of particles existed on Pt/xTDMASn/S-1 and Pt/20SnO2/S-1 (Figures 3A–D and Figures S2 and S3). It can be concluded that modification of TDMASn and SnO2 provided Pt nucleation sites. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings of Pt/SnO2/S-1 and Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 further revealed that Pt and Sn were uniformly dispersed on the S-1 (Figure S4). The average particle sizes of Pt/S-1, Pt/20SnO2/S-1, Pt/20TDMASn/S-1, and Pt/200TDMASn/S-1 before reduction were 1.0, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.6 nm, respectively (insets of Figure S2A–D). After reduction, the particle size increased to 2.2, 3.7, 2.7, and 2.8 nm, respectively (insets of Figure 3A–D). The particle sizes of Pt/20SnO2/S-1 and Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 were the same when they were not reduced, while after reduction, Pt/20SnO2/S-1 showed a larger particle size than Pt/20TDMASn/S-1. In addition, it can be seen from Figure S3 that the particle sizes of Pt/xTDMASn/S-1 (x = 10, 20, 40, 50, 100, and 200) were 2.5, 2.7, 2.7, 2.7, 2.6, and 2.8 nm, respectively, indicating that the number of exposures of TDMASn had no evident effect on the particle size. The presence of metallic phases on the catalysts was revealed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Figure 3E–H shows the micrographs of the reduced catalysts, which indicate the presence of individual particles with clear lattice fringes. The lattice distance of Pt nanoparticles on Pt/S-1 was measured to be 0.223 nm (Figure 3E), corresponding to the Pt (111) plane. (26) The measured lattice distances of ∼0.20, ∼0.30, and ∼ 0.36 nm (Figure 3F–H) matched well with the (110), (101), and (100) planes of the PtSn alloy, respectively. (27,28) The Pt contents in the catalysts were measured using ICP-AES to be 0.034, 1.42, 1.36, and 1.32% for Pt/S-1, Pt/20SnO2/S-1, Pt/20TDMASn/S-1, and Pt/200TDMASn/S-1, respectively, and the Sn contents were measured to be 2.57, 1.96, and 5.30% for Pt/20SnO2/S-1, Pt/20TDMASn/S-1, and Pt/200TDMASn/S-1, respectively. The results showed that this surface modification exerted a strong influence on the Pt ALD nucleation, yielding up to about a 40-times increase in the Pt content at 20 cycles of Pt ALD.

To illustrate the pore structures of the catalysts, N2 physical adsorption and desorption tests were carried out (Figure 4A,B). The type-I isotherms of all the samples showed high nitrogen uptakes at low relative pressures and well-defined plateaus, indicating the typical characteristic of microporous materials. (29) The pore size distribution diagram (Figure 4B) can also illustrate this point. Table 1 summarizes the specific surface area and pore structure parameters of these samples. All the samples had similar pore distribution. Compared with Pt/S-1, the specific surface area of the Sn-containing catalysts decreased with the increase in the Pt and Sn loadings. These results imply that more Pt and Sn species may have blocked some micropore channels in S-1.

The XRD patterns are shown in Figure 4C. In all catalysts, five characteristic diffraction peaks were found at 2θ = 7.9, 8.8, 23.1, 23.8, and 24.3°, corresponding to the reflections of the MFI-type zeolite framework. (30) The characteristic diffraction peak positions of the supported metal catalysts were consistent with those of the support S-1, and no diffraction peaks of Pt, Sn, or the Pt–Sn alloy were observed due to the low loading and/or high dispersion of Pt particles. (28,31)
H2-TPR was performed to investigate the interactions between the catalyst support and the metal particles (Figure 4D). For the Pt/S-1 sample, there was a broad and weak reduction peak at 280 °C that could be assigned to the reduction of Pt oxide species interacting with S-1. (32) For 20SnO2/S-1, two reduction peaks were generated: the peak at 250 °C was attributed to the reduction of Sn4+ to Sn2+, while the peak at 450 °C clearly indicated the reduction of Sn4+ or Sn2+ to Sn0. (33) The reduction peaks of Pt/20SnO2/S-1, Pt/20TDMASn/S-1, and Pt/200TDMASn/S-1 appeared at 320, 350, and 380 °C, respectively, which can be attributed to the reduction of Pt and Sn species. (34) Compared with the peak of Pt/20SnO2/S-1, the reduction peak of Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 appeared at a higher temperature, demonstrating that the interaction between the metal species and the support was stronger. (35,36) Compared with Pt/20TDMASn/S-1, the reduction peak of Pt/200TDMASn/S-1 increased in intensity and appeared at a higher temperature, which may be attributed to the large increase in the Sn content in Pt/200TDMASn/S-1.
XPS was performed to investigate the surface chemical states of Pt and Sn (Figure 5A,B). The XPS fitting results were summarized in Table S1. For Pt/S-1, there was only one peak at 71.5 eV corresponding to Pt0 after reduction. (37) The Pt 4f spectra of Pt/20SnO2/S-1, Pt/20TDMASn/S-1, and Pt/200TDMASn/S-1 were fitted by three doublets, which were attributed to the existence of Pt0, Pt2+, and Pt4+ (Table S1). The ratios of metallic Pt0 species on Pt/SnO2/S-1, Pt/20TDMASn/S-1, and Pt/200TDMASn/S-1 were 57, 62, and 52%, respectively. With the increase in the TDMASn loading, the signal of Pt0 shifted toward lower binding energies, illustrating that the transfer of electrons from tin to platinum was promoted. As shown in Figure 5B, binding energies of 486.9 and 495.3 eV, corresponding to the Sn 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 photoelectrons, respectively, were observed for all Sn-containing samples. The Sn 3d XPS spectra of Pt/20SnO2/S-1, Pt/20TDMASn/S-1, and Pt/200TDMASn/S-1 confirmed the presence of Sn0 (485.3 eV) and Snx+ (486.7 eV) in all the catalysts. (31,33,37−39) The ratios of metallic Sn0 species on Pt/SnO2/S-1, Pt/20TDMASn/S-1, and Pt/200TDMASn/S-1 were 17, 5, and 4%, respectively (Table S1). The ratio of Sn0 species on Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 was lower than that on Pt/20 SnO2/S-1, indicating that the reduction of Sn species became more difficult, which is consistent with the H2-TPR results.

The DRIFTS spectra of adsorbed CO on the Pt/S-1 and Pt/xTDMASn/S-1 catalysts are shown in Figure S5. No CO adsorption band was observed in Pt/S-1, which may be because the loading of Pt was low. However, all the Pt/xTDMASn/S-1 catalysts showed a broad frequency band in the range of 2000–2100 cm–1, which can be attributed to the CO linearly adsorbed on the Pt nanoparticles. (40) This suggested a larger amount of surface Pt atoms of Pt/xTDMASn/S-1 catalysts compared to that of Pt/S-1. The intensity of the peak related to the linear Pt–CO adsorption for the Pt/xTDMASn/S-1 catalyst decreased with the increase in the number of TDMASn exposures, suggesting that a lower amount of surface Pt atoms, which could be attributed to the possible coverage of Sn0 on the Pt surface with negligible CO adsorption. (41) Furthermore, the redshift of linearly adsorbed CO peaks was observed with the increase in the TDMASn exposure number, indicating electron transfer from Sn to Pt. (42)
3.2. Catalytic Performance for PDH
The dehydrogenation of propane is an important chemical reaction since propylene is the most important type of compound in the chemical industry as chemical building blocks. (43) The catalytic performances for PDH of the Pt/S-1, Pt/20SnO2/S-1, and Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 catalysts are shown in Figure 6A–C, which show the variations of the propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and propylene yield as functions of time on stream, respectively. The initial conversion of Pt/S-1 was about 1.14% with a propylene selectivity of 97.08%. The activity and propylene selectivity decreased quickly in the first few hours of the reaction. The propane conversion decreased dramatically from 1.14 to 0.27%, and the propylene selectivity decreased from 97.08 to 83.67% in the initial 2 h (likely due to carbon deposits). Among the three catalysts, the Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 catalyst showed the highest initial propane conversion (36.46%) because it had the highest content of Pt0 to provide active sites in the PDH process. (33) There may be two reasons that the initial propane conversion of Pt/20SnO2/S-1 (9.28%) was lower than that of Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 (36.46%). The first was that the particle size (3.7 nm) of Pt/20SnO2/S-1 was larger than that of Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 (2.7 nm), resulting in a large reduction of active sites. The second was that the Sn0 content in Pt/20SnO2/S-1 (17%) was greater than that in Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 (4%), which could permanently poison the active sites. (44) Accounting for the propylene selectivity, both the Pt/20SnO2/S-1 and Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 catalysts exhibited excellent properties with a C–C bond cleavage byproduct selectivity of less than 1%, demonstrating that the Sn-modified catalysts were highly selective for the dehydrogenation reaction and suppressed the undesirable C–C bond dissociation side reactions. (43) These results demonstrate that the catalytic performance of Pt/S-1 can be enhanced via ALD-TDMASn exposure modification prior to Pt deposition. This strategy is a feasible method to enhance catalytic performance.

The ratio of Pt and Sn also greatly affects the dehydrogenation performance of propane. (31) To determine the optimal ratio of Pt and Sn, PDH tests using the synthesized catalysts with different numbers of TDMASn exposures were performed, as shown in Figure 6D–F. The initial conversion of Pt/10TDMASn/S-1 was 35.18%, which was similar to that of Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 (36.46%), but the conversion of Pt/10TDMASn/S-1 decreased rapidly at the same time. As the Sn content was increased (TDMASn exposure numbers from 10 to 20), the stability of the catalyst was improved. The initial propane conversions for Pt/20TDMASn/S-1, Pt/40TDMASn/S-1, Pt/50TDMASn/S-1, Pt/100TDMASn/S-1, and Pt/200TDMASn/S-1 were 36.46, 32.12, 25.09, 20.14, and 9.25%, respectively. This showed that the catalytic performance decreased with the increase in the TDMASn exposure number from 20 to 200, possibly because excessive Sn poisoned the active sites. It can be concluded that maximized activity was achieved via adjustment of the TDMASn to 20 exposures.
4. Discussion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In this work, the growth characteristics of Pt ALD on S-1 were dramatically changed after modifying with ALD-TDMASn exposures. In situ DRIFTS demonstrated that the TDMASn species were successfully deposited on the support surface. The TEM and ICP results showed that this surface modification exerted a strong influence on the Pt ALD nucleation, yielding up to about a 40-times increase in the Pt content at 20 cycles of Pt ALD. The initial conversion of PDH was related to the Pt content, and the performance test proved that Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 (36.46%) had higher initial propane conversion than Pt/S-1 (1.14%). It can be seen from the Table S2 that Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 shows better catalytic performance than other published Pt/SnO2/Al2O3 obtained using the impregnation method.
The SnO2 pre-deposited on S-1 could also provide Pt nucleation sites. The increase in the Pt content in the Pt/20SnO2/S-1 sample could be seen from the ICP results. The surface hydroxyl groups are referred to as reaction sites for the reaction illustrated in Figure 2B, so TDMASn forms a single monolayer on the S-1 support. The previous literature showed that the growth of SnO2 was Stranski–Krastanov. (45) It could be seen from the TEM that the particle size of Pt/20SnO2/S-1 (3.7 nm) was larger than that of Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 (2.7 nm). This result corresponded to weaker interactions between the metal species and the support of Pt/20SnO2/S-1, which was in good agreement with the H2-TPR results. Moreover, the more reduced Sn0 could cover the Pt sites, thus resulting in decreased Pt dispersion, which finally had negative effects on the conversion of propane.
The effects of the Sn and Pt ratio on the PDH performance over the Pt/xTDMASn/S-1 catalysts were further optimized. It can be seen from CO DRIFTS results that with the increase in x (20–200), the surface content of Pt in the Pt/xTDMASn/S-1 sample was rather low, which was directly related to the low catalytic activity in propane conversion. This demonstrated that a significant improvement in the catalyst performance and maximized activity could be achieved by applying 20 ALD-TDMASn exposures.
5. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In this study, TDMASn modification on S-1 was used to enhance Pt nucleation. The organic ligands of the adsorbed TDMASn precursor modified the surface of the support, providing Pt nucleation sites. Compared with Pt/20SnO2/S-1, Pt/20TDMASn/S-1 had a smaller particle size, stronger interactions between the metal species and the support, and a lower Sn0 content, which promoted propane conversion at the active sites. By optimizing the number of ALD-TDMASn exposures, the catalysts exhibited different catalytic performances for PDH. The results showed that Sn not only provided nucleation sites for Pt but also acted as a promoter to enhance the catalyst performance. This work may provide important guidance for the design and synthesis of stable dehydrogenation catalysts with high activity and selectivity.
