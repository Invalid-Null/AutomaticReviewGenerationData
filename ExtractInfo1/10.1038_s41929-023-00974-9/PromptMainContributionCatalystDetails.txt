Trapped by the germanium ring




The conditions employed for alkane dehydrogenation reactions are usually detrimental for catalyst stability. Now, subnanometre Pt clusters stabilized by the Ge-enriched double four-membered-ring units in a UTL-type zeolite structure show exceptionally high stability for this important transformation.
Supported subnanometre metal clusters exhibit superior catalytic performances in various reactions because of their unique geometric and electronic structural features in comparison to conventional larger nanoparticles1. However, similarly to the emerging single-atom catalysts, subnanometre metal clusters also suffer from stability issues due to their strong tendency towards sintering at high reaction temperatures.
Numerous strategies have been proposed to improve the stability of subnanometre metal clusters, among which confining metal clusters into rigid microporous frameworks has proven quite efficient for the generation of highly active and stable catalysts for high-temperature reactions2. For instance, bimetallic PtSn clusters with non-alloy structures can be selectively generated in the sinusoidal channels of pure-silica MFI zeolite, which exhibit remarkable performances for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene3,4. It should be noted that, after a long-term catalytic test under harsh conditions, Sn species may still migrate along the zeolite channels to form alloy or even intermetallic particles with Pt due to their reducibility, and the resultant highly alloyed or even intermetallic particles could be less active for activation of alkane molecules in comparison to the ones with a lower degree of alloying5. This limitation may also be encountered in other Pt-based bimetallic systems because the co-catalyst metals in most of the reported systems are reducible metals such as Ga, In, Zn, and so on6. Although the selective incorporation of noble metals (such as Pt and Ir) in the zeolite matrix has been achieved, the control of the spatial distribution of co-catalyst metal species in the zeolite matrix remains a challenge.
Now, writing in Nature Catalysis, Wu and colleagues report a synthesis method for the stabilization of subnanometre Pt clusters in a zeolite matrix by employing the germanium-enriched double four-membered rings (Ge-d4rs) of UTL-type zeolite as the anchoring sites7. Specifically, taking the UTL-type zeolites with a high Ge content as the precursor (Si/Ge = 4.7), a series of Ge-UTL zeolites with much higher stability were obtained after acid pickling treatment was used to control and lower Ge content in the final material. Thanks to the large pore dimensions of UTL-type zeolite compared to previously reported MFI-type zeolite, Pt species could be easily introduced into the zeolite channels via facile wet impregnation. Interestingly, the size distributions of the Pt particles are greatly dependent on the time of the acid pickling treatment. After condition optimization — that is, 2 hours of acid pickling — subnanometre Pt clusters with good dispersion are observed in the optimum Pt/Ge-UTL sample while the size of Pt species tends to become larger on UTL zeolites derived from either shorter or longer times of acid pickling treatment. Taking into account that the treatment mainly causes the removal of Ge species in the UTL zeolite framework, it is inferred that only part of the Ge species in specific positions accounts for the stabilization of Pt clusters.
The authors have further studied the location of the Pt clusters by the integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC-STEM) imaging technique, which suggests the Pt clusters are preferentially located in the 14-membered ring channels instead of the 12-membered ring channels (see Fig. 1a–b). Moreover, a combination of several spectroscopy characterizations (for example, X-ray absorption spectroscopy,19F solid-state NMR, synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction and full-range synchrotron pair distribution function analysis) suggests the formation of Pt4 clusters at the Ge-d4r units with two Ge atoms in the UTL zeolite structure. The bonding between the Pt4 clusters and the Ge-d4r units is ascribed to the formation of a Pt4–O–Ge linkage according to the theoretical modelling results. Notably, in comparison to the PtSn clusters stabilized in MFI zeolite with non-alloy structures, which feature Sn species randomly distributed in the MFI zeolite, the Ge species are located at a specific position of the UTL framework.

As shown in Fig. 1c, the optimum Pt/Ge-UTL catalyst exhibits remarkably high stability in the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The exceptionally high stabilization of the Pt/Ge-UTL catalyst could be ascribed to the unique bonding between the Pt clusters and the Ge-d4r units, and the high structural rigidity of Ge-d4r units under reaction conditions. In the case of other Pt-based bimetallic systems, the reducible co-catalyst metals (for example, Sn, Ga, In, Zn, and so on) mostly exist in the extra-framework positions and may eventually form Pt-based alloy particles in reductive atmosphere at high temperatures, which may cause a progressive decay in reactivity.
Considering the number of reported Ge-containing zeolite structures (>20) with diverse topological features8, the combination of extra-framework noble metals (such as Pt, Ir, Pd, Rh, and so on) and the Ge species in the framework could, in principle, lead to the generation of a vast family of bimetallic clusters with novel electronic properties. The resultant non-alloy bimetallic clusters may exhibit interesting catalytic behaviour for activation of various small molecules, such as light alkanes or alkenes, CO and CO2. Moreover, numerous Ge-containing zeolite structures comprise extra-large pores (>12-membered ring pores), and the reaction scope of the encapsulated metal species can be greatly extended to large substrates in comparison to those confined in conventional medium-pore (10-membered ring) and large-pore (12-membered ring) zeolites8,9. Though the Ge atoms prefer to be incorporated into the d4r units in the Ge silicate, the location of Ge atoms in the zeolite framework might be partly modified by varying the synthesis conditions10. If this can be achieved, it will be interesting to explore the optimum configuration of the Ge-containing units for the stabilization of the noble metal clusters. Another promising extension of this work could be the combination of co-catalyst metals at both framework and extra-framework positions for the stabilization of noble metal clusters as well as modification of their electronic properties. The resultant trimetallic clusters may show distinct catalytic behaviours compared to the reported bimetallic systems.
Despite the fascinating topological structures of Ge-containing zeolites, one critical issue that may limit their application in practical processes is still the relatively low stability in the presence of moisture compared to conventional pure-silica and silicoaluminate zeolites11. Though the propane dehydrogenation reaction works under dry conditions, a small amount of moisture could still be formed from the oxidation of coke deposited in the used catalyst during the occasional regeneration procedure, which could cause the deformation of the Ge-d4r units and further influence the long-term stability of the associated Pt clusters in practical alkane dehydrogenation processes. In this sense, the stability of the Ge-containing zeolites’ framework structures under hydrothermal conditions needs to be further addressed, and its realization will greatly extend the reaction scope of metal catalysts encapsulated in Ge-containing zeolites.
