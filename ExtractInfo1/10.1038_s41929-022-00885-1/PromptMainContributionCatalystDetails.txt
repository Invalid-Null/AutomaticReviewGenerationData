Peripheral-nitrogen effects on the Ru1 centre for highly efficient propane dehydrogenation

Abstract
Single-atom catalysts with uniform metal active sites show potential for selectivity control. However, their application to high-temperature propane dehydrogenation remains challenging. Here we develop a highly stable and efficient single-atom catalyst for propane dehydrogenation that is based on Ru single atoms on nitrogen-doped carbon (Ru1/NC). The turnover frequency of Ru1/NC is at least three times higher than that of nanoparticle counterparts, resulting in propylene selectivity of around 92% with a lower deactivation rate at 560 °C. Experimental and density functional theory studies reveal the important role of peripheral N species around the Ru1 centre. The inner-shell N stabilizes the atomically dispersed Ru to inhibit structure-sensitive propane cracking, while the outer-shell N promotes electron accumulation at the Ru1 centre, inducing a significant charge repulsion between Ru1 and propylene to facilitate its desorption. The combined functions of inner-shell and outer-shell N species at single-atom Ru sites contribute to the high efficiency of Ru1/NC.

Main
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene has attracted significant attention because of the increasing demand of propylene and the abundant supply of propane from shale gas1,2,3. PDH is such a highly endothermic reaction that high temperatures (≥500 °C) are required for effective propane conversion4,5. However, high temperature favours side reactions, including cracking, hydrogenolysis and deep dehydrogenation, which not only reduce the selectivity of propylene but also cause coke deposition and catalyst deactivation6,7. Numerous studies have shown that PDH is a structure-sensitive reaction, where many active metals favour C–C bond breaking that leads to side reactions, whereas active site isolation or single-atom catalysts (SACs) are effective for the PDH process to generate propylene8. Moreover, desorption of propylene from the active sites is crucial for improving selectivity, and this is largely influenced by the electronic state of the active metal9,10. Therefore, a rational design of isolated active sites with tunable local structures is attractive for efficient PDH to produce propylene.
Usually modifications of Pt with a second metal to form single-atom alloy (SAA), intermetallic alloy or other bimetallic catalysts, such as Pt1Cu, Pt1Zn4, PtSn, PtGa and PtIn, are effective for the PDH reaction11,12,13,14,15,16. The spatially isolated Pt sites and electron donation from a second metal to the Pt centre can effectively inhibit cleavage of the C–C bond, thus improving the selectivity of propylene. However, discriminating the coordination environment of the active site is rather challenging in such cases9,17,18,19. Comparatively, SACs with a single metal species are not only expected to achieve efficient conversion of propane to propylene but also provide a good platform to reveal the nature of the active sites. However, stabilizing the single-atom active sites at high temperature (≥500 °C) and under the reducing atmosphere of the PDH reaction is very challenging.
The development of alternative catalysts, at low cost and high stability, to replace the industrial Pt-based catalysts is a long-term pursuit for the PDH reaction. Ru metal, which is relatively inexpensive among the noble metals, has rarely been considered, probably due to its propensity to activate C–H and C–C bonds, thus resulting in problems of low propylene selectivity and easy catalyst deactivation20. Given the special catalytic properties of single-atom sites, isolated Ru species are distinct from bulk metal, making Ru highly selective in reactions related to the inhibition of coke formation, such as CH4 reforming and CO2 hydrogenation21,22. However, the development of stable Ru SACs for a high-efficiency, high-temperature PDH reaction is still a great challenge and requires a deeper level of insight into structure–activity properties for such catalyst formulations. Interest in M–N–C (where M refers to transition metals) materials has recently flourished in the rational design of stable SACs due to strong covalent bonding between the N species and M1 metal23,24,25, which can also facilitate tuning of the M1 local structure to change the geometry and electronic state of the single-atom sites. In particular, M–N–C catalysts have been widely developed in the field of electrocatalysis, for example, in the oxygen reduction reaction and CO2 reduction reaction26,27. However, to date most studies have focused on regulation of inner-shell coordination N species28,29,30, whereas the effect of the outer-shell N species on single-atom sites and catalytic properties has attracted little attention.
Here we report a robust catalyst for the high-temperature PDH reaction based on Ru single atoms anchored on N-doped carbon (Ru1/NC), where the Ru1 centre is surrounded by peripheral N species. The Ru1/NC SAC features high conversion and propylene selectivity and exhibits high stability at 520 °C for 100 h on stream with a low deactivation rate (kd) of 0.0029 h−1, which is superior to Ru nanoparticles. Various experimental tests and density functional theory (DFT) calculations then unravel the critical role of peripheral N species from the inner and outer shell on the Ru1 centre for the enhanced performance in the PDH reaction.
Results
Ru single atoms surrounded by N species on NC support
The synthetic process of Ru single atoms anchored on N-doped carbon (NC), denoted as Ru1/NC, is shown in Fig. 1a. A mixture of ruthenium acetylacetonate (Ru(acac)3), L-alanine (C3H7NO2) and dicyandiamide (C2H4N4) was ground evenly using the ball-milling method, followed by pyrolysis under N2 atmosphere at 900 °C for 1 h. The Ru content over Ru1/NC is 1.2 wt%, based on inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. For comparison, catalysts with an Ru loading of 1.3 and 6.0 wt% on NC, denoted as 1RuNP/NC and 6RuNP/NC, respectively, were synthesized using the impregnation method. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images of Ru1/NC at different image magnifications (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1) do not show any Ru nanoparticles. Furthermore, aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM (AC-HAADF-STEM) reveals that a large number of uniformly dispersed Ru single atoms are clearly observed over Ru1/NC (Fig. 1c,d). Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) was conducted to characterize the local element distribution and coordination around Ru single atoms. As displayed in Fig. 1e, both Ru/C (the EELS spectra of Ru and C are overlapped) and N spectra are detected when the electron beam is focused on an individual Ru single atom, demonstrating Ru1 is bonded to N/C rather than O, which is consistent with the previously reported M–N–C catalysts31,32. The elemental mapping images (Fig. 1f) of Ru1/NC by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy show that Ru, N and C are homogeneously dispersed. For comparison, Ru nanoparticles can be discerned clearly over 1RuNP/NC and 6RuNP/NC by HAADF-STEM (Supplementary Figs. 2a and 3a). Statistical analysis for approximately 200 particles shows that the average particle sizes of Ru metal over 1RuNP/NC and 6RuNP/NC are 1.1 and 2.3 nm, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 2b and 3b). These results demonstrate that the single-atom Ru sites over NC support can be successfully obtained via high-temperature pyrolysis, which is derived from the polymerization and condensation reactions of N-containing precursors to capture the Ru single atoms.

To obtain the Ru valence state and detailed structural information of the Ru1/NC catalyst, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy were performed. The XANES spectra show that the absorption edge position of Ru1/NC (Fig. 2a and inset figure) is located between that of Ru foil and Ru(acac)3 (close to the former), suggesting the chemical state of Ru species over Ru1/NC is slightly positive. Moreover, the absorption edge position of 6RuNP/NC is near to Ru foil, indicating the chemical state of Ru species is close to metallic (Supplementary Fig. 4a). In EXAFS spectra (Fig. 2b), Ru1/NC presents a prominent peak at 1.53 Å, which, in combination with the EELS results, corresponds to Ru–N/C coordination. No typical peaks for Ru–Ru (2.40 Å) and Ru–O–Ru (3.20 Å) coordination can be observed, which excludes the presence of metallic Ru or RuOx nanoparticles. Notably, a small peak at 2.3 Å over Ru1/NC could be assigned to Ru–C scattering at the second shell or to the effect of side lobes and the multiple scattering paths between the light atoms33. In contrast, Ru–Ru coordination (2.40 Å) can be observed clearly over 1RuNP/NC and 6RuNP/NC (Supplementary Fig. 4b), and the Ru–Ru coordination number increases with the increase in Ru particle size (Supplementary Table 1). The wavelet transform technique demonstrates the absence of Ru–Ru coordination over Ru1/NC. As depicted in Fig. 2c, Ru foil presents a lobe at R and K values of (2.4 Å, 9.2 Å−1), which can be ascribed to Ru–Ru coordination. In contrast, the lobe at low R and K values (1.5 Å and 4.0 Å−1, respectively) over Ru1/NC is attributable to Ru–N/C coordination. Fitting analysis of the EXAFS spectra (Supplementary Table 1) reveals that the average coordination number is 3.9, suggesting the dominant Ru–N(C)4 coordination structure in Ru1/NC. Additionally, the simulated results of Ru1/NC based on our depicted model are consistent with the experimental results (Fig. 2e and Supplementary Fig. 5), ensuring the rationality of the model.

To investigate the profiles of elemental composition and chemical states over these catalysts, we performed X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The binding energy of the Ru 2p3/2 peak of 6RuNP/NC is 461.7 eV (Supplementary Fig. 6a), indicating the presence of metallic Ru34. As the Ru particle size decreases, the binding energy increases to 462.0 eV on 1RuNP/NC. For Ru single atoms, this value further increases to 462.1 eV, which is, however, lower than that of the Ru3+ species (~463.2 eV). These results suggest the Ru single atoms on Ru1/NC have a slightly positive charge, which is consistent with the XANES results (Fig. 2a and inset). The N 1s spectra (Supplementary Fig. 6b) of Ru1/NC can be deconvoluted into five characteristic peaks with binding energies of ~398.0, 399.3, 400.5, 401.3 and 402.5 eV, which are assigned to pyridinic N, Ru–N, pyrrolic N, graphitic N and oxidized N, respectively28,32. Compared with 1RuNP/NC and 6RuNP/NC, the higher-content N species of Ru–N can be found over Ru1/NC through the normalized different surface N contents from XPS results (Supplementary Table 2), which demonstrates there are more N species to anchor Ru centres over Ru1/NC. Furthermore, the mass ratio of N to Ru over Ru1/NC is near 14 (Supplementary Table 2), indicating there are many N species distributed in the NC support apart from the Ru–N(C)4 moieties. In particular, the abundant electron-rich N species play an essential role in the electronic states of Ru1 sites along with their catalytic performance, which is proven by the following DFT calculations (see below). These results demonstrate the Ru1/NC SAC with Ru–N(C)4 moieties surrounded by N-rich carbon support is synthesized successfully and has a slightly positively charged Ru1 centre.
Catalytic performance in the high-temperature PDH reaction
The catalytic performance of PDH was measured over these catalysts after prereduction under 10% H2/Ar at 600 °C for 1 h. As shown in Fig. 3a, propane conversion increases gradually along with reaction temperature from 520 to 600 °C on Ru1/NC, while propylene selectivity is maintained above 92%. At 600 °C, the conversion of propane reaches 33% at a propylene selectivity of 92% over Ru1/NC (Fig. 3b). For comparison, the 1RuNP/NC catalyst, with similar Ru content, results in a much lower propane conversion (9%) and propylene selectivity (64%). Even with higher-content Ru loading, propane conversion on 6RuNP/NC only increases to 20%, which is still inferior to that of Ru1/NC. Moreover, selectivity to propylene is only 25% over 6RuNP/NC. These results indicate that cleavage of propane’s C–C bond and coke formation are very feasible on a larger Ru particle, thus resulting in low propylene selectivity.

Moreover, there is almost no propane conversion over NC material (Fig. 3b), suggesting the high performance of Ru1/NC originates from the contribution of the Ru single-atom centre. To investigate the effect of peripheral nitrogen on Ru1 sites, Ru1 on activated carbon (Ru1/AC) and Ru1/NC with a low Ru loading of 0.1 wt% (0.1Ru1/NC) were prepared for comparison. AC-HAADF-STEM images with different magnifications (Supplementary Fig. 7) present the single-atom dispersion of Ru without any nanoparticles over AC support. The PDH activity test shows that the initial selectivity of propylene over 0.1Ru1/NC (94%) is superior to that over 0.1Ru1/AC (79%) at 600 °C under similar propane conversion (Supplementary Fig. 8), demonstrating the positive effect of nitrogen species on propylene selectivity. Furthermore, the coordination structure of the Ru1 site was regulated by altering the pyrolysis temperature to demonstrate its effect on PDH. The fitting results of EXAFS (Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 9) show the average coordination number of N/C on the Ru1 site is 4.9 on Ru1/NC-700 (Ru1/NC prepared by pyrolysis at 700 °C), which is higher than that of 3.9 over Ru1/NC. Supplementary Figure 10 shows that the propane conversion of Ru1/NC-700 is 22%, with a propylene selectivity of 94% at 600 °C, which is inferior to that of Ru1/NC. These results demonstrate the unique property of Ru–N(C)4 moieties over NC support for efficient PDH to propylene.
To reflect the intrinsic high performance of the Ru1/NC catalyst, we measured the specific rate of the production of propylene per metal sites in the kinetic region. As shown in Fig. 3c, the specific rate of propylene production increases as the size of the Ru particle decreases, and the rate of propylene production is best on Ru1/NC. Combined with the selectivity shown in Fig. 3b, these results demonstrate that catalytic performance of PDH is closely correlated with Ru particle size. Moreover, the specific rate can reach 428 molC3H6 molRu−1 h−1 with a propylene selectivity of approximately 92% over Ru1/NC under a high concentration of 40% C3H8 (Fig. 3c). In comparison with previous catalysts, the performance of Ru1/NC is lower than that of some typical PtSn/Al2O3 (nanosheet Al2O3 as a support)16 and PtCu/Al2O3 (ref. 11) catalysts in terms of specific rate, whereas it is superior to that of PtIn (ref. 35), PtGa (ref. 36) and Ru- (ref. 20), Pd- (ref. 37), V- (ref. 38) and Cr-based39 catalysts, as shown in Supplementary Table 3. In terms of propylene productivity and turnover frequency (TOF) on the basis of the concentration of surface Ru atoms, Ru1/NC is associated with values least three times higher than those of 1RuNP/NC and 6RuNP/NC, as shown in Supplementary Table 4 and Fig. 11. In particular, propylene productivity of Ru1/NC is 0.635 gC3H6 gcat−1 h−1, which is close to that of commercial PtSn/Al2O3 (0.644 gC3H6 gcat−1 h−1). These results suggest that Ru1/NC could be one of the best-performing catalysts for PDH reported so far.
Catalyst stability is an essential parameter for PDH in practical application. As shown in Fig. 3d, propane conversion evidently decreases from 9 to 4% over 6RuNP/NC after only 12 h time on stream at 520 °C, while propylene selectivity increases from 28 to 60%. This decreased reactivity could be due to aggregation of Ru nanoparticles, whereas increased selectivity of propylene is because of coke deposition covering unselective sites40. A similar phenomenon is also observed over 1RuNP/NC. In contrast, over the Ru1/NC catalyst, propane conversion decreases only slightly and propylene selectivity remains more than 95% after a 100 h run. The kd based on a first-order deactivation mechanism was then calculated to evaluate the stability of the catalyst. The kd value on Ru1/NC is only 0.0029 h−1, which is an order of magnitude lower than the 0.0720 h−1 over 6RuNP/NC and 0.0550 h−1 over 1RuNP/NC. Notably, the kd value over Ru1/NC is superior to the reported Ru-based catalysts, such as Ru-P/SiO2 (ref. 20) and Ru/YZrO2 (ref. 41), as shown in Fig. 3e. When the stability test was conducted at a relatively high temperature of 560 °C and high concentration of feed gas (20% C3H8/20% H2/N2), Ru1/NC is still more stable than 1RuNP/NC and 6RuNP/NC (Supplementary Fig. 12). The kd value is 0.0048 h−1 over Ru1/NC during 50 h time on stream, which is larger than that under a 5% concentration of C3H8. However, this kd value is still several times lower than that of 1RuNP/NC (0.0350 h−1) and 6RuNP/NC (0.0403 h−1), as listed in Supplementary Table 4, consistent with the trend under reaction conditions of 5% C3H8, further demonstrating the increased stability of Ru single atoms for PDH. Moreover, this performance is comparable with that of commercial PtSn/Al2O3, which shows a similar initial C3H8 conversion and kd value (0.0035 h−1) (Supplementary Fig. 13 and Table 4). AC-HAADF-STEM results (Supplementary Fig. 14) show the presence of uniform Ru single atoms on the used Ru1/NC after the stability test. Additionally, XAFS spectra show that the used Ru1/NC maintains the same valance state and coordination structure of Ru1 sites as the fresh catalyst, even after 100 h time on stream (Supplementary Figs. 15 and 16, and Table 1). Comparatively, Ru particle size increases from 1.1 to 1.7 nm on the used 1RuNP/NC (Supplementary Fig. 17), which accounts for the decreased reactivity. These results demonstrate the good stability of Ru1/NC for the efficient conversion of propane to propylene under the high temperature and reducing atmosphere of the PDH reaction.
Next we investigated coke formation and regeneration of Ru1/NC. The selectivity to coke over Ru1/NC (approximately 2%) is much lower than that over 1RuNP/NC (approximately 12%) and 6RuNP/NC (approximately 18%) based on the carbon balance (Supplementary Fig. 12). Thermogravimetric analysis of the used Ru1/NC shows the weight loss occurs at approximately 450 °C due to carbon combustion in air, which 30 °C lower than that of the fresh catalyst (Supplementary Fig. 18), probably due to the coke deposited on the catalyst surface during PDH. To better reflect the deactivation and regeneration process, the Ru1/NC catalyst was tested under high concentrations of C3H8 (40 vol%) at 560 °C. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 19, the conversion of C3H8 gradually decreases over 20 h time on stream. Nevertheless, after two dehydrogenation/oxidative regeneration cycles under mild conditions (feeding 1% O2 at 400 °C for 1 h), the initial activity of the catalyst can almost be restored, despite the increased kd that is likely due to some residual carbon species. These results suggest that coking is the main cause for the initial deactivation, and the catalyst can be regenerated by mild oxidative treatment.
Factors for the high stability and selectivity of Ru1/NC
To get in-depth insight into the structural stability of Ru1/NC, we performed in situ EXAFS tests of Ru1/NC subjected to high-temperature treatments under different conditions. As shown in Fig. 4a, the XANES spectra of Ru species remain almost unchanged compared with the fresh catalyst, regardless of reduction treatment by H2 at 600 °C or during the in situ PDH reactions at 520 °C, indicating the valence state of the Ru1 centre over Ru1/NC is still slightly positive in the reaction. Moreover, there is almost no change in Ru–N/C coordination and no corresponding Ru–Ru bond present (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Fig. 20 and Table 4) due to the strong covalent bonding between Ru1 and N atoms24,42. As a test of performance, the conversion of C3H8 on 0.1Ru1/AC clearly decreases from approximately 8 to 4% after only 5 h time on stream (Supplementary Fig. 21). The AC-HAADF-STEM results show the presence of both the Ru nanoparticle and single atoms in the used 0.1Ru1/AC catalyst (Supplementary Fig. 22). Along with the AC-HAADF-STEM results from the used Ru1/NC catalyst (Supplementary Fig. 14), our results demonstrate that the N species play a key role in stabilizing the Ru single atoms. We also considered the contribution of coordinated N species for the stability of Ru1 by DFT calculations. A series of Ru1/NC with specific tetracoordinated RuNxC4–x (x = 0–4) moieties (Supplementary Fig. 23) were constructed according to the EXAFS results (the detailed description of which can be found under ‘DFT calculations’). Figure 4c shows that the formation energy of the Ru1 centre clearly decreases as the N coordination number increases, where the RuN3C and RuN4 models are thermodynamically more stable. These results demonstrate that the coordination of inner-shell N species plays an essential role in the stability of the Ru1 centre for the PDH reaction over the Ru1/NC catalyst.

Enhancing propylene selectivity is a long-term aim that attracts more attention in the PDH reaction than propane conversion and stability. In this regard, the Ru1 sites anchored by inner-shell N species were robust over Ru1/NC, which can inhibit the direct cleavage of the propane C–C bond and promote the selective conversion of propane to propylene. It is well known that, over the sole active sites, there is a seesaw effect between alkane conversion and alkene selectivity19,43. High activity of a single site implies high propane conversion but is usually accompanied by strong adsorption of propylene and low selectivity. The desorption ability of propylene from active sites is essential for its selectivity in the PDH reaction. To quantitatively reflect the differences of propylene adsorption strength, we conducted a microcalorimetric measurement of propylene adsorption over these catalysts. Supplementary Figure 24 shows that the initial propylene adsorption heat over Ru1/NC is 71 kJ mol−1, which is much lower than that over 1RuNP/NC (95 kJ mol−1) and 6RuNP/NC (125 kJ mol−1). This demonstrates that the Ru1 sites have a lower adsorption strength of propylene relative to nanoparticle Ru sites, that is, the seesaw effect of single-atom sites for PDH is decoupled over Ru1/NC. In general, desorption of propylene is closely related to the valence orbitals of the active metal, which is due to the electronic effect of second metals in the bimetallic catalysts9,12. Because of the sole metal in the Ru1/NC catalyst, it is important to determine whether there are any factors regulating propylene desorption. Naturally, attention is drawn to the NC support, especially the role of peripheral N species around the Ru1 centre. The comparison between 0.1Ru1/AC and 0.1Ru1/NC in Supplementary Fig. 8 indicates the positive effect of N species on propylene selectivity. Moreover, there are abundant N species in the NC support apart from the Ru1 centre that distribute not only in the inner shell but also the outer shell around the Ru1 centre. To demonstrate the effect of the peripheral N species, we regulated the content of N species for Ru1/NC-2 and Ru1/NC-3 catalysts (details shown in Methods) by modulating the ratio of C3H7NO2 to C2H4N4. EXAFS characterizations show that the coordination number of the Ru–N shell remains around four for these Ru1/NC catalysts (Supplementary Fig. 25 and Table 6). However, the content of N species and the ratio of N to Ru decreases from Ru1/NC to Ru1/NC-3 with increased use of C3H7NO2. As the N to Ru mass ratio decreases, the selectivity of propylene decreases compared with that of Ru1/NC (Supplementary Fig. 26). These results suggest the important role of not only the inner-shell but also the outer-shell N species around the Ru1 centre for the PDH reaction.
Theoretical insights into the role of peripheral N species
The coordination environments of NC-based SACs are diverse and have a critical impact on catalytic performance, which can be more clearly identified by DFT calculations due to the difficulty in distinguishing the N or C binding through experimental means28,29,44. As shown in Fig. 5a, a series of Ru1/NC with different total number of N atoms in the inner and outer shells (Fig. 5a) was constructed. One type of Ru1/NC includes only inner-shell N species, tetracoordinated RuNxC4–x (x = 0–4), as shown in Supplementary Fig. 23. Another type of Ru1/NC, containing both inner-shell and outer-shell N species, tetracoordinated RuN3C-Y (Y = 5, 9 and 13) and tetracoordinated RuN4-Y (Y = 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14), is displayed in Supplementary Fig. 27. The calculated lengths of Ru–N bonds in the above models vary from 1.928 to 2.089 Å (Supplementary Table 7), which is in accordance with the experimental values (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 1). Because the desorption of propylene from the catalyst is crucial for the selectivity of PDH catalysis9,12,45, we systematically investigated the relationship between the coordination environment of Ru1 and the adsorption energy of propylene in π adsorption mode (denoted as Eads) on Ru1/NC. The optimized structures of all of the models are displayed in Supplementary Figs. 28 and 29 with the corresponding Ru–N bond distance, and the Bader charge of Ru1 and the Eads of propylene are listed in Supplementary Table 7.

The trend of Eads values for propylene adsorption on Ru1 was first investigated on the Ru1/NC models with only inner-shell N species. As shown in Fig. 5b (pink region), the Bader charge on the tetracoordinated Ru1 slightly decreases while the Eads values change significantly as the inner-shell N number increases. In particular, on RuC4, RuNC3, RuN2C2-a (two N or C atoms are adjacent) and RuN2C2-o (two N or C atoms are opposite), the Eads values reach −3.909, −3.182, −2.886 and −3.370 eV, respectively. Adsorption energies this high are detrimental to the desorption of propylene. Comparatively, RuN3C and RuN4, the other two models in the RuNxC4–x series, show more positive values of −2.128 and −1.912 eV, respectively, possibly from the contribution of more Ru–N coordination. However, these propylene adsorption values over all of the above Ru1 centres are still much higher than the experimentally measured value of −0.740 eV (Supplementary Fig. 24, 71 kJ mol−1), suggesting it is not sufficient to only consider the effects of inner-shell N species.
We then considered the Ru1/NC models in the presence of outer-shell N species because the experimentally observed nitrogen content on Ru1/NC is undoubtedly much higher than that of Ru–N species calculated on the basis of Ru–N4 coordination (Supplementary Table 2). As displayed in Fig. 5b (grey and blue regions), the Bader charge on Ru1 clearly decreases as the outer-shell N number increases. Accordingly, the propylene Eads values also decrease, both in the RuN4-Y and RuN3C-Y series. Surprisingly, the propylene Eads values on RuN3C-13, RuN3C-13-3, RuN4-12 and RuN4-14 are significantly lowered to −0.841, −0.735, −0.794 and −0.537 eV, respectively, which approach the experimentally measured adsorption heat of propylene on Ru1/NC (−0.740 eV). To gain more insight into the effect of peripheral N species on propylene adsorption on Ru1/NC, we analysed the electronic structure around the Ru1 site. As displayed in Supplementary Fig. 30, for the samples with only inner-shell N species, the Ru1 atom has a significantly positive charge, which leads to an extremely high Eads for propylene. Comparatively, as seen in Supplementary Fig. 31, in the RuN3C-Y and RuN4-Y series, the accumulation of electrons on the Ru1 atom gradually increases when the number of outer-shell N atoms increases. Specifically, the Bader charges of the Ru1 atom on RuN3C-13, RuN3C-13-3, RuN4-12 and RuN4-14 are +0.544, +0.545, +0.622 and +0.634 |e|, respectively. Relative to the calculated Bader charges of Ru in Ru foil (0 |e|) and bulk RuO2 (+1.63 |e|), the chemical state of Ru1 in Ru1/NC is slightly positive, which is in line with the experimental XPS and XANES analysis. This trend might be attributable to the fact that some C atoms around Ru1 lose more electrons with the presence of more electronegative outer-shell N species, thus rendering Ru1 closer to a metallic state (Supplementary Figs. 32 and 33). Under these circumstances, the accumulation of electrons around Ru1 centre favours the repulsion of π-electrons in propylene, which leads to smaller Eads values on RuN3C-13, RuN3C-13-3, RuN4-12 and RuN4-14. Therefore, the DFT results emphasize the important role of outer-shell N species in regulating the adsorption energy of propylene on Ru1/NC via the modulation of the electronic state of Ru1 sites, which is closely related to the selectivity of PDH catalysis.
The above DFT calculations provide molecular insight into the selectivity issue over Ru1/NC SACs from the viewpoint of propylene adsorption strength. Next we evaluated the reactivity of the representative Ru1 sites with excellent selectivity, that is, RuN3C-13 and RuN4-14, for the PDH reaction. As shown in Fig. 5c, the calculated free energy barriers of the first dehydrogenation step (CH3CH2CH3* → CH3CHCH3* + H*) are 1.061 and 1.357 eV for RuN3C-13 and RuN4-14, respectively. In the transition state, the corresponding lengths of the breaking C(β)–H bond are 1.483 and 1.599 Å and the distances for the forming C(β)–Ru bond are 2.339 and 2.352 Å for these two systems, respectively. For the second dehydrogenation step (CH3CHCH3* + H* → CH3CHCH2* + 2H*), the calculated free energy barriers are much lower (0.701 eV on RuN3C-13 and 0.444 eV on RuN4-14), suggesting the first dehydrogenation step is rate determining for propane conversion. The kinetic performance of Ru1/NC is comparable to that of PtSn surface and Pt/Cu SAA11,46 with high activity, suggesting the Ru1N4 and/or Ru1N3C centres with outer-shell N species can act as the active sites for PDH. Furthermore, we demonstrate that further dehydrogenation of the resulting propylene is not likely to take place because the formation of 1-propenyl (cis-/trans-) or 2-propenyl is highly endothermic, with the reaction free energy ranging from 0.903 to 1.850 eV on RuN3C-13 and from 1.289 to 1.660 eV on RuN4-14, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 34 and 35). As an example, we consider the energy barrier of the further dehydrogenation of propylene to CH3CCH2* on RuN4-14 in Supplementary Fig. 36. This reaction process has an energy barrier of 1.707 eV, which is much higher than the rate-determining barrier (1.357 eV) of PDH. These results unequivocally demonstrate the increasing propylene selectivity of Ru1/NC models with an increased presence of N species.
Discussion
SACs, especially M1–N–C catalysts, have recently become a frontier in catalysis research and have been rapidly applied to a broad scope of chemical reactions6,25. However, most previous studies focused on the regulation of either the coordination element, such as N, O and C28,47, or the coordination numbers24,29 of M1 in the inner shell around single-atom centres to achieve better performance for a target catalytic reaction29,48,49. In contrast, the role of the coordination environment in the outer shell of M1 on catalytic performance has long gone unnoticed, probably from assuming a relatively weak effect induced by the long distance between the M1 centre and the outer-shell coordination element. In the current work, an Ru1/NC SAC containing isolated metal elements surrounded by N species was developed and characterized. Ru1/NC SAC provides high selectivity and excellent stability in the high-temperature PDH reaction due to the combined functions of inner-shell and outer-shell N species at single-atom Ru sites. This SAC could be a potential alternative to the expensive Pt-based catalysts or the environmentally unfriendly CrOx-based catalysts commonly used in industry. Moreover, the implementation of this robust Ru1/NC SAC differs from the state-of-the-art Pt-based SAA catalysts, which use another metal promoter to create isolated active ensembles11,12. On the one hand, the Ru1 centre coordinated with the inner-shell N or C atoms (RuN4 and/or RuN3C) can serve as the active sites for efficient conversion of propane to propylene — in fact, the sole NC support shows no activity, Fig. 3b. The chemical bonding between Ru1 and inner-shell N atoms can help to firmly anchor the Ru1 atoms on the NC support, resulting in good stability, as demonstrated by EXAFS characterizations and DFT calculations (Fig. 4). On the other hand, an increase in the content of outer-shell N species can effectively modulate the valence state of the Ru1 centre, which results in the more electron-rich Ru species on Ru1/NC (Figs. 2a and 5b) promoting the desorption of propylene. This property can be facilitated by increasing the amount of N species to achieve higher selectivity, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 26. These points expand the insight into the nature of the coordination environment in the field of SACs, including the effect of not only inner shells but also outer shells around single-atom sites on the catalytic performance of the PDH reaction.
In summary, we developed a highly efficient and stable Ru1/NC SAC for the high-temperature PDH reaction. The RuN4 and/or RuN3C moieties over Ru1/NC SAC were proposed as active sites, where the inner-shell N species around the Ru1 centre contribute to high activity and stability for propane conversion, whereas the outer-shell N species accounted for improved selectivity towards propylene. This work has important implications for the development of robust SACs by retrofitting the single-atom centres with different coordination shells, particularly for catalysis under harsh conditions.
Methods
Catalyst preparation
The method of synthesizing M1–N–C catalysts was based on the previous work29,42. Given that higher temperature is conducive to the formation of a more stable catalyst, which is required in the PDH reaction, we selected the high pyrolysis temperature of 900 °C to prepare the Ru1/NC catalyst. C2H4N4 (12 g), C3H7NO2 (3 g) and Ru(acac)3 (40 mg) were added together to a ball mill jar. The mixture was then ground at a speed of 400 rpm for 2 h. The resulting powder was transferred to a tubular furnace under N2 atmosphere (flow rate = 60 ml min–1) via the following treatment: The temperature was increased from 25 to 600 °C (3 °C min–1) and maintained at 600 °C for 2 h; and then it was further increased from 600 to 900 °C (2 °C min–1) and maintained at 900 °C for 1 h. The prepared catalyst was named Ru1/NC. NC support was prepared via the same method without the addition of Ru(acac)3. Ru1/NC-700 was prepared by the same method except the final calcination temperature was 700 °C. The content of N species can be controlled by modulating the ratio of C3H7NO2 to C2H4N4 that acted as N resources. The Ru1/NC-2 catalyst was obtained using 11.5 g C2H4N4 and 3.5 g C3H7NO2, whereas Ru1/NC-3 was obtained using 11 g C2H4N4 and 4 g C3H7NO2, with the other preparation parameters the same as that for Ru1/NC. The N to Ru mass ratios on these Ru1/NC catalysts were determined by XPS characterization. For comparison, the Ru loading in NC support catalysts with the Ru content of 1.3 wt% and 6.0 wt%, denoted as 1RuNP/NC and 6RuNP/NC, respectively, were prepared using the impregnation method. The commercial PtSn/Al2O3 (0.5 wt% Pt, 1.5 wt% Sn, 0.8 wt% K) catalyst was obtained from Universal Oil Product company.
Catalyst characterization
The Ru loading of all catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry on an IRIS Intrepid II XSP instrument (Thermo Electron Corporation). XPS was measured on a Thermo ESCALAB 250 X-ray photoelectron spectrometer equipped with Al Kα excitation source. The data were analysed using XPSPEAK41 software and the C 1s was chosen as the internal standard (C 1s = 284.6 eV). Before measurement, the catalysts were reduced by 10 vol% H2/He at 600 °C for 1 h.
HAADF-STEM of the samples was performed on a JEOL 2100FS STEM/TEM instrument. AC-HAADF-STEM was conducted on a JEOL JEM-ARM200F equipped with a CEOS probe corrector. The EELS analysis of Ru1/NC was measured on a Field Emission HF5000 Microscope.
The X-ray absorption spectra (XAS), including XANES and EXAFS at Ru K-edge, of the samples were measured at the beamline 14W of the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility in China. Energy was calibrated using Ru foil, which had a first derivative maximum calibrated to 22117 eV. The incident X-ray intensities were monitored using standard Ar-filled ion chamber and seven-element high-purity Germanium detectors. The data from the prepared catalysts and references were collected at room temperature under transmission mode. The EXAFS raw data were background subtracted, normalized and Fourier transformed by the standard procedures using the ATHENA program50. Least-squares curve-fitting analysis of the EXAFS χ(k) data was carried out using the ARTEMIS program with the theoretical scattering amplitudes, phase shifts and the photoelectron mean free path for all paths calculated by ab initio code FEFF9.05 (ref. 51). For in situ XAS measurement, the Ru1/NC catalyst was reduced by 10% H2/Ar at 600 °C for 1 h. The sample was then exposed to 5% C3H8 + 5% H2/Ar at 520 °C for 1.5 h. Finally, the sample was cooled to the room temperature. The XAS spectra of Ru1/NC were recorded at different periods during the in situ experiment.
Microcalorimetric measurements of propylene adsorption were conducted on a Calvet-type heat-flux calorimeter (Setaram BT 2.15). The catalyst was first treated at 600 °C with 10 vol% H2/He for 1 h on a special treatment cell. Then the catalyst was in situ vacuumised at the same temperature to remove the adsorbed gases on the surface. Subsequently, the cell was sealed and transferred into the microcalorimeter. The pressure of the microcalorimeter was then evacuated below 10−4 Pa. After approximately 6–8 h thermal equilibrium, a stable baseline heat signal was attained. Finally, the adsorption experiment of propylene was conducted at 40 °C. The details of microcalorimetric adsorption experiment have been reported previously52.
Catalytic performance tests
The PDH reaction performance was performed in a fixed bed reactor under atmospheric pressure40. The powder catalyst was loaded into a U-shaped quartz tube (inner diameter 8 mm). The feed gas containing 5 vol% C3H8 + 5 vol% H2/He or higher concentration of C3H8 was allowed to pass through the reactor at a given flow rate. When the C3H8 concentration was equal to or greater than 20%, N2 was used as interior label. The output gases were analysed by an online gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. There are two columns for analysing different gases, a Pora PLOT Q column for methane, ethane, ethylene, propane and propylene, and a molecular sieve 5A column for H2 and N2. The propane conversion (XC3H8) and propylene selectivity (SC3H6) were calculated as follows:
$${{{X}}}_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}8}\left( {{{\mathrm{\% }}}} \right) = \frac{{\left[ {{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8} \right]_{{{{\mathrm{in}}}}} - \left[ {{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8} \right]_{{{{\mathrm{out}}}}}}}{{\left[ {{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8} \right]_{{{{\mathrm{in}}}}}}} \times 100{{{\mathrm{\% }}}}$$ (1)
$${{{S}}}_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}6}\left( {{{\mathrm{\% }}}} \right) = \frac{{\left[ {{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_6} \right]_{{{{\mathrm{out}}}}}}}{{\left[ {{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8} \right]_{{{{\mathrm{in}}}}} - \left[ {{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8} \right]_{{{{\mathrm{out}}}}}}} \times 100{{{\mathrm{\% }}}}$$ (2)
$${{{S}}}_{{{{\mathrm{C}}}}x}\left( {{{\mathrm{\% }}}} \right) = \frac{{x/3 \times \left[ {{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_x} \right]_{{{{\mathrm{out}}}}}}}{{\left[ {{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8} \right]_{{{{\mathrm{in}}}}} - \left[ {{{{\mathrm{C}}}}_3{{{\mathrm{H}}}}_8} \right]_{{{{\mathrm{out}}}}}}} \times 100{{{\mathrm{\% }}}}$$ (3)
SCx can represent the selectivity of C2H6, C2H4 or CH4, x represents the number of C atoms. [C3H8]in represents the molar concentration of C3H8 in the feed gases; [C3H8]out and [C3H6]out represent the molar concentrations of C3H8 and C3H6 in the products, respectively; and [Cx]out represents the molar concentrations of C2H6, C2H4 and CH4, in the products, respectively, where the x is the number of C atom in the products. Given the changes in the number of moles in the reaction, N2 was used as an interior label when the concentration of C3H8 is more than 20%.
The selectivity to coke (Scoke) can be approximately calculated according to the following equations17:
$$S_{\mathrm{coke}} = 1 - \mathop {\sum}\nolimits_i {\left( {S_i} \right)}$$ (4)
where Si is the selectivity to gas products.
The kd was calculated by assuming a first-order deactivation mechanism53:
$${{{{k}}}}_{{{\mathrm{d}}}}\left( {h^{ - 1}} \right) = \frac{{\ln \left( {\frac{{1 - X_{\mathrm{end}}}}{{X_{\mathrm{end}}}}} \right) - \ln \left(\frac{{1 - X_{\mathrm{start}}}}{{X_{\mathrm{start}}}}\right)}}{t}$$ (5)
Xstart and Xend represent the conversion at the start and the end of an experiment, respectively, and t is the duration of the experiment in hours.
Specific rate of propylene production over catalysts was measured in the kinetic region, calculated according to the following equation:
$$\text{Specific rate} = \frac{r}{{n_{\mathrm{Ru}}}}$$ (6)
where r is the propylene formation rate (molC3H6 gcatalyst−1 h−1) and nRu represents the molar amount of Ru (mol g−1) that is determined by inductively coupled plasma characterization.
Propylene productivity over catalysts was measured according to the following equation:
$$\text{Propylene productivity} = M_{\mathrm{C3H6}} \times r$$ (7)
where r is the propylene formation rate (molC3H6 gcatalyst−1 h−1), MC3H6 represents the molar mass of C3H6 that is 42 g mol−1.
The TOF for the formation of propylene is calculated based on the specific rate and the dispersion (D), which can be determined by the relationship between Ru particle size and dispersion54:
$${\mathrm{TOF}} = r/D$$ (8)
$${{D}} = \frac{{6 \times (v_{\mathrm{m}}/a_{\mathrm{m}})}}{d} \approx \frac{{1.29}}{d}$$ (9)
D is the dispersion, am (Å2) is the surface area of an atom, vm (Å3) is the volume of an atom and d (nm) is the particle diameter determined from HAADF-STEM characterization. Accordingly, the dispersion of 6RuNP/NC is calculated to be 56%, whereas the dispersion of Ru1/NC and 1RuNP/NC catalysts can be considered as 100%.
DFT calculations
All spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed using the generalized gradient approximation55 with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange–correlation functional in the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP, v.5.4.1)56,57. The electronic wave functions were expanded into plane waves up to a cutoff energy of 400 eV, and the wave functions of the ionic core electrons were approximated using the projector augmented-wave method58. The Brillouin zone was sampled using 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst-Pack k-point grids for the optimization59. We used an 8 × 8 unit cell of graphene in the xy plane under periodic boundary conditions in all calculations. The van der Waals interaction was described by optPBE-vdW functional60. The electron density for the atomic ground states converged with a 10−5 eV total energy threshold, and the structures were optimized until the maximum force acting on any ion was less than 0.02 eV Å−1. A vacuum space of 20 Å was employed along the z direction. We calculated the adsorption energy (Eads) of propylene and formation energy of systems using the following equation:
$$E_{\mathrm{ads}} = E_{\mathrm{propylene/support}} - E_{\mathrm{propylene}} - E_{\mathrm{support}}$$ (10)
$$\text{Formation energy} = E_{\mathrm{support}} + n_{\mathrm{C}}\mu _{\mathrm{C}} - n_{\mathrm{N}}\mu _{\mathrm{N}} - \mu _{\mathrm{Ru}} - E_{\mathrm{graphene}}$$ (11)
where Epropylene/support represents the energy of propylene species with support; and Epropylene, Esupport and Egraphene represent the energy of propylene in gas, formed support and 8 × 8 perfect graphene, respectively. nC, nN, μC, μN and μRu are the numbers of C and N atoms that were added or removed to form the system and the chemical potentials of element carbon, nitrogen and Ru, respectively. μC, μN and μRu were obtained from the DFT energy of 8 × 8 perfect graphene, N2 molecules in gas and isolated Ru single atom, respectively.
Charge density difference was obtained by the following equation:
$$\Delta \rho = \rho _{\mathrm{AB}} - \rho _{\mathrm{A}} - \rho _{\mathrm{B}}$$ (12)
where Δρ represents the charge of the total system, and ρA and ρB represent the charge of segment A and segment B, respectively.
The free energy of adsorbates was calculated from the harmonic vibrational energies hvi using VASPKIT (v.1.2.0) according to the following formulas:
$${F} = {U} - {T} \times {S}$$ (13)
$${U} = {E}_{\mathrm{DFT}} + {E}_{\mathrm{ZPE}} + {U}\left( {{{{T}}}} \right)$$ (14)
$${S} = \mathop {\sum}\nolimits_i {\left\{ {\frac{{\frac{{{{h}}v_{{i}}}}{{k}{T}}}}{{{\mathrm{e}}^{\frac{{{{h}}v_{{i}}}}{{{k}T}}} - 1}} - {{{\mathrm{ln}}}}\left[ {1 - {\mathrm{e}}^{ - \frac{{{{h}}v_{{i}}}}{{{k}T}}}} \right]} \right\}}$$ (15)
$${U}\left( {{{{T}}}} \right) =\sum_i \frac{{\frac{{{{h}}v_{{i}}}}{{k}}}}{{\mathrm{e}^{\frac{{{h}v_{{i}}}}{{{k}T}}} - 1}}$$ (16)
where F, U, T, S, EDFT, EZPE, U (T) and vi represent free energy, internal energy, temperature, entropy, DFT energy, zero point energy, correction of heat capacity and vibrational frequencies, respectively. The h is Planck constant and k is Boltzmann constant.
