The given document does not seem to be related to propane dehydrogenation or the conversion of propane to propylene. It discusses the synthesis of 3-trifluoromethylated 1,3-butadienes via a fluorinated Heck reaction, which does not involve propane or propylene. Since the document does not pertain to propane dehydrogenation, I have indicated "No" for relevance and did not extract any catalyst information.
