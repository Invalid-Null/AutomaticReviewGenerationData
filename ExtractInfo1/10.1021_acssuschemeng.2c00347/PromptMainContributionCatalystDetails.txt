Techno-Economic Analysis of a Hybrid Process for Propylene and Ammonia Production

Abstract
Hydrogen as a large-scale byproduct from the propane dehydrogenation process is of great value for the downstream value-added chemical production. The paper describes a hybrid process which combines the production of propylene and ammonia using hydrogen produced from the propane dehydrogenation process. The utility consumption and economic cost of the hybrid process are investigated in comparison with the standalone propylene production and methane-to-ammonia processes. Due to the combination of the endothermic propane dehydrogenation process and exothermic ammonia synthesis process, the hybrid process can achieve a more efficient heat exchange capacity with lower utility requirement. The utility consumption of the hybrid process is 3.5% lower than the summation of standalone propylene production at 900 kt/year and ammonia production at 220 kt/year. The total production cost of the hybrid process is 13.6 M$/year lower at this production scale. Although the production costs of all processes increase with the increase of resource prices and decrease of produce scale, the hybrid process still shows higher economic performance than the summation of those of the two individual processes. This study can potentially instruct the efficient utilization of the byproduct hydrogen from the propane dehydrogenation process for downstream value-added chemical production processes.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propylene is one of the important raw materials in the chemical industry, which is used for the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and related chemicals. (1) Traditional propylene production processes involve fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha and light diesel. However, there is an increasing gap between the demand and supply of propylene. Hence, the development of novel propylene production technologies is extremely important to relieve propylene demand pressure. (2) In the past few years, novel technologies for propylene production have been widely developed, such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), the methanol-to-olefin process, and the Fischer–Tropsch-to-olefin process. Especially, PDH technology is deemed to be one of the most promising propylene production methods due to its on-purpose production of propylene. (3,4) In addition, the yield of propane increases gradually with the large-scale extraction of shale gas. (5,6) Fundamentally, PDH is a process that converts propane into propylene (C3H6) and H2 (eq 1). Therefore, the byproduct H2 has received more and more attention along with the rapid development of PDH plants. For the strongly endothermic PDH process, as a byproduct, H2 usually burns to provide heat for reactors. Considering the value of H2 and the challenge for storage and transportation, it would be more profitable and practical to use H2 on site for the production of value-added chemical products. (7)
(1)
In fact, about half of the produced H2 from other industrial H2 production processes is consumed to synthesize ammonia (NH3). (8) As a key chemical in industry, NH3 has facilitated the production of fertilizers which dramatically improve global agricultural production in most regions of the word. (9) Until now, the production of NH3 has achieved 171 million tons per year, and the production scale is expected to increase 3–5% per year in the future. NH3 is traditionally synthesized through Haber–Bosch (H–B) technology, which requires H2 and N2 with high purity as the feedstocks (eq 2). (10) Usually, the steam reforming of natural gas, which is an energy-intensive process due to the highly endothermic nature, is used to produce H2 for downstream H–B technology (eq 3). The subsequent water–gas shift (WGS) reaction can be used to increase the yield of H2 (eq 4). The H–B process is responsible for 1–2% of global energy supply and about 1.2% of global CO2 emissions. As a result, the H–B process is one of the largest energy consumers and greenhouse gas emitters. (11,12) Therefore, it would be more promising to produce NH3 with low energy consumption and cost.

(4)
Therefore, hybrid processes have been proposed in the literature to replace H2 production processes with renewable energy and/or higher energy efficiency. H2O electrolyzers for H2 production can be connected to the H–B process for NH3 synthesis. (13) The H2O electrolysis process can make use of renewable electricity to produce NH3 with substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions. (14,15) However, this process is still expensive due to the relatively high price of electricity and the intermittency of low carbon electricity (e.g., wind energy or solar energy), which restricts the large-scale production and economic feasibility. (16) Meanwhile, the direct NH3 electrosynthesis is still limited by the low production rate (typically 10–1000 nmol h–1 m–2). (17,18) In 2018, the Yara–BASF opened the ammonia plant in Freeport, Texas, which had a capacity of 750 thousand tons of ammonia per year. The production process is based on the byproduct H2 which originates from the production processes of various petrochemical plants nearby instead of natural gas. (19) Similarly, the PDH process also provides a large amount of byproduct H2, which is practically suitable for downstream large-scale ammonia production. In addition, the combination of endothermic and exothermic reactions and avoiding the energy-intensive steam reforming process can potentially lead to the reduction of utility consumption.
In this paper, a hybrid production process coupling propane dehydrogenation and ammonia synthesis is presented. In this hybrid process, the upstream PDH process will produce C3H6 and H2. Then, the purified H2 and highly pure N2 produced from an air separation unit (ASU) are mixed and sent to the downstream NH3 synthesis process. The hybrid process is compared with the standalone PDH plant and traditional NH3 production plant. The utility consumption and economic feasibility of the hybrid process are evaluated in detail. The key performance indicators are compared to illustrate the improvement and promising perspectives.

Description of the Oleflex Process
With the rapid development of propane dehydrogenation in recent years, several technologies have been proposed and commercialized, which include CATOFIN, Oleflex, FBD-4, PDH, STAR, ADHO, and FCDh. (2,3) The Oleflex process uses recyclable platinum-based catalysts and moving-bed reactors for continuous manufacturing, which has low production expenses and high returns on investment. Currently, the largest PDH plant of the Oleflex process in China produces 900,000 tons of propylene per year (900 kt/year). Therefore, the Oleflex process for production of C3H6 and H2 at this scale is considered in this study.
The feedstock, key streams, and product composition of the Oleflex process are listed in Table 1. The operating time of the PDH plant is 7200 h per year. The feedstock is a mixture of 96% propane and 2% of ethane and butane (C3LPG). The process flow diagram of Oleflex technology is shown in Figure 1. The feedstock is propane-rich liquefied petroleum gas (C3 LPG) that is fed into the depropanizer to remove other heavy components. Then, the purified feedstock is mixed with recycled propane that is preheated and is subjected to go through the dehydrogenation reaction within four adiabatic moving bed reactors in series. Between the moving bed reactors, there are several interheaters to provide heat for the dehydrogenation reaction due to the endothermic nature. The platinum catalysts are usually defined as the active site of the PDH reaction. The PDH reaction suffers from the side actions including deep dehydrogenation, cracking, and coking, which cause rapid deactivation of the catalysts. An appropriate hydrogen pressure can reduce the coverage of coke precursors on the catalyst surface. (20) Hence, the cofeeding of H2 is essential during the dehydrogenation process, which can reduce the rate of catalyst deactivation. Also, the cofed H2 will be recovered later in the cold-box unit. The molar ratio of cofed H2 to mixed propane is about 1:2. A single conversion of propane is usually 30–40% in the literature, and 38% conversion is adopted in this paper. (3,6) The overall reaction selectivity toward propylene is about 88%. Besides H2, the byproducts of the PDH reaction are ethylene, ethane, methane, and coke. Of course, it is necessary to use a catalyst regenerator to remove carbon deposition. The outlet products from reactors need to quench quickly to reach 300 °C to avoid propane and propylene cracking. Then, the cooled gas is compressed using a multistage compressor with intercoolers. The compressed gas enters into the cold-box system to be refrigerated using ethylene–propylene cascade refrigeration. The light component gas (H2-rich gas) will separate from other liquefied hydrocarbons. The H2-rich gas is partially sent to the dehydrogenation reactors and selective hydrogenation process (SHP) reactor, and the rest of gas is normally sent to a burning furnace to produce heat. Then, the mixed liquid products are fed to the de-ethanizer to remove ethane and ethylene. The liquid from the bottom of the de-ethanizer is sent to the SHP reactor to convert allylene formed in the side reactions to propylene. The outlet products are sent to the propane–propylene (P–P) splitter to get a 99.5% mass-purity propylene product. The unconverted propane from the tower bottom of a P–P splitter is recycled back to the dehydrogenation reaction system.

In this work, the Soave–Redlich–Kwong property method is used to model the entire flowsheet of the Oleflex process. The simulated process implemented in Aspen Plus is presented in Figure S1, and the grid diagram of the heat exchanger network is presented in Figure S2. The model and key parameter of different units are summarized in Table S1. These are based on the industrial production results as given in the previous literature. (6) Carbon deposition usually occurs as a side reaction during the dehydrogenation phase. Hence, the catalyst regeneration stage is mainly to remove the carbon deposition on the catalyst surface. The combustion of carbon will also generate heat that can provide energy to the system. Generally, approximately 5–8% of the consumed propane is converted to carbon deposition, and 5% of the propane is converted to carbon in this paper. As a result, the molar ratio of the reactant propane to the product propylene is 1.14, which is close to the industrial practical data. Meanwhile, 1 mol of formed propylene is accompanied with 1.16 mol of H2-rich gas. Therefore, a plant of 900 kt/year propylene will obtain 80.1 kt/year H2-rich gas. The H2-rich gas is usually a mixture consisting mainly H2 and CH4. The molar composition ratio of H2 is 93.5%. If the mixture gas can be purified using a pressure swing adsorption (PSA) unit (separation efficiency: 85%), there will be 39.6 kt/year high-purity H2. Also, the produced high-purity H2 is used in the downstream H–B looping, and it can reach about 220 kt/year NH3 according to the stoichiometry calculation.
Description of the Methane-to-Ammonia Process
Nowadays, approximately half of the conventional H–B plants use natural gas as the feedstock to produce H2 for NH3 synthesis, which has the highest energy efficiency compared to other raw materials, such as coal and oil. (8) A design capacity of 220 kt/year is chosen, and the NH3 purity is set to be 99.5%. The feedstock, key streams, and product composition of the steam methane reforming H–B (SMR-HB) process are listed in Table 2. The feedstock of natural gas is a mixture of 90% methane and 10% ethane.

The process flow diagram of the methane-to-ammonia process (SMR-HB) is shown in Figure 2. The natural gas is divided into two streams: the first part is fed to the furnace to provide heat for the primary reformer. The second part is mixed with medium-pressure (MP) steam, which is sent to the prereformer reactor to crack higher hydrocarbons. The steam-to-carbon ratio is generally 3 to avoid coke formation in the reformer’s catalyst. The outlet product of the prereformer consists of about 6–10 vol % methane. The primary reformed gas is mixed with compressed preheated air and sent into the secondary autothermal reformer (AR). The oxygen (O2) from the air is usually consumed in the autothermal reformer. The residual N2 will be mixed with the generated H2 at a stoichiometric ratio of 3 before entering the ammonia synthesis unit. Also, the cooled gas contains lots of oxygenated compounds such as H2O, CO, and CO2, which are poisonous for ammonia catalysts. Hence, it is necessary to remove the poisonous content. Two WGS [high-temperature WGS (HT-WGS) and low-temperature WGS (LT-WGS)] sections are used to convert CO and H2O into H2 and CO2, which is beneficial to improve the H2 content. After the WGS reactions, the generated CO2 is typically removed by absorption with a methyl diethanolamine solution. The pure CO2 is sent to a multistage compressor and the storage tanks or other CO2 utilization processes. Then, a methanator is indispensable for converting residual CO2 or CO to methane.
Figure 2
Figure 2. Process flow diagram of the SMR-HB process.
The fresh sweet syngas (N2 and H2) is usually compressed to about 200 bar in a multistage compressor at which ammonia synthesis is thermodynamically favorable. The compressed syngas is fed into the ammonia synthesis reactors which have a three-bed quench converter. The products are cooled to 40 °C before refrigerating. The flashed gas is obtained in the ammonia separators, which is recycled to the ammonia reactors. To avoid inert gas accumulation, a purge gas containing about 0.5–1 vol % of total recycled gas is required to release Ar and CH4. The liquid ammonia from the flash separators is sent to a low-pressure (LP) separator to remove residual gases and provide a liquid ammonia product at 20 bar.
During the SMR-HB process, waste heat from the HT-WGS and LT-WGS units is used to preheat water close to its saturation temperature and the feedwater is vaporized using heat from the ammonia synthesis unit and AR unit. Then, the generated high-pressure (HP) steam can generate electricity using turbine generators. MP steam is partly used for the reforming process, and the other MP steam is also converted to LP steam to generate electricity. Moreover, the LP steam can also export energy.
The Redlich–Kwong–Soave (RK-SOAVE) property method is also used to model the entire flow sheet. Based on the most used Fe-based catalysts, a single conversion from ammonia synthesis reactions is generally 28–30%, and in this paper, it is suitable to adopt a 29% conversion rate. (10,21) The simulated process implemented in Aspen Plus is presented in Figure S3, and the grid diagram of the heat exchanger network is presented in Figure S4. The model and key parameter of different units are summarized in Table S2. These are based on the industrial production results, as given in the previous literature. (22) As a result, the molar ratio of natural gas to liquid ammonia is 0.58, which is close to the industrial data. At the same time, 265.7 kt/year CO2 with a purity of 99.5% will also be obtained. The heat recovered from all units is converted to HP steam (100 bar), MP steam (35 bar), and LP steam (6 bar). Part of the MP steam is used as a feed for the reformers, while the remaining steam is expanded to 6 bar.
Description of the Hybrid Process
The feedstock, key streams, and product composition of the hybrid (PDH-HB) process are listed in Table 3. Moreover, the process flow diagram of the PDH-HB process is shown in Figure 3. The PDH unit involves a process that converts propane into propylene and H2, and high-purity H2 can be acquired by PSA technology. Generally, advanced PSA equipment can generally achieve 80–90% efficiency in purifying H2, and this paper uses an 85% H2 separation efficiency, and the molar fraction of H2 can reach 99.9%. (23,24) An ASU is currently the most mature technology used for the large-scale production of N2. (13,25) Usually, air is compressed to 6 bar and the products of the tower kettle and top perform heat exchange with compressed air. N2 with 99.5% purity can be obtained at the top of the tower. The byproduct O2 can be sent to the tank for storage and sale. Then, the obtained H2 and N2 are mixed in a stoichiometric ratio of 3:1, compressed to 200 bar, and sent to proceed to the ammonia synthesis process. The remaining purge gases are used as fuel in the furnace. The hybrid process can obtain propylene and liquid NH3 as products. Compared to the individual methane-fed ammonia synthesis process, this process has a great advantage to avoid the methane steam reforming section and the subsequent purification section.

The simulated process implemented in Aspen Plus is presented in Figure S5, and the grid diagram of the heat exchanger network is presented in Figure S6. The model and key parameter of different units are summarized in Table S3. The PDH process is the same as the above-mentioned Oleflex process. Moreover, the purified N2 is produced through the ASU. These parameter settings are based on the industrial production results, as given in the previous literature. (10,21,25) The upstream-generated H2 and N2 are converted to liquid NH3 in the H–B process. For comparison purposes, the hybrid process has the same yield as in two individual propylene and ammonia production processes.
General Assumptions
The technoeconomic simulation and analysis are carried using Aspen Plus which can provide the mass and energy balance of the overall system. The platform has been employed in various publications related to the technoeconomic analysis. (26−28) In this paper, the analysis mainly compares the proposed three cases from utility consumption and economic analysis. All reactions are calculated according to the actual industrial production standards. (6,10) For other equipment such as compressors, turbines, and pumps, their mechanical and isentropic efficiencies are set as 0.72 and 0.98, respectively, which are the typical values in the literature. (29,30) Generally, the heat transfer temperature difference between streams is 10–30 °C, which is consistent with the rule-of-thumb values for petrochemical processes. (31) For this paper, the minimum temperature difference between hot and cold streams is set to 15 °C. As for the hybrid process, due to the H2-rich gas is used for the downstream ammonia synthesis process, it is necessary to provide a PSA unit to purify H2 and an ASU to produce N2. The PSA unit will contribute an energy requirement of 2.2 kW hr electricity/kg H2 separated, and the ASU will contribute an energy requirement of 1.2 kW hr electricity/kg N2 separated. (32) The low heat values (LHVs) of different fuels are listed in Table S4.
Utility Consumption Assumptions
The quantity of utility consumption for all processes is calculated (eqs 5 and 6). The required electricity for all processes is calculated by using an advanced natural gas-combined cycle plant with an efficiency of 60% (over the fuel LHV). (10,23) Hence, the assumed value of ηel is 0.6, which is the conversion efficiency of thermal energy to electricity energy. Frequently, a boiler usually produces heat with around 85% efficiency as reference for heat to export. (33) The assumed value of ηst is 0.85, which is the conversion efficiency of thermal energy to steam energy. Therefore, the equivalent utility consumption is also calculated.

Economic Analysis Assumptions
For the processes described above, we calculated the capital investment and operating costs which are based on similar plants at a comparable production scale. The equipment costs are calculated from exponential scaling rules (eq 7). (34−36) It is also important to consider the latest Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index (CEPCI). According to the DOE/NETL report, the total capital investment is determined from the total plant cost, owner cost, and other financial cost (eqs 8 and 9). (37)

The operation costs are calculated according to eqs 10–12. The total production cost is usually computed according to eqs 13 and 14. (38) The depreciation of the equipment must be taken into account when calculating the total production cost. The payback time can be calculated by eq 15, which represents the length of time to recover the capital investment.

Utility Consumption and Comparison
For the PDH process, a split of the utility consumption in terms of duty required is shown in Figure 4a and Table S5. It is obvious that the PDH reactors and P–P splitter account for most of the utility consumption. The PDH reactors consume about 22.6% of the total utility consumption. The reboiler of the P–P splitter accounts for approximately 76.5% of the overall LP steam, and the condenser consumes about 82.4% of the overall cooling water. It is easy to understand because the PDH reaction is a strong endothermic reaction and the boiling points of propane and propylene are very close to each other; it requires large reflux and boil-up ratios leading to the massive reboiler and condenser energy to separate propane and propylene. Meanwhile, the multistage compressor and cold box unit will consume 167.8 MW duty, which takes up 17.3% of the total utility. The power needed for refrigeration is calculated using the power temperature graph, as given in the literature. (39) For the SMR-HB process, a split of the utility consumption in terms of the duty required is shown in Figure 4b and Table S6. The energy for heating the SMR process will require 57.5 MW duty. Also, the compression and refrigeration for NH3 separation will consume 21.5 and 11.8 MW duty, respectively. The total utility consumption of the SMR-HB process will be 113.6 MW duty. For the hybrid PDH-HB process, a split of the utility consumption in terms of the duty required is shown in Figure 4c and Table S7. The PSA unit and ASU only require 12.8 MW and 10.3 MW duty. Therefore, the total utility consumption of the PDH-HB process is 1047.8 MW duty.

Figure 4. Utility consumption of the (a) PDH process, (b) SMR-HB process, and (c) PDH-HB process and (d) comparison of utility consumption of the summation of the PDH and SMR-HB processes and PDH-HB process.
The utility consumption of the hybrid process is calculated and compared to the summation of those of the PDH and SMR-HB processes with the same product and yield. The results of the comparison are shown in Figure 4d. The utility consumption of the hybrid process is 1047.8 MW while that of the PDH process is 972.3 MW and that of the SMR-HB process is 113.6 MW. The utility consumption of the PDH-HB process is 38.1 MW lower than the summation of those of the PDH and SMR-HB processes. Although the PDH-HB process requires the supply of additional electricity to require high purity N2 and H2, the SMR process also requires the supply of additional natural gas to provide heat. Overall, the total utility consumption of the hybrid process is 3.5% lower than the summation of those of the two individual processes. The equivalent utility consumption for the hybrid process will increase to 1247 MW while that for the PDH process is 1131 MW and that for the SMR-HB process is 136 MW, which is still lower than the summation of those of the two individual processes. In a word, the summed values of total and equivalent utility consumption of the PDH and SMR-HB processes are higher than that of the PDH-HB process.
System-Level Heat Integration Analysis
The integrated grand composite curves with respect to the PDH, SMR-HB, and PDH-HB processes are shown in Figure 5. In the PDH process, the pinch temperature is found to be 39.8 °C, and it can be seen in the composite curve that there is a large potential for integration above and below the pinch (Figure 5a). As observed in the heat curve, the product gas from the PDH reactors is usually 553 °C, so the high-temperature gas will be rapidly cooled to reach 300 °C after quenching. The temperature of the mixture will continue to decrease to 40 °C before entering the multistage compressor. The condenser temperatures of the depropanizer and P–P splitter are 42.7 and 40.6 °C, respectively. As a result, there is a long interval of thermal duty around 40–43 °C in the heat curve. The compressed gas will enter the cold box unit to be refrigerated to −95 °C to separate H2-rich gas. As for the cold curve, the reboiler temperatures of the de-ethanizer and P–P splitter are 32.3 and 52.8 °C, respectively. Likely, there is a long interval around 32.3 and 52.8 °C. The mixed propane feed gas needs to be heated to 620 °C, and there is also a long interval above 140 °C. In conclusion, the large cold utility requirements are due to the reactor effluent cooler and the P–P splitter condenser. The large hot utility requirements are due to the large heating requirements of the dehydrogenation reactors and the P–P splitter reboiler. There is potential for heat exchange in the temperature range from −95 to 550 °C. The minimum hot and cold utility requirements are 484.2 and 345.8 MW, respectively. The composite curves can be analyzed systematically by the heat exchanger network, which is presented in Figure S2.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Temperature–heat diagram for the (a) PDH process, (b) SMR-HB process, and (c) PDH-HB process and (d) heat duty comparison.
In the SMR-HB process, the pinch temperature is found to be 150.1 °C (Figure 5b). As shown in the heat curve, the reaction gases from the AR can be up to 1079 °C, and then the temperature of gases will decrease to 350 °C subsequently. Ammonia synthesis reactors with intermediate cooling are employed to improve the concentration of ammonia, so the outlet temperature will decrease to 420 °C. Meanwhile, the temperature of reactor effluent streams will continue to decrease to 40 °C before entering the NH3 flash separators. The temperature of the HT-WGS and LT-WGS effluent streams will reduce to 200 and 40 °C, respectively. The NH3 synthesis reaction gases are usually refrigerated to −30 °C to obtain a liquid ammonia product. As for the cold curve, a furnace is used to heat various feed gases and a steam reforming reactor in the temperature range of 200–830 °C. The waste heat from the HT-WGS and LT-WGS effluent streams is used to preheat water to 290 °C, and the feedwater is vaporized to 500 °C by using heat from the ammonia synthesis reactor and AR reactor effluent streams. There is the potential heat exchange in the temperature range from −30 to 830 °C. Hence, the minimum hot and cold utility requirements are 61.8 and 16.4 MW, respectively. The composite curves can be analyzed systematically by the heat exchanger network, which is presented in Figure S4.
In the PDH-HB process, the pinch temperature is found to be 35.4 °C (Figure 5c), and the temperature range of heat exchange is from −95 to 553 °C. The ammonia synthesis reaction is an exothermic reaction, which means that the outlet temperature of the ammonia synthesis reactor effluent streams will increase to 553 °C. The heat energy of effluent streams from the ammonia synthesis reactors is used to preheat the sweet syngas (N2 and H2) to 400 °C. In fact, this available heat from the ammonia reactor is only 22.2 MW. This value is only about 3% of the total heat duty. Therefore, the heat requirement for the PDH-HB process is not significantly lesser than that for the standalone PDH process. Thus, the minimum hot and cold utility requirements are 458.6 and 354.5 MW, respectively. The composite curves can also be analyzed systematically by the heat exchanger network, which is presented in Figure S6.
Figure 5d shows the minimum hot and cold streams utility of the three proposed processes. It is obvious that the total heat duty of the PDH-HB process is 813 MW that is lower than summation of those of the PDH (830 MW) and SMR-HB processes (78.2 MW). Therefore, the hybrid process can achieve a more efficient heat exchange capacity with hot and cold streams.
Economic Analysis
The values of equipment investment and operation costs are summarized and listed in Tables S8 and S9. As shown in Figure 6a, the total capital investment of the hybrid case is 1106 M$, which is lower than the summation of the two individual cases. It is easy to understand because the SMR process requires extra equipment for H2 production and subsequent gas purification. Specifically, the equipment cost of the reforming unit totally requires 129 M$. Besides, the added equipment costs of the WGS reactors and CO2 separation unit reach 66.9 M$. In contrast, high-purity H2 and N2 can be obtained separately by the PSA unit and ASU. The PSA unit only costs 64.0 M$, and the ASU only requires 28.9 M$ investment cost, which are significantly lower than the equipment costs of the SMR process. Therefore, the total capital investment costs of the PDH-HB plant are 123 M$ lower than the summation of those of the PDH and SMR-HB plants.
Figure 6
Figure 6. (a) Total capital investment costs of all plants and (b) operation costs of all plants.
Regarding the operation costs of the above plants (Figure 6b), the prices of feedstocks and utilities are shown in Table 4. As a result, the propane cost represents the main composition of the variable cost of production in PDH and PDH-HB cases, which is about 669 M$/year. Likewise, the electricity cost of the hybrid case is 139 M$/year. However, the electricity cost of the summation of PDH and SMR-HB processes is 123 M$/year, which is slightly lower than that of the hybrid case. The reason is simple that the PSA unit and ASU in the hybrid process both require electricity. Therefore, the operation costs of the PDH-HB process are 909 M$/year, while the PDH process will cost 852 M$/year and SMR-HB process will only cost 52.7 M$/year. In general, the cost of the hybrid case is slightly higher by 4.3 M$/year.

As for the total production cost, the result is listed in Figure 7. The total production cost of the hybrid process is 1022 M$/year, while for the same product yield, the total production costs of the standalone PDH and SMR-HB processes are 942 and 93.6 M$/year, respectively. The hybrid process remains 13.6 M$/year lower. Additionally, the payback time of the hybrid synthesis case is about 5.19 years, which is obviously lower than that of PDH (5.91 years) and SMR-HB (5.57 years) cases.

Sensitivity Analysis
The values of total production cost and payback time with respect to the price of propane, natural gas price, electricity price, and steam are summarized and listed in Table S10. The graphs for sensitivity analysis of the total production cost are shown in Figure 8. The results for the PDH-HB case are compared to the summed value of PDH and SMR-HB cases. The total production cost of the hybrid case changes from 975 to 1101 M$/year when the electricity price increases from 45 to 105 $/MW h, and the payback time increases from 4.25 to 8.05 years. However, the summed production cost of the PDH and SMR-HB cases changes from 997 to 1110 M$/year. The total production cost of the PDH-HB case is lower by 9–22 M$/year. The relative difference is 1–2% of the total production cost. Regardless of the change in the price of electricity, the production cost and payback time of two individual cases are still higher than PDH-HB case. Similarly, the production cost and payback time of the PDH-HB case also increase gradually along with the increase of the natural gas, steam, and propane price. The production cost and payback time of the two individual cases are both higher than those of the hybrid case. In a word, with the price of variable factors increasing, the production cost and payback time of the hybrid process will increase correspondingly, but the hybrid process is still more economically advantageous.
Figure 8
Figure 8. Sensitivity analysis on the total production cost and payback time for different variables: (a) electricity price, (b) natural gas price, (c) steam price, and (d) propane price.
In the above processes, the production of propylene is based on the current maximum scale. The influence of the PDH plant scale is further analyzed. Hence, sensitivity analysis for different propylene production scales is calculated, of which the result is shown in Figure 9. The concrete values are summarized and listed in Table S11. When the production scale becomes smaller, besides the total capital investment costs being reduced, the operation costs including various utility costs will also be reduced. It is obvious that as the scale of propylene production decreases from 900 to 450 kt/year, the normalized production cost, which is defined as the ratio of total production cost (M$/year) to propylene yield (kt/year), increases from 1.15 to 1.20. This is mainly because the relationship between equipment costs and product yield is not linear. At the same time, the payback time of the hybrid process will also increase from 5.19 to 8.38 with the annual propylene production dropping from 900 to 450 kt/year. It is apparent that the expansion of production scale is economically more favorable, but this is also limited by the development of technology. In summary, even at smaller propylene production scales, this hybrid process is still economically competitive with the standalone propylene and ammonia production processes.

Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In this study, a hybrid synthesis process for propylene and liquid ammonia production is proposed. The byproduct H2 from the PDH unit and the N2 from the ASU are mixed and sent to proceed to the downstream ammonia synthesis. The utility consumption and economic data of the hybrid system are investigated and compared with those of the individual propylene production and methane-to-ammonia process. Compared to the summation of two individual processes, the hybrid PDH-HB process is 38.1 MW lower in the utility consumption. As for the economic data, the PDH-HB process is more attractive due to the 10.1% lower capital investment than the summed data of two individual processes. Although the operation costs are slightly higher, the total production cost of the hybrid process is 13.6 M$/year lower. As a result, the payback time is lower than the two individual cases. Moreover, with the increase of resource price and the decrease of production scale, the production cost or normalized production cost and payback time of all processes increase, but the hybrid process still shows superior economic advantage. This study provides an instructive case for efficient utilization of the byproduct H2 from the PDH process with suitable value-added chemical production processes. Moreover, with the decrease of the production cost for green H2, the production technologies for green H2 from sustainable energy can be used to produce high value-added products in the future.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
