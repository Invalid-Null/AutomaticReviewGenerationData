Based on the multiple document extracts provided, there does not appear to be any specific or relevant information provided about propane dehydrogenation catalysts, reactions, or process improvements. The documents focus on techno-economic analyses comparing hybrid and standalone processes for propylene and ammonia production, without going into catalyst or reaction details for propane dehydrogenation specifically. Since no pertinent details are given, I have indicated that the documents are not relevant and have not included any catalyst or process details in the XML output. The output simply indicates that the documents are not relevant to propane dehydrogenation based on the information provided.
