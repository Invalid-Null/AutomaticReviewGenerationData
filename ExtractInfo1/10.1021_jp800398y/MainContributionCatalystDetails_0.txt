 Unfortunately, the provided document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation as it focuses on the diffusion of lithium ions on a fluorinated graphene surface. There is no mention of propane, propylene, PDH, or ODH. As such, I cannot extract any meaningful information about a catalyst or process enhancements for propane dehydrogenation.
