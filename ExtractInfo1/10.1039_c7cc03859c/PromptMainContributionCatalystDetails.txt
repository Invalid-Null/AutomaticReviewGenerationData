Strong metal-support interaction between Pt and SiO2 following high-temperature reduction: a catalytic interface for propane dehydrogenation†
Pt/SiO2 reduced at 1073 K exhibited a high catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation, primarily attributed to the electronic modification of Pt nanoparticles by a strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect. The SMSI was observed in the Pt/SiO2 system following direct reduction in H2 (>773 K), and was found to increase with increasing reduction temperature.
Supported metal catalysts are known as the most important materials for heterogeneous catalysis and are widely applied in the chemical industry and in the field of environmental protection. The use of oxides with high surface areas (>200 m2 g−1) to support metals increases the efficiency of the metals, especially in the case of noble metals. Although it has long been believed that there are no significant interactions between the metal and the support in most cases, a so-called strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) effect was firstly reported by Tauster in 1978.1 It has been shown that the adsorption of both H2 and CO on TiO2-supported group VIII metal catalysts is significantly suppressed following the reduction of the material at 773 K under H2, compared to the reduction at 473 K. This chemisorption behaviour is thought to result from metal–metal bonding between the group VIII metals and titanium cations with lower valences, or from the formation of intermetallic compounds. Metal oxides other than TiO2, which can be easily reduced to form cations with lower valences (such as CeO2, Nb2O5 and La2O3), also exhibit SMSI effects after high-temperature H2 reduction. In contrast, SiO2 and Al2O3 do not show SMSI. The reducibility of transition metal oxides acting as supports therefore plays a vital role in the occurrence of SMSI.2 This pioneering research stimulated numerous studies of SMSI. SMSI oxides such as Nb2O53 and V2O54 deposited on non-SMSI oxide (SiO2 or Al2O3) supports also show a strong interaction between the metal and the SMSI oxide (SMOI effects). Generally, SiO2 does not undergo SMSI or SMOI in the systems and is regarded as an inert support.
However, the present work demonstrates that the conventional understanding of SiO2-based SMSI may be limited. SMSI characteristics have been observed in a Pt/SiO2 system prepared via direct reduction with H2 at a high temperature (Scheme 1) by combining various analytical techniques such as X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), CO diffuse reflectance infrared transmission spectroscopy (CO-DRIFT), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The SMSI effect also strongly affected the catalytic properties of the material during propane dehydrogenation.
Scheme 1 Pt/SiO2 catalysts prepared by direct reduction.
A series of Pt/SiO2 catalysts were prepared by impregnating a SiO2 support with aqueous H2PtCl6·6H2O followed by treatment under different atmospheres (O2, N2 or H2) at various temperatures. All catalysts showed a metallic Pt phase with different crystal sizes even after the oxidation treatment (Fig. S1, ESI†). However, only the H2-treated catalysts exhibited catalytic activities. The propane conversion initially increased with increasing reduction temperature, reaching the highest value at 1073 K, and then decreased at higher temperatures (Fig. 1 and Fig. S2, ESI†). The Pt/SiO2_1073 K H2 material (where the last two components of the name indicate the treatment temperature and atmosphere) showed the highest activity, giving a propane conversion of 21.3% and selectivity for propylene of 94.4%. Over a reaction time of 3 h, the catalytic activity was found to gradually decrease. Since there was no obvious aggregation of Pt nanoparticles, the decrease in activity is probably assignable to the coke formation and the associated blockage of active sites (Fig. S3–S5, ESI†).
Fig. 1 The effect of reduction temperature in a H2 atmosphere on the activity of Pt/SiO2 catalysts.
The effects of the treatment atmosphere and reduction temperature on the catalytic activities of the Pt/SiO2 catalysts indicated that the presence and strength of the interaction between Pt and SiO2 varied with these two factors. XRD data and TEM observations (Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†) were used to determine the Pt crystal size and particle size, respectively, of the reduced Pt/SiO2 catalysts (Table 1). At reduction temperatures as high as 1273 K, the BET surface area drastically decreased, while the Pt particle size remained small (in the range of 2–3 nm) in conjunction with a slight increase in the crystallite size. The similar Pt/Si atom ratios found in reduced Pt/SiO2 catalysts from XRF measurements show that there was no loss of Pt.

It is worth noting that the extent of CO adsorption was drastically decreased to an undetectable amount in the case of Pt/SiO2_1273 K H2. Even though small Pt metal particles (3.2 nm average size) were found to be present on Pt/SiO2_1273 K H2 from TEM observations, the lack of CO adsorption suggests that its local or detailed structure was very different from those of Pt/SiO2_773 K H2 and Pt/SiO2_1073 K H2.
Pt/SiO2 catalysts reduced at various temperatures were examined by TEM to determine the local structure of the Pt metal.5 A lattice spacing of 0.23 nm, which is consistent with the (111) plane of the Pt metal, was observed in each case (Fig. 2 and Fig. S8, Table S1, ESI†). In the case of Pt/SiO2_773 K H2, the interface between Pt and SiO2 was characterized by necking and a large contact angle, suggesting a weak interaction. The catalyst that reduced at a higher temperature of 1073 K exhibited hemispherical Pt particles and the lattice array of Pt particles matched that of the SiO2 support. This interfacial morphology suggests a chemical interaction between Pt and SiO2 following the treatment at 1073 K, likely due to the formation of a Pt–Si alloy. However, the similar lattice parameters of the Pt metal and Pt3Si alloy (Tables S1 and S2, ESI†) made it difficult to definitively assign the observed crystal to the Pt metal or Pt–Si alloy. Surprisingly, we also observed the migration of SiO2 onto the upper surfaces of the Pt nanoparticles when Pt/SiO2 was reduced at 1273 K under a flow of H2 (Fig. 2). A SiO2 layer with a thickness of approximately 1 nm was clearly observed to cover the Pt metal in Pt/SiO2_1273 K H2. This finding confirmed the high-temperature encapsulation phenomenon suggested by the CO adsorption data.
Fig. 2 TEM images of Pt/SiO2 catalysts reduced at 1273 K.
The changes in the chemisorption, catalytic and structural properties of these materials that are characteristic of the SMSI effect strongly indicate an electronic interaction at the Pt–SiO2 interface. The exact electronic states of Pt in these reduced Pt/SiO2 catalysts were determined by XPS analysis (Fig. S9, ESI†).6 There were no clear chemical shifts in the binding energies of the Pt 4f electrons for the Pt/SiO2_773 K H2 and Pt/SiO2_1073 K H2 catalysts. However, interestingly, the XPS intensity of Pt significantly decreased when the precursor was reduced at 1273 K. The Pt signal in the XPS spectra of Pt/SiO2_1273 K H2 was quite weak, in agreement with the CO adsorption and TEM observations. These data present strong evidence for the encapsulation phenomenon in this Pt/SiO2 system at high reduction temperatures.
In contrast to XPS surface analysis, X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data reflect the bulk properties of the target elements.7 XANES is sensitive to the charge states of metals, adsorbates and support materials, and thus is a helpful means of studying the electronic structures of catalytic materials. Furthermore, this powerful technique can detect the target element in both crystals and amorphous, microcrystalline structures, thus complementing XRD, which requires large crystals and well-ordered regions in the material. In the present work, the Pt metal particle sizes on the reduced Pt/SiO2 catalysts were found to be as small as 2 nm. Therefore, XAFS including XANES is a suitable tool to exactly determine the electronic states of Pt on SiO2.
The Pt L3-edge XANES spectra of the Pt/SiO2 precursor and Pt/SiO2 catalysts reduced at 773, 1073 and 1273 K, as well as Pt foil and PtCl2 as reference samples are shown in Fig. 3(A). The Pt/SiO2 precursor generated a spectrum similar to that of the PtCl2 reference, and Pt–Cl bonding is seen in the EXAFS spectra (Fig. S10, ESI†). This result suggests that the Pt species remained in the cation state during the impregnation step. However, the subsequent reduction by H2 during catalyst preparation decreased the white line intensity, such that the white line intensities at the Pt L3-edges of the Pt/SiO2 catalysts reduced at 773, 1073 and 1273 K were similar to that of Pt foil, indicating the presence of metallic Pt on all catalysts. The white line intensity also decreased with increasing reduction temperature. The intensity of Pt/SiO2_1273 K H2 was the lowest among all the samples.
Fig. 3 (A) Pt L3-edge XANES spectra and (B) variations in unfilled d-states for the Pt foil, PtCl2 and different catalyst samples (as denoted in the figure).
The white lines of Pt/SiO2_773 K H2 and the Pt foil were observed at 11561.0 and 11562.0 eV, respectively, and the white line intensity of Pt/SiO2_773 K H2 was slightly higher than that of the Pt foil. These differences may have resulted from the nano-sized Pt particles (approximately 2.4 nm) in Pt/SiO2_773 K. The Pt L3 edge X-ray absorption white lines correspond to the electronic transitions from 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 core level states and directly reflect the electronic states of the vacant d orbitals of both 5d3/2 and 5d5/2 levels.8 Our data for the Pt/SiO2 catalysts and the Pt foil suggest that the Pt atoms in the nanoparticles were more electron-deficient than those in the bulk Pt foil. Calculations to determine the number of unfilled d states (hTs) based on the Pt L3 and L2-edge XANES spectra (Fig. 3(A) and Fig. S11, ESI†) show that Pt/SiO2_773 K H2 had a greater number of unfilled d-states (hTs = 1.79) compared to the Pt foil (hTs = 1.60) (Fig. 3(B)). This result demonstrates that the well dispersed Pt particles on Pt/SiO2_773 K H2 have a greater degree of d-band vacancy than the bulk Pt foil.
With increasing reduction temperature, the white line intensities at the Pt L3 edges of the Pt/SiO2 catalysts decreased, suggesting that the reduction temperature had the opposite effect to the particle size on the electronic state of Pt. The Pt in these materials became much more electron-rich with increasing reduction temperature. These profound changes may have resulted from the electron transfer from SiOx (x < 2) cations to the Pt metal. Pt–Si intermetallic compounds such as Pt3Si were also likely formed in the interlayer between the Pt metal and the support. As reported by Lamber,9 the lower electronegativity of Si compared to Pt (Pt 2.3, Si 1.9) promotes electron donation from Si to Pt in Pt–Si alloys. The present study indicates that the electron transfer from the partially reduced SiO2 support to Pt increased with increasing reduction temperature (representing an electronic effect). In addition, the SiOx (x < 2) species gradually migrated onto the Pt surfaces, leading to a complete coverage of Pt nanoparticles in Pt/SiO2_1273 K H2 (representing a geometric effect).
In situ DRIFT spectroscopy was also used to probe the surface chemical properties of Pt on SiO2 by assessing adsorbed CO.10 Since the Pt nanoparticles were encapsulated by a SiO2 layer on Pt/SiO2_1273 K H2, only the spectra of Pt/SiO2_773 K H2 and Pt/SiO2_1073 K H2 are shown in Fig. 4(A and B).
Fig. 4 Selected DRIFT spectra of CO adsorbed on (A) Pt/SiO2_773 K H2 and (B) Pt/SiO2_1073 K H2.
A peak at approximately 1850 cm−1 corresponding to bridge-bonded CO is not observed for both samples. Two peaks in the regions of 2076–2078 and 2084–2086 cm−1 are observed for Pt/SiO2_773 K H2 after its exposure to CO. The peaks at 2076–2078 cm−1 can be assigned to linearly adsorbed CO on Pt sites with minimal coordination, such as steps, edges and corners. In contrast, the peaks at 2084–2086 cm−1 result from CO adsorbed on Pt terrace sites.11
A comparison between all the adsorption/desorption data for Pt/SiO2_773 K H2 and Pt/SiO2_1073 K H2 shows that the spectral features are clearly different in the two cases. The main differences are: (i) unlike Pt/SiO2_773 K H2, the ν CO band for Pt/SiO2_1073 K H2 does not exhibit shoulders or tails but rather is a single peak, reflecting the homogeneous surfaces of Pt atoms in the catalyst; (ii) at full coverage, the band position for Pt/SiO2_1073 K H2 is located in a lower wavenumber range compared to that for Pt/SiO2_773 K H2 (2065–2071 cm−1vs. 2086 or 2078 cm−1); and (iii) during desorption experiments, the desorption peak retained its symmetrical shape throughout the entire sequence. The linearly bonded CO on Pt atoms appears to have been almost completely desorbed at 373 K from Pt/SiO2_773 K H2, whereas CO was still present on Pt/SiO2_1073 K H2.
These observations demonstrate that the SMSI between Pt and the SiO2 support had both a geometric and an electronic effect on the Pt atoms. Geometrically, the presence of more homogeneous Pt sites on Pt/SiO2_1073 K H2 indicates that the reduced SiO2 originating from the SMSI effect probably covers the steps, edges and corners of the Pt nanoclusters. The uncovered Pt sites on Pt–Sn/SiO2 would primarily consist of terraces, corresponding to the lower wavenumber peaks in the CO DRIFT spectra. This geometrical modification of Pt atoms guarantees the high dispersion of Pt and suppresses the side reactions such as hydrogenolysis that requires larger ensemble size than dehydrogenation.12 Thus more active and selective sites were offered for propane dehydrogenation.
Electronically, the lower wavenumber peaks in the CO DRIFT spectra over Pt/SiO2_1073 K H2 and its XANES analysis imply that Pt atoms on it became more electron-richer via the donation of electrons from SiOx.13 The downward shift of the d band center of Pt was also reported for some Pt atoms with high electron density (e.g. Pt–Sn surfaces).14 This modified electronic state changes the adsorption properties of Pt. A downshift of the d-band center gives a weaker binding of 1-propyl to the catalyst surface and a higher energy barrier for propane dehydrogenation. On the other hand, electron-richer Pt atoms reduce the heat of propylene adsorption, thus promoting the desorption of propylene and inhibiting the successive deep dehydrogenation. The highest catalytic activity observed on Pt/SiO2_1073 K H2 indicated that the compromise between 1-propyl adsorption, activation and propylene desorption reaches the best situation on this catalyst.
In conclusion, the SMSI effect has been demonstrated in the Pt/SiO2 system following direct reduction, and was found to increase with the reduction temperature. The electronic and geometric properties of Pt atoms in this system are evidently modified by SMSI. The presence of more electron-rich Pt and the exposure of a greater Pt atom surface area could potentially be responsible for the high catalytic activity of this Pt/SiO2 material during propane dehydrogenation (Scheme 2).
