 Based on my analysis of the provided document, this work does not appear to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document focuses on the catalytic dehydrogenation and aromatization of ethane, rather than propane. As such, I do not have any specific catalyst details or performance enhancements to report related to propane dehydrogenation in my output.
