 Based on my analysis, the provided documents do not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Since there are no extracts with pertinent details, I have indicated this in the XML output:

<output>
  <Relevance>No</Relevance>
</output>

The documents focus on catalytic conversion of ethane via dehydrogenation and dehydroaromatization processes, but do not discuss propane dehydrogenation specifically. As such, I have no catalyst details or performance enhancements to report in the XML structure. Please let me know if you need me to clarify or expand my response. I'd be happy to reformat my output if provided with documents containing relevant propane dehydrogenation information.
