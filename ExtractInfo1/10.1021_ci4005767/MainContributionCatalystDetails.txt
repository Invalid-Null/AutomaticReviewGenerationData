 Based on the multiple document excerpts provided, it does not appear that any of them contain relevant information about propane dehydrogenation catalysts. Each excerpt indicates that the documents discuss computational design of allosteric modulators for the heat shock protein Hsp90, with no mention of propane, propylene, PDH or ODH.

Since none of the documents seem to be related to propane dehydrogenation research, here is an appropriate XML output:
