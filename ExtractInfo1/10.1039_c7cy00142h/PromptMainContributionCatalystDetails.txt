Insights into Cr/SiO2 catalysts during dehydrogenation of propane: an operando XAS investigation†
In situ and operando XAS spectroscopic methods were applied to monitor the variations in the oxidation state and in the local structure of the chromium sites in a 2.0Cr/SiO2-DHS catalyst during propane dehydrogenation under non-oxidative and different oxidative conditions. The spectroscopic data have been compared to the catalytic performances. Although the majority of the specialized literature ascribes the propane dehydrogenation activity mainly to CrIII species and only a few works report the presence of small amounts of CrII species, our data unequivocally demonstrate the co-presence of both CrIII and CrII species during the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The relative amount of the two chromium phases has been estimated by analyzing both the XANES and EXAFS spectra with a two-phase fitting approach. It was found that the CrIII-phase prevails when oxygen is present in the reaction mixture and when the reaction is performed at low flow or under static conditions. The amount of the CrIII-phase correlates well with the propane conversion. In contrast, the selectivity to propene correlates with the amount of the CrII-phase, at least when propane dehydrogenation is performed under oxidative conditions. Although other phenomena surely contribute to the overall catalytic performances of Cr/SiO2 catalysts, our results indicate that the relative proportion of the CrII and CrIII phases plays a role in influencing the selectivity of the propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction.
1. Introduction
Propene and ethene are among the most important building blocks in the chemical industry, being extensively used for the production of both large volume commodities and specialty chemicals. At present, the industrial production of light olefins is almost entirely based on non-oxidative processing of oil by-products, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking.1–3 These processes are high-energy demanding and scarcely selective toward the production of a single olefin. For these reasons, alternative on-purpose technologies are gaining increasing interest. Among them, the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is the most direct and selective way to produce propene. Small amounts of propane are contained in shale gas, which nowadays provides an economical alternative to crude oil. Although some of the reaction features (e.g. the strong endothermic character of the reaction) still limit the full development of commercial processes, the current market conditions and the high price difference between propane and propene incentivize the research in this field.1–3
In this scenario, the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is a promising alternative process, which does not present the thermodynamic limitations shown by non-oxidative dehydrogenation, operates at much lower temperatures, and minimizes coke formation, with a consequent increase of the catalyst stability.1,4–10 In this process, an oxidant is added to the reagent mixture with the function to combust the hydrogen formed during the reaction, thus ensuring a full conversion of the paraffin. The main challenge is to avoid the occurrence of consecutive and parallel combustion reactions in order to maintain a high olefin selectivity. In this respect, the use of carbon dioxide as a mild oxidant has attracted particular attention. Indeed, CO2 is thermodynamically stable and kinetically inert, is cheap and abundant, and has a high heat capacity that can be useful to minimize the hot spot phenomena usually leading to undesired side reactions.8,11,12 It has been suggested that CO2 may improve the yield of propene by two independent pathways: 1) participating as an oxidizing agent in the red–ox cycle involving the catalyst (following a pathway in agreement with the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism) and 2) removing the hydrogen produced in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by the reverse water-gas shift reaction.11,13–18
Although several catalyst formulations have been proposed for the ODH of propane,1,4–10,19–24 supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out among the most promising catalysts.25–38 It is worth noticing that CrOx-based catalysts are industrially employed also in the direct dehydrogenation of propane.1,3 Several factors influence the catalytic performance, such as the chromium loading, the type of the support, and the preparation method. In particular, high chromium dispersion seems fundamental for achieving a high catalytic activity. For this reason, high surface area materials are preferentially used as supports, among which alumina, silica and mesoporous silica-based materials (such as mesoporous MCM-41 and SBA-15).15,30,31 Understanding the nature of the active chromium sites in chromium-based catalysts under ODH (or direct dehydrogenation) conditions is fundamental for optimizing the catalyst properties and limiting catalyst deactivation, but it is extremely challenging because it requires the application of operando characterization techniques. Up to now, diffuse reflectance UV-vis and Raman spectroscopic techniques have been mainly applied,28,39–43 in a few cases directly into the dehydrogenation reactor.44–49 On freshly prepared catalysts, a number of surface species with different oxidation states (+6, +5, +3, +2) and speciation (chromates, polychromates, crystalline and amorphous chromia) have been spectroscopically identified, although at high chromium dispersion the +6 oxidation state prevails.15,30,31,37,39–45,47,50–58 It is widely accepted that under reaction conditions the reagent mixtures reduce the chromium oxide species with the sequential formation of adsorbed acetone, formates and acetates and the gradual deposition of hydrocarbons (either aliphatic and unsaturated/aromatics).58 However, the oxidation state, the coordination and the speciation of the reduced chromium species are still debated. The dehydrogenation activity has been mostly attributed to dispersed and coordinatively unsaturated CrIII species, although also small amorphous CrIII clusters and CrII species have been detected and suggested as active sites.17,18,27,31,32,57–66 Several cycles between various red–ox chromium species have been proposed, including CrVI/CrIII,27,31,60 CrV/CrIII,61 and CrIII/CrII.17,32,59 Determining the individual contributions of these species to the catalytic performance has been proven to be extremely challenging.
Recently, we have reported the synthesis, systematic physical–chemical characterization and catalytic testing of a series of Cr/SiO2 materials prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHS), having a chromium loading in the 0.25–2.00 wt% range, targeting ODH conditions as closest as possible to those for industrial applications.34,36 XANES data of reacted catalysts indicated that when CO2 is used as an oxidant in the ODH of propane, the average oxidation state of the chromium sites can be as low as +2, whereas it is close to +3 in the presence of O2 as an oxidant. In this work, we have extended our spectroscopic investigation in order to gain more insights into the oxidation state and local structure of the chromium species during the ODH of propane as a function of the reagent composition and of the reaction conditions. Our attention was focused on the catalyst with the highest chromium loading (2 wt%), hereafter labelled 2.0Cr/SiO2-DHS, which exhibited the best catalytic performance. We selected X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) as the technique of choice to monitor the changes undergone by the chromium species during the reaction. Indeed, the XAS technique is element-selective and allows monitoring of the actual state of the chromium sites even in the presence of coke. At first, we performed a detailed XANES and EXAFS investigation on the 2.0Cr/SiO2-DHS catalyst recovered after the ODH of propane in the presence of different oxidants. Successively, the same catalyst was monitored by operando XANES spectroscopy. To the best of our knowledge, in very few works,63 XAS was applied under operando conditions to monitor the behaviour of the chromium species during the ODH (or dehydrogenation) of propane. Most of the time, XAS data refer to catalysts recovered after the reaction and often it is not clear if they have been exposed to air or not, thus increasing the confusion on the red–ox state of the chromium species. Our spectroscopic data are then compared to the catalytic performances, allowing us to postulate a correlation between the oxidation state of the chromium sites during the ODH of propane and the selectivity to propene.
2. Experimental
2.1 Catalyst preparation and treatment
The catalyst was prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis (DHS), following the protocol usually employed to obtain mesoporous MCM-41 structures, according to the procedure described elsewhere.35 Briefly, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (Sigma-Aldrich), pure fumed silica (Aerosil 300, Degussa) and chromium nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as the structure-directing agent, silica and chromium sources, respectively. Tetramethylammonium hydroxide (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to maintain a pH of ca. 11.0. The relative amount of Cr(NO3)3 was adjusted in order to attain a chromium loading of 2.0 wt%. The resulting sample will be referred to as 2.0Cr/SiO2-DHS. The synthesis gel was stirred at 35 °C (water bath) for 2 h, transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and kept at 100 °C for 48 h. The obtained powder/liquid mixture was filtered at room temperature and carefully washed with distilled water (three doses of 50 ml). The sample was then dried at 100 °C and placed into a gas-flow furnace, where the temperature was raised to 600 °C (heating rate: 2 °C min−1) under flowing N2 (1 atm, 2 L min−1). The flow was then switched to O2 (1 atm, 2 L min−1) for calcination for 8 h. The final cooling to room temperature occurred under O2 flow. A previous investigation conducted on a series of analogous materials having chromium loading in the range 0.25–2.0 wt% indicated that the 2.0Cr/SiO2-DHS catalyst does not retain the ordered mesoporous structure characteristic of MCM-41 materials, although it still shows a very high specific surface area (670 m2 g−1, total pore volume of 0.41 cm3 g−1).35
Two series of experiments were performed with different set-ups. In the first series (Series 1-), the catalyst (in the powder form) was activated inside a quartz tube in an O2 atmosphere (equilibrium pressure PO2 = 100 mbar) at 600 °C for 1 hour (two times for 30 minutes, oxidation step in Table 1). Successively, the reaction tube was degassed and the catalyst was treated at the same temperature in the presence of different reagent mixtures (propane ODH step in Table 1). In all the cases, the propane ODH reactions were run for 30 minutes; then, the reaction cell was degassed at 600 °C, and the catalyst was cooled down to room temperature under dynamic vacuum. The same catalyst was also reduced in the presence of CO at 350 °C, in order to have a reference for CrII sites (reduction step in Table 1). In this case, a typical protocol for the conversion of CrVI into CrII was followed, on the basis of a long-standing experience in the field of chromium-based catalysis for ethylene polymerization (the so-called Phillips catalyst).67 After activation in O2 at 600 °C, the sample was cooled down to 350 °C, treated in CO (PCO = 100 mbar) and outgassed at the same temperature. The treatment in CO was repeated twice (30 minutes each step), followed by degassing at 350 °C, in order to remove chemisorbed CO. The sample was finally cooled to room temperature under dynamic vacuum. Table 1 summarizes the samples measured during experiments of Series 1- and their corresponding nomenclature.

In a second series of experiments (Series 2-), the catalyst was measured directly under the reaction conditions, i.e. in the presence of reagents and products at 600 °C. The catalyst was measured in the form of powder inside a quartz capillary 1.5 mm in diameter and 10 μm in wall thickness, placed in between two small regions of quartz wool. The capillary was connected to a gas-dosing system with mass-flow controllers to flow different gas mixtures, and inserted inside an oven equipped with a temperature controller. The reaction products were qualitatively detected with a mass spectrometer placed at the end of the capillary. The experimental details (gas mixture, total flow, reaction temperature) and sample nomenclature are summarized in Table 2. A typical operando experiment was performed according to the following sequence: a) oxidative pre-treatment in dried air (21% O2 in He, 40 ml min−1), increasing the temperature up to 600 °C (10 °C min−1) and leaving the sample at 600 °C for 30 min; b) changing the flow from O2 to the reactant mixture (different compositions, either 40 ml min−1 or 8 ml min−1) for 1 hour (first run); c) successive regeneration was achieved by switching back to dried air for 30 min; d) a second ODH run was performed by changing the flow again to the reagent mixture. At the end of every step, the catalyst was flushed with He flow for 5 min.

a In order to allow a complete mixture of the gases, a flow of 100 ml min−1 was set in the line, and successively split into two parts through a needle-valve just before the entrance of the capillary, thus achieving the desired flow value in the reactor.
2.2 Characterization techniques
Cr K-edge XAS spectra were collected at the BM23 beamline of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF, Grenoble, France). The white beam was monochromatized using a Si(111) double crystal; harmonic rejection was performed by using silicon mirrors (4 mrad). The intensity of the incident beam was monitored using an ionization chamber. The spectrum of the reference Cr2O3 (Sigma-Aldrich) was measured in transmission mode, whereas the XAS spectra of the 2.0Cr/SiO2-DHS samples were collected in fluorescence mode by means of a silicon drift detector.
For experiments of Series 1-, the catalyst powder was recovered at the end of each reaction without exposure to air and introduced inside an argon-filled glove-box, where it was pressed in the form of a self-standing pellet. The pellet was placed inside a small cryostat, closed under an argon atmosphere. Finally, the cryostat was transferred to the BM23 beamline. Measurements were performed at liquid He temperature and under dynamic vacuum (pressure lower than 1.0 × 10−6 mbar) in order to avoid contamination of the samples. This experimental set-up allowed us to collect both XANES and EXAFS spectra of high quality. The XANES part of the spectra was acquired with an energy step of 0.4 eV and an integration time of 2 s per point. The EXAFS part of the spectra was collected up to 15 Å−1 with a variable sampling step in energy, resulting in Δk = 0.05 Å−1, and an integration time that linearly increases as a function of k from 5 to 20 s per point to account for the low signal-to-noise ratio at high k values. For each sample, six equivalent EXAFS spectra were acquired and averaged before data analysis. The extraction of the χ(k) functions was performed using the Athena program. Once extracted, the k3-weighted χ(k) functions were Fourier transformed in a variable Δk range (Δk = 1.0–13.0 Å−1 for samples after catalysis, and Δk = 1.0–11.0 Å−1 for oxidized and reduced samples). The fits were performed in R-space in a variable ΔR range, using the Artemis program. Phase and amplitudes were calculated by means of the FEFF6.0 code, using as input the structure of Cr2O3. In experiments of Series 2-, quick XANES spectra were acquired with an energy step of 0.4 eV and an integration time of 2 s per point, up to k = 5 Å−1 in order to allow easy and reliable normalization. Each XANES spectrum required an acquisition time of about 12 minutes. The XANES spectra were normalized using the Athena program. The adopted experimental set-up (low Cr loading, fluorescence acquisition, capillary set-up, quite small scattering volume) did not allow collection of EXAFS spectra with a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 A summary of the catalytic performances
The catalytic performances of the 2.0Cr/SiO2-DHS catalyst in the ODH of propane in the presence of different oxidants and in the direct dehydrogenation reaction have been throughly discussed in our previous paper.36 Briefly, we found that the 2.0Cr/SiO2-DHS catalyst performs very well in the ODH of propane, with the initial propane conversion values of ca. 70, 75 and 80% in the presence of CO2, O2 and CO2 + O2, respectively, compared to ca. 60% in the absence of oxidants (direct dehydrogenation). A certain catalyst deactivation occurs at long reaction time that, however, is not irreversible. Indeed, independent of the dehydrogenation conditions, the behaviour of the catalyst in the first run coincides with that observed at subsequent 5–8 runs after regeneration. The highest selectivity to propene was observed in the presence of CO2 as an oxidant: an initial propene yield of ca. 47% was observed, which remains as high as ca. 40% after 1000 min of reaction. At the same time, the ethene yield remains quite low throughout the entire duration of the test, suggesting that propane ODH with CO2 as an oxidant on Cr/SiO2 catalysts can be of actual interest for the production of mixtures of C2 and C3 olefins highly rich in propene. The selectivity to propene was much lower in the absence of oxidants and drastically decreases also when O2 is present in the reaction mixture. In this latter case, ethene becomes the main product, likely resulting from enhanced cracking of propane in the presence of O2.
Our finding that the selectivity to propene reaches the highest value when the reaction is performed in the presence of CO2 is in good agreement with the specialized literature. The role of CO2 in the ODH of propane has been a matter of debate. It has been demonstrated that it plays a double role.11,13–18 From one side, it sequesters the hydrogen produced in the direct dehydrogenation of propane through the reverse water-gas shift reaction, hence shifting the reaction equilibrium towards higher paraffin conversion. On the other side, it participates as an oxidizing agent in the red–ox cycle involving the catalyst. On this basis, it is expected that the red–ox behaviour of the chromium species might be different in the presence of different oxidants. To clarify the possible correlation between the type of oxidant, the oxidation state and the coordination of the chromium species on one side, and the selectivity in the ODH of propane on the other side, we undertook a detailed XAS investigation, as follows.
3.2 Spectroscopic properties of the catalysts recovered at the end of the direct and oxidative propane dehydrogenation reactions
3.2.1 The two extremes: oxidized and CO-reduced 2.0Cr/SiO2-DHS catalysts Before discussing the properties of the catalyst under the reaction conditions, it is worth commenting on the main properties of 1-ox and 1-red samples, which are at the two extremes in terms of the oxidation state and are useful for the successive analysis. Fig. 1 shows the normalized Cr K-edge XANES spectra (part a) of samples 1-ox (black) and 1-red (grey), and their derivative signals (part b). Both spectra are very similar to those reported in the literature for CrVI/SiO2 and CrII/SiO2 samples having lower chromium loading and employed for ethene polymerization (Phillips catalyst).30,51,55,67–75 In particular, the spectrum of 1-ox shows an intense pre-edge peak centered at 5994 eV, characteristic of CrVI species in a Td-like symmetry; the edge value, evaluated at the maximum of the derivative curve, is 6007 eV. In the spectrum of 1-red, the edge is downward shifted to 6002 eV, testifying that the treatment in CO caused a reduction of the CrVI sites. In addition, an intense and well-resolved pre-edge peak is observed at 5994.2 eV, previously assigned to a Cr1s → Cr4p transition, and considered the fingerprint of isolated CrII sites.51,68,69,72 Finally, two weak pre-edge features are present at 5988 and 5990 eV: the same peaks were previously reported for the CrII/SiO2 Phillips catalyst and assigned to Cr1s → (Cr3d + O2p) dipole-forbidden transitions.72 In the following, we will consider the XANES spectrum of 1-red as representative of highly uncoordinated CrII sites. Previous experience67 and the specialized literature76,77 demonstrate that the adopted procedure stoichiometrically converts all the mono-chromates to CrII sites releasing CO2, which is easily removed at the reduction temperature.

The Fourier transforms of the k3-weighted χ(k) functions of samples 1-ox and 1-red are shown in Fig. 2 in both modulus (part a) and imaginary parts (part b). The details of the EXAFS data analysis are given in the ESI,† the best fits are reported in Fig. 2 (full curves), and the results of the fit are summarized in Table 3. The spectrum of 1-ox (black dotted curve) is dominated by an intense signal centered around 1.1 Å (not corrected in phase). Only very weak signals are observed at longer distances, providing evidence that the chromium sites are essentially isolated. According to the fit, the local structure of the chromium sites in 1-ox is well represented by the structure ox in Fig. 2a: on average, the chromium sites are in the form of mono-chromates, with two oxygen ligands at 1.60 Å (double-bonded) and two oxygen ligands at 1.78 Å (single-bonded). It is interesting to observe that the Debye–Waller factors are quite small for both ligands (indicative of a quite homogeneous situation), but smaller for the CrO contribution, as expected because the double bond is more rigid than the single one.

Experimental data are shown as dotted curves, and the best fits (ΔR = 1.0–3.0 Å range) are reported with full lines. The insets show the small clusters used to fit the EXAFS data of 1-ox and 1-red, with indication of the ligand distances as obtained from the fits.

The spectrum of 1-red (dotted grey curve) is characterized by a much weaker first shell signal at a longer distance (1.3 Å). On average, each chromium site is surrounded by two oxygen ligands at a distance of 1.90 ± 0.02 Å and by two silicon ligands at 2.71 ± 0.03 Å. In addition, one oxygen ligand at 2.13 ± 0.04 Å is necessary to fit the data, which likely belongs to surface siloxane bridges weakly bonded to the chromium sites. Similar local environments have been previously found for other CrII/SiO2 samples,51,72,75 although the average number of the second-shell oxygen ligands and their distance change from author to author. This structural variability might be a consequence of the different types of the silica support, of the synthesis method, and/or of the activation procedure. It is worth noticing that most of the literature studies agree on the description of the local structure of the chromium sites when they are in the +6 oxidation state, while slightly different structures are reported for the same Cr/SiO2 samples when chromium is in the +2 oxidation state. This indicates that, once reduced, the chromium sites are much more flexible than CrVI and can accommodate at the silica surface, trying to minimize their energy. These small structural differences in CrII sites reflect the structural flexibility of supported metal sites, which is often the key to explain their catalytic performances.78
The XANES and EXAFS spectra of 1-ox and 1-red indicate that in the fully oxidized and fully reduced catalysts the chromium sites are grafted in the monomeric form. This was further confirmed by DR UV-vis measurements (as reported in our previous work).36 In this respect, there are no differences with regard to what was previously reported in the literature for other Cr/SiO2 samples, irrespective of the type of silica and of the synthesis procedure.30,51,67,68,71,74,79,80
3.2.2 The 2.0Cr/SiO2-DHS catalyst after direct and oxidative propane dehydrogenation reactions: effect of the reagent mixture During experiments of Series 1-, the 2.0Cr/SiO2-DHS catalyst was recovered at the end of a series of propane direct and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions performed under static conditions in the presence of different reagent mixtures, as summarized in Table 1. XAS spectra were acquired without exposing the samples to air; hence, they should reflect the status of the catalyst in action. The normalized XANES spectra and their derivative signals for the 2.0Cr/SiO2-DHS catalyst treated under different reaction conditions are shown in Fig. 3, compared to those of the Cr2O3 reference compound. The XANES spectrum of the catalyst recovered after direct propane dehydrogenation (sample 1-a) has the edge (evaluated at the maximum of the derivative curve, Fig. 3b) at 6002 eV, and is characterized by an intense and broad pre-edge peak centered around 5996 eV and by two weak pre-edge peaks at 5988 and 5990 eV. All these features are indicative of the presence of isolated CrII species, as testified by the close similarity of the spectrum to that of 1-red (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, the feature at 5996 eV is less intense than that for 1-red and in the white-line region a weak peak around 6006 eV is indicative of the co-presence of a small fraction of Cr2O3-like species.71 The XANES spectrum of the catalyst after the ODH of propane in the presence of CO2 (sample 1-b) is practically undistinguishable from the previous one.
Fig. 3 Normalized XANES spectra (part a) and the corresponding derivative signals (part b) of the 2.0Cr/SiO2-DHS catalyst recovered after the direct dehydrogenation of propane (1-a) and after the ODH of propane in the presence of different oxidants (1-b, 1-c, 1-d). Also, the spectrum of a Cr2O3 reference is shown for comparison. The inset in part a) shows a magnification of the pre-edge region.
In contrast, when the ODH reaction is performed in the presence of O2 (sample 1-c), the XANES spectrum shows a double edge at 5999 and 6003 eV (see derivative signal, Fig. 3b), very similar to that of Cr2O3. In the pre-edge region, two weak pre-edge peaks are observed at 5990 and 5993 eV, as in the spectrum of Cr2O3. Finally, instead of the intense pre-edge peak around 5996 eV characteristic of CrII species, only a shoulder is present. Hence, also in this case, CrII and CrIII sites co-exist in the sample, although CrIII seem to prevail. The spectrum of the catalyst recovered after the ODH reaction in the presence of O2 + CO2 (sample 1-d) is even more similar to that of Cr2O3. In particular, in the white-line region, two peaks are observed at 6008 and 6010 eV, which are characteristic of the multiple-scattering contributions of Cr2O3-like particles. As for sample 1-c, a shoulder is observed instead of the peak at 5996 eV characteristic of CrII species.
In all the cases, the XANES spectra suggest that two chromium phases are co-present in the 2.0Cr/SiO2-DHS catalyst during the propane ODH reaction: i) a Cr2O3-like phase, where the chromium sites have a +3 oxidation state and display a pseudo-octahedral coordination, and ii) a CrII-containing phase, where the chromium sites are highly uncoordinated as for isolated CrII sites obtained after CO reduction (1-red sample). In the following, we will call these two different chromium phases CrII-phase and CrIII-phase. The amount of each phase present in the catalysts was evaluated by fitting each spectrum with a linear combination of the spectra of Cr2O3 and 1-red samples. The results of the fits, summarized in Table 4, demonstrate that during the propane ODH reaction the starting CrVI sites are reduced to a mixture of CrIII and CrII, whose relative proportion depends on the ODH reaction conditions: without oxidants (sample 1-a) or in the presence of CO2 (sample 1-b), about 30% of the chromium sites are reduced to CrIII, whereas the fraction of CrIII increases to about 70% when the reaction is performed in the presence of O2 or O2 + CO2 (samples 1-c and 1-d).

The fits were performed on the normalized XANES spectra, in the ΔE = −20–15 eV region, without constraints

Additional structural information has been obtained by analyzing the Fourier transforms of the k3-weighted χ(k) functions collected with the XANES spectra discussed above (Fig. 4). The spectra of catalysts 1-a, 1-b, and 1c are very similar to each other and are dominated by a first shell signal centered around 1.5 Å (not corrected in phase), as observed for Cr2O3 although 1/3 less intense (note that the spectrum of Cr2O3 is divided by 3). In addition, a broad signal around 2.6 Å is observed, which is similar to the second shell signal characteristic of Cr2O3, but less intense and shifted to a longer distance (well evident in the Imm(FT), Fig. 4b). The spectrum of sample 1-d is more similar to that of Cr2O3. In this case, the second shell signal is almost at the same distance as for Cr2O3 and also a third shell signal is observed around 3.2 Å, which is absent in the other cases.
Fig. 4 Fourier transforms in both modulus (part a) and imaginary parts (part b) of the k3-weighted χ(k) functions (FT in the Δk = 1.0–13.0 Å−1 range) of samples 1-a, 1-b, 1-c and 1-d. Experimental data are shown as dotted curves, and the best fits (ΔR = 0.0–4.0 Å range) are reported with full lines. Also, the spectrum of Cr2O3 (multiplied by a factor of 0.65) is shown for comparison. The vertical dotted line in part b) highlights the second shell signal around 2.6 Å characteristic of Cr2O3.
On the basis of the XANES results discussed above, the EXAFS data have been analyzed considering the co-presence of a CrII-phase and a CrIII-phase, having the following properties: i) the CrII-phase contributes only to the first shell signal with two oxygen ligands (OII in Table 5), the corresponding signal being quite weak; ii) the CrIII-phase contributes to the first shell signal with six oxygen ligands (OIII in Table 5), and also to the second shell one, with a number of chromium ligands (Cr in Table 5) that depend on the dimensions of the Cr2O3-like particles. Details on the EXAFS data analysis are given in the ESI.† Briefly, the following variables were fitted: i) a single ΔE0 common to all paths; ii) the fraction x of the CrIII-phase, with (1 − x) defined as the fraction of the CrII-containing phase; iii) the second shell NCr coordination number; iv) the Cr–OII, Cr–OIII and Cr–Cr distances; v) the Debye–Waller factor for the Cr–Cr contribution, σCr2. The results of the analysis are summarized in Table 5 and the best fits are shown in Fig. 4 as full curves.

The fraction x of the CrIII-phase present in each catalyst as a function of the reaction conditions is in very good agreement with the values determined by the XANES analysis (Table 4). Hence, the co-presence of two chromium phases is fully confirmed. Their relative amount was estimated by means of two independent analyses, one mainly based on the evaluation of the chromium oxidation state and the other on the structure around the absorbing chromium sites. It is also interesting to observe that the second shell Cr–Cr contribution is characterized by an NCr coordination number much smaller than that for Cr2O3, also when the relative fraction of this phase is considered. This suggests that in the CrIII-phase the CrO6 octahedra are, on average, organized in dimers or trimers.
In conclusion, the XAS data collected on the 2.0Cr/SiO2-DHS catalyst recovered after the direct dehydrogenation of propane and after ODH in the presence of different oxidants suggest that during the catalysis two chromium phases coexist, whose relative proportion depends on the reaction environment: i) a CrII-phase, where the chromium sites are in the +2 oxidation state and are surrounded by two oxygen ligands, and ii) a CrIII-phase, where the chromium sites belong to small CrO6 octahedra partially aggregated, although not yet organized as for Cr2O3.
3.3 The catalyst observed during direct and oxidative propane dehydrogenation reactions
In order to demonstrate that experiments of Series 1- were representative of the situation under the reaction conditions, a second series of experiments was performed by collecting quick-XANES spectra on the same catalyst under the reaction conditions. First of all, the XANES spectra of samples 2-ox and 2-red are practically indistinguishable from those of samples 1-ox and 1-red (not reported). Different propane dehydrogenation reaction conditions were employed, keeping the reaction temperature (600 °C) constant and varying the reagent composition and the total reagent flow (Table 2). It was found that at 600 °C the reaction started immediately. As a consequence, in all the cases, the first XANES spectrum (collected in about 12 minutes) was already the “final” one, and no intermediate species were observed, in agreement with the previous literature.63 The XANES spectra remain constant even after several hours of reaction, suggesting that the slow deactivation observed during the catalytic tests has to be ascribed mainly to coke deposition and not to a change in the properties of the chromium sites. Under the adopted experimental conditions, the amount of coke accounted for about 2–3% by weight, as reported in our previous work.36 After regeneration of the catalyst in oxygen flow at 600 °C, the XANES spectra were the same as that for the fresh catalyst. More importantly, in very general terms, all the XANES spectra collected during the reaction do show the co-presence of a CrII-phase and a CrIII-phase, in agreement with the results of experiments of Series 1-. This finding definitely demonstrates that under the reaction conditions (i.e. in the presence of reagents at 600 °C) a mixture of CrII and CrIII species is present, which may contribute to the catalysis in a different way.
Some differences in the relative amount of the CrII-phase and the CrIII-phase were observed in the XANES spectra as a function of both the reaction mixture and the total flow, as shown in Fig. 5. As performed for experiments of Series 1-, the relative amount of CrII and CrIII-phases was evaluated by fitting the experimental XANES spectra with a linear combination of the two reference phases, Cr2O3 (reference for CrIII species) and 1-red (reference for the CrII-phase). The results are summarized in Table 6. At a constant reactant flow, the relative amount of the CrIII-phase increases in the order: C3H8 < C3H8 + CO2 < C3H8 + O2 < C3H8 + CO2 + O2. These results indicate that the relative amount of CrII and CrIII-phases present in the catalyst during the reaction depends on the balance between the reducing ability of propane and the oxidizing power of the oxidants present in the reactant mixtures. Propane has a strong reducing ability at 600 °C and in the absence of oxidants the chromium species would be in the +2 oxidation state. Nevertheless, a small amount of the CrIII-phase is also observed and explained by considering that during the direct dehydrogenation of propane a small amount of CO2 is produced, which enters in the feed composition. In the presence of the oxidants, the amount of the CrII-phase decreases in favor of the CrIII-phase, following the oxidizing ability of the oxidants.

The fits were performed on the normalized XANES spectra, in the ΔE = −20–15 eV region, without constraints

The reported data indicate that by keeping the feed composition constant, the relative amount of the CrIII-phase is greater at low flow. This might suggest that the red–ox ability of the reactants is influenced by the contact time: low flows (long contact times) favor the action of the oxidants (CO2 or O2, or both), whereas high flows (short contact times) favor the action of the reductant (C3H8). It must be noticed that this conclusion is strictly valid only if the reaction is not limited by diffusion processes from the bulk gas phase to the catalyst surface. Previous kinetics experiments in a non-stationary field demonstrated that the oxidants have a lower affinity towards the catalyst surface than the hydrocarbon.81 These findings support the conclusion that the oxidants need more time to act with respect to propane.
4. Conclusions
XANES and EXAFS spectroscopy methods have been applied to monitor the variations in the oxidation state and in the local structure of the chromium sites in a 2.0Cr/SiO2-DHS catalyst during propane dehydrogenation under non-oxidative and different oxidative conditions. All the XANES and EXAFS spectra have been analyzed by considering the co-presence of two chromium phases in all the catalysts: 1) a CrIII-phase, similar to the Cr2O3 reference, where the Cr sites are in the +3 oxidation state and surrounded by six oxygen ligands in the first coordination shell and by a limited number of chromium ligands in the second coordination shell, and 2) a CrII-phase, where the chromium sites are in the +2 oxidation state, isolated and highly uncoordinated (only two oxygen ligands in the first coordination shell). The majority of the specialized literature ascribes the propane dehydrogenation activity mainly to CrIII species, almost isolated or weakly aggregated, although other works report the presence of small amounts of CrII species. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work reporting a two-phase XAS analysis for a Cr/SiO2 catalyst employed in propane dehydrogenation reactions. The detection of CrIIIOx oligomers under the reaction conditions indicates that, at 600 °C and in the presence of the reagents, the chromium sites are partially mobile on the silica surface. Indeed, the activated catalyst before the reaction (sample 1-ox) shows exclusively monomeric chromate species. The high mobility of dispersed chromium sites at the silica surface at high temperature and under oxidizing conditions is well known to people working in the field of the Phillips catalyst activation, and has some important implications for its commercial usage. Max McDaniel76,82 has elegantly shown that chromium is mobile during the activation of the Phillips catalyst, migrating within each silica particle, and even from one particle to another. The exact mechanism behind chromium's mobility is still under debate, although water, or perhaps surface silanol groups, seem involved in the migration. Interestingly, under our experimental conditions (where mixtures of oxidants and reductants are simultaneously present, as well as water), chromium's mobility leads to the aggregation of only a fraction of the chromium sites (CrIII), while the sites with the lower oxidation state (CrII) remain isolated.
Fig. 6 summarizes the main results and compares the catalytic performances of the 2.0Cr/SiO2-DHS catalyst36 (Fig. 6a) with the relative amount of the CrII and CrIII-phases, as a function of the reaction conditions (static or flow conditions) and of the reactant mixture. We have found that the CrIII-phase prevails when oxygen is present in the reaction mixture and when the reaction is performed at low flow (Fig. 6c) or, as a case limit, under static conditions (Fig. 6b). The amount of the CrIII-phase correlates well with the propane conversion (Fig. 6a, full circles). In contrast, the selectivity to propene (Fig. 6a, empty circles) seems to correlate with the relative amount of the CrII-phase, at least when propane dehydrogenation is performed under oxidative conditions. Although other phenomena surely contribute to the overall catalytic performances of Cr/SiO2 catalysts, our results indicate that the relative proportion of the CrII and CrIII-phases plays a role in influencing the selectivity of the propane ODH reaction.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
