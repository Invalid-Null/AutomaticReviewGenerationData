Dissecting the role of Bi and Ba in the catalytic efficiency of VSbBiBa/Al2O3 catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidation of propane†
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene could be a way to produce propylene as an alternative to steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking, if efficient catalysts were discovered and developed. VSbBiBaO/Al2O3 catalysts, which have been proposed for the reaction, have the advantage of being operational at a relatively low temperature allowing their further use in combination with propene oxidation catalysts to produce acrolein. This study reports a deep characterization of the catalysts by various techniques, before or after catalytic testing, in order to determine the respective roles of the constitutive elements as well as those of the dopant and the support. The results show that the active phase corresponds to a vanadium antimonate with a rutile-type structure with antimony partially substituted by bismuth. Bismuth increases the surface content of V5+ which are the active sites for the first step of propane dehydrogenation and thus increases the intrinsic activity of the catalysts since this step is the rate limiting step. Barium added as a surface dopant was shown to decrease the catalyst's acidity which avoids total oxidation and creates basic sites both on the rutile-type phase and the support that contributes to the desorption of propene.
1. Introduction
In recent decades, important progress has been made in understanding the relationships between the structure and catalytic properties of mild alkane oxidation catalysts. While the precise nature of the active sites has been thoroughly investigated in some systems, and the in-depth knowledge has increased, it remains difficult to describe precisely the sites since these are dynamic systems in which a combination of atoms containing variable valence metallic cations and Lewis bases such as O2− or OH− interact.1 Other cations, indirectly involved in the isolation of the active sites or in the modification of the acid–base properties of the catalytic surface, can be added to the species acting in the successive reaction elementary steps.2–4 Thus, for many systems whose efficiency has been demonstrated, the origin of the catalytic properties and in particular the role of the various elements that constitute them have not been always clearly defined. This is the case for a VSbBiBa/Al2O3 catalyst which has been patented for the ammoxidation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane into propene.5–10 This catalyst is active and selective and made it possible to obtain a selectivity to propene of 11.9% with 24.5% conversion at only 380 °C.8 It corresponds to catalysts supported on, or diluted in, alumina, which are more difficult to characterize than bulk catalysts; these catalysts have not been thoroughly characterized. It should be noted that the interest in combining V, Sb and Bi in an oxide catalyst had been reported previously for the ODH of ethane and butane; in the studies the role of the elements has not been discussed.11,12 The only information which was reported was that modification of vanadium antimonates with Bi and Ba leads to an increase in the amount of reactive oxygen, in particular those bound to vanadium atoms, which are responsible for the redox properties of the system. This explanation would account for the higher rate of alkane conversion but no details were given on how this might occur.13
The elementary composition of the catalyst highlights elements whose association in bulk catalysts has been shown to be very effective for the oxidation of propane, such as V and Sb14–19 as well as Bi, which is found in a large number of molybdate based catalytic formulations20–24 but very little in antimoniate based catalysts. On the other hand, Ba is more rarely used in oxidation catalysis and when used, it is a promotor, improving basicity or oxygen mobility at the surface.25,26
In the present study, we report on a study of the VSbBiBa/Al2O3 catalyst. First, we reproduced its synthesis and verified that we found the same catalytic properties as those proposed in the literature. We then deepened the characterization of the catalyst to identify the active phase of the catalyst. This phase was then prepared in a bulk form, characterized and tested in order to understand the origin of the catalytic properties and the functions of the solid catalyst. These last studies have made it possible to determine the role of the various constituent elements, which is discussed.
2. Experimental
The VSbBiBaO/Al2O3 catalyst has been briefly described amongst other catalysts in previous publications.6–8 The following synthesis protocol was derived from the references. First, a paste was prepared in water (200 ml) with appropriate amounts of ammonium vanadate NH4VO3, antimony chloride SbCl3, bismuth nitrate Bi(NO3)3, 5H2O and nitrate of barium Ba(NO3)2 with the respective mass contents of V, Sb, Bi and Ba of 5.8, 11.9, 5.5 and 0.1%, corresponding to those of the final catalyst. The paste was then impregnated on γ-alumina (Rhône Poulenc) with a specific surface of 85 m2 g−1 (particle size 0.3–0.6 mm). The solid obtained was dried in a rotary steamer at 70 °C, then in an oven at 100 °C for 24 h and finally annealed at 600 °C for 2 h in air. The VSbO4 phase, pure and with the incorporation of bismuth with different amounts, has also been synthesized. The synthesis was carried out using the following protocol: 22 mmol of ammonium vanadate (NH4VO3) were dissolved in 150 ml of water heated to 50 °C and 22 mmol of antimony chloride (SbCl3) were dissolved in the same quantity of water and heated to 50 °C. The two solutions were mixed for 30 min at 50 °C; a color change from yellow to green was observed with the formation of a paste. This paste was introduced in a Teflon reactor and heated in a microwave at 200 °C for 1 h with stirring. After recovery by centrifugation and washing with water and ethanol, the solid was dried at 100 °C for 1 h and calcined at 450 °C for 2 h in air. A catalyst has also been prepared by introducing the support in the paste during the synthesis of the rutile type phase with 10% of substitution of Sb by Bi. The amount of the rutile phase was calculated from the total formula of the industrial catalyst (30 weight %) and the sample was named 30%-VSbBiO/Al2O3. In order to study the role of barium, this catalyst and the alumina support were impregnated after synthesis and calcination with 0.1% by weight of Ba (wet impregnation method from a barium nitrate solution) and calcined at 450 °C for 2 hours in air. These latter samples were named Ba–30%-VSbBiO/Al2O3 and Ba–Al2O3 respectively.
The synthesized samples were characterized first by X-ray diffraction with a Bruker D5005 diffractometer and Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.1540 nm). Patterns were recorded with 1 s counting time per step of 0.028° 2θ and Bragg angles ranging from 5 to 80° 2θ. TOPAS 3.0 software was used to analyze the data. Chemical analyses were conducted by atomic absorption (ICP) in argon plasma with a SPECTROLAME-ICP spectrometer. Prior to analysis the samples were solubilized using various acids in an aqueous solution to be vaporized in plasma.27 The determination of the specific surface area of the samples was carried out by physisorption of nitrogen at −196 °C on a Micrometrics ASAP 2020 instrument using the five point BET method. Prior to measurement, the samples were treated under vacuum, at 300 °C for 2 h. Room temperature FTIR spectra were recorded between 4000 and 370 cm−1 with eight scans on an Agilent CARY630 Instrument FT-IR spectrometer with a resolution of 4 cm−1. XPS measurements were carried out using a KRATOS AXIS Ultra DLD spectrometer using monochromated Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV). The detection system combined a hemispherical analyzer and a detector of the type “Detector Delay Line”. Survey spectra were recorded in the range from 1200 to 0 eV, with a pass energy of 160 eV. High-resolution spectra were recorded for Sb 3d, O 1s, V 2p, C 1s and Bi 4f photoemission peaks, with a pass energy of 40 eV. The charge neutralization was performed with a low energy electron beam. The spectra were calibrated in binding energy using the C 1s (C–C, C–H) photoemission peak at 284.6 eV. Quantitative analyses were performed as previously described, using the SPX processing software (vision 2.2.6 Kratos).28 The Sb 4d signal was additionally studied to ensure the presence of both Sb3+ and Sb5+ when necessary.
SEM analysis was performed on an ESEM-FEG FEI XL 30 microscope. Prior to analysis, the samples were coated with a film of sputtered gold in order to avoid charging effects. Images of the powders were also acquired by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on an FEI TITAN ETEM G2 microscope operating at 80–300 kV. The microscope was equipped with an objective Cs aberration corrector and an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer from Oxford Instruments TM for elemental chemical analysis. The samples were embedded in a resin and cut by using an ultramicrotome; slices with targeted thicknesses of 50 nm were deposited on a TEM grid; elemental chemical analyses were achieved using an EDX analyzer (SDD X-Max 80 mm2 from Oxford Instruments). The HAADF-STEM images were acquired on a HAADF detector with a camera length such that the inner and outer cut-off half-angles of the detector were, respectively, equal to 55 and 200 mrad. The probe size was slightly better than 0.2 nm (uncorrected STEM) and the convergence angle was 10 mrad.29
CO2 desorption analyses were carried out with a BELCAT-M instrument (BEL company) equipped with a TCD. The catalysts were first heated under a 50 ml min−1 flow of helium from room temperature to 500 °C (10 °C min−1) and kept at this temperature for 10 min. A mixture of 1% vol of CO2 in helium was then passed through the solid at 200 °C with a flow of 50 ml min−1 for 1 hour, followed by pure helium at 50 ml min−1 for 30 min at the same temperature. The desorption of CO2 was recorded under the latter flow from 200 to 500 °C, at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. The resulting data were imported in OriginPro 2016 for further treatment. The Peak Analyzer module was used to correct the baseline and integrate each peak. A 150 point first-order Savitzky–Golay derivative was used to remove the noise from the graphs and the data were finally normalized by mass.
For the electrical conductivity measurements, the oxide powders were compressed at ca. 2.76 × 107 Pa (4000 psi) using a Carver 4350.L pellet press to ensure good electrical contacts between the catalyst grains. The obtained pellet was placed between two circular platinum electrodes in a horizontal quartz tube surrounded by an electrical furnace. The temperature was controlled using Pt–Rh thermocouples soldered to the electrodes. The flow rates of gases flowing over the pelletized sample were controlled by fine needle valves and were measured by capillary flow meters. The platinum electrodes connected to a FLUKE 177 multimeter (set to ohmmeter) were used for the measurement of the electrical resistance of the pellet, which was converted into conductivity (σ) by using the following equation:
(1)
where ρ is the electrical resistivity of the material, R is the measured electrical resistance, h is the thickness of the sample (in the range from 0.1 to 0.2 cm) and S is the cross-section area of the platinum electrodes (diameter 1.3 cm), which corresponds to the contact area between the metallic conductor and the semiconductor sample.
The electrical conductivity of a pelletized powder sample is a function of the concentration of the charge carriers according to the formula:
σ = An (2)
where n is the concentration of the main charge carriers, and A is a constant that includes the charge of the electron, the mobility of the charge carriers and the number and quality of the contacts between the grains. Since the samples have similar surface areas and were compressed at the same pressure, and since the electrical conductivity measurements were standardized, A can be considered similar for all the samples under identical conditions. In all the experiments, in order to remove any adsorbed impurities, the samples were first heated in air to the maximum temperature of 440 °C (lower than the calcination temperature), cooled down to ca. 100 °C and then heated again to the desired temperature with a rate of 5 °C min−1. Under these conditions, the concentration of adsorbed ionic species such as HO− or H3O+ that are able to induce additional surface conductivity is negligible. The common reference state for σ variation both under different oxygen partial pressures and under different gaseous atmospheres has been chosen under air at atmospheric pressure at 350 °C.
The powdered samples have been tested in the mild oxidation of propane. The catalytic reaction was performed in a fixed bed reactor operating at atmospheric pressure and under isothermal conditions using a glass plug-flow reactor.30 The oxidation was performed between 360 and 400 °C with the catalyst amount varying from 200 to 3000 mg and a total flow of 20 or 25 ml min−1. Two reaction conditions were used. The first, which was that of the literature, corresponded to the feedstock composition: C3H8/O2/10% Ne–He 10/8.7/8 with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) equal to 2500 ml g−1 h−1. It made it possible to faithfully compare the results of the catalyst prepared in this study with those of the catalyst in the literature. The second, which corresponded to the feedstock composition: C3H8/O2/10% Ne–He 1/1/8 with a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) equal to 2500 ml g−1 h−1, led to lower propane and oxygen conversions in order to avoid any risk of limitation. This second condition was used for the comparisons of mass and supported catalysts and for intrinsic rate calculation. Propene (N25) was purchased from Air Liquide and used without further purification. The reaction products (acrolein, acrylic acid, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, CO, CO2) and unconverted propene were analyzed online using a gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD and either Porapak-Q and CP Molsieve 5A columns or a Carboxen 1010 column. A test of the empty reactor at 450 °C showed that the conversion of propene remained below 1.5% and that the main products of the reaction were CO2 and CO. The carbon balance was for all tests higher or equal to 97%. Conversion, selectivity and intrinsic rates were calculated using the usual equations recalled in the ESI† section. The catalysts were heated to the catalytic temperature under the catalytic gas mixture and the first analyses were performed 1 h after reaching this temperature. The catalysts were tested for 24 h and no specific activation or deactivation was recorded during that time.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Study of the VSbBiBaO/Al2O3 catalyst
The synthesized catalyst was tested under the same conditions as those in the literature.6,8 A mass of 0.6 g of catalyst was introduced into a fixed-bed reactor with a total gas flow of 25 ml min−1. The composition in molar percentage of the gaseous mixture C3H8/O2/10% Ne–He was fixed at 10/8.7/81.3. The temperature range studied was between 380 and 420 °C. The results are reported and compared with those of the literature in Table 1. The results show that the catalytic properties of the synthesized catalyst are very close to those published and it can be considered that the catalyst from the literature has been relatively well reproduced.8

Notes: reaction conditions: C3H8/O2/10%Ne–He 10/8.7/8, total flow = 25 ml min−1, GHSV= 2500 ml g−1 h−1, temperature = 380°C.
The testing of the synthesized catalyst under different conditions showed that carbon oxides were the main products besides propene with a limited selectivity to oxygenates, the main compounds of which were acrolein and acrylic acid (Table S1†). In all cases, the catalytic properties remained the same after 24 h of testing.
The synthesized solid was characterized by X-ray diffraction to identify the phases formed and by transmission electron microscopy to characterize the distribution of the different elements and the interaction with the alumina support. The diffractogram obtained is presented in Fig. 1. Next to alumina (JCPS 00-023-1009), the rutile-like phase V0.95Sb0.95O4 (JCPDS 01-081-1218) has been identified. Note that no bismuth-based phase was detected, however the peaks corresponding to the V0.95Sb0.95O4 phase are all very slightly shifted to low angles. This displacement has already been observed and attributed to a distortion of the structure due to an interaction with alumina.31

The morphology and size of vanadium antimonates were examined with a transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Fig. 2). The images show nanosized particles more or less agglomerated, dispersed on the alumina support (Fig. 2a). The particles have an irregular spherical morphology similar to that shown in Fig. 2b. Their size distribution determined on 60 particles is shown in Fig. 2c. An average nanoparticle size of 12 nm was calculated. EDX analyses of the catalyst carried out show that the spherical particles dispersed on alumina correspond to the rutile-type phase. They contain three elements V, Sb and Bi in relatively constant ratios corresponding to the stoichiometry VSb0.9Bi0.1O4, close to that used for the preparation. Aluminum is almost always observed and the presence of the latter in the composition of the rutile phase cannot be totally excluded. Nevertheless, when a particle large enough is analyzed to avoid the joined analysis of the support, it shows a composition without Al and always with the composition cited (Fig. 2). Barium could barely be detected due to its low content and appeared homogeneously dispersed. A relatively narrow distribution of diameters ranging from approximately 6 to 20 mm with an average size of 12 ± 2 nm was observed. This average grain size measured from the TEM image has been compared to the average crystallite size calculated from XRD using the Debye–Scherrer equation:

where k is a constant (0.94 for spherical particles), λ is the wavelength of the X-ray radiation (Cu-Kα = 0.1541 nm), β is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the intense and broad peaks and θ is the Bragg angle. The results indicate good agreement between the average crystal (XRD) and grain size (TEM) (Table 2). The result was then used to calculate an average specific surface area SSSA of 80 m2 g−1 or the nanoparticles using the following equation:32

where ρ is the specific density of the rutile-type bismuth vanadium antimonate phase. Comparison of the X-ray diffractograms of the catalyst before and after the test showed no phase change under reaction conditions, which agree well with the stability of the catalytic properties observed over the same period of time (Fig. S1†). Similarly, no change in particle size distribution was encountered.

The results obtained show that the VSbBiBaO/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was well reproduced. The study could then be focused on that of the active phase identified as being an antimonate of vanadium and bismuth. For this, the phase was prepared in a bulk form, tested and characterized. In order to identify the specific role of bismuth, compositions with various bismuth contents have been studied.
3.2. Study of bulk rutile-type phase VSb1−xBixO4
Five vanadium antimonates with various rates of antimony substitution by bismuth have been synthesized and studied: VSb1−xBixO4 with x = 0, 0.05, 0.08, 0.10 and 0.20. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples revealed only one phase, corresponding to a rutile-type phase V0.95Sb0.95O4 (JCPDS 01-081-1218); when x > 0.10, a new phase with a structure isomorphic to that of Gd2FeSbO7 (JCPDS 01-077-2215) was observed (Fig. 3).
Fig. 3 Comparison of the X-ray diffraction patterns of the solids VSb1−xBixO4 with x between 0 and 0.2; peaks corresponding to the new pyrochlore phase are marked with red asterisks.
The formation of this new phase showed that the VSb1−xBixO4 solid solution was limited. The X-ray diffraction patterns have been fitted and the cell parameters of the rutile-type phase were calculated (Fig. S2†). Their specific surface area was also measured (Table S2†). The substitution of antimony by bismuth led to a decrease in the lattice parameter although the latter had a greater ionic radius than antimony. The specific surface areas of the samples were relatively high compared to the rutile-type phase prepared using the more conventional technique which are around 10–20 m2 g−1.18,33,34 These surface areas decreased when the bismuth content in the solid solution increased (Table S2†). The limit of the solid solution should be for a composition with x between 0.08 and 0.2. Beyond the limit, the joint formation of a phase was observed. The structure of the new phase was isomorphic to Gd2FeSbO7.35
The formation of the new phase was accompanied by a significant decrease in the total specific surface area of the sample. In order to complete these results, and to better determine the nature of the phase formed with a high bismuth content, a high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (STM-HAADF) analysis of the solid VSb0.8Bi0.2O4 was carried out with elementary mapping by EDX. The cartography clearly showed two phases with two different compositions, one of which was richer in bismuth (Fig. 4). Electron diffraction by transmission showed the presence of the rutile-type phase and the phase with the structure isomorphic to Gd2FeSbO7 (Fig. 4). This structure was similar to a structure of the pyrochlore A2B2O7 type where A is a cation of degree of oxidation +3 and B was a cation generally of degree of oxidation +4. This structure has the particularity of being flexible, so sites A and B can accommodate different cations; it is therefore easy to transfer several compounds as described in the literature, such as Gd2FeSbO7,35,36 Bi2Ru2O7,37 but also variable stoichiometric types such as Mn2Sb2O7−x,38 Bi1.5Sb1.5Zn1−xCuxO7 (ref. 39) Bi1.5Sb1.5−xNbxCuO7 (ref. 40) or Bi1.56Sb1.48Co0.96O7.41 An average of five EDX analyses was carried out for the two phases constituting the VSb0.8Bi0.2O4 solid. The results gave for the rutile phase an approximative overall formula of VSb0.9Bi0.1O4 and for the pyrochlore phase Bi1.0V1.5Sb1.5O7.

Concerning the rutile-type phase composition, it has been shown that bismuth substitutes antimony. Unlike antimony, bismuth cannot be stabilized by vanadium in oxidation state 5+ and it was present as Bi3+. The substitution therefore modified the charge distribution or the lacunar structure of the rutile phase. There are two ways to balance the solid. In the first case, the decrease in positive charges linked to the substitution is only counterbalanced by the oxidation of the vanadium, which leads to a formula of the type V4+0.74V3+0.18Sb5+0.82Bi3+0.10□0.16O4 with □ corresponding to cationic vacancies. In the second case, the vanadium is reduced and the anionic vacancies disappear; in this case the stoichiometry corresponds to a solid where the vanadium is more reduced and without vacancies, with a formula of the type V4+0.2V3+0.80Sb5+0.9Bi3+0.10O4. However, it is possible for load balancing to involve both processes simultaneously. In order to better understand the charge balance in the mass of the solid, the phases synthesized with different rates of substitution of antimony by bismuth were characterized by infrared spectroscopy. It can be recalled that the presence of cation vacancies can be evidenced by the observation of bands around 1015 and 880 cm−1 in the DRIFT spectra with a linear relation of the band at 1015 cm−1 with the number of cation vacancies.18,42 The recorded spectra are presented in Fig. 5. It can be seen that when the substitution rate increases, the intensity of the band at 1000 cm−1 decreases. It can therefore be postulated that the compensation process takes place mainly by the progressive disappearance of the cation vacancies. This disappearance can explain the decrease of the cell parameters which is observed while the size of the substituting cations (Bi3+: 0.117 nm) is much higher than that of the substituted cations (Sb3+: 0.090 nm, Sb5+: 0.074 nm).43

The catalytic performances of the bulk rutile-type phase VSb0.9Bi0.1O4 have been determined (Table 3). The comparison has been performed at 350 °C to keep the conversion lower than 20% and possibly compare intrinsic rates of propane conversion. It should also be noted that at 400 °C, oxygen was almost totally converted over several catalysts and the catalytic properties were no longer stable over time. Comparable activity in terms of propane conversion was observed for all the catalysts. Similarly, the selectivity pattern remained the same whatever the relative bismuth content.

The catalytic properties of the supported catalysts have been compared to that of the rutile-type phase with the same relative composition (Table 4). It can be observed that the same conversion was obtained with a very different selectivity pattern with the total absence of propene for the bulk phase in favor of the selectivity to both carbon oxides and oxygenates. It was possible to calculate an intrinsic rate of propane conversion for the supported rutile-type phase using the specific surface area calculated from the determined particle size and compare it to that of the bulk phase. The two rates appeared rather similar, which show that the active phase is well the vanadium antimonate (Table 4).

3.3. Surface composition and electrical conductivity of the rutile-type phase
In order to understand the effect of the substitution of antimony by bismuth on the catalytic properties, the rutile phases have been characterized to determine their surface composition and their electrical conductivity has been measured to characterize the effect of bismuth on the mobility of e− and oxygen species. XPS has been used to study the surface chemical composition and chemical oxidation states of elements at the surface of the rutile-type phase. The measurements were done after catalytic testing in order to find possible correlation with catalytic properties and because previous studies showed that differences in composition could be observed when compared to before testing in this type of antimonate phase.28,44 The surface cationic ratios calculated from the spectroscopic data are gathered in Table 5; the binding energies corresponding to the fitted peaks are listed in Table S3.†

V, Sb, O and C were detected in the XPS survey scans along with Bi for the compounds containing bismuth. The Bi species are Bi3+ cations at the surface of the samples whereas Sb species are both Sb5+ and Sb3+ except at high Bi content, where only Sb5+ was identified.45–47 The spectral decomposition of the V2p3/2 region shown for illustration in the case of VSb1−xBixO4 in Fig. 6 reveals three contributions attributed to the different oxidation states of vanadium, i.e. V3+ (514.3 eV), V4+ (515–516 eV) and V5+ (516–517 eV). The closeness of the latter oxidation states over energies and the increase in width of the corresponding spectra required a very careful analysis and did not allow a quantitative analysis with a good precision to be obtained.47

Quantitative analysis of the spectra revealed an excess of antimony similar for all the solids (Table 5). The joint presence of Sb3+ suggests that this excess is related to nanoparticles of Sb2O4 or Sb6O13 antimony oxides either amorphous or in amount undetectable by XRD. Such a feature has already been reported by several authors for other rutile-type phases.40,46 The substitution by bismuth does not affect the formation of these phases except at high content, where the precipitation of a new antimonate phase is observed. With the substitution of Sb by Bi in the VSb1−xBixO4 solid solution, a decrease of V3+ and V4+ content and an increase of V5+ occur. This evolution is scarcely detected when the bismuth content is the lowest (x = 0.05). When the limit of the solid solution is exceeded, all vanadium V3+ has disappeared. Since the element responsible for the catalytic activity in this type of solid is vanadium, it is understandable why the addition of bismuth has an effect on the catalytic activity.
If the knowledge of the surface composition is essential, it is not enough to attempt to describe a catalyst's operating mechanism; bulk properties such as electrical conductivity may be considered, even if they do not lead directly to a catalytic site description and cannot systematically account for surface properties. The electrical conductivity of VSbO4 and VBixSb1−xO4 samples with x = 0.00, 0.05, 0.08 and 0.1 has been measured as a function of temperature (from 100 to 440 °C) under air at atmospheric pressure. Electrical conductivity measurements, when conducted on powders, characterize the surface conductivity of the grains rather than the bulk; they also provide information on the existence of oxidizing species (ionosorbed oxygen species, active surface anions…) and the nature of the oxidic phase involved in catalytic reactions. These measurements appear very efficient when focusing on the activation of alkanes since they characterize the structure defects and help identify the active oxygen species.
The variations of log σ versus reciprocal temperature (Arrhenius plots) observed for the studied compounds are presented in Fig. 7. Linear variations can be observed in all cases showing that all the materials behave as semiconductors, in line with the exponential variation of their electrical conductivity as a function of temperature governed by the Arrhenius law:

where σ0 is the pre-exponential factor and Ec is the activation energy of conduction. It can also be observed in Fig. 7 that, compared to VSbO4, the electrical conductivity of the VBixSb1−xO4 sample with x = 0.05 is slightly lower, and higher at higher values of x. It passes through a maximum for x = 0.08 and decreases for x = 0.1 within all temperature range studied. Thus, the electrical conductivity follows the order: VBi0.05Sb0.95O4 < VSbO4 < VBi0.1Sb0.9O4 < VBi0.08Sb0.92O4.

As the pre-exponential factor σ0 in eqn (5) is a material constant and depends on the concentration of the charge carriers, it was estimated for all four solids from the intercept of the corresponding straight lines in Fig. 7, with the values obtained being presented in Table 6. It can be observed that the variation of the σ0 value follows that of the electrical conductivity. This suggests that the observed variation of the electrical conductivity as a function of the Bi is due to the change of the concentration rather than of the mobility of the charge carriers.

The values of activation energy of conduction, calculated from the slopes of the semi-log plots in Fig. 7, are also presented in Table 7. They are quite similar to each other, although Ec slightly decreases with increasing Bi content. This suggests that no change of the conduction mechanism takes place in the solid when Bi was added to VSbO4. Obviously, Ec corresponds to the charge carrier generation rather than to the activation of the electrical mobility within the temperature range studied. Furthermore, it can be noted that its value is comparable with previously reported values for VSbO4, FeSbO4 and V0.9Fe0.1SbO4.48

The variations of the overall conductivity of the studied compounds as a function of the oxygen partial pressure at constant temperature have been measured. For semiconducting oxides like vanadium antimonates, they allow the determination of the prevalent conduction mechanism.49,50 The variations of σ as a function of the oxygen pressure at constant temperature of 350 °C for all VBixSb1−xO4 samples with 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.1 are depicted in a log–log plot in Fig. S3.†
Although small, negative slopes, i.e., ∂σ/∂PO2 < 0, were observed in all cases suggesting an n-type behavior for all the mixed oxides studied, in line with previously reported results.48 They are different from −1/4 and −1/6, which corresponds to the existence of singly and doubly ionized oxygen vacancies, respectively, and which are correlated with simple n-type conduction models. This suggests a more complex model for the total conductivity of the VBixSb1−xO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.1) mixed oxides that can be written:
σ = σ1 + σ2 (6)
where σ1 is an electronic conduction component related to the oxygen vacancies and depending on the oxygen pressure, i.e., σ1 ∝ PO2−1/n with n = 4 or 6, while σ2 is a conduction component independent of the partial pressure of oxygen, PO2. The latter can be an electronic conductivity related to a source of electrons independent of the partial pressure of oxygen, such as substitutional defects of higher valence cations (impurities) sitting on the host cation lattice sites associated with donor levels, as shown for P-modified ceria.51 The conduction component σ2 could also be an ionic conductivity related to the diffusion of the lattice oxygen anion into the solid. However, taking into consideration the low activation energies of conduction of the samples and the fact that the measurements were performed at 350 °C, where the ion mobility is rather low, the hypothesis of ionic conduction might be ruled out.48
With the experiments being carried out at 350 °C, it is reasonable to consider that the electronic conductivity σ1 of the VBixSb1−xO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.1) mixed oxides is related to singly ionized rather than doubly ionized anionic vacancies and, hence, σ1 ∝ PO2−1/4. This has already been observed for similar oxides at even higher temperature.48
When the total conductivity, σ, of the VBixSb1−xO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.1) samples was plotted as a function of PO2−1/4 (Fig. S4†), linear relationships were obtained in all cases, with good R2 coefficients, confirming the conduction model proposed. The conductivity σ2 at 350 °C was calculated for each sample from the y-intercept of the corresponding plot in Fig. S4,† and the values obtained are shown in Table S4.†
The σ1 values corresponding to the different partial pressures of oxygen were calculated by subtracting σ2 from σ according to eqn (6) and represented as a function of the oxygen pressure in a log–log plot (Fig. S5†).
The obtained linear plots have good R2 coefficients and exhibit all the expected −1/4 slope, which confirms that singly ionized oxygen vacancies were the dominant point defects in all the samples. It is worth noting that, for all the mixed oxides, the σ2 values are about one order of magnitude higher than the σ1 values (Table S4†). The redox behavior of the VBixSb1−xO4 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.1) mixed oxides has finally been studied under conditions close to those of catalysis, by measuring the electrical conductivity at 350 °C, and under different successive gaseous atmospheres, i.e., air, propane–air mixture (simulating the reaction mixture with propane-to-oxygen mole ratio of 1), air again, propane–nitrogen mixture and finally air. The variations obtained are shown in Fig. 8.
Fig. 8 Variation of the electrical conductivity during sequential exposure to air, propane–air mixture (the reaction mixture) and propane–nitrogen mixture for the VBixSb1−xO4 mixed oxides at 350 °C (σ in ohm−1 cm−1). On the figure, (Δlog σ)red under the propane–air mixture compared to the first air sequence for VBi0.05Sb0.95O4 and (Δlog σ)reox under the second air sequence compared to the propane–air mixture for VBi0.08Sb0.92O4 are shown.
Under a propane–air mixture (which simulates the reaction mixture), the electrical conductivity of the samples increased compared to that under the first air sequence. This corresponds to the reduction of the mixed oxides in the presence of the reaction mixture, a reducing gaseous atmosphere, and, according to the n-type criterion ∂σ/∂Preducing gas > 0, confirms their n-type behavior. The corresponding reduction equation can be written using the Kröger–Vink notation,52 as follows:
(7)
where OO represents a lattice oxygen anion, is a singly ionized oxygen vacancy, and e′ is a newly formed conduction electron accounting for the observed increase of the electrical conductivity. It is noteworthy that the amplitude of the effect, (Δlog σ)red, which is a measure of the extent of reduction of the VBixSb1−xO4 oxide under the reaction mixture,53 depends on the Bi content (Table 6). It is higher for the Bi containing samples compared to the free one, and decreases with increasing Bi content, i.e., the value of x from 0.05 to 0.1. Notably, although the electrical conductivity of the VBixSb1−xO4 sample with x = 0.05 under the first air sequence is lower than that of the VSbO4 sample, due to the significantly higher reduction degree of the former, its electrical conductivity under the reaction mixture becomes higher compared to Bi-free VSbO4. When a second air sequence was introduced over the samples, the electrical conductivity decreased in all cases (Fig. 8), although significantly less and slower for the Bi-free VSbO4 sample suggesting that it is hardly re-oxidized. Since the criterion ∂σ/∂PO2 < 0 is fulfilled, it can be stated that the samples remained of n-type after reduction under the reaction mixture. Notably, for all the samples the new steady state under air corresponds to a σ value quite different from the initial value under the first air sequence, suggesting that the re-oxidation of the reduced solids was only partially reversible. If the amplitude of the re-oxidation effect, (Δlog σ)reox, is defined as the difference, in terms of log σ, between the electrical conductivity under the propane–air mixture and that under the second air sequence, the degree of re-oxidation of the solids can be calculated, and the results obtained are tabulated in Table 6. Similar to the extent of reduction, the degree of re-oxidation is higher for the Bi containing samples compared to the Bi-free VSbO4, and decreases with increasing Bi content from x = 0.05 to x = 0.1 in the VBixSb1−xO4 series.
The introduction of a propane–nitrogen mixture (mol ratio = 1/5) over the samples after the second air sequence results in a new increase of the electrical conductivity up to a level slightly higher than that reached under the propane–air mixture (Fig. 8). Under the final air sequence, the electrical conductivity decreases for all the samples and tends to plateau corresponding to σ values slightly different from those observed under the second air sequence, suggesting that the re-oxidation of the solids reduced under the propane–nitrogen mixture is almost completely reversible. The in situ electrical conductivity measurements during sequential periods under reducing and oxidizing atmospheres clearly demonstrate that all the VBixSb1−xO4 mixed oxides are in a reduced state under the reaction atmosphere and that they are only partially re-oxidized under air, with the extent of reduction and the degree of re-oxidation depending on the Bi content. These observations demonstrate that they work according to a Mars-van Krevelen-type redox mechanism.
3.4. Effect of the Al2O3 support and Ba dopant on catalytic properties
The study of the rutile-type phases has made it possible to evidence the effect of bismuth on the chemical and catalytic properties of the catalysts by bypassing that of the support and of the barium dopant which must, nevertheless, be addressed. To study the role of the support, two catalysts have been prepared and tested: a mechanical mixture of the support and of the rutile-type phase (VSb0.9Bi0.1O4 + Al2O3) and a catalyst synthesized by simply adding alumina to the starting slurry during the microwave assisted synthesis process of the rutile-type phase (30%-VSb0.9Bi0.1O4/Al2O3). For both catalysts the same relative proportion of the active phase close to that of the VSbBiBaO/Al2O3 catalyst was used. In order to compare the bulk catalyst and the synthesized supported catalysts, the same masses of the active phase were tested. The supported catalysts containing about 30% by weight of the active phase, and the bulk catalyst have been tested with a GHSV of 6000 ml g−1 h−1 instead of 2000 ml g−1 h−1. The results obtained at 380 °C are reported in Table 8. The activity of alumina alone was evaluated in the oxidation of propane and no conversion was observed up to 420 °C. A similar activity was observed for the three catalysts, which is explained by equivalent masses and specific surface areas for the active phases present in each catalyst. The bulk catalyst does not produce propene unlike the two supported catalysts. The presence of the alumina support seems to both limit the controlled oxidation of propene and increase the deep oxidation of propane. The mechanical mixture gave the same type of result as the supported catalyst prepared in microwave synthesis, even if small differences were observed (Table 8). These differences may be related to a better dispersion of the active phase in the catalyst synthesized in a single step.

XRD analysis confirms that the phases were the same with and without the alumina support with nevertheless, a greater relative amount of the pyrochlore phase (Fig. S6†). The catalytic activity of the three catalysts appeared rather similar. This shows that the bulk and supported active phases were similar and that there is a specific effect of the support even when the interaction of the active phase with the support is not optimal such as in the catalyst prepared from the mechanical mixture. This also shows that if vanadium species dispersed alone on the support are formed in the catalyst prepared in a single step, they are much less active than those of the rutile phase, under the testing conditions used.
In order to study the role of barium, the 30% VSbBiO/Al2O3 catalyst was impregnated after synthesis and calcination with 0.1% by weight of Ba (wet impregnation method from a barium nitrate solution) and calcined at 450 °C for 2 h in air. The sample, named Ba–30% VSbBiO/Al2O3, was tested and compared to the pure solid 30% VSbBiO/Al2O3 (Table 9). The amount of barium deposited was similar to that of the initial catalyst. The results show that the addition of Ba has almost no effect on the conversion of propane but strongly modifies the selectivity since only propene and COx were detected without any oxygenates with the barium containing catalyst. Barium has a very positive effect in suppressing propene oxidation. A similar effect has previously been observed for the NiMoO catalyst doped with Ba for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and attributed to a modification of the acid–base properties of the catalyst.26 In order to understand the chemical effect of barium, the temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 has been studied on the two catalysts tested and on the alumina support, with and without barium doping. The TPD profiles have been recorded between 200 and 650 °C (Fig. 9).

The CO2-TPD desorption profile of the support was similar to those previously published for pure γ-Al2O3 with a main desorption peak around 280 °C.54,55 The addition of barium to alumina created new basic sites which were more numerous and stronger as shown by the desorption peak around 350 °C. The pure 30% VSbBiO/Al2O3 catalyst also shows weak or medium strong basic sites with a peak around 350 °C.56 When barium was added to the catalyst, a larger and more intense peak was observed at approximately the same temperature. Barium induced the formation of new basic sites both on the support and the active phase which exhibited the same strength as the basic sites present on the pure rutile-type phase.
4. Discussion
Based on the results of characterization and catalytic testing of the prepared catalysts it is likely that the active phase for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a vanadium antimonate VSbO4 in which Sb is partially substituted by bismuth. VSbO4 is a phase well-known for its catalytic properties in the selective ammoxidation or oxidation of light alkanes.9–11 Substitutions of vanadium and antimony inside this phase by elements such as Al, Ga, Fe, Sn Ti, or W have been studied and were shown to change either its activity or selectivity.12–16 Three main effects of these simple or multiple substitutions were proposed in the literature: (i) the isolation of active vanadium sites on the surface of the catalyst, (ii) the formation or suppression of unselective strong acid sites, and (iii) the participation in the re-oxidation of the phase through redox couples other than those of vanadium.17–19 Interestingly, bismuth had never been considered as a possible substituent. It should nevertheless be noted that studies in the literature report the use of catalysts containing V, Sb and Bi in catalytic oxidative dehydrogenations of ethylbenzene or alcohol like methanol and ethanol.12,57,58 Nevertheless, the relative contents of the three elements were very different from those of the rutile-type catalysts with notably bismuth as the major element which cannot help to support conclusions.
Bulk VSbBiO catalysts (VBixSb1−xO4 series) are as active as the supported catalysts but mainly selective to carbon oxides and oxygenated compounds. The characterization of these compounds showed that the bismuth fitted into the structure by substituting antimony. This substitution is guided by the sizes of the cations which are close, more than by their degree of oxidation. Indeed, a trivalent Bi3+ cation is substituted for a pentavalent Sb5+ cation. The balancing of the charges is done by a reduction of the vanadium and a progressive disappearance of the cation vacancies. The study carried out shows that the solid solution obtained is limited and that beyond a rate of substitution of antimony by bismuth of approximately 10%, another phase is formed, which contains bismuth, vanadium and antimony and has a pyrochlore-type structure. The biphasic compound appears to be more active than the rutile phase. The selectivity to acrolein is high but it must be considered that it is evaluated at a lower conversion rate and it is known that on this type of catalyst the selectivity tends to increase when the conversion decreases. The intrinsic rate of propane conversion on the biphasic compound is also high but this may simply be due to the lower specific surface area resulting from the formation of the new phase with a low specific surface area. It can be seen that when the new phase is present, propene is formed, which is not the case for pure rutile phases. This could be due to the absence of the antimony oxide phase on the surface of the catalyst as evidenced by XPS. The positive effect of this antimony oxide on the oxidation of propene formed on the rutile phase has been described previously.59
Prior to discussing the possible catalytic sites, it is important to recall that at 350 °C the reaction takes place on the catalyst and a contribution of the gas phase by homogeneous reaction, which on this type of catalyst could be initiated at high temperature (<500 °C), can be excluded.60 It can also be noted that the high flexibility of the SbVO4 phase that can accept changes of elemental composition, cationic vacancies and oxidation state of vanadium and antimony may strongly complexify the mechanisms involved in the catalytic performance of vanadium antimonates.61 This did not interfere in showing that the presence of bismuth in the rutile phase had almost no effect on selectivity but a positive effect on intrinsic activity. The characterization of the compounds has shown that the substitution of antimony by bismuth had an effect on the bulk composition with the decrease of the cationic vacancy content and a reduction of vanadium but also on the surface composition; such an effect on the surface composition is quite different. On the surface, vanadium is present in three oxidation states +3, +4 and +5 and the quantity of V5+ increases at the expense of that of V3+ and V4+. Since the surface V5+ content increased with Bi content like the rate of propane transformation, the two parameters were tentatively correlated with each other (Fig. 10). The result showed a linear relation between both. This agrees well with earlier studies on vanadium antimonates that showed that the active species in alcohol oxidation were likely V5+ species.62 The active sites may thus be associated with V5+. Such species are not present in the bulk of the solids since the thermodynamic redox equilibria between Sb and V in the catalytic reaction temperature range lead to the reduction of vanadium.63,64 However, at the surface V5+ species are present in a non-negligible amount. It is not possible to conclude how these species are distributed at the surface. Bi3+ may help in their stabilization in the rutile surface network. It cannot be excluded that they exist as VOx supra-surface species, isolated from each other by the antimony oxide. These species may be involved in redox V3+–O–V5+ or V4+–O–V5+ redox couples participating in the catalytic reaction. The surface V5+ species may play the role of charge carriers whose number increases, which in turn explains why the electrical conductivity increases with the substitution by bismuth. No simple relation was found between surface V5+ and electrical conductivity; the formation of the new pyrochlore phase and the variation of specific surface area should also intervene.
Fig. 10 Variation of the intrinsic rate of propane conversion of the VSb1−xBixO4 catalysts as a function of the surface V5+ content.
The surface characterization also showed that the presence of bismuth has no effect on the amount of antimony oxide at the surface, which is essential in isolating the active sites, in reducing the number of acid sites or in performing the oxidation of the olefin-like adsorbed intermediate as suggested in previous studies.65–70 All studies, including this one, agree on the necessity of this excess of antimony to obtain a high selectivity to alkenes or oxygenates. It has to be noted that the presence of this excess of antimony at the surface of the rutile-type phase has been observed independently of the nominal Sb/V ratio and of the synthesis method used; the microwave assisted method is no exception to the rule.
The role of the support in VSbOx/Al2O3-type catalysts has been the subject of several studies.71–73 It has been shown that the first role of the support was to increase the dispersion of the vanadium antimonate particles which increases the productivity of the catalysts. It also appears that the stability of the catalysts is improved in supported catalysts; the present study confirms this effect. The microwave assisted technique used for the preparation of the bulk phases leads to the same particle size as that of the supported ones; the conversion appears proportional to the mass of the active phase tested. However, it allows us to show that the support has a strong effect on the selectivity. Alumina does not bring any selective sites for propane and propene selective oxidation and the effect has to be indirect. It is proposed that the preparation method with the alumina support has a strong effect on the molecular structure of the dispersed rutile type phase allowing the stabilization of a higher surface excess of antimony; this excess of antimony may not be present in the same proportion on the bulk compounds. Indeed, when bulk phase synthesis with a higher starting antimony content was attempted, it did not lead to compounds with a higher antimony excess at the surface. The fact that the effect of the support is observed with the catalyst prepared by mixing mechanically the active phase and the support excludes the hypothesis that the preparation of the supported catalyst allowed the stabilization of a rutile-type phase with a lower antimony surface content which has been shown to be critical for converting selectively the propene formed. At the same time, the fact that the same activity was observed for the catalyst prepared directly in one step or by mixing showed that if isolated VOx are formed at the surface of alumina with the former preparation, they are few in number or much less active than the active sites on the rutile-type phase.
The present study showed that barium had an effect only on the selectivity and that this effect was significant. While oxygenated compounds were formed on the catalyst without barium, almost only propene or carbon oxides were found on the same doped catalyst (Table 9). In the literature, the addition of alkali or alkaline-earth dopants to an oxidation catalyst supported on alumina has the effect of removing the strongest acid sites (either from the supported phases or from the alumina support) which are known to be non-selective.72–76 The addition of barium also increases the basicity of the catalysts and it has been reported that the effect increases with increasing basicity of the metals (from Na to Cs and Mg to Ba) irrespective of the supports or reactants.26,77–79 This is related to the fact that the Lewis acidity of a cation such as Ba2+ is weak due to its electronegativity and the conjugated oxygen anion shows strong basicity.80 In the case of propane oxidation on barium doped vanadium antimonates, the surface basicity promotes the desorption of propene which is a basic molecule preventing it from further oxidation to oxygenates on the rutile phase.77,78,80 It probably does not completely mask the stronger acid sites of alumina, and desorbed propene could in part be oxidized to carbon oxides. It is also possible that barium cations, which have electron-donating properties that may increase the nucleophilic character of close oxygen species in the catalysts, increase the efficiency of oxidation sites up to carbon oxides. It is likely why both total oxidation and simple oxidative dehydrogenation are promoted by barium.
It can be concluded from all the results, that barium may be the best dopant to introduce in these catalysts, because it reduces the number of stronger acidity and creates basic sites; it induces a high basicity and, compared to alkali metals, it is less reactive with antimony, and does not lead to the formation of side phases.81
Finally, it is interesting to note that bismuth, barium and the support act completely independent from each other and do not interfere with each other. At the same time the use of a support does not change the nature of the rutile type phase with bismuth systematically substituting antimony nor the activity of the vanadium species that could have been present directly at the surface of alumina. Bismuth modifies the oxidation state of vanadium in the rutile phase but does not modify the surface antimony oxide. Barium that spreads at the surface of the active phase and the alumina support modifies the surface acido-basicity but does not modify the activity nor the number of the vanadium sites.
5. Conclusion
The main goal of this study was to investigate the nature of the active phase of the VSbBiBa/Al2O3 catalyst and to understand the role of its various constituting elements in the chemical and catalytic properties. The characterization of the catalyst shows that it corresponds to a vanadium antimonate phase of rutile structure supported on alumina. Bismuth is integrated in this phase in substitution of antimony. By testing the prepared rutile-type phase series, it is possible to highlight the effect of bismuth on the catalytic properties. Bismuth modifies the volume composition of the rutile phase, especially that of its surface with the stabilization of V5+species which are the active sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The activity of the active phase is thus increased through the number of active sites. This effect occurs without modification of the surface antimony content which plays a major role in the catalytic reaction. Barium spread over the catalyst's surface both on the rutile-type phase and the support, allowing in both cases the removal of the strongest acid sites which are unselective and the increase of the surface basicity that helps the desorption of propene. Both the relative content of bismuth in the rutile-type phase and the choice of barium as a surface dopant are explained in this study.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
