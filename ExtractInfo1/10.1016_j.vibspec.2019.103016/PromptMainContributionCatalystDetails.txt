IR spectroscopic detection of the propene species formed via the interaction of copper-ion-exchanged MFI-type zeolite with propane at 573 K
Abstract
Copper-ion-exchanged MFI-type zeolite (CuMFI) has been reported to effectively interact with propane (C3H8) even at room temperature and this sample has the potential of being used as a CH bond activation material. In this study, we examined the interaction between CuMFI and C3H8 at various temperatures. The adsorption isotherms of C3H8 showed that CuMFI exhibits strong adsorption at 573 K. For CuMFI treated at temperatures above 573 K under a C3H8 atmosphere, a characteristic infrared (IR) absorption band was detected at 1542 cm–1, which was hardly observed for other samples such as NaMFI and HMFI. This band was assigned to the CC stretching vibration mode of propene (C3H6) species adsorbed on CuMFI. Therefore, the C3H6 species were produced by the contact of CuMFI with C3H8 at approximately 573 K; propane dehydrogenation occurred. This temperature (573 K) was lower than the reaction temperature for propane dehydrogenation, which had been reported to be temperature around 773 K or higher.
1. Introduction
Considerable effort has been expended to produce propene (C3H6) [[1], [2], [3]] because its demand as a raw material for many petrochemical products has rapidly increased. Propane (C3H8) dehydrogenation utilizing zeolites as catalysts has been one of the well-known methods to produce C3H6. Based on applicable literature [[3], [4], [5], [6]], the dehydrogenation of C3H8 occurs at approximately 773 K or higher.
Recently, copper-ion-exchanged MFI-type zeolite (CuMFI), which has been considered as the catalyst for the direct decomposition reaction of nitrogen monoxide (NO) [7,8], has been found to effectively interact with C3H8 even at room temperature [9]. Clarification has been received that the monovalent-copper (Cu+) ions in zeolite, which are formed in the sample through evacuation at high temperatures, perform a pivotal role in the interaction with C3H8 as well as in the NO decomposition [8,9]. In addition, the suggestion was made that the CuMFI sample has the potential for the CH bond activation in molecules by the interaction of Cu+ in the sample with C3H8. For CuMFI, however, the effect of the ambient temperature on the interaction with C3H8 has not yet been elucidated. Collecting further information related to the interaction of CuMFI with C3H8 from the viewpoint of developing more efficient materials for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 is important.
In the present study, we examined the interaction between CuMFI and C3H8 at various temperatures from volumetric and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic measurements.
2. Experiments
Sodium-form MFI-type zeolite (NaMFI) with a Si/Al ratio of 14.5 was purchased from Tosoh Co., Japan. The CuMFI sample was prepared according to previous reports [10,11]. NaMFI was dispersed in a mixed solution of Cu(CH3COO)2 and NH4CH3COO with stirring for 1 h at room temperature and this process was repeated thirty times. The obtained sample was centrifuged and washed with distilled water and subsequently dried at room temperature in a vacuum desiccator to obtain the CuMFI sample. The copper content of CuMFI was determined using chelatometric titration. The ion-exchange level of the sample was estimated by assuming that one divalent copper ion is exchanged for two monovalent sodium ions, thereby providing a result of 126 %. Preparation of the proton-form MFI sample (HMFI) was conducted in the following manner. NaMFI was dispersed in an aqueous solution of NH4NO3 with stirring for 1 h at 353 K and this operation was repeated ten times. The obtained sample was centrifuged and washed with distilled water and subsequently dried at room temperature in a vacuum desiccator to obtain the ammonium-form MFI sample (NH4MFI). Following this, NH4MFI was evacuated at 873 K for 6 h to obtain the HMFI sample. For HMFI, the extent of proton exchange was determined through X-ray fluorescence analysis (SEA1200VX, Hitachi High-Technologies Co.). The ion-exchange level was found to be 96 %.
The carbon monoxide (CO) gas (purity of > 99.9 %) used as an adsorbate was purchased from Sumitomo Seika Chemicals Co. C3H8 (purity of 99.5 %) and C3H6 gases (purity of 99.5 %) were obtained from Taiyo Nippon Sanso Co.
Adsorption isotherms of CO and C3H8 were measured at a certain temperature using a volumetric adsorption apparatus equipped with an MKS Baratron pressure sensor. Before performing the measurements, the zeolite samples were evacuated at 873 K for 4 h under a reduced pressure of approximately 1 mPa. From the CO adsorption experiments (evaluating the amount of Cu+ [10,11]), almost all of the copper ions contained in the sample (88 %) were found to be in the monovalent state after pretreatment.
The FT-IR spectra of the samples were recorded at room temperature on a JASCO FT/IR-4200 spectrometer with a TGS detector. Samples were pressed into a pellet of a diameter of 10 mm and were placed in a cell made of quartz with KRS-5 windows, which was capable of in situ pretreatment [12]. Sixty-four spectra were accumulated at a spectral resolution of 4 cm–1.
3. Results and discussion
The adsorption isotherms of C3H8 measured at a prescribed temperature for the 873 K-pretreated CuMFI samples are shown in Fig. 1. At 298 K, both the first and second adsorption isotherms exhibited considerable increases of the adsorbed amounts in the lower pressure region, which were of the Langmuir type, indicating a strong interaction between CuMFI and C3H8 at 298 K. The amount adsorbed in the second adsorption was less than that of the first adsorption. Such a tendency (i.e., the irreversible adsorption feature) was hardly observed in the case of NaMFI, thereby indicating reversible adsorption (Fig. 2). Compared with CuMFI, a considerably lower amount of irreversibly adsorbed species was noted in HMFI (Fig. 2).

Considering previous report [9], the results show that C3H8 molecules are irreversibly adsorbed on Cu+ in CuMFI. For both the first and second adsorption, the amount of C3H8 decreased with the increase of adsorption temperature. The monolayer capacities were estimated by applying the Langmuir equation to the isotherms for the first and second adsorption and these data have been summarized in Table 1. We also evaluated the ratios of the number of Cu+ ions contributing to both the reversible and irreversible adsorption (nrev+irrev / NCu+) and the number of Cu+ ions contributing to only the irreversible adsorption against the total number of Cu+ ions (nirrev / NCu+) in CuMFI. We found that monolayer capacities decreased with increasing adsorption temperature; however the values of the ratios evaluated, for example, nirrev / NCu+, were constant above 473 K (Table 1). Moreover, CuMFI indicated strong adsorption even at 573 K.

Fig. 3 shows the FT-IR spectra obtained in the range from 1800 cm−1 to 1500 cm−1 for CuMFI exposed to C3H8 under different temperatures. In every case, a broad band was observed at around 1640 cm−1, which was derived from the zeolite framework [13]. A characteristic band also appeared at 1542 cm−1 after exposure to C3H8 at temperatures above 573 K. Such a band was not readily observed in NaMFI and HMFI. By referring to the applicable literature [14,15], the band at 1542 cm−1 may be assigned to the CC stretching vibration mode of C3H6. Subsequently, we examined the interaction of CuMFI with C3H6.

Fig. 4 shows the FT-IR spectra for CuMFI exposed to C3H6 at room temperature and low pressures. Free gaseous propene has been shown to have a characteristic mode at around 1650 cm–1 because of the CC stretching vibration in the molecule [16]. When exposing CuMFI to C3H6, the band was observed at 1542 cm−1 (Fig. 4A). Previous reports [14,15] suggested that the CC stretching vibration mode shifts to a lower wavenumber because of the weakening of the CC bond by the interaction between Cu+ in CuMFI and C3H6. Namely, the suggestion was made that the C3H6 species were produced by the contact of CuMFI with C3H8 at approximately 573 K (Fig. 3); propane dehydrogenation occurred. The temperature of 573 K was lower than the reaction temperature for propane dehydrogenation reported so far (ca. 773 K or higher) [[3], [4], [5], [6]]. Furthermore, the intensity of the band at 1542 cm−1 did not undergo considerable change during the increase of the equilibrium pressure of C3H6 to above 6.65 Pa.

For the 873 K-treated CuMFI sample, the absorption bands were observed at approximately 3741 cm−1 and 3614 cm−1 (Fig. 4B) and these bands could be assigned to the OH stretching vibration in the free silanol groups and the Brönsted-acid sites, respectively [[17], [18], [19], [20]]. Moreover, the band at 3670 cm–1 was due to the extraframework Al−OH group [[18], [19], [20]]. When in contact with C3H6, the intensity of the band, particularly at 3614 cm–1, decreased with the increase of the equilibrium pressure; however, the intensity of the band at 1542 cm–1 was not noticeably changed by the increase of equilibrium pressure (as shown in Fig. 4A) although a new broad band appeared at around 3450 cm–1. Such changes in the band intensities at 3614 cm−1 and 3450 cm–1 were also observed during the adsorption of C3H6 onto HMFI (Figs. 5A and 5B). These results indicate that oligomerization occurred as a result of the interaction of the Brönsted-acid sites with C3H6 [21]. In addition, for CuMFI, such a band change was hardly observed when the equilibrium pressure of C3H6 was below 6.65 Pa. At pressures below 6.65 Pa, C3H6 interacted with Cu+ in CuMFI but not with the Brönsted-acid sites. From these results, we assigned the IR band at 1542 cm–1 (Fig. 3) to the C3H6 species adsorbed on Cu+ in CuMFI.

4. Conclusions
In this study, we examined the adsorption of C3H8 onto CuMFI at given temperatures. CuMFI exhibited strong adsorption for C3H8, even at 573 K. The interaction of CuMFI with C3H6 was also studied to demonstrate the characteristic IR band observed at 1542 cm–1 in the interaction of the CuMFI sample with C3H8. Consequently, we identified that the C3H6 species exhibiting the CC stretching vibrational mode at 1542 cm–1 were produced through the interaction of CuMFI with C3H8 above 573 K.
