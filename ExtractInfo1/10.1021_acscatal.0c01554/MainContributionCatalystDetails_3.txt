The given document discusses colloidal synthesis methods to prepare Pt-In and Pt-Ga bimetallic nanoparticles supported on SiO2 for use as catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation reactions, specifically ethane dehydrogenation and propane dehydrogenation. However, it does not focus on oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document is centered around non-oxidative alkane dehydrogenation processes.
