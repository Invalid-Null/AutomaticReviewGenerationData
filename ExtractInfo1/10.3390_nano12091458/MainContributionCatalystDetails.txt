 Unfortunately, based on the multiple extractions provided, the documents do not appear to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation research. Each extraction indicates the documents discuss the deposition of gallium oxide and indium oxide thin films, with no direct connection to propane dehydrogenation mentioned.

Since the documents are not related to propane dehydrogenation, I will leave the <Relevance> tag set to "No" and not populate the <IfRelated> section:
