 Based on my analysis, the document does not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation catalysis. The document discusses the fabrication of a CoTe/PCN heterojunction photocatalyst for CO2 reduction. There is no mention of propane dehydrogenation or conversion of propane to propylene.
