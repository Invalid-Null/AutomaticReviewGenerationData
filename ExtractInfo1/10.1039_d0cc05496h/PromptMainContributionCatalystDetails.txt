Oxide of lanthanoids can catalyse non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation: mechanistic concept and application potential of Eu2O3- or Gd2O3-based catalysts†
This paper demonstrates the potential of Eu2O3 and Gd2O3 as catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propene. They reveal a higher activity than the state-of-the-art bare ZrO2-based catalysts due to the higher intrinsic activity of Gdcus or Eucus in comparison with that of Zrcus (cus = coordinatively unsaturated).
Propene is an important starting material for the large-scale production of polymers, solvents and other chemicals.1 It is mainly produced through steam or fluid catalytic cracking of various oil fractions. These technologies cannot, however, fulfil the steadily increasing demand for this olefin.2 Thus, both academia and industry try to develop alternative routes on the basis of cheap, environmentally friendly and longer available raw material(s). Under these considerations, the catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene (PDH) should be especially mentioned. The feed alkane is present in shale/natural gas, which is an important substitute for crude oil.3 Pt–Sn/Al2O3 or CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts are currently used in industry but suffer from the high cost of Pt or environmental issues caused by the toxicity of Cr(vi) or the necessity to use Cl2 or Cl-containing compounds for re-dispersion of sintered Pt species in spent catalysts.4 Thus, low-cost and environmentally friendly catalysts are required. Both bulk and supported materials based on transition metals or their oxides as well as the oxides of metals from groups III and IV have been tested for their activity and selectivity in the PDH reaction. Among them, the most promising supported catalysts contain ZnOx,5,6 MoOx,7 VOx,8,9 FeiiOx,10 CoiiOx,11 or GaOx/metallic Ga12,13 as active species. Their performance is affected by the structure of the supported species and by the kind of supporting material.
Herein, a new family of bulk catalysts based on Eu2O3 or Gd2O3 is presented. To the best of our knowledge, these oxides have not been used for the PDH reaction before. Recently, CeO2 doped with Pr was used but showed only 75% propene selectivity at about 5% propane conversion.14 Bare CeO2 was applied as support for Pt–Sn.15 In general, lanthanides are widely used in various heterogeneous reactions16–18 or electronic industry.19–22
Our intention to check the potential of Gd2O3 and Eu2O3 was motivated by our recently developed concept for design of catalysts, where surface defects of non-reducible metal oxides act as active sites. For example, such defects are coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) in bulk ZrO2-based materials.23,24 From a fundamental viewpoint, the focus of the present study was put to answer the following questions. Can Gdcus or Eucus also catalyse C–H bond activation in C3H8? What about their intrinsic activity in comparison with the Zrcus sites?
To perform a systematic study, a series of Eu2O3- or Gd2O3-based materials were prepared with and without supported Rh nanoparticles of about 1 nm in diameter. According to our previous study with Rh-containing ZrO2-based catalysts,25,26 the supported metal can promote the removal of lattice oxygen from Gd2O3 and Eu2O3 upon their reductive treatment. We considered a sol–gel auto-ignition method to prepare the bare oxides,27 as it is efficient for the synthesis of defect-rich metal oxides (Fig. 1a and Supporting Movie, ESI†).28 The as-prepared Eu2O3 and Gd2O3 are stabilized in the cubic phase when they were additionally calcined at 550 °C for 3 h (Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI†). For comparison, the corresponding oxides were synthesized by calcination of Gd or Eu nitrates at 550 °C for 3 h (the as-prepared oxides are from here on indicated by the suffix “_C”). The resulting oxides are also stabilized in the cubic phase (Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI†). Despite Eu2O3 and Gd2O3 being composed of larger crystallites compared to Eu2O3_C and Gd2O3_C, they possess a significantly larger surface area (55 vs. 23 m2 g−1 for europium oxide and 44 vs. 10 m2 g−1 for gadolinium oxide). This is related to the pore structure and/or morphology of these metal oxides (Table S1, ESI†). According to HAADF-STEM analysis, Eu2O3_C and Gd2O3_C have bulky and porous, sponge-like structures with pore diameters of about 2–8 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†), whereas Eu2O3 and Gd2O3 are more like an agglomeration of many plates with a lower pore number and a smaller average pore size of about 2 nm (Fig. 1b). The structure of the whole particle seems to be decisive for the surface area. Eu2O3 and Gd2O3 possess a larger average pore diameter of 26 and 27 nm with a pore volume of 0.44 and 0.34 cm3 g−1, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). Eu2O3_C and Gd2O3_C have pores with an average diameter of 4–5 nm, respectively, and thus a lower pore volume (0.04 and 0.02 cm3 g−1).
Fig. 1 (a) Illustration of a sol–gel auto-ignition method, (b) HAADF-STEM images of Gd2O3 and Eu2O3 prepared according to this method and (c) the rate of propene formation over Eu2O3 (●), Gd2O3 ( ), LaZrOx ( ) and YZrOx ( ) versus temperature of reductive catalyst treatment with H2 (Tred). Reaction conditions: 550 °C, X(C3H8) < 0.1, C3H8 : N2 = 2 : 3 feed. The ZrO2-based catalysts are from ref. 29.
Catalytic tests were carried out at 550 °C using an industrially relevant C3H8 : N2 = 2 : 3 feed. The rate of propene formation was determined at a propane conversion below 10% to ensure a differential reactor operation. Regardless of the method of catalyst preparation, the rate measured at 550 °C could be increased by a factor of about 7 when the catalysts were treated in H2 (H2 : N2 = 1 : 1) above 550 °C (Fig. 1c and Fig. S3, ESI†). The activity of all the present catalysts passes a maximum with the increasing temperature of catalyst treatment with H2. Probably, the low surface areas of Eu2O3_C and Gd2O3_C are one of the reasons for their low activity (Fig. S3, ESI†). These samples were not examined further.
Gd2O3 reveals a higher rate of propene formation than Eu2O3. To benchmark our catalysts, we compared them with the state-of-the-art bulk bare LaZrOx and YZrOx catalysts reported in our previous studies29 in terms of the rate of propene formation. As seen in Fig. 1c, Eu2O3 and Gd2O3 show a higher activity. Moreover, the difference in the activity between the Gd2O3/Eu2O3 and the ZrO2-based catalysts becomes even larger when comparing the rate related to the catalyst surface area (Fig. S4, ESI†). We also determined the space time yield of propene (STY (C3H6)) formation over Gd2O3 and Eu2O3 at 550 °C and about 23% propane conversion and propene selectivity of 67 and 80%, respectively. The corresponding STY values were 0.46 and 0.56 kg(C3H6) kg(catalyst)−1 h−1. These values are comparable with those obtained over catalysts on the basis of the oxides of Ga, Cr, V, Zr or Zn (Table S2, ESI†). Thus, the developed catalysts appear to be promising for PDH.
The results in Fig. 1c suggest that catalytically active sites are formed upon reductive treatment of europium and gadolinium oxides. By analogy with our previously developed ZrO2-based catalysts,29,30 we put forward that coordinatively unsaturated Eucus and Gdcus cations are responsible for propene formation from propane over these oxides. Such sites are formed through the removal of lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment. To indirectly prove their presence, we have selected Gd2O3 for O2 pulse tests aimed at titrating the number of anion vacancies (indicators for the presence of cus sites) formed after the catalyst treatment with H2 at 550 or 600 °C. The amount of oxygen consumed by Gd2O3 is higher after 600 °C treatment (Fig. S5, ESI†). Thus, the concentration of anion vacancies and accordingly coordinatively unsaturated cations increases with the temperature of reductive treatment that agrees with the effect of the temperature of treatment with H2 on the rate of propene formation (Fig. 1c). For a rough comparison of the intrinsic activity of the Gdcus and Zrcus sites in the PDH reaction, we used the rate of propene formation determined over Gd2O3 and YZrOx (the most active previously tested ZrO2-based catalyst without a noble metal) reductively treated at 600 °C and the concentration of anion vacancies determined from the O2 pulse titration experiments also performed after catalyst treatment with H2 at 600 °C. Although the rates of propene formation over Gd2O3 and YZrOx are close to each other (0.68 and 0.56 mmol g−1 min−1, respectively), these materials strongly differ in the concentration of anion vacancies (2 × 1016vs. 19 × 1016 per gram). Assuming that this concentration represents the concentration of the catalytically active coordinatively unsaturated metal cations, Gdcus should reveal a higher intrinsic activity than Zrcus.
To further support our idea about the decisive role of the Gdcus and Eucus sites in the PDH reaction, we prepared a series of Eu2O3 and Gd2O3 catalysts with supported nanoparticles of Rh of about 1 nm in diameter. The usage of supported metals able to activate hydrogen is another option to purposefully increase the concentration of the anion vacancies upon catalyst reductive treatment.11,31,32 To prepare the supported catalysts, Eu2O3 and Gd2O3 were used directly after sol–gel auto-ignition without additional calcination at 550 °C. The concentration of the metal was varied between 0.001 and 0.03 wt%. It is worth mentioning that the Rh content determined by ICP analysis was very close to the theoretical values (Table S3, ESI†). The effect of the temperature of catalyst treatment with H2 on the rate of propene formation over Rh/Gd2O3 and Rh/Eu2O3 is shown in Fig. 2. In comparison with the bare oxides, the supported catalysts treated only at 550 °C showed an activity level comparable with the highest activity achieved over the bare oxides, which required, however, a treatment temperature of 600 °C. Importantly that the number of oxygen vacancies determined from the O2 pulse tests with Gd2O3 treated at 600 °C and Rh(0.001 wt%)/Gd2O3 treated at 550 °C was very close, i.e. 2.0 × 1016 and 2.1 × 1016, respectively. The as-treated catalysts also show a similar activity (Fig. 2).
Fig. 2 Rate of propene formation at 550 °C over bare Eu2O3 (●) and Gd2O3 (●) and their counterparts with 0.001 wt% ( ), 0.01 wt% ( ), and 0.03 wt% ( ) of Rh versus treatment temperature (Tred). X(C3H8) < 0.1, C3H8 : N2 = 2 : 3 feed.
In contrast with the previously tested Ru/YZrOx and Ru/LaZrOx,29 the activity of Rh/Gd2O3 and Rh/Eu2O3 increased with a decrease in Rh loading (Fig. 2). Regardless of the loading, the rate of propene formation over Rh/Eu2O3 decreases with an increase in the temperature of treatment with H2, while a maximum in the rate was determined for the Rh/Gd2O3 catalysts. Moreover, the presence of the maximum became more pronounced with a decrease in the Rh loading. Thus, Rh(0.001 wt%)/Gd2O3 treated at 575 °C revealed the highest activity among all the tested catalysts. What is a fundamental reason behind the observed effects?
To answer this question, we initially carried out H2-TPR tests (Fig. S6, ESI†) and determined the total amount of H2 consumed (Table S3, ESI†). The lowest amount was determined for bare Gd2O3 followed by bare Eu2O3 (198 vs. 309 μmol g−1). The consumption increases up to 953 μmol g−1 when Rh is present on the surface of these oxides (Table S3, ESI†). To prove if the increase is related to the reduction of Rh2O3 to Rh, we calculated the theoretical amount of H2 required for this process using catalysts with 0.001, 0.01 or 0.03 wt% Rh. The corresponding values are 0.15, 1.5 or 4.5 μmol g−1. They are significantly lower than the experimentally determined amounts of H2 consumed by the Rh-containing samples (between 387 and 953 μmol g−1). Thus, the metal improves the ability of Gd2O3 and Eu2O3 to release lattice oxygen upon H2 treatment. To check the importance of these catalyst properties for propene formation, we compared the reaction rate with the overall amount of H2 consumed in the H2-TPR tests (Fig. S7, ESI†). This amount represents the amount of oxygen vacancies and is proportional to the concentration of the Eucus or Gdcus sites created upon catalyst treatment with H2. Obviously, there should be an optimal amount of oxygen vacancies in Gd2O3 and Eu2O3, above which the rate of propene formation decreases (Fig. S7, ESI†). A similar phenomenon was established previously by us for Ru/YZrOx.29 Propene adsorption was suggested to be a reason for the negative effect of the reduction degree of ZrO2 on the activity.25,26 Such an explanation might also be valid for Eu2O3 and Gd2O3.
An overall scheme of product formation was established from selectivity–conversion relationships for propene, cracking products (C1–C2 hydrocarbons) and coke using the catalytic data obtained at different degrees of propane conversion achieved by varying the contact time. For all materials, the selectivity to propene decreased with the increasing propane conversion (Fig. 3), while the selectivity to cracking products and coke increased (Fig. S8, ESI†). With respect to this, no evident differences between the bare oxides and the supported materials could be identified. Thus, Rh does not appear to directly contribute to the formation of all these products. The selectivity to propene decreases with the increasing propane conversion due to the consecutive propene transformations into cracking products and coke, with the latter being the dominant side product. Although the Eu2O3- or Gd2O3-based catalysts do not differ in the overall scheme of propane conversion into individual products, they differ in the kinetics of consecutive transformations of propene. As seen in Fig. 3, the usage of Gd2O3 instead of Eu2O3 has a positive effect on the propene selectivity; higher selectivity values were obtained over the former catalysts at a propane conversion higher than 10%. In addition, the slope of the selectivity–conversion relationship for Gd2O3 is lower than that for Eu2O3. In other words, the former catalyst has lower ability for an undesired conversion of the primarily formed propene.

For analysing the kinetically relevant step(s) in the course of the PDH reaction over Gd2O3, the temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor with sub millisecond resolution was applied.33 To this end, C3H8 : Ar = 1 : 1 or C3D8 : Ar = 1 : 1 mixtures were pulsed at 550 °C over Gd2O3 treated at 600 °C (Fig. 4a and b) or Rh(0.001 wt%)/Gd2O3 treated at 550 °C (Fig. S9, ESI†).
Fig. 4 Dimensionless responses of (a) C3H8 and C3H6, (b) C3D8 and C3D6 or (c and d) D2, H2, and HD recorded after pulsing C3H8 : Ar = 1 : 1, C3D8 : Ar = 1 : 1 or D2 : Ne = 1 : 1 mixtures over bare Gd2O3 (a–c) or Rh/Gd2O3 at 550 °C. Grey D2 responses in (c and d) were recorded in the absence of H/D exchange. The responses are transformed according to Gleaves et al.34 Gd2O3 and Rh/Gd2O3 were treated in H2 at 600 °C and 550 °C, respectively.
Owing to the unique characteristics of this reactor, it is possible to observe if propene and hydrogen are formed with different kinetics, i.e. which is faster, propene or hydrogen formation. As expected, C3H6 appeared when C3H8 was pulsed. However, H2 was not observed (Fig. 4a). The reason for its absence might be the low amount (about 1014 H2 molecules per pulse) which cannot be correctly detected (mass spectroscopic sensitivity towards propene is significantly higher than that towards hydrogen). Alternatively, when H2 was formed very slowly, its response would be broad and the ratio of signal to noise would be low accordingly which is also not favourable for appropriate detection.
As a next step, we checked if there is a kinetic isotopic effect upon breaking the C–H bond in propane. This was confirmed by pulse tests with C3D8, where C3D6 was not observed. D2 was also not formed (Fig. 4b). Additional H/D exchange tests proved that breakage and formation of the hydrogen–hydrogen bonds should be a fast process as significant amounts of HD were detected upon D2 pulsing over Gd2O3 or Rh(0.001 wt%)/Gd2O3 (Fig. 4c and d). Thus, we can conclude that the breaking of C–H bonds should be the rate-limiting step in PDH.
In summary, for the first time, the present study demonstrated the application potential of bare Eu2O3 or Gd2O3 for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propene. Their activity is governed by the presence of coordinatively unsaturated metal cations participating in the activation of the C–H bond in propane. Their concentration depends on the ability of the metal oxide to release its lattice oxygen upon reductive treatment with H2. In addition, the intrinsic activity of such sites was concluded to depend on the kind of metal oxide. Gdcus reveals a higher activity than Eucus and the previously tested Zrcus. Thus, the obtained fundamental knowledge may be used for designing other alternative-type catalysts based on non-reducible metal oxides.
