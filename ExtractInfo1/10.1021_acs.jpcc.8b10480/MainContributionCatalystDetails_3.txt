The given document does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It discusses the mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts, but does not provide details on conversion, selectivity, stability or other performance metrics for a specific catalyst. The document focuses on computational modeling and DFT calculations to analyze the ODHP reaction mechanism on different edges of h-BN, rather than experimental evaluation of a catalyst. Since it does not pertain to advances in catalyst performance for propane dehydrogenation, I do not have the relevant details to populate the output template.
