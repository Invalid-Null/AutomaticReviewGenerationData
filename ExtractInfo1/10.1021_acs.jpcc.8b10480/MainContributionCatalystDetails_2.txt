The given document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation for converting propane to propylene. It focuses on the mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propene on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) catalysts. While it provides insights into ODHP, it does not present any specific catalyst enhancements for improving selectivity, conversion or stability.
