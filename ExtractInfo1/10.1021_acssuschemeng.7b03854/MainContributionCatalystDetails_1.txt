The provided document does not contain any discussion of propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It focuses on process design methodology and sustainability analysis for on-purpose propylene production, without going into catalyst details. Therefore, I have indicated that the content is not directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation catalysis.
