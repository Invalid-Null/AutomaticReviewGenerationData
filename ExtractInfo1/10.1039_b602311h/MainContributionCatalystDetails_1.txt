The given document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation. It discusses the quantification of supported metal oxides during temperature programmed reduction experiments, and does not mention propane dehydrogenation or converting propane to propylene. Since it is not related to PDH or ODH, I have indicated "No" for relevance and did not extract any information about a catalyst or performance enhancements.
