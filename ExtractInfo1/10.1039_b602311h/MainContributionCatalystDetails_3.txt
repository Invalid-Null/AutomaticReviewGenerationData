The given document does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It discusses the application of Raman spectroscopy for quantifying supported metal oxides during temperature programmed reduction experiments with hydrogen. While it mentions some inconsistencies observed between UV-Vis and Raman data during these experiments, it does not provide details on propane dehydrogenation specifically. Since the core focus is on Raman spectroscopy methods rather than propane conversion catalysis, I have indicated that the document does not seem directly relevant.
