Radical Cation Intermediates in Propane Dehydrogenation and Propene Hydrogenation over H-[Fe] Zeolites
Abstract
This report investigates the mechanistic relationship between the monomolecular propane dehydrogenation reaction and the reverse reaction, the propene hydrogenation, over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 catalysts. It is shown that the difference in the apparent activation energies of the forward and reverse reactions is equal to the reaction enthalpy (∼130 kJ mol–1) and that the rate constants of the reactions have an isokinetic relationship. The ratios of the rate constants of the forward to the reverse reactions are equal to the equilibrium constant (e.g., KP ≈ 0.033 bar at 773 K) even if the reactions occur separately, away from equilibrium. The results are consistent with the principle of microscopic reversibility and indicate that both forward and reverse reactions are structurally related and proceed through the same elementary steps and reaction intermediates. The pattern of selectivity, the activation energy, and the estimated enthalpy and entropy of formation of the transition states in H-[Fe]ZSM-5 are very different from the observed values for the isostructural H-[Al]ZSM-5, indicating that despite their structural similarities the reactions proceed through different mechanisms in each catalyst. Analysis of the energy change along the reaction coordinate, including the reaction enthalpy and the apparent activation energies, suggests that in H-[Fe]ZSM-5 the reaction proceeds through radical cation-like intermediates. Analysis of a putative reaction mechanism and the energetics of electron transfer in the zeolite channels shows that dehydrogenation of propane is kinetically favored (as observed) over cracking of propane because ethene radical cations are less stable than propene radical cations.

Controlling the activity and selectivity of catalytic alkane activation and directly converting alkanes to more valuable products has been a problem of interest in chemistry and chemical industry. (1-8) Alkanes are chemically inert because all their carbon atoms have four sigma bonds, which is a configuration that requires a substantial amount of energy for C–H bond breaking. Conversion of alkanes is usually observed at high reaction temperature, and the selectivity of the reaction is difficult to control. Mechanistic understanding of alkane activation can contribute to the systematic and practical control of alkane conversions. Dehydrogenation of alkanes is one of the most important industrial alkane activation processes; the reaction is energetically difficult because it is endothermic and endergonic.
Chromium oxide catalysts have been used by industry for decades for alkane dehydrogenations and achieve relatively high yields (60–80%) at high temperatures between 830 and 920 K. (9-12) However, environmental concerns have been raised concerning the chromium oxide catalysts because they contain carcinogenic Cr6+, the amount of which increases during the regeneration stage, potentially increasing the risk of lung cancer. (13, 14) There is also potential for chromium contamination of soil and water. (15) High oxidation states of chromium (Cr6+) were found in chromium oxide catalysts after calcination, (16) but reduced Cr3+ ions are the active components of the catalyst. (17, 18) Because the reduced Cr3+ species are reoxidized to Cr6+, a redox mechanism for dehydrogenation of alkanes has been proposed on chromium oxide catalysts. (10, 18-20)
In a previous report we investigated the catalytic behavior of iron–silicate zeolites for monomolecular propane conversion. (21) The reaction proceeds through only two pathways: cracking and dehydrogenation. The ratio of dehydrogenation to cracking reaction rates at a reaction temperature of 773 K was about 22 over H-[Fe]ZSM-5, while H-[Al]ZSM-5 exhibited higher selectivity for cracking; the ratio was about 0.5. At higher conversion (20%) than what is typically used for the monomolecular reaction (<2%), the dehydrogenation selectivity was still high (∼80%) and comparable to the selectivity on the industrial chromium oxide catalysts. (21) The apparent activation energy of propane dehydrogenation over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (115 kJ mol–1) was lower than the energy over H-[Al]ZSM-5 (173 kJ mol–1). Jones et al. recently compared deprotonation enthalpies of H-[Fe]ZSM-5 and H-[Al]ZSM-5 and determined that the deprotonation enthalpy of the iron sample is higher by 23 kJ mol–1. As a consequence, acid-catalyzed reactions on the iron zeolite should be slower and have higher activation energies than on the aluminum forms. (22) Thus, activation energy differences between Fe and Al zeolites indicate that the reaction proceeds through a nonprotolytic mechanism in the iron samples. Enhanced dehydrogenation selectivity (dehydrogenation rate/cracking rate 0.3:1) and lower apparent activation energies (187 versus 127 kJ mol–1) were also reported for dehydroxylated aluminosilicate zeolites. It has been suggested (23) that dehydroxylation of Brønsted acid sites can occur by homolytic decomposition, producing an oxygen atom with a single-occupied molecular orbital that might lead to redox reactions at high temperatures. These results suggest that propane conversion mechanism over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 is not protolytic, the mechanism that is now accepted to occur over the acid form of aluminosilicate zeolites. (24-26) The protolytic mechanism over H-[Al]ZSM-5 involves formation of alkanium-like transition states, formed after the transfer of a proton from the zeolite acid site to the adsorbed propane molecule (Scheme 1a). A redox mechanism involving formation of propane radical cations as reaction intermediates (27) over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (Scheme 1b) has been suggested. This scheme shows a mechanism in which tetrahedral FeIII in the zeolite framework is reduced to FeII as an electron is transferred from a propane molecule occluded in the zeolite channel. The tetrahedral FeII is oxidized back to tetrahedral FeIII after formation of propene in the reaction cycle.

Scheme 1. Reaction Mechanisms for Dehydrogenation of Propane (a) via an Alkanium Ion over H-[Al]-ZSM-5 and (b) via Radical Cation over H-[Fe]-ZSM-5
Tetrahedral FeII in silicates and other oxides have been reported for synthetic glasses such as Na2FeSi3O8, K2FeSi3O8, (28) MFe0.5Si2.5O6 (M = K, Na, Cs), (29-31) Fe2SiO4, (32, 33) and Rb2FeSi3O8 (34) as well as for minerals such as staurolite (Fe1.5Mg0.5Al9Si3.9Al0.1O22(OH)2 13.1 wt % tetrahedral FeIIO4/2). (34) These structures demonstrate that a tetrahedral FeIIO4/2 structure is chemically stable and could be formed during the reaction without destruction of the framework or migration of Fe atoms from the framework to an extra-framework position. An example of the crystal structure of the synthetic iron–silicate glass is depicted in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).
Further mechanistic investigations are required to confirm the hypothesis that a redox mechanism is responsible for propane conversion over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 and to develop a better understanding of the potential of H-[Fe]ZSM-5 as an industrial catalysts. Investigation of reverse reactions can be a useful in the determination of reaction mechanisms because the mechanism and the kinetically relevant transition state should be the same for both forward and reverse reactions based on the principle of microscopic reversibility. For example, investigations of the monomolecular propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation have been reported by Gounder and Iglesia. (35, 36) In an early report by Savage et al., (38) the reverse reaction of n-alkylbenzene pyrolysis was used to study mechanisms and kinetics models for hydrocarbon pyrolysis, and it was shown that inclusion of radical hydrogen transfer steps was essential for the model to fit the experimental data. Freund and Olmstead have, separately, developed the mechanism of butylbenzene pyrolysis. The model was comprised of reversible elementary reactions and predicted the reaction rates within a factor of 2. (39) Van Santen’s group reported various mechanistic studies of catalytic reactions, such as NHx dehydrogenation and oxidation, considering the reverse reactions simultaneously. (40-42) These reports demonstrate that the principle of microscopic reversibility can be useful in the analysis of hydrocarbon reactions and can aid in the verification of reaction mechanisms. Propene hydrogenation is the reverse reaction of propane dehydrogenation, and based on the principle of microscopic reversibility, (36-38, 40-43) reactions should proceed through the same elementary steps.
The kinetics of radical cation formation inside a zeolite pore can be described by the Marcus theory of electron transfer. (44-47) It can replace the Eyring transition state theory when two chemical species change their charge via electron jumping without large structural change. (48) The concept of catalytic control of electron transfer reactions, however, remains an undeveloped field. (49) Marcus theory states that rates of electron transfer can decrease as the driving force of electron transfer increases, depending of the magnitude of the reorganization energy of electron transfer (the so-called Marcus inverted region). A reaction in the Marcus inverted region, however, was only discovered 30 years after publication of the original ideas. (50) Rates of reaction involving electron transfer usually increase as the driving force increases. Note that spontaneous electron transfer from hydrocarbons with low ionization energies adsorbed in zeolite pores to the zeolite framework has been reported multiple times. (51-56)
Here we investigate the kinetics of propene hydrogenation and propane dehydrogenation on both H-[Al]ZSM-5 and H-[Fe]ZSM-5. Propene hydrogenation was performed under excess H2 (H2/C3H6 > 2500) to prevent formation of undesired products, such as propene oligomers. The selectivity of propane conversion over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 was analyzed from a thermochemical perspective. Energy changes along the reaction coordinates were estimated based on the apparent activation energies and the ionization energies of propane and propene. The results indicate that in H-[Fe]ZSM-5 the main reaction pathway proceeds through radical cation intermediates and not through alkanium-like species.

Synthesis methods to prepare H-[Al]ZSM-5 and H-[Fe]ZSM-5 and the experimental procedure for propane conversion have been reported elsewhere. (21, 23, 51) In general, about 20 mg of zeolite catalyst was transferred to a quartz tube reactor (i.d. = 5 mm). To support the sample in the center of the reactor chamber, quartz wool (∼0.05 g) was placed near the bottom of the reactor tube and quartz chips (∼1.6 mm diameter, Quartz Plus, Inc.) were placed between the quartz wool and the sample. The reactor was heated in a cylindrical furnace (C5232, Hoskins Mfg. Co.), controlled by a temperature controller (NC 74000, Omega Engineering) and a thermocouple (type K, Omega Engineering) inserted in the quartz tube directly over the sample. The samples were first treated in flowing N2 (100 sccm) by heating to 753 K with a rate of 2 K/min for 3 h to obtain the acid form of the zeolites. The reactants were flown into the reactor with dry N2 as the carrier gas to vary the partial pressure of H2 (0.2–1 bar) and C3H6 (from 5 × 10–5 to 4 × 10–4 bar). A high H2/C3H6 ratio (>2500) was maintained at all times to avoid oligomerization reactions. The reactor effluent is analyzed using gas chromatography (GC, Shimadzu 2014). A molsieve column is used for separation and eluted into a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). A RT-alumina column is connected to a flame ionization detector (FID) for separation and quantification of hydrocarbons. The temperature of the columns was increased from 308 to 393 K at a rate of 10 K/min, and the products were collected during a 12 min program.

Catalytic Hydrogenation of Propene vs Dehydrogenation of Propane
Catalytic monomolecular propane conversion has been studied over a number of H-[Al] zeolites (24, 25, 36, 57, 58) under conditions at which the zeolite surface is mostly empty, such as low reactant partial pressure, low conversion (<2%), and high reaction temperature. The catalytic cycle of propane dehydrogenation (Scheme 2) includes adsorption of propane in the zeolite channels (step 1), formation of an alkanium-like transition state (step 2) as the rate-determining step, and desorption of products and diffusion to the exterior of the zeolite crystals (steps 3–5). (36) The kinetics can be described at the limit of low coverage as follows

where rD is the rate of propane dehydrogenation per site, PC3H8 is the partial pressure of propane, kDapp is the apparent dehydrogenation rate constant (first order), K1 is the equilibrium constant relating intrazeolite propane concentration to gas or extra-zeolite propane pressure, and k2 is the intrinsic rate constant for the rate-determining step. KD‡ is the equilibrium constant for formation of activated complexes from gaseous propane, Ea,Dapp is the apparent activation energy (experimentally determined; ; as can be seen in eq 3, it is the enthalpy difference between intrazeolite intermediates and extra-zeolite reactants), ADapp is the pre-exponential factor, and ΔSDapp is the apparent activation entropy (the difference in entropy between the transition state in the zeolite channel and the reactants in the gas phase).

Scheme aThe asterisk (*) denotes species adsorbed in the zeolite pores. Step 2 is rate determining in the forward direction.
The propene hydrogenation reaction was conducted from 733 to 803 K with excess H2 (H2/C3H6 > 2500); the temperature range was similar to the one used for propane dehydrogenation. Under these reaction conditions propane was produced as the major product (selectivity of over 80%, Figure 1a), while ethylene and methane were formed in equimolar ratios with low selectivity. The minor products can be formed through monomolecular cracking of propoxide species (59, 60) or through interconversion of dehydrogenation transition states (C–H–H) to cracking transition states (C–C–H). (23, 36) Propane production rates show a linear correlation with the partial pressures of H2 and C3H6 (Figure 2), and consequently, (i) intrazeolite H2 and C3H6 concentrations are equilibrated with their extrazeolite pressures, (ii) C3 intermediates are kinetically relevant, and (iii) zeolite surface coverage is low. The rate constants at a reaction temperature of 773 K are defined to be the slope of the propane formation rates vs the partial pressures of C3H6 and H2. The dehydrogenation average rate constant is 0.036 ± 0.006 (95% confidence interval) [mol (mol Al)−1 s–1 (bar H2)−1 (bar C3H6)−1] at 773 K (Supporting Information, Figure S2). Kinetics analysis of propene hydrogenation can be described as follows (based on the reverse reaction of the propane dehydrogenation mechanism shown in Scheme 2)

where rH is the rate of propene hydrogenation per site, PC3H6 and PH2 are the partial pressures of propene and hydrogen, kHapp is the apparent hydrogenation rate constant (second order), K3, K4, and K5 are the equilibrium constants relating intrazeolite transition state concentrations and reactants to extrazeolite reactants in the gas phase, k–2 is the rate constant for the reverse rate-determining step, KH‡ is the equilibrium constant for formation of the transition state with respect to the gas phase, and Ea,Happ is the apparent activation energy and equal to the enthalpy difference between intrazeolite intermediates and extrazeolite reactants. For second-order reactions, the relationship between the rate constant and the enthalpy and entropy of the transition state can be modified as described by eq 6. c° is the concentration of the standard state, (61)AHapp is the pre-exponential factor, and ΔSHapp is the apparent activation entropy, the difference between the transition state in the zeolite channel and the reactants in the gas phase.

In Scheme 3 the catalytic cycle of propane dehydrogenation over H-[Fe] zeolites includes a (proposed) electron transfer step that leads to formation of radical cations (step 7), a step not present in Scheme 2 over H-[Al]ZSM-5. An additional electron transfer step from the zeolite to the propene radical cation occurs in step 9 because spontaneous electron transfer can occur for hydrocarbons in [Fe]ZSM-5. There is another possible reaction pathway for monomolecular propane conversion—the cracking of propane (Scheme 4)—after formation of radical-like intermediates. This second pathway would lead to formation of an intrazeolite ethylene radical cation. However, cracking selectivity is very low over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 (∼22 times lower than the dehydrogenation selectivity), (21) indicating that this reaction pathway is energetically unfavorable (see below). The kinetics of monomolecular propane dehydrogenation over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 are described in the Supporting Information (ES1–ES4).

Propene hydrogenation was performed on H-[Fe]MFI under the same reaction conditions used for H-[Al]ZSM-5. Propane was produced over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 at a much higher rate than ethylene as shown in Figure 1b. The propane selectivity over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 was higher than that over H-[Al]ZSM-5, even when H2/C3H6 ratios were below 2500. The reaction rate dependency with respect to the partial pressure of C3H6 and H2 is also first order (Figure 2). The rate constants (kFe) at 773 K are ∼0.18 ± 0.04 (95% confidence interval) [mol (mol Fe)−1 s–1 (bar H2)−1 (bar C3H6)−1]. The kinetics of propene hydrogenation over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 are described in the Supporting Information (ES5–ES8). The apparent activation energy and entropy for propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation over H-[Al]ZSM-5 and H-[Fe]ZSM-5 are listed in Table 1.

The rate constants of propane dehydrogenation (kDapp, mol s–1 (mol Al or Fe)−1 (bar C3H8)−1) and propene hydrogenation (kHapp, mol s–1 (mol Al or Fe)−1 (bar H2)−1 (bar C3H6)−1) are presented in Figure 3. The rate constants for propane dehydrogenation over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 are higher than those over H-[Al]ZSM-5, and the rate constants of propene hydrogenation over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 are also higher than those over H-[Al]ZSM-5. The apparent activation energies are 173 and 115 kJ mol–1 for propane dehydrogenation over H-[Al]ZSM-5 and H-[Fe]ZSM-5, respectively (Table 1). The apparent activation energies for propene hydrogenation are 42 and −14 kJ mol–1, respectively. Gounder et al. reported the activation energy of propane dehydrogenation and propene dehydrogenation. (36) Even if our values are lower than the values reported by Gounder, they are still within the wide range (90–200 kJ mol–1) (25, 57) of activation energies for propane dehydrogenation reported in the literature. Note that the activation energies of both reactions over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 are lower than those over H-[Al]ZSM-5. Higher activation energies would be expected through the protolytic mechanism because of the weaker acidity of H-[Fe]ZSM-5 vs H-[Al]ZSM-5. (22, 62) The lower activation energies over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 in this work support the hypothesis that the reaction mechanism of hydrocarbon conversions over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 is different from H-[Al]ZSM-5, as suggested earlier. (21)

Lewis acids can catalyze alkane dehydrogenation reactions as is the case for Zn/SiO2. (25, 63) In our case, however, the iron atoms are not readily accessible to coordination to the hydrocarbon because the FeIII is occluded in the silicate framework, and this mode of operation is unlikely to explain the observed catalytic properties of H-[Fe]ZSM-5.
The entropies of formation of the transition states are −96 and −155 J mol–1 K–1 for propane dehydrogenation over H-[Al]ZSM-5 and H-[Fe]ZSM-5, respectively. The negative values are as expected because formation of the transition state requires loss of translational degrees of freedom of the gas-phase reactant. The much more negative value for the entropy of formation of the transition state on H-[Fe]ZSM-5 also suggests that these reactions proceed through a different reaction mechanism. The entropy of translation of propane in a classical ideal gas can be calculated using the Sackur–Tetrode equation
(17)
where V is the volume of the gas, N is Avogadro’s number, U is the internal energy of the gas, kB is Boltzmann’s constant, m is the mass of a gas particle, and h is Planck’s constant. The calculated entropy of translation of propane is 167.9 J mol–1 K–1 at 773 K (see Supporting Information). The absolute value of the entropy of formation of transition states over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 is closer to the entropy of translation of propane, indicating that the propane in H-[Fe]ZSM-5 loses almost all of its translational degree of freedom. At this point it is not clear why, in an electron transfer process, the transition state is so “tight”. (64) The entropies of formation of the transition state are −246 and −302 J mol–1 K–1 for propene hydrogenation over H-[Al]ZSM-5 and H-[Fe]ZSM-5. The entropies for the hydrogenation are much more negative (about twice as large) because they involve loss of translational degrees of freedom of two gas-phase molecules. (The entropies of translation of propene and H2 are 167.3 and 129.3 J mol–1 K–1, respectively.) The entropies for propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation over H-[Al] zeolites reported by Gounder (36) are −59 and −193 J mol–1 K–1, which are higher than our values because of the difference in the activation energies.
Propane Conversion over H-[Fe]ZSM-5
The difference in the apparent activation energy for propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation is related to the enthalpy change in the reaction
(18)
The transition state enthalpies, the enthalpy of adsorption into the zeolite pores, and the enthalpy of electron transfer cancel out because the transition state is the same in both the forward and the reverse reactions. For both H-[Al]ZSM-5 and H-[Fe]ZSM-5, the differences between the apparent activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation are 131 and 129 kJ mol–1 (the same within experimental error) and are identical to the enthalpy for the stoichiometric propane dehydrogenation reaction (∼130 kJ mol–1 at the reaction temperatures investigated here, see Supporting Information). It is also shown in Figure 3 that the extended lines to infinite temperature in Arrhenius plots all intersect at 931 K, the isokinetic temperature. (65-68) The isokinetic relationship satisfies the following relation (65)
(19)
The values of eq 19 for propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation over H-[Al]ZSM-5 and H-[Fe]ZSM-5 are 255 ± 2 kJ mol–1. The isokinetic temperatures and constants have the same values for both H-[Al]ZSM-5 and H-[Fe]ZSM-5 catalysts within experimental error. Equilibrium constants were determined using the van’t Hoff equation (48) (Supporting Information) and compared to the ratio of reaction rate constants for propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation (Figure 4). The ratios of reaction constants obtained under the conditions of low concentrations of the reactants were consistent with the equilibrium constants for both H-[Al]ZSM-5 and H-[Fe]ZSM-5, even when the reactant and product concentrations are far away from equilibrium. This similarity verifies the reliability of the experimental reaction rates and turnover frequencies obtained in this report.

The relative energy changes along the reaction coordinates were analyzed based on the kinetic and thermodynamic data for propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation over H-[Al]ZSM-5 (Figure 5a). First, propane adsorbs in the pores of ZSM-5 with an enthalpy of adsorption of −46 kJ mol–1, as measured in earlier reports. (69-72) The final products, propene and H2 in the gas phase, are obtained after desorption from the zeolite channels. (73) In the opposite direction, the apparent activation energy for propene hydrogenation is indicated in the figure. Both reactions proceed through a common reaction intermediate, the alkanium over H-[Al]ZSM-5.

For H-[Fe]ZSM-5, a radical cation is suggested as the reaction intermediate. Note that the radical cation is not formed at the transition state. As shown in Schemes 2 and 3, the primary difference of the catalytic cycle over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 versus that over H-[Al]ZSM-5 is the electron transfer between reactants and products in the zeolite channels. The ionization potential of both reactants and products is a factor that must be considered to explain the activation energy and selectivity for propane conversion over H-[Fe]ZSM-5. In Scheme 5, energy changes for the elementary steps of propane and propene are shown, assuming each occurs through a one-electron transfer step. The ionization potentials for propane, propene, and ethylene (74-77)—in the gas phase—were used for estimation of energy changes as well as the reaction enthalpies of propane dehydrogenation in the gas phase. A negative energy change (−7 kJ mol–1) was calculated for the dehydrogenation pathway, while a positive energy change (24 kJ mol–1, endothermic) was calculated for cracking. Clearly, the positive energy change of the cracking pathway indicates that this pathway requires more energy than the dehydrogenation, which makes it kinetically unfavorable. In the case of [Al]ZSM-5, the higher activation energy was compensated by a large activation entropy, which results in comparable reaction rates for cracking and dehydrogenation. (57) Activation entropies for [Fe]ZSM-5 were lower than those for [Al]ZSM-5 but could not compensate for the significantly higher activation energy for cracking. Even considering that the products (CH4, C2H4) obtained via the cracking pathway are thermodynamically more stable than the products formed through the dehydrogenation pathway (81 vs 130 kJ mol–1), the higher activation barrier obtained using the ionization potentials for the cracking pathway and the low activation entropy explain why the dehydrogenation pathway is kinetically favored.
Scheme 5
Scheme 5. Estimated Energy Changes Associated with the Propane Radical Cation for (a) Dehydrogenation and (b) Cracking of Propane
The calculated difference in activation energies for cracking and dehydrogenation is 31 kJ mol–1 (see Scheme 5). Using the observed ratio of dehydrogenation to cracking of ∼22 for the propane reaction over H-[Fe]ZSM-5, (21) the difference between activation energies for cracking and dehydrogenation is calculated as ∼20 kJ mol–1. The energy difference calculated in Scheme 5 (31 kJ mol–1) is even larger than the activation energy difference obtained using the experimental data and supports the conclusion that a high dehydrogenation selectivity should be observed over H-[Fe]ZSM-5.
The approximated energy changes and reaction coordination for both dehydrogenation and cracking pathways are depicted in the energy diagram shown in Figure 5 b. The energy changes include the heat of adsorption for propane in ZSM-5 and the apparent activation energy for the propane dehydrogenation. A radical cation intermediate is suggested for the reaction over H-[Fe]ZSM-5. After formation of propane radical cation, the reaction can proceed through either dehydrogenation or cracking pathways. The heat of adsorption (desorption) of propene in ZSM-5 and the apparent activation energy for propene hydrogenation are included for the dehydrogenation pathway, while the heat of adsorption for ethylene in ZSM-5 is used in the cracking pathway. The final enthalpy of the products is obtained from the enthalpy of reaction in the gas phase. This energy diagram explains why dehydrogenation rates should be much higher than cracking rates if radical cations are key reaction intermediates.
The reorganization energy of electron transfer is unknown for propane conversion over [Fe]ZSM-5 catalysts, but an approximation can be made using the Marcus equation (46, 47, 49) (see Supporting Information)
(20)
where ΔG‡ is the Gibbs free energy of activation, ΔG° is the standard Gibbs free energy accompanying the electron transfer reaction, and λ is the reorganization energy. ΔG‡ was estimated as the sum of the apparent activation energy and the heat of adsorption of propane on H-[Fe]ZSM-5 zeolites (∼161 kJ/mol), and based on this number, the reorganization energies were estimated to be between 13.2 and 40.3 kJ mol–1. This corresponds to ΔG° values from 80 to 121 kJ mol–1. These calculations indicate that the propane electron transfer reaction is within the Marcus inverted region, and consequently, molecules with lower ionization potentials than propane would show slower rates of reaction by this mechanism.
Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propane conversion rates over H-[Fe]ZSM-5 catalyst were analyzed using mechanistic relationships between its forward (monomolecular propane dehydrogenation) and its reverse (propene hydrogenation) reactions. The difference between the apparent activation energies of hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions was ∼130 kJ mol–1, which is equal to the reaction enthalpy of propane dehydrogenation. The extended Arrhenius plots of the rate constants for hydrogenation and dehydrogenation intersect at 931 K, which indicate that the forward and reverse reactions follow an isokinetic relationship. The ratios of the rate constants of the forward and reverse reactions are consistent with the equilibrium constants determined using the van’t Hoff equation. From these observations we can conclude that propene hydrogenation proceeds through identical elementary steps to propane dehydrogenation. A redox mechanism involving formation of propane radical cations was proposed as the main reaction pathway for H-[Fe] zeolite catalysts. The redox pathway dominates any protolytic pathway over H-[Fe] zeolites. The cracking pathway on H-[Fe]ZSM-5 has a higher activation energy (∼30 kJ mol–1) than the dehydrogenation pathway as a result of the differences in the ionization potentials of propene and ethene. The difference in ionization potential of propene and ethene explains why the dehydrogenation pathway is kinetically favored over the cracking pathway. Mechanistic insight into the hydrocarbon conversions and their selectivity over H-[Fe] zeolites can be established based on this case study. To the bestof our knowledge, this is the first report of catalytic alkane conversion including electron transfer in an acid zeolite.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
