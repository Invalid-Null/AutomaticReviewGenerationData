A novel strategy to fabricate a hierarchical Ni–Al LDH platinum nanocatalyst with enhanced thermal stability†
A novel strategy has been proposed to fabricate a hierarchical Ni–Al LDH platinum nanocatalyst (LDH-Pt). The formation mechanism involves loading of Pt NPs on nanocarbon spheres (NCSs) and calcination of NCSs/Pt/Al2O3 to remove inner NCSs. Then, Ni–Al LDH nanosheets in situ grew from hollow Pt/Al2O3 nanoclusters via a hydrothermal process, eventually fabricating the hierarchical LDH-Pt nanocatalyst. TEM and SEM images were employed to characterize each step of the synthesis process. During the hydrothermal process, most of the Pt NPs in Al2O3 shells were inlaid in the in situ grown LDH nanosheets, exhibiting a higher thermal stability than traditional impregnated LDH catalysts. Lastly, the as-synthesized LDH-Pt was tested with a high temperature reaction (590 °C) of propane dehydrogenation to further demonstrate the enhanced thermal stability of LDH-Pt.
1. Introduction
The platinum catalyst has been widely applied in various catalytic reactions, including CO oxidation, hydrocarbon methanol oxidation, propylene epoxidation and propane dehydrogenation.1–4 The noble metal catalytic efficiency decreases remarkably with increasing Pt NPs diameter.5,6 Therefore, researchers tend to fabricate small active particles of nanoscale in the noble metal catalyst. However, in practical applications that particularly involve high temperature reactions, Pt NPs tend to sinter to reduce surface energy and thus decrease catalytic activity.7 Unstable active sites under harsh conditions is one of the main troubles in the application of the Pt catalyst. Thus, it is useful to find a way to improve the thermal stability of noble metal catalysts. Recently, researchers have demonstrated that a physical barrier can efficiently increase the thermal stability of noble metal NPs.8–13 Despite these achievements, there are still various challenges in the synthesis of a thermally stable catalyst. Traditional physical barrier construction methods mainly involve the coating of protective layers on active sites. The protective layer may increase the diffusion path and influence the mass transfer efficiency.14 In addition, most of the formation process of the protective layer is not easy to control.15,16 Furthermore, the catalytic performances are remarkably affected by the properties of the catalyst support.17,18 Various metallic oxides, such as TiO2, CeO2, ZnO and ZrO2 have been used as supporting materials in the synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts.19–24 However, the metallic oxide materials are restricted to the single component, and it is very hard to construct complex structures via the coating method to further extend their applications, for example, hierarchical structures. Multi-component materials with hierarchical architectures might exhibit new multifunctional properties.25 Thus, a novel and flexible method for the fabrication of a hierarchical sinter-resistant catalyst is highly desirable.
Layered double hydroxide (LDH) is a class of anion exchanging clays in which a fraction of divalent cations is replaced by trivalent cations forming positively charged layers and counter ions between the layers. Due to the excellent ion-exchange ability and tunable composition, LDH has become one of the most promising materials in various fields such as catalysis, adsorbents and drug delivery systems.26–28 It gives us a hint that it might be possible to combine LDH with noble metal NPs to fabricate thermally stable catalyst systems. The traditional impregnation strategy is one of the most important methods in the synthesis of various supported Pt catalysts.29,30 However, the exposed Pt NPs and the weak interaction between the active sites and the catalyst support seriously limit the application areas of the support catalyst.
Hence, from the perspective of the structure design-point, we proposed a simple strategy for the synthesis of hierarchical Ni–Al composite (LDH-Pt) with inlaid Pt NPs in thin LDH sheets. The entire fabrication process of LDH-Pt is completely different from the traditional impregnation or the coating-based strategy. In the catalytic system, compared with bulk materials, the hierarchical structure could improve the catalytic performance of LDH-Pt for larger surface area. In addition, the thin LDH sheets offer an energy barrier to protect inlaid Pt NPs from sintering. The entire fabrication process could be divided into four steps (Fig. 1): (a) a layer of Pt NPs was uniformly immobilized on the surface of NCSs; (b) the NCSs/Pt surface was then coated with a layer of Al2O3 to fix the position of Pt NPs; (c) NCSs could be easily removed by calcinations in air to fabricate the hollow Pt/Al2O3 microsphere; (d) LDH sheets in situ grew from Pt/Al2O3 hollow substrates during the hydrothermal process, eventually forming the hierarchical LDH-Pt catalyst. This study might open a new strategy for the controllable synthesis of other extensive hybrid materials for different applications in the future.

2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Glucose, ethanol, isopropanol, K2PtCl6 (7.11 mg mL−1), sodium borohydride and APTES were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Hexamethylenetetramine (HMT, C6H12N4), Al(NO3)3·9H2O, NiSO4·6H2O and sodium citrate dihydrate were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. (Shanghai, China). All reagents were used without further purification.
2.2. Synthesis
The synthesis of functionalized NCSs NCSs were synthesized from glucose under hydrothermal conditions. In general, glucose (11 g) and DI water (80 mL) were mixed in a 100 mL Teflon-sealed autoclave and maintained at 160 °C for 4 h. NCSs could be isolated by centrifugation. Then, the as-obtained NCSs were added to a solution of isopropanol (100 mL) and APTES (0.5 mL) and heated up to 80 °C for 12 h to functionalize the surface of NCSs with amino groups.31 The resulting mixture was collected by centrifugation and washed three times with isopropanol. Synthesis of NCSs/Pt The as-functionalized NCSs (0.1 g) were dispersed into a mixture of DI water (100 mL), K2PtCl4 (1 mL, 7.11 mg mL−1), and trisodium citrate (5 mL, 20 mg mL−1) at room temperature (RT). After magnetic stirring for 2 h, fresh sodium borohydride (10 mL, 0.008 mg mL−1) was immediately injected into the solution under vigorous stirring. After stirring at RT for 12 h, Pt/NCSs colloids were synthesized and isolated via centrifugation. Finally, the collected products were dried at 60 °C for 6 h. Synthesis of hollow Pt/Al2O3 spheres Herein, 7.50 g of Al(NO3)3·9H2O and 0.5 g of NCSs/Pt were dissolved in 100 mL ethanol for 3 h. The infiltrated nanoparticles were separated via centrifugation and calcined at 500 °C for 5 h to obtain hollow Al2O3 spheres. Synthesis of the hierarchical LDH-Pt catalyst Herein, 2.63 g of NiSO4·6H2O and 0.560 g of HMT were dissolved in 25 mL of distilled water in a 50 mL Teflon autoclave vessel. Furthermore, 0.102 g of the as-prepared Pt/Al2O3 was immersed in the above mixed solution. The vessel was further treated under hydrothermal conditions at 140 °C for 10 h. After hydrothermal reaction, the sample was separated by centrifugation and dried at 80 °C to obtain the hierarchical Ni–Al LDH-Pt catalyst. The Ni/Al molar ratio of the final LDH-Pt catalyst was adjusted to ca. 10 by varying the added amount of NiSO4·6H2O during the hydrothermal process. Synthesis of the traditional impregnated LDH-Pt (TLDH-Pt) catalyst The Ni–Al LDH support could be first synthesized from the NCSs/Al2O3 materials. Then, the as-obtained Ni–Al LDH support (2 g) was impregnated in 5 mL of K2PtCl6 (3.56 mg mL−1) under vigorous stirring for 2 h. Subsequently, fresh sodium borohydride (10 mL, 0.008 mg mL−1) was immediately injected into the solution. After stirring for 12 h, the traditionally impregnated LDH-Pt (TLDH-Pt) catalyst was isolated by centrifugation and dried at 80 °C.
2.3. Characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments and energy dispersion X-ray analysis (EDX) were conducted on a JEM-1230 microscope operated at 100 kV. The TEM samples were prepared by transferring one drop of sample dispersion in ethanol onto a carbon-coated copper grid and then dried in air. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance Diffractometer (Germany) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) of the samples was performed with a Rigaku ThermoPlus TG8120 system from room temperature to 800 °C at the rate of 10 °C min−1 under air. UV-Vis spectra analysis was performed on a Shimadzu UV 3600 spectrometer. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on a Hitachi S-3400N scanning electron microscope. The nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherms were measured at −196 °C on an ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics USA). The specific surface area was determined from the linear part of the BET equation (P/P0 = 0.05–0.25). The pore size distribution was derived from the desorption branch of the N2 isotherm using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.
2.4. Catalytic evaluation
The catalytic reduction of 4-NP In a typical run, 4-NP (0.03 mL, 0.01 M, aqueous solution), H2O (2 mL) and nanocatalyst (1 mL, 1 mg mL−1) were mixed with freshly prepared NaBH4 (0.5 mL, 0.25 M, aqueous solution) in a quartz cell. The NaBH4 solution must be prepared with ice water to prevent NaBH4 from decomposing. The absorption spectra were recorded on a UV-Vis spectrophotometer at a regular interval in the range of 200–800 nm. The reaction of propane dehydrogenation The catalyst (mass 2.0 g) was placed into the center of a conventional quartz tubular micro-reactor reactor and the temperature was measured by a thermocouple inside a titanium thermowell, at the center of the catalyst bed. Reaction conditions were as follows: 590 °C for reaction temperature, 0.1 MPa pressure, n(H2)/n(C3H8) = 0.25 and the propane weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was 3.0 h−1. The reaction products were analyzed with online GC-14C gas chromatography equipped with an activated alumina packed column and a flame ionization detector (FID).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the catalysts
The first step in this project was to check every step of the catalyst preparation procedure. Generally, the entire fabrication process is started with the synthesis of NCSs under hydrothermal conditions (Fig. 2a). Various chemical reactions of glucose aromatization took place on the NCSs surface during the hydrothermal process, resulting in lots of organic compounds.32 The FTIR spectrum (Fig. 3a) was employed to identify the functional groups on the NCSs surface after hydrothermal and APTES functional treatment. The bands at 1709 and 1640 cm−1 were attributed to CO and CC vibrations, respectively. Then, the surfaces of NCSs were derivatized with a monolayer of APTES by heating in isopropanol. As shown in Fig. 3b, two peaks of NH2 groups at 2974 and 2926 cm−1 appeared after functional treatment, and the OH stretching band centered at 3410 cm−1 was weakened. The as-synthesized Pt NPs (ca. 2 nm in diameter) can be immobilized on the surface of functionalized NCSs uniformly for the strong chemical affinity between Pt NPs and primary amines (Fig. 2b).8 In the impregnation process, alumina sol was adsorbed on the surface of NCSs/Pt via electrostatic attraction. The UV-visible absorption characterization was used to identify the coating of alumina species on carbon materials. The absorption band at 255 nm shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) arose from the excitation of the surface plasmon mode of the Pt NPs on the NCSs surface. In contrast, when the original NCSs/Pt particles were covered with a layer of Al2O3, the surface plasmon peak became too weak to be observed, possibly because the Al2O3 shell confined the transfer of free electrons to the surroundings, suggesting the absorbance of alumina species on carbon spheres.

Fig. 4 shows representative TGA curves of original NCSs and NCSs/Pt/Al2O3, which were performed in air at a heating rate of 15 °C min−1. It was found that a slight weight loss occurred at 200 °C for the decomposition of the carbon skeleton (Fig. 4a). The original NCSs decomposed sharply at 300 °C with heat release. When the calcination temperature increased to 400 °C, about 56% of NCSs were removed. However, in contrast, the percent decomposition of NCSs in NCSs/Pt/Al2O3 was up to 80% at 400 °C. Consequently, after APTES treatment and Al2O3 coating, NCSs could be removed mostly at a relatively lower calcination temperature; moreover, the Pt NPs remained a small particle size. As shown in Fig. 2c, most of the NCSs were removed by calcination at 400 °C, forming the hollow Pt/Al2O3 spheres. The loaded Pt NPs (ca. 3.25 nm in diameter) are encapsulated in the hollow Al2O3 shells. Fig. 2d is the SEM image of the hollow Pt/Al2O3 spheres and, as marked in the blue circle, few blast holes appeared due to calcinations, and similar results have been reported earlier.33,34 The SAED pattern in Fig. 5b confirms the crystalline nature of the loaded Pt NPs, and the high resolution TEM image shows lattice fringes measured with a spacing of 0.226 nm, corresponding to the (111) atomic plane of the centered cubic fcc platinum.

The in situ growth technique suggests that LDH nanosheets are perpendicular to the substrate materials, which can form the hierarchical structure and avoid the formation of a multilayer stack of LDH sheets.35Fig. 5c and d show the typical TEM and SEM images of the LDH-Pt composites (ca. 100 nm in diameter) after 2 h of hydrothermal treatment, confirming the synthesis of the hierarchical LDHs structure. LDH sheets in situ grew from the hollow Pt/Al2O3 clusters, and numerous Pt NPs in the original hollow Pt/Al2O3 spheres uniformly dispersed in the petaloid LDH sheets. In addition, when prolonging the hydrothermal process to 12 h, the LDH sheets grew adequately, forming huge LDH-Pt composites (Fig. 6a) and the Pt NPs could be further separated by large LDH sheets. Furthermore, the Ni/Al molar ratio can be changed from 5 to 10 by varying the added amount of NiSO4·6H2O during the hydrothermal process (Fig. 7). Accordingly, the diameter of the as-synthesized spheres increased from about 3 μm to 6 μm and various huge thin LDH sheets appeared around the rim of the spheres (Fig. 6c). In addition, it must be noted that some of the irregular fragments can be observed on the surface of the inorganic spheres (Fig. 6d). The irregular LDH clusters can be attributed to the Al2O3 fragments formed by crack-formation during the calcination process. From Fig. 7b, it could be observed that the alumina content in the final LDH-Pt catalyst is ca. 1.8 wt%. The introduced alumina could be combined with the Ni species during hydrothermal treatment, in situ growing into the hierarchical Ni–Al LDH sheets structure. The numerous Pt NPs in hollow Pt/Al2O3 spheres were adequately separated by LDH sheets. More importantly, the inlaid Pt NPs in LDH sheets might exhibit a high thermal stability for the physical barrier effect of LDH sheets. In addition, to demonstrate the thermal stability of the LDH-Pt catalyst, traditional naked LDH-Pt (TLDH-Pt) catalysts have also been successfully synthesized. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), TLDH-Pt composites (ca. 6 μm in diameter) were assembled with numerous huge in situ grown LDH sheets and presented a similar morphology as LDH-Pt. In addition, from the EDX analysis of Fig. S3 (ESI†), it was found that the as-synthesized TLDH-Pt contained a similar element content as LDH-Pt, for instance, the Ni/Al molar ratio was about 10 and the Pt content was 0.9 wt%.

Furthermore, the phase structure and relative crystallinity of the as-prepared samples were investigated by XRD. Owing to the crystalline nature of the hollow Al2O3 substrate, the characteristic peaks of Al2O3 could be observed clearly in Fig. 8. The absence of Pt peaks can be attributed to the low Pt content or high dispersion of Pt NPs. Beyond that, the strong diffractions of Al2O3 may mask the peaks of Pt. The characteristic peaks of Al2O3 disappear for the consumption of the Al2O3 substrate, and the XRD pattern of LDH-Pt only shows the characteristic peaks of LDH and Pt. The peaks at 39.7°, 46.2°, 67.4°, and 81.2° correspond to the diffraction of (111), (200), (220), and (311) planes of face centered cubic fcc platinum, and the two intense peaks at low angles are the (003) and (006) reflections of the LDH system. In addition, the asymmetric peak at high angle range (near 60°) refers to the (113) reflection of a typical hexagonal system, demonstrating the successful synthesis of the LDH structure.36

The porosity of LDH-Pt was investigated by N2 adsorption–desorption measurement. Fig. 9 shows the adsorption–desorption isotherm of type IV and the corresponding pore size distribution curve. It can be clearly seen that the isotherm of LDH-Pt possesses an evident hysteresis loop in the pressure range of 0.5–1.0, indicating the presence of mesopores and macropores in LDH-Pt. As shown in the inset of Fig. 9, there is a pore size distribution centered in the mesoporous range (ca. 3.8 in diameter) and another at around 40 nm. In addition, the as-synthesized LDH-Pt catalyst shows a high specific surface area (279 m2 g−1) and large pore volume (0.159 cm3 g−1). The LDH sphere is a true nanoreactor with outstanding catalytic performance.

3.2. Catalytic performances
The reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP with an excess amount of NaBH4 was employed as a model reaction to test the catalytic performance of LDH-Pt. It has become one of the most useful reactions to evaluate the catalytic performance of various metal catalysts for low cost and ease of operations.37,38 Pt NPs can effectively catalyze the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP by acting as an electron relay system. As shown in Fig. 10a, after the Pt-based catalyst was added, the absorption at 400 nm significantly decreased, indicating the reduction of 4-NP. Moreover, the process could be regarded as a first-order reaction with excess amounts of NaBH4. Fig. 10b showed the linear relationship between ln(C0/Ct) and reaction time in the reaction catalyzed by different samples (Ct is the ordinate values of the absorption peak at 400 nm). According to the linear relationship, the apparent rate constant (kapp) could be obtained from the slopes of the straight lines. The kapp of the as-prepared LDH-Pt sample was 0.95 min−1. After calcination at 500 °C, the kapp of LDH-Pt reduced by 55.8 percent (0.42 min−1). The reduced catalytic performance of LDH-Pt is mainly due to the sintering of Pt NPs during calcination. As shown in Fig. 10c, the diameter of Pt NPs increased from the original 3.2 nm (Fig. 2c) to 5.65 nm. In the catalytic system, Pt NPs were encapsulated in hollow Al2O3 shells at first and the position of Pt NPs changed with the growth of LDH nanosheets. It is easy to understand that most of the Pt NPs would still be embedded in the LDH nanosheets after hydrothermal treatment, resulting in better thermal stability architecture than TLDH-Pt catalysts. As shown in Fig. 10d, in sharp contrast, the Pt NPs of TLDH-Pt are separated from the LDH sheets and sintered heavily (ca. 10.24 nm in diameter). Accordingly, after calcination at 500 °C, the kapp of TLDH-Pt decreased significantly by 72.8% from 2.41 to 0.656 min−1, resulting in a serious waste of resources. Moreover, compared with other Pt-based nanocatalysts reported in literature, the as-prepared LDH-Pt catalyst showed a higher catalytic performance than most reports in the reduction of 4-NP by NaBH4 (Table S1, ESI†).

To explain the excellent catalytic performance of LDH-Pt in the reduction of 4-NP, we propose a possible catalytic mechanism, as illustrated in Fig. 11. As observed from the EDX analysis (Fig. 7), some of the carbon species still remained in the as-synthesized catalyst, forming the Pt/C interfaces. When a metal and semiconductor are placed in contact, charge redistribution and the formation of a depletion layer surrounding the metal NPs would occur.39 Thus, electrons could leave from the residual carbon (5 eV) into the near Pt (5.65 eV) particles, resulting in an electron-enriched region. The electron-enriched region can facilitate the uptake of electrons by 4-NP molecules. Furthermore, the work function would become lower for the charge redistribution phenomenon, thus lowering the potential barrier and resulting in a higher catalytic efficiency.40
Fig. 11 Schematic of the proposed mechanism to explain the high catalytic activity of LDH-Pt for the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP.
In addition, a high temperature reaction (590 °C) of propane dehydrogenation was employed to further study the thermal stability of LDH-Pt. Fig. 12 exhibits the catalytic activity of LDH-Pt and traditional TLDH-Pt for propane dehydrogenation. It is clear that LDH-Pt shows high thermal stability and, after reaction for 7 h, the conversion decreases slightly from 16.75% to 12.74%. As for the traditional TLDH-Pt sample, contrastingly, the conversion of propane greatly decreases from 17.55% to 10.87%. Moreover, the deactivation parameter D (defined as D = [X0 − Xf] × 100%/X0, where X0 is the initial propane conversion and Xf is the final propane conversion) for these catalysts is 23.9% and 37.9%. Furthermore, the dispersion of Pt NPs over the catalyst after propane dehydrogenation experiments was also investigated by TEM analysis (Fig. S4, ESI†). It could be observed that after propane dehydrogenation experiments, the diameter of Pt NPs in LDH-Pt increased to ca. 6.71 nm. No significant sintering phenomenon of Pt NPs appeared. However, the Pt NPs in TLDH-Pt sintered heavily and the diameter of Pt NPs increased to ca. 14.63 nm. In addition, as marked in the black dashed ring in Fig. S4b (ESI†), some of the sintered Pt NPs had shed from the surface of the LDH sheets, indicating low thermal stability of TLDH-Pt. Therefore, from what has been discussed above, LDH-Pt would have great potential in various catalytic reactions for excellent thermal stability and high catalytic activity.

4. Conclusion
A hierarchical LDH-Pt nanocatalyst with enhanced thermal stability has been successfully synthesized. First, Pt NPs were loaded on the surface of NCSs and then coated with a layer of Al2O3 shell. LDH nanosheets in situ grew from the calcined hollow Pt/Al2O3 nanoclusters, eventually fabricating the hierarchical LDH-Pt nanocatalyst. Most of the Pt NPs were embedded in LDH nanosheets after the hydrothermal process, resulting in better thermal stability than that of traditional impregnated LDH-Pt catalysts. LDH-Pt exhibited high catalytic performance and enhanced thermal stability in the reduction from 4-AP to 4-NP and high temperature reaction of propane dehydrogenation, indicating that LDH-Pt would have wide applications in various fields.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
