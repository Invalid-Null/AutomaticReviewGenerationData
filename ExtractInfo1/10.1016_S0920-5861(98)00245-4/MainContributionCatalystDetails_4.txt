The provided document does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation. It discusses the effects of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of propane over supported Cr2O3 catalysts, but does not provide details on conversion, selectivity, or stability specifically for propylene production via propane dehydrogenation. The document focuses on the promoting effects of CO2 rather than on optimizing a catalyst for propane dehydrogenation to propylene.
