Studies on the promoting effect of sulfate species in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane over Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts†
The promoting effect of sulfate species in propane dehydrogenation over Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalysts is systematically elucidated by using iron(III) or iron(II) sulfate as the precursor, pre-treating with SO2 or introducing SO2 with propane as the reactant. At 560 °C, up to 23 wt% propylene yield with 80% selectivity is obtained. It is demonstrated that the introduced sulfate species exist in the form of SO42− and strongly interact with the support and Fe via the Al–O–S bond and the Fe–O–S bond. On one hand, it suppresses the formation of FexC species and thus the cracking reaction. On the other hand, it leads to an enhanced adsorption capacity of propane. Meanwhile, the initial C–H bond activation and subsequent rupture with the formation of Fe–C3H7 and OH are facilitated, resulting in excellent dehydrogenation performance. Online MS, XPS, XRD and reaction–regeneration–sulfuration results show that the loss of sulfate species by the reduction to S2− and release in the form of SO2 is the main reason for the deactivation of the sulfated catalysts.
1. Introduction
By virtue of their application in a number of important reactions including ethylbenzene dehydrogenation,1,2 oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP)3,4 and F–T synthesis,5,6 Fe-containing catalysts are amongst the most widespread catalytic systems in use today. However, despite years of intensive studies, the selectivity for propylene in ODHP remains low because of the strong side reactions such as oxidation and cracking reactions.
Compared with ODH, catalytic dehydrogenation of propane provides a more selective route to produce propylene using cheaper and abundant propane as the feedstock. Over the past few decades, most studies were focused on Cr-based7–11 and Pt-based catalysts.12–16 Although the activity and stability were greatly improved by either introducing alkali metals as the promoter or adopting new materials as the support, problems still exist, for instance, the serious environmental pollution of Cr-based catalysts and the high cost of Pt-based catalysts. Thus, developing a new cheap and environment-friendly catalytic system is of great importance.
In a previous paper,17 we reported the development of sulfated alumina-supported iron catalysts as highly active and selective catalysts for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, exhibiting propylene yield up to 20 wt% with 80% selectivity. An overview of characterization results revealed that SO42− generated from sulfation of support significantly enhanced propane dehydrogenation by enhancing the acidity of the catalyst and the adsorption capacity of propane.17 Nevertheless, aspects of the complex interaction between Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts and sulfate species, in particular the role of sulfate species in modifying the catalytic performance of Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, are still not clear.
The present work is complementary to the study of sulfated Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts and aims to gain insight into the origin of the promoting effect of sulfate species in propane dehydrogenation. First, the reaction was conducted over Fe2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalysts using iron(iii) or iron(ii) sulfate as the precursor, pre-treating with SO2 or introducing SO2 with propane in the reactant. Subsequently, the effects of sulfate addition on the structure, reducibility, acidity and adsorption–desorption behavior were discussed. Finally, a model was presented to interpret the promoting effect involving the build-up of sulfate species; the corresponding reaction route over untreated and sulfated Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts was also proposed. Based on these results, it is hopeful to develop a new catalytic system involving sulfate for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane.
2. Experimental
2.1 Catalyst preparation
In our experiments, Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts (20 wt% loading of Fe2O3) were prepared by wet impregnation using iron nitrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, 99.9% purity), iron(iii) sulfate (Fe2(SO4)3, 99.9% purity) and iron(ii) sulfate (FeSO4·7H2O, 99.9% purity) as the precursor. After that, they were dried at 120 °C for 4 hours and calcined at 700 °C for 2 h. The obtained samples were denoted as 20FeAl–N, 20FeAl–SA(iii), and 20FeAl–SA(ii), respectively.
2.2 Catalyst characterization
XRD patterns were obtained on a Rigaku D/Max RB diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 40 mA using Cu Kα radiation with a scanning speed of 10° min−1.
FT-IR spectra were determined on a Nicolet Nexus Fourier transform instrument. The background spectrum and the infrared spectrum of chemisorbed pyridine were recorded at 200 °C.
XPS studies were conducted using an ESCALab 250 electron spectrometer from Thermo Scientific Corporation with monochromatic 150 W Al Kα radiation. The binding energy measurement was referenced to Al (2p) at 74.7 eV.
The temperature-programmed reduction experiment (H2-TPR) was carried out using the following procedure: 0.1 g of the catalyst of 0.3–0.9 mm diameter was heated under helium flow (30 mL min−1) from room temperature to 200 °C and maintained for 1 h. After cooling down to 80 °C, the gas was switched to 10 vol% H2/N2 (30 mL min−1) until the TCD signal was stable. Then the temperature was increased from 80 °C to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
The SO2 adsorption experiment of 20FeAl–N was performed using a DTU-2A differential thermogravimetric analyzer. Temperature was first raised from 20 °C to the investigated temperature (450, 560, 600 °C) at a rate of 10 °C min−1 under high-purity nitrogen. Then SO2 was introduced at a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 for 90 min. Besides, the experiments over pure Al2O3 and Fe2O3 were also carried out at 700 °C.
The C3H8 pulse adsorption–desorption experiment was carried out using the chemical adsorption apparatus with online MS analysis of effluent using the following procedure. First, 0.1 g of the catalyst of 0.3–0.9 mm diameter was heated under helium flow (60 mL min−1) from room temperature to 450 °C and maintained for 2 h to remove the adsorbed water, and then cooled down to 150 °C. The MS signals of Ar (40), C3H8 (29) and He (4) were recorded until constant. After that, the four-way valve was switched from He to Ar and C3H8 with the same flow rate (30 mL min−1), and after the signals no longer changed, switched to He again until the signal no longer changed, then switched to Ar and C3H8 and so forth. The same experiments were also conducted at 250 °C, 350 °C and 450 °C. For data processing, we selected one pulse, fixed the length of time, obtained the relative time value by taking the starting time as the base (labeled as 0), and then normalized the signal of Ar and C3H8 using the formula , and finally, plotted the normalized value of the intensity of Ar and C3H8 as the relative time. The area of the hysteresis loop represents the adsorbed capacity of propane. Online MS analysis was conducted on the same apparatus, and the mass numbers of 18, 34, 64, and 43 were detected for H2O, H2S, SO2 and C3H8, respectively.
2.3 Catalyst test
Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane was performed in a fixed-bed reactor (14 mm in diameter) at 560 °C and under atmospheric pressure. In each experiment, 2 g of catalysts with the particle size of 0.088–0.180 mm were loaded in the middle of the reactor. Prior to reaction, the catalysts were pre-treated with nitrogen to remove adsorbed water. Then the reactant consisting of 99 wt% propane was introduced into the reactor at a flow rate of 12 mL min−1. The product was analyzed by Bruker GC-450 chromatography.
The influence of SO2 pre-treatment was investigated using the following procedure. The catalysts were firstly heated to the investigated temperatures (450 °C, 560 °C, 600 °C) in a nitrogen atmosphere. Then 5 vol% SO2/N2 at a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 was introduced for 2 h. After that, it was switched to nitrogen and the reactor was purged for 0.5 h to remove the residual SO2. The effect of SO2 was also studied by introducing 5 vol% SO2/N2 at a flow rate of 10 mL min−1 with propane as the reactant, that is, the reactant consists of N2, SO2 and C3H8 at a molar ratio of 19 : 1 : 24. The dehydrogenation performance of all catalysts was evaluated under the same reaction conditions: T = 560 °C, P = 1 atm, FC3H8 = 12 mL min−1.
The reaction–regeneration cycles over 20FeAl–SA(ii) were performed using the chemical adsorption apparatus with online analysis of the product using the following procedure. 0.1 g of the catalyst with a particle size of 0.3–0.9 mm was firstly heated to 560 °C at a heating ramp of 10 °C min−1 under helium flow (30 mL min−1). The reactant was introduced at a flow rate of 12 mL min−1 for 20 min, and then switched to air (30 mL min−1); the temperature was raised to 700 °C at a heating ramp of about 30 °C min−1 and maintained for 15 min. After that, the temperature was cooled to 560 °C min−1 under helium flow within 10 minutes. The reactant was introduced and another cycle was carried out following the above steps. The m/z ratios of 18, 34, 64, 44, 43 and 41 were used to analyze H2O, H2S, SO2, CO2, C3H8 and C3H6, respectively.
The reaction–regeneration cycles over 20FeAl-560-SO2 (2 g of the catalyst) were carried out as below: reaction at 560 °C for 6 h in the reactor, then regeneration under air at 700 °C in the muffle furnace for 1 h (the heating ramp is 30 °C min−1). After that, the catalyst was treated with SO2 at a flow rate of 30 mL min−1 in the reactor for 2 h, and then the reactant was introduced for another 6 h at a flow rate of 12 mL min−1 and so forth.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Effect of precursors
To our knowledge, most of the Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts studied so far have been prepared by impregnation of Al2O3 with iron nitrate as the precursor. In this section, iron(iii) and iron(ii) sulfate were also adopted as the precursor and their performance in propane dehydrogenation was studied at 560 °C (Fig. 1). For 20FeAl–N, propylene was the main product in the initial stage. Subsequently, propane conversion along with methane yield increased dramatically with TOS. After 1 h, most of the propane was converted to methane without the formation of propylene, suggesting a transformation from dehydrogenation reaction to cracking reaction. Besides, a certain amount of COx oxidation products was detected (Fig. S1†) due to the oxidation of iron oxide by oxygen species, which is consistent with a previous study.18 With extended reaction time, the oxygen species were fast consumed as evidenced by the dramatically decreased amount of COx (Fig. S1†). To exclude the contribution of homogeneous gas phase reactions on the formation of methane, a blank experiment (without catalyst) and the reaction over pure Al2O3 were also carried out (Table S1†). Under the reaction conditions, only around 1.0 wt% propane conversion and 0.1 wt% methane yield were obtained, demonstrating that the formation of methane is caused by the activation of the catalyst.
Fig. 1 Reaction results over (a) 20FeAl–SA(iii), (b) 20FeAl–N, and (c) 20FeAl–SA(ii): (■) propane conversion; (●) propylene yield; (▲) methane yield; (▼) COx yield (reaction conditions: T = 560 °C, P = 1 atm, FC3H8 = 12 mL min−1).
In comparison, 20FeAl–SA(iii) and 20FeAl–SA(ii) showed completely different catalytic behaviors in propane dehydrogenation. Propylene was the main product with much higher yield and selectivity. Moreover, a higher amount of COx was observed, especially for 20FeAl–SA(ii); 20 wt% COx yield (mainly CO2) at an overall conversion of 42 wt% was obtained at TOS = 15 min. After that, the yield of COx decreased dramatically. In addition to COx, methane was another main product other than propylene in the initial stage of the reaction. Since no oxidant was introduced during the reaction, it was speculated that surface oxygen species made a great contribution to the formation of COx and methane. Combined with the “induction period” of propylene yield over 20FeAl–SA(iii) and 20FeAl–SA(ii), it seems to suggest that iron species with a low oxidation number play an important role in the dehydrogenation reaction.
In the above experiments, it is found that the 20FeAl–N catalyst produces abundant methane instead of propylene as the reaction proceeds, which is probably caused by the changes in iron species under the reducing dehydrogenation environment. To obtain more information about the changes in the iron phase during the reaction, XRD characterization of 20FeAl–N reacted for 2 h, which showed high cracking activity and yielded the most methane, was conducted and is shown in Fig. 2. After reaction for 2 h, characteristic peaks of Fe2O3 disappeared, while that of metallic Fe or FexC appeared, which are supposed to be active for C–C scission, especially through propane hydrogenolysis reaction.19 Since the resolution of the XRD diffraction peaks is rather poor, XPS characterization of reacted 20FeAl–N was conducted (Fig. 5). After reaction for 2 h, the Fe 2p3/2 peak at around 708.5 eV indicative of FexC species appeared. Therefore, it is deduced that the FexC species generated during the course of the reaction facilitate the undesirable cracking reaction and hence the formation of methane. Compared with 20FeAl–N, only diffraction lines of FeS were detected for sulfated catalysts after reaction (Fig. 2), and the longer the reaction time, the stronger the intensity of FeS, as evidenced by the S 2p peak located at around 162 eV (Fig. 8). Thus, the cracking reaction was greatly inhibited.

Moreover, propylene yield and selectivity increased dramatically with iron(iii) and iron(ii) sulfate as the precursor. One possible explanation would be the formation of sulfate. Nevertheless, all of the catalysts only exhibited diffraction lines of Fe2O3 without any peak corresponding to iron sulfate or aluminium sulfate (Fig. 2), indicating that under the high calcination temperature (700 °C), iron(iii) and iron(ii) sulfate were completely decomposed to Fe2O3 with the release of sulfur oxides following the reactions:
2FeSO4 → Fe2O3 + SO2 + SO3 (1)
Fe2(SO4)3 → Fe2O3 + 3SO3 (2)
However, according to the literature,20,21 SO2 and SO3 can adsorb on the surface of γ-Al2O3 and Fe2O3, giving rise to S–O–Al and S–O–Fe groups. To verify the speculation, SO2 adsorption experiment was conducted and the results are tabulated in Table S2.† It is obvious that apart from γ-Al2O3, Fe2O3 is also active in adsorbing SO2 with a 2.8 wt% weight gain rate at 700 °C. This can be attributed to the strong electron affinity of surface-adsorbed oxygen (O−) and lattice oxygen (O2−) of Fe2O3, which makes it easy for SO2 to adsorb on the surface or form a complex. Furthermore, the IR spectra of 20FeAl–SA(iii) and 20FeAl–SA(ii) were characterized and are shown in Fig. S2.† The appearance of two obvious absorption bands at around 1390 and 1090 cm−1 confirms the formation of aluminum sulfate.20 In addition, four absorption bands at 1190–1170, 1110–1130, 1035–1030, and 990 cm−1, assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric frequencies of S–O bonds in SO42− that coordinates to one or two iron ions through its oxygen, were observed.21 Based on these results, it is concluded that the generated SOx further adsorbs on both alumina and Fe2O3, causing the formation of stable SO42− species, which are supposed to contribute to the improved catalytic performance.
According to the above results, it is speculated that the reduction of Fe2O3 to FexC species is greatly inhibited in the presence of sulfate species. To verify the above speculation, H2-TPR characterization was performed and is displayed in Fig. S3,† and the areas of reduction peaks for the catalysts quantified by peak deconvolution are listed in Table S3.† As for 20FeAl–N, three reduction peaks attributed to the reduction of surface-adsorbed oxygen species and the reduction processes of Fe2O3 → Fe3O4 and Fe3O4 → FeO + Fe22–25 were observed. The shape of TPR patterns for 20FeAl–SA(iii) and 20FeAl–SA(ii) was very similar. However, peak 2 at around 450 °C showed a much larger area, while peak 3 shifted to lower temperature (from 620 °C to 550 °C) with a smaller area. It is worth noting that a shoulder peak (peak 2′) at about 400 °C was observed for 20FeAl-560-SO2, which was ascribed to the reduction of sulfate species.26,27 Therefore, it is concluded that a larger amount of Fe3+ is much easier to reduce to Fe2+. Meanwhile, with the reduction of SO42− to S2−, FeS was produced at the expense of FexC species; thus the generation of abundant methane was inhibited.
On the basis of the above results, it is believed that iron(iii) and iron(ii) sulfate are decomposed to Fe2O3 with the retention of sulfate species in the process of calcination, which suppresses the reduction of iron oxide to FexC species and consequently the cracking reaction. Furthermore, the dehydrogenation reaction is greatly improved.
3.2 Effect of SO2 pretreatment and introduction in the reactant
To confirm the promoting effect of sulfate species in propane dehydrogenation, 20FeAl–N was pre-treated with SO2 before reaction under different temperatures (450 °C, 560 °C, 600 °C) as described in section 2.3; the obtained samples were referred to as 20FeAl-x-SO2 (x represents the treating temperature) and were used to carry out propane dehydrogenation (Fig. 3). Likewise, SO2 pretreatment dramatically inhibited the formation of methane, and the lower the temperature, the higher the dehydrogenation activity. With increasing reaction time, propane conversion and propylene yield all decreased with a diminishing content of SO2 in the product, which is consistent with the aforementioned results.
Fig. 3 Effect of SO2 pre-treatment temperature on propane conversion (a) and propylene yield (b) over the 20FeAl–N catalyst: (■) 450 °C, (●) 560 °C, (▲) 600 °C (reaction conditions: T = 560 °C, P = 1 atm, FC3H8 = 12 mL min−1).
Among studies on propane dehydrogenation published up to now, the effect of sulfate species has not been clearly defined. In a previous paper,28 Wang et al. found that addition of sulfate species improved the performance of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in ethane dehydrogenation and attributed the increased activity to enhanced acidity. In this regard, the present results are in perfect agreement. As shown in Fig. S4,† the FT-IR spectrum of 20FeAl–N only exhibited an adsorption band at 1450 cm−1 attributed to the chemisorption of pyridine on Lewis acid sites.29–32 The introduction of sulfate species led to the formation of Brønsted acid sites. Therefore, it is deduced that the strengthened acidity caused by the sulfate species is responsible for the excellent catalytic performance.
To sum up, the improved acidity and reducibility of sulfated 20FeAl catalysts are considered to be related to the existence of sulfate species.17 Due to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of the sulfate ion, the neighboring iron ion is more electropositive, in which case the Fe–O–S bond is strengthened.33,34 On the other hand, the strong interaction between iron cations and oxygen species frees a hydrogen proton of the coordinated water, which generates Brønsted acid sites35 and enhances the dehydrogenation activity.
To further authenticate the important role of sulfate species in propane dehydrogenation, 5 vol% SO2/N2 was introduced with C3H8 as the reactant with an N2 : SO2 : O2 : C3H8 molar ratio of 19 : 1 : 30 (Fig. 4). During the investigated 14 h, most of the propane was converted into propylene with about 80% selectivity and 20 wt% yield, which can be ascribed to the formation of sulfate species caused by the strong adsorption capacity of SO2 on the catalyst. However, under the dehydrogenation atmosphere, the sulfate species were also reduced to FeS as detected by XRD (Fig. 2).
Fig. 4 Effect of SO2 introduction on the performance of the 20FeAl–N catalyst: (■) propylene yield, (●) methane yield, (▲) selectivity of propylene (reaction conditions: T = 560 °C, P = 1 atm, FC3H8 = 12 mL min−1).
All in all, the introduction of sulfate species to Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts either by using iron(iii) and iron(ii) sulfate as the precursor, pretreating with SO2 or introducing SO2 with C3H8 as the reactant significantly alters the course of reaction, turning propane dehydrogenation into the predominant reaction. In view of the excellent activity and selectivity, the greatly improved dehydrogenation performance is related to the sulfate species formed by adsorption of SOx. Detailed elaboration will be found in the following sections.
3.3 The nature of the effect of sulfate species on the catalytic performance of the Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalyst
As for heterogeneous catalytic reactions, the adsorption of reactant exerts an important impact on the catalytic behaviour. To get a deeper insight into the nature of the effect of sulfate species on the properties and catalytic performance of the Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, XPS characterization and C3H8 adsorption–desorption experiment were firstly carried out and the corresponding results are displayed in Fig. 5 and 6.
Fig. 5 Fe 2p peaks of unsulfated and sulfated Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts and 20FeAl–N reacted for 2 h.
Fig. 6 C3H8 pulse adsorption–desorption isotherms over (a) 20FeAl–N, (b) 20Fe/S–Al, (c) 20FeAl–560-SO2, and (d) 20FeAl–SA(ii).
All of the fresh samples showed the Fe 2p3/2 peak between 710.6 and 711.5 eV with its associated 3d → 4s satellite peak at 718.7 eV, indicating that Fe species are characteristic of Fe3+ in Fe2O3 as proved by the spin–orbital splitting of around 13.5 eV between Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 peaks.36–38 After sulfate addition, the band position shifted to higher binding energy, which can be ascribed to the strong electron-withdrawing ability of sulfate species, causing an electron transfer from Fe to S and the formation of Fe species at the electron-deficient state.
In the process of propane dehydrogenation, it is widely accepted that the initial adsorption of propane on the active sites and subsequent rupture of the C–H bond play the key role in the formation of propylene.39–42 In view of the significantly meliorated catalytic performance, C3H8 pulse adsorption–desorption was carried out as described in section 2.2 and the results were depicted in Fig. 6. Compared with 20FeAl–N, the adsorption capacity of propane (proportional to the area of the hysteresis loop) increased dramatically for sulfated catalysts. Since the secondary carbon of propane has 0.051 negative charge, it is more likely to adsorb, which is in favor of the reaction.43
From the foregoing results, it can be concluded that sulfate addition to Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts improves the electronic properties, leading to enhanced acidity and adsorption capacity of propane. According to the results in section 3.1, SOx can adsorb on both Al2O3 and Fe2O3, resulting in the generation of sulfate species. To get more knowledge about the nature of the effect of sulfate species, the reaction was carried out over 20FeSi–SA(ii) and 20FeZr–SA(ii) catalysts under the same reaction conditions and pure Al2O3 in the reactant, consisting of N2, SO2 and C3H8 at a molar ratio of 19 : 1 : 30 (Fig. S5†). Both activity and stability decreased dramatically with SiO2 and ZrO2 as the support, especially over 20FeSi–SA(ii); only 6.1 wt% propylene yield was achieved, proving the important role of Al2O3. However, pure Al2O3 exhibited much lower activity (about 4 wt% propylene yield), suggesting that the existence of Fe2O3 is indispensable for the improved catalytic performance.
Based on the above results, it is inferred that in spite of low reactivity, the presence of alumina support enhances the adsorption capacity of SOx, hence the formation and reservation of sulfate species, which contributes to the higher stability. This was further verified by the higher binding energy of Al 2p spectra of sulfated catalysts (Fig. S6†), which indicates an electron transfer from Al to S in the structure of Al–O–S groups. Therefore, we put forward a model for the promoting effect of sulfate species in a manner similar to that proposed by Choudhary and Rane44 for methane activation over oxide catalysts and that proposed by Burch et al.45,46 for propane activation over Pt/Al2O3 catalysts (Scheme 1). In this model, the alumina support facilitates the formation of the electronegative sulfate groups, which are believed to be involved in the reaction. When propane is adsorbed on the catalyst, H atoms are abstracted from propane by its polarization followed by C–H bond rupture to form C3H7+ and H−, which will interact with FeLCδ+ and Oδ− (LC denotes low coordination), respectively. According to this mechanism, the lower coordinated Fe sites are in favor of propane dehydrogenation, agreeing with the observed “induction period” for propylene yield over sulfated catalysts.
Scheme 1 Proposed model for the promoting effect of sulfate species on propane dehydrogenation over Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts.
In order to further validate the promoting effect of sulfate species, SO2 was introduced likewise to the 20FeAl–N catalyst after reaction for 3 h, which showed high cracking activity (Fig. S7†). Similarly, both introducing SO2 with propane in the reactant and treating with SO2 brought about much higher yield and selectivity for propylene. During the first 1 h of the introduction of SO2, methane was still the main product, and after 3 h, the yield of propylene increased from 3 wt% to 25 wt%. After treating with SO2, propane became the dominant product with yield up to 23 wt%. Besides, FeS was detected after reaction (Fig. 2), suggesting that SO2 can also directly interact with FexC species, leading to the formation of sulfate species and thus promoting dehydrogenation reaction.
On the basis of the above results and discussions, the course of the reaction over unsulfated and sulfated 20FeAl catalysts is proposed and depicted in Scheme 2. In the absence of sulfate species, propane is first dehydrogenated to propylene over iron oxide. Simultaneously, Fe2O3 is reduced to FexC species which constitute the active sites for cracking reaction (Route I), resulting in the formation of abundant methane. When sulfate species are introduced either from the beginning of the reaction or after reaction with the formation of a large amount of methane, they strongly interact with the support and Fen+via the Al–O–S bond and the Fe–O–S bond. In this model, the initial C–H bond activation and subsequent rupture are facilitated due to the modified electronic properties caused by the strong electron-withdrawing ability of SO42−. In addition, the generation of FexC species is suppressed due to the formation of FeS, thus inhibiting cracking reaction. Nevertheless, concerning the essence of the dramatically improved catalytic behavior by sulfate species, detailed work about the adsorption state and the possible adsorbed intermediate species still needs to be carried out.

3.4 Origin of catalyst deactivation
Although the buildup of sulfate species dramatically improves the performance of Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, the activity gradually declines with prolonged reaction time. As indicated in Fig. 2, FeS was generated at the expense of Fe2O3 after reaction for sulfated catalysts, and the longer the reaction time, the stronger the intensity of diffraction lines of FeS, suggesting a reduction process of Fe3+ and SO42−, which is supposed to be responsible for the catalyst deactivation.
Fig. 7 exhibits the MS spectra from the reaction–regeneration experiment (as described in section 2.3) over the 20FeAl–SA(ii) catalyst. Within the investigated cycles, SO2 and H2S (with a much weaker intensity) were detected at the same time, which was ascribed to the reduction of sulfate groups.47 As the number of cycles increased, the concentration of SO2, H2S and H2O declined dramatically while that of C3H8 showed an increasing trend, all of which point to the fact that sulfate groups are reduced and released in the form of SO2 during the reaction, constituting the reason for the deactivation of the catalyst. In addition, an increasing amount of CO2 (Fig. S8†) was detected during the process of regeneration, suggesting that with the consumption of sulfate species, more and more carbon deposition was generated, which also contributes to the declined dehydrogenation activity.
Fig. 7 MS spectra from the reaction–regeneration cycles over the 20FeAl–SA(ii) catalyst.
To get more information about the nature and number of sulfur species, S 2p spectra of fresh and reacted sulfated catalysts were characterized and depicted in Fig. 8. The samples pre-treated with SO2 or adopted iron(ii) sulfate as the precursor exhibited an S 2p peak located at 169.8 eV assigned to the S–O bond in SO42−,36 which is in good accordance with IR results in Fig. S2.† After reaction for 3 h, 20FeAl–SA(ii) showed two peaks at around 168.5 eV and 162.4 eV, which are attributed to SO32− and S2− in FeS, respectively. After 24 h, the percentage area of S2− further increased (Table S4†), verifying the reduction process of SO42− to S2− during the course of the reaction. Similar results were found over 20FeAl–SA(iii) and 20FeAl-560-SO2 after reaction. Combining with the results in section 3.3, it is concluded that both sulfate groups and iron species play an important role in the reaction. The loss of sulfate groups in the form of SO2 and the reduction to FeS are the main reasons for the deactivation of sulfated catalysts.
Fig. 8 S 2p spectra of (a) 20FeAl-560-SO2, (b) 20FeAl–SA(ii), (c) 20FeAl–SA(ii) after reaction for 3 h, (d) 20FeAl–SA(ii) after reaction for 24 h, (e) 20FeAl–SA(iii) after reaction for 24 h, and (f) 20FeAl-560-SO2 after reaction for 6 h.
In order to recover the activity, 20FeAl–N was treated with SO2 for another 2 h after every 6 h of reaction; a total of four such reaction–regeneration–sulfuration cycles were carried out. As shown in Fig. S9,† the activity was largely restored after the sulfuration treatment, further demonstrating that the existence of sulfate species is essential to the excellent dehydrogenation performance and their loss causes the deactivation of the catalyst.
As far as we know, the best catalysts in propane dehydrogenation were commercial Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts, e.g., 44% propylene yield with 87% selectivity was obtained at 650 °C and 0.05 MPa over Cr-based catalysts, while 40% propylene yield with 84% selectivity was obtained at 525 °C and 0.2 MPa over Pt-based catalysts. Although the activity of sulfated catalysts is lower (23 wt% propylene yield with 80% selectivity), it is more environment friendly compared with Cr-based catalysts and cheaper than Pt-based catalysts.
Besides, it is widely accepted that with an increased number of regeneration reactions, the entrapment and migration of Cr species into the support42,48 and the sintering of Pt particles49,50 cause the irreversible deactivation of the catalysts. In comparison, the activity of the catalyst can be largely recovered after regeneration and sulfuration treatment (Fig. S9†). What is more, as tabulated in Table S5,† despite the surface area of 20FeAl-560-SO2 being diminished after reaction, e.g., decreased from 149.1 m2 g−1 to 140.8 m2 g−1 and 136.9 m2 g−1 after reaction in the first and fourth cycles, it increased to 145.8 m2 g−1 and 142.2 m2 g−1 again after regeneration. Similar results were found over 20FeAl–SA(ii). XRD results also showed that after the fourth regeneration, Fe2O3 with a slightly reduced intensity was observed over 20FeAl-560-SO2, all of which suggested that the sulfated iron catalysts have a more stable structure, making them a kind of promising catalytic system for catalytic dehydrogenation of propane.
4. Conclusions
The promoting effect of sulfate species on the performance of the Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalyst in propane dehydrogenation was studied by using iron(ii) or iron(iii) sulfate as the precursor, pre-treating with SO2, introducing SO2 with propane in the reactant either from the beginning of the reaction or during the reaction when most of the propane was converted into methane. In the presence of sulfate species, propane dehydrogenation becomes the dominant reaction with propylene yield up to above 20 wt% and selectivity to 80%.
It is found that on one hand, sulfate addition inhibits the formation of FexC species during the course of reaction, hence inhibiting cracking reaction and the formation of methane. On the other hand, the introduced sulfate species exist in the form of SO42− and interact strongly with the support and Fe species via Al–O–S and Fe–O–S bonds, in which structure the initial C–H bond activation and rupture are facilitated by the electronegative sulfate sites and iron species at a low coordination number, all of which are beneficial for the formation of propylene.
Concerning the catalyst deactivation, online MS, XPS and XRD results show that the loss of sulfate species caused by the reduction to S2− or release in the form of SO2 is the main reason for the deactivation. After sulfuration treatment with SO2 of the regenerated catalyst, the activity could be largely restored, verifying the key role of sulfate species in the significantly improved dehydrogenation performance.
