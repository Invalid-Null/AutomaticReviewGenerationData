The given document discusses the use of gallium-based catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation, not specifically propane dehydrogenation. While propane is mentioned as an example alkane feed, the document focuses on fundamental understanding of the gallium active site rather than improvements in propane dehydrogenation performance. Therefore, this document is not directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation to propylene.
