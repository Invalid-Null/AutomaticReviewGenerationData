Iron doping boosts the reactivity and stability of the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet supported cobalt catalyst for propane dehydrogenation†
Supported cobalt catalysts are a promising but immature alternative for the noble metallic platinum and poisonous chromium oxide catalysts widely used in the industrial process of propane dehydrogenation. There is still a large amount of scope to modulate its geometric and electronic structure to optimize its catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation. In this work, we report that iron doping efficiently promotes the generation of active tetrahedral Co2+ species in cobalt tetroxide supported on the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet, as disclosed by multiple analytical techniques involving X-ray powder diffraction, UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction. In the propane dehydrogenation reaction, such a system presents an enhancement on the activity and selectivity compared with its cobalt only catalyst counterpart. The optimal loading amounts of cobalt and iron were identified to be 5 wt% and 1.6 wt%, respectively. Structural analysis reveals that a strong interaction of iron with the oxygen ligand weakens the π domination of oxygen into the adjacent cobalt centre, accordingly promoting the catalytic activity and selectivity of cobalt in propane dehydrogenation. An increase in the anti-reductive capability triggered by iron doping evidently improves the durability of such a catalyst in propane dehydrogenation. It's also noted that the surface coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ sites of the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet synergistically boost the dehydrogenation activity of the cobalt catalyst. This research provides a new strategy for improving the reactivity and stability of the cobalt catalyst in the field of alkane dehydrogenation.
1. Introduction
Propylene, a key industrial feedstock for the production of polymers, oxygenates and other compounds, is mainly produced from thermal or catalytic cracking of crude oil-derived naphtha. Propane dehydrogenation is another important industrial route for on-purpose production of propylene, effectively relieving the overdependence of propylene raw materials on limited oil reserves.1,2 The recent boom in the shale gas production has once again promoted the development of propane dehydrogenation process based on metallic platinum and chromium oxide catalysts.3–6 However, platinum resources are very rare in nature and chromium is highly toxic in the environment, thus looking for more cost-effective and environment-friendly catalysts is always a research hotspot in this field.7–12
Among the various alternative catalysts, the cobalt-based catalyst has attracted extensive attention because of its great ability to activate C–H bonds and it is non-noble and low-toxic character.13,14 Current studies show that tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species dispersed on silica and alumina are active and selective in propane dehydrogenation;15–17 larger sized species including CoOx clusters and Co3O4 particles show a better activating ability for propane, but loses the selectivity of propylene.18,19 Thereby, there is an urgent need to modulate the local structure of the cobalt species for optimizing the activity and selectivity of the cobalt catalyst. On the other hand, propane dehydrogenation needs high temperature, typically 600 °C, and is in a strongly reducing atmosphere; under such conditions, the highly dispersed cobalt species preferentially aggregate and reduce to metallic phases,20 which exacerbates the formation of coke deposit and leads to the rapid deactivation of the catalyst. Thus, developing a new strategy is still highly desirable to improve the stability of the cobalt catalyst in propane dehydrogenation.
In this study, we report that iron doping efficiently promotes the generation and stabilization of tetrahedral Co2+ species on the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet supported cobalt tetroxide catalyst, which exhibits more superior reactivity and stability in propane dehydrogenation compared with the cobalt only catalyst counterpart. The interaction between cobalt species and iron species is carefully discussed by combining structural characterization and catalytic evaluation. Furthermore, we reveal that the coordinatively unsaturated Al sites together with the neighboring lattice oxygen on the surface of the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet synergistically boost the dehydrogenating activity of the cobalt catalyst.
2. Experimental
2.1 Catalyst preparation
Initially, the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet was synthesized as a support using a hydrothermal method according to our previous work.21 Typically, 6.4 g of aluminum nitrate (AR. Al(NO3)3·6H2O) and 9.3 g of urea (AR. CO(NH2)2) were dissolved in 100 mL deionized water under magnetic stirring for 25 minutes. The solution with a pH of ∼3.8 was transferred into a 180 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave, and hydrothermally treated for 48 h in an oven at 100 °C. After filtration and drying, the samples were calcined at 600 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1 in static air.
A series of cobalt or/and iron catalysts supported on the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet were prepared using an incipient co-impregnation method using cobalt nitrate (AR. Co(NO3)2·6H2O) and iron nitrate (AR. Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) as the metal precursors. In a representative catalyst (marked as 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3), the theoretical amounts of Co and Fe loaded were 5 wt% and 1.6 wt%, respectively. Typical procedures were as follows: 247.0 mg of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and 115.8 mg of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were diluted in 500 µL of deionized water. Subsequently, the solution containing the two metal precursors was incipiently impregnated into 1.0 g of the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet support and held at room temperature for 2 h and then dried at 50 °C for 12 h. Finally, the obtained powders were calcined in static air at 600 °C for 2 h and treated in a N2 (99.99%) atmosphere at 590 °C for 0.5 h to ensure a clean catalyst surface.
In addition, the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet supported CoMn and CoCu catalysts were prepared using the same method as that for preparing the CoFe/Al2O3 catalyst. Typically, 52.1 mg of Mn(NO3)3 and 61.6 mg of Cu(NO3)2·6H2O were added to 500 µL of aqueous solution containing 247.0 mg of Co(NO3)2·6H2O as the impregnating solution for preparing 5Co1.6Mn and 5Co1.6Cu catalysts, respectively. For comparison, a γ-Al2O3 counterpart, named as Al2O3-com, was prepared by calcining the Pseudo Bohemite (Haitai Science and Technology Co., Ltd) at 600 °C for 2 hours. The supported CoFe catalyst (5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3-com) was further prepared using the same procedure as that for preparing the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst.
2.2 Catalyst characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured using a Panalytical X’pert Pro Super X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 40 mA, λ = 0.15418 nm). A Micromeritics TriStar 3000 adsorption analyzer was used to measure nitrogen-sorption isotherms. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy were recorded using a FEI TECNAI F30 microscope, operating at a voltage of 300 kV.
Magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) experiments were carried out using a 4 mm MAS NMR probe with an Agilent DD2-500 MHz spectrometer. UV-vis diffuse reflection spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) was carried out using an Agilent Cary 5000 UV-vis spectrophotometer with a diffuse reflectance integration sphere attachment (Internal DRA 2500). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were obtained using a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB instrument equipped with an Al Kα X-ray source. All spectra of the element were calibrated using an Al 2p signal at a binding energy of 74.6 eV.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a NETZSCH STA 449 F3 analyzer. Prior to combustion, the catalyst was pre-treated with flowing He at 200 °C for 1 h, and then oxidized in 20%O2/N2. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) experiments were carried out using a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 apparatus, and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) connected with a Mass Spectrometer (MS) was used to quantitate the desorbed H2 or NH3.
2.3 Catalytic test of propane dehydrogenation
Propane dehydrogenation was tested in a quartz-tube (I. D. = 8 mm), packed-bed reactor at atmospheric pressure. Typically, 0.1 g of the catalyst (80–100 mesh) was used in each experiment, in which the height of the catalyst bed is almost 8 mm. The catalyst was pre-treated at 590 °C for 0.5 h in N2 prior to the reaction. A reaction gas mixture with a volume ratio of C3H8 : N2 = 4 : 21 at a total flow rate of 25 mL min−1 was passed through the catalyst bed at 590 °C. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane (99.95% purity) were calculated to be 2400 mL gcat−1 h−1 and 4.7 g gcat−1 h−1, respectively.
The reactants and products were analyzed using a gas chromatograph, which was equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The GDX-105 column combined with FID were used to analyze C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, C2H6, and CH4. The N2 and H2 were analyzed by TCD. The propane conversion and selectivity of the products were calculated based on moles of carbon in the products, using the following equations:
Conversion (%) = {[(Fin(C3H8) − Fout(C3H8))/Fin(C3H8)]} × 100
Selectivity (%) = [(ni/3) × (Fout(i))]/Σi[(ni/3) × (Fout(i))] × 100
where i represents hydrocarbon products in the effluent gas stream, ni is the number of carbon atoms of component i, and F(i) is the corresponding flow rate. The carbon balance was checked by comparing the number of moles of carbon in the outlet stream to the number of moles of carbon in the feed. In order to account for the volume expansion in the reaction, nitrogen was used as the internal standard. For the catalyst regeneration in the recycling tests, the used catalyst was oxidized in 48 mL min−1 of 20% O2/N2 at 600 °C for 1 h, and then purged in 21 mL min−1 of N2 for 1 h at 590 °C.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Effect of iron doping on the structure of the cobalt catalyst
The XRD patterns of the support and a series of supported cobalt-based catalysts are displayed in Fig. 1. The support showed two strong diffraction peaks at 45.9° and 67.0° that could be well-indexed to the γ-Al2O3 phase (ICOD:00-001-1308). Absence of the diffraction peaks at 39.5°, 37.6° and 60.9°, respectively, corresponding to the (222), (311) and (511) planes of γ-Al2O3, indicates a high degree of Al3+ disorder.21,22 The 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy further confirmed that the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet support synthesized in this work contained a large percentage (28.6%) of coordinated unsaturated Al3+ sites (Fig. S1, ESI†). The nitrogen sorption measurement indicated that the adsorption–desorption isotherm (Fig. 2a) was of type IV with hysteresis loops at P/P0 = 0.4–0.8, indicating the presence of a mesoporous structure in such a γ-Al2O3 support. The pore size distribution (Fig. 2b), determined using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method, showed that the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet had a narrow mesopore size distribution centered at 6.7 nm.

After loading cobalt until reaching 5 wt%, the obtained sample exhibited a smaller surface area (Table 1, 159 m2 g−1) and pore volume (0.22 cm3 g−1) than that of the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet (214 m2 g−1 and 0.36 cm3 g−1, accordingly). The isotherm hysteresis loops exhibited a shift to a higher pressure region (P/P0 = 0.6–0.9, Fig. 2a), indicative of the presence of larger mesopores after cobalt loading (Fig. 2b). In addition, as shown in the XRD pattern, several weak diffraction peaks appeared at 31.4°, 37.0°, 45.0°, 59.6°, and 65.5° after loading of 5 wt% cobalt, which are characteristic of the Co3O4 phase (ICOD: 03-065-3103). The sample also showed a green color, implying the presence of Co3O4 species.23 Based on the (311) diffraction peak, the grain size was evaluated to be 5 nm. These findings suggest that the presenting state of the cobalt species was the highly-dispersed Co3O4 nanoparticle. Further increasing the cobalt loading to 10 wt%, resulted in the shape of the diffraction peaks (Fig. 1a) became sharp, indicating the formation of large-sized and well-crystallized Co3O4 particles at this loading.

Based on the 5Co/Al2O3 catalyst, the iron was further doped. From the XRD pattern (Fig. 1b), several Fe-doping catalysts with an iron amount from 0.5 to 2.4 wt% almost exhibited similar diffraction peaks to those of 5Co/Al2O3, and no diffraction peaks assigned to iron species (Fig. 1b) were observed. Taking as an example the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst, the grain size was evaluated to be 5 nm, which is similar to that of the 5Co/Al2O3 catalyst. The TEM images (Fig. 3a) of such a catalyst further confirmed that small nanoparticles with sizes in the range of 5–10 nm were highly dispersed on the surface of the Al2O3 support. Unfortunately, a high-resolution imaging experiment (Fig. 3b) cannot acquire clear lattice fringes of the Co3O4 nanoparticle, probably related to similar contrast between the cobalt and aluminum ions.

The changes in structure parameters were compared between the 5Co/Al2O3 and 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalysts. As listed in Table 1, there was a decrease either in the surface area or in the pore volume after iron doping. We also evaluated the cobalt dispersion over both 5Co/Al2O3 and 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalysts based on semi-quantitative XPS compositional analysis (Table 1). The surface Co/Al ratio over the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst was slightly lower than that over the 5Co/Al2O3 catalyst. Considering the decrease in the surface area after iron doping, these results suggested that the doping of iron did not alter the exposed degree of cobalt species in the surface of the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet support. Moreover, HAADF-STEM imaging combined with EDX element-mapping analysis was performed to reveal the spatial distribution of cobalt and iron species in the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 3c and d). As shown in Fig. 3d, the intensity signals of cobalt and iron on the Al2O3 surface follow a similar distribution in the space, suggesting a relatively homogeneous distribution on the nano-scale of the two components.
3.2 Effect of iron doping on local coordination of cobalt species
To obtain more insights into the local structure of cobalt species, we further characterized the catalyst using the UV-vis DRS spectroscopy that was sensitive to the coordinated environment of cobalt. Fig. 4a gave the UV-vis DRS spectra of both the 5Co/Al2O3 and 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalysts. For comparison, the UV-vis DRS spectra of Co3O4 and 1.6Fe/Al2O3 samples are shown in Fig. 4b. Bulk Co3O4 exhibited two charge transfer (CT) bands at 360 nm and 700 nm (Fig. 4b) that were attributed to tetrahedral Co2+ species and octahedral Co3+ species, respectively.24,25 For the 5Co/Al2O3 catalyst, apart from an obvious CT band at 390 nm, corresponding to octahedral Co3+ species in Co3O4, a new triplet band appeared in the range of 500–700 nm (Fig. 4a), which is characteristic of tetrahedral Co2+ sites.26 Further adding iron species, the CT band of 390 nm became very weak (Fig. 4a); we also observed that the sample color became light green from green, indicating that the doping of iron promoted the formation of a tetrahedral Co2+ site in the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst,27 which was regarded as an active and selective species in propane dehydrogenation.5,6

The XPS measurement provided further support for this issue. Fig. 5a and Fig. S3, ESI,† show the XPS spectra in the Co 2p region and Fe 2p region of the 5Co/Al2O3, 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 and 1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalysts, respectively. It should be mentioned that the XPS signals in the Fe 2p region are completely overlapped by the Auger signals of the Co species. Thus, we only discussed the chemical state of the Co species. For the 5Co/Al2O3 catalyst, the main peaks of Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 are located at 781.8 and 797.6 eV, respectively, giving a spin–orbit splitting value of 15.8 eV.28–31 Compared to the 5Co/Al2O3 catalyst, the main peak of Co 2p3/2 in the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst shifted slightly to a lower binding energy, and the intensity ratio of the satellite peak (787.1 eV) to main peak (781.8 eV) increased to 0.4 from 0.3, indicating the increase of tetrahedral Co2+ sites in the catalyst. To quantify this difference, we further de-convoluted the Co 2p spectra into four individual contributions, including two spin–orbit doublets of Co2+ and Co3+ at Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, as well as two satellite peaks.17 The peak fitting results showed that the proportion (87%) of Co2+ sites on the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 surface was far higher than that (67%) on the 5Co/Al2O3 surface, in agreement with the results obtained in the UV-vis DRS experiments.
Fig. 5 (a) Co 2p XPS spectra and (b) H2-TPR profiles of the 5Co/Al2O3, 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 and 1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalysts.
Furthermore, the H2-TPR profiles of the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 and reference catalysts were measured to evaluate the anti-reductive capability of the cobalt species, often determining the stability of the cobalt catalyst in propane dehydrogenation.20 As displayed in Fig. 5b, the 5Co/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited two reduction peaks at 500 °C and 675 °C that could be attributed to the reduction of Co3+ species and surface Co2+ species,32–34 respectively. By adding iron species, the intensity ratio of the cobalt species at a high-temperature reduction peak (675 °C) to those at a low-temperature reduction peak (500 °C) was 4 times higher than that of 5Co/Al2O3, suggesting that the iron doping efficiently promoted the amount of Co2+ species. For the reduction of iron species, the main peak over 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 also moved to a high temperature, more than 100 °C compared to that of 1.6Fe/Al2O3, indicating that the anti-reductive capability of the iron species themselves was enhanced over the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst. All these enhancements on the anti-reductive capability were attractive for maintaining the stability of the cobalt catalyst under a strong reducing atmosphere in propane dehydrogenation.
3.3 Effect of iron doping on the catalytic performance of the cobalt catalyst
Propane dehydrogenation over a series of supported cobalt or/and iron catalysts was tested at 590 °C in a feed gas of 16 kPa propane and N2 balance. As shown in Fig. S4, ESI,† the iron only catalyst, up to 5 wt% loading, had little activity in propane dehydrogenation, indicating that only the cobalt component was catalytically active in this reaction while iron acted only as a promoter in the cobalt catalyst. For the cobalt only catalyst, we initially investigated the effect of cobalt content on the propane conversion and product selectivity, and the results are tabulated in Table S1, ESI.† As presented in Table S1 (ESI†), propane conversion exhibited a sharp rise to 14.5% when cobalt loading increased to 3 wt%, and propylene selectivity reached 96.8%. By further increasing the cobalt loading, both propane conversion and propylene selectivity had a slow increase. At a cobalt loading of 5 wt%, the highest propane conversion (∼16%) was obtained, and the products included the desired propylene (97.2%) and a small part of undesired ethane (0.1%), ethylene (1.4%) and methane (1.3%). Further increasing the loading amount of cobalt to 10 wt%, both propane conversion and propylene selectivity showed an obvious decrease.
Based on the 5Co/Al2O3 catalyst, adding appropriate iron as a promoter exhibited an obvious promotion for converting propane to produce propylene, as illustrated in Fig. 6a and b. Table 2 listed the effect of iron-doping amount on the catalytic performances of 5Co/Al2O3 catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation reaction in a detailed manner. Taking iron amount as a function, propane conversion showed an increase initially from 15.8% to 22.4% and then decreased to 13.8%, and propylene selectivity also displayed a similar varying trend. The appropriate amount of iron doped was determined to be 1.6 wt%, and the optimum propane conversion (22.4%) and propylene selectivity (97.3%), higher than those over most cobalt catalysts (Table S3, ESI†), was obtained at 590 °C with a space velocity of 4.7 gC3H8 gcat−1 h−1 over this 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst.

a Reaction conditions: temperature, 590 °C; catalyst weight, 0.1 g; gas feed, 16.2 kPa C3H8, and N2 balance; flow rate, 25 mL min−1. b Specific activity: the moles of C3H6 formation per moles of cobalt per second.
To be commercially attractive, propane dehydrogenation catalysts should display highly specific activity for propylene formation (i.e., moles of propylene formed per mole of metal per second). Accordingly, we calculated the specific activity for propylene formation over a series of cobalt-based catalysts (Table 2), assuming all cobalt atoms in the catalysts are active in propane dehydrogenation. For an optimum 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst, the specific activity of propylene formation arrived at 7.7 × 10−3 molC3H6 molmetal−1 s−1, higher than those obtained over the most frequently reported cobalt-based catalysts (Table S3, ESI†). Furthermore, we made an activity comparison between the present cobalt-iron catalyst and industrially-used chromium catalysts in the Catofin process, taking into account their common metal oxide properties. According to the calculations proposed by J. J. H. B. Sattler et al.,35 the average specific activities of industrially chromium oxide catalysts were close to 10−4 molC3H6 molmetal−1 s−1, and some literature studies also reported higher specific activities (4 × 10−3–7 × 10−3 molC3H6 molmetal−1 s−1) over chromium oxide catalysts.36,37 In our case, a relatively higher specific activity clearly demonstrated the application potential of such a catalytic system in the propane dehydrogenation process.
Furthermore, the evolution of propane conversion and propylene selectivity with the reaction time (Fig. 6a and b) was used to evaluate the catalyst stability of both 5Co/Al2O3 and 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalysts. For the 5Co/Al2O3 catalyst, a stable propane conversion of ∼16% was obtained during a 3.5 hour dehydrogenation test, but the propylene selectivity decreased to 93% from the initial 97%. Meanwhile, a rapid catalyst deactivation caused by coking appeared at 3.5 h. The XRD pattern (Fig. 6c) of the used catalyst showed the formation of a large number of metallic cobalt nanoparticles, a recognized active phase of coke deposition. For the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst, propane conversion had an increase of ∼7% after an initial two-hour reaction (Fig. 6a). Meanwhile, the reaction stability of the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst in propane dehydrogenation was significantly improved. As shown in Fig. 6a, the catalyst deactivation was not observed until more than ten hours on stream, meanwhile the propylene selectivity was maintained at ∼97%. All these results clearly suggest that the iron-doping efficiently improved the durability of the cobalt catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
3.4 Characterization and regeneration of the spent iron-doped cobalt catalyst
The spent catalyst was characterized to provide more investigations on the evolution of the catalyst structure after exposure to the reaction mixtures. Fig. S5 (ESI†) presents the HR-TEM images of the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst after a 14 hour dehydrogenation test. Compared to the fresh 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst, the particle sizes of the spent catalyst showed a slight growth, up to ∼10 nm. Also, at least on a nano-scale, no significant component separation of cobalt and iron was found through an EDX-mapping analysis (Fig. S6, ESI†). The XRD pattern (Fig. S7, ESI†) of the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst with a 14 hour dehydrogenation test showed two diffraction peaks that can be attributed to metallic cobalt, indicating a reduction of cobalt species in the propane dehydrogenation process. Except for the diffraction of metallic cobalt, there existed an obvious peak assigned to carbon deposits. The HR-TEM images (Fig. S5, ESI†) further revealed that multi-layer amorphous carbon deposits gradually wrapped up the active particles under the reaction conditions.
Moreover, the TGA-DSC measurement was performed to quantify the coking process of the spent catalysts. The TGA-DSC profiles of the spent 5Co/Al2O3 and 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalysts were exhibited in Fig. S8 and S9 (ESI†). Based on these results, the coke-accumulation rates were further evaluated, and the promotional effect of iron doping on the cobalt catalyst and coking behaviours was also discussed. As shown in Fig. 7a, the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited a low coke-accumulation rate (∼1 mg gcat−1 min−1), only half of that over the 5Co/Al2O3 catalyst. On the other hand, the XRD patterns (Fig. 6c) further revealed that no distinguishable peak assigned to carbon deposits was found over the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst after the 3.5 hour test, whereas a clear carbon peak over the 5Co/Al2O3 catalyst after the 3.5 hour test was found. These results suggested that iron doping well elevated the coke-resistant ability of the cobalt catalyst.

(b) Catalytic performances of the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst under regeneration treatment in 20 vol% O2 at 600 °C for 2 hours. Reaction conditions: temperature, 590 °C catalyst weight, 0.1 g gas feed, 16.2 kPa C3H8 and N2 balance flow rate, 25 mL min−1.
Finally, coke-burning regeneration was explored to improve the catalyst durability under operating conditions. Fig. 7b presented two successive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycling results of the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst. After oxidation treatment at a high temperature for the spent 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst, a higher activity and better stability were observed, suggesting an excellent regenerating ability of such a catalyst in propane dehydrogenation.
3.5 Origin of iron promotion on the dehydrogenation performance of the cobalt catalyst
In the section on structural characterization, we confirmed that iron doping can efficiently promote the formation of tetrahedral Co2+ species over the 5Co/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 4 and 5). Correlating with the catalytic results (Table 2 and Fig. 6) in conjunction with the previously published literature reports,15–20 these species most likely contribute to the improvement of activity and selectivity of the 5Co/Al2O3 catalyst. To obtain more insights on such a promotion effect, we further prepared two reference cobalt catalysts using the dopants of manganese and copper that approach cobalt and iron in the periodic table. Different from the doping of iron species, the doping of manganese or copper for the 5Co/Al2O3 catalyst did not present the promotional effect no matter whether in structure or catalytic performance. As shown in Fig. 8a and b, both 5Co1.6Mn/Al2O3 and 5Co1.6Cu/Al2O3 catalysts contained a high proportion of octahedral Co3+ cations besides tetrahedral Co2+ species. The most likely cause was that iron more easily formed a solid solution with cobalt compared with manganese or copper, thus presenting a promotional effect in the catalyst structure. The catalytic test (Fig. 8c) also showed that only iron doping promoted the catalytic activity and selectivity, while the doping of manganese or copper inhibited the catalytic activity of the cobalt catalyst in propane dehydrogenation. These results confirm the uniqueness of iron in promoting the catalyst structure and catalytic performance of the cobalt catalyst. As confirmed by the context, the incorporation of iron into the matrix of cobalt oxide promoted the generation of active tetrahedral Co2+ species. Theoretically, compared to cobalt, more electrophilic iron would enhance π donation of bridging oxygen and enlarge the adjacent cobalt-oxygen bond,38–40 which accordingly boosted the catalytic activity and selectivity of the cobalt-based catalyst. Moreover, iron modification for the cobalt catalyst efficiently prohibited the reduction of cobalt species under a strongly reducing atmosphere in propane dehydrogenation (Fig. 5b) and correspondingly improved the durability of the cobalt catalyst in the dehydrogenation reaction.

Reaction conditions: temperature, 590 °C, catalyst weight, 0.1 g, gas feed, 16.2 kPa C3H8 and N2 balance, flow rate, 25 mL min−1, time, 2 hours.
3.6 Effect of the support surface on the catalytic performance of the cobalt catalyst
In alkane dehydrogenation using metal oxide as a catalyst, the catalytic activity for C–H cleavage has proved to originate from the inherent Lewis acidity (metal centre) and basicity (oxygen centre) of a metal oxide.41–43 In our case, besides the active cobalt-oxygen species, the support “γ-Al2O3 nanosheet” also provided a large amount of coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ sites (Alcus) as well as neighbouring lattice oxygen (Fig. S2, ESI†). In particular, a recent study from Kondratenko's Group for the first time revealed that the Alcus sites with the Lewis acidity showed high activity in the catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutylene.44 Thus, to verify whether the Alcus site participates in the catalytic process, we evaluated the contribution of Alcus sites on the catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation.
Firstly, a reference catalyst, 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3-com, was prepared using a γ-Al2O3 counterpart with only 6.2% Alcus sites as a support (Fig. S1, ESI†). As observed in Table 1, the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3-com catalyst exhibited a larger surface area (198 m2 g−1) compared to the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst. Furthermore, NH3-TPD analysis was used to evaluate the difference in Lewis acidity between the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 and 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3-com catalysts. As shown in Fig. 9b, the ammonia uptake of the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst was 1.5 times higher than that of the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3-com catalyst, implying that the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst possessed more Alcus sites compared to the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3-com catalyst. Lastly, the dehydrogenation performances were compared under the same reaction conditions between the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 and 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3-com catalysts. We can see that the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited a higher propane conversion (22.4%) than that (16.5%) obtained over the 5Co1.6Fe/Al2O3-com catalyst even if the latter possessed a larger surface area (Table 1). The results indicate that in this case the catalytic activity did not depend on the surface area, while the Lewis acidic sites should be the main cause of activity difference. As exemplified in Fig. 9, two catalysts with a different amount of Alcus sites showed a difference of ∼28% of the total activity in terms of propane conversion, preliminarily disclosing a synergistic promotion between the Co2+ site and the Alcus site for the catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation over our CoFe/Al2O3 catalyst. Further investigations on such a synergistic effect are currently underway in our laboratory.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated that the doping of iron promoted both the activity and selectivity of the cobalt catalyst in propane dehydrogenation, and significantly improved the reaction durability of the cobalt catalyst. The optimal loading amounts of cobalt and iron were identified to be 5 wt% and 1.6 wt%, respectively. Structural characterization suggested that the cobalt species presented in the form of highly-dispersed Co3O4 nanoparticles attached on the surface of the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet, and the iron species doped into the matrix of the Co3O4 nanoparticle. Spectroscopic analysis for local coordination of active species revealed that iron doping promoted the generation of active tetrahedral Co2+ sites, and a stronger interaction of iron with the oxygen ligand weakened the π domination of oxygen into the adjacent cobalt centre, boosting the catalytic activity and selectivity of the cobalt catalyst. The H2-TPR analysis disclosed that the doping of iron efficiently prohibited the reduction of the cobalt species, and correspondingly improved the durability of the cobalt catalyst in propane dehydrogenation. Lastly, the synergistic promotion of active Co2+ sites and surface Alcus sites of the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet for the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation were found. This research provides a new strategy for improving the reactivity and stability of cobalt catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation, and can also be expanded to other energy-related catalytic processes involving cobalt catalysts.
