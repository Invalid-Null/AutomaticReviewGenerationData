Theory-Aided Discovery of Metallic Catalysts for Selective Propane Dehydrogenation to Propylene

Abstract
The design of selective and stable catalysts is a major challenge in heterogeneous catalysis, also true for propane dehydrogenation (PDH), an on-purpose route to produce propylene. Identifying nonprecious catalysts to replace Pt used today is another formidable task. Herein, we combine kinetic simulations, high-throughput computations, machine-learning concepts, and experiments to illustrate the key parameters controlling the performance of metallic catalysts in PDH. Our decision map successfully identifies NiMo as a very promising nonprecious metal catalyst, which is experimentally proven to outperform Pt in PDH. Our framework not only validates experimentally known catalysts but also provides ways for PDH catalyst engineering from theoretical high-throughput screening. We believe that the other 11 identified candidates will initiate further state-of-the-art experimental investigations and add important insights into the industrial development of catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propylene is an important building block for industrial production of numerous chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, cumene, oxo-chemicals, propylene oxide, isopropyl alcohol, and acrylic acid. (1,2) Currently, a large fraction of propylene is fabricated by steam cracking of naphtha or fluid catalytic cracking of gas and oil. (3) The increasing demand for pure propylene instead of mixed olefins promotes the development of the on-purpose catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) (C3H8 → C3H6 + H2, ΔH298K = 124 kJ/mol). This also benefits from the increasing amount of propane obtained from shale gas, especially in the USA. The commercial catalysts for selective PDH include Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts, (4) where Pt is environmentally friendly and thus more favored. However, pure Pt has high cost, low availability, and rapid deactivation, which makes it less than ideal. In practice, Pt is usually alloyed with another metal such as Sn, (5−7) In, (8) Cu, (9) Ga, (10,11) Mn, (12) Zn, (13) Cr, (14) B, (15) and Co (16) to enhance the selectivity and its stability. Other experimental strategies for improving the catalytic performances of Pt catalysts include modifications of the support (17−19) and control of nanoparticle size. (20,21)
In parallel with experiments, the reaction mechanism and potential structure–activity/selectivity relations of the PDH process have been investigated theoretically. For example, comparison of reaction networks between close-packed Pt(111) and stepped Pt(211) surfaces revealed that smaller Pt particles with more step sites had much higher activity but also lower selectivity and coke resistance. (22) A density functional theory (DFT) study showed that PDH on a Pt-based catalyst could be accelerated by cofeeding hydrogen. (23) The important role of hydrogen in improving PDH selectivity has also been demonstrated by a kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulation, and the active sites of Pt catalysts for the dehydrogenation and C–C bond cracking were proven to be different. (24) Additionally, both the structural and electronic effects of alloying Sn with Pt were theoretically investigated. For instance, Nykänen and Honkala (25) proposed that the high selectivity and stability of Pt–Sn catalysts are related to the lack of active Pt step sites decorated by Sn under operation. Chen et al. (26) proposed that Sn downshifted the d-band center of the PtSn surface and eventually lowered the propylene desorption energies and simultaneously increased the propylene dehydrogenation energy barriers, which is beneficial for the selective production of propylene.
Although these pioneering experimental and theoretical investigations have significantly deepened the understanding of the PDH process, the understanding of potential noble-metal-free catalysts for PDH is relatively limited compared to that of Pt-based catalysts. This is primarily because a general strategy guiding rational PDH catalyst design is missing. The lack of such a strategy increases the number of labor-intensive trial-and-error experiments and the computational cost of simulations. A descriptor-based computational strategy, a framework of correlating key properties of a catalyst surface to its activity, has been successfully applied to design a promising metallic heterogeneous catalyst in recent years. (27−29) The recent developments and implementations of machine learning in chemistry and material science have further accelerated catalyst design using advanced materials. (30,31)
Herein, we establish a detailed microkinetic model based on computed energetics of the PDH mechanism for a group of transition-metal surfaces. We identify the key descriptors governing the activity and selectivity of propylene production via PDH using a statistical analysis. A well-defined acquisition function combined with a high-throughput computational strategy was used to facilitate efficient identification of potentially promising bimetallic alloy catalysts for selective PDH. Our method has identified promising candidates containing nonprecious Ni and Mo metal, which are demonstrated experimentally to perform better than Pt in propylene production from PDH. We suggest a group of candidates for further analysis.

PDH Reaction Mechanism
The mechanism for selective propylene production from PDH mainly involves C–H bond breaking but can also be accompanied by undesired side reactions such as C–C scission and isomerization. As proposed by extensive available theoretical studies, (9,24,25,32) the energy difference between propylene desorption and deep dehydrogenation is identified as an important indicator for controlling propylene selectivity. Additionally, C–C scission was found to only occur favorably with species that are more dehydrogenated than propylene, (33) and propyne was an important coke precursor because of its relatively low C–C bond-breaking energy barrier on relevant catalysts. (22) Based on this information, we performed systematic DFT computations of the reaction pathways from propane to propyne, as shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1
Figure 1. Reaction pathways considered for the propylene production from propane. Gray rectangles specify interaction with the catalyst surface, “g” denotes gaseous species, and ads/des denotes the adsorption/desorption of species.
Calculations were restricted to close-packed fcc(111) surfaces for Cu, Ag, Au, Ni, Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ir and hcp(0001) surfaces for Co, Ru, Re, and Os metals, using the BEEF-vdW exchange–correlation functional and all details are available in the Supporting Information. Despite the high activity of step sites, the low availability and low stability dramatically reduced their significance in PDH. The thermodynamically most stable close-packed surfaces are therefore chosen as models in this work. The formation energies of all related adsorbates and transition states (TSs) are given in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information and all the optimized 3D coordinates are available via the open access database for surface reactions at https://www.catalysis-hub.org/publications/WangTheory-aided2020. Overall, the initial C–H scission can take place at either the methyl or methylene functional group of propane, which produces 1-propyl (CH3CH2CH2) and 2-propyl (CH3CHCH3), respectively. Then, β-hydride elimination of 1-propyl and 2-propyl generates the target product propylene, whereas α-hydride elimination produces propylidene species. Finally, any further deep dehydrogenation of propylene and propylidene would generate propyne, which will result in selectivity loss and coking via C–C scission. We therefore propose that the reaction rate difference between propylene and propyne production is a key indicator for the propylene selectivity in PDH.
Dimensionality Reduction
Originating from the generalized d-band theory, it is known that energies of adsorbates on transition-metal surfaces are linearly correlated. (34) With the help of this descriptor-based approach implemented in the microkinetic simulation software CatMAP, (35) the general trends in PDH reactivity for transition metals and alloys can be described in a two-dimensional (2D) volcano map. To identify the strongest pair of descriptors, we applied statistical analysis for this reaction. More specifically, the descriptor selection was performed by combining any two of the twelve key adsorbates shown in Figure 1, making 66 different descriptor pairs. The formation energies of 12 adsorbates and 14 TSs on different metals were linearly scaled with each descriptor pair, and the accuracy of scaled energies was evaluated using the MAEs. Figure 2 depicts the overall MAE values of scaled energetics for each descriptor pair. Taking the left-bottom square as an example, scaling relations with CH3CH2CH3/H as the descriptor pair gives an overall MAE of 0.3 eV. More detailed MAE values at each descriptor pair are shown in Figures S2 and S3. It is worth noting that 13 of these descriptor pairs have an overall MAE lower than 0.09 eV, which indicates that choosing any of these pairs will not result in significant accuracy loss for the scaled energetics of all species. We made our definitive selection based on available chemical knowledge of the PDH reaction in the literature. (9,25,26,32) For example, CH3CHCH2 is widely known as a key intermediate in determining PDH selectivity and is thus chosen as one significant descriptor. It can identify the differences among noble metals, but fail to adequately capture the coinage metals, which means that this single descriptor is not able to capture the binding properties of all transition metals and alloys. Therefore, CH3CH2CH is chosen as the second descriptor enabling differentiating the binding properties of coinage metals. Meanwhile, CH3CHCH2/CH3CH2CH is among the best 13 descriptor pairs, thus guaranteeing good accuracy. In summary, the ideal descriptors should be able to capture the differences among the catalyst surfaces and specifically separate them in the 2D volcanoes. The strategy introduced in this work provides an elegant way to select meaningful and accurate descriptors, and it works as a good basis for descriptor-based microkinetic modeling.

PDH Activity and Selectivity Maps
Based on the energetics from carefully constructed scaling relations and the PDH reaction mechanism in Figure 1, a mean-field microkinetic model is established that effectively maps the reaction rate of propylene at 873 K, 0.2 bar propane, C3H8/H2 = 1/1, and low propane conversion (0.1%). The reason for running the model at low conversion is to avoid approaching equilibrium because the TOF will be zero at equilibrium. Figure 3a shows the general activity trend of a series of transition metals for propylene production as a function of CH3CHCH2 (ΔECH3CHCH2) and CH3CH2CH (ΔECH3CH2CH) adsorption energies. Our results indicate that Pt and Re are the closest to the plateau on the activity volcano, suggesting their high activities for propylene production. Meanwhile, Ir, Rh, Ru, and Os are also identified to be active, while Cu, Ag, and Au are seen to have relatively poor activity. It is noteworthy that the coverage is low for all species under such a high temperature, as revealed in Figure S4.

Activity (a), selectivity (b), and decision (c) maps for propylene production via PDH as a function of CH3CHCH2 (ΔECH3CHCH2) and CH3CH2CH (ΔECH3CH2CH) adsorption energies at 873 K, 0.2 bar propane, C3H8/H2 = 1/1, and 0.1% propane conversion. Values 1 and 0 in the decision map denote promising and less promising PDH catalysts, respectively. Pure metal catalysts, Pt-based alloys, and noble-metal-free NiMo alloys are shown as black dots, blue inverted triangles, and blue crosses, respectively. 1MoNi denotes a dilute alloy, in which one surface Ni atom of a p(4 × 2)–Ni(111) surface is substituted by one Mo atom.
Since the selectivity toward propylene is the key target in the PDH reaction, we use the reaction mechanism in Figure 1 and apply the widely accepted knowledge in the literature that the further deep dehydrogenation of propylene to propyne constitutes the major channel responsible for the selectivity loss. (9,25,26,32) Hence, based on the activity maps for propylene in Figure 3a and propyne in Figure S5, we can define the propylene selectivity using the equation: Spropylene = rpropylene/(rpropylene + rpropyne) where rpropylene and rpropyne are the reaction rates for propylene and propyne production, respectively. The resulting propylene selectivity map is shown in Figure 3b. Clearly, Cu, Ag, and Au are predicted to be highly selective to propylene, but the low activity, as revealed in Figure 3a, eliminates them as promising PDH catalysts. In addition, a predicted relatively high propylene activity for Re, Rh, Ru, Ir, and Os metals combined with a low propylene selectivity also prevents these metals from being good catalysts for PDH. Co, Ni, and Pd metals all with moderate propylene selectivity and activity are also unattractive candidates. In this regard, our results clearly identify Pt as the most promising catalyst for propylene production with both reasonable activity and selectivity, in agreement with widely available experimental results where Pt-based catalysts indeed are most useful industrially. (2) Clearly, our descriptor-based kinetic model provides a rationale for the general trend in catalytic performances of different transition metals in selective PDH for propylene production, which agrees well with available experimental knowledge in the literature and therefore provides a possible screening protocol for PDH catalyst design.
Acquisition Function for Catalyst Screening
In general, the activity and selectivity maps for propylene production shown in Figure 3a,b provide the foundation for extensive screening of metallic PDH catalysts. A typical but time-consuming method to identify promising catalysts for PDH is to check if a catalyst is positioned in the highly active and selective regions of the maps in Figure 3. This evaluation procedure is usually achieved by calculation of the parameters ΔECH3CHCH2 and ΔECH3CH2CH of a given catalyst and then evaluation of its activity and selectivity based on the maps. This clearly represents an inefficient approach. With the help of statistical analysis, we instead apply these functionality maps in a different way. Our goal is to discover better catalysts with both comparable or even higher activity and selectivity for propylene production than Pt, and the two functionality maps in Figure 3a,b are composed by numerous points (TOF or selectivity values) at different 2D-descriptor values, as depicted in Figure S5c. We therefore define an acquisition function, which is able to make decisions on the optimal next step in the Bayesian optimization (a popular approach in training expensive machine learning models), (36) as
More specifically, if a catalyst with a given pair of descriptor values (ΔECH3CHCH2 and ΔECH3CH2CH) has comparable TOF and higher selectivity for propylene production than Pt when evaluated using the functionality maps shown in Figure 3, we assign it the value 1, otherwise a value of 0 is assigned. Noteworthy, despite multiple options in defining the acquisition function such as TOF < TOF(Pt) and selectivity ≥ selectivity (Pt) are possible, we define the simplest possible function with a binary output, providing straightforward information to experimentalists. Based on the TOF and selectivity maps, a decision map is generated, as shown in Figure 3c. In this way, candidates that fall in the orange region represent promising PDH catalyst candidates. We believe that the application of such an acquisition function and the resulting decision map will make descriptor-based catalyst screening even more efficient, thus providing improvements to our modeling approaches and implementation of our open-source CatMAP software. (35)
Theoretical Catalyst Screening and Experimental Validation
Because of the wide experimental interests and efforts in exploring Pt-based alloys for selective PDH, systematic computations of CH3CHCH2 and CH3CH2CH adsorption energies were performed on 90 Pt-based alloys from Catalysis-hub database (37) with AB and AB3 compositions, and 30 of them are predicted to be potentially promising for selective propylene production via PDH (listed in Table S1). To evaluate the predictive ability of our decision map, we put the experimentally reported promising PDH catalysts such as PtSn, (5,7) PtIn, (8) PtCu, (9) PtGa, (10,11) PtMn, (12) PtZn, (13) and PtCo (15) on the decision map shown in Figure 3c. Interestingly, all these points (ΔECH3CHCH2 and ΔECH3CH2CH) lie in the orange region with theoretically predicted promising performance for PDH, which agrees well with most of the available experimental observations. At this stage, we became more confident with this decision map in PDH catalyst discovery for selective propylene production, and a further screening of alloys was performed by combining several nonprecious metals in the periodic table such as Co, Ni, Zn, Ga, In, Sn, Mo, and W, which resulted in around 35 bimetallic alloys with AB and AB3 compositions. Among the 11 noble-metal-free promising candidates shown in Table S1, the NiMo ensemble with different compositions (see blue crosses in Figure 3c) stands out in the decision map as a particularly interesting candidate, which is theoretically predicted to have better propylene activity and selectivity than Pt. Further inspections show that promising PDH catalysts in the orange region of Figure 3c are clearly off the scaling relation between CH3CHCH2 and CH3CH2CH. Therefore, an ideal PDH catalyst tends to be an outlier on the known scaling relation. (34)
To further demonstrate the transferability from theoretical prediction to practical catalytic reaction, we synthesized the NiMo catalyst on the Al2O3 support (NiMo/Al2O3) and tested the catalytic performance for PDH. The contents of Ni and Mo in NiMo/Al2O3 are 2.91 and 1.59 wt %, respectively, corresponding to a Ni/Mo mole ratio of 3/1, which are measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). For comparison, the catalytic PDH performance was also examined in the presence of the Pt/Al2O3 (1 wt %) catalyst. To keep the reaction conditions consistent with theoretical kinetic modeling shown in Figure 3, the experimental inlet C3H8/H2 ratio is set to be 1/1, which is experimentally reported to be able to alleviate coke formation of the Pt catalyst but is usually accompanied with low propylene selectivity. (12) However, this setting could guarantee that both Pt and NiMo catalysts are tested under the same reaction conditions, and the intrinsic performance will be fairly compared. As shown in Figure 4, the propylene selectivity for NiMo/Al2O3 is two times higher than Pt/Al2O3, whereas the propylene selectivity improves to 63.1% for NiMo/Al2O3 with 11.9% conversion compared with 28.5% selectivity and 16.6% conversion for Pt/Al2O3 after 6 h. The main byproducts are methane and ethylene for both catalysts. In the presence of NiMo/Al2O3, the selectivity to methane and ethylene is 20.1 and 16.8%, while those on Pt/Al2O3 are 40 and 31.5%. Furthermore, we prolonged the reaction time to test the stability of the catalysts and still found that the selectivity toward propylene was still low in the presence of Pt/Al2O3 after several hours on stream during the PDH at 843 K (Figure 4a). In contrary, for the NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst, the selectivity for propylene only decreased slightly from 65 to 60.6% after 24 h on stream (Figure 4b). Noteworthy, the H2 in the inlet gas feeding is important to stabilize the NiMo catalyst because the propane conversion decreased quickly to 5% after 2 h in the absence of H2. The XRD analysis shows a small peak related to deposited carbon in Figure S6. Please note that the initial selectivity of propylene on the NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst is lower due to the formation of methane and increased over 60% after 1 h. Moreover, under the same reaction conditions, the propane conversion was significantly reduced for Pt/Al2O3 while only a little decrease for NiMo/Al2O3 was observed. More importantly, no obvious deactivation was observed for NiMo/Al2O3 during the PDH demonstrating its high stability (Figure 4b). Compared with other reported Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, (9,38) our NiMo/Al2O3 exhibits better selectivity, although the conversion is slightly lower. The Ni/Al2O3 and Mo/Al2O3 are also prepared and tested for PDH. As shown in Figure S7, the NiMo/Al2O3 showed the highest initial propylene formation compared with isolated Ni and Mo catalysts, indicating the NiMo being the main active centers. Clearly, the NiMo/Al2O3 already outperforms Pt/Al2O3 in activity, selectivity, and stability under the same reaction conditions. Considering that the industrial catalysts for PDH are based mainly on Cr and PtSn, the non-noble and low-toxic NiMo catalyst alternative offers a potentially promising catalyst interesting not only for fundamental scientific reasons but also for application in industry. The experimental results in the current work provide the proof-of-concept needed to substantiate the established theoretical framework for accelerated PDH catalyst discovery. However, we note that the NiMo catalyst is far from optimal for industrial application, and further optimization and refined synthesis are essential to enhance performance. This is part of our ongoing experimental efforts. Most importantly, compared with the much higher price of Pt (27 $/g), this Ni (0.025 $/g)/Mo (0.016 $/g) composition represents an economically very promising candidate for practical application in PDH, which will dramatically decrease the capital cost for industrial application.

Reaction conditions: atmospheric pressure, 843 K, C3H8/H2 = 1/1, with balance Ar for a total flow rate of 48 mL min–1 and 500 mg of catalyst.
To gain more insights into the structure of the catalyst, the as-prepared and used NiMo/Al2O3 catalysts were carefully examined. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution (HR) TEM and TEM energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) maps for the as-prepared NiMo/Al2O3 are shown in Figure 5a–c, and the TEM–EDS image of Mo in Figure 5c shows that Mo is present as atomically dispersed and isolated species. TEM images of the NiMo/Al2O3 catalyst after PDH at 843 K are shown in Figure 5d–i. Clearly, well-defined nanoparticles were observed with an average diameter of 15–20 nm and the Ni/Mo ratio of 3.2 shown in Figure S8. Moreover, the TEM–EDS maps confirm the formation of 3:1 Ni/Mo-alloyed nanoparticles shown in Figure 5h,i. However, the peak of NiMo alloys is determined by XRD characterizations at 43° shown in Figure S6 indicating the formation of the NiMo alloy. (39) Moreover, the alloyed NiMo nanoparticles could also be observed by extending the time to 4 h. For the Pt/Al2O3, about 2 nm of Pt nanoparticles were determined by TEM, as shown in Figure S9. Meanwhile, there is no XRD peak for isolated Ni and Mo nanoparticles indicating the high stability of the NiMo alloy during the PDH. These results demonstrated that once the initial activation is complete, the formed NiMo catalyst is very stable. As already shown in the first hour of PDH (Figure 4b), the single Mo and Ni atoms are very active but only lead to C–C bond cleavage with the formation of methane. The formation of Ni–Mo nanoparticles with a diameter of approximately 15–20 nm makes the significant improvement of the catalytic performance of the PDH process to propylene, which indicates that our framework based on theoretical simulation could provide reasonable predictions in aiding the effective discovery of a promising PDH catalyst experimentally.

Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
We introduced an effective framework, combining first-principle-based kinetic simulations, high-throughput computations, machine learning concepts, and experiments, to accelerate the discovery of promising metallic catalysts for selective propylene production from PDH. The general activity and selectivity trends for propylene production on a group of transition metals (Cu, Ag, Ag, Ni, Pt, Pd, Co, Rh, Ir, Ru, Re, and Os) were clearly described and parameterized as a function of two relevant C3 descriptors (CH3CHCH2 and CH3CH2CH). Our simulations clearly indicate that Pt is the only pure metal catalyst with both reasonable propylene activity and selectivity, which explains the unique role of Pt in industrial application for PDH. A decision map is introduced through a well-defined acquisition function, which lays the foundation and the theoretical guidelines for an effective PDH catalyst screening. Accurate computation of adsorption energies for C3 descriptors on a group of Pt-based alloys identifies 30 interesting candidates, and most of them have been experimentally reported in the literature as being promising catalysts for PDH. Further screening of nonprecious metal alloys identified NiMo as a very interesting candidate composition and our experimental collaborators verified that it has a better propylene activity/selectivity than Pt. Clearly, our simulations not only successfully identify experimentally known catalysts but also provide suggestions for promising PDH catalysts. A total of 11 noble-metal-free bimetallic alloys were predicted to have potentially better PDH performance than Pt. Further experimental studies are needed to validate this. More extensive screenings of different alloys such as trimetallic alloys with our established framework will identify more interesting catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation to produce olefins. In addition, the approaches introduced herein concerning descriptor selection, the chosen acquisition function, and the decision map are significant improvements to descriptor-based microkinetic modeling and can be transferred to other reactions in heterogeneous catalysis.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
