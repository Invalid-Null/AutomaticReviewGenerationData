The document discusses the effects of zeolite channel structure and acid site location on the rates and selectivities of monomolecular propane cracking and dehydrogenation reactions. It does not discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically for converting propane to propylene. The document focuses on using zeolites as acidic catalysts to gain insights into the roles of spatial confinement and acid site proximity in stabilizing transition states and mediating enthalpy-entropy trade-offs. It does not report any specific catalyst enhancements for industrial PDH or ODH processes.
