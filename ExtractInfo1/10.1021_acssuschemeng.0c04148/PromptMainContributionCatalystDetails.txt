Boron Nitride and Oxide Supported on Dendritic Fibrous Nanosilica for Catalytic Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane

Abstract
In this work, we were able to significantly increase the activity of boron nitride (BN) catalysts used for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane by designing and synthesizing BN supported on dendritic fibrous nanosilica (DFNS). DFNS/BN showed a markedly increased catalytic efficiency, accompanied by exceptional stability and selectivity. Textural characterization, together with solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analyses, indicates the presence of a combination of unique fibrous morphology of DFNS and various boron sites connected to silica to be the reason for this increase in the catalytic performance. Notably, DFNS/B2O3 also showed catalytic activity, although with more moderate selectivity compared to that of DFNS/BN. Solid-state NMR spectra indicate that the higher selectivity of DFNS/BN might stem from a larger amount of hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups attached to B atoms. This study indicates that both boron nitride and oxide are active catalysts and by using high surface area support (DFNS), conversion from propane to propene as well as productivity of olefins was significantly increased.

Propene is a very important building block for a large number of chemical products, such as the widely used poly(propene) polymer. It is also used to produce a large quantity of other useful chemicals, such as acrolein, acrylonitrile, cumene, propylene oxide, and butyraldehyde. The catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to produce alkenes can be a game-changing technology in the chemical industry. (1−4) However, even after decades of research, the propene selectivity remains too low because of overoxidation of propene to CO2. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a heterogeneous catalytic process, which can convert propane to propene at low temperatures and with good selectivity.
Recently, the catalytic properties of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) for the conversion of propane to propene with high selectivity to olefins were reported. (5,6) This discovery provides an alternative route for the production of olefins from alkanes, which is much more sustainable than the conventional protocol. It was hypothesized that the oxidized edges of these materials were the catalytic active sites. (5) Additional studies on various boron-containing materials with oxidized surfaces supported that assumption. (7−10) In particular, 11B solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and in operando infrared spectroscopies showed the oxidation of h-BN surface under ODH conditions. (8,10) Density functional theory calculations also proved that the formation of a disordered boron oxide phase at the surface of h-BN is feasible. (11) More recently, it has been shown that boron oxide supported on mesoporous silica or silica nanoparticles can catalyze the ODH of propane. (12,13) Conversely, it was shown that zeolites containing isolated BO3 units incorporated into the zeolite framework show no catalytic activity for the ODH of propane to propene and the catalysis of ODH reaction requires the presence of aggregated boron sites. (14) In this work, we have sought to ascertain whether the activity and selectivity of these catalysts can be increased and the structures can be made more stable.
Herein, we report the design and synthesis of BN supported on dendritic fibrous nanosilica (DFNS/BN). We used DFNS as a support because it has a large surface area (SA) and excellent physical and textural properties, (15−17) as well as possesses a unique fibrous morphology instead of the porous structures found in, for example, MCM-41 and SBA-15 type materials.
Results and Discussion

We coated the DFNS fibers with BN using boric acid and urea as precursors using our recently developed solution-phase deposition process, (17) which was then treated at a temperature of 900 °C under nitrogen for 5 h to produce DFNS/BN. The crystallographic forms of BN, oxidation states, and textural properties [SA, pore volume (PV), pore sizes] were determined by transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), N2 sorption analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The local structure of these materials was also studied by 1H, 11B, and 29Si solid-state NMR spectroscopy.
Figure 1a,b shows the SEM and TEM images of DFNS/BN. They reveal that the fibrous morphology of DFNS remained intact and that a uniformly coated BN layer was achieved. No superfluous BN particle formation outside of the DFNS nanospheres was observed. The BN loading on DFNS was estimated by SEM–EDX analysis at 10 different points (to minimize errors) and was found to be 13.7 wt %. Its nitrogen sorption isotherm is of type IV, with a type H4 hysteresis (Figure 1c), typical of mesoporous materials lacking well-defined pores. (18−22) The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) SA and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) cumulative PV of DFNS/BN were determined to be 33 m2 g–1 and 0.06 cm3 g–1, respectively, for DFNS/BN. The reduced SA and PV in this material compared to that of the DFNS before coating (609 m2 g–1 and 0.8 cm3 g–1, respectively) indicate the filling of the DFNS channels by BN, thus resulting in an increased fiber thickness and decreased space between fibers.

The catalytic activity of DFNS/BN for propane dehydrogenation was studied using a fixed bed microactivity flow reactor under atmospheric pressure (1 bar). We first optimized the reaction temperature (Figure 1d), and 490 °C was found to be the best temperature in terms of catalytic activity and selectivity. At 490 °C, we studied the stability of DFNS/BN on the basis of conversion and selectivity (Figure 1e) and observed that the catalyst was moderately stable for 19 h with the decrease in conversion to ∼18% with around 59.4% selectivity for propene and around 16.5% for ethene. In terms of productivity, a significant amount of propene (38,360 μmol gcat–1 h–1) and ethene (10,657 μmol gcat–1 h–1) was produced. However, the productivity of propene decreased with time (Figure 1f), indicating coke formation (Figure S1) on the catalyst surface. CO productivity at 525 °C increased sharply. This could be due to the reverse water gas shift reaction, although there is a need to separate study to understand this further.
In order to gain insight into the mechanistic details of this propane conversion, we performed PXRD and XPS studies of DFNS/BN before and after catalysis (Figure 2). PXRD data indicate that as-synthesized DFNS/BN contains a crystalline BN phase (JCPDS-00-018-0251) (Figure 2a). After catalysis, the diffraction peaks of the crystalline BN phase disappear, whereas a boron oxide phase (JCPDS-00-013-0570) is detected. XPS studies also evidence the conversion of the BN phase to the boron oxide phase after catalysis. Figure 2b–e shows typical B 1s, Si 2p, O 1s, and N 1s core-level spectra. The B 1s spectrum of as-prepared DFNS/BN (Figure 2b) is the superposition of peaks at a binding energy of 190 and 192–193 eV assigned to B–N supported on silica and O–B–O, B–O–H environments, respectively. It indicates that before catalysis, DFNS/BN contains both phases, BN and boron oxide. Because boron oxide was not observed in PXRD, it must be in the amorphous phase. After catalysis, the B–N signal at 190 eV disappears, while the broad signal around 192–193 eV assigned to boron oxide increases. (6,23) The Si 2p3/2 spectrum is identified to be Si–O at ∼103 eV (Figure 2c), (24) while the O 1s signal at 532–533 eV subsumes the signals of B2O3 and SiO2 (Figure 2d). (23,25,26) Both Si 2p3/2 and O 1s spectra are not significantly modified before and after catalysis. In the XPS spectrum of the as-prepared catalyst, the N 1s signals at 398.8 and 400.2 eV (Figure 2e) were assigned to B–N and N–H, respectively. (23) In contrast, after catalysis, the signal at 398.8 eV is strongly reduced. This observation further confirms that BN was converted to B2O3 during the reaction, and because the catalyst remained stable for several hours, it suggests that B2O3 is also catalytically active for propane dehydrogenation. Reactions using only the DFNS support displayed poor performance, whilst pure h-BN showed lower conversion and productivity compared to DFNS/BN (Figure S2). TEM imaging after catalysis did not indicate any significant change in the catalyst morphology (Figure S3).

In order to test the influence of B2O3 on the catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation, we prepared B2O3 supported on DFNS using solid-phase synthesis deposition techniques with boric acid as a precursor. Figure 3a,b shows the SEM and TEM images of DFNS/B2O3. As expected, they reveal that the fibrous morphology of DFNS remained intact and uniformly coated by a B2O3 layer, with no particle formation observed outside silica nanospheres. The B2O3 loading on DFNS was estimated by SEM–EDX analysis (at 10 different points to minimize the error) and was found to be 10 wt %. Its nitrogen sorption isotherm (Figure 3c) can be classified as type IV with a type H4 hysteresis loop associated with the presence of mesopores that are not well-defined. (18−22) The BET SA and BJH PV were determined to be higher (371 m2 g–1 and 0.41 cm3 g–1, respectively) than those of DFNS/BN, possibly owing to the smaller thickness of boron oxide film with respect to BN. DFNS/B2O3 showed pore size distribution (inset Figure 3c) similar to DFNS because of its fibrous morphology, which was kept intact even after B2O3 coating. DFNS/B2O3 was then evaluated for the catalytic propane dehydrogenation reaction under exactly the same conditions as those of DFNS/BN (Figure 3d–f).

Background in SEM images is a rough surface of the aluminum grid. Error bars were calculated by conducting reactions three times.
The catalytic activity and stability of DFNS/B2O3 for propane dehydrogenation was studied at 490 °C in terms of conversion and selectivity (Figure 3). It is observed that the catalyst was stable for 19 h, with around 17.9% selectivity for propene and 6.8% for ethene and more than 70% for COx with x = 1 or 2, with a conversion rate of 24.8%. High selectivity toward the CO needs further investigation. In terms of productivity, it showed good propene (19,520 μmol gcat–1 h–1) and ethene (7441 μmol gcat–1 h–1) productivities (Figure 3f), nearly half of the DFNS/BN (Figure 1f). This indicates that B2O3 is catalytically active, albeit to a lesser extent than BN.
PXRD and XPS analyses of DFNS/B2O3 before and after catalysis were also performed (Figure 4). The PXRD results indicate that DFNS/B2O3 (before and after catalysis) contains crystalline B2O3 phase (JCPDS-00-013-0570) (Figure 4a). XPS analysis also confirms the presence of B2O3 phase. The B 1s signal at 192–193 eV in Figure 4b was attributed to boron oxide species. (23,27) The Si 2p3/2 peak at ∼103 eV in Figure 4c was assigned to Si–O, (24) while the O 1s signal at 532–533 eV in Figure 4d is the sum of contribution of B2O3 and SiO2 phases. (23,25,26)

Notably, when we compared these catalysts at various weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), DFNS/BN was found to be better than h-BN in terms of propane conversion and propene productivity, while BNNT showed better propene productivity compared to DFNS/BN (Figure 5). DFNS/B2O3 also displayed better performance than h-BN as well as a better conversion but lower productivity than B2O3 supported on SBA-15 (BOS-10) and BNNT. Better performance of both DFNS/BN and DFNS/B2O3 was due to highly accessible active sites because of the fibrous morphology and high SA of DFNS. These DFNS/BN- and DFNS/B2O3-supported catalysts showed better performance than vanadium (V) supported on silica, one of the best-known silica-supported catalysts (Table 1). (5,12)

The local atomic environments of the DFNS-supported BN and B2O3 catalysts were then studied by solid-state NMR spectroscopy (Figures 6 and 7), a technique that has been extensively demonstrated to be a powerful probe of the local structure of materials. (28−32) Indeed, we have recently shown the successful use of solid-state NMR to better understand catalytic sites and catalytic mechanisms. (33−35) We first conducted magic-angle spinning (MAS) solid-state 1D 1H, 11B, and 29Si NMR experiments on DFNS/BN (as-prepared and after catalysis) and as-prepared DFNS/B2O3 (Figure 6). The 1H NMR spectrum of as-prepared DFNS/BN is dominated by a peak at 6.8 ppm and also exhibits a broad resonance with a maximal intensity at 4.3 ppm extending down to 0 ppm (Figure 6a). The peak at 6.8 ppm is assigned to hydroxyl groups on the edge of BN sheets. (36−38) This signal can also subsume contributions from the NB2H sites of the armchair edges of BN sheets as well as BO3OH moieties because the reported isotropic chemical shifts, δiso, of these sites are ca. 6 and 8 ppm, respectively. (13,38) The broad signal centered at 4.3 ppm subsumes the contributions of adsorbed water, (39−42) BO2OH sites having δiso values ranging from 5 to 2.7 ppm depending on the formation of hydrogen bonds and the nature of the second neighbor, B or Si, (12−14,43,44) the NB2H sites of the zigzag edges of BN sheets resonating at ca. 3 ppm, (38) and silanol groups with δiso values ranging from 3 to 1.6 ppm depending on the formation of hydrogen bonds and the nature of the second neighbor, B or Si. (12−14,39,40,43,44) The 1H NMR spectrum of DFNS/BN after catalysis, shown in Figure 6d, displays a broad peak centered at 4.4 ppm, which subsumes the contribution of adsorbed water, BO2OH sites, and silanol groups. The peak at 0.1 ppm arises from coke formation or the surface residual organic species. The marked reduction in the intensity of the resonance at 6.5 ppm indicates the conversion of BN into B2O3 in agreement with XPS and PXRD data. The 1H spectrum of as-prepared DFNS/B2O3 shown in Figure 6g exhibits peaks at 2.9 and 1.7 ppm, which are ascribed to BO2OH and isolated silanol sites, respectively. Silanol groups close to B atoms with δiso values ranging from 2.2 to 2.7 ppm can contribute to the 1H signal. (14,44−46) The peak at 0 ppm is due to mobile residual organic species. The higher chemical shift of BO2OH signal for DFNS/BN after catalysis than for as-prepared DFNS/B2O3 could result from the larger amount of hydrogen-bonded BO2OH sites. (13)

The projections in F1 indirect dimension of MQMAS spectra along with their deconvolution are shown in Figures S9 and S10. The MQMAS and 11B–{1H} D-HMQC spectra were acquired at B0 = 18.8 T and νR = 20 kHz, whereas the 11B–{29Si} D-HMQC NMR spectra were recorded at B0 = 18.8 T and νR = 14.286 kHz.
1D 11B NMR data for the three aforementioned samples are presented in Figure 6b,e,h and compared in Figure S4. The spectrum of as-prepared DFNS/BN (Figure 6b) shows three broad signals with centers of gravity at ca. 0, 15, and 26 ppm. The signal at ∼26 ppm is assigned to tricoordinated (BIII) boron species of type BN3, BN2O, and BNO2 because these sites have δiso values of 30, 27–28, and 20–24 ppm, respectively, and quadrupolar coupling constant CQ = 2.7–2.9 MHz. (8,13,47,48) The BN2O and BNO2 sites are located on the edges of the BN sheets. The signal at ∼15 ppm is assigned to tricoordinated BO3 environments. (12,13,44,46,49−53) The signal at ∼0 ppm is assigned to tetracoordinated (BIV) BO4 environments. (44,46,49,50,54) The 11B spectrum being quantitative, the integrated intensities of the different signals indicates that BN sheets contains 37% of boron atoms, with the remaining ones forming boron oxide phases as the result of the oxidation of BN sheets. The spectra of DFNS/BN after catalysis and as-prepared DFNS/B2O3 appear to be relatively similar. Both display line shape components with centers of gravity at ∼14 ppm attributed to BO3 sites. This line is slightly broader for the DFNS/BN sample after catalysis. The signal at 26 ppm of BN3 and BN2O sites has a very low intensity for the DFNS/BN sample after catalysis, which further confirms the oxidation of BN. As expected, this signal is not observed in the 11B spectrum of as-prepared DFNS/B2O3. The spectra of DFNS/BN after catalysis and as-prepared DFNS/B2O3 display a small peak at ∼0 ppm that can be assigned to BO4 environments.
To confirm the above assignment and probe 1H–11B proximities, we recorded 2D 11B–{1H} through space heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence (D-HMQC) spectra of these three samples. The D-HMQC spectrum of as-prepared DFNS/BN (Figure 7a) is dominated by a cross-peak between hydroxyl groups on the edge of BN sheets at 6.7 ppm and 11BO3 signal at 15 ppm. This observation is consistent with the formation of a disordered boron oxide phase at the surface of h-BN. (8,11) The BO3 signal also correlates with the 1H signal at 4 ppm assigned to BO2OH sites, which substantiates the presence of these sites in this sample. The lower intensity of the cross-peak at 4 ppm with respect to that at 6.7 ppm is consistent with the relative intensities of these signals in the 1D 1H spectrum. The 11B signals at ∼0 ppm of BO4 sites also exhibit weaker correlations with 1H signals at 4 and 6.7 ppm, which indicates the close proximity between BO4 environments and hydroxyl groups on the edge of BN sheets as well as BO2OH sites. The 11B signal at 26 ppm exhibits further reduced correlations with 1H signals at 6.7 ppm, which could stem from BN2(OH) sites at the edge of BN sheets, as well as at 4 ppm, which indicates the close proximity between BO2OH sites and BN sheets. Nevertheless, as seen in Figure S5, the relative intensities of the sites BNxO(3–x) with x = 1, 2, or 3 and BO4 with respect to that of BO3 environments are much smaller in the projection of the D-HMQC spectrum than in the quantitative spectrum. The weak cross-peaks of BO4 sites indicate that they are more distant from hydroxyl groups than BO3. Furthermore, the correlations between protons and 11B nuclei of BN sheets are weak because they only arise from B atoms located at the edge of BN sheets. Figure S6 compare the D-HMQC spectra of DFNS/BN before and after catalysis. The spectrum of DFNS/BN after catalysis exhibits a broad correlation between the 11B signal at 14 ppm ascribed to BO3 sites and a 1H signal centered at 5 ppm. This 1H isotropic chemical shift corresponds to that of BO2OH sites on the surface of the oxidized h-BN phase. The D-HMQC spectrum of as-prepared DFNS/B2O3 (Figure 7b) is dominated by a correlation between BO3 units and the 1H signal ranging from 2.3 to 4 ppm, which is assigned to BO2OH sites with second neighbors, B or Si, as well as silanol groups near BO3 moieties. (12−14,43−45) The comparison of Figures S6b and 7b confirms the higher chemical shifts of BO2OH protons in DFNS/BN after catalysis than as-prepared DFNS/B2O3. This shift could stem from a higher fraction of hydrogen-bonded BO2OH sites. A cross-peak between the 1H signal at 1.7 ppm of isolated silanol and BO3 signal is also visible. Hence, the 11B–{1H} D-HMQC spectrum confirms the close proximity between the silica surface and the boron atoms.
1D 1H → 29Si cross-polarization under MAS (CP MAS) experiments were also performed on DFNS/BN, DFNS/BN after catalysis, and as-prepared DFNS/B2O3 (see Figure 6c,f,i). Spectral fitting was carried out using DMFit (55) (with a Gaussian/Lorentzian model) in order to identify the individual species present. Detailed information on these fits can be found in the Supporting Information (Figure S7 and Table S1). The spectra of all three samples show the presence of Si(SiO)n(OH)4–n sites (denoted Qn) with n = 2, 3, and 4, characteristic of silica-type materials. (35,56,57) The spectrum of as-prepared DFNS/BN also displays a broad shoulder in the region attributable to SiNnO4–n sites with n = 1, 2, or 3 (Figures 6a and S7a) because the SiN3O, SiN2O2, and SiNO3 sites resonate at ca. −63, −75, and −90 ppm, respectively. (58−63) This signal indicates the presence of Si–N bonds in this material. The spectrum of DFNS/BN after catalysis reveals that primarily Q4 species remain in this sample, indicating that most of the Si–OH surface groups have been consumed or transformed, likely as a result of the catalytic reaction process. (64) This reduced amount of surface hydroxyls also leads to a lower efficiency of the CP transfer and hence, lower signal-to-noise ratio for this sample, despite the collection of a larger number of transients. (65,66) The shoulder centered at ca. −73 ppm (attributed to SiNnO4–n sites) is also no longer visible after catalysis, in agreement with the conversion of BN into B2O3 inferred from PXRD, XPS, and 11B NMR.
To further probe the interactions between the silica surface and the supported BN and B2O3 phases, we recorded 2D 11B–{29Si} D-HMQC spectra. The corresponding spectrum of as-prepared DFNS/BN shown in Figure 7c is dominated by a cross-peak between the Q4 site and the BO3 signal at ∼12 ppm assigned to B(OSi)x(OB)3–x environments with x = 1, 2, or 3. (12,14,45,49) These B(OSi(Q4))x(OB)3–x sites mainly corresponds to the subsurface region of the material. The spectrum also exhibits cross-peaks between the Q4 and Q3 site and the BO3 signal at ∼14 ppm as well as between the Q3 sites and the BO3 signal at ∼16 ppm, which are assigned to surface sites B(OSi(Q3,4))x(OB)2–xOH with x = 1 or 2 and BOSi(Q3)(OH)2, respectively. (14,45,49) We also observe cross-peaks between the BO4 signal at ∼0 ppm and the Q3 sites as well as the BO4 signal at ∼−2 ppm and the Q4 sites. The cross-peak of the BIV signal at ∼0 ppm can be ascribed to the surface B(OSi(Q3))x(OB)3–xOH site with x = 1, 2, or 3, whereas the cross-peak of the BIV signal at ∼−2 ppm can be ascribed to the subsurface B(OSi(Q4))x(OB)4–x sites with x = 1, 2, 3, or 4. (13,54) These cross-peaks between BO3 and BO4 signals and those of Q4 and Q3 sites demonstrate the presence of B–O–Si bonds in the as-prepared DFNS/BN. Furthermore, the BN2OH signal at 26 ppm correlates with that of SiN2O2 site at −73 ppm. We can also observe a weak cross-peak between the BNO2 sites at 23.5 ppm and the SiNO3 signal at −93 ppm. (38,59,61,63) These cross-peaks suggest the presence of B–N–Si bonds in the sample. The 2D 11B–{29Si} D-HMQC spectrum of DFNS/B2O3 (Figure 7d) is dominated by cross-peaks between the BO2OH signal at ∼14 ppm and the Q4 and Q3 sites, which suggests the anchoring of B2O3 phase on the silica surface via B–O–Si bonds. (12)
To better resolve the 11B signals, we also acquired 2D 11B multiple-quantum MAS (MQMAS) spectra of as-prepared DFNS/BN and DFNS/B2O3 (Figure 7e,f) and DFNS/BN after catalysis (see Figure S8). These spectra correlate the anisotropic MAS spectra of the 11B central transitions shown along the direct δ2 dimension to their isotropic shift detected along the indirect δ1 dimension. The projection along the vertical isotropic direction indicates that each of the three 11B sites has a wide distribution of δiso values, which stems from the distribution of local environments, as the second neighbor of boron atoms can be B, Si, or H. (44,49)
In order to obtain detailed insights into the distinct functional groups that were present in the boron surface layers, spectral fitting of the line shapes in the F1 dimension of the acquired MQMAS spectra was performed using DMFit. (55) Because the F1 dimension of an MQMAS spectrum presents resonances that are free from the effects of quadrupolar broadening, (31,55) it was possible for a Gaussian/Lorentzian model to be employed. The simulated spectra are shown in Figures S9–S11. Table S2 lists the shifts, δ1, along the indirect dimension of the sheared MQMAS spectra of the simulated peaks for the three investigated samples. Because of the significant overlap of sites in these MQMAS spectra, fitting of the total line shapes to obtain δiso and CQ/PQ values with a sufficient degree of accuracy was not possible.
In the 2D MQMAS spectrum of as-prepared DFNS/BN, three peaks at δ1 = 30.5, 28.6, and 27.2 ppm can be resolved in the most deshielded signals. The peak at 30.5 ppm is assigned to bulk BN3 sites, whereas the signals at 28.6 and 27.2 ppm are likely produced by BN2OH and BN2O sites, respectively, located at the edge of BN sheets because the 11B chemical shift increases for decreasing number of bridging oxygen atoms. (38,53,67) The BNO2 signal may not be detected because of the lack of sensitivity of MQMAS experiments. The BO3 signal can be simulated by three peaks at δ1 = 18.4, 17.2, and 16.3 ppm assigned to BO2OH (ring), BO2OH (nonring), and BO3 (ring), respectively, because for the same number of bridging oxygens, 11B nuclei residing in boroxol rings exhibit more deshielded signals as compared to those in the chain. (12,53,67) BO3 (nonring) sites resonating at δ1 ≈ 14 ppm (see below) can also contribute to the signal at δ1 = 16.3 ppm. Furthermore, according to the 2D 11B–{29Si} D-HMQC spectrum, a fraction of the BO3 moieties are anchored to the silica surface. In particular, the peak at δ1 = 18.4 ppm subsumes the signal of BOSi(Q3)(OH)2 and B(OSi(Q3,4))x(OB)2–xOH surface sites, whereas the signal of B(OSi(Q4))x(OB)4–x sites also overlaps with those of BO2OH (nonring) and BO3 (ring) environments. The BO4 signal can be deconvoluted as the sum of three peaks at δ1 = 0.1, −1, and −1.9 ppm, which may be ascribed to B(OSi(Q3))x(OB)3–xOH, B(OB)4 and B(OSi(Q4))x(OB)4–x sites, respectively (Figure S9c), based on the 2D 11B–{1H} and 11B–{29Si} D-HMQC spectra (see Figure 7a,c).
As seen in Figure S10, the BO3 signal in the projection of the 2D MQMAS spectrum of DFNS/B2O3 can be simulated as the sum of five components resonating at δ1 = 20.5, 19, 17.2, 15.8, and 14.4 ppm, assigned to BO(OH)2, BO2OH (ring), BO2OH (nonring), BO3 (ring), and BO3 (nonring), respectively. (12,53,67) The projection also displays a folded BO4 signal, which can be simulated as a single resonance. For DFNS/BN after catalysis, the BO3 signal in the projection of the 2D MQMAS spectrum can be simulated as the sum of five components at δ1 = 21.1, 19.1, 17.1, 15.7, and 14.1 ppm (see Figure S11). These shifts are similar to those used to simulate the BO3 signal of as-prepared DFNS/B2O3. The BO4 signal of DFNS/BN after catalysis can also be simulated as a single resonance. A key difference between DFNS/B2O3 and DFNS/BN after catalysis is the larger relative intensities of BO(OH)2 and BO2OH (ring) sites as compared to BO3 (ring) for the latter sample, which is consistent with the larger amount of hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups attached to B for this material (see above). (13,14) This structural difference could explain the difference in productivity between DFNS/BN after catalysis and DFNS/B2O3. Table 2 summarizes the main plausible local environments, which have been identified in the investigated samples on the basis of solid-state NMR data.

Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In conclusion, we observed that DFNS/BN displayed higher catalytic activity compared to unsupported h-BN, V–SiO2, and BOS-10 in terms of conversion and productivity of olefin. DFNS/B2O3 also showed higher activity for propane ODH but lower propene productivity. The catalytic activity of DFNS/BN depends on a complex interplay between the types and the concentrations of catalytic sites. Increased reactivity is due to Si–O–B bonding (prevents leaching of boron from silica surface), fibrous morphology (provided better diffusion), and the textural properties (high SA and PV).
Through a combination of analytical techniques (PXRD, XPS, and multinuclear solid-state NMR spectroscopy), we have shown that the supported BN phase is oxidized to B2O3 during the propane dehydrogenation process. In our case, we did not observe any deactivation of DFNS/B2O3 up to 19 h because of the stabilizing effect of DFNS through covalent linkage of silica and B2O3via Si–O–B bonding, the presence of which was confirmed by solid-state NMR spectroscopy. This allowed B2O3 to remain on the DFNS surface and act as a catalyst, albeit with a more moderate selectivity than DFNS/BN. Furthermore, solid-state NMR spectra indicate that oxidized DFNS/BN exhibits a larger amount of hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl groups attached to B than as-prepared DFNS/B2O3. This structural difference could explain the higher selectivity toward propene of oxidized DFNS/BN.

        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
