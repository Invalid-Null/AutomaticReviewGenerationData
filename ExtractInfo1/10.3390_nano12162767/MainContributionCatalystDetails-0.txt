 Unfortunately, the provided document extracts do not contain enough detailed and coherent information for me to synthesize a comprehensive summary in the requested XML format. The extracts indicate the document discusses magnesium vanadium oxide materials as potential cathode materials for rechargeable batteries, with passing mentions of propane dehydrogenation, but do not provide substantive details on catalyst composition, performance metrics, reaction conditions, or other key parameters. 

Without more complete and aligned information from the source document, I am unable to reliably fill out the different sections of the template or identify the primary scientific contribution and performance enhancements. I would need more complete excerpts from the original document focused specifically on the propane dehydrogenation research and results to populate the template fields accurately. The current extracts are too fragmented and lack the core details needed for a cohesive summary. I apologize that I cannot provide the requested structured output given the limited information provided in the document extracts. Please let me know if you are able to provide more comprehensive and targeted excerpts from the propane dehydrogenation study.
