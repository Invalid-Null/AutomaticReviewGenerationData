 Unfortunately, the multiple document extracts provided do not contain sufficient details to comprehensively populate the requested XML template for propane dehydrogenation research. The extracts indicate the documents discuss magnesium vanadium oxide materials as cathode materials for aqueous magnesium ion batteries, but do not provide concrete details on conversion, selectivity, stability, yields, feed composition, reaction conditions, or other metrics relevant to evaluating propane dehydrogenation performance. 

Since the provided extracts do not contain the key details needed to summarize the scientific contribution for propane dehydrogenation, I am unable to synthesize the information into a cohesive XML output. If more complete extracts containing the necessary propane dehydrogenation data are available, I would be happy to aggregate them into the requested unified XML structure. But with the currently supplied information, I cannot reliably populate the template fields. Please provide more substantive propane dehydrogenation extracts if you would like me to synthesize the XML output.
