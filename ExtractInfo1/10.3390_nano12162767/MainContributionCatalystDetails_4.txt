 provided document discusses oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using magnesium vanadium oxide catalysts. However, it does not contain sufficient details related to propane dehydrogenation to fill out the requested template. The document focuses on the synthesis and characterization of the magnesium vanadium oxide materials as cathode materials for rechargeable aqueous magnesium ion batteries. It does not provide details on conversion, selectivity, stability, propane production rate, propylene yield, feed composition, propane partial pressure, reaction temperature, inlet flow rate, catalyst loading, or other relevant metrics for evaluating propane dehydrogenation performance. As such, I am unable to extract the requested information to populate the template.
