Probing the surface of γ-Al2O3 by oxygen-17 dynamic nuclear polarization enhanced solid-state NMR spectroscopy†
γ-Al2O3 is an important catalyst and catalyst support of industrial interest. Its acid/base characteristics are correlated to the surface structure, which has always been an issue of concern. In this work, the complex (sub-)surface oxygen species on surface-selectively labelled γ-Al2O3 were probed by 17O dynamic nuclear polarization surface-enhanced NMR spectroscopy (DNP-SENS). Direct 17O MAS and indirect 1H–17O cross-polarization (CP)/MAS DNP experiments enable observation of the (sub-)surface bare oxygen species and hydroxyl groups. In particular, a two-dimensional (2D) 17O 3QMAS DNP spectrum was for the first time achieved for γ-Al2O3, in which two O(Al)4 and one O(Al)3 bare oxygen species were identified. The 17O isotropic chemical shifts (δcs) vary from 56.7 to 81.0 ppm and the quadrupolar coupling constants (CQ) range from 0.6 to 2.5 MHz for the three oxygen species. The coordinatively unsaturated O(Al)3 species is characterized by a higher field chemical shift (56.7 ppm) and the largest CQ value (2.5 MHz) among these oxygen sites. 2D 1H → 17O HETCOR DNP experiments allow us to discriminate three bridging (Aln)-μ2-OH and two terminal (Aln)-μ1-OH hydroxyl groups. The structural features of the bare oxygen species and hydroxyl groups are similar for the γ-Al2O3 samples isotopically labelled by 17O2 gas or H217O. The results presented here show that the combination of surface-selective labelling and DNP-SENS is an effective approach for characterizing oxides with complex surface species.
Introduction
γ-Al2O3 is of great importance in heterogeneous catalysis, and it is widely applied either as a catalyst or support for alcohol dehydration, propane dehydrogenation, isomerization, alkylation and catalytic cracking reactions.1 The design and optimization of heterogeneous catalysts rely on the understanding of their structure–performance relationship. In the past few decades, considerable efforts have been devoted to studies of the structure and intrinsic properties of γ-Al2O3 by means of experiments and theoretical calculations.2–10 Particular attention has been paid to investigations of the surface chemistry of γ-Al2O3, which is still a big challenge. For example, the surface hydroxyl groups have been intensively studied; however, the determination of complex hydroxyl groups is difficult and to some extent under debate due to their complexity.11–16 On the other hand, the surface oxygen species that would impact the surface properties (such as acidity/basicity) and the local coordination environment of γ-Al2O3 are not well explored.
17O NMR can provide valuable information about the local environments of oxygen atoms in inorganic materials including zeolites, oxides and other oxygen containing materials.17–22 Since oxygen atoms could be exposed or terminated by hydrogen atoms on the material surface, 17O NMR is very attractive for studying the surface structure of alumina, which, however, has been rarely reported. One challenge is that the extremely low natural abundance of 17O nuclei (0.037%) usually requires isotopic enrichment for NMR investigations. Another difficulty for 17O NMR in oxide-based solids is that the quadrupolar interaction of 17O (I = 5/2) and the distribution of its NMR parameters due to disorder in the local structure usually hamper the analysis of oxygen species. Moreover, the broadening and overlapping 1D 17O signals often require spectral deconvolution and simulation to extract structural information, which will cause ambiguous and unconvincing assignments.23
17O isotopic enrichment is a common strategy for performing 17O solid-state NMR experiments, by which even 2D 17O 3QMAS and 1H → 17O HETCOR spectra with good quality can be obtained.23–25 It is noteworthy that the hydrothermal method typically used with H217O was often used to label these materials. As such, both the bulk and the surface of materials were highly 17O enriched. Understanding the surface oxygen species often entails surface-selective 17O enrichment.20,21,26,27 However, the relatively low concentration of surface-labelled oxygen hinders the acquisition of conventional 17O 2D MAS NMR experiments. Recently, the dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) technique was demonstrated to be one of the most revolutionary and promising approaches that could boost the NMR sensitivity by 2–3 orders of magnitude by polarization transfer from unpaired electrons of a radical polarizing agent to nuclear spins.28–30 In particular, the applications of DNP-surface-enhanced NMR spectroscopy (DNP-SENS) in solids enable the rapid and atom–molecule level characterization of the surface of various materials.31–42 By using 17O DNP-NMR, Griffin and co-workers demonstrated a dramatically enhanced signal to noise (S/N) ratio in water glycerol glass, which makes the heteronuclear correlation experiments possible as more than 6000-fold experimental time could be saved.43,4417O DNP NMR investigations of Mg(OH)2 and Ca(OH)2 compounds without isotopic labelling opened an avenue for 17O NMR characterization of natural abundant solid materials.37,45,46 For the surface oxygen species, Pruski and co-workers investigated the surface hydroxyl groups in mesoporous silica nanoparticles by 1H → 17O cross-polarization (CP) DNP NMR, where hydrogen-bonded and isolated surface silanols could be distinguished.47 Despite significant S/N gains being achieved on naturally abundant 17O samples by DNP, the sensitivity of 17O NMR for surface investigation is still not good enough, in particular, when multiple-dimensional 17O MAS NMR experiments are required. Most recently, surface-selective direct 17O DNP NMR was demonstrated on isotope-labelled CeO2 nanoparticles,26 on which different (sub-)surface sites were discriminated with high selectivity.
In this contribution, we show that 17O DNP-SENS coupled with 17O isotope enrichment can provide detailed structural information on the (sub-)surface oxygen species of γ-Al2O3. The oxygen sites with (hydroxyl groups) or without (bare oxygen) bonded protons were clearly differentiated by direct 17O and 1H → 17O CP DNP. Furthermore, well-resolved 2D 17O MQMAS and 1H → 17O HETCOR spectra were obtained within 1.6 hours, which allowed us to readily identify the (sub-) surface oxygen species.
Experimental
Sample pre-treatment
γ-Al2O3 (Aldrich, 99.99%) was calcined at 773 K for 18 hours under dry air and then transferred to a high vacuum (<10−6 Torr) for dehydration at 773 K for 12 hours. All the 17O labelling of γ-Al2O3 samples was carried out according to previously reported methods on oxides.48,49
Labelling by 17O2 gas
200 mg of dehydrated γ-Al2O3 was loaded into a glass tube in a glove box in which the water content inside is below 1 ppm under a N2 atmosphere. The glass tube was connected to a vacuum line degassing under vacuum (<10−5 Torr) for 1 hour and then about 0.08 mmol of 17O2 (17O, 70%) gas was introduced with liquid nitrogen cooling. The glass tube was then sealed with a flame and heated at 773 K for 24 hours. After heating, the sample was degassed under vacuum (<10−5 Torr) for 1 hour at room temperature. All the procedures should avoid the exposure of the sample to air and water. The obtained sample was denoted as γ-Al2O3(O).
Labelling by H217O
0.06 mmol of H217O (17O, 40%) was introduced into a glass tube containing 200 mg of pretreated and degassed γ-Al2O3 sample as described above on a vacuum line. The glass tube was then sealed with a flame and maintained at 723 K for 24 hours. Then, the sample was degassed under vacuum (<10−5 Torr) for 1 hour at room temperature. All the procedures should avoid the exposure of the sample to air and water. The obtained sample was denoted as γ-Al2O3(W).
The amount of 17O labelling can be roughly estimated. Taking 17O2 gas, for example, the total amount of 17O2 gas (17O, 70%) used is 0.08 mmol for 200 mg of alumina. Thus, the maximum labelled 17O atoms should be less than 3% with respect to the total oxygen atoms of the sample. As for the H217O treated sample, the 17O concentration is less than 1% of the total oxygen.
Sample preparation for DNP
All dehydrated samples were firstly ground into fine powders and diluted in a 16 mM solution of TEKPol in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TCE) prior to being packed into 3.2 mm o.d. sapphire rotors.50 The rotors were sealed and spun at room temperature using a vespel cap, filling with fine powders before cooling to a low temperature of 98.6 K.
Solid-state NMR experiments on a 400 MHz DNP-NMR spectrometer
All DNP-enhanced solid-state NMR experiments were performed on a commercial 9.4 T Bruker Avance III 400 MHz DNP spectrometer equipped with a 263 GHz gyrotron microwave system and a 3.2 mm triple-resonance low temperature MAS probe. The microwave power was set to maximize the DNP enhancement.
The Larmor frequencies of 1H and 17O are 400.58 MHz and 54.30 MHz, respectively. Single-pulse 1H MAS experiments were performed by using a π/2 pulse width of 2.8 μs and a recycle delay of 10 s. Single-pulse 17O MAS experiments were performed with continuous-wave (CW) 1H decoupling (ν1H ≈ 90 kHz) by using a selective π/2 pulse width of 11.5 μs and a recycle delay of 5 s. For the 1H → 17O CP experiments, the contact time was 220 μs and the recycle delay was 5 s. The magic angle spinning (MAS) speed was fixed at 12 kHz for all 1D NMR experiments. The chemical shifts were referenced to liquid H2O, which is 0 ppm for 17O and 4.8 ppm for 1H.
For the 2D 17O Z-filter 3QMAS experiments, the pulse durations were set to 4 and 2 μs for the first and the second pulses, respectively, with an RF field amplitude of ca. 60 kHz, and to 11.5 μs for the third “soft” π/2 pulse. 36 scans were accumulated for each of the 16 points in t1 dimensions with an increment time of 50 μs and a recycle delay of 10 s. Microwave irradiation was kept on during the whole experiment. The total time spent was 1.6 h. The spinning speed was 8 kHz.
For the 2D 1H → 17O HETCOR experiments, 32 scans were accumulated for each of the 32 points in t1 dimensions with an increment time of 50 μs and a recycle delay of 4 s at a spinning speed of 8 kHz. CW 1H decoupling with ν1H ≈ 90 kHz was applied during the 17O acquisition. The CP contact time was set to 370 us. Microwave irradiation was kept on during the whole experiment. The total experimental time was 1.2 h. The CP and HETCOR experiments were conducted with ν17O ≈ 31 kHz and ν1H,max ≈ 90 kHz with an 80% ramp-up 1H spin-lock pulse. We carefully optimized the CP condition by fixing the maximal RF field of the 1H spin-lock. The formula of the adiabaticity parameter defined by Vega is , where νQ = CQ/4S(2S − 1) and νR is the spinning speed. In our case, the CQ values of the 17O signals of hydroxyl sites cannot be obtained from 1D 17O and 2D 1H–17O HETCOR spectra, thus it is impossible to obtain the exact value of the adiabaticity parameter. Considering that 17O has one of the smallest quadrupole moments known and the mobility of the surface hydroxyl groups, we can, for example, deduce that the CQ value of 17O hydroxyl sites is less than 3 MHz based on our MQMAS NMR results on the bare oxygen species. Then, the adiabaticity parameter α should be larger than 1.07.
Conventional solid-state NMR experiments on an 800 MHz spectrometer
27Al solid-state NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 800 MHz spectrometer with a 4 mm H-X MAS probe. For the 27Al one-pulse experiment, a π/12 excitation pulse was used with a recycle delay of 2 s. For 1H → 27Al CP experiments, the contact time was 600 μs and the recycle delay was 1 s. The spinning speed was 14 kHz for the one-pulse experiment and 10 kHz for the CP experiment. The Larmor frequencies of 1H and 27Al are 800.36 and 208.54 MHz, respectively. The 27Al chemical shifts were referenced to 1 mol L−1 Al(NO3)3 at 0 ppm.
Conventional solid-state NMR experiments on a 400 MHz spectrometer
17O conventional solid-state NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance III 400 MHz spectrometer with a 3.2 mm H-X MAS probe. For the 17O one-pulse experiment, a selective π/2 excitation pulse was used with a recycle delay of 10 s. The spinning speed was set to 12 kHz.
Results and discussion
The 1H MAS DNP experiment was firstly conducted on dehydrated γ-Al2O3. A large enhancement factor of ca. 128 was achieved in the 1H DNP spectrum (microwave on) compared to that without microwave irradiation (Fig. S1, ESI†). Generally, polarization transfer can also occur directly from electron spins to 17O spins under the same conditions. As shown in Fig. 1a, a direct one-pulse 17O DNP NMR spectrum with a good S/N ratio was rapidly obtained with only 16 scans due to the efficient polarization from the electrons to the 17O nuclei. In order to probe the 17O labelling extent, conventional 17O MAS NMR without TEKPol and TCE was performed on γ-Al2O3(O) at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 1b, only very weak signals can be observed even after 2 days’ accumulation (16 000 scans). This indicates that the sample is only surface-selectively labelled with a low concentration of 17O atoms. In comparison, if both the bulk and the surface of materials were highly 17O enriched, high quality 1D and even 2D 17O NMR spectra could be obtained in several minutes to hours.24,51 This, however, makes it difficult to differentiate the surface sites and bulk sites. The 17O MAS NMR spectrum without adding radical and solvent is similar to that obtained by direct 17O DNP except for the large sensitivity enhancement. This is in accord with the very recent work of Grey,26 where the solvent has no or very little effect on the surface. The temperature (∼98 K) of the DNP experiment may affect the dynamics and the spin dynamics. This is evidenced by the broader 17O DNP spectrum compared with that acquired with the conventional 17O MAS NMR at room temperature, which could be due to the rapid relaxation time caused by the decreased mobility at the low temperature. Moreover, the naturally abundant γ-Al2O3 was examined by DNP, which shows very weak 17O NMR signals (Fig. 1d). Therefore, the combination of the surface selective labelling and DNP technique would enable in-depth exploration of the (sub-)surface oxygen species on γ-Al2O3.

The spinning speed was 12 kHz. A total of 16 (a), 16 000 (b), 480 and (c) 320 scans were accumulated.
Fig. 2b and d show the direct one-pulse 17O DNP NMR spectra on γ-Al2O3(O) and γ-Al2O3(W), in which a broad signal centered at ca. 59 ppm can be observed. However, almost no signal is observable on γ-Al2O3(O) without microwave irradiation even after 600 scans (Fig. 2a). According to a previous report,26 the polarization can reach up to about 3 layers below the top surface of CeO2 by direct 17O DNP. In order to probe the surface hydroxyl groups on γ-Al2O3, 1H → 17O CP DNP experiments were carried out, in which the electron polarization is firstly transferred to hydrogen and then to oxygen via CP, thus only the oxygen species in close proximity to protons, mainly from hydroxyl groups, are detectable on the surface of γ-Al2O3. Although CP can be used to enhance the sensitivity of the observed nuclei with low sensitivity, as shown in Fig. 1c, the 1H → 17O CP DNP does not yield any signal from the naturally abundant γ-Al2O3 sample. Thus, all the 1H → 17O CP DNP experiments were performed on the labelled samples. As shown in Fig. 2c, the 1H → 17O CP DNP spectrum of γ-Al2O3(O) exhibits up-field 17O signals (centered at ca. −1 ppm) as compared with the direct 17O DNP spectrum (Fig. 2b). They come from the surface hydroxyl groups. However, the concentration of these hydroxyl groups is too low to be detected by direct 17O DNP (Fig. 2b). The much higher sensitivity enhancement achieved by 1H → 17O CP DNP makes the observation of these hydroxyl groups possible. Note that the 17O signals at 59.0 ppm observed by direct 17O DNP are almost absent in the CP DNP spectra (Fig. 2c and e). The long distance or absence of the proton source in close proximity to the corresponding oxygen species may lead to a lower CP efficiency. Therefore, the surface hydroxyl groups can be clearly differentiated from the bare oxygen species. The direct 17O DNP and 1H → 17O CP DNP spectra of γ-Al2O3(W) treated at 723 K (Fig. 2d and e) are similar to those of γ-Al2O3(O) (Fig. 2b and c) with the signals centered at 59 and −1.0 ppm, respectively. Considering the low 17O isotopic labelling and the DNP-SENS approach used, all the oxygen species are most likely from the (sub-)surface of γ-Al2O3. Additionally, the results demonstrate that the intrinsic surface oxygen species do not exhibit considerable change upon the different labelling treatments.

Although different (sub-)surface oxygen species are observable on γ-Al2O3 by means of 17O DNP experiments, the poor resolution of the 1D 17O DNP NMR spectra caused by quadrupolar interactions and distributions of its chemical shift limits the extraction of structural information of the different oxygen sites. Benefiting from the remarkable gain in sensitivity by DNP-SENS, 2D 17O Z-filter 3QMAS experiments coupled with DNP were performed to further explore the surface oxygen species on γ-Al2O3. As shown in Fig. 3a, the 2D 17O Z-filter 3QMAS DNP spectrum with a high resolution was obtained on γ-Al2O3(O) within 1.6 h. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the 2D 17O 3QMAS NMR spectrum achieved for the surface species of γ-Al2O3. Three distinct oxygen sites are clearly resolved in the 2D spectrum. The NMR parameters including isotropic chemical shift (δcs) and second-order quadrupolar interaction parameter (PQ) of each oxygen species derived from the 3QMAS spectrum are listed in Table S1 (ESI†), on the basis of which the 17O MAS DNP spectrum can be simulated with different sites. The simulated spectra of three oxygen sites are shown in Fig. 3b and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 1.

Due to the low concentration of the surface hydroxyl groups as confirmed by the above 1D 17O NMR experiments, all the signals observed in the 2D 17O 3QMAS NMR spectrum should come from the bare oxygen species. According to a previous report,23 the signals with δF2 = 68.4 ppm (site 2) and 79.3 ppm (site 3) (apparent chemical shift along F2) can be assigned to the (sub-)surface O(Al)4 species. Theoretical calculations have indicated that the 17O NMR signal shifts to lower field with increased condensation of the coordinated Al, for example from tetra-coordinated to hexa-coordinated.53,54 Thus, site 3 may be due to the (sub-)surface oxygen of O(Al)4 consisting of more highly condensed Al atoms than that of site 2. Site 1 with δF2 = 48.0 ppm could be assigned to O(Al)3, which originates from anion vacancies or the coordinatively unsaturated Al moiety formed in the thermal treatment.23 The assignment is corroborated by its largest CQ value (2.5 MHz) among the three sites, indicative of the large asymmetric electric gradient field (EFG) experienced by this oxygen species. Note that there is no phase transition after the thermal treatments (Fig. S2, ESI†), thus all the three oxygen sites should belong to the (sub-)surface of γ-Al2O3. Although conventional 17O MQMAS experiments have been reported on amorphous alumina and γ-Al2O3,55 hitherto, the tri-coordinated oxygen species has not been observed. Our 3QMAS DNP experiment allows us to observe such an oxygen site on the (sub-)surface of γ-Al2O3. Additionally, two different crystallographic (sub-)surface O(Al)4 species were discriminated, which were previously observed as one site.23,55
Understanding the interaction between the support and supported metals is important to control the size and morphology of supported catalytically active phases. On γ-Al2O3 supported Pt catalysts, for example, the penta-coordinated Al site on the γ-Al2O3 support was proposed to be the primary anchoring site for active Pt species,56 forming a robust catalyst against the sintering process. Such a penta-coordinated Al was theoretically predicted to bond with the coordinatively unsaturated oxygen.56 Here, our results experimentally suggest the presence of coordinatively unsaturated oxygen (site 1) on the surface of γ-Al2O3, which most likely serves as the anchoring site for the introduced metals.
According to our 17O 2D 3QMAS experiment, there are at least three kinds of bare oxygen species present on the (sub-)surface of γ-Al2O3. In addition, we know from the 1H → 17O CP DNP results that oxygen species with bonded protons (hydroxyl groups) are present as well. Based on IR and 1H NMR experiments,4,13 three types of surface hydroxyl groups were previously suggested on γ-Al2O3, namely (Aln)-μ1-OH, (Aln)2-μ2-OH and (Aln)3-μ3-OH (n denotes tetra-coordinated, penta-coordinated or hexa-coordinated), although they are not well ascertained. More detailed and direct structural information about the hydroxyl groups could be obtained if both the associated oxygen atoms and protons could be detected and correlated.
Fig. 4 shows the 2D 1H → 17O HETCOR DNP spectra of γ-Al2O3, which allow not only the differentiation of bare oxygen species and hydroxyl groups, but also the establishment of nuclear spin connectivities among the different proton and oxygen atoms. Besides, the issue of broad and overlapped 1H signals that often appear for different hydroxyl groups in the conventional 1D 1H MAS NMR spectra can be overcome by the 2D 1H → 17O HETCOR experiment. As shown in Fig. 4a, at least five correlation peaks are clearly resolved in the 1H → 17O HETCOR DNP spectrum of the γ-Al2O3(O) sample. Radical (TEKPol) and solvent (1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane) were added onto the sample for the DNP experiment. Fig. 5 shows the 1H MAS NMR spectra of γ-Al2O3(O) with and without adding the radical and solvent. It can be seen that the addition of the radical and solvent produces a strong and broad signal at 5.9 ppm (Fig. 5a), while low field and broad signals centered at 1.3 ppm are observed on the samples without radical and solvent, which are due to the hydroxyl groups of γ-Al2O3. Note that the unlabelled and labelled samples show very similar 1H signals, indicative of the little influence of the labelling on the surface species. These results indicate that the observed 1H signals in the 2D 1H → 17O HETCOR spectrum come from the surface protons of γ-Al2O3 instead of either the solvent or the radical. The five correlation signals can be divided into two groups. The three low-field cross peaks at (2.5, 24.1), (1.3, 2.7) and (0.8, −21.3) ppm can be attributed to the bridging hydroxyl groups,13 (Aln)2-μ2-OH, in which the oxygen atom is connected to two Al atoms. To detect the Al atoms, the 27Al MAS NMR experiment was performed, which shows the presence of three kinds of Al, i.e., tetra-, penta- or hexa-coordinated, on the sample (Fig. S3a, ESI†). Additionally, the 1H → 27Al CP MAS NMR experiment was also conducted on the sample (Fig. S3b, ESI†). The observation of similar signals to those in the 27Al MAS NMR spectrum indicates the close spatial proximity between protons and these Aln (n denotes tetra-coordinated, penta-coordinated or hexa-coordinated) sites. The difference of the 17O chemical shifts in the three hydroxyl groups reflects the different magnetic shielding of oxygen caused by the neighbouring Al coordination sphere.54 Considering the large high-field 17O chemical shift, the additional two correlation peaks (0.7, −59.4) and (−0.2, −74.5) ppm can be assigned to two surface terminal hydroxyl groups: (Aln)-μ1-OH; less coordinated Al atoms shift the 17O signal of the hydroxyl group to a much higher-field. The (Aln)3-μ3-OH group that is expected to have a 1H chemical shift around 4.3 ppm is not observable in the 2D spectrum, implying that this species could be present in extremely low concentration provided it exists on the surface.13,57 The 2D 1H → 17O HETCOR DNP experiment was also performed on γ-Al2O3(W) (Fig. 3b). Five correlation peaks corresponding to different hydroxyl groups are observable, analogous to those of γ-Al2O3(O) (Fig. 3a). This indicates that the surface hydroxyl groups are similar on γ-Al2O3 treated by different labelling methods, consistent with the results obtained from the 1D MAS NMR experiments.

Fig. 6 summarizes the possible structures of all the (sub-)surface oxygen species on γ-Al2O3 including bare oxygen sites and hydroxyl groups. The bare oxygen species are observed by 1D 17O MAS DNP and clearly differentiated by the 17O 3QMAS DNP experiment. Although the oxygen sites on alumina can be easily detected on the labelled samples, it is difficult to differentiate the oxygen species from the broad 17O NMR signal that is often present in the 1D MAS NMR spectrum. On the other hand, due to the low natural abundance of 17O, the uniformly labelled sample is often used to facilitate 17O NMR observation. The oxygen sites in both the bulk and on the surface are equally detected, which hampers the determination of the location of the oxygen species. Here, the combination of surface labelling and MQMAS DNP-SENS allows us to obtain detailed information on the bare oxygen species of γ-Al2O3. These species are formed with bound Al atoms, which could have different second coordination spheres, from tetra-coordination to penta- and hexa-coordination. The coordinatively unsaturated oxygen site 1 is expected to be subject to bonding with loaded elements when γ-Al2O3 is used as a catalyst support. For the hydroxyl groups, both bridging and terminal species are observed by the 2D 1H → 17O HETCOR DNP experiments. The hydroxyl groups of alumina can be characterized by 1H NMR, which however produces overlapped signals even at a high magnetic field. In the work of Delevoye et al., the structures of the hydroxyl groups on γ-Al2O3 were revealed by two-dimensional homo- and heteronuclear 1H and 27Al NMR spectroscopy.13 Different hydroxyl groups show different spatial interactions between proton and aluminum. The detection of bound proton and oxygen would give direct information on the hydroxyl groups. Besides the three (Aln)2-μ2-OH and one Altetra-μ1-OH that were identified in the previous report,13 our 2D 1H → 17O HETCOR DNP enables the observation of a new type of terminal hydroxyl group (Alpenta-μ1-OH). This may benefit from the high sensitivity of oxygen to the coordination sphere. The 17O chemical shift exhibits a large difference for the different hydroxyl groups (>15 ppm), although their 1H chemical shift range is smaller than 3 ppm.

Conclusions
The complex (sub-)surface oxygen species on γ-Al2O3 that were surface-selectively labelled with 17O isotopes were probed by 1D and 2D 17O DNP-surface-enhanced NMR spectroscopy. The significant sensitivity enhancement allows us to perform fast 2D 17O 3QMAS and 1H → 17O HETCOR experiments, which provide valuable structural information about the (sub-)surface oxygen species on γ-Al2O3. Three bare oxygen species and five hydroxyl groups are identified. 17O isotropic enrichment is required for the observation of these surface species with DNP, but the labelling treatment by 17O2 gas or H217O does not change the structural features of the surface oxygen species. These surface species on γ-Al2O3 are the potential active sites for reactions or anchoring sites for metals.56,58 The active sites (so called defect sites) can be formed by the Lewis acid (tri-coordinated Al)–base (O) pairs on the metastable surface of γ-Al2O3. The presence of hydroxyl groups was predicted to stabilize and increase the reactivity of such pairs for the C–H and C–C activation of alkanes.9 Thus, the observation and identification of the bare oxygen and different hydroxyl groups would lead to further investigations on the locations and correlations of these species that would significantly impact the activity and properties of γ-Al2O3. To this end, the combination of surface-selective labelling and 2D DNP NMR would play an important role in characterizing surface species, particularly those in low concentration, on γ-Al2O3.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
