The provided document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of n-octane, which is a different process than propane dehydrogenation. Since the document is not relevant to PDH or ODH of propane specifically, I have indicated "No" for relevance and did not extract any catalyst details.
