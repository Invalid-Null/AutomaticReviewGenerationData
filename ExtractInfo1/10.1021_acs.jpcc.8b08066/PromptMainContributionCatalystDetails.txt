MOF-Derived Iron Catalysts for Nonoxidative Propane Dehydrogenation
Abstract
The dehydrogenation of light alkanes, sourced from cracking of traditional petrochemical feedstocks and from emerging shale gas, represents an attractive route to alkenes (ethene, propene, and butenes), which are the building blocks for valuable polymers and chemicals. Carbon-supported iron catalysts formed from pyrolysis of Fe-containing metal–organic frameworks (MOFs; Fe-BTC) are investigated here for propane dehydrogenation. The temperature of pyrolysis is found to influence the iron phase (oxide, metal, and carbide) and surface area of the material, but the high-temperature reduction and reaction conditions needed for propane dehydrogenation (500−600 °C) result in a metallic iron phase that is shown to be active and selective for propene formation, though differential isoconversion data indicate that the pyrolysis temperature affects the selectivity to propene. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction are utilized to investigate the catalyst state both pre- and post-reduction and reaction. This work demonstrates how using MOFs as precursors may allow the synthesis of useful and perhaps unique catalyst structures that can be designed to obtain desired rates and product selectivities of hydrocarbon processes.

ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Light alkenes (ethene, propene, and butenes) are vital building blocks within the chemical industry. (1) The increasing abundance and decreasing price of shale gas in North America provides an attractive alternative to traditional petrochemical feedstocks. If the ethane and propane found in shale gas are utilized in existing cracking technologies (currently based on naphtha), propene production would not meet the current demand. Thus, on-purpose propene production, such as catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH), is of interest.
Significant research has focused on catalysts based on Cr and Pt as well as alloys of these metals and other metal oxides. (2−21) The industrial Cr and Pt catalysts, while being components of highly effective technologies, still have disadvantages such as significant deactivation due to coke formation, which requires intensive catalyst regeneration protocols. The selectivity and stability of catalysts for PDH, in both oxidative and nonoxidative pathways, are pertinent in designing new, less expensive materials because several undesired side reactions, like hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and coke formation, can occur. Thus, alternative catalysts comprised of nonprecious metals that do not compromise reactivity and selectivity but offer increased stability can lead to substantial impact in the field of propene production via PDH due to the large-scale need.
Iron-based catalysts have been demonstrated as potential candidates for PDH, especially for oxidative PDH using various oxidants (O2, N2O, and CO2). (22−25) Investigations of nonoxidative PDH for iron catalysts have included Fe-substituted ZSM-5, (26) Fe2O3 supported on sulfated Al2O3, (27) Fe catalysts supported on Al2O3 modified with phosphate species, (28) and silica-supported isolated Fe2+ species. (29)
Recently, a method for synthesizing small, relatively uniform iron-based nanoparticles via the pyrolysis of Fe-containing metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) has been reported. (30) During pyrolysis, the metal ion nodes migrate to form clusters, and the organic linkers rearrange to form a carbon shell/support. This method can access various classes of supported iron, such as metal, oxide, and carbide (as well as different phases within those subclasses), making them attractive for the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, where they have been shown as active and stable catalysts at 340 °C. (30−33) The temperature of pyrolysis was found to influence the iron–carbide phase and the size of the nanoparticles formed. In this study, we utilize iron-containing MOFs (specifically Fe-BTC) as scaffolds to synthesize catalysts for PDH and investigate how these materials respond to the higher-temperature reaction conditions needed for PDH (500–600 °C). We have found that the reactivity and selectivity of these MOF-derived iron catalysts are dependent on the temperature of pyrolysis and reaction and correlate these results to differences in iron speciation or structure as determined from various characterization techniques. These MOF-derived catalysts represent promising materials for PDH because they are (i) based on a cheaper and more abundant metal than current commercial dehydrogenation catalysts, (ii) have high iron loadings without compromising surface area, and (iii) do not deactivate (when reduced) as readily as other supported dehydrogenation catalysts, due to the carbon shell around the active center.

2.1. Synthesis of MOF-Mediated Catalysts (FeC)
Fe nanoparticles embedded in a porous carbon matrix were produced by the pyrolysis of Fe-BTC (iron-1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate), which was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Basolite F-300). Pyrolysis of Fe-BTC was carried out in a quartz tubular reactor (approximately L = 1.0 m × ID = 5.0 cm) located horizontally in a ceramic fiber oven where around 1.0 g of the MOF was placed in a quartz crucible and subjected to heat treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere (500 sccm). The temperature was ramped at 2 °C/min to 400, 500, 600, and 700 °C and held for 8 h. Before exposure to ambient conditions, samples were passivated at room temperature by inducing an air leak in the flowing N2 stream for 2 h. The synthesized catalysts are denoted by “FeC_T,” with T representing the pyrolysis temperature in °C.
2.2. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured with an X’pert Pro X-ray diffractometer from PANalytical with nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å), with generator settings of 45 kV and 40 mA. A scanning region of 3–100° with a scanning step size of 0.026° was used. Textural properties were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms carried out with a Tristar II 3020 from Micromeritics. About 0.1 g of sample was degassed under vacuum and preheated at 120 °C for 12 h on a Schlenk line before the measurement. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Netzsch STA409PG TGA by combustion. Mass loss from 123 to 900 °C under a flow of nitrogen-diluted air was recorded to calculate Fe loading on the carbon-matrix catalysts assuming the Fe2O3 phase residual mass. The reducibility of Fe-based catalysts was studied by H2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) with Autochem II Chemisorption Analyzer from Micromeritics. About 0.20 g of sample was loaded in a quartz tube and was preheated to 120 °C for 1 h in a 50 sccm Ar flow, followed by cooling to 50 °C. Then, 30 sccm of a 10 vol % H2/Ar was introduced while heating to 900 °C with a ramp of 5 °C/min. The signal was recorded by a thermal conductivity detector. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a FEI Tecnai G2 F30 transmission electron microscope operating at 300 kV. The well-dispersed catalyst suspension in H2O was dropped onto a Lacey carbon-coated copper grid and dried in ambient air for sample preparation.
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was carried out 12-BM-B at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory) with a Rh focusing mirror and Si⟨111⟩ monochromator. An iron metal foil and third X-ray detector were placed in the beam path beyond the transmission detector to allow acquisition of a reference spectrum concurrent with each sample measurement. Use of a custom-built reactor cell with a six-port sample holder housed within a quartz tube that was sealed by Kapton windows and O-rings, allowing multiple samples to be examined by XAS without exposure to air. The catalysts were pretreated at 600 °C in 50 sccm 4% H2/He flow for 1 h followed by purging in a 100 sccm He flow for 30 min. For in situ measurements, 50 sccm 3% C3H8/He was flowed over pretreated samples at 550 °C for different 3 h, followed by measurement at room temperature. To facilitate data analysis, X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) reference spectra were collected of FeO, Fe3O4, Fe2O3, and bulk Fe3C. The extended X-ray adsorption fine structure (EXAFS) data were processed using Athena software for background removal, postedge normalization, and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analysis.
2.3. Catalytic Measurements
Propane dehydrogenation was carried out using a U-shaped quartz reactor of ca. 1/8-in. diameter and ca. 80 cm length. The catalyst (0.03–0.1 g) was loaded onto a quartz wool bed in air at room temperature, and the quartz reactor with catalyst was loaded into a National Electric Furnace series FA 120. The catalyst was then purged with N2 (Airgas, UHP) for 10 min at room temperature with a flow rate of 20 sccm before any temperature ramp. The reactor was then heated to the desired temperature at 5 °C/min under either N2 at 20 sccm or 10% H2 in N2 at 20 sccm, depending on whether a reduction step was tested. Once the temperature reached the desired temperature, the H2 flow was maintained for 1–3 h at a flow rate of 20 sccm. Next, the sample was purged with 20 sccm N2 for at least 10 min before introduction of the reactant gas (C3H8 balanced with N2). The hydrocarbon products as well as H2 were analyzed via online gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014) equipped with a RESTEK Column (Rt-Alumina BOND/Na2SO4, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 4 μm), a flame ionization detector, and a thermal conductivity detector. The carbon mass balance was calculated for every time point collected.

3.1. Structural and Textural Properties of Iron Catalysts Synthesized at Different Pyrolysis Temperatures
Pyrolysis of the metal organic frameworks (MOFs) results in a rearrangement of the constituent atoms and a collapse of the highly microporous structure, leaving a metal-based nanoparticle (in this case, iron) on a carbon support (TEM in Figure 1). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas, measured from N2 physisorption, and the iron-weight loading measured from combustion thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) for the as-received, commercially available Fe-BTC and the series of materials synthesized from different pyrolysis temperatures are included in Table 1. TGA curves are shown in Figure 2, whereas the isotherms are found in the Supporting Information (SI) (Figure S1 for samples pyrolyzed at 400, 500, 600, and 700 °C). The synthesized catalysts are denoted by “FeC_T,” with T representing the pyrolysis temperature in °C. FeC_400a was synthesized using a smaller vertical reactor, whereas FeC_400 and all other samples were synthesized using a larger horizontal reactor with 10× the loaded mass as the smaller reactor. The lower measured surface area and iron loading in FeC_400a compared to FeC_400 are consistent with different residence times of the inert gas during pyrolysis in the two reactors. These samples indicate that materials processing, via different reactor configurations, can lead to different materials, which highlights the challenge of working with these decomposition-based catalyst syntheses. The two examples are included here to call attention to these differences. The (larger) horizontal reactor was utilized for the majority of the samples, as it allowed larger batches to be synthesized.

The iron content was similar (∼55 wt %) for all samples synthesized in the horizontal furnace despite different pyrolysis temperatures (Table 1). The TGA profiles vary, though, as the FeC_600 and FeC_700 samples show an increase in mass in the temperature range of 150–500 °C (Figure 2). The differences between the samples pyrolyzed at the lower temperatures (FeC_400 and FeC_500) and those at the higher temperatures (FeC_600 and FeC_700) are consistent with the different phases of iron in these materials, as is discussed below with XRD data. The FeC_600 and FeC_700 samples are predominately carbidic and metallic iron after pyrolysis, and these species undergo an exothermic phase transition to iron oxide. The measured surface areas for all MOF-derived materials are lower than that of the parent MOF, consistent with the collapse of the ordered microporous structure. The surface area of the FeC_T samples has a maximum in the series for the FeC_600 sample, corresponding to 310 m2/g. This difference in surface area is indicative of a carbon support that is more amorphous at lower pyrolysis temperatures but becomes more ordered as the temperature increases. In fact, a peak appears in the XRD (Figure 3a) for the FeC_600 and FeC_700 samples at 2θ value of ∼26°, consistent with the (002) surface of graphite.
Figure 3
Figure 3. (a) XRD patterns of the FeC_T materials pyrolyzed at 400, 500, 600, and 700 °C and (b) simulated XRD patterns for Fe2O4 and Fe3C.
The phase of the iron species was probed using ex situ XRD after pyrolysis (and a passivation in dilute O2). Pyrolysis of Fe-BTC at either 400 or 500 °C resulted in predominately Fe2O3, as indicated by simulated XRD reference patterns (Figure 3b). The relative heights of the peaks at 2θ values of 33 and 36° as well as the small peak at 41° suggest the presence of FeO. The multiple peaks centered near 2θ values of 45° for the samples pyrolyzed at 600 and 700 °C are consistent with Fe3C. These phase distributions as a function of temperature are slightly different than those reported previously; (31) specifically, pyrolysis at 600 °C does not result in Fe metal. This is most likely due to a difference in pyrolysis reactors, as previously seen within our own measurements.
The reduction profile of each catalyst was investigated through TPR to gather information about the catalyst under an H2 atmosphere (Figure 4). The profiles of the catalysts show different features but in general demonstrate a two-step reduction: one at lower temperatures between 200 and 400 °C and one at higher temperatures between 400 and 750 °C. The low-temperature peaks for the FeC_400 and FeC_500 samples are consistent with Fe2O3 phases reducing to Fe3O4/FeO. The broad, high-temperature peak is associated with the reduction of these iron oxide species to metallic Fe. (34) The slightly broader first peak and its shift to higher temperatures for the FeC_600 sample corresponds to the presence a carbide phase, as evidenced by the TPR profile of bulk Fe3C (Figure S2). These variances in H2 uptakes agree with the phases determined by XRD and indicate the ability to tune the structural and textural properties via pyrolysis temperature; the effects of these changes on the catalytic performance will be addressed next.

3.2. Propane Dehydrogenation on MOF-Derived Iron Catalysts
The MOF-derived catalysts were investigated for their reactivity and selectivity during PDH at 550–575 °C (after reduction at 600 °C in H2). Several side reactions (Scheme 1) can occur at these high temperatures, such as (thermal) cracking to methane and ethene, hydrogenolysis (with the H2 produced in situ from dehydrogenation events) to crack to methane and ethane, or coking. All of these side reactions increase the cost of downstream separation and catalyst regeneration, so mitigating them is key for the practical applicability of a material. The selectivities to these thermal reactions were shown using a blank reactor (Figure S3) and are different than the measured catalytic selectivities discussed below.
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Reactions of Propane at Elevated Temperatures
Propane consumption turnover rates (normalized by total Fe) are proportional to propane pressure (Figure 5a for FeC_600) under differential conditions consistent with a monomolecular surface reaction occurring on the catalyst surface that is void of significant reactant or product-derived species. This form of a rate expression would also indicate that alkene products do not significantly take place in further surface-catalyzed conversion events to higher-molecular-weight molecules, which agrees with the dearth of aromatic species. The selectivity to propene is independent of propane pressure (Figure S4a) but is dependent on catalyst residence time (Figure S4b). The selectivity to C1–C2 species increases at long residence times, which indicates that some pathways for their formation go through a propene-derived intermediate. These additional cracking pathways can both be thermal and catalytic. However, Figure 5b shows that for a given pressure and residence time, the FeC_600 catalyst exhibited stable propene selectivity for ∼50 h, which is desirable. The carbon balance and hydrogen production for this extended run are included in the SI (Figure S5). Further, the carbon balance and propene selectivity remain high even at higher conversions (∼20%; Figure S6).
Figure 5
Figure 5. (a) Propane consumption turnover rate (normalized per total mol Fe) as a function of propane pressure and (b) product selectivity at 5 kPa C3H8 for long times on stream for FeC_600. Reaction conditions: reduction at 600 °C in 20 sccm H2 for 10.8 ks; reaction at 550 °C in 0.5–4 sccm C3H8 in N2; 30 mg catalyst (FeC_600; 55 wt % Fe).
The performance of the MOF-derived catalysts synthesized using different pyrolysis temperatures was also examined and compared to that of bulk Fe3C. Figure 6 shows the propene selectivity and the carbon balance at differential isoconversion (5%) for the FeC_T samples. Propene selectivity increases with increasing pyrolysis temperature but is similar for FeC_600 and FeC_700. The differences in propene selectivity between FeC_400a and FeC_400, 0.38 and 0.61 fractional selectivity, respectively, suggest a concomitant effect of the catalyst surface area, iron-weight loading, and phase of iron. The carbon balance for the FeC_400–600 samples is near unity but decreases for FeC_700. This carbon is most likely lost as coke deposits on the catalyst surface, which is consistent with the more rapid deactivation on this sample compared to FeC_600 (Figure S7). The Fe3C bulk sample had low propene selectivity and carbon balance, as expected, but was used as a general comparison.

The structural differences in these materials are discussed in Section 3.1, and their different catalytic activities are evident in Figure 6; thus, XAS was utilized to further probe the catalyst to gain an understanding how and why they behave differently.
3.3. XAS Investigation to Determine Active Structure
The MOF-derived catalysts were first reduced under H2 at 600 °C before reaction. The TPR profiles (Figure 4), along with well-known reducibility of iron, would suggest a metallic-like phase during reaction. Thus, the catalysts were investigated using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Fe k-edge (ca. 7112 eV) to determine their properties during and after reduction as well as after reaction. In particular, the oxidation state and coordination environment of Fe were characterized by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray adsorption fine structure (EXAFS), respectively.
The XANES data for FeC_400–600 samples prior to H2 reduction as well as for the Fe2O3 reference are shown in Figure 7a. The pre-edge energy of the 3d orbital transition for the FeC_400–500 samples was similar to that of Fe2O3, indicating the presence of Fe(III) species, consistent with the XRD data (Figure 3a). FeC_600 did not exhibit this distinct pre-edge feature but instead had a shoulder, which increased in intensity under H2 with increasing temperature as the white line decreased (Figure 7b). After H2 reduction, the pre-edge feature for FeC_400 and FeC_500 disappeared, and all materials appeared metallic (Figure 7c). This reduction of the Fe3C phase is consistent with ex situ XRD analysis after reduction of 1 and 3 h (Figure S8) and also appears to occur for the FeC_400–500 samples that were initially Fe2O3.
Figure 7
Figure 7. Fe k-edge XANES spectra of FeC_T samples, bulk Fe3C, and references (Fe2O3 and Fe foil) (a) in He at room temperature before reduction, (b) in H2 during reduction with increasing temperature (FeC_600), and (c) in He at room temperature after reduction in H2 for 2.5 h at 600 °C.
Figure 7a is replotted as Figure 8a to show the direct comparison to the R spaces of the EXAFS spectra for the samples before reduction (Figure 8b). Before the reduction, the strongest signal for FeC_400–500 samples was at ∼1.4 Å, which is associated with the Fe–O bond. This peak disappeared after H2 pretreatment with a concomitant appearance of a strong peak at ∼2.2 Å, indicating the formation of metallic Fe domains and fewer iron oxide species (Figure S9). FeC_600 had a peak ∼1.5 Å before reduction (Figure 8b), which is characteristic of Fe–C bonds. Further, the Fe–Fe peak appears at lower radial distances than that in Fe metal. After reduction, this Fe–Fe peak shifts to ∼2.2 Å, and the Fe–C peak disappears. This represents further evidence for the transformation of the precursors to metallic Fe after the high-temperature reduction.
Figure 8
Figure 8. Fe k-edge XANES spectra (a) and magnitude of the Fourier transform of the EXAFS spectra (b) of FeC_T samples, bulk Fe3C, and references (Fe2O3 and Fe foil) in He at room temperature before reduction or reaction. Fe k-edge XANES spectra (c) and magnitude of the Fourier transform of the EXAFS spectra (d) after reduction in H2 for 2.5 h at 600 °C and after reaction in 3 kPa C3H8 (balance He) for 2 h at 550 °C.
The XANES data for all samples look similar to each other and similar to the Fe foil after propane dehydrogenation (Figure 8c), as do the R spaces of the EXAFS (Figure 8d). Ex situ XRD patterns of the samples after reaction in a traditional flow reactor also indicate the formation and stability of the metallic Fe phase after reaction (Figure S10). The only exception is the small feature in the FeC_600 sample after reaction, which is near 1.5 Å and that is attributed to Fe–C. Further, the ex situ postreaction XRD for this sample shows a broadening around 2θ values of 45°, which is the region where Fe [110] and Fe3C peaks overlap; this broadening was not evident in the XRD pattern after reduction. These data suggest that this material may form small carbide domains during reaction. However, the carbon balance as well as the long-term stability do not indicate the deposition of C-atoms from propane or its subsequent products. Thus, a local restructuring of the carbon support and incorporation of these carbon atoms into the nanoparticles could be occurring.
These results indicate that the majority of the iron phase in these catalysts remains metallic and selective for PDH, however, iron oxide, metal, carbide all may be active. Prior work by this group (28) showed that iron-phosphorous precatalysts on Al2O3 formed Fe2O3 (when synthesized in a 3Fe/P ratio), which was converted to metallic iron after reduction in H2 at 600 °C. Within the first 30 min of reaction, measured propene formation was low despite propane consumption and hydrogen formation. Ex situ XRD suggested that Fe3C was formed and was the more active and stable phase using that catalyst composition. It is postulated that the presence of P and alumina in that case affected the phase stability, whereas the carbon support in this work stabilizes the metallic iron phase. Sustained activity of metallic iron supported on carbon was also demonstrated by others for isobutane dehydrogenation. (35)
To further explore the reactivity of different iron domains in these materials, the reactivity of these other iron speciations was tested using the unreduced materials. As shown in Figure 3 (and Figure 7a), these materials are either iron oxide (predominately Fe2O3: FeC_400 and FeC_500) or iron carbide (FeC_600 and FeC_700). Data from Figure S11 indicate that although these materials do have higher selectivity to propene formation than their reduced analogs, they are not as stable. They deactivate significantly even at the differential conditions utilized in these studies, which is consistent with a lower carbon balance for all times on stream. These results indicate that multiple phases of iron are in fact active for propane dehydrogenation to propene, but materials with predominantly metallic iron are the most stable using the catalyst compositions described here.
4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Carbon-supported iron catalysts formed from pyrolysis of Fe-containing metal organic frameworks (MOFs; Fe-BTC) were investigated for nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation. The phase of the supported iron (oxide, metal, carbide) and surface area of the material were affected by the temperature of pyrolysis. However, the high-temperature reduction and reaction conditions needed for PDH (500–600 °C) result in a predominantly metallic iron phase, as shown from X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), that appears active for propene formation. Further, this active catalyst remains stable for propene formation for >48 h. This work demonstrates how using MOFs as precursors may allow the synthesis of stable catalyst structures that can be designed to optimize product selectivities of hydrocarbon processes.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
