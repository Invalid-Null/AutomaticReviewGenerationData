Revealing fundamentals affecting activity and product selectivity in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation over bare Al2O3†
A detailed study was carried out to elucidate the factors affecting the activity and, particularly, selectivity of bare Al2O3 in the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene under industrially relevant conditions. A series of samples were synthesized by a precipitation method upon varying the ratio of OH−/Al3+ in the solution. This ratio was established to affect the ability of Al2O3 to form aluminium cations with lower coordination (Alcus) than regular surface Al3+ sites. Such defective sites show higher activity for propene formation and lower ability for coke formation. In addition to the preparation method, the kind of reducing agent for Al2O3 is decisive for creation of the desired defects, with CO showing higher reactivity owing to its ability to react with surface OH groups.
1. Introduction
Propene is one of the most important building blocks of the chemical industry. Its demand is steadily increasing due to plentiful downstream applications of this olefin. Currently, steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of various oil fractions are the most common industrial processes to produce propene.1 They cannot, however, completely cover the demand for propene. For this reason and due to the limited resources of crude oil, producing propene through the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) has attracted more and more attention both in industrial and academic research around the world.
Al2O3-Based catalysts with supported Pt or CrOx species are commercially applied in large-scale PDH processes. Although such catalysts show high activity and selectivity, they have some drawbacks. Expensive Pt-containing catalysts suffer from deactivation caused by coke deposition. Their initial activity cannot be simply recovered after oxidative coke removal due to agglomeration of nano-structured Pt. To re-disperse Pt species and accordingly restore their high activity and selectivity, the catalysts must be treated by ecologically harmful Cl2 or Cl− containing compounds.2,3 Toxicity of Cr(vi) compounds is a serious shortcoming of the Cr-containing catalysts. Against this background, the on-going research is focused on the development of suitable alternative supported catalysts with catalytically active GaOx,4,5 ZnOx,6–9 VOx,10,11 SnOx (ref. 12 and 13) or CoOx (ref. 14–16) species. A current progress in the development of catalysts for non-oxidative, oxidative, or CO2-mediated dehydrogenation of propane can be found in ref. 17.
In 2015, our group has introduced a strategy for designing and preparation of bulk catalysts. Surface defects such as coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) in ZrO2-based catalysts were suggested to be the active sites for alkane dehydrogenation.18–24 The developed catalysts show industrially relevant activity, selectivity, and durability. The concentration of Zrcus could be controlled through creation of oxygen vacancies in the following ways: (i) depositing tiny amounts of metals able to activate hydrogen;18,21,24 (ii) doping of ZrO2 with metal oxides with lower oxidation state than Zr4+;20 (iii) phase composition22 or preparation method of ZrO2.23 Our concept could also be extended to bare Al2O3. Al2O3 pretreated in N2, air or H2 or in situ during catalytic test, was active and selective in the non-oxidative isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene. Its activity and selectivity increases further when the pre-treatment was carried out at higher temperatures than upon isobutane dehydrogenation.25 Coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ (Alcus) sites generated through removal of OH groups were suggested to be responsible for the dehydrogenation reaction. Later, Dixit et al.26 concluded in their theoretical study that Alcus and neighboring lattice oxygen activate the C–H bond in propane. Very recently, Zhu et al.27 reported that various commercial Al2O3 materials are active and selective in PDH after an activation process at 700 °C. Those authors, however, used a reaction feed with low propane concentration (10 vol%). Thus, it was difficult to analyze coke formation and to determine catalyst performance under industrially relevant conditions. Moreover, no analysis related to purposeful creation of Alcus sites has been carried out.
Motivated by the above arguments, we further explore the application potential of bare Al2O3 in the PDH reaction using an industrially relevant feed. From a scientific viewpoint, our objectives were to (i) understand fundamentals for controlling concentration of surface OH groups of Al2O3 and its ability to form Alcus through varying conditions of Al2O3 preparation; (ii) to provide a simple way for creation of Alcus sites at the same temperature used for the dehydrogenation reaction; (iii) to elucidate factors affecting product selectivity. To this end, a series of bare Al2O3 samples were synthesized by a simple precipitation method and tested in PDH to determine the rate of propene formation, selectivity–conversion relationships, and long-term stability. Bulk and surface characterization techniques were instrumental for establishing the structure–activity relationship.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Al(NO3)3·9H2O (Chempur, >98%) and NH4OH (25 wt%, ROTH) were used for preparation as received without any purification. Commercial Al2O3 (Chempur, basic) was calcined at 550 °C for 6 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 before catalytic tests and characterization.
In-house prepared Al2O3 samples were synthesized according to ref. 28 but with some modifications regarding the ratio of NH4OH and Al3+ in the solution. Taking the Al2O3_3.0 sample as an example, the modified procedure is described briefly as follows. 18 ml of NH3·H2O (25 wt%) was added dropwise to 80 ml of 1 M Al(NO3)3 solution under continuous stirring. The formed suspension was stirred at room temperature for an additional 1 h followed by aging at room temperature for 48 h. Then, the solid product was collected after filtration, washed with deionized water, and dried at room temperature. Finally, the obtained solid materials were heated up to 550 °C in air with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 and kept at this temperature for 6 h. Further Al2O3 samples were synthesized upon varying the ratio of OH− and Al3+ in the initial solution as given in Table 1. The samples were named as Al2O3_x, where x stands for the molar ratio of OH− and Al3+.

2.2. Catalyst characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were collected on an X'Pert Pro Theta/Theta diffractometer (Panalytical) with CuKα radiation source (λ = 1.5418 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA).
To determine the surface area of differently prepared Al2O3 samples, the N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were carried out using ASAP 2020 (Micromeritics, USA). Before the tests, all the fresh samples were treated at 250 °C for 3 h to remove physically adsorbed water. Afterwards, N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were carried out at 77 K.
Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) measurements were carried out using an in-house developed setup equipped with 8 individually heated fixed-bed tubular reactors. 50 mg of each fresh sample was loaded to the reactors and fixed between two layers of quartz wool. All the samples were initially heated to 600 °C in Ar and then flushed by air for 1 h to remove adsorbed impurities. Hereafter, they were treated at the same temperature in a flow of 50 vol% H2 in Ar or 1 vol% CO in Ar for 1 h. After cooling to 120 °C in Ar, the treated catalysts were exposed to 1 vol% NH3 flow for 1.5 h and then purged by Ar for 2 h to remove physically adsorbed NH3. Afterwards, the catalysts were further cooled down to 80 °C in Ar. Finally, the NH3-TPD profiles were measured at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 from 80 to 900 °C in Ar. An online mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum Omnistar GSD 320) was used for determining the concentration of ammonia (NH, m/z = 15).
To investigate the ability of Al2O3 to form Alcus sites under reducing conditions, CO-TPR tests were carried out in the same setup used for the NH3-TPD experiments. 50 mg of each fresh sample was loaded into the reactors, which were initially heated in Ar to 600 °C. Hereafter, the samples were purged in a flow of air at the same temperature for 1 h and cooled to room temperature in air. Afterwards, the catalysts were heated to 900 °C in 1 vol% CO in Ar with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. CO2 (m/z = 44), CO (m/z = 28) and H2 (m/z = 2) concentrations were measured by the above-mentioned mass spectrometer.
2.3. Catalytic tests
Propane dehydrogenation tests were performed in an in-house developed setup equipped with 15 continuous-flow tubular fix-bed quartz reactors. To determine the rate of propene formation, the conversion of propane was controlled to be hold below 10%. To fulfil this requirement, we used 50 mg of each catalyst and 40 ml min−1 flow of the reaction feed consisting of 40 vol% C3H8 in N2. For testing non-treated samples, they were exposed to the reaction feed directly after heating up in N2. When testing differently treated samples, they were initially heated in N2 up to 600 °C and then flushed in a flow of air for 1 h. After 15 min purging with N2, the samples were treated at the same temperature in 50 vol% H2 in N2 for 1 h or 50 vol% CO in N2 for 30 min. After 15 min flushing in N2, the catalysts were exposed to a flow of 40 vol% C3H8 in N2. All the above-described tests were carried out at 600 °C. The rate of propene formation related to catalyst amount or surface area was calculated according to eqn (1a) or (1b).

For long-term stability tests, the treatment steps are same as for the tests carried out for determining the rate of propene formation. For a proper comparison of the catalysts in terms of product selectivity, propane conversion for each sample was adjusted to about 25% through changing the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV).
The conversion of propane, the selectivity to gas-phase products and to coke were calculated according to eqn (2)–(4). Eqn (5) was used for calculating the space time yield of propene formation. Turnover frequency (TOF) of propene formation was calculated according to eqn (6) under assumption that one CO creates one active site in CO-TPR measurements. The TOF values were calculated based on r(C3H6), which was determined at propane conversion below 10%.

For separating gas-phase components, the GC is equipped with PLOT/Q (for CO2), AL/S (for hydrocarbons), and Molsieve 5 (for H2, O2, N2, and CO) columns. In all tests, the analysis time for the gas-phase products is 4 min.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Phase composition and surface area of differently prepared Al2O3
Phase composition of differently synthesized Al2O3 samples was analyzed by XRD. The obtained diffractograms are shown in Fig. 1. They are composed of reflections at 19.5, 37.6, 39.5, 45.9 and 66.8 (2θ, degree), which are characteristic for the γ-Al2O3 phase. Additionally, a broad peak at about 42.7° (2θ, degree) is present in the pattern of the commercial Al2O3, which may be attribute to the χ-Al2O3 phase (PDF 00-013-0373).

The synthesis conditions also have a strong effect on the surface area of Al2O3 as seen in Table 2. The commercial Al2O3 material possesses the lowest surface area of 151 m2 g−1 among all the Al2O3 samples. For the in-house prepared samples, the surface area increases with the ratio of n(OH−) to n(Al3+) in the solution and reaches the maximal value of 363 m2 g−1 when the ratio is 8.

3.2. Effect of preparation method on acid–base and redox properties of Al2O3
Acidic properties of Al2O3 samples were investigated by NH3-TPD. The materials had been treated with CO or H2 before these tests. The NH3-TPD profiles are shown in Fig. S1 in ESI.† The amount of desorbed NH3 was quantified in the temperature range of 80–900 °C. Based on this amount and the surface area of each Al2O3 sample, we calculated the density of acidic sites under assumption that one NH3 molecule adsorbs on one acidic site. The obtained values are given in Table 2. The CO-treated samples possess, in general, higher density of acidic sites than their H2-treated counterparts. This is related to the ability of CO to remove both OH groups and lattice oxygen from Al2O3 (eqn (7) and (8)).29 For the H2-treated samples, the Al2O3_5.3 and Al2O3_8.0 samples have the lowest density of acidic sites of 0.37 μmol m−2, while the Al2O3_3.8 sample possesses the highest density. The strongest effect of the kind of reducing agent, i.e. H2 or CO, on the density was established for commercial Al2O3. The density of acidic sites increased from 0.38 to 0.53 μmol m−2 when CO was used instead of H2.
To investigate redox properties of Al2O3 materials, CO-TPR tests were carried out. As seen in Fig. S2a in ESI,† an evident peak of CO consumption can be observed between 300–400 °C for all Al2O3 materials, while no corresponding CO2 signal was found at the same position. When the temperature is higher than 500 °C, CO consumption and CO2 formation were observed over all bare Al2O3 materials. According to ref. 30, CO could adsorb on Lewis and weak Brønsted acidic sites. Thus, such CO consumption should be attributed to adsorption of CO on the surface of Al2O3 samples. From a fundamental point of view, there are two different kinds of reduction mechanism over OH-rich metal oxides upon CO-TPR.30 One is removal of OH groups and formation of CO2 and H2 as well as O vacancies (eqn (7)). Another one is that CO reacts with lattice oxygen and gives CO2 and O vacancy (eqn (8)). For OH-rich metal oxides, two pathways can occur during the reduction but in different temperature ranges. Generally, removal of OH groups is easier than that of lattice oxygen in the bulk materials.30
2CO + 2HO− → 2CO2 + H2 + 2Ovacancies (7)
CO + Olattice → CO2 + Ovacancy (8)
As the consumption of CO is accompanied by the formation of CO2 and H2 in the range of 500–900 °C (Fig. S2b and c in ESI†), we concluded that CO conversion over all Al2O3 samples should be attributed to the removal of OH groups. This assumption is supported by in situ DRIFT data (Fig. S3a in ESI†). This process seems to occur through formats (Fig. S3b in ESI†). Thus, oxygen vacancies are created on the surface of Al2O3 after treatment with CO.
3.3. Factors affecting activity of Al2O3 in PDH
To check if and how the preparation method of bare Al2O3 affects the rate of propene formation, the commercial and differently prepared Al2O3 samples were tested in the PDH reaction at 600 °C. In our previous study on the isobutane dehydrogenation over commercial Al2O3, the conversion of isobutane could be strongly improved when the catalyst was treated at the reaction temperature in reaction feed, N2, air or H2 at 600 °C for at least 10 h or at higher temperatures.25 Such harsh treatment was necessary to remove OH groups and to generate Alcus sites but is unfavorable for an industrial process having in mind several reaction/activation cycles. Shorter time could be needed when the samples were treated at higher temperatures, e.g. 650 or 700 °C. Similarly, Zhu et al.27 also treated various Al2O3 at 700 °C to achieve high activity in PDH reaction at 630 °C. In the view of reducing energy consumption, preventing catalyst restructuring/sintering at high temperatures and avoiding unnecessary heating/cooling processes upon catalyst regeneration/activation, it would be advantageous to perform PDH and catalyst activation at the same temperature. Inspired by our previous study of the PDH reaction over bare ZrO2,19 where 7 times increase in the rate of propene formation was achieved when replacing H2 by CO as pretreatment gas, we decided to check whether the activity of Al2O3 can also be affected by the kind of reducing agent. As seen in Fig. 2, the CO-treated catalysts reveal about 2 times higher activity than their H2-treated counterparts. The non-treated materials show the lowest activity.
Fig. 2 The rate of propene formation related to (a) catalyst amount or (b) specific surface area as a function of this area. Red and black symbols stand for commercial or prepared Al2O3 samples. The catalysts were tested without any treatment (▼), after H2 (●) or CO (○) treatment. Reaction conditions: 50 mg of catalysts, 600 °C, H2 or CO treatment at 600 °C for 1 h or 30 min, C3H8 : N2 = 2 : 3, total flow rate of 40 ml min−1, WHSV(propane) = 37.7 h−1.
Regardless of the kind of catalyst treatment, the rate related to catalyst amount increases with catalyst surface area (Fig. 2a). We also determined the rate related to the surface area (Fig. 2b). With the exception of the commercial Al2O3 sample, the surface-normalized rate determined for the in-house prepared Al2O3 samples seems to pass a maximum with rising surface area. Thus, the activity of differently prepared Al2O3 samples should be additionally determined by other factors rather by the surface area. What these factors can be?
We tried to correlate the surface-normalized rate with the overall amount of desorbed NH3 from Al2O3 samples after H2 or CO treatments. However, we could not find any dependence (Fig. S4 in ESI†). Importantly, regardless of the type of treatment, this rate increases with an increase in the molar ratio of OH− and Al3+ in the solution and then remains stable when the ratio is higher than 5.3 as seen in Fig. 3. This figure also shows that the temperature of maximal CO consumption rate (Tmax-CO) in CO-TPR tests decreases when the ratio increases from 3 to 5.3 and then remains stable. Therefore, we can put forward that the ability of Al2O3 to form Alcus sites through removal of surface OH groups has a strong effect on catalyst activity.

To further understand the effects of catalyst treatment and the molar ratio of OH− and Al3+ on catalyst activity, we tried to correlated the rate of propene formation with the amount of CO consumed in CO-TPR tests. According to the eqn (7) and (8), CO can react with lattice oxygen and OH groups yielding oxygen vacancies. The latter are direct indicators for the presence of Alcus sites. Against this background, we calculated the amount of CO consumed up to 600 °C, 650 °C or 700 °C. With exception of commercial Al2O3, a linear correlation between the rate of propene formation and the amount of CO consumed was obtained at 700 °C (Fig. 4a). The correlation is not perfect for the amounts of CO consumed up to 600 °C and 650 °C (Fig. S5a and b in ESI†). It should be mentioned that we used a feed with 50 vol% CO in N2 for Al2O3 treatment before catalytic tests while CO-TPR tests were carried out with a feed containing only 1 vol% CO. Thus, the amount of CO consumed up to 700 °C in CO-TPR tests should be more representative for that consumed upon catalyst treatment before PDH because the treatment feed contains 50 vol% CO. Therefore, we can conclude that the higher the amount of CO consumed by Al2O3, the higher the rate of propene formation is. Such dependence suggests that all prepared Al2O3 samples have the same active sites but differ in their ability to generate such sites. To confirm this hypothesis, the TOF values based on the above-mentioned amount of consumed CO were calculated. It is worth mentioning that all the in-house prepared Al2O3 samples possess similar TOF values (based on the amount of CO consumed up to 700 °C) with about 0.09 s−1 and it does not depend on the synthetic conditions (Fig. 4b). A similar conclusion can be made when considering the TOF values calculated on the basis of CO consumed up to 600 or 650 °C (Fig. S5c in ESI†). This result indicates that our samples have the same active sites. As the preparation procedure of commercial Al2O3 is unknown and its TOF value is about 1.5 times higher than that of our samples, the preparation method seems to be another factor affecting the ability of this metal oxide to form Alcus sites under reducing conditions.

3.4. Overall scheme of formation of reaction products
To elucidate reaction pathways leading to propene and undesired reaction products including coke and to check if CO treatment has any effect on these pathways, selectivity–conversion relationships were determined from catalytic tests carried out with different contact times. The selectivity to propene, cracking products (methane and ethene) and coke as a function of propane conversion is shown in Fig. 5a–c, respectively. Regardless of the type of treatment and the preparation method of Al2O3, the selectivity to propene decreases with an increase in propane conversion. When the samples were, however, treated in 50 vol% H2 in N2, the negative effect of the propane conversion on changes of propene selectivity is more pronounced in comparison with the samples treated in 50 vol% CO in N2. Moreover, the latter treatment also positively affects the selectivity to propene at a certain degree of propane conversion in a broad range. For example, the selectivity increases from 0.79 to 0.88 and from 0.57 to 0.77 at about 0.25 propane conversion over the commercial Al2O3 and Al2O3_8.0 samples, respectively (Fig. 5a). When we extrapolate the propane conversion to zero, the selectivity to propene over commercial Al2O3 will be close to 1. Thus, propene must be the only primary product in the course of PDH. As the selectivity to propene at zero propane conversion over Al2O3_8.0 is below 1, there should exist other products originated directly from propane.
Fig. 5 The selectivity to different products as a function of propane conversion over commercial Al2O3 (black) and Al2O3_8.0 (red) catalysts; (a) selectivity to propene, (b) selectivity to cracking products (methane and ethene), (c) selectivity to coke; (d) proposed reaction pathways for propane dehydrogenation over commercial Al2O3 and in-house prepared Al2O3_8.0 samples. Closed symbol: CO pretreatment; open symbol: H2 pretreatment. Reaction conditions: 600 °C, C3H8 : N2 = 2 : 3, treated in 50 vol% H2 in N2 for 1 h or treated in 50 vol% CO in N2 for 30 min.
As seen in Fig. 5b, regardless of the type of treatment, the selectivity to cracking products increases slightly with an increase in propane conversion over commercial Al2O3 and Al2O3_8.0 samples. The Al2O3_8.0 sample shows, however, higher selectivity to cracking products in comparison with the commercial Al2O3 material in a board range of propane conversion. Nevertheless, the CO treatment has a stronger effect on the selectivity to cracking products over Al2O3_8.0. For example, it decreases from 0.16 to 0.08 at about 0.25 propane conversion for the H2-treated and CO-treated Al2O3_8.0 samples, respectively. While the selectivity to cracking product after H2 and CO treatment is similar for the commercial Al2O3 material. In addition, the selectivity to cracking products over Al2O3_8.0 is distinct from zero at zero conversion. This means the cracking products are partly generated directly from propane. In contrast to the selectivity to cracking products, the selectivity to coke is close to zero at zero degree of propane conversion over all catalysts regardless of the type of treatment. The latter selectivity also strongly increases with rising degree of propane conversion. As the selectivity to propene follows an opposite trend, it can be concluded that propene undergoes consecutive transformation to coke.
Based on the above discussion, the main reaction pathways in the course of PDH are summarized in Fig. 5d. It is important to highlight that catalyst treatment in CO partially suppresses both propane cracking and propene conversion into coke. Surface acidity does not seem to be the main factor affecting coke formation from propene. Regardless of the pretreatment, commercial Al2O3 and Al2O3_8.0 samples possess comparable density of acidic sites determined from NH3-TPD (Table 2) but strongly differ in product selectivity (Fig. 5). The positive effect of CO treatment on propene selectivity can be explained as follows. Irrespective of the method of Al2O3 preparation, the rate of propene formation increases when the catalysts were treated in H2 or CO in comparison with the non-treated sample (Fig. 3). Simultaneously, an increase in propene selectivity is also achieved (Fig. S6†). As we discussed above and suggested in ref. 25, OH groups on the surface of Al2O3 material are decomposed upon high-temperature treatment yielding Alcus sites. CO was proven to be more efficient reagent for such process. As the non-treated Al2O3 samples also dehydrogenate C3H8 to C3H6 and the corresponding selectivity increases after catalyst treatment, we put forward that there are at least two different sites where propane/propene can adsorb and react. Alcus sites with different unsaturation degree should be considered. Those located on flat surfaces participate both in propane dehydrogenation to propene and coke formation or cracking. The defective sites with lower coordination, which are formed upon reductive Al2O3 treatment, should preferentially catalyze the desired reaction. As CO is a stronger reducing agent in comparison with H2, the concentration of such defects is higher after treatment with CO that results in an increase in the selectivity to propene. It cannot also be excluded that some OH groups may be responsible for side reactions, e.g. cracking and coke, and when they were removed by CO or thermal treatment, both activity and selectivity to propene could be enhanced. A similar conclusion was made in our previous study of the PDH reaction over differently prepared ZrO2.22 Actually, a positive effect of Al2O3 treatment with H2O on coke selectivity has been observed in our previous study on isobutane dehydrogenation over commercial Al2O3.25 Summing up, it can be concluded that the selectivity to propene can be optimized through improving the ability of Al2O3 to ensure the concentration of Alcus as high as possible. This material property depends on the method of Al2O3 preparation.
3.5. Tests under industrially relevant conditions
To demonstrate industrial relevance of bare Al2O3 for the PDH reaction, we determined the space time yield of propene formation (STY(C3H6)) at a propane conversion of about 0.25. The obtained on-stream STY(C3H6) profiles are shown in Fig. 6 for two Al2O3 samples treated either in 50 vol% H2 or 50 vol% CO. For the H2-treated samples, STY(C3H6) increases from 0.1 to 0.23 kgC3H6 h−1 kgcat−1 and from 0.25 to 0.33 kgC3H6 h−1 kgcat−1 within two hours under propane stream over commercial Al2O3 and Al2O3_8.0, respectively. Such increase is due to in situ formation of Alcus sites by propane and/or propene, which are stronger reducing agents than H2. The CO-treated samples, however, do not show any on-stream activation probably due to even stronger reducing ability of CO. They reveal highest activity during the first minute on propane stream (Fig. 6) but quickly loose about 30% of their peak activity before they reach almost stable activity. The CO-treated catalysts demonstrate about 4 times higher peak activity in comparison with the H2-treated materials. The highest initial value of about 0.8 kgC3H6 h−1 kgcat−1 is close or even higher in comparison with those obtained over the state-of-the art catalysts based on oxides of Zn, Co, or Sn but is significantly lower than for Cr-, V-, Pt- or Zr-containing catalysts.17
Fig. 6 (a) The STY(C3H6) and (b) selectivity to propene and coke over commercial Al2O3 (black) and Al2O3_8.0 (red). Reaction conditions: 600 °C, C3H8 : N2 = 2 : 3. For H2-treated commercial Al2O3 and Al2O3_8.0 (open symbols), the WHSV(propane) is 1.4 h−1 and 2.3 h−1, respectively. For CO-treated commercial Al2O3 and Al2O3_8.0 (closed symbols), the WHSV(propane) is 1.8 h−1 and 4.7 h−1, respectively.
It is also worth mentioning that Al2O3_8.0 performs superior to commercial Al2O3 materials in terms of productivity and on-stream stability. The latter catalyst operates at about 1.7 times lower STY(C3H6) and continuously deactivates, while Al2O3_8.0 seems to reach a stable operation after 0.5 h on propane stream. Thus, the ability of Al2O3 to generate Alcus sites seems to be a key property for activity, selectivity, and on-stream stability. This knowledge can be used for optimizing Al2O3 and even for designing other alternative-type catalysts based on non-reducible metal oxides.
4. Conclusion
We proved that bare Al2O3, which is typically considered as a support but not as a catalyst for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, can be active and selective in the PDH reaction. While total acidity determined from NH3-TPD tests do not play a significant role for both activity and propene selectivity, this catalyst performance depends on the ability of Al2O3 to release its lattice oxygen and/or decompose surface OH groups. This is related to the creation of catalytically active coordinatively unsaturated surface Al3+ cations (Alcus). In comparison with common surface Al3+ sites, those with lower coordination show higher activity towards propene formation and lower activity for coke formation. The concentration of Alcus sites can be controlled through preparation method of Al2O3 as shown here without usage of any metal oxide promoters or supported metals usually used for such purposes. The ratio of OH−/Al3+ in the solution applied for Al2O3 preparation was shown to be a decisive parameter for the ability of this metal oxide to generate Alcus sites upon reductive treatment. CO was proven to be an efficient reducing agent owing to its efficient removal of surface OH groups.
