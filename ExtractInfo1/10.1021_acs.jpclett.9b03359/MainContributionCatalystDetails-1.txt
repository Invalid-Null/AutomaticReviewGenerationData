 Unfortunately, I do not have enough information from the provided documents to generate a cohesive summary following the template structure. The documents do not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation research, as they focus on cation-cation interactions and hydrogen bonding in ionic liquids. They do not mention any details about catalyst composition, performance metrics, or enhancements for propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. Without relevant content from the source documents, I cannot synthesize a meaningful summary in the requested XML format. Please provide documents containing extracts related to propane dehydrogenation so I can attempt to aggregate the information into a unified summary.
