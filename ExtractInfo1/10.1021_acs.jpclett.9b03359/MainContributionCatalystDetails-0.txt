 Unfortunately I do not have enough context to provide a complete integrated summary, as the multiple document extracts do not seem to be discussing the same study or results. 

The extracts indicate the documents are not relevant to propane dehydrogenation, as they focus on cation-cation interactions and hydrogen bonding in ionic liquids. Without more complete excerpts from the source documents, I cannot accurately synthesize the key findings into a cohesive XML output. Please provide more substantive extracts that pertain to the same propane dehydrogenation study so I can attempt an integrated summary.
