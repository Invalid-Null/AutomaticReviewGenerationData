X–H Bond Activation on Cr(III),O Sites (X = R, H): Key Steps in Dehydrogenation and Hydrogenation Processes
Abstract
We synthesized isolated Cr(III) sites on SiO2−Al2O3 and Al2O3 by grafting and subsequent controlled thermal treatment of Cr(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)2 and Cr(Al(OiPr)4)3 on alumina. CrOx/Al2O3 was obtained from incipient wetness impregnation of Al2O3 with CrO3 in H2O followed by calcination, as carried out for the synthesis of industrial Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts. These materials were characterized by IR, EPR, XAS, and by the adsorption of the probe molecules CO and pyridine, and the results were compared to previously reported isolated Cr(III)/SiO2. All of these materials were active in propane dehydrogenation at 550 °C, where higher TOFs were obtained for Cr(III)/SiO2-Al2O3 and Cr(III)/Al2O3 than for CrOx/Al2O3 and Cr(III)/SiO2. For mechanistic studies the reverse reaction, propene hydrogenation, was studied. Here, the order of reactivity was opposite that of dehydrogenation, with CrOx/Al2O3 and Cr(III)/SiO2 being more active in hydrogenation than Cr(III)/SiO2-Al2O3 and Cr(III)/Al2O3. Kinetic analysis and labeling studies with D2 showed that the rate law is in all cases first order in H2 partial pressure but had different dependence on propene partial pressure from catalyst to catalyst. We found small normal kinetic isotope effects of 1 ≤ KIE ≤ 2, activation enthalpies up to 40 kJ mol–1, and large negative activation entropies between −100 and −194 J K–1 mol–1 for the different Cr catalysts. We also performed parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) experiments, which showed that H2 addition to propene proceeds, at least in part, via a pairwise mechanism. The experimental data for propene hydrogenation suggests adsorption/desorption pre-equilibria of H2 (or D2) and propene followed by H2 activation and insertion of propene. DFT computations for propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation on Cr(III) on a periodic alumina model show that a mechanism involving X–H activation (X = R, H) is energetically feasible with activation enthalpies and entropies that are comparable to the experimentally determined values.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The high demand for light olefins and its expected significant growth in the next decades have put pressure on existing processes. (1) Common techniques used to produce olefins, such as steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, are energetically demanding and display low selectivity toward specific olefins. In addition, the use of shale gas and light alkanes in crackers has decreased the production of propene. This has led to an increased interest in alkane dehydrogenation as an effective route for the direct production of light olefins, especially propene. Since the discovery of Cr2O3 as a dehydrogenation catalyst, (2) CrOx/Al2O3—also known as the Houdry or Catofin catalyst—has been one of the most commonly employed propane dehydrogenation catalysts. (3) As a high-surface-area material, γ-alumina is the most widely employed support, since the corresponding Cr catalysts often perform better in dehydrogenation of ethane, for instance, in comparison to analogous silica-supported systems. (1) However, one drawback of alumina is that it can catalyze cracking and coking side reactions due to its surface acidity, leading to catalyst deactivation. Due to the endothermic nature of alkane dehydrogenation these reactions have to be conducted at high temperatures (>500 °C). This together with the cracking and coking side reactions make it even more difficult to elucidate the operating mechanism on a molecular level. Industrially, doping with alkali ions (such as K) poisons these acidic sites and thereby improves performance. As is often the case in heterogeneous catalysis, the Catofin catalyst contains only a small fraction of active sites, making investigation of the nature of the active sites and the reaction mechanism difficult. (4) Dehydrogenation activity is thought to be associated with Cr3+ surface ions undergoing a C–H bond activation of propane across a Cr–O bond, followed by β-H transfer and release of H2, though this is still controversial (Scheme 1). (5) A propane dehydrogenation mechanism involving a heterolytic C–H activation has also been proposed for single-site catalysts based on Fe, Co, Zn, and Ga. (6)
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Propane Dehydrogenation, Often Proposed To Proceed via C–H Activation, β-H Elimination and Release of H2 on Cr–O Sites (Red), and Propene Hydrogenation as the Microscopic Reverse Reaction (Blue)
All of these factors make the study of the mechanism and active sites of dehydrogenation difficult. In contrast, studying the mechanism of the reverse reaction, alkene hydrogenation, is easier because of the favored thermodynamics and the use of lower operating temperatures. To elucidate the mechanism in hydrogenation, classical approaches such as isotopic labeling and kinetic studies have been used. (7) Parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) can give insight into the pathways of hydrogen transfer similar to that of isotopic labeling. (8) PHIP is a powerful technique that can help distinguishing between pairwise and nonpairwise hydrogenation mechanisms, even for heterogeneous catalytic systems. (9)
Previously, we reported an effective protocol to obtain well-defined Cr(III) sites on silica using a molecular approach. (10) These Cr(III) sites are active in ethylene polymerization and propane dehydrogenation. Here, we use a similar approach to prepare isolated Cr(III) sites on silica–alumina and on alumina and compare these materials to the previously studied Cr(III)/SiO2 system and the industrial system based on CrOx/Al2O3. We investigate their reactivity in both propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation and perform kinetic evaluation and PHIP experiments in order to obtain further understanding of the operating mechanism. The experimental results are supported by periodic DFT calculations of propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation on Cr(III) surface sites included in an alumina slab model.

Synthesis and Characterization
Cr(III)/SiO2-Al2O3
We prepared isolated Cr(III) sites supported on alumina by following a similar synthetic protocol developed for the synthesis of isolated Cr(III) sites on SiO2 (1), which involved the grafting of Cr(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)2 on a partially dehydroxylated support followed by thermal treatment at 400 °C under vacuum (Scheme 2a). (10b) Cr(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)2 in benzene was reacted with alumina that had previously been partially dehydroxylated at 700 °C, Al2O3-700. This gave a pale blue material along with traces of HOSi(OtBu)3. The resulting solid was treated at 400 °C for 3 h under vacuum to yield the pale blue material 2 (Scheme 2b). Material 2 contains 0.21 wt % Cr and 0.16 wt % Si (Cr/Si = 0.7) according to elemental analysis, suggesting the formation of silicates on alumina as previously observed for the corresponding Rh and Ir complexes. (11) Analysis by GC and 1H NMR shows that 9.7 equiv of isobutene, 3.9 equiv of THF, and 0.007 equiv of tBuOH per Cr are released during the thermal treatment, higher than the expected 9 equiv of C4 compounds and 2 equiv of THF per Cr. These observed differences could be due to a large error in the measurement (ca. 1 equiv per Cr) associated with the low Cr loading. Material 2 does not show any C–H vibrations in its IR spectrum, consistent with the release of all organic residues, as already observed for the material prepared on silica. However, the bands at 1590, 1560, 1548, 1479, and 1395 cm–1 point to the formation of silica–alumina (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Upon contact with CO, an IR band at 2199 cm–1 is observed, consistent with CO coordination to a Lewis acidic Cr(III) center (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). This CO band is between the two CO vibrations previously observed for Cr(III) on silica at 2202 and 2188 cm–1 corresponding to two different sites. (10b) Adsorption of pyridine on 2 gives bands in the aromatic C–H stretching (3000–3170 cm–1) and bending (1653, 1622 (sh), 1614, 1577, 1561 (sh, also present in neat 2), 1548 (sh, also present in neat 2), 1491 and 1450 cm–1) regions (Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information). These bands indicate the presence of pyridine bound to Lewis acidic centers, presumably the Cr(III) and Al centers, and pyridine bound to Brønsted acidic sites, probably originating from the presence of silica–alumina. (11, 12) Pyridine adsorption on 1 does not show bands at 1653 or at ca. 1550 cm–1, consistent with a lack of Brønsted acidic sites for the silica-supported material. The expected band at 1614 cm–1 is slightly red shifted to 1611 cm–1, which could indicate a slightly lower Lewis acidic Cr(III) center in 1 than in 2 (Figures S3 and S4). The X-ray absorption near edge (XANES) spectrum at the Cr K edge of 2 displays an edge energy consistent with Cr(III) in comparison to the edge energy of the molecular precursor Cr(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)2 (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information). (10b, 13) XANES also presents a low-intensity pre-edge feature at 5989.0 eV and a near-edge feature at 6007.5 eV, similar to the previously reported catalyst 1. (10b) X-band EPR of 2 shows signals at g = 5.13 and 4.00 and at g = 2.01 and is consistent with the presence of Cr(III) (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). All the data suggest the formation of Cr(III) dispersed on silica–alumina, as the result of the formation of surface silicates upon thermolysis of the −OSi(OtBu)3 ligands of the precursor Cr(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)2.

Cr(III)/Al2O3
In order to generate Cr(III) sites in a pure alumina environment, we also investigated the grafting and subsequent thermolysis of Cr(Al(OiPr)4)3. Cr(Al(OiPr)4)3 was synthesized according to a literature procedure (14) and fully characterized via 1H NMR and EPR as well as XANES and X-ray diffraction (Figures S7–S9 in the Supporting Information). X-ray diffraction reveals a distorted-octahedral structure of Cr(Al(OiPr)4)3 with κ2-coordinated Al(OiPr)4 ligands. Cr(Al(OiPr)4)3 was reacted with Al2O3-700, followed by thermal treatment under vacuum at 400 °C (Scheme 2c). This gave the pale blue material 3 with 0.18 wt % Cr and no Si according to elemental analysis. Analysis of the products released during the thermal treatment by GC and 1H NMR shows the formation of propene. The infrared spectrum of 3 displays bands between 3620 and 3800 cm–1 and 1400–1600 cm–1, indicating different types of Al–OH (15) as well as a lack of C–H bands (Figure S10 in the Supporting Information). CO adsorption leads to an IR band at 2196 cm–1, similar to the blue-shifted band observed for 2 (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). The adsorption of pyridine on 3 also leads to IR bands very similar to those for 2 (Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information), suggesting that the Lewis acidities of the Cr(III) sites in 2 and 3 are similar and that they both contain Brønsted acidic sites. XANES of Cr(Al(OiPr)4)3 and the material after grafting and post-treatment (3) have nearly identical edge energies and each has a low-intensity pre-edge feature at 5989.0 eV which is consistent with the retention of the chromium oxidation state +3 (Figure S9 in the Supporting Information). (13) The near-edge feature shifts slightly from 6004.5, to 6007.0 and 6008.0 eV from Cr(Al(OiPr)4)3 to the material after grafting to 3. Overall the XANES spectrum of 3 is similar to the spectrum of 2. X-band CW EPR of 3 is very similar to the EPR spectrum of 2 with two broad signals at g = 5.17 and 4.00 and a sharp signal at g = 2.01 (Figure S11 in the Supporting Information). The results from CO and pyridine adsorption, XANES, and EPR show that 2 and 3 have similar spectroscopic signatures pointing to similar Cr(III) sites.
CrOx/Al2O3
We also prepared an alumina-supported Cr oxide, 1.5 wt % CrOx/Al2O3 (4), by impregnation of Al2O3 with CrO3 in H2O and drying at 60 and 120 °C, followed by calcination under a synthetic air flow at 550 °C (Scheme 2d), similar to what is done in industry. Infrared spectroscopy of the CO-exposed material shows a band at 2208 cm–1, which is slightly more blue shifted with respect to free CO than in 2 or 3 (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information; IR of CrOx/Al2O3 can be found in Figure S12 in the Supporting Information). Infrared spectroscopy of pyridine adsorbed on 4 shows bands at 1622 (sh), 1614, 1577, 1491, and 1450 cm–1, as in the case of 2 and 3, consistent with pyridine adsorption to Lewis acidic Cr sites, but in contrast to 2 and 3, bands at 1653 or at ca. 1550 cm–1 are lacking, pointing to the absence of a significant amount of Brønsted acidic sites (Figures S3 and S4 in the Supporting Information). The edge energy in the XANES of 4 is shifted to higher energies in comparison to 2 and 3 and shows an intense pre-edge feature at 5991.5 eV (Figure S13 in the Supporting Information). These features are similar to the XANES signature of CrO3, which shows that the majority of Cr sites in 4 are probably in a formal oxidation state of +6. However, X-band CW EPR of 4 contains an intense dispersive signal at g = 1.97 (Figure S14 in the Supporting Information), suggesting the formation of some reduced Cr, possibly Cr(III) sites, during the material synthesis.
Propane Dehydrogenation
The reactivity of 2–4 in propane dehydrogenation was evaluated in a continuous flow reactor (10 mL min–1, 20% in Ar, 2.5 bar) at 550 °C and compared to what we previously observed for 1. (10c) The output gases were analyzed via GC-FID and GC-TCD and used to calculate conversion, activity, and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation (Table 1; see also Figures S15–S23 in the Supporting Information).

The industrial-like CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst 4 gives higher conversions than Cr(III)/SiO2-Al2O3 (2) and Cr(III)/Al2O3 (3), in line with the significantly higher Cr loading of 1.5 vs 0.21 and 0.18 wt % Cr (Table 1). In terms of activity per mole of Cr, 3 and 2 are the most active propane dehydrogenation catalysts followed by 4 and 1. Catalysts 3 and 2 show similar high initial TOFs of 60 and 51 (mol C3H6) (mol Cr)−1 h−1, respectively, which decrease to 34 and 28 (mol C3H6) (mol Cr)−1 h−1 over the first 2 h, allowing cumulative TONs of 640 and 528 over 20 h. Catalyst 4 displays lower initial activity of 26 (mol C3H6) (mol Cr)−1 h−1, which increases over the first 2 h to 31 (mol C3H6) (mol Cr)−1 h−1 and then steadily decreases, leading to a TON of 409 over 20 h. In terms of selectivity, material 4 gives propene with the highest selectivity of 88%, while 2 and 3 display lower propene selectivities of 70% and 66%, respectively. In all cases the main product is propene, along with methane, ethane, ethylene, and coke as byproducts. While we attempted to estimate the amount of coke formed by measuring the amount of hydrogen in the gas stream, it was within the experimental error of the analysis and could not be quantitatively determined. The lower selectivity of 2 and 3 in comparison to that of 4 is consistent with the larger amount of Brønsted acidic sites, known to catalyze cracking, (1, 16) as suggested by probing the acidity with pyridine (vide supra). Overall, catalysts 2 and 3 behave very similarly in terms of conversion, activity, and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation, consistent with similar spectroscopic signatures: EPR and XANES spectra and vibrational frequencies of adsorbed CO and pyridine. In comparison to previously reported data for propane dehydrogenation on Cr(III) on silica (1), (10c) the three silica–alumina or alumina supported catalysts (2–4) are significantly more active. This is presumably due to the increased Lewis acidity of the Cr(III) sites on 2–4 in comparison to 1 (vide infra). In terms of selectivity, 4 is more selective than 1, while 2 and 3 display similar or slightly lower selectivities for propene than 1, consistent with the presence of Brønsted acidic sites.
Propene Hydrogenation
Catalysts 1–4 were also tested for propene hydrogenation at 150 °C in a continuous flow setup (total flow 30 mL/min, 2 bar) with a gas flow consisting of propene, H2 or D2, and Ar. The gas flow composition was systematically varied, in order to measure the rate dependence on each mixture component. For each gas mixture GC analysis of the output mixture was performed in triplicate. From these measurements TOFs and an experimental rate law could be obtained. Rate constants were calculated from this rate law, and a comparison of the rate constants obtained with H2 vs D2 produced a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) (see Table 2 and Figures S24–S48 in the Supporting Information). Due to the high conversions obtained with catalyst 4, the same experiment was conducted at the lower temperature of 50 °C. High conversions were also obtained with catalyst 1 at 150 °C.

The TOFs derived from the measurements were linearly dependent on the partial pressure of H2 (or D2) for all tested catalysts, giving rate laws that are first order in PH2 (or PD2); see Figures S24–S43 in the Supporting Information for TOF vs partial pressure plots. We only observed a linear dependence on the partial pressure of propene (PC3H6) for catalysts 2 and 4 at 50 °C. In other cases, the rate law was zero-order in propene. This is probably due to saturation behavior caused by strong binding of propene. It could also be caused by competing mechanistic pathways with different propene dependences. At lower propene pressure, the TOF dependence on PC3H6 can, in fact, be reasonably well fit with a Langmuir-type behavior (TOF = kobsKbindPC3H6/(1 + KbindPC3H6)), while the behavior at higher pressure could be explained with a competing pathway involving the binding of a second propene molecule to a Cr center (see Figures S39–S43). The rate constants for propene hydrogenation (and the activity) for the different catalysts follows the order 4 ≈ 1 > 3 ≈ 2: i.e., 4 and 1 are faster than 3 and 2. For all of these Cr catalysts, we observed a normal KIE that is relatively small (1 ≤ KIE ≤ 2). The highest KIE was observed for Cr(III)/silica (KIE = 2.0(2)), which is significantly higher than that for Cr(III)/alumina (KIE = 1.0(3)). A small normal KIE as observed for Cr might arise from the interplay of an inverse equilibrium isotope effect (EIE) of H2 chemisorption coupled with a normal KIE for propene insertion. This may indicate that H2 activation is more rate-determining in case of Cr(III)/alumina, while for Cr(III)/silica other mechanistic steps, such as insertion of propene for instance, get more limiting. However, the interpretation of isotope effects of reactions with H2/D2 are complicated by contributions from the loss of rotational and translational entropy upon reaction. (17) This makes it possible for the isotope effect to cross from inverse (<1) to normal (>1) just by changing the temperature and does not necessarily indicate a change in mechanism. Thus, an isotope effect of any mechanism could be 1.0 just by virtue of the temperature at which the measurement was made and not by a change in mechanism.
Catalysts 1–4 were also tested for propene hydrogenation in a continuous flow setup (total flow 30 mL/min, 2 bar with 23 mL/min of Ar, 5 mL/min of H2, 2 mL/min of propene) as a function of temperature (50–250 °C). The measured GC data for each temperature were analyzed for TOFs and rate constants. The Eyring parameters ΔH⧧ and ΔS⧧ in Table 2 were derived from the corresponding Eyring plots, where ln(k/T) vs 1/T was modeled by a linear fit (Figures S44–S48 in the Supporting Information). The obtained ΔH⧧ values are generally close to 0 or are relatively small positive values up to 40(10) kJ mol−1, consistent with a mechanism that involves bond breaking. For catalysts 2 and 3 we found higher activation enthalpies of 20(4) and 40(10) kJ mol−1 in comparison to the activation enthalpies of 1 and 4 at 150 °C of −7(1) and 0(2) kJ mol−1. Large negative activation entropies ΔS⧧ of −100 to −194 J K−1 mol−1 were obtained in all cases, consistent with a multimolecular reaction.
Parahydrogen-Induced Polarization
Parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) experiments can give valuable information about the mechanism of a hydrogenation reaction. (8, 9) If a hydrogenation reaction is carried out using parahydrogen-enriched H2 and if signal enhancement from the polarization effect is observed by NMR in the obtained product, H2 must be added, at least partially, via a pairwise mechanism. We performed PASADENA (parahydrogen and synthesis allow dramatically enhanced nuclear alignment) (18) and ALTADENA (adiabatic longitudinal transport after dissociation engenders nuclear alignment) (19) propene hydrogenation experiments on the materials 1–4 using p-H2-enriched hydrogen gas at temperatures of 130–550 °C and at gas flow rates from 0.7 to 5.1 mL/s. Highest conversions were generally observed for the lowest flow rates. For the observation of a PHIP effect, though, high gas flow rates are often necessary to reduce the loss of hyperpolarization by relaxation to thermal equilibrium during gas transfer from the reactor to the NMR spectrometer in ALTADENA experiments. The results for propene hydrogenation at selected temperatures and flow rates are shown in Table 3 (the complete data set can be viewed in Tables S1–S5 in the Supporting Information). A PHIP effect can be observed with all of the Cr catalysts reported here, which suggests that at least some of the hydrogenation events take place via a pairwise mechanism (Figure S49 in the Supporting Information). As a lower limit, we estimate that 0.1, 4.5, 3.2, or 4.2% of hydrogenation events using catalysts 1–4, respectively, are pairwise. At the same time, the actual contribution of pairwise hydrogen addition may be much higher, since it is systematically underestimated due to paramagnetically induced nuclear spin relaxation by Cr that cannot be quantified.

DFT Calculations
We also evaluated dehydrogenation of propane and the reverse reaction—the hydrogenation of propene—on Cr(III) supported on alumina by first-principles calculations. We constructed alumina-supported Cr(III) sites from the 110 termination of γ-Al2O3 (20) by substituting one of the Al (AlIII, AlIVb, and AlIVa) by a Cr(III) site (Figure 1). Substitution of the AlIII site is the most favored configuration with respect to AlIVa and AlIVb by 96 and 71 kJ mol–1, respectively (Table S6 in the Supporting Information).
Figure 1
Figure 1. Single-site model of CrIII substituted at the AlIII site on the (a) dehydroxylated s0 and (b) hydroxylated s1 (3.0 OH/nm2) 110 surface of γ-Al2O3. Single-site models of CrIII sites substituted at the (c) AlIVb and (d) AlIVa sites of the 110 surface of γ-Al2O3. Cr, Al, H, and O atoms are depicted in blue, purple, white, and red, respectively.
We evaluated the dehydrogenation of propane according to the mechanism depicted in Scheme 1, which starts via the heterolytic C–H activation of propane and forms a Cr(III)–propyl and an O–H bond. This step is followed by a β-H elimination, which forms a Cr–H bond and propene. Generation of H2 from Cr–H and the O–H group formed during the first step can complete the catalytic cycle. The reverse elementary steps lead to the hydrogenation of propene to propane. We evaluated the reactivity for the surface sites where Cr occupies the AlIII and the AlIVb positions, since they are the two most Lewis acidic and reactive sites of the 110 surface of γ-Al2O3; (20a, 20b) they are the most reactive toward H2, CH4, and CH3X activations (X = F, OCH3). (20e, 21)
Reactivity of the CrIII-O2a Site
s0 Surface. For the propane dehydrogenation reaction on the CrIII-O2a site of the s0 surface (Figure 1a), we will describe the calculated Gibbs free energies at 550 °C. The electronic energies for propane dehydrogenation on the s0 surface are reported in the Table S7 in the Supporting Information, together with the enthalpic (H), entropic (S), and Gibbs free energies (G) at 550 °C.
The activation of the C–H bond of propane by the adjacent O2a oxygen of the CrIII site goes via a transition state that is typical of a σ-bond metathesis step, (22) with an O–H–C propane angle equal to 161° and a C–H distance equal to 1.420 Å (Figure 2). The C–H activation forming the Cr–propyl intermediate has a Gibbs energy barrier (ΔG⧧) equal to 245 kJ mol–1 (at 550 °C) with respect to initial reactants, in a reaction step endoergic by 141 kJ mol–1 (Figure 3a).

The subsequent β-hydride transfer that forms the Cr–H bond and releases propene has a relative energy barrier equal to ΔG⧧ = 133 kJ mol–1 (+274 kJ mol–1 with respect to initial reactants) in a step exoergic by 43 kJ mol–1, located 98 kJ mol–1 with respect to initial reactants. In order to close the catalytic cycle, the hydride and the proton bonded to Cr and the O2a centers respectively react in an exoergic step by 83 kJ mol–1 that releases H2 with a relative energy barrier ΔG⧧ of 120 kJ mol–1. Overall, the propane dehydrogenation is slightly endoergic at 550 °C (by ΔG = 15 kJ mol–1) and the highest points in the energy profile correspond to the transition states for C–H activation of propane and β–H elimination, located at 245 and 274 kJ mol–1, respectively, with respect to initial reactants. We previously reported a Gibbs free energy barrier for the initial propane activation at 550 °C equal to 239 kJ mol–1 for CrIII on SiO2 using a cluster model. (10c)
For propene hydrogenation, which is the reverse of the previously described pathway, we calculated the enthalpic, entropic, and Gibbs free energies at 150 °C (Figure 3b and Table S8 in the Supporting Information). The main difference to the pathway for dehydrogenation is that, at this temperature (150 °C), the highest point in the energy profile corresponds to the H2 activation, with a Gibbs free energy barrier equal to 148 kJ mol–1. At this temperature, the subsequent steps to finally reach propane are less energetically demanding. The rate-limiting step has an activation enthalpy (ΔH⧧) equal to 93 kJ mol–1, whereas the activation entropy (ΔS⧧) is equal to −130 J K−1 mol−1.
s1 Surface. For a 110 termination comprising an additional water molecule with an OH bridging the AlIVa centers and the proton on the O2a atom (Figure 1b), the substitution of the AlIII site is still preferred, but now the difference in energy with respect to AlIVa and AlIVb is reduced to 29 and 59 kJ mol–1, respectively (Table S6 in the Supporting Information). Since CrIII is the most favorable site, we evaluated the propane dehydrogenation also on a partially hydroxylated γ-Al2O3 surface with a hydroxyl coverage equal to 3.0 OH/nm2 (s1).
We evaluated the analogous propane dehydrogenation mechanism as described above for the case of the s1 surface (denoted s1c in previous studies). (20e) We found that the energetics of the reaction do not significantly change with respect to dehydrated surface s0: The C–H activation is now slightly more demanding, with a Gibbs free energy equal to 262 kJ mol–1 (Figure 3a and Table S9 in the Supporting Information). The β-H transfer and the H2 formation are slightly more favored with respect to the dehydrated surface by 39 and 13 kJ mol–1, respectively.
In the case of the s1 surface, propene hydrogenation at 150 °C has an overall Gibbs free energy of activation equal to 136 kJ mol–1, which corresponds to the H2 activation step (Figure 3b). This step has an activation enthalpy (ΔH⧧) and entropy (ΔS⧧) equal to 81 kJ mol–1 and −130 J K−1 mol−1, respectively. All the enthalpic, entropic, and Gibbs free energies at 150 °C for this pathway are reported in Table S10 in the Supporting Information.
Reactivity of the CrIII-O3a Site
s1 Surface. If the O3a site is involved in the C–H activation step (Figure 1b), the Gibbs free energy barrier of the C–H activation of propane is equal to 297 kJ mol–1, and thus it is more demanding than for the O2a center (Figure 3a and Table S11 in the Supporting Information). Moreover, the reaction energy is more endoergic with 192 kJ mol–1 with respect to initial reactants in comparison to 158 kJ mol–1 for the C–H activation on the O2a center also on the s1 surface. The subsequent β-hydride transfer has a relative Gibbs free energy barrier of +127 kJ mol–1, with the transition state located at 319 kJ mol–1 with respect to initial reactants. In this case this step is ca. +100 kJ mol–1 more demanding than for the route via the O2a center. The formation of Cr–H and propene is exoergic by 64 kJ mol–1. Reaction between the Cr–H and the O–H releases H2 in a process with a very low energy barrier equal to only 7 kJ mol–1. This is in line with the previous results which show that the CH4 and H2 activation on AlIII centers and nonadjacent oxygen atoms is very favorable when the surface is hydroxylated with a hydroxyl group bridging the AlIVa centers and a protonated O2a center (s1 surface). (20c, 20e, 23) Overall, for the pathway involving the O3a site the highest point in the energy profile corresponds to the β-hydride transfer transition state, which is located at 319 kJ mol–1 with respect to initial reactants. This is thus a more energetically demanding pathway than the pathway involving C–H activation on the O2a center.
Propene hydrogenation at 150 °C on the CrIII-O3a site has an overall Gibbs free energy of activation equal to 180 kJ mol–1 (Figure 3b). In contrast to the pathway via the O2a center, the most energy demanding step corresponds here to the propene insertion step with an activation Gibbs free energy (ΔG⧧) of 180 kJ mol–1 and an activation enthalpy (ΔH⧧) and entropy (ΔS⧧) of 52 kJ mol–1 and −302 J K−1 mol−1, with respect to initial reactants. All the enthalpic, entropic, and Gibbs free energies at 150 °C for this pathway are reported in Table S12 in the Supporting Information.
Reactivity of the CrIVb-O2b Site
s0 Surface. The activation of the C–H bond of propane by the CrIVb-O2b site (Figure 1c) has a Gibbs energy barrier equal to only 193 kJ mol–1 at 550 °C (Figure 3a and Table S13 in the Supporting Information). This is the most feasible C–H activation of all the evaluated surface sites. The C–H distance at the transition state is equal to 1.396 Å, whereas the O–H–C propane angle takes a value equal to 147° (Figure 4).
Figure 4
Figure 4. Transition-state structure corresponding to the C–H activation of propane on the CrIVb-O2b site. Cr, Al, H, C, and O atoms are depicted in blue, purple, white, gray, and red, respectively. The C–H distance is given in Å.
This formation of the Cr–propyl on the CrIVb site is also the most favorable one, with a reaction energy which is endoergic by 108 kJ mol–1 with respect to initial reactants. The β-hydride transfer on the CrIVb site forming the Cr–H and release has a relative Gibbs free energy barrier of +105 kJ mol–1, being located at 213 kJ mol–1 with respect to initial reactants. This step is exoergic by 41 kJ mol–1. Finally, the H2 coupling between the Cr–H and the O–H hydrogens has a relative Gibbs energy barrier equal to 87 kJ mol–1, in a structure having an energy equal to 154 kJ mol–1 with respect to initial reactants. Overall, the CrIVb-O2b site is the most reactive of all the evaluated sites, since the transition states for C–H activation of propane and β-H elimination are located at 193 and 213 kJ mol–1 with respect to initial reactants.
For the case of the propene hydrogenation at 150 °C on the CrIVb-O2b site the three transition states that lead to propane have similar relative Gibbs energy barrier heights (Figure 3b). The H2 activation and the insertion of the propene into the Cr–H bond are associated with Gibbs energies equal to 86 and 83 kJ mol–1, whereas the formation of propane by transfer of the hydrogen to the propyl takes a value of 93 kJ mol–1. The H2 activation step has an activation enthalpy (ΔH⧧) and entropy (ΔS⧧) of 31 kJ mol–1 and −130 J K−1 mol−1, respectively, with respect to initial reactants. All the enthalpic, entropic, and Gibbs free energies at 150 °C for this pathway are reported in the Table S14 in the Supporting Information.
Discussion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
As previously developed for Cr(III)/SiO2 (1), we prepared Cr(III)/SiO2-Al2O3 (2) and Cr(III)/Al2O3 (3) via grafting of the molecular precursors Cr(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)2 and Cr(Al(OiPr)4)3 on alumina dehydroxylated at 700 °C followed by a thermal treatment under vacuum. We also prepared CrOx/Al2O3 (4) via incipient wetness impregnation and calcination as commonly carried out in industry. (4a) CO adsorption revealed the presence of Lewis acidic Cr centers in all four materials with an increased Lewis acidity for Cr in 2–4 in comparison to 1, as demonstrated by the larger blue-shift of their ν(CO)’s. Pyridine adsorption also showed that Brønsted acidic sites are present in 2 and 3. XANES and EPR show that 2 and 3 contain Cr(III) sites, while 4 contains mainly Cr(VI) along with some reduced Cr sites. All materials 1–4 are active in propane dehydrogenation to form propene and H2; as well as methane, ethane, ethylene, and coke as byproducts. The activity in propane dehydrogenation decreases in the order 3 > 2 > 4 > 1, on the basis of their activity at 0 h (TOF). The greater activity of the silica–alumina or alumina supported materials 2–4 in propane dehydrogenation over 1 correlates with the increased Lewis acidity of the Cr sites in 2–4, as evidenced by CO adsorption. These materials also catalyze propene hydrogenation, at much lower temperatures. The activity and the rate constants in propene hydrogenation vary as follows: kH(4) ≈ kH(1) > kH(3) ≈ kH(2), thus showing that the order in activity changes in the forward versus reverse reaction. While 2 and 3 are the least active catalysts in propene hydrogenation, they are the most active in propane dehydrogenation in comparison to 1 and 4. The increased Lewis acidity of 2 and 3 vs 1 would favor a mechanism involving a C–H heterolytic splitting, as is commonly proposed for the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation (see Scheme 1). It is likely that this increased Lewis acidity also favors propene adsorption, which could thus lead to propene inhibition in propene hydrogenation and thereby a decreased propene hydrogenation activity. This is consistent with the observed dependence of propene hydrogenation activity on propene partial pressure, which exhibits Langmuir-type saturation behavior. The data for catalyst 3 suggest a particularly high adsorption equilibrium constant for propene, in part, probably due to a large heat of adsorption for olefins on the alumina support. (24) However, the observed reversal in the order of activity (in comparison with the rates of propane dehydrogenation) may also be due to increased catalyst deactivation in propane dehydrogenation or due to a temperature effect. Despite the fact that these reactions are technically the microscopic reverse of each other, the rates and equilibrium constants for each mechanistic step may differ slightly for the forward vs the reverse reaction due to the difference in temperature at which propane dehydrogenation vs propene hydrogenation was measured (550 °C vs 150 °C). This would be the case if propene inhibition were occurring in catalysts 2 and 3, since at higher temperatures desorption is favored. In propane dehydrogenation, catalysts 2 and 3 are less selective for propene than 4, in line with the presence of Brønsted acidic sites, which can catalyze cracking.
The study of the reverse reaction, propene hydrogenation, allows the use of lower reaction temperatures, which prevents coking to a large extent and simplifies kinetic and mechanistic studies. All Cr materials follow a rate law in propene hydrogenation that is linear in the partial pressure of H2 and in the case of catalysts 2 and 4 (at 50 °C) also linear in the partial pressure of propene with a Langmuir-type saturation behavior at higher pressures. Comparison of the reactivity with H2 vs D2 gives in all cases a small positive kinetic isotope effect. Eyring analysis gives activation enthalpies close to 0 or with relatively small positive values and large negative activation entropies. All kinetic data are consistent with adsorption/desorption pre-equilibria of H2 (or D2) and propene followed by H2 activation and insertion of propene. To obtain more mechanistic insight, we also conducted propene hydrogenation experiments using parahydrogen. The observation of parahydrogen-enhanced signals for propane by NMR for all catalysts shows that hydrogen is at least 0.1% (1), 4.5% (2), 3.2% (3), and 4.2% (4) added via a pairwise mechanism. The actual percentage for a pairwise mechanism may be much higher, since paramagnetic Cr centers are expected to measurably accelerate nuclear spin relaxation and thus significantly lower the signal enhancement observed for the product. In fact, the observation of a signal enhancement using a paramagnetic catalyst is in itself quite remarkable.
DFT calculations for propane dehydrogenation (and propene hydrogenation) on Cr(III) sites on a periodic alumina model show that a mechanism involving X–H bond activation (X = R, H) is energetically feasible for both propane dehydrogenation at 550 °C and for propene hydrogenation at 150 °C. For propene hydrogenation, the most active site for Cr/Al2O3 is the CrIVb-O2b surface site. On this site the H2 activation, propene insertion, and propane formation have similar relative Gibbs energy barrier heights, which take values equal to 86, 83, and 93 kJ mol–1 respectively. The activation enthalpies (ΔH⧧) and entropies (ΔS⧧) of the initial H2 activation are equal to 31 kJ mol–1 and −130 J K−1 mol−1 with respect to initial reactants, which are in excellent agreement with experiment (ΔH⧧ = 40(10) kJ mol–1 and ΔS⧧ = −100(20) J K−1 mol−1 for catalyst 3, Cr(III)/Al2O3). The data suggest that H2 activation is likely the rate-limiting step (see the Supporting Information).
Conclusion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
We have shown that well-defined Cr(III)/SiO2–Al2O3 and Cr(III)/Al2O3 can be prepared via a molecular approach and that these materials are active in propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation. These Cr catalysts display higher activity in propane dehydrogenation than Cr(III)/SiO2, consistent with the increased Lewis acidity of the Cr(III) sites, which can favor initial C–H heterolytic splitting of propane. In comparison to the industrial catalyst CrOx/Al2O3, Cr(III)/SiO2-Al2O3 and Cr(III)/Al2O3 are more active but suffer from a decrease in propene selectivity, probably because of the presence of Brønsted acidic sites known to catalyze cracking. In contrast, the propene hydrogenation activity of Cr(III)/SiO2-Al2O3 and Cr(III)/Al2O3 was lower than that of Cr(III)/SiO2 and CrOx/Al2O3. This could be associated with propene inhibition as the result of the presence of the stronger Lewis acid sites for the first two catalysts. Detailed kinetic studies suggest activation enthalpies close to zero or small positive values and large negative activation entropies as well as small positive kinetic isotope effects. Experiments using parahydrogen-induced polarization evidence that H2 addition occurs at least in part in a pairwise fashion: i.e., both H atoms of a H2 molecule end up in the same propane molecule. First-principles calculations on a periodic alumina model show that the most active sites in dehydrogenation and hydrogenation are four-coordinate Cr(III) sites, in contrast to what is expected. All experimental findings combined with DFT computations are consistent with a mechanism involving X–H heterolytic activation (X = R, H), followed by β-hydride transfer or propene insertion and release of H2 and propene or propane, respectively, with an excellent agreement of the experimental and computational activation parameters.

General Considerations
All manipulations were performed under an inert gas atmosphere using Schlenk (Ar), glovebox (Ar), and high-vacuum techniques (10–5 mbar). Benzene was dried over Na/benzophenone and distilled prior to use. Pentane was passed over two columns of activated alumina for drying and then degassed. Propane and propene were passed through BASF Cu catalyst and activated 4 Å molecular sieves prior to use. H2 and D2 were passed through activated 4 Å molecular sieves prior to use. Elemental analyses were performed by the “Mikroanalytisches Labor Pascher” in Remagen, Germany. Infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrophotometer and on a Bruker Alpha transmission IR spectrometer in transmission mode. EPR was measured at X band (9.5 GHz EPR frequency) on a Bruker EMX spectrometer at 110 K. X-ray absorption near edge spectra (XANES) at Cr K edge were measured at the SuperXAS beamline at the Swiss Light Source (SLS, Paul Scherrer Institute, Villigen, Switzerland), a third-generation synchrotron operating at a 2.4 GeV electron energy and a current of 400 mA. The SuperXAS beamline is positioned on one of three superbent ports. The incident beam was collimated by a Si-coated mirror at 2.8 mrad, monochromated using a double-crystal Si(111) monochromator, and focused with a Rh-coated toroidal mirror (at 2.8 mrad) down to 100 × 100 μm with a beam intensity of (4–5) × 1011 ph/s. Calibration of the beamline energy was performed using Cr reference foil (Cr K edge position at 5989.0 eV). XANES were measured in fluorescence mode using a silicon drift Ketek detector. The samples were packed in quartz capillaries (0.01 mm wall thickness, 1.5 mm outer diameter, Hilgenberg GmbH) under an inert atmosphere, sealed with Apiezon vacuum grease and wax, and stored in glass tubes under argon that were opened just before the measurements. Two scans were measured and merged for heterogeneous materials.
Cr(III)/SiO2 (1) was prepared as described previously. (10b)
Alumina-700
ALU C (Evonik) was compacted with H2O and heated to 250 °C for 6 days. The compacted alumina was pestled and sieved to obtain particles with a diameter of 0.25–0.45 mm. Then the alumina was calcined under a flow of synthetic air at 500 °C (ramp 300 °C/h, 500 °C for 18 h) and evacuated under high vacuum (10–5 mbar) for 1 h. A 1 g portion of the calcined alumina was then placed into a quartz reactor, evacuated (10–5 mbar), and treated at 700 °C for 18 h. The obtained Al2O3-700 was stored in a Ar glovebox, and an IR spectrum was collected in the glovebox.
Preparation of 2
Al2O3-700 (506 mg, 0.09 mmol of AlOH) was treated with a solution of Cr(OSi(OtBu)3)3(THF)2 (109 mg, 0.11 mmol, 1.2 equiv per AlOH) in dry benzene. The mixture was stirred for 2.5 h in the glovebox and then filtered and washed with benzene (2 × 5 mL) and pentane (5 mL). The resulting material was dried under high vacuum (10–5 mbar), giving a pale blue material. FeCp2 (27.9 mg, 0.15 mmol) was added to the washings as an internal standard, and an aliquot was taken for 1H NMR analysis. The obtained material (392 mg) was then placed in a reactor, which then was evacuated under high vacuum (10–5 mbar). The material was heated to 300 °C for 1 h (ramp 5 °C/min) and then to 400 °C for 3 h (ramp 5 °C/min), giving the pale blue material 2. The trapped volatiles were analyzed by GC and 1H NMR.
Preparation of 3
Al2O3-700 (540 mg, 0.10 mmol of AlOH) was treated with a solution of Cr(Al(OiPr)4)3 (100 mg, 0.12 mmol, 1.2 equiv per AlOH) in dry benzene. The mixture was stirred for 5 h in the glovebox and then filtered and washed with benzene (4 × 5 mL) and pentane (5 mL). The resulting material was dried under high vacuum (10–5 mbar), giving a pale blue material. FeCp2 (31.3 mg, 0.17 mmol) was added to the washings as an internal standard, and an aliquot was taken for 1H NMR analysis. The obtained material (352 mg) was placed in a reactor, which then was evacuated under high vacuum (10–5 mbar). The material was heated to 300 °C for 1 h (ramp 5 °C/min) and then to 400 °C for 3 h (ramp 5 °C/min), giving the pale blue material 3. The trapped volatiles were analyzed by GC and 1H NMR.
Preparation of an Industrial-Like 1.5 wt % CrOx/Al2O3 Catalyst, 4
To compacted and sieved Alu C (1.0092 g) was added a 0.4 M solution of CrO3 in distilled H2O (0.80 mL). The mixture was stirred under vacuum (Schlenk line) first at room temperature for 10 min, then at 60 °C for 9 h, and then at 120 °C for 4 h. The orange material was transferred to a flow reactor and heated to 550 °C for 5 h (300 °C/h) under a synthetic air flow. Then, the flow reactor was evacuated under high vacuum (10–5 mbar) giving a brown alumina, 4.
Continuous Flow Propane Dehydrogenation Experiments
Typically 70 mg of Cr catalyst was mixed with SiC (2.5 g) and placed in a continuous flow reactor. Argon was flowed through the reactor (10 mL/min) while the reactor was heated to 550 °C. At this temperature, a mixture of propane and Ar (10 mL/min, 1/4 propane/Ar, 2.5 bar, gas hourly space velocity 353 h–1) was passed through the reactor and the output gases were monitored by GC with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for 24 h.
Continuous Flow Propene Hydrogenation Experiments
Typically 200–450 mg of Cr catalyst was mixed with SiC (2.5 g) and placed in a flow reactor. Argon was flowed through the reactor (30 mL/min, 2 bar) while the reactor was heated to 150 or 50 °C. When this temperature was reached, the reactor was closed and bypassed with the initial gas mixture of Ar (23 mL/min), H2 (5 mL/min), and propene (2 mL/min). A background GC was measured. Then the reactor was opened and the gas mixture was flowed through the reactor. The gas mixture was systematically varied while the total gas flow was held constant at 30 mL/min: first the propene flow was held constant and the H2 flow was systematically varied, then the propene flow was held constant, while varying a D2 flow, and then the propene flow was varied while holding the H2 flow constant. Then the flow mixture was set to the initial values of Ar (23 mL/min), H2 (5 mL/min), and propene (2 mL/min) and the temperature was systematically increased from 150 °C to a maximum of 250 °C with 25 °C intervals. At each new reaction mixture or temperature, several GCs were measured of the output mixture and analyzed.
PHIP Experiments
For the hydrogenation of propene over catalysts 1–4 (150–250 mg) in ALTADENA experiments a mixture of propene and p-H2 with 1/4 ratio was used (no balance gas; total pressure 1 atm). Hydrogen gas was enriched with p-H2 up to 50% at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K). The sealed tubes with the catalysts were opened in a glovebox under an argon atmosphere. The catalysts were placed in the middle of the 1/4 in. o.d. stainless steel reactor between two pieces of fiberglass tissue. The reactor was closed with two Swagelok valves (all of these operations were carried out in the glovebox). The reactor temperature was varied from 150 to 550 °C. The reaction mixture was supplied to the reactor and then to the NMR tube placed inside the NMR spectrometer through a Teflon capillary. The gas flow rate was varied from 1.3 to 8.0 mL/s. For propene hydrogenation in a high magnetic field (PASADENA experiment), 30 mg of Cr catalyst was placed at the bottom of a 10 mm screw-cap NMR tube under Ar. Then the tube was positioned inside the NMR magnet. The gas mixture was supplied to the catalyst through a Teflon capillary extended to the bottom of the NMR tube. The NMR tube was heated to 130 °C. The gas flow rate was varied from 1.4 to 5.7 mL/s.
Computational Details
For the description of Al2O3, we used a model with nonspinel sites occupied, on the basis of the simulated dehydration of boehmite. (20b, 25) Upon substitution of AlIII centers by Cr, we used spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations under periodic boundary conditions using the Perdew–Wang (PW91) implementation (26) of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for the correlation and exchange energy functional, using the VASP code (version 5.2). (27) The projected augmented wave (PAW) (28) method was adopted for describing electron–ion interactions. The climbing nudge elastic band method (CI-NEB) (29) was used to determine transition states. The (110) surface of γ- or δ-Al2O3 was based on a previous established model, (20b) which was described by a 8.07 × 8.40 Å unit cell and eight layers (unit formula Al32O48). The inner-slab distance is ca. 24 Å. The Brillouin zone integration was performed with a 3 × 3 × 1 k-point grid generated by the Monkhorst–Pack algorithm. In order to reproduce the properties of extended surfaces, the bottom two layers were kept fixed during the calculation at bulk coordinates, while the top layers were allowed to relax. For the s1 surface, we considered the previous unit cell with one OH bridging two Al centers and one additional proton on the O2a center (corresponding to an OH coverage equal to 3.0 OH/nm2). This s1 surface was referred to as s1c in a previous publication from our group. (20e)

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
