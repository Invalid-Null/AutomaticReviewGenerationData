The document discusses propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalyzed by isolated gallium (Ga) sites on silica oxide (SiO2). However, it does not provide details on conversion, selectivity, stability, deactivation rates, propane production rate, propylene yield, feed composition, partial pressure, temperature, flow rate, catalyst loading, or gas hourly space velocity. The document focuses on computational modeling to evaluate the intrinsic catalytic activity of different Ga sites towards PDH. It does not report any experimental performance data or comparisons. Therefore, I cannot extract the requested catalyst performance information.
