Carbon dioxide reduction in tandem with light-alkane dehydrogenation

Abstract
A greenhouse gas and mild oxidant, CO2 can effect the oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) of light alkanes over heterogeneous catalysts. These catalysts are bifunctional in that they mediate CO2 reduction while oxidizing the alkanes, most notably the C2–C4 components in shale gas. In this way, one obtains CO and alkenes as value-added products. Although desirable, this transformation has proven challenging in terms of catalyst design, with most catalysts for the CO2-ODH being metal oxides that typically undergo rapid deactivation. More recently, bimetallic catalysts have been identified as promising systems to activate alkanes by either selectively cleaving C–H bonds to produce alkenes or breaking all the C–C and C–H bonds to produce the dry reforming products CO and H2. This Review describes general trends in the CO2-ODH of light alkanes. We will also outline how to use a combined approach involving flow reactor experiments, in operando characterization and density functional theory to determine whether a catalyst is intrinsically active for CO2-ODH or dry reforming.

Introduction
Shale gas is an abundant and accessible resource, each component of which may be utilized directly or serve as a precursor to value-added chemicals and fuels. Depending on the source of shale gas, up to 15% v/v of the mixture can comprise C2H6, C3H8 and C4H10, with C2H6 being the most abundant1. Unlike CH4 (ref.2), these light alkanes contain C–C bonds that can be dehydrogenated to produce C2H4, C3H6 and C4H8 isomers (denoted C2=, C3= and C4=, respectively), as well as 1,3-butadiene. The demand for these alkenes is high because they are important petrochemical building blocks. However, the conventional routes to produce the alkenes — thermal steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation (DD) — require high operating temperatures and often suffer from severe catalyst coking problems due to over-oxidation and cracking3,4. Alternatively, light alkenes can be catalytically produced from non-petroleum resources, such as coal and natural gas. However, the methanol-to-olefins (MTO)5 and methanol-to-propylene (MTP) processes6 can produce 6–10 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of olefin7, while the modified Fischer–Tropsch synthesis8 is capital-intensive. This motivates the search for alternative routes to alkenes, which brings us to reactions in which CO2 effects oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) of light alkanes — approaches that involve CO2 reduction to CO in tandem with alkane dehydrogenation to the corresponding alkene (or diene). This tandem process requires a bifunctional catalyst to split the two very different reactants. Given access to suitable catalysts and reactors, we would have the opportunity to efficiently utilize the C2–C4 components in shale gas while also lowering the concentration of a greenhouse gas. If the total C2H4, C3H6, C4H8 and 1,3-butadiene demand (7.77 × 1012 mol yr−1)9 were to be satisfied with the CO2-ODH, assuming that each mole of alkene produced requires a mole of CO2, the process would consume 14.6% of global chemical industry emissions10. More specifically, if we were to source our C2H4 from the CO2-ODH of C2H6, the reaction would offset 9.8% of total global chemical industry CO2 emissions per year and would consume only 0.026% of total global natural gas reserves11, assuming that their C2H6 content is at least 1% v/v1.
In the CO2-ODH reaction, CO2 is a mild oxidant that is not prone to over-oxidizing substrates and does not form an explosive reactive mixture (unlike O2 in the O2-ODH). Relative to direct dehydrogenation, the introduction of CO2 alters the pathway by providing an O atom that combines with the H atoms from the alkane to give H2O, consequently lowering ΔG for the reaction and making the reaction feasible at a lower operating temperature. One must also consider that CO2 can modify the surface and/or bulk composition of a catalyst, and these changes in redox, adsorption and electronic properties can influence activity and selectivity12,13.
The CO2-ODH reaction requires a bifunctional catalyst that dissociates CO2 into CO and a reactive oxygen species *O (the asterisk notation denotes a surface-bound moiety)12,14. The resulting *O would effect dehydrogenation of the adsorbed alkane and give the corresponding alkene and H2O. The best catalysts are oxides of reducible metal ions — metal centres that readily donate abundant lattice O atoms to allow efficient turnover 15. For example, CO2-ODH reactions over Cr oxides have high initial conversion and selectivity because CrIII centres can readily convert into active CrVI forms. However, the Cr oxides have short life cycles, which, in conjunction with their toxicity, preclude commercial implementation. In contrast to oxides of Cr, those of Ga always have the metal in the +III oxidation state, and non-reducible catalysts such as Ga2O3 on an inert support such as MxOy (M = Ti, Zr, Al, Si, Mg) are proposed to operate by a two-step oxidative dehydrogenation mechanism, in which the catalyst first dehydrogenates the alkane to the alkene and H2, after which the H2 combines with CO2 in the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O). The Ga2O3/MxOy catalysts are effective for CO2 activation but bind alkanes at acidic sites that can induce cracking16 — C–C cleavage reactions that lead to coke formation and catalyst deactivation17. These results highlight how we presently lack active and stable bifunctional CO2-ODH catalysts.
A variety of transition-metal compounds have been investigated for their activity in the CO2-ODH of light alkanes. For example, trends in the activity of Cr2O3, MnO2, Fe2O3 and Mo2C catalysts on redox-inactive oxide supports have been reported, but only ex situ catalyst characterization data exist and there is little detailed information regarding the active sites and mechanisms18. Some reviews summarizing the ODH of light alkanes describe the reaction with O2 as the oxidant and only briefly mention the possibility of using CO2 as a mild oxidant19,20,21,22. Other prominent reviews concerning ODH focus on the catalyst properties required for CO2 activation and place less emphasis on describing the catalysts (typically Cr oxides) used for CO2-ODH reactions of C2H6, C3H8 and C4H10 (refs12,23). In the case of CO2-ODH of C3H8 over zeolites and Cr, V, Ga and In oxides, the high temperatures at which alkane conversion is thermodynamically favoured also favour C–C scission over C–H scission, thereby substantially lowering selectivity for the desired alkene24,25. Thus, an important characteristic of a CO2-ODH catalyst is that it must selectively break C–H bonds while preserving C–C bonds in order to avoid CO2 oxidative dry reforming (DR), whereby CO2 and the alkane are converted into CO and H2.
This Review focuses on how to improve a catalyst’s selectivity for C–H scission over C–C scission pathways. We limit our scope to stable bimetallic and metal-modified carbide catalysts, and provide an atomistic description of these examples in terms of the active sites for the CO2-ODH of light alkanes. Our emphasis is on the importance of combining catalytic measurements, in situ (often referred to as in operando or simply operando) characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to identify reaction mechanisms and key descriptors that can be used to rationally design improved CO2-ODH catalysts.
Thermodynamic analysis
We conducted thermodynamics analyses of the CO2-ODH of alkanes, assuming atmospheric pressure feeds and allowing the temperature to vary (HSC Chemistry Outotec v8 software, which utilizes a Gibbs free-energy-minimization algorithm). We considered both the one-step mechanism CnH2n+2 + CO2 → CnH2n + CO + H2O (n = 2–4) and a two-step mechanism involving DD CnH2n+2 → CnH2n + H2, followed by the RWGS reaction. What becomes obvious is that, as mentioned above, acceptorless DD affords lower equilibrium alkene yields than the case in which CO2 is the H2 acceptor (Fig. 1a illustrates this in the case of C2H6). Other thermodynamics studies indicate that alkanes undergo a two-step pathway in the presence of CO2, with higher equilibrium conversions than when they are in an inert gas. These conversions are higher than those for the one-step CO2-ODH pathway18,26. The Gibbs free-energy changes of the CO2-ODH reactions of alkanes become more negative with higher alkanes (i-C4 > C3 > n-C4 > C2), perhaps reflecting the favourability of forming more substituted alkenes24. Our thermodynamics analyses afforded plots of ΔG versus T, where T is temperature, for CO2-ODHE, dry reforming (DRE, E signifies ethane) and direct dehydrogenation (DDE) of C2H6, as well as the RWGS reaction, the reverse Boudouard reaction and the CO2-ODH of C3H8 and C4H10 (Fig. 1b).

Decomposition or cracking reactions can occur at the temperatures at which the CO2-ODH reaction proceeds. However, CO2 can consume the resulting coke through a comproportionation known as the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C → 2CO). High reaction temperatures favour DRE because it affords several molar equivalents of CO and H2, such that the ΔS for formation of the synthesis gas is large and positive. Equilibrium calculations have demonstrated that the yield of alkene and the composition of synthesis gas can be varied by altering the reaction temperature and CO2:alkane ratio27.
CO2-ODH of light alkanes over oxide catalysts
The most prevalent catalysts for CO2-ODH of light alkanes are oxides3,24,28 of Cr (refs29,30,31), V (refs32,33,34), Ga (refs35,36) and, to a lesser extent, In (refs37,38) and Co (refs39,40,41). The catalytic activity of transition-metal oxides is typically attributed to their redox activity, which is necessary to effect O atom transfers. Less well-examined catalysts include Ca-doped ThO2 (ref.42) and CaO doped into nanostructured CeO2 (ref.43). The support for the catalytically active oxide usually takes the form of a high-surface-area mixed oxide44,45,46, mesoporous SiO2 (ref.47) or a zeolite48. A catalytically active, reducible, high-valent metal oxide can readily donate an O atom to serve as a H2 acceptor for the alkane. To complete this redox-type Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, the metal centre undergoes oxidation by CO2 to fill the lattice O vacancy49 (Fig. 2a). The support can influence the acid–base properties and the distribution of reactive metal-oxide groups on the catalyst surface, and is, thus, not to be neglected because it can shift catalytic activity50,51.

Cr oxide catalysts
Cr oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH can give high C2H6 conversions even after short reaction times, but the selectivity for CO2 conversion is low and the catalysts have short life cycles because they are unstable towards coking52. Cr oxides exhibit their highest activity and selectivity when supported by materials such as SiO2, siliceous MCM-41 and H-ZSM-5 with high SiO2 content27,53. Although Cr oxides can be incorporated into mesoporous structures to afford more active species, much of the Cr in these materials exists as inactive polychromates and the materials thus show greater selectivity for undesired products54. The oxidation state of Cr in a CrOx catalyst for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 depends on whether the catalyst is supported on Al2O3, ZrO2, CeO2 or CexZr1−xO2 (ref.46). The CrOx/γ-Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 composites exhibit the highest ODHE activities but operate through different pathways. Thus, CrOx/γ-Al2O3 primarily works by the two-step DDE and RWGS mechanism, and can undergo deactivation if cracking affords substantial coke. By contrast, CrOx/ZrO2 performs CO2-ODH in a single step (albeit in competition with DR) and its mode of deactivation involves sintering or conversion into inactive Cr species. Instead, when CrOx is on CeO2, it is less active but more stable because the reverse Boudouard reaction can readily consume coke deposits. Studies on the CO2-ODHP (P signifies propane) reaction at 873 K concluded that CrOx/SiO2 would exhibit increased activity and C3H6 selectivity with increasing CO2 partial pressure, whereas the activity of CrOx/γ-Al2O3 would decrease with even a slight increase in the CO2 partial pressure27,50,53. The different performance between these two supports was attributed to two factors: CO2 adsorbs more strongly on γ-Al2O3 (thereby competing with C3H8 adsorption) and/or CO2 affects the acid–base properties of CrOx/γ-Al2O3.
The activation of CO2 over CrOx dispersed in MCM-41 has been attributed to isolated CrVI centres generated from CrIII in a redox cycle55,56,57,58,59 (Fig. 2b). Increasing the Cr content to 8 wt% affords the greatest CrVI:CrIII ratios and increased alkane conversion60,61. Further increasing the Cr content of supported catalysts affords uneven distributions of larger particles, which tend to agglomerate into α-Cr2O3 and increase the concentration of inactive polychromate species3,49,56,58,62. CrVI=O species dehydrogenate alkanes to the respective alkene more quickly than the resulting CrIII species undergo reoxidation by abstracting O from CO2 (ref.30). Thus, even highly dispersed CrOx catalysts with an appropriate Cr loading undergo deactivation because their CrIII sites are relatively inactive and the materials eventually experience coking58. For instance, CrOx/MCM-41 nanocatalysts for the CO2-ODH of C2H6 at 823 K show high initial selectivity for C2H4 (90%) but low maximum conversion of C2H6 (<8%)61. After 12 h on stream, the catalyst was deactivated and only maintained 30% selectivity towards the alkene. Doping the catalyst with Fe, Co or Mn improved C2H4 selectivity because the presence of the metals increases the concentration of weakly acidic sites that facilitate C2H6 activation. Moreover, doping leads to a decrease in the number of strong acid sites that mediate reforming and cracking63. The low conversion exhibited by CrOx/SiO2 in CO2-ODH catalysis can be improved by doping in Ni, an element that has strong chemisorption of CO2 (ref.64). Despite these advances, Cr catalysts remain only rarely implemented owing to their short life cycles, as well as the high toxicity of CrIII necessitating meticulous care during the preparation, use and disposal of the materials.
V oxide catalysts
As with Cr oxide catalysts for CO2-ODH, the activity of V derivatives also depends on the nature of the supports due to the latter’s effects on reducibility, acid–base properties and dispersion24,65. Supported VOx catalysts are more selective than bulk V2O5 because VOx–support interactions can stabilize particularly active VOx surface structures. DFT calculations and isotopic labelling experiments on the CO2-ODH of alkanes over (supported or unsupported) V-based catalysts indicate that both a one-step oxidative dehydrogenation pathway or a two-step pathway with the RWGS reaction are possible66,67. Because the majority of V-based catalysts operate through a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism68, a greater participation of O atoms from the support improves alkene selectivity, as observed for V2O5/CeO2–ZrO2 in the CO2-ODH of C4H10 (ref.69). The inclusion of CeO2 as part of the support increases O mobility and vacancy concentration relative to pure ZrO2, while also affording some CeVO4. In general, mixed-oxide supports have improved activity relative to single oxides due to greater acid–base bifunctionality70. If the supports are only acidic, then they can only interact weakly with V2O5, such that this oxide forms poorly dispersed crystallites12. Indeed, polymeric V species led to low alkene yield, again indicating that dispersion is a key factor in controlling selectivity71,72,73. A DFT study on the plausible VOx species (monomeric, dimeric, polymeric, compared with bulk) present on the support revealed that the optimal size of V2O5 differed when SiO2 or CeO2 was chosen as the support. In addition, although there is no energetic preference for larger or smaller species, there is a kinetic preference for dimers because they can perform the rate-determining H-abstraction step faster than the other species can74. Thus, taking these observations into account, it has been shown that V2O5 dispersed in mesoporous SiO2 nanospheres can exhibit 90% propylene selectivity during 8-h cycles, with the conversion decreasing from 60% to 20 % within one cycle75. This catalytic performance was maintained only for eight reaction–regeneration cycles (64 h on stream). Overall, progress on developing V2O5 catalysts is promising, but the presence of acidic sites that promote the cracking of alkenes remains a challenge, and there are also health concerns regarding V2O5 dust.
In and Ga oxides
The metal centres in In oxides can undergo reduction (InIII to In0) but cannot be reoxidized by CO2 under typical reaction conditions, such that these catalysts operate through a two-step CO2-ODH pathway37,38,76. Among In2O3/MOx bimetallic, mixed-oxide catalysts (M = Al, Zn, Zr, Ti, Fe, Mg, Si and Ce)77, In2O3/CeO2 has the lowest CO2-ODH activity77, despite its reported utility in catalysing the RWGS reaction when synthesized as a In2O3–CeO2 mixture78. By contrast, In2O3/Al2O3 affords the highest yield of C3H6 and exhibits good stability because In2O3 is highly dispersed and the material has a balance between acid and base properties. In a separate study, fresh and unreduced In2O3/Al2O3 undergoes induction over 3 h, during which it increases in activity as the concentration of In0 sites increases, as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) studies38. Catalytic activity and TPR data suggest that the initial generation and stabilization of optimal surface concentrations of In0 species are crucial for activity. Consistent with these findings, the prereduced catalyst did not require an induction period and had similar C3H6 selectivity and only slightly less conversion than the fresh catalyst sample38. Moreover, as with Cr and V oxide catalysts, the support plays a crucial role by affecting the dispersion of In2O3 and acid–base properties.
Ga oxide catalysts for the CO2-ODH differ from those described above because the former are typically not redox-active over the relevant potential range and the catalysts operate through heterolytic dissociation of the alkane and activation of CO2 (refs49,79,80). Unsupported Ga2O3 has a high initial C3H6 selectivity (30%) but, after 10 min, the selectivity decreases to less than 10% because coke formation deactivates the material81. Among a series of Ga2O3 catalysts supported on TiO2, ZrO2, γ-Al2O3, SiO2 or MgO, only Ga2O3/TiO2 exhibits an enhancement in activity and selectivity for alkene production in the presence of CO2, which can readily remove chemisorbed H atoms on the catalyst surface through the RWGS reaction16. The lower activity of Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3 in particular was attributed to CO2 competing with the alkane for Ga binding, such that the alkane is displaced to basic catalyst sites. In general, when Ga2O3 is on a support and exposed to CO2, it binds C3H8 too weakly to rapidly effect its conversions. The competitive binding is not observed for Ga2O3/TiO2 under low partial pressures of CO2 but is dominant at all pressures when Al2O3 or ZrO2 are used as supports. Thus, the role of CO2 over Ga-based catalysts is largely dependent on the support. So, we can say that Ga oxides outperform Cr and V oxides, but the unsupported materials still exhibit low stability and tolerance to coking and the supported materials bind CO2 too strongly relative to alkanes.
CO2-ODH over bimetallic and carbide catalysts
The electronic and catalytic properties of a transition metal can be modified by alloying it with C or another metal. The resulting metal carbides82 or bimetallic alloys83 are often quite distinct from their parent metals, presenting an opportunity to design new catalysts with enhanced CO2-ODH selectivity and stability84. Bimetallic catalysts are typically supported on high-surface-area metal oxides. For example, CO2 hydrogenation85 proceeds rapidly over bimetallics supported by CeO2 because it is a reducible support that can release O atoms and then recover them86 by inducing direct C=O scission87. The abundance of reactive lattice O atoms protects the material because any coke deposits that form can be readily removed by oxidation88,89. Thus, supporting catalysts on CeO2 should promote the activation of CO2, while the choice of the bimetallic should influence selectivity43,90,91. The conversion of C2H6 has been investigated over CeO2-supported bimetallic catalysts Co3Pt1, Co3Mo1, Ni3Mo1 and Fe3Ni1 (note that, throughout this Review, the formulae denote element ratios and do not describe small clusters of metals). Experiments were conducted at 823 K, a temperature at which both CO2-ODH and the competing DR may occur. In this way, it was possible to identify the systems that selectively break C–H bonds of C2H6 to produce C2H4, and the less desirable systems that break C–C bonds to produce CO as the only carbonaceous product92. Flow reactions over Fe3Ni1/CeO2 afforded C2H4 by means of selective C–H cleavage. The supported bimetallic catalyst is more stable than the supported monometallics Fe/CeO2 and Ni/CeO2, motivating investigations into how FexNiy active sites bind CO2 and C2H6, and favour C–H scission to afford high C2H4 selectivity93.
CO2-ODH of C2H6 over FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts
In the following sections, we use the CO2-ODH of C2H6 over FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts as a case study to illustrate the importance of combining catalytic measurements with in situ characterization and DFT calculations. This will be supplemented with discussion of CO2-ODH of other light alkanes over bimetallic and carbide catalysts.
Flow reactor evaluation of activity and selectivity
The flow reactor results for the conversion of C2H6 and CO2 over FexNiy/CeO2 indicate that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 has the highest C2H4 selectivity (>75%), while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 has the highest yield of CO (with CO selectivity >98%) by means of DR (Fig. 3a). The selectivities were almost unchanged at comparable C2H6 conversions (Fig. 3b), suggesting that the difference comes from intrinsic kinetics. By considering how C2H4 selectivity changes with C2H6 conversion over Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 3c), we see that C2H4 is the primary reaction product and surmise that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 is a promising CO2-ODH catalyst. Notably, Ni/CeO2 is an excellent reforming catalyst, while Fe/CeO2 is a poor catalyst for both reactions. So, the high selectivity that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 shows for the CO2-ODH can be inferred to arise from distinct active sites in which Fe interacts with Ni (Fig. 3d).

In situ and ex situ characterization of active sites
The structural properties of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe1Ni3/CeO2 are evident from in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns93, while the oxidation state of Ni and Fe come from in situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data93. In both catalysts, Ni exists as Ni0 (Fig. 4a), while Fe sites exhibit near edge features between those of FeO and Fe3O4 (closer to Fe3O4; Fig. 4b). Detailed extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting results suggest that metallic Ni or FeNi alloys make up particles of diameters 2.5–4.0 nm. The existence of Fe–Ce bonding and the low number of O atoms coordinated to Fe sites indicate that the oxidized Fe species exist as thin layers on CeO2, which can be corroborated using ex situ annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)93. The high-resolution micrographs indicated that the CeO2 particles in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (Fig. 5a,b) differ from those in Fe1Ni3/CeO2 (Fig. 5c,d), because the former catalyst has CeO2 in contact with a thin layer of FeOx (Fig. 5e), as also evidenced by EELS line scan profiles (Fig. 5f).

The above characterization data allow the active sites for CO2-ODH and DR to be deduced93. In Ni/CeO2 catalysts, CeO2 helps enable facile CO2 dissociation to give a *O species that participates in C2H6 activation on the Ni particles at the Ni–CeO2 interfaces. When a small amount of Fe was added, the resulting Fe1Ni3/CeO2 materials feature Ni–CeOx interfacial sites that process C2H6 and CO2 faster than other sites, and allow the catalyst to maintain high CO selectivity (>95%). The Ni–CeOx interfaces were thus identified as the most likely active sites for DR of C2H6 with CO2 over Fe1Ni3/CeO2 (Fig. 6). When a large amount of Fe was introduced, a material of formula Fe3Ni1/CeO2 resulted, which has amorphous FeOx regions that extend far enough to form Ni–FeOx interfacial sites on the perimeter of Ni particles (these probably form at the expense of Ni–CeOx sites). It appears likely that the Ni–FeOx interfaces are responsible for the high activity of Fe1Ni3/CeO2 for CO2-ODH of C2H6.
Fig. 6: Conversion of C2H6 and CO2 occurs at interfacial sites of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts.
Interfacial Ni–FeOx sites perform selective C–H cleavage of C2H6 to dehydrogenate it in tandem with CO2 reduction to produce C2H4. By contrast, Ni–CeOx sites perform C–H and C–C cleavage and mediate the dry reforming of C2H6 with CO2 to produce synthesis gas93.

DFT calculations of reactions on FeNi surfaces
The in situ measurements give us an idea of the possible FeNi structures responsible for catalytic activity. These candidate structures can be studied using DFT calculations to investigate possible reaction pathways for the oxidative C–H bond cleavage (dehydrogenation; Fig. 7) and C–C bond scission (reforming). The calculated enthalpy changes suggest that the first step along the C–H bond cleavage pathway is thermodynamically more favourable than the C–C bond cleavage pathway on FeOx/Ni(111). Comparing the activation energy (Ea) for each process, the *O-mediated scission of the first C–H bond in C2H6 is likely the most difficult step in the oxidative C–H and C–C cleavage of C2H6. On Ni(111), *O insertion (*C2H5 + *O → *OC2H5 + *, where the latter asterisk denotes a free surface site) is part of the C–C cleavage pathway (∆E = −0.14 eV and Ea = 0.44 eV) and is thermodynamically and kinetically more favourable than oxidative dehydrogenation (*C2H5 + *O → *C2H4 + *OH) along the C–H cleavage pathway (∆E = 0.09 eV and Ea = 0.97 eV). On Ni-terminated Ni3Fe(111), *O insertion to form *OC2H5 should occur at a comparable rate to oxidative dehydrogenation to give *C2H4. On bulk-terminated Ni3Fe(111), the activation energy of oxidative dehydrogenation is 0.16 eV lower than that for *O insertion. As a result, bulk-terminated Ni3Fe(111) likely promotes C–H cleavage in preference to C–C cleavage, suggesting that the presence of surface Fe sites is essential for selective C–H cleavage and C2H4 formation. Furthermore, the DFT calculations on FeOx/Ni(111) show that oxidative dehydrogenation (∆E = −0.13 eV and Ea = 1.08 eV) is more favourable than *O insertion (∆E = −0.04 eV and Ea = 1.67 eV). Thus, in agreement with the experimental results, the DFT calculations predict that the Ni–FeOx interface should be active for the dehydrogenation of C2H6, leading to the high CO2-ODH selectivity93.

CO2-ODH of C2H6 over carbide-based catalysts
Metal carbides such as Mo2C are highly attractive catalysts for CO2-ODH reactions because they are active for CO2 and alkane activation and have redox properties similar to those of reducible oxides94,95,96,97,98. For example, Mo2C and Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 showed enhanced selectivity towards C2H4 production through the CO2-ODH pathway99. The DFT-calculated energy profiles of oxidative dehydrogenation and reforming of C2H6 over Mo2C(001) illustrated that oxidative C–H cleavage to give *C2H4 and H2 is energetically more favourable than C–C scission to form reforming products. The calculations indicate that Mo2C(001) has a very high affinity to adsorb atomic O. Flow reactor experiments were consistent with these predictions, and the Mo2C catalyst showed a C2H4 selectivity of 60%. These experiments also highlighted the different activities of unsupported and supported Mo2C. Mo2C supported on CeO2 showed lower activity than unsupported Mo2C, but the latter has slightly higher activity when supported on γ-Al2O3, a more acidic oxide. The low steady-state activity of Mo2C/CeO2 was attributed to the high initial intrinsic activity of CeO2 and Mo2C for C=O bond scission, resulting in an excess of *O on the surface that deactivates Mo2C/CeO2 through complete oxidation. The Mo2C/γ-Al2O3 catalyst also suffers from deactivation because it binds the *C2H4 product strongly, such that C2H4 undergoes decomposition and/or polymerization to form coke. In situ XANES measurements showed that, although CO2 is necessary to form an oxycarbide phase that dehydrogenates C2H6, excessive CO2 can lead to complete deactivation. Catalyst regeneration is possible by co-feeding H2 (5 vol%) with the reactants or by exposing the catalyst to H2 after the reaction. Lastly, we note that the selectivity and stability of Mo2C catalysts for CO2-ODH of C2H6 can be enhanced by partial oxidation of Mo2C, which affords a material that is slower at C–C cleavage of C2H6 and better at producing C2H4 (ref.100). Furthermore, the introduction of Fe accelerated the formation of *O, which increases C2H4 yield and improves catalyst stability.
CO2-ODH of C3H8 and C4H10
Just as experimental and DFT approaches were applied to reactions of CO2 + C2H6, a similar treatment can be done for CO2 + C3H8 at 823 K. The catalysts examined included bimetallic systems comprising a precious metal (Pt or Pd) and a non-precious metal (Fe, Co or Ni), and combinations of non-precious metals, all supported on CeO2 (ref.101). The results of steady-state flow reactions identified Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Ni3Pt1/CeO2 as promising catalysts for CO2-ODH and DRP of C3H8, respectively102 (Fig. 8). The average metal particle sizes of the Ni3Pt/CeO2 (~2.3-nm particles, from TEM) and Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (<2-nm particles, from in situ XRD) systems are small. Fe3Ni1/CeO2 exhibits 58% C3H6 selectivity with good stability, while Ni3Pt/CeO2 is a highly active DRP catalyst with 96% selectivity for CO. Additionally, the amount of CO produced by Fe3Ni1 exceeds that expected from C3H6 + H2O (as a result of one-step CO2-ODH and subtracting contributions from the RWGS reaction), indicating that some CO comes from the reverse Boudouard reaction and/or over-oxidation of alkenes or lighter components. Unlike oxidations with O2, which produce CO2 due to over-oxidation, the CO2-ODH reaction results in a net reduction of CO2 because CO2 is consumed instead of being produced. Plotting CO2 conversion against CO selectivity for Fe3Ni1 and Ni3Pt1 can also clarify the intrinsic activity of the catalysts for CO2-ODHP or DRP. In the case of Ni3Pt1, the high value of the y-intercept of CO selectivity (97%) suggests that it is a typical reforming catalyst, while the same cannot be said for Fe3Ni1 (22.2%). Additional experiments showed differences among the C3H6 yields of Fe3Ni (1.6%) and the respective monometallic catalysts (0.4% for Ni and 0.2% for Fe), indicating that the two elements operate synergistically.

According to in situ XANES measurements, Ni3Pt/CeO2 features Pt0, while both Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni3Pt/CeO2 include Ni0. By contrast, Fe in Fe3Ni/CeO2 exists in oxidized forms that were independently confirmed by in situ EXAFS, which suggested the presence of Fe–O–Fe and Fe–O groups under reaction conditions102. Of the other bimetallic systems examined, only FeCo catalysts illustrated a preference to form C3H6, albeit before undergoing a rapid deactivation. In situ XANES results showed that Fe3Co1 consists mainly of Co0 and oxidized Fe, but the extent of Fe oxidation was lower than that in Fe3Ni1, which may be the cause of the lower observed steady-state activity and stability of Fe3Co1/CeO2.
The knowledge that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 comprises Ni0 and oxidized Fe motivated a DFT study into both bulk-terminated Fe3Ni(111) and the FeO–Ni(111) interface. The calculations illustrated that both systems should energetically favour C–H scission (as part of CO2-ODH) over C–C scission (for DRP), although opposite behaviour was predicted for Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111). These results also show that the binding configurations of all intermediates on Fe3Ni(111) and Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) are similar, and all intermediates bind more strongly to the Fe3Ni(111) surface. Thus, Pt-terminated Ni3Pt(111) binds *O only moderately strongly, such that it can react rapidly with *CxHy to form *OCxHy, an oxygenated intermediate in reforming. Conversely, Fe3Ni(111) binds *O strongly, such that the group remains on the surface and facilitates selective C–H scission and the formation of C3H6. Overall, the combined approach of flow reactor experiments (including kinetic measurements), in situ and ex situ characterization, and DFT calculations allows chemists to identify and understand the intrinsic activity of heterogeneous catalysts for the CO2-ODH of C3H8.
The approach to studying conversions of CO2 and C2H6 or C3H8 over FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts is, of course, also applicable when C4H10 is used as the alkane feed at 873 K. The reaction pathways are similarly affected by the catalyst composition and the choice of support103, with flow reactions illustrating that Fe3Ni1/CeO2 favours 1,3-butadiene formation, while Fe1Ni3/CeO2 favours DR. Supporting Fe3Ni1 on different oxides illustrates that highly reducible supports with mobile lattice O atoms, such as CeO2 and CeO2–ZrO2, favour the production of 1,3-butadiene, whereas ZrO2 suppresses oxidative dehydrogenation activity. According to thermogravimetric analysis and in situ XRD measurements, Fe3Ni1/CeO2 does not readily coke or experience surface metal agglomeration under reaction conditions, consistent with the results obtained for the reactions of CO2 and C3H8.
In situ XANES measurements of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts indicate that its Ni centres are metallic, whereas Fe mainly exists as FeOx (ref.103). The linear combination fitting of data for Fe1Ni3/CeO2 indicates that Ni exists solely as Ni0, but only a third of the Fe species were reduced to Fe0, the remaining fraction being in the form of Fe2O3. For the Fe3Ni1 catalyst, 90% of the Ni sites were metallic and Fe exists as Fe0 (19%), FeO (7%), Fe3O4 (28%) and Fe2O3 (44%). DFT calculations of the oxidative dehydrogenation and reforming pathways on Ni(111) and FeOx/Ni(111) surfaces predict that Ni(111) should favour C–C scission, while FeOx/Ni(111) could promote C–H cleavage. Over Ni(111), the initial step of C–C cleavage is more favourable than the corresponding step in C–H scission. At the FeO–Ni(111) interface, the initial steps in C–H and C–C cleavage are in competition, but the subsequent two steps of C–H scission are more energetically favourable and afford surface-bound 1,3-butadiene. Overall, flow reactor studies of FexNiy/CeO2 catalysts for the CO2-ODH of C4H10 provide insight into the effect of oxide supports. Two major deactivation pathways — coking and metal agglomeration — do not occur when FexNiy catalysts are supported on CeO2 during the CO2-ODH of C4H10. More importantly, the trends identified in experimental results and DFT calculations are similar to those observed using C2H6 and C3H8, suggesting that the lessons learned concerning the CO2-ODH of light alkanes can be generalized to more complex hydrocarbons.
Challenges and opportunities
The tandem reactions of CO2 reduction and CO2-ODH of light alkanes have the potential to satisfy global alkene production while consuming underutilized fractions of shale gas and lowering net anthropogenic CO2 emissions. This chemistry presents several challenges, such as the need for a selective bifunctional catalyst that can activate CO2 and selectively transform the alkane into the respective alkene, even at temperatures at which side reactions are highly thermodynamically favourable. At temperatures above 823 K, the reactions of CO2 with alkanes may simultaneously occur through two distinct pathways: CO2-ODH or DR. The toxicity and instability of previously examined oxide catalysts motivate the development of environmentally benign CO2-ODH catalysts that are highly selective and stable. This Review has, thus, focused on catalysts bearing less toxic metals and how we can study them using flow reactor experiments, in situ characterization and DFT calculations. In this way, we will create a design platform for safer catalysts that are intrinsically active and selective for the CO2-ODH of light alkanes.
Future research into the CO2-ODH of light alkanes should focus on the design of catalysts that give rise to improved alkene yields. The combined experimental and theoretical methods discussed here can be used to identify descriptors such as oxidation state, nature of oxygenated intermediates and *O binding energy. These parameters indicate how the selectivity and activity of a CO2-ODH catalyst arise from its mechanism of action. Addressing the dependence of alkene selectivity on the binding strength and configuration of all intermediates can clarify the distinct functions and, possibly, the nature of active sites that are necessary for a promising CO2-ODH catalyst. In situ characterization techniques can help identify active sites under reaction conditions. The identification and subsequent targeted synthesis of particular active sites are among the key steps necessary to pave the way towards large-scale commercialization.
The nature of the support influences the CO2-ODH mechanism because it can influence how a metal catalyst binds and activates CO2 and alkanes. Systems that feature a reducible oxide support such as CeO2 warrant further investigation, as do systems featuring metal-modified carbide catalysts. We have emphasized here the importance of redox activity and lattice O atom mobility in CO2 activation, but the correlation between O storage capacity/mobility and alkene yields is not well understood. Further examining the role of oxide supports in CO2-ODH catalysts will enable a more rational optimization of both activity and selectivity for alkene products. Thus, it is of interest to target high-surface-area oxide supports with high concentrations of sites that enable CO2 activation87.
CO2-ODH reactions will ultimately produce a mixture of alkenes, H2O and CO, which are present with the unreacted CO2 and alkane feed. Once we have identified suitable catalysts and conditions, it will be necessary to address a further problem — separating the gaseous species. Thus, scale-up will require creative solutions in the form of reactive separation methods or process designs, the latter taking the form of novel reactors or separators. To make a more substantial dent in anthropogenic CO2 emissions, it would be highly desirable to directly use CO2-ODH product mixtures as feeds for useful chemistries. For instance, it would be attractive to oxidatively couple CO2 with alkenes to produce acrylic acids and acrylate in a one-step process that would replace an energy-intensive, two-step methodology (alkene to acrolein, followed by acrolein to acrylate)13. Equally ambitious would be the heterogeneous catalysis of C2H4 hydroformylation104. However, heterogeneous hydroformylation chemistries typically result in poorer performance than their well-established homogeneous counterparts, due to a lack of fundamental mechanistic understanding of heterogeneous catalysts.
The one-pot synthesis of oxygenates from CO2 and light alkanes105, using a single or consecutive catalyst bed arrangement, is highly desirable because it facilitates reactive separations by producing value-added oxygenates such as C3H7OH (ref.106). Another possible scheme, which could run under similar conditions to CO2-ODH, involves tandem reactions of CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation and aromatization of light alkanes. The direct transformation of alkanes into aromatics without the need for naphtha is economically attractive and also increases the consumption of CO2 per mole of value-added product, which is more easily separated because the aromatics typically exist as liquids.
Overall, CO2 reduction in tandem with light-alkane transformations over specialized bifunctional catalysts has the potential to produce alkenes while eliminating a greenhouse gas. Before these reactions can be implemented on a large scale, we must address challenges such as catalyst development, finding optimal synthesis techniques and product separation. We have focused here on how to characterize catalyst platforms through combined experimental and theoretical efforts, which can provide the crucial mechanistic understanding required to expedite the development of selective and stable CO2-ODH catalysts.
