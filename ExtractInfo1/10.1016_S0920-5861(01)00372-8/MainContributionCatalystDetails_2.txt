 Based on the details provided in the document, this does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses modeling of a novel rotating monolith reactor design, but does not provide details on a specific catalyst composition or performance for propane dehydrogenation. Since the relevance is unclear, I will output "no" for the relevance and leave the rest of the XML elements empty.
