ANIMAL BEHAVIOR
Individuality in avian predators

The hunting preferences of the barn owl (shown here) and other birds are an evolutionary adaptation to how their prey vary their survival strategies.

In an ergodic system, the average behavior of an individual over time resembles the average behavior of many individuals at a single time. The ergodicity of a system, or the lack thereof, is important for understanding any large-scale phenomenon such as the stock market or the migratory patterns of species. Vilk et al. tracked a total of 70 birds, all avian predators, including barn owls, black-winged kites, and common kestrels, and found that they exhibited ergodic behaviors when cruising over long distances but nonergodic behaviors when foraging over short distances. The authors believe that the nonergodic hunting preferences of the individual birds are an evolutionary adaptation to how their prey vary their survival strategies.

Reusing solvent in nanoparticle synthesis
Phil Szuromi
Colloidal synthesis of metal nanoparticles can create tighter size distributions and potentially greater control of reactivity in heterogeneous catalysis than conventional methods such as wet impregnation. However, colloidal synthesis is a costly alternative because solvents and surfactants are normally used only once. Wrasman et al. added an antisolvent mixture of 2-propanol and ethanol to precipitate the nanoparticles after colloidal synthesis and then recovered the hydrocarbon solvent and unused surfactant through distillation. Synthesis of metal nanoparticles such palladium and silver, and alloys such as platinum-tin, could be repeated up to 10 times with the recovered materials while maintaining the initial size distributions. These nanoparticles delivered highly reproducible results in reactions such as propane dehydrogenation and may offer a cost-competitive alternative as catalysts.

Legacies of drought
Pamela J. Hines
Drought affects aboveground plants, as well as their belowground associated microbial and fungal communities, to influence plant growth. Lozano et al. show that soil microbial communities carry the effects of previous drought even into water-replete situations. A variety of grassland species, including graminoids, forbs, and legumes, were grown in soil that had previously hosted plants in drought or well-watered conditions. Root morphology showed changes characteristic of water scarcity when plants were grown in soil that had previously experienced drought even though the plants themselves had not. Soil that has experienced drought may be deficient in mycorrhizal fungal mutualists. As a result, plants growing in drought soil may grow thicker roots to encourage the establishment of mutualistic associations from depleted soil.

Managing lake water quality
Caroline Ash
Large bodies of freshwater are under increasing threat from climate change and human activities. The clear waters of Lake Geneva risk eutrophication and declining deepwater oxygen because of organic matter and phosphorus inputs that promote algal growth. Deyle et al. applied machine learning to time-series data for Lake Geneva to gain a more precise understanding of the variables affecting water quality. There have been efforts to reduce phosphorus inputs, but success has been limited, in part because increasing ambient temperature also promotes algal growth. Interdependencies among biogeochemical variables were included in a machine-learning approach coupled with conventional models for predicting deep lake–dissolved oxygen levels. The combined approach offers more nuanced guidance for lake water quality management.

Women choosing greener pastures
Melissa McCartney
Women faculty remain under-represented in chemistry because of a lack of applicants. Howe et al. surveyed 130 women and found that themes of overwork, unrealistic expectations, and an emphasis on research over teaching and mentoring were the underlying reasons that women looked elsewhere for employment. Further analysis revealed that women felt unsupported during graduate school and extrapolated this lack of support to faculty positions. This suggests that graduate-level experiences inform interests and career goals, and that systemic changes for increasing the diversity of faculty need to be made at the graduate level. Collectively, the results show that diversifying faculty positions is much more than simply opening a position. Instead, it requires policy changes that explicitly value women and their ideals.

Exercise boosts tumor immunity
Priscilla N. Kelly
Exercise has many positive effects on the body, including improved blood circulation, heart strengthening, and weight control. Kurz et al. report that aerobic exercise is also associated with reduced tumor growth in models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. They showed that exercise enhanced the survival of a type of immune cell called CD8+ T lymphocytes, which are known for their ability to kill tumors. Greater numbers of CD8+ T cells capable of infiltrating tumors were found to accumulate as a result of an exercise regimen. The anti-tumor effects were mediated through the interleukin-15 (IL-15) axis, and pharmacological targeting of the IL-15/IL-15Rα pathway slowed tumor growth, particularly when combined with immunotherapy and chemotherapy treatments.

Gender inequality
Ekeoma Uzogara
Do inequities in women’s editorships associate with an underrepresentation of women authors? Last et al. examined the association between women’s editorship and women’s authorship across randomly selected journals in infectious diseases spanning each impact factor quartile. Only 33% of infectious disease journals’ editors-in-chief were found to be women. While controlling for journal impact factor, analysis of over 10,000 citable infectious diseases articles found that although nearly 50% of first authors were women, only 35% of last authors were women. Moreover, the presence of more women editors was associated with more women first authors, as well as more women last authors.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
