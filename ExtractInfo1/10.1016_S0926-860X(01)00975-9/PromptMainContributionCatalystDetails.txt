Preparation, characterization and activity testing of vanadia catalysts deposited onto silica and alumina supports by atomic layer deposition
Abstract
A gas phase preparation technique, atomic layer deposition (ALD), was applied to synthesize supported vanadium oxide catalysts. The growth of vanadia on silica and alumina was achieved by chemisorption of the volatilized vanadium precursor onto surface hydroxyl groups of the support, followed by oxidative treatment in air. The influence of the preparative method on surface structure, redox and acidic properties and catalytic activity was demonstrated by examining also the corresponding conventionally impregnated catalysts. The catalysts were characterized by chemical analysis, BET surface area measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and
solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (
NMR). Tetracoordinated surface vanadia species were detected as the principal vanadium species in all the catalysts studied. The ALD catalysts, compared to the analogous impregnated ones, were found to be highly dispersed and more easily reduced, as revealed by temperature programmed reduction (TPR). The results from measurements using ammonia adsorption microcalorimetry and pyridine adsorption infrared (IR) spectroscopy indicated that the number, strength and strength distribution of the surface acid sites were affected by the preparative mode and the support. The same Lewis and Brønsted acid sites were detected for all impregnated and ALD catalysts, but those prepared in the gas phase showed slightly stronger acidic characteristics. In propane dehydrogenation (DH), the rate of propene formation by the ALD catalysts was higher than that achieved by the conventionally impregnated catalysts.
1. Introduction
Supported vanadium oxide catalysts have been widely studied e.g. in dehydrogenation (DH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes [1], [2], [3], [4], in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of nitrogen oxides by ammonia [5], [6], [7] and in synthesis of formaldehyde or phthalic anhydride [8]. Depending on the specific oxide support (e.g. SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2, MgO) vanadia catalysts may show different catalytic activity and selectivity. The surface structure and dispersion of the active phase together with its redox and acid–base properties are influenced by the vanadium oxide–support interaction [9], [10], [11]. Apart from the role of the support, the importance of the preparative method on the final catalyst behavior and uniformity of the vanadia species has been discussed in the literature [12], [13], [14].
Supported vanadium oxide catalysts are conventionally prepared in liquid phase by impregnation of the support with aqueous ammonium metavanadate [4], [11], [15], [16], [17] or vanadium oxalate [1], [8], [18] solutions. Grafting in non-aqueous solutions viz. methanol or toluene by extraction of the active species by interaction with the surface hydroxyl groups of the support [9] has been employed mainly with vanadium alkoxides, in particular with vanadyl triethoxide (VO(OEt)3), vanadyl triisopropoxide (VO(OPri)3) or vanadyl triisobutoxide VO(OBui)3, respectively, [8], [18], [19] or with vanadyl acetylacetonate VO(acac)2 and vanadium acetylacetonate V(acac)3 [13], [20], [21] (acac=C5H7O2−).
In the preparation of heterogeneous catalysts, gas phase techniques have gained interest in the recent years as a route of developing new catalysts [14], [22], [23]. In general, liquid phase deposition can be regulated by controlled reagent concentration and washing and drying procedures whereas in the gas phase, the key factors are the character of precursor, the reaction temperature and the number of active surface hydroxyl sites [12], [13], [23]. In addition to the possible increased homogeneity in the composition of the active phase, other advantages of gas phase deposition include the absence of solvents, diminished number of work stages and enhanced reactivity of the less reactive precursor complexes [13], [23].
The gas phase deposition techniques, for example those under the category of grafting [9], [24] or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [14], [25], [26] have also been used in the preparation of highly dispersed vanadium oxides. Thus, Baiker and coworkers have grafted vanadia on different supports, e.g. on TiO2 [7], [24], [27], SiO2 [7] and TiO2–SiO2 [7] by both liquid and gas phase methods with vanadyl triisopropoxide VO(OPri)3. Bond and Tahir [9] reported that vanadia/titania catalysts synthesized by grafting the VOCl3 precursor in the gas phase presented superior catalytic properties. Dias et al. [8] have prepared V2O5/TiO2 catalysts by impregnation with an aqueous solution of NH4VO3 and by grafting with VO(OBui)3 for partial oxidation of o-xylene. The catalysts prepared by grafting and resulting in only a monolayer of VOx have shown higher selectivity in phthalic anhydride production [8].
Inumaru et al. [14], [26] have studied thin vanadia layers deposited on SiO2 and Al2O3 by CVD of vanadyl triethoxide VO(OEt)3. The catalytic activity of a 19.4 wt.% V2O5/SiO2 catalyst in ODH of ethanol was three–four times higher than that of an impregnated catalyst. This superior catalytic performance was attributed to high VOx dispersion and surface area of the catalyst. In contrast, when supported on Al2O3 the vanadium oxide layer was well-dispersed regardless of the mode of preparation. Thereby, the catalytic activity of VOx/Al2O3 (CVD) for the acetaldehyde formation was in same order of magnitude as in the case of VOx/Al2O3 (impregnated) [14]. Termath et al. [25] have shown that a gas phase preparation of vanadia catalysts in a fluidized-bed reactor starting from the V(acac)3 precursor led to a well-dispersed vanadium oxide phase containing 0.9–13.6 wt.% V2O5 on both silica and alumina [25]. Vanadium acetylacetonate V(acac)3 was found to sublimate with only a minor decomposition in the gas phase [28] and to adsorb on silica surface at 400 K by releasing one acetylacetonate ligand as revealed by in situ drift spectroscopy connected to a MS apparatus [25]. Weakly adsorbed surface compounds like acetylacetone, acetone and acetic acid were detected along with the solid VO(acac)2. However, due to the weaker stability of this acetylacetonate precursor it was completely decomposed on Lewis acidic Al2O3 surface. The adsorbed compounds were totally transformed into vanadium oxide in air at 570 K on silica and at 773 K on alumina. The dispersion of the active phase after the first deposition cycle (0.9 wt.% V2O5) was 42 and 54% on silica and alumina, respectively [25].
Van der Voort and coworkers have prepared recently silica- [13], [20], [21], alumina- [13], [20] and MCM-48-supported [29] vanadium oxide catalysts starting from vanadium acetylacetonate V(acac)3 and vanadyl acetylacetonate VO(acac)2 by a process called “molecular designed dispersion” (MDD). Modification of SiO2 and Al2O3 supports with VO(acac)2 in a liquid and a gas phase followed by thermal decomposition in air lead to supported vanadium catalysts which were both uniform and highly dispersed as shown e.g. by UV–VIS–DRS and FT-Raman and FTIR measurements [13], [20], [21]. The more stable acetylacetonate precursor VO(acac)2 reacted selectively with the surface hydroxyl groups of the oxide support by both ligand exchange and hydrogen bond interactions [13], [20], [21] to form, upon calcination, tetracoordinated VOx species. The authors [13] concluded that in addition to the nature of the support, deposition conditions had a profound influence on the final dispersion, surface structure and activity of the catalyst in agreement with the results of Nickl et al. [24].
The present study describes a gas phase technique, atomic layer deposition (ALD) in the preparation of supported vanadium oxide catalysts from a volatile vanadyl acetylacetonate precursor. ALD (or atomic layer epitaxy, ALE), as applied to thin film processing [30] and modification of porous surfaces [12], [22], [23] can be categorized as a special form of CVD [23], [30]. The functional principle of ALD technique relies on systematic use of surface saturation through self-controlled chemisorption of the volatilized metal precursors on surface sites of the support [12], [30]. Controlled reaction conditions are achieved by stabilizing the surface adsorption sites on the support by heat treatment and by removing any physisorbed or unreacted molecules after each reaction by inert gas purge [23]. The growth rate of the surface layer is, within the so-called ALD temperature window [30], highly reproducible and not so dependent on the deposition parameters, e.g. the reaction temperature, vapor pressure and concentration of the precursors [22]. An ideal ALD process is thus providing “adsorption control” in heterogeneous catalyst preparation [12]. The theory of ALD/ALE and its application to the catalyst preparation have been described in detail in the literature [12], [22], [23], [30].
In order to illustrate the influence of the preparative method, e.g. on surface structures and dispersion, as well as on redox behavior and acidic and catalytic properties, a series of supported vanadia catalysts was also prepared by conventional incipient wetness impregnation with a solution of ammonium metavanadate NH4VO3. In addition to a comparison of the two different catalyst preparative methods, the work also emphasizes the importance of the nature of specific oxide support (Al2O3, SiO2). The catalysts were throughout characterized by chemical analysis, BET surface area measurements and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The oxidation state and dispersion of vanadium were evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The
solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (
NMR) was used to identify the coordination of the main vanadium species. The degree and temperature of reduction of the active species in correlation with their dispersion were determined by temperature programmed reduction (TPR) in argon-diluted dihydrogen gas flow. The number, strength and strength distribution of the surface acidic sites were examined by ammonia adsorption microcalorimetry and the nature of the acidic sites by infrared (IR) spectroscopy after pyridine adsorption. The activity of the catalysts was studied in propane DH to propene.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
2.1.1. Preparation by ALD
The deposition of vanadia was effected by the reaction of a vaporized vanadium precursor with the surface hydroxyl groups of the support. The non-porous supports SiO2 (Aerosil 200, purity >99.8%, primary particle size 12 nm, Al2O3 <500 ppm, TiO2 <300 ppm, HCl <250 ppm) and γ-Al2O3 (Oxid C, purity >97%, primary particle size 20 nm, Fe2O3 <2000 ppm, TiO2 <1000 ppm, SiO2 <1000 ppm, HCl <5000 ppm) from Degussa were pretreated in air for 16 h at 523 K in a muffle furnace. Approximately 1–2 g of the support was transferred into a fixed-bed flow-type ALD reactor [22] (F-120, ASM Microchemistry Ltd.) where the preheating treatment continued for 5 h at 523 K in nitrogen flow. The pressure of the reactor was kept in low vacuum (1–3 kPa). The solid precursor, vanadyl acetylacetonate VO(C5H7O2)2, was synthesized by the method of Rowe and Jones [31] and purified by sublimation (408 K, 10 Pa). The VO(acac)2-support reaction was carried out by transporting the precursor (volatilized at 433–453 K) in a nitrogen flow (3 l/h) downward through the bed of silica or alumina at 433–463 K. The minimum precursor amount used per gram of support (gsup) was around 1.9 mmol confirming the saturation of the support surface [12]. The reaction was followed by a nitrogen purge for 2 h at 453 K. In order to remove the ligand residues in the samples, a heat treatment was carried out in synthetic air at 623 K for 6 h followed by an oxygen purge for 10 h during the cooling period of the reactor.
2.1.2. Preparation by impregnation
The supports, SiO2 and Al2O3, were impregnated to incipient wetness with aqueous solutions of ammonium metavanadate NH4VO3 (Strem Chemicals, 99%). After drying for 16 h at 383 K, the solids were calcined under air flow at 773 K for 12 h.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
2.2.1. Chemical analysis and N2 adsorption
The vanadium concentration of the samples was determined by ICP atomic emission spectroscopy in a Spectroflame-ICP instrument. The carbon content of the ALD catalysts was measured by total combustion in oxygen followed by an acidimetric coulometry measurement. The specific surface area of the catalysts was calculated by the BET method of nitrogen adsorption at 77 K after heat pretreatment under vacuum for 4 h at 673 K.
2.2.2. X-ray diffraction
The XRD measurements were carried out in a Bruker D5005 diffractometer between 3 and 80° (2θ) at 50 kV and 35 mA, using Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.015418 nm).
2.2.3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
The XPS data were collected in a VG Escalab 200R instrument (11 kV, 20 mA) applying non monochromatic Mg Kα radiation source (1253.6 eV). The pass energy and the spot size were 50 eV and 1 mm2, respectively. The calibration of the spectrometer energy scale was performed using Ag 3d5/2 signal at 368.20 eV (FWHM=0.6 eV). The C 1s, Si 2p and Al 2p lines were used as internal standards for correction of binding energies. The relative atomic concentrations were calculated from the normalized peak areas using the sensitivity factors provided by the instrument manufacturer.
2.2.4. Electron paramagnetic resonance
EPR spectra were recorded with a Varian E9 101 spectrometer equipped with a dual cavity using the 9.4 GHz (X band of Klystron E 101 Microwave Bridge) microwave frequency. The g-values were measured by comparison with a diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical (g=2.0036, H=3314 G). The modulation frequency and amplitude were 100 kHz and 2 G, respectively. Samples of about 20 mg were placed in a quartz microcell (25 cm height, 4 mm diameter) and analyzed without pretreatment at 77 K. Vanadyl sulfate VOSO4·5H2O was used as a secondary reference in order to determine the V4+ concentration in the samples. The amounts of V4+ present were calculated by double integration of the EPR signal.
2.2.5.
NMR spectroscopy
Solid state
NMR spectra were recorded at ambient conditions with a Bruker DSX400 (9.4 T) NMR spectrometer operating at 105.2 MHz under static conditions. The number of scans for vanadium was 27,600. The
chemical shifts were calibrated against liquid VOCl3, using a 0.16 M NaVO3 aqueous solution (chemical shift at −574.3 ppm) as a secondary reference.
2.2.6. Temperature programmed reduction
H2-TPR measurements were carried out in a continuous mode using a U-type quartz microreactor (16 mm diameter). Samples of about 100 mg were first calcined in situ for 1 h at 723 K (1 K/min) in flowing air. After cooling, the samples were subsequently contacted with an H2:Ar mixture (H2:Ar volume ratio of 1% and a total flow of 1.3 l/h) and heated, at a rate of 5 K/min, to a final temperature of 1093 K. The hydrogen consumption was monitored using a TCD of type Delsi Nermag (DN) 11.
2.2.7. Adsorption infrared spectroscopy
The pyridine adsorption IR spectra were recorded with a Bruker Vector 22 FTIR spectrophotometer (DTGS detector). The range, resolution and acquisition applied were 4000–1000 and 2 cm−1 and 100 scans, respectively. The self-supporting disk (10–30 mg, 18 mm diameter) was first activated in a in situ IR cell at 673 K in oxygen flow for 16 h, then evacuated at the same temperature for 45 min and finally exposed to pyridine (Air Liquide, >99.9%, vapor pressure 3.3 kPa) at 298 K. The desorption was effected for 30 min at room temperature and then at 353, 423, 473 and 523 K for the silica-supported samples and at 353, 423, 473, 523, 573, 623 and 673 K for the alumina-based ones. The spectra were recorded at room temperature after adsorption and desorption at each temperature.
2.2.8. Adsorption microcalorimetry
The microcalorimetric studies of ammonia adsorption were performed at 353 K in a heat flow calorimeter (C80 from Setaram) linked to a conventional volumetric apparatus and equipped with a Barocel capacitance manometer for pressure measurements. Ammonia used for measurements (Air Liquide, purity>99.9%) was purified by successive freeze–pump–thaw cycles. About 100 mg of sample was pretreated in a quartz cell by heating overnight under air flow at 673 K and subsequently evacuating during 2 h at the same temperature. The differential heats of adsorption were measured as a function of coverage by repeatedly sending small doses of ammonia gas onto the catalyst until an equilibrium pressure of about 66 Pa was reached [32]. The sample was then outgassed for 30 min at the same temperature and a second adsorption was performed at 353 K until an equilibrium pressure of about 27 Pa was attained in order to calculate the irreversibly chemisorbed amount at this pressure.
2.3. Catalytic test of propane dehydrogenation
The catalytic tests were performed at atmospheric pressure in a tubular quartz flow microreactor (16 mm diameter) using a catalyst charge of 0.5 g, without dilution, supported by quartz wool. The samples were pretreated by heating at 673 K in air flow overnight and then flushed with nitrogen for 30 min. The gas mixture was C3H8:N2=1:4 with flow rates of 0.5 and 2.0 l/h, respectively. Activity was tested in consecutive DH runs after each 20 K interval in the 673–873 K range. Between two successive runs, the sample was reoxidized with air flow for 15 min. The concentrations of reaction products were analyzed on-line using a FID chromatographic system with a packed column (Intersmat IGC 120 FB). At temperature of 773 K or lower, no cokage or side C1–C3 hydrocarbons were detected. The amount of carbon oxides formed during the reaction was quite negligible as the reaction was carried out at very low propane conversion and in the absence of oxygen flow.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst preparation by ALD
One of the essential prerequisite for a satisfactory ALD precursor is its volatility with a vapor pressure over 100 Pa without gas phase decomposition at the reaction temperature [12], [22]. The sublimation properties of the self-synthesized and sublimation-purified vanadium acetylacetonate precursor were tested by thermogravimetry under conditions (1 kPa, nitrogen flow 6 l/h, heating rate 5 K/min) close to those occurring in the ALD reactor. The precursor was found to start subliming at around 393–423 K, but at a very low rate. Faster vaporization began only at around 453 and 473 K and it led to a complete sublimation.
In the growth experiments at temperatures exceeding 453 K in the ALD reactor (1–3 kPa) the precursor evaporated and partly decomposed in the gas phase or at the latest when binding on the catalyst bed. However, it was possible to carry out a controlled chemisorption of the VO(acac)2 precursor onto the supports at 453 K. The binding was successful and surface-controlled (i.e. so called ALD growth) as the deposition resulted in practically equal vanadium contents at the top and bottom parts of the support bed, viz. 1.75±0.25 and
on silica and alumina surfaces, respectively [12], [22], [33]. When the reaction temperature was 453 K, the temperature for the precursor sublimation could be adjusted upto a maximum of 443 K in order to still have a small temperature gradient along the reactor [12]. Consequently, due to the slow vaporization rate of the precursor at the operating pressure and the temperature of 443 K, a long saturation period of 10 h was needed. At this reaction temperature the carbon content of the catalytic bed was negligible (<0.30 wt.% C) confirming the absence of the organic precursor residue originating from excess precursor decomposition on the support bed.
Van Der Voort and coworkers [13], [20], [21] have investigated the reaction mechanism of the VO(acac)2 complex adsorption on silica and alumina at different reaction temperatures. As the vanadium amount bound onto silica surface is higher on silicas heat-pretreated at lower temperatures, the VO(acac)2 precursor has been assumed to react selectively with the surface OH groups. When the reaction temperature decreased from 453 to 393 K, the acac:V ratio increased from 1.2 to 1.6. This suggests that the reaction mechanism changes from mainly ligand-exchange at 453 K, i.e. from formation of a covalent VOSi bond with a loss of an acetylacetone ligand, to mainly hydrogen bonding at 393 K. The VOx groups are formed and carbon oxides and acetone are released upon calcination of the surface SiOVO(acac) species [13]. The liquid or gas phase reaction of VO(acac)2 with the hydroxyl groups and to a lesser extent with the coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ species of alumina proceeds also by ligand-exchange and hydrogen bond interactions [13], [20].
3.2. Oxidation state, coordination and dispersion of the catalysts
The physicochemical properties of the supports and vanadium oxide catalysts are listed in Table 1, which gives the vanadium content, the BET specific surface area and the results from the XPS and
NMR measurements. The samples are labeled I-VM or A-VM, where A and I correspond to the preparative method applied (ALD or impregnation), V to vanadium and M to the support element (M=Si, Al).

The surface densities are calculated in number of vanadium atoms per square nanometer of catalyst (Vat/nmcat2) to facilitate a comparison of the samples prepared on different surface area supports [1]. The vanadium contents of the samples are near the theoretical monovanadate monolayer coverage of 2.3 VOx/nm2 [1], [34]. For comparison, the theoretical density for polyvanadate layer is reported to be 7.5 VOx/nm2 [34].
The presence of vanadium oxide had only a minor effect on the specific surface area of the support. We can notice that the decrease of the BET values in the case of silica-supported catalysts was slightly greater for the impregnated sample I-VSi. The absence of XRD peaks corresponding to bulk V2O5 for all the catalysts studied indicates that the low percentage of vanadium oxide is highly dispersed on the amorphous supports. However, by considering the detection limit of the XRD technique (d>5 nm), the presence of very small crystal particles in the catalysts cannot be excluded. In general, no crystallites have been detected by XRD by other authors as well for the impregnated V2O5/SiO2 or V2O5/Al2O3 catalysts with <8.2–10 wt.% V2O5, respectively [1], [17].
The possible presence of V4+ cations (configuration of 3d1, I=7/2) in the non-treated supported vanadium oxide catalysts was detected by EPR technique at 77 K. The spectra showed that the vanadium is mostly in the V5+ oxidation state in the catalysts and it was only in the silica-supported ALD sample that a small amount of V4+ (some percentages) was observed. The well-resolved hyperfine allure of the ESR spectrum of the sample indicated a good dispersion of the VOx phase at a low vanadium coverage [15].
The relative coverage of supports as well as information about the oxidation state of vanadium in the catalysts have been obtained by XPS. The surface atomic ratios V 2p3/2:M 2p (M=Si, Al) were taken as a measurement of the relative dispersion of vanadium on the supports and they are given together with the corresponding binding energies in Table 1. From the slightly lower BE values of V 2p3/2 around 516.7 eV for silica-supported samples one could assume the presence of minor amounts of V4+ in these samples as detected also by ESR measurements for the ALD sample. In the alumina-supported catalysts vanadium was predominantly in the pentavalent oxidation state, BE value being around 517.4 eV. For the catalyst containing 6–13 wt.% V2O5 supported on titania, silica and alumina, binding energies of ∼517.0, 516.8–517.4 and 517.1 eV, respectively, have been generally observed [8], [33], [35], [36]. The binding energy of V 2p3/2 for bulk V2O5 is shown to be shifted between 516.7 and 517.6 eV as reported in the literature [3], [36]. In general, the surface V:M atomic ratio was higher for the alumina-supported samples than for the silica-supported analogues (Table 1). However, the atomic ratios for the ALD samples, when correlated with the vanadium content, were always higher than for the corresponding impregnated samples, which confirms higher vanadium oxide species dispersion in these ALD catalysts.
Table 1 shows the wide-line
NMR chemical shift maxima for the ALD and impregnated samples, obtained under ambient conditions. In the literature, the signals observed for supported vanadium oxide catalysts at approximately −310 ppm have been assigned to octahedral (distorted six-coordinated) bulk-like vanadia or to polymeric surface vanadia species when a signal due to tetracoordinated vanadia arises at approximately −500–600 ppm [17], [37], [38].
Koranne et al. [17] have shown that the V2O5/Al2O3 catalysts prepared by the conventional wet impregnation technique contained mainly tetracoordinated surface species at a low vanadium oxide coverage (∼5 wt.%), while an octacoordinated vanadia appeared only at higher loading (∼9 wt.% V2O5). The chemical shift maximum was detected at around −630 ppm for the 4.8 wt.% V2O5/Al2O3 sample [17]. The state and degree of hydration did not seem to affect the coordination of vanadium at low vanadia coverage on alumina, as examined by Eckert and Wachs [38]. However, in V2O5/SiO2 catalysts, the tetracoordinated vanadium has a tendency to turn octahedrally coordinated in ambient conditions even at low vanadia coverage [38]. In the literature, a VO4 peak centered at around −625 ppm for the 1.6 wt.% vanadia on silica shifted to lower values (−580 ppm for 4.0 and 8.2 wt.% V2O5/SiO2) and finally disappeared in favor of the strengthening octahedral signal at −300 ppm when vanadia content increased to 25 wt.% [17]. Microcrystalline octahedric vanadia species were detected even at very low loading [17].
In the present work, a typical spectrum of highly dispersed alumina-supported catalysts showed a anisotropically enlarged very broad signal with a main chemical shift maximum centered between −530 and −620 ppm (Table 1). However, the V2O5/SiO2 catalysts showed in ambient conditions poorly resolved signals with maxima both at around −550, −630 and −300 ppm. The results are in agreement with those of the literature and indicate the presence of mainly tetracoordinated surface vanadia species in the alumina-supported catalysts and both tetra- and, to a lesser extent and upon hydration, octacoordinated vanadia species e.g. possible microcrystallites not detectable by XRD in the silica-supported catalysts [17], [38].
3.3. Reducibility of the catalysts
The influence of the support and preparative method on the reduction behavior of the catalysts was examined by H2-TPR. Normalized TPR spectra of the vanadium oxide catalysts and the supports are presented by the H2 consumption (a.u.) as a function of the temperature in Fig. 1. The reduction temperature maximum (TM) and the consumption of dihydrogen (mol/mcat2, normalized to the same vanadium content of
) in the reduction range together with the average oxidation state (AOS) of vanadium after reduction are presented in Table 2.

In our TPR measurements using a diluted mixture of dihydrogen (1% H2:Ar) as reducing agent, only one peak of reduction at TM temperature was obtained for all the catalysts. For the SiO2 and Al2O3 supports, no reduction was observed in the experimentally covered temperature range. For the ALD samples A-VSi and A-VAl, the TM values of 890 and 799 K, respectively, were 30–40 K lower than those observed for the impregnated catalysts (Fig. 1). This indicates that the reducibility of the ALD catalysts is higher. However, for the impregnated catalysts the H2 consumption (mol/mcat2) and the AOS of vanadium after reduction were slightly higher and lower, respectively (Table 2). A stoichiometric reduction of pentavalent vanadium species to V4.2+ in A-VAl and to V3.9+ in I-VAl occurred. For silica-supported samples, the reduction of V5+ to V3.6+ and to V3.3+ was observed for the A-VS and I-VS samples, respectively. The allure of the peak of reduction was clearly broader for the alumina-supported samples and slightly broader for the impregnated catalysts.
It can be concluded from the results that regardless of the nature of the support, the vanadium species are more easily (TM lower) but slightly less strongly (AOS higher) reduced in the ALD catalyst as compared to the impregnated ones. The reducibility scale V2O5/Al2O3>V2O5/SiO2 and the exact positions of the reduction peaks are, while taking into account the differences in the experimental conditions, in agreement with those reported in the literature [10], [11], [17]. The reduction degrees of the samples are identical with those observed by Koranne et al. [17] for the same type of catalysts. In their studies the vanadium in the impregnated 4.0 wt.% V2O5/SiO2 and 4.8 wt.% V2O5/Al2O3 catalysts was found to reduce to an AOS of 3.2 and 3.8, respectively. The higher extent of reduction of silica-supported vanadia than that of alumina-supported vanadia has been proposed to be due to the differences in the structure of vanadia species and in the host–guest oxide interaction. The presence of bulk-like vanadia in a SiO2-supported catalyst was found to result in a equivalent extent of reduction (70%) with the bulk V2O5 [17].
Characterization of the supported vanadia catalysts by the TPR technique could point out the differences in the dispersion of the active phase. A direct connection between the reduction behavior and dispersion of the supported vanadium oxide catalysts has been demonstrated in the literature [11], [15], [17]. This affirmation allows us to conclude that the catalysts prepared in gas phase by the ALD method are better dispersed than those prepared by conventional impregnation. This was also confirmed by the XPS measurements. It is supposed generally that at lower temperature, the surface species (probably the tetracoordinated species) would be reduced, whereas at higher temperature the more polymeric or bulk-like vanadium oxide would be reduced [17]. In this H2-TPR study it was not possible to distinguish the different VOx surface species possibly present because only one reduction peak was observed for all the catalysts [10], [11], [17]. However, the elevated reduction temperature of I-VSi could indicate the presence of bulk-like V2O5 microcrystallites, which were also revealed by the solid state
NMR measurements.
3.4. Acidic properties of the catalysts
Bulk V2O5 possesses both surface Lewis and Brønsted acidity, whereas in dehydrated conditions no Lewis acid sites are present on SiO2 surface, while only Lewis acid sites are present on Al2O3 surface [10], [39]. Coating the bare support with a vanadium oxide layer creates new Brønsted acid sites at higher loadings and affects the number of Lewis acid sites [10], [39]. The basicity of the supported vanadium oxide species is negligible [10], [40].
Pyridine adsorption IR spectroscopy was used to differentiate between the different surface acid site types in the catalysts. IR spectroscopy of pyridine adsorption on supported vanadium oxide surfaces has been examined throughly in the literature [16], [18], [41]. In the present study, the same adsorption bands characteristic of pyridine on Lewis and Brønsted acid sites were observed for all the catalysts and no significant shift in the peak frequency position was observed as a function of the preparative method or the support. Fig. 2, Fig. 3 present the normalized IR spectra of pyridine adsorption on alumina- and silica-supported vanadia catalysts, respectively, after desorption at 298 and 353 K. At 523 K the pyridine adsorption bands were no more detectable on silica-supported samples whereas the same bands for alumina-supported samples were still intense even after desorption at a temperature higher than 673 K.

The bands at 1610, 1576, 1490 and 1446 cm−1 have been assigned to the vibrational modes of Lewis site coordinated pyridine (LPy) 8a, 8b, 19a and 19b, respectively [41], [42]. Similarly, the bands at 1640 cm−1 (ν8a), 1576 cm−1 (ν8b), 1490 cm−1 (ν19a) and 1538 cm−1 (ν19b), correspond to a pyridinium ion bonded to a Brønsted site (BPy). The bands around 1490 cm−1 (ν19a) and 1576 cm−1 (ν8b) are associated at the same time to both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites (Fig. 2, Fig. 3). In addition to these peaks, at a desorption temperature of 298 K, the IR spectra of the catalysts show also a peak at 1596 cm−1 corresponding to physisorbed pyridine [41], [42].
Two Lewis and Brønsted acid sites peaks at ∼1450 and 1540 cm−1, respectively, were used to compare the acidity, i.e. the acid site number and strength of the different catalysts. The absolute concentration of surface acid sites is affected by a ∼10% error, as estimated in the literature [6], [42]. However, reliable and valuable information can be obtained on a relative scale, when comparing the acidity in a series of catalysts [42].
A quantitative comparison of the acid sites number of the samples was made by calculating the area under the LPy and BPy peaks (after desorption at 353 K) [6], [42]. The ratio of the absorption coefficients of the 19b LPy band to that of BPy, calculated from the integrated intensities for 3–5 wt.% V2O5/TiO2 samples, has been estimated in the literature to be between 1.07 and 1.24 [16], [41]. In this study, a mean absorption coefficient ratio of Lpy-to-BPy of 1.16 was applied. In order to study the acid sites strength, the A353:A298 ratios, where A298 and A353 are the areas of LPy band after desorption at 298 and 353 K, respectively, were determined. The A353:A298 ratios of the BPy peak at 1540 cm−1 were not calculated due to the low intensity of the peaks [39]. The LPy A353:A298 ratios and the peak area per unit surface area of the catalysts are presented in Fig. 4.

The addition of vanadium oxide onto non-acidic silica support created both Lewis and, to a lesser extent, some Brønsted acidity. The normalized areas of the LPy and BPy absorption peaks measured after desorption at 353 K, are slightly higher for the A-VSi sample than for the I-VSi sample (Fig. 4). The Lewis acid site number per meter square catalyst of the A-VAl sample is greater than that of the I-VAl sample, but the Brønsted acid site numbers of the catalysts are low. The strength of acid sites described by the A353:A298 ratio for the LPy 1450 cm−1 peak follows the trend: A-VAl>I-VAl>A-VSi∼I-VSi.
These results indicate that especially the Lewis acid site strength of the ALD catalysts is higher compared to the impregnated samples. Miyata et al. [16] have also reported that a gas phase prepared 4.8 wt.% V2O5/TiO2 catalyst showed an increased number of both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, compared to a corresponding catalyst prepared in solution.
Ammonia adsorption microcalorimetry was used as a complementary technique to determine the number, strength and strength distribution of the surface acid sites of the catalysts [32]. The results of the microcalorimetric measurements are published elsewhere [43], but are applied here to complete the FTIR acidity examinations and to correlate the relative acidity with the catalytic activity. Fig. 5, Fig. 6 present the initial heats of adsorption (Qinit, kJ/mol) and irreversibly adsorbed volumes (Virr) of ammonia (μmol NH3/mcat2), determined under an equilibrium pressure of 27 Pa.

The initial heat of ammonia adsorption (Qinit,) of the catalysts decreased from ∼200 to 100 kJ/mol in the order of A-VAl>Al2O3>I-VAl>A-VSi>I-VSi whereas Qinit of the non-acidic SiO2 support was 30 kJ/mol only (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). The irreversibly adsorbed amount of NH3, which evaluates the number of strong chemisorption sites, increased from 0.07 μmol/m2 for SiO2 to 0.14 and 0.20 μmol/m2 for I-VSi and A-VSi, respectively. For alumina-supported samples the order was Al2O3 (1.48 μmol/m2)>A-VAl (1.23 μmol/m2)>I-VAl (1.17 μmol/m2). In general, the ammonia uptakes, normalized to the vanadium content and obtained from the adsorption isotherms at a pressure of 27 Pa, were approximately 30% greater for the ALD catalyst than for the impregnated analogues [43].
The acidic site strength distributions are presented in Table 3 (kJ/mol). An increasing number of especially weak and medium strength acidic sites (60<Q<120 kJ/mol) was observed for the silica-supported ALD catalyst. For the alumina-supported samples, the number of very strong acid sites (Q>150 kJ/mol) decreased in the order Al2O3>A-VAl>I-VAl. However, the sequence for the medium strength acidic sites (120<Q<150 kJ/mol) was A-VAl>I-VAl>Al2O3. The number of weak strength acid sites varied only slightly (Table 3).

The results are in agreement with the FTIR spectra of pyridine adsorption showing that the acidic properties were affected on one hand by the support and on other hand by the preparative mode and dispersion. The number and strength of the surface acid sites formed increased considerably when vanadia was deposited by ALD instead of impregnation. A slightly higher Qinit of A-VAl could indicate a stronger Lewis acidity of the catalyst, as also evidenced by FTIR. Le Bars et al. [44] have showed previously that the grafted silica-supported vanadium oxide catalysts presented, at similar vanadium concentrations, slightly higher values of integral enthalpies and overall chemisorbed volumes of ammonia adsorption than the samples prepared by wet impregnation.
3.5. Catalytic activity of the catalysts
The activity of catalysts was tested in the reaction of propane DH in propene at 773 K. The rates of propene formation Rpropene (μmol/h mcat2) are presented in Table 4 and in Fig. 5, Fig. 6 together with calorimetric data such as initial heats of adsorption (kJ/mol) and irreversibly adsorbed amounts of ammonia (μmol/mcat2).

I-VAl 5.36
A-VAl 9.66

I-VSi 8.84
A-VSi 14.63
The physicochemical characterization results of the catalysts indicated that the structure of the surface vanadia species was independent of the preparative method. However, a fairly strong difference was observed between the catalytic activities of impregnated and ALD samples. The activity (expressed in μmol of
) was enhanced notably on the ALD catalysts, decreasing in the order A-VSi>A-VAl>I-VSi>I-VAl (Table 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). The activity of Al2O3 was 2 orders of magnitude lower than that of I-VAl, whereas the activity of SiO2 was negligible. For a given support, the activity of the most acidic sample was always the highest as shown by initial heats of adsorption (kJ/mol) and irreversibly adsorbed amounts of ammonia (μmol/mcat2) in Fig. 5, Fig. 6. It can be assumed from these results that the specificity of the support had the greatest influence on the catalytic activity of the vanadia catalysts and that the dispersion of the active phase and the acidic character of the samples had only a secondary effect on the activity in propane DH. The correlation of the dispersion/acidity properties with the activity was only valid for the catalysts supported on a particular support.
4. Conclusion
A controlled deposition of vanadium oxide layers on silica and alumina supports was successful at a precursor reaction temperature of 453 K. The growth took place within so-called ALD temperature window [30], which was for the β-diketonate precursor vanadyl acetylacetonate very narrow, however.
A fairly strong influence of the preparative methods employed, i.e. impregnation or gas phase deposition, and the nature of the support on the redox and acidic properties as well as on the reactivity of the vanadium oxide catalysts was confirmed. Tetracoordinated surface vanadia species were detected as the main vanadium species in all the catalysts studied, independently of the catalyst preparative method or the support oxide. However, the ALD catalysts were found to be better dispersed and more easily reduced, as compared to the impregnated catalyst. The reducibility scale of the catalysts was I-VSi<A-VSi<I-VAl<A-VAl. The number, strength and strength distribution of the surface acid sites were affected by the catalyst preparation and the support. The same Lewis and Brønsted acid site FTIR bands were detected for all the impregnated and ALD catalysts, but those prepared in gas phase showed stronger acidic characteristics. The superior rate of propene formation in propane DH when using the ALD catalysts as compared to that obtained with the impregnated samples may be due, however solely for a particular support, to the higher dispersion and easier reducibility of the gas phase deposited vanadium oxide layer.
