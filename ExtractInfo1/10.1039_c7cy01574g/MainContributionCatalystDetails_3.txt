The document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). It focuses on the selective oxidation of propene to acrolein over FeMoTeO catalysts. While propene can be produced from propane dehydrogenation, this document specifically examines catalysts for converting propene to acrolein, not propane to propylene.
