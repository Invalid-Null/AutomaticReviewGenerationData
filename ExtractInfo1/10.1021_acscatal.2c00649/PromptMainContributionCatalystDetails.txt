Promoting Propane Dehydrogenation with CO2 over the PtFe Bimetallic Catalyst by Eliminating the Non-selective Fe(0) Phase

Abstract
Fine tuning the structure of bimetallic nanoparticles is critical toward understanding structure–activity relationships and further improving the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Excessive Fe species in the PtFe bimetallic catalysts promote carbon deposition leading to low propylene selectivity, and it remains challenging to synthesize well-defined PtFe catalysts while selectively eliminating the excessive Fe. Herein, we show that the formation of coke can be significantly inhibited by introducing CO2 into the PDH over PtFe catalysts, where CO2 effectively eliminates the active Fe(0) coking sites without changing the catalytic surface structure of the PtFe alloy. With a CO2/C3H8 feeding ratio of 0.20, the Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalyst shows the highest propylene production rate and decreased amount of coke from 18.8 to 1.0 wt % compared with dehydrogenation without CO2. X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and 57Fe Mössbauer results indicate that it is the oxidation of excessive unalloyed Fe species during the CO2-PDH reaction, instead of the reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C = 2CO), that significantly inhibits the carbon deposition. This work provides a promising strategy for tuning the structure of PtFe bimetallic catalysts under reaction conditions and improving the performance of the PDH reaction.

Propylene is an important feedstock for the production of value-added chemicals such as polypropylene and propylene oxide, and its global demand is increasing with an annual growth rate of ∼5%. (1−5) Among several propylene production technologies, catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has attracted much attention due to its unique advantages of cleanness, high efficiency, and high atomic utilization. (6−8) Generally, the commercially available PDH catalysts can be divided into metal oxides, such as CrOx, (9−12) and noble metal Pt-based catalysts. (13−16) With the low toxicity and high activity, further development of new efficient Pt-based PDH catalysts is a vital direction while full of challenges.
It is well known that the addition of promoters into Pt catalysts can significantly improve the PDH performance. Various 3d transition metals and main group metals, such as Cr, (17) Mn, (18,19) Fe, (20) Co, (21) Cu, (22,23) Zn, (24−26) Ga, (27−29) Sn, (30−32) and so forth, have been studied as promoters, involving various intermetallic compounds (IMCs), single atom alloys (SAAs) and core–shell bimetallic alloys. With the knowledge from in situ characterization and density functional theory calculations, recent evidence has shown that the improved olefin selectivity and rates of Pt-based bimetallic catalysts are usually attributed to the geometric and electronic effects. (33,34) The elimination of large Pt ensembles by alloying effectively inhibits the structure-sensitive side reactions, including hydrogenolysis and carbon deposition. (35,36) From the aspect of the electronic effect, alloying changes the orbital energy of Pt. Normally, the energy of the filled 5d orbitals decreases, while the energy of unfilled 5d orbitals increases upon alloying, which modulates the adsorption/desorption of propylene on the active sites and reduces the possibility of deep dehydrogenation to form coke. (37)
With this understanding toward the structure–performance relationship, challenges still remain in the precise synthesis of the well-defined and uniform catalytically active phase/sites. During the conventional impregnation synthesis of Pt-based IMC and SAA catalysts, an excessive promoter is normally added to obtain the well-defined alloy structure, and the unalloyed promoter can possibly lead to side reactions. For example, when the VIII group elements are used as promoters, the excessive unalloyed Fe, Co, and Ni (often in the form of metallic nanoparticles under dehydrogenation conditions) catalyze the hydrogenolysis and carbon deposition reactions, leading to decreased selectivity and stability. (38−42) Many efforts have been made in order to solve this issue. Escorcia et al. prepared uniform PtIn and PtGa alloy catalysts via the colloidal synthesis method which effectively avoided the excessive In2O3 and Ga2O3, respectively, and laid a foundation for further understanding and optimizing the alloy structure while exploring the structure–activity relationship in dehydrogenation reactions. (43) Cai et al. obtained a core–shell structure of the Pt@PtM catalyst by acid treatment on PtM (M = Fe, Co, and Ni) bimetallic alloys. The Fe, Co, and Ni on the surface of the IMC can be effectively removed after acid treatment, thus effectively suppressing the concurrence of side reactions such as cracking and coking. (38) These promising achievements have shown the potential impact of fine tuning the surface structures on improving the catalytic performance.
Three PtFe alloy phases with different structures were previously obtained by adjusting the nominal ratio of Pt/Fe, and the PtFe catalyst with the higher Fe content showed slightly higher catalytic performance in the PDH reaction. However, large amounts of Fe species are prone to be reduced into Fe(0) nanoparticles at a high Fe content, leading to significant carbon deposition during the PDH reaction. (20) Herein, we report a strategy of optimizing the catalytic structure to improve the PDH performance by introducing a soft oxidant CO2, to transform the unalloyed non-selective Fe(0) phase in PtFe bimetallic catalysts. Based on the understanding of the structural evolution of Fe-based catalysts, metallic Fe species can be oxidized to Fe3O4 in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. (44,45) It is also known that stable FeOx species show a higher olefin selectivity and weaker ability on coking during dehydrogenation of ethane and propane compared with metallic Fe species. (46,47) Therefore, we speculate that the introduction of CO2 to the PDH reaction under certain conditions might be able to selectively transform the excessive unalloyed Fe(0) species under PDH conditions, while maintaining the catalytic surface structure of the PtFe bimetallic alloy, leading to improved catalytic performance (Scheme 1). In the present work, PtFe bimetallic alloy catalysts supported on high-surface area silicalite-1 were prepared. The excessive unalloyed Fe(0) leads to significant carbon deposition in the PDH reaction, while in the CO2-assisted PDH reaction (CO2-PDH), the excessive unalloyed Fe(0) is selectively oxidized to Fe3O4, and the latter of which remains stable under CO2-PDH conditions, thus effectively inhibiting the hydrogenolysis and carbon deposition reaction.

2.1. Synthesis of Silicalite-1
The silicalite-1 support was synthesized via the hydrothermal method, and the molar ratio of the precursors was 1 tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS): 0.27 tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH): 35 H2O. (48) In a typical synthesis procedure, 16.5 g of TEOS, 17.5 g of 25 wt % TPAOH solution, and 31.0 mL of H2O were mixed and stirred for 3 h. The solution was then transferred into a 200 mL Teflon-lined steel autoclave and allowed to crystallize at 170 °C for 3 days. The product was collected by centrifugation, washed, and dried overnight at 100 °C. Finally, the product was calcined in a muffle furnace to remove the template at 540 °C for 6 h in air and denoted S-1.
2.2. Synthesis of the Catalysts
Different amounts of Fe (0.05, 0.14, 0.43, 0.72, and 1.0 wt %) and the fixed amount of Pt (0.5 wt %) were sequentially introduced onto the S-1 support via the charge enhanced dry impregnation method. (49) For the monometallic catalyst of Fe/S-1 (1.0 wt %), 0.18 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 0.094 g of citric acid were dissolved in 2.0 mL of deionized water. Then, the solution was added into 2.5 g of S-1 powder dropwise with continuous stirring. The sample was dried at 80 °C for 2 h, calcined at 400 °C for 4 h in air, and denoted Fe/S-1. For the Pt/S-1 or PtFe/S-1 bimetallic catalysts with various Pt/Fe ratios, 20 mg of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 was dissolved in 1.5 mL of deionized water and 0.15 g of NH4OH solution. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 11, and the solution was impregnated onto 2.0 g of S-1 or Fe/S-1 powder with different Fe contents dropwise with continuous stirring. The sample was dried at 80 °C for 2 h, calcined at 540 °C for 4 h in air, and denoted Pt/S-1 or PtxFey/S-1 (the x/y represents the molar ratio of Pt/Fe, such as Pt3Fe1, Pt1Fe1, Pt1Fe3, Pt1Fe5, and Pt1Fe7), respectively.
2.3. Catalyst Characterization
A Rigaku Smartlab 9kw X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation was used to characterize the crystalline structure for the fresh and spent PtFe/S-1 bimetallic catalysts. Raman spectroscopic characterization was performed at room temperature to investigate the coke of the spent catalysts on a DL-2 microscopic Raman spectrometer with a 532 nm Ar-ion laser beam. The CO-probe diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) spectra were collected on a Thermo Nicolet iS50 spectrometer with a mercury cadmium telluride detector cooled by liquid nitrogen. Prior to the test, the sample was reduced at 550 °C and at an ambient pressure under pure H2 for 1 h. After this, the reduced and CO2-treated Pt1Fe7/S-1 bimetallic samples were cooled to 30 °C in N2 and exposed to 10 vol % of CO (30 mL/min) for 15 min, and then, the spectra were collected after purging the catalyst with N2 for 30 min. In the CO2 oxidation experiment of Pt1Fe7/S-1, 20 vol % of CO2 (30 mL/min) is introduced after H2 reduction and Ar purging at 550 °C, and the signals of H2, H2O, CO, Ar, and CO2 were monitored by using an OMNI Star mass spectrometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed over a spectrometer (Model Max 200, Leybold, Germany) using Al Kα radiation as the excitation source. The 57Fe Mössbauer spectra of the spent catalysts were recorded on a Topologic 500A spectrometer and a proportional counter at room temperature. 57Co (Rh) moving in a constant acceleration mode was used as a radioactive source. The X-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements for spent catalysts were conducted on the bending magnet beamline of the Materials Research Collaborative Access Team at the advanced photon source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory, at the Pt LIII edge (11,564 eV) and the Fe K edge (7112 eV). At the Pt LIII edge, extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) coordination parameters were obtained by least-square fit in the R-space (1.2–3.0 Å) of the k3-weighted Fourier transform data from 3.2 to 14.0 Å–1. An amplitude reduction factor (S02) of 0.78 was obtained by fitting the EXAFS data of a Pt foil and used for fitting the spectra of the Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalyst. Fits were performed by refinement of the coordination numbers (CNs), bond distances (R), Debye–Waller factor (σ2), and energy shift (ΔE0) for both the Pt–Pt and Pt–Fe paths, where the ΔE0 for the two paths was restrained to be the same. The linear combination fit of the normalized X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra at the Fe K edge was done using the spectra of the Fe foil and Fe3O4 as the standards. The data range was from 7090.0 to 7140.0 eV. The specific surface area and pore structure were determined by Ar adsorption–desorption on a Quantachrome AUTOSORB-1-MP sorption analyzer at −186 °C. Prior to the measurements, the samples were degassed at 300 °C for 6 h. The specific surface area of Pt1Fe7/S-1 (438 m2 g–1) was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller model, and the total pore volume (0.50 cm3 g–1) was estimated based on the adsorbed amount at P/P0 = 0.99. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were obtained on an FEI Tecnai F30 instrument, and the ethanol suspension of the sample was dropped on the copper grids prior to imaging. The coke elimination experiment by CO2 was performed on the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalyst after the PDH reaction at 550 °C with 30 mL/min of pure CO2 for 2 h in the fixed-bed reactor. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results were obtained on SDT Q600 apparatus to measure the carbon deposition of the spent catalysts, scanning from 30 to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min in air.
2.4. Catalytic Testing
The catalytic reactions were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor. Typically, 0.15 g of catalyst powder was placed in the isothermal zone of a quartz tube reactor with an inner diameter of 8 mm. Before each test, the catalyst was reduced with pure H2 (30 mL/min) at 550 °C for 1 h and purged with pure N2 (30 mL/min) for 15 min. After this, the reactant gas [C3H8/N2 = 1:7 or CO2/C3H8/N2 = x:1:(7–x)] was then fed into the reactor, and the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was maintained at 16,000 mL·h–1·gcat–1 unless otherwise noted. The dehydrogenation reaction was carried out at 550 °C and under ambient pressure. For the pretreatment of CO2 or CO2 + H2 before the PDH reaction, the reduced PtFe/S-1 was pretreated (CO2/N2 = 1:7 or CO2/H2/N2 = 1:0.5:6.5) for 2 h under similar conditions, followed by the PDH reaction after N2 purging. The products were analyzed by using online gas chromatography integrated with double detectors: the thermal conductivity detector for CO2, N2, CH4, and CO and the flame ionization detector for hydrocarbons, such as CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C3H8, C3H6, C4H10, C4H8, and C4H6, where N2 was used as the internal standard. The conversion of C3H8 (XC3H8) and CO2 (XCO2), the carbon balance of hydrocarbons (BC3H8) and CO2 (BCO2), and the C3H6 selectivity (SC3H6) were calculated via following eqs 1–5 assuming that all the hydrocarbon products (C1–C4) are produced from C3H8, and CO is solely generated from CO2.

3.1. Catalytic Performance
Figures 1 and 2 show the catalytic performance of Fe/S-1 and PtFe/S-1 catalysts, respectively, with various Pt/Fe ratios in the PDH reaction. The catalytic performance with time on stream (TOS) is shown in Figure S1. The monometallic Fe/S-1 catalyst displayed poor initial activity and selectivity with a C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity of 0.8 and 76.5%, respectively. The carbon balance was 97.0% with the formation of 12.9 wt % coke after 200 min on stream. The conversion of C3H8 and the selectivity of C3H6 increased dramatically under the same operating conditions after introducing Pt. On Pt1Fe7/S-1 (adding 0.5 wt % Pt to the Fe/S-1), the conversion of C3H8 increased to 47.1%, while the selectivity of propylene was 65.6% at the initial stage and increased to 90.8% in 60 min. Carbon balance increased from 75.4 to 93.4% with the progress of the reaction. The TGA results on the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1 showed that the amount of carbon deposition was 18.8 wt % after 200 min on stream, which is consistent with the low carbon balance. In addition, the intense signal of coke and the higher ratio of disordered graphite at 1342 cm–1 (ID/IG = 1.1) in the Raman spectra in Figure S2A also confirmed that a large amount of amorphous coke was formed. (31)

PDH: C3H8/N2 = 5/35 mL min–1 and GHSV = 16000 mL·h–1·gcat–1; for the PDH, a high-GHSV experiment to get a similar conversion to the CO2-PDH reaction, 0.06 g of Pt1Fe7/S-1, was used and GHSV = 40,000 mL·h–1·gcat–1. CO2-PDH: CO2/C3H8/N2 = 5/5/30 mL min–1 and GHSV = 16,000 mL·h–1·gcat–1. The amount of coke was determined with TGA on the catalysts after 200 min on stream.

Reaction conditions: T = 550 °C, ambient pressure, 0.15 g of the catalyst, GHSV = 16,000 mL·h–1·gcat–1, and C3H8/N2 = 5/35 mL min–1. The amount of coke was determined with TGA on the spent catalysts after 200 min on stream.
The catalytic performance of PtFe/S-1 catalysts with various Pt/Fe ratios was next evaluated. The propane conversion decreased with increasing TOS for all the PtFe/S-1 catalysts as shown in Figure 2A, among which Pt3Fe1/S-1 with the highest Pt/Fe ratio showed the most significant drop of the catalytic activity. The C3H8 conversion rapidly decreased from 45.0 to 24.0% within 200 min on stream. Pt1Fe5/S-1 and Pt1Fe7/S-1 with a much lower Pt/Fe ratio showed much better stability, and the C3H8 conversion dropped from 47.1 to 38.4% after 200 min on stream. Although the stability increased with the decrease in the Pt/Fe ratio from 3:1 to 1:7, the amount of coke increased from 0.9 to 18.8 wt % as shown in Figure 2B. Therefore, there is not a simple relationship between the amount of coke and the deactivation of the PtFe/S-1 catalysts. It has been reported that PtFe alloys are highly active and selective for PDH, while Fe(0) nanoparticles are not. (20,46,47) Considering the Pt/Fe ratios in the current work, it is reasonable to believe that both PtFe alloy and Fe(0) are present under PDH conditions. As shown in Figure 2C, at the initial stage of the PDH reaction, the carbon balance decreased significantly with decreasing the Pt/Fe ratio, while the carbon balance was around 93% for all the catalysts at the steady state. It is important to note that although the C3H6 selectivity was similar at the steady state, that was obtained at different conversions (Figure 2A), and the C3H6 yield was highest on Pt1Fe7/S-1, as shown in Figures 2D and S3. Decreasing the nominal Fe content can decrease the amount of unalloyed Fe(0) species and the formation of coke at the initial stage but leads to lower stability and propylene yield at the steady state. Therefore, we next focused on studying Pt1Fe7/S-1 with the highest stability.
After introducing CO2 into the PDH reaction (CO2-PDH), the initial conversion of propane and CO2 over Pt1Fe7/S-1 reached 24.5 and 14.0% (Figure S4A), respectively. The selectivity of propylene and the C3H8 carbon balance remained above 94.1 and 96.0%, respectively. Less coke was formed during the CO2-PDH reaction (1.0 wt % with CO2 vs 18.8 wt % without CO2) after 200 min on stream according to the TG analysis. Besides, the relatively more intense diffraction of the MFI topology in the XRD patterns and much weaker reflection from amorphous coke in the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1 after CO2-PDH in Figure S2 are also consistent with the less coke deposition. Consistent with our hypothesis, the introduction of CO2 during the PDH reaction indeed suppressed the carbon deposition over the Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalyst.
The carbon deposition and catalytic performance were next compared under similar C3H8 conversion (24.5 vs 23.0%) with and without CO2 by adjusting the GHSV. The Pt1Fe7/S-1 with higher GHSV in Figure 1 shows a lower initial C3H6 selectivity and C3H8 carbon balance of 89.5 and 91.6%, respectively. The TGA results showed that Pt1Fe7/S-1 produced a significant amount of coke reaching 15.0 wt % under the high-GHSV conditions, which is similar to the previous TGA results in the PDH reaction (18.8 wt %). Thus, we can conclude that the dramatic difference of the carbon deposition between PDH and CO2-PDH is not caused by the different partial pressure of C3H6 (C3H8 conversion) but due to the presence of CO2.
It is generally considered that coke can be eliminated by CO2via the reverse Boudouard (C + CO2 → 2CO) reaction. (50−52) Therefore, if the reverse water gas shift (RWGS: CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O) and reverse Boudouard reaction occurred simultaneously in the CO2-PDH reaction, the carbon balance of CO2 should exceed 100% (the moles of CO in the products would be higher than the moles of consumed CO2 since the C in the CO is partially from the coke). However, the CO2 carbon balance stayed at about 98.0% during the CO2-PDH reaction as shown in Figure S4B. Furthermore, the TG results showed that when the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1 after the PDH reaction was treated with pure CO2 at 550 °C for 2 h, the coke remained (20.0 vs 18.8 wt % and the difference was not significantly higher than the error of TG analysis), as shown in Figure S1D. These results suggested that the reverse Boudouard reaction had little contribution to the elimination of coke under our experimental conditions.
Based on the understanding of the structural evolution of Fe-based catalysts, Fe(0) species can be oxidized to Fe3O4 in the CO2 hydrogenation reaction. (44) In addition, a stable FeOx species shows a higher olefin selectivity and weaker coking ability in the PDH reaction compared with metallic iron species (although it has much lower contribution to the dehydrogenation rate than PtFe alloys). (46,47,53) Therefore, it seems reasonable that the introduction of CO2 under appropriate conditions can modulate the surface structure of the Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalyst during the reaction by oxidizing the coking active sites of the unalloyed Fe(0) species, while the PtFe alloy remains, leading to the higher C3H6 selectivity and suppressed coke formation.
3.2. Structure–Activity Relationship
In order to verify our hypothesis, the structures of the fresh and spent Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalyst were analyzed. As shown in the CO2 oxidation results in Figure 3, when the reduced Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalyst was treated with CO2, a sharp increase in the CO signal was observed, followed by the formation of H2O during the subsequent H2 reduction. These results confirmed that oxidation by CO2 occurred on the reduced Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalyst after introducing CO2, which is consistent with our hypothesis.
Figure 3
Figure 3. Overall (A) and enlarged (B) profiles of CO2 oxidation experiments for the reduced Pt1Fe7/S-1. Treatment conditions: T = 550 °C, ambient pressure, 0.10 g of the catalyst, pure H2 at 30 mL min–1 for the reduction, and 20 vol % of CO2 at 30 mL min–1 for the oxidation.
As shown in the ex situ XPS results in Figure 4A, the peaks located at 707.0 eV in the 2p3/2 region and 719.7 eV in the 2p1/2 region represent the metallic Fe species, while the peaks at 711.5 eV (2p3/2 region) and 724.8 eV (2p1/2 region) represent FeOx species. (54,55) Both metallic Fe and FeOx were identified in the Pt1Fe7/S-1 after PDH, while for the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1, after CO2-PDH, only the FeOx species was observed. Similar results were observed on the monometallic Fe/S-1 catalyst as shown in Figure S5. The presence of oxidized Fe species in the Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalyst after the PDH reaction is likely due to the unavoidable exposure to air in the ex situ XPS experiments. Mössbauer results also showed that the metallic Fe and Fe3C species were present in the Pt1Fe7/S-1 after the PDH reaction, while these Fe species with low valence states were absent after the CO2-PDH reaction as shown in Figure 5 and Table S1. Since both spent catalysts were exposed to air before the XPS and Mössbauer measurements, the oxidation by air on these two samples is likely similar. Therefore, we believe that the absence of Fe(0) in the catalyst after CO2-PDH indicates that the oxidation of Fe(0) occurred under CO2-PDH reaction conditions.

In the Pt 4f7/2 region, the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalysts after PDH and CO2-PDH both show the peak located at 71.3 eV in Figure 4B, which is assigned to metallic Pt (PtFe alloy) species. (35) These shreds of evidence indicate that most of Fe(0) species in the Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalyst are oxidized during the CO2-PDH reaction, while the platinum species has no significant oxidation. Consistent with our hypothesis, the addition of CO2 effectively modulated the catalytic structure by oxidizing the coking active sites on the excessive Fe(0) nanoparticles, which significantly suppressed the carbon deposition.
To investigate the electronic structure and coordination environment, the Pt1Fe7/S-1 after PDH and CO2-PDH reactions was analyzed by XAS and CO-DRIFTS, as shown in Figure 6, Table 1, and Figure S6. The ex situ Fe K edge XANES (Figure 6A) spectrum of the Pt1Fe7/S-1 after the PDH reaction lies between Fe(0) foil and Fe3O4, indicating the presence of both Fe(0) and oxidized Fe species due to the exposure to air. Both species were estimated to be ∼50% according to the linear combination fit using Fe(0) and Fe3O4 as the standards. The iron species of Pt1Fe7/S-1 after the CO2-PDH reaction has obviously higher edge energy and white line intensity, similar to those of Fe3O4. The linear combination fit using Fe(0) and Fe3O4 as the standards suggests that it is composed of ∼95% Fe3O4 and ∼5% Fe(0). This evidence illustrates that the excessive unalloyed Fe species were oxidized to Fe3O4 after the introduction of CO2, which is consistent with the XPS and Mössbauer results and our previous results on Fe catalysts in CO2 hydrogenation. (45) As seen from the Pt LIII edge XANES results (Figure 6B) of Pt1Fe7/S-1 after the PDH and CO2-PDH reaction, the XANES spectra of Pt species are similar to those of the Pt foil, indicating that the Pt species still exist in the metallic form [Pt(0) in the PtFe alloy], which is in line with the XPS analysis.

The wavelet analysis of Pt LIII edge EXAFS is shown in Figure S7. For the Pt foil, the Pt scattering features are centered at R ≈ 2.7 Å and k ≈ 11.5 Å–1, whereas for Pt1Fe7/S-1, after PDH, the main scattering paths produce features centered at R ≈ 2.5 Å and k ≈ 9.0 Å–1. The rise of the contribution at lower k and R indicates the presence of lighter (than Pt) scatterers and, in this case, Fe, within bonding distance surrounding Pt. The contribution at k ≈ 11.5 Å–1 remains significant indicating the presence of Pt scatterers. The wavelet analysis of Pt1Fe7/S-1 after CO2-PDH is similar to that of Pt1Fe7/S-1 after PDH. The scattering features are centered at R ≈ 2.5 Å and k ≈ 8.0 Å–1, again indicating the presence of Fe scatterers within bonding distance. The contribution from Pt scatterers (k ≈ 11.5 Å–1) is also significant, suggesting the presence of Pt scatterers. These results suggest the presence of PtFe alloy in both catalysts. Although the Fe K edge EXAFS spectra are of low quality and do not allow for detailed analysis to extract the local structural information, the Pt LIII edge EXAFS spectra (Figure 6C and Table 1) confirmed the Pt–Fe bonds in spent Pt1Fe7/S-1 after the PDH (2.60 Å with a CN of 2.0 ± 0.6) and CO2-PDH reaction (2.62 Å with a CN of 2.8 ± 0.6), which indicate the preservation of the PtFe alloy. (20) Besides the PtFe alloy, it is also possible to form Pt/FeOx sites under CO2-PDH conditions. Wei et al. found that if Pt atoms are isolated by FeOx, a much higher white line intensity in the XANES spectrum compared with the Pt foil will be observed. (56,57) However, the white line intensity of the Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalyst after both PDH and CO2-PDH is similar to that of the Pt foil, and similar results have been observed for many Pt alloys including PtFe, (20) PtMn, (18) PtCo, (21) and PtCr, (17) and so forth. Therefore, the XANES results were not supportive of the formation of a large amount of Pt/FeOx sites. In addition, only Pt–Pt and Pt–Fe scattering pairs were identified in EXAFS as shown in Table 1, without Pt–O scattering pairs, while for Pt/FeOx catalysts in the literature, Pt–O scattering pairs are always significant. (56,57) Due to the detection limit of XAS, Mossbauer, and other characterization techniques, the possible formation of a small amount of single-atom Pt/FeOx sites or the oxidized FeOx partially covering the surface Pt sites cannot be ruled out, which possibly leads to lower catalytic activity and/or higher selectivity toward C3H6. However, the XANES and EXAFS data showed that the PtFe alloy was the major form of the Pt species. As shown in Figure 6D, the infrared band of linearly absorbed CO on P1tFe7/S-1 had a red shift of 15 cm–1 compared with Pt/S-1 (2092–2077 cm–1), which is usually attributed to the formation of PtFe alloy. Besides, this linearly adsorbed CO peak located at 2076 cm–1 remained unchanged after 2 h of CO2 treatment, which demonstrates that the PtFe alloy remained after the oxidative dehydrogenation at high temperature.
The HR-TEM images are shown in Figure 7, and the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mappings of Pt and Fe are displayed in Figure S8. Uniform zeolite particles with a diameter of about 160 nm were observed in the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1 after PDH, with a large amount of amorphous carbon species. On the contrary, the amorphous carbon species was hardly observed in the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1 after CO2-PDH. Besides, the Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalyst after PDH and CO2-PDH showed similar average particle sizes as shown in Figure S9 (9.2 vs 10.0 nm), suggesting that the introduction of CO2 has little effect on sintering. The element distributions of Pt and Fe are uniform according to the EDS mapping results. A lattice spacing of 2.23 Å was observed for the spent Pt1Fe7/S-1, suggesting the presence of the Pt3Fe1 alloy phase (PDF# 89-2050) after both PDH and CO2-PDH. Therefore, the introduction of CO2 did oxidize the excessive unalloyed Fe(0) species but not the PtFe alloy nanoparticles. Consistent with our hypothesis, CO2 acted as a soft oxidant here, which selectively eliminated the unalloyed Fe species and suppressed the formation of coke. The PtFe alloy was well preserved in the CO2-PDH reaction, showing a high propylene selectivity and less coke.

The Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalyst was also evaluated in the PDH reaction after various pretreatments, and the catalytic performances are shown in Figures 8 and S10. The PDH performance of the Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalyst pretreated with CO2 was comparable to that of the reduced catalyst without any pretreatment, and the initial C3H8 conversion decreased slightly after the CO2 + H2 pretreatment (a molar ratio of 1:0.5). Besides, the C3H8 carbon balance and TGA results both indicated that the Pt1Fe7/S-1 catalyst pretreated with CO2 and CO2 + H2 produced a similar amount of coke during PDH, similar to the Pt1Fe7/S-1 without any pretreatment (all at ∼18 wt %). The XPS results in Figure 9 show that there was no metallic Fe species in the Pt1Fe7/S-1 after the CO2 pretreatment, while Fe(0) species appeared in the spent catalysts. These results illustrate that the CO2 did oxidize the Fe(0) nanoparticles to FeOx during the pre-treatment, but the latter was reduced back to Fe(0) under PDH conditions, leading to a large amount of coke and lower C3H6 selectivity. Therefore, the CO2 and CO2 + H2 pretreatment cannot effectively suppress the formation of coke, and co-feeding CO2 during the dehydrogenation reaction is crucial for stabilizing the FeOx species and suppressing the formation of coke.

Pretreatment conditions: T = 550 °C, ambient pressure, 0.15 g of the catalyst, CO2/N2 = 5/35 mL min–1 or CO2/H2/N2 = 5/2.5/32.5 mL min–1, and GHSV = 16,000 mL·h–1·gcat–1; reaction conditions: TOS = 15 min, T = 550 °C, ambient pressure, 0.15 g of the catalyst, and GHSV = 16,000 mL·h–1·gcat–1. PDH: C3H8/N2 = 5/35 mL min–1; CO2-PDH: CO2/C3H8/N2 = 5/5/30 mL min–1; and H2O-PDH: H2O/C3H8/N2 = 0.75/5/35. The coke amount is characterized on the spent catalysts after 200 min on stream.

Reduction of CO2 is always accompanied by the formation of H2O during the CO2-PDH reaction, and H2O has stronger oxidation ability than CO2. (8) Therefore, it is also worthy to consider the possible oxidation of unalloyed Fe species by H2O. We next co-fed H2O (0.75 mL/min) during the PDH reaction, the partial pressure of which was set similar to that in the CO2-PDH. Although it only produced about 1.0 wt % of coke during the H2O-PDH reaction similar to the CO2-PDH as shown in Figure 8, a much lower C3H8 conversion of 9.9% and a C3H6 selectivity of 87.5% were observed. These results further support the critical role of CO2 in eliminating the coking active sites and improving the C3H6 selectivity.
A series of catalytic testing with different molar ratios of CO2/C3H8 was next carried out, and the results are shown in Figures 10 and S11. With a CO2/C3H8 ratio of 1.00, the coke deposition was greatly inhibited from 18.8 to 1.0 wt %, and the initial C3H6 selectivity increased from 65.2 to 93.9%, compared with the PDH reaction under the same reaction conditions. With the decrease in the CO2/C3H8 ratio from 1.00 to 0.20, a higher C3H8 conversion was observed, and the amount of coke remained ∼1.0 wt %, as shown in Figure 10A. With further decrease in the CO2/C3H8 ratio, the carbon deposition started to increase significantly. Therefore, the best catalytic performance with a balanced conversion, selectivity, and coke deposition was achieved with a CO2/C3H8 ratio of 0.20. To better reveal the contribution from the RWGS reaction, we have compared the formation rates of CO and C3H6. As shown in Figure 10B, the formation rate of C3H6 dropped from 24.5 to 21.7 mmol gcat–1 h–1 within 3 h on stream, while the CO formation rate dropped from 6.7 to 5.0 mmol gcat–1 h–1. Note that the ratio of the CO formation rate to that of C3H6 remains almost constant at ∼0.24 as the reaction proceeds, indicating that 24% of the H2 produced from propane was converted in the presence of CO2. It is also worth noting that in CO2 hydrogenation on Pt1Fe7/S-1, CO is produced with ∼99.5% selectivity, and conversion of CO2 to hydrocarbons was negligible (Figure S14). These results indicate again that the introduction of CO2 is crucial for improving the C3H6 selectivity and suppressing the formation of coke, realizing the fine tuning for the structure of PtFe bimetallic catalysts through the RWGS reaction.

Reaction conditions: TOS = 15 min, T = 550 °C, ambient pressure, 0.15 g of the catalyst, C3H8 = 5 mL min–1, and GHSV = 16,000 mL·h–1·gcat–1. The amount of coke was determined on the spent catalysts after 200 min on stream.
4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The presence of unalloyed Fe(0) nanoparticles leads to significant coke deposition and low C3H6 selectivity during the PDH reaction. Here, we report a strategy to inhibit the formation of carbon deposition via utilizing the soft oxidation property of CO2. With a CO2/C3H8 molar ratio of 0.20, the selective oxidation of carbon deposition active sites on Fe(0) can be achieved, without destroying the catalytically active PtFe alloy surface. The significantly suppressed coke deposition does not result from the reverse Boudouard reaction but from the effective oxidation of excessive unalloyed Fe(0) species. We believe that these results provide insightful understanding toward the PtFe bimetallic catalysts in the PDH reaction and a guideline for fine tuning the catalysts for PDH and other reactions.
