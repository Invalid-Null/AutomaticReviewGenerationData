Single Co Sites in Ordered SiO2 Channels for Boosting Nonoxidative Propane Dehydrogenation

Abstract
Searching for low-cost, environmentally friendly, and highly active catalysts for C–H bond activation in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction remains a great challenge. Herein, SiO2 nanomeshes (NMs) with ultrashort three-dimensional (3D) channels were constructed to effectively confine the Co single atoms (Co SAs/SiO2 NMs). The ultrashort 3D channels were formed by gasifying carbon in the self-assembled SiO2@polymer composites under the air atmosphere. The carbon removal process resulted in abundant oxygen (O*) defects in the channel windowsill that immobilized the dissociative Co1 species to afford the sintering-resistant Co SAs/SiO2 NMs catalyst. The as-obtained Co SAs/SiO2 NMs with unsaturated Co–O3 sites exhibited an outstanding PDH catalytic behavior (95% selectivity and 196 h–1 turnover frequency), superior to Co SAs/SiO2 commerce (83%, 49 h–1), Co NPs/SiO2 NMs (87%, 13 h–1), and most non-noble metal-based catalysts. Furthermore, Co SAs/SiO2 NMs showed high long-term stability with no significant deactivation during 24 h of reaction. Theoretical and experimental analysis indicated that these unsaturated Co–O3 sites could selectively activate the first and second C–H bonds and limit the further splitting of C–H (C) bonds during PDH. This work paves a way for designing high-efficiency single-atom catalysts for PDH.

KEYWORDS:propane dehydrogenation ultrashort 3D channel unsaturated Co−O3 site oxygen defect C−H bond activation

PDH (propane dehydrogenation) is one of the most promising approaches to meet the growing needs of propylene, which is an essential raw material in the synthesis of plastics, fibers, and intermediates for the production of fine chemicals. (1−3) Supported Pt-based catalysts (such as Pt@H-beta, (4) Pt/Sn-ZSM-5, (5) and PtZn/SiO2 (6)) and Cr-based catalysts (for example, Cr/SiO2, (7) Cr-MSU-x, (8) and Cr/ZrOx (9)) are two currently common types of commercial catalysts efficient for PDH. Nevertheless, they have severe intrinsic shortcomings: environmental toxicity and low stability of Cr and natural scarcity of Pt. Therefore, developing cheap and efficient alternatives is a crucial research topic. Currently, supported non-noble metal nanoparticles/cluster catalysts have been explored as they are earth-abundant, eco-friendly, highly tunable, and considerably active for PDH. (10) For example, supported VOx clusters, (11) GaOx clusters, (12) Ni3Ga nanoparticles, (13) NiCe nanoparticles, (14) SnOx nanoparticles, (15) GaIn nanoparticles, (16) FeP nanoparticles (17) have been disclosed to be active catalysts for PDH. However, structure-sensitive side reactions (such as the production of ethane, methane, and coke) frequently occur on the surface of larger clusters and nanoparticles, which results in low propylene selectivity and catalyst deactivation.
Single-atom catalysts (SACs), in which isolated active sites are anchored on the support, offer a solution to selectively produce propylene and prevent further C–C (H) scissions during the PDH reaction. (18−21) Most single-atom sites for the dehydrogenation of the alkanes were anchored on the oxide substrates (SiO2, (22) Al2O3, (23) CeO2, (24) and so forth.), and the unsaturated single metal sites (such as Zn–O3, (25) Ni–O4, (26) Ga–O4, (27) and Fe–O3 sites (28)) are identified as active centers for PDH. However, these SACs often suffer from low intrinsic activity as well as thermal and chemical instabilities during the reaction. The active sites may not be adequately accessible by the reactant because of the bulky nature of the supports. (29,30) Furthermore, the active single sites transform into larger clusters or nanoparticles through severe sintering during the PDH reaction as the confinement effect of supports is absent in this case. (31−33) Therefore, to improve the PDH performance, it is challenging yet critical to find durable and high-surface-area support materials that stabilize the catalytically active single metal sites.
Herein, we report novel SiO2 nanomeshes (NMs) with ordered channels to yield thermally stable Co SAs/SiO2 NMs with unsaturated Co–O3 interfaces. A mechanism for the construction process of the Co SAs/SiO2 NMs is illustrated in Figure 1a. First, the oxygen (O*)-defect-rich channels could be obtained through the selective removal of the soft template under an air atmosphere. Then, these O* defects were utilized to trap dissociative Co ions to obtain the Co SAs/SiO2 NM catalyst. The obtained Co SAs/SiO2 NMs possess a high specific surface area and ultrashort pore length, which could ensure high accessibility of Co single sites and the fast mass transport of substrates, further increasing the reaction kinetics. In this work, Co SAs/SiO2 NMs exhibit superior activity for PDH [196 h–1 turnover frequency (TOF)] with respect to Co SAs/SiO2 commerce (com) (49 h–1), Co NPs/SiO2 NMs (13 h–1), and most non-noble metal-based catalysts.

In a detailed synthesis, first, 1 mL of ammonia, 35 mg of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), 10 mg of ammonium vanadate, and 0.45 mL of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) were dispersed into 35 mL of deionized water. Then, CTAB/SiO2 composites were obtained through a further thermal treatment at 80 °C for 8 h. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images at different growth times were recorded to understand the formation mechanism of the CTAB/SiO2 composite. First, CTA+-coated SiO2 monomicelles (Figures S1a and S2a) were transformed from spheres to cylinders, aggregating into little chains as the reaction progresses (Figures S1b and S2b). (34) The sustaining one-dimensional (1D) self-assembly leads to the rearrangement of CTAB on SiO2 nanoparticles, thus resulting in van der Waals attraction between the chains, and then, the CTA+-coated SiO2 chains gradually self-assemble into two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets. (35) (Figures S1c,d and S2c). As time goes on, active sites were exposed when some CTA+ ions absorbed on SiO2 were dissolved in water, the redundant chains were attached to the sites and dissolved into nanosheets (Figure S1e–g). Eventually, smooth CTAB/SiO2 composites with compact lamellar structures were formed (Figures S1h and S2d). (36) By the way, appropriate concentrations of reactants and appropriate temperature were essential for the successful formation of nanosheets (Figures S3–S8). There were no obvious pores in the CTAB/SiO2 composites, as shown from the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Figures 1b and S9). The composite possesses thicknesses of around 5.5 nm (Figure 1c). In addition, the corresponding energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images further confirmed that Si, O, and C are homogeneously dispersed on the whole composite (Figure 1d).
After annealing at 550 °C in air for 5 h, the copolymer template was successfully removed, and the remaining SiO2 formed a uniform and ultrashort channel structure (Figures S10 and S11). The ringlike selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in Figure S10d indicated that SiO2 NMs are amorphous materials. In addition, ordered pores of SiO2 NMs could be directly seen from the HRTEM image (Figure 1e). More specifically, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area and the average pore size were calculated to be 821 m2 g–1 and 4.1 nm, respectively (Figure S12). Notably, these sheets possessed an average thickness of ∼3.5 nm measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Figure 1f). SiO2 NMs are mainly composed of silicon and oxide with almost all templates removed, as displayed in Figure 1g. To obtain Co SAs/SiO2 NMs, SiO2 NMs were utilized to trap Co ions through O* defects, and then, the Co ions were further reduced and immobilized under a H2/Ar (5%/95%) atmosphere (550 °C, Figures S13 and S14). The resultant Co SAs/SiO2 NMs could maintain the original shape and the mesoporous structure of SiO2 NMs (Figure 1h, i). The EDS mapping images of Co SAs/SiO2 NMs indicated that cobalt atoms were uniformly dispersed on the SiO2 NMs (Figure 1j). In addition, the real loading of Co in Co SAs/SiO2 NMs obtained from the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) test is 0.48%.
The proposed structure showed that single Co sites were anchored on SiO2 NMs (Figure 2a). Interestingly, the X–Y intensity profiles from Figure 2b displayed that the fold of the sheet had three layers in thickness (Figure 2c). In contrast, the smooth region indicated with the purple dash line in Figure 2b possessed the thickness of only one layer (Figure 2d). More intuitively, homogeneous mesopores could be clearly seen from the magnified HRTEM image and the aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field STEM (AC-HAADF-STEM) image (Figure 2e, f). Additionally, the SAED pattern revealed the amorphous Co SAs/SiO2 NMs (inset of Figure 2f). Similar to SiO2 NMs, Co SAs/SiO2 NMs possessed a high specific surface area of 843 m2 g–1 with an average pore size of 3.9 nm (inset of Figure 2g). Using the HAADF-STEM image to confirm the form of Co single atoms (Figure 2h), the heavier isolated Co atoms could be readily discerned on the surface of the mesopore walls of the SiO2 NMs (see red circles in Figure 2i). Three-dimensional (3D) isolines (Figure 2j) of the yellow rectangle in Figure 2i further showed that the heavier Co atoms decorated the surface of the SiO2 substrate.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns further indicated that SiO2 NMs are amorphous. The XRD curve of Co SAs/SiO2 NMs displayed no distinct peaks, indicating the lack of large nanoparticles (Figure 3a). Then, the specific chemical environments of Co, O, and Si in Co SAs/SiO2 NMs were explored by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Figure S17). The XPS spectra of Co 2p exhibited that the 2p3/2 peak of Co in Co SAs/SiO2 NMs was at 780.3 eV, which is very close to cobaltous oxide (CoO) (780.4 eV) (Figure 3b). (37) To acquire more information about the atomic coordination and structural signature of the Co single sites in Co SAs/SiO2 NMs, the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements were implemented. The EXAFS spectrum (Figure 3c) showed that the absorption edge of Co SAs/SiO2 NMs was located between Co foil and CoO and was closer to CoO. Thus, combined with EXAFS and XPS data, we deduced that the valence state of cobalt in Co SAs/SiO2 NMs is around +2. The Fourier transformed (FT) k3-weighted EXAFS spectra of Co SAs/SiO2 NMs just showed one main peak at 1.59 Å, and no Co–Co apparent peak (2.17 Å) is observed (Figure 3d). Therefore, based on HAADF-STEM and EXAFS results, we concluded that Co sites are atomically dispersed. Furthermore, EXAFS fitting was implemented to acquire the structural parameters and the coordination number of Co atoms. The fitting curves of Co SAs/SiO2 NMs are depicted in Figure 3e and Table S1. The Co–O coordination number from the fitting parameter is 3, suggesting that Co single atoms are stabilized by coordinating with three oxygen atoms.

Because of the inert nature of SiO2, it is difficult to anchor single atoms on SiO2 stably. (38) It was confusing whether SiO2 NMs can steadily anchor the Co single atoms. Thus, H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) measurements were employed to detect the interactions between atomically dispersed Co and SiO2 NMs (Figure S18). By contrast, the Co SAs supported by commercial SiO2 (Co SAs/SiO2 (com)) were prepared (Figures S19 and S20). For Co SAs/SiO2 NMs, a single broad peak occurred at 670 °C, higher than Co SAs/SiO2 (com) at 610 °C, demonstrating the stronger interaction between Co atoms and SiO2 NMs. (39) To explore the reason for the greater stability of Co SAs/SiO2 NMs, the structural features of the samples were further investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) (Figure 3f). The EPR signal at a g value of 2.003 verified the presence of abundant O* vacancies on the surface of Co SAs/SiO2 NMs, whereas Co SAs/SiO2 (com) showed no obvious signal (Figure S21). (40) The defects may be generated from the air-pyrolysis process, which could be attributed to the removal of NC. (41) The O* vacancies can stabilize Co species and thus result in the superior thermal stability of Co SAs/SiO2 NMs. (42) In addition, the oxygen vacancy can be regulated by changing the calcination temperature and time (Figure S22). The oxygen vacancy concentration changed with calcination time under the same calcination temperature and reached the highest at 6 h. The increase in calcination temperature would lead to a decrease in the oxygen vacancy concentration. To verify the stability of Co sites on the SiO2 NM support, we also prepared the catalysts by annealing the Co(II)/SiO2 NM precursor at 800 and 900 °C in H2/Ar (5%/95%) for 3 h, respectively (Figure S23). The pore volume of Co SAs/SiO2 (900 °C) NMs could still maintain as high as 804 m2 g–1 with a pore size of 3.7 nm (Figure S24). We further used the HAADF-STEM image to certify the atomic dispersion of Co SAs/SiO2 (900 °C) NMs. It was distinct that all the Co species existed as isolated sites, and no clusters or nanoparticles were detected, further certifying that the Co single atoms were strongly confined by the carrier (Figure S25). Furthermore, the EXAFS fitting results of Co SAs/SiO2 (800 °C) NMs and Co SAs/SiO2 (900 °C) NMs are displayed in Figure S26 and Table S1, and only one peak at 1.59 Å appeared, indicating the atomic dispersion of Co in two samples. Nevertheless, for Co SAs on the commercial SiO2 support, a large proportion of single atoms aggregated to clusters when the reduction temperature was up to 700 °C (Figure S27).
The support of SACs not only affects the thermal stability but also the catalytic performances. To further explore the activity of the obtained Co SAs/SiO2 NMs catalyst, the catalytic performances were examined by the PDH reaction, which is one of the most promising approaches to produce propylene. Figure 4a showed the reaction paths; propane was adsorbed on the catalyst and activated to produce propylene and hydrogen. To further explore the activity of the Co SAs/SiO2 NMs catalyst, Co NPs/SiO2 NMs, SiO2 NMs, and Co SAs/SiO2 (com) were used as comparison samples. As shown in Figures S29 and S30, ethylene was the main byproduct of this reaction. Co SAs/SiO2 NMs demonstrated excellent selectivity for propylene production, while the other reference catalysts exhibited obvious generation of ethylene and other byproducts. Importantly, the Co SAs/SiO2 NMs catalyst exhibited the highest initial propylene selectivity and conversion. The propylene selectivity of Co SAs/SiO2 NMs, Co NPs/SiO2 NMs, Co SAs/SiO2 (com), and SiO2 NMs were 95, 87, 83, and 73%, respectively (Figure 4b), while their corresponding conversion were 25, 16, 7, and 4% (Figure 4c). The TOF of Co SAs/SiO2 NMs was 196 h–1, which is 15 times that of Co NPs/SiO2 NMs, five times that of Co SAs/SiO2 (com), and surpasses most of the reported non-noble metal-based catalysts. (Figure 4d and Table S3). In addition, the Co SAs/SiO2 NMs displayed an excellent steady-state selectivity for producing propylene. The selectivity of the Co SAs/SiO2 NM sample only decreased slightly (95–91%), and the conversion just dropped from 25 to 21% at 24 h reaction (Figure S31a), highlighting the high stability of the Co SAs/SiO2 NM catalyst. Moreover, compared with the initial run, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity of Co SAs/SiO2 NMs catalyst remained unchanged after two regeneration cycles (Figure S31b).

To further demonstrate the stability of the Co SAs/SiO2 NMs catalyst, a series of characterization of the catalyst after 24 h PDH reaction was executed. No clusters or nanoparticles appear in the HAADF-STEM image (Figure S32), which meant that the Co atoms are still atomically dispersed on SiO2 NMs after catalysis. After the reaction, the catalyst still maintained the high surface area of SiO2 NMs with the BET surface area of 813 m3 g–1, which nearly exhibited no change compared to the fresh catalyst (Figure S33). Specifically, the EXAFS fitting result confirmed the robustness of Co single sites after the reaction (Figure S34). Combining all of the above information, we concluded that Co in Co SAs/SiO2 NMs was still atomically dispersed on the support after a 24 h PDH process, and the catalyst displayed high long-term stability against the reaction. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Raman were used to explore whether carbon would deposit on the spent catalysts (Figure S35). About 6.8 wt. % of coke species deposited on Co SAs/SiO2 NMs during the PDH reaction, which led to the slight deactivation of the catalyst after long-term catalysis. Furthermore, to meet the requirement of the mass preparation of the catalyst, we tried preparing the sample in large quantities using the amplification experiment, obtaining about 5 g of catalyst at one time (Figure S36a). Then, the PDH performance of the large-scale catalyst was tested; what was exciting was that it showed similar catalytic properties to Co SAs/SiO2 NMs prepared in small quantities (Figure S36b).
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were further performed to reveal the mechanism of the PDH activity on Co SAs/SiO2 NMs. The amorphous structure of SiO2 NMs was obtained from the ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulation (Figures S37 and S38). Then, the Co–O3 active center was simulated on the basis of experimental data. The calculation results show that the bond length of Si–O is 1.99 Å, which is comparable with the EXAFS results (2.05 Å) (Table S2). As displayed in Figure S39, the oxidation state of Co calculated from the Bader charge was between 0 and +2, which is also consistent with the EXAFS and XPS results. The charge interaction between the Co species with the different SiO2 support was studied using the Bader charge analysis method, as the more charge transfer means the stronger interfacial interaction. (43,44) The charge density difference displayed that the electrons transferred from the Co single atom to the surrounding O atoms on the SiO2 surface (Figure 4e). The charge shift of the Co single site to the surrounding O atoms in Co SAs/SiO2 NMs was 1.24e, while in the crystalline cristobalite-SiO2, it was 0.85e, indicating the stronger interfacial interaction between Co SAs and SiO2 NMs. (45) For the PDH process, the propane molecules may react via dehydrogenation on the methylene group or the terminal methyl group (Figure 4f). The rate-determining step (RDS) over Co SAs/SiO2 NMs was the CH3CHCH3* production step with the reaction energy of 1.17 eV, whereas the RDS on Co3O4 (110) was the dehydrogenation of CH3CHCH2* with the reaction energy of 2.23 eV. These results proved that the Co–O3 center of Co SAs/SiO2 NMs possesses a lower maximum reaction energy barrier for the reaction. Based on the above results, our calculations are in good accordance with the experimental observation of a superior PDH activity for the Co SAs/SiO2 NMs catalyst.
In summary, we have developed novel SiO2 NMs with abundant O* defects to anchor active Co single sites. The highly open 3D channels of the SiO2 NMs ensure a sufficient contact of the active sites with the substrates. Thus, the Co SAs/SiO2 NMs exhibited excellent PDH performance with superior propylene selectivity (95%) and high activity (196 h–1, TOF) in comparison with Co SAs/SiO2 (com) (83% and 49 h–1) and Co NPs/SiO2 NMs (87% and 13 h–1). DFT calculations suggested that the unsaturated Co single atoms with the Co–O3 structure are more favorable for the C–H bond activation than the Co3O4 nanoparticles in the PDH reaction. These new findings constitute a promising approach to develop non-noble metal SACs for alkane dehydrogenation.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
