The provided document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically for the conversion of propane to propylene. The document focuses on non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane, and isobutane over ZrO2-based catalysts doped with different metal oxides. While propane dehydrogenation is examined, it is not in the context of converting propane to propylene.
