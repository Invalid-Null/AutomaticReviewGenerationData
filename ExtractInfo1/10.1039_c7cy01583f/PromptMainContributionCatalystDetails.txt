Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane, and isobutane over bulk ZrO2-based catalysts: effect of dopant on the active site and pathways of product formation†
Non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane, n-butane, and isobutane was investigated over bare ZrO2 and binary MZrOx (M = Li, Ca, Mg, Y, Sm or La) materials. Selected samples were characterized by XRD, Raman spectroscopy, NH3 temperature-programmed desorption, IR spectroscopy and O2 titration experiments. A correlation between the rate of olefin formation and the concentration of anion vacancies formed upon reductive catalyst treatment was established. Such defects represent the catalytically active sites, which are coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ (Zrcus) cations. From a structural viewpoint, the active Zrcus sites should have a lower coordination number than the Zrcus sites located on the top of an ideal flat surface, thus highlighting the importance of surface defects in the target reactions. However, the intrinsic activity of such sites and/or their concentration depends on the kind of dopant for ZrO2. The dopant was also shown to inhibit side reactions especially those leading to coke due to reducing the concentration of strong acidic sites related to ZrO2. Similar to an analogue of industrial K-CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, all binary catalysts exhibited low activity for consecutive reactions of the target olefins; the desired selectivity was higher than 85% at an alkane conversion of about 30%. With respect to the feed alkane, primary selectivity (at a zero degree of alkane conversion) to the target olefin decreases in the order: C3H8, iso-C4H10, and n-C4H10. This was explained by the higher stability of surface intermediates formed from the latter two contributing to the formation of coke and 1,3-butadiene, respectively.
1. Introduction
Zirconium dioxide (ZrO2), also known as zirconia, is an important material widely applied in different fields such as gas sensors,1 heterogeneous catalysis2 and even stomatology (dental implants).3 In heterogeneous catalysis, this material is mainly used as a support for the preparation of catalysts applied for hydrogenation of unsaturated organic compounds,4 CO oxidation,5 water-gas-shift reaction,6 hydrodechlorination of chlorinated organic compounds,7 Fischer–Tropsch synthesis,8etc. Since ZrO2 has certain redox properties as well as both acidic and basic surface sites, it is also used as a catalyst, e.g., for CO hydrogenation,9 isomerization of hydrocarbons10 and alcohol dehydration.11
Recently, bulk ZrO2-based materials were demonstrated to catalyse non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.12,13 Just like other known non-oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts, they deactivate with time-on-stream. Their initial performance can be restored after oxidative treatment and is not changed in a series of dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles. The initial space time yield of propene obtained over such catalysts was similar to that over an analogue of industrial K-CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. From a mechanistic point of view, a coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ (Zrcus) cation and a neighbouring lattice oxygen seem to be responsible for propane activation through breaking the C–H bond. It was also suggested that Zrcus sites can be created upon doping of ZrO2 with oxides of metals with oxidation state lower than +4 and/or upon reductive catalyst treatment. Thorough mechanistic studies were, however, not performed for elucidating the effects of the kind of dopant on both activity and, particularly, product selectivity. Does the dopant help to create catalytically active sites, affect their concentration or also participate in the reaction actively? Such fundamental knowledge is highly important for the design of catalysts with the desired dehydrogenation properties.
It is well known that the kind of dopant may significantly influence both the phase composition and the physico-chemical properties of zirconia.14,15 For bare ZrO2, the monoclinic phase is thermodynamically stable at temperatures below 1175 °C, the tetragonal phase exists between 1175 and 2370 °C, while the cubic phase is formed above 2370 °C.16 The tetragonal and cubic phases, however, can be stabilized even at room temperature when ZrO2 is doped with lower valence metal oxides, e.g. Y2O3 or CaO. The substitution of zirconium cations (Zr4+) with cations of such oxides leads to the formation of oxygen vacancies for charge compensation as exemplarily shown in eqn (1) or (2) (in the Kröger–Vink notation) for doping of ZrO2 with trivalent (M2O3) or divalent (MO) metal oxide according to ref. 17–19. The number of oxygen vacancies which can be formed in the ZrO2 lattice depends on the valence state of the dopant cation; the higher the difference in oxidation stage between the dopant and Zr4+, the higher is the concentration of oxygen vacancies at the same promoter concentration.

O
is the doubly positive ionized oxygen vacancy, is the singly negative ionized substitution site when Zr4+ is substituted by M3+, and is the doubly negative ionized substitution site when Zr4+ is substituted by M2+.
Thus, one oxygen vacancy is formed upon introducing two trivalent cations into the cation sublattice of ZrO2, while every divalent cation causes the creation of one oxygen vacancy. Such defects are responsible for the stabilization of tetragonal or cubic ZrO2 phases at low temperatures. Moreover, the presence of oxygen vacancies makes zirconia an excellent ionic conductor with high mobility of lattice oxygen.20 The size of the substitutional cation can, however, affect the degree of ZrO2 stabilization in the tetragonal or cubic phases. Thus, trivalent oversized (r(M3+) > r(Zr4+)) and undersized (r(M3+) < r(Zr4+)) cations behave differently in the ZrO2 lattice. For example, the former cations favour association of oxygen vacancies with Zr4+, while the latter can compete with Zr4+ for oxygen vacancies. In addition, the temperature for transformation from the amorphous or monoclinic ZrO2 phase to the tetragonal counterpart depends on the size of the cation in the metal oxide promoter. For example, the transformation occurs at higher temperature when ZrO2 (r(Zr4+) = 0.79 Å (ref. 21)) is doped with La2O3 (r(La3+) = 1.14 Å (ref. 21)) than when it is doped with Y2O3 (r(Y3+) = 0.92 Å (ref. 21)). On the other hand, since the radius of La3+ is larger than that of Y3+, lattice distortion is higher for La2O3-doped ZrO2.22
Against the above background, the objective of the present study was to further elucidate the structure of catalytically active sites in ZrO2-based catalysts and to identify the factors affecting their formation, activity, and selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, isobutane and n-butane. In contrast to propane/propene, butanes and particularly butenes (the desired products of dehydrogenation of butanes) can participate in skeletal and double-bond isomerization reactions. The formed isomers may have different reactivity in their further consecutive reactions. To understand if and how both the structural and catalytic properties of ZrO2 are influenced by the kind of metal oxide promoter, we prepared ZrO2 promoted by La2O3, Y2O3, Sm2O3, CaO, MgO, or Li2O. The promoters strongly differ in their valence, acid–base properties, and cation radius. The effect of the dopant on the phase composition of the resulting binary metal oxides was investigated by XRD and Raman spectroscopy. O2-pulse titration experiments were instrumental in quantifying the number of oxygen vacancies in reduced materials. The vacancies directly represent the presence of Zrcus sites. The influence of the kind of dopant for ZrO2 on the strength and the concentration of surface acidic sites was elucidated by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia. The obtained characterization results were related to the results of catalytic tests performed to determine the activation energies of propene, isobutene, and n-butene formation over different samples and to establish reaction pathways leading to the target and side products including carbon deposits. A reference K-CrOx/Al2O3 material was also studied in this work in order to check if and how it differs from our bulk catalysts in terms of product selectivity in a broad range of alkane conversion.
2. Experimental details
2.1. Catalyst preparation
ZrOCl2·8H2O (>95%, Fluka), ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O (99%, Sigma Aldrich), zirconium acetate solution in dilute acetic acid (15.8 wt% Zr, Aldrich), citric acid (>99%, Merck), Ca(NO3)2·4H2O (99%, Alfa Aesar), Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (99%, Acros), Sm(NO3)3·6H2O (99.9%, Sigma Aldrich), Li2CO3 (Apolda), polyvinyl alcohol (M = 28 000–40 000, Germed), sucrose (Berlin-Chemie), HNO3 (65%, Fisher), NH3 (25% aqueous solution, Roth), KOH (Merck), CrO3 (99.9%, Sigma Aldrich), and Al2O3 (Saint-Gobain NorPro) were used for catalyst preparation. The samples La8Zr92Ox (10 wt% La2O3 in ZrO2, La : Zr molar ratio is 8 : 92) and Y9Zr91Ox (8 wt% Y2O3 in ZrO2, Y : Zr molar ratio is 9 : 91) were provided by MEL Chemicals.
Bare ZrO2 was synthesized according to the following protocol.23 A required amount of ZrOCl2·8H2O was dissolved in deionized water at room temperature to obtain a solution with a Zr4+ concentration of 1.0 M. An aqueous solution of ammonia was then added dropwise under stirring until pH 9 was reached. The precipitate formed was aged overnight, filtered, and washed several times with deionized water until chloride ions were no longer identified in the filtrate (reaction with AgNO3). The solid was dried at 110 °C overnight and calcined at 550 °C for 4 hours.
To prepare Sm10Zr90Ox, the required amounts of ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O and Sm(NO3)3·6H2O were dissolved in deionized water at room temperature to obtain a solution with a total cation concentration of 0.5 M (C(Sm3+) : C(Zr4+) = 1 : 9). To obtain solid materials, we further used the same procedure as described above for the preparation of ZrO2.
Zirconium acetate solution, citric acid, calcium nitrate, and magnesium nitrate were used as starting materials for the synthesis of Ca10Zr90Ox and Mg10Zr90Ox. A certain volume of zirconium acetate solution was initially mixed with an aqueous solution of calcium (or magnesium) nitrate at room temperature. The resulting solution was further diluted with deionized water under stirring to obtain an overall cation concentration of about 0.35 M (C(M2+) : C(Zr4+) = 1 : 9, M2+ = Ca2+ or Mg2+). Hereafter, a certain amount of citric acid (citric acid : (Zr4+ + M2+) molar ratio of 2 : 1) was dissolved in 100 mL of water and added to this solution dropwise under stirring. A white gel was formed during this procedure. It was dried at 100 °C for 36 hours. Finally, the obtained catalyst precursors were calcined at 550 °C for 4 hours.
Li10Zr90Ox was prepared according to the following procedure.24 First, 1.9 g of Li2CO3, 3 g of polyvinyl alcohol and 30 g of sucrose were dissolved at room temperature in 300 mL of water under stirring. Then, 5 mL of HNO3 were added to the solution. The resulting mixture was heated to 50–60 °C. Hereafter, the required amount (about 9 g) of ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O was added to the solution under stirring to obtain a Li+ : Zr4+ molar ratio of 1 : 9. The solution was then evaporated until a sticky dark material was obtained. The material was dried at 150 °C for 30 min, and then the temperature was increased up to 250 °C and kept for 1 hour. The solid was cooled to room temperature, crushed and calcined at 650 °C for 4 hours.
An analogue of industrial K-CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared according to the protocol described in a patent from SüdChemie.25 Briefly, two aqueous solutions with the required amounts of CrO3 and KOH were separately prepared and then mixed together. Hereafter, Al2O3 was impregnated with the resulting solution. The catalyst precursor was dried at 120 °C overnight and calcined at 760 °C for 4 hours. The nominal concentration of Cr2O3 and K2O in the resulting catalyst was 19.7 wt% and 0.93 wt%, respectively.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Nitrogen physisorption experiments at −196 °C were carried out on a Belsorp mini II setup (Bel Japan) to determine the specific surface area (SBET) of the samples. Desorption isotherms were evaluated according to the BET method.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on an X'Pert Pro Theta/Theta diffractometer (PANalytical) with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA) and an X'Celerator RTMS detector. The phase composition of the samples was identified using the program suite WinXPOW (Stoe & Cie) with inclusion of the powder diffraction file PDF2 of the International Centre for Diffraction Data.
Raman spectroscopic investigations were performed using a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope. The samples were irradiated by a 633 nm laser with an output power of 1–16 mW.
The concentration of anion vacancies in reduced catalysts was determined by O2-pulse experiments performed at 550 °C in a temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor.26,27 Each catalyst (50 or 100 mg, particle size: 315–710 or 250–710 μm) was placed in a quartz-tube microreactor between two layers of quartz sand (particle size: 250–350 μm). Before starting the pulse experiments, each catalyst was treated according to the following protocol. First, it was heated in an O2 flow (10 mL min−1) up to 550 °C at a heating rate of 10 K min−1. Hereafter, the catalyst was further heated in a N2 flow (10 mL min−1) up to 600 °C and then exposed to a H2 (57 vol% H2 in N2) flow (10 mL min−1) at the same temperature for 1 hour. After completing the reductive treatment, the catalyst was cooled to 550 °C upon evacuation to ca. 70 Pa. Then it was exposed to a high vacuum of 10−5 Pa. The pulse experiments were performed using an O2 : Ar = 1 : 1 mixture. Ar (5.0) and O2 (4.5) were applied without additional purification. The mixture was pulsed until no changes in the intensity of O2 pulses were observed during the last 30–40 pulses. The experiments with each catalyst were repeated at least 3 times and an average value of consumed oxygen is reported in the manuscript. A quadrupole mass spectrometer (HAL RC 301 Hiden Analytical) was used to quantify O2 and Ar according to standard fragmentation patterns and sensitivity factors determined in a separate O2-pulse experiment carried out without catalyst.
Temperature-programmed ammonia desorption (NH3-TPD) tests were performed in an in-house designed set-up containing eight individually heated continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactors. Two types of tests were performed with a fresh catalyst sample (50 mg). In the first series, the catalysts were initially calcined in air at 600 °C for 1 hour and then cooled to 120 °C in air and purged with an Ar flow for 15 min. Alternatively, the same calcination procedure was initially performed followed by purging with Ar for 15 min and catalyst reduction at 600 °C in a flow of 57 vol% H2 in Ar for 1 hour. The reduced catalysts were then cooled to 120 °C in Ar. All the treated catalysts were exposed to a flow of ammonia (1% NH3 in Ar) at 120 °C for 1 hour, purged with an Ar flow for 5 hours to remove weakly bound NH3, and then cooled to 80 °C. In the final step, the catalysts were heated to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 K min−1 in the same Ar flow. Desorbed ammonia was registered using an on-line mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320). The signals at atomic mass units of 15 (NH) and 40 (Ar) were used for quantitative analysis.
2.3. Catalytic tests
All catalytic tests were performed at ambient pressure in an in-house developed setup consisting of 15 continuous-flow tubular (dinner = 4 mm) quartz fixed-bed reactors. Reaction rates of propene, n-butenes (all linear butenes were taken into account) or isobutene formation were determined at 550 °C at a degree of alkane conversion below 10% over oxidized catalysts and those pre-reduced at 600 °C in H2 flow (57 vol% H2 in N2) for 1 hour. Apparent activation energies of olefin formation were determined from the Arrhenius plots of the rates measured at 500, 525, 550, 575, and 600 °C. Before starting such tests, the catalysts were initially heated to 600 °C in an N2 flow and then calcined in an air flow for 1 hour. Then, they were purged with N2 for 15 min and treated in an H2 flow (57 vol% H2 in N2) for 1 hour. The catalysts were then purged with N2 with simultaneous cooling to the first reaction temperature (500 °C). Hereafter, they were exposed to a flow of a CnH2n+2–N2 mixture (40 vol% CnH2n+2) and the rates of olefin formation were measured. In the next step, the catalysts were purged with N2 for 15 min, heated to 600 °C, and reoxidized in air for 30 min. Then, they were again purged with N2 for 15 min, reduced at 600 °C for 1 hour, purged again with N2 and cooled to 525 °C. After this step, dehydrogenation reaction was carried out at 525 °C. The experiments at 550, 575, and 600 °C were performed in the same way as described above. To keep propane conversion below 10% at each temperature, the flow of the C3H8 : N2 = 40 : 60 mixture was adjusted to 5, 5, 10, 20, and 40 mL min−1 for 500, 525, 550, 575, and 600 °C, respectively. The corresponding flows of 40 vol% n-C4H10 in N2 and 40 vol% i-C4H10 in N2 were 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 mL min−1. The rate of propene formation was measured after 190 s on stream, while that of n-butenes or isobutene was measured after 270 s due to the different length of gas-chromatographic methods required for separating C3 and C4 feed components and reaction products.
To determine an overall scheme of product formation in the course of dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane, and isobutane, additional tests were performed at different contact times to achieve different degrees of alkane conversion. The contact time was modified by varying the total flow (20, 40, and 60 mL min−1) of the corresponding reaction feed and catalyst amount (0.01–1.2 g). The tests were carried out with the catalysts reduced at 600 °C in an H2 flow (57 vol% H2 in N2) for 1 hour.
For analysing the effect of O2, H2O or CO2 on catalyst activity, a series of propane dehydrogenation tests was performed at 550 °C. The catalysts were initially heated to 600 °C in an N2 flow, calcined in air flow at 600 °C for 1 hour, purged with N2 for 15 min, and treated in an H2 flow (57 vol% H2 in N2) for 1 hour. Hereafter, the catalysts were cooled in an N2 flow to 550 °C and finally exposed to a flow of a certain reaction feed. The applied feeds contained 40 vol% C3H8 and one of the following additives: 0.5 vol% O2, 10 vol% H2O or 0.5 vol% CO2. The balance was nitrogen. Fresh samples were used for different feeds. The rate of propene formation was measured after 190 s on stream.
The feed components and the reaction products were analysed using an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890) equipped with PLOT/Q (for CO2), AL/S (for hydrocarbons), and Molsieve 5 (for H2, O2, N2, and CO) columns as well as with flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors.
The alkane conversion and the selectivity to gas-phase products were calculated according to eqn (3) and (4), respectively. Coke selectivity was determined from the difference between unity and the sum of selectivities to all determined gas-phase products (eqn (5)).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Phase composition and surface area
According to ex situ XRD analysis (Fig. 1), bare ZrO2 basically consists of the monoclinic phase (m-ZrO2) and to a minor extent of tetragonal phase (t-ZrO2). For the Li10Zr90Ox sample, a crystalline phase Li2ZrO3 with a small admixture of m-ZrO2 was identified. The XRD patterns of La8Zr92Ox, Y9Zr91Ox, Sm10Zr90Ox, Ca10Zr90Ox, and Mg10Zr90Ox do not contain m-ZrO2 reflexes but are characterized by the reflexes corresponding to t-ZrO2 and/or cubic phase ZrO2 (c-ZrO2). These two phases have very similar XRD patterns (Fig. S1 in the ESI†) due to the similarity of their lattice parameters. The presence of the metastable tetragonal and/or cubic phases in the doped materials is related to the stabilizing effect of dopants as had been documented previously.16

To examine if our binary materials consist of tetragonal or cubic phases or their mixtures, we characterized selected samples with Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra of ZrO2, La8Zr92Ox, Y9Zr91Ox, and Sm10Zr90Ox are presented in Fig. 2.
Fig. 2 Raman spectra of (a) ZrO2, (b) La8Zr92Ox, (c) Y9Zr91Ox, and (d) Sm10Zr90Ox.
The spectrum of the ZrO2 sample exhibits fourteen sharp Raman bands at 178, 189, 220, 306, 333, 346, 380, 474, 500, 536, 557, 614, 635, and 754 cm−1, which are characteristic of the monoclinic phase.28 Weak bands at 146 and 265 cm−1 could be assigned to the tetragonal phase. The spectrum of La8Zr92Ox reveals 5 broad bands at 146, 265, 323, 460, and 633 cm−1. According to ref. 29, they can be assigned to the tetragonal phase. The Raman spectra of Y9Zr91Ox and Sm10Zr90Ox are, in general, similar to the spectrum of La8Zr92Ox with the relative intensity of the band located at 633 cm−1 being higher. This might be due to the presence of small amounts of c-ZrO2. In addition to the tetragonal phase, the monoclinic phase should be present in Sm10Zr90Ox since the Raman spectrum of this sample shows weak Raman bands at 176, 189, and 379 cm−1, which are typical for m-ZrO2. The amount of m-ZrO2 in Sm10Zr90Ox should, however, be low because the intensity of these bands is significantly lower than that of the bands characteristic of the tetragonal phase.
Table 1 provides the composition of the ZrO2-based catalysts and the K-CrOx/Al2O3 reference material as well as their specific surface area (SBET) determined according to the BET method. The SBET values of the former catalysts are largely affected by the kind of dopant. All doped catalysts with the exception of Mg10Zr90Ox and Li10Zr90Ox possess larger specific surface areas in comparison with bare ZrO2. The highest SBET value of 95.3 m2 g−1 was determined for Ca10Zr90Ox, while Li10Zr90Ox revealed the lowest area of only 18.4 m2 g−1.

3.2. Acidic properties and structural defects
The effect of the kind of dopant on the acidic properties of binary ZrO2-based materials was elucidated by NH3-TPD. Both oxidized and reduced catalysts (see section 2.2 for details) were studied. Fig. 3 shows the NH3-TPD profiles obtained. Regardless of the type of catalyst treatment, no ammonia desorption could be detected in TPD tests with Li10Zr90Ox. This means that this catalyst does not possess acidic sites able to adsorb NH3 at 120 °C. For all other catalysts, NH3 desorption was observed in a broad temperature range between 150 and 600 °C, thus proving the presence of acidic sites with higher strength than on the surface of Li10Zr90Ox.

According to several previous studies,30–32 such sites should be Zrcus with a Lewis acidity character as supported by the discussion below. They are typically formed through recombination of surface OH groups during thermal treatment of zirconia as shown in eqn (6).33,34 We have actually observed water formation upon catalyst treatment in an H2-containing flow at 600 °C. Such treatment removed practically all hydroxyl groups as concluded from H2O profiles recorded upon catalyst heating even to 900 °C (Fig. S2 in the ESI†). The presence of Lewis acidic sites was additionally confirmed by IR measurements of pyridine adsorbed on Y9Zr91Ox (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†). Since reduced catalysts possess a higher concentration of acidic sites in comparison with the corresponding reduced materials (Table 1), we put forward that additional Zrcus sites were formed upon catalyst treatment by H2 leading to the creation of anion vacancies, at which the acidic Zrcus sites are located. From a mechanistic viewpoint, the vacancies can be formed according to eqn (6) or through direct removal of lattice oxygen by hydrogen (eqn (7)).
−OH + −OH → Olattice + vacancy + H2O (6)
Olattice + H2 → vacancy + H2O (7)
The number of acidic sites and, particularly, their strength are also influenced by the kind of dopant. As displayed in Table 1, ZrO2 possesses the highest density of surface acidic sites expressed as the number of NH3 molecules adsorbed on one square nanometre of catalyst surface (NH3 per nm2). With respect to the dopant, the density decreases in the order La > Y > Sm > Mg > Ca. The decrease cannot be simply explained by a partial substitution of acidic Zrcus by the dopant of a basic nature because the drop does not correlate with the dopant concentration. Therefore, we suggest that the dopant indirectly affects both the intrinsic acidity and the number of Zrcus sites. This assumption is supported by the following discussion. On the basis of simple mathematical deconvolution of NH3-TPD profiles, three (two in case of Mg10Zr90Ox) could different acidic sites could be identified on the surface of all ZrO2-based catalysts (Fig. S4 in the ESI†). They are characterized by the maxima of NH3 desorption at temperatures of 210–220 °C, 270–280 °C and 415 °C (Table S1†).
The presence and the kind of dopant influence the concentration of strongly adsorbed NH3 as concluded from the fact that the area of the desorption peak at 415 °C decreased after promoting of ZrO2.
The existence of anion vacancies in the reduced samples was also proven by O2-pulse titration experiments at 550 °C in the TAP reactor. As in the case of NH3-TPD tests, the catalysts were reduced in H2 flow (57 vol% H2 in N2) at 600 °C for 1 hour before the titration experiments. The concentration of anion vacancies (direct indicators for Zrcus) was calculated from the amount of O2 consumed under the assumption that one O2 molecule fills two vacancies. Noticeably, O2-pulse titration experiments were performed under high-vacuum conditions. Therefore, only highly reactive anion vacancies, which were created during reductive catalyst treatment (generated oxygen vacancies), can be titrated. Those oxygen vacancies, which are present in binary ZrO2-based catalysts for charge compensation (structural oxygen vacancies), are stabilized by doped metal cations and unlikely consume gaseous oxygen under such experimental conditions. It is worth mentioning that the concentration of anion vacancies should be considered as a semi-quantitative measure of Zrcus because of the following reasons. On the basis of the coordination number of lattice oxygen in the bulk of an ideal t-ZrO2 or c-ZrO2 crystal, four Zrcus sites should be formed upon removal of one lattice oxygen while three or four Zrcus sites are generated in the lattice of m-ZrO2 depending on the structural location of oxygen removed. However, when considering corners, steps, and the ideal flat surface it is difficult to determine how many Zrcus sites are really created upon reductive catalyst treatment. The number of oxygen atoms consumed by 1 gram of each sample is given in Table 1. Since doped zirconia has high mobility of lattice oxygen, we cannot completely exclude the influence of bulk oxygen vacancies on the total amount of oxygen consumed during O2-pulse experiments. The highest amount of consumed oxygen was observed for Y9Zr91Ox and decreased in the order Y9Zr91Ox > La8Zr92Ox > Sm10Zr90Ox > ZrO2. The amount of oxygen atoms consumed by Ca10Zr90Ox and Li10Zr90Ox was too low to be determined precisely. Based on the results obtained, we can conclude that different dopants have different abilities to generate and/or stabilize generated oxygen vacancies on the surface of binary ZrO2-based catalysts. Nevertheless, the number of structural oxygen vacancies is determined by the concentration and valence of the doped metal cation. According to ref. 14, solutions of metal oxides in ZrO2 are characterized by the transformation of monoclinic ZrO2 phase into the cubic or tetragonal phase, which occurs at low temperature. Such transformation was proven to take place in our samples (Fig. 1 and 2), i.e. those with a tetragonal structure should represent solid solutions. Under these considerations and on the basis of eqn (1) and (2), we estimated a theoretical number of structural oxygen vacancies statistically distributed both in the bulk and on the surface of our doped ZrO2 samples. This number decreases in the following order: Ca10Zr90Ox = Mg10Zr90Ox > Sm10Zr90Ox > Y9Zr91Ox > La8Zr92Ox.
3.3. Activity in propane dehydrogenation
The rate of propene formation was determined at 550 °C for both oxidized and reduced ZrO2-based oxides, with the purpose of understanding the effects of dopant and treatment conditions on catalyst activity. The rate was measured at a degree of propane conversion not higher than 10% to ensure differential conditions. On the basis of the values of activation energy of alkene formation (Table 2), the Mears criterion and the Weisz–Prater criterion (see the ESI†), it can be concluded that our catalytic tests were performed in a kinetic regime, i.e. without the influence of mass and heat transport limitations. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 4. It is obvious that the kind of dopant strongly influences the rate of propene formation. In comparison with pure ZrO2, the presence of La3+, Y3+ or Sm3+ results in a rise in the rate, while Ca2+, Mg2+ and Li+ have a strong negative effect on the activity. The different effect of dopant on catalytic activity will be explained after providing some additional data in section 3.6. It is also seen in Fig. 4 that all reduced samples showed higher activity than their oxidized counterparts. The highest activity was achieved over reduced Y9Zr91Ox, which exhibited an about three times higher rate than bare ZrO2 tested under the same conditions. The positive effect of reductive treatment on the reaction rate over the Ca10Zr90Ox, Mg10Zr90Ox, and Li10Zr90Ox samples was lower than for all other catalysts.

Fig. 4 Initial rates of propene formation at 550 °C over oxidized (black bars) and reduced (grey bars) ZrO2-based catalysts.
As Y9Zr91Ox showed the highest activity among our binary catalysts, we decided to test its durability in a series of 20 propane DH/regeneration cycles and compare with the performance of K-CrOx/Al2O3 at the same WHSV of 1.6 h−1. The initial conversion of propane was in the range 29–34% (Fig. S5(a) in the ESI†). Propene selectivity during the whole experiment was higher than 80% (Fig. S5(b) in the ESI†). The temporal change of space time yield (STY) of propene obtained in each DH stage over the catalysts tested is shown in Fig. S5(c) in the ESI.† Owing to its higher density, Y9Zr91Ox demonstrated higher maximal productivity within one catalytic cycle than K-CrOx/Al2O3. An increase in STY over both catalysts within a few minutes on stream can be explained by the in situ creation of active DH sites since the samples were not reduced before DH stages. Deactivation of the catalysts after about 10 min on DH stream is caused by formation of coke, which can be completely removed during the oxidative regeneration stage. No significant difference in catalyst performance from cycle to cycle was detected (Fig. S5 in the ESI†). Thus, Y9Zr91Ox showed both high activity and durability even when comparing its performance with that of K-CrOx/Al2O3.
3.4. Kinetics of alkane dehydrogenation
The apparent activation energies (Ea) of propene, isobutene, or n-butene (1- and 2-isomers) formation were determined over selected ZrO2-based catalysts as well as over an analogue of industrial K-CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. The reaction temperature was varied between 500 °C and 600 °C. It is important to repeat that before measuring the rate at a certain reaction temperature, the catalysts were reduced at 600 °C, i.e. at the highest reaction temperature, in order to ensure the same catalyst reduction degree. This is important because catalyst activity depends on the treatment procedure (Fig. 4). The activation energy values are summarized in Table 2, while the corresponding Arrhenius plots are given in Fig. S6 in the ESI.†
Regardless of the alkane feed, the Ea values determined for ZrO2-based catalysts are higher than those for the K-CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. Thus, reduced CrOx species provide another energetically more favourable pathway for alkane dehydrogenation in comparison with the sites on the surface of ZrO2-based catalysts. This is probably a reason for the lower activity of the latter catalysts at low temperatures. If we compare the Ea values for ZrO2-based catalysts, an evident effect of the kind of dopant could be identified (Table 2). For example, the Ea values for dehydrogenation of different alkanes over Y9Zr91Ox were around 10–37 kJ mol−1 lower than over bare ZrO2. The Ea values of propane and isobutane dehydrogenation over La8Zr92Ox and Sm10Zr90Ox did not significantly differ from those over ZrO2. However, the difference became obvious for n-butane dehydrogenation: the Ea values over La8Zr92Ox and Sm10Zr90Ox were about 21 and 28 kJ mol−1 lower than over ZrO2, respectively. It is also important to mention that propane dehydrogenation over Ca10Zr90Ox and Mg10Zr90Ox is characterized by the highest Ea values among all samples. These values were around 46 and 80 kJ mol−1 higher than that for ZrO2, respectively (Table 2). Thus, the kind of dopant appears to affect the intrinsic activity of catalytically active sites related to ZrO2.
3.5. Reaction scheme
For deriving insights into primary and secondary reaction pathways in the course of alkane dehydrogenation, we constructed selectivity–conversion plots as suggested in ref. 35. To this end, catalytic tests were carried out at different contact times to achieve different degrees of alkane conversion; the longer the contact time, the higher the conversion. The contact time was varied by changing both catalyst amount and total flow. Fig. 5 shows the obtained selectivity–conversion relationships in dehydrogenation of propane, isobutane, and n-butane over reduced ZrO2-based catalysts and K-CrOx/Al2O3.

In the case of propane dehydrogenation, the selectivity to propene decreases with increasing propane conversion over all samples (Fig. 5(a)). However, the strength of the decrease depends on the sample. Bare ZrO2 showed the greatest decline in propene selectivity, which fell from about 100% to 80% with an increase in propane conversion from 2% to 17%. The lowest effect of the conversion on the selectivity was determined for La8Zr92Ox, Y9Zr91Ox, and K-CrOx/Al2O3; the selectivity dropped from nearly 100% at close to zero conversion to 96% at 30% propane conversion. The selectivity to coke and cracking products (methane and ethylene) increased with increasing conversion over all catalysts (Fig. 5(b) and (c)). It is, however, worth mentioning that cracking reactions played a minor role in the course of propane dehydrogenation; the selectivity to cracking products did not exceed 2% at a propane conversion of about 30% for any of the catalysts studied. The major undesired side reaction is coke formation (Table S2 in the ESI†), which is strongly affected by catalyst composition.
For isobutane dehydrogenation, K-CrOx/Al2O3 and all promoted ZrO2-based catalysts hardly differed from each other in terms of the effect of isobutane conversion on product selectivity. The selectivity to isobutene only marginally decreased with the conversion, while the selectivity to carbon deposits and cracking products (methane and propene) increased accordingly (Fig. 5(d)–(f)). Linear butenes (n-butenes) were practically not formed (Table S3 in the ESI†). In comparison with these catalysts, the changes in product selectivity over ZrO2 with conversion were significant. The main side product was coke with the highest measured selectivity of 22% at isobutane conversion of about 20%. The corresponding selectivity to cracking products did not exceed 3%. Moreover, n-butenes were detected with the highest selectivity of about 2% at 20% conversion.
For n-butane dehydrogenation, n-butenes and 1,3-butadiene were the main gas-phase products over all catalysts (Fig. 5(g) and Table S4 in the ESI†). As a general trend, the selectivity to n-butenes decreased with increasing conversion over all ZrO2-based samples, while it remained constant (about 85%) over K-CrOx/Al2O3. The selectivity to 1,3-butadiene passed over a maximum at n-butane conversion between 5% and 10%. The selectivity to coke and cracking products monotonously increased with increasing conversion over all samples (Fig. 5(h) and (i)). Similar to propane and isobutane dehydrogenation, the strongest changes in product selectivity with n-butane conversion were observed for bare ZrO2.
3.6. Active sites, their formation and reactivity
The results shown in Fig. 4 reveal that reduced ZrO2-based samples outperformed their oxidized counterparts in terms of catalyst activity in the dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane, or isobutane. Such a positive effect can be due to the formation of additional catalytically active sites upon reductive catalyst treatment. In our previous studies, we suggested that Zrcus and neighbouring lattice oxygen (O2−) are responsible for alkane dehydrogenation.12,36 The discussion below is focused on validating this concept and deriving a mechanistic insight into the possible structure of Zrcus. We shall start with the concept.
To check if Zrcus and O2− are really required for breaking the C–H bond in alkane molecules, we performed additional propane dehydrogenation tests in the presence of probe molecules reacting with Zrcus or O2−. Such molecules were O2, H2O and CO2. The rate of propene formation obtained over different catalysts is shown in Fig. 6. It is obvious that the highest rate was obtained in the absence of such additives. The presence of only 0.5 vol% O2 in the reaction feed resulted in a significant activity drop. Water and CO2 also affected the catalyst activity negatively.
Fig. 6 The initial rate of propene formation at 550 °C over reduced ZrO2-based catalysts with different reaction feeds. □ – 40 vol% C3H8 in N2, – 40 vol% C3H8 and 0.5 vol% O2 in N2, – 40 vol% C3H8 and 10 vol% H2O in N2, and ■ – 40 vol% C3H8 and 0.5 vol% CO2 in N2.
The negative effect of gas-phase O2 can be explained as follows. O2 reacts with surface anion vacancies to form lattice oxygen according to eqn (8). As a consequence of such process, the coordination number of Zrcus located at these vacancies increases. In other words, the concentration of active Zrcus sites decreases, thus resulting in a drop in catalyst activity (Fig. 6).

A similar explanation is also valid for the negative effect of water on the rate of propene formation. The concentration of Zrcus sites decreases due to the fact that water reacts with both oxygen vacancy and neighbouring lattice oxygen, resulting in two hydroxyl groups (eqn (9)).37 Another important conclusion from the tests with water is that such Brønsted acidic sites are not relevant for propene formation.

The importance of O2− in propane dehydrogenation over ZrO2-based catalysts is proven by the fact that the rate of propene formation decreased in the presence of CO2. It is known that CO2 can react with O2− to form carbonates (eqn (10)).38 As a result, the concentration of available O2− will decrease. In addition, neighbouring Zrcus might be sterically blocked because of interaction with a C–O unit (Fig. S7 in the ESI†).38
O2− + CO2 → [O − CO2]2− (10)
To further support the importance of Zrcus sites for alkane dehydrogenation, we correlated the rates of propene, n-butenes, and isobutene formation with the number of generated oxygen vacancies determined from O2-titration experiments with reduced samples. The obtained dependence is shown in Fig. 7 and strongly suggests that the dehydrogenation activity of doped and non-doped ZrO2-based catalysts is strongly influenced by the amount of such vacancies. In agreement with the strength of the weakest C–H bond in propane, n-butane and isobutane,39 the following order for the rates of alkene formation was obtained for all samples: r(C3H6) < r(n-C4H8) < r(i-C4H8).
Fig. 7 Dependence of the rates of propene (■), n-butenes ( ), and isobutene (□) formation on the number of oxygen atoms consumed by ZrO2 (1), La8Zr92Ox (2), Y9Zr91Ox (3), and Sm10Zr90Ox (4) during titration experiments.
Summarising the above discussion, there is no doubt that active sites for propane dehydrogenation consist of Zrcus and O2−. Moreover, we suggest that certain specific Zrcus sites are required for high activity. This suggestion is supported by the results of NH3-TPD and catalytic tests. From a chemical viewpoint, the Lewis acidic sites on the surface of ZrO2 are zirconium cations. If all cations were active in propane dehydrogenation, there would be a correlation between their concentration and the rate of propene formation. However, such correlation was not established (Fig. S8 in the ESI†). This can be due to the fact that NH3-TPD tests do not discriminate between differently coordinated zirconium cations.
On the basis of the above discussion, we put forward that the degree of coordinative unsaturation of zirconium cations is an important activity-determining factor. For the cations located on flat surfaces in tetragonal or monoclinic ZrO2, their coordination number is 7 or 6. As proven by O2 pulse titration experiments, lattice oxygen is removed from ZrO2 upon reductive treatment. This means that the coordination number of such cations in the reduced catalysts is lower than the above values. We also established that the rate of propene formation over oxidized samples is enhanced by a factor of up to 3 after they had been treated in hydrogen (Fig. 4). Both experimental results suggest that the DH active Zrcus sites should possess a lower coordination number than the cations on flat surfaces, i.e. lower than 7 or 6, typical for tetragonal or monoclinic ZrO2. Such a requirement is fulfilled for the sites located at steps, kinks, or corners of the ZrO2 lattice or for non-ideal flat surfaces. The importance of the degree of unsaturation of Zrcus for alkane dehydrogenation is also supported by the fact that La8Zr92Ox, Y9Zr91Ox, and Sm10Zr90Ox in the tetragonal phase possess surface Zrcus coordinated with less than seven oxygen atoms owing to the presence of structural oxygen vacancies and show higher activity than bare ZrO2.
The dopants, however, have a different effect on the intrinsic activity of Zrcus sites as concluded from the following discussion. O2-titration experiments showed that ZrO2, La8Zr92Ox, Y9Zr91Ox, and Sm10Zr90Ox form generated oxygen vacancies after reductive treatment. The number of structural oxygen vacancies in bare ZrO2 should be several orders of magnitude lower than in the binary materials. Therefore, Ea values determined for ZrO2 can be related only to Zrcus sites located near generated oxygen vacancies. For other samples, Ea values would be determined by the intrinsic activity of both Zrcus sites located near generated oxygen vacancies and structural oxygen vacancies.
According to our data in Table 2, ZrO2, La8Zr92Ox and Sm10Zr90Ox have similar Ea values for propane and isobutane dehydrogenation. Therefore, for these catalysts, the intrinsic activity of Zrcus sites (structural and generated) in such reactions does not differ strongly. For Y9Zr91Ox, we obtained lower Ea values than for other catalysts tested. This means that the presence of Y3+ in the ZrO2 lattice improves the catalytic properties of Zrcus sites. On the contrary, Ca2+ and Mg2+ have a negative effect on Zrcus activity. The Ea values of propane dehydrogenation determined for Ca10Zr90Ox and Mg10Zr90Ox are much higher than for bare ZrO2. Since for Ca10Zr90Ox we could not see any oxygen consumption after reductive treatment (Table 1), this sample might possess only structural oxygen vacancies on the surface. The Ea value of propane dehydrogenation over such a catalyst is determined by the intrinsic activity of Zrcus sites located near such vacancies. The different effect of the dopants on the properties of Zrcus might be due to their different electronic properties and radii.40,41
3.7. Similarity and differences in dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane, and isobutane
Now we will turn our discussion to the selectivity-conversion dependencies (Fig. 5) in order to understand the role of the kind of promoter in primary and secondary transformations in the course of propane, n-butane and isobutane dehydrogenation. Nearly 100% propene selectivity can be obtained when propane conversion approaches zero. This strongly suggests that propene is the only product originating directly from propane. Since the selectivity to propene decreased with increasing conversion but selectivity to C1–C2 hydrocarbons (cracking products) and coke increased (Fig. 5(a–c)), we can conclude that these products are formed over all catalysts through consecutive transformations of propene (Fig. 8(a)). However, the catalysts differ in the rate of such transformations. The lowest rate was obtained for La8Zr92Ox, Y9Zr91Ox, and K-CrOx/Al2O3. For all these catalysts, the selectivity decreased from 100% to 96% with an increase in propane conversion from 2% to 30%, thus proving the high potential of our catalysts in terms of product selectivity. In terms of suppressing secondary transformations of propene, Sm10Zr90Ox outperformed ZrO2 but was less efficient than La8Zr92Ox, Y9Zr91Ox, and K-CrOx/Al2O3. The results in Fig. 5(a–c) also suggest that the kind of dopant for ZrO2 mainly affects catalyst ability for propene conversion into coke and to a lesser extent to cracking products. To explain this phenomenon we return to the results of NH3-TPD tests (Fig. 3, Fig. S4, and Table S1 in the ESI†). In comparison with all doped catalysts, bare ZrO2 possesses a higher concentration of strong acidic sites, which are characterized by a maximum of NH3 desorption at 415 °C. Such sites appear to favour propene adsorption, thus increasing its residence time and concentration on the surface. As a consequence, adsorbed propene molecules can interact with each other to finally yield carbon deposits.
Fig. 8 Proposed schemes of (a) propane, (b) isobutane (top scheme – for La8Zr92Ox, Y9Zr91Ox, Sm10Zr90Ox, and K-CrOx/Al2O3; bottom scheme – for ZrO2), and (c) n-butane dehydrogenation (top scheme – for ZrO2, La8Zr92Ox, Y9Zr91Ox, and Sm10Zr90Ox; bottom scheme – for K-CrOx/Al2O3). Main reactions pathways are shown by solid arrows.
In contrast to propane dehydrogenation, isobutene selectivity does not appear to reach 100% at close to zero isobutane conversion (Fig. 5(d–f)). This is due to the direct formation of carbon deposits from the alkane. A possible reason can be the high stability of the tertiary intermediate formed from isobutane after breaking the weakest C–H bond. Such an intermediate can either lose another H atom to yield the target product isobutene or react with another intermediate to form heavier hydrocarbons being coke precursors. For all doped ZrO2-based catalysts and K-CrOx/Al2O3, the selectivity to isobutene was practically independent of isobutane conversion and was never below 90% at isobutane conversions up to 40%. Thus, both dehydrogenation and side reactions (cracking and coke formation) over doped ZrO2-based catalysts and K-CrOx/Al2O3 occur in parallel (Fig. 8(b), top scheme). From a kinetic point of view, the rate of the desired reaction is significantly higher than that of the side reactions. In comparison with these catalysts, ZrO2 catalyses consecutive transformations of isobutene to coke and cracking products (Fig. 8(b), bottom scheme). In analogy to propane dehydrogenation, such different behaviour of bare ZrO2 in comparison to its promoted counterparts and K-CrOx/Al2O3 may be related to the presence of strong acidic sites, where isobutene adsorption and further oligomerization of adsorbed olefin intermediates take place.
The primary (extrapolated to zero conversion) selectivity to n-butenes (1- and 2-butenes) in n-butane dehydrogenation was only 90% (Fig. 5(g)). This value is lower than the selectivity values of 95% and 100% obtained in isobutane (Fig. 5(a)) and propane (Fig. 5(d)) dehydrogenation. 1,3-Butadiene seems to be another product formed directly from n-butane; its primary selectivity was around 10% for all catalysts (Fig. 5(g)). The main secondary side products were carbon deposits and cracking products (Fig. 5(h) and (i)). Over K-CrOx/Al2O3 all of these products are mainly formed from 1,3-butadiene (Fig. 8(c), bottom scheme). Over all ZrO2-based catalysts consecutive transformations of n-butenes are additional pathways leading to carbon deposits and cracking products (Fig. 8(c), top scheme). Similar to its behaviour in propane and isobutane DH, bare ZrO2 showed the highest rates for the latter reactions because of the presence of strong acidic sites.
4. Conclusions
We have investigated the effect of metal oxide dopant on the activity and selectivity of binary ZrO2-based catalysts in dehydrogenation of propane, n-butane and isobutane. The obtained results provide new fundamental insights into the possible structure of catalytically active sites and reaction schemes of product formation. Doping of ZrO2 with Y2O3, La2O3 and Sm2O3 was found to increase the rate of olefin formation in comparison with ZrO2, while doping with CaO, MgO or Li2O resulted in lower activity. The distinctive behaviour of the dopants was explained by their different influence on the intrinsic activity of surface coordinatively unsaturated zirconium (Zrcus) cations located at oxygen vacancies and their different ability to generate/stabilize additional Zrcus sites created upon reductive treatment. Such defect sites with the coordination number lower than for the flat surface sites seem to determine catalytic activity.
It was also shown that the promoters reduce the concentration of strong acidic sites, which are detrimental to high olefin selectivity. As a consequence, the binary catalysts outperformed ZrO2 and showed similar performance to an analogue of an industrial K-CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst in terms of selectivity to the desired olefins in a wide range of alkane conversion.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
