Well-Defined, Silica-Supported Homobimetallic Nickel Hydride Hydrogenation Catalyst
Abstract
There is an increasing interest to replace precious metal-based catalysts by earth-abundant nonprecious metals due to higher costs, toxicity, and declining availability of the former. Here, the synthesis of a well-defined supported nickel hydrogenation catalyst prepared by surface organometallic chemistry is reported. For this purpose, [LNi(μ-H)]2 (L = HC(CMeNC6H3(iPr)2)2) was grafted on partially dehydroxylated silica to give a homobimetallic H- and O(silica)-bridged Ni2 complex. The structure of the latter was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray absorption near-edge structure, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure analyses as well as hydride titration studies. The immobilized catalyst was capable of hydrogenating alkenes and alkynes at low temperatures without prior activation. As an example, ethene can be hydrogenated with an initial turnover frequency of 25.5 min–1 at room temperature.

Synopsis
A well-defined supported nickel hydrogenation catalyst is reported, which was prepared by surface organometallic chemistry from [LNi(μ-H)]2 (L = HC(CMeNC6H3(iPr)2)2). The latter was grafted on partially dehydroxylated silica to give a homobimetallic H- and O(silica)-bridged Ni2 complex. The immobilized catalyst can hydrogenate alkenes and alkynes at low temperatures without prior activation.

Hydrides are ubiquitous species in molecular chemistry, surface science, and solid-state chemistry. They are involved in many important processes like hydrogenation/dehydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, and H2 storage. (1−3) In heterogeneous catalysis, surface hydrides play an important role. While typically found at the surface of metallic nanoparticles or formed on metal oxides upon reaction with H2, (4) there are still few isolated transition-metal hydrides even when prepared via surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC), a method of choice to generate surface sites largely uniform in nature. (5) Several different strategies have emerged to prepare supported metal hydrides via SOMC (Schemes 1, S1): (1) grafting of a molecular hydride complex onto a surface, (2) hydrogenolysis of supported metal alkyls, (3) ligand exchange by an external hydride source, and (4) oxidative addition of ≡SiOH to metal complexes. (4) For early transition metals, the most widely used method is the treatment of surface metal alkyls with H2. However, this method usually leads to the formation of metal aggregates for late transition metals due to weaker interactions of late transition metals with the oxide surface. Therefore, typical synthetic strategies for the supported late transition metal hydrides via SOMC are the oxidative addition of surface-OH groups to low-valent molecular precursors, the oxidative addition of substrates such as H2 or HX to low-valent complexes grafted on an oxide surface, or grafting a molecular hydride complex possessing an additional anionic ligand. (4) One example for a reported surface-bound late transition metal hydride is the pincer-type iridium hydride surface complex [(≡SiO)IrH(POCOP)] (POCOP = 2,6-bis(di-tert-butylphosphinito)-phenyl). The grafted iridium hydride complex was reported using mesoporous silica (SBA-15) as a support (6) and was applied for the hydrogenation of ethene as well as propene at 2 bar, resulting in a turnover frequency (TOF) of 7.3 min–1 for ethene and 5.1 min–1 for propene after 30 min. Similarly, the phosphine-stabilized rhodium hydride complex [(≡SiO)Rh(PiPr3)2(H)2] grafted on silica has been reported; it readily hydrogenates cis-2-butene to butane. (7)

However, so far, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no report of supported well-defined dinuclear metal hydrides. Lately, metal hydrides based on first-row transition metals like iron, cobalt, nickel, or copper have attracted significant attention because of the desire to replace precious metals in hydrogenation processes. (8−12) While nickel is a classical hydrogenation catalyst in the form of metal nanoparticles such as Raney Ni, there is currently no report of supported well-defined nickel hydrides. Thus, we became interested in generating such species and used the dinuclear β-diketiminato nickel(II) hydride complex 1 as a molecular precursor because of its unique structure and striking reactivity. (13) We chose β-diketiminato ligands because of their ability to stabilize metal complexes in high as well as low oxidation states. (14)
In particular, compound 1 shows unusual reactivity (Scheme 2). (13) For example, at elevated temperature, it yields the metal arene complex 2 from reductive elimination of H2 in toluene solution. If no stabilizing ligand was present, the formation of elemental nickel was observed. With donor molecules like 4-dimethylaminopyridine or propionitrile, monomeric complexes are formed. Interestingly, 1 is stable to potential π-ligands, such as diphenylacetylene, at room temperature. However, at 80 °C, it transfers hydrogen onto the triple bond to give diphenylethylene as well as diphenylethane and 2, if the experiment is conducted in toluene.

Results and Discussion

Following the synthesis of 1, according to the literature procedure, (16) it was contacted as a hexane solution with silica partially dehydroxylated at 700 °C (AS700) for 12 h (Scheme 3). Subsequent washing with hexane and drying under reduced pressure yield a green material. Quantification by elemental analysis showed a Ni loading of 1.0 wt % and 1.8 N atoms as well as 24.5 C atoms per Ni. This is consistent with the presence of one β-diketiminato ligand per Ni-center at the surface species. Furthermore, quantification of the amount of H2 formed during the grafting by gas chromatography (GC) shows that one molecule of H2 is released per grafted molecule of 1. This observation indicates that one μ-H unit is retained during grafting. To probe the presence of a bridging hydride, methanol was added to a suspension of 3 in hexane. GC analysis revealed the evolution of 0.9 equiv H2 with respect to compound 3, confirming the proposed surface structure. Grafting of the corresponding nickel deuteride, which was synthesized according to the same procedure like compound 1, except using D2 instead of H2, led to the formation of HD, as analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS), confirming the acid–base reaction during grafting. Furthermore, the grafting reaction was mimicked by reacting 1 with 1 equiv of (tBuO)3SiOH. Infrared (IR) spectroscopy indicates the complete consumption of (tBuO)3SiOH, as the vibrational band associated with the silanol (ν̃ = 3380 cm–1) disappears. GC analysis revealed that 0.95 equiv of H2 was evolved, which is in agreement with the grafting reaction to obtain 3. MS analysis implies the formation of a siloxo-bridged analogue to compound 3.

Scheme 3. Synthesis of Grafted Species 3
IR spectroscopy indicates the disappearance of the vibration band associated with isolated silanols (ν̃ = 3747 cm–1) after grafting (Figure 1). The appearance of a broad and shifted band centered at 3616 cm–1 is consistent with the presence of residual silanol groups, which interact with the aromatic ligand of the grafted complex. (17,18) Residual silanols, and thereby partial coverage, can be attributed to the steric bulk of the β-diketiminato ligand. (18,19) In addition, two groups of bands appear between 2800–3100 and 1350–1600 cm–1, which can be assigned to νCH and δCH vibrations of the ligand.

To understand the coordination environment of the nickel centers on the surface, Ni K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was performed on 3. The X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) shows a pre-edge feature at 8333 eV, indicating that the geometry at the Ni centers is close to square planar, followed by an edge energy of 8339 eV (Figure S1). Such values are consistent with the presence of Ni(II). (20)
The X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectrum of 3 can be modeled by three scattering shells (Figure S2, Table 1), corresponding to Ni–N/O, Ni–Ni, and Ni–C. The first shell exhibits a coordination number N = 3, a bond length R = 1.90 Å, and a mean square relative displacement σ2 = 0.0077 Å2. Furthermore, the second shell accounts for a Ni–Ni scattering and shows N = 1, suggesting that grafting does not disrupt the dinuclear nickel core. The last shell corresponds to a Ni–C scattering with N = 4, accounting for the proximal carbon centers of the β-diketiminato ligand. As expected, the Ni–Ni distance revealed by EXAFS is elongated compared to the starting material 1 (2.394 Å), (13) which is presumably caused by the new bridging −OSi≡ ligand. In support of this conclusion, in the molecular complex [LNi(μ-OH)]2 (L = HC(CMeNC6H3(iPr)2)2), bearing two μ-oxo units, the Ni–Ni distance (2.999 Å) is also longer than in 3. (21)

C 4 2.819 ± 0.069 0.0223 ± 0.0127
The material 3 was also characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS—Figure S3). The Ni 2p spectrum shows a peak at 854.5 eV for Ni2p3/2 and at 872.3 eV for Ni 2p1/2, which is in agreement with other reported Ni(II) compounds (22) and fits well with the XANES results. Furthermore, such spectral features are also found for the starting material 1 (854.8 eV for Ni 2p3/2—Figure S4). For the N1s XPS spectrum of 3, two binding energies could be distinguished (Figure S5). The peak at 399.9 eV can be attributed to N–Ni bonding, (23) and the peak centered at 399.2 eV shows the occurrence of C–N–C groups. (24) In addition, elemental analysis by XPS showed two N atoms per Ni center, confirming the proposed structure.
Next, the reactivity of 3 was evaluated toward the hydrogenation of alkenes and alkynes (see Supporting Information for the hydrogenation of propyne). A list of other immobilized complexes on various supports for gas-phase hydrogenation of alkenes is given in Table S1. For catalytic hydrogenation reactions, 3 was introduced into an intermediate pressure nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tube, which was then filled with a 1:3 mixture of the alkene or the alkyne substrate and dihydrogen to a total pressure of 8 bar. The NMR tube was immediately placed into an NMR spectrometer to follow the consumption of the alkene/alkyne and the formation of alkane products by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The mole fraction calculated from the normalized intensities is plotted as a function of the reaction time, as shown in Figure 2. No induction period was observed, akin to the low coordinated nature of 3, indicating its competence as an active site for hydrogenation of unsaturated hydrocarbons. All substrates are hydrogenated to the corresponding alkane products, including alkynes.

We then looked at the hydrogenation of olefins in more detail. After 10 min, the conversion of ethene to ethane was already 61%, and after 1 h 86%, corresponding to a turnover number (TON) of 359 and a TOF of 6 min–1 (Table 2). Due to the high conversion even at a short time, the reaction was also carried out with a lower catalyst to substrate ratio to evaluate kinetic data in a more reliable fashion (Figure S6, left). The reaction follows a rather linear pathway for the first 2 h. After approximately 80% of ethene is converted, the rate of the reaction decreases, which is consistent with the observations of other late transition-metal hydrides. (25) Furthermore, 3 could be reused at least 10 times without any loss in activity (Figure S6, right). In contrast, no conversion was observed when the reaction was carried out with AS700 (Figure S7).

The reaction likely involves the insertion of ethene into the Ni–H bond, followed by hydrogenolysis of the Ni–C bond through the heterolytic H2 cleavage to form ethane and regenerate 3. Hydrogenation on this dinuclear Ni surface species likely takes place via opening the Ni–H–Ni bridge to coordinate and insert ethene (see Scheme S2 in Supporting Information), followed by hydrogenolysis of the resulting Ni-ethyl species with H2 (σ-bond metathesis). To probe this mechanism, selective poisoning experiments were carried out using PMe3 (data are shown in Figure S8). It is noteworthy that while no significant decrease of conversion (ca. 70% after 30 min) is observed upon adding up to 0.5 molar equiv, the conversion significantly dropped to 28% with 0.7 equiv of PMe3/Ni. The conversion further decreases to 3% with the addition of 1.0 molar equiv of PMe3/Ni. Overall, this set of data indicate that only half of the Ni sites participate in the hydrogenation reaction, supporting the proposed mechanism. XPS was performed after the hydrogenation reaction, and its results differ only marginally from the results before catalysis. The Ni 2p spectrum reveals only a Ni(II) peak at 854.1 eV for Ni 2p3/2 and 871.8 eV for Ni 2p1/2 (Figure S9), excluding the formation of metallic nickel nanoparticles during the reaction. Furthermore, 3 maintained its color during catalysis. These observations are similar to what was observed for the previously mentioned iridium hydride complex (6) and are consistent with the absence of Ni particle formation and with the fact that dinuclear Ni surface hydride is the catalytic competent species in this hydrogenation reaction. We also investigated the catalytic hydrogenation of propene; after 10 min, the conversion of propene was 30%. This is significantly slower than what is observed for ethene (61% conversion under similar reaction conditions and time). The faster hydrogenation of ethene is consistent with the usually higher reactivity of ethene. (25) After 1 h, the conversion of propene was 92%, which corresponds to a TON of ca. 380 and a TOF of 6.4 min–1.
Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Overall, we have reported the first supported nickel hydride complex by grafting the dinuclear nickel(II) hydride complex (1) onto partial dehydroxylated silica. EXAFS measurements have shown that the grafted species retains its dinuclear core structure after grafting. Alkenes as well as alkynes can be converted to the corresponding alkanes, whereupon the hydrogenation of ethene is faster than the hydrogenation of propene. Selective poisoning studies indicate that only half of the Ni sites likely participate in the hydrogenation reaction.

General Considerations
All operations regarding the organometallic precursors and the preparation of the dehydroxylated silica were performed under rigorous exclusion of moisture and air under a nitrogen atmosphere using standard Schlenk or glovebox techniques. Solvents were dried by standard methods and freshly distilled prior to use. The starting material 1 was prepared according to literature procedures. (16) AS700 was prepared by heating Evonik’s Aerosil 200—500 °C (5 °C/min), calcining in air for 4 h, evacuating to high vacuum (10–5 mbar), maintaining a temperature of 500 °C for 8 h, heating to 700 °C (5 °C/min), and maintaining the temperature for 12 h. Titration of AS700 using [Mg(CH2Ph)2(THF)2] and quantification of the released toluene indicated the presence of 0.26 mmol −OH/g corresponding to 0.8 accessible OH groups per nm2. Propyne was purchased from abcr GmbH, propene from Merck KGaA, and ethene from Air Liquide S.A. and used without further purification. Transmission FT-IR spectroscopy was carried out in a nitrogen-filled glovebox on a Thermofisher iS5 spectrometer. Elemental analysis was recorded on a Thermo FlashEA 1112 Organic Elemental Analyzer. Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis was performed on a Horiba Ultima 2. The GC measurements were carried out on an Agilent 7890. MS experiments to detect HD were performed on an InProcess Instruments GAM200. 1H NMR spectra for hydrogenation reactions with 3 were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE III 500 MHz. 1H NMR spectra for hydrogenation reactions with 1 and with silica AS700 were obtained on a Bruker AVANCE II 200 MHz. Chemical shifts (δ) are given in ppm.
XPS was measured on the K-α+ X-ray photoelectron spectrometer system (Thermo Scientific) with a hemispheric 180° dual-focus analyzer and a 128-channel detector. An X-ray monochromator is used to micro-focus Al Kα radiation. For measurement, the powder samples were mounted on conductive carbon tapes in the glovebox, and the sample holder was then transferred under vacuum into the spectrometer. The data were collected with an X-ray spot size of 400 μm, 20 scans for survey, and 50 scans for regions. Survey spectra were run in the binding energy range of 0–1000 eV. High-resolution spectra of C 1s, N 1s, and Ni 2p were obtained.
XAS was carried out at the SuperXAS beamline at the Swiss Light Source (Villigen, Switzerland), operating in top-up mode at 2.4 GeV electron energy and a current of 400 mA. The incident photon beam provided by a 2.9 T super bend magnet source was selected by a Si(111) quick-EXAFS monochromator, and the rejection of higher harmonics and focusing were achieved by a silicon- or rhodium-coated collimating mirror at 2.5 mrad. During the measurements, the monochromator was rotated with 10 Hz frequency, and X-ray absorption spectra were obtained in transmission mode using ionization chambers. Calibration of the energy was performed using a nickel foil (nickel K-edge position at 8332.8 eV). The samples were pressed in pellets with a thickness optimized for transmission mode of detection and sealed in aluminized plastic bags from Gruber-Folien GmbH & Co. KG, allowing us to measure them without exposure to air. The EXAFS data were fitted using the k range of 3–12 Å–1 and the R range of 1–3 Å.
Grafting Reaction
Silica AS700 (0.8 g, 0.26 mmol −OH) was suspended in hexane. A clear solution of 1 (100 mg, 0.10 mmol) in hexane was added dropwise, and the resulting suspension was stirred for 12 h at 25 °C. After stirring, the material was filtered, washed with hexane (5 × 5 mL), and dried under vacuum. Elemental analysis: Ni 1.0%, C 5.0%, N 0.4%, H 0.6%.
Surface Mimicking
1 (23.9 mg, 0.03 mmol) and (tBuO)3SiOH (6.6 mg, 0.03 mmol) were dissolved in hexane (10 ml) and stirred at room temperature for 14 h. After concentration of the solution and cooling to −20 °C, the product was obtained as a green powder.

Catalytic Hydrogenation of Alkenes/Alkynes
In a glovebox, catalyst 3 (2.5 mg) was placed into an intermediate pressure NMR tube, which was then filled with a 1:3 premixed mixture of the alkene/alkyne and hydrogen to a total pressure of 8 bar. The NMR tube was immediately placed into an NMR spectrometer to follow the reaction. Every spectrum was determined by recording a single scan (acquisition time 3.28 s). The composition was determined by the integration of the signals of the gas-phase 1H NMR spectra. The moles of reagents were calculated with the ideal gas law; TONs and TOFs were determined on the basis of a catalyst loading of 1% as determined by ICP-OES.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
