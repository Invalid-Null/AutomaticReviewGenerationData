Elucidating the Nature of Active Sites and Fundamentals for their Creation in Zn-Containing ZrO2–Based Catalysts for Nonoxidative Propane Dehydrogenation

Abstract
Environmentally friendly and low-cost catalysts are required for large-scale nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene (PDH) to replace currently used CrOx- or Pt-based catalysts. This work introduces ZnO-containing ZrO2- or MZrOx-supported (M = Ce, La, Ti or Y) catalysts. The most active materials outperformed the state-of-the-art catalysts with supported CrOx, GaOx, ZnOx, or VOx species as well as bulk ZrO2-based catalysts without ZnO. The space–time yield of propene of 1.25 kgC3H6·kg–1cat·h–1 at a propane conversion of about 30% with a propene selectivity of 95% was obtained over Zn(4 wt %)/TiZrOx at 550 °C. For deriving key insights into the structure of active sites, reactivity, selectivity, and on-stream stability, the catalysts were characterized by XRD, HRTEM, EDX mapping, XPS, X-ray absorption, CO-TPR, CO2-TPD, NH3-TPD, pyridine-FTIR, operando UV–vis spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, TPO, and temporal analysis of products. In contrast with previous reports that used bulk ZrO2-based catalysts without ZnO, coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations are not the main active sites in the ZnO-containing catalysts. Supported ZnOx species were concluded to participate in the PDH reaction. The current X-ray absorption analysis proved that their structure is affected by the type of metal oxide used as a dopant for ZrO2 and by the crystallinity of ZrO2. Isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ species were concluded to show high activity and on-stream stability. Their intrinsic activity is enhanced when TiO2 and ZrO2 coexist in the support or when ZrO2 is promoted by TiO2. This is probably due to accelerating hydrogen formation in the course of the PDH reaction as concluded from temporal analysis of products with sub-millisecond resolution. The results of temperature-programmed oxidation of spent catalysts as well as ex situ Raman and operando UV–vis studies enabled us to conclude that the high on-stream stability of isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ species in the PDH reaction is related to their low ability to form coke. In general, the tendency for coke formation seems to increase with an increase in the degree of ZnOx agglomeration.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propene is one of the most important raw materials in the petroleum industry. Currently, it is mainly produced through fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking, which suffer from both low propene selectivity and high energy consumption. (1,2) Moreover, these technologies cannot completely fulfill steadily increasing demand for this olefin. (3) As a consequence and owing to the exploration of shale gas containing propane, its nonoxidative dehydrogenation directly to propene draws more and more attention to close the gap between propene supply and demand. (1,4) Commercially applied catalysts are supported materials on the basis of Al2O3 with Pt or CrOx species responsible for propane dehydrogenation. (1)
Due to the high price of platinum and environmental concerns about Cr(VI) compounds, numerous groups around the world focused their research on developing alternative catalysts with differently structured (from isolated sites to nanoclusters) supported species of various metal oxides, e.g., VOx, GaOx, InOx, or SnOx. (5−14) Among such alternatives, ZnO-based catalysts should especially be mentioned owing to the low-cost and environmentally friendly nature of this metal oxide. Both isolated ZnOx species and ZnOx clusters supported on SiO2 or zeolite were reported to be active for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). (15−18) Binary ZnNbOx oxides also showed high activity and selectivity. (19)
Recently, Kondratenko and colleagues (20−22) suggested and verified a concept for designing alternative-type catalysts on the basis of ZrO2. Such materials showed industrially relevant activity and durability. Their activity and selectivity could be improved through promoting of ZrO2 with oxides of La3+ or Y3+ or through depositing tiny amounts of metallic Cu, Rh, or Ru species. (20−22) The crystallite size and the phase composition (monoclinic versus tetragonal) of bare ZrO2 are also decisive factors for catalyst activity. (23,24) According to DFT calculations, two neighboring coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) were concluded to form the active site.
A synergy effect between Zrcus and CrOx in terms of activity was established for bulk binary CrZrOx catalysts (25) and their supported counterparts. (26) Both these systems performed in a superior manner to an analogue of commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3. The ability of CrOx to promote removal of lattice oxygen from ZrO2 and to affect the intrinsic activity of Zrcus was suggested to be responsible for the synergy effect. (26) Although the amount of CrOx in these catalysts was significantly reduced in comparison with K-CrOx/Al2O3, the catalysts are still environmentally harmful.
Stimulated by the PDH performance of ZrO2-based (20,22−24,27,28) or ZnO-containing (15,17−19,29,30) catalysts and their environmental compatibility, the general purpose of our present study was to elucidate the potential application of catalysts composed of these metal oxides and to check if there is a synergy effect between ZnO and ZrO2 and/or the kind of metal (M) oxide in MZrOx. From a scientific viewpoint, we focused on (i) identifying the kind of active sites, (ii) understanding the fundamentals for their formation, and (iii) the factors affecting product selectivity including coke formation and catalyst on-stream stability. To this end, we applied complementary characterization techniques such as X-ray absorption, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, XPS, XRD, NH3-TPD, and CO-TPR. For analyzing coke formation and removal, ex situ Raman, operando UV–vis spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed oxidation of spent catalysts were used. Catalyst activity, selectivity, on-stream stability, and durability were determined under industrially relevant reaction conditions. Mechanistic and kinetic details of product formation were derived from temporal analysis of products.

Catalyst Preparation
Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (Merck, 98%), La(NO3)3·6H2O (Merck, 99%), Y(NO3)3·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9%), Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (Alfa Aesar, 99.5%), and ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 99%) were used for the synthesis of Zn-containing catalysts. ZrO2 (Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo Co), LaZrOx (9% La2O3, Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo Co), YZrOx (14% Y2O3, Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo Co), TiZrOx (30% TiO2, Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo Co), CeZrOx (17.4% CeO2, Saint-Gobain Norpro), Al2O3 (Chempur), AlSiOx (24% Al2O3, Saint-Gobain NorPro), TiSiOx (Sachtleben Chemie GmbH), R-TiO2 (rutile TiO2, Sachtleben Chemie GmbH), and SiO2 (Davisil grade 643, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as supports.
The catalysts were prepared through an impregnation method. Generally, a required amount of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was added to 8 mL of deionized water and stirred until the solution was formed. When preparing catalysts with a Zn loading of 0.5 or 0.05 wt %, an aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (0.1 g/mL) was initially prepared. An aliquot of this solution was taken for catalyst preparation. For both cases, 3 g of each support was then added to a Zn-containing solution and heated to 65 °C under continuous stirring until the suspension became a slurry. The latter was dried at room temperature overnight, further dried at 100 °C for 6 h, and finally calcined at 600 °C for 4 h. The heating ramp was 3 °C·min–1. ZrO2, LaZrOx, YZrOx, TiZrOx, and CeZrOx were also calcined according to the same procedure. The samples were denoted as yZn/ZrO2 (y = 0.05, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4), 4Zn/LaZrOx, 4Zn/YZrOx, yZn/TiZrOx (y = 0.05, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, and 20), 4Zn/CeZrOx, 4Zn/Al2O3, 4Zn/AlSiOx, 4Zn/TiSiOx, 4Zn/SiO2, where 4 or y stand for the loading of Zn, i.e., 4 wt % or y wt %. For catalysts based on the R-TiO2 support, 3 g of R-TiO2 was used and Zn loading was fixed at 2 wt % with a molar ratio of Zn/M of 1:2 (M = La, Y, Ce, or Zr). The samples were prepared according to the above-mentioned procedure. The R-TiO2 support was impregnated by a solution containing zinc and a certain promoter. They were denoted as 2Zn/R-TiO2, 2ZnLa/R-TiO2, 2ZnY/R-TiO2, 2ZnCe/R-TiO2, and 2ZnZr/R-TiO2.
General Catalyst Characterization
ASAP 2020 setup (Micromeritics, USA) was used to determine the specific surface area of the catalysts and the bare supports. Nitrogen physisorption experiments were performed at −196 °C. The BET method was applied for the desorption isotherm. The samples were pretreated under a vacuum at 250 °C for 2 h to remove adsorbed water.
Powder X-ray diffraction patterns were collected on an X’Pert Pro Theta/Theta diffractometer (Panalytical) with Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 1.5418 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA).
Transmission electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were performed on a FEI F20 field emission source electron microscope equipped with a LaB6 electron gun. The accelerating voltage was 150 kV.
X-ray absorption spectra (XANES and EXAFS) at the Zn K absorption edge were recorded at the Cat-Act beamline of the KIT synchrotron (Karlsruhe) in fluorescence mode. (31) The energy of the X-ray photons was selected by a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator, and the beam size was set by means of slits to 1 (vertical) × 1.5 (horizontal) mm2. The spectra were normalized, and the extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra (EXAFS) background was subtracted using the Athena program from the IFEFFIT software package. (32) The k2-weighted EXAFS functions were Fourier transformed (FT) in the k range of 2–11 Å–1 and multiplied by a Hanning window with a sill size of 1 Å–1. The FT EXAFS spectra were not corrected for the phase shift. In situ XANES measurements were carried out as follows. The 4Zn/TiZrOx catalyst (sieve fraction of 100–200 μm) was loaded in an in situ microreactor (quartz capillary, 1.5 mm diameter, 0.02 mm wall thickness). It was heated in a flow of 20 vol % H2 in He up to 600 °C. XANES spectra were recorded every 100 °C. Before recording the spectra, the sample was kept at each temperature for 10 min.
For fitting the EXAFS data, the amplitude reduction factor S02 = 1.0 was obtained by fitting a ZnO reference spectrum to a wurtzite structural model as reported in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), collection code 34477. The fits were performed using Artemis (32) by a least-square method in R-space between 1.0 and 3.2 Å. Coordination numbers, interatomic distances, energy shift (δE0), and mean square deviation of interatomic distances (σ2) were refined during the fitting.
To estimate the average fraction of isolated ZnOx species in the catalysts, we used the coordination number in the second shell as follows. It was assumed that the samples contained a mixture of ZnO nanoparticles (visible by XRD) and single isolated ZnOx species but no small ZnOx clusters (invisible by XRD). First, eq 1 was used to calculate the average coordination number (CN(Zn)average) of Zn in our samples from the respective EXAFS data as suggested in ref (33). As single isolated ZnOx species do not have a Zn–Zn interaction (CN(Zn) = 0), the fraction of the single sites was determined from eq 2.

where ρ is the ratio of di/R; di and R stand for distance between the shells and the radius of the nanoparticles, respectively. Twelve is the coordination number of Zn in the perfect bulk ZnO.
Ex situ XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) measurements were performed on an ESCALAB 220iXL (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with monochromatic Al Kα radiation (E = 1486.6 eV). Samples were prepared on a stainless-steel holder with conductive double-sided adhesive carbon tape. The electron binding energies were obtained with charge compensation using a flood electron source and referenced to the C 1s core level of adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV (C–C and C–H bonds).
Near-ambient pressure XPS (NAP-XPS – Specs GmbH) measurements were performed at a total pressure of 2 mbar using a monochromatic Al Kα radiation source (E = 1486.6 eV). The analysis chamber was initially filled with N2 followed by feeding the reaction mixture (40 vol % C3H8 and 5 vol % H2 in N2). The sample was mounted on a stainless-steel sample plate heated by a laser heating system to 823 K. Temperature was monitored by a thermocouple in direct contact with the sample surface. Reaction gases are monitored with a Quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS–MKS e-vision 2) attached to the lens system of the spectrometer (Phoibos 150). The electron binding energies are referenced to the C 1s core level of carbon at 284.8 eV (C–C and C–H bonds).
Temperature-Programmed Methods
To determine an overall number of acidic sites and their strength, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was carried out using an in-house-developed setup containing eight fixed-bed reactors. Each fresh catalyst sample (100 mg) was loaded into the reactor and fixed by quartz wool. It was pretreated in an air flow at 550 °C for 1 h and then reduced in a flow of 50 vol % H2/Ar. Hereafter, the catalyst was cooled down in Ar to 120 °C followed by feeding a mixture consisting of 1 vol % NH3 in Ar with a flow rate of 10 mL·min–1 for 1 h. So treated materials were purged with Ar for 2 h, then cooled down to 80 °C and kept for another 2 h in the same flow. In the last step, the catalyst was heated in Ar to 900 °C with a ramp of 10 °C·min–1. NH (atomic mass unit of 15) and Ar (atomic mass unit of 40) signals were recorded by an online mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320).
Overall basicity of the bare supports and the catalyst with 4 wt % Zn was determined by temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 using the same setup as for NH3-TPD measurements. A total of 100 mg of each fresh sample was used. The samples were heated to 550 °C in Ar, reduced at the same temperature in a flow of 50 vol % H2 in Ar for 1 h and cooled down to 120 °C in Ar. Then, they were exposed to a flow of 5 vol % CO2 in Ar for 1 h. After purging with a flow of Ar for 200 min, the samples were cooled to 30 °C and heated to 700 °C in Ar with ramp of 10 °C·min–1. CO2 desorption was measured with the mass spectrometer at atomic mass units of 44 (CO2) and 40 (Ar reference).
Carbon monoxide temperature-programmed reduction (CO-TPR) tests were performed using the same setup as used for NH3-TPD measurements. A total of 100 mg of fresh catalyst was pretreated in an air flow at 550 °C for 1 h and cooled down to 40 °C in the same atmosphere. After a purging step with Ar for 15 min, 1 vol % of CO in Ar (10 mL·min–1) was fed to the reactor. The catalyst was heated to 900 °C with a ramp of 10 °C·min–1. H2 (atomic mass unit of 2), CO (atomic mass unit of 28), CO2 (atomic mass unit of 44 and 28), and Ar (atomic mass unit of 40) signals were recorded.
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) measurements using the setup for NH3-TPD measurements were carried out by heating spent catalysts (collected after time-on-stream stability tests with oxidized samples as described in section Catalytic Tests) in a flow of 5 vol % O2 in an Ar mixture with a ramp of 10 °C·min–1. A total of 50 mg of spent sample was used. CO2 (atomic mass unit of 44) and Ar (atomic mass unit of 40) signals were recorded.
Optical Spectroscopy Measurements
To distinguish between Lewis and Brønsted acidic sites, IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine were recorded. The measurements were carried out in transmission mode on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer equipped with a homemade reactor cell with CaF2 windows connected to a gas-dosing and evacuation system. Each catalyst sample was pressed into a self-supporting wafer with a diameter of 20 mm and a weight of 50 mg. Before pyridine adsorption, the catalyst was heated under a vacuum up to 400 °C and then tempered for 10 min. After cooling to room temperature under a vacuum, pyridine was adsorbed at room temperature until saturation. Then, the reactor cell was evacuated for removing physisorbed pyridine. The spectra were collected at 150 °C. Generally, subtracted spectra were evaluated. They were obtained upon subtraction of the spectrum measured after pretreatment, i.e., before pyridine adsorption, from the respective pyridine adsorbate spectra.
Raman spectra were collected on a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope using a 633 nm laser with a laser power of 0.161 mW. The spent samples (collected after time-on-stream stability tests with oxidized samples as described in section Catalytic Tests) were mounted onto object slides, and an objective with a magnification of 50× was applied. To obtain a representative spectrum from a potentially inhomogeneous sample, the spectra were acquired at different points of the sample. The ID/IG ratio, i.e., the intensity ratio of Raman bands characteristic of disordered coke and graphic coke, respectively, was obtained from an average of 10 spectra collected at different positions of the sample.
Operando UV–vis spectra were collected using an Avantes spectrometer, which consists of a temperature-resistant UV–vis probe, a deuterium-halogen light source, and a CCD array detector, combined with an in-house built setup containing five continuous fixed-bed reactors. BaSO4 was used as a white reference. The catalysts were activated in the air at 550 °C for 1 h and exposed to a mixture of C3H8, H2, and N2 (C3H8/H2/N2 = 8:1:11) at the same temperature for 1 h. Afterward, they were exposed to air for 30 min to remove coke, reduced in a flow of 50 vol % H2/N2 mixture, exposed to the C3H8/H2/N2 = 8:1:11 mixture for another 1 h, and then exposed to air to remove coke. Spectra for each stage were collected. The catalyst amount and the reaction gas flow were 150–270 mg and 15 mL·min–1, respectively, to reach a similar initial propane conversion of 30%. For analysis of coke formation, a relative reflectance (Rrel) was defined as the ratio of the reflectance of catalysts with reaction-induced carbon deposits (RDH) to that of oxidized or reduced ones (RO2 or RH2) according to eq 3. The relative Kubelka–Munk function (F(Rrel)) was calculated by eq 4.

Temporal Analysis of Products
H/D exchange and C3H8 dehydrogenation tests were carried out in the temporal analysis of products (TAP-2) reactor. It is a pulse technique with a time resolution of approximately 100 μs. (34,35) A fresh catalyst (4Zn/ZrO2 or 4Zn/TiZrOx) sample (41 mg, fraction of 315–710 μm) was packed between two layers of quartz particles (fraction of 250–355 μm) in the isothermal zone of a homemade quartz reactor (inner diameter, 6 mm; length, 40 mm). Prior to the experiments, each catalyst was treated as follows. First, it was heated up to 550 °C in N2 flow (4 mL·min–1), then oxidized in a mixture of O2 (2 mL·min–1) and N2 (4 mL·min–1) for 1 h. Hereafter, the reactor was flushed in N2 flow (4 mL·min–1) for 15 min followed by feeding a flow of 50 vol % H2 in N2 (4 mL·min–1) for 1 h and flushing again in N2 flow (4 mL·min–1) for 15 min. Finally, the reactor was evacuated to ca. 10–5 Pa. Hereafter, pulse experiments with D2/Ar = 1:1 or C3H8/Ar = 1:1 were performed at 550 °C.
The feed mixtures were prepared using D2 (CK Special Gases Limited, N2.8), C3H8 (Linde, 3.5), and Ar (Air Liquide, 5.0) without additional purification. The pulse size was up to 8 × 1015 or 8 × 1016 molecules per pulse in the tests with D2 or C3H8, respectively. The feed components and the reaction products were quantitatively analyzed using an online quadrupole mass spectrometer (HAL RC 301, Hiden Analytics). The following AMUs (atomic mass units) were used for mass spectrometric analysis: 44.0 (C3H8), 42.0 (C3H8, C3H6), 41.0 (C3H8, C3H6), 30.0 (C3H8, C2H6), 29.0 (C3H8, C2H6), 28.0 (C3H8, C2H6, C2H4), 27,0 (C3H8, C3H6), 16.0 (CH4), 4.0 (D2), 3.0 (HD), 2.0 (H2), and 40.0 (Ar). For each AMU, the pulses were repeated 10 times and averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The fraction of formed HD was calculated from the areas of signals recorded at the respective AMUs. For better comparison of the relative response position of substances differing in their molecular weights like C3H8 and H2, the data were transformed to dimensionless form according to Gleaves et al. (36)
Catalytic Continuous-Flow Tests
The propene formation rate (r(C3H6)) calculated according to eq 5 was determined after 240 s on stream at a propane conversion below 10% at 550 °C. A total of 50 mg of catalyst (particle size is 315–710 μm) was loaded into a fixed-bed quartz tubular reactor, activated in the air at 550 °C for 1 h and then reduced in a 50 vol % H2/N2 mixture at the same temperature for 1 h. Finally, the reactor was flushed with N2 for 15 min and exposed to a mixture of C3H8 and N2 (C3H8/N2 = 2:3) at a weight hourly space velocity with respect to propane (WHSV(C3H8)) of 34.5 h–1. Zn-related turnover frequency (TOF) values were calculated according to eq 6.

To compare the catalysts with respect to their time-on-stream stability, different catalyst amounts (150–270 mg, particle size is 315–710 μm) were used to achieve an initial propane conversion of around 30%. After the catalysts were pretreated in air or 50 vol % H2 in N2 at 550 °C for 1 h, they were flushed with N2 and exposed to a mixture of C3H8, H2, and N2 (C3H8/H2/N2 = 8:1:11, 15 mL·min–1) at the same temperature for 1 h.
Durability of 4Zn/TiZrOx was determined in 10 PDH/regeneration cycles with a WHSV(C3H8) of 4.71 h–1 at 550 °C. Each cycle contained a PDH stage that lasted for 28 min and a regeneration stage in air that lasted for 30 min. The catalyst amount was 150 mg, and the reaction mixture was C3H8/H2/N2 = 8:1:11.
Propane conversion (X(C3H8)) and the selectivity to gas-phase products (S(i)) and coke (S(coke)) were calculated according to eqs 7–9, respectively. Space–time yield of propene (STY, kgC3H6·kg–1cat·h–1) was calculated according to eq 10. All the feed components and products were analyzed using an online GC (Agilent 6890) equipped with FID and TCD detectors.

Results and Discussion

Phase Composition and Morphology
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed to identify the phase composition of the bare supports and the catalysts with a Zn loading of 4 wt %. The corresponding XRD patterns are shown in Figure S1 and Figure 1a. As seen in the former figure, bare ZrO2 is composed of the monoclinic phase, while the tetragonal phase was identified in LaZrOx, YZrOx, and CeZrOx. No La2O3, Y2O3 or CeO2 phases were observed in these materials due to the formation of solid solution. This statement is supported by the fact that the tetragonal ZrO2 phase is present in LaZrOx, YZrOx, and CeZrOx as a result of the well-known stabilizing effect of a metal oxide dopant on the structure of ZrO2. (37) No reflections characteristic for crystalline ZrO2 could be found in the XRD pattern of noncalcined TiZrOx (Figure S1a). The TiO2 anatase phase (A-TiO2) characterized by a reflection at 2θ of 25.3° was the only crystalline phase in this sample. After calcination of TiZrOx, three separate crystalline phases were identified, i.e., the TiO2 anatase as well as the monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 phases (Figure S1b). This result proves that the calcination process did not result in the formation of a homogeneous solid solution of the type TixZr1–xO2. The reason for phase separation may be too high content of TiO2 (30 wt %).

The phase composition of ZrO2 in all supports except in TiZrOx did not change after deposition of ZnO (Figure 1a). Amorphous ZrO2 in the TiZrOx material was transformed into the tetragonal ZrO2 phase. Such transformation can be explained by high-temperature (600 °C) catalyst precursor pretreatment and/or stabilizing effect of ZnO. As concluded from the below EXAFS data (see Local Coordination Environment of Zn Species), Zn should be localized on the surface and not distributed within the lattice of ZrO2.
No reflections characteristic for any phase of ZnO could be identified in 4Zn/TiZrOx. In contrast with this catalyst, low-intensity reflections at 2θ of 36.3°, which are typical for the hexagonal ZnO, were determined in the XRD patterns of all other catalysts. Thus, the presence of Ti in ZrO2 or the amorphous nature of the latter in the bare TiZrOx support might be important for suppressing formation of ZnO crystallites after catalyst calcination.
The morphology of all catalysts was analyzed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Representative HRTEM images are shown in Figure 1b–f and Figure S2. One can see that all the catalysts consist of irregular small crystals (clear lattice of crystalline ZrO2 for each catalyst could be seen in Figure S2) in a disordered arrangement, which leads to the formation of mesopores among them. As proven by energy dispersive X-ray element mapping (Figure S3), no ZnO aggregates could be observed in 4Zn/TiZrOx, which is in agreement with the XRD data (Figure 1a).
Local Coordination Environment of Zn Species
Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) is one of the most powerful techniques for characterizing the oxidation state and local structure of Zn species. (38) The Zn K-edge XANES of as-prepared Zn-containing catalysts, Zn foil, and ZnO powder are presented in Figure S4 and S5a, while their Fourier-transformed k2-weighted EXAFS (FT EXAFS) counterparts are given in Figures 2 and S5b.

Figure 2. Fourier-transformed Zn K-edge EXAFS spectra of Zn in ZrO2-based supports, Zn foil, and ZnO powder references.
Regardless of the catalyst analyzed, Zn2+ is the only state of zinc as concluded from the shape and the position of the absorption edge in the XANES spectra. The spectra are similar to that of the ZnO reference (Figure S4). No signal related to metallic Zn could be identified in the FT EXAFS spectra of all samples (no signal at an uncorrected distance of approximately 2.2 Å characteristic of metallic Zn–Zn interaction). However, the catalysts differ in the average coordination numbers in the second shell (Zn–Zn coordination as in ZnO). As seen in Figure 2, only backscattering on oxygen atoms in the first shell (uncorrected distance approximately 1.5 Å) can be observed for Zn2+ species in 4Zn/TiZrOx and no scattering at higher distances. On this basis, we can safely conclude that zinc is present in this sample in the form of isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ sites (Table 1). For all other catalysts, there, however, exists ordering at higher distances. It indicates the presence of ZnO aggregates (Table 1). The results are consistent with the XRD data (Figure 1a). The local structure of Zn species in terms of average coordination number (CN) with respect to O and Zn as well as the distance to O and Zn nearest neighbors was obtained through fitting the EXAFS data. The refined parameters are summarized in Table 1.

aFraction of single Zn2+ sites.
From a CN of Zn in the second shell (at approximately 3.23 Å), the fraction of isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ sites among total ZnO species was determined for each catalyst (see eqs 1 and 2). As can be seen in Table 1, 4Zn/TiZrOx possesses exclusively isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ sites. Contrarily, both the isolated species and ZnO agglomerates are present in other catalysts. A relative fraction of isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ sites amounted to 58, 38, 48, and 70% in 4Zn/ZrO2, 4Zn/LaZrOx, 4Zn/YZrOx, and 4Zn/CeZrOx, respectively. In comparison with 4Zn/TiZrOx, such a fraction in 10Zn/TiZrOx and 20Zn/TiZrOx is less than 100% and decreases with Zn loading (Table 1).
When considering the phase composition of bare supports (Figure S1), we put forward that isolation of Zn2+ upon catalyst preparation is favored when ZrO2 is X-ray amorphous. It could not be excluded that A-TiO2 coexisting in the TiZrOx support may also help for dispersing ZnO. Isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ sites could be formed upon high-temperature calcination, promoting insertion of Zn2+ cations into the position of the Zr4+ cation in the lattice of ZrO2. (39) They should, however, be located on the surface as the coordination number of the Zn–O first-shell is around 2.6. Thus, one single Zn2+ site is linked to three O atoms at a distance of about 1.99 Å. If Zn2+ species were in the bulk of tetragonal ZrO2, it would be coordinated by seven O atoms.
Oxidation State of Surface Cations and Charge Transfer
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out to determine the oxidation state of Zn and Zr cations and to investigate if and how the presence of ZnO affects electron interactions. Zn-containing catalysts, bare ZrO2-based supports, and ZnO were analyzed. The XP spectra related to zirconium, zinc, and oxygen are shown in Figure 3a, Figure 3b, and Figure S6, respectively. We start our discussion with the spectra of zirconium in bare supports (solid lines in Figure 3a).
Figure 3
Figure 3. XP spectra of (a) Zr 3d (solid lines for bare MZrOx and dashed lines for Zn-containing samples) and (b) Zn 2p in as-prepared catalysts.
As seen in the XP spectra of zirconium in Figure 3a, all samples exhibit a spin–orbit doublet of the Zr 3d core level into Zr 3d5/2 and Zr 3d3/2 with a BE (binding energy) of about 182.3 eV and a splitting of 2.4 eV. Thus, the oxidation state of Zr should be +4. (40,41) Furthermore, the BE value of Zr 3d is influenced by the kind of metal dopant present in the bare ZrO2-based supports. For ZrO2, LaZrOx, and YZrOx, the BE value of Zr 3d5/2 is about 182.3 eV. It lowers to 182.1 and 182.0 eV for TiZrOx and CeZrOx materials, respectively. The shift is an indication of the presence of oxygen vacancies, where electron density is mainly located. The density is also distributed to a lesser extent between the neighboring Zr4+ cations. (23) Such electron density distribution results in the shift of the BE value of Zr 3d5/2 to lower values in comparison with bare ZrO2.
It is worth mentioning that after the addition of zinc, the BE value of Zr 3d5/2 shifted to slightly higher values at around 182.15 eV (except for bare ZrO2) in comparison with the bare support, while the BE values of Ti 2p and Ce 3d and, to a minor extent, of La 3d and Y 3d shifted to lower values (Figure S7). The observed higher binding energies of Zr 3d5/2 may be related to hindering the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen in the presence of ZnO as proven by CO-TPR tests (see Redox Properties, Table 2). In general, the above shifts in the BE values of all metals prove that there is an interaction between zinc, zirconium, and the dopant cations. On the basis of previous studies with ZnZrOx materials, (42) the present XPS data suggest that Zn–O–Zr and/or Zn–O–M (M = La, Y, Ti, and Ce) structures could be formed in our Zn/MZrOx materials. This statement is further supported by the following discussion of XPS results related to zinc.

aDetermined by ICP
The XP spectra of Zn 2p are shown in Figure 3b. The BE values of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 in pure ZnO are at 1021.0 and 1044.1 eV, respectively (Figure 3b, bottom graph). The spin–orbit splitting of the Zn 2p peaks is 23.1 eV for all catalysts, which is characteristic for ZnO. (43) This is in agreement with the XANES results, and we can conclude that the oxidation state of Zn is +2. Importantly, for all the Zn/MZrOx catalysts, the Zn 2p BE is shifted by 1 eV (4Zn/ZrO2 and 4Zn/TiZrOx) up to 4 eV (4Zn/CeZrOx) to higher values in comparison with pure ZnO. Such behavior might suggest that Zn2+ became more electron deficient, i.e., electron density is transferred from Zn2+ to neighboring O2–. This statement is further supported by the XP spectra of O 1s (especially in the case of CeZrOx) shown in Figure S6. The BE value of O 1s shifted toward lower values after introducing Zn. In addition, differential charging effects cannot be excluded and might influence the observed binding energies.
Acid–Base Properties
Overall catalyst acidity was determined by NH3-TPD tests, while FTIR spectroscopic analysis of adsorbed pyridine was used for distinguishing between Lewis and Brønsted sites. We shall start our discussion with the NH3-TPD data. The NH3-TPD experiments were carried out over reduced samples (see Temperature-programmed Methods). The obtained NH3-TPD profiles are shown in Figure S8a. Using simple mathematical deconvolution of these profiles with Gaussian functions, three different kinds of acidic sites could be identified (Figure S9). They are characterized by the maxima of NH3 desorption at temperatures of 240–270, 280–320, and 350–395 °C, which can be ascribed to weak, medium, and strong acidic sites, respectively. Using the BET values and the amount of ammonia desorbed, we calculated an overall density of acidic sites and the density of weak, medium, and strong acidic sites, which are shown in Table 2 and Table S1. One NH3 molecule was suggested to adsorb on one acidic site. Bare ZrO2 possesses the highest density of acidic sites of 0.89 μmol(NH3)·m–2.
The density decreases after promoting ZrO2 with different metal oxides. The lowest acidic density of 0.40 μmol(NH3)·m–2 was determined for LaZrOx. In addition, the metal oxide promoter with the exception of CeO2 causes a reduction of the concentration of strong and medium acidic sites (Table S1). For example, after doping with La2O3, the density of weak acidic sites is only 0.04 μmol(NH3)·m–2 lower than the corresponding value obtained for pure ZrO2, while that of medium and strong acidic sites is 0.09 and 0.35 μmol(NH3)·m–2 lower, respectively. This result is consistent with our previous study. (21)
The NH3-TPD profiles of the Zn-containing catalysts can also be deconvoluted into weak, medium, or strong acidic sites, which are identified by the maximal temperature of NH3 desorption at 200–225, 250–280, or 335–375 °C (Figure S9b). Compared with the bare MZrOx materials, the strength of acidic sites became weaker. However, the density of acidic sites increased significantly except for CeZrOx, where it remained unchanged after loading 4 wt % Zn (Table S1). The increased density of acidic sites could probably be assigned to surface Zn2+ species and/or newly formed unsaturated Zr4+ cations due to the incorporation of Zn2+ into the lattice of ZrO2. 4Zn/TiZrOx possesses the highest acidic sites density of 1.39 μmol(NH3)·m–2, which is about 2 times that of TiZrOx. The lowest density of 0.71 μmol(NH3)·m–2 was determined for 4Zn/CeZrOx and is close to that of bare CeZrOx.
The type (Lewis or Brønsted) of acidic sites was determined by FTIR measurements of adsorbed pyridine at 150 °C. The obtained spectra are shown in Figure 4. No Brønsted acidic sites could be identified in all the samples as concluded from the absence of a characteristic absorption band at around 1540 cm–1. (44) For the bare supports, well-resolved bands in the region of 1442 to 1445 cm–1, 1573 to 1577 cm–1, and 1600 to 1606 cm–1 could be ascribed to pyridine bound to Lewis acidic sites. (44,45) These sites should be coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ (Zrcus) centers and/or Ti4+ (Ticus) in the TiZrOx support. The different band positions among these supports could be due to the different strength of Lewis acidic sites as a result of electronic interactions between Zr cations and dopants (La, Y, Ti, and Ce; see Oxidation State of Surface Cations and Charge Transfer). (46)
Figure 4
Figure 4. FTIR spectra of adsorbed pyridine over bare ZrO2-based supports (solid lines) and Zn-containing catalysts (dash lines) at 150 °C.
After deposition of ZnO species onto the supports, the above-mentioned bands shifted toward higher wavenumbers or shoulders appeared at relatively higher wavenumbers. This is due to the generation of new stronger Lewis sites or increasing strength of Zrcus acidic sites. The latter assumption is indirectly supported by the fact that, according to our XPS analysis, the BE value of Zr 3d5/2 shifted to higher values after depositing ZnO (Figure 3a). Such a shift indicates a decrease in the electronic density at Zr4+. For 4Zn/CeZrOx, although the density of overall acidic sites determined by means of NH3-TPD tests remained unchanged after depositing ZnO, the intensity of bands related to adsorbed pyridine decreased in comparison with bare CeZrOx. This may be due to its weak acidity (Figure S8a) and the weaker basicity of pyridine than molecular NH3. Thus, a part of adsorbed pyridine could desorb upon catalyst evacuation before the FTIR measurements. (47)
Surface basicity of the reduced catalysts was investigated by CO2-TPD measurements. The obtained CO2-TPD profiles are shown in Figure S10b. For bare supports, the profiles are characterized by CO2 desorption with maxima at 180–215, 225–280, and 315–350 °C (Figure S10a). Thus, basic sites of different strengths coexist on the surface of the supports. Deconvolution of these profiles is shown in Figure S10, and the obtained fractions of each basic site are given in Table S2. From a quantitative viewpoint, the lowest density of basic sites of about 0.05 μmol(CO2)·m–2 was obtained for TiZrOx. ZrO2, LaZrOx, and YZrOx possess a significantly higher concentration of basic sites, which is about 0.85 μmol(CO2)·m–2. A slightly lower density of 0.71 μmol(CO2)·m–2 was determined for CeZrOx. The dopant for ZrO2 also influences the strength of basic sites. In comparison with bare ZrO2, the strength increased upon introducing La2O3, Y2O3, or CeO2 but decreases when TiO2 is used as a dopant (Table S2).
For all Zn-containing catalysts, weak, medium, and strong basic sites could also be identified with Tmax-CO2 at 195–210, 250–270, and 330–360 °C, respectively. After deposing ZnO, the overall density of basic sites increased for the catalysts based on ZrO2, LaZrOx, and CeZrOx but decreased for YZrOx or remained almost unchanged for TiZrOx. Adding ZnO mainly affected the density of weak basic sites; e.g., for ZrO2, it increased from 0.11 to 0.30 μmol(CO2)·m–2. The strength of basic sites changed after deposition of ZnO. It decreased for 4Zn/LaZrOx but increased for all other catalysts.
Redox Properties
From our previous ZrO2-based studies, it is known that Zrcus are the active sites for PDH. (20,23,24) Therefore, the reducibility of ZrO2 in differently structured bare ZrO2, Ru/YZrOx, or Ru/LaZrOx was concluded to be of vital importance for the rate of propene formation. (22,24,27) We also checked if this catalyst property plays a role for the present Zn-containing catalysts. To this end, CO-TPR tests were carried out. In contrast to typically used H2 for TPR measurements, CO can not only react with lattice oxygen but also remove surface hydroxyl groups producing H2 through a water–gas shift reaction. (48) The CO-TPR profiles obtained upon reduction of bare supports and catalysts preoxidized in air at 550 °C for 1 h are shown in Figure 5. A CO consumption peak without CO2 formation (Figure S11a) between 320 and 365 °C is identified for ZrO2, LaZrOx, and YZrOx and could be due to CO chemisorption leading to the formation of formate, carbonate, or carboxylate-type species. (49) A broad peak at higher temperatures could be assigned to the reaction of CO with surface hydroxyls and/or lattice oxygen, resulting in the formation of CO2 and H2. The amount of CO consumed by ZrO2, YZrOx, and LaZrOx was about 80 μmol(CO)·g–1 (Table 2). As CO consumption and H2 formation occurred at almost the same temperature (Figure 5 and Figure S11b), it can be suggested that CO mainly reacted with surface hydroxyls. (50)
Figure 5
Figure 5. CO-TPR profiles of ZrO2-based supports (solid lines) and Zn-containing catalysts (dash lines).
In comparison with ZrO2, YZrOx, and LaZrOx, no irreversible CO adsorption (CO consumption without formation of gas-phase products) was observed for TiZrOx. CO consumption through reaction with lattice oxygen or hydroxyl groups was also very low, i.e., only 25.0 μmol(CO)·g–1. CeZrOx exhibited the highest reducibility of 291.9 μmol(CO)·g–1 among the bare supports. This amount is about 3 times higher than that consumed by ZrO2. In addition, H2 formation (Figure S11b) had a maximum at 412 °C, while the maximum of CO consumption is at about 543 °C (Figure 5). Thus, the reduction process of CeZrOx could be divided into two parts; the first step is the removal of surface hydroxyls followed by the reaction of bulk lattice oxygen. (51)
When ZnO (4 wt %) was deposited on the surface of MZrOx, overall catalyst redox properties changed significantly. One obvious difference seen in Figure 5 and Figure S11 is the fact that no irreversible CO adsorption could be observed for 4Zn/ZrO2, 4Zn/LaZrOx, and 4Zn/YZrOx. Moreover, CO consumption due to its oxidation over these samples moved toward lower temperatures with Tmax values ranging from 365 to 395 °C. As previously reported by Bianchi et al., (52) the reactivity of hydroxyl groups for their reaction with CO on ZnO/ZrO2 is higher than that on ZrO2. The generated formates are less stable on the former material. Their fast decomposition on Zn-containing samples could be a reason why no irreversible CO adsorption chemisorption was observed, and CO2 formation shifts to lower temperatures in comparison with ZnO-free materials. For comparative purposes, we also carried out CO-TPR tests with bare ZnO. The obtained profiles are shown in Figure S12. The intensity of the CO signal decreased continuously at temperatures higher than 705 °C due to a complete reduction of ZnO to metallic Zn. Thus, the amount of CO consumed by Zn-containing catalysts was calculated by integrating the CO-TPR profiles up to 700 °C and is given in Table 2. In comparison with 4Zn/ZrO2, 4Zn/LaZrOx, and 4Zn/YZrOx, redox properties of TiZrOx did not significantly change after ZnO deposition. The amount of CO consumed by 4Zn/TiZrOx was 21.0 μmol(CO)·g–1 and only slightly lower than 25.0 μmol(CO)·g–1 for TiZrOx. For other Zn-containing catalysts, this amount was about half of that consumed by the corresponding supports.
It is worth noting that the amount of H2 produced during CO-TPR tests (Figure S11b) becomes much higher after introducing ZnO. In the case of bulk ZnO, surface hydroxyl groups also contribute to irreversible CO adsorption (Figure S12). In other words, the surface hydroxyls become more abundant and the removal of bulk oxygen is inhibited by introducing ZnO.
Catalyst Activity, Selectivity, and On-Stream Stability
The rate of propene formation (r(C3H6)) over bare supports and the corresponding Zn-containing catalysts is shown in Figure 6a. Among all the supports, ZrO2 and YZrOx revealed the highest activity with r(C3H6) of about 0.35 mmol·g–1·min–1, while TiZrOx was the least active. These results are consistent with our previous work, where we showed that yttrium is an activity-enhancing dopant for ZrO2, while cerium and titanium had a negative effect. (20)
Figure 6
Figure 6. (a) Propene formation rate over calcined ZrO2-based supports (black bars) and corresponding Zn-containing catalysts (red bars) and (b) comparison of STY with other works published. The gray dashed line in (a) stands for the activity of a commercial-like K-CrOx/Al2O3 from ref (25). For the r(C3H6) test, reaction conditions: T = 550 °C, catalyst amount = 50 mg, C3H8/N2 = 2:3, WHSV(C3H8) = 34.5 h–1; the catalysts were reduced in a flow of 50 vol % H2 in N2 for 1 h at 550 °C before reaction. For benchmarking, reaction conditions: T = 550 °C, catalyst amount = 150 mg, C3H8/H2/N2 = 8:1:11, WHSV(C3H8) = 4.71 h–1; the catalyst was initially activated in air for 1 h at 550 °C. Propane conversion and propene selectivity values were 30 and 95%, respectively.
The rate increased significantly after depositing ZnO on the supports (Figure 6a). The strength of the positive effect of zinc strongly depended on the kind of support. The highest improvement was achieved in the case of 4Zn/TiZrOx. The rate over this catalyst was about 1.09 mmol·g–1·min–1 and, thus, approximately 18 times higher than that over bare TiZrOx. 4Zn/TiZrOx showed the highest activity among all the catalysts tested, while 4Zn/CeZrOx was the least active. Nevertheless, for the latter catalyst, the second highest rate enhancement by the addition of ZnO was established (Figure S13). In general, the catalysts can be ordered in terms of the improvement of their activity through ZnO as follows: 4Zn/TiZrOx > 4Zn/CeZrOx > 4Zn/LaZrOx > 4Zn/YZrOx > 4Zn/ZrO2. Mechanistic insights into the nature of active sites and the effects of a metal oxide promoter for ZrO2 and the structure of ZrO2 will be discussed in the section Nature of Active Site.
To benchmark our catalysts in terms of propene productivity, we determined space-time-yield (STY) of propene formation over the best performing 4Zn/TiZrOx catalyst at 550 °C at a propane conversion of about 30% using an industrially relevant reaction feed with 40 vol % propane and 5 vol % hydrogen in nitrogen. H2 was cofed to mimic reaction conditions typical for Pt-based catalysts. It has, however, a negative effect on propane conversion due to the reversibility of the PDH reaction but may help to reduce coke formation. The selectivity to propene under this condition was about 95%. The obtained STY value was 1.25 kgC3H6·kgCat–1·h–1 and is compared in Figure 6b with the values reported in the literature for catalysts containing supported CrOx, GaOx, ZnOx, or VOx species. (10,13,15,17,53−60) One can clearly see that our 4Zn/TiZrOx catalyst outperformed such materials. All previously tested Zn-containing catalysts with even higher ZnO loading were less active than 4Zn/TiZrOx.
To check if and how the kind of support affects time-on-stream stability and selectivity to propene, we carried out a test lasting for 1 h on the propane stream with the 4Zn/MZrOx catalysts. For their fair comparison, an individual contact time was adjusted for each catalyst to achieve the initial propane conversion of about 30%. Figure 7 shows time-on-stream profiles of propane conversion and propene selectivity.
Figure 7
Figure 7. Catalytic performance during 1 h the propane stream over (a) oxidized and (b) reduced catalysts. Reaction conditions: T = 550 °C, catalyst amount = 150–270 mg, C3H8/H2/N2 = 8:1:11, WHSV(C3H8) = 3.21, 3.72, 4.71, 4.71, and 2.62 h–1 for 4Zn/ZrO2 (black), 4Zn/LaZrOx (red), 4Zn/YZrOx (blue), 4Zn/TiZrOx (pink), and 4Zn/CeZrOx (green), respectively. For oxidized catalysts, they were activated in air at 550 °C for 1 h. For reduced catalysts, they were pretreated in 50 vol % H2 in N2 at 550 °C for 1 h after activation in air.
Regardless of the catalyst pretreatment (reductive or oxidative), 4Zn/TiZrOx revealed the highest stability and the highest selectivity to propene. For example, the conversion over oxidized or reduced 4Zn/TiZrOx decreased from 29% to 17% (Figure 7a) or from 29% to 16% (Figure 7b) within 1 h on the propane stream. The selectivity to propene was about 95%. The fastest deactivation and the lowest selectivity to propene were determined for 4Zn/ZrO2. Propane conversion decreased from 26% to 3% during 1 h on the propane stream. The initial selectivity to propene was about 85%. One should mention that propane conversion over oxidized 4Zn/CeZrOx passed through a maximum after 12 min on the propane stream, while such a phenomenon was not observed for reduced 4Zn/CeZrOx. This could be due to the formation of new active sites by in situ reduction of the oxidized catalyst by propane. (61)
The durability of 4Zn/TiZrOx was investigated in a separate test comprising of 10 PDH/oxidative regeneration cycles at 550 °C. Each cycle consisted of a PDH stage that lasted for 28 min and a regeneration stage that lasted for 30 min. For comparative purposes, we also used catalytic data obtained over a reference ZrO2-based material (Ru(0.005 wt %)/YZrOx) investigated in our previous work. (22) Importantly, although the present catalyst was tested in the presence of H2 (negative effect of H2 on propane conversion) and at about a 3 times higher WHSV(C3H8) (4.71 h–1 vs 1.57 h–1), it showed a similar initial conversion in comparison with Ru(0.005 wt %)/YZrOx (Figure 8). The selectivity to propene over 4Zn/TiZrOx was about 8% higher than that over Ru(0.005 wt %)/YZrOx at a close initial degree of propane conversion.
Figure 8
Figure 8. Propane conversion and the selectivity to propene over oxidized 4Zn/TiZrOx (red) and Ru(0.005 wt %)/YZrOx (black) in 10 PDH/regeneration cycles. The data for the latter catalyst are from our previous study. (22) Reaction conditions for 4Zn/TiZrOx: T = 550 °C, catalyst amount = 150 mg, C3H8:H2:N2 = 8:1:11, WHSV(C3H8) = 4.71 h–1. Reaction conditions for Ru(0.005 wt %)/YZrOx: T = 550 °C, catalyst amount = 300 mg, C3H8:N2 = 2:3, WHSV(C3H8) = 1.57 h–1. Each cycle consisted of a PDH stage lasted for 28 min and a regeneration stage lasted for 30 min.
During the first PDH stage, propane conversion over 4Zn/TiZrOx decreased from 29% to 24%. The conversion degree in the 10th cycle was slightly lower, i.e., 25% and 23% at the beginning and in the end of the PDH stages, respectively. The slight drop in the initial propane conversion between the first and 10th PDH cycles can be ascribed to a loss of Zn. According to the ICP analysis, the fresh sample contains 4.06 and 16.70 wt % of Zn and Ti, respectively. The corresponding loading in the spent sample is 3.34 and 17.2 wt %. Regardless of the cycle number, the selectivity to propene was around 95%. Thus, 4Zn/TiZrOx showed good durability under industrially relevant conditions even in the presence of H2.
Nature of Active Site
As proven in our previous studies with Zn-free ZrO2-based catalysts, (24,27) the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment is a decisive activity-determining factor. When lattice oxygen is removed, Zrcus cations are formed. Two such sites form the active site for propane dehydrogenation. (24) Under this consideration, if Zrcus were also responsible for propane activation over our Zn-containing ZrO2- or MZrOx-supported catalysts, there should be a correlation between the rate of propene formation and reducibility. We defined the latter catalyst property as the number of CO molecules consumed in CO-TPR tests (Figure 5). For the bare supports, a rough correlation (CeZrOx is not considered due to easy reduction of CeO2, which is however not active for the PDH reaction) between the activity and the reducibility can be deduced from Figure S14. In contrast to the bare supports, the rate of propene formation over 4Zn/MTiOx decreases with catalyst reducibility. Moreover, we also established that supporting ZnO on ZrO2 or MZrOx inhibits the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen (Table 2). However, the rate of propene formation over less reducible 4Zn/ZrO2 and 4Zn/MZrOx is higher than over the corresponding bare supports. It is also worth mentioning that the strongest effect of Zn on the activity rise was established for 4Zn/TiZrOx and 4Zn/CeZrOx possessing the highest and the second highest fraction of tricoordinated Zn2+Ox species, respectively. Another important difference between the Zn-free and Zn-containing ZrO2-based catalysts is the activation energy of propene formation (Figure S15). The energy is higher for the former materials.
Against the above discussion, we put forward that coordinative unsaturated Zr cations should not be the (only) active sites for propane dehydrogenation over the Zn-containing catalysts. Do Zn species actively participate in propane dehydrogenation? To answer this question, we prepared and tested additional materials. We varied Zn loading on ZrO2 and TiZrOx supports and the kind of support for a certain Zn loading.
As the first step, we analyze the effect of Zn loading on the rate of propene formation over Zn/ZrO2 and Zn/TiZrOx (Figure 9a). For the former materials, Zn loading less than 2 wt % is detrimental to the activity, i.e., 0.5Zn/ZrO2 and 1Zn/ZrO2 showed rates of 0.11 and 0.24 mmol·g–1·min–1 respectively versus 0.32 mmol·g–1·min–1 for the bare ZrO2 (Figure 6a). Their higher loaded counterparts revealed higher activity than ZrO2. Such dependence does not support the importance of Zrcus sites for the PDH reaction, as their concentration should decrease with an increase in Zn loading.

Zn/ZrO2 (○), Zn/TiZrOx (●), 4Zn/SiO2 (green ▲), 4Zn/AlSiOx (blue ▲), 4Zn/Al2O3 (▽), 4Zn/TiSiOx (olive ▼), 2Zn/R-TiO2 (black ▼), 2ZnZr/R-TiO2 (green ▼). Reaction conditions: T = 550 °C, catalyst amount = 50 mg, C3H8:N2 = 2:3, WHSV(C3H8) = 34.5 h–1, the catalysts were reduced in a flow of 50 vol % H2 in N2 for 1 h at 550 °C before the PDH reaction.
In contrast to the Zn/ZrO2 system, the rate of propene formation over Zn/TiZrOx continuously increased with Zn loading up to 14 wt % and reached its highest value of 1.41 mmol·g–1·min–1. When the loading was further increased to 20 wt %, the rate slightly decreased. Such decrease in the activity might be due to the formation of crystalline ZnO as proven by XRD (Figure S16a). Furthermore, the reflection related to the (101) plane of t-ZrO2 shifted with increasing Zn loading, which suggests that Zn2+ cations were dissolved in the lattice of ZrO2 (Figure S16b). Although high loaded Zn/TiZrOx possesses crystalline ZnO, there are also isolated ZnOx species on the surface (Table 1).
To check if Zn sites are the only active species, we calculated an apparent TOF value related to total Zn atoms. The obtained results are shown in Figure 9b. The TOF value for Zn/TiZrOx decreases from 0.046 to 0.007 s–1 with rising Zn loading from 0.5 to 20 wt %. The decrease is less pronounced when comparing samples exclusively possessing isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ sites, i.e., from 0.046 to 0.03 s–1 for the samples with Zn loading from 0.5 to 4 wt %. The TOF values for Zn/ZrO2 with 0.5, 1, or 2 wt % are close to each other (between 0.023 and 0.026 s–1) but decreases to 0.017 s–1 with a further increase in the loading. The negative effect of Zn loading on the Zn-related TOF value could be partially caused by aggregation of ZnOx species as demonstrated by XRD. Taking into account the results of EXAFS analysis and catalytic tests in Figure 6a, we put forward that isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ should actively participate in propane dehydrogenation. It cannot be completely excluded that slightly oligomerized ZnOx also participate in this reaction. Moreover, when analyzing the TOF values determined for Zn/ZrO2 and Zn/TiZrOx materials, it becomes obvious that the latter system performs in a superior manner when comparing similarly loaded catalysts. Thus, the presence of TiO2 seems to be decisive for higher intrinsic activity of isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ sites. The below discussion supports this statement.
We now analyze the activity data obtained over the catalysts based on Al2O3, SiO2, AlSiOx, and TiSiOx supports possessing 4 wt % Zn. ZnO species in these materials should also be highly dispersed as concluded from our XRD analysis (Figure S17). No sign of crystalline ZnO could be detected. The rate of propene formation and the Zn-related TOF values are shown in Figure 9a and b, respectively. The 4Zn/Al2O3, 4Zn/SiO2, and 4Zn/AlSiOx catalysts showed about a 13 times lower rate in comparison with 4Zn/TiZrOx. Importantly, the rate over 4Zn/TiSiOx was significantly higher than over 4Zn/Al2O3, 4Zn/SiO2, and 4Zn/AlSiOx, i.e., 0.29 versus 0.03–0.08 mmol·g–1·min–1. Thus, the presence of Ti appears to be important for the activity of Zn2+ sites. The above-discussed effects of the rate and TOF of propene formation over different catalysts on Zn loading are also valid when this catalyst performance is plotted versus apparent Zn surface density (Figure S18).
To validate this hypothesis, we additionally prepared supported catalysts based on rutile TiO2 (R-TiO2). ZnO (2 wt % Zn loading) and/or MOx (M = La, Y, Zr, or Ce) were deposited on the surface of R-TiO2. The rate of propene formation over these catalysts is shown in Figure S19. In comparison with 2Zn/R-TiO2, the rate of propene formation increased upon the addition of ZrO2 but decreased when the oxide of La, Y, or Ce was added. Importantly, the Zn-related TOF value determined for 2ZnZr/R-TiO2 is very close to that determined for 2Zn/TiZrOx, i.e., 0.033 versus 0.04 s–1 (Figure 9b). Thus, interplay between TiO2 and ZrO2 with isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ species is highly relevant for the intrinsic activity of the latter. To check if the oxidation state of Zn2+, Zr4+, and Ti4+ changes under reducing conditions, we carried out in situ XANES tests with 20 vol % H2 in He up to 600 °C (Figure S20) and NAP-XPS measurements at 550 °C using a C3H8/H2/N2 = 8:1:11 feed (Figure S21). No changes in the oxidation state could be determined by both techniques.
Rate-Determining Step
The temporal analysis of products (TAP) reactor operating at submillisecond contact time was applied for analyzing kinetically relevant step(s) in the course of the PDH reaction over 4Zn/ZrO2 and 4Zn/TiZrOx. The catalysts were reduced in a similar way to that for steady-state PDH tests (see Temporal Analysis of Products). In agreement with the latter test, propene and hydrogen were detected upon pulsing a C3H8/Ar = 1:1 at 550 °C. Figure 10a,b shows the height-normalized responses of the alkane and the reaction products. The time scale in this figure is presented in a dimensionless form as suggested by Gleaves et al. (36) The dimensionless time is defined as t·Di/L2, where t is the measured time, Di is the effective diffusion coefficient of each component, and L is the reactor length. Such transformation is required for correct comparing the order of appearance of C3Hn (n = 6 or 8) and H2 strongly differing in their diffusion velocity due to diverse molecular weights. The diffusion coefficients of C3H8, C3H6, and H2 were calculated from that of Ar according to ref (36) and the corresponding molecular weights. The diffusion length for C3H6 and H2 was set from the beginning of the catalyst layer to the reactor outlet, while the whole reactor length was taken into consideration for C3H8.
Figure 10
Figure 10. Normalized transient responses of (a, b) C3H8 (green), C3H6 (blue), and H2 (red) after pulsing of a C3H8/Ar = 1:1 mixture and (c, d) D2, HD, and H2 after pulsing of a D2/Ar = 1:1 mixture at 550 °C.
The responses of C3H6 and H2 appear after the response of C3H8 because these products are formed from the alkane. However, the kinetics of their formation is different as concluded from the position of maxima of the corresponding responses. The maximal formation rate of H2 was achieved when the rate of C3H6 formation already declined. Thus, we can conclude that the rate-limiting step in the course of PDH is H2 formation but not the cleavage of C–H bonds in C3H8. It is also worth mentioning that another important result shown in Figure 10a,b is the difference in the shape of H2 response obtained upon pulsing of C3H8 over 4Zn/ZrO2 and 4Zn/TiZrOx. In comparison with the latter catalyst, the H2 response of 4Zn/ZrO2 is broader, possesses longer tailing (nonzero concentration of H2 at long dimensionless time), and appears later. According to the theory of the TAP reactor, (36) H2 formation from C3H8 over 4Zn/ZrO2 is slower in comparison with this process over 4Zn/TiZrOx. Thus, we can put forward that both the structure of ZnOx species and the presence of Ti in the support may be relevant for accelerating H2 formation.
We also investigated hydrogen activation over these two catalysts. To this end, a D2/Ar = 1/1 mixture was pulsed. HD and H2 were observed at the reactor outlet (Figure 10c,d). The presence of these products means that D2 reacted with surface H-containing species, probably OH groups. As H2 appears after HD, its formation can be ascribed to a consecutive exchange reaction of the latter. Although the sequence of HD and H2 formation is the same upon D2 isotopic exchange over 4Zn/ZrO2 and 4Zn/TiZrOx, the corresponding responses obtained over these catalysts strongly differ in their shape. Similar to the H2 response in C3H8 pulse experiments (Figure 10a,b), the responses of HD and H2 obtained after pulsing of D2/Ar over 4Zn/ZrO2 (Figure 10c,d) are significantly broader and possess longer tailing than those obtained over 4Zn/TiZrOx. The differences are due to faster kinetics of hydrogen desorption/formation over the latter catalyst.
Coke Formation and Removal
It is well-known that coke formation is one of the main reasons causing deactivation of catalysts used for the PDH reaction. (62,63) This should also be valid for our catalysts as they lose their activity with time on the propane stream (Figure 7). To derive mechanistic insights into the effect of the metal oxide promoter for ZrO2 in 4Zn/MZrOx and/or the kind of supported ZnOx species on coke formation, we applied ex situ Raman and operando UV–vis spectroscopy for catalyst characterization. The Raman spectra of selected spent (after 1 h the propane stream) catalysts are shown in Figure S22. According to Weckhuysen et al., (64) two distinct bands identified at around 1595 and 1345 cm–1 are characteristic for graphite (G) and disordered graphite (D) coke species, respectively. The calculated average ratio of G to D for these three catalysts from 10 Raman spectra recorded at different catalyst places is almost the same, suggesting the structure of the coke species is similar.
The operando UV–vis spectra expressed as F(Rrel) (see eq 4) after different times on the propane stream are shown in Figure 11. Although for all catalysts, F(Rrel) increased practically across the whole wavelength range due to the coke formation, there are some significant differences in the shape of the spectra and the absorption range. For the 4Zn/ZrO2, 4Zn/LaZrOx, and 4Zn/YZrOx catalysts, F(Rrel) from about 385 nm increased with rising time on the propane stream. In comparison with these catalysts, no significant changes in F(Rrel) below 460 nm was observed for 4Zn/CeZrOx. For 4Zn/TiZrOx, the reaction-induced changes in the absorption were observed from about 330 nm.
Figure 11
Figure 11. Operando UV–vis spectra of reduced (a) 4Zn/ZrO2, (b) 4Zn/LaZrOx, (c) 4Zn/YZrOx, (d) 4Zn/TiZrOx, (e) 4Zn/CeZrOx, and (f) height-normalized F(Rrel) at 800 nm after different times on propane stream.
To get an insight into the nature of coke species, the UV–vis spectra after 60 min of the propane stream were deconvoluted by Gaussian functions. The fitting results are shown in Figure S23. Bands at about 465, 525, 600, and 815 nm can be identified for 4Zn/ZrO2, 4Zn/LaZrOx, and 4Zn/YZrOx. For 4Zn/TiZrOx, there are bands located at about 440, 543, 718, and 903 nm. Only two absorption bands at 633 and 823 nm were identified for 4Zn/CeZrOx. Coke species with higher polymerization degree absorb at higher wavelength in comparison with their less polymerized counterparts. (65) On this basis, we could roughly divide the coke species into three kinds: low-condensed (below 500 nm), medium-condensed (500–800 nm), and highly condensed aromatics (above 800 nm). Obviously, all of these species were formed on the surface of 4Zn/ZrO2, 4Zn/LaZrOx, and 4Zn/YZrOx. Based on the deconvoluted UV–vis spectra in Figure S23, one can assume that the dominant coke species should be highly condensed aromatics. Such species were also mainly formed over 4Zn/CeZrOx, while no low-condensed aromatics were found. In comparison with these four catalysts, medium- and low-condensed aromatics are the main coke species on the surface of 4Zn/TiZrOx. Thus, the kind of ZnOx species in Zn/MZrOx appears to determine the type of coke species formed under PDH conditions. This hypothesis is supported by the discussion at the end of this chapter under consideration of additional experimental data.
Kinetic insights into coke formation and oxidation were derived from analyzing temporal evolution of F(Rrel) at 800 nm during the PDH reaction (Figure 11f) and catalyst oxidative regeneration (Figure S24), respectively. F(Rrel) at 800 nm could be an indicator of highly polymerized aromatics. (66) The profiles after PDH were normalized by their highest values achieved at the end of the test for an easier comparison of their slopes. Unfortunately, their absolute intensity is not a direct measure of the amount of coke formed. The catalysts can be ordered in terms of their activity for coke formation (slope of the F(Rrel)-time dependence in Figure 11f) as follows: 4Zn/ZrO2 > 4ZnYZrOx > 4Zn/LaZrOx > 4Zn/CeZrOx > 4Zn/TiZrOx. For all the catalysts, the rate of coke removal is significantly higher in comparison with the rate of coke formation as concluded from the evolution profiles of F(Rrel) recorded upon catalyst reoxidation (Figure S24). The F(Rrel) of the spent catalyst reached the value characteristic for fresh catalyst after only 5 min on air stream.
To determine the amount of coke and the temperature required to oxidize this undesired reaction product, TPO tests were performed with spent catalysts after reacting with C3H8 (40 vol % C3H8 and 5 vol % H2 in N2) at 550 °C for 1 h (catalytic data are shown in Figure 7a). TPO profiles in the form of the CO2/Ar MS signal are shown in Figure 12a. On the basis of the shape of CO2 profiles and Tmax-CO2 values (temperature of maximal CO2 production), the catalysts can be divided into three groups: (i) 4Zn/CeZrOx; (ii) 4Zn/ZrO2, 4Zn/LaZrOx, and 4Zn/YZrOx; and (iii) 4Zn/TiZrOx. Actually, the catalysts can be assigned to the same groups when comparing the operando UV–vis spectra in Figure 11.
Figure 12
Figure 12. (a) TPO profiles of samples (oxidized) after exposure to propane for 1 h and (b) the ratio of the amount of coke formed to that of converted C3H8.
The lowest Tmax-CO2 value of 310 °C was determined for 4Zn/CeZrOx, while 4Zn/TiZrOx required the highest temperature (above 430 °C) to oxidize coke. In comparison with these two catalysts, two maxima of CO2 evaluation at around 310 and 380 °C were determined for the catalysts from group ii. When comparing the Tmax-CO2 values with catalyst reducibility determined through CO-TPR tests (Table 2), one may conclude that the latter catalyst property is important for the oxidative removal of coke.
The catalysts were also compared for their ability to form coke in a quantitative manner. To this end, we integrated the CO2 profiles obtained in the TPO of spent catalysts. The amount of released CO2 corresponds to the amount of coke (m(coke)) formed in the PDH reaction. When comparing catalysts in terms of coke formation, it is important to consider the amount of propane converted, because coke is mainly formed from propene and to a minor extent directly from propane. Thus, we used the ratio of the amount of CO2 to that of converted C3H8. The total amount of consumed propane (m(C3H8)) was calculated using the conversion profiles from Figure 7a. The (m(coke)/m(C3H8)) ratio also stands for integral coke selectivity. This ratio is shown in Figure 12b. The highest value was determined for 4Zn/ZrO2 and decreased in the following order: 4Zn/ZrO2 > 4Zn/YZrOx > 4Zn/LaZrOx > 4Zn/CeZrOx > 4Zn/TiZrOx. A similar order was also obtained for the SBET-related amount of coke formed within 1 h on the propane stream (Table S4).
What is the reason behind the different catalyst behavior with respect to coke formation? Catalyst acidity is often reported to be one of the important parameters affecting coke formation in the PDH reaction. (67,68) To check this hypothesis for our materials, we tried to correlate the mass-based selectivity to coke with the concentration of acidic sites determined from NH3-TPD (Table 2). A correlation was established for the 4Zn/ZrO2, 4Zn/YZrOx, 4Zn/LaZrOx, and 4Zn/CeZrOx catalysts (Figure 13a). However, the 4Zn/TiZrOx catalyst possessing the highest concentration of acidic sites did not fit to this correlation. In fact, it showed the lowest selectivity to coke. Thus, catalyst acidity as determined from NH3-TPD tests us should not be the main property affecting coke formation. However, when the selectivity to coke is plotted versus the concentration of basic sites determined from CO2-TPD (Table 2), one can see a trend holding for all catalysts (Figure 13b). The selectivity seems to positively depend on the basicity.
Figure 13
Figure 13. Effects of (a) overall catalyst acidity (n(NH3)) or (b) basicity (n(CO2)) on mass-based selectivity to coke (S(coke)).
The effect of catalyst basicity on the selectivity to coke can be explained as follows. As seen in Table 2, the number of basic sites in general increased after depositing ZnOx due to basic nature of this metal oxide. The presence of nanosized ZnO clusters can be a reason for the high basicity of the 4Zn/ZrO2, 4Zn/YZrOx, 4Zn/LaZrOx, and 4Zn/CeZrOx catalysts (Table 2). 4Zn/TiZrOx possessing exclusively isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ species does not practically possess basic sites. Under these considerations, we suggest that the kind of supported ZnOx species is a decisive factor for coke formation. Such species also participate in propane dehydrogenation. On the basis of our previous study of the PDH reaction over VOx-based catalysts, (69) formation of coke is favored at a high density of adsorbed propene species. Such a situation is easily realized for nanosized ZnOx species but hindered for their isolated counterparts. This statement is indirectly supported by the results of operando UV–vis tests (Figure S23). Highly polymerized aromatic coke species dominate on the surface of catalysts with nano-sized ZnOx species. Contrarily, less oligomerized coke species were formed on isolated tricoordinated Zn2+ species (4Zn/TiZrOx).
Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that simple deposition of ZnO on ZrO2-based supports is an efficient method for preparation of highly active and selective catalysts for the nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation to propene. In comparison with the state-of-the-art ZrO2-based catalysts, the selectivity to propene could be improved when using TiZrOx support for ZnO species. The activity of such catalysts was also superior to that of a commercial-like K-CrOx/Al2O3, while the selectivity to propene was close, i.e., about 95% at a propane conversion of 30%.
On the basis of the results of catalytic tests and Zn K-edge Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure analysis, isolated Zn2+ cations anchored on ZrO2 were suggested to actively participate in the target reaction. They reveal a low ability toward coke formation and accordingly low deactivation. In contrast to crystalline ZrO2, the usage of X-ray amorphous ZrO2 is of advantage for homogeneous distribution of Zn2+ on the surface of ZrO2. The kind of metal oxide promoter for crystalline ZrO2 also affects the distribution. The obtained catalytic data strongly suggest that there is a synergy effect between Zn2+, ZrO2, and TiO2 in terms of the intrinsic activity of the active sites. Further improvements are expected when the distribution of Ti4+ within ZrO2 and the size of ZrO2 crystallites can be tuned as these parameters are relevant for the activity of Zn2+ cations to form/desorb hydrogen. This reaction pathway was established to limit propene formation in the course of propane dehydrogenation to propene.
