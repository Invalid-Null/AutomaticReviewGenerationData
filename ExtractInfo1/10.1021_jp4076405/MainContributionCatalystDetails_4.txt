The document discusses scaling relationships between hydrocarbon adsorption energies on transition metal surfaces to enable computational screening and catalyst design. It does not specifically mention propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation for converting propane to propylene. Therefore, this document does not seem directly relevant to the task.
