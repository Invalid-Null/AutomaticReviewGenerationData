The given document does not contain information directly related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation to produce propylene. It is a computational study using density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling to understand the effect of tin alloying on platinum-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. While it provides insights into how tin modification impacts activity and selectivity, it does not report any experimental results on a specific catalyst showing enhanced performance for propylene production from propane.
