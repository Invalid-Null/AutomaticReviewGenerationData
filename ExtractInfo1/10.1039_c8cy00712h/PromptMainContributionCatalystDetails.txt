Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over Pt–Sn/Si-beta catalysts: key role of Pt–Sn interaction
Bimetallic Pt–Sn catalysts supported on dealuminated Si-beta zeolite were prepared via wet impregnation and the nanoscale close contact between Pt and Sn species in Pt–Sn/Si-beta was confirmed by electron microscopy analyses. Characterization results from temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) indicated the interaction between Pt and Sn species, and the electron transfer from SnO2 to Pt species was clearly demonstrated by the XPS and FTIR spectra of CO adsorption. The as-prepared bimetallic Pt–Sn/Si-beta catalyst exhibited remarkable performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), in great contrast to monometallic Pt/Si-beta and Sn/Si-beta. Typically, a stable propane conversion of 37% and a propylene selectivity of 75% could be simultaneously achieved on 0.5Pt–5Sn/Si-beta at a reaction temperature of 773 K. Temperature-programmed desorption experiments revealed that the propane adsorption significantly strengthened while the propylene adsorption weakened on the bimetallic Pt–Sn/Si-beta catalyst, which accordingly resulted in its remarkable performance in ODHP reaction. The spatial separation of Pt and Sn species was observed on the used Pt–Sn/Si-beta catalyst and it was responsible for the catalytic deactivation.
1. Introduction
The selective dehydrogenation of alkanes provides an alternative route to non-petroleum based olefins with significant industrial relevance. A typical example is propane dehydrogenation (PDH) which produces propylene as a key chemical building block for a large number of chemicals such as polymers and oxygenates.1–3 The PDH process with Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 as a catalyst has been successfully commercialized by UOP, known as Oleflex™, which makes an impressive contribution to the industrial production of propylene. However, some undesired side reactions such as thermal cracking and coke formation do exist in the PDH process under harsh reaction conditions.4 Recently, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propylene, as a thermodynamically feasible reaction at lower temperatures, has received significant attention. Compared with PDH, the energy consumption can be greatly reduced and the problem of coke formation can be relieved with the addition of oxidants, such as molecular oxygen, halogens and sulfur compounds, in ODHP. Obviously, the most attractive oxidant for industrial ODHP is molecular oxygen, considering its advantages in terms of the economy and environment.5 Owing to the lower C–H bond energy (361 kJ mol−1) of propylene than that of propane (401 kJ mol−1), the propylene product and some reactive intermediates from side reactions can be over-oxidized to by-products CO and CO2, which remains a major challenge in the ODHP process.6
Catalysts from group V metal oxides, e.g. VOx and CrOx, have been extensively investigated for ODHP in the past decade.5,7–13 However, the undesired over-oxidation of propane remains a key drawback and achieving high alkene selectivity at high propane conversions is still challenging.14,15 More importantly, the toxicity of VOx and CrOx severely limits their industrial applications. Recently, BN-based materials have been developed as alternative catalysts for ODHP, which exhibited very good performance in the reaction.16–19 Since Pt-based catalysts are very active in PDH, it is natural to consider the applications of such catalysts in ODHP. However, Pt catalysts were very active for deep oxidation and they preferred to catalyze the combustion of propane instead of ODHP in most cases.20–24 Notably, Vajda and coworkers reported the use of subnanometre platinum clusters as highly active and selective catalysts for the ODHP.20 Pt8–10 clusters stabilized on high-surface-area alumina supports were found to be 40–100 times more active than previously studied Pt and VOx-based catalysts, and high selectivity to propylene instead of by-products in ODHP was achieved.
Inspired by the success of Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 in PDH, we here report the construction of supported Pt–Sn catalysts for the ODHP, with a focus on the role of Pt–Sn interaction in the reaction. Considering that both Lewis acidic Al2O3 and SnO2 can stabilize Pt species at high reaction temperatures25,26 and the presence of Brønsted acid sites can promote the deep oxidation of propane,23 Si-beta zeolite, free of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, is selected as an inert support for Pt–Sn active species to simplify the research. Fortunately, Pt–Sn/Si-beta is developed as a robust catalyst for ODHP with a maximum propylene productivity of 1.22 gC3H6 gcat−1 h−1 at 773 K and the key role of Pt–Sn interaction in ODHP is established.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Preparation of Si-beta supported catalysts
Zeolite H-beta (Si/Al = 12, from Sinopec) was treated in 13 M HNO3 solution at 373 K for 20 h and denoted as Si-beta.27 All Si-beta supported catalysts were prepared by wet impregnation. In a typical experiment, desired amounts of decomposable metal precursors, i.e. platinum nitrate and/or tin acetate, were dissolved in excess water to form a solution, to which Si-beta was added under stirring. The homogeneous slurry was evaporated at 353 K and then calcined at 873 K in flowing air for 6 h. The final product was labeled as xPt–ySn/Si-beta, where x and y indicate the designated weight percentage of Pt and Sn in the sample, respectively. For reference, H-beta and MCM-41 were also employed as supports, and Pt–Sn/H-beta and Pt–Sn/MCM-41 were prepared via similar wet impregnation routes.
2.2. Sample characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of selected samples were recorded on a Bruker D8 diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation in the region of 2θ = 5–50° at a scanning rate of 6° min−1.
The surface areas of the selected samples were determined using N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K with a Quantachrome iQ-MP gas adsorption analyzer. The total surface areas were determined using the Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) equation and the micropore volumes were calculated using the t-plot method.
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) and high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were obtained using a FEI Talos electron microscope. Elemental mapping and line scan analyses were conducted in HAADF-STEM mode with drift correction applied.28
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of the selected samples were performed using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer with monochromatic Al-Kα X-rays as the excitation source. The binding energy values were calibrated with reference to the adventitious C 1s peak at 284.8 eV.
The experiments of temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR) were performed using a Quantachrome ChemBET 3000 chemisorption analyzer. The sample was treated in He at 673 K for 1 h and cooled to 300 K in flowing He. Afterwards, the sample was heated in 8% H2/He to 800 K at a rate of 10 K min−1.
The experiments of temperature-programmed desorption were also performed using the Quantachrome ChemBet 3000 chemisorption analyzer. In a typical experiment, the sample was saturated with 5% NH3/He (or 5% C3H8/He or 5% C3H6/He) at 323 K and then purged with He at the same temperature for 1 h to eliminate the physically absorbed species. The TPD profiles were recorded in flowing He at a heating rate of 10 K min−1 from 323 to 1073 K and the signals of desorption species were monitored using a Pfeiffer Omnistar GSD 320 mass spectrometer.
FTIR spectra of CO adsorption on selected samples were obtained using a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer with 512 scans at a resolution of 2 cm−1. The samples were pretreated in He at 673 K for 1 h. After cooling to 298 K, the He stream was switched to 1% CO/He and time-dependent FTIR spectra of CO adsorption were sequentially recorded at 298 K.
The thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry analysis (TG-DSC) was performed using a Thermal Advantage Q600 SDT system. In a typical experiment, ca. 0.01 g of catalyst sample after ODHP reaction was placed in the crucible and heated from 300 to 1073 K in flowing dry air at a rate of 10 K min−1.
2.3. Catalytic evaluation
The ODHP reaction was performed in a fixed-bed flow micro-reactor at atmospheric pressure. In a typical experiment, 0.1 g catalyst sample (sieve fraction of 0.25–0.5 mm, 0.12 mL) was placed in a quartz reactor (5 mm i.d.) and pretreated in 10% O2/He at 823 K for 1 h. After cooling to the desired temperature, the reactant gas mixture (10% C3H8, 5% O2, He balance) was fed at a total flow rate of 40 mL min−1, corresponding to a gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 20 000 h−1 (W/F = 10 g h mol−1). The reaction was conducted isothermally and the gas products were analyzed by using two on-line gas chromatographs. One was equipped with a Plot Q capillary column and a FID detector for the analysis of organic products, and the other with a Porapak N packed column and a TCD detector for the analysis of COx. The conversion of propane and the selectivity toward propylene are defined as follows:
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Properties of ODHP catalysts
The structure of Si-beta supported catalysts were first investigated by means of XRD. As shown in Fig. 1a, all the samples exhibited typical diffraction peaks characteristic of the BEA topology with similar intensities, ruling out the collapse of the zeolite framework upon dealumination and wet impregnation. Besides, no characteristic diffraction peaks due to metal species could be observed owing to the low loadings of metal species and their good dispersion. In Fig. 1b, all the samples under study showed similar type I isotherms, characteristic of a zeolite microporous structure. The textural properties of the zeolite samples under study are summarized in Table 1 for a direct view. All the samples exhibited similar BET surface areas of 590–620 m2 g−1 and micropore volumes of 0.203–0.210 cm3 g−1, indicating the well preserved BEA topology after dealumination and metal impregnation. The actual metal loadings determined by XRF were slightly lower than the designated values due to the loss of metal species during the filtration and calcination steps.

The acidity of the samples was characterized by means of NH3-TPD, and the results are shown in Fig. 1c. The parent H-beta zeolite exhibited two NH3 desorption peaks, i.e. one desorption peak centered at 503 K corresponding to weak acid sites and another desorption peak centered at 663 K corresponding to strong acid sites (not shown here). After full dealumination, both the weak and strong acid sites disappeared, as observed for Si-beta. The introduction of Pt species resulted in the appearance of trace weak acid sites and the introduction of Sn resulted in the formation of considerable amounts of Lewis acid sites, corresponding to the broad ammonia desorption peak at 373–743 K (Fig. 1c). With the co-impregnation of Sn and Pt species, a sharp ammonia desorption peak centered at 523 K was observed on Pt–Sn/Si-beta, being quite different to that observed on Pt/Si-beta and Sn/Si-beta. That is, the interaction between Pt and Sn species on the Si-beta support could be expected.
The redox properties of Pt and Sn species on the Si-beta support were investigated by means of H2-TPR and the results are shown in Fig. 1d. For Pt/Si-beta, two weak hydrogen consumption peaks were observed due to the low Pt loading in the sample. The low-temperature peak at 303–453 K (H/Pt = 1.7) was due to the reduction of PtOx on the zeolite surface, while the high-temperature peak at 623–903 K (H/Pt = 2.1) should originate from the reduction of Pt species that strongly interact with the zeolite framework. For Sn/Si-beta, a broad hydrogen consumption peak at 303–1023 K was observed due to the reduction of Sn species (H/Sn = 1.9). The highest reduction peak centered at 793 K was due to the reduction of Sn4+ to Sn2+.29,30 For Pt–Sn/Si-beta, the reduction of Pt species could not be easily distinguished due to the overlap with the strong signals from the reduction of Sn species. Meanwhile, the reduction of dominating Sn4+ species to Sn2+ (centered at 753 K) was significantly promoted by the presence of Pt species, which is in good agreement with literature reports.31–35 This also provided indirect evidence for the interaction between Pt and Sn species on the Si-beta support. According to the TPR profiles, it could be proposed that both Pt and Sn species dominantly existed in their oxide forms on the Si-beta support with Pt–Sn interaction.
The distribution of Pt and Sn species on the Si-beta support could be directly observed by electron microscopy and the representative results are shown in Fig. 2. As shown in the HR-TEM and HAADF-STEM images, nanoparticles of a few nanometers (typically 3–7 nm) were homogeneously dispersed on the zeolite support. The selected-area elemental mapping analysis results clearly revealed that Pt and Sn appeared in overlapping locations, indicating the close contact between Pt and Sn species on the Si-beta support. Meanwhile, the existence of well isolated Sn species could be detected. For more exact information on the structure of Pt–Sn/Si-beta, line scan analyses on a single nanoparticle were performed. The size of the selected nanoparticle was determined to be ∼4 nm, and the same relative positions of Pt and Sn atoms in the nanoparticle were definitely identified. The formation of Pt–Sn nanoparticles with close contact was a unique phenomenon on Si-beta zeolite, which was not observed using other silica supports, i.e. SiO2 and MCM-41 (not shown here). This can be explained by the use of silanols as anchoring sites for Pt–Sn species and the structure confinement effects from BEA zeolite, as revealed in our previous study.36

The oxidation states of Pt and Sn in Pt–Sn/Si-beta catalysts before and after ODHP reaction were examined by means of XPS. Two binding energy signals at 72.7 and 75.9 eV corresponding to Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 photoelectrons from platinum oxides37,38 were observed for Pt/Si-beta (Fig. 3a). These two signals shifted toward lower values of 71.9 and 75.2 eV on Pt–Sn/Si-beta, due to the electron transfer from SnO2 species to Pt species. After ODHP reaction, the dominating Pt 4f7/2 signal remained unchanged while a noticeable shift of the Pt 4f7/2 signal was observed. Due to the weak signal from a low Pt loading, the deconvolution of the Pt 4f XPS spectrum was unreliable. However, the presence of lower binding energy pairs, i.e. 70.6 and 73.9 eV, could be distinguished after careful observations (Fig. 3a). These signals should be caused by photoelectrons from metallic platinum. That is, a small portion of platinum oxides were reduced to metallic platinum during ODHP reaction. As shown in Fig. 3b, similar binding energy values of 487.5 and 496.0 eV, corresponding to the Sn 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 photoelectrons, were observed for all Sn-containing samples under study. These values were significantly higher than those of bulk SnO2 (486.0 and 494.5 eV (ref. 38 and 39)), indicating the electron transfer from Sn to the zeolite framework. This type of electron transfer could be expected to create Lewis acid centers, as shown in the NH3-TPD profiles of Sn/Si-beta (Fig. 1c). Besides, no significant influences from adjacent Pt species and the state changes after ODHP reaction could be distinguished from the Sn 3d XPS results.

The oxidation states of exposed Pt species were further examined using FTIR spectra of CO adsorption. Since no stable adsorbed CO species were formed on the Sn/Si-beta sample under our experimental conditions, all adsorbed CO species observed here were associated with Pt sites. For Pt/Si-beta, the IR band at 1950 cm−1 appeared upon CO adsorption, which could be assigned to Pt4+–CO complexes.40 Meanwhile, for Pt–Sn/Si-beta, the IR band at 1935 cm−1 due to Pt2+–CO complexes was observed.40 These observations indicated the electron transfer from the SnO2 donor to the Pt acceptor, as a result of their close contact (Fig. 2) and in agreement with the XPS results (Fig. 3a). After ODHP reaction for 8 h, two sets of CO adsorption bands at 2085 and 1935 cm−1 were observed on Pt–Sn/Si-beta. According to literature reports,41,42 the band appearing at 2085 cm−1 should be assigned to CO molecules linearly adsorbed in an a-top geometry on Pt nanoparticles. Obviously, the existing states of Pt changed after ODHP reaction, i.e. the partial reduction of Pt4+ species to metallic Pt. These observations also agree well with the XPS results in Fig. 3a.
Summarizing the results from the XPS and FTIR spectra of CO adsorption, we came to the conclusion that Pt and Sn species existed in their highest oxidation states on the Si-beta support, as expected from our preparation route of calcination at 873 K in flowing air. For Pt–Sn/Si-beta, the electrons could transfer from Lewis acidic SnO2 to Pt species with close contact and therefore modified the oxidation state of Pt to some extent. After ODHP reaction, a small portion of surface Pt oxides were reduced to metallic Pt.
3.2. Catalytic performance in ODHP
The ODHP performance of Si-beta supported catalysts was first investigated. Si-Beta was completely inactive for propane oxidation, while monometallic 5Sn/Si-beta and 0.5Pt/Si-beta showed considerable activity in propane oxidation to COx at 773 K, as shown in Fig. 4a. In contrast, bimetallic 0.5Pt–5Sn/Si-beta appeared to be active in ODHP and a stable propane conversion of 37% with 75% selectivity toward propylene was achieved under the employed reaction conditions. Obviously, both propane conversion and propylene selectivity were significantly promoted in the presence of Pt–Sn active components. Since the physical mixture of Pt/Si-beta and Sn/Si-beta could only catalyze the oxidation of propane to COx, the ODHP activity of 0.5Pt–5Sn/Si-beta should be related to Pt–Sn interaction.

(a) Comparison between Pt/Si-beta, Sn/Si-beta, Pt–Sn/Si/beta and the physical mixture of Pt/Si-beta and Sn/Si-beta; (b) effects of support materials on the performance of Pt–5Sn catalysts; (c) effects of Sn loadings on the performance of Pt–Sn/Si-beta catalysts; (d) temperature-dependent catalytic behavior of Pt–5Sn/Si-beta; (e) propane conversion over Pt–Sn/Si-beta under different W/F values; (f) effects of C3H8/O2 ratios on the performance of the Pt–5Sn/Si-beta catalyst. Reaction conditions: 0.1 g catalyst, 10% C3H8, 5% O2, He balance, GHSV = 20 000 h−1, temperature = 773 K, unless specifically stated.
The support effects on ODHP over the 0.5Pt–5Sn catalysts were examined. As shown in Fig. 4b, the presence of Brønsted acid sites in BEA zeolite, i.e. H-beta, played a negative role in ODHP reaction, which should be related to the activation of propane and propylene by the Brønsted acid sites. 0.5Pt–5Sn supported on MCM-41 could also catalyze the ODHP reaction, with 28% propane conversion and 35% propylene selectivity achieved at 773 K. The effects of Sn loadings on the ODHP performance of Pt–Sn/Si-beta catalysts were further investigated. As shown in Fig. 4c, Sn loadings in Pt–Sn/Si-beta indeed showed significant impacts on ODHP reaction and a Sn weight loading of 5% could be optimized at a fixed Pt weight loading of 0.5%. The impacts from supports and Sn loadings of Pt–Sn catalysts should originate from the Pt–Sn interaction. With an optimized support and Pt/Sn ratio, the close contact between Pt and Sn species with electron transfer could be achieved, which exhibited positive effects on ODHP reaction. In the case of using Si-beta zeolite as the catalyst support, the framework vacant sites created from dealumination acted as anchoring sites for Sn species39,43 and homogeneous SnO2 nanoparticles stabilized by Si-beta could be obtained (Fig. 2). Due to their intrinsic properties, Pt and SnO2 species interacted with each other and the electron transfer between them could be observed (Fig. 3).
With 0.5Pt–5Sn/Si-beta as the optimized catalyst, the temperature-dependent ODHP behavior is presented in Fig. 4d. It was interesting to reveal that both the propane conversion and the propylene selectivity increased with increasing temperature from 573 to 823 K. As a result, the propylene yield gradually increased from 0 at 573 K to 38% at 823 K.
Finally, the effects of reaction parameters on ODHP performance were investigated. With increasing W/F values from 0.7 to 2.8 s, the propane conversion exhibited a linear increasing trend, i.e. increased from 32 to 47%. With a W/F value of 0.98 s, the propane conversion rate based on the total moles of Pt at 773 K was calculated to be 0.49 molC3H8 molPt−1 s−1, abbreviated as 0.49 s−1. The ratio of propane to oxygen also showed noticeable impacts on ODHP reaction. With a fixed propane concentration of 10%, stoichiometric oxygen (5%, C3H8/O2 = 2) was good to obtain the highest propylene yield. Excess oxygen (10%) could promote deep oxidation of propane to COx while less oxygen (3.3%) resulted in the formation of coke species from direct hydrogenation of propane.
To our knowledge, the performance of 0.5Pt–5Sn/Si-beta in ODHP was very attractive and a direct comparison between various catalysts is summarized in Table 2. Typically, a propylene selectivity of 75% was achieved at a propane conversion of 37% with our 0.5Pt–5Sn/Si-beta catalyst, which appeared to be higher than those of representative VOx- (a propylene selectivity of 61% at a propane conversion of 9%),44 CrOx- (a propylene selectivity of 61% at a propane conversion of 30% (ref. 41)) and MoOx- (a propylene selectivity of 25% at a propane conversion of 27% (ref. 46)) based catalysts under comparable reaction conditions. Pt-Based catalysts, e.g. Pt/SnO2 and Pt/SiO2, could only catalyze the deep oxidation of propane under our reaction conditions, while the propylene selectivity over Pt/monolith could be increased to ∼20% at a very short contact time.47 Meanwhile, Pt clusters with low coordination numbers prepared by atomic layer deposition could catalyze the ODHP reaction, with a maximum propylene selectivity of 37% and a propane conversion rate of 0.23 s−1.48 Our 0.5Pt–5Sn/Si-beta appeared to be more active in ODHP, in terms of propylene selectivity, propane conversion rate and propylene productivity, than the above-mentioned catalyst systems; however, it is less active than the model system of size preselected Pt8–10 clusters stabilized on SnO/AAO20 (Table 2). Nevertheless, taking the two most important parameters, i.e. propylene selectivity and productivity, into consideration, 0.5Pt–5Sn/Si-beta could be regarded as a promising catalyst for industrial application. In fact, 0.5Pt–5Sn/Si-beta acted like Pt/Al2O3 prepared by atomic layer deposition in ODHP reaction,20,48 and the stabilization of Pt clusters by Lewis acidic species was crucial in both cases. SnO2 with stronger Lewis acidity than Al2O3 was preferred for Pt stabilization and the simple preparation route added a further advantage to our Pt–Sn/Si-beta catalyst system.

3.3. Key role of Pt–Sn interaction in ODHP
As previously mentioned, the Pt–Sn interaction was essential for the remarkable ODHP performance of Pt–Sn/Si-beta. To obtain a deeper insight into the key role of Pt–Sn interaction in ODHP, temperature-programmed desorption studies were performed.
The C3H8-TPD profiles clearly revealed that the propane reactant adsorbed more strongly on 0.5Pt–5Sn/Si-beta than on 0.5Pt/Si-beta and 5Sn/Si-beta (Fig. 5a). An additional desorption peak centered at 543 K was observed on 0.5Pt–5Sn/Si-beta, which was good for propane conversion. This could explain the higher propane conversion achieved on 0.5Pt–5Sn/Si-beta, as shown in Fig. 4a. Meanwhile, the C3H6-TPD profiles (Fig. 5b) revealed that the desired product propylene adsorbed more weakly on 0.5Pt–5Sn/Si-beta than on 0.5Pt/Si-beta and 5Sn/Si-beta. That is, the dehydrogenation product propylene underwent easier desorption from 0.5Pt–5Sn/Si-beta, which effectively inhibited the further oxidation of propylene to COx. This was responsible for the much higher propylene selectivity achieved on 0.5Pt–5Sn/Si-beta than on 0.5Pt/Si-beta and 5Sn/Si-beta (Fig. 4a). According to the results presented here, the modulation of Pt by SnO2, i.e. electron transfer from SnO2 to Pt, could also strengthen propane adsorption and simultaneously weaken propylene adsorption, facilitating ODHP reaction.

The catalyst stability was an important issue in PDH, and rapid catalyst deactivation by coking was claimed.6 Meanwhile, for ODHP, the presence of oxygen was expected to suppress coke formation. As shown in Fig. 4c, a gradual decrease in propane conversion (from 37 to 26% within 8 h) and propylene selectivity (from 75 to 58% within 8 h) was observed. The coke deposition on the surface of 0.5Pt–5Sn/Si-beta after ODHP for 8 h was analyzed by TG-DSC. As shown in Fig. 6, the weight loss due to coke deposits was only 0.5% (400–800 K with an exothermic peak). The very low amount of coke could not cause the significant decline in propane conversion and propylene selectivity. The XPS (Fig. 3a) and FTIR spectra of CO adsorption (Fig. 3c) demonstrated the changes in the existing states of Pt species after ODHP reaction, i.e. the partial reduction of platinum oxides to metallic Pt, which might be accompanied by catalytic deactivation.
Fig. 6 TG-DSC analysis of the Pt–Sn/Si-beta sample after ODHP reaction.
The distribution of Pt and Sn species on Si-beta after ODHP reaction was examined by electron microscopy and the representative images are shown in Fig. 7. The HAADF-STEM images revealed the presence of both nanoparticles of a few nanometers and their aggregates. Elemental mapping analysis of the aggregates confirmed the aggregation of Sn species while Pt species still existed in the form of well-isolated nanoparticles. That is, catalyst deactivation due to the simple sintering of Pt species could be excluded. Line scan analyses of representative Pt-containing nanoparticles were then performed to obtain more exact information on the structure of Pt–Sn/Si-beta after ODHP reaction. The size of the single Pt nanoparticle was determined to be 4–6 nm, similar to that before ODHP reaction and in good agreement with the mapping analysis results. More importantly, the spatial separation of Pt- and Sn-containing particles could be observed. Obviously, the spatial separation was not good for the electron transfer and most probably related to catalytic deactivation.

According to the characterization results of 0.5Pt–5Sn/Si-beta before and after ODHP reaction, a clear picture of catalytic deactivation could be drawn. During ODHP reaction, the sintering of Sn-containing species and the spatial separation of Pt- and Sn-containing particles (accompanied by the partial reduction of platinum oxides to metallic Pt by hydrocarbons) occurred, which reduced the electron transfer from SnO2 to Pt species and caused a gradual deactivation of the bimetallic Pt–Sn/Si-beta catalyst.
4. Conclusions
Bimetallic Pt–Sn/Si-beta has been successfully prepared via wet impregnation using decomposable metal precursors and dealuminated Si-beta as the support. With silanols created from zeolite dealumination as anchoring sites, the homogeneous distribution of Pt and Sn species is guaranteed and their close contact is clearly demonstrated. Both Pt and Sn species exist in the form of oxides, and the electron transfer from Lewis acidic SnO2 to Pt species is revealed by XPS and FTIR spectra of CO adsorption.
Pt/Si-beta and Sn/Si-beta are active for the deep oxidation of propane to COx, while bimetallic Pt–Sn/Si-beta is active for ODHP with a propylene selectivity of 75% at a propane conversion of 37% at 773 K. Typically, the propane conversion rate is calculated to be 0.49 s−1 and the propylene productivity is calculated to be 1.22 gC3H6 gcat−1 h−1 on 0.5Pt–5Sn/Si-beta, which are comparable with those of most active ODHP catalysts reported so far under comparable conditions. The Pt–Sn electron interaction is found to play a key role in ODHP reaction as it can strengthen the adsorption of propane and weaken the adsorption of propylene on the surface of Pt–Sn/Si-beta. During ODHP reaction, the spatial separation of Pt and Sn species occurs on the Pt–Sn/Si-beta catalyst, which significantly reduces Pt–Sn interaction and therefore leads to catalytic deactivation.
