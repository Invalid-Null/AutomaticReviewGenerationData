Ce0.95Cr0.05O2 and Ce0.97Cu0.03O2: active, selective and stable catalysts for selective hydrogen combustion
Ceria-based materials are promising solid “oxygen reservoirs” for propane oxidative dehydrogenation. The ceria lattice oxygen can selectively combust hydrogen from the dehydrogenation mixture at 550 °C. This shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium to the desired products side, generates heat aiding the endothermic dehydrogenation, and simplifies product separation. The process is also safer, since it avoids mixing O2 and H2 at high temperatures. While ceria itself is unselective, its catalytic properties can be tuned by doping. We study the effects of dopant type, concentration and the crystallite size on the catalytic properties. Doping with Cr or Cu increases both the selectivity and activity of the ceria, albeit that propane combustion also increases linearly with the Cu-concentration. The Cu-doped catalysts give selectivities up to 95% and combust up to 8% of the hydrogen feed. The best results are obtained with Cr-doped ceria, with selectivities up to 98%, and combustion of up to 15% of the hydrogen feed. The Cr-doped catalysts are stable in the reductive gas feed, and no extra coke is formed when the catalyst is subjected to an extra 10 min in the dehydrogenation mixture, after the hydrogen combustion reaction has stopped. This robustness is essential for industrial dehydrogenation applications.
Introduction
Propene is an important bulk chemical. It is a building block for a variety of compounds, but is primarily used for producing polypropene.1 The annual propene demand is expected to rise to 80 million tonnes in 2010 worldwide.2–4 About 95% of the current production of propene is supplied by crackers and oil refineries, but more advantageous methods such as metathesis and catalytic dehydrogenation of propane are gaining ground. These allow for on-demand production of high purity monomer.5,6 The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane usually employs a platinum or chromium oxidecatalyst on alumina, typically at 550–600 °C.7–9 Unfortunately, this is an endothermic, equilibrium limited reaction. One way to overcome these problems is by applying oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH), where oxygen or an oxygen containing molecule such as N2O or CO2 is added to the gas feed.10–12 Alternatively, one can combine catalytic dehydrogenation with selective combustion of the hydrogen by-product (Scheme 1, left).13–20 This generates energy and shifts the equilibrium to the desired products side. Gaseous oxygen can be used,21 but mixing oxygen, propane, propene and hydrogen at high temperatures and in the presence of a catalyst is dangerous. A better solution is applying a redox process, where a solid “oxygen reservoir” (SOR) is added to the dehydrogenation catalyst. Now, instead of using gaseous oxygen, the lattice oxygen of the SOR does the selective hydrogen combustion. This is safer, and allows for separate tuning of the dehydrogenation and selective hydrogen combustion processes using two catalysts. Following the reduction of the SOR lattice, the oxygen vacancies are replaced using air, creating a cyclic redox process (Scheme 1, right).
Scheme 1 Left: dehydrogenation combined with selective hydrogen combustion. The selective hydrogen combustion consumes part of the hydrogen formed during the dehydrogenation step, shifting the equilibrium to the products side and generating heat. Right: cartoon of the complete redox cycle. After the dehydrogenation step (A), the bed is flushed with nitrogen (B), and the catalysts are regenerated through reoxidation (C). This burns coke from the dehydrogenation catalyst and restores the lattice oxygen of the SOR catalyst. After another nitrogen flush (D) the reactor is ready for the next redox cycle.
Selective hydrogen combustion can be performed by supported metal oxides, such as Bi2O3/SiO2, but these sinter under redox cycling.14–17,22 Ceria has high temperature stability and a facile Ce3+⇆ Ce4+ + e− reaction, making it a good solid oxygen reservoir.23 CeO2 itself, however, is not selective, but we showed that selectivity, activity and stability can be tuned by doping the ceria lattice with different cations.24,25 The presence of the dopants at the surface is most important, since this is where the catalysis takes place. Incorporating dopants in the lattice can increase the activity by increasing the oxygen flux, but the main reason for using doped cerias is their increased stability under redox cycling, compared to supported metal oxides. The most promising dopants are Cu, Mn, K, Cr, Pb, Sn and Bi. High activities are obtained using Pb, Sn and Bi, but these catalysts are not stable (Pb) or less selective (Sn and Bi). Conversely, doping with K leads to selective catalysts with low activity.25,26 We therefore focus on Cu- and Cr-doped ceria. The dopant acts as active site for the selective hydrogen combustion, but also affects physical properties of the ceria, such as the crystallite size.25 Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) studies showed that this also affects the redox properties of the catalysts.27–29 The above experiments were performed using a simple model system, with hydrogen as reducing agent. In the actual selective hydrogen combustion, however, a mixture of propane, propene and hydrogen is present.
Here, we investigate the effect of the crystallite size, dopant type, and the dopant concentration on the catalytic properties under simulated selective hydrogen combustion reaction conditions. We compare the activity, selectivity, and stability of three catalyst types: plain CeO2, Cr-doped ceria and Cu-doped ceria, and discuss the factors that govern catalyst performance. The crystallite size of all three catalyst types is varied. In case of Cr-doping, this is done at a set concentration of 5 mol%. Data of copper-doped ceria is added to investigate the effect of the dopant type on the catalytic properties. The copper loading is varied from 0.1 to 10 mol% to assess the effect of the doping level. A maximum of 10 mol% was chosen, as previous studies showed that doping at higher concentrations leads to phase segregation.
Results and discussion
Catalyst preparation and characterisation
The doped ceria catalysts1–18 were prepared by co-melting mixtures of the metal nitrate hydrate precursors.30,31 The metal nitrates are weighed in a porcelain crucible and heated to about 100 °C, so that the cerium nitrate melts (melting point 65 °C). The mixture is stirred until all components are dissolved or have melted (the melting point of the chromium nitrate is 60 °C; copper nitrate decomposes at 115 °C). The crucible is placed in a vacuum oven set at 140 °C and the pressure is carefully lowered to <10 mbar (in 10–15 min), making sure no vigorous boiling occurs. After 4 h, the samples are placed in a furnace and calcined under static air at 700 °C (ramp rate 300 °C/h, 5 h hold). Fig. 1 shows pictures of three catalysts before (left, mixed nitrates), and after calcination (right, mixed oxides). Whereas pure cerium nitrate is white, and CeO2 is pale yellow, the mixed oxides show a variety of colours.
Fig. 1 Photos of three catalysts (3 CeO2, 8 Ce0.95Cr0.05O2 and 16 Ce0.93Cu0.07O2) after heating under reduced pressure (left, mixed nitrates) and calcining (right, mixed oxides).
Each catalyst was characterised using powder X-ray diffraction, to confirm it consists of a uniform phase. That is, only the diffraction lines of the cerias fluorite structure are observed, and no separate oxides of the dopants are present. Note that the catalysts were not prepared by impregnating CeO2 supports. The co-melting of the cerium nitrate with the nitrates of the appropriate metals yields a well mixed liquid catalyst precursor. This allows for incorporation of the dopants into the ceria fluorite structure after calcination. Note that the XRD cannot detect surface enrichment of dopant, or the presence of dopant-oxides smaller than ∼3 nm.
In total, we synthesised eighteen catalysts in three sets, all varying in crystallite size: first, a set of undoped ceria catalysts as reference (1–6), second a set of 5 mol% Cr-doped catalysts (7–12), and third a set of 0.1–10 mol% Cu-doped ceria (13–18).
Crystallite size effects on activity and selectivity
First, we studied the relationship between crystallite size and selectivity in the selective hydrogen combustion, by synthesising a set of undoped ceria catalysts with increasing crystallite size. Table 1 shows the properties of the undoped catalysts1–6. The crystallite size was adjusted by varying the calcination temperature (catalyst1 and 2), or by exposing the catalyst to hydrogen at 800 °C over extended periods of time (catalysts6a and 6b, which were prepared by treating 6 in 66% hydrogen at 800 °C for 4 and 16 h, respectively). Catalysts3–6 reflect the sample-to-sample variation in crystallite size. In a typical selective hydrogen combustion reaction, a stream simulating the effluent from industrial propane dehydrogenation (4:1:1% v/v C3H8:C3H6:H2 in Ar at 50 mL/min total flow rate) was fed to the reactor containing ∼250 mg of doped ceria at 550 °C. After this 10 min reduction step, the reactor was purged with Ar, followed by an oxidation step (1% v/v O2 in Ar, 18 min) and a second purge step with Ar to complete the cycle. The reaction was monitored using mass spectrometry (MS, reoxidation step) and online gas chromatography (GC, reduction step). These are used to assess the amount of hydrocarboncombustion, coking, and hydrogen combustion (Scheme 2). The selectivity is defined as . The amount of hydrocarboncombustion is determined by measuring the amount of CO2 formed in the reduction step (no CO observed). The coke is quantified by measuring the amount of CO and CO2, originating from the combustion of the coke, in the oxidation step. The activity of the catalysts is given by two parameters. The first is the so-called “oxygen demand”, which is the amount of oxygen used in the oxidation step for refilling the reduced lattice vacancies as well as for combusting the coke. Thus, the oxygen demand represents both selective and unselective processes. The second is the “hydrogen activity”, representing the percentage of the hydrogen feed combusted by each catalyst.

It is the amount of oxygen needed for refilling the lattice and combusting the coke present on the catalyst surface. b Same as catalyst6, but treated for 4 h at 800 °C under flowing hydrogen. c A second batch of catalyst6, treated for 16 h at 800 °C under flowing hydrogen. d The surface area of these catalysts is too low to be accurately determined.
Scheme 2 Cartoon showing the major interactions between the dehydrogenation gas mixture and the SOR catalyst. The so-called oxygen demand is the total amount of catalyst oxygen used by the processes.
The undoped ceria is unselective. All catalysts shown in Table 1 give a negligible conversion of hydrogen but do convert the hydrocarbons, mainly at the beginning of the reduction cycle. Both hydrocarboncombustion and coking occur. Fig. 2 shows the level of coking, combustion and oxygen demand of the undoped ceria catalysts against crystallite size. The data show that coking and combustion are related to crystallite size. The small crystals primarily coke the hydrocarbons (Fig. 2, top), while large ones primarily combust them (Fig. 2, middle). Note that the trends remain when the data is normalised for surface area. The oxygen demand (Fig. 2, bottom), is the sum of the combustion and coking processes. Indeed, the curve is u-shaped, stemming mainly from coking for the small crystallites, and mainly from combustion for the larger crystallites. Fig. 2 also shows that there is an optimal size for the ceria crystallites of around 20 nm, where both of these unwanted processes are minimised. This can be taken into account when using ceria in reactions with hydrocarbons. Note that 6a and 6b, containing very large crystallites, show even lower amounts of coking and combustion than the ones presented in Fig. 2. However, their low surface area renders them unsuited as catalyst supports.
Fig. 2 Level of hydrocarbon coking (top), combustion (middle), and the oxygen demand (bottom) of the plain ceria catalystsvs. crystallite size. Determined at the selective hydrogen combustion reaction conditions (alternating feeds of 4:1:1% v/v C3H8:C3H6:H2 in Ar (10 min), and 1% v/v O2 in Ar (18 min), at 550 °C).
Fig. 2 (middle) shows that small ceria crystallites do not combust hydrocarbons at all in the selective hydrogen combustion, whilst larger ones do. In H2-TPR, however, this phenomena is reversed: the smaller ceria crystallites do show the highest level of hydrogen combustion (vide infra). Clearly, the combustion behaviour of the catalysts depends on the gas feed. When hydrocarbons are present, the smaller crystallites preferably coke them, even though there is plenty of oxygen available. Possibly, the high adsorption affinity of the lower coordinated surface atoms results in a higher level of coking, as compared to combustion.
Cr-doped ceria: varying crystallite size at a constant doping level
To investigate the effect of the crystallite size on the catalytic properties of a dopedcatalyst, we have prepared a set of catalysts containing 5 mol% of chromium dopant, with the ceria crystallite size ranging from 7 to 50 nm (Table 2). The crystallites size was adjusted by varying the calcination temperature from 450 to 800 °C. The presented crystallite sizes are determined from the broadening of the Ce(111) XRD peak.

a Derived from the peak broadening of the Ce(111) XRD peak using the Scherrer equation. b The initial unselective combustion is not taken into account when calculating the selectivity. c This is the amount of oxygen which is consumed by the catalyst in the reoxidation step. That is, it is a combination of the oxygen needed to refill lattice and combust the coke present on the catalyst surface. d Traces of Cr2O3 were observed by XRD, and the colour of the sample is silver instead of light brown.
Table 2 shows that varying the calcination temperature is an effective tool for adjusting the cerias crystallite size. Note, however, that at high calcination temperatures the dopant atoms can segregate to the surface and form a separate phase.32 Indeed, traces of Cr2O3 are observed for catalyst12, calcined at 800 °C. To assess if the surface concentration chromium is related to the calcination temperature, we analysed catalysts8, 11 and 12 with X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS, see Table 3). The data shows that the surface concentration Cr does not increase with calcination temperature. The values of about 2–4 mol% are slightly lower than the expected bulk value of 5 mol%.

a Derived from the peak broadening of the Ce(111) XRD peak using the Scherrer equation. b The samples also contain carbon and sodium, therefore, the addition of the concentrations of Cr, Cr and O does not yield 100%. c Traces of Cr2O3 were observed by XRD.
Fig. 3 shows the amount of coking and combustion for the Cr-doped catalysts in the selective hydrogen combustion. As with undoped ceria, the catalysts with a larger crystallite size show a lower level of hydrocarbon coking (Fig. 3, top). Contrary to undoped ceria, however, combustion does occur at small crystallite sizes (Fig. 3, bottom). Apparently, some oxygen of the chromium-doped ceria is used for hydrocarboncombustion. Note that the combustion occurs mainly during the first 25 s of the 10 min reduction cycle (vide infra), and is probably caused by an unselective reaction with adsorbed oxygen. Indeed, the combustion levels are roughly the same for all catalysts, as is the doping level (5 mol% Cr).
Fig. 3 Hydrocarbon coking (top) and combustion (bottom) obtained using the chromium doped ceria catalystsvs. crystallite size. Determined at the selective hydrogen combustion reaction conditions (alternating feeds of 4:1:1% v/v C3H8:C3H6:H2 in Ar (10 min), and 1% v/v O2 in Ar (18 min), at 550 °C).
Adding Cr increases both the hydrogen activity and the selectivity. This is seen in Fig. 4, which shows the reaction profiles of undoped ceria 2, and the Cr-doped catalysts8 and 11. All three catalysts combust some of the hydrocarbons at the start of the reduction cycle (Fig. 4, first data point). In the remainder of the reduction cycle, however, the Cr-doped catalysts selectively combust the hydrogen. Moreover, the undoped ceria 2 shows formation of hydrogen gas, due to coking (the hydrogen conversion has a negative value, that is, hydrogen is formed).
Fig. 4 Time resolved conversion profiles for pure CeO2 (2, 12 nm crystallites, top); Ce0.95Cr0.05O2 (8, 12 nm crystallites, middle); and Ce0.95Cr0.05O2 (11, 38 nm crystallites, bottom). The negative conversions indicate the production of H2via coking. Reaction conditions: 550 °C, 10 min reduction cycles with a gas feed of 4:1:1% v/v C3H8:C3H6:H2 in Ar.
Fig. 4 shows that the hydrocarbons are mainly converted at the start of the reduction cycle. It follows that the coking also occurs here. Indeed, plotting the hydrocarbon conversion against crystallite size (Fig. 5), yields a curve with the same trend as the amount of coking against crystallite size shown in Fig. 3. Note, for example, that both the hydrocarbon conversion and the coking level remain constant for the three smallest catalyst, and then drop. The hydrogen activity of the catalysts follows the same trend, but in reverse: when the level of coking drops, the specific activity increases (Fig. 5), and vice versa. Because no oxygen is consumed in the coking process, the lower specific activity must originate from shielding of the catalysts surface by the coke. This is in agreement with the data shown in Fig. 4, where the hydrocarbon conversion (coking) occurs at the start of the reduction cycle, and the selective hydrogen combustion in the remainder of it.
Fig. 5 Initial hydrocarbon conversions and hydrogen activity of the chromium doped catalysts against crystallite size. Reaction conditions: 550 °C, 10 min reduction cycles with a gas feed of 4:1:1% v/v C3H8:C3H6:H2 in Ar.
Our data show that the larger Cr-doped crystallites show less hydrocarbon conversion and an increased specific activity. Therefore, in case of the 5 mol% Cr-doping, the larger crystals are the best suited for the selective hydrogen combustion.
The time scale of the catalysts hydrogen activity
Fig. 4 shows that the time in which the catalysts are active increases with increasing particle size. Catalyst11, consisting of larger crystallites, is active over a longer time period compared to 8. Note that catalysts10–12, with the largest crystallites, are active during the entire 10 min reduction cycle. We therefore cannot asses if these catalysts coke some of the hydrocarbons at the end of the run, as is the case for 7–9, consisting of smaller crystallites. To check if the larger crystallites indeed show less coking, we subjected catalyst11 to a 20 min reduction cycle, that is, 10 min longer than its active period. The data show no indication of ‘end of run’ coking (a net hydrogen production). Indeed, some dehydrogenation occurs: a small amount of propene and hydrogen are formed, together with some propane conversion (not shown). Note that Cr is used as a commercial dehydrogenation catalyst.7 Furthermore, an equal amount of coke is observed for either a 10 or 20 min reduction cycle. Clearly, the catalyst is stable in the reductive feed: when 11 is subjected to the dehydrogenation gas feed for an extra 10 min after the selective hydrogen combustion has stopped, no extra coke is formed. This robustness is important for when the catalysts are applied in the actual dehydrogenation process.
Cu doped ceria: the effect of dopant concentration on the physical and catalytic properties
Table 4 shows the physical properties and catalytic data of the set of copper doped ceria catalysts varying in concentration from 0.1 to 10 mol%. The data show that the crystallite size and the copper concentration are not varied independently. The crystallite size decreases with increasing copper concentration (see also Fig. 6). The addition of copper does increase the selectivity of the ceria, as was the case for Cr-doping (Table 4).

a Derived from the peak broadening of the Ce(111) XRD peak using the Scherrer equation. b The initial unselective combustion is not taken into account when calculating the selectivity. c This is the amount of oxygen which is consumed by the catalyst in the reoxidation step. That is, it is a combination of the oxygen needed to refill lattice and combust the coke present on the catalyst surface.
Fig. 6 The relationship between ceria crystallite size and dopant concentration for a set of copper doped ceria catalysts.
The coking data of Table 4 show that also in case of copper-doping, the amount of coking decreases for larger crystallites. The coking level is indeed correlated to the crystallite size, and not with dopant type or concentration: the same correlation is observed for undoped ceria, ceria with a constant doping level (5 mol% Cr), and ceria with varying doping level (0.1–10 mol% Cu).
Hydrocarboncombustionis related to the addition of a dopant. The small Cu-doped crystallites combust part of the hydrocarbon feed (not shown), similar to the Cr-doped ones, and contrary to the undoped ceria. Moreover, in case of the Cr-doping, the dopant concentration and hydrocarbon combustion were roughly equal. In case of the Cu-doping, the amount of combustion increases with the dopant concentration. This is shown in Fig. 7, where the level of coking and combustion are plotted against copper concentration, instead of crystallite size. Fig. 7 (bottom) shows the high correlation between the level of combustion and the copper concentration. Indeed, things are complicated in case of the copper doping, since the dopant concentration affects the crystallite size. However, the correlation between the hydrocarbon combustion and dopant concentration is stronger than with the crystallite size. Higher amounts of copper result in a higher level of combustion. Note again that this combustion occurs mainly at the initial part of the reduction cycle, and probably reflects an unselective reaction with adsorbed oxygen.
Fig. 7 Level of hydrocarbon coking (top) and combustion (bottom) of the copper doped ceria catalysts in the selective hydrogen combustion at 550 °C against copper concentration.
Activity of the copper doped cerias
As with chromium, adding copper increases selectivity (see Table 4 and Fig. 8).33 The hydrogen activity, however, remains constant from 1 to 10 mol% Cu (see Fig. 8). The increased level of hydrocarboncombustion and coking at high copper loadings (Fig. 7) counters the beneficial effect of adding extra copper-oxide for the hydrogen activity. Note that doping ceria with copper results in catalysts with a rather low activity. In case of more active catalysts, the hydrogen activity does increase with increasing dopant concentration.
Fig. 8 Selectivity and hydrogen activity of the copper doped cerias.
Analysis of the level of propane and propene conversion of the copper doped catalysts shows that the former increases linearly with copper concentration, whilst the latter remains unaffected by the addition of the copper (see Fig. 9). Possibly, the propene is mainly converted via coking, and the propane is mainly converted viacombustion.

The effect of crystallite size and doping on catalyst sintering
Sintering can lead to loss of activity via loss of surface area. We have assessed the effect of doping and crystallite size on sintering by subjecting the catalysts to redox cycling at high temperature (800 °C), using TPR and TEM to evaluate the amount of sintering. Fig. 10 (top) shows the TPR profiles of the undoped ceria catalysts1, 6, 6a and 6b, which increase in crystallite size from 10 nm to 245 nm. The TPR profiles contain the two typical ceria peaks at about 470 °C and 700 °C (peaks A and B, respectively). These peaks are ascribed to the reduction of surface oxygen and bulk oxygen, respectively.34 They are also explained by the reduction of small and large crystallites, since small particles are “mostly surface”, and large particles are “mostly bulk”.27 Since our reaction is performed at 550 °C, we will only concern ourselves with the TPR features below 600 °C (peak A).
Fig. 10 TPR profiles of catalysts1, 6, 6a and 6b (top), and of fresh and spent catalyst1 (bottom). The solid curve denotes fresh catalyst1, the dashed curve spent catalyst1 (after heating to 800 °C in 66% hydrogen). In between the measurements, the catalyst sample has been reoxidised at 300 °C for 30 min in 5% O2/Ar.
The smaller ceria crystallites have a lower reduction onset, and a wide reduction range (broad peak A).35 The broadness of peak A has been ascribed to the broad size distribution of smaller crystallites, and the simultaneous reduction and sintering of the small crystallites.28 Indeed, peak A of catalyst6 (30 nm), shows a broad reduction feature between 300 and 400 °C. After this catalyst is sintered into large particles by high temperature reduction (6a, 4 h at 800 °C), this broad feature disappears, and peak A has become more symmetrical (compare 6 and 6a in Fig. 10). The size of peak A decreases further upon sintering catalyst6 into even larger particles (6b, 6 h at 800 °C), but it does not disappear completely (for quantitative data of this process see Table 5). Peak A does disappear, however, when smaller crystallites are sintered by high temperature reduction. This is shown in Fig. 10 (bottom) for catalyst1. Peak A completely disappears after catalyst1 has been subjected to 30 min at 800 °C in hydrogen, where it is still present for catalyst6 after 6 h at 800 °C in hydrogen. That is, starting from the smaller crystallites (1–3, 10–18 nm), sintering occurs sooner, compared to starting from the larger crystallites (4 and 6, 22 nm and 30 nm).36 This was confirmed by TEM experiments (Fig. 11). Fresh catalyst1 sinters into much larger crystals as compared to fresh catalyst6 (starting from 10 and 30 nm crystals, respectively). Note the different scaling of the images of the unsintered (A, B) and sintered (C, D) catalysts.

Fig. 11 TEM images of catalyst1 and 6 fresh (left hand side) and sintered (1a and 6a, right hand side). The spent catalyst1 (1a) was subjected to milder sintering conditions compared to spent catalyst6a (0.5 h instead of 4 h at 800 °C in 66% H2/Ar). Still, it sinters into larger crystals (right). Note the different scaling of images A and B compared to C and D.
We have assessed the sintering at conditions which are severe compared to the catalytic selective hydrogen combustion-tests, namely heating to 800 °C in 66% H2/Ar for the sintering, as compared to 10 minute reduction cycles at 550 °C in 4:1:1 vol% of C3H8:C3H6:H2 for the catalytic tests. Indeed, catalyst1 shows no indication of sintering during the catalytic tests (the activity, amount of coking and conversions of the feed during the reduction cycles are stable).
Effect of doping on the sintering behaviour
It is known that ceria zirconia mixed oxides are more sinter stable than plain ceria.37 Our data show that doping with Cr or Cu also increases the sinter stability of the ceria (see Fig. 12). In case of the “small” undoped ceria crystallites (10–18 nm), peak A completely disappears upon sintering (Fig. 12, top). This is not the case for similarly sized Cr and Cu-doped catalysts (Fig. 12, middle and bottom). Note that peak A of the copper doped catalyst18 is far less reduced in size as compared to the chromium doped catalyst8 (quantitative data given in Table 6). The latter also showed a grey band at the reactor exit after the sintering experiment, indicating that part of the chromium has evaporated. Note again that the sintering conditions are severe compared to the selective hydrogen combustion experiments. Indeed, we previously showed that a Cr and Zr doped catalyst (Ce0.90Cr0.05Zr0.05O2) was highly selective and active over 250 selective hydrogen combustion-redox cycles (a total of 148 hours on stream), with no phase segregation or change in particle size.25

Conclusions
The activity, selectivity and stability of ceria in the selective hydrogen combustion from a mixture with propane and propene are increased by either chromium or copper doping. The doping often alters the crystallite size as well. In case of undoped ceria, small crystallites (<20 nm) mainly coke the hydrocarbons, and larger ones (>20 nm) combust them. This results in an optimal crystallite size of about 20 nm, where the least of the unwanted hydrocarbon coking and combustion occurs. This effect should be taken into account when using ceria based catalysts in reactions involving hydrocarbons. The smaller ceria crystallites show the highest level of hydrogen combustion in H2-TPR. In the selective hydrogen combustion however, they do not combust hydrocarbons at all. Instead, they show high levels of hydrocarbon coking.
Doping with Cr or Cu increases both the selectivity and activity of the ceria. Contrary to undoped ceria, however, the small doped crystallites do combust some of the hydrocarbons. Increasing the copper concentration from 0.1 mol% to 10 mol% does not affect the propene conversion, but the propane combustion increases linearly. Since this also uses up oxygen, the hydrogen activity (amount of hydrogen combusted), does not increase with increasing amount of dopant. The sintering stability of the ceria, however, is increased by the copper doping. The combustion does not vary with crystallite size in case of the Cr-CeO2catalysts, all doped with 5 mol% Cr. As coking levels do drop with increasing crystallite size, best results are obtained with the larger crystallites (up to 50 nm), showing the least amount of coking, and the highest activity. The Cr-doped catalysts are stable in the reductive gas feed. When the reduction time is doubled, no extra coke is formed. This robustness is crucial for industrial application.
Experimental
Materials and instrumentation
Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Merck and used as received. Gases were purchased from Praxair and had a purity of 99.5% or higher. The O2, He, Ar and N2 streams were purified further over mol sieves and/or BTS columns. Powder X-Ray diffraction measurements were performed using a Philips PW-series X-Ray diffractometer with a Cu tube radiation source (λ = 1.54 Å), a vertical axis goniometer and a proportional detector. The 2θ detection measurement range was 10°–93° with a 0.02° step size and a 5 second dwell time. Lattice constants and crystallite sizes were obtained after Rietveld refinement (structure fit) using PANalytical's X'pert software package. GC analysis was performed on an Interscience Compact GC equipped with TCD detectors, separating water, CO2 and C2 and C3hydrocarbons on a Porabond Q column (He carrier gas) and H2, CO, CH4, O2 and N2 on a 5Å molsieve column (Ar carrier gas). MS analysis was performed using a Pfeiffer QMS 200 mass spectrometer (m/z range 0–200). XPS measurements were performed on a KRATOS AXIS Ultra DLD spectrometer. TEM was performed on an JEOL JEM2100 transmission electron microscope.
Procedure for catalyst synthesis
The procedure for catalyst preparation was described in detail previously.25,30 The metal nitrates are weighed in a porcelain crucible and heated to about 100 °C, so that the cerium nitrate melts (mp 65 °C). The mixture is stirred until all components are dissolved or have melted (the mp of the chromium nitrate is 60 °C; copper nitrate decomposes at 115 °C). The crucible is placed in a vacuum oven set at 140 °C and the pressure is carefully lowered to <10 mbar (in 10–15 min), making sure no vigorous boiling occurs. After 4 h, the samples are placed in a furnace and calcined under static air at 700 °C (ramp rate 300 °C/h, 5 h hold). The resulting solid is pulverized, ground and sieved in fractions of 125–212 μm (selectivity assessment) and <125 μm (XPS, TPR, TEM and XRD measurements).
Procedure for testing catalytic activity
The activity and selectivity were determined using an automated cyclic redox reactor system built in-house, described in detail elsewhere.30 In a typical experiment, about 250 mg of sample (125–212 μm) was placed on a quartz wool plug in a 4 mm id quartz reactor. The reactor was placed in a water cooled oven and heated to 550 °C at 1200 °C/h, under oxygen flow. At this temperature, redox cycling was started. The selectivity was determined by GC during the 10 min reduction in 4:1:1% v/v C3H8:C3H6:H2 in Ar. The 4:1:1 ratio of reductive gases is chosen since this is the equilibrium mixture of a conventional dehydrogenation catalyst.14 After a 4 min purge step (pure Ar), the sample was reoxidised for 18 minutes in 1% v/v O2 in Ar. The redox cycle is completed by another purge step in pure Ar. The total flow rate was kept at 50 mL/min in each step. The selectivity is determined as the ratio H2 conversion:total conversion. Activity is determined as the percentage hydrogen combusted during the reduction step (hydrogen activity), and the amount of oxygen needed in the oxidation step (oxygen demand). Both selectivity and activity are averaged over eight redox cycles. The amount of coking was assessed by the amount of CO and CO2 formed in the reoxidation step, determined by MS. All signals were normalised using a small amount of helium added to the gas feed (1 vol%), and were integrated using CasaXPS v2.1.18 software.
Procedure for TPR experiments
In a typical measurement, 100 mg of sample is placed on a quartz wool plug in a 4 mm i.d. quartz reactor. The sample is calcined in situ to 300 °C (ramp rate 10 °C/min, 30 min hold time) in 5% v/v oxygen in argon (50 mL/min total flow). After cooling to room temperature and purging with pure argon, the system is allowed to equilibrate in 66% hydrogen in argon (20 mL/min total flow) for about 1 h. For the actual TPR measurement, the sample is heated with a 5 °C/min heating rate to 800 °C (no hold). When the final temperature is reached, the sample is allowed to cool to room temperature. When subsequent measurements are performed, the sample is reoxidised in 5% v/v oxygen in argon (300 °C, 30 min hold time).
