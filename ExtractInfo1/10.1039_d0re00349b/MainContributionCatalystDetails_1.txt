The given document is a review paper summarizing recent developments in SAPO-34 zeolite membranes and membrane reactors. It does not contain any original research contributions related to propane dehydrogenation catalysis. The document focuses on gas separation applications of SAPO-34 membranes, especially for CO2/CH4 and N2/CH4 separations from natural gas. It also briefly discusses the application of SAPO-34 membrane reactors for urea methanolysis to dimethyl carbonate and propane dehydrogenation reactions. However, no specific catalyst compositions, performance data, or enhancements are presented. Since the document does not contain substantial details directly related to propane dehydrogenation catalysis research, I cannot extract the requested information.
