Effect of Na Addition on Catalytic Performance of PtSn/ZSM-5 Catalyst for Propane Dehydrogenation
Abstract
PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalysts with different amounts of Na were prepared by the sequential impregnation method on HZSM-5 zeolites, and their catalytic activities and stabilities in propane dehydrogenation were investigated. The effect of the addition of sodium on the physicochemical properties was studied by means of XRD (X-ray diffraction), IR spectrum of adsorbed pyridine, NH3-TPD, H2 chemisorption, TPR (temperature-programmed reduction), etc. The results indicated that the addition of Na had an obvious impact on the catalytic performance of the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst. A suitable concentration of Na could not only reduce the Br√∂nsted acid sites and moderate/strong Lewis acid sites, thus preventing the catalyst from coking and improving the catalytic stability, but also increase the fraction of bare metallic Pt on the surface of the catalyst, thus increasing the catalytic activity. It was found that the propene selectivity and yield could reach the maximum, when the Na content was 1.0%. After reaction for 30 h, the propane conversion was still high (36.4%). However, the continuous addition of Na increased the weak Lewis acid sites and promoted the tin species to be reduced to metallic tin. In this instance, the cracking and hydrogenolysis of propane could be carried out easily, which was disadvantageous to the dehydrogenation.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
