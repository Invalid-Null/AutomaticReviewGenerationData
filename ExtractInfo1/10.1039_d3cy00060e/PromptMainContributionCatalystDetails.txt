A promoted PtFe/SiO2 catalyst with low Pt concentration for propane dehydrogenation†
Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has developed into one major way to increase propylene production because of its unique advantages. The harsh reaction conditions put forward higher requirements for the activity and stability of catalysts. Herein, we successfully prepared PtFe/SiO2 that presents excellent catalytic performances for PDH. The introduction of an Fe component is conducive to the high dispersion of Pt and restrains the migration of Pt that leads to agglomeration. Electrons are transferred from Fe to Pt species, forming an electron-rich Pt state that facilitates propane adsorption and propylene desorption. Meanwhile, electron-rich Pt sites are created in PtFe/SiO2, leading to the improvement of both propylene formation rate and mean lifetime compared to Pt/SiO2. PtFe/SiO2 exhibits good catalytic activity and high stability with nearly 100% propylene selectivity. The initial C3H6 formation rate reached 39.52 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1 and the mean lifetime was 83 h under these conditions: 500 °C, C3H8/H2/Ar = 1/1/8 and a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) for propane of 24 h−1. As the WHSV increased to 48 h−1, the initial C3H6 formation rate could reach 72.75 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1. This work paves the way for developing robust Pt-based PDH catalysts via alloying with earth-abundant metals.
1. Introduction
Propylene serves as an important basic material of three major synthetic materials (plastic, synthetic rubber and synthetic fiber). Due to the asymmetry of its molecular structure, propylene easily undergoes various chemical reactions forming chemical stocks.1–3 Because of the great demand and broad market prospects of propylene, non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has developed into one of the main ways to increase propylene production in recent years. PDH has several unique advantages, such as low production cost, abundant raw material resources and low separation cost.4–6 On account of their superiority in C–H scission, Pt-based catalysts have been used as commercial catalysts via the Oleflex process for PDH.5,6 However, the harsh reaction conditions including high temperature and a carbonaceous/reductive atmosphere easily lead to the rapid deactivation of catalysts.7 Therefore, developing robust Pt-based catalysts for PDH is still very meaningful and challenging.
As previously reported, Pt in an electron-rich state is not only beneficial to the preferential adsorption of propane but also to the desorption of propylene.8 Highly dispersed Pt in the absence of contiguous Pt–Pt patches can effectively inhibit C–C cleavage, leading to the promotion of C3H6 selectivity and anti-coking ability.9 Alloying is a common strategy for isolating Pt to avoid side reactions. Metallic elements with low electronegativity, such as Ga,10–13 In,14–16 Sn17–22 and Cu,23–25 are widely used to form alloys with Pt. Electrons can be transferred from these electronegative metals to Pt, leading to the formation of electron-rich states of Pt. In addition, considering the scarcity and high price of Pt, reducing Pt usage is favourable to improve the economy of the catalyst.26 Thus, exploiting highly active and stable Pt-based catalysts with low Pt loading is of great significance for the development of research and industry toward PDH.
Herein, we report a robust PtFe/SiO2 catalyst with an optimal Pt loading as low as 0.2 wt%, which exhibits an ∼15% propane conversion and ∼99.9% propylene selectivity (500 °C, C3H8/H2/Ar = 1/1/8 and WHSV = 24 h−1). The initial C3H6 formation rate reached 39.52 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1 and the mean life time (τ) was 83 h. Meanwhile, PtFe/SiO2 exhibited good catalytic activity and high stability with nearly 100% propylene selectivity within 100 h. As the WHSV increased to 48 h−1, the initial C3H6 formation rate could reach 72.75 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1. Evidenced by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), the introduction of the Fe component improved the dispersion of Pt species and sub-nanometer PtFe clusters were formed after H2 reduction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy results confirmed that electrons transferred from Fe to Pt, resulting in the formation of electron-rich Pt sites in PtFe/SiO2. In addition, the CO adsorption diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (CO DRIFTS) results demonstrated the creation of isolated Pt sites with a low coordination number in PtFe/SiO2. Compared to Pt nanoparticles in Pt/SiO2, the electron-rich Pt sites in PtFe/SiO2 were responsible for the promotion of activity and stability toward PDH. This work paves the way for fabricating robust PDH catalysts with low Pt loading, which are perhaps economically competitive in relevant industrial applications.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Fumed silica and tetraammineplatinum nitrate [Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2] were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Metal nitrates including Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, Co(NO3)3·6H2O, Ni(NO3)3·6H2O and Cu(NO3)3·3H2O were purchased from Sinopharm Reagent Company. C3H8, C3H6, H2, CO, and Ar were purchased from Air Liquide Co., Ltd. All the reagents and gases were used without further purifications.
2.2 Synthesis of PtFe/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2
In a typical synthesis, 20.2 mg of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 1.96 mg of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 were dissolved in 1 mL of deionized water and the mixture was sonicated. Then, the mixture was dropwise added into 500 mg of fumed silica under continuous stirring. The as-formed gel-like product was dried at room temperature and ground. The powders were calcined in a muffle furnace at 300 °C for 1 h. Before the PDH tests, each catalyst was reduced in hydrogen (H2/Ar = 1/9) at 600 °C for 3 h or other fixed times. The derived catalyst, named as PtFe/SiO2, contained 0.2 wt% Pt and 0.56 wt% Fe.
The loading of Pt or Fe was tuned by adding different amounts of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O or Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2. Adding 4.04 mg and 101 mg of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O into silica resulted in 0.11 wt% and 2.8 wt% Fe, respectively. Adding 0.98 mg and 4.9 mg of Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 into silica resulted in 0.1 wt% and 0.5 wt% Pt, respectively. A reference catalyst containing 0.2 wt% Pt was named as Pt/SiO2. Pt–M catalysts (M = Co, Ni or Cu) with 0.2 wt% Pt were prepared using the same method.
2.3 Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired on a Rigaku Smartlab powder diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 0.15418 nm). The data collection range was 20–80° and the scanning rate was 10° min−1.
Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images and elemental mapping results were gained by using a JEOL ARM-200F microscope equipped with a probe-forming aberration corrector. The accelerating voltage was 200 kV. The size distributions were calculated after counting more than 100 clusters or nanoparticles.
CO DRIFTS measurements were conducted on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 spectrometer, which was equipped with a mercury–cadmium–telluride (MCT-A) detector. A diffuse reflectance cell (Harrick system) with ZnSe windows was applied. Liquid nitrogen was used as a cooling reagent. The sample powder (ca. 20 mg) was treated with hydrogen (H2/Ar = 1/9) for 1 h at 450 °C. After cooling down to 25 °C under He (30 mL min−1), the background spectra were collected via 32 scans with a resolution of 8 cm−1. CO (CO/He = 1/19, total flow of 15 mL min−1) was then introduced and the adsorption spectra were collected with the same resolution for 5 min. The samples were purged with He (30 mL min−1) and the CO desorption spectra were collected.
The X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra were measured at the BL11B station at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF, 3.5 GeV, 250 mA maximum). Spectra of PtO2 and Pt foil were recorded in transmission mode using an ionization chamber. The Pt L3-edge spectra of the samples were collected in fluorescence mode. Data processing was based on procedures using ATHENA in the Demeter 0.9.25 software package.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were carried out on an EscaLab Xi+ photoelectron spectrometer from Thermo Fisher, USA (225 W, Al Kα radiation). The core level binding energies were determined by calibrating the spectrometer with C1s at 284.8 eV.
All Raman spectra were collected on a LabRam HR Evolution Raman spectrometer (Horiba France). The data collection range was from 800 to 2000 cm−1. The wavelength of the excitation laser is 532 nm.
Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) experiments were performed on a Pyris Diamond TG-DTA/DSC. All tested samples were dried beforehand at 100 °C in an oven for 10 h. During the measurements, air (flow rate of 100 mL min−1) was flowed in and the whole process was conducted under temperature-programmed control from room temperature to 800 °C, with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1.
A gas adsorption instrument from Micromeritics (ASAP2020) was used for the nitrogen sorption measurements at 77 K. The samples were degassed at 200 °C for 6 h under vacuum. The calculation of specific surface area was based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method.
2.4 Catalytic measurements.
The PDH tests were conducted in a vertical, quartz fixed-bed reactor with an internal diameter of 9 mm. Each catalyst was diluted with quartz sand and the total mass was kept as 1000 mg. The catalysts were reduced in hydrogen (H2/Ar = 1/9, total flow rate of 40 mL min−1) at 600 °C for 3 h or other certain times. After cooling to 500 °C, the reaction was processed under 1 bar (C3H8/H2/Ar = 1/1/8 or C3H8/Ar = 2/3) with a total flow rate of 40 mL min−1 at 500 °C. Different WHSVs for propane were obtained by adjusting the mass of loaded catalysts. All the gaseous products went through online analysis using a chromatograph equipped with a FID (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). C3H8, C3H6, C2H6, C2H4, and CH4 were detected as reaction products. The C3H8 conversion, C3H6 selectivity, and carbon balance were calculated via an external standard method based on eqn (1)–(3), respectively. The carbon balance ranged from 95% to 104% for all tests. To quantify the stability, we calculated the deactivation coefficient (kd) and mean lifetime (τ) assuming that first-order deactivation kinetics occurred. As such, the values of kd and τ are obtained according to eqn (4) and (5).

3. Results and discussions
PtFe and Pt species were supported on commercial fumed SiO2via a simple impregnation method, denoted as PtFe/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2, respectively. The XRD patterns of the catalysts exhibited a hump at 20–30°, which was typical for amorphous SiO2 (Fig. 1a). After H2 reduction at 600 °C, a characteristic peak of Pt(111) at 39.8° emerged for Pt/SiO2, indicating the sintering of Pt species (Fig. 1a). The HRTEM image further confirmed the presence of large Pt nanoparticles (∼8 nm) in Pt/SiO2, exposing the (111) and (200) lattice fringes of Pt (Fig. 1b). In contrast, none of the Pt and Fe peaks appeared in the XRD pattern of PtFe/SiO2. This suggested that the Pt species were highly dispersed with the aid of the Fe component even after H2 reduction at 600 °C.

As illustrated in the HAADF-STEM images, PtFe/SiO2 showed a uniform dispersion of PtFe clusters with an average size of 0.88 nm (Fig. 2a and b and S1a†). As a comparison, although the average size of Pt was only 2.83 nm in Pt/SiO2, the size of Pt was non-uniform and varied greatly (Fig. 2c and d). There were not only atomically dispersed Pt but also Pt particles with a size of up to 8 nm (Fig. 2c and S1b and c†). The large Pt particles were formed in Pt/SiO2via Oswald ripening during H2 reduction. These results were consistent with the XRD outcomes, indicating that the introduction of Fe component was propitious for the high dispersion of Pt. It was also evidenced in the elemental mapping of PtFe/SiO2 that the distribution of Pt and Fe species was close to each other after H2 reduction (Fig. 3a and b). The creation of heterogeneity in the SiO2 support by importing Fe enhanced the interaction between the active metal and support.27 This was perhaps the reason for the uniform size distribution of PtFe/SiO2 but uneven size of Pt/SiO2.

According to the XPS spectra (Fig. 3c), the Pt 4f peaks shifted to a lower binding energy after the addition of Fe (75.4 to 75.1 eV for 4f5/2, 72.1 to 71.8 eV for 4f7/2), which indicated that electrons transferred from Fe species to Pt. This was also supported by the results of XANES. The white line intensity of PtFe/SiO2 was lower than that of Pt/SiO2, suggesting that the valence of Pt in PtFe/SiO2 was lower than that in Pt/SiO2 (Fig. 3d). Thus, Pt possessed an unsaturated coordination structure and an electron-rich state in PtFe/SiO2. For the Fe 2p3/2 XPS spectrum of the PtFe/SiO2 catalyst, the Fe 2p3/2 binding energies at 706.9, 709.9 and 711.7 eV were assigned to Fe0 species, Fe2+ species and Fe3+ species, respectively28,29 (Fig. S2†). The peak at 715.1 eV was assigned to an Fe3+ satellite peak. This indicated the co-existence of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in the catalyst. The positive valence of Fe in PtFe/SiO2 confirmed that the Fe species acted as an electron donor to Pt.
CO DRIFTS was also applied to characterize the status of Pt sites in the catalysts. After the saturation adsorption of CO molecules, apart from the gaseous adsorption peaks of CO (2173 and 2115 cm−1), there were two peaks in Pt/SiO2 (2070 and 2048 cm−1) but only one in PtFe/SiO2 (2048 cm−1) (Fig. 3e and f). The pronounced peak centred at 2070 cm−1 was attributed to C–O vibration on Pt nanoparticles, reflecting the metallic Pt sites with fine Pt–Pt coordination.30,31 The peak appearing at 2048 cm−1 was ascribed to the unsaturated coordinated metallic Pt sites.11,12,23,25,32 During the desorption process, strongly adsorbed CO still remained on the Pt/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. S3†). In contrast, CO adsorbed on the unsaturated coordinated metallic Pt sites centred at 2048 cm−1 was easily removed (Fig. S3†). These results verified the homogeneity of unsaturated coordinated Pt sites in PtFe/SiO2. The difference in physical and chemical structure had a certain influence on the catalytic activity.
The catalytic activity was studied under the same experimental conditions. In order to eliminate the effect of mass transport limitations, experiments with different WHSVs for propane were conducted. Under these conditions (500 °C, C3H8/H2/Ar = 1/1/8), the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion was 21.1%. When the WHSV was lower than 6 h−1, the C3H8 conversion was higher than the equilibrium conversion (Fig. 4a). The time that gas molecules stayed on the catalyst surface increased with the decrease of WHSV, resulting in the occurrence of deep dehydrogenation or cracking. The occurrence of side reactions resulted in carbon deposition, which led to the elimination of the active sites and the decrease of C3H6 selectivity. With the increment of WHSV, the C3H8 conversion decreased but the C3H6 selectivity showed the opposite trend (Fig. 4a). In addition, the influence of catalyst size on the catalytic activity was also investigated. The catalyst was pressed and then sifted into different sizes for operation. The results showed that catalyst size had little effect on the catalytic activity (Fig. 4b).

In order to quantify the inherent kinetic rates and stability of catalysts, the C3H6 formation rate and mean lifetime were adopted. PtFe/SiO2 had the highest initial C3H6 formation rate and mean lifetime, followed by Pt/SiO2, and Fe/SiO2 was basically inactive. The initial C3H6 formation rate of PtFe/SiO2 was around 39.52 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1, which was about twice as much as that of Pt/SiO2 (19.14 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1) (Fig. 5a). After reaction for 10 h, the C3H6 formation rate was reduced to 36.26 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1 for PtFe/SiO2 and 11.80 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1 for Pt/SiO2 (Fig. S4a†). Compared to the initial C3H6 formation rate, the decrease of C3H6 formation rate was only 8.25% for PtFe/SiO2 but 38.35% for Pt/SiO2. It was obvious that the deactivation rate of Pt/SiO2 was faster. Corresponding to this, the mean lifetimes of the catalysts were compared; up to 83 h for PtFe/SiO2 but only 20 h for Pt/SiO2 (Fig. 5a).

(a) The initial C3H6 formation rate and mean lifetime of PtFe/SiO2, Pt/SiO2 and Fe/SiO2 with hydrogen dilution; (b) the initial C3H6 formation rate and mean lifetime of PtFe/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2 without hydrogen dilution; (c) Raman spectra of the catalysts after 10 h reaction (conditions: 500 °C, C3H8/H2/Ar = 1/1/8, WHSV = 24 h−1); (d) TGA results of the catalysts after 10 h reaction (conditions: 500 °C, C3H8/H2/Ar = 1/1/8, WHSV = 24 h−1); (e) C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity during the long-term stability test of PtFe/SiO2 (conditions: 500 °C, C3H8/H2/Ar = 1/1/8, WHSV = 48 h−1); (f) selectivity for C2H6, C2H4 and CH4 during the long-term stability test of PtFe/SiO2 (conditions: 500 °C, C3H8/H2/Ar = 1/1/8, WHSV = 48 h−1).
Given that hydrogen has the ability to remove carbon deposits, propane without hydrogen dilution (C3H8/Ar = 2/3) was applied for operation in order to highlight the enhancement of catalytic activity with the addition of Fe. For PtFe/SiO2, the initial C3H6 formation rate (39.94 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1) was similar to that with hydrogen dilution. On the other hand, the mean lifetime (42 h) decreased, which was only half of that with hydrogen dilution (Fig. 5b). For Pt/SiO2, the initial C3H6 formation rate was 14.14 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1 and the mean lifetime was only 3 h (Fig. 5b). Both the initial C3H6 formation rate and mean lifetime were lower than those obtained with hydrogen dilution. Compared to the initial C3H6 formation rate, the C3H6 formation rate decreased to 32.67 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1 and the decrease of C3H6 formation rate was 18.20% for PtFe/SiO2 after 10 h reaction, which was higher than that with hydrogen dilution (Fig. S4b†). However, there was a huge drop in the C3H6 formation rate for Pt/SiO2 after reaction for 10 h. The C3H6 formation rate was only 0.54 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1 and the attenuation ratio of C3H6 formation rate was as high as 96.18% for Pt/SiO2 (Fig. S4b†). As described before, without hydrogen dilution, the carbon deposition rate increased rapidly, resulting in a decrease in the number of active sites and thus a decrease in the mean lifetime. Therefore, it was clear that the introduction of Fe greatly improved the activity and stability of the catalyst.
Based on Raman analysis of the used catalysts, carbon deposition occurred on the catalyst after the reaction (Fig. 5c). The TG results showed that the weight loss of PtFe/SiO2 (2.2%) was lower than that of Pt/SiO2 (3.8%) (Fig. 5d). This meant that Pt nanoparticles present in Pt/SiO2 normally accelerated the deactivation rate, since the high selectivity for C–C cleavage led to severe coke formation.18,30 This also explained the poor C3H6 selectivity of Pt/SiO2.
In order to better evaluate the long period stability of PtFe/SiO2, a long-time reaction (100 h) with higher WHSV (48 h−1) was carried out. The initial C3H6 formation rate was as high as 72.75 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1. With the increase of WHSV, the initial C3H6 formation rate was also increased. As the reaction time was prolonged, the C3H6 selectivity gradually increased in the first 20 h, turning from 97.41% to 99.04% (Fig. 5e), and it remained stable during the following 80 h. After the test, some carbon species were observed (Fig. S5†). Accordingly, the CH4, C2H4 and C2H6 selectivity all decreased at first and then reached a stable state. The selectivity for CH4, C2H4 and C2H6 finally remained at 0.50%, 0.14% and 0.32%, respectively (Fig. 5f).
To investigate the impact of Fe loading on catalytic activity, the Fe loading was adjusted to either five times (2.8 wt%) or one fifth (0.11 wt%) of the original (0.56 wt%). A decline of both the initial C3H6 formation rate and mean lifetime was observed when the Fe loading was 0.11 wt%. The initial C3H6 formation rate was only 14.41 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1 and the mean lifetime was about 11 h (Fig. 6a). After reaction for 10 h, the C3H6 formation rate was reduced to 6.24 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1 (Fig. S6a†). This phenomenon indicated that an insufficient Fe component was unable to create uniform Pt sites with unsaturated coordination. As the Fe loading increased to 2.8 wt%, worse PDH performances were also achieved. The initial C3H6 formation rate was 21.48 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1 and the mean lifetime was about 25 h (Fig. 6a). The C3H6 formation rate dropped to 14.85 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1 after 10 h reaction (Fig. S6a†). Either a too high or a too low Fe loading had a detrimental effect on the catalytic performances. When the Fe loading was low, there were not enough Fe atoms around the Pt atoms. The relatively isolated Pt atoms undergo thermal migration induced by the high temperature of the reaction, which led to the formation of larger Pt particles in sintering, thus reducing the catalytic activity. When the Fe loading was high, the alloy formation of Fe and Pt was favored, and a large number of Fe atoms gathered in the process of thermal migration leading to the coverage of the exposed Pt sites on the alloy surface, resulting in a significant decrease in catalyst activity. The optimized Fe loading was 0.56 wt%.
Fig. 6 Catalytic performances toward PDH. (a) The initial C3H6 formation rate and mean lifetime of PtFe/SiO2 with different Fe loadings; (b) the initial C3H6 formation rate and mean lifetime of PtFe/SiO2 with different Pt loadings.
According to previous studies, the Pt concentration is usually higher than 0.5 wt% in most publications related to Pt-based PDH catalysts.11–13,18–22,32–38 Due to the scarcity and high price of Pt, it is important to improve the atomic utilization to improve the economy of the catalyst. The high activity of catalysts should be ensured with the reduction of Pt amount in PDH. The Pt concentration in our PtFe/SiO2 was set as 0.2 wt%. The effect of different Pt loadings on catalytic activity was also studied. As the Pt loading increased to 0.5 wt%, a 16.77 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1 initial C3H6 formation rate and 68 h mean lifetime were achieved, which were both lower than those of the catalyst with a Pt loading of 0.2 wt% (Fig. 6b). And the C3H6 formation rate was lowered to 14.83 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1 after 10 h reaction (Fig. S6b†). When the Pt loading was reduced to 0.1 wt%, the initial C3H6 formation rate was obviously increased but the mean lifetime quickly decreased. The initial C3H6 formation rate reached 65.33 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1 and the mean lifetime was reduced to 22 h (Fig. 6b). After the reaction for 10 h, the C3H6 formation rate decreased to 43.73 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1, which was comparable to the performance of the catalyst with a Pt loading of 0.2 wt% (Fig. S6b†). Therefore, the Pt loading exhibited a significant impact on the initial C3H6 formation rate and catalytic stability. As the Pt loading exceeded 0.2 wt%, the atomic utilization of Pt was low, resulting in poor economy. When the Pt loading was lower than 0.2 wt%, although the atomic utilization of Pt was higher, the catalyst mean lifetime was significantly shortened, which also led to the increase of catalyst replacement frequency and the poor economy. Based on the above results, considering the catalytic activity, stability and economy, the catalyst with a 0.2 wt% Pt concentration was the optimal.
In order to further optimize the structure of the catalyst to enhance the reactivity, the effect of reduction time was investigated. In addition to the normal reduction of 3 h, PtFe/SiO2 was reduced for 1, 5 and 12 h. They were denoted as PtFe-1 h, PtFe-5 h and PtFe-12 h, respectively. As exhibited from the results of N2 sorption isotherms (Fig. S7†), the BET specific surface area (SBET) varied from 185 m2 g−1 to 194 m2 g−1. This suggested that prolonging the reduction time did not cause sintering and collapse of the SiO2 support. With all catalysts showing high propylene selectivity (higher than 99.6%), PtFe-3 h was optimal based on the initial C3H6 formation rate and mean lifetime compared to the other catalysts (Fig. 7a). PtFe-3 h still had the best activity after the reaction for 10 h and the C3H6 formation rate was 36.26 molpropylene gPt−1 h−1 (Fig. S8a†). This finding was in accordance with the Raman spectra of the used catalysts, which revealed that the least profound carbon signals were obtained on PtFe-3 h (Fig. S8b†). This suggested that both shorter and overlong reduction times led to activity deterioration.
Fig. 7 PDH performance comparison and structural characterization of catalysts with different reduction times. (a) The initial C3H6 formation rate and mean lifetime of PtFe/SiO2 with different reduction times; (b) CO adsorption DRIFTS results of PtFe/SiO2 with different reduction times.
CO DRIFTS was also used to characterize the catalysts with different reduction times. PtFe-1 h exhibited CO adsorption on both Pt nanoparticles and unsaturated coordinated Pt sites, which was similar to that of Pt/SiO2 (Fig. 7b). This revealed that H2 reduction for 1 h was too short to create uniform unsaturated coordinated Pt sites, resulting in inferior activity. With the increase of reduction time, the CO adsorption peak on unsaturated coordinated Pt sites became stronger. This strong CO adsorption was very likely to represent the growth and crystallization of metal components. It was proved by the HR-TEM image of PtFe-12 h that large nanoparticles were present (Fig. S9†). The number of Pt sites with unsaturated coordination in the PtFe alloy decreased due to sintering, resulting in the inferior PDH activity with overlong H2 reduction. Therefore, the adsorption and desorption capacity of the catalyst should be moderate to be more conducive to catalytic activity.
Along with Fe, some other transition metals were also used to form alloys with Pt. With the same composition and preparation method, Pt–M (M = Co, Ni or Cu) catalysts were prepared and the catalytic performances were compared under the same conditions. As seen in Fig. 8, PtFe/SiO2 had the highest initial C3H6 formation rate and the initial C3H6 formation rate followed this order: Pt–Fe > Pt–Cu > Pt–Co > Pt–Ni > Pt. Meanwhile, the highest C3H6 selectivity was achieved by PtFe/SiO2, which was close to 100%. The C3H6 selectivity of the catalysts followed the trend: Pt–Fe > Pt > Pt–Cu > Pt–Co > Pt–Ni (Fig. S10†). The reason for the difference may be due to the electronegativity of the alloyed metals and the smaller size of the PtFe alloy during reaction (Fig. S11†).
Fig. 8 The initial C3H6 formation rate of Pt–M/SiO2 with different transition metals (Ni, Co and Cu).
Compared to the performance of Pt-based catalysts in the literature, it was found that the initial C3H6 formation rate of PtFe/SiO2 was one of the best (Table S1†). As described before, when the WHSV was 3 h−1, the C3H8 conversion exceeded the thermodynamic equilibrium limit due to the appearance of side reactions. When the WHSV increased from 6 h−1 to 12 h−1, although the C3H8 conversion was close to the thermodynamic equilibrium limit, the mean lifetime varied greatly. This was because when the WHSV was 6 h−1, the amount of C3H8 that the active sites could handle was much higher than the amount of C3H8 that entered. With a further increase of WHSV, the C3H6 formation rate gradually increased, but the mean lifetime and the ratio of C3H8 conversion to the thermodynamic equilibrium limit conversion decreased. This was caused by the formation of carbon deposition. In sum, in order to achieve an efficient and stable activity of the catalyst, it was necessary to regulate the coordination environment and catalytic reaction conditions. To achieve near thermodynamic equilibrium conversion, not only are a sufficient number of unsaturated coordinated Pt sites needed for C–H activation, but also the active sites should be protected from being covered by carbon deposition. This required Pt to be highly spatially dispersed while maintaining a certain size, and the coordination environment could limit the thermal migration of Pt. Meanwhile, the contact time between the reaction gas and the catalyst was effectively controlled by selecting an appropriate WHSV so as to achieve high propylene selectivity. Propane mixed with a certain proportion of hydrogen could effectively inhibit the occurrence of carbon deposition and improve the mean life time of the catalyst.
4. Conclusion
From what had been discussed above, the introduction of Fe resulted in not only highly dispersed Pt species, but also electron transfer to Pt forming an electron-rich state, which was conducive to the adsorption of propane and the desorption of propylene. The alloying between Pt and Fe created unsaturated coordinated Pt sites, forming highly dispersed PtFe clusters (<1 nm). The derived PtFe clusters showed great resistance to sintering under reaction conditions. The unsaturated coordinated Pt sites in PtFe/SiO2 turned out to be excellent active sites for PDH. The optimized Pt–Fe loading was 0.2/0.56 wt% and a 3 h H2 reduction was proved to be an appropriate pre-treatment condition. When the stability of the unsaturated coordinated Pt structure was ensured, the propane dehydrogenation reaction could proceed efficiently. Our presented catalyst system paves the way for fabricating robust PDH catalysts with minimized Pt usage and earth-abundant promoters, which can be achieved via a simple impregnation method. Such a system also shows great promise in other energy-related catalytic processes where Pt-based catalysts are involved.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
