 Based on the multiple document extracts provided, I have synthesized the key information into the following unified XML entry:

The documents discussed the synthesis and application of silver-functionalized indium oxide derived from a metal-organic framework as an electrochemical glucose sensor. There was no mention of propane dehydrogenation, oxidative propane dehydrogenation, conversion of propane to propylene, or any related catalysts. Therefore, the documents do not appear to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation research.
