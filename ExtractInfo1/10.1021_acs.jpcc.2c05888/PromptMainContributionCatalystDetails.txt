Propane Transformation on In-Modified Zeolite BEA
Abstract
In-modified zeolites possess promising catalytic properties for light alkane dehydrogenation and aromatization. However, the role of different indium species, which are present in zeolite pores after activation, remains unknown. Here, the transformation of propane on BEA zeolite containing either In+ or InO+ species in zeolite pores has been monitored with 13C MAS NMR at 298–773 K. It is inferred that In+/H-BEA zeolite with In+ sites is inactive for alkane conversion at T < 723 K. The transformation of the alkane on InO+/H-BEA zeolite occurs by two parallel routes: dehydrogenation of propane followed by the formed alkene aromatization to simple aromatic hydrocarbons and the alkane oxidation resulting in C2–C3 carboxylic acids. Propane activation by either C–H or C–C bond cleavage on InO+ sites and pathways of carboxylic acid formation from the products of the alkane dissociative adsorption are discussed.

ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Light C2–C6 alkanes, being present in natural and petroleum gas and produced by crude oil processing, are abundant and a cheap feedstock for the chemical industry. Light alkane transformation into valuable aromatic hydrocarbons is the sound route of alkane utilization, which is under intense investigation. It was found that zeolites modified with metals of the 11–13 groups (Ag, Zn, Ga, and In) are effective catalysts for light alkane aromatization with high selectivity toward BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) and low yield of undesired methane. (1−8)
According to the available experimental data, (9) In-modified zeolites demonstrate superior activity and selectivity for the conversion of light alkanes to BTEX. However, in contrast to Zn- and Ga-containing zeolites, the performance of In-catalysts toward C2–C6 alkane aromatization has been studied in very few publications. (9−15) It was established that propane dehydrogenation proceeded at a higher rate than cracking, when indium was introduced into ZSM-5 zeolite. (10) In-ZSM-5 exhibited relatively high propene and BTX selectivities; however, a deactivation of the catalyst was observed due to the reduction of cationic or oxide-like indium species to metallic indium. (10,11) Similar results were obtained for n-pentane and n-hexane conversion over In-ZSM-5 zeolite (12) and ethane conversion over In-modified ZSM-5, BEA, MOR, and CHA zeolites. (14,15)
In these studies, different methods were applied to load indium into the zeolite pores: ion exchange or wetness impregnation with In(NO3)3 solution, mechanical mixing with In2O3 or InCl3, and solid-state exchange reaction with In2O3 under a reductive or oxidative atmosphere. These methods lead to different indium species being loaded into a zeolite and, therefore, to different properties of the zeolite as the catalyst. An In2O3-containing zeolite prepared by mechanical mixing was demonstrated to provide the highest BTX selectivity and alkene yield, (9,13) and In3+ sites were suggested to be the species enhancing alkane dehydrogenation activity. The reductive treatment of a mechanical mixture of zeolite and In2O3 (11,12) was found to lead to an increase in BTX selectivity and the yield. In2O species formed as the result of In2O3 reduction were postulated to be responsible for rapid alkane dehydrogenation. (12)
Further studies (16−22) were focused on the characterization of the state of indium in zeolites and revealed the following mechanism of indium species transformation. After loading In2O3 as metallic or cationic species and the reductive treatment with H2, indium is stabilized as In+ on the cation-exchange positions of the zeolite framework. This occurs through the reductive solid-state exchange reaction of zeolite BAS and In2O or metallic In(0). (20) In+ sites sustain further reduction up to 973 K, (22) but they are easily oxidized with O2 to the InO+ state, which is a reversible process. (16,17,20) A recent study (23) of methane activation in zeolite CHA has shown that the formation of indium-oxo [In2(μ-O)2]2+ clusters is also possible for paired Si–O–Al sites. Thus, it is crucial to investigate the properties of In+ and InO+ ([In2(μ-O)2]2+) sites as the main state of indium in zeolites, with regard to alkane conversion.
So far, the properties of In+ and InO+ sites in ZSM-5 zeolite were studied for methane activation and transformation. Baba et al. (24,25) showed the ability of cationic indium sites to incorporate methane into the products of ethylene conversion through the formation of the surface methoxy species. It was found in our previous work (26,27) that InO+ sites were active for methane transformation through C–H bond dissociation, resulting in the methyl oxyindium intermediate, H3C–InO, which was further oxidized to methoxy oxyindium species, H3C–O–InO. In conclusion, the available results indicate that these materials possess interesting properties, making them applicable for the dehydrogenation, aromatization, and, probably, oxidation of light alkanes on an industrial scale.
To facilitate the process of industrial catalyst development, we have performed this study of the mechanism of propane transformation on In-modified BEA zeolite with solid-state 13C MAS NMR spectroscopy, which is a versatile tool to detect and identify the reaction intermediates. (28−34) The ability to activate and transform alkane molecules was analyzed for the zeolite sample loaded with either In+ or InO+ species. The state of indium in zeolite was confirmed with 1H MAS NMR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods. Surface species and products formed from propane at temperatures of 298–723 K were monitored with 13C MAS NMR in situ and analyzed with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) after the product extraction from the zeolite. The obtained data clarify the role of various indium species in different pathways of alkane transformation on In-modified zeolite.

2.1. Materials and Reagents
Tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEA-OH) water solution (30 wt %, Aldrich Chemical Company Inc), sodium aluminate (Na2O·Al2O3·3H2O, Fisher Scientific Co), colloidal silica water solution (28.9 wt % SiO2, Alfa Aesar), NaCl and NH4NO3 (chemically pure, Reachim, Russia), and In2O3 (99.9%, Aldrich Chemical Company Inc.) were used for parent BEA zeolite and In-containing BEA zeolite syntheses. Industrially produced gases, such as methane, propane, Ar, H2, and O2 (all 99.9%), were used for the preparation of the samples of In-containing BEA zeolite without purification. Benzene (anhydrous, 99.8% purity) was purchased from Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc. and used after the purification by freezing and thawing circles at the liquid nitrogen temperature. The following reagents selectively labeled with 13C atoms were used: propane-1-13C and propane-2-13C (both >99% 13C) from Aldrich Chemical Co. Inc. and propene-3-13C (>99% 13C) from ICON Isotope Inc. These reagents were used after possible impurity removal by freezing and thawing circles at the liquid nitrogen temperature.
2.2. Synthesis of the Parent H-BEA Zeolite
A sample of BEA zeolite was synthesized according to the procedure described in ref (35). TEA-OH was used as the templating agent, and the hydrothermal synthesis of the zeolite was performed for the reaction mixture with a molar composition of 48.5 SiO2/1 Al2O3/5.65 TEA2O/1.64 Na2O/605 H2O at 423 K for 6 days. The as-synthesized sample was filtered, washed with distilled water, and further exchanged with 0.4 M NaCl water solution at 343 K for 16 h. Afterward, the prepared Na-BEA sample was filtered, washed with distilled water, and dried at 373 K for several hours, followed by calcination at 823 K for 6 h. The H-BEA sample was obtained through the Na-BEA sample exchange with 0.2 M NH4NO3 water solution at 343 K for 2 h, repeated twice, followed by filtering, washing with distilled water, and drying at 373 K and calcination at 773 K for 3 h.
Elemental analysis (inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry, ICP–OES) of the H-BEA sample showed 1.62 wt %-Al, 32.4 wt %-Si, 0.004 wt %-Na, and no Fe impurities. The Si/Al atomic ratio was calculated to be 19. 29Si and 27Al MAS NMR demonstrated a Si/Al framework ratio of 23 and 3% of extra-framework aluminum for the sample (Figure S1a,b).
2.3. Indium Loading into H-BEA Zeolite
The synthesized H-BEA zeolite was modified with indium according to the following procedure. A sample of the parent H-BEA zeolite was mechanically mixed with indium(III) oxide (In2O3) powder for 1 h. The weights of the zeolite and oxide were selected to provide an In/Al atomic ratio of 1.0. The In2O3/H-BEA mixture, having yellowish color, was loaded into a Pyrex glass tube reactor (external diameter 15 mm, 160 mm length). The reactor was first purged upward with Ar at a flow rate of 60 mL min–1 for 10 min. Then, the flow was switched to H2 (50 mL min–1), and the temperature was raised stepwise to 443, 523, 623, and 773 K with a ramping rate of 7 K min–1 and maintained at each step for 30–60 min. Afterward, the reactor was cooled to room temperature under H2 stream. The obtained In/H-BEA sample had white color.
Elemental analysis (ICP–OES) of the In/H-BEA sample showed 1.64 wt %-Al, 33.8 wt %-Si, 0.01 wt %-Na, 6.58 wt %-In, and no Fe impurities. Si/Al and In/Al atomic ratios were calculated to be 20 and 0.9, respectively. 29Si and 27Al MAS NMR demonstrated a Si/Al framework ratio of 20 and 4% of extra-framework aluminum for the sample (Figure S1c,d).
2.4. Preparation of the Samples with In/H-BEA
For spectroscopic experiments, the samples of In/H-BEA zeolite were activated according to the following procedure: (i) evacuation at 673 K for 22 h under vacuum with a residual pressure above the sample of <10–3 Pa; (ii) reduction with pure H2 under a static pressure of 820 mbar for 1 h at 773 K, followed by evacuation at 673 K for 3 h; (iii) repeated reduction under the same conditions but followed by evacuation at 673 K for 11 h; (iv) oxidation with pure O2 under a static pressure of 800 mbar for 0.5 h at 623 K, followed by evacuation at 673 K for 5 h. The samples obtained after vacuum and subsequent reductive treatment were designated as In+/H-BEA, whereas further oxidized samples were marked as InO+/H-BEA.
For NMR experiments, a portion of the zeolite (35 mg) was filled into a high-axially symmetric glass ampule made of a Pyrex tube of 3.0 mm outer diameter and 10 mm length and treated according to the activation procedure described above. After activation, the zeolite sample was loaded with the selected reagent, propane-1-13C, propane-2-13C, or propene-3-13C, and the concentration of adsorbed species was 260 μmol g–1. The adsorption was performed from the calibrated volume of the vacuum line and controlled with a vacuum gauge (Thermovac 101, Leybold, Germany). The ampule with the zeolite sample inside was kept in liquid nitrogen (77 K) during the adsorption. When the selected reagent was fully transferred into the sample, the ampule was sealed off with a micro-torch flame. Such a glass ampule could be tightly inserted into a 4 mm zirconia rotor for in situ MAS NMR analysis.
For XPS experiments, a portion of the zeolite (10 mg) was filled into a Pyrex ampule and treated according to the activation procedure described above. After the treatment, the ampule was sealed off with a micro-torch flame to preserve the sample until the measurement.
For GC–MS analysis, a sample of In/H-BEA zeolite (250 mg) was activated inside a Pyrex-glass ampule, as described above, including treatment with O2 to obtain the InO+/H-BEA zeolite sample. Propane was adsorbed on the sample (500 μmol g–1), and the ampule was sealed off. The ampule was heated at 523 K for 1.5 h.
The samples of H-BEA and In/H-BEA zeolites were studied with XRD, without any additional treatments apart from those described in Sections 2.2 and 2.3. For 29Si and 27Al MAS NMR experiments, the H-BEA and In/H-BEA samples were preliminarily saturated with water under a moist atmosphere for 24 h.
2.5. XRD Analysis
The XRD patterns were recorded on the Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer (40 kV, 40 mA, Cu Kα1 radiation of λ = 1.5418 Å) by scanning over an angular range of 5–55°, with a step size of 0.05°, and a dwell time of 3 s per increment.
2.6. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
The SPECS (Germany) photoelectron spectrometer (Mg Kα radiation, hν = 1253.6 eV, 150 W) was used to record X-ray photoelectron spectra. Right before the XPS studies, the ampule containing the activated zeolite was unsealed, and the zeolite powder was supported onto double-sided conducting copper scotch tape under Ar flow. The zeolite sample was immediately transferred to the spectrometer and evacuated under vacuum (10–8 mbar). The positions of the peaks of Au 4f7/2 (BE = 84.0 eV) and Cu 2p3/2 (BE = 932.67 eV) core levels were used for binding energy (BE) scale calibration. The BE of peaks was calibrated by the position of the C 1s peak (BE = 284.8 eV), corresponding to the surface hydrocarbon-like deposits (C–C and C–H bonds). (36) The pass energy of the analyzer was 20 eV for the survey spectra, whereas the pass energy was 10 eV for the narrow spectral regions (Si 2p, C 1 s, In 3d, and O 1 s). Analysis of the data obtained with XPS was carried out with the XPS Peak 4.1 software.
2.7. Solid-state NMR Spectroscopy
Solid-state magic angle spinning NMR (MAS NMR) spectra were recorded using the Bruker Avance-400 spectrometer (9.4 T) equipped with a broad-band double-resonance MAS probe. The chemical shift was referenced to TMS for 1H, 13C, and 29Si and 0.1 M Al(NO3)3 water solution for 27Al, with an accuracy of ±0.1 ppm.
For 27Al and 29Si MAS NMR experiments, a powder zeolite sample was filled inside a 4 mm zirconia rotor, closed with a cap, and spun at 8–10 kHz. 27Al MAS NMR spectra parameters were the following: π/12 pulse (0.6 μs), 10 000 scans, and 0.5 s recycle delay. 29Si MAS NMR spectra parameters were the following: π/2 pulse (5.0 μs), 1000 scans, and 60 s recycle delay.
For 1H and 13C MAS NMR experiments, a high-axially symmetric glass ampule with the zeolite sample inside was inserted into the zirconia rotor (4 mm) and was spun at 5–9 kHz. 1H MAS NMR spectra parameters were the following: Hahn-echo pulse sequence π/2−τ–π–τ, where τ equals one rotor period, π/2 pulse (5.0 μs), 16 scans, and 60 s recycle delay. 13C MAS NMR spectra recording parameters were high-power decoupling with the decoupling field strength being 11.7 G (5.0 μs length of π/2 1H pulse), 2000 scans, and 5 s recycle delay. 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra recording parameters were the following: high-power decoupling, with the decoupling field strength being 11.7 G (5.0 μs length of π/2 1H pulse), contact time of 2 s at the Hartmann–Hahn matching conditions of 50 kHz, 60,000 scans, and 2 s recycle delay.
The obtained NMR spectra were deconvoluted with the Dmfit software. (37)
2.8. GC–MS Analysis
The products of propane transformation on the InO+/H-BEA sample were analyzed with the GC–MS method using the Agilent 7000B GC/MS chromatograph and an HP5ms (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) column. The sealed glass ampule with adsorbed hydrocarbon products formed on InO+/H-BEA was opened, and the zeolite was dissolved in a 10% NaOH water solution, with the 10-fold excess of the alkali, at 453 K for 28 h. The resulting solution was neutralized with H2SO4 up to pH = 7. The hydrocarbon species were extracted with diethyl ether, followed by the GC–MS analysis of the obtained solution. The oven program was as follows: 323 K for 3 min, followed by 10 K/min heating up to 533 K. The evaporation temperature was 573 K. The injected sample volume was 0.8 μL. The mass spectra were recorded with the following parameters: an electron ionization of 70 eV and the scanning regime in the m/z range of 40–500.
2.9. Electron Microscopy
The studies with electron microscopy methods were performed using the Themis-Z 3.1 (TFS, USA) microscope at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The microscope was equipped with a field emission cathode with a monochromator and two aberration correctors. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) of the sample elemental composition was carried out using a four-segment Super-X detector (with an energy resolution of about 120 eV) in the scanning dark-field mode (HAADF-STEM) with elemental mapping along the characteristic lines of the spectrum from each point of the analyzing region. For the electron microscopy experiment, the powder of the In/H-BEA sample was dispersed in ethanol using ultrasound and deposited on a perforated carbon-film-coated copper grid (3 mm diameter).

3.1. Characterization of Zeolite Samples and In-sites
Figure 1 shows XRD data for the parent H-BEA zeolite mixed with indium(III) oxide and the In/H-BEA sample obtained after the reductive treatment of the mixture with H2. The XRD pattern of the mixture demonstrates the peaks related to the crystal phases of both components. No other phases were detected. The pattern of the zeolite is typical of the crystalline structure of a BEA-type framework. (38) For the In/H-BEA sample, no changes in the BEA structure are observed, which is in line with 27Al and 29Si MAS NMR results showing very similar spectra for H-BEA and In/H-BEA samples (Figure S1). The peaks of In2O3 are absent in the pattern of In/H-BEA, demonstrating the oxide particle dispersion and transfer into the zeolite pores during the reductive treatment with H2 at 773 K. The chemistry of this process was previously described in refs (16)– (18) and can be illustrated by the equation
(1)
where [OZ]− represents a framework Si–O––Al site. The solid-state exchange reaction between indium and BAS can proceed through the intermediate formation of either indium(I) oxide or metallic indium(0). (20)
Figure 1
Figure 1. XRD patterns of In2O3 (a), mixture of the parent H-BEA zeolite and In2O3 (b), and the In/H-BEA zeolite sample obtained after the reductive treatment of the mixture (c).
The study of In/H-BEA with electron microscopy (Figures 2 and S2) shows that the sample consists of isometric crystals with a round shape of 0.35–0.75 μm in diameter. No other particles are detected as notably different by mass density compared to the zeolite crystals. This observation indicates the absence of In2O3 crystals in the sample and In2O3 agglomerates on the outer surface of the zeolite crystals. It confirms the full transfer of the oxide into the pores, which is in line with the XRD data. EDX elemental mapping shows no agglomeration of indium atoms and demonstrates their uniform spatial distribution over the intracrystalline void of the zeolite. The EDX spectrum (Figure S2) provides the In/Al ratio of 0.7 for In/H-BEA.

As shown by eq 1, indium loading in the zeolite should result in a decrease in the BAS concentration. The 1H MAS NMR method was used to measure the BAS concentration for the parent H-BEA, In+/H-BEA, and InO+/H-BEA samples (Figure S3 and Table 1). It can be seen that there is a significant change in the BAS amount after the H-BEA zeolite was modified with indium, whereas the concentration of the silanol Si–OH groups is intact. This result confirms indium transfer from the In2O3 phase into the zeolite pores and the reaction between indium and BAS. The unit cell compositions, calculated based on the BAS concentration, for the H-form and the In-containing BEA zeolite samples are in good accordance with the determined Si/Al ratio and the indium content in the samples.

The state of indium sites inside the zeolite pores was investigated with the XPS method. Figure 3 presents In 3d5/2 core-level XPS spectra for the In+/H-BEA and InO+/H-BEA samples and two standards: metallic indium and In2O3. The In(0) state is characterized by the peak with the BE value at 443.9 eV, (36,39) while In2O3 exhibits a BE of 444.6 eV. (21,40,41) None of these indium species is detected for both In+/H-BEA and InO+/H-BEA. The spectrum of the former sample shows a peak at 445.7 eV, while a BE value of 446.2 eV is determined for the latter one. These values are very similar to those previously observed for In-modified ZSM-5 zeolite containing, as assigned, either In+ (445.4 eV) (27,40) or InO+ (446.1 eV) species. (27) It is reasonable to suggest the same assignment for In-modified BEA zeolite, which, therefore, contains In+ sites after reductive treatment with H2 and InO+ sites when oxidized with O2. Such indium species transformation was previously described (16,17,20) as

where In+ can be converted to InO+ and vice versa, through a reversible redox cycle.

3.2. Propane Transformation on In+/H-BEA
Figures 4 and S4 show the 13C MAS NMR spectra of propane, selectively labeled with the 13C isotope at either the C-1 or C-2 position, adsorbed on In+/H-BEA and reacted at different temperatures within the range of 298–773 K. The spectra for the samples kept at 298 K exhibit the signals of initial propane at 16.4 and 16.8 ppm from methyl and methylene groups, respectively. The other signals of the products of propane transformation are observed only after the temperature reached 723 K: −7.5 ppm from methane, 6.1 ppm from ethane, 13.5 and 25.8 ppm from n-butane, 24.1 and 25.0 ppm from isobutane, and about 130 ppm from the phenyl ring of aromatic hydrocarbons. (42)

3.3. Propane Transformation on InO+/H-BEA
Figures 5, S5, and S6 show 13C MAS NMR data for propane transformation on the InO+/H-BEA sample in the temperature range of 298–723 K. At 298–573 K, the presented spectra of propane-1-13C and propane-2-13C contain different signals for the hydrocarbon species formed from the alkane, demonstrating the transfer of the 13C label from the particular groups of the alkane to the certain molecular fragments of the formed hydrocarbon species, which helps to identify their structure reliably.
Figure 5
Figure 5. 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra of propane-1-13C (a–d) and propane-2-13C (e–h) adsorbed on InO+/H-BEA. The samples were kept at 298–573 K for 20 min at each step, followed by spectrum recording at room temperature (298 K). The symbol ● notes the position of a 13C atom in the alkane molecule.
Initial propane exhibits two signals at 16.9 and 17.6 ppm from methyl and methylene groups, respectively, which shifts to 16.2 and 16.8 ppm, respectively, after sample heating at T ≥ 473 K. The alkane transformation starts already at 423–473 K. The signals from the products formed can be separated into two groups: at 128, 118, and 18.9 and 25, 20.2, and 19.1 ppm (Figure 5). It should be noted that the resonance at around 19 ppm consists of two overlapping signals, with the chemical shifts determined to be 18.9 and 19.1 ppm (Figures S5 and S6). The first group of signals is assigned to propene, which shows the chemical shifts of 130–133, 115–116, and 15–19 ppm in a gas phase (42) or adsorbed state. (43,44) The second group consists of two relatively narrow signals at 20.2 and 19.1 ppm and one at about 25 ppm, with remarkably high width. These signals might be attributed to a fragment consisting of three saturated carbon atoms, that is, CH2–CH2–CH3. The chemical shifts observed are very similar to those exhibited by various metal-propyl species, either dissolved (42,45−48) or adsorbed on zeolites. (30,49−51) Therefore, the signals may be assigned to the indium-propyl fragment: 19.1 (−CH3), 20.2 (−CH2−), and 25 ppm (In–CH2−). The attribution of the signal at 25 ppm to In–CH2– is reasonable because it is very broad and similar to the broad signal of the methyl group of earlier identified In-methyl species formed from methane on In-ZSM-5 zeolite. (27)
At 523–573 K, the other resonances can be detected in the spectra (Figures 5 and S5). A set of poorly resolved signals at 10–40 and centered at 144 ppm show the formation of oligomeric alkenes. (43,52−54) Another group of signals at 19.4 (−CH3) and 130–140 ppm is assigned to aromatic hydrocarbons, like toluene and xylenes. (42,55) The broad and weak signal at 186 ppm is typical of carbonyl groups of carboxylic acids. Another intense signal at 31.1 ppm and weak signal at 9.1 ppm may belong to the hydrocarbon fragments of the formed carboxylic acids. (42,56−58)
The signals from toluene become dominant in the spectra at temperatures of 623–723 K (Figure S5), whereas other described resonances are no longer observed. At the same time, the signal at 125 ppm appears in the 13C MAS NMR spectra (Figure S6), demonstrating the formation of carbon dioxide. (59) Also methane, ethane, n-butane, and isobutane can be seen in the spectra at the highest temperature.
To support the assignments suggested for the observed 13C NMR signals, the GC–MS analysis of the products of propane transformation on InO+/H-BEA zeolite was performed. Table 2 and Figure S7 show the result. As can be seen, toluene and C2–C4 carboxylic acids are the dominant species detected, which is in line with the 13C MAS NMR spectra interpretation. These compounds represent >95% of the extracted products, with toluene and acetic acid being the major ones. The detection of the C2+ acids, C4 aldehyde, and C8 alcohol implies a rather complex process of propane oxidation. This process may include various pathways of dissociative adsorption of propane on InO+ sites and subsequent assembly of the resulting hydrocarbon fragments into C2+ acids, aldehydes, and alcohols.

3.4. Propene Transformation on InO+/H-BEA
To inquire into the peculiarities of propene transformation, which were formed at propane dehydrogenation on In-containing zeolite, an additional spectroscopic experiment was performed. Figure S8 shows 13C MAS NMR spectra of propene-3-13C adsorbed and transformed on InO+/H-BEA. At low temperatures (298–373 K), the spectra demonstrate overlapping signals at 10–40 ppm and broad poorly resolved signals at 115–144 ppm from oligomeric alkenes. (43,52−54) In the temperature range of 423–473 K, two specific resonances at 155 and 250 ppm can be also observed. They are assigned to methyl-substituted cyclopentenyl cations (60) which are usually detected for alkene transformation on H-form zeolites. (28,43,61,62) Toluene becomes visible and prevails in the spectra at 523–573 K, as seen by the growing intensity of the signals at 19.4, 124, 130, and 141 ppm.

4.1. Activity of In+ and InO+ Sites Loaded into BEA Zeolite
13C MAS NMR analysis (Figures 4 and S4) of the products of propane transformation demonstrates that there is no alkane conversion on In+/H-BEA at temperatures up to 723 K. The products C1–C4 alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons, which were detected at T ≥ 723 K, are presumably formed as the result of propane cracking on BAS through the carbenium (63−65) and/or carbonium (65,66) ion mechanisms, yielding methane, ethene, propene, and dihydrogen. The formed alkenes are further involved in the sequence of oligomerization, double-bond and skeletal isomerization, cracking, and aromatization reactions that lead to the formation of butanes and aromatic hydrocarbons, as it was earlier reported. (67,68) It can be inferred from the 13C MAS NMR spectra of the In+/H-BEA sample at 298–773 K that In+ sites loaded in the zeolite are inactive for alkane transformation.
A remarkably different result is obtained for propane on InO+/H-BEA (Figures 5, S5 and S6). Alkane transformation starts already at 423 K, with the first product being propene. Further, the formation of toluene is observed simultaneously with the formation of carboxylic acids at 473–673 K. Hence, it can be stated that InO+ sites enhance the alkane dehydrogenation activity of zeolite. Moreover, it provides the oxidative ability to the catalyst.
To the best of our knowledge, the valued property of In-modified zeolites to oxidize alkanes to carboxylic acids has not been reported yet, except for methane oxidation to acetaldehyde on In/H-ZSM-5 (27) and formic acid on InO+/CHA. (23) Also, it should be noted that no products of propane hydrogenolysis, methane and ethane, are detected at 473–623 K for InO+/H-BEA. Minor quantities of C1–C2 alkanes and butanes are formed at temperatures higher than 673 K (Figure S6), which is accounted for by hydrocarbon species cracking on BAS. This is unusual behavior for a metal-modified zeolite which is expected to produce some quantity of lower alkanes, as it is in the case, for instance, of Zn- and Ga-containing zeolites. (1,5) Thus, it can be postulated that the zeolites modified with InO+ species can potentially serve as the catalysts for selective dehydrogenation, aromatization, and partial oxidation of alkanes.
4.2. Pathways of Propane Transformation on InO+-modified BEA Zeolite
The presented data demonstrate that there are two parallel pathways of propane transformation on InO+/H-BEA: dehydrogenation to propene, followed by its aromatization to toluene and oxidation to the carboxylic acids, aldehydes, and alcohols. Below, we discuss the possible mechanisms of these parallel pathways of propane transformation.
4.2.1. Dehydrogenation and Aromatization
13C MAS NMR spectra in Figure 5 show that the activation of propane occurs on InO+ sites to form indium-propyl species. This proceeds similarly to methane (23,26,27) and ethane (15) activation on In-containing zeolites. Therefore, the “alkyl” pathway of propane C–H dissociation can be suggested.
The formation of the indium-propyl species is observed simultaneously with propene, and, therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that this species is the intermediate of the alkane dehydrogenation reaction. InO+ sites facilitate the dehydrogenation properties of the zeolite, as was found before, (10−12,14,15) through effective C–H bond cleavage or H atom abstraction from the alkane molecule. A possible mechanism of propane dehydrogenation into propene is illustrated in Scheme 1, according to which the hydroxyindium-propyl species is formed and stabilized on the surface of InO+/H-BEA zeolite as the intermediate of the reaction.
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Suggested Mechanism of Propane Dehydrogenation to Propene on InO+/H-BEA Zeolite with the Assistance of InO+ Sites
Further, propene transforms into aromatic hydrocarbons, mainly toluene. The separate 13C MAS NMR experiment with propene-3-13C (Figure S7) demonstrates that this transformation proceeds with the formation of oligomeric alkenes and methyl-substituted cyclopentenyl cations as the intermediates. This evidences the occurrence of alkene aromatization with the assistance of zeolite BAS, according to the conjunct polymerization mechanism. (69,70)
The InO+ sites provide an effective dehydrogenation of alkane to alkene, while the further conversion of the alkene to aromatic hydrocarbons takes place on the zeolite BAS. Importantly, no complex aromatic species were found in the products of propane conversion on InO+/H-BEA, showing that alkane aromatization could be performed with high selectivity.
4.2.2. Oxidation and the Formation of Carboxylic Acids
Another pathway of propane transformation is its oxidation to carboxylic acids, which are reliably identified by GC–MS after their extraction from the zeolite. The obtained 13C MAS NMR spectra (Figure S8) for propene on InO+/H-BEA demonstrate no oxygenated species formation, thus pointing out that propane converts to carboxylic acids directly, parallel to dehydrogenation to propene.
The intense signal at 31 ppm and the signal at 186 ppm, detected in 13C CP/MAS NMR spectra, might be associated with the formed acetic acid, which is the main oxygenate identified among the extracted products. Note however, that the signal of the −CH3 group of adsorbed acetic acid should be expected at about 22 ppm, while the −COOH group exhibits the signal at 186 ppm. (31,59)
One can assume that the signal at 31 ppm belongs to the methyl group of oxyindium acetate (CH3COOIn═O) rather than the methyl group of acetic acid. In this case, the signal at 186 ppm arises from the −COOIn═O fragment of the acetate. The assignment is reasonable because the signals of the methyl group of heavy metal acetates are usually shifted downfield by 3–5 ppm, with respect to the signal of acetic acid (see, e.g., ref (56)). Hydrolysis of oxyindium acetate at the zeolite framework dissolving in NaOH solution affords CH3COOH, which was detected by GC–MS.
To confirm that oxyindium acetate can be transformed into acetic acid, the sample, exhibiting the signal at 31 ppm was additionally saturated with water. After heating the sample with adsorbed water at 523 K for 1 h, the signal at 31 ppm is shifted to about 30 ppm, becomes narrower, and decreases in intensity. At the same time, the signal at 24 ppm from the expected acid appeared (see Figure S9).
Propionic acid is the other oxygenate identified among the extracted products, which is formed in a quantity two times less than that of acetic acid. The signals of propionic acid in solution were detected at 8.9 (−CH3), 27.6 (−CH2−), and 182 ppm (−COOH). (42) Therefore, the weak signal at 9.1 ppm may belong to the −CH3 group, while the signals of −CH2– and COO– groups of propionic acid or oxyindium-propionate may contribute to the observed signals at 31 and 186 ppm.
4.2.3. Possible Routes of Propane Oxidation to the Acetic and Propionic Acids
One can suggest a few pathways of propane activation on InO+ sites, resulting finally in carboxylic acids (Scheme 2).
Scheme 2
Scheme 2. Possible Pathways for Propane Activation via C–C or C–H Bond Dissociation on InO+/H-BEA Zeolite; Here, [OZ]− Denotes the Zeolite Framework Si–O––Al Site
Pathways I and II presume propane C–C bond heterolytic cleavage on [In═O]+[OZ]− paired sites to form either CH3CH2In═O and CH3OZ species (pathway I) or CH3In═O and CH3CH2OZ species (pathway II).
Acetic acid can be formed from the products of propane dissociation by pathway I in Scheme 2. Two successive steps of oxyindium-ethyl species oxidation by InO+ sites result in oxyindium-acetate, and its further hydrolysis with H2O affords acetic acid (Scheme 3). The methoxy species, which is also formed by pathway I, may methylate benzene, presumably formed by a parallel route of propane dehydrogenation, oligomerization, and aromatization.
Scheme 3
Scheme 3. Formation of Acetic Acid from the Products of Propane Dissociation on InO+/H-BEA Zeolite by Pathway I
Propionic acid as the second product of propane oxidation is detected in a noticeable quantity. It can be formed from hydroxyindium-propyl species formed by pathway III (Scheme 4). The hydroxyindium-propyl may be evolved to propanol, reducing In3+ to In+. Further direct oxidation of propanol with InO+ affords finally propionic acid.
Scheme 4
Scheme 4. Formation of Propionic Acid from the Products of Propane Dissociation on InO+/H-BEA Zeolite by Pathway III
Oxyindium-methyl species formed by pathway II may be further oxidized by InO+ sites, offering finally formic acid. (23) Ethoxy species may be involved in the alkylation of benzene, offering the detected ethylbenzene. The signal of the formed formic acid may contribute to a signal at 186 ppm but was not clearly identified. It was earlier established that oxyindium-methyl species, which were identified as the intermediate at methane transformation on InO+/H-ZSM-5, transformed further into acetaldehyde, rather than into acetic acid. (27) The evident absence of the signals of acetaldehyde at 220 ppm (−CH═O) (27) implies its absence among the products. This means that pathway II of the alkane activation may not be realized.
It should be noted that Schemes 2-4 show possible propane transformation pathways in a simplified way, and the actual mechanisms of the propane dissociation and oxyindium-alkyl oxidation may be more complicated and presumably involve more steps of the hydrocarbon species interaction with the active sites.
Nevertheless, InO+/H-BEA zeolite provides an oxidation pathway for alkane conversion into valuable oxygenates, mainly carboxylic acids, owing to the oxidative properties of InO+ sites. The carboxylic acids formed can be extracted by diethyl ether after the zeolite framework dissolving in NaOH solution. The catalyst can be regenerated with O2 because InO+ is reduced to an inactive In+ state at propane oxidation. Therefore, In-containing zeolites can operate through the chemical looping or stepwise process from the applied catalysis perspective.
5. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The 13C MAS NMR method was applied to reveal and characterize the pathways of propane transformation on In-modified BEA zeolite. Two samples of the zeolite were studied, which contained, besides BAS, either In+ or InO+ active sites. The state of indium in the zeolite was characterized with XPS, electron microscopy, and MAS NMR methods.
For propane on In+/H-BEA zeolite, 13C MAS NMR has shown that In+ sites exhibit no activity at 298–723 K for the alkane conversion. The products, C1–C4 alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons observed at 773 K, are formed as a result of the alkane transformation on BAS of the zeolite.
InO+/H-BEA zeolite has demonstrated the ability to perform dehydrogenation of propane to propene and oxidation of the alkane, mainly to acetic and propionic acids. Propene, detected at T ≤ 423 K, was found to convert further at T > 523 K to toluene with the assistance of zeolite BAS. Also, no hydrogenolysis of propane was monitored at 298–673 K. Thus, two parallel pathways of propane transformation on InO+/H-BEA were revealed: dehydrogenation followed by the alkene aromatization and the alkane oxidation to carboxylic acids. The main products were identified by GC–MS as toluene and C2–C3 carboxylic acids.
The mechanism of propane transformation into the detected oxygenates was suggested and discussed. Three pathways of propane activation by the alkane dissociative adsorption on InO+ sites via either C–H or C–C bond cleavage were suggested. It is inferred that acetic acid may be formed following the dissociation of the initial alkane C–C bond whereas propionic acid is formed after the dissociation of the alkane C–H bond.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
