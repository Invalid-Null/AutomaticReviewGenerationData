The given document does not contain information related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It discusses combined operando UV-Vis/Raman/XAFS characterization of silica- and alumina-supported molybdenum oxide catalysts, but does not mention application to propane dehydrogenation specifically. Since the content is not relevant to PDH or ODH, I have indicated "No" for relevance and did not include the detailed XML output.
