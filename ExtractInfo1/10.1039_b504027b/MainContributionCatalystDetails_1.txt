The given document does not contain any information related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It discusses combined UV-Vis, Raman and XAFS spectroscopy to study silica- and alumina-supported molybdenum oxide catalysts, but does not mention conversion of propane to propylene specifically. Since the content is not relevant to PDH or ODH processes, I have indicated "No" for relevance and did not include any other information in the output.
