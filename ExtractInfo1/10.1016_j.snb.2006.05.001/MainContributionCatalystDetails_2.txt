The document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation for converting propane to propylene. It focuses on investigating the gas sensing properties and mechanism of gallium oxynitride sensors for detecting propane gas. While it mentions dehydrogenation reactions occurring on the sensor surface during propane detection, this is not in the context of intentionally converting propane to propylene. Therefore, the document is not relevant to the information requested.
