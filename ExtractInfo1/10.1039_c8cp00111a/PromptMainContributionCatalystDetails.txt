A sinter-resistant catalyst using an alumina support recycled from AlP fumigation residue: trash to treasure†
Sintering is a long-standing issue especially in high temperature catalytic applications. In this paper, we report an effective method to slow down metal particle migration and coalescence (PMC) by using a thermally stable alumina support. Noteworthily, the alumina sample was developed from AlP fumigation residue, which is a very dangerous substance for living creatures and environment protection. By optimizing the heated hydrolysis and ball-milling conditions, we recycled a phosphate-stabilized alumina material that retained a 117 m2 g−1 surface area after 1050 °C hydrothermal aging. The catalyst using this newly developed alumina support had Pd dispersion 1.7 times higher than that using a commercial alumina support after aging. The kinetics and XPS experiments showed that phosphate neither participated in the catalytic reaction process nor changed the active sites. This catalyst also exhibited extraordinary water tolerance and durability, making it a promising material in automotive exhaust purification and other catalytic applications.
1. Introduction
Sintering, or thermal deactivation, is one of the main reasons for the loss of catalysts’ activity. This is especially true for high temperature catalytic processes, such as automotive exhaust treatment, steam reforming, or catalytic combustion.1 The sintering mechanisms are generally considered as Ostwald ripening (OR) and particle migration and coalescence (PMC). Datye et al.1 proposed that OR dominates at the early stage of catalyst sintering, while PMC contributes a lot when particles grow large and at high temperatures support restructuring can become important.
Many efforts were made to improve the anti-sintering ability of the catalysts.2–12 Wang et al.2 using a lysine-assisted hydrothermal approach synthesized thin porous alumina sheets that can stabilize Au nanoparticles at annealing temperatures up to 900 °C. Xiong et al.10 found that the CeO2-supported Pt–Sn clusters are very stable, even during the extended propane dehydrogenation reaction at 680 °C. Furthermore, upon oxidation the Pt–Sn clusters readily revert to the atomically dispersed species on CeO2. Liu et al.11 using an area-selective atomic layer deposition (AS-ALD) method prepared oxide nanotrap-anchored sinter-resistant platinum nanoparticles, and these platinum nanoparticles could kept an average size of 2.91 nm at 600 °C. Li et al.6 reported a well-defined cuboctahedral MgAl2O4 spinel support material that is capable of stabilizing platinum particles in the range of 1–3 nm during extremely severe aging at 800 °C, and further they found that the origin of the catalyst's thermal stability lied in the strong interactions between spinel surface oxygens and epitaxial platinum (111) facets. Datye's group observed that PdO as well as CeO2 could trap Pt at a temperature as high as 650 °C or 800 °C, thus retaining the Pt species in small particles or atomically dispersed.8,9 Very recently, Nie et al.12 demonstrated that atomically dispersed ionic platinum can be activated via steam treatment (750 °C) to simultaneously achieve the goals of low-temperature carbon monoxide oxidation activity while providing outstanding hydrothermal stability.
All the remarkable work mentioned above displayed an outstanding sintering resistance between 650 °C and 900 °C. Nevertheless, automotive exhaust can experience a temperature as high as 1050 °C,13 under this condition a severe loss of catalyst activity caused by sintering will be found. Unfortunately, little research has achieved significant improvements in the thermal stability of the catalysts at such a high temperature.14 Tuning of the properties and structure of the support is without doubt an effective way to control the migration and coalescence among big metal particles.1 We have shown that phosphate was an effective stabilizer for alumina,15,16 and using the alumina support modified by phosphate at a surface concentration of ∼5.0 μmol m−2, the Pd catalyst delivered a better catalytic activity after aging, indicating Pd dispersion 1.9 times higher than that when using a pure alumina support.17
In this work, we report the recycling of AlP fumigation residue into a value-added material—thermally stable alumina, and the development of a sinter-resistant catalyst using this new alumina support. AlP is a hazardous material that is being widely used to generate phosphine (PH3) for fumigating granary. The AlP fumigated residue mainly contains AlN, Al(OH)3 and unreacted AlP, which is difficult to degrade properly. In our previous paper,18 we successfully converted all the hard-to-be-degraded raw materials to alumina by optimizing the heated hydrolysis and ball-milling conditions, and the chemistry during the synthesis process was also discussed. Herein, we mainly reported the catalytic applications of these recycled alumina materials. Firstly, the recycling process of AlP fumigation residue to alumina was briefly introduced. Afterwards, CO oxidation reactions were applied to test the sinter-resistant ability of the Pd catalysts using various alumina supports. Furthermore, we conducted kinetic tests combining with other characterization techniques to elucidate the effects of phosphate on the catalytic reaction process and active sites. Finally, the water-contained CO oxidation reaction and durability tests were conducted to show its promising commercial application prospects.
2. Experimental
2.1 Recycling alumina and preparation of Pd/Al2O3 catalysts
AlP fumigation residue was supplied by Zhengzhou Pesticide Company of China. It was firstly filtered and the material with more than 200 mesh was used as the initial sample (AlP res.). 20 g of the AlP res. sample was slowly added into 150 mL of water and was then set in an 80 °C water bath under continuous stirring for 8 h. After filtration and drying, the product powder was denoted as the AlP-h sample. 20 g of the AlP res. sample was dissolved in 50 mL of water, and the mixture was then ball milled in a NETZSCH sander at 800 rpm for 10 min. Another 100 mL of water was added to wash the mixture after ball milling. Afterwards, the obtained mixture was set in the 80 °C water bath under continuous stirring for 8 h. After filtration and drying, the obtained powder was denoted as the AlP-mh sample. All these samples were calcined at 800 °C for 3 h to receive the fresh alumina samples, and were heat treated at 1050 °C in 10% H2O for 10 h to get the aged alumina samples.
1 wt% Pd (precursor: Pd(NO3)2) was loaded on the fresh alumina samples by incipient wetness impregnation. After drying, the samples were calcined at 400 °C for 5 h to get the fresh catalysts, and were aged at 1050 °C in 10% H2O for 10 h to obtain the hydrothermally aged catalysts.
2.2 Characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Bruker D8-Focus powder X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The data collection range was 15 to 75° at a step size of 0.02° and the scan speed was set as 6° min−1. The amount of phosphorus in AlP-mh-1050 was measured by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) using a VISTA-MPX spectrometer. While for AlP res.-1050 and AlP-h-1050, X-ray fluorescence (XRF) experiments were conducted on a Bruker S4 Pioneer instrument to test their phosphorus contents. Pore structure analysis was conducted on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 N2 adsorption/desorption instrument. Prior to the measurements, the samples were degassed at 300 °C under vacuum for 6 h. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) experiments were conducted on a HITACHI S4800 field emission microscope. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were carried out on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 field emission electron microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The 27Al and 31P MAS NMR experiments were conducted on a Varian Infinity plus 300 spectrometer operating at resonance frequencies of 78.2 MHz for 27Al and 121.4 MHz for 31P. The spinning rate was 10 kHz for both elements. CO-DRIFTS chemisorption experiments were conducted on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer with a Harrick Praying Mantis high temperature reaction chamber mounted inside it. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were conducted on a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI spectrometer using a monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray excitation source operated at 12 kV.
2.3 Catalytic activity and kinetic tests
In a typical CO oxidation reaction test, 100 mg catalyst diluted with 1.8 g quartz sand was placed between the quartz wool, and the CO oxidation tests were conducted. The CO oxidation light-off tests started from 150 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 up to 400 °C. The feed gas had 2% CO and 2% O2 balanced with N2 at a flow rate of 1 L min−1. The concentrations of CO and CO2 were all monitored using an MKS IR detector. Water-contained CO oxidation reactions were conducted under the same conditions as CO oxidation reaction tests, and the water content was set as 5%. The catalysts were firstly reduced at 250 °C with 5% H2/N2 at a flow rate of 1 L min−1 for 0.5 h prior to the tests. The kinetic measurements of the CO oxidation reaction were conducted in a packed-bed microreactor, keeping the CO conversion below 15%.
Pd dispersions of the aged catalysts were measured using pulse CO chemisorption on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. Typically, a sample was oxidized in 10% O2/N2 at 250 °C for 20 min and then reduced in 10% H2/Ar for 30 min. The sample was then cooled to 30 °C in He before the CO pulse chemisorption measurement. The pulse interval was set as 1 minute. Assuming that the number of adsorbed CO on Pd matches the ratio of 1 : 1.19–22
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Recycling of AlP fumigation residue
AlP fumigation residue (AlP res.) mainly contains Al(OH)3, a small portion of unreacted AlP (Fig. S1, ESI†) and, above all, AlN (Fig. 1a), which were produced during the manufacturing process of the AlP fumigant. AlN is not very active as AlP; it could only react with water obviously in a heating environment.23 To remove or convert this small pore material, we immersed AlP fumigation residue in deionized water at 80 °C with stirring. Unfortunately, AlN could not been removed thoroughly under these conditions (Fig. 1a). Also increasing the heating temperature and further extending the hydrolysis time made no further contribution to the conversion of AlN, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). While AlP completely transformed into phosphate (Fig. S1, ESI†), illustrating its high activity in hydrolysis. During the hydrolysis process, the chemical reactions are shown as reactions (1)–(4):
AlP + 2H2O → AlOOH + PH3 (1)
PH3 + 2O2 O2H3PO4 (2)
AlN + 2H2O → AlOOH + NH3 (3)
NH3 + H2O → NH3·H2O (4)
Fig. 1 (a) XRD patterns of the AlP fumigation residue (AlP res.), the hydrolysis treated sample at 80 °C (AlP-h), the ball-milling plus hydrolysis-treated sample (AlP-mh), and the commercial pseudo-boehmite (PB). (b) SEM images of AlP res., AlP-h, AlP-mh and PB sample.18
The SEM images of AlP res. and the hydrolysis treated sample (AlP-h) are shown in Fig. 1b, and it is observed that the particle sizes were reduced after hydrolysis treatment, but still in micron grade. Thus we suspected that the initial particle sizes of AlP res. were too big to completely convert through simple heated hydrolysis. Ball-milling was therefore applied, and after heated hydrolysis, AlN was totally converted to AlOOH as expected (Fig. 1a). This AlN free sample (AlP-mh) showed the same crystallinity and morphology as commercial pseudo-boehmite (PB) as shown in Fig. 1a and b.
After calcination at 800 °C, the fresh γ-alumina samples were obtained. The as-prepared alumina evolved from AlP res. has large amounts of AlN and AlPO4 (Fig. 2a and b), which are both small pore materials like α-alumina.23 These impurities blocked the channel making γ-alumina a material with a very low surface area (Table 1). After aging, thermally stable AlN would not decompose at all and more AlPO4 was formed (Fig. 2c and d). In contrast, the AlN free sample AlP-mh-800 had the highest surface area (Table 1). Due to the stabilizer, phosphate, the aged alumina sample AlP-mh-1050 also had a better phase stability than the PB-1050 sample (Fig. 2c). The surface phosphorus concentration was calculated to be 4.4 μmol m−2 for the AlP-mh-1050 sample according to its phosphorus content (1.6%) and surface area (117 m2 g−1) given in Table 1. This value is close to our previously reported best phosphorus concentration of ∼5.0 μmol m−2 that delivered the best catalytic performance with 1 wt% Pd loaded after 1050 °C aging.17

3.2 CO oxidation tests
The CO oxidation reaction was conducted to test the activities of the catalysts and the results are shown in Fig. 3. The relative lean O2 in the feed gas (CO : O2 = 1 : 1) was used to simulate the treatment conditions of gasoline exhaust.13 For fresh catalysts, little difference was observed except the Pd/AlP res.-800 sample (Fig. 3a); the inferior performance of Pd/AlP res.-800 can be attributed to its so low surface area of the support. After aging, Pd/AlP-mh-800 established the best activity, for which the light-off temperature was more than 20 °C lower than that for Pd/PB-800 (Fig. 3b). In contrast, aged Pd/AlP res.-800 delivered very bad performance that only 72% CO was converted at most (up to 389 °C, data not shown). These differences in activity performance for both the fresh and aged catalysts will be further elucidated with the analyses of some characterization as follows.

3.3 The states of Pd species in the fresh and aged catalysts
Fig. 4a shows the XRD patterns of the fresh catalysts. The diffraction peaks of PdO appeared in Pd/AlP res.-800, while in other catalysts no Pd species were obviously observed. These phenomena illustrated that big PdO particles were formed in Pd/AlP res.-800 but Pd species were highly dispersed in other three catalysts. We used CO-DRIFTS to preliminarily explain the states of these dispersed Pd species. Except Pd/AlP res.-800, all the other three catalysts displayed apparent CO adsorption on Pd0 clusters (Fig. 4c), suggesting the existence of Pd0 in these three fresh catalysts. It should be noted that the adsorption energy of CO on PdO is very low; it does not adsorb on the PdO surface even at 100 K.25 Therefore, the absence of the CO adsorption signal for the fresh Pd/AlP res.-800 catalyst (Fig. 4c) suggested that surface exposed Pd species are exclusively PdO. However, in the other three fresh catalysts we could not rule out the existence of PdO, and we will further elucidate the Pd state by XPS later.
Fig. 4 XRD patterns of the (a) fresh and (b) aged Pd/Al2O3 catalysts. The aged catalysts were the corresponding fresh catalysts heat treated at 1050 °C in 10 vol% H2O flowing air for 10 h. CO-DRIFTS chemisorption at an ambient atmosphere of the (c) fresh and (d) aged catalysts, and wavenumbers 2081, 1976 and 1924 cm−1 corresponded to linear, bridge and hollow-bonded CO adsorbed on the Pd surface, respectively.25
After aging, both PdO and Pd0 (mainly) were found in Pd/AlP res.-800, while the other three catalysts only had PdO (Fig. 4b). However, CO-DRIFTS results showed no CO adsorption signals in all the various catalysts (Fig. 4d), indicating that the surface exposed Pd species were all PdO. So we considered that the Pd0 particles in Pd/AlP res.-800 were covered by other materials. From Fig. 2 we have analyzed that more AlPO4 species were formed during the aging process, and this dense species could be responsible for the coverage of Pd0. As we all know, Pd0 tends to aggregate and form big PdO particles during heat treatment in air, but PdO can be decomposed into Pd at a temperature higher than 830 °C.8 Therefore, the formation of Pd0 in aged Pd/AlP res.-800 was attributed to the decomposition of covered PdO (by newly formed AlPO4) during aging treatment, but the covered Pd0 could not be reoxidized during the cooling process (<830 °C) because of no accessibility of O2. In contrast, the aged Pd/AlP-h-800 and Pd/AlP-mh-800 catalysts, like aged Pd/PB-800, had only PdO in them, suggesting that surface phosphate would not affect the existing state of Pd species. For aged Pd/AlP res.-800, most Pd species were Pd0 that were covered by AlPO4 (Fig. 4b), and surface small amounts of PdO (active sites) were responsible for its such poor activity performance.
XPS spectra were recorded for the Pd/AlP-mh-800 and Pd/PB-800 samples. The Pd 3d spectra are shown in Fig. 5, and the Al 2p and P 2p spectra are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). For the two fresh catalysts, supported Pd species were exclusive in the form of PdO according to their binding energies of Pd 3d5/2.26,27 Pd is converted to PdO at a temperature over 325 °C and undergoes a wetting and spreading action to form thin flat crystallites.28 Our fresh catalysts were obtained by heat treatment in flowing air at 400 °C for 5 h, thus most Pd species were oxidized to small PdO grains in our prepared catalysts. However, bits of Pd0 still could not be oxidized according to the results of CO-DRIFTS shown in Fig. 4c. Under the same heat treatment conditions, Zhang et al.29 observed a similar phenomenon that a portion of Pt0 still retained the Pt loading amount above 0.5% by analyses of EXAFS.

PdO was also exclusively present in the aged Pd/AlP-mh-800 and Pd/PB-800 catalysts by the XPS study (Fig. 5c and d), which is in good agreement with the XRD and CO-DRIFTS data shown in Fig. 4b and d. Here, it is worthy of note that the Pd species in the aging process experienced oxidation, reduction and reoxidation. Specifically, a Pd precursor was oxidized to PdO in flowing air up to 830 °C; from 830 °C to 1050 °C, PdO decomposed to Pd0 and Pd0 grew to big particles; during the cooling procedure when the temperature is below 830 °C, Pd0 was reoxidized to PdO. By comparing the Pd 3d XPS spectra of the two catalysts, we concluded that phosphate had no chemistry with Pd species, regardless of the fresh or aged catalysts.
3.4 Morphologies and distributions of Pd species
TEM was conducted to show the morphology and distribution of Pd species, and Fig. 6 shows the TEM images of the fresh catalysts. For Pd/AlP res.-800, 20–40 nm PdO particles were found (Fig. 6a); while for the other three catalysts, we could not find obvious Pd/PdO particles (Fig. 6b–d). These images illustrated that Pd species were highly dispersed in all the fresh catalysts except the Pd/AlP res.-800 sample, which were in good agreement with the corresponding XRD patterns shown in Fig. 4a.

Specifically, we performed EDS and elemental mappings for the fresh Pd/AlP-mh-800 catalyst to show the distributions of P and Pd (Fig. 7). According to EDS analysis (Fig. 7b), the contents of P and Pd were 1.73 and 0.87 wt%, respectively, which were in line with their actual or nominal values. The elemental mappings of P and Pd suggested that they are both uniformly dispersed (Fig. 7c and d).

Fig. 8 shows the representative TEM images of the aged catalysts. For the aged Pd/AlP res.-800 sample, we could find an obvious phenomenon of the covered Pd species (Fig. 8a), and surface exposed PdO particles were really in the minority. The TEM image further elucidated the seemingly contradictory results between XRD and CO-DRIFTS analyses of the aged Pd/AlP res.-800 sample (Fig. 4b and d); during aging, most of the Pd species were covered by AlPO4 making them unavailable for surface adsorption and catalytic reactions. Other three aged catalysts showed apparent PdO particles with sizes of 100–300 nm (Fig. 8b–d). In particular, we roughly determined the mean PdO particle sizes of aged Pd/AlP-mh-800 and Pd/PB-800 to be 160 nm and 250 nm, respectively. This indicates that the as-developed thermally stable alumina support indeed could endow the Pd catalyst with an enhanced sinter-resistant ability. Considering this a better CO oxidation activity was established (Fig. 3b). However, the role of phosphate in the reaction process needs to further set forth.

3.5 Water-contained CO oxidation reactions and kinetic tests
Water is inevitable in the feed stream of automobile exhaust.30 To test the performance of our newly developed catalyst in a watery atmosphere, 5 vol% water was added in the feed gas. Before tests, all the catalysts were reduced in 5% H2/N2 at 250 °C for 30 min to give an identical Pd0 state. Like non-water CO oxidation test results shown in Fig. 3, no obvious activity difference was found between the two fresh Pd/AlP-mh-800 and Pd/PB-800 catalysts (Fig. S4a, ESI†). Compared with aged Pd/PB-800, about 20 °C was reduced in terms of light-off temperature for aged Pd/AlP-mh-800 (Fig. 9a). In fact, very little water (within 0.1%) was involved in these reactions (Fig. S4b, ESI†); almost all the CO was converted through oxidation. Of course, when we cut off the water in the feed gas, the light-off curves of CO oxidation (data not shown) were almost the same as those shown in Fig. 9a.
Fig. 9 (a) Activity tests of the aged Pd/AlP-mh-800 and Pd/PB-800 catalysts. Feed gas stream: 2% CO, 2% O2 and 5% H2O balanced with N2 (flow rate of 1 L min−1, 100 mg catalyst). The catalysts were reduced in 5% H2/N2 at 200 °C for 30 min before tests. (b) XRD patterns of the aged catalysts after H2 reduction. (c) CO-DRIFTS of the aged catalysts after H2 reduction.

Feed gas stream: 2% CO and 2% O2 balanced with N2. GHSV = 600 000 mL g−1 h−1. TOF was obtained by dividing the total reaction rates over the amount of exposed surface Pd atoms.
Accordingly, the newly developed phosphate modified alumina could indeed bring a better catalytic performance after 1050 °C hydrothermal aging. Furthermore, we would like to work out the role of phosphate in the reactions. For the fresh catalysts, Pd/AlP-mh-800 showed almost the same light-off curve as Pd/PB-800 (Fig. S4a, ESI†), illustrating that phosphate neither had chemistry with Pd species nor affected the dispersion of active sites. However, during the hydrothermal aging process, both phosphate and Pd species aggregated themselves (Fig. 2d and 8), whether they interacted with each other needs further elucidation. Firstly, Pd0 particles existed exclusively after H2 reduction for the aged catalysts with or without phosphate according to XRD analyses (Fig. 9b) and CO-DRIFTS experiments (Fig. 9c). We then measured the Pd dispersions of the two fresh and aged catalysts by pulse CO chemisorption, and the values were 68.21% and 66.73% for the fresh Pd/AlP-mh-800 and Pd/PB-800 catalysts, and 2.11% and 1.23% for the aged Pd/AlP-mh-800 and Pd/PB-800 catalysts, respectively. Based on these data, the TOF plot was drawn for each aged sample (Fig. 9d). From the similar Ea values and linear Arrhenius plots, we concluded that the addition of phosphate in the aged catalyst neither changed the CO oxidation mechanism nor altered the active sites. Phosphate, therefore, is just a structure stabilizer that could effectively suppress the metal particle migration and coalescence.
Fig. 10 shows the TEM images of the aged Pd/AlP-mh-800 and Pd/PB-800 catalysts after H2 reduction, and the insets show the corresponding size distributions of Pd particles. Other representative TEM images of the two aged catalysts are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). According to the statistic results, the mean Pd particle size was 100 nm for the aged Pd/AlP-mh-800 sample, while it was 170 nm for the aged Pd/PB-800 sample. The difference in the mean Pd particle size between the two aged catalysts was in good agreement with the measured Pd dispersions by CO chemisorption. Here it should be noted that the mean particle size of Pd species became smaller after H2 reduction (Fig. 8c, dvs.10), and this phenomenon was also observed by John et al.31

3.6 Durability test of the aged Pd/AlP-mh-800 catalyst
Pd/AlP-mh-800 had a better sinter-resistant ability, which kept 1.7 times higher Pd dispersion than Pd/PB-800 after 1050 °C hydrothermal aging. To further test the durability of the aged Pd/AlP-mh-800 catalyst, a long-term CO oxidation reaction at 290 °C was conducted. CO conversion still retained 100% after the 48 h reaction (Fig. 11a), suggesting a good durability under this reaction condition. The XRD pattern, CO-DRIFTS and TEM images of the used catalyst after the long-term reaction are shown in Fig. 11b, c and d, respectively. In comparison with the data before the reaction, it is concluded that both the state and morphology of Pd species did not change after the long-term reaction. Therefore, the catalyst using phosphate modified alumina developed from AlP fumigation residue has promising potential in high-temperature catalytic applications.

4. Conclusions
A thermally stable alumina material was developed from AlP fumigation residue. By optimizing the ball-milling and hydrolysis conditions, all the AlN was converted into AlOOH, and AlP was transformed into phosphate that adsorbed on the precursor of alumina. This newly developed alumina could keep the surface area as high as 117 m2 g−1 after 1050 °C hydrothermal aging. After aging, the Pd catalyst using this newly developed alumina support had Pd dispersion 1.7 times higher than that of the catalyst using the commercial alumina support, and the light-off temperature of aged Pd/AlP-mh-800 was about 20 °C lower than that of aged Pd/PB-800. All these improvements were attributed to the alumina material free of AlN and retaining moderate phosphate amounts. The reaction kinetics and XPS experiments also showed that phosphate neither involved in the catalytic reaction process nor changed the active sites; phosphate was only a structure stabilizer. The trends of CO oxidation reactions did not change after adding 5% H2O in the feed gas, illustrating the catalyst's good water tolerance. Besides, this catalyst also exhibited an outstanding durability, making it a promising material in automotive exhaust purification and other catalytic applications. This notion of developing value-added materials from waste will guide us to solve more practical problems in both environment and energy fields.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
