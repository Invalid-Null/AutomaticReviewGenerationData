In Situ Generated Boron Peroxo as Mild Oxidant in Propane Oxidative Dehydrogenation Revealed by Density Functional Theory Study
Abstract
Boron-based materials catalyzing oxidative dehydrogenation is emerging as a promising protocol for efficient conversion of light alkanes to olefins, while the origin of its remarkable selectivity remains unclear. By means of density functional theory calculations, this work addresses the crucial role of boron peroxo as the mild oxidant in propane ODH: (1) Surface boron peroxo species can be generated in situ in the presence of peroxo species, preferably at the >B–O–B< sites of the zigzag edge, and show high activity to dehydrogenate propane (ΔG⧧ = 13.5 kcal/mol, ΔG = 8.9 kcal/mol). (2) The >B–O–O· site shows high discriminability of secondary H over primary H of the propane molecule, leading to significantly higher yield of iso-propyl (CH3ĊHCH3) than n-propyl (CH3CH2ĊH2); thus, propene formation is favored over deep oxidation. This provides physical insights into the origin of the remarkable olefin selectivity in the boron-containing ODH catalytic systems.

Recently, as an emerging metal-free catalyst, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has attracted wide attention for its remarkable activity and olefin selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes. (1−3) A consensus has been established that oxygenated boron species on the catalyst surface are responsible for the remarkable catalytic activity, (4) while the speciation of the oxygenated boron sites remains under debate. (1) Earlier experimental (5,6) and computational (7,8) studies showed that the edges/surfaces of h-BN and other boron-containing catalysts dynamically reorganize under the propane ODH (ODHP) conditions, suggesting the possibility of the copresence and/or mutual conversion of various oxygenated boron species. However, this does not solve the puzzles regarding (1) why boron-containing ODH catalytic systems have exceptional olefin selectivity and (2) why experimentally an induction period was observed when using a freshly prepared catalyst but disappeared or was shortened significantly when using spent catalyst. (9,10)
According to experimental measurement, the B/N ratio in the spent catalyst is higher than that in the fresh catalyst (1.30 vs 1.24 in ODHP, (1) 1.51 vs 1.13 in ODHE, (3) or 1.43 vs 1.22 in n-butane ODH (11)) accompanied by the increase of oxygen content, implying the conversion of edge boron nitride species to oxygenated boron species. These findings remind us that it is feasible to form in situ more reactive species, e.g., boron peroxo species, in the oxidative environment.
In an earlier study of the boron-containing ODH catalytic system, we proposed the formation of >B–O–O–B< species at the zigzag edge, (9) which was supported by the recent work of Fu et al. that reported the oxidization of >B–OH groups to >B–O–O–B<. (12) Recently Li et al. (13) reported boron–oxygen–nitrogen nanotubes (BONNTs) enriched with O–O species exhibited remarkable catalytic activity (a propane conversion of 64.4% with an olefin yield of 48.6% at 525 °C, 2.8 times that on boron nitrogen nanotubes). These results suggest the possible participation of boron peroxo species in the ODHP reactions. However, it remains unclear whether and how boron peroxo can form in situ and what roles the boron peroxo species play in ODHP reaction, which was not discussed in earlier studies that mentioned their presence (e.g., refs (9and13)). Unraveling these puzzles can benefit the rational design of boron-containing catalysts with high reactivity and olefin selectivity.
It has been established that the zigzag edge of h-BN is key to its remarkable performance in the ODH reaction to convert propane to propylene with high olein selectivity. (2,9,14) Herein, we focused on two typical zigzag edge sites, zigzag-BOH and zigzag-bri-B edge sites (Figure 1a,b), and explored the in situ formation of boron peroxo species at these two types of sites under the ODHP conditions (zigzag-BOOB and zigzag-bri-BOOB; please see Figure 1c,d); we then studied their catalytic roles of the in situ generated boron peroxo species. The catalytic activity of the peroxo >B–O–O· species was then compared to that of the previously studied >B–O· species to identify their crucial contributions to the high selectivity of propylene in the propane ODH. The in situ generated HOO· and H2O2, which were produced via dehydrogenation of >B–OH or alkane by dioxygen molecules and are reactive in the ODH catalytic systems, (7,15) were used as oxidants to convert the edge boron sites to boron peroxo species.

Peroxo Species at the Zigzag-B Edge (Zigzag-BOOB)
We first focus the discussion on the peroxo species at the zigzag-B edge and do not consider the armchair edge and the zigzag-N edge since in earlier studies these sites were reported to be unstable (16) and the active center of the ODHP preferably located at the B sites at the zigzag edge. (6,9,17)
In Situ Generation of Peroxo Species at the Zigzag-B Edge
Two pathways to transform a zigzag-BOH site (Figure 1a) to a >B–O–O-B< bridge (Figure 1c) via a >B–O–O–H intermediate state were investigated, differing from each other in the active species being ·OOH (Figure 2a, top, red) or HOOH (Figure 2a, bottom, blue). The possible participation of ·OOH and HOOH in the peroxidization of >B–OH sites under the ODHP conditions has been proposed in earlier work, (7,15) while the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.

Color scheme: B in pink, C in gray, N in blue, O in red, and H in white.
Peroxidization by Peroxyl Radical
By using ·OOH as the active species, the reaction at the zigzag-BOH site underwent a transition state zig-BOH_TS1 to form the >B–O–O· group with an H2O molecule released. The Gibbs free-energy barrier was calculated to be 36.20 kcal/mol, and the endergonicity was 12.38 kcal/mol (Figure 2b). This corresponds to the transfer of H4 on the peroxo group ·O6O5-H4 to the O2H3 site (H4···O2 distance of 1.832 Å in zig-BOH_RC1 to 1.167 Å in zig-BOH_TS1), which results in the substitution of the peroxo group for the ·OH group at the zigzag-BOH site (B1–O2 distance of 1.394 Å in zig-BOH_RC1 to 1.561 Å in zig-BOH_TS1) (Figure S2a).
The population analysis showed that the spin density was distributed on the peroxo oxygen atoms (Figure S2b), with 0.287 and 0.724 au on O5 and O6 in zig-BOH_RC1 and 0.223 and 0.751 au on O5 and O6 in zig-BOH_IM1. The slightly larger difference in the spin density between the two peroxo atoms in the >B–O–O· group (0.751–0.223 = 0.528 au) than that in the ·OOH radical (0.724–0.287 = 0.437 au) implied that the former was moderately more active than the latter, which was consistent with the endergonic nature of this reaction step. In the subsequent reaction, the in situ generated >B–O–O· site can activate the C–H bond of propane to form >B–O–O–H, and then dehydrate to form the >B–O–O–B< site with the assistance of the adjacent >B–OH under the ODHP conditions.
Peroxidization by Peroxide
By reacting with HOOH, zigzag-BOH can directly transform into >B–O–OH, and the Gibbs free-energy barrier and the endergonicity were 32.13 and 7.33 kcal/mol, respectively (Figure 2c). Compared with the reaction with ·OOH, the moderately lower barrier (32.13 kcal/mol vs 36.20 kcal/mol) suggested a higher propensity of zigzag-BOH to react with the HOOH species owing to the nucleophilic attack nature of the reaction and the ability of HOOH to donate one of its protons to build a hydrogen bond to stabilize the transition state.
We note that another important intermediate, alkyl hydroperoxide, (7) also contributed significantly to the in situ generation of boron peroxo. In our calculations, as shown in Figure S1, in the presence of isopropyl hydroperoxide (H10–O11–OCH(CH3)2), O11 migrated to B1 to form O11–B1 bond while H10 bonded to O2 at zigzag-BO2H, which eventually produced >B–O11OCH(CH3)2 and H2O. The free-energy barrier and endergonicity of this process were 28.80 and 7.15 kcal/mol, respectively, indicating its kinetic feasibility. The alkyl hydroperoxide, an intermediate in the ODH, can further proceed into deep oxidation. Hence, the capture of alkyl hydroperoxide by the surface boron sites via the above step contributes to the high selectivity of olefins in the ODH.
The above calculations clearly reveal the in situ generation of boron peroxo at the zigzag-BOH edge. The structures of the stationary points are listed in Table S1. Next, we will discuss the activity of boron peroxo catalyzed ODHP reactions at the zigzag-BOH edge.
Boron Peroxo Catalyzed ODHP at the Zigzag-BOH Edge
Understanding the ODHP mechanism of boron-containing catalysts is crucial to the design and optimization of catalysts with high activity, selectivity, and stability. In earlier computational studies, (16) the possibility of >B–O–O–B< as the active site to participate in the ODHP reaction was discussed, and the dehydrogenation of propane was proposed to happen at the >B–O–O–B< site by breaking the O–O bond to form a >B–OC3H7 species and a neighboring >B–OH species. However, the issues of O2 activation and the regeneration of the active site, which are key factors of the mechanism, were not addressed.
In this work, the ODHP by boron peroxo species was considered to start from the hydrolysis of the in situ generated >B–O–O–B< sites to the >B–O–OH and the adjacent >B–OH species with a Gibbs free-energy barrier of 23.75 kcal/mol and an exergonicity of −0.77 kcal/mol (RC → TS1 → IM1, Figure 3), revealing slightly thermodynamic favorability. The detailed structural information is listed in Table S2.
Figure 3
Figure 3. Gibbs free-energy profile of ODHP reaction catalyzed by boron peroxo (>B–O–O–B<) species at the zigzag-BOH edge.
O2 activation plays a key role in boron-based ODHP catalytic systems, (5,7,14,16) and it triggers the ODHP reaction. As shown in Figure 3, DFT calculations revealed that the barrier to the activation of oxygen molecules at the >B–O–OH site is 32.66 kcal/mol (IM1′ → TS2 → IM2), which is significantly lower than that at the >B–OH site (>50 kcal/mol), (5,7) implicating their superior reactivity. It is thus reasonable to expect that the experimentally observed disappearance or sharp shortening of the induction period when using spent h-BN catalysts (9,10) is associated with the conservation of boron peroxo species that formed during the previous catalytic run on the spent catalysts (Figure S3). Note that, concerning the complexity of the propane dehydrogenation reaction network, (7,18−20) the pathway in Figure 3 represents an optimum channel involving the participation of >B–O–O–B< at the zigzag-BOH edge, and there are other copresent on- and off-surface channels which are not discussed here for simplicity.
Figure S4a shows the bond length variation of dioxygen O13–O14, which increased from 1.214 Å (IM1′) to 1.332 Å (IM2), indicating the activation of the dioxygen molecule. In view of the similar bond length of key chemical bonds in TS2 and IM2, e.g., for O13–O14 (1.305 Å in TS2 vs 1.332 Å in IM2) and for O13–H12 (1.043 Å in TS2 vs 0.993 Å in IM2), TS2 is a late transition state. Furthermore, the free-energy change of TS2 and IM2 is 32.66 and 31.44 kcal/mol, respectively, which is consistent with the Hammond postulate. (21)
The population analysis (Figure S4b) showed that the spin density did not accumulate at the boron atom but distributed on the oxygen atoms of the activated dioxygen molecule (·OOH) and the >B–O–O· group. These active oxygen-containing species then participated in the activation of the C–H bond of propane to produce propylene.
Peroxo Species at the Zigzag-bri-B Sites (Zigzag-bri-BOOB)
Next, we will discuss the dynamic formation of boron peroxo species and the ODHP reaction mechanism at zigzag-bri-B sites, which are thermodynamically highly stable and considered as one of the main forms of h-BN edges in the oxidative environment.
In Situ Generation of Peroxo Species at the Zigzag-bri-B Edge
Two pathways for the conversion of >B–O–B< bridge to >B–O–O–B< bridge at zigzag-bri-B edge were studied (Figure 4) by ·OOH radicals (path 1, red line in Figure 4a) and HOOH groups (path 2, blue line in Figure 4a), respectively. The corresponding free-energy profiles are plotted in Figure 4b,c. Initially, >B–O–B< (zig-bri_RS) hydrolyzed to generate two adjacent >B–OH groups (zig-bri_IM1); then in path 1, one of the >B–OH groups reacted with ·OOH to form a tetra-coordinated boron–oxygen intermediate (zig-bri_IM2) with a free-energy barrier of 34.98 kcal/mol. Then, zig-bri_IM2 could quickly remove a water molecule to recover the tricoordinated boron peroxo species. In path 2, HOOH groups approached the >B–OH site via zig-bri_TS5 to form a tetra-coordinated boron–oxygen species (zig-bri_IM5) with a free-energy barrier of 27.90 kcal/mol, which was 7.08 kcal/mol lower than that in path 1, showing that >B–OH is inclined to react with HOOH group. Then, zig-bri_IM5 released an H2O molecule to generate the boron peroxo species with an exergonicity of −13.44 kcal/mol, verifying its thermodynamic favorability. After the formation of >B–O–OH, it could complete the dehydration with the assistance of the adjacent >B–OH to generate the >B–O–O–B< site (zig-bri_IM4), and the free-energy barrier and free-energy change were 29.23 and 3.47 kcal/mol, respectively.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Two pathways of in situ generation of boron peroxo species at the >B–OH site of the zigzag-bri-B edge: (a) schematic elucidation of the two pathways; (b and c) the corresponding free-energy profiles from DFT calculations.
The >B–O–B< is thermodynamically highly stable and shows no or very low catalytic activity. However, in the presence of trace water, it can easily hydrolyze to >B–OH groups to exhibit catalytic activity. This is considered to be one of the reasons that in experimental studies the presence of water was observed to promote the conversion of alkanes. (2,5,9,14,15)
Besides its ability to hydrolyze, according to our calculations, the >B–O–B< bridge can also react directly with the intermediate species HOOH to breed the boron peroxo group. As shown in Figure S5, the HOOH approaches the >B–O–B< bridge to break the bridge and generate >B–O–OH and the adjacent >B–OH group. This reaction has a free-energy barrier of 30.06 kcal/mol and an endergonicity of 14.25 kcal/mol, indicating its feasibility under the ODH conditions. The nascent >B–O–OH site can then activate the gaseous oxygen molecules to further promote the ODHP reaction.
Boron Peroxo Species Catalyzed ODHP at the Zigzag-bri-B Edge
An ODHP reaction pathway catalyzed by >B–O–O–B< at zigzag-bri-B edge is shown in Figure 5, and the corresponding structures of the stationary points are shown in the Supporting Information (Table S4). The hydrolysis of >B–O–O–B< to the >B–O–OH was exergonic by −3.47 kcal/mol. Then, the O2 activation step proceeded via TS2 with a free-energy barrier of 30.90 kcal/mol, which was similar to that at the zigzag-BOH edge (32.66 kcal/mol, Figure 3). The transition state of the following propane dehydrogenation step at the active surface boron peroxo sites (>B–O–O·) has a free-energy barrier (TS3) of 13.56 kcal/mol and the reaction is endergonic by 8.98 kcal/mol. Isopropyl, obtained via TS3, is an important intermediate for the formation of propylene. The nascent isopropyl can then react with an ·OOH radical to form C3H6 and HOOH with a free-energy barrier of 1.51 kcal/mol, and the reaction is exergonic by −41.34 kcal/mol.

The surface >B–O–O· group can also activate the primary C–H bond of propane to give n-propyl (·CH2CH2CH3). Unlike isopropyl, the decomposition of n-propyl, which breaks the C–C bond to form an ethylene molecule and a methyl radical, competes with its addition of a molecular oxygen (22) and results in the deep oxidation of alkanes. This suggests that the preferable formation of isopropyl radical plays a key role in the high propylene selectivity.
Kinetic Preference of Boron Peroxo Species to Dehydrogenate 2°-H
Selective activation of the C–H bond in alkanes in the exothermic oxidation route is an important step in the formation of olefin products. In Figure 6, we plotted the Gibbs free-energy profiles for the activation of C–H bonds of propane by the >B–O· and >B–O–O· groups at the zigzag-BOH (Figure 6a) and zigzag-bri-B sites (Figure 6b). The results showed that the >B–O· and >B–O–O· groups were more facile to dehydrogenate the secondary hydrogen (2°-H) than the primary hydrogen (1°-H) of propane, which was consistent with the fact that the C–H bond energy of the methylene group (98.1 kcal/mol) (23) is lower than that of the methyl group (100.9 kcal/mol) in the propane molecule. (24)
Figure 6
Figure 6. Gibbs free-energy profiles of the dehydrogenation of the primary (1°-H) and the secondary (2°-H) hydrogen of propane at the zigzag-BOH site (a) and the zigzag-bri-B site (b). The black (1°-H) and red (2°-H) lines represent the dehydrogenation by >B–O·, and the blue (1°-H) and green (2°-H) lines represent the dehydrogenation by >B–O–O·.
In view of the stronger dehydrogenation ability (lower free-energy barrier) of >B–O· groups than >B–O–O· groups at both types of edge sites, the >B–O· group was more active than the >B–O–O· group (e.g., ΔG⧧2°-H = 6.45 kcal/mol by >B–O· vs ΔG⧧2°-H = 14.99 kcal/mol by >B–O–O·, Figure 6a). Furthermore, the nature of exothermic reaction of the dehydrogenation by >B–O· and the nature of endothermic reaction of the dehydrogenation by >B–O–O· also showed higher activity of the >B–O· group. The population analysis (at zigzag-BOH site, Figure S6) showed that the spin density of the >B–O· group was mainly distributed on the oxygen atom (0.888 au), while that of the >B–O–O· group was dispersed on the two oxygen atoms of the peroxo group (0.751 and 0.225 au), which results in the higher activity of the >B–O· group.
Although the high activity of the >B–O· group resulted in a better dehydrogenation performance than the >B–O–O· group, it harmed the high selectivity for olefins. As seen in Figure 6, the >B–O–O· site has better discriminability to favor the dehydrogenation of 2°-H over 1°-H than the >B–O· site (6.62 vs 3.27 kcal/mol at the zigzag-BOH edge, and 4.16 vs 0.64 kcal/mol at the zigzag-bri-B edge).
Based on our computed energy barriers and the Eyring equation, we calculated the rate coefficient ratio of H abstraction by >B–O· and >B–O–O· group at the zigzag-BOH site to predict the molar ratio of isopropyl to n-propyl (denoted as CH3ĊHCH3/·CH2CH2CH3) (Table S6). The calculation results showed that the dehydrogenation selectivity of the >B–O· group was CH3ĊHCH3/·CH2CH2CH3 = 2.22 at 490 °C under ODHP conditions, while that of the >B–O–O· group was CH3ĊHCH3/·CH2CH2CH3 = 34.95. Even when the temperature reached 550 °C, the H abstraction selectivity of the >B–O–O· group remained as high as CH3ĊHCH3/·CH2CH2CH3 = 25.73, while that of the >B–O· group was reduced to CH3ĊHCH3/·CH2CH2CH3 = 1.86.
The higher selectivity of the >B–O–O· site for isopropyl than that of >B–O· site has important consequence on the product distribution owing to the intrinsically different preference for C–C and C–H bond cleavage of isopropyl from that of n-propyl. According to the literature, for isopropyl, the bond energy of the primary C–H bond (CH3ĊHCH2–H, 35.9 kcal/mol) (25) is significantly lower than that of the C–C bond (ĊH2–CH3, 100.0 kcal/mol). (24) In contrast, for n-propyl, the bond energy of the second C–H bond (·CH2(CH3)CH–H, 33.0 kcal/mol) (25) is higher than that of the C–C bond (·CH2CH2–CH3, 23.7 kcal/mol). (24) These data show that the isopropyl radical has a higher propensity to convert to propylene than n-propyl radical.
Considering that the ·CH2CH2CH3 radical has a higher propensity than CH3ĊHCH3 radical to decompose to ethene and ·CH3, which leads to deep oxidation, it is conceivable that the CH3ĊHCH3 radical has more chance to capture a molecular oxygen to form the i-C3H7OO· species, which eventually decomposes to propylene. (22) This indicates that with higher activity for hydrogen abstraction while lower discriminability of primary or secondary H, the reaction at the >B–O· site would have relatively lower selectivity for propylene product than that at the >B–O–O· site. Accordingly, the knowledge that the >B–O–O· group has mild dehydrogenation activity and high CH3ĊHCH3 selectivity can assist the design of new active sites for boron-containing catalysts. This finding complements our recent work (26) on the unique ability of boron-based materials to suppress deep oxidation of light alkanes, in which we proposed that the surface boron sites may eliminate alkoxyl radicals, which are key intermediates along the deep oxidation pathways.
Origin of Higher Reactivity of Zigzag-bri-B Sites than Zigzag-B–OH Sites
It is noteworthy that both the >B–O· group and >B–O–O· group at the zigzag-bri-B site exhibit higher dehydrogenation activity than their counterparts at the zigzag-BOH site. This, together with the data that show marginally lower barrier to the activation of dioxygen at the zigzag-bri-B sites than at the zigzag-BOH sites (ΔG⧧ = 30.90 kcal/mol at zigzag-bri-B site vs ΔG⧧ = 32.66 kcal/mol at zigzag-BOH site, as shown in Figures 5 and 3, respectively.), indicates that the catalytic activity of the zigzag-bri-B site is higher than that of the zigzag-BOH site.
The difference between the two sites is attributed to the coordination environment of the B atom, that is, the B atom is embraced by two O atoms and an N atom at the zigzag-bri-B site, while at the zigzag-BOH site the B atom connected with two N atoms and an O atom (Figure S7). This reminds us that the degree of oxidation of the B atom can be correlated with its catalytic activity. This is confirmed by the enhanced H abstraction activity of >B–O· groups and >B–O–O· groups in the boron oxide models, where the B atom is embraced in a homoleptic coordination environment by the O atom (Figure S8). The calculation results are also consistent with the experimental finding that there is a significant increase in the quantity of oxygenated boron species in the spent h-BN catalyst.
In summary, by evaluating the stability of the in situ generated boron peroxo species and their promotion of the propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with DFT calculations, this work identified that surface boron peroxo species (>B–O–O·, >B–O–OH, and >B–O–O–B<) can be generated in situ in the presence of peroxo species, preferably at the >B–O–B< sites of the zigzag edge. Such species is thermodynamically stable and, under ODH conditions, reactive toward propane dehydrogenation. This solves the puzzle of the significant shortening or disappearance of the induction period when using the spent catalyst in ODH. As mild oxidants, boron peroxo species exhibit a much higher preference to dehydrogenate the secondary H than the primary H of propane molecule, which explains the remarkable selectivity for propylene and the suppression of deep oxidation owing to the higher propensity of iso-propyl to break its primary C–H bond (CH3ĊHCH2–H) than its C–C (CH3ĊH–CH3) bond. Their rich presence on the surface of boron-containing catalysts improves the catalytic activity of the catalysts, enhances the selectivity for olefin products, and suppresses the deep oxidation of alkanes. This knowledge enriches our understanding of the boron-based ODH catalytic systems and benefits the optimization and rational design of boron-containing ODH catalysts with improved performance.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
