 Based on the analysis of the supplied document, this does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The document discusses density functional theory calculations on propane and propene adsorption on Pt and PtSn alloy surfaces, but does not mention conversion of propane to propylene or include any experimental catalyst testing data. Since it does not pertain to PDH or ODH specifically, I will not extract catalyst details or performance enhancements.
