Based on the multiple document extracts provided, none of them seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation research. The documents focus on the catalytic oxidation of diesel soot using CexZr1-xO2 catalysts prepared by different methods, and do not contain any information related to converting propane to propylene via dehydrogenation reactions. Since the provided extracts do not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation, I have indicated that they are not relevant in the XML output. Let me know if you would like me to review any other extracts that may be more pertinent to summarizing propane dehydrogenation research.
