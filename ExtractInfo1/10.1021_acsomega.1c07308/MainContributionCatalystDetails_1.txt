The given document does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation, as it focuses on the catalytic oxidation of diesel soot. The document discusses the use of CexZr1-xO2 catalysts prepared by different methods for soot combustion, but does not mention propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. No information is provided on converting propane to propylene. Therefore, I have indicated that the document is not relevant.
