The given document discusses MgF2-modified hydrotalcite-derived composites supported Pt-In catalysts for isobutane direct dehydrogenation, not propane dehydrogenation. It does not relate to either Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) or Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH) for converting propane to propylene.
