The given documents discuss MgF2-modified hydrotalcite-derived catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation, not propane dehydrogenation. None of the documents relate to Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) or Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH) for converting propane to propylene. Therefore, these documents are not relevant to propane dehydrogenation research.
