 Based on the details provided in the document, this does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses alkane dehydrogenation reactions on zeolites in general, but does not focus specifically on propane dehydrogenation to propylene. As such, I cannot extract the requested information about catalyst performance for propane dehydrogenation.
