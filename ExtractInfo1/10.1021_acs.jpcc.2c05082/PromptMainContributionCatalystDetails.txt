Promoting Catalytic Activity of Boron by Phosphor in Propane Oxidative Dehydrogenation
Abstract
Metal-free boron-containing materials show excellent performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) reaction, while it remains unclear how the composition of the materials may influence their catalytic activity. Herein, by using boron phosphide (BP) as the test bed, a density functional theory study of the influences of P atoms in the backbone and the extent of surface oxidation on the catalytic activity was reported to address the structure–catalytic activity relationship in the ODHP reaction. The calculations show that (1) the P element in BP may influence the composition of the occupied states of BP (P, 47.3%; O, 98.8%; and N, 81.7%) and bring significant impact on its properties. The influence of O in the B2O3 (O) and N in the h-BN (N) was also analyzed for comparison. (2) The more oxidized surface (BP-H) is more reactive than the less oxidized surface (BP-L) in view of the lower free-energy barrier to the rate-determining step (45.8 vs 57.3 kcal/mol for the dehydrogenation of propane step, respectively). This study explains the role of the P element and the effect of surface oxidation and provides a comprehensive understanding of the structure–activity relationship of boron-containing materials in ODHP.

ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propylene is regarded as one of the most important building blocks for producing polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, and related chemicals. (1,2) Propylene is primarily produced by direct dehydrogenation (DH), which is endothermic, equilibrium limited, and requires significant energy input. (3) Currently, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is considered as an economically and environmentally friendly route to produce about 10% of the global propylene. (4) The direct DH is endothermic in nature; to achieve acceptable conversion and high yield of target olefins, substantial energy input and high temperature are required, and the overall energy efficiency is limited. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) offers a promising alternative to the industrialized PDH. (5,6) Previous studies showed that the supported vanadium oxide catalysts possess promising activity for ODHP, however, one challenge is the serious overoxidation to COx, causing significant CO2 emission. (7) Since the independent pioneering work of Hermans, (8,9) Lu, (10,11) and Su, (12) the metal-free hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) has been established as an unique and hitherto unanticipated catalyst for the ODHP to corresponding olefins with impressive selectivity.
Follow-up work demonstrated that various boron-containing catalytic materials (silicon boride, (13) elemental boron, (14) boron oxide, (15) and boron phosphate (16)) exhibit higher catalytic properties (e.g., 80% selectivity at 8% conversion) to propylene than previous state-of-the-art-supported vanadium oxide catalysts (e.g., 60% selectivity at 8% conversion). These studies show that the boron is the key player to achieve high propylene selectivity to propylene. Among candidate boron-based materials, cubic boron phosphide (BP) is a III-V compound semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 2.0 eV. (17) Their prominent mechanical and electronic properties and superior thermal stability (to 1400 K in air) make them promising candidates for a wide range of catalytic applications. (18) Here, inspired by the charming property of BP and expecting a deep discussion of the reaction mechanism, the possibility of the ODHP reaction catalyzed by BP is explored and systematically studied by theoretical calculations.
Efforts have been devoted to the elucidation of the ODH mechanism to assist the optimization of the catalytic system. (15,19−22) The catalytic activity is now believed to strongly correlate with the oxygenated B active sites [B–O, B–OH, and B(OH)xO3–x], and both surface-mediated and gas-phase processes coexist during the ODHP reaction. (4,23) However, due to a lack of key evidence, there are debates on the effective reaction channel and the inhibited or promoted effect of the support on the activity. (24,25) So far, a systematic understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism catalyzed by B-containing material BP is missing, and the effect of oxidation degree and the presence of the second element, such as P, on the reaction activity need to be clarified. This motivated the present study.
A computational method has been applied in the study of electronic properties, which could evaluate the influence of catalytic activity with high accuracy. (26,27) In this work, we have examined the ODHP reaction catalyzed by BP with different oxidation degrees, and the whole reaction is partitioned into three stages, that is the initiation, the propagation, and the termination. Section 2 provides brief information of the methodology used in this study, and all structures, including isolated intermediate and transition states, were optimized at B3LYP-D3/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory. Section 3 presents the results obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, natural bond orbital (NBO), non-covalent interactions (NCI), and frontier molecular orbital (FMO) analyses to understand how the second element P could influence material properties of BP and why surfaces with higher coverage of hydroxyl groups are favored. This work is summarized in Section 4. This work is expected to offer implications to improve our understanding on the ODH reaction catalyzed by boron-based catalysts and benefit the design and optimization of boron-containing catalysts with improved activity in the alkane ODH reactions.

Quantum chemistry calculations are carried out using Gaussian 09 package. (28) All stationary points are obtained at the B3LYP-D3/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory (with the default D3 dispersion correction proposed by Grimme). (29−31) The default convergence criteria have been used during the geometrical optimization. The use of employed methodology have been qualified and the influence of diffuse function, basis set, and dispersion correction for similar B-containing catalysts h-BN and B2O3 are evaluated in our previous work. (32,33) Vibrational frequency calculations (34) are conducted to identify the stationary points as minimum energy structures or transition states at the same level of the theory. Intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) has been investigated to verify that each transition state can connect two minima along the reaction pathway. (35,36) The single-point energies for all stationary points were calculated at the B3LYP-D3/6-311++G(2df,2pd) level of theory. Gibbs free energies and electronic energies are evaluated at 298.15 K and 1 atm. All compounds are calculated in the gas phase. Natural population analysis (NPA) performed by NBO 6.0 scheme is used to quantitatively view the atomic charge transfer. (37−40) Optimized structures were generated using CYLview. (41) For the following discussion, the CH2 atoms of propane are numbered, as shown in Figure 1.

3.1. Activation of Surface Sites
To understand the mechanism of the ODHP reaction catalyzed by the BP catalyst, it is crucial to identify the active sites responsible for the catalytic ability. The previous research shows that the B–OH sites can not only be created during the fabrication of the catalysts but also bred by hydrolyzing the surface B–O–B bridges in the backbone dynamically during the reaction, which promote the catalytic reaction. (42) The distribution of >B–OH sites further enhanced the amorphousness of the surface and promoted the catalytic reaction with an increased olefin selectivity. Herein, as shown in Figure 2, two catalyst models were prepared, differing in the coverage of hydroxyl groups at the surface B sites with BP-H model fully hydroxylated and BP-L model hydroxylated at two neighboring B sites. By comparing the catalytic reactions on these two surface models, the influence of P atom and the surface oxidation are analyzed.
Figure 2
Figure 2. Two catalyst models: (a) fully surface-hydroxylated model BP-H (neutral, 112 atoms, and closed shell). (b) Doubly hydroxylated model BP-L (neutral, 102 atoms, and closed shell). Color scheme: B in pink and P in orange.
The ODHP reaction starts from the activation of atmospheric dioxygen at the >B–OH site, which generates two active species, >BO• and •OOH. In this stage, both polyhydroxy-substituted and oligo-substituted surfaces are considered (Table 1, entry 1–4). The results show that the free-energy barriers to the DH of B–OH by O2(S1) and O2(T0) are 21.3 and 33.4 kcal/mol on BP-H and 30.5 and 39.0 kcal/mol on BP-L, respectively. The high reaction barriers implicate that an induction period may exist in the BP-catalyzed ODHP reaction, similar to the reactions in other boron-based catalytic systems. (21,32,33,43,44) These data also suggest that transition states H-TS1-1 and H-TS1-2 (catalyzed by BP-H) are more stabilized than L-TS1-1 and L-TS1-2 (catalyzed by BP-L) by 9.2 and 6.6 kcal/mol, respectively, indicating that it is easier to generate active >B–O• species on the BP-H catalyst than that on BP-L during the DH reaction.

3.2. ODHP Mechanism Catalyzed by BP
A possible mechanism for ODHP catalyzed by BP is explored, and the schematic diagram is shown in Figure 3 using BP-H as a representative.
Figure 3
Figure 3. Schematic diagram of the stepwise DH reaction at the >B–O• active site.
In the first C–H cleavage step, a C–1o-H/C–2o-H bond cleavage of propane was considered for pathway a and pathway b (Figure 3), respectively. In pathway a/b, a 1o-H/2o-H (numbering in Figure 1) atom of propane approaches the O1 atom bonded to B1 and forms a transition state H-TS2-1/H-TS2-2 featured by a partially cleaved H–C bond and a partially formed BO–H bond (B–O···H···C), which then proceeds to generate the •C3H7 species (H-IM2-1/H-IM2-2). The nascent •C3H7 species, with the assistance of gaseous oxygenated radical, such as •OH and •OOH, could further undergo DH to form C3H6. A previous study has shown that the gaseous channel cannot be ignored in the formation of propylene from •C3H7 species, and the detailed processes have been addressed. (33)
Both the BP-H and BP-L model have been considered for 1o-H and 2o-H abstraction at the surface >BO• sites. The calculation results show that in the transition state (TS) of the BP-H model system, the C–1o-H and C–2o-H bonds of propane are lengthened from 1.09 to 1.34 Å (entry 5, as shown in Table 2) and 1.28 Å (entry 6), respectively. The corresponding H···O distance is 1.21 and 1.28 Å, respectively, showing a later transition state for the abstraction of C–1o-H than for that of C–2o-H at the >BO• sites of BP-H. This reaction step activates propane to the form a •C3H7 radical and recovers the resting state of the BP-H catalyst. The reaction free-energy barrier and free-energy change are calculated to be 26.3 and 8.9 kcal/mol (H-TS2-1) for the reaction at the primary H site (1°-H, entry 5, as shown in Table 2) and 13.0 and −2.0 kcal/mol (H-TS2-2) for that at the secondary H site (2°-H, entry 6, as shown in Table 2).
Table 2. Key Stationary Points and Relative Free Energies (ΔG≠ and ΔG) in the Dehydrogenation of the Propane by the Active >B–O• Species of BP-H and BP-L
At the >B–O• site of the BP-L model, the ODHP reaction occurs in a similar way, and the structures and energies of the stationary points are collected in Table 2 (entry 7 and entry 8). In the transition states L-TS2-1 and L-TS2-2, the C–(1°/2°)H bonds of propane are lengthened to 1.32 and 1.28 Å, and the two hydrogen atoms move close to the oxygen atoms with distances of 1.23 and 1.28 Å, respectively. These values show that, same as in the BP-H system, the DH at the secondary-C site (L-TS2-2) has an earlier transition state than that at the primary-C site (L-TS2-1). Accordingly, the free-energy barrier to the former (16.8 kcal/mol, L-TS2-2) is lower than that to the latter (29.6 kcal/mol, L-TS2-1), which is consistent with the Hammond postulate. (45) Both reactions are endergonic with the former (3.2 kcal/mol) more favorable than the latter (13.7 kcal/mol). These data indicate that BP-H exhibits a higher reactivity toward the activation of propane than BP-L both from kinetic and thermodynamic viewpoints.
The •C3H7 radical may then evolve to olefin products via another H-abstraction step in the gas phase (Table 3, entry 9–10) or on the BP surface (Table 3, entry 11 and 12). All of the 1o-H-transfer processes assisted by gaseous •OH and •OOH radicals are found to be fast processes (TS3-1, 5.6 kcal/mol and TS3-2, 14.6 kcal/mol), indicating that the DH of •C3H7 may undergo the gas phase channels in addition to the surface channels which are calculated to be barrierless, and the contributions of the on-surface and the gaseous channels may be determined by the diffusion of the propyl radicals and appropriate collisions.

3.3. Reactivity Regulated by the Coverage of Hydroxyl Groups on the BP Surface
The free-energy profiles are plotted in Figure 4 for the optimum pathways of the ODHP reaction catalyzed by the BP-H and BP-L models, including DH of the BP surface, and the two sequential DH steps of the propane. The computed free-energy barriers to these three steps catalyzed by BP-H are 21.3, 25.3, and 5.6 kcal/mol, respectively, with the first and the second steps kinetically more favorable than those in the BP-L model system by 9.2 and 3.0 kcal/mol, respectively. This suggests that kinetically higher coverage of hydroxyl groups on the surface B sites (BP-H) favors the ODHP reactions catalyzed by BP.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Free-energy profile of the favorable ODHP reaction pathways on BP-H (in blue) and BP-L (in red) models.
In experimental studies, depending on the type of light alkanes and the composition of boron-containing catalysts, the optimal temperature for the ODH reactions is in the range of 450–600 °C. (4) On hexagonal boron nitride, a temperature of around 530 °C and an activation energy Ea of 213 kJ/mol (50.7 kcal/mol) for dioxygen activation and of 184 kJ/mol (44.4 kcal/mol) for propane conversion were reported for the ODH of propane. (10) In another work, an activation energy of about 250 kJ/mol (59.5 kcal/mol) was reported for the propane conversion. (8) The value of 45.8 kcal/mol obtained in this work suggested that the reaction temperature in the BP-catalyzed ODH could be predicted to be lower than 530 °C. Population analysis (Figures S1 and S2) showed that prior to the DH steps of the propane, the spin density mainly distributed on the oxygen atoms of the active >B–O• species of BP-H and BP-L. The hydrogen transfer from propane to the >B–O• site paired the unpaired electron on the O of the >B–O• site, leaving the spin density dominantly on the carbon atoms of the propyl radical in H-IM2-2 and L-IM2-2 (Figure S2).
To understand quantitatively the electrostatic interaction and interpret the activation free energies during the DH of propane, NPA was conducted, and the NPA atomic charges of O, H, and C atoms in the active region of H-RC2-2, H-TS2-2, L-RC2-2, and L-TS2-2 are listed in Figures 5 and 6.

Figure 6
Figure 6. Structures of key stationary points in the ODHP reaction catalyzed by the BP-L model. The sub-layer of BP-L is blurred to highlight the surface layer.
During the DH of the propane, there is charge transfer between O1/H1 and the BP surface (O1/H1 charge changes from −0.701/0.231 e in H-RC2-2 to −0.824/0.376 e in H-TS2-2) (Figure 5). The enhanced electron-rich nature of surface O atom in BP-H may be responsible for the catalytic activity of BP in the ODH reaction. The charges of O1 in L-RC2-2 (−0.655 e) and L-TS2-2 (−0.773 e) are less negative than those in H-RC2-2 (−0.701 e) and H-TS2-2 (−0.824 e). These results suggested that more presence of hydroxyl groups on the BP surface can enhance the electrostatic interaction to regulate the catalytic activity of the reaction sites.
The evolution of the averaged atomic charges of the B, P, and O atoms of BP-H and BP-L surfaces during the first two reaction steps is plotted in Figure 7 to show the redistribution of atomic charges. The results show that the average charges for all the B atoms and the P atoms attached to −BOH group in the BP-H model are marginally or moderately more negative than those in the BP-L model, and the atomic charges of their buried P atoms are roughly the same. This suggests that the hydroxyl groups on the surface could improve the extent of surface oxidation by regulating the charge of the oxygen, boron, and phosphorus atoms and enhance the structure–catalytic activity.

To investigate the effect of surface hydroxyl groups on the reaction energy barrier of the rate-determining step, we performed NCI analysis to further explore the contribution of dominant interactions to the stabilization of transition states H-TS2-2 and L-TS2-2. As seen in Figure 8, the total number of noncovalent interactions in H-TS2-2 is more than that in L-TS2-2. In addition, a series of O–H···O hydrogen bond interactions form between the neighboring >B–OH on the surface of BP catalyst in H-TS2-2. We noticed that the contributions of the >B–OH groups in the hydrogen bonding interactions (blue regions, O–H···O and C–H···O) in the H-TS2-2 are relatively more prominent than that of single C–H···O in L-TS2-2.

To further shed light on the changes of key bonds B–O, O–H, and C–H in transition states H-TS2-2 (BP-H) and L-TS2-2 (BP-L), topological analysis based on Bader’s quantum theory of atoms in molecules (AIM) was carried out. The AIM analysis allows one to identify the nature of a bonding interaction between atoms through the analysis of the electronic properties at the bond critical point (bcp). (46−48) A hydrogen bond can be justified by the existence of a bcp between the interacting hydrogen and hydrogen acceptor. (49) The calculated electron density (ρbcp), Laplacian of electron density (∇2ρbcp), and hydrogen bond distances at the bcps of the hydrogen bonds are listed in Table S1. The ρ values for the O1–H1 bond indicated that the covalency of the O1–H1 bond in H-TS2-2 (0.2862) is stronger than that in L-TS2-2 (0.1402). In the meantime, the O–H bond in BP-H (∇2ρ = 0.1949) has less ionicity than that in BP-L (∇2ρ = 0.5145), suggesting that the O–H bond in BP-H is better prepared to accept an H atom from propane via homogeneous cleavage of the H1–C1 bond. Therefore, the transfer of H1 from C1 to O1 in the BP surface with higher coverage of hydroxyl groups has more hydrogen atom transfer characteristics.
In Figure 9, the FMOs of H-TS2-2 and L-TS2-2 are shown to demonstrate the orbital interactions between propane and the surface active sites, and there is less repulsive interaction between the 2p orbital of O(B<) site and the σ orbital of the C1–H1 bond in the former than that in the latter. Meanwhile, the HOMO–LUMO gap, which is defined as the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and can be used to differentiate the chemical reactivity of molecules, is narrower in H-TS2-2 (1.53 eV) than that in L-TS2-2 (3.27 eV), as seen in Figure 9. These results show that the coverage of hydroxyl groups on the BP surface modulates the surface electronic properties, and the higher coverage results in the contribution of larger surface area in the HOMO orbitals that may facilitate the approach of propane to the active >B–O• sites on the surface.

3.4. Role of the Second Element of B-Containing Catalysts
The metal-free B-containing materials, such as h-BN, B2O3, B substance, and BP, have been reported to exhibit high catalytic performance in the ODHP reaction. Moreover, novel metal borate catalysts such as CoB4O7 and NiB2O6 are synthesized and exhibited remarkable structural stability, which can effectively inhibit boron leaching. (6) In these materials, the second element is used as a frame support to wrap boron atoms, and it can also assist in the formation of oxygenated sites to activate the reaction. Therefore, understanding the role of the second element is expected to benefit the development of novel boron-containing catalysts with improved olefin selectivity. For this purpose, the total and partial density of states (TDOS and PDOS) of h-BN, B2O3, B element, and BP are calculated and compared to address this issue (Figure 10).
Figure 10
Figure 10. Analysis of density of states of four boron-containing materials: (a) element B, (b) B2O3, (c) BN, and (d) BP. TDOS: total density of states; PDOS: partial density of states.
The DOS analysis of B cluster is used as the reference in the comparative analysis (Figure 10a). To better understand how the O, N, and P insertion changes the molecular orbital energies and HOMO–LUMO gaps, we plotted the TDOS for h-BN, B2O3, and BP in Figure 10b–d. The partial densities of states (PDOS) of the second element in each system are also given to evaluate their contribution to the TDOS. The vertical dashed line indicates the position of the HOMO level. Compared to the pure B substance, the presence of the second element significantly influences the density of states and widens the HOMO–LUMO gap. Furthermore, it is interesting to see that in all of the three catalysts with binary components, the presence of the second element reorganizes the DOS in the frontier region energetically from more discrete distribution to more band-like distribution. The contribution of the second element becomes less and less from O to N to P in view of the difference between their PDOS and the TDOS of each catalyst (O, N, and P, as shown in Figure 10b–d, respectively).
The highest occupied orbital (HOMO) of the B2O3, h-BN, and BP is mainly composed of the orbital of O, N, and P atoms, respectively. The analysis shows that the major components of the highest occupied orbital (HOMO) of the B2O3 cluster is composed of the px, py, and pz orbitals of the O atom (98.8%). This value decreases to 81.7% (N) and 47.3% (P) in h-BN and BP, respectively. These data indicate the significant contributions of the oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus orbitals to the corresponding molecular orbitals of B2O3, h-BN, and BP.
The condensed Fukui functions are used to describe the nucleo- and electrophilicity of B and H sites of these three catalysts (Figure 11). The Fukui functions were obtained through a finite difference approach for the kth atom in the molecule under consideration. Here, the condensed Fukui indices were calculated using the atomic Hirschfeld charges obtained from population analysis. (50−52) These calculations show that the values of S–/S+ and S+/S– for these three B sites follow the order of Bb > Bc > Ba, and the S–/S+ is higher than S+/S– in all these B-containing materials. The electronegativity of B (2.00 in the Pauling scale) is weaker than that of oxygen (3.44), nitrogen (3.04), and phosphorus (2.19) atoms, and the nucleophilicity is determined by the ability of B to donate electrons for bonding and its ability to accept external electrons in its empty 2pz orbital. In these three catalysts, the nucleophilicity of the catalysts is slightly stronger than their electrophilicity (higher S–/S+ than S+/S–, as shown in Figure 11), and the nucleophilicity of BP is almost the same as the BN catalyst. Among these three H active sites, the Ha of BP shows stronger nucleophilic activity in view of its higher relative nucleophilicity index (S–/S+).

4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In this work, a systematic study is carried out to explore the possibility of the metal-free ODHP reaction catalyzed by B-containing material BP. Two possible active oxidized BP layers, differing in the coverage of hydroxyl groups at the surface B sites, with BP-H fully hydroxylated and BP-L hydroxylated at two neighboring B sites, are studied by the B3LYP-D3 functional with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set. The whole reaction proceeds with a stepwise mechanism encompassing three stages: the DH of the surface, the activation of dioxygen to trigger the reaction, and the two sequential DH steps of propane to produce the propene product. The results show that the free-energy barriers to the DH of >B–OH by O2(S1) and O2(T0) are lower on BP-H than that on BP-L. For the subsequent DH of propane, it is easier to abstract the 2o-H than the 1o-H, which is consistent with the relative strength of their bond energies. This step is considered as the rate-determining step, and the calculated activation energy in the BP-H system is lower than that in the model BP-L system by 3.0 kcal/mol. This suggests that higher presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of BP improves its catalytic activity in the ODH of propane.
The NBO and NCI analyses indicate that the B–O• site of BP-H is more electron-rich compared to that of BP-L, and the higher coverage hydroxyl groups on the surface could enhance the electrophilicity of the BP surface by regulating the charge of the oxygen, boron, and phosphorus atoms, resulting in improved catalytic activity of the surface. FMO analysis shows that the frontier orbitals are mainly constituted by the oxidized boron layer, and the active oxidized boron layer in the BP-H may lower the activation barrier by narrowing down the energy band gap. Therefore, it is expected that the preparation of BP material with higher coverage of hydroxyl groups on the boron layer exhibits better activity and could be used as a unique and hitherto manipulatable candidate for the ODHP reaction. The analysis of the influence of the second type of element other than B in the boron-containing materials, that is, the O in B2O3, the N in h-BN, and the P in BP materials, in terms of TDOS and PDOS analysis shows that these elements introduce significant impact on the composition of the occupied states of the materials. This discovery provides new mechanistic insights into the mechanism of the ODHP reaction catalyzed by B-containing materials and benefits the design and understanding of novel catalytic systems with improved activity in the alkane ODH reactions.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
