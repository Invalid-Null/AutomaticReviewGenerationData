The document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. It focuses on the esterification of biomass-derived levulinic acid using molybdate-intercalated hydrotalcite catalysts. While it examines the catalytic performance of these materials, it does not mention their use for propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation to produce propylene.
