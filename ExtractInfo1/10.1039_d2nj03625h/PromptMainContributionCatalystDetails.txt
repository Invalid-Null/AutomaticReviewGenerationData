Esterification of biomass-derived levulinic acid using molybdate-intercalated hydrotalcite materials†
In this paper, we report the synthesis methodology of a series of molybdate-intercalated hydrotalcite-like materials and their catalytic applications for the esterification of biomass-derived levulinic acid. A simple hydrothermal method was used to synthesize molybdate-intercalated MgFe, MgAl, and MgCr hydrotalcites in the presence of an ammonia solution as a hydrolyzing agent. The intercalation of molybdate was confirmed via X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies based on line broadening in the XRD pattern and peaks characteristic of a layered hydrotalcite structure with short-range ordering were observed. The introduction of the molybdate species resulted in strong Lewis-acidic sites, as evident from FT-IR pyridine desorption and temperature-programmed desorption studies. The resulting material exhibited a significant activity for the esterification of the biomass-derived levulinic acid. The reaction conditions were systematically optimized. The molybdate-intercalated magnesium iron hydrotalcite exhibited 93% conversion of levulinic acid to butyl levulinate (120 °C, 4 h) with 95% selectivity. Good recyclability of the catalysts was demonstrated using recyclability studies, in which the catalysts showed excellent stability and high conversion even after five cycles.
1. Introduction
Due to increasing energy consumption and environmental concerns, the conversion of inedible biomass to chemicals, fuels, and energy has attracted significant attention in recent years.1,2 Lignocellulosic biomass (LB) is selected, from the available food-based biomass compounds, for biofuel production to ensure food security. Levulinic acid is an important platform molecule derived from LB that can be economically synthesized in large quantities through the acid hydrolysis of cellulose.3
Among biomass model compounds, levulinic acid has gained importance in the last three decades and is regarded as a link between biomass and petroleum processing.4 The derivatives of levulinic acid have been used to produce resins, biofuels, and pharmaceutical agents. The alkyl levulinates derived from the esterification of levulinic acid with various alcohols are utilized in the flavoring and fragrance industries and as additives in biofuels and gasoline.5 The esters of levulinic acid can be obtained directly from alcohols, typically using acid catalysts. Thermal esterification reactions can also occur without a catalyst, particularly with slow reaction rates at high temperatures, and mostly result in low yields.6,7 Conventionally, mineral acids, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and phosphoric acid are employed for the esterification of levulinic acids. However, heterogeneous catalysts are preferred over mineral-based homogeneous catalysts owing to their ease of recovery and reuse. The corrosive behavior of mineral-acid catalysts is an additional drawback, in contrast to the case of solid catalysts. In recent years, sulfated metal oxides, polyoxometallates, and zeolites have been explored for levulinic acid esterification.5,8 Heterogeneous catalysts with strong acidic sites coupled with large surface areas can replace mineral acid catalysts in levulinic acid esterification reactions.9 Contrary to the esterification of organic acids, for which several catalysts have been investigated in synthetic chemistry, relatively limited research has been conducted on the esterification of levulinic acid. Different heteropolyacid catalysts are used in the esterification reactions owing to the strong Brønsted acidity.8,10 For the esterification of levulinic acid, zeolites, metal–organic–frameworks (MOFs), mesoporous molecular sieves, heteropolyacids, and ion-exchange-resin-based heterogeneous catalysts have been studied in the past few years.11–14 Hydrotalcite (HT) composite-based catalysts have also been studied for the preparation of ethyl levulinate. The industrial application of these catalysts is limited owing to the leaching of active sites, high cost, and low reactivity. Therefore, researchers have focused on developing more active, recyclable, stable and inexpensive catalysts for esterification. Potential alternatives include layered double hydroxide-derived materials with tunable acid-base and redox properties.

]·mH2O.15 Various interlayer anions such as halides, non-metal oxoanions, oxo and polyoxometallate anions, anionic complexes of transition metals, anionic polymers and organic anions facilitate the tuning of the textural and intrinsic properties of the materials.
Among the different oxoanion-intercalated HT materials, relatively little research has been conducted on the catalytic activity of molybdate-intercalated HT materials. Molybdate-intercalated HTs are predominantly utilized for epoxidation and oxidation reactions, including tertiary-butanethiol oxidation, styrene oxidation with air and propane dehydrogenation.16–20 Molybdenum exhibits variable oxidation states and coordination numbers and its species have distinct stereochemistry. Molybdenum complexes are also found as bi-nuclear and polynuclear compounds containing a variety of organic and inorganic ligands. The incorporation of molybdenum into HTs also facilitates the introduction of Lewis acidity and promotes the formation of multifunctional catalysts.21,22 The intercalation of various anions such as vanadate, arsenate and molybdate enhances the thermal stability of the HT as compared to that of the original carbonate-based HTs.23 Because of these aforementioned properties, molybdate anions have the potential for intercalation to develop catalysts with desirable multifunctional applications.
The nature of cationic species, interlayer anions, in this framework facilitates the modification of acid–base characteristics and structural stability of the materials. Thus, in the present work, efforts have been made to synthesize various molybdate-intercalated HT materials derived from Mg–Al, Mg–Fe, and Mg–Cr HTs. An in-depth study has also been conducted to investigate their significance in levulinic acid esterification under moderate reaction conditions.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Magnesium nitrate hexahydrate Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (Merck), ammonium heptamolybdatetetrahydrate (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (SRL), aluminium nitrate nonahydrate Al(NO3)3·9H2O (LOBA), chromium nitrate nonahydrate Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (SRL), ferric nitrate nonahydrate Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (LOBA), and ammonia solution 25% (SRL) were used as starting materials for synthesis. For the catalytic study, levulinic acid (98%, Aldrich), n-propanol (SRL), n-butanol (LOBA), n-pentanol (SRL) and iso-pentanol (SRL) were used.
2.2 Catalyst preparation
The molybdate-intercalated MgFe, MgAl and MgCr materials were prepared based on the procedure described in the earlier literature.17 Solution 1 was prepared by adding Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (45.54 mmol) and Fe(NO3)3·9H2O/Al(NO3)3·9H2O/Cr(NO3)3.9H2O (15 mmol) to deionized water (120 mL). Solution 2 was prepared by adding (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (4.54 mmol) and aqueous ammonia (NH3aq.10 mL) to deionized water (100 mL). Solution 1 was added to solution 2 dropwise at 60 °C under vigorous stirring with a final gel pH of 9.0. After precipitation was completed, the slurry was transferred to a stainless-steel autoclave and aged at 100 °C for 4 days. The precipitate was filtered and washed with deionized water until the pH of the filtrate reached 7, and subsequently the samples were dried at 80 °C overnight. For comparison, carbonate-intercalated MgFe, MgAl and MgCr hydrotalcite like materials were also prepared using the same procedure without a molybdenum source. The prepared catalysts are denoted as MgFe, MgAl, MgCr, MgFeMo, MgAlMo and MgCrMo, respectively.
2.3 Material characterization
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded using a miniFlex (300/600) (Rigaku, Japan) XRD instrument with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54059 Å). The scanning angle ranged from 3° to 80° at a step size of 0.05° and a scan speed of 0.5° min−1. The Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were obtained using an FT/IR-4700 (JASCO, Japan) spectrometer in the range of 400–4000 cm−1. The diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible (DRUV-Vis) spectra of the catalysts were recorded (200–800 nm) by using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer (UV2600 Shimadzu, Japan) and BaSO4 as a reference. The thermal decomposition of the samples was analyzed using a PerkinElmer STA 600 simultaneous thermal analyzer. Approximately 2–5 mg of the sample was placed in a silica crucible and heated at a rate of 10 °C min−1 in a nitrogen environment at temperatures ranging from 40 °C to 900 °C. Nitrogen adsorption measurements were performed on an automatic micropore physisorption analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2020, USA) after the samples were degassed at 200 °C for at least 8 h under a 10−3 Torr pressure before each run. Acidity measurements were performed using a TPD instrument (BELCATM, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Initially, the sample was heated in a quartz reactor at 400 °C for 30 min under a He flow. The adsorption of ammonia was carried out at 50 °C for 30 min. TPD analysis on ammonia was performed from 50 °C to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and a He flow of 30 mL/min. The nature of the acidic sites was followed by pyridine FT-IR spectral studies. About 100 mg of the sample (10% of catalyst with KBr) was made into a pellet and pre-activated at 250 °C for 6 h. For pyridine adsorption, the temperature of the sample cup was maintained at 100 °C for 1 h. After pyridine adsorption, the spectrum was collected using KBr as the background. Furthermore, the sample was degassed at a desired temperature and the spectrum collected.
2.4 Levulinic acid esterification
The esterification reaction was performed in a condenser-fitted round-bottom (RB) flask. Initially, levulinic acid (2 mmol) and alcohol (10 mmol) were added to the RB flask. To this, 0.05 g of pre-activated catalyst was added and then heated to the desired temperature for 5 h. The reaction conditions were optimized using MgFeMo as the catalyst and n-butanol as the alkylating agent and solvent. After the reaction, the products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) (Mayura Analytical 1100 series) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and an AB-5 capillary column (30 m (length) × 0.25 mm (inner diameter), 0.25 μm (film thickness)). Before the GC analysis, the reaction mixture was treated with dry MgSO4 to eliminate the water produced during the reaction. The GC program starts with an oven temperature of 140 °C; the temperature was gradually increased at 10 °C min−1 until an oven temperature of 250 °C was attained.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Catalyst characterization
Fig. 1 illustrates the FT-IR spectra of the catalysts derived from the molybdate-intercalated HTs. In this, a broad band around 3300 cm−1 was visible due to the stretching mode of the hydrogen-bonded –OH groups, which is a characteristic of the water molecules present in the interlayer and surface hydroxyl groups. An interlayer water deformation band was also observed at 1620 cm−1. The band at approximately 1360 cm−1 corresponds to CO32− species located in the interlayer space. In the case of molybdate-intercalated HT, a weak doublet band was observed around 1300–1450 cm−1, corresponding to the carbonate and nitrate anions present in the interlayer space along with the molybdate anions. The relative intensity of the band at 1360 cm−1 was significantly reduced in the molybdate-intercalated samples, indicating the replacement of carbonate species by the molybdate anions. The splitting of the carbonate vibrational bands suggests that the materials contain carbonate species and have a short range order.24,25 The presence of peaks at around 2345 cm−1 in the case of the MgCr and MgCrMo samples is due to the presence of atmospheric CO2 adsorbed on the basic sites of the materials.26,27 The vibrational band at 919 cm−1 is a characteristic of molybdenum oxo species, which exist as interlayer molybdate ions. The additional vibrational band observed at approximately 815 cm−1 was due to the asymmetric stretching mode of the tetrahedral molybdate anion.28 The remaining molybdate vibrational bands at 1000 cm−1 overlapped with the framework HT vibrartions.18 The pyridine adsorbed IR spectra are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The broad vibrational bands around 1441–1454 cm−1 are characteristic of pyridine coordinated to Lewis acid sites. Both the molybdate-intercalated and molybdate-free samples showed the bands appearing at 1441 and 1493 cm−1 in the pyridine IR spectra, which are characteristic of the Lewis acidic and combination of Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites, respectively.29–31 However, no vibrational band around 1540 cm−1 in the pyridine IR spectrum supports the absence of Brønsted acidic sites. Thus the catalyst developed in the present studies has an exclusively Lewis acidic nature, which arises from framework M–O moieties.29–31

The XRD patterns of the molybdate-intercalated samples are displayed in Fig. 2 and demonstrate broad peaks as compared to the parent MgAl-HT, owing to the short-range ordering of the material upon hard molybdate anion intercalation.32 All the samples, however, exhibited a diffraction pattern characteristic of the layered HT structure. The presence of molybdate anions in the interlayer region facilitates pillaring, thereby increasing the interlayer distances33 and stabilizing the phase. After molybdate intercalation, the powder XRD profiles became broader in the case of MgFeMo. The 2θ value corresponds to the (003) planes of MgAl and MgCr-HT, which appeared at 11.1° and 11.5° and shifted to 9.6° and 8.5° for the MgAlMo and MgCrMo samples, respectively, further confirming the presence of molybdate species in the interlayer space as a pillaring agent.34 The XRD reflections located around 2θ values of 22.0°, 34.4°, and 60.8° could be attributed to the diffractions of the (006), (012), and (110) planes in the HT structure, respectively.35 The broadening of the peaks confirmed the intercalation of molybdate anions in the interlayer. The additional reflection present in the MgAlMo samples could correspond to the presence of aluminium-oxy-hydroxide phase analogues of pseudoboehmite.36–38

The coordination and oxidation states of the molybdate species were analyzed using DRUV-visible spectroscopy and the results are presented in Fig. 3. The MgFeMo material showed two distinct adsorption bands at around 220 nm and 305 nm, which can be attributed to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer bands of trivalent iron species present in the octahedral coordination of the layered HT framework. The introduction of molybdate ions into the interlayer of MgFe results in the broadening of the peak between 210 nm and 285 nm. This is characteristic of the charge transfer of O2− to the molybdate species, present in the isolated form in the interlayer space of HTs.17 The DRUV-Vis spectrum of MgAlMo clearly shows absorption bands in the region of 250 nm and 300 nm, characteristic of molybdenum species in tetrahedral and octahedral coordination, respectively.39 The 4F ground state of Cr(iii) ions (d3) splits in an octahedral field into three states whose energies are in the order 4A2g (ground state) <4T2g <4T1g; in addition, state 4P for the free ion remains unsplit as 4T1g.40 Consequently, three bands are expected for Cr(iii) ions in an octahedral environment, which is observed in the MgCrMo samples. The three bands observed at 207 nm, 407 nm, and 571 nm confirm the presence of chromium ions in the octahedral framework.

The results from the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the molybdate-intercalated and molybdenum-free hydrotalcite materials are shown in Fig. 4. Among all the molybdate-intercalated samples, a significant loss in weight was observed in MgCrMo as compared to MgAlMo and MgFeMo due to its strong acid–base properties, which facilitate higher adsorption of CO2 in the interlayer space. In the case of molybdate-intercalated MgCr-HT, two major stages of weight loss were observed. The initial weight loss observed in the temperature range of 30–200 °C corresponds to the water molecules present in the layer and interlayer space. The second weight loss observed in the range of 300–500 °C was attributed to the dehydroxylation of the surface hydroxyl groups, coupled with decarbonation.40–43 The MgAlMo, MgFeMo, and MgCrMo samples exhibited corresponding weight losses of 21, 23, and 43% after thermal decomposition.44 In particular, the MgCrMo sample demonstrated a sharp weight loss in the range of 420–500 °C, owing to the elimination of the hydroxyl and carbonate groups. The dehydroxylation step of the MgAlMo sample was observed to have a broader peak as compared to MgCrMo. The presence of trivalent chromium in the framework makes the lamellaer of the LDH structure more homogenous, hence preventing early dehydroxylation at lower temperatures.45 The total weight losses observed during the dehydration, dehydroxylation and decarbonation process of the MgFe, MgAl and MgCr samples were 43, 33 and 40%, respectively. The TGA profiles of the molybdenum-intercalated samples show a delay in the dehydroxylation step and less weight loss, which clearly indicates the higher thermal stability compared to the molybdenum-free samples.46

The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of the MgFeMo, MgAlMo, and MgCrMo samples are shown in Fig. 5. MgFeMo exhibits a sharp uptake in the p/p0 range below 0.1, which is due to the generation of interlayer microporosity caused by the intercalation of the molybdate anions. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of MgFeMo, MgAlMo, and MgCrMo HT materials are listed in Table 1. The nitrogen sorption isotherm of the MgAlMo materials showed continuous adsorption with distinct H3-type hysteresis loops in the p/p0 range from 0.8 to 0.9. This is typical of layered HTs with inter-particle and inter-gallery mesoporous structures.47 Contrary to the iron samples, the chromium and aluminium samples showed distinct octahedral aluminium and chromium species present in the HT structure that further facilitate more condensed species. Moreover, this is in agreement with the XRD results illustrated previously. The crystallite sizes of the molybdate-intercalated MgFeMo, MgAlMo and MgCrMo materials were calculated using the Scherer equation (Table S1, ESI†) and the least crystallite size was observed for MgFeMo. The results support the observed highest surface area of MgFeMo.48

The surface acidity of all the samples was further characterized using the NH3 TPD analysis. The total acidity values of the MgFe, MgAl, MgCr, MgFeMo, MgAlMo, and MgCrMo samples are listed in Table 1, with their corresponding TPD profiles shown in Fig. 6. All the catalyst materials exhibited strong acidity between 450 and 600 °C. The MgFeMo and MgAlMo samples exhibited a similar amount of acidic sites (0.007 and 0.008 mmol g−1, respectively), in high-temperature regions. However, a notable increase in acidity was observed for the MgCrMo catalyst (0.050 mmol g−1). The molybdate-intercalated sample showed an increase in the amount of acidic sites in the low-temperature region. The peak that appeared at low-temperature can be ascribed to the physisorbed ammonia in weakly acidic sites.

3.2 Catalytic studies on molybdate-intercalated HT for levulinic acid esterification
Liquid-phase levulinic acid esterification was further investigated using well-characterized catalysts. A schematic illustration of the levulinic acid esterification is presented in Scheme 1.
Scheme 1 Pictorial representation of levulinic acid esterification.
Initially, the catalytic activities of different catalysts were investigated for the synthesis of alkyl levulinates. The activities of a series of catalysts such as MgFe, MgAl, MgCr, MgFeMo, MgAlMo, and MgCrMo for the esterification of levulinic acid in the presence of various alcohols such as n-propanol, n-butanol, n-pentanol, and iso-pentanol are summarized in Fig. 7. The use of n-butanol, n-pentanol, and iso-pentanol with MgFeMo and MgAlMo showed more than 80% conversion. On the contrary, propanol only showed a conversion of up to 50%, which may be attributed to the differences in their dielectric constants. The reaction was performed at the reflux temperature of each of the alcohols for 5 h. The reaction proceeds through the formation of an intermediate α-angelica lactone.49,50 Among the various catalysts studied, molybdate-intercalated MgFeMo showed the highest conversion (88% conversion and 96% selectivity to butyllevulinate). MgAlMo also showed a similar conversion (80%) as that of MgFeMo. In the case of molybdenum-free catalysts (MgFe, MgAl, and MgCr), the conversion was significantly lower than in the molybdate-intercalated catalysts. This enhanced activity of the molybdate-intercalated MgFeMo, MgAlMo, and MgCrMo HTs as compared to that of the molybdate-free MgFe, MgAl, and MgCr can be attributed to the increased acidity of the Mo-containing samples.19 The introduction of the molybdate ions facilitated the improvement in levulinic acid esterification activity. The molybdate species act as the active site for the reaction. As mentioned previously, amongst all the molybdate-intercalated catalysts, MgFeMo showed the highest conversion and the best overall catalytic activity due to its strong acidity, microporosity, and larger surface area, as evident from the N2 sorption. Among the molybdate-intercalated samples, the MgCrMo catalyst exhibited less conversion. The introduction of molybdate into the MgCr-HT facilitates the strong Cr–Mo interaction, leads to the condensed species, and shows less surface area. In addition, a comparison of the CO2 TPD measurements (Fig. S2, ESI†) of the molybdate-intercalated samples shows the higher basic strength of the MgCrMo-HT. The lower activity on MgCrMo can be explained based on the presence of strong basicity and water formed during the reaction favors the reversible reaction, i.e., base-catalyzed ester hydrolysis leads to the formation of the corresponding alcohol and carboxylic acid. Thus the poor surface area, along with the increase in surface basicity of the MgCrMo, leads to a decreased yield.51 The reactions were also carried out in the absence of a catalyst and the conversion obtained was found to be less than 30%. The results are represented in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Furthermore, to study the metal leaching from the heterogeneous catalyst, the catalyst was first heated in the presence of alcohol at 120 °C for 4 h. Subsequently, the catalyst was filtered, and the reaction was carried out using a filtrate solution. The filtrate solution gave a conversion level similar to the result of the blank reaction. So the reaction proceeds as truly heterogeneous in nature.

Following this, the influence of levulinic acid on the n-butanol molar ratio was studied using the MgFeMo catalyst and the results are shown in Fig. 8. When the molar ratio of n-butanol to levulinic acid was 1 : 1, the conversion percentage was limited to only 15% with the formation of butyl levulinate as the major product. On increasing the molar concentration of the alcohol to 5 : 1 (n-butanol : levulinic acid), the conversion percentage increased to approximately 88% with the formation of butyl levulinate. With a further increase in the molar concentration of n-butanol, there was no significant change in the conversion. Therefore, a molar ratio of 5 : 1 (n-butanol : levulinic acid) was chosen for further experiments.

MgFeMo samples with different Mo loadings were evaluated for levulinic acid esterification using n-butanol, and the results are presented in Fig. 9. The use of molybdate-free MgFe HT resulted in a levulinic acid conversion of only 49% with a 71% selectivity towards butyl levulinate. As the molybdate loading of MgFeMo was increased, a steady increase in the percentage of levulinic acid conversion was observed. This can be attributed to the presence of surface-exposed molybdate species with Lewis acidity and the synergistic effects of Mg and Fe. When the 0.1 MgFeMo catalyst was used, the maximum levulinic acid conversion was observed to be 88%, with 96% selectivity towards butyl levulinate. With a further increase in the molybdate loading (MgFeMo–0.15), no appreciable change in the conversion percentage was observed. Moreover, the use of higher molybdate loading may affect the acid–base properties of the material,52 which may lead to a slightly decreased conversion.

Fig. 10 depicts the influence of the reaction time on the MgFeMo-catalyzed esterification of levulinic acid in the presence of n-butanol. The reactions were studied at different time intervals, and the data show a gradual increase in conversion from 1 to 4 h. A maximum levulinic acid conversion of 93% was obtained at 4 h with the formation of butyl levulinate. However, an additional increase in the reaction time slightly decreased the conversion percentage, which could be due to the formation of water as a by-product of the reaction. The water produced could be adsorbed on the active sites, enhancing the reverse reaction and decreasing the activity as the duration of the reaction increased.

Catalyst recycling experiments were also performed to investigate the reusability of the catalysts presented in this work. The reusability of MgAlMo and MgFeMo was evaluated by recovering the catalysts after the reaction, followed by washing and drying in an air oven. After each cycle, the catalyst was recovered by centrifugation, washing with ethanol, and drying in an oven at 80 °C. This post-processed catalyst was used in the subsequent cycle. As shown in Fig. 11B, MgAlMo exhibited good catalytic stability, maintaining a similar level of reactivity for up to five catalytic cycles. The structural stability and acidic properties of the used catalyst were followed with the help of the powder XRD and NH3 TPD studies and the results are represented in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The structure of the used catalyst is analogous to that of the fresh catalyst, which is evident from the XRD pattern. A slight enhancement in acidic site strength was observed in the used catalyst. This can be due to the re-dispersion of molybdate species in the interlayer space and slightly enhanced acidic sites and strength.

A recyclability study using MgFeMo showed a slight decrease in activity (Fig. 11A) across successive cycles, which could be due to the deposition of organic reaction products on the surface of the catalyst. Nevertheless, the conversion remained above 70% even after five recycling studies, which is still higher than that of a few pristine catalysts studied in this work. The MgMo catalyst also exhibited conversion (80%) similar to the MgAlMo HT material, which shows the importance of molybdenum in the esterification reaction. But the MgMo material does not exhibit reusability. Thus, MgAlMo and MgFeMo demonstrated good recyclability and served as high-performance active recyclable catalysts for the production of levulinate esters.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a series of molybdate-intercalated HT-like materials were effectively synthesized by a co-precipitation method followed by hydrothermal treatment. They exhibited good catalytic activity for the esterification of biomass-derived levulinic acid. XRD was used to verify the intercalation of the molybdate anions. DRUV-visible spectral analysis indicated the presence of molybdenum in octahedral and tetrahedral geometries. The TGA analysis revealed two major stages of weight loss. The TPD ammonia analysis demonstrated strong acidity in the presented catalysts. The esterification of levulinic acid was systematically studied by varying reaction parameters such as temperature, reaction time, and molar ratio to obtain optimum conditions. The results showed that under optimum reaction conditions, like a reaction temperature of 120 °C, a 5 : 1 molar ratio of n-butanol to LA, and a reaction time of 4 h, a maximum levulinic acid conversion percentage of 93% was observed. With n-pentanol and iso-pentanol, the conversion of levulinic acid was greater than 85%, indicating that the produced catalysts for the esterification process performed well. Finally, both the MgAlMo and MgFeMo catalysts were subjected to recycling experiments where both the catalysts exhibited good stability and high conversion rates even after five cycles, thus confirming their suitability as high performance, recyclable catalysts for the production of levulinate esters.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
