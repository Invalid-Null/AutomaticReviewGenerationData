The given document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically. It focuses on novel catalytic processes to convert surplus aromatic hydrocarbons from pyrolysis gasoline into synthetic steamcracker feedstocks consisting of C2+-n-alkanes like ethane, propane and n-butane. While propane can be produced through these catalytic conversion processes, the document does not examine PDH or ODH of propane to propylene.
