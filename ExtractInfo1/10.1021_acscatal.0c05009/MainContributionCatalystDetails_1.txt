The document discusses the structure and surface properties of various Ga2O3-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). It does not focus on a specific catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution. The document mainly provides insights into how the coordination geometry, acidity, and distribution of surface sites influence catalytic performance in PDH.
