 Based on the details provided in the document, this does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses catalysts for converting methane to higher hydrocarbons, not specifically propane dehydrogenation. Therefore, I have indicated "no" for relevance and not included the requested extraction details.
