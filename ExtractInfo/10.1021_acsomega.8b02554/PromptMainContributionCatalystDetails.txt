Computational Study of Methane Activation on γ-Al2O3
Abstract
The C–H activation of methane remains a longstanding challenge in the chemical industry. Metal oxides are attractive catalysts for the C–H activation of methane due to their surface Lewis acid–base properties. In this work, we applied density functional theory calculations to investigate the C–H activation mechanism of methane on various sites of low-index facets of γ-Al2O3. The feasibility of C–H activation on different metal–oxygen (acid–base) site pairs was assessed through two potential mechanisms, namely, the radical and polar. The effect of surface hydroxylation on C–H activation was also investigated to examine the activity of γ-Al2O3 under realistic catalytic surface conditions (hydration). On the basis of our calculations, it was demonstrated that the C–H activation barriers for polar pathways are significantly lower than those of the radical pathways on γ-Al2O3. We showed that the electronic structure (s- and p-band center) for unoccupied and occupied bands can be used to probe site-dependent Lewis acidity and basicity and the associated catalytic behavior. We identified the dissociated H2 binding and final state energy as C–H activation energy descriptors for the preferred polar pathway. Finally, we developed structure–activity relationships for the C–H activation of methane on γ-Al2O3 that account for surface Lewis acid–base properties and can be utilized to accelerate the discovery of catalysts for methane (and shale gas) upgrade.

The recent development of hydraulic fracking technology and increasing shale gas reserves make natural gas an attractive feedstock for the synthesis of high-value chemicals. (1−3) Direct combustion of methane cannot utilize its full potential in the chemical industry. (4) Owing to the low volumetric density of methane, its transportation from rural-area shale reserves is expensive and challenging. Therefore, there is significant demand to convert methane to high-value and high-density chemicals. Currently, the transformation of methane in industry is achieved via an indirect process of its conversion to syn-gas (CO + H2) at elevated temperatures (>970 K). (5,6) However, this process is energetically demanding and cost-ineffective. Due to the high C–H bond strength of methane, an industrially viable process for the efficient and selective conversion of methane to higher value chemicals has yet to be realized. Interestingly, the conversion of methane (e.g., to methanol) is thermodynamically viable but kinetically challenging. (1,7) Efficient and selective catalysts are required to overcome this kinetic difficulty. Metal oxides are known to catalyze reactions involving C–H activation (8,9) because of their surface Lewis acid (metal) and base (oxygen) sites. (8−15) Toward activating the C–H bond of methane, various metal oxides have been widely explored using experimental (8,9) and computational (9,16−24) methods. Interestingly, preheated γ-Al2O3 (at high temperature, >400 °C) is one of the most active catalysts for C–H activation of methane. (25−27) Preheated γ-Al2O3 catalyzes the hydrogen–deuterium exchange reaction of the mixture of D2/CH4 and CH4/CD4 at room temperature with very low activation barriers. (25−27) It has been demonstrated that the thermal pretreatment of γ-Al2O3 generates high-energy surfaces, which are primarily responsible for the activity of γ-Al2O3 toward hydrogen–deuterium exchange. (28,29) Recently, it was shown that preheated γ-Al2O3 (at 500 °C) shows exceptional activity for alkane C–H activation and dehydrogenation. (30) It is believed that the high-temperature pretreatment exposes under-coordinated surface acid–base site pairs. (30−33) Valla et al. have demonstrated that the tricoordinated Al sites are generated by high-temperature pretreatment of γ-Al2O3. (34) Sautet and co-workers computationally studied the C–H activation of methane and propane on γ-Al2O3 (110) on several catalytic sites (e.g AlIII–OII and AlIII–OIII) through the polar pathway. (31,32,35,36) The authors also investigated the effect of surface hydration on methane activation on these sites. C–H activation of methane can potentially occur through the polar (16−18) or radical mechanism. (22,37−39) In the polar mechanism, a C–H bond of methane breaks heterolytically to form surface-bound hydroxyl and methyl-aluminum species. The radical mechanism evolves through the homolytic C–H bond cleavage with the formation of radical intermediates. In this mechanism, the hydrogen radical reacts with surface oxygen to form surface hydroxyl and releases the methyl radical in the gas phase. It has been suggested that the radical pathway is usually favored in oxidative C–H activation through oxygen-centered radicals or on doped metal oxides. (39,40) However, the feasibility of radical pathway has not been assessed on γ-Al2O3 yet.
Due to the high surface heterogeneity of oxides (existence of various sites with variable Lewis acidity and basicity), the identification of structure–activity relationships (relationships between the catalyst properties and reaction activity) is highly desirable. These relationships offer a rational understanding of catalytic activity and a predictive tool for discovering and designing active catalysts. (41−43) Toward the identification of structure–activity relationships, Latimer et al. recently established the adsorption energy of atomic hydrogen as universal oxidative C–H activation descriptor through the radical pathway. (19) Recently, Jiang et al. investigated C–H activation of methane on oxygen atoms, which were preadsorbed on Co3O4 and identified the Adjusted Coordination Number (based on generalized coordination number and Bader charges) as a descriptor for the C–H activation barrier. (23) Janik and co-workers revealed a correlation between the C–H bond activation energy and the surface reducibility. (21) As a result, significant research has been focused on oxidative C–H activation of methane on single (oxygen) site over the last few decades, but the nonoxidative C–H activation of methane on oxides (on acid–base pair sites) remains underexplored. In addition, there is no systematic approach to screen oxide catalysts toward a catalytic reaction. The key hurdle, which possibly hinders the development of structure–activity relationships for nonoxidative C–H activation, is the existence of a large number of inequivalent sites with variable Lewis acidity/basicity (high surface heterogeneity) on the oxides. (44) In the nonoxidative C–H activation, both Lewis acid and base sites are involved in the reaction at the same time, and probing these properties on oxide surfaces with variable coordination environments (affecting Lewis acidity and basicity) becomes significantly complex. (45) In our recent work, we developed structure–activity relationships for propane dehydrogenation on γ-Al2O3 that unraveled the dependence of the propane dehydrogenation activity on the strength of surface acid–base site pairs. Moreover, we observed a site-dependent catalytic behavior of γ-Al2O3 and revealed a volcano relationship between activity and dissociated H2 binding energy (BE) on the respective site pairs. (46)
In this work, we focus on methane activation on γ-Al2O3 because of its high degree of surface heterogeneity (45,47,48) and high catalytic activity. These properties make γ-Al2O3 an excellent candidate to identify structure–activity relationships for nonoxidative C–H activation. Specifically, we applied first-principles calculations to identify the preferred mechanism of C–H activation on different low-index surface facets of γ-Al2O3, by also accounting surface hydration. Our work revealed structure–activity relationships for C–H activation of methane, which can be used for screening different metal oxides and aid in accelerated catalyst discovery.

To examine the influence of Lewis acidity and basicity on the C–H activation barriers, we investigated the polar mechanisms on three low-index surface facets of γ-Al2O3: (100), (110), and (111), as shown in Figure 2. (47,48) These surface facets of γ-Al2O3 were optimized, and it was noticed that Al atoms display pentacoordination (AlV) on (100) facet, tetra- (AlIV) and tricoordinations (AlIII) on (110) facet, and tricoordination (AlIII) on (111) facet. Oxygen atoms were found to display tricoordination (OIII) on γ-Al2O3 (100) facet, di- (OII) and tricoordinations (OIII) on (110) facet, and tri- (OIII) and tetracoordinations (OIV) on (111) facet. (47,48) We choose different distinctive acid–base site pairs (based on the coordination numbers) on each surface facet (Figure 2). Specifically, the selected site pairs are: on γ-Al2O3 (100) facet, AlVa–OIIIa, AlVb–OIIIa, AlVb–OIIIb, AlVa–OIIIc, on γ-Al2O3 (110) facet, AlIII–OII, AlIII–OIII, AlIVa–OII, AlIVa–OIII and AlIVb–OII, and on γ-Al2O3 (111) facet, AlIIIa–OIVa, AlIIIa–OIVb, AlIIIb–OIIIa and AlIIIb–OIIIb.

The electronic structure of the catalyst plays an important role on the overall catalytic activity. (49,50) To understand the Lewis acidity and basicity of different sites of γ-Al2O3, we investigated the projected density of states of the (100), (110), and (111) facets of γ-Al2O3. For molecular systems, the locations of the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, are related with the Lewis acidity (electrophilicity) and basicity (nucleophilicity) of these systems, as these orbitals are involved in electron loss and gain processes, respectively. (51) By analogy, for periodic surfaces, the Lewis acidity and basicity can be probed by identifying the location of the centers of unoccupied and occupied bands, respectively. Toward assessing the Lewis acidity and basicity of different site pairs, we calculated the projected density of states Al(s) and O(p) orbitals of γ-Al2O3 (100), (110), and (111) facets (Figure 3). It is clear from Figure 3 that low-lying unoccupied bands of aluminum atoms are Al(s) bands, and high-lying occupied bands of oxygen atoms are O(p) bands. Therefore, we computed the unoccupied s-band center (εsAl) for Al atoms and occupied p-band center (εpO) of O atoms. On the (100) facet, based on the unoccupied s-band center the Lewis acidity of aluminum atoms follows the trend (lower εs = more acidic): AlVa (εs = 6.19) > AlVb (εs = 6.6) > AlVc (εs = 7.71). This trend is in agreement with previous calculations by Jenness et al. (52) The calculated occupied p-band center suggests that the Lewis basicity of oxygen atoms on the (100) facet follows the trend: OIIIa (εp = −3.78) ≈ OIIIc (εp = −3.89) > OIIIb (εp = −4.13). On the (110) facet, the strongest Lewis acid site is AlIII (εs = 5.81) followed by AlIVb (εs = 5.87) site, and the weakest Lewis acid site is AlIVa (εs = 6.11). The basicity of oxygen atoms bound with AlIVa follows the order of OII (εp = −2.87) > OIII (εp = −3.53). On the (111) facet, the strongest Lewis acid site is AlIIIa (εs = 4.03) followed by AlIIIb (εs = 6.09).

Locations of s- and p-band centers are shown with vertical lines. The calculated values of s- and p-band centers are given in Table S1. Fermi level was shifted to zero.
After assessing the site-dependent Lewis acidity and basicity, we turn our attention to the C–H activation mechanisms of methane. In general, there are two potential surface mechanisms that exist for C–H activation of methane on oxide catalysts, the polar and radical pathways. (16−18,37) The former mechanism is characterized by polar (heterolytic) dissociation of C–H bond of methane, whereas the latter is characterized by homolytic dissociation of the C–H bond of methane. The polar mechanism (Figure 4, top panel) involves the C–H bond breaking of methane in heterolytic fashion on the surface to yield CH3–* and surface-adsorbed H+*. In the radical mechanism (Figure 4, bottom panel), the C–H bond breaks by the abstraction of a hydrogen radical by a surface oxygen atom while leaving a methyl radical in the gas phase. To investigate the effects of Lewis acidity and basicity on C–H activation of methane, we examined both mechanisms on two stable facets ((100) and (110)) of γ-Al2O3. Additionally, the polar mechanism was also investigated on the (111) facet of Al2O3. Figure 4 illustrates the relevant stationary points in both pathways, radical and polar on the AlVa–OIIIa site pair.

Initially, we investigated the polar mechanism on the four acid–base site pairs (AlVa–OIIIa, AlVb–OIIIb, AlVa–OIIIc, and AlVb–OIIIa) of (100) facet (Figure 2a), the five site pairs (AlIII–OII, AlIVa–OII, AlIVa–OIII, AlIVb–OII, and AlIII–OIII) of the (110) facet (Figure 2b), and the four site pairs (AlIIIa–OIVa, AlIIIa–OIVb, AlIIIb–OIIIa, and AlIIIb–OIIIb) of the (111) facet (Figure 2c). We noticed that adsorption of methane is weakly exothermic on the (100) and (110) facets, and it becomes stronger on the (111) facet due to low average surface coordination numbers of Al and oxygen atoms on this facet. For the polar mechanism on the (100) facet (Figure 5a), the lowest C–H activation barrier was obtained on the site pair with strongest Lewis acidity and basicity (AlVa–OIIIa, 94.5 kJ/mol) followed by the site pair involving the strongest acidic site (AlVa–OIIIc, 115 kJ/mol). The barriers on AlVb–OIIIb (174.2 kJ/mol) and AlVb–OIIIa (141.6) sites pairs are found relatively higher due to lower acidity/basicity of corresponding acid–base pairs. On the (110) facet (Figure 5b), low C–H activation barriers (84–91 kJ/mol) were obtained on the site pairs with strong Lewis acidity and basicity (AlIII–OII and AlIVb–OII). However, the C–H activation was highly exothermic on the AlIII–OII site pair, demonstrating the strong Lewis acidity and basicity of corresponding atoms of the site pairs. On this facet, the highest activation barrier was noted for site pair with high surface coordination numbers (AlIVa–OIII, 126.8 kJ/mol). On the (111) facet (Figure 5c), lowest C–H activation barriers (64.4 and 66.6 kJ/mol) were noted for the AlIIIa–OIVa and AlIIIa–OIVb site pairs. The activity behavior on these site pairs might appear counter intuitive (due to high coordination number of oxygen), however, due to the involvement of strongest Lewis acidic (εs = 4.03) site, these site pairs display low C–H activation barriers.

Figure 5. Methane C–H activation energy profiles on γ-Al2O3 (a) (100), (b) (110), and (c) (111) facets via the polar pathway. The respective site pairs are shown in Figure 2.
Next, we investigated the radical mechanism on the two most stable facets of γ-Al2O3, the (100) and (110). The (111) facet was not considered for the radical pathway as this (nonhydrated) facet is higher in energy, and it has been experimentally demonstrated that the (111) facet is present in low content on γ-Al2O3 particles. (53,54) Specifically, we investigated the radical mechanism on two oxygen sites (OIIIa and OIIIb) of (100) facet and three oxygen sites OIIa (OII site of AlIII–OII site pair), OIIIa (OIII site of AlIVa–OIII site pair), OIIb (OII site of AlIVb–OII site pair) on the (110) facet.
To investigate the radical pathways, we started with closed shell (singlet) calculations on (100) facet. All attempts to find the transition state with singlet calculations failed. In these calculations, the guess geometry for the final state converges to the initial states. Furthermore, the potential energy scan along the C–H bond coordinate also indicated a highly endothermic (uphill) path (Figure S2). Subsequently, we investigated the radical pathway with triplet states and successfully identified potential transition states. However, the triplet reactant states for adsorbed methane were found to be significantly higher in energy compared to corresponding singlet states (Figure 6). The C–H activation barriers for radical pathway were found to be highly endothermic for both the (100) and (110) facets investigated in this work. We note that the C–H barriers via radical pathways on the (110) facet are lower than that of the (100) facet.

The OIIa site corresponds to the OII site of the AlIII–OII site pair, the OIIb site corresponds to the OII site of the AlIVb–OII site pair, and the OIIIa site on 110 facet corresponds to the OIII site of the AlIVa–OIII site pair. The respective sites are shown in Figure 2.
As already discussed, we observed significantly dissimilar C–H activation barriers on site pairs with different Lewis acidities and basicities (surface coordination) on the various surface facets of γ-Al2O3. To further probe the Lewis acidity and basicity, we calculated the binding energies of dissociated H2 (BE-H2) on all of the different site pairs of (100), (110), and (111) facets. The choice of BE-H2 as a Lewis acidity/basicity descriptor is based on the fact that the adsorptions of hydride and proton (on the corresponding metal and oxygen sites) resulting from the dissociated hydrogen (H2 → H+ + H–) act as an effective probe for both electron-rich (oxygen) and electron-deficient (aluminum) atoms. Additionally, in our recent work, we identified the binding energy of dissociated H2 as an activity descriptor for nonoxidative propane dehydrogenation on γ-Al2O3. (55) By plotting the BE-H2 against the respective activation barriers for the most preferred, i.e., polar mechanism (Figure 7a), we verify that it is a good descriptor of methane C–H activation energy. In addition, a well-known descriptor for C–H activation is the final state energy, EFS (20,56,57) (difference in energy between the physisorbed and final (activated) states of methane on the catalyst surface). This descriptor is based on BEP-type relationships (58−60) (due to the late transition state of C–H activation). We plotted the final state energy vs the activation energy of C–H activation of methane through the polar pathway, and we noted a good correlation as well (Figure 7b). Taken together, these suggest that the binding energy of hydrogen and the final state energy can be used as interchangeable descriptors for the C–H activation of methane. The identified descriptors (Figure 7) relate the catalyst activity with reactant–catalyst physicochemical properties and thus can be used for the construction of structure–activity relationships. Interestingly, by plotting the dissociated H2 binding energies on different site pairs of (100) and (111) facets vs the difference between occupied s-band center of Al and occupied p-band center of O, we revealed a good correlation (Figure S3). This finding demonstrates a quantitative relationship between band centers and Lewis acidity and basicity.

Methane C–H activation barriers on γ-Al2O3 for polar mechanism vs (a) dissociated H2 binding energies and (b) final state energy with respect to adsorbed state of methane, on the corresponding acid–base sites. Orange points represent sites on (100), gray on (110), and red on (111) facets of γ-Al2O3.
Under realistic experimental conditions, the Lewis acid surface sites (under-coordinated Al sites) of γ-Al2O3 are partially occupied by hydroxyl groups, and some of the Lewis basic surface sites (oxygen atoms) are protonated due to surface hydration. Computational work established that the fully nonhydroxylated (100) facet is more stable than that of nonhydroxylated (110) facet, (50,58) and the presence of hydroxyl groups significantly stabilizes the (110) facet, making it the most abundant facet. (47,48,61) As a result, to assess the activity of γ-Al2O3 under realistic experimental conditions, we investigated the effect of hydroxylation of γ-Al2O3 (110) (most abundant facet) on methane activation. Previous studies by Digne and co-workers (47,48) demonstrated that the (110) facet of γ-Al2O3 has a hydroxyl coverage of ∼5.9 OH/nm–2 at temperatures 700–950 K (within typical nonoxidative alkane dehydrogenation conditions). Therefore, we consider eight hydroxylated configurations of γ-Al2O3 (110) facet with a hydroxyl coverage of ∼5.9 OH/nm–2 (i.e four H2O molecules per supercell). In the considered configurations, different surface sites were hydroxylated, and different surface oxygen atoms were protonated. We note that in the most stable hydroxylated configuration, the strongest Lewis acid sites (AlIII and AlIVb) are now blocked by hydroxyl groups (Figure S4a), suggesting that these sites become inactive for methane activation.
In addition, it has been suggested that high-temperature pretreatment of γ-Al2O3 (activation) can expose defect AlIII sites that belong to metastable hydrated surfaces. (31,32) Sautet and co-workers extensively studied the surface hydration of γ-Al2O3 and identified two types of metastable surface hydration models that expose a free AlIII site, namely, Digne’s model (nonreconstructed) and Wischert model (reconstructed). (31,32) Therefore, we considered two metastable structures with a free AlIII site (strong Lewis acid) for studying the CH4 activation. Out of the two lowest energy metastable structures, the nonreconstructed structure, which is generated by the hydroxylation of one AlIVa and AlIII site (Digne’s model, (47)Figure S4b) and the protonation of OII sites (Figure S4b) was found to be 76 kJ/mol higher in energy than the most stable structure. This surface configuration does not show any reconstruction. Interestingly, we note that on the AlIII–OIII site pair, depending on the orientation of methane in the transition state, two distinct modes of C–H activation exist (Figure S5) because the nonadjacent acid–base sites involved in this pair are separated by a large distance. These two C–H activation modes are identified on the AlIII–OIII site pair of both hydrated and nonhydrated surfaces. We note that the low-energy C–H activation mode (Figure S5) has a transition state with methane in a tetrahedral-like orientation (Figure S5a–c), whereas in the high-energy mode methane has a distorted geometry (SN2-like transition state geometry, Figure S5d–f). The distorted structure increases the energy at the transition state (due to strain).
The C–H activation barriers of the low-energy mode are presented in Figure 8. Reaction profiles for high-energy transition state modes are presented in Figure S6. On the AlIII–OII (adjacent) site pair of the nonreconstructed metastable hydroxylated configuration, the C–H activation barrier (109.2 kJ/mol, Figure 8a) was found to be higher than that of the C–H activation barrier on the AlIII–OII site pair of nonhydrated configuration (90.9 kJ/mol, Figure 8a). On the AlIII–OIII (nonadjacent) site pair of nonreconstructed metastable hydrated configuration, the C–H activation barrier (54.5.kJ/mol, Figure 8b) was found to be lower than that on AlIII–OIII site pair of the nonhydrated configuration (120.3 kJ/mol, Figure 8b). These results are in agreement with previous reports (31,32) where it was suggested that in the presence of bridging hydroxyl groups on AlIVa, the activity of the AlIII–OIII site pair increases due to the increase in the basicity of the O atom. The higher C–H activation barrier on the AlIII–OII of nonreconstructed hydrated surface can be attributed to the decrease in basicity of OII site due to hydrogen bond (in 1.53 Å distance) with the hydrogen atom bound to the OII site of the AlIVa–OII site pair. The other considered hydrated metastable model (Figure S4c) of γ-Al2O3 (110), generated by the hydroxylation of both AlIVa site and the protonation of less basic OIII site of AlIVb–OIII site pair (Figure S4c), reconstructed, in agreement with the with previous results by Wischert et al. (31,32) This reconstructed surface is lower in energy (by −47 kJ/mol) than of the nonreconstructed surface, but it was found to be higher in energy (by 29 kJ/mol) than the most stable hydrated surface. On the AlIII–OII (adjacent) site pair of the reconstructed hydrated surface, the C–H activation barrier (170.1 kJ/mol, Figure 8a) was found to be significantly higher than that of the C–H activation barrier on the AlIII–OII site pair of the nonhydrated surface (90.9 kJ/mol, Figure 8a). This increase in the barrier on the hydrated reconstructed facet is likely due to the change in coordination of OII from dicoordinated to tricoordinated and modification of AlIII acidity due to reconstruction. This change in Lewis acidity basicity of this site pair in the reconstructed metastable configuration is demonstrated by the higher final state energy of methane dissociation on this site pair (Figure 8a) when compared to that of the corresponding nonreconstructed metastable hydrated and nonhydrated site pairs. On the AlIII–OIII (nonadjacent) site pair of reconstructed hydrated configuration, the C–H activation barrier (83.9 kJ/mol, Figure 8b) was found to be lower than that of the C–H activation barrier on the AlIII–OIII site pair of nonhydrated configuration (120.3 kJ/mol, Figure 8b). The aforementioned results clearly demonstrate that the surface hydration can significantly influence the C–H activation barriers of methane by modifying the surface Lewis acidity and basicity. The low methane activation barrier (54.5 kJ/mol, Figure 8b) obtained on a nonadjacent site pair of metastable surface (generated through high-temperature pretreatment) rationalizes the experimentally observed high activity of thermally pretreated γ-Al2O3. (28−30) Moreover, previously demonstrated activity poisoning of thermally preheated alumina by water can be explained by blocking of the defect active sites (such as AlIII–OIII site on metastable surfaces) by strong water adsorption. (28,30) Finally, we note that the final state energy can also be used as a descriptor for methane activation barriers on hydroxylated metastable surfaces (Figure S7).

ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
We applied density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the C–H activation of methane on different sites of three low-index surface facets of γ-Al2O3. Two potential C–H activation mechanisms were considered on different sites of varying Lewis acidity and basicity, the polar and radical mechanism. It was found that the polar is the prevailing C–H activation mechanism on γ-Al2O3. We show that the site-dependent Lewis acidity and basicity can be probed by identifying the band centers for the unoccupied and occupied bands. Moreover, we address the effect of surface hydration on C–H activation of methane and show a modification of the Lewis acid/base properties and C–H activation behavior. Water generally blocks strong Lewis acid/base site pairs (catalytic suppression), but in some cases it can enhance activity of adjacent sites on metastable γ-Al2O3 surfaces. Importantly, we demonstrate that hydrogen dissociative binding energy and final state energy can be used as descriptors for the C–H activation on γ-Al2O3. These descriptors can be used in the construction of structure–activity relationships for C–H activation of methane and effectively probe the Lewis acid/base functionality of the metal oxide catalysts.

The DFT calculations were performed using the CP2K program package. (62) The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional (63) with Grimme’s D3 dispersion correction method (64) was used. TZVP basis sets were used for C, H, and O, and DZVP basis set was used for Al. Goedecker, Teter, and Hutter pseudopotentials were employed with a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 Ry. The minimum energy pathways for C–H activation were investigated using climbing image nudged elastic band calculations as implemented in CP2K. (65) The nonspinel model of alumina was used in our calculations. (47,48) To model the (110), (100), and (111) facets of γ-Al2O3, p2 × 1, p1 × 2 and p1 × 1 supercells were used (Figure S1), respectively. Supercells with 80 atoms were used for (100) and (111) surfaces, and 120-atom supercell was used for (110) facet. For the radical pathway, the supercells with 160 atoms were used for both (110) and (100) facets (to locate transition states with the correct localization of spin) with a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 Ry. The two bottom layers were kept frozen at their corresponding bulk positions, and remaining layers were allowed to relax. The systems were relaxed using the forces and SCF convergence criterion of 4.0 × 10–4Eh per bohr and 10–7 au, respectively. The binding energy (BE) of hydrogen atoms was computed, by dissociative hydrogen adsorption on Lewis acid and base sites of the oxide surface, according to eq 1

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
