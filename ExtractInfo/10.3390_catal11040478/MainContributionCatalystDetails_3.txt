The document discusses MgF2-modified hydrotalcite-derived composites supported Pt-In catalysts for isobutane direct dehydrogenation, which is not directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The document does not discuss conversion of propane to propylene through either PDH or ODH processes.
