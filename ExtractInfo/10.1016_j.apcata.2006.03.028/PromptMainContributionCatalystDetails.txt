Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation over Pt–Zn-containing zeolites
Abstract
Starting from the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU), Pt–Zn-containing catalysts with a zinc content between 0.6 and 13.4 wt.% and a platinum content of 0.5 wt.% were prepared. Zinc was introduced by impregnation or aqueous ion exchange, platinum by subsequent impregnation with H2PtCl6. The catalysts were characterized by chemical analysis (AES/ICP), X-ray diffraction (XRD), FT IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine, nitrogen adsorption and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). After the aqueous ion exchange of the zeolites with nSi/nAl-ratios ≥ 26, the zinc content in the catalysts was higher than that expected from their ion exchange capacity. This over-exchange with zinc was explained by the formation of oxidic zinc species. The Pt–Zn-containing zeolites were tested in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at 555 °C. Aromatization occurred over the 10-membered-ring zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11, whereas propane dehydrogenation was the major reaction over the 12-membered-ring zeolites Na-Beta, Na-mordenite, K-L and Na-Y. The different procedures used for the incorporation of zinc did not significantly affect the catalytic behavior of the large-pore zeolites with lower nSi/nAl-ratios (≤ 3.4). The highest and most stable conversion levels were obtained on zeolites Beta and mordenite with nSi/nAl-ratios ≥ 8.7 and zinc contents close to 2.5 wt.%. Over the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a stable conversion close to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (XPr ≈ 29%, T = 555 °C and p = 0.1 MPa) was observed for at least 63 h time-on-stream. The propene selectivity over this zeolite was > 90%.
1. Introduction
As alternatives to steam cracking, the so-called on-purpose propene manufacturing technologies are gathering increasing attention driven by a strong propene demand [1]. In the last decade, the application of Pt–Sn-based catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes has been largely reviewed [2], [3]. In these bimetallic catalysts, the addition of the second, more electropositive metal to platinum leads to increased activity, improved product selectivity and catalyst lifetime [4]. Recently, the use of Pt–Sn-containing zeolites L and Y as catalysts for the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, especially n-butane and isobutane, has been widely investigated [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. For instance, Hill et al. reported that in the presence of hydrogen, a zeolite-based Pt–Sn–K-L catalyst exhibited significantly higher rates of isobutene formation compared to a Pt–Sn–K–silica catalyst [5]. However, an additional hydrogen supply facility is costly and makes an industrial process more complex. Additionally, the Pt–Sn–K-L zeolite was subjected to a slow deactivation [5], [6]. Alexander and Huff [7] discovered that the Pt–Zn system, again supported on zeolite L, is a superior catalyst with isobutane conversion levels close to thermodynamic equilibrium at high olefin selectivities (Xi-Bu ≈ 42% for the conversion of isobutane to isobutene and hydrogen at T = 538 °C and p = 0.07 MPa). Moreover, this catalyst showed a very low deactivation rate (0.4% conversion loss per day from Xi-Bu = 41% at 3.5 h on-stream) in the absence of hydrogen. Despite the attractive performance in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic behavior of the bimetallic Pt–Zn system supported on zeolites with other structure types than zeolite L has rarely been reported [10], [11], [12]. Dessau, for instance, found that, during the dehydrogenation of n-hexane, zeolite Cs-Beta loaded with platinum produced much less undesired light gases than a Pt–K-containing zeolite L [13].
Zn-containing zeolites have repeatedly been reported to be attractive catalysts for the conversion of light alkanes into more valuable products such as aromatics and olefins [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. In particular, increased rates for the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation and selectivities to unsaturated products were observed on zeolite Zn-ZSM-5 (MFI) with respect to the Zn-free zeolite H-ZSM-5 [15]. Furthermore, zeolites H-ZSM-12 (MTW), H-ZSM-35 (FER), H-Y (FAU) and H-mordenite (MOR) containing 0.5 wt.% platinum were investigated for the dehydrogenation of propane. These catalysts exhibited high propane conversions (up to ca. 20%) and propene selectivities (up to ca. 75%) [19].
Zeolites are particularly attractive host systems for dehydrogenation catalysts, since they may impose shape-selectivity, thus favoring the formation of dehydrogenation over oligomerization products such as coke. In addition, high metal dispersions may be favored in the zeolite pores. Nevertheless, zeolites have been rarely studied as supports for the bimetallic Pt–Zn system [7], [10], [11], [12]. Pt–Zn-containing zeolites without Brønsted acid sites would be interesting catalysts for the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. In these catalysts, cracking, aromatization and oligomerization as undesired side reactions may be prevented. However, up to now, few reports exist on zinc loading into completely Na- or K-exchanged zeolites [7], [20], [21].
In the present work, we report on a systematic investigation of the loading of the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (MFI), Na-ZSM-11 (MEL), Na-Beta (*BEA), Na-mordenite (MOR), K-L (LTL) and Na-Y (FAU) with zinc through impregnation or ion exchange with aqueous solutions of zinc salts. After adding platinum, the resulting Pt–Zn-zeolites were tested as catalysts in the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation. In particular, the effect of the zeolite structure, the nSi/nAl-ratio, the zinc loading and its location on the activity and selectivity in the catalytic conversion of propane were investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Zeolite ZSM-5 with different aluminum contents (nSi/nAl = 10, 21 and 55) and zeolites ZSM-11 (nSi/nAl = 36), Beta (nSi/nAl = 26), mordenite (nSi/nAl = 8.7) and L (nSi/nAl = 3.4) were synthesized according to procedures reported in the literature [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Zeolite Na-Y (nSi/nAl = 2.6) was supplied by Union Carbide Corporation. Except for Na-Y and K-L, all zeolites were completely Na+-ion-exchanged with a 1 M aqueous solution of NaNO3 (purum p.a., Merck) at 80 °C (3 h, overnight, 3 h). Zn,Na-zeolites were obtained by a three-step ion exchange (3 h, overnight, 3 h) at 80 °C with aqueous solutions (msolution/mzeolite = 100) of zinc nitrate (purum p.a., Merck) or zinc acetate (Zn(Ac)2, purum p.a., Merck). In all exchange steps, the zinc amount offered in the aqueous solution was equal to the maximum cation exchange capacity of the zeolites based on the number of aluminum atoms or to the quantity necessary to achieve similar zinc loadings of ca. 2.5 or 4 wt.% in the final catalysts. To better investigate the properties of zinc over-exchanged materials, a few samples were prepared from zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 55) and Na-Beta (nSi/nAl = 26) by ion exchange using a zinc amount that exceeded the ion exchange capacity of the zeolites. After ion exchange, the zeolites were dried overnight in air at 80 °C. The H+-form of zeolite Beta was prepared from the NH4+-form by 24 h treatment at 450 °C in a nitrogen (12 h, 100 cm3 min−1) and an air (12 h, 100 cm3 min−1) stream. The NH4+-form was obtained from the as-synthesized Beta zeolite by a three-step ion exchange (3 h, overnight, 3 h) at 80 °C with 0.1 M aqueous solutions of ammonium nitrate. Some Na- or K-zeolites were loaded with zinc by impregnation with an aqueous solution (msolution/mzeolite = 10) of zinc acetate (Zn(Ac)2). The amount of zinc salt in the solution was chosen to have a zinc content of ca. 2.5 wt.% in the final Pt–Zn-catalyst. The Zn-containing zeolites were impregnated with H2PtCl6 directly after ion exchange or impregnation with zinc or after an additional treatment in flowing air at 550 °C for 12 h.
In the catalyst nomenclature, an xPt–yZn/zeolite denotes a Zn- and Pt-impregnated sample, while an xPt/yZn-zeolite is a zinc ion-exchanged and Pt-impregnated material. The values x and y represent the Pt- and Zn-loading of the catalyst in wt.%, respectively. These were determined by AES/ICP analyses. In the partially exchanged Zn-zeolites, the extra-framework cations Na+ or K+ are listed after zinc independent of the nNa or K/nZn-ratios, e.g. 2.5Zn,Na-Y (nSi/nAl = 2.6, nZn/nAl = 0.1, nNa/nAl = 0.8).
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Elemental compositions of the solid materials were determined by atomic emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma (AES/ICP, Perkin Elmer, Plasma 400). X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained with a Siemens D 5000 system using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54 nm) and 2° min−1 as the scanning rate. The phase purity and crystal sizes (dcryst.) were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Cambridge, CamScan 44). Information about the nature of the acid sites was gained by FT IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine (≥ 99.8%, Fluka). FT IR spectra were recorded at 2 cm−1 resolution, between 400 and 4000 cm−1, by means of a Bruker FT IR Vector 22 spectrophotometer. Thin self-supported wafers were prepared, activated in vacuum (8 h, T = 400 °C, p < 10−6 hPa) and cooled down to 80 °C inside the IR cell. The activated samples were loaded with pyridine for 30 min at 200 °C (pPyr,0 °C = 3.4 hPa). After evacuation to 0.1 Pa, the transmission IR spectra were recorded at increasing cell temperatures (T = 200, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500 °C). The specific surface areas (SSA) and the specific pore volumes (Vp) were determined by nitrogen adsorption isotherms (BET method) using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 gas adsorption analyzer. Each sample was oxidized in air at 400 °C for 12 h and degassed at 350 °C for 8 h to a pressure ≤ 6.7 kPa before the measurement. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) of the catalysts was performed in an AMI-1 (Altamira, Inc.) instrument equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Before the TPR measurements, the catalyst samples (400 mg) were pressed without a binder, crushed, sieved (dp = 0.3–0.6 mm) and pretreated in flowing argon (30 cm3 min−1) at 150 °C for 2 h. In the case of zeolites L, Beta and Y, a preceding additional drying step at 150 °C in air for 12 h was necessary to eliminate most of the adsorbed moisture. Subsequently, the samples were cooled to 40 °C, whereupon the reduction was started in a flow of 11 vol.% hydrogen in argon (15 cm3 min−1) with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 up to 600 °C.
2.3. Catalytic propane conversion
Before the catalytic experiments, the zeolite powders were pressed without a binder (p = 200 MPa), crushed, sieved (dp = 0.2–0.4 mm), calcined in a flow of air (100 cm3 min−1, 400 °C, 12 h) and activated in flowing hydrogen (100 cm3 min−1, 555 °C, 4 h). They were subsequently used as catalysts in the conversion of pure propane (99.95 vol.%, Westfalen) at ambient pressure in a flow-type apparatus with a fixed-bed reactor made of quartz-glass (T = 555 °C, p = 0.1 MPa, WHSV = 2.6 h−1, mcat. = 400 mg). Selected catalyst samples were regenerated in flowing air (50 cm3 min−1) at 550 °C for 2 h. The coke loading of the samples was determined after the catalytic experiments by chemical analysis for carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen (Vario EL, Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
3.1.1. Zinc ion exchange
The results of the chemical analyses of the Zn-containing 10-membered-ring zeolites Na-ZSM-5, Na- and H-ZSM-11 are summarized in Table 1. As expected, the zeolites exchanged in aqueous solutions with higher concentrations of the zinc salts also have higher zinc contents and nZn/nAl-ratios. The lower nNa/nAl-ratios with respect to the parent zeolite indicate an exchange of Na+ ions for cationic zinc species. Biscardi et al. suggested the formation of isolated Zn2+ species during the aqueous zinc exchange of zeolite H-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 14.5) [28]. Assuming that Zn2+ is the prevailing species in the zinc ion-exchanged zeolites, the (2nZn+nNa)/nAl-ratio is expected to be equal to unity. Moreover, the nZn/nAl-ratio of a completely Zn2+-ion-exchanged zeolite should equal 0.5. In the zeolite Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 55), especially at zinc loadings higher than 0.6 wt.%, the nZn/nAl-ratio is significantly higher than 0.5 (Table 1). This indicates that the amount of zinc incorporated into the zeolite is larger than that expected from the ion exchange capacity of the zeolite. This over-exchange of zeolites with zinc is a phenomenon already reported in the literatures [29], [30]. It has been attributed to binuclear (Zn–O–Zn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn–(O–Zn)n)2+ moieties bridging adjacent aluminum atoms and/or to the formation of extra-framework ZnO species [29], [30]. The over-exchange is particularly obvious for zeolite Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 55) the nNa/nAl-ratio of which is much higher than that expected from the substitution of Na+ for Zn2+. For instance, for an nZn/nAl-ratio of 0.3, the observed nNa/nAl-ratio (0.8) is significantly different from the one expected (nNa/nAl = 1 − 0.3 × 2 = 0.4).

Only one step (3 h) ion exchange.
The presence of zinc species with different charges in the ion-exchanged zeolites has been repeatedly discussed in the literatures [20], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. Nevertheless, the origin of the above-mentioned oxidic zinc species is still a matter of debate. According to some authors, (Zn–O–Zn)2+ clusters are formed through the condensation of two Zn(OH)+ ions sitting on nearby framework aluminum atoms upon dehydration (T = 80 °C, Eq. (1)) [29], [30]:
(1)
2Zn(OH)+ → (Zn–O–Zn)2+ + H2O
Zn(OH)+ cations can originate from the hydrolysis of Zn2+ according to Eq. (2). Berndt et al. were the first to advance the idea of the Zn(OH)+ formation and concluded that this is the final species on the cation exchange sites [31]:
(2)
Zn2+ + H2O ⇆ Zn(OH)+ + H+
However, if Zn(OH)+ was the only cationic zinc species, the nZn/nAl-ratio of a completely zinc ion-exchanged zeolite would have a value of 1, thus failing to explain nZn/nAl-ratios above unity.
In zeolite Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 55), Zn2+ ions can hardly be stabilized by two adjacent aluminum atoms because of the low density of aluminum atoms. Thus, a maximum Na+ substitution of 40% (nNa/nAl = 0.6) is observed for this high-silica zeolite. Similarly, Penzien et al. [29] observed that isolated Brønsted acid sites can hardly be exchanged by Zn2+ cations. However, their presence cannot be excluded. It is, therefore, reasonable to assume Zn(OH)+ species, as proposed by Berndt et al. [31], to be initially present at cation exchange positions. Nevertheless, in the further course of the ion exchange or during the drying of the zeolite after the ion exchange, these species either remain isolated or undergo a transformation which eventually leads to the deposition of ZnO. Another hypothesis is the formation of Zn(OH)2 from Zn(OH)+ via Eq. (3). Zn(OH)2 can further react to both ZnO and multinuclear zinc species through Eqs. (4) and (5):
(3)
Zn(OH)+ + H2O ⇆ Zn(OH)2 + H+
(4)
Zn(OH)2 → ZnO + H2O
(5)
2Zn(OH)+ + nZn(OH)2 → (Zn–(O–Zn)n+1)2+ + (n + 1)H2O
Therefore, ZnO, binuclear (Zn–O–Zn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn–(O–Zn)n+1)2+ species derived from Zn(OH)+ as the only precursor might coexist and account, together with isolated Zn2+ ions, for the total amount of zinc present in the zeolite. In what follows and for conciseness, the above-mentioned oxygen-containing zinc species will be referred to as “oxidic zinc species”.
Similar to the observation made for zeolite Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 55), the (2nZn+nNa)/nAl-ratio of the zinc ion-exchanged zeolites ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 10 and 21) and ZSM-11 deviates from unity, in most cases to lower values (Table 1). Again, part of the incorporated zinc species can bear one charge. After adsorption of pyridine on these samples, FT IR absorption bands were observed at 1451 and 1540 cm−1 characteristic for Al3+-Lewis and Brønsted acid sites, respectively. Therefore, an ion exchange by protons or a dealumination of the zeolite framework could also be responsible for the (2nZn+nNa)/nAl-ratios below 1.
In the FT IR spectra of the activated Zn-zeolites ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 10, 21 and 55), the appearance of a band at 3610 cm−1 (stretching of hydroxyl in [Si–(OH)–Al] bridges) is consistent with the formation of Brønsted acid sites upon ion exchange of the Na+-zeolites with Zn2+ solutions. This is supported by the fact that the zeolites ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 10 and 21) and ZSM-11 which were partially ion-exchanged (nZn/nAl < 0.5) exhibit a (2nZn + nNa)/nAl-ratio lower than 1 (Table 1). Additionally, the suspensions of zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11 were found to be slightly acidic (pH ≤ 6) after the ion exchange with zinc. The hydrolysis of Zn2+ (Eq. (1)) as well as that of Zn(OH)+ (Eq. (3)) can contribute to the low pH. As expected, the pH of a Zn(NO3)2 solution is lower than that of a Zn(Ac)2 solution with the same concentration. This is due to the higher strength of the corresponding acid HNO3 with respect to HAc. The higher H+-concentration in the Zn(NO3)2 solutions leads to lower zinc contents in the exchanged zeolites compared to those exchanged with Zn(Ac)2. This is shown in Table 1 for the zeolites Na-ZSM-11 and H-ZSM-11. These findings largely support the zinc exchange mechanism suggested by Berndt et al. [31]. In contrast to Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 55), 90% of the Na+ ions of zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 10 and 21) were available in the substitution for H+ or Zn2+ (Table 1). This suggests that, at higher aluminum contents, the formation of Zn2+ species bridging two adjacent framework aluminum atoms as proposed by Biscardi et al. [28] becomes more favorable. Therefore, the (2nZn+nNa)/nAl-ratio is equal or close to one for the completely exchanged zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 10 and 21, nZn/nAl = 0.5, Table 1).
Table 2 shows the zinc contents and the molar ratios nSi/nAl, nZn/nAl, (2nZn+nNa or K)/nAl and nNa or K/nAl for the zeolites Na-Beta, Na-mordenite, K-L and Na-Y after the ion exchange with aqueous solutions of Zn(Ac)2 or Zn(NO3)2. As observed for the 10-membered-ring zeolites, higher amounts of zinc are incorporated into the zeolites at higher zinc concentrations. In the case of zeolite Beta, the (2nZn+nNa or K)/nAl-ratio deviates from unity either to higher values due to the formation of oxidic zinc species or to lower values, possibly due to ion exchange by protons. The over-exchange with zinc is more pronounced at higher zinc loadings.

Only one step (3 h) ion exchange.
The (2nZn+nNa or K)/nAl-ratio of the other large-pore zeolites is generally equal or close to 1. Due to the high aluminum content of the zeolites Na-mordenite, K-L and Na-Y (nSi/nAl ≤ 8.7), the accommodation of Zn2+ ions becomes more likely (vide supra). Therefore, the pore structure seems to play a less important role than the zinc loading or the nSi/nAl-ratio for the tendency towards over-exchange with zinc. Similar to the medium-pore zeolites, lower zinc amounts are found on the large-pore zeolites exchanged with solutions of Zn(NO3)2 instead of Zn(Ac)2. However, the (2nZn+nNa or K)/nAl-ratio of these zeolites does not deviate significantly from unity. In the FT IR spectra of the activated zeolites Zn,Na-Y no indication exists for the presence of bridging structural hydroxyl groups (not shown). Therefore, a substitution of cationic zinc or Na+ for H+ during the zinc ion exchange can be ruled out. Instead, H+ and Zn(OH)+ initially present in the zeolite during the ion exchange can recombine upon dehydration (T = 80 °C) according to Eq. (6). The generated Zn2+ species are more easily stabilized by two aluminum atoms in these zeolites due to the low nSi/nAl-ratio.

Zn(OH)+ + H+ → Zn2+ + H2O (T = 80 °C)
On all zeolites, the Na- and Zn-contents were unaffected by the subsequent impregnation with H2PtCl6 and activation in air. X-ray diffraction patterns proved that the zeolites maintained their crystalline structure after the ion exchange with zinc, the impregnation with platinum and the activation in air (not shown). No indication of the presence of metallic zinc, ZnO, Pt or PtOx was obtained by XRD suggesting a high dispersion of the phases present.
3.1.2. Specific surface area (SSA) and pore volume (Vp)
In order to assess the influence of the presence of bulk metal or oxide phases on the outer catalyst surface, the specific surface area (SSA) and the pore volume (Vp) of selected Pt–Zn-containing samples was compared to those of the parent zeolites (Table 3). As shown for zeolite Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 55), the specific surface area of the catalysts remains nearly unchanged after a loading with 0.5 wt.% platinum. On the contrary, the subsequent impregnation with both zinc and platinum significantly reduces the specific surface area of the parent zeolite. For instance, the specific surface area of Na-ZSM-5 is reduced by 34% after impregnation with 2.5 wt.% zinc and 0.5 wt.% platinum (0.5Pt–2.5Zn/Na-ZSM-5). The specific surface area is lowered by even 73% upon reduction of the Pt–Zn-impregnated ZSM-5 zeolite in hydrogen (100 cm3 min−1, 555 °C, 4 h). The Pt–Zn species obtained through subsequent impregnation with zinc and platinum are most likely deposited on the outer surface of the zeolite. After reduction, large metal particles, possibly of alloyed Pt–Zn, could lead to pore-blocking and to the observed reduction of the specific surface area. If, however, the zinc is introduced by ion exchange, the specific surface area of the parent zeolite is essentially retained as shown, e.g., for zeolite 0.5Pt/0.6Zn,Na-ZSM-5. For ion-exchanged zeolites, the specific surface area is not notably affected either by a slight over-exchange or by the reduction in hydrogen (see data for 0.5Pt/1.3Zn,Na-ZSM-5). This indicates that, in these ion-exchanged samples, the zinc species ((Zn–O–Zn)2+, (Zn–(O–Zn)n)2+ or ZnO, cf. Section 3.1.1), are located inside the zeolite pores, where they cannot alloy with the impregnated platinum. In case of higher zinc loadings introduced by ion exchange, such as for zeolite 0.5Pt/4.4Zn,Na-ZSM-5 (nZn/nAl = 2.4), the specific surface area is clearly lower suggesting that ZnO has been deposited on the outer zeolite surface as a result of the over-exchange. Similar observations are made for zeolites Na-ZSM-11 and Na-Y (Table 3), i.e., a weak or no effect for zinc ion exchange or impregnation with 0.5 wt.% platinum and a significant reduction of the specific surface area for impregnation with zinc, e.g., for 0.5Pt–2.5Zn/Na-Y.

3.1.3. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements were carried out to characterize the reducibility of the platinum and zinc species as well as the nature of the Pt–Zn interaction. Fig. 1 shows the TPR-profiles of the Pt–Zn-containing ZSM-5 zeolites. With respect to the Zn-free zeolite 0.5Pt/Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 55, Fig. 1a), the peak due to the reduction of platinum around 115 °C is gradually shifted to higher temperatures with increasing zinc loading. Silvestre-Albero et al., by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), attributed a similar shift of the platinum reduction temperature upon addition of zinc in zeolite Pt–Zn/Na–X to the reduction of zinc and its alloying with platinum [12]. In contrast to this explanation, the TPR experiments of the current study do not show a higher hydrogen consumption for the reduction of the Pt-related metal phase up to a zinc loading of 1.3 wt.% (
). It may, therefore, be assumed that the zinc is not directly involved in the reduction of Pt4+ to Pt0± in zeolite Na-ZSM-5. The shift of the platinum reduction peak to higher temperatures indicates, however, that it is affected by the presence of zinc (the platinum reduction becomes more difficult, i.e., the platinum species becomes less noble). A similar shift of the platinum reduction temperature is also obvious for the sample 0.5Pt–2.6Zn/Na-ZSM-5 prepared by impregnation of both the platinum and zinc precursors and has been previously observed for Pt–Zn-impregnated silica [33]. The higher amount of hydrogen consumed at ca. 150 °C in the TPR of the sample 0.5Pt–2.6Zn/Na-ZSM-5 (
) supports the involvement of zinc in the reduction of the platinum after impregnation of the zeolite with platinum and zinc. A similarly increased hydrogen consumption has also been observed in the TPR of Pt–Zn-impregnated silica [33]. The alloyed Pt–Zn-particles on the outer surface of the zeolites 0.5Pt/4.4Zn,Na-ZSM-5 and 0.5Pt–2.6Zn/Na-ZSM-5 are possibly responsible for the strong specific surface area and pore volume reduction described above (cf. Section 3.1.2). In the TPR-profile of the strongly over-exchanged zeolite 0.5Pt/4.4Zn,Na-ZSM-5 (nZn/nAl = 2.4, Fig. 1d), two new peaks appear, one at 380 °C and one at 530 °C. A major hydrogen consumption at 380 °C is also found for 0.5Pt–2.6Zn/Na-ZSM-5 (Fig. 1e), on which the metals are probably mainly located on the outer zeolite surface (cf. Section 3.1.2). On the contrary, this hydrogen consumption peak is absent in the TPR-profile of zeolite 0.5Pt/4.4Zn,Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 10, not shown) in which Zn2+ is the prevailing species (cf. Section 3.1.1). The ZnO species formed on the strongly zinc over-exchanged zeolite 0.5Pt/4.4Zn,Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 55, nZn/nAl ≫ 0.5) may, therefore, also be located on the outside of the zeolite pore system. For zeolite 0.5Pt/1.3Zn,Na-ZSM-5 with a lower degree of zinc over-exchange, a reduction peak at 380 °C is absent (nZn/nAl = 0.7, Fig. 1c). This might be a further hint that the oxidic zinc species of this sample, if any, are located inside the zeolite pore system, where they cannot interact with platinum. The additional hydrogen consumption peak at 530 °C on the sample 0.5Pt–4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5 indicates the presence of another, less noble species which is probably associated with the zinc. These zinc species could be the binuclear (Zn–O–Zn)2+ or multinuclear (Zn–(O–Zn)n)2+ moieties discussed above. The formation of partially reduced ZnO cannot be excluded as well.

Fig. 1. TPR-profiles of the Pt–Zn-containing ZSM-5-zeolites (nSi/nAl = 55).
The TPR analysis results of the Pt–Zn-containing zeolite Na-ZSM-11 (nSi/nAl = 36, Fig. 2) are very similar to those of zeolite Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 55). Again, the platinum reduction peak of the Zn-free sample is shifted to higher temperatures with increasing zinc amounts in the zeolite. Moreover, an additional hydrogen consumption peak around 380 °C appears at zinc loadings of 1.0 wt.% or higher (Fig. 2c and d). Interestingly, however, the platinum reduction on the sample 0.5Pt/Na-ZSM-11 (Fig. 2a) occurred at a higher temperature (200 °C) than on the corresponding zeolite 0.5Pt/Na-ZSM-5 (115 °C, nSi/nAl = 55, Fig. 1a). The smaller average crystallite size (Table 3) of the zeolite ZSM-11 might lead to a stronger interaction of the impregnated H2PtCl6 with the support and, thus, to a higher resistance towards reduction.

Fig. 2. TPR-profiles of the Pt–Zn-containing ZSM-11-zeolites.
All the Pt-free zinc ion-exchanged zeolites do not consume any hydrogen during the TPR experiments, as shown here for 7.3Zn-Beta (Fig. 3a). In the Pt-free Zn-impregnated zeolites, less than 5% of the total zinc amount can be reduced (not shown). However, consistently with literature reports for zeolite Na-X [12] and similar to zeolite 0.5Pt–2.6Zn/Na-ZSM-5 (Fig. 1e), the introduction of platinum promotes the reduction of the zinc species, and a hydrogen consumption peak appears at 350–385 °C on 0.5Pt–2.6Zn/Na-Beta (Fig. 3e). However, in all cases, the zinc present on the zeolite is not completely reduced up to temperatures of 800 °C. For instance, only 40% and 60% of the zinc present is reduced in the impregnated zeolites 0.5Pt–2.6Zn/Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 55) and 0.5Pt–2.6Zn/Na-Beta, respectively.

Fig. 3. TPR-profiles of Pt–Zn-containing Beta-zeolites.
With respect to zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11, the shift of the platinum reduction temperature with higher zinc loading is more pronounced on zeolite Na-Beta, i.e., from 126 °C on the Zn-free sample (Fig. 3b) to 235 °C on the sample 0.5Pt/7.3Zn-Beta (Fig. 3d). On the latter zeolite, the major reduction peak at 235 °C has shoulders at 126 and 166 °C. This clearly indicates the presence of similar platinum species as on the samples with lower zinc contents. The hydrogen consumption (
) for the reduction at 235 °C is much higher than that expected for the Pt4+ to Pt0± reduction. Obviously, part of the zinc is also reduced at this temperature, and platinum has possibly alloyed with zinc. The additional reduction peak at 350–385 °C of the zinc over-exchanged zeolite 0.5Pt/7.3Zn-Beta (Fig. 3d) points at the existence of the same ZnO species as discussed for the Zn-impregnated zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn/Na-Beta (Fig. 3e).

3.2.1. Propane conversion over Pt–Zn-containing 10-membered-ring zeolites
3.2.1.1. Pt–Zn-containing zeolite Na-ZSM-5 (MFI)
The propane conversions and the propene selectivities after 1 and 12 h time-on-stream as well as the coke loadings and the zinc loss in wt.% after 12 h time-on-stream over selected zeolites Na-ZSM-5 and Na-ZSM-11 loaded with platinum and zinc are reported in Table 4. Over the Zn-free zeolite 0.5Pt/Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 55), a continuous deactivation occurs. The dehydrogenation of propane is the major reaction over this catalyst with propene yields up to 20% (
 = 79% at XPr = 26%). Methane and ethane from propane hydrogenolysis are the major side products (SMe+Et = 16%) at 12 h time-on-stream. Only in the beginning of the experiments, the rates of propane hydrogenolysis and aromatization are high (SMe+Et = 51%, SAr = 5%). They are responsible for the initially low propene selectivity observed after the first hour of the reaction (
 = 45%). Nevertheless, the yield of aromatics does not exceed 1%, and the final coke loading on this Zn-free zeolite is the lowest among all catalysts studied here.

Literature studies showed that, when added to platinum, zinc can act both as a ligand (electronic effect) and/or a diluent (geometric effect) [11], [34]. A dilution of platinum by zinc can lead to lower rates for side reactions like hydrogenolysis and oligomerization, which require extended reduced platinum ensembles. The propene selectivity of the Pt-containing zeolite Na-ZSM-5 is increased by additional impregnation with zinc. However, the conversion is significantly lower. For instance, over the Pt–Zn-impregnated catalyst 0.5Pt–2.6Zn/Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 55), the steady-state conversion after 6.5 h on-stream does not exceed XPr = 6.2%. With respect to 0.5Pt/Na-ZSM-5, the lower conversion could be due to the larger size of the metal particles formed on the zeolite outer surface upon activation (cf. Section 3.1.2). The considerably lower methane and ethane yields over this catalyst (SMe+Et < 8%) as well as the low propane conversion can be considered to result from an alloying of platinum with zinc (vide supra). Also the ZnO species formed on the zeolite outer surface upon zinc impregnation (cf. Section 3.1.2) might contribute to the improved propene selectivity [35]. These latter species appear to be volatile, because, after 12 h on-stream, condensation of metallic zinc occurred in the colder part of the reactor downstream of the catalyst bed. The loss of active metal phases by volatilization (Table 4) has been previously reported to be a main drawback for the conversion of paraffins over Pt–Zn-impregnated catalysts and is one possible reason for their deactivation [33], [36].
The introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-ZSM-5 by ion exchange inhibits the loss of zinc during the experiments. It also increases the yield of aromatics of the Pt–Zn-containing catalyst. Consequently, the propene selectivity is lower than on the Zn-free or the Pt–Zn-impregnated sample (Table 4). Consistent with results from the literature [15], isolated Zn2+ or Zn(OH)+ ions on cation exchange positions ions can be responsible for these high aromatization rates and coke loadings observed over the zinc ion-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolites. These ions are present in zeolite ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 55) at low zinc loadings (nZn/nAl < 0.3). Unexpectedly, an increase of the zinc content from 0.6 to 1.3 wt.% leads to a lower aromatics yield and a lower propane conversion after 1 h on-stream. One possible explanation is that, with increasing zinc loadings, the Zn2+ or Zn(OH)+ sites become less accessible due to the formation of oxidic zinc species inside the zeolite pores. The higher activity and propene selectivity after a further increase of the zinc loading from 1.3 to 4.4 wt.% zinc may be accounted for by the increasing amount of ZnO on the zeolite. Wan and Chu reported that ZnO supported on silicalite-1 (1.1 wt.%) is an active catalyst for the dehydrogenation of propane at 480–550 °C [35]. Therefore, even though the above-mentioned oxidic zinc species are catalytically less active and more prone to volatilization than the cationic ones, they could be responsible for the increased catalytic activity at zinc loadings higher than 1.3 wt.%. This explanation would also account for the higher propene selectivity and zinc loss observed for the over-exchanged zeolites 0.5Pt/1.3Zn,Na-ZSM-5 and 0.5Pt/4.4Zn/Na-ZSM-5.
A similar decrease and increase of the catalytic activity with increasing zinc loading on zeolite H-ZSM-5 has already been reported by Smiešková et al. [14] for the conversion of n-hexane. However, these authors did not attribute the catalytic behavior to the presence of increasing amounts of catalytically active oxidic zinc species, but only to the formation of different zinc species at higher zinc loadings. This explanation cannot be excluded for the observations made in this study as well. Note that the reduction peaks in the TPR-profile of the zeolite 0.5Pt/4.4Zn,Na-ZSM-5 at 382 and 530 °C were not found for zeolite 0.5Pt/1.3Zn,Na-ZSM-5 (Fig. 1c and d). As deduced above from the analysis of the specific surface area (Table 3) and from the results of the TPR-profile (Fig. 1d) of the zeolite 0.5Pt/4.4Zn,Na-ZSM-5, ZnO species may also form on the outer zeolite surface at higher zinc loadings (mZn ≫ 1.3 wt.%). The catalytic results, therefore, provide additional evidence that the nature of the Pt–Zn interaction can be rather different, if the oxidic zinc species are obtained through zinc impregnation on the one hand or through over-exchange with aqueous zinc salt solutions on the other hand.
With respect to the Pt–Zn-impregnated Na-ZSM-5 zeolites, a decrease of the nSi/nAl-ratio of the zeolite from 55 to 21 does not affect either the propene selectivity or the zinc loss significantly (0.5Pt–2.5Zn/Na-ZSM-5, nSi/nAl = 21, Table 4). On the contrary, substantially lower metal losses, higher conversions after 1 h on-stream and higher aromatics yields were found over the Pt-containing zinc ion-exchanged Na-ZSM-5 zeolites with the lower nSi/nAl-ratios of 10 and 21. This may be attributed to larger fractions of zinc atoms accommodated as Zn(OH)+ or Zn2+ ions at exchanging sites in the zeolites (cf. Section 3.1.1). For the same zeolite, the conversions after 1 h on-stream are nearly independent of the zinc content. However, the deactivation rates and coke loadings after 12 h on-stream are significantly higher at higher zinc loadings. Within the ZSM-5-based catalysts, the highest propane conversion and aromatization rates at 1 h on-stream were observed over 0.5Pt/2.5Zn,Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 21).
Unexpectedly, a further decrease of the nSi/nAl-ratio from 21 to 10 at constant Zn loading results in lower propane conversions and aromatics yields. This could be related to the formation of Brønsted acid sites upon the zinc ion exchange of the Na-zeolites (cf. Section 3.1.1). This agrees with the lower propane turnover rates found by Biscardi and Iglesia [20] over zeolite Zn/H-ZSM-5 with respect to zeolite Zn/Na-ZSM-5. The more intense FT IR absorption band at 3610 cm−1 observed for zeolite 0.5Pt/2.5Zn,Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 10, not shown) with respect to zeolite 0.5Pt/2.5Zn,Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 21) suggests that Brønsted acidity is probably also responsible for the increased rates of propane cracking and oligomerization observed on the former zeolite (not shown). In comparison to the catalysts based on zeolite Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 55), the zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 10 and 21) are stronger aromatization catalysts and even less suitable for making propene in high yields.
3.2.1.2. Pt–Zn-containing zeolite zeolites H- and Na-ZSM-11 (MEL)
Independent of the zinc content, all the Pt–Zn-containing Na-ZSM-11 and H-ZSM-11 catalysts obtained by aqueous ion exchange with zinc show similar conversions (XPr ≈ 60%) and propene selectivities (
 ≈ 10%). The deactivation over these catalysts with time-on-stream is negligible (XPr = 60.2%,
 = 10.1% after 12 h on-stream for zeolites 0.5Pt/0.8Zn-ZSM-11 and 0.5Pt/2.7Zn-ZSM-11, Table 4). Aromatization (SAr ≈ 45%) and hydrogenolysis to methane and ethane (SMe+Et ≈ 40%) are the major reactions observed on these catalysts rather than propane dehydrogenation. These results confirm that the shift of the platinum reduction peak in the TPR-profiles (Fig. 2) to higher temperatures with increasing zinc content is due to a different interaction of platinum with the Zn-modified zeolite rather than to alloying of the platinum with zinc. However, the exact reason for the obvious differences between the chemical composition and the TPR-results of the ZSM-11 samples on the one hand and their similar catalytic behavior on the other are not understood so far. Nevertheless, the zinc ion-exchanged and Pt-impregnated ZSM-11 zeolites, similarly to those based on zeolite ZSM-5, proved to be essentially stable aromatization catalysts. The steady-state aromatics yield on these catalysts (YAr ≈ 31%) was even higher than that on the ZSM-5-based analogues.
3.2.2. Propane conversion over Pt–Zn-containing 12-membered-ring zeolites
3.2.2.1. Pt–Zn-containing zeolites H- and Na-Beta (*BEA)
Propane conversions and propene selectivities over the Pt–Zn-containing zeolite Na-Beta samples are reported in Fig. 4. As on zeolite 0.5Pt/Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 55), propene is the primary product (
 > 56%) and a strong deactivation occurs over the Zn-free zeolite 0.5Pt/Na-Beta. In the first 4 h of the experiments, hydrogenolysis and aromatization are significant side reactions over this zeolite (SMe+Et ≤ 27%, SAr ≤ 7%, not shown). The propene selectivity does not exceed 80%. The Pt-free zeolite 2.6Zn-Beta is a more stable, but initially less active (XPr ≈ 15%) and generally less selective (
 < 60%) catalyst than zeolite 0.5Pt/Na-ZSM-5. Interestingly, the coke loading of this catalyst after 12 h on-stream (18 wt.%) was significantly higher than that of the Zn-free zeolite 0.5Pt/Na-Beta and of the Pt–Zn-containing medium-pore zeolites (≤ 11 wt.%, Table 4). The cationic zinc sites that lead to aromatics formation within the 10-membered-ring zeolites appear to catalyze the formation of larger coke precursors in the 12-membered-ring zeolites, probably as a result of larger available specific pore volume (Table 3). This result is consistent with the well-known shape-selectivity effects on the formation of coke in hydrocarbon conversions over medium- and large-pore zeolites, respectively [37].

If both platinum and zinc are present as in the zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, a very active and stable catalyst is obtained. The conversion (XPr ≈ 29%) corresponds to that expected for the thermodynamic equilibrium for the conversion of propane to propene and hydrogen (XPr ≈ 29%, T = 555 °C, p = 0.1 MPa). The propene selectivity exceeds 90% after 12 h time-on-stream (Fig. 4). The hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates are relatively low (SMe+Et ≤ 6%, SAr ≤ 2.5%). The catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta maintains its stable performance up to the end of the experiment (63 h) with negligible loss of zinc. Moreover, the same high activity and selectivity is obtained after regeneration of a used catalyst in air at 400 °C for 2 h. The conversion decrease and the selectivity increase in the initial stages of the experiments are due to higher rates of aromatization and hydrogenolysis, presumably over isolated Zn(OH)+ or Zn2+ sites. This is also supported by the fact that the coke content of the catalyst after 12 h on-stream (ca. 20 wt.%) is similar to that found after 1 h or 63 h on-stream. Coking obviously occurs mainly during the initial stages of the conversion.
In view of the good catalytic results obtained over zeolite 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, the role of the zinc loading was studied in more detail. Stable catalysts are obtained for zinc contents in the range from 1.6 to 2.6 wt.%. The coke loading after 12 h on-stream of the Pt–Zn-containing Beta-zeolites is similar (ca. 18–20 wt.%). A typical feature of these catalysts is the presence of a hydrogen consumption peak at 166 °C in the TPR experiments (Fig. 3c), pointing at a strong influence of the zinc on the platinum with respect to zeolite 0.5Pt/Na-Beta (Fig. 3a). An nZn/nAl-ratio out of the aforesaid range of 0.4 ≤ nZn/nAl ≤ 0.6 leads to catalysts which monotonously deactivate with time-on-stream as illustrated here for 0.5Pt/7.3Zn-Beta (Fig. 4). During the catalytic testing of this over-exchanged zeolite (nZn/nAl = 1.8), metallic zinc condensed in the colder parts of the quartz reactor, as previously observed for the Pt–Zn-impregnated and the strongly over-exchanged zeolites ZSM-5 (cf. Section 3.2.1.1). The zinc content was 21 wt.% lower than in the fresh catalyst. Its deactivation, therefore, could be attributed to the progressive volatilization of metallic zinc. For the deactivation observed when the nZn/nAl-ratio of the zeolite is lower than 0.4, there are no obvious explanations so far. One possibility is that a minimum amount of zinc is needed to sufficiently moderate the noble metal behavior of platinum and obtain a stable catalyst.
Besides the zinc loading, also the acidity of the precursor zeolite and the procedure followed for the zinc incorporation into the zeolites strongly affect the catalytic activity. Zeolite 0.5Pt/1.6Zn-Beta has a (2nZn+nNa)/nAl-ratio of 0.8 (Table 2), which indicates the presence of Brønsted acid sites. Nevertheless, in contrast to what is observed on the ZSM-5-zeolites (cf. Section 3.2.1.1), the presence of Brønsted acid sites does not seem to affect the stability or activity of this catalyst (XPr ≈ 29%, Fig. 5). On the contrary, the catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta obtained by zinc ion exchange of the zeolite H-Beta, while highly selective for propene, shows a lower initial propane conversion of XPr ≈ 20% with noticeable deactivation (Fig. 5). Therefore, the catalysts derived from zeolite Na-Beta instead of H-Beta are more stable.

When platinum and zinc are both impregnated on zeolite Na-Beta, the observed initial conversion is rather low (15%) and deactivation occurs, as illustrated for zeolite 0.5Pt–2.6Zn/Na-Beta (Fig. 5). This might be attributed, as proposed for zeolite 0.5Pt–2.5Zn/Na-ZSM-5 (cf. Sections 3.1.2 Specific surface area (SSA) and pore volume (, 3.1.3 Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR)), to pore blocking by large Pt–Zn metal particles and to zinc volatilization (35 wt.% loss at 12 h on-stream). Thus, the Pt–Zn species on a catalyst prepared by zinc ion exchange and subsequent loading with platinum may allow the formation of metal particles with higher dispersion. An additional treatment of zeolite 2.6Zn-Beta at 450 °C in air before impregnation with H2PtCl6 does not affect the catalyst stability or the conversion level. However, the propene selectivity drops to
 ≈ 75% (0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta, Fig. 5). Possibly, the calcination affects the location or the fractions of the different zinc species.
3.2.2.2. Pt–Zn-containing zeolite Na-mordenite (MOR)
Page has reported on the conversion of propane over zeolites H-mordenite and 0.5Pt/H-mordenite [19]. At 550 °C, the conversions of pure propane over these catalysts were 10.7% and 13.6%, with propene selectivities of 15.8% and 67.7%, respectively. With regard to these catalysts, a higher propane conversion (XPr ≈ 25%) with a propene selectivity exceeding 70% is reached over zeolite 0.5Pt/2.5Zn,Na-mordenite studied here (Fig. 6). Interestingly, this zeolite not only has a zinc content similar to that of the catalyst 0.5Pt/2.6Zn-Beta (Fig. 4), but also shows the same hydrogen consumption peak at 166 °C in the TPR profile (Fig. 3b, not shown for the zeolite mordenite). This suggests that similar platinum, zinc or bimetallic platinum–zinc species are present on both catalysts. Consequently, the catalytic behavior of the Pt–Zn-containing Na-mordenite samples resembles that observed for the catalysts based on zeolite Na-Beta. In the absence of platinum or after subsequent impregnation of the zeolite with both zinc and platinum, less active and less stable catalysts are obtained, e.g., the zeolites 4.2Zn,Na-mordenite and 0.5Pt/2.6Zn,Na-mordenite (Fig. 6). As also found with zeolite Na-Beta, an increase of the zinc content does not necessarily result in an improved catalytic activity with zeolite Na-mordenite as a catalyst precursor. For instance, the catalyst 0.5Pt/4.2Zn,Na-mordenite is less active and deactivates as opposed to 0.5Pt/2.5Zn,Na-mordenite. This confirms that, similarly to zeolite Na-Beta, there is an optimum zinc concentration for an active, selective and stable dehydrogenation catalyst. In contrast to zeolite Beta, however, the coke loadings of the mordenite-based catalysts are significantly lower (1.0–1.6 wt.% versus 18–20 wt.%). The steric constraints within the less spacious one-dimensional pore system of zeolite mordenite are probably the reason for this finding.

3.2.2.3. Pt–Zn-containing zeolites Na-Y (FAU) and K-L (LTL)
The propane conversions, the propene selectivities after 1 and 12 h on-stream and the coke loadings of Pt–Zn-catalysts based on the zeolites Na-Y and K-L are reported in Table 5. For all Pt-impregnated and zinc ion-exchanged Na-Y zeolites, the conversion of propane does not exceed 22%. A comparison of the propane conversions after 1 and 12 h on-stream clearly reveals that all these catalysts are prone to deactivation. This deactivation is less pronounced at higher zinc loadings. Similarly, Pt–Sn- and Pt–Ir-containing zeolites Na-Y have been reported to be unstable catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane [9], [38]. The propene selectivity in a steady state reached after 2.8 h on-stream is generally higher than 81%. As observed for other zeolites (vide supra), the lower initial propene selectivities (1 h time-on-stream), especially at higher Zn contents, are a result of higher hydrogenolysis and aromatization rates. As a consequence of the higher fraction of isolated Zn2+ sites (cf. Section 3.1.1), aromatization of propane can readily occur on Pt–Zn-containing zeolite Y. Like for the zeolite Beta-derived catalysts, the initially formed aromatics may undergo consecutive reactions to coke deposits. Accordingly, the coke loadings of the Pt/Zn,Na-Y zeolites are comparably high as on the catalysts based on zeolite Beta which also possess a spacious, three-dimensional pore system (Table 5).

Despite the similarity of the Pt–Zn-containing zeolites Beta and Y with respect to coke formation, their performance as propane conversion catalysts is completely different. Opposite to zeolite Pt–Zn-Beta, the introduction of zinc into zeolite Na-Y by ion exchange does not give a more active or stable catalyst than that from sequential impregnation with zinc and platinum. The Pt–Zn-impregnated sample 0.5Pt–2.7Zn/Na-Y is even the best catalyst among all catalysts based on zeolite Na-Y (Table 5).
In contrast to the findings of Alexander and Huff with isobutane as the reactant [7], all Pt–Zn-containing K-L zeolites are subject to deactivation in the conversion of propane (Table 5). This deactivation is more pronounced, and the coke loadings are significantly lower than on the zeolite Na-Y-based catalyst samples. These results are similar to those observed for zeolite mordenite. They suggest that the less spacious, one-dimensional pore system of zeolite L is rapidly blocked by coke precursors, finally leading to catalyst deactivation. Despite the low coke contents and the high propene selectivities, it was not possible to obtain a similarly stable Pt–Zn–K-L catalyst as reported by Alexander and Huff [7]. These authors prepared the catalysts by subsequent impregnation with zinc and platinum. Similar to the catalysts based on zeolite Na-Y, ion exchange of zeolite K-L with zinc does not produce a Pt–Zn-catalyst with improved properties compared to the Zn-impregnated sample 0.5Pt–2.7Zn/K-L. The propene selectivities are comparable, or slightly higher than those of the corresponding catalysts prepared from zeolite Y. The increased cracking rates are responsible for the lower selectivities at higher zinc contents, e.g.,
 = 88.4 and 81.3% for zeolite 0.5Pt/5.4Zn,K-L at 1 and 12 h on-stream, respectively.
An explanation for the peculiar catalytic properties of the Pt–Zn-containing zeolites Na-Y and K-L is that, due to the high aluminum content of these zeolites (nSi/nAl < 3.4), a zinc ion exchange might already occur upon impregnation with the aqueous Zn2+ solution. This is consistent with the negligible zinc loss observed on these zeolites after catalytic testing, as opposed to the Pt–Zn-impregnated zeolites Na-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl = 21 and 55, Table 4) and Na-Beta (vide supra). The considerably higher aluminum content (nSi/nAl < 3.4) is also the major difference to the catalysts prepared from zeolites Na-Beta and Na-mordenite. As discussed above, the zinc species that are more probably present on the aluminum-rich zeolites are isolated Zn2+ or Zn(OH)+ ions rather than polymeric ZnO-like clusters (cf. Section 3.1.1). Consequently, for the same zinc content, a different Pt–Zn interaction may prevail in zeolites Na-Y and K-L with respect to zeolites Na-Beta and Na-mordenite. Alternatively, the higher hydrophilicity of the aluminum-rich zeolites Na-Y and K-L prevents a high dispersion of the Pt-precursors during impregnation and/or disfavors an intimate interaction with oxidic zinc species located partly inside the zeolite pores. Consequently, the observed propane conversion levels over the Pt–Zn-catalysts Na-Y and K-L are generally lower than 25%. Nevertheless, these samples are excellent dehydrogenation catalysts with propene selectivities exceeding 81%. In particular, zeolite 0.5Pt/2.7Zn,K-L shows the highest selectivity for propene (
 ≈ 93%) among all the tested medium- and large-pore zeolites with a similar zinc content (2.5–2.7 wt.%). A deeper understanding of the nature of these Zn species and of the Pt–Zn interaction on the molecular level would be necessary to further improve the catalytic performance of these Pt–Zn-containing zeolites in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.
4. Conclusions
Pt–Zn-containing zeolites with different framework structure types were systematically investigated as catalysts for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Pt–Zn-catalysts based on both the Zn-impregnated and the strongly zinc over-exchanged zeolites are selective for propene, but deactivate rapidly. Volatilization of metallic zinc, sintering of the Pt–Zn metal phase and coking contribute to this phenomenon. The zinc loading of the zeolites by aqueous ion exchange reduces the Zn-loss and pore blocking during the catalyst activation and the propane conversion. However, upon this ion exchange, zinc species other than Zn2+, such as Zn(OH)+, binuclear (Zn–O–Zn)2+, multinuclear (Zn–(O–Zn)n)2+ moieties, ZnO as well as Brønsted acid sites can form. For a given zeolite type, the fraction of these different zinc species can be controlled by varying the zinc concentration, the pH of the zinc salt solution or the zinc salt precursor. A large fraction of isolated Zn2+ cations causes aromatization in the 10-membered-ring zeolites ZSM-5 and ZSM-11 and coke formation with rapid deactivation in the 12-membered-ring zeolites L and Y. On the contrary, highly active and stable catalysts are obtained for slightly zinc over-exchanged 12-membered-ring zeolites with intermediate nSi/nAl-ratios (8.7 ≤ nSi/nAl ≤ 26). Thus, the Pt–Zn-loaded zeolite Na-Beta (nSi/nAl = 26, mPt = 0.5 wt.%, mZn = 1.6–2.6 wt.%) exhibited the highest propane conversions (corresponding to the thermodynamic equilibrium for the dehydrogenation to propene) with propene selectivities exceeding 90% for at least 63 h time-on-stream. It is conceivable that oxidic zinc species located inside the zeolite pores affect this peculiar catalytic behavior. Due to their stability even in the absence of added hydrogen, these catalysts may offer an attractive alternative to the widely studied Pt–Sn-containing L-type zeolites.
