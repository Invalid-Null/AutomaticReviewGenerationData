The given document does not appear to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). While it discusses the catalytic performance of Group III oxides supported on niobia for propane dehydrogenation, the focus seems to be on relating the physico-chemical characteristics of the catalysts to their catalytic activity rather than specifically improving selectivity, conversion or stability of PDH or ODH. No clear details are provided on conversion, selectivity, stability, or other key performance metrics for PDH or ODH. Since the relevance to advancements in PDH or ODH catalysts is unclear, I have indicated that the document is not directly related.
