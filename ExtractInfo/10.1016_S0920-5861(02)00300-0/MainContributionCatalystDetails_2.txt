The given document does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation. It discusses the characterization and catalytic activity of group III oxides (Al2O3, Ga2O3, In2O3) supported on niobium oxide (Nb2O5) for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. However, it does not provide sufficient details on propane dehydrogenation specifically. The catalyst composition, conversion, selectivity, and other key metrics for propane dehydrogenation are not reported. While propane is mentioned as a feed, the focus seems to be more on studying the physicochemical properties and acid-base characterization of the Nb2O5 supported catalysts in general. Without explicit propane dehydrogenation results, it is difficult to assess the catalyst's viability or potential enhancements for this particular reaction.
