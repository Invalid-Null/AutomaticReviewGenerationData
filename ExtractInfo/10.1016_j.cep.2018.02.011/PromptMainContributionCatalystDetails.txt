1. Introduction
The demand for the processes of natural, associated, refinery gases and their components transformation into olefins grows very quickly [1]. Dehydrogenation processes are widely used in modern refining and petrochemistry, in particular, for the synthesis of monomers and long-chain olefins [2]. However the dehydrogenation of light alkanes presents a significant problem, associated with their low reactivity, high temperatures of the processes, and a low selectivity.
A number of publications appeared last decades [3], in which the use of hydrogen permeable membranes was proposed to overcome the thermodynamic limitations of dehydrogenation of alkanes. Most of the investigations were devoted to catalytically inert membranes used for reactants separation only [4]. It is also possible to find [[5], [6]] the examples of the efficient applications of inorganic composite catalytic membranes. In particular, palladium-containing composites provide a high extent of selective removal of hydrogen from the dehydrogenation zone [[6], [7], [8], [9]]. Thereby, the dehydrogenation processes can be run in such reactors at lower temperatures and provide a higher conversion of light alkanes and a higher selectivity to alkenes. However, the high cost of membranes containing noble metals and the problems with their durability are the drawback of composite membranes. Nevertheless, many studies offer the ways to overcome these shortcomings [[10], [11]].
The other way to intensify the dehydrogenation of alkanes is their oxidative dehydrogenation (OD). In the case of ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODE), these reactions are as follows:
(1)
C2H6 + 1/2O2 → C2H4 + H2O ΔH298 = −105 kJ/mol,
(2)
C2H6 + 7/2O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O ΔH298 = −1428 kJ/mol,
(3)
C2H4 + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 3H2O ΔH298 = −1323 kJ/mol.
This approach allows a significant temperature reduction of this process, resulting in a higher selectivity and lower coking of catalysts. A number of catalysts to improve the ethane conversion and selectivity to ethylene were proposed [[6], [12]]. The most promising systems appeared to be a mixture of molybdenum, vanadium and some other oxide additives [[13], [14]]. The studies of the OD mechanism and improvement of the reactors design are under way [[2], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]].
However, the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene has not become an industrial process up to now due to the explosiveness of oxygen and hydrocarbon mixtures at elevated temperatures. A promising way to solve this problem can be the use membrane reactors-distributors in ODE [22], allowing one to separate the flows of alkane and oxygen [[6], [22], [23], [24]].
The aim of this work was ethylene production by ethane oxidative dehydrogenation in a membrane reactor-distributor, in which the external surface of the inert asymmetric ceramic membrane is covered with a layer of catalytically active mixed oxide.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of a membrane catalyst
The procedure of an oxide Mo-V-Te-Nb-Ox catalyst preparation was developed and described in detail earlier [[25], [26]]. In this work, it was used for the ODE both in a conventional plug-flow reactor and in a membrane reactor. In a conventional reactor, used for comparison, 220 mg of the granulated catalyst (250–500 μm fraction) was charged.
The industrial (Inoceramic, Germany) and pilot-industrial (Fraunhofer, IKTS, Germany), tubular asymmetric membranes were used as a catalyst carrier in the membrane reactor. Their main (wide porous) part consisted of α-Al2O3 with an average pore diameter of 0.2–1 μm and narrow-porous part from γ-Al2O3 with an average diameter of selective pores of 60–70 nm.
To control the transport and catalytic properties of the membranes, the similar commercial asymmetric tubes coated with a layer of zeolite (NaY faujasite), manufactured as pilot samples by the Institute of Ceramic Technologies and Fraunhofer Systems (IKTS, Germany, www.ikts.fraunhofer.de) were used in experiments. The samples represented hollow tubes with a diameter of 10 mm, a length of 70 mm and a wall thickness of 1.75 mm. The average pore diameter of the selective carrier layer was 0.15 μm, and the size of the zeolite micropores was about 0.7 nm.
To improve the properties of the membrane carrier on the basis of commercial Inoceramic tubes, their outer surface was also modified by titanium oxide coating, which mass was 5–8% TiO2 of the membrane weight. The layer of titanium oxide served as a regulator of the porous structure of the inert membrane tube and the catalyst support. The modification was carried out by impregnating the membrane with liquid tetrabutoxytitanium at room temperature, after which the membrane tube was annealed in air at 600 °C for 2 h. The treatment was repeated 2–6 times.
The catalytic layers of the Mo-V-Te-Nb-Оx catalyst synthesized by the method described in [27] were deposited on the outer surface of this tube from the water suspension.
The transport characteristics of catalytic membranes were determined by means of membrane permeability investigation for H2, He and Ar in situ in the membrane reactor at 20 °C.
2.2. ODE in a plug-flow membrane reactor
The composite membrane catalysts were tested in ODE at the temperatures of 320–460 °C in the “tube in tube” (Fig. 1) quartz glass membrane reactor. The initial ethane stream was fed to the outer (catalytic) surface of the membrane tube (shell zone). Pure oxygen was fed into the internal volume of the membrane (tube zone), sealed from the outlet side, and was supplied to the catalytic surface by diffusion through the membrane. ODE experiments were carried out by varying the ratio of the initial gas flows (O2:C2H6) and their mutual directions.

Fig. 1. The scheme of the membrane reactor with separated O2 and C2H6 flows for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.
The value of the internal volume and the associated linear flow rate of gas can significantly affect the selectivity of the process: at a sufficiently low linear gas flow rate, the reaction can occur in the free volume of the reactor that is not filled with a catalyst and the main process is the complete oxidation of ethane. In order to suppress this possibility, the entire internal volume of the reactor was filled with fine quartz particles, which reduced the free volume by a factor of about 4.
Long-term tests of composite membrane catalysts showed that the catalytically active Mo-V-Te-Nb-O phase has a rather high stability (>30 h of testing) at temperatures up to 380–400 °C. However, heating the system to about 460 °C causes a relatively fast and irreversible decrease in the specific activity. The regeneration of the Mo-V-Te-Nb/γ-Al2O3 composite membrane for its subsequent repeated use was carried out by removing the deactivated catalyst layer by chemical treatment, which allowed the removal of more than 90% of the spent catalyst. The repeated deposition of the catalytically active Mo-V-Te-Nb-O phase onto the purified ceramic tube allows us to obtain the composite with just a small difference in the catalytic properties compared to the initial sample.
The product analysis at the outlet of the shell reactor zone was carried out using a gas chromatograph with a thermal conductivity detector and a column with Porapak Q at 30 °C. In all experiments, the main reaction products were ethylene and CO2, with a negligible small admixture of CO.
As the measure of the catalyst activity, we used the conversion of ethane (X) calculated by the formula:
(4)
X = (φ0 − φ1)/φ0,
where φ0 and φ1 are the ethane concentrations at the inlet and outlet of the reactor, respectively.
The selectivity of the formation of carbon-containing ODE products was determined as the fraction of ethane molecules converted to ethene by Reaction (1).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Gas permeability of asymmetric mesoporous membranes modified by TiO2 layers or zeolite NaY
The investigation of the surface modification of the asymmetric alumina membrane by different amounts of titanium oxide on the transport properties of membranes demonstrated that the permeance of the gases through membranes decreases with the increasing mass of TiO2. Since the permeance value is practically independent of the pressure drop (Fig. 2), the contribution of the viscous flow to the gas flow through the membrane can be neglected. We believe that a slight increase in the permeanсe of hydrogen through both membranes, unlike helium and argon, can be caused by the presence of small defects (microcracks) in the deposited layers, which leads to the appearance of a viscous flow at elevated pressure drops. This is most noticeable for hydrogen whose molecules are most mobile. Thus, it can be assumed that diffusion of the penetrant through the membrane is carried out in the regime of molecular leakage.

The presentation of Fig. 2 data in the Knudsen coordinates (Fig. 3) shows the nearly linear dependence of the gas permeance of titania-containing membranes on the reciprocal root of their molecular masses. In these coordinates, the straight line for the membrane with a higher content of TiO2 shows the slightly larger correlation coefficient of the linear approximation. However, both membranes with TiO2 embedded in the pores provide a regime of molecular leakage even for such small molecules as H2 and He. This provides bases to believe that oxygen and ethane can be mixed directly in the catalytic bed.

The permeance of the asymmetric alumina membrane with a layer of microporous NaY zeolite for hydrogen, helium, and argon proved to be almost two orders of magnitude lower than that of the initial membranes based on mesoporous alumina (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4. H2, He, and Ar permeance dependences versus the trans-membrane pressure difference for the Mo-V-Te-Nb/Al2O3 + zeolite NaY membrane.
In this case, both the permeability and the selectivity of the gas transfer proved to be significantly lower than in the case of transport through mesoporous membranes with a TiO2 layer.
As can be seen in Fig. 4, at a relatively low trans-membrane pressure drop (Δp), the permeability coefficients of all three gases under investigation do not depend on Δp, which indicates the fulfillment of the Knudsen law, thus confirming the implementation of the molecular leakage regime in the zeolite channels. This is due to the fact that the kinetic diameters of the molecules are much smaller (0.26–0.34 nm) than the average size of micropores of the NaY selective layer (∼0.7 nm). That is why, in this case, one cannot expect an inverse dependence of the gas permeance on the kinetic diameter, as well as a noticeable effect of surface diffusion on the transport of these gases.
At the same time, the pronounced dependence of the permeance on the molecular mass of gases and the dependence of the permeance coefficient of hydrogen and helium on the pressure drop in the high-pressure region, is apparently due to the fact that the transport of the gases through zeolites occurs not only by the Knudsen mechanism, but also through microdefects (microcracks) in the zeolite coating [[30], [31]]. It is the presence of microcracks that provides a relatively low selectivity of gas transport through such membranes, despite the small pore size in the zeolite.
Based on the results of the gas permeance study of asymmetric alumina membranes modified by deposition of titanium oxide layers or NaY zeolite onto the working surface, it can be assumed that such a modification will enhance the efficiency of the ODE in the membrane reactor by improving the distribution and supply of ethane and oxygen streams to the catalyst surface.
3.2. ODE in membrane reactors with different composite membranes
The comparison of the results of ODE experiments in the membrane reactor, in which the Mo-V-Te-Nb-Ox catalyst was deposited onto the asymmetric Al2O3 tube (Fig. 5a), and the results on the same catalyst in a conventional flow reactor (Fig. 5b) demonstrates that in the membrane reactor, the ethane conversion is higher at temperatures below 420 °C. Noteworthy, the selectivity for ethylene in the membrane reactor over the entire temperature range exceeds 0.95.

Fig. 5. Temperature dependences of the ethane conversion (1) and selectivity to ethylene (2) for ODE on the Mo-V-Te-Nb catalyst in the membrane (a) and conventional (b) flow reactors: – the total flow rate = 1170 cm3/h at the ratio O2:C2H6, = 1:3 (the initial flow rates in the membrane reactor are 292 cm3/h for O2 and 878 cm3/h for C2H6).
The increase in the ethane conversion at low temperatures in the membrane reactor, as compared with the conventional reactor, may be due to the more advantageous distribution of reactants on the surface of the catalyst in the case of the oxidant diffusion through the membrane. In a conventional reactor, the ratio of the concentrations of ethane and oxygen on the surface of the catalyst is determined by their competitive adsorption. When oxygen is fed through the membrane by diffusion (in a membrane reactor), the role of the competitive adsorption of oxygen and ethane is reduced, and the conditions for oxygen access to the active sites at the catalyst surface become more favorable. With the temperature increase, the ratio of the adsorption coefficients of both reagents varies, which, apparently, leads to a convergence of the ethane conversion in the conventional and membrane reactors.
One of the ways to optimize the various processes in catalytic membrane reactors is to change the mutual directions of the flows of reactants or carrier gas supplied to different sides of the membrane, see, for example, [[6], [32], [33]].
As can be seen in Fig. 6, the co-current mode of the reactants supply to the catalytic surface of the membrane provides a significant increase in the ethane conversion compared to the counter-current mode. This effect is most likely due to the different distribution of ethane and oxygen fluxes along the membrane (and the catalyst bed). When the reactants are fed in the co-current mode, they are fed to the catalyst layer with a maximum concentration, which ensures more complete oxidation of ethane.

Fig. 6. Ethane conversion in the membrane reactor with the Mo-V-Te-Nb-Ox active phase at different stream modes: (1) – co-current; (2) – counter-current, the initial flow rates in the membrane reactor are 558 cm3/hfor O2 and 1672 cm3/h for C2H4 (O2:C2H6 = 1:3).
The use of membranes with a lower permeance can provide a more selective reaction. In this concern, further experiments were carried out on membranes modified with faujasite (NaY zeolite) [[28], [29]] or titanium oxide having a significantly higher diffusion resistance and selectivity of gas transfer. The membrane with a modifying layer of NaY zeolite exhibits the lowest gas permeability. The results of the ODE on the Mo-V-Te-Nb catalyst supported on such a membrane are shown in Fig. 7.

Fig. 7. The temperature dependences of the C2H6 conversion and ethylene selectivity for ODE on the Mo-V-Te-Nb/γ-Al2O3 + zeolite NaY membrane catalyst. O2:C2H6 = 1:2, flow rates in the membrane reactor are 283 cm3/h for O2 and 567 cm3/h for C2H6.
This catalyst showed the conversion values and the process selectivity that are comparable with those of Mo-V-Te-Nb/γ-Al2O3 at low temperatures. However, as the temperature increases, the low permeability of the membrane is responsible for the negative trend. It should be noted that in this experiment, the ratio of the concentrations of oxygen and ethane, which is impossible to mix in a conventional reactor, was used.
From this point of view, a more preferable result was found for the membrane catalyst with a titanium oxide layer deposited on the Al2O3 membrane. The use of this membrane provides higher values of the ethane conversion at ODE even at relatively low temperatures (Fig. 8).

Fig. 8. The C2H6 conversion at ODE on Mo-V-Te-Nb catalysts deposited on the asymmetric Al2O3 membrane without modification (1) and on Al2O3 modified by 8 mass% of TiO2 (2). The initial flow rates in the membrane reactor are 250 cm3/h for O2 and 400 cm3/h for C2H4. The flows ratio is (O2:C2H6 = 1:1.6).
It is important to note that in this case the conversion of ethane proves to be higher than the conversion of oxygen. This may be due to an increase in the selectivity of gas permeability and, consequently, a change in the distribution of reagents flows accessing the surface of the catalyst. However, it is also important to note the difference in the nature of the catalyst supports, which in this case is titanium oxide. It is most likely that it plays the role of a promoter of the Al2O3/Mo-V-Te-Nb catalytic system.
At the same time, it has a negative effect. So the selectivity of the ODE in this case (Fig. 9) is lower than that for the unmodified membrane (Fig. 5).

The data in Table 1 demonstrate a comparison of the efficiency of the ODE operation in reactors with composite membranes of various types (the efficiency, Y, corresponds to the product of the ethane conversion to the selectivity of its conversion to ethylene). All membrane reactors show a high selectivity for ethylene at temperatures up to 420 °C. However, only the membrane system Mo-V-Te-Nb/Al2O3 + TiO2 (8%) ensures that the conversion of ethane is higher than 50% and, despite the lower selectivity, that the membrane catalyst Mo-V-Te-Nb/γAl2O3 gives the higher yield of ethylene.

The results obtained indicate the obvious advantages of the use of the membrane system in ODE. First, the membrane approach allows the use of oxygen/ethane ratios in the process of ODE, which are unacceptable in conventional reactors because of their explosive properties. Second, under optimal conditions of the membrane process, the conversion of ethane in one pass can reach 70%, and the selectivity for ethylene is 95-–98%.
When choosing the optimum process temperature, it should be also taken into account that, from a technological point of view, the most important parameter of the catalytic process under discussion is its selectivity for ethylene. An increase in the ethane conversion above 50–60% does not give such a positive effect to compensate for a significant decrease in the selectivity, which accompanies an increase in the conversion at temperatures above 420 °C in conventional ODE reactors due to the deep oxidation of ethane and ethylene to CO2. At the same time, at the conversions lower than 30%, an increase in the selectivity above 97% does not provide economic efficiency of the process compared to the existing ethane pyrolysis scheme.
4. Conclusions
The process of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane is carried out in the catalytic membrane reactor with separate supply of ethane and oxygen flows to the surface of the catalyst. The obtained results showed the possibility of increasing the ethane conversion and the selectivity of the ODE process using a membrane reactor.
Modification of the surface of the ceramixc membrane by a layer of titanium oxide before deposition of the catalyst layer provides an increase in the catalytic activity of the membrane. The use of such membranes in the process of ODE allows one to achieve a conversion of ethane in a single pass up to 70% and a selectivity of 95–98%. It was also shown that it is possible to reuse the membrane support after the catalytic layer has lost its activity.
