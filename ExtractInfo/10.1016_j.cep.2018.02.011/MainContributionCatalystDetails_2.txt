 Unfortunately this document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation to produce propylene. The document focuses on ethane oxidative dehydrogenation to produce ethylene. Since propane dehydrogenation is not discussed, I will output that the document is not relevant.
