 Based on the provided document, this does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses the gas-phase oxidation reactions of small alkanes (ethane, propane, butane) with the VO2+ cation. While there is some discussion of dehydrogenation products, the focus is on characterizing the reaction mechanisms and selectivity differences between the alkanes, rather than converting propane specifically to propylene. Since propane dehydrogenation is not a main topic, I will indicate this is not relevant and not provide output in the requested format.
