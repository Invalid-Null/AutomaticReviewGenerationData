 Based on the document provided, this does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) for converting propane to propylene. The document discusses the gas-phase oxidation reactions of small alkanes including ethane, propane, and butane with the VO2+ cation. It does not focus on converting propane specifically to propylene via dehydrogenation.
