 Based on the provided document, this does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses the gas-phase oxidation reactions of small alkanes, including ethane, propane, and butane, with the VO2+ cation. While it provides some mechanistic insights into C-H bond activation, it does not present any specific catalyst or process related to converting propane to propylene. Since propane dehydrogenation is not a focus, I cannot extract the requested catalyst details or performance enhancements.
