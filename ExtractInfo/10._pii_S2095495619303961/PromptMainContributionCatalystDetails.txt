AbstractAbstract
The effect of the Al2O3 structure on the performance of Pt/Ga/Al2O3 catalysts is investigated for the direct dehydrogenation of propane. The study unveils that the structure of Al3+ determines the bulk structure of catalysts, particularly a high content of coordinatively unsaturated Al3+ sites (penta-coordinated Al3+, denoted as Al3+penta) could lead to a remarkably improved dehydrogenation activity of the catalyst. The bulk characterization reveals that the sufficient amount of Al3+penta in Al2O3 benefit the dispersion of Pt and Ga2O3 on the Al2O3 support. At the same time, TPR results reveal that the presence of Pt facilitates the reduction of Ga2O3, likely due to the hydrogen spillover between the well dispersed Pt and Ga2O3, which consequently enhances the synergistic function between Pt and Ga2O3 in the dehydrogenation of propane. Recyclability tests demonstrate that the dehydrogenation activity stabilizes after three cycles over the Pt/Ga/Al2O3 catalyst.

1. Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is one of the most important issues in chemical engineering industry due to the growing demand for propylene throughout the world. Moreover, the on-going shale gas exploration imposes significant technical and economic challenges and opportunities for the traditional petrochemical industry. Under such a background, production of light alkenes from alkanes gains renewed attention [1] not only in academia but also in chemical industry. It is known that PtSn (Oleflex process from UOP) [2], [3], [4] and CrOx (Catofin process from CB&I Lummus) [5], [6], [7] supported on Al2O3 are active catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes, and have been widely employed in commercial dehydrogenation processes. Although substantial understanding of the catalytic mechanism has been gained and consequently catalytic performance improved, the limited resource of Pt and the environmental pollution from Cr still demand the search for alternative economic and eco-friendly catalysts.
Ga2O3 is another typical non-precious metal oxide for dehydrogenation of light alkanes and has been investigated intensively. Both bulk and supported Ga2O3 have been utilized as catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, and Ga2O3 supported on alumina seems the most common one among these catalysts [8], [9], [10]. A heterolytic dissociation reaction mechanism was proposed and the Lewis acid sites generated on the catalysts through the interaction of Ga2O3 with Al2O3 were assigned as the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction [11], [12], [13]. However, the dehydrogenation activity of Ga2O3-based catalysts still needs improvements. In addition, it has been reported [14] that the PDH performance of Ga/Al2O3 could be remarkably improved through the addition of trace amount of platinum (0.1 wt%) on the catalyst, whereas in absence of Ga2O3, the activity of 0.1 wt% Pt/Al2O3 is negligible. Thus, Ga2O3 is supposed to be the active sites in the dehydrogenation process. Therefore, it is significant to investigate the synergistic function mechanism between the Pt and Ga2O3 in the reaction for further improvement of the dehydrogenation performance via rational modification of the structure of the catalyst as well as the deep understanding of Ga2O3-catalyzed dehydrogenation mechanism.
In the present work, in order to investigate and further improve the synergistic function between Pt and Ga2O3 as well as to profoundly understand the dehydrogenation performance of Ga2O3-based catalysts, we tentatively modulated the interaction between Pt and Ga2O3 through tuning the coordination structure of Al3+ in Al2O3 supports through various preparation methods. And the dehydrogenation performance of the Ga2O3-based catalysts was evaluated. NMR and TEM were utilized to elucidate the locations of the supported metal ions and the influence of unsaturated coordinate Al3+ (Al3+penta) sites on their dispersion. H2-TPR was also performed to unveil the synergistic effect of Pt and Ga2O3 and the hydrogen spillover ability. Finally, the reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation over the catalyst was proposed, and their stability was also examined through cycling tests.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
C–Al2O3 used in the present work is commercial Al2O3, purchased from Alfa Aesar (1/8 pellets, product # 43832), with a specific surface area of 256 m2/g. Sg–Al2O3 was prepared using a sol-gel method [15]. Briefly, 2.85 g EO20PO70EO20 (Aldrich, Pluronic P123, average molecular weight = 5800 g/mol) was dissolved in a mixture of 60 mL ethanol and 4.8 mL concentrated HNO3 (65–68 wt%) by blending at room temperature. Then 6.12 g aluminum isopropoxide was added into the above solution, which was stirred overnight. The clear solution was then put into an oven and dried at 65 °C for 48 h. The dried gel was grinded to powders and then calcined in static air from room temperature to 550 °C at a ramping rate of 1 °C/min and held for 6 h, and then elevated to 600 °C at 5 °C/min and held for 2 h. Hd–Al2O3 was synthesized via a hydrothermal homogeneous precipitation process [16]. Briefly, 7.5 g Al(NO3)3·9H2O, 9.61 g urea and 2.96 g l-lysine were dissolved in 65 mL deionized water. The obtained mixture was then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave, and sealed at 100 °C for 48 h. After this procedure, the precipitates were washed thoroughly with deionized water several times, dried at 110 °C, and then heated to 600 °C at a ramping rate of 2 °C/min and calcined for 4 h.
Ga/C–Al2O3 was prepared by a wet impregnation method. Firstly, a certain amount of Ga(NO3)3·xH2O was dissolved in deionized water, and then C–Al2O3 with a desired amount was added into the above solution. After stirring at room temperature until dry sediment, the product was dried at 110 °C overnight, and then calcined in air at 600 °C for 4 h. Ga/Sg–Al2O3 and Ga/Hd–Al2O3 were prepared following the same procedure as Ga/C–Al2O3.
Pt/Ga/Al2O3 was prepared by impregnation of Pt onto different Ga/Al2O3. The final products were calcined in air at 600 °C for 4 h. The loading of Pt and Ga was 0.1 wt% and 5 wt%, respectively, for all catalysts.
2.2. Catalytic activity measurements
Reaction was carried out in a quartz tube with an inner diameter of 9 mm, which was packed with 0.10 g catalyst (40–60 mesh pellets). The reaction conditions were 853 K, 10 kPa propane, 90 kPa N2 with a total flowrate of 20 mL/min. Note that blank experiment confirms the pyrolysis of propane could be neglected at the present reaction conditions. An online gas chromatograph was used to analyze the effluents. For the regeneration, the spent catalysts were regenerated at 600 °C for 30 min in a flowing dry air (20% O2 in N2).
2.3. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out on a Rigaku D/Max 2500 diffractometer with a Cu Kα mono-chromatic radiation source from 10° to 80° at a scan rate of 5°/min.
The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured at −196 °C on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 apparatus. Prior to the measurements, the samples were degassed at 300 °C for 4 h. The specific surface area of the samples was determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The cumulative pore volume and pore size were calculated from the desorption branches of the isotherms employing the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.
Temperature programmed reduction by H2 (H2-TPR) was carried out on a Micromeritics Auto Chem II 2920 system. Prior to the TPR characterization, the catalysts (100 mg) were dried in flowing Ar at 200 °C for 1 h. A 10% (v/v) H2 in Ar mixture was used as the reductant with a flow rate of 25 mL/min. The TPR profile was recorded while the catalyst was heated at a rate of 10 °C/min up to 700 °C. STEM and EDX-mapping images were taken with JEM-2100F at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.
The NMR experiments were carried out on Bruker Avance III 600 spectrometers (14.1 T) using 4 mm wvt probe with the spinning rate of 13.0 kHz at ambient temperature. 27Al and 71Ga experiments were carried out at 156.37 and 183.01 MHz, respectively. 27Al MAS NMR studies were performed with a pulse length of 0.73 µs, a recycle delay of 0.5 s with 1024 accumulations. 71Ga MAS NMR spectra were recorded with a pulse length of 2.0 µs, a recycle delay of 2 s with 1024 accumulations. 27Al and 71Ga NMR spectra were referenced using (NH4)Al(SO4)2·12H2O (δ(27Al) = −0.4 ppm) and Ga(NO3)3 (δ(71Ga) = 0 ppm), respectively.
XPS experiments were performed on a Thermofisher ESCALAB 250Xi instrument, equipped with an Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray anode. The binding energies were calibrated using C1s peak of contaminant carbon (BE = 284.6 eV).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic performance
The catalytic activities of various Ga/Al2O3 catalysts prepared via different methods are displayed in Fig. 1. It is seen that Ga/C–Al2O3 exhibits the best catalytic activity, with the propane conversion decreasing from 19.7% to 14.2% after 3 h time on stream. The dehydrogenation activity of Ga/Hd–Al2O3 is inferior to Ga/C–Al2O3, whereas its stability is better. Ga/Sg–Al2O3 shows the lowest activity among them. Their selectivity for C3H6 follows the same sequence as the catalytic activity, and Ga/C–Al2O3 displays the highest selectivity (>90%).

After a trace amount of platinum loading onto the Ga/Al2O3 catalysts, the dehydrogenation performance of all catalysts shows an abrupt enhancement compared to their parent counterparts without Pt in Fig. 2. Moreover, Pt/Ga/Hd–Al2O3 and Pt/Ga/Sg–Al2O3 present much more activity increment in comparison with Pt/Ga/C–Al2O3. For instance, the initial conversion of propane is 65.5%, 59.0%, and 36.7% for Pt/Ga/Hd–Al2O3, Pt/Ga/Sg–Al2O3, and Pt/Ga/C–Al2O3, whereas they are only 11.5%, 8.0%, and 19.6% in the absence of Pt. It is worth to note that the PDH activity of Pt/Hd–Al2O3 and Pt/Sg–Al2O3 could be neglected under the present conditions (Fig. S1). The conversion of propane on Pt/C–Al2O3 is slightly higher than that on the other two catalysts.

In addition, the comparison of dehydrogenation performance over the Pt/Al2O3, Ga/Al2O3 and Pt/Ga/Al2O3 catalysts illustrates the promoting effect of Pt and the vital role of Ga/Al2O3 structure on the PDH activity. Moreover, the synergistic effect between Pt and Ga2O3 improves the activity of Pt/Ga/Hd–Al2O3 and Pt/Ga/Sg–Al2O3 much more significantly than Pt/Ga/C–Al2O3.
The structure of Ga/Hd–Al2O3 and Ga/Sg–Al2O3 is also beneficial for a high selectivity of C3H6 in the presence of Pt and it remains above 95% over Pt/Ga/Hd–Al2O3 and Pt/Ga/Sg–Al2O3 throughout the 200 min. In comparison, the initial selectivity of C3H6 is 95.5% over Pt/Ga/C–Al2O3, and it decreases to 92.2% after 3 h, which is similar to the propene selectivity on the bare Ga/C–Al2O3. With time on stream, however, these catalysts deactivated gradually.
3.2. Structure and properties of the catalysts
The PDH activity of different platinum-promoted Ga/Al2O3 catalysts differentiates greatly. To understand this difference, the structure and property of these catalysts were characterized and analyzed as following. Table S1 lists the basic textural data of different Ga/Al2O3 catalysts. The BET surface area of Ga/C–Al2O3 and Ga/Sg–Al2O3 is similar, and that of Ga/Hd–Al2O3 becomes slightly higher. In addition, the isotherms of N2 adsorption-desorption (Fig. 3a) for all catalysts exhibit the IV type, indicating the mesoporous structure of all Ga/Al2O3 samples.

The XRD spectra are presented in Fig. 3(b). Ga/C–Al2O3 and Ga/Hd–Al2O3 exhibit the characteristic diffraction patterns of γ-Al2O3. The much weaker diffraction of Ga/Hd–Al2O3 than that of Ga/C–Al2O3 indicates the poor crystallinity of Al2O3 in Ga/Hd–Al2O3. On the other hand, Ga/Sg–Al2O3 shows a diffraction peak around 22° as well as a broad diffraction peak at 67° indexed as (440) diffraction of γ-Al2O3. The XRD patterns of the samples indicate that there is a mixture of amorphous and γ-Al2O3 phase in Ga/Sg–Al2O3 and Ga/Hd–Al2O3. No diffraction peaks of Ga2O3 are observed, indicating that Ga2O3 is highly dispersed and/or due to its low loading.
The differences in crystallinity and phases of Al2O3 in Ga/Al2O3 reflect the different coordination structures of Al3+, which could influence the dispersion of loaded species as well as the metal-support interaction, and thereby leading to different catalytic behavior. MAS NMR characterization gives detailed information about the coordination structure of Ga3+ and Al3+ in the catalysts. The 71Ga MAS-NMR spectra of Ga/Al2O3 and Pt/Ga/Al2O3 samples are shown in Fig. S2(A, B). There is no visible peak for 71Ga in Ga/C–Al2O3, indicating that the Ga3+ ions are in a very low symmetry that causes a very strong electric field gradient at the location of the nuclei [17]. The NMR peak at 0 ppm in Ga/Sg–Al2O3 and Ga/Hd–Al2O3 indicates that Ga3+ is octahedral-coordinated in these two samples [18]. After the trace amount of Pt loading, however, there is no 71Ga peak for all Pt/Ga/Al2O3 catalysts, indicating the asymmetric coordination environment of Ga3+ ions in the catalysts. There have been studies [19], [20], [21] about the effect of Ga3+ coordinate structure on the Lewis acidity as well as the catalytic dehydrogenation property. It is shown that different Ga3+ coordinate structures almost presented less impact on catalytic activity of Ga2O3 than other factors.
The 27Al MAS-NMR spectra of Al2O3, Ga/Al2O3 and Pt/Ga/Al2O3 samples are displayed in Fig. 4. C–Al2O3 exhibits two peaks at 10 and 68 ppm (Fig. 4a) representing Al3+ ions in octahedral (Al3+octa) and tetrahedral (Al3+tetra) coordination, respectively, which is the characteristic 27Al NMR features of γ-Al2O3. Besides, there is also a rather weak NMR peak at 35 ppm, which is assigned to Al3+ ions in unsaturated pentahedral coordination (Al3+penta) [22], [23]. Importantly, as for Sg–Al2O3 and Hd–Al2O3, besides Al3+octa and Al3+tetra, there is a considerable content of Al3+penta. It is clearly seen that the coordinate structure of Al2O3 supports are quite different due to the various preparation methods. Additionally, the slight differences of the chemical shifts of Al3+octa and Al3+tetra are proposed to be due to the different chemical environments in different Al2O3 samples.

Fig. 4(b)–(d) shows that after the deposition of Ga and Pt, the peak intensity of Al3+penta decreases for all the samples, and concomitantly, the peak intensity at 10 ppm corresponding to Al3+octa increases. The quantification of Al3+ ions content in different coordination structures is shown in Table 1. From the data in Fig. 4 and Table 1, it is concluded that the loading of Pt and Ga causes the decrease of Al3+penta sites and the increase of Al3+octa sites at the same time.

: Notably, the percentages of various coordination states of Al3+ are calculated based on the peak areas of different coordinated Al3+ sites.
The quantification results in Table 1 clearly suggest that the deposited platinum and gallium ions interact preferentially with the Al3+penta sites. The unsaturated Al3+penta sites tend to anchor the loaded ions via the oxygen bridge to achieve more stable Al3+octa coordinate state [22], [23]. This is likely the reason for the diminished Al3+penta sites and the increased Al3+octa sites upon Ga2O3 and Pt loading in Pt/Ga/Hd–Al2O3 and Pt/Ga/Sg–Al2O3. Thus, the interaction between the dopants and the supports, i.e., the metal-support interaction, might be reinforced through the driving force of the coordinative saturation of the Al3+penta sites.
Since Al3+penta sites have the strong tendency to bind the dopants to achieve the coordination-saturated state, it is reasonable to anticipate that a strong metal-support interaction in the catalysts could be generated on Al2O3 support with plenty amount of Al3+penta. The interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 in the Ga/Al2O3 and Pt/Ga/Al2O3 samples was investigated by H2-TPR in Fig. 5. From Fig. 5(a), it is seen that for Ga/Al2O3 samples, there is one reduction peak around 450 °C for Ga/C–Al2O3, whereas there is a major peak at 560 °C with a shoulder at 490 °C on Ga/Hd–Al2O3. For Ga/Sg–Al2O3, there is no obvious H2 consumption peak. The gallium oxide species in Ga/Hd–Al2O3 are more difficult to be reduced than that in Ga/C–Al2O3, indicating the stronger interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 in Ga/Hd–Al2O3 than Ga/C–Al2O3. At the same time, the interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 in Ga/Sg–Al2O3 seems to be the strongest among these three samples. It is already mentioned that the difference of interaction strength between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 is mainly related with the structures of alumina supports. Sg–Al2O3 and Hd–Al2O3 with more Al3+penta sites could enhance the stronger binding of Ga3+ ions.

Fig. 5. H2-TPR profiles of various catalysts.
The addition of trace amount of Pt onto Ga/Al2O3 promotes the reduction of Ga2O3 on the catalyst. As shown in Fig. 5(b), for Pt/Ga/C–Al2O3, the reduction of Ga2O3 displays one peak at 440 °C with a shoulder at 390 °C. Due to the rather low amount of Pt on the catalyst, there is no obvious H2 consumption peak of PtOx. Compared to Ga/C–Al2O3, the reduction peak of Pt/Ga/Al2O3 moves to a lower temperature. The reducibility of Ga2O3 might be related with the promoted H2 spillover by Pt, which was also reported previously for Pt/Ga zeolite system in the aromatization processes of lower alkanes [24], [25]. The shoulder peak at the lower temperature (390 °C) demonstrates the more effective hydrogen spillover between the Ga2O3 and Pt species. In addition, the reduction profile of Pt/Ga/Hd–Al2O3 shows an overall lower reduction temperature than Pt/Ga/C–Al2O3, although the reduction of Ga2O3 in Ga/Hd–Al2O3 is more difficult than Ga/C–Al2O3, indicating that the presence of Pt enhances the reduction of Pt/Ga/Hd–Al2O3 compared to the other catalysts. As for Pt/Ga/Sg–Al2O3, there is still no obvious H2 consumption peak due to the strong interaction between Ga2O3 and Al2O3 in Ga/Sg–Al2O3. To be noted, the quantification of H2 consumption reveals that only a small amount of gallium oxides (< 5%) is reduced under the present conditions. The Ga2O3 could be reduced to metallic Ga and Ga2O, which are liquid and volatile under the present conditions, respectively, and thus it is deduced that the real active state of gallium is Ga2O3 in PDH.
STEM and EDX-mapping characterizations (Fig. 6) were undertaken to investigate the Pt and Ga dispersion on C–Al2O3 and Hd–Al2O3. As shown in Fig. 6(a), 5–8 nm Pt particles are clearly observed on the Pt/Ga/C–Al2O3 catalyst, even though the loading amount of Pt is only 0.1 wt%. The EDX mapping images show that Pt particles prefer to deposit around Ga2O3 sites, and it is clearly seen that the distribution of Ga2O3 and Pt species is not uniform on Al2O3.

Fig. 6. STEM-EDX-mapping photographs of Pt/Ga/C–Al2O3 (a) and Pt/Ga/Hd–Al2O3 (b) catalysts.
On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 6(b), there is no discernable Pt particles in Pt/Ga/Hd–Al2O3, and the EDX-mapping results show that Pt, Ga, and Al elements distribute very homogeneously, indicating the well dispersion of Pt and Ga2O3 on Hd–Al2O3. Combining with the MAS NMR characterizations on the Al3+ coordination structures, it is reasonably deduced that the considerable amount of Al3+penta sites in Hd–Al2O3 promote the homogeneous distribution of Pt and Ga via the driving force to achieve the coordinate saturated state. To correlate with the reduction behavior of different catalysts, it is proposed that the well dispersed Pt and Ga on alumina supports promotes hydrogen spillover from supported platium to gallium species, which is anticipated to play an important role in dehydrogenation [26], [27].
Herein, to explain the activity differences of various catalysts in Fig. 2, the metal-support interaction and the synergistic function between Pt and Ga2O3 via hydrogen spillover are presumably the two main determinants in the dehydrogenation process. Since Pt/Hd–Al2O3 (in absence of Ga2O3) is almost inactive for the dehydrogenation of propane, Ga2O3 is regarded as the active component for dehydrogenation, which was reported previously [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. In addition, wide studies indicated that the rate-determining step for the dehydrogenation of propane is the hydrogen transfer and desorption from the active sites on Ga2O3 catalysts [28], [29], [30]. The improved hydrogen transportation efficiency is proposed to be the reason for the remarkably enhanced dehydrogenation activity when a trace amount of Pt (1000 ppm) is well dispersed on Ga/Hd–Al2O3. The homogeneously dispersed platinum species likely facilitates the hydrogen transfer and desorption from Ga2O3 effectively via hydrogen spillover. Thus, the active hydrogenation sites are released for further reaction, which consequently improves the PDH performance of Ga2O3. For Ga/Sg–Al2O3, even though it contains the largest number of unsaturated Al3+penta sites among the prepared Ga/Al2O3 samples (Table 1), it is suggested that the too strong interaction between Ga and Al3+penta sites in Ga/Sg–Al2O3 (Fig. 5) may affect the activation of propane and hence limiting the activity of Pt/Ga/Sg–Al2O3 for PDH, as shown in Fig. 2. Due to the least unsaturated Al3+penta sites and nonuniform platinum dispersion, Pt/Ga/C–Al2O3 shows the lowest PDH activity.
3.3. Recyclability of the Pt/Ga/Hd–Al2O3 catalyst
As shown in Fig. 2, the PDH activity of the Pt/Ga/Al2O3 catalysts declines gradually with time on stream. The catalyst deactivation with time on stream is frequently reported in the direct dehydrogenation reactions. To recover its PDH activity, regeneration of the catalysts is necessary. Therefore, the catalyst's cycling stability is important for its future application. For Pt/Ga/Hd–Al2O3 here, after reaction for 2 h at 580 °C, the catalyst is flushed by He for 5 min and then regenerated in dry air at 600 °C for 30 min. The reaction results are displayed in Fig. 7.

Fig. 7. Stability test of Pt/Ga/Hd–Al2O3 by a reaction-regeneration cycle experiment. Propane conversion (a) and propene selectivity (b).
The conversion of propane on Pt/Ga/Hd–Al2O3 decreases stepwise in the first 3 cycles, and thereafter its activity stabilizes. At the same time, the selectivity of propene presents the same trend with activity. The decrease of PDH performance is probably due to the variation of the structure and/or composition of active sites during the reaction-regeneration processes and does not change further after the third cycle. Thus it is inferred that besides the best PDH activity of Pt/Ga/Hd–Al2O3 among the synthesized catalysts, this catalyst also possesses a high recycling stability, which is significant for its future application.
4. Conclusions
The difference of the Al3+ coordination structure in Pt/Ga/Al2O3 catalysts and the synergistic interaction between platinum and Ga2O3 were designed to examine their impact on PDH activity. It was shown that the catalyst containing a considerable content of unsaturated coordinate Al3+ sites (penta-coordinated Al3+, Al3+penta) benefited PDH activity. Characterization of the catalysts revealed that Al3+penta sites promoted the dispersion of platinum and gallium ions on the Al2O3 support, which facilitated the effective hydrogen spillover between Pt and Ga and generated hydrogen desorption from the active sites of Ga2O3. Both of them consequently facilitated the dehydrogenation of propane. Furthermore, the cycling experiments demonstrated that the Pt/Ga/Hd–Al2O3 catalyst exhibited a rather good stability as the initial PDH activity dropped by 10% in the first 3 cycles and then stabilized.
