Propane dehydrogenation over supported platinum silicon nitride catalysts
Abstract
Amorphous silicon nitrides were prepared by gas phase ammonolysis of tetrachlorosilane followed by thermal treatment in nitrogen or ammonia atmosphere. After deposition of platinum on the materials the obtained catalysts proved to be catalytically active and selective for propane dehydrogenation. Incorporation of boron, carbon and titanium in the supports influences significantly the catalytic properties. It is suggested that the comparable high catalytic activity, propene selectivity and stability of the catalysts are due to the basic properties of the catalyst surface.
1. Introduction
Catalytic dehydrogenation processes of lower alkanes (propane, iso-butane) are of great interest due to the growing demand of propene and iso-butene as petrochemical base products. The dehydrogenation of lower alkanes is a highly endothermic reaction and the conversion of the alkanes is limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium [1], [2]. In commercial processes promoted Pt catalysts supported on non-acidic alumina and Cr2O3 catalysts supported on alumina and zirconia are used mainly. During the transformation of the alkanes at high temperatures isomerization, hydrogenolysis reactions and coke deposition take place [1], [2].
In order to improve the stability of the catalysts and to influence the deactivation of the catalysts by coke deposition high surface area non-oxidic materials are of potential interest as catalyst support [3]. In several papers, some nitrides were investigated as solid base catalysts and catalyst supports [4]. Studies in this direction concern mainly the properties of silicon oxynitrides [5], [6], metallophosphate oxynitrides (AlPONs) [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13] and zirconium oxynitrides [14], [15]. The basic properties were investigated using the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. Furthermore, Pt-supported aluminophosphate oxynitrides catalysts were studied in dehydrogenation reaction of iso-butane [11], [12]. Recently, the properties of Pd/Si3N4 catalysts were elucidated for the methane oxidation. It was found that the catalysts are stable under oxidizing conditions at temperatures above 800 °C [16].
In a previous paper, the results about high surface area silicon nitride materials prepared by gas phase ammonolysis of tetrachlorosilane as catalysts for the Knoevenagel reaction were presented [17]. The present paper is devoted to catalytic studies of platinum-supported silicon nitride catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation. In particular, the influence of the support pretreatment and support composition (B, C, Ti dopants) were investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A special designed reactor served for the preparation of amorphous silicon nitride by gas phase reactions between SiCl4 and ammonia at temperatures between 900 and 1200 °C. The reaction system is described in detail in [18]. To prepare boron or titanium modified amorphous silicon nitride powders BCl3 or TiCl4 was added to the SiCl4/N2-gas stream. Hexamethyldisilazane/ammonia mixtures were used to produce Si–N–C materials.
The ammonolysis of metal halogenids results in the formation of ammonium chloride as by-product. Furthermore, chlorine-containing amorphous nitride intermediates are formed in the most cases. After treatment of the powders in an ammonia stream at elevated temperatures it is necessary to produce chlorine-free materials [18], [19].
For comparison of the catalytic properties with a typical basic catalyst magnesium oxide was used. The MgO sample was prepared by precipitation of Mg(OH)2 from a Mg(NO3)2 solution with ammonium carbamate followed by drying and calcination at 450 °C.
Deposition of Pt was carried out by impregnation with a methanolic solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O followed by calcination and reduction in hydrogen atmosphere at 600 °C.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Specific BET surface areas were determined by nitrogen adsorption using the automatic adsorption apparatus ASAP 2000 (Micromeritics). For the calculation of the pore size distributions it was assumed that the pores are of cylindrical shape. Therefore, the equation of Horvath–Kawazoe was used to determine of the pore size distribution [21].
2.3. Catalytic measurements
A tubular fixed-bed micro reactor served for the determination of the catalytic properties of modified nitrides. The reactor consists of quartz glass with an inner diameter of 1 cm. Propane with a purity of 99.995% as well as nitrogen and hydrogen with 99.999% purity were applied. A total mass of 400 mg of the catalyst (grain diameter: 0.1–0.3 mm) were sandwiched between two layers of corundum grains. All gas flows were controlled by means of mass flow controllers (Brooks Instruments). The total flow rate varied in the range between 1 and 40 ml min−1 for propane, 10 and 240 ml min−1 for H2 and up to 6 l h−1 for nitrogen. To reduce the coke deposition and the deactivation of the catalysts the reaction was performed in a gas mixture containing 30 vol.% H2. At higher H2 concentrations the propane conversion is diminished.
The reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC-14B, Shimadzu) using a capillary column (AT-alumina) with a flame ionization detector. Besides propene and unconverted propane small amounts of methane, ethene and ethane were identified in the reaction gas mixture. Preliminary examination of the propane conversion in a quartz reactor without Pt/SiN catalysts indicated that propane is converted at a reaction temperature >600 °C by homogeneous gas phase reactions. With SiN supports about 10% propane was converted at 650 °C.
The support samples are labeled as follows: the number after the term SiN characterizes the pretreatment temperature in ammonia, N2 in parenthesis means pretreatment in nitrogen; next the number after the sample sign SiNX (X=B, C, Ti doping agents) marks the amount of doping agent in wt.%.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Influence of the support pretreatment
As shown in Table 1, the support pretreatment in ammonia at 900 °C leads to a significant decrease of the chlorine content. Chemical analysis indicates a composition equal to Si3N4·xNH3. Further thermal treatment in nitrogen atmosphere at 1300 °C (sample SiN-1300) results in amorphous products with the stoichiometric composition of Si3N4. Crystallization of α-Si3N4 would take place at temperatures higher than 1400 °C. The specific surface area of the samples depends on the pretreatment temperature; samples pretreated at higher temperatures are characterized by significant lower values (Table 2). Microporous analysis by means of the method of Horvath and Kawazoe [21] revealed the presence of micropores with a pore diameter of about 0.6–0.7 nm. The powders have a uniform spherical shape with a particle size of 0.3–1.2 μm [17]. Deposition of Pt results in a significant decrease of the specific surface (Table 2). The reason for that process we do not understand fully. Additional impregnation experiments with the solvent methanol (without H2PtCl6) indicated that the surface area decrease was in the same range. Thus, it is assumed that the SiN support particles suspended in methanol agglomerate leading to a decrease of the specific surface areas.

The influence of the support pretreatment and pretreatment temperature on the catalytic activity and selectivity is presented in Fig. 1. Methane and ethane/ethene were formed in nearly equimolar amounts. At low reaction temperatures, ethene is formed mainly. In comparison to the Pt/MgO reference catalyst, the catalytic activity of the Pt/SiN catalysts are markedly higher. The best results were obtained with catalysts based on SiN(N2)-900 and SiN-1300 pretreated in nitrogen or ammonia, respectively. The catalytic activity was diminished slightly with reaction time in the first stage of reaction. Fig. 2 shows the dependence of the propene selectivity from the degree of conversion. At constant degree of conversion, the highest selectivities were obtained with the catalysts SiN(N2)-900 and SiN-1300.

Comparing the obtained results of the Pt/SiN catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation with those of the SiN supports used as catalysts for the Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with malodinitrile [17] it can be stated that the reactivity sequences for the both investigated reactions are quite different. The reactivity sequence SiN-900>SiN-1300>SiN(N2) was found in the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. The catalyst with the highest amount of chlorine and consequently with the lowest basicity reveals the lowest activity. In contrast, the best results in the propane dehydrogenation were obtained with Pt/SiN(N2) catalysts. Therefore, it seems that the catalytic activity of Pt/SiN catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation is related not only to the basic character of the catalysts. Basic and acidic sites which are coexisting on the catalyst surface are necessary for the catalytic activation of propane. Low values of Pt dispersity indicate that Pt dispersity is probably of minor importance because low values were found. Similar results are described in the literature for Pt-AlPON catalysts used for the dehydrogenation of iso-butane [12].
3.2. Influence of the Pt content
The influence of the Pt content on the catalytic activity and selectivity was investigated using the support material SiN-900/2. As shown in Table 2 Pt/SiN catalysts have a significant lower specific surface than the pure supports. However, increasing Pt contents do not lead to a further decrease of the specific surface. The dispersion of Pt (Table 3) is very low and does not depend on the Pt loading; the average Pt particle size is relatively large. The catalytic activity increases with growing Pt contents whereas the selectivity to propene changes in a reverse order (Fig. 3). In further experiments, the retention time was varied. From the propene selectivity versus conversion degree plot (Fig. 4), it can be stated that catalysts with Pt contents >1 wt.% do not differ significantly; lower selectivity at a constant conversion degree was found for the catalyst with a Pt content of 0.5 wt.%.

3.3. Influence of the support material
Incorporation of B, C, and Ti, respectively, in the SiN powders leads to significant changes of the textural properties and catalytic behavior. It is evident from Table 4 that SiNB samples prepared by ammonolysis of BCl3/SiCl4 mixtures at 900 °C are characterized by a small amount of chlorine. The specific surface decreases with increasing B content. Both IR and NMR spectroscopic investigations show the presence of different types of Si–N and B–N units. Whether Si–N–B units formed is still not clear.

Pt deposition on SiNB supports decreases the specific surface areas markedly; the values increase slightly with enhancement of the boron content in the support. As shown in Fig. 5, a significant increase of the catalytic activity is observed if small amounts of boron are incorporated in the support. Higher amounts of boron decrease the propane conversion degrees. Moreover, the propene selectivities decrease in all cases of the boron containing samples. Residence time depending measurements indicate a decrease of the selectivities for all Pt/SiNB samples at a constant propane conversion degree.

The chemical composition and the textural data of the investigated SiNC samples are summarized in Table 4. Apparently, small amounts of C do not affect the specific surface areas to a considerable extent. Incorporation of higher amounts of C, however, lead to a drastic decrease of the specific surface. Pt deposition on the SiNC supports causes an analogous decrease of the specific surface areas as stated for the SiN and SiNB catalysts as well as low Pt dispersity (see Table 2, Table 3).
Carbon is present in the SiNC materials both as amorphous carbon and as chemically bonded CH3Si(NHx)3, SiCH2Si, SiCC units as well as aromatics and amorphous carbon could be proved by
CP–MAS–NMR spectroscopy (Table 5).
CP–MAS–NMR showed the presence of Si(NHx)4 units and of different carbosilazane units such as (CH3)2Si(NHx)2 or CH3Si(NHx)3. The carbon content of the SiNC materials depends on the synthesis conditions. Rising ammonia concentrations lead to powders with decreasing carbon contents. The formation of amorphous carbon increases with increasing reaction temperature [23].

The catalytic activity of the Pt/SiNC catalysts depends clearly on the C content of the support (Fig. 6). The highest catalytic activity was found for the Pt/SiNC catalysts with 25.3 wt.% C. The propene selectivity depend on the propane conversion; the higher the conversion degree the lower the selectivity. At a constant conversion degree, the lowest selectivity was found for the Pt/SiNC 25.3 sample. The cracking products methane and ethane were found mainly as by-products.

Although the SiNTi supports were treated in ammonia at 900 °C small amounts of chlorine are present in the powders (Table 4). Furthermore, the samples contain different amounts of oxygen caused by the influence of atmospheric humidity during the preparation process of the catalysts. TEM and EDX investigations showed that the SiNTi supports consist of Si–N and Si–N–Ti particles. Pure Ti–N particles were not found.
In contrast to the Ti-free SiN support the specific surface of the SiNTi samples are relatively low. A further decrease was observed after deposition of Pt.
As shown in Fig. 7, the catalytic activities of the Ti-containing samples are comparatively high. The selectivity too propene is changed in a reverse order. Residence time depending measurements reveal that the selectivities at constant conversion degrees decrease with increasing Ti content.

With respect to the obtained results on SiNB, SiNC and SiNTi supports as catalysts for the Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with malodinitrile, it is concluded that no correlation exists between the basicity of the supports or catalysts and their activity in propane dehydrogenation. Previous studies on the support materials reveal that incorporation of B, C, O and Ti in the SiN materials diminishes surface basicity and catalytic activity in the Knoevenagel reaction [22]. In accordance with the results obtained on Pt/SiN catalysts pretreated at different conditions, it is supposed that coexisting basic and acidic sites are essential for the catalytic activity of the Pt-supported SiN catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation.
3.4. Catalysts deactivation and regeneration
As shown, the propane conversion degree decreases in the first stage of the reaction depending on the support composition and pretreatment conditions. The deactivation is caused by the deposition of coke produced by condensation and dehydrogenation reactions of the reactants and blocks the catalytically active sites. The term “coke” describes a variety of carboneous deposits from carbidic carbon to condensed polymers [20]. The long-term behavior of the catalyst 1 wt.% Pt/SiNC 7.8 is given in Fig. 8.The catalytic activity changes only slightly within the investigated reaction time of 24 h. The following regeneration steps in a stream of N2/H2=1 lead to an enhancement of the propane conversion degree; the catalytic activity is restored. A general problem is the decrease of the propene selectivity with increasing reaction time. Apparently, the rate of cracking reactions under formation of methane, ethane and ethene increases. The reason for the selectivity change with the reaction time is still unknown.

The removal of coke by oxidation in a stream of N2/O2 is widely used to regenerate catalysts. In some experiments, the regeneration of the Pt/SiN catalysts was investigated using a stream of N2/O2 (1:1). It was found that after deactivation the catalytic activity can be restored but the propene selectivity decreases significantly. The coke removal from the catalysts is obviously connected with a removal of nitrogen and an incorporation of oxygen caused by the formation of water during the combustion of coke.
4. Conclusions
Catalysts for propane dehydrogenation can be prepared by deposition of Pt on basic SiN support materials. In comparison to the reference catalyst Pt/MgO, the Pt/SiN catalysts are characterized by higher catalytic activity, propene selectivity and stability. Textural measurements reveal that the specific surface areas decrease significantly after deposition of Pt. The Pt dispersity is very low.
Support pretreatment and incorporation of dopants (B, C, Ti) influence significantly the catalytic activity and selectivity of the Pt/SiN catalysts. The best results were obtained with catalysts pretreated at temperatures higher than 1000 °C. Remarkable improvements of the catalytic properties were found after incorporation of small amounts of B, C and Ti in the support material.
The catalytic activity decreases slightly in the first stage of reaction by coke deposition blocking the catalytically active sites. A regeneration in N2/H2 streams restores the catalytic activity but the selectivity decreases with reaction time.
It is suggested that the high catalytic activity, propene selectivity and stability of the Pt/SiN catalysts is related to the acid–base-character of the supports. In comparison to the acidic supports, side reactions such as cracking, condensation and dehydrogenation (of the carboneous deposits) are diminished by the basic character of the support material. Incorporation of oxygen in the catalyst surface leads to an enhancement of the surface acidity and thus, to a decrease of propene selectivity and the catalyst stability.
