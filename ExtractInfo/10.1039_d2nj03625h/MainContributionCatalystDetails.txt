 Unfortunately the provided documents do not seem relevant to propane dehydrogenation as they focus on the esterification of levulinic acid using molybdate-intercalated hydrotalcite catalysts. Since no information related to propane dehydrogenation is presented, I cannot provide a meaningful integrated summary. The output would indicate the documents are not relevant:

<output>
  <Relevance>No</Relevance>
</output>

Please provide documents that contain multiple relevant extractions related to propane dehydrogenation research so I can attempt to integrate the information into a cohesive summary.
