1. Introduction
1,3-Butadiene (BD) is one of the most important chemical intermediates among C4 olefines, and it is an essential feedstock for the production of styrene butadiene rubber, poly-butadiene rubber, and acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene resin (Grasselli, 2002, White, 2007, Yan et al., 2014). The global demand for BD has increased significantly in last decades and the process for the BD production gained much attention. Naphtha steam cracking, the major process for BD production, has several disadvantages in operation because the steam cracking produces not only BD but also many other petrochemicals like ethylene, propylene, and isobutene. The subsequent separation is required (Kung, 1994, Madeira and Portela, 2002, Rubio et al., 2003). Direct dehydrogenation of n-butene into BD is highly endothermic and requires high reaction temperature (Chaar et al., 1988, Soares et al., 2003, Toledo-Antonio et al., 2002). However, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butene into BD is an exothermic process and costs much less energy than dehydrogenation process. In addition, the ODH of butenes can efficiently produce BD in related high yields (Hong et al., 1984, Liaw et al., 1989). Therefore, it has been recognized as a promising process for the production of BD. The key challenge facing this kind of reaction is the design of a suitable catalyst capable of high desired product yield.
Bismuth molybdates have been extensively studied as potential catalysts for the ODH of n-butene to BD. However, pure bismuth molybdates exhibits low performance in ODH reaction (Batist et al., 1966, Batist et al., 1968, Burrington et al., 1980; Van Oeffelen et al., 1985). Many promoters have been investigated to improve the properties of Bi–Mo catalysts (Batist et al., 1972, Jung et al., 2008, Jung et al., 2009, Park et al., 2012, Park et al., 2013). For example, Song et al. have experimentally investigated to enhance the catalytic activity of pure bismuth molybdates by adding oxides such as Co, Fe, and Ni, and the research results have demonstrated that the addition of Co, Fe, and Ni to bismuth molybdates can improve obviously the oxygen mobility and catalyst performance (Jung et al., 2008, Jung et al., 2009, Park et al., 2012, Park et al., 2013). From current investigations, it is generally believed that oxygen mobility of Bi–Mo-based catalysts influences the ODH of butenes, because the reaction follows the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism (Grasselli, 1997, Porteal, 2001, Sleight, 1977), in which surface catalytic sites are reduced by hydrocarbon with participation of the lattice oxygen and followed by re-oxidation with adsorbed O2 from the gas phase. Although metal component in the catalyst does not directly take part in the reaction, the nature of oxygen involved in the reaction can vary depending on the identity of metal component bonded to the oxygen (Ruckenstein et al., 1976, Schuit, 1974, Ueda et al., 1984). Lanthana, a rare-earth metal oxide and a promising promoter for ODH catalysts, is well known for its capability to store and release oxygen and low-temperature reducibility. Lanthana has been considered as well-established catalysts for ODH of ethane (Yu et al., 1998), propane dehydrogenation (Zhang et al., 2007, Zhou et al., 2002) and iso-butane dehydrogenation (Wan et al., 2011) successfully.
Thus, in this work, a series of bismuth molybdate lanthanum oxide catalysts (BiMoLax) with different lanthanum content were prepared by a co-precipitation method, and used in the ODH of 1-butene to BD. BiMoLax oxide catalysts were characterized by using N2 adsorption, elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), 1-butene temperature-programmed re-oxidation (TPRO) and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). The relationship between the catalytic activity and lanthanum content in the catalysts will be discussed, oxygen mobility as well. In addition, the stability and kinetics analysis of the prepared catalyst in the ODH reaction are conducted.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Preparation of BiMoLax catalysts
Bi–Mo-based with different lanthanum content oxide catalysts (x=0–0.4) were prepared by conventional co-precipitation method. The desired amount of lanthanum nitrate solution (La(NO3)3, Aladdin, AR) was dissolved in deionized water at 70 °C and added dropwise into ammonium molybdate solution ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, Sinopharnm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.,99%) under vigorously stirring at 70 °C. Afterwards, bismuth nitrate solution (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, Sinopharnm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., AR) acidified with 10% nitric acid was added dropwise into the above-mentioned mixture. The mixture was adjusted to pH 5 by aqueous 27 wt% NH4OH and aged at room temperature for 4 h and then stirred to viscous solid at the water bath to remove the excess water. The resulting viscous solid was dried at 80 °C overnight and calcined at 550 °C for 2 h in an air atmosphere and then pressed, crushed and sieved to 40–60 meshes before reaction test. The catalysts were designated by BiMoLax (x=0–0.4), where x is the molar ratio of lanthanum in the catalyst.
2.2. Catalysts characterization
Element composition of the prepared catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma and atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Thermo iCAP6300) analyses. The BET surface area and pore volume of the catalysts were determined from multipoint BET isotherms using N2 adsorption (Micromeritics ASAP 2020). X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns of BiMoLax oxide was recorded on XRD 6000 equipped with Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA. Data were collected in the 2θ range of 10–60° with a scan rate of 1° min−1.
For H2-TPR measurement, 50 mg catalysts samples were charged in a U-shape quartz tubular reactor and were heated linearly at a rate of 10 °C min−1under a flowing H2–Ar mixture (10.0% H2 by volume) of 30 cm3 min−1. The consumption of hydrogen was detected by an on-line GC.
The relationship between oxygen mobility and lanthanum content was assessed through 1-butene temperature-programmed re-oxidation (TPRO) on fixed-bed reactor attached to a Hiden QIC-20 quadruple mass spectrometer. For the temperature programmed reduction by 1-butene, 0.2 g catalyst was pretreated at 440 °C for 2 h in flowing 1-butene (20 cm3 min−1), held for 1 h at that temperature and then cooled to room temperature in flowing He (30 cm3 min−1). Subsequent temperature programmed oxidation was performed in flowing 2% O2/He (30 cm3 min−1) from room temperature to 500 °C at 10 °C min−1. 1-Butene-temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) was carried out on the same apparatus. 1-Butene was adsorbed at 50 °C and purged under flowing He (30 cm3 min−1) for 0.5 h before the desorption temperature from 50 to 800 °C at the rate of 10 °C min−1. The mass signals of m/z=54 (C4H6) was monitored.
2.3. Catalytic measurement
Catalytic testing was performed in a tubular fixed-bed reactor (inside diameter =8 mm) with 1.5 g catalyst under atmospheric pressure. The total flow rate is 112.5 cm3/min with a gaseous hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 300 ml·(g cat)−1·h−1(on the basis of 1-butene), and the volume ratio of the feed gases was 1/0.8/10 of 1-butene/oxygen/steam. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst was routinely activated with flowing air stream (50 cm3 min−1) at 440 °C for 2 h. The water feed was continuously vaporized by passing through a pre-heating zone at 120 °C and fed into the reactor together with 1-butene and air. The reactants and products were analyzed by on-line gas chromatography detectors with two columns. A KB–Al2O3/Na2SO4 column of 30 m length and 0.32 mm diameter with a flame ionization detector (FID) were used to analyze hydrocarbons. A TDX-01 column of 0.5 m length and 3 mm diameter with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used for the separation of CO and CO2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure and composition characterization of BiMoLax oxide catalysts
BET surface area, total pore volume and elemental analysis of the BiMoLax oxides catalyst are listed in Table 1. BET surface areas of the prepared catalysts are very low (1.2–3.7 m2/g), as reported in the previous works (Grasselli, 1997, Park et al., 2012, Park et al., 2013, Sleight, 1977). There is no clear relationship between the BET surface areas and lanthanum content, and the total pore volume does not change significantly with the increasing of lanthanum content. Elemental analysis of metal components in the catalysts measured by ICP-AES analyses are in good agreement with the expected one experimentally.

XRD patterns of BiMoLax oxide catalysts with different lanthanum contents are shown in Fig. 1. The solid phase of pure bismuth molybdate catalysts are composed of the α-Bi2Mo3O12, γ-Bi2MoO6 and β-Bi2Mo2O9 phase. However, the solid phase of the BiMoLax catalysts include a certain amount of the La2(MoO4)3 phase besides the above three phases, although the peak assigned to β-Bi2Mo2O9 phase become unapparent. In the Sheelite-type structure of BiMoLax oxides, Bi3+ is octahedral by O34 while Mo6+ are tetrahedral (Sleight, 1977, Yang et al., 2002, Yang et al., 2005) by four coordinated oxygen atoms. The structure and circumstance of Mo=O are further modified by incorporating the third component La to substitute for and occupy the lattice position of Bi. Proper amount of introduced lanthanum, which probably occupies the lattice sites of Bi3+, could improve the redox property, and accelerate the mobility and regeneration rate of lattice oxygen (Yang et al., 2002, Yang et al., 2005, Wu et al., 2007).

3.2. Activity and stability of BiMoLax oxide catalysts in ODH reaction
The prepared catalysts were tested in ODH of 1-butene at 440 °C for 2 h. There are three types of products including dehydrogenation products (BD), isomerization products (trans and cis-2-butene) and combustion products (CO and CO2). The cracking products (CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6 and C3H8) are almost negligible. CO2 and BD are dominating products. Fig. 2 presents the tendency of BiMoLax oxides activity versus lanthanum content. It is evident that the selectivity for CO2 is increased with the increasing of the lanthanum content. However, it is noticeable that conversion of 1-butene and yield for BD show volcano curves tendency regarding lanthanum content. BiMoLa0.2 shows the superior catalytic performance in this work.

To assess the stability of the catalyst, a long term test of the BiMoLa0.2 oxide catalyst, which proved to have the optimum catalytic activity among all BiMoLax catalysts, was carried out. As given in Fig. 3, the conversion and the selectivity to BD are almost constant. The conversion and the yield in BD after 100 h reaction are found to be 74.6% and 71.2%, respectively. The BiMoLa0.2 oxide catalyst exhibits very stable performance.

3.3. TPR, TPRO and TPD analysis of BiMoLax oxide catalysts
It has been reported that the oxygen mobility of Bi-Mo-based catalysts is crucial to their catalytic performance in ODH reaction. In order to explore the correlation between the catalytic performance and the oxygen mobility of BiMoLax, H2-TPR, TPRO and TPD analysis were conducted. TPR experiments can provide valuable insight into the role of the reduction properties of the catalysts. Fig. 4 shows H2-TPR profiles of the BiMoLax oxide catalysts with different lanthanum contents. The peak around 746.0 °C is observed for the sample without La. After La was introduced into Bi–Mo catalysts, the peak around 746.0 °C shifts to the lower temperature obviously. This phenomenon suggests that La-modified catalysts are more easily to be reduced and the lattice oxygen combined with metal cations is more active (Yang et al., 2002, Yang et al., 2005). Among the catalysts studied here, BiMoLa0.2 oxide catalyst has the lowest H2-TPR peak temperature.

TPRO experiments are effective ways to identify the oxygen mobility of catalysts. Prior to TPRO analysis, the prepared samples were pretreated with flowing 1-butene at 440 °C for 3 h. Fig. 5(A) shows the TPRO profiles of BiMoLax oxide catalysts. Two kinds of oxidation peaks were observed for each catalyst, the first peak of TPRO profiles in the range of 170–200 °C corresponds to the oxidation of bismuth species partially reduced and the other one in the range of 380–480 °C is assigned to the oxidation process of molybdenum and lanthanum partially reduced (Miura et al., 1975, Park et al., 2012, Park et al., 2013). It is widely considered that the peak temperature in TPRO indicates the capacity of oxygen mobility on bismuth molybdenum oxides. The lower the temperature is, the easier the oxygen mobility is. Fig. 5(B) gives a comprehensive correlation between the yield for BD and the TPRO peak temperature. It is obvious that the yield decreases linearly with the increase of the temperature. This result implies that the catalytic activity could be improved with increasing oxygen mobility of the catalyst. Therefore, the catalysts of BiMoLa0.2 shows the better activity due to its lower TPRO temperature compared to the others prepared catalysts (Grasselli, 1997, Miura et al., 1975, Park et al., 2012, Park et al., 2013, Sleight, 1977).

The ability of the catalyst to activate 1-butene is another factor leading to the superior activity of BiMoLa0.2. Aiming to confirm this, 1-butene TPD was carried out and Fig. 6 displays the resulting profiles of the prepared catalysts. It is observed that the mass signal shows two volcano curves with desorption temperature at t 100–140 °C and 350–500 °C, respectively. This results from the weakly or strongly adsorbed 1-butene with lattice oxygen of the catalyst. The low temperature peak at 100–140 °C can be assigned to oxygen donor sites. While the high one at 350–500 °C is contributed to the active sites for dehydrogenation (Grasselli, 1997, Park et al., 2012, Park et al., 2013).

There is no doubt that the total area of the TPD profile represents the amount of n-butene adsorbed on the catalysts. The total area of the TPD profile for the BiMoLa0.2 catalyst is much larger than that for the other catalysts. This suggests that the BiMoLa0.2 catalyst possesses abundant adsorption sites for 1-butene, which facilitates the activation of 1-butene in the catalytic reaction.
3.4. The kinetic study of BiMoLa0.2 oxide catalyst for ODH reaction
To further understand certain fundamental aspects of the mechanism over BiMoLa0.2 catalysts for ODH reaction, a kinetic study was performed. The effect of reactant partial pressure on the 1-butene ODH reaction was studied by maintaining the partial pressure of the one reactant constant and varying that of the other, while keeping the total inlet flow constant by balancing with He. These experiments were conducted at five different temperatures (380, 400, 420, 440, and 460 °C), and similar results were obtained at all temperatures studied.
The effect of 1-butene and oxygen partial pressure on the ODH reaction rate over BiMoLa0.2 oxide catalysts is shown in Fig. 7. One can see that the reaction rate is enhanced with the increasing of 1-butene and oxygen partial pressure. Moreover, the reaction rate is also accelerated with the increasing of the reaction temperature. It is necessary to identify the reaction rate related to the reaction temperature, 1-butene partial pressure and oxygen partial pressure.

As many literatures documented, this reaction follows the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism (Grasselli, 1997, Mars and Van Krevelen, 1954, Park et al., 2012, Park et al., 2013), the mechanism can be expressed as (Grasselli, 1997, Mars and Van Krevelen, 1954, Tomilov et al., 1999):

at the different temperatures, as shown in Fig. 8. The k1 and k2 can be calculated, and then, the logarithm of the kinetic rate constants is plotted versus the reciprocal temperature, as depicted in Fig. 9. The apparent activation energy of reduction step and the re-oxidation step are calculated to be 36.1 kJ/mol and 85.0 kJ/mol, respectively. These values are lower than the apparent activation energy of 44.8 kJ/mol and 218 kJ/mol, estimated over the pure bismuth molybdate oxide catalysts (Grasselli, 1997, Grasselli, 2002, Sleight, 1977). It is demonstrated that the reduction step and the re-oxidation step over BiMoLa0.2 oxide catalysts occur more easily.

4. Conclusions
In this work, BiMoLax oxides with different lanthanum content have been tested in ODH of 1-butene to BD. Conversion of 1-butene and yield for BD over BiMoLax oxide catalysts show volcano-shaped curves with respect to lanthanum content. The characterization results indicate that the catalytic performance could be enhanced by increasing oxygen mobility of the catalyst. The lanthanum content of the prepared catalysts has great effects on the adsorption ability of 1-butene, which is related with the activation of 1-butene in ODH reaction. These two factors lead the better activity of BiMoLa0.2 than that of the others. The BiMoLa0.2 oxide catalyst is very stable and no deactivation takes place during the 100 h reaction. The kinetics analysis of ODH reaction over BiMoLa0.2 oxide catalysts is conducted. The apparent activation energy of reduction step and the re-oxidation step are calculated to be 36.1 kJ/mol and 85.0 kJ/mol, respectively. Compared with the pure bismuth molybdenum oxide catalysts, the reduction step and the re-oxidation step can undergo more easily over BiMoLa0.2 oxide catalysts.
