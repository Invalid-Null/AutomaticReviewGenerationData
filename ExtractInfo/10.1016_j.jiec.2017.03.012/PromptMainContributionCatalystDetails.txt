Introduction
Propylene is an important raw material for the production of a wide array of commodities and specialty chemicals [1]. Traditionally, it is mainly produced by steam cracking or fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha [2]. At present, the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has become one promising way to meet the increasing requirement of propylene, since propane is one abundant natural source [3], [4], [5], [6]. Hence, to develop the catalysts with superior catalytic properties should be a priority for all.
Pt-based catalysts are widely investigated in propane dehydrogenation reaction, which has been commercialized by UOP company [7]. However, the propylene selectivity of this catalyst is not as high as desired because of the inevitable side reactions. Additionally, this catalyst is susceptible to deactivation resulted from coke deposition, sintering of supported Pt particles and other factors [8]. Developing novel carrier is one important method to improve the catalytic performances of Pt-based catalysts [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. In recent years, more and more works were concentrated on the supports of catalysts. Redekop et al. [16] prepared a new-type Ga-substituted hydrotalcite (HT) support, and investigated the effects of Pt–Ga alloying on propane dehydrogenation reactions. Siddiqi et al. [17] reported a calcined hydrotalcite-like support (Mg(Ga)(Al)O), and they compared the propane dehydrogenation performances and coking characteristics of Pt catalysts on this carrier with those catalysts using calcined HT (Mg(Al)O) as support. Also, a similar support (Mg(In)(Al)O) was reported [18] to explore effects of In/Pt ratio on the catalytic performance and coking of Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Bocanegra et al. [19] performed a comparative study of the metallic phase of ZnAl2O4 and MgAl2O4 supported bimetallic PtSn catalysts. Subsequently, they further compared the spinel materials with γ-Al2O3 and spheres of α-Al2O3 with a washcoating of γ-Al2O3, and evaluated the behaviors of catalytic stability for different bimetallic catalysts supported on these materials over n-butane dehydrogenation reaction [20]. Furthermore, the influences of different supports (ZSM-5, mesoporous alumina and SBA-15) on the catalytic structures and reaction performances of bimetallic PtSn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation were studied [21], [22].
Recently, zirconia (or zirconia loaded other oxide) supported catalysts were investigated in many reactions and exhibited unique properties [23], [24], [25]. For example, zirconia could decrease the acidity and improve the performance of Pt/CeO2–ZrO2 catalysts for methane dry reforming [26]. Kim et al. prepared highly active and stable Pt catalysts for propane combustion with zirconia-incorporated silica as carrier [27]. Hoang et al. [28] comparatively studied the alumina and zirconia supported Pt and Pt–Sn catalysts. They proposed that the weak-acidic ZrO2 supported catalyst suppressed the formation of coke and inhibited the deactivation of the catalyst for the dehydrogenation reaction of n-octane. Korhonen et al. [29], [30] investigated the effects of zirconia deposition on alumina for chromia catalyst in the dehydrogenation of isobutene, and they found that the chromia/zirconia catalysts had lower coke rate and higher dehydrogenation activity. Souza et al. [31] found that the zirconia-containing Pt catalyst exhibited high catalytic stability and activity due to the formation Pt-Zrn+ interfacial sites for CH4–CO2 reforming reaction, which prevented the sintering and coke formation of Pt/ZrO2 catalyst. Gaspar and Dieguez [32] discussed the effects of support on the distribution of chromium species. They concluded that Cr/ZrO2/Al2O3 catalyst presented high isobutene selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation reaction. Larese et al. [33], [34] showed that the metallic phases of Pt–Sn were well dispersed and more homogeneously distributed on ZrO2-loaded alumina than on the Al2O3-free counterparts.
Our previous study demonstrated that a highly efficient catalytic performance could be acquired over the trimetallic PtSnIn catalysts supported on alumina support (PtSnIn/Al) [22], [35], [36]. There is an interest in comparing zirconia and zirconia-doped alumina supported PtSnIn catalysts with PtSnIn/Al for propane dehydrogenation reaction, and elucidating the role of the support material on catalyst properties. In the present work, the zirconia-loaded alumina was self-synthesized, and then used as support for PtSnIn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction. The activity and behavior of PtSnIn/xZr-Al catalysts were compared with those of both PtSnIn/Al and PtSnIn/Zr. The structure–function relationships of catalysts were analyzed by several state-of-art characterizations including XRD, BET, NH3-TPD, TEM, H2-TPR, C3H6-TPD and XPS techniques.
Experimental
Catalyst preparation
Synthesis of zirconia-loaded alumina support
The zirconia-loaded alumina support (Zr-Al) was synthesized by the co-precipitation method. Firstly, aqueous ammonia solution NH4OH (28%) was added quickly to the determined amounts of Zr(NO3)4 and Al(NO3)3 in aqueous solution. The obtained mixture was continually stirred at 60 °C for 3 h. After that, the precipitation was filtrated and washed, then dried at 120 °C for 10 h and calcined in air at 600 °C for 4 h. Finally, the sample was ground into powder to achieve zirconia-loaded alumina (labeled as xZr-Al), where x represents the mass percentage of ZrO2 in the xZr-Al material. Pure alumina and zirconia were similarly synthesized without the addition of Zr(NO3)4 or Al(NO3)3 species. The pure alumina and zirconia were labeled as Al and Zr supports, respectively. Five catalysts including PtSnIn/Al, PtSnIn/04Zr-Al, PtSnIn/08Zr-Al, PtSnIn/16Zr-Al, PtSnIn/Zr are prepared as listed in Table 1.

Preparation of PtSnIn/xZr-Al catalysts
The PtSnIn/xZr-Al catalysts were prepared by impregnating xZr-Al supports using sequential impregnation method. The xZr-Al supports were firstly co-impregnated by SnCl2 and In(NO3)3 ethanol solutions at room temperature, and then followed by H2PtCl6 solution. After each impregnation step, the samples were dried at 120 °C for 10 h and calcined in air at 550 °C for 4 h. Finally, these samples were ground into powder to achieve the catalysts. The loadings of Pt, Sn and In of all the catalysts were fixed at 0.3, 0.6 and 1.5 wt.%, respectively. All these raw materials were bought from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China).
Catalyst characterizations
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of different catalysts were obtained on a Bragg-Brentano diffractometer (Rigaku D/Max-2000) using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). An angular range 2θ from 10 to 80° was recorded to collect XRD data with a scanning speed of 4°/min. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were obtained on an automatic analyzer (NOVA 4000, Quantachrome, USA) at liquid nitrogen temperature. The TEM images were obtained by a transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM2010). The surface acidity of catalysts was measured by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) on a TP-5080 apparatus. The FESEM images were obtained using an S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, HITACHI S-4800). The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments for different catalysts were implemented using Quantachrome Autosorb-IQ gas adsorption analyzer. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the reduced catalysts were conducted on Perkin-Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA using Al Kα radiation. The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of C3H6 measurements were implemented to determine the interactions between propylene and catalysts. The detailed process of aforementioned measurements can be referred in our previous works [35], [36], [37], [38].
Catalyst evaluation
Propane dehydrogenation was performed in a conventional quartz fix-bed microreactor with a diameter of 8 mm placed in an electrical furnace. The catalyst with a loading of 0.3 g was set into the center of reactor and reduced with H2 at 580 °C for 2.5 h prior to catalytic evaluation. Reaction conditions were conducted as follows: the feed gas including H2, C3H8 and Ar (H2/C3H8/Ar molar ratio = 7:8:35), the propane weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 3.3 h−1, 600 °C for reaction temperature and 0.1 MPa for total pressure. A gas chromatography (GC, SP-6980) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) detector and an AT-PLOT PORA-Q capillary column was employed to analyze the gas compositions of reaction products. The propane conversion and propylene selectivity were calculated as the formulas defined in our previous work [35].
To study the catalyst stability, the PtSnIn/08Zr-Al catalyst was subjected to five propane dehydrogenation reaction steps (2.5 h at 600 °C). After each reaction step, the catalyst was submitted to a regeneration treatment with an air flow (20 ml/min) at 500 °C for 1 h.
Results and discussion
Characterizations of catalysts
X-ray diffraction spectra of catalysts
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of different catalysts. For comparison, the spectra of γ-Al2O3 are also presented. As can be seen, all the samples except for PtSnIn/Zr only show three characteristic diffraction peaks of γ-Al2O3 at ∼37.6°, ∼45.8° and ∼66.8° [39]. Compared to PtSnIn/Al sample, the intensity of typical alumina peaks shows a decrease with the increase of zirconia loading from 4 wt.% to 16 wt.% for PtSnIn/xZr-Al catalysts. The absence of Zr-related crystalline phase suggests that the zirconia may be incorporated in the network of alumina, or zirconia species is highly dispersed on the alumina surface. The similar result was reported by Larese et al. [40] and Gaspar and Dieguez [32] for the cases of La2O3-Al2O3 and ZrO2/Al2O3. The PtSnIn/Zr catalyst only exhibits the typical characteristic peaks of zirconia.

Nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements
The nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms are illustrated in Fig. 2(a), and the textural properties are depicted in Table 1. All the catalysts show type IV isotherms [41], which can be associated with mesoporous materials. As can be noted, the samples with pure Al2O3 or xZr-Al as supports display steep branches, which belong to type H2 hysteresis loop of IUPAC classification [42]. However, the almost horizontal desorption branches can be observed over PtSnIn/Zr catalyst, which can be classified as type H3 hysteresis loop [33]. The BJH pore size distributions of different catalysts are shown in Fig. 2(b). Compared to the catalysts supported on pure Al2O3 and xZr-Al materials, PtSnIn/Zr catalyst exhibits a relatively bigger pore size, which indicates the significant effect of support on the porous structure. As displayed in Table 1, the SBET and VP of PtSnIn/xZr-Al catalysts decrease evidently with the increase of Zr loading, and a marked decline can be noted over the catalyst using pure ZrO2 as support. Moreover, it is worthy of remarking that the PtSnIn/Zr catalyst has the least specific surface area and the largest Dpore due to the structure of zirconia.

Analysis of surface acidity
It has been reported that catalytic dehydrogenation performance is closely correlated to the surface acidity of catalysts [43], [44]. To investigate the influence of different supports on the acidity of catalysts, the NH3-TPD experiments were carried out, and the TPD profiles of four representative samples are presented in Fig. 3. The desorption curves of different samples are deconvoluted into three fitted peaks using Gaussian function. The semi-quantitative results of the acidity strength distribution are summarized in Table 2. For Al, PtSnIn/Al and PtSnIn/08Zr-Al samples, there are three desorption peaks on the NH3-TPD curves. The peaks located at ∼222 °C and ∼270 °C are attributed to weak and medium strength acid sites respectively, and the peaks at high temperature (above 300 °C) should be associated with the desorption of NH3 on strong acid sites. Compared with the pure alumina support (Al), the total acidity and the fraction of strong acid sites evidently decrease after the impregnation of Pt, Sn and In species (PtSnIn/Al). Meanwhile, the fractions of weak and medium strength acid sites increase. A similar phenomenon has been observed by Liu et al. [35]. In contrast to PtSnIn/Al sample, the total acidity and the fraction of strong acid sites further decrease dramatically for the catalyst using xZr-Al as support (PtSnIn/08Zr-Al), while the fraction of weak and medium acid are improved. This suggests that introducing ZrO2 in the support can reduce the total acidity and facilitate the strong acid sites converting into weak and medium strength acid sites. In addition, the NH3-TPD curve of PtSnIn/Zr shows no evident peaks, indicating the negligible acidity on the surface. It is well accepted that the strong acid sites on the surface of catalyst can trigger in side reactions [35], [45], which is adverse to dehydrogenation of propane. Based on these results, it can be concluded that PtSnIn/08Zr-Al sample possesses the moderate acidity among all the PtSnIn catalysts with different supports, which is advantageous to dehydrogenation reaction.

TEM analysis
The TEM images of the reduced representative catalyst samples were conducted and the corresponding Pt particle size distributions are illustrated in Fig. 4. As for the PtSnIn/Al catalyst, the metallic particles exhibit bad distribution with the average Pt particle size of 23 nm (listed in Table 1). In contrast to this, the homogeneous Pt particles with a relatively smaller size of 12 nm are found over the PtSnIn/08Zr-Al catalyst, suggesting that doping suitable amount of Zr into alumina (xZr-Al support) is beneficial to form uniformly distributed Pt particles with small size. In addition, for the PtSnIn/Zr catalyst, Pt species cannot display as isolated Pt particles, but tend to agglomerate on the surface of catalyst with an average particle size of 27 nm. Hoang et al. [28] proposed that Zr species would interact with Pt atoms, leading to a decoration and/or coverage of Pt surfaces by ZrOx (x < 2) suboxide species in Pt/ZrO2 catalyst. Liotta et al. [46] also found the formation of Pt–Zr aggregates in Pt/ZrO2 catalysts. The previous studies revealed that large Pt ensembles could promote the side reactions [9], [47]. Therefore, the xZr-Al supported catalyst (PtSnIn/08Zr-Al) with smaller Pt particles should lead to a relatively high propylene selectivity, which will be further discussed below.

H2-TPR analysis
The reducibility of different catalysts was analyzed by H2-TPR technique, and the corresponding profiles are shown in Fig. 5. The bare zirconia support has two reduction peaks centered at ∼560 °C and ∼660 °C, which can be attributed to the reduction of Zr4+ ions. The PtSnIn/Al and PtSnIn/04Zr-Al catalysts show two reduction peaks centered at ∼368 °C or even lower temperature (peak I) and ∼520 °C or even lower temperature (peak II). Based on the previous works [35], [36], the peak I may be ascribed to the reduction of Pt oxide species, and the peak II may be related to the reduction of Pt species in tighter interaction with the support and/or the joint reduction of Pt, Sn and In. It is worthy noting that, compared to PtSnIn/Al sample, the peaks I and II of PtSnIn/04Zr-Al and PtSnIn/16Zr-Al catalysts shift to lower temperature at 278 °C and 388 °C or even lower temperature, respectively. As regards PtSnIn/Zr catalyst (using pure ZrO2 as support), the two peaks are merged into one with a maximum at ∼236 °C. The reduction peaks of PtSnIn/xZr-Al catalysts shift to lower temperature, which implies that the presence of Zr promotes the reduction of Pt, Sn and In species. As far as PtSnIn/04Zr-Al, PtSnIn/08Zr-Al and PtSnIn/16Zr-Al catalysts concerned, the peak intensity of Pt reduction zone is the strongest when doping 8 wt.% Zr species in Al2O3. This finding indicates that more amounts of Pt particles can be reduced, which should be attributed to the high Pt dispersion (discussed in “Effect of different supports on Pt dispersion” section) [48]. In addition, it can be found that the loadings of Pt, Sn and In species promote the reduction of Zr4+ as comparing the PtSnIn/Zr catalyst with bare zirconia support. Souza et al. [31] proposed that the platinum, once reduced, can dissociate H2 easily, with the formation of active species moving toward the zirconia surface, which helps the reduction of ZrO2. As analyzed in “TEM analysis” section, Zr surface species would interact with Pt atoms, leading to a decoration and/or coverage of Pt surfaces by ZrOx (x < 2) suboxide species, and thus resulting in a lower Pt catalytic activity [31], [49]. Such a decoration of Pt by zirconia support in hydrogen atmosphere is well known as the strong metal support interaction (SMSI) effect, which will suppress the activity of Pt/ZrO2 catalyst [28].

XPS analysis
To investigate the effects of different supports on the chemical state of surface elements, the representative catalysts were examined by XPS. The XPS spectra of Sn3d5/2 and In3d5/2 regions for the catalysts after reduction at 580 °C are shown in Fig. 6, Fig. 7, respectively.

As displayed in Fig. 6, for PtSnIn/Al and PtSnIn/08Zr-Al catalysts, the deconvolution of Sn3d5/2 spectra yields three peaks positioned at ∼485.7, ∼486.6 and ∼487.5 eV, representing the different types of Sn species [35], [36]. However, in the case of PtSnIn/Zr sample, the Sn3d5/2 XPS spectra can be deconvoluted into only two peaks at ∼485.7 and ∼486.6 eV. It is well known that the Sn3d5/2 level at lower binding energy (∼485.7 eV) and higher binding energy (∼486.6 and ∼487.5 eV) correspond to the reduced and oxidized species of Sn respectively [1]. It has been proposed that the close binding energies of Sn2+ and Sn4+ results in differentiating between them arduously [50], [51]. As can be seen from Table 3, the percentage of Sn0 for PtSnIn/Al, PtSnIn/08Zr-Al and PtSnIn/Zr catalysts are 34%, 25% and 47%, respectively. These results indicate that the presence of Zr doped in alumina could stabilize the oxidation state of Sn species; while pure zirconia loading could weaken the interactions between Sn species and support, giving rise to a significant increase in the amount of reduced Sn. This is in good agreement with TPR results.
As shown in Fig. 7, the In3d5/2 XPS spectra of catalysts can be deconvoluted into two peaks at ∼444.2 and ∼445.2 eV, corresponding to the reduced state and the oxidation state of In [52], respectively. It can be seen that the least percentage of In0 (30%) appears for PtSnIn/Al sample. With the loading of zirconia in the support, the percentage of In0 increases and the PtSnIn/Zr catalyst has the highest In0 percentage, which indicates that the introduction of Zr over the trimetallic PtSnIn catalysts may promote the reduction of In species.
Effect of different supports on Pt dispersion
The Pt dispersions (DPt) and particle sizes are included in Table 1. It is found that the PtSnIn/08Zr-Al sample possesses the highest Pt metal dispersion (9.3%), suggesting diffusion and dispersion of Pt using xZr-Al as support. In contrast, the lowest value of metal dispersion (4.1%) is found over bare ZrO2 supported catalyst (PtSnIn/Zr). Obviously, pure zirconia support exhibits an adverse influence for Pt dispersion.
Catalytic performances
Effect of different supports
Fig. 8(a) displays the propane conversion and the propylene selectivity over PtSnIn trimetallic catalysts with different supports. As can be seen from Fig. 8(a), the PtSnIn/Zr catalyst exhibits the lowest reaction activity and propylene selectivity. The initial propane conversion is 22.4%, and then decreases to 15.0% after 2.5 h reaction for PtSnIn/Zr. Compared to PtSnIn/Zr catalyst, the PtSnIn/Al catalyst shows much higher propane conversion, which changes from the initial propane conversion of 47.4% to the final value of 36.4% after 2.5 h propane dehydrogenation reaction. The highest activity and selectivity is found over PtSnIn/08Zr-Al catalyst, which exhibits the initial and final propane conversions of 57.7% and 51.7% accompanied with the propylene selectivity of above 98.0%. Especially for PtSnIn/08Zr-Al catalyst, the propane conversion has the minimum decline (6.0%) in 2.5 h propane dehydrogenation reaction, which is lower than those of PtSnIn/Al (11.0%) and PtSnIn/Zr (7.4%). The turnover frequency (TOF) values of the catalyts are calculated upon the exposed Pt atoms and presented in Table 1. It can be observed that the TOF values (5 min) for PtSnIn/Al and PtSnIn/08Zr-Al catalysts are higher than that of PtnIn/Zr sample. This result indicates that the catalyst displays the low efficiency of Pt when using pure zirconia as support [53]. On the basis of aforementioned results, it can be concluded that the difference of supports markedly influence the catalytic performances of PtSnIn trimetallic catalysts.

Fig. 8. (a) Effects of different supports and zirconia contents on the performances of PtSnIn/xZr-Al catalysts in propane dehydrogenation (reaction conditions: T = 600 °C; H2:C3H8:Ar (molar ratio) = 7:8:35; WHSV = 3.3 h−1; mcat. = 0.3 g).
It has been proposed that the metal sites and acid sites work collaboratively to the catalytic performances of Pt-based catalysts [54], [55]. As analyzed from the NH3-TPD profiles, the negligible acidity of pure ZrO2 supported catalysts is disadvantageous to propane dehydrogenation reaction, triggering the inevitable lowest catalytic activity. In contrast, the moderate acidity with the highest percentage of weak and medium acid sites can be observed over xZr-Al supported catalyst. In this case, the optimal matching may exist, which is favorable to propane dehydrogenation, in line with the best catalytic performances over PtSnIn/08Zr-Al sample. As regards BET investigation, the specific surface area of the PtSnIn/Zr catalyst is obviously much lower than other samples, which can be also an important reason for the lowest catalytic activity. Moreover, as discussed in the TEM, when the support is xZr-Al, the homogeneous Pt particles with the smallest size and highest Pt dispersion can be obtained. With respect to the TPR experiment, it is verified that xZr-Al support can promote the reduction of Pt species, while coverage of Pt surfaces by ZrOx will take place when pure ZrO2 is employed as support. Besides, the XPS results reveal that the presence of Zr doped in alumina could stabilize the oxidation state of Sn species, strengthening the interactions between Sn and support, which could effectively maintain the catalytic stability.
To further explore the diversities of reaction selectivity, the interaction of propylene with the catalysts was examined by means of C3H6-TPD, and the corresponding desorption curves are depicted in Fig. 9. It has been reported that the desorption temperature can reflect the extent of interaction between propylene and the catalysts [45], [56]. As can be observed from Fig. 9, after doping ZrO2 on the support, the desorption peak from 85 °C for PtSnIn/Al sample shifts to 65 °C for PtSnIn/8Zr-Al. However, an opposite phenomenon can be noted that the desorption peak shifts to higher temperature (98 °C) for PtSnIn/Zr with pure ZrO2 as support. These results suggest that xZr-Al support weakens the adsorption of propylene compared to the other two supports, thus prevents propylene from converting into higher-order dehydrogenation products [56], and gives rise to the highest selectivity of propylene over PtSnIn/08Zr-Al catalyst.

Effect of zirconia content
The propane conversion and propylene selectivity over PtSnIn/xZr-Al catalysts with various zirconia contents are presented in Fig. 8(b). As can be seen, compared with PtSnIn/Al catalyst (shown in Fig. 8(a)), the catalytic activity and stability are evidently enhanced after doping 4 wt.% Zr species. The initial propane conversion for PtSnIn/04Zr-Al catalyst is 54.8%, and decreases to 47.7% after 2.5 h reaction. Over PtSnIn/08Zr-Al sample, both the initial and final propane conversions (described in section “Effect of different supports”) reach the maximum. However, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity notably decrease as Zr loading further increases. The initial propane conversion decreases to 51.3%, and the final value only has 45.8% for PtSnIn/16Zr-Al catalyst after 2.5 h reaction. From Fig. 8(b), it is obviously seen that the propylene selectivities for the three catalysts (PtSnIn/04Zr-Al, PtSnIn/08Zr-Al and PtSnIn/16Zr-Al) are all above 97% and vary little in the 2.5 h reaction period.
Regeneration test
Fig. 10 shows the propane dehydrogenation recycle of PtSnIn/08Zr-Al catalyst. It can be seen that the catalytic performances of PtSnIn/08Zr-Al catalyst are well maintained even after five reaction–regeneration cycles. The initial propane conversions in five cycles are all above 55.0% and only decreases ∼3% in the 5th cycle. The propylene selectivity in the five cycles remains ∼98% and decreases little during the reaction period. The results indicate that the catalytic activity of PtSnIn/08Zr-Al catalyst can be well recovered after regeneration.

Comparison with the published catalysts
The recent reports about the catalytic properties of Pt-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction are compared in Table 4. As can be seen, the initial and final (for 2 h reaction) propane conversions and propylene selectivities, the reaction conditions and Pt contents are collected. Clearly, the PtSnIn/08Zr-Al catalyst in this work exhibits the best catalytic activity and stability regardless of the variation of reaction conditions, suggesting that ZrO2-doped Al2O3 material may be more promising compared to other materials. On the basis of these results, it can be speculated that ZrO2-doped Al2O3 material used as support will have a broad prospect in propane dehydrogenation process.

The model diagram for PtSnIn/xZr-Al catalysts
A model for catalyst formation mechanism is proposed in Fig. 11, which can reasonably explain the structure-activity of catalyst. It is reported that for γ-Al2O3 support, there exist some potential Lewis acid sites and these acid sites are also bonding sites of Pt on Al2O3 since their strong interactions with atomic Pt or Pt oxide phases [61]. As analyzed from NH3-TPD results in Fig. 3 and Table 2, ZrO2 possess negligible acidity. Introducing ZrO2 to Al2O3 support reduces the total acidity and converts the strong acid sites into weak and medium strength acid sites. For pure Al2O3 support, the strong acid sites adsorb more active metal species, and lead to agglomeration and formation of large metal particles, which is verified by TEM images in Fig. 4. After loading suitable ZrO2 content, each acidic cite on catalyst surface with decreased acidity adsorb less the active metal species, and lead to small and uniform Pt particles, which is corresponding to the TEM result in Fig. 4. Due to the neutralization effects of Zr, Al–Zr support with less binding strength with metal species and promote the reduction of Pt, Sn and In species, which is proved by the shift to low temperature of TPR-H2 in Fig. 5. For pure ZrO2 support, the reduction further shifts to ∼236 °C for PtSnIn/Zr catalyst. Also, the easy reduction properties of PtSnIn/Zr catalyst lead to the higher proportion of reduced Sn(0) and In(0), which will format alloy with Pt species. It is corresponding to the XPS results in Figs. 6–7 and Table 3, and this may be another reason for the low activity of PtSnIn/Zr catalyst.

Conclusions
In this study, the influences of different supports (alumina, zirconia-loaded alumina and zirconia) on the structure and catalytic performances of trimetallic PtSnIn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation are investigated. The XRD, BET and FESEM measurements show that the textural characteristics, surface acidity and distribution of the catalysts vary with different supports. Furthermore, it is verified by H2-TPR that the loading of zirconia evidently affects the reduction properties of the metallic species, the interfacial interactions between metallic phase and support, Pt dispersion, Pt metal particle size.
The best behavior in activity, selectivity and stability is achieved by trimetallic PtSnIn catalysts supported on ZrO2-doped Al2O3 material. It could keep the initial propane conversion and propylene selectivity above 55.0% and 98% for PtSnIn/08Zr-Al catalyst respectively, which are evidently superior to the recent published works. In addition, after five reaction–regeneration cycles, the PtSnIn/08Zr-Al catalyst still exhibits high catalytic performances. The initial propane conversions in four recycles are all above 55.0% and only decrease little (∼3%) in the 5th cycle.
