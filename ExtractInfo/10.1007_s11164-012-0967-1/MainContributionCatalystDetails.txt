 Unfortunately, the multiple extractions do not contain enough details to provide a comprehensive summary. The documents only mention general gas-phase pyrolysis of propane without any specifics on catalysts, performance enhancements, or other relevant details for propane dehydrogenation. Since no catalyst or process information is provided, I am unable to synthesize a meaningful output based on the template. The documents are not relevant for the requested propane dehydrogenation summary.
