Abstract
VOX-doped porous SiO2 solids (VOX-SiO2) were synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures through an in-situ one-step synthesis and evaluated by non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH), exhibiting excellent catalytic performance. VOX-SiO2 catalysts were characterized by XRD, low-temperature N2 adsorption/desorption, SEM, TEM, UV–Vis, Raman, XPS, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, and TGA. The structural and performance results for the catalysts reveal that gelation temperature has only a slight effect on the surface acidity, textural properties and VOX species dispersion of VOX-SiO2 catalysts within a reasonable temperature range (30–60 °C). The 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, with a gelation temperature of 60 °C, a calcination temperature of 580 °C, and prepared by the one-step synthesis method, obviously shortens gelation process time by half compared to catalyst gelled at 30 °C and exhibits superior catalytic performance for PDH. Over high gelation temperature (≥75 °C) leads to the loss of integrity and decreases catalytic activity of the VOX-SiO2 catalysts. Compared with the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst prepared by a one-step hydrothermal method, VOX-SiO2 catalysts exhibit better catalytic activity and stability. Importantly, at a reaction temperature of 580 °C, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits remarkable long-term catalytic stability in the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% for a 4 h reaction duration, but the propene selectivity remains at approximately 91%. The results of this work will be beneficial for further industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis.

1. Introduction
Lower olefins are essential petrochemical intermediates, especially propene, which is widely used as a feedstock in the production of a variety of chemicals. Propene is mainly produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [1], [2], [3], [4]. Besides these two approaches, catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) is an attractive alternative with the rapidly growing demand for propene and its derivatives [5], [6], [7], [8]. DH processes can be classified into non-oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Although the latter (ODHP) has many advantages, such as avoiding thermodynamic equilibrium limitations and decreasing carbon deposition, the ODHP process unavoidably generates by-products due to deep oxidation of propene [9], [10]. Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been realized in commercial applications, where Pt- and Cr-based catalysts are frequently used [11], [12]. Given the price and deactivation disadvantages of both catalysts, especially the pollution problem associated with CrOX species, current research tends to investigate novel catalysts for DH, such as V-, Ga-, and Sn-based catalysts [13], [14], [15].
V-based catalysts, which are one of the potential alternatives to Pt- and Cr-based catalysts for commercial PDH [16], are reasonably priced and environmentally friendly. In previous studies, these catalysts have been used mainly in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Moreover, catalyst performance was strongly affected when different supports, such as SiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3, were used [23], [24]. To the authors’ knowledge, the use of Al2O3 and MCM-41 supports have been reported for V-based catalysts, which exhibit attractive catalytic properties for PDH [25], [23], [26], [27], [28]. Bai et al. investigated the catalytic performance and surface chemistry of mesoporous γ-Al2O3 supported V-based catalysts, where the catalysts achieved high catalytic activity and superior stability [27]. Sokolov et al. systematically studied coke formation and catalyst stability for VOX/MCM-41, VOX/SiO2-Al2O3, and VOX/Al2O3 catalysts on PDH. By comparing the regeneration performance of V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts, they found that the catalytic properties of the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst were stable for PDH in the absence of gas-phase O2 and could be fully recovered with oxidative regeneration. This full recovery was attributed to the high stability of VOX species [25], [23], [26]. Rodemerck et al. also reported a relationship between catalyst deactivation and the VOX species in the VOX/MCM-41 catalyst, where the catalyst shows superior catalytic properties for PDH [28]. Hence, it can be concluded that V-based catalysts could be a suitable candidate for a commercial PDH process.
A mesoporous silica monolith has been reported and possesses superior textural properties, but needs a lengthy gelation period at room temperature (at least six weeks) [29], [30]. Fortunately, Yang et al. shortened the solvent evaporation process by using a liquid-paraffin medium to seal the ethanol solution, meaning that the prepared silica monolith can exactly copy the shape of the reactor [31]. They also proposed a one-step method to synthesize silica monoliths by doping various nanocrystals and found that the prepared materials had potential catalytic applications, but that vanadium species were not included [32].
Taking inspiration from the preparation and applications of mesoporous silica monoliths, the authors have prepared vanadium-doped porous silica solids (VOX-SiO2) by a one-step synthesis in this study. The preparation method is environmentally-friendly, without loss of the VOX precursor. The influence of gelation and calcination temperatures on the properties and catalytic performance of VOX-SiO2 catalysts for PDH reaction was studied in detail. The prepared VOX-SiO2 catalysts were characterized using a variety of state-of-the-art techniques and evaluated by a non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of porous VOX-SiO2 solids
Porous VOX-SiO2 solids were prepared by an in-situ one-step synthesis [32]. Catalyst preparation was performed as follows. NH4VO3 (0.14 g, 99.95%, Aladdin) was dissolved in ethanol (10.00 g, Shanghai Chemical Agent Co. Ltd (China)) under mechanical stirring. Subsequently, anhydrous oxalic acid (0.14 g, 98%, Aladdin) was added to promote dissolution of NH4VO3, and the mixed solutions were stirred for 30 min at 40 °C. When the mixture was cooled to room temperature, 2.00 g of triblock copolymers P123 (EO20PO70EO20, average Mn = 5800, Aladdin) was added and stirred until well mixed; 4.32 g of TEOS (tetraethoxysilane, 99.99%, Aladdin) and 0.40 g of aqueous HCl solution (0.8 M, Shanghai Chemical Agent Co. Ltd (China)) were slowly dripped into the mixture and stirred to dissolve them completely. Then the pellucid solution was poured into a porcelain crucible and heated under different temperatures (30 °C, 45 °C, 60 °C, 75 °C, and 90 °C) to form a silica gel. The prepared gel was sealed by a liquid-paraffin medium (Aladdin) and heated at 60 °C for 18 h to remove most of the ethanol and to form a rigid silica solid. Afterwards, the liquid-paraffin was captured on filter paper and collected for reuse. Finally, the obtained materials were calcined at 580 °C for 6 h under air atmosphere to remove P123 from the silica solids. The resulting catalysts of porous VOX-SiO2 solids (VOX-SiO2) with different gelation temperatures (recorded as GT-VOX-SiO2-580) denoted as 30-VOX-SiO2-580, 45-VOX-SiO2-580, 60-VOX-SiO2-580, 75-VOX-SiO2-580, and 90-VOX-SiO2-580, respectively, where the content of doping V is 5 wt%. Before the catalytic test, the catalysts were crushed and then tested in powder form due to the limits of the actual PDH reactor (8 mm inner diameter). As gelation temperature increased, the gelation process time gradually became shorter, as shown in Fig. 1. By the same preparation process, pure silica solid (SiO2) was synthesized at a gelation temperature of 30 °C and a calcination temperature of 580 °C. In addition, the catalysts with a gelation temperature of 60 °C were calcined at temperatures (recorded as 60-VOX-SiO2-CT) of 550 °C, 580 °C, 620 °C, and 650 °C. These catalysts were denoted as 60-VOX-SiO2-550, 60-VOX-SiO2-580, 60-VOX-SiO2-620, and 60-VOX-SiO2-650, respectively.

For comparison, VOX-MCM-41 was also synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal method. A certain amount of NH4VO3 was dissolved in deionized water (10.0 g) under mechanical stirring to dissolve it completely. CTAB (1.7 g) and NaOH (0.27 g) were dissolved in deionized water (100.0 g) as a template solution. The NH4VO3 solution was added to the template solution under mechanical stirring for 30 min. Then TEOS (10.5 g) was added dropwise to the mixed solution under stirring at 60 °C for 4 h. The synthesized gel was cooled overnight. Afterwards, it was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave and aged at 120 °C for 48 h. The obtained materials were washed five times with deionized water (750 ml) and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Finally, it was calcined at 550 °C for 4 h to form a V-MCM-41 sample, where the content of V is 5 wt% according to the ICP result.
2.2. Characterizations
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was collected on a Bragg-Brentano diffractometer (monochromatic Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5418 Å). The catalysts were scanned from 10° to 70° (2θ value) using a scan speed of 5°/min at 40 kV and 30 mA. The vanadium and silicon contents of the catalysts were obtained with inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) with Varian Vista MPX. Low-temperature N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured using a NOVA4000 analyzer (Quantachrome, USA) at 77 K. Before analysis, the catalysts were degassed under vacuum at 300 °C for 4 h. The multipoint BET method was utilized to calculate the surface areas. The pore volumes of the catalysts were obtained at the maximum relative pressure (P/P0). The pore size distributions of the catalysts were derived from the desorption branch of the isotherms using the BJH model. For micropore analysis, the pore volume and pore diameter of catalysts were measured by DFT method and V-t method (t-plot Method Micropore Analysis). Morphological properties of the catalysts were determined using an S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) at 5.0 kV. XPS spectra were performed on a Perkin-Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA using an Al Kα source. The binding energy (BE) was detected with the C1s level at 284.9 eV as a reference. Raman spectra were collected using a Jobin Yvon confocal laser Raman spectrometer (SuperLabRam II) with a 632.8 nm He–Ne ion laser beam. Before measurements, the catalysts were dried at 100 °C for 5 h. The spectra were acquired within 20 s by three accumulations. H2-TPR experiments were carried using an autosorb-iQ Instruments with a thermal conduction detector (TCD) (Quantachrome, USA). The powered catalysts (60 mg) were added to a U-shape quartz tube reactor and supported with quartz wool. Prior to measurements, the catalysts were treated with an Ar flow (15 ml/min) at 500 °C for 1 h. Then the catalysts were reduced under a mixture gas of 10% H2 and 90% (v/v) Ar from room temperature to 800 °C (10 °C/min). NH3-TPD investigations were carried out on a TP-5080 adsorption instrument to evaluate surface acidity. Before NH3-TPD analysis, catalysts (0.1 g) were pretreated for 1 h at 400 °C with a 30 ml/min of He flow. When cooling to 120 °C, high purified NH3 (20 ml/min, 99.9999%) was adsorbed and saturated over all the acid sites for 30 min. Afterwards, the catalysts were blown for another 45 min to remove the physical absorption of NH3. During desorption, the analysis was performed from 120 to 600 °C (10 °C/min). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the spent catalysts was performed with a DTG-60H analyzer (Shimadzu, Japan) in an air atmosphere to evaluate coke deposition. The measurement was carried out from 50 °C to 800 °C (10 °C/min) in a ceramic crucible as a reference.
2.3. Catalytic tests of PDH
Catalytic tests of non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) were carried out with a continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactor under atmospheric pressure. Catalysts in powder form (0.3 g, average particle size: around 0.25 mm) were filled into the center of the reactor and supported with fluffy quartz wool. An axially movable thermocouple was placed into a quartz capillary to measure the reaction temperature. After filling catalyst, the reactor was heated to 580 °C (10 °C/min) under an Ar flow of 15 ml/min. Then, a mixture of propane/Ar with a volume ratio of 1:10 was fed to the reactor with a flow rate of 16.5 ml/min at STP (4.05 × 10−3 mol/h, 3300 cm3 g−1 cat h−1). Products of PDH were analyzed using a gas chromatography (GC, SP-6980) equipped with a FID chromatographic detector. The conversion of propane and selectivity of propene were calculated with a carbon atom balance method by the following formulas as:
(1)
(2)
(3)
where C3H8in and C3H8out were related to the feed and product flows of propane respectively; C3H6out was the product flow of propene.
The turnover frequency (TOF, s−1) value per V species was calculated as:
(4)
where nA0 is the molar flow rate of propane feed (mol/s), XA is the conversion of propane per gram of sample and nV is the moles of V per gram of sample.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic performances of catalysts in PDH
Fig. 2 shows the catalytic performance of VOX-SiO2 catalysts calcined at 580 °C with different gelation temperatures. The propane conversion and propene yield slowly decrease with reaction time for all catalysts during a 6 h reaction duration. The decrease in catalytic activity could be explained by the formation of coke, which covers part of the active sites of VOX species during the DH reaction [33], [34]. The propane selectivity maintains a relatively stable value, but shows a slight increase at higher gelation temperatures, which is the opposite of the variation in propane conversion. The results demonstrate that lower propane conversion of the catalyst results in low propene partial pressure and consequently lower reaction rates in the cracking and coke reactions. Among these catalysts, the highest initial propane conversion (65%) was obtained from the 30-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, whereas the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst shows the poorest catalytic properties. The propane conversion of pure SiO2 material is about 5% (Fig. S-1). More specifically, VOX-SiO2 catalysts prepared at gelation temperatures below 60 °C exhibit superior catalytic performance in terms of propane conversion, propene selectivity, and propene yield. The propene yield decreases slightly with increasing gelation temperature, but a similar yield is achieved after 4 h reaction. This phenomenon can also be observed in the TOF values of catalysts with different gelation temperatures in Table 1. When the catalyst is prepared above 60 °C gelation temperature, the catalytic performance obviously decreases, especially in the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst. As a result, the catalyst gelled at 60 °C shortens the gelation process time by half compared to the catalyst gelled at 30 °C (Fig. 1), but both achieve similar catalytic yields after 4 h reaction. In addition, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits a lower deactivation rate, in agreement with the variation in TOF values (Table 1), where propane conversion and propene yield show a 15% decline during a 6 h reaction.

Compared with the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst obtained by a one-step hydrothermal method, VOX-SiO2 catalysts synthesized by the in-situ one-step method show markedly superior catalytic performance, except for the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst. VOX-MCM-41 achieved 40% initial propane conversion and 79% propene selectivity, as shown in Fig. 2. The propane conversion of VOX-MCM-41 drops to 17% after 6 h reaction. Note that the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst shows higher initial propane conversion, propene selectivity, and catalytic stability than the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst. Xue et al. also reported the non-oxidation propane dehydrogenation of the 5.2 V-MSNSs catalyst, which obtained 46% initial propane conversion and 80% propene selectivity [35]. Apparently, VOX-SiO2 catalysts prepared at a gelation temperature of 60 °C exhibit excellent catalytic activity and stability for PDH, which is beneficial for large-scale industrial experimentation with PDH.
In addition to gelation temperature, calcination temperature is another crucial factor for synthesizing VOX-SiO2 catalysts and plays an essential role in the structure and properties of these catalysts [36]. The catalyst gelled at 60 °C was selected as a representative sample to investigate the influence of calcination temperature on catalyst structure and properties. Fig. 3 shows the propane conversion and propene selectivity of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with a gelation temperature of 60 °C at different calcination temperatures. As calcination temperature increases, propane conversion gradually decreases, but propene selectivity slightly increases. The variation trends of propane conversion and propene selectivity are similar to those found in other studies [37]. Although the catalyst calcined at 550 °C has better initial catalytic activity for PDH, the VOX-SiO2 catalyst calcined at 580 °C exhibits superior stability and shows higher propane conversion after 3 h reaction. The TOF values of catalysts with different calcination temperatures also indicate this phenomenon (Table 1). The result may be related to the actual reaction temperature of 580 °C, where the similar calcination temperature makes the catalyst structure more stable. It is noted that the TOF values and propene selectivity of the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalysts are higher than other V-Si materials under similar reaction conditions (Table 1). The catalysts show superior catalytic activity and stability for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) in this work. The carbon balance is calibrated with TGA measurement and elemental analysis, which is provided in Table S-1. It can be seen that the carbon balance calibration is higher than 98% in this work. The TGA experiments of V-SiO2 catalysts (coke deposition) have been also carried out and the results are presented in Fig. S-2. These results indicate that the mass balance is well-matched.

3.2. Textural properties
Table 2 summarizes the pore size, pore volume, and specific surface area of the VOX-SiO2 catalysts, SiO2 solid, and VOX-MCM-41. Fig. S-3 shows the N2 adsorption/desorption curves of VOX-SiO2-580 catalysts with different gelation temperatures. It shows the type-IV sorption isotherms with an H-2 hysteresis loop characteristic of typical inkbottle mesopores for SiO2 solid and VOX-SiO2 catalysts. As gelation temperature increases, the pore volume and surface area of catalysts decrease, whereas the pore size shows no obvious variation except for the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst. The surface area of SiO2 solid is smaller than that of the corresponding 30-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, but the pore size has increased, implying that the doped VOX species influence the structure of the SiO2 solid. Yang et al. also proposed a similar textural variation in SnO2/SiO2 catalyst [32]. When the gelation temperature further increases to 90 °C, the catalyst follows a hysteresis loop at high relative pressure, and the pore size becomes larger, but the pore volume and surface area are reasonably decreased, which could occur because the relatively small channels are blocked by aggregated VOX species [27]. Fig. 4 shows photographs of VOX-SiO2 solids with different gelation temperatures before and after calcination. At a gelation temperature of 90 °C, it is obvious that the integrity of the VOX-SiO2 catalyst has been destroyed, which may be attributed to quick loss of ethanol solvent. Fig. S-4 shows the external profiles of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with different gelation temperatures. The surface of the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst is smooth and dense, whereas the surface of the catalyst gelled at 75 °C is starting to become rough, and small splits have appeared on the surface. When the gelation temperature increases to 90 °C, the surface of the catalyst becomes uneven, and some visible small pores (<1 μm) occur on the surface. The result also demonstrates that VOX-SiO2 catalysts show poor textural properties at over-high gelation temperatures, which is a significant factor in explaining why the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst has the poorest catalytic performance. Besides, the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst exhibits a type-IV sorption isotherm with an H-1 hysteresis loop in Fig. S-3 and shows larger pore volume and surface area, although its pore size is relatively smaller than that of VOX-SiO2 catalysts. The difference in textural properties of the catalysts can partially account for the variations in catalytic performance.

The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms of 60-VOX-SiO2 catalysts with different calcination temperatures vary obviously with increasing temperature and are shown in Fig. S-5. When the calcination temperature is 580 °C, the pore volume and surface area of the catalyst (60-VOX-SiO2-580) decrease slightly compared to the catalyst at 550 °C, as shown in Table 2. The result may provide a reasonable explanation for the similar catalytic behavior of the catalysts calcined at 550 °C and 580 °C. However, 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst exhibits relatively better stability at 580 °C reaction temperature for PDH, which can be attributed to the more stable structure of the catalyst calcined at the same temperature. When the calcination temperature increases to 620 °C, the textural properties of catalyst in terms of pore size, pore volume, and surface area are poor (Table 2), and the catalyst starts to present a microporous instead of a mesoporous structure.
3.3. Raman analysis
Fig. 5A presents Raman spectra of VOX-SiO2-580 catalysts, which show obvious differences with increasing gelation temperature (from 30 °C to 90 °C), implying that gelation temperature has a significant influence on the distribution of VOX species. The XRD patterns of the catalysts in Fig. S-6 show no obvious differences. Raman signals at around 431, 489, and 607 cm−1 appear in the SiO2 solid; the first two are attributed to amorphous SiO2, and the last is related to symmetric SiOSi stretching vibration [38]. Besides these similar signals, the 30-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst shows additional Raman bands at 911 and 1025 cm−1 corresponding to VOSi bond vibration and the stretching vibration of vanadyl (OV) groups of surface VOX species respectively [39], [40], [41], [42]. In particular, the characteristic band at around 1025 cm−1 demonstrates the presence of isolated VOX species with tetrahedral coordination in all VOX-SiO2 catalysts. The result demonstrates that vanadium oxide is highly dispersed in VOX-SiO2 catalysts. Moreover, the signals at around 271 and 702 cm−1 may be ascribed to the VOV bending mode and VOV stretching vibrations, respectively [43], [44]. With increasing gelation temperature in the range of 30–75 °C, the intensity of Raman bands at 271, 431, 489, and 702 cm−1 has a slight increasing trend, but the intensity at around 911 cm−1 shows an non-obvious decrease, which may be related to the gradual aggregation of VOX species on the surfaces of VOX-SiO2 catalysts [35]. When the gelation temperature increases to 90 °C, the bands at 271 and 702 cm−1 show relatively higher intensity, and a characteristic peak at 995 cm−1 appears, indicating that crystalline V2O5 is present in the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst [39], [45]. The results imply that VOX-SiO2 catalysts should be gelled below 75 °C to give VOX species better dispersion in SiO2 solid surfaces. Besides, the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst has an additional Raman band at 840 cm−1, which may be ascribed to the SiOH stretching vibrations of surface hydroxyl groups [35]. The absence of a characteristic peak at 995 cm−1 implies that VOX crystallites are not formed in the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst, whereas the weak band at 911 cm−1 indicates a weak interaction between VOX species and MCM-41, which may indicate high VOX species coverage on the catalyst surface [46]. Fig. 5B shows the Raman spectra of 60-VOX-SiO2 catalysts at different calcination temperatures. When the calcination temperature increases to 650 °C, the characteristic peak of crystalline V2O5 at 995 cm−1 appears, indicating that over-high calcination temperature will cause the aggregation of more VOX species and even the formation of V2O5 crystallites.

To reveal more completely the chemical states of VOX species, XPS analysis was undertaken; the results are shown in Fig. 6. As shown in the spectra, the peak of V2p3/2 can be deconvoluted into two peaks at around 517.6 and 516.6 eV, which can be ascribed to V5+ and V4+ species respectively [47]. Table 3 presents the V2p3/2 of VOX-SiO2 catalysts, including peak area fractions and the surface atomic ratio Si/V. As listed in Table 3, the calculated Si/V molar ratios of catalysts with different gelation temperatures show no evident variation with increasing gelation temperature, but the ratio by XPS is much larger than by ICP (approximately 16%, from Table 3), suggesting that VOX species are mostly dispersed into the channels of the SiO2 solids. The XPS analysis also reveals a relationship between the gelation temperature and the state of surface VOX species. With increasing gelation temperature, V5+ species on the catalyst surface increase, but V4+ species decrease, suggesting a slight increase in the polymerization degree of VOX species [48], [49]. It is apparent that V4+ species have decreased greatly in the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, which may be attributed to the agglomeration of partial VOX species according to Raman results. Because the gelation temperature at 75 °C is close to the boiling point of ethanol (78.3 °C). When approaching or exceeding this temperature, the structure of VOX-SiO2 solids and dispersion of VOX species can be seriously influenced, according to the analysis of textural properties and XPS results. This analysis can explain the performance of VOX-SiO2 catalysts with different gelation temperatures.

Fig. 6B shows the XPS spectra of 60-VOX-SiO2 catalysts with different calcination temperatures. The calculated Si/V molar ratio (Table 3) evidently decreases with increasing calcination temperature, indicating that the relative content of surface VOX species in the catalysts shows an increasing trend with increasing calcination temperature. However, the V4+ species of the catalyst shows only slight variation between the 60-VOX-SiO2-550 and 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalysts, suggesting that the dispersion of VOX species is not obviously different. When the calcination temperature increases to 650 °C, the V4+ species show an obvious decrease, indicating an increase in the aggregation degree of VOX species, in agreement with the Raman results. Variations in textural properties and the dispersion of VOX species are crucial factors in catalytic performance. Other factors, such as catalyst acidity, also play an important role in affecting catalytic behavior and are discussed below.
3.5. NH3-TPD analysis
The surface acidic property of VOX-SiO2 catalysts plays a crucial role in the dehydrogenation behavior of propane and is detected by NH3-TPD analysis. Fig. S-7 shows the NH3-TPD profiles of VOX-SiO2-580 catalysts with different gelation temperatures. All the catalysts show a desorption peak at around 160–190 °C, which can be ascribed to weak acid sites and the presence of monomeric and low-polymerized VOX species with tetrahedral coordination. The desorption peak in the 200–260 °C range is ascribed to medium acid sites, and other desorption peaks (>260 °C) are attributed to strong acid sites [35], [50]. Table 4 shows a semi-quantitative analysis of NH3-TPD measurements of VOX-SiO2 catalysts using the Gaussian deconvolution method. As gelation temperature increases, the peak centers of weak and medium acid sites shift to higher temperatures. The intensity and total number of acid sites (indicated by total peak area) obviously increase with increasing gelation temperature except for the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst. This may be due to the increase in polymerization degree of VOX species based on the earlier analysis [28], [51]. When the gelation temperature increases to 75 °C, the peak intensity of weak acid sites shows an obvious decrease, and consequently the peak intensity of strong acid sites shows a sudden increase, which may be due to the formation of polymeric or high-polymeric VOX species. This result can reasonably explain the decrease in propane conversion with the 75-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst. In addition, for the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, the center of the weak-acid site peak occurs at a higher temperature, and the total number of acid sites markedly decreases, although the peak intensity of weak acid sites is similar to that of the catalyst that gelled at 75 °C. This result is evident from the existence of crystalline V2O5 at high gelation temperature based on the Raman results, which can partially explain why the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst has the poorest catalytic behavior for PDH. However, the VOX-MCM-41 catalyst has less total surface acidity and a higher peak intensity for medium and strong acid sites than the VOX-SiO2 catalysts, which may be one of the reasons for its low catalytic performance, especially the propene selectivity.

Fig. S-8 shows the NH3-TPD profiles of 60-VOX-SiO2 catalysts with different calcination temperatures. As calcination temperature increases, the weak-acid site peak shifts to a higher temperature, the peak intensity of medium acid sites obviously decreases, and total surface acidity gradually decreases, indicating an increase in the polymerization degree of VOX species. This can explain the variation in catalyst performance with different calcination temperatures. However, the catalysts calcined at 550 °C and 580 °C have similar total surface acidity and only a slight variation in weak acid sites. This implies that they change only slightly with regard to the dispersion of VOX species, which is in agreement with XPS results.
3.6. TPR analysis
Fig. 7A shows the H2-TPR patterns of VOX-SiO2-580 catalysts with different gelation temperatures to reveal the reducibility of VOX species [50], [52]. The VOX-SiO2 catalysts show a reduction peak in the 527–538 °C range at gelation temperatures below 75 °C, which can be ascribed to the reduction of monomeric or low-polymerized VOX species with tetrahedral coordination [53]. In addition, the peak position shifts slightly to a higher temperature as gelation temperature increases (≤60 °C), which indicates a slight increase in the polymerization degree of VOX species with increasing gelation temperature and seems to be consistent with the Raman and NH3-TPD results. When the gelation temperature increases to 75 °C, the intensity of the reduction peaks obviously decreases, which can be due to polymeric or high-polymeric VOX species [53]. As the temperature further increases to 90 °C, the catalyst structure is destroyed, and crystalline V2O5 is observed. Therefore, the reduction peak position of the 90-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst shifts to a higher temperature, and double peaks start to appear, indicating the presence of V2O5 crystallites, which will retard reduction [54]. By combining the Raman, XPS, NH3-TPD, and TPR analyses, it can be readily concluded that the VOX-SiO2 catalyst gelation process may have a proportional gelation-temperature tipping point. Hence, the structural and catalytic properties of catalysts may show an obvious change after the tipping point; this point may be at approximately 60 °C based on catalytic performance for PDH.

Fig. 7B shows the H2-TPR patterns of VOX species of 60-VOX-SiO2 catalysts calcinated at different temperatures. A higher calcination temperature induces a higher polymerization degree of VOX species, leading to a shift in the reduction peaks. Note that the catalysts calcined at 550 °C and 580 °C exhibit similar reduction peaks, which is consistent with the Raman and XPS results. Therefore, they exhibit similar catalytic activity in terms of high propane conversion. However, the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst shows higher propene selectivity (Fig. 3) due to its higher calcination temperature, which leads to a more stable catalyst structure.
3.7. Regeneration behavior
Given the catalytic activity and stability of the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst, this catalyst has been selected for further study of the long-term stability of dehydrogenation-regeneration (DH) cycles for PDH. As shown in Fig. 8, propane conversion gradually decreases to around 45% after the first 4 h period, which can possibly be attributed to deactivation of VOX species by carbon deposition [27]. The propene selectivity remains constant at ∼91% in the first DH cycle. Moreover, after regeneration with air (10 ml/min) in situ at 580 °C for 30 min, the catalytic performance of each DH cycle is almost restored. For the eighth cycle test, the propane conversion maintains an approximately 10% decrease, but the propene selectivity shows a slight increase compared to the first DH cycle, suggesting that VOX species may be more stable with longer DH cycle times and that the catalyst possesses excellent long-term stability. The spent 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalysts after the first and eighth cycle are denoted as the R-1 Cycle and the R-8 Cycle, respectively. Fig. 9 illustrates the TPR patterns of the fresh sample and the R-8 Cycle (calcined) catalyst. The reduction peaks show only slight variation, indicating that the active VOX species of the catalyst undergoes no significant change and maintain high dispersion over the porous silica solid. The XPS data of R-8 Cycle (calcined) catalyst indicates that there is almost no change in the V4+/V5+ ratio after 8 reaction-regeneration cycles in Fig. S-9 and Table S-2. Fig. 10 shows the TGA curves of the spent catalysts. The weight decrease can be considered as the loss of physically adsorbed water below 200 °C [27]. The R-1 Cycle and R-8 Cycle curves exhibit similar weight loss in the 200–550 °C range, which can be attributed to carbon deposition on the catalysts. The loss at above 400 °C may be attributed to the combustion of different types of coke (polymeric carbon) [35]. The similar coke deposition in the 1st and 8th cycles (inserted table in Fig. 10) may partially reflect the superior regeneration stability of the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst. Additionally, the catalytic performance of the catalyst are obtained at 580 °C within 21 h and shown in Fig. S-10. The conversion of the catalyst slowly decreases with time and maintains at ∼30% after 10 h reaction. The result suggests that V-SiO2 catalysts have good stability in this work. These results indicate that the VOX-SiO2 catalyst with 60 °C gelation temperature and 580 °C calcination temperature exhibits superior long-term stability for PDH reaction.

4. Conclusions
Porous VOX-SiO2 solids were synthesized at different gelation and calcination temperatures through an in–situ one-step method and evaluated by non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The structure-performance relationship of VOX-SiO2 catalysts indicates that an increase in gelation temperature over a certain temperature range (≤60 °C) has a slight influence on catalytic performance and will remarkably shorten the gelation process time during one-step synthesis. As a result, the VOX-SiO2 catalyst gelled at 60 °C shortens the gelation process time by half compared to the catalyst gelled at 30 °C and obtains a similar catalytic yield after 4 h reaction. When the catalyst is gelled above the boiling point of ethanol (78.3 °C), the structure and performance of porous VOX-SiO2 solids will be remarkably changed, especially for the catalyst gelled at 90 °C. In addition, the catalyst calcined at 580 °C exhibits superior stability, and the higher calcination temperature will obviously influence structural properties and catalytic performance. Note that the 60-VOX-SiO2-580 catalyst investigated in this study exhibits excellent long-term stability. Its propane conversion shows a slow decrease from 55% to 45% within a 4 h reaction, and the propene selectivity remains constant at around 91% over the eight reaction-regeneration cycles for PDH. The work reported here would be beneficial for further industrial development and application of porous VOX-SiO2 solids in catalysis.
