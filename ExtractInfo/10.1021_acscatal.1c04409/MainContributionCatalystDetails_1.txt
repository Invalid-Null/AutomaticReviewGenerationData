 Unfortunately the provided document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The paper focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using a Ti3C2Tx MXene-derived TiO2 catalyst. Since it does not pertain to propane conversion, I will output that it is not relevant.
