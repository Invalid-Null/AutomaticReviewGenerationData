The given document does not contain any information related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It discusses a combined UV-Vis/Raman/XAFS setup to study heterogeneous catalysts, but does not mention conversion of propane to propylene specifically. Therefore, I have indicated that the document is not relevant and did not provide any additional information in the output.
