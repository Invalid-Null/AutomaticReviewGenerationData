The provided document does not contain information related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It discusses combined operando UV-Vis/Raman/XAFS spectroscopy applied to silica- and alumina-supported molybdenum oxide catalysts, but does not mention conversion of propane to propylene specifically. Since the content is not relevant to PDH or ODH processes, details on the catalyst, performance enhancements, etc. cannot be extracted.
