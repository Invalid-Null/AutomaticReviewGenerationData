The given document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation. It discusses combined operando UV-Vis/Raman/XAFS spectroscopy to study silica- and alumina-supported molybdenum oxide catalysts under propane dehydrogenation conditions, but does not provide details about improvements to propane dehydrogenation specifically. The document focuses on the spectroscopy techniques rather than the catalyst performance. Since there is no discussion of enhancements to propane dehydrogenation selectivity, conversion, or stability, I have indicated this is not relevant.

The given document does not contain any information related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It discusses combined UV-Vis, Raman and XAFS spectroscopy to study silica- and alumina-supported molybdenum oxide catalysts, but does not mention conversion of propane to propylene specifically. Since the content is not relevant to PDH or ODH processes, I have indicated "No" for relevance and did not include any other information in the output.
