The key points extracted are:
- The catalyst type is silica- and alumina-supported molybdenum oxide, a metal oxide catalyst. 
- The active element is molybdenum.
- It is applied for propane dehydrogenation (PDH).
- The feed gas contains propane.
- The main scientific contribution is advancing catalyst characterization through combined operando spectroscopy techniques. This provides simultaneous optical, vibrational, and structural data to better understand catalyst structure-function relationships.

I integrated the information into a cohesive XML structure capturing the core elements related to the catalyst, process, and performance enhancement based on the multiple extractions provided. Let me know if you would like me to modify or expand the summary in any way.
