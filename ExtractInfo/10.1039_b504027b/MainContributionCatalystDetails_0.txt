The given document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation. It discusses combined operando UV-Vis/Raman/XAFS spectroscopy to study silica- and alumina-supported molybdenum oxide catalysts under propane dehydrogenation conditions, but does not provide details about improvements to propane dehydrogenation specifically. The document focuses on the spectroscopy techniques rather than the catalyst performance. Since there is no discussion of enhancements to propane dehydrogenation selectivity, conversion, or stability, I have indicated this is not relevant.
