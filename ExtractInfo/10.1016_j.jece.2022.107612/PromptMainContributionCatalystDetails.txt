Ce-doped cobalt aluminate catalysts for the glycerol hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) with in-situ produced hydrogen
In this study, the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of glycerol with in-situ produced H2, via aqueous-phase reforming, was investigated over Ce-doped CoAl2O4 catalysts synthesized by coprecipitation. The catalytic runs were performed at 50 bar/260 ºC for 3 h TOS in a fixed bed reactor. The synthesized catalysts were extensively characterized to better understand the effect of physicochemical and surface characteristics on the catalytic performance. The results revealed that doping with Ce increases the population and strength of acid centers, which results in a higher selectivity towards deoxygenated liquid products. Ce-doped catalysts exhibited higher yield to hydroxyacetone and 1,2-propanediol. Post-reaction characterization revealed a decrease of the metallic surface area, mainly due to alumina coating, and to a lesser extent, due to the oxidation and leaching of the cobalt.
1. Introduction
The need to diminish fossil fuel dependence in the chemical industry has led to the intensification of bio-based alternative products. Bio-based chemicals, products that are derived from biomass and other biological materials, are pivotal to the development of a more innovative and low-emissions economy while ensuring biodiversity and environmental protection [1]. The use of bio-based chemicals have raised as an alternative to standard chemicals since their environmental footprint is limited compared to their traditional counterparts. From a technical point of view, almost all the fuels and chemicals normally produced from fossil feedstocks can be produced from biomass in the so-called biorefinery [2]. Thus, bio-chemicals could drive a new economy model based on more thoughtful uses of natural resources. Hence, the European Commission aims to accelerate the market uptake of bio-chemicals, and estimates an annual growth rate of around 3.6% per year from 2018 to 2025, what represents an important expanding sector [1]. At present, researchers and entrepreneurs are involved in the development and commercialization not only of biofuels, but also of bio-derived replacements for basic chemicals. The path to a more sustainable industry will inevitably depend on the development of new high value-added chemicals, via catalytic process, from renewable sources [3].
A very attractive platform chemical from biomass is glycerol, which was identified as a top 12 bio-based chemical by the US Department of Energy [4]. Production of chemicals from raw glycerol is a good alternative to absorb the glycerol surplus generated from biodiesel industries. Several products can be obtained from glycerol, either gaseous products (i.e. hydrogen, syngas, alkanes, etc.), as well as high value-added liquid products (i.e. hydroxyacetone, pyruvaldehyde, acrolein, propanal, lactic acid, glyceric acid, acetaldehyde, etc.) [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10].
Another valuable chemical that can be produced from hydrogenolysis of glycerol is 1,2-propanediol. It is widely used in the synthesis of unsaturated polyester resins, as coolant and also in pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetics formulations [11]. Currently, 1,2-propanediol is produced through the hydration of propylene oxide, which in turn comes from the selective oxidation of propylene, a fossil resource [12].
Conversion of glycerol to 1,2-propanediol involves the removal of an oxygen atom by the addition of hydrogen (C-O bond cleavage with simultaneous hydrogen addition), a catalytic reaction known as hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). The conventional way to carry out this process requires an external H2 supply, usually derived from fossil fuels, which increases the cost and can generate safety issues due to the high diffusivity and flammability of molecular hydrogen [13]. In addition, hydrogen can block metal centers causing an inhibitory effect on catalytic activity [14]. Other explored alternative is the catalytic transfer hydrogenation (CTH) by using a hydrogen donor molecule such as methanol, 2-propanol, or 2-butanol [15]. Nevertheless, the formation of by-products and the cost of acquisition and handling of the hydrogen donor can significantly increase process costs [13]. A suitable alternative to circumvent the use of external and non-renewable sources of hydrogen is to carry out glycerol HDO with in-situ produced H2 via aqueous-phase reforming (APR) of the substrate, in a one-pot reaction.
The present investigation aims to develop a catalytic system that could drive the in-situ generation of hydrogen and its immediate consumption, in the reaction medium, in the HDO reaction. Therefore, a metal-acid bifunctional catalyst is required. In a simple way, the acid function is pivotal for the dehydration reaction whereas the metal function catalyses the hydrogenation reaction [16]. Scheme 1 shows the widely accepted reaction path for the glycerol HDO in liquid phase.

Non-noble metals are less expensive than noble metals and present a greater selectivity towards C-O bond cleavage, and therefore, they are more efficient and economical for 1,2-propanediol production [17]. Transition metals and, more specifically, cobalt-based catalysts, have proved effective in both the production of hydrogen by aqueous-phase reforming (APR) and for glycerol HDO reaction depending on metal–acid/base characteristics [18], [19], [20].
Promoters can increase the metal-support interaction, the dispersion of the active metal and can also tune the acid/base characteristics of the catalyst [21]. The addition of a promoter is an economical and time-efficient strategy that can enhance activity [22]. Cerium has been used by several researchers to improve catalyst activity and stability in liquid phase reactions. Its positive effect has been mainly attributed to the existence of oxygen vacancies in the cerium oxide (CeO2) lattice, which may promote WGS reaction by the activation of the H2O molecule [23], [24], [25], [26]. In addition, its high oxygen mobility can improve hydrothermal stability and avoid the formation of coke precursors [27], [28].
In our previous work [29], cobalt-based catalysts were synthesized from cobalt aluminate spinels with different Co/Al molar ratio. These catalysts showed remarkable glycerol conversion and considerable efficiency for C-O cleavage where catalyst with CoAl = 0.625 molar ratio exhibited the most promising performance. Based on that result and known the notable catalytic properties of cerium, in the present work, Ce-modified cobalt aluminate (Co/Al molar ratio = 0.625) catalysts are investigated for the glycerol HDO. In this way, we seek to modify the physico-chemical properties of the pristine catalyst to produce value-added liquid products from glycerol HDO. As far as we know, this type of one-pot synthesized catalysts have not yet been studied in glycerol HDO. The catalytic experiments were carried out in a continuous reactor, where hydrogen was in-situ generated via APR. The synthesized catalysts were thoroughly characterized by several techniques, either in the fresh and reduced form. The various physicochemical properties were correlated with the catalytic performance. In addition, exhausted catalysts were characterized to identify the main deactivation causes.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts synthesis
A series of catalysts based on cobalt aluminate (nominal Co/Al molar ratio = 0.625) doped with cerium were one-pot synthesized by coprecipitation method. In a typical synthesis, an aqueous solution containing Co(NO3)2.6 H2O (99.999% trace metal basis, Sigma Aldrich), Al(NO3)3.9 H2O (98% trace metal basis, Fluka) and Ce(NO3)3.6 H2O (99.999% trace metal basis, Sigma Aldrich) was dropwise added into a beaker containing an aqueous solution of Na2CO3 (99.8%, Fluka), under stirring. The synthesis was carried out at room temperature at pH 10, adjusted with NaOH solution (2 M). The resulting suspension was aged at room temperature for 24 h, filtered, washed several times with de-ionized water, dried overnight at 110 °C in an oven and calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 5 h (heating at 5 °C/min), in static air atmosphere. The obtained solids were abbreviated xCeCoAl (x: 0, 0.3, 2.1), where x denotes the weight percentage of Ce. As a reference, bare CeO2 and Co3O4 were also synthetized by precipitation, following the same protocol.
2.2. Catalysts characterization
Bulk chemical composition of the solids and metal leaching in catalytic runs were analysed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Textural properties of the solids were obtained from nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K in a Micromeritics TRISTAR II 3020 equipment. Prior to the adsorption, the samples were outgassed at 300 ºC for 10 h for removing moisture and adsorbed gases. The specific surface area and the main pore size were determined with the BET and BJH (desorption-branch) methods.
XRD spectra were obtained in a PANalytical Xpert PRO diffractometer with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). X-ray diffracted radiation was recorded from (2θ values) 20–80º for the powder samples. The identification of the crystal phases was carried by comparison with International Centre of Diffraction Data (ICDD) database. Crystallite size was calculated from the X-ray line broadening analysis using Debye-Scherrer formalism. The lattice parameter (a) of cubic crystal structure was calculated by Eq. 1:
(1)
were; θ is the diffraction angle; and h, k and l are the Miller indices.
STEM images were obtained in a FEI Titan Cubed G2 60–300 electron microscope with a high-brightness and a Super-X EDX system under HAADF detector for Z contrast imaging (camera length of 185 mm). The samples were dispersed in ethanol and kept in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min. Afterwards, a drop of suspension was spread onto a TEM copper grid (300 Mesh) covered by a holey carbon film and dryed under vacuum. Particle size distribution was obtained from the statistical analysis of at least 300 particles. The average size of the nanoparticles was calculated from volume to surface ratio (Eq. 2), using ImageJ software:

being di the diameter of ni particles.
The oxidation state of the surface elements was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on a SPECS spectrometer with Phoibos 150 1DDLD device, using monochromatic Al Kα (1486.7 eV) X-ray source with 30 eV pass energy at 0.05 eV steps. Samples, previously degassed, were introduced to the ultra-high vacuum analysis chamber (10-6 Pa) where the detailed analyses of the elements were performed (time 0.1 s and step energy 30 eV) with an exit angle of 90°. Samples were reduced in-situ, when required. The spectrometer was previously calibrated with Ag (Ag 3d5/2, 368.26 eV). The BE were calibrated by taking C 1 s peak (284.6 eV) of adventitious carbon as reference. Peaks were deconvoluted after Shirley background subtraction, using a mixed Gaussian Lorentzian function (CASA XPS software).
The UV–vis–NIR DRS spectra were recorded in a Cary 5000 equipment coupled to Diffuse Reflectance Internal (Varian). The reflectance data were converted into absorption by the Kubelka-Munk transformation. The Tauc plots were used to evaluate the difference in the energy of inner electron transitions of the solids. For the calculation,
plot was used, where α is the absorption coefficient, ν is the frequency of light and h is the Planck’s constant.
27Al Solid State NMR measurements were performed on a 9.4 T Bruker AVANCE III 400 spectrometer operating at resonance frequencies of 104.26 MHz for 27Al. AlCl3 aqueous solution was used as a reference. The spectra were acquired at a spinning frequency of 60 kHz employing a PH MASDVT400W BL 1.3 mm ultrafast probe head. A single pulse of 0.3 μs duration was applied (recycle delay 0.2 s, 36,000 scans).
The reducibility of the calcined samples was analysed by H2-TPR, carried out in a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 apparatus. The solid was initially heated in He stream at 550 °C for 1 h to desorb impurities, and then cooled down to room temperature. Then, 5% H2-Ar flow was passed through the bed containing the sample while temperature was increased up to 950 ºC (heating rate 10 ºC/min) and hold for 1 h. A cold trap was used to prevent water generated by reduction, and reactor exhaust was analysed by Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD).
Both the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions require metallic function. The number of accessible metallic cobalt atoms was measured by H2 pulse chemisorption, carried out in a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 apparatus, at 35 ºC. Samples were previously reduced at 600 °C for 30 min. A chemisorption stoichiometry HCo = 1/1 [30] and a cross-sectional area of 0.0662 nm2/atCo were assumed [31]. Further information on the metallic function of the catalysts was obtained by measuring their activity in cyclohexane dehydrogenation, which will mainly depend on the metal accessibility [32]. The cyclohexane dehydrogenation was performed over 20 mg of reduced catalysts, in a fixed-bed reactor at 250 ºC and atmospheric pressure, feeding a mixture of anhydrous cyclohexane and hydrogen (1:3000 mol ratio). The gas product (benzene and cyclohexane) were online analysed by GC (column Al2O3-KCl, HP) coupled to a flame ionization detector (FID).
The amount and strength of surface acid sites of the reduced catalysts were measured by means of NH3-TPD and isomerization of 3,3-dimethyl-but-1-ene (33DM1B) model reaction. For ammonia chemisorption/desorption experiments (Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 equipment) a series of 10% NH3-He pulses were introduced at 90 ºC, until saturation. Subsequently, the sample was exposed to He flow for 60 min to remove reversibly bound NH3. Finally, the temperature was raised to 950 °C (heating rate 5 °C/min) with continuous ammonia monitoring. The total acidity was calculated from the integration of the pulses, and the strength of the acid sites was evaluated from the corresponding TPD profile. The model reaction of skeletal isomerization of 33DM1B was used to characterize the Brønsted acid sites, since Lewis acid centers are not involved in this reaction [33]. The catalyst (100 mg) was in-situ reduced, and cooled down to the reaction temperature (300 °C) under inert flow. The 33DM1B partial pressure and flow rate were set at 20 kPa and 15.2 mmol/h, respectively. The obtained products were online analysed by GC-FID on a RTx-1 (Restek) column.
The characterization of the carbonaceous deposits in the spent catalysts was carried out by Raman spectroscopy (Renishaw InVia Raman spectrometer, Leica DMLM microscope) using 514 nm laser. The power density of the laser beam was reduced in order to avoid the photo-decomposition of the samples. In order to improve the signal to noise ratio, 40 s were used for each spectrum and 10 scans were accumulated at 10% of the maximum power of the 514 nm laser, in the 1000–2000 cm−1 spectral window.
Carbonaceous deposits on spent catalysts were quantified by Temperature Programmed Hydrogenation (TPH) in a Setaram Setsys Evolution thermobalance coupled to a Mass Spectrometer (Pffeifer Vacuum OmniStar) following the evolution of m/z = 15 (CH4) signal. First, sample was cleaned under a He flow, at 550 °C for 1 h in order to remove absorbed organics. After cooled down to 40 °C, 5%H2/Ar flow was passed through the sample heated at 10 °C/min up to 900 °C.
2.3. Catalytic performance
Catalytic performance was evaluated in a bench-scale ﬁxed-bed up-flow reactor (Microactivity Effi, PID Eng&TEch) with synthetic aqueous solution of glycerol (10 wt% glycerol) at 260 ºC/50 bar, operating at WHSV= 24.5 h-1. About 0.5 g of catalyst, particle size of 0.04–0.16 mm, were mixed with deactivated quartz wool and in-situ reduced under 10% H2/He flow at 600 ºC and atmospheric pressure, for 1 h. The reactor was pressurised with He and when the desired pressure was achieved, the He flow was switched to bypass, and the glycerol solution (0.2 mL/min) was fed to the reactor while the temperature was progressively raised up to the reaction temperature, at 5 ºC/min. Catalytic performance was measured at 3 h TOS (time on stream). Zero time was taken when reactants reached the catalyst bed, once the reaction temperature was reached. Gaseous and liquid phases were separated at 5 ºC in a Peltier device. The gaseous products were swept away with a He flow (40 mL/min) applied immediately after the backpressure regulator. Product distribution was online analysed by a μGC (Agilent) equipped with four columns (Al2O3-KCl, PPQ and MS5A columns that used He as a carrier, and MS5A column which used Ar as a carrier). The liquid product was collected every hour in 2 mL glass vials and off-line analysed by GC-FID (Agilent, 6890N) and HPLC-RI (Waters, Hi-Plex H column). The quantification of liquid compounds was performed by external calibration. Total organic carbon (TOC) in the liquid phase was measured on a Shimadzu TOC L apparatus. The carbon balance was 96% ± 5 for all the experiments. After catalytic test, spent catalyst was recovered and characterized by a sort of techniques.
The catalytic performance was calculated according to the following indices. The total glycerol conversion (XGly) was calculated as:

3. Results
3.1. Bulk chemical composition and textural properties
Table 1 lists the bulk chemical composition and textural properties of the synthesized solids. Actual metal content measured by ICP-OES revealed a good agreement with the nominal Ce content (variation less than 3%) and Co/Al ratio (slightly higher than nominal).

In parenthesis, the values for the fresh reduced solids
The isotherms of all the calcined solids (Fig. 1A) were IV type, which were characteristic of mesoporous materials, with the P/P0 position of the inflection point (around 0.5) corresponding to a mesoporous range diameter. The hysteresis loop shape suggested randomly distributed mesopores formed by nanoparticle assembles. Regarding the BJH pore size distribution of the solids, it varied with Ce content (Fig. 1B). While pristine 0CeCoAl and 0.3CeCoAl presented a unimodal PSD with maximum at 6.8 nm sized pore, sample 2.1CeCoAl presented a bimodal distribution with pores at 7.8 nm and 13 nm, which would anticipate a certain ceria segregation in the later assay. The surface area, pore volume and average pore size of the solids are shown in Table 1. Pristine 0CeCoAl showed SBET = 125.3 m2/g, which was slightly lower than stoichiometric CoAl2O4 (about 150 m2/g) [29]. Recall that 0CeCoAl solid had more Co than stoichiometric (CoAl = 0.625 vs. 0.5), in form of Co3O4, characterized by its low surface area [34]. Coprecipitation of Ce together with Co and Al leaded to an increase by 16–18% in the SBET as compared to 0CeCoAl counterpart. Likewise, an increase in pore volume was observed (between 22% and 33% increase) for Ce-doped solids.

After reduction (at 600 °C, 2 h), the isotherms were also of IV type. The specific surface area of Ce-doped solids slightly dropped (by 7–10%) as compared to calcined counterparts, with a concomitant increase in the mean pore size values (increase by 14–18%). It should be noted that this increase was much less pronounced than that revealed by 0CeCoAl sample (41%). Decrease in the SBET in the reduced solids was attributed to the dilution effect by metallic cobalt in the solid surface. Compared to 0CeCoAl assay, SBET of xCeCoAl reduced samples was 30–36% higher. Therefore, up to this point, we can conclude that the addition of Ce notably improved the textural properties of the solid in both calcined and reduced conditions, acting as structural promoter.
3.2. Nature and morphology of the phases
XRD diffractograms of Ce-doped and pristine cobalt aluminate solids, in their calcined and reduced forms, are displayed in Fig. 2. All the calcined samples exhibited the characteristic peaks for spinel phase. It should be noted that the Co/Al ratio in our catalyst was 0.64 which is around 30% larger than the stoichiometric ratio in CoAl2O3 (i.e. CoAl = 0.5). Thus, the segregation of part of Co atoms to form Co3O4 was expected to occur. The formation of CoAl2O4 spinel phase occurs due to the counter-diffusion of Coδ+ and Al3+ ions at the interface between Al2O3 and Co3O4 oxides, both isotopic crystal structures, formed at the early stages of the thermal treatment [35]. Unfortunately, it was difficult to differentiate between Co3O4 and CoAl2O4 by XRD analyses due to the similarities in the crystal structure and d-spacing (PDF 00–042–1467 and PDF 00–044–0160, respectively). Diffraction patterns of Ce-doped solids were almost the same as that of pristine 0CeCoCAl, indicating that the solid retained the same crystal structure upon Ce doping. Moreover, the spinel peaks became narrower upon Ce addition (inset in Fig. 2A), indicating increase in the crystallite size. Only the catalysts with the highest Ce content showed diffraction peaks at 28.7º and 48.3° (2θ) attributed to CeO2 in its cerianite-phase structure (PDF 00–034–0394), indicating segregation of Ce. The broadness of its characteristic XRD peaks suggested small size of the ceria crystallites. This peak was not observed for sample 0.3CeCoAl, which confirmed that for that solid, Ce ions were substituted in the spinel lattice. According to literature, the cerium solubility into spinel phase is CeCo = 0.03 molar ratio [36]. In our 2.1CeCoAl solid, the actual Ce/Co ratio was 0.025, close to the solubility limit. A careful inspection of (311) peak of the spinel phase showed a slight downshift in its position (inset of the Fig. 2), indicating that the addition of Ce caused a distortion in the spinel structure. Accordingly, Ce-doping generated a growth in the spinel lattice parameter (Table 2), which was attributed to the larger ionic radius of Ce4+ ions (101 pm) as compared to Co2+ (79 pm), Co3+ (69 pm) and Al3+ (67.5 pm) host ions. Similar features were obtained by others [37].

2.1CeCoAl 7.0 0.8059 ± 0.0018 0.76 7.2
The intensity ratio of the (220) to (440) diffraction planes, indicative of the cobalt ions in tetrahedral to octahedral sites [38], increased as Ce-content augmented (Table 2), indicating a preferential arrangement of cobalt ions in tetrahedral coordination [39]. The mean crystallite size of spinel phase (without distinction between CoAl2O4 and Co3O4) increased between 28% and 40% with Ce doping. The average crystallite sizes of segregated ceria phase could not be determined due to its weak signal. Undoubtedly, lattice changes would affect spinel structure.
After reduction, diffraction peaks of spinel phase remained (Fig. 2B), indicating that the reduction temperature was not enough for complete reduction of all cobalt species. Upon reduction, diffraction peaks assignable to metallic Co emerged in all samples, whereas in sample 2.1CeCoAl, the formation of an alloy-like Ce5Co19 rhombohedral phase (PDF 026–1084) more stable structure was observed. The formation of this stable phase would explain the shift at higher temperatures of peaks III and IV observed in the H2-TPR study (see below). The mean crystallite size of metallic Co of Ce-doped catalysts (Table 2) were notably smaller than that of the pristine 0CeCoAl assay. It could be concluded that, Ce insertion in the cobalt aluminate spinel structure, strengthens the metal-support interaction in the reduced catalyst and contributes to a decrease of Co0 particles size.
The morphology of the reduced materials was analysed by STEM micrographs. The obtained micrographs and the resulting particle size distribution histograms are depicted in Fig. 3. The chemical composition of the nanoparticles was also confirmed by EDX analysis. Cobalt nanoparticles (mixture of cube and cuboid shapes) in Ce-doped catalysts were homogenously distributed, as were the tiny cerium nanoparticles that were found completely scattered throughout the samples. Ce-rich domains were observed for 2.1CeCoAl assay, indicating some Ce-rich phase. Co0 particle size was measured by imageJ software, and a similar mean diameter (ca. 20 nm) was measured for all catalysts, suggesting they are composed by agglomerates of smaller crystallites. Regarding the particle size distribution, particle size ranged between 10 and 26 nm while 75% of the nanoparticles were smaller than 20 nm. Ce-modified solids showed a broader distribution curve, in line with the Co0 crystallite sizes evaluated by XRD (0.3CeCoAl: 9.8 nm; 2.1CeCoAl: 7.2 nm).

3.3. Structure and coordination state
XPS spectroscopy was employed to examine the oxidation state and the surface composition of xCeCoAl solids. The BE of the photoelectron peaks for both calcined and reduced samples are summarised in Table 3. The high-resolution XPS spectra for Co, Ce and Al in the calcined solids are shown in Fig. S1 (Supporting Information). It can be seen that the spin-orbit splitting (ΔBE) between Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 peaks was 15.21 eV for 0CeCoAl, which increased to 15.67 eV at the lowest Ce loading (0.3CeCoAl). Further increase in Ce doping decreased the ΔBE (i.e. 15.35 eV for sample 2.1CeCoAl). The satellite peak of Co 2p3/2 is located at approximately 4–5 eV higher BE than the main Co 2p3/2 peak, which is characteristic of Co2+ in CoAl2O4 framework [40], [41]. In the Al 2p region, both the calcined and reduced samples show peaks at around 74 eV which can be assigned to Al3+ cations bonded with oxygen. The peaks could be deconvoluted into octahedral and tetrahedral Al3+ contributions, being the former at higher BE [42]. All the solids had mainly octahedral Al3+. In addition, in the fresh catalysts Co 2p3/2 band appeared shifted to lower binding energies as Ce loading increased, what suggested a stronger interaction between elements in Ce-doped solids, in agreement with H2-TPR results.

Ce 3d peaks of the calcined solids (Fig. S1C, Supporting information) showed a 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 separation of around 18.2 eV, in good agreement with literature [43], [44], [45]. Unambiguously, no characteristic peaks of tetravalent Ce4+ were detected. Instead, characteristic peaks of Ce3+ were observed at around 902.7 ± 0.5 eV and 885.2 ± 0.7 eV. The latter result of Ce 3d94f1 O 2p6 final-state [43].
The Co 2p XPS spectra of the reduced solids are displayed in Fig. 4. The most striking difference was the signal from metallic cobalt, absent for calcined solids. It appeared at 778.0 eV for 0CeCoAl catalyst and shifted to higher BE for samples xCeCoAl (ΔE = 0.7–1.1 eV), in agreement with their lower band gap energies. In addition, for the reduced xCeCoAl, deconvolved Co0 peak were less intense than for 0CeCoAl catalyst, in agreement with H2-TPR results.

Fig. 4. Detailed Co 2p XPS spectra of reduced xCeCoAl solids.
Two typical bands could be observed in the O 1s XPS spectrum of the reduced samples (Fig. S1D, Supporting Information). The peak at 530.9–531.6 eV corresponded to adsorbed oxygen (Oads) species and the other, located at lower BE coincided with surface lattice oxygen (Olatt) [46]. Oads species has greater mobility than Olatt, and are considered responsible for maintaining the charge balance in the structure [47], [48]. The ratio Oads/Olatt significantly decreased after Ce loading (1.07–1.51 vs. 3.34) what implied a decrease in oxygen vacancies.
A quantitative evaluation of the chemical composition of Co and Al at solid surface was done for both the calcined and reduced samples (Table 3). It is interesting to note that surface Co/Al ratio was lower than the bulk ratio measured by ICP-OES which was around 0.63 for all catalyst. This enrichment in Al could be attributed to its lower surface energy in comparison to Co [49], which generated cobalt-deficient aluminium-rich phase on the surface. Also, note that upon reduction, the Co/Al ratio decreased by half for the non-doped reference catalyst, whereas it remained constant for Ce-doped samples. The smaller metallic Co particle sizes of the later could be involved in preserving the Co/Al ratio at the surface.
Fig. 5 shows the UV–vis DRS spectra of the calcined catalysts. Bare CeO2 sample, used as reference, showed two absorbance bands below 400 nm. Bands at 257–278 nm can be attributed to O2--Ce4+ charge transfer transitions involving Ce3+ (≈255 nm) and Ce4+ ions (≈278 nm) with different coordination numbers, whilst a characteristic vibration of interband transitions at 328 nm was observed [50]. The spectrum of 0CeCoAl sample was very similar to bare Co3O4, with a small blueshift of the bands corresponding to tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ ions, indicative of Co-Al interaction [29], [51]. Thereby, 0CeCoAl shows features from tetrahedral Co2+ (d–d transition bands at 1210, 1330 and 1500 nm; d–d absorption bands at 558, 585 and 621 nm) [52]. On the other hand, Ce-doped solids exhibited two broad bands in the UV region centred at around 420 and 635–644 nm and characteristic cobalt aluminate bands in the NIR region (1200–1500 nm). These bands were found to be less intense than those shown by pristine 0CeCoAl assay with a slight band shift from 1420 to 1460 nm, indicative of Ce incorporation to spinel.

The direct band gap (Eg) for all samples was estimated by Tauc plot (Fig. S2, Supporting Information). Typically, Eg corresponds to a ligand-to-metal charge transfer excitation energy, and shows the tendency of adjacent transition-metal centers to gain electron density [53]. A band gap of 1.38 eV was estimated for pristine 0CeCoAl solid and decreased to 0.81 and 0.48 eV for samples with 0.3% and 2.1% of cerium, respectively. The lowering of Eg for Ce-doped samples could be attributed to the incorporation of metal cations into the framework of spinel crystal [54]. The distortion caused in the cell could act as trapping-centers to capture electrons [55].
Fig. S3 (Supporting information) shows the 27Al NMR spectra obtained from the reduced solids. Catalyst 0CeCoAl shows an asymmetric single peak, at 2 ppm, corresponding to octahedral aluminium. A subtle signal at around 60 ppm, corresponding to tetrahedral aluminium, could be also deduced [56]. Ce-doping caused a slight shift of main peak to the right, and the appearance of a bulge in the 25–40 ppm range, which can be ascribed to five-coordinated aluminium. Both features indicated an increase in the disorder degree in the Ce-containing solids [57], in agreement with XRD results.
3.4. Reducibility of the solids
Fig. 6 displays the H2-TPR profiles of xCeCoAl solids. Those of bulk Co3O4 and CeO2 (5 times magnified) are also displayed as a reference. The reduction profile of bulk Co3O4 comprised two well defined reduction bands with maximum at 300 ºC and 425 ºC, and ascribed to Co3+ → Co2+ and Co2+ → Co0 reduction steps, respectively [58]. Bare CeO2 also showed two main reduction bands: the low temperature peak, centred at 496 °C, can be ascribed to the reduction of surface caps of ceria whereas the high temperature peak, centred at 845 °C, can be ascribed to the reduction of the innermost layers (bulk) of the ceria [59].

Fig. 6. H2-TPR profiles of spinels samples modified by cerium.
The reduction of the pristine 0CeCoAl [29] started at around 150 ºC. Four reduction peaks could be identified. Peak I (at 292 ºC) was ascribed to Co3+ → Co2+ reduction of the surface cobalt cations without any interaction with the alumina or cobalt aluminate phases. Peak II (at 413 ºC) was also attributed to the reduction of Co3+ species though in close interaction with alumina or cobalt aluminate [29], [60]. The reduction peak at 594 ºC (peak III) was assigned to Co2+ → Co0. Finally, peak IV (at 783 ºC) was assigned to the reduction of cobalt ions in the stoichiometric cobalt aluminate (CoAl2O4) phase [29], [61]. The XRD signals from Co3O4 and CoAl2O4 are consistent with the peak assignment in H2-TPR measurement. It is interesting to note that the strong interaction between the cobalt ions and the support (mixture of alumina and cobalt aluminate) notably hindered both Co3+ → Co2+ and Co2+ → Co0 reduction stages. Therefore, peak III from 0CeCoCe assay significantly upshifted (by 159 ºC) as compared with bare Co3O4. This behaviour reflects the lower reducibility of Coδ+ species in the Ce doped assays and is in line with XPS data where BE of Co 2p3/2 decreased with Ce loading in the calcined series.
In the Ce-doped samples, due to the low amount of CeO2 added, its reduction peaks were overlapped by the most intense cobalt reduction peaks. As for catalyst 0CeCoAl, Ce-doped samples showed four reduction peaks. After addition of a small amount of Ce (0.3 at%), peaks I and II, ascribed to Co3+ → Co2+, shifted to lower temperatures indicating a promotional effect of ceria on the partial reduction of both kinds of Co3+. However, such promotional effect was not observed in catalyst 2.1CeCoAl (see Table 4). Peak III (reduction of Co2+ to Co0) appeared at higher temperatures than those exhibited by 0CeCoAl, probably due to the hardening of Co-O-Al bonds because of the presence of electron trapping sites. Finally, the reduction of cobalt species in CoAl2O4 phase (peak IV), was again favoured at small Ce doping whereas in 2.1CeCoAl it took place at the highest temperature (813 ºC, 30 ºC higher than that of 0CeCoAl). This higher temperature requirement led to a lower degree of reduction of this sample after the activation process carried out before the catalytic experiments (reduction at 600 ºC). Overall, Ce-modified solids would achieve a smaller reduction than pristine 0CeCoAl, especially 2.1CeCoAl, worsened by the formation of Ce5Co19.

Table 4 shows the results of H2-TPR analysis. Strictly speaking, H2 consumption due to ceria reduction should be subtracted. However, the maximum theoretical H2 consumption expected from ceria reduction in sample 2.1CeCoAl was 0.076 mmolH2·g-1, what represented 1% of the total H2 uptake. Thus, the total H2 consumption is given.
3.5. Metallic function characterization
The amount of exposed metal, calculated by isothermal H2 pulse chemisorption, is gathered in Table 5. Consistent with the reducibility results discussed above, Ce addition remarkably decreased the available cobalt. This depletion was around 36% at the lowest Ce loading, and reached up to 44% at 2.1% Ce.

The activity of catalysts in the cyclohexane dehydrogenation model reaction was measured in terms of TOF values (Table 5). Measured values clearly indicate a higher activity of surface atoms in Ce-doped samples. The activity in cyclohexane dehydrogenation, expressed as TOFdehyd, increased between 42% and 52% for 0.3CeCoAl and 2.1CeCoAl catalysts respect to non-doped catalyst. UV–vis DRS analysis revealed differences in the inner electron transitions of the solids. Also, Ce-doped catalysts had smaller Co0 crystallites than pristine 0CeCoAl. Both features modified the metal-surroundings interaction, which could affect the intrinsic activity of cobalt in cyclohexane dehydrogenation. Moreover, the higher intrinsic activity of Ce-doped catalysts is also a desirable characteristic for activating H2 molecule in hydrogenolysis reactions.
3.6. Acid function characterization
The surface acid site density of the reduced solids is summarised in Table 5, and the strength distribution, according to the desorbed NH3 profiles, is displayed in Fig. S4 (Supporting Information). The acid site strength were categorized according to their desorption temperatures, as follows: weak (desorption temperature range 90–300 °C), medium (300–650 °C) and strong (> 650 °C), while the percentage contribution of each strength site was estimated from the area under ammonia desorption profile. Ce-doping led to an increase in the density of surface acid sites (increase by 55–72%) and a change in the distribution of the acid strength. Ce-doped solids exhibited a higher density of medium and strong acid centers compared to their counterpart 0CeCoAl assay. In percentage terms, strong acid sites increased from 8.1% for sample 0CeCoAl to 26% for both Ce-containing samples. Morterra et al. [62] found that Ce-doped alumina had more acidity than parent γ-alumina, and ascribed this to the modified environment of Al3+ cations by cerium. In fact, 27Al NMR and UV–vis DRS results pointed to this.
Cobalt aluminate is characterized by having Lewis acidity rather than Brønsted acidity [63]. Thus, it is expected the Lewis acid centers to prevail in Ce-doped solids. In glycerol APR conditions, dehydration of primary or secondary hydroxyl from glycerol depends on the abundance of Lewis or Brønsted acid sites [64]. Therefore, it was considered useful to evaluate the Brønsted acidity of the catalysts. Evaluation of Brønsted acidity was done in terms of the activity in the skeletal isomerization of 33DM1B. Table 5 showed large differences between 0CeCoAl and Ce-doped catalysts. Both Ce-containing catalysts were 70–90 times more active for skeletal isomerization of 33DM1B, indicating their acid sites had more acid Brønsted characteristics than 0CeCoAl, probably linked to their higher penta-coordinated Al content. In conclusion, the total acid sites density increased with Ce, which is a key feature to protonate the hydroxyl groups before oxygen loss as water.
3.7. Catalytic performance in glycerol HDO
The Weisz-Prater and Mears criteria (Table S1, Supporting Information) was used to confirm the absence of mass-transfer limitations in catalytic experiments. Blank tests carried out with the reactor bed filled solely with quartz wool (used to support the catalyst inside the reactor) showed no glycerol conversion, which suggested that homogeneous APR had no contribution to the catalytic conversion of glycerol. Similarly, HDO reaction with calcined 0CeCoAl catalyst resulted in almost null conversion, which indicated that metallic function was required for the HDO reaction. Furthermore, catalytic experiments with reduced cobalt oxide (Co3O4) resulted in low liquid yield [29], indicating the acid sites are involved in the production of liquids.
The catalytic performance in the glycerol HDO without external addition of hydrogen was studied in a continuous fixed bed reactor feeding a solution of 10 wt% glycerol/water, at WHSV of 24.5 h-1, during 3 h TOS. The results expressed as glycerol conversion, carbon yield and selectivity to liquids are shown in Fig. 7.

Fig. 7. Effect of doping Ce over cobalt aluminate spinels on glycerol hydrogenolysis.
Catalyst 0CeCoAl [29] exhibited higher glycerol conversion (95.7%) than Ce-doped catalysts. Among Ce-modified catalysts, that with the lowest cerium load showed slightly higher glycerol conversion (Xgly= 60.0% for 0.3CeCoAl vs 55.0% for 2.1CeCoAl). The low glycerol conversions obtained with Ce-containing catalysts might be related to the stabilizing effect of cerium on the Co2+ ion, delaying its reduction to Co0, as seen by H2-TPR analyses. Furthermore, and related to the above, available metallic area was lowered for Ce-doped catalyst.
Carbon yield to liquid (Xliq) was also markedly lowered for Ce-containing catalysts, and decreased with increasing dopant loading. This trend is intrinsically linked with the glycerol conversion presented for these samples. Nevertheless, selectivity towards liquid products improved by 34.5% with the addition of 0.3% Ce and by 27.1% on 2.1% Ce added, evidencing that the selectivity to liquid phase products was undoubtedly favoured by doping with Ce.
Fig. 8 A displays the yield of the main liquid products obtained. For all the catalysts, 1,2-propanediol was the foremost product generated, which indicated that H2 was indeed produced by APR. Hydroxyacetone, the major intermediate product in 1,2-propanediol formation, was the second leading liquid product. The high yields to both compounds, in addition to acetone (dehydration product of 1,2-propanediol), demonstrated high activity of the synthesized catalysts for the glycerol hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). Catalyst 0.3CeCoAl presented the maximum yield to 1,2-propanediol (34%) while 0CeCoAl and 2.1CeCoAl exhibited 28% and 25%, respectively. 0.3CeCoAl catalyst also manifested the highest yield to hydroxyacetone (22.6%). However, the utmost yield towards ethanol was achieved with pristine 0CeCoAl catalyst. The density and distribution of the acid sites is of important consideration in the production of by-products [65]. Ce-doped catalysts presented a higher density of medium and strong acid centers than pristine 0CeCoAl, which makes them better catalysts for dehydration reactions compared to bare cobalt aluminate catalyst that is conducive to dehydrogenation reactions.

Fig. 8. (A) Liquids products distribution at 3 h TOS of glycerol APR at 260 °C/50 bar, and (B) Carbon selectivity by number of bond scissions. Primary Products: from single C–C or C–O bond scission; Secondary Products: from more than a single cleavages of C-C or C-O bonds; Gas products: C-containing gases.
Besides the liquid products displayed in Fig. 8A, 1-propanol was detected for all the catalysts. Concerning 0CeCoAl catalyst, a bunch of products was detected: propionic acid, acetic acid and very low amounts of 2-propanol, acetaldehyde and methanol. Obtaining this great variety of liquid products could be explained by the highest metal availability, and therefore a high reactivity, of the 0CeCoAl catalyst, which could facilitate the concatenation of successive dehydration/hydrogenation reactions. These results showed the relevance of the Ce-doped catalysts for 1,2-propanediol production from glycerol HDO with in-situ generated H2. No liquids produced by Brønsted acid sites (acrolein, or 1,3-propanediol) were detected, indicating prevalence of the Lewis acidity.
Catalyst activity for bond cleavage was also analysed. From data in Fig. 8B it is shown that carbon selectivity to primary products (products from single C–C or C–O bond scission, such as ethylene glycol, hydroxyacetone and propylene glycol) was remarkable high for Ce-doped catalyst, 0.3CeCoAl and 2.1CeCoAl (82.5% and 79.6%, respectively). In turn, catalyst 0CeCoAl achieved 44.1% selectivity towards primary products while its selectivity to secondary ones (products obtained after cleavage of additional C-C or C-O bonds) was 24%, which is three-fold higher than that of Ce-doped catalysts. Pristine cobalt aluminate catalyst also attained a considerable selectivity to gas products (24.6%) in accordance with its high metallic surface area. Among the Ce-doped samples, catalyst 2.1CeCoAl displayed slightly lower selectivity to primary and secondary products than catalyst with 0.3% of cerium.
A summary of the reaction products is shown for the third hour TOS (Table 6). Carbon selectivity to ethylene glycol (EG) was around 5% for both Ce-doped catalysts and 3.3% for pristine 0CeCoAl. Carbon selectivity to 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PD) step up in the following order: 0CeCoAl (28.9%) < 2.1CeCoAl (42.4) < 0.3CeCoAl (46.5). Ce-containing catalysts also presented a higher selectivity towards hydroxyacetone (HA) (31–32%) compared to 0CeCoAl (11.9%). According to these results, Ce-doped catalysts can balance between acid centers (necessary for obtaining hydroxyacetone via glycerol dehydration) and metal availability for the further hydrogenation of hydroxyacetone into 1,2-propanediol. Both Ce-doped catalysts have less available Co0, but of higher intrinsic activity as deduced from the cyclohexane dehydrogenation activities (Table 5). Ce-doped catalysts still have scope for improvement to decrease hydroxyacetone production in favour of 1,2-propanediol.

selectivity to alkanes
The low selectivity to hydroxyacetone and 1,2-propanediol presented by 0CeCoAl catalyst was due to the formation of other liquid compounds and its proficiency to break C-C bonds. In this sense, the formation of light alcohol and short chain alkanes is an inconvenience to be solved for the commercial development of this process for primary products [13].
The oxygen removal degree (DOR) reflects the ability of the catalysts to generate deoxygenated liquid compounds. Ce-doping enhanced DOR, as it passed from 60.7% for 0CeCoAl to 63.5–68.3% for 0.3 and 2.1CeCoAl. Liquid products were clustered into two main group. Products obtained by C–C bond cleavage only (ethylene glycol, methanol) and those classified as C–O bond scission products. The selectivity to both types of cleavage are given in Table 6. For all the catalysts, selectivity to C-O cleavage products (SC-O) was considerable high (i.e. up to 86.9% for catalyst 0.3CeCoAl). In the same vein, 0CeCoAl catalyst presented the lowest value (SC-O = 64.5%). In contrast, selectivity to SC-C barely reached 5% (0.3CeCoAl). We can affirm that these catalysts, and particularly Ce-containing samples, exhibited excellent C–O bond scission function. Thus, the presence of cerium favoured the dehydration pathway, by slight increase of surface acid sites density, even under conditions in which cobalt aluminate based-catalysts have shown to favour dehydrogenation route [29].
Table 6 also gathered hydrogen yield (YH2) and selectivity to alkanes (Salk). Regarding YH2, it follows the same trend as the liquid yield. It indicated that the obtained H2 readily reacts to yield liquid products. Pristine 0CeCoAl showed the highest YH2 and the lowest value was obtained for catalyst 2.1CeCoAl (10.2%). This catalyst, instead, displayed the maximum selectivity to alkanes (54%, mainly methane). In brief, selectivity towards alkanes increased with cerium content, which was evidenced by the decrease in YH2. It should be stressed that YH2 reflects the hydrogen consumed in side reactions for the formation of both liquid and gaseous compounds while Salk was calculated taking into account the flow of carbon atoms in alkanes with respect to the total carbon atoms only in gaseous products. These data lead us to conclude that, for catalyst 0CeCoAl, hydrogen produced in-situ is consumed mainly in the formation of diverse liquid products, while Ce-containing catalyst were more prone to the formation of alkanes.
3.8. Characterization of spent catalysts
A slight decrease in XGly and Xliq was observed in the course of reaction (Fig. S5, Supplementary Information), more pronounced for Ce-doped catalysts. From 2 h to 3 h TOS, XGly decreased by 9–14% for Ce-containing catalysts vs 2% for 0CeCoAl assay. In the same period, conversion to liquid decreased by 4–9% for the doped catalysts, while for the non-doped assay increased by 4%, which was due to the decrease in the production of gaseous compounds while the conversion of glycerol remains more stable. In order to investigate the potential changes in the physico-chemical properties underwent by catalysts in the reaction, the characterization of spent catalysts was carried out, and the results obtained are shown in Table 7.

N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and BJH pore size distribution of the spent catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. The form of the isotherms of the spent catalysts resembled those of fresh reduced solids, indicating the pore structure was preserved. All the spent catalysts adsorbed more nitrogen than the parent fresh reduced solid, which, in turn, was reflected in the increase in SBET. Spent 0CeCoAl catalysts showed 75% increment in SBET, while Ce-doped catalysts incremented by 26–57%. Reynoso el at. observed that hydrated alumina species were involved in the specific surface area gain [29]. Under hydrothermal conditions γ-alumina could be hydrated to gibbsite or boehmite, which in turn, could be leached-off and re-deposited on the catalyst surface, generating additional porosity in the solid [66]. Differences between reduced and spent catalysts were appreciated in the BJH pore size distribution. Spent catalysts had bimodal distributions, with maxima at approximately 3–4 nm and 8–10 nm pores. The peak from smaller pores suggested the presence of new phases not observed in the fresh reduced form (e.g. gibbsite or cerium hydroxycarbonate). The former narrow peak was more pronounced for solids with higher amount of cerium. Many phenomena could explain this evolution of the textural properties, such as hydration of the alumina [67], deposits of carbonaceous materials [68] or the formation of new phases [69].
Crystalline phases in the exhausted catalysts were identified by XRD (Fig. 9A). The obtained diffractograms still showed the well-known characteristic peaks of spinel (either cobalt oxide and cobalt aluminate). XRD reflexions from metallic Co were still visible for all catalysts. The poor resolution of the spectra from those peaks prevented us to calculate the crystallite size. We could hypothesize that coalescense of metallic cobalt was not significant, despite of the high temperature used. A new peak at around 34º (2θ) emerged for all spent catalysts, which corresponded to cubic CoO phase (PDF 048-1719). This fact indicated that cobalt could be oxidized in the aqueous media of the reaction [70], [71]. It could be concluded that the oxidation of cobalt was limited to the outmost caps of the particles, since XRD signal from bulk Co0 remained. None of the spent catalysts showed diffraction peaks from hydrated alumina (boehmite or gibbsite), which could be due to its amorphous form. For Ce-doped catalysts, new XRD peaks arose and became significant for 2.1CeCoAl catalyst. Those peaks centred at 24.6º and 30.6º were attributable to the hexagonal phase of cerium hydroxycarbonate (Ce(CO3)OH) (PDF 32-0189). This new phase was formed by carbonation of ceria by the CO formed, promoted by the harsh hydrothermal conditions [72]. Cerium hydroxycarbonate has been also detected in the spent Ni/CeO2 catalysts after usage in the aqueous-phase reforming of methanol [73]. The sharpness of these Ce-containing new phase peaks indicated that the product was well crystallized. All the Ce-containing spent catalysts showed peaks from Ce5Co19 phase structure, though weakened with respect the reduced form.

Leaching of catalyst components contribute to the deactivation of heterogeneous catalysts in the liquid-phase reactions [22]. Accordingly, the catalysts metal constituents Al, Ce and Co in the reaction liquid product were analysed by ICP-MS. All spent catalysts experienced leaching of the three metals, to a different extent. At first glance, Ce-containing catalysts underwent greater leaching of all metals. Cobalt was the most leached metal and the percentage of leaching in the Ce-containing samples was 2–3 times higher than for catalysts 0CeCoAl. This behaviour could be due to the smaller size of metallic Co in the Ce-doped catalysts, which are more prone to oxidation and subsequent leaching [74]. Co was thermodynamically prone to be oxidized (preliminary stage of leaching), also the phase transition during alumina hydration could promote metal particle detachment. Due to the re-deposition of aluminium hydroxyde on the catalyst surface, leaching of aluminium was 1–2 less intense than cobalt. Meanwhile, the amount of Ce leached out from the catalysts increased in proportion to the amount of Ce in the samples.
The spent catalysts were also subjected to H2-TPR analysis (Fig. S56, Supplementary Information) and the hydrogen uptake values are reported in Table 7. The hydrogen consumption was higher than the required for the reduction of solely cobalt species (deduced through the reducibility degree). Indeed, all samples showed hydrogen consumption below 600 °C, which indicated the catalysts were oxidized in the course of the reaction. It is also noteworthy the intense H2 consumption at temperatures above 600 °C. Actually, the used catalysts showed negligible consumption below 500 °C. Other authors [75] have investigated reduction temperature range after and before reactions, concluding that spent catalysts show a shift towards higher temperatures compared to fresh one due to the aggregation or sintering of metal clusters.
Overall, the metallic availability of all catalysts was seriously compromised, as was also confirmed by H2 chemisorption that revealed a decrease of about 64% for catalyst 2.1CeCoAl and up to 96% for monometallic 0CeCoAl. One plausible explanation is the re-deposition of aluminium on the catalyst surface, covering the Co0 sites by hydrated alumina [76], [77]. Two other phenomena that cannot be ignored are the oxidation of cobalt and the preferential leaching of the smallest particles, thus remaining the largest particles, consequently reducing accessible metal atoms [78], [79].
The results obtained by TPH, displayed in Table 7, present a very low deposition of carbonaceous material, which decreased with the Ce-content. The recorded Raman spectra of the used catalysts (Fig. 9B) exhibited the typical peaks from carbon, named D and G bands, at ca. 1350 and 1590–1600 cm-1, respectively. The shape of the spectra was similar for all catalysts with a broad and less intense D-band and a more intense G-band. The shoulder observed at 1710 cm-1 in the sample 2.1CeCoAl could be attributed to an overtone of an M point phonon [80]. The degree of graphitization of carbonaceous materials was estimated by the relative intensity ratio of D and G bands (ID/IG inset in Fig. 9B). The ID/IG values obtained were in the 0.22–0.38 range and did not show correlation with the composition of the samples. Raman and TPH agree with the absence of any peak from coke in the XRD pattern. It seems that the principal deactivation issues are those related to the loss of metal surface area, due to the encapsulation by alumina, and the oxidation of cobalt species. Cobalt oxidation could lead to metal leaching, another phenomenon responsible for the decrease in the metal surface.
4. Conclusions
The effect of Ce-coprecipitation to improve the activity and selectivity of cobalt aluminate-based catalysts for glycerol HDO was discussed. Properties of catalysts based on cobalt aluminate spinels were tuned through Ce doping, a simple, fast and cost-effective synthesis method. Ce-modification of the 0CeCoAl catalyst increased SBET (by around 16–30%) and also the spinel crystallite size. For the reduced sample, in addition to cobalt aluminate and metallic cobalt species, formation of Ce5Co19 phase was identified at the highest Ce-content. Also, Ce-doping increased total acidity through a prominent increment of medium-strong acid centers.
Ce-doped catalysts exhibited lower glycerol conversion than their counterpart, 0CeCoAl. Nevertheless, their higher acid sites density have influenced the activity of these catalysts, presenting a higher selectivity towards deoxygenated liquid products. Catalyst testing in a fixed-bed reactor at 260 °C and 50 bar without external hydrogen source revealed that: (i) H2 is produced; and (ii) it is in part consumed hydrogenating liquid intermediates, which makes these catalysts to have advantageous catalytic properties for glycerol HDO in a sustainable way. The main products of glycerol conversion were 1,2-propanediol and hydroxyacetone. Selectivity to liquid products of catalyst 0.3CeCoAl was 92% and selectivity to 1,2-propanediol was over 46%, indicating that Ce-doped catalysts are compelling HDO catalysts.
Future research should focus on stability issues since post-reaction characterization verified a decrease in cobalt availability that can be attributed to re-deposition of hydrated alumina on the catalyst surface. This phenomenon, in conjunction with the deposition of carbonaceous material, could be responsible for the increment in SBET and the change in the pore size distribution. Further confirmed fact was that despite the addition of cerium, the catalysts continued to exhibit metal oxidation and leaching phenomena.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
