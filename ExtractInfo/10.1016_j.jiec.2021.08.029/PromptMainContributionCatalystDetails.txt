Applicability of membrane reactor technology in industrial hydrogen producing reactions: Current effort and future directions
Abstract
Potent carbon-neutral energy carriers bring a vital solution for sustained industrialization and environmental protection. Hydrogen as a novel zero-emission energy carrier offers more than twice energy per unit mass compared to other fuels. Membrane reactor technology transforms gray hydrogen to blue by selective hydrogen separation and carbon dioxide capture from the product mixture. Moreover, improved reactant conversion during reversible steam reforming of methane, methanol, and ethanol; water gas-shift; and dehydrogenation of cyclic and aliphatic hydrocarbons as well as enhanced hydrogen yield are results of selective and distributed hydrogen separation from membrane reactor. In this review applicability of membrane reactor technology for above-mentioned reactions are discussed and effects of different membranes, reactor designs, and operating conditions on performance of membrane reactors are investigated. Finally, impact of membrane reactor technology on reactant conversion, product yield, and overall process are explained and future directions of this technology are outlined.

Introduction
Disadvantages of fossil fuels, especially their associated pollution and greenhouse effect, together with the promise of green and sustainable emerging fuels have attracted government agencies, researchers, and industries to hydrogen as an ideal energy carrier. As can be seen from Fig. 1, hydrogen is widely used in fuel cells, automotive power supply, petrochemical refineries, hydrogen burner, and power generation [1], [2]. According to Fig. 2 hydrogen, the lightest molecule in the universe with zero emission upon combustion in air [3], offers the highest heating value per unit mass compared to other hydrocarbon fuels [4]. Hydrogen production and distribution route depend on prevalence of the required raw material at a given industrial region. Production of gray and blue hydrogen from hydrocarbons is associated with carbon dioxide by-production [5]. Green hydrogen production such as water electrolysis does not produce carbonic by-product [6]. In a gray hydrogen production route, the carbon dioxide is not captured; while, in a blue route it is. Although green hydrogen is the most environmental friendly energy source, it only comprises 4–5% of the world's hydrogen [6]. Thus, transformation of gray to blue hydrogen production can play an important role in advancing the hydrogen production industry.

The hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (HFCEV) is a device that converts hydrogen chemical energy directly to electrical energy with the highest energetic efficiency, through the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, without emitting carbon pollutants. HFCEV may be refueled directly or indirectly with hydrogen. In the direct method, the vehicle receives hydrogen from a station; while, in the indirect method the vehicle is first refueled with a hydrocarbon which is reformed onboard in the vehicle and the produced hydrogen is later sent to the HFCEV for electricity generation [2].
Currently, the world's leading vehicle manufacturers including Toyota [7], Hyundai Tucson [8], Honda Clarity [9], and Mercedes-Benz [10] are commercializing HFCEV. Launched by six European private companies in 2015, H2 Mobility Corp plans to develop 100,000 HFCEV trucks and 1500 hydrogen stations in Europe by 2030 [11].
Hydrogen internal combustion engine is another option for elimination of carbon dioxide emission and reducing fuel consumption rate. Hydrogen may be combined with petroleum-based fuels or may be used as the sole energy source in internal combustion engines [12]. Companies such as Ford [13], BMW [14],and MAN [15] have already developed hydrogen internal combustion engines.
Hydrogen is used in the petroleum refining industry to produce alcohols, ammonia, and reduce the sulphur content of diesel fuels and heavy oils [16]. E & M combustion company has developed a hydrogen utilizing burner for an innovative chemical complex in Portugal [17]. Enel company has manufactured a hydrogen combustion turbine for its first hydrogen power plant at Fusina in the Veneto region of Italy which receives hydrogen from the Eni’s nearby Polimeri Europa cracker and a petrochemical facility at Porto Marghera. Enel hydrogen power plant produces 60 million kWh electricity annually supplying electricity to 20,000 households and eliminating 17,000 tons of carbon dioxide emission per year [18].
Currently, the main hydrogen production sources include natural gases, oil, coal, and electrolysis/other with the relative utilization rate of 48%, 30%, 18%, and 4%, respectively [19]. Although hydrocarbons are the main industrially relevant hydrogen source, their hydrogen production reactions are endothermic with high energy demand which increases the overall cost. Common reactions of fossil fuel conversion and hydrogen production include catalytic steam reforming, partial oxidation, or auto-thermal reforming [20]. In the auto-thermal reforming the energy required for steam reforming is supplied by partial oxidation of the hydrocarbon feedstock. Seam reforming is a reversible reaction. Accumulation of the produced hydrogen results in an equilibrium condition at which no further hydrogen production occurs. To achieve a higher conversion in a steam reforming reactor, it is necessary to remove reaction products such as hydrogen [21], [22], [23]. Moreover, hydrogen produced from fossil fuels contains impurities such as carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, which necessitates additional purification units including water-gas shift [24], [25]. To overcome the above-mentioned problems, membrane reactor technology is widely utilized [23], [26], [27], [28]. Membrane reactors modify gray hydrogen production route to blue and offer simultaneous catalytic reactions and product separation which enhances hydrogen production efficiency, reduces reactor volume, and consequently reduces operational cost compared to those of conventional reactors [25].
The aim of this study is to provide an in-depth and critical evaluation of current efforts and future trends in hydrogen industry by investigating the recent progress in the field with the focus on the added-value of membrane reactor technology in the production/separation of hydrogen via industrially relevant steam reforming/dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons and water gas-shift reactions.
Membrane and membrane reactor
Membranes, which selectively separate a compound form a mixture, are routinely classified based on their separation mechanism, material of construction, and geometry. Membrane geometries include hollow fiber, tubular, spiral, and plate [29]. Fig. 3a–c. show the schematic of H2 transport mechanisms in membranes with different matrix structures. As can be seen from Fig. 3a., the main mechanism of H2 transport in membranes with random pore size distribution is diffusion. Depending on the working condition and pore size, bulk, Knudsen, or surface diffusion may dominate [30]. Molecular sieves with exact pore size in the range of 3–20 Å schematically shown in Fig. 3b. are also routinely used for H2 separations [31]. In metallic and polymeric dense membranes [31] solution-diffusion is the main H2 transport mechanism. As can be seen from Fig. 3c. during solution-diffusion, H2 molecule adsorbs on the membrane surface, dissociates into H atoms which transport through the membrane, and finally recombine at the membrane-permeate interface to produce the H2 molecule [32].

Material of construction dictates the transport mechanism, working condition, mechanical and chemical stability, H2 selective separation, lifespan, economic justification, and efficiency of membranes [33], [34]. As can be seen from Table 1, organic membranes include high/moderate H2 permeable carbonic and polymeric membranes. Inorganic membranes include ceramic and metallic membranes. Zeolite ceramics have high H2 permeability. Dense membranes, in particular Pd, Pd/alloys, and dense ceramic membranes, have low permeability. H2 permeability of a membrane is inversely proportional to its H2 purity; thus, metallic and dense ceramic membranes are the best options for ultra-pure H2 production. Inorganic membranes offer higher thermal and mechanical resistance compared with those of organic membranes. Porous and dense membranes made of carbonic and ceramic material may be utilized to improve membrane mechanical/chemical stability and H2 selectivity/permeability at reduced cost [35], [36]. Dense metallic membranes used for H2 separation are made of Pd, Pt, and some elements of groups III–V of the periodic table for enhanced hydrocarbon compatibility, H2 selectivity, and thermal/mechanical stability [35].

and
are partial pressure of H2 at the retentate and permeate sides in Pa; δ is the membrane thickness in m; and the exponent n quantifies the dependence of H2 flux on its partial pressure [30]. H2 permeability coefficient of membrane can be expressed by an Arrhenius-like equation as [30]:

Utilization of membrane reactors (MRs) in reversible H2 producing hydrocarbon reforming and dehydrogenation reactions theoretically offers selective H2 removal, reduced reactor volume, enhanced separation, recycling and increased residence time of the unreacted feed, increased H2 production due to equilibrium shift, and enhanced H2 selectivity and process efficiency [30], [33]. The most important MR configurations include shell and tube membrane reactors (STMR), radial-flow tubular membrane reactor (RFTMR), axial-flow spherical membrane reactors (AFSMR), and planar membrane reactors. In recent years, companies such as Tokyo Gas, the energy research center of the Netherlands (ECN), MR technology, and CRI/Criterion a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell have taken the initial steps to advance H2 production via MR technology by manufacturing metallic membrane for H2 production/separation. The specifications of commercially available H2 separating membranes are summarized in Table 2. According to Table 2, commercial H2 separating membranes are made of Pd and Pd/Ag with thickness and cross section area in range of 3 to 25 μm and 0.0093 to 0.5 m2, respectively. The membranes are mostly supported on Al2O3 followed by Ni and Zirconia. Currently the main industrial MR configuration are STMR followed by planar. Current industrial H2 membranes can produce 99.99% pure H2 with the maximum production capacity of 150 Nm3/h.

Hydrogen production via membrane reactors
Methane steam reforming (MSR)
Half of the industrial H2 production units in the world operate by reforming of hydrocarbons in fixed bed reactors. Steam reforming is the process by which a hydrocarbon, mainly methane, reacts with steam to produce synthetic gases containing H2 and CO. An industrial steam reforming unit has sulphur guard, reactor, and gas purification section. MSR, methane dry reforming, methane partial oxidation and water–gas shift (WGS) reactions are as follows:

Hydrocarbon reforming reactions are generally endothermic with product molar expansion; therefore, require high temperature and low pressure. It has been reported that increasing temperature, increases methane conversion in both MRs and traditional reactors (TRs) [51], [52]. In order to provide thermal energy for the endothermic MSR, air or oxygen might be injected to the reactor promoting auto-thermal reforming reaction which supplies the thermal energy for steam reforming [20]. Auto-thermal methane reforming is a combination of steam reforming and partial oxidation reactions. Fig. 4a. shows schematics of a MR in which auto-thermal reforming occurs [20].

Multifunctional TDCSTMR for simultaneous methylcyclohexane dehydrogenation, and methanol synthesis [62], and d. Multifunctional TDCSTMR for simultaneous ethylbenzene dehydrogenation and nitrobenzene hydrogenation [63].
Due to the endothermic nature and high temperature demand of MSR, coke formation might occur [53] which reduces the lifespan of tubes and catalysts [54] in TRs which ultimately increases the operational and maintenance costs. MRs equipped with dense Pd or Pd/Ag alloy membrane overcome the above-mentioned problems associated with TRs [55]. Studies on the MSR reaction in the presence of 10% wt. of Ni/Al2O3 catalysts in reactors with and without Pd-based membrane showed that methane conversion in the MR is 87.1%, while in TRs it is 61.5% [56]. WGS reaction may be used with MSR to convert toxic CO to CO2 and increase H2 production.
Fig. 5 shows the effect of temperature and pressure on methane conversion and H2 yield in MSR endothermic reaction via TR and MR. High temperature provides the activation energy of the reaction and increases reaction rate according to the Arrhenius law [57]. As can be seen from Fig. 5a. and 5b., by increasing temperature methane conversion [52] and H2 yield [58] increase in both TR and MR, although the temperature effect on H2 yield is less noticeable. According to Eq. (2), increasing temperature enhances H2 permeability in membrane resulting in enhanced H2 recovery which shifts the MSR toward more H2 production via increased methane conversion. It can be seen from Fig. 5c. and 5d. that increasing pressure adversely affect methane conversion and H2 yield in TR as it works against the Le Chatelier's principle which calls for pressure reduction in product molar expanding reactions such as MSR. In contrast, at a given temperature increasing pressure in the feed side of MR enhances methane conversion and H2 yield [51], [59], [60]. In fact, positive effect of increased pressure on selective removal of H2 in MR according to Eq. (1), results in enhanced H2 yield and shifts the equilibrium towards enhanced methane conversion in MSR. A summary of the studies performed on the MSR via MRs is presented in Table 3. As can be seen from Table 3, the MSR via MR takes place in the temperature range of 673–1173 K and the pressure range of 1–28 bar with N2, He, Ar, or steam sweep gases. Ni-based catalyst with 2.5–150 μm thick and Pd/Pd-alloy membranes are often used in MSR-MR.

Water-Gas shift
WGS, one of the oldest heterogeneous catalytic industrial reactions consumes CO from synthesized gas and produces H2 according to reaction (10). WGS is one of the main reactions in steam/auto-thermal reforming and partial oxidation of hydrocarbons [77], [78]. WGS is a reversible exothermic reaction which is favored at low temperatures according to Le Chatelier's theory; meanwhile, high temperature provides the activation energy of the reaction and may increase reaction rate according to the Arrhenius law [57]. Therefore, WGS-TRs have two stages of high-temperature and low-temperature shift [25], [79]. In the first stage operated at 623 to 773 K with Fe/Cr- or Pt-based catalysts, the reaction rate and the CO conversion is high due to the low H2 concentration and high temperature. In the second stage operated at 423 to 533 K with Cu/Zn- or Ni/Ce-based catalysts, further H2 and CO2 enrichment of product occurs [80], [81]. Utilization of MRs for reversible WGS reaction enhances CO conversion and H2 production by selective removal of H2 from the reaction zone [82], [83].
CO conversion and H2 yield in WGS at TR and MR are compared at Fig. 6. It can be seen from Fig. 6a. that MRs generally offer a higher CO conversion at a given temperature compared to those of TRs. Moreover, CO conversion via exothermic WGS is less affected at elevated temperatures at MRs compared to that at TRs due to the equilibrium shift offered by selective H2 removal from MRs [84]. In fact, increasing temperature enhances H2 permeability in membrane according to Eq. (2) resulting in enhanced H2 recovery which shifts the WGS toward more H2 production via increased CO conversion. According to Fig. 6b., increasing pressure has a positive effect on CO conversion and H2 yield; furthermore, pressure has a more pronounced effect on WGS progress in MRs [83]. Table 4 summaries the membranes, catalysts, operating conditions, and reaction outcome of WGS-MRs . As can be seen from Table 4, WGS-MRs equipped with 1.4–70 μm thick Pd or Pd-alloy membranes operate in the temperature range of 273–1173 K and the pressure range of 1–25 bar. From Table 4 it can be seen that increasing pressure or steam to CO ratio (S/CO) in WGS-MRs, increases CO conversion and H2 yield/production. In fact, positive effect of increased pressure on selective removal of H2 in MR according to Eq. (1), shifts the equilibrium towards enhanced CO conversion and results in enhanced H2 yield of WGS.

Steam reforming of alcohols
In recent decades, production of H2 by steam reforming of renewable sources such as alcohols in MRs has been proposed [94].
Steam reforming of methanol (SRM)
Methanol is a renewable feedstock for clean and affordable H2 production [95], [96], [97]. SRM and methanol dry reforming reactions are as follows:
(11)
(12)
(13)
In the above reactions in addition to H2, 20% CO2 and 5% CO are produced. WGS, reaction (10), is one of the main reactions occurring in SRM reactors. SRM is an endothermic reaction; thus, high temperature is desirable. High temperature provides the activation energy of the reaction according to the Arrhenius law and increases reaction rate [57]. Although increasing the temperature and stream to methanol ratio (S/M) in both TRs and MRs increase methanol conversion [55], [98], the conversion increase is greater in MRs. According to Eq. (2), increasing temperature enhances H2 permeability in membrane resulting in enhanced H2 recovery which shifts the SRM toward more H2 production via increased methanol conversion. Increasing the pressure in MRs increases methanol conversion; while, in TRs it has the opposite effect [99], [100]. Fig. 7 shows the effect of temperature and pressure on methanol conversion and H2 yield in SRM via TR and MR. As can be seen from Fig. 7a. and b., by increasing temperature methanol conversion and H2 yield increase in both TR and MR [51], [101], although the temperature effect on H2 yield is less noticeable. It can be seen from Fig. 7c. and d. that increasing pressure adversely affect methanol conversion and H2 yield in TR as it works against the Le Chatelier's principle in product molar expanding reactions. According to Eq. (1) positive effect of increased pressure on selective removal of H2 in MR, results in enhanced H2 yield and shifts the equilibrium towards enhanced methanol conversion in SRM [99], [100].

A summary of H2 production studies via SRM in MRs is presented in Table 5. From Table 5 it can be seen that compared with MSR, SRM reactions are performed at a relatively low temperature (473–623 K) in MR operating at 1.2–25 bar. Cu-based Catalysts with promoters such as CeO2, Al2O3, ZnO and ZrO2 and Pd-based membranes are generally used in SRM-MRs [102], [103].

Ethanol steam reforming (ESR)
Among renewable raw materials for H2 production, ethanol is very attractive due to its non-toxicity, low production cost, and ease/safety of storage, distribution, and handling [114]. According to reaction (14), steam reforming of 1 mole ethanol produces 6 moles of H2 which is the highest H2 production per mole among hydrocarbon steam reforming reactions. Ethanol can be produced by fermentation or enzymatic decomposition of waste biomass [94]. The main methods of producing H2 from ethanol are: steam reforming (reactions (14)), decomposition (reaction (15)), dry oxidation (reaction (16)), partial oxidation (reaction (17)), and auto-thermal reforming (reactions (14), (17)) as follows:
(14)
(15)
(16)
(17)
Although partial oxidation reactions are generally exothermic, ethanol partial oxidation is slightly endothermic; thus, it will not produce the heat required for auto-thermal ethanol reforming. The main disadvantage of producing H2 from ethanol is production of CO according to reactions (15), (16) at concentrations above 10 ppm; therefore, there is an essential need for gas purification which leads to increased capital and operating costs in traditional units. WGS, reaction (10), is one of the main reactions occurring in ESR reactors which consumes CO and produces H2. The catalysts used in ESR reactions include Al2O3, CeO2, MgO, and metal catalysts such as, Ru, Rh, Pt, Ni, Ir, Pd, and Cu supported in SiO2 [55], [115], [116]. Iulianelli and Basile reported that at 673 K and 1.5 bar over Co-Al2O3 catalyst, the ethanol conversion in Pd/Ag MRs is 95% which is 11% higher than that in TRs [117]. Fig. 8 shows a comparison of the ethanol conversion and H2 recovery during ESR at various temperatures and pressures in TR and MR. As can be seen from Fig. 8a. and 8b., increasing temperature during isobaric endothermic ESR has a more positive effect on ethanol conversion [51] and H2 recovery [118] in MR compared with those in TR. Clearly, high temperature provides the activation energy of the reaction according to the Arrhenius law and increases reaction rate [57]. According to Eq. (2), increasing temperature enhances H2 permeability in membrane resulting in enhanced H2 recovery which shifts the ESR toward more H2 production via increased ethanol conversion. Effect of pressure during isothermal ESR in MR and TR are shown in Fig. 8c. As can be seen from Fig. 8c, increasing pressure has a slight negative effect on ethanol conversion in TR as it works against the Le Chatelier's principle which calls for pressure reduction in product molar expanding reactions such as ESR. In contrast at a given temperature, increasing pressure in the feed side of MR enhances ethanol conversion and H2 recovery as it provides the driving force for H2 permeation through the membrane according to Eq. (1). Selective removal of H2, shifts the equilibrium in ESR towards enhanced ethanol conversion [119].

Studies on the ESR process in MRs are listed in Table 6. As can be seen from Table 6, the ESR-MRs operate in the temperature and pressure range of 673–973 K and 1–14 bar, respectively. Pd and Pd-alloy membranes with a thickness of 6–60 μm with N2, He, Ar, or steam sweep gases are used. Finally, it is reported that the using Ru-Al2O3 instead of Pt-Al2O3 catalyst in a Pd/Ag MR at constant H2O/EtOH ratio in 723 K and 2 bar increases the H2 yield from 60% to 80% [120], [121].

Dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons
The industrial significance of catalytic dehydrogenation reactions has motivated many research groups to produce aromatics, alkenes, and H2. The most important dehydrogenation reactions include conversion of a) cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons such as a1) cyclohexane to benzene, a2) methylcyclohexane to toluene, and a3) ethylbenzene to styrene, and b) alkanes to alkenes such as b1) propane to propylene and b2) ethane to ethylene [134], [135]. Clearly selective removal of H2 in MRs promotes the aforementioned dehydrogenation reaction.
Dehydrogenation of cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons
Dehydrogenation of cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons are among high-efficiency chemical reactions for H2 production. H2 production is particularly challenging due to its explosive nature. H2 production from a liquid phase reaction such as dehydrogenation of cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons alleviates the safety concerns and capital/operational costs. Moreover, in the dehydrogenation of cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, CO and CO2 are not produced [136], [137], [138].
Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene
Cyclohexane (CH) dehydrogenation produces benzene and H2 as follows:
(18)
(19)
This reaction is highly endothermic and reversible. MRs can overcome these limitations and achieve high conversion by separating H2 from the reaction products which shifts the equilibrium toward increased CH conversion and H2 production [139]. The equilibrium conversion of CH in TR is approximately 18.4%; however, it is reported that CH dehydrogenation in a MR at 473 K lead to 100% CH conversion [61], [140]. Fig. 9a. and b. show CH conversion via its dehydrogenation in TR and MR vs. temperature and pressure, respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 9a., by increasing temperature at isobaric operation, CH conversion increases more pronouncedly in MR compared with that in TR [141]. Positive effect of temperature on CH dehydrogenation is firstly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. Clearly high temperature provides the activation energy of the reaction according to the Arrhenius law and increases reaction rate [57]. The pronounced effect of temperature on CH dehydrogenation via MR is due to its positive effect on H2 permeability through membrane according to Eq. (2) From Fig. 9b. it can be seen that increasing pressure at isothermal operation greatly reduces CH conversion in TR as it works against the Le Chatelier's principle in product molar expanding reactions. In contrast, increasing pressure has a slightly positive effect on CH conversion via MR [139] as it enhances H2 permeation through membrane according to Eq. (1) which subsequently shifts the equilibrium towards more CH conversion. Table 7 presents the studies on the dehydrogenation of CH in MRs. A can be seen from Table 7 dehydrogenation of CH in MRs takes place at 423–600 K at pressures in the range of 1 to 3 bar using Pt/Al2O3 catalysts over Pd-, alumina-, or zeolite-based membranes offering CH conversion in the range of 72.1% to ∼ 100% and H2 recovery in the range of 83.3% to 98.8%.

Dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane to toluene
Methylcyclohexane (MCH) dehydrogenation and its associated reactions are as follows:
(20)
(21)
(22)
MCH dehydrogenation is highly endothermic and reversible. By separating H2 via MRs, the equilibrium shifts towards MCH conversion and subsequent H2 production without high temperature demand [61], [143]. Fig. 9c. and 9d. show MCH conversion during its dehydrogenation via TR and MR vs. temperature and pressure, respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 9c., by increasing temperature at isobaric operation, MCH conversion increases more pronouncedly in MR compared with that in TR [135]. Positive effect of temperature on MCH dehydrogenation is mainly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. Clearly high temperature provides the activation energy of the reaction according to the Arrhenius law and increases reaction rate [57]. The pronounced effect of temperature on MCH dehydrogenation via MR is due to its positive effect on H2 permeability through membrane according to Eq. (2). From Fig. 9d. it can be seen that increasing pressure at isothermal operation noticeably reduces MCH conversion in TR [136] as it works against the Le Chatelier's principle in product molar expanding reactions. In contrast, increasing pressure has a positive effect on MCH conversion via MR as it enhances H2 permeation through membrane according to Eq. (1) which subsequently shifts the equilibrium towards more MCH conversion.
Fig. 4b. shows schematic of a bimodal catalytic STMR reactor for MCH dehydrogenation [61]. Bimodal catalytic MRs consist of a selective membrane and a catalytic support. Catalytic support has mesopores and macropores which increases catalytic activities as well as gas permeability. It is reported that bimodal BTESE-derived silica membrane supported by a Pt/γ-Al2O3/α-Al2O3 catalyst can effectively enhance MCH dehydrogenation in STMR [61], [135]. Published studies on the MCH dehydrogenation via MRs are presented in Table 8. It can be seen from Table 8 that MCH dehydrogenation is performed in MRs equipped with Pd, Pd-based, silica membranes and Pt-based catalysts at 490–673 K and 1–9 bar. Finally, Itoh et al. have reported that the MCH equilibrium conversion and H2 flux in MCH dehydrogenation is higher than those in CH dehydrogenation [155].

Thermally double coupled shell and tube membrane reactor (TDCSTMR), schematically shown in Fig. 4c., is a multi-tube reactor which may be utilized for simultaneous MCH dehydrogenation and methanol production in following zones which exchange heat [62]:
1)
endothermic MCH dehydrogenation zone containing Pt/Al2O3 catalyst operated at 490–505 K and inlet pressure of 8 bar.
2)
exothermic production of methanol from synthesized gas according to reverse reactions (11), (12) over CuO/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst in a reaction zone operated at 495–535 K and inlet pressure 77 bar:
The heat evolved in reverse reactions (11), (12) provides the thermal energy required for MCH dehydrogenation and reverse WGS reactions. The wall of the endothermic MCH dehydrogenation zone is covered with a Pd/Ag membrane which allows selective permeation of H2 into the H2 recovery zone. The wall of the exothermic methanol production zone is covered with a H-SOD membrane which allows selective permeation of water molecules into the H2O separation zone [62]. This novel design increases productivity by reducing energy demand and reactors’ volume which ultimately reduces operating costs as well as environmental footprint. Rahimpour et al. modelled simultaneous methanol, toluene, and H2 production via TDCSTMR and concluded that TDCSTMR utilization results in a MCH conversion and methanol yield enhancement of 8.1% and 6.3% compared with those in MR, respectively [62].
Dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene
Styrene is one of the most important monomers in polymer industry, widely converted to polystyrene, with annual production of 35 million tones growing at ∼ 5% per year [162]. Roughly 90% of the styrene is produced via dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (EB) [137]. EB dehydrogenation and its associated reactions are:
(23)
(24)
(25)
EB dehydrogenation is endothermic and reversible. The equilibrium conversion of EB to styrene in TRs is approximately 45% [163]. Fig. 9e. and 9f. show EB conversion during its dehydrogenation via TR and MR vs. temperature and pressure, respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 9e., by increasing temperature at isobaric operation, EB conversion increases more pronouncedly in MR compared with that in TR [137]. Positive effect of temperature on EB dehydrogenation is mainly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. Clearly high temperature provides the activation energy of the reaction according to the Arrhenius law and increases reaction rate [57]. The pronounced effect of temperature on EB dehydrogenation via MR is due to its positive effect on H2 permeability through membrane according to Eq. (2). From Fig. 9f. it can be seen that increasing pressure at isothermal operation noticeably reduces EB conversion in TR [142] as it works against the Le Chatelier's principle in product molar expanding reactions. In contrast, increasing pressure has a positive effect on EB conversion via MR as it enhances H2 permeation through membrane according to Eq. (1) which subsequently shifts the equilibrium towards more EB conversion. Published studies on dehydrogenation of EB to styrene using MRs are presented in Table 9. Due to the endothermic nature of EB dehydrogenation and production of H2 gas, the reaction is performed at 773–923 K and 0.8-6.0 bar over Fe2O3 catalyst with K2CO3 and Cr2O3 promoters [142], [164] using dense Pd, Pd-alloys, and ceramic membranes [137].

Coupling endothermic EB dehydrogenation with exothermic hydrogenation reactions such as reverse WGS or nitrobenzene hydrogenation results in an increased styrene yield [63], [169]. The hydrogenation reaction of nitrobenzene is:
(26)
Fig. 4d. shows schematics of a TDCSTMR in which the H2 produced during EB dehydrogenation permeates through stainless steel supported Pd membrane to the nitrobenzene hydrogenation zone [63]. Heat evolved during nitrobenzene hydrogenation conducts through the membrane to provide heat required for EB dehydrogenation; moreover, H2 permeation to nitrobenzene hydrogenation zone facilitates aniline production [63]. Abo-Ghander et al. showed that the TDCSTMR design results in 82% increase in styrene yield compared with in MR [63].
Dehydrogenation of alkanes to alkenes
Dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene
Natural gas is a less pollutant feed for chemical units compared to liquid hydrocarbons. Methane, the main component of natural gas, produces H2 via steam reforming. Other natural gas components namely ethane, propane, and butane can be dehydrogenated to produce H2 and alkenes. Ethylene, product of ethane dehydrogenation, is one of the most important raw materials for production of polyethylene, polyethylene oxide, polyvinyl chloride, polyester, and styrene in the chemical and polymer industries [170]. Ethane dehydrogenation reaction is:
(27)
The dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene is endothermic and reversible. The most common process for catalytic ethane dehydrogenation is high temperature steam assisted cracking over Pt, Pt alloys, or CrOx-based catalysts which promotes breakage of C–H bonds [170], [171]. Clearly steam assisted cracking require high capital/operating costs for the production and purification of products [172]. The equilibrium conversion in ethane dehydrogenation is less than 40% even at 973 K and 1 bar [173]. Simultaneous reaction and selective H2 separation in MRs shift the equilibrium toward ethylene and H2 production offering a higher ethane conversion at reduced operating temperatures which ultimately reduces the process costs [34].
Fig. 10a. to 10d. show ethane conversion and ethylene & H2 yields during ethane dehydrogenation via TR and MR vs. temperature and pressure, respectively. As can be seen from Fig. 10a. and 10b., by increasing temperature at isobaric operation, ethane conversion and ethylene & H2 yields increase in both MR and TR; however, their increases are more pronounced in MR compared with those in TR [174]. Positive effect of temperature on ethane dehydrogenation is mainly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. Clearly high temperature provides the activation energy of the reaction according to the Arrhenius law and increases reaction rate [57]. The pronounced effect of temperature on ethane dehydrogenation via MR is due to its positive effect on H2 permeability through membrane according to Eq. (2). From Fig. 10c. and 10d. it can be seen that increasing pressure at isothermal operation greatly reduces ethane conversion and ethylene & H2 yields in TR as it works against the Le Chatelier's principle which calls for pressure reduction in product molar expanding reactions. In contrast, increasing pressure has a noticeable positive effect on ethane conversion and ethylene & H2 yields via MR as it enhances H2 permeation through membrane according to Eq. (1) which subsequently shifts the equilibrium towards increased ethane conversion and ethylene & H2 yields.

Studies on ethane dehydrogenation using MRs are presented in Table 10. As can be seen from Table 10, ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene via MRs is performed at 600–873 K and 1–5 bar over Pd, Pd-alloys, and composite Pd-ceramic membranes. Notably, it is reported that ethylene yield and H2 recovery in ethane dehydrogenation using Pt/Al2O3 catalysts and 7 μm thick MFI zeolite/α-Al2O3 membrane at 5 bar increases by 35% and 10% by increasing temperature from 773 to 873 K, respectively [171].

(30)
(31)
(32)
The equilibrium conversion during propane dehydrogenation in TRs is less than 20% even at 773 K [177]. Wang et al. reported that using STMR equipped with Ba0.5Sr0.5Co0.8Fe0.2O3-δ (BSCF) membrane instead of TR, propane conversion increases from 23% to 27% and propylene selectivity increases from 15% to 44.2% [178]. Due to the endothermic nature of the reaction and production of H2 gas, the reversible propane dehydrogenation reaction must be performed at high temperature and low pressure, which promotes coke formation and catalyst deactivation. Selective separation of H2 in MRs overcomes the aforementioned limitations [177]. Fig. 11 shows the effect of temperature on propane conversion and H2 yield during propane dehydrogenation via TR and MR. As can be seen from Fig. 11a. and 11b., by increasing temperature at isobaric operation, propane conversion and H2 yield increase in both MR and TR; however, their increases are more pronounced in MR compared with those in TR [179], [180]. Positive effect of temperature on propane dehydrogenation is mainly due to the endothermic nature of the reaction. Clearly high temperature provides the activation energy of the reaction according to the Arrhenius law and increases reaction rate [57]. The pronounced effect of temperature on propane dehydrogenation via MR is due to its positive effect on H2 permeability through membrane according to Eq. (2). There is no report comparing effect of pressure on propane dehydrogenation via MR and TR; however, it can be anticipated that increasing pressure has a detrimental effect in TR based on Le Chatelier's principle and a constructive effect in MR operations as it increases the H2 transport driving force. Studies on propane dehydrogenation via MRs are summarized in Table 11. As can be seen from Table 11, dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in MRs takes place at 723–873 K 1–6 bar over Pt, Pt/Sn, and Cr catalysts in Pd and Pd alloy MRs.

Anzelmo et al. experimentally compared propane and ethane dehydrogenation in a Pd/Au/PSS MR over Ni-based catalyst at 3 bar [188]. Their results revealed that the conversion rate of propane is higher than that of ethane. Moreover, they found that increasing temperature from 623 K to 723 K increases propane and ethane conversion by 55% and 66%, respectively [188].
Conclusion
Per unit mass, hydrogen carries more than twice energy than that of any hydrocarbon fuel. Moreover, upon combustion in air hydrogen results in zero greenhouse gas emission. Hydrogen has been inevitably used in petrochemical and polymer industries and it has already emerged as the promising energy carrier for transportation and power generation. Currently, hydrogen is mainly produced from hydrocarbon feedstocks which is accompanied by carbon dioxide emission. Modification of gray to blue hydrogen production route by membrane reactor technology offers simultaneous reduction in greenhouse gas emission, selective hydrogen recovery and increased hydrogen production yield, reduced reactor volume, and economical operation.
Advances in hydrogen separating metallic membranes have motivated industrial initiatives for pure hydrogen production via membrane reactors. Selective removal of hydrogen offered by membrane reactors results in equilibrium shift and subsequent conversion/yield increase for reversible hydrocarbon reforming/dehydrogenation and water-gas shift reactions. Endothermic reversible hydrocarbon reforming as well as exothermic hydrocarbon partial oxidation and water-gas shift are limited by reaction equilibrium dictated by reactant, H2, CO, and CO2 concentration at a given thermodynamic state. According to the Le Chatelier’s principle, in a traditional reactor temperature increase in an endothermic reaction enhances conversion while it reduces conversion in an exothermic one. Also, high temperature provides the activation energy of the endothermic reactions according to the Arrhenius law and increases reaction rate. In hydrogen production via membrane reactors, temperature increase results in an increased hydrogen permeability through membrane according to Eq. (2). Consequently, temperature increase in a membrane reactor has a permanent positive effect on reactant conversion and hydrogen yield compared with that in traditional reactors regardless of the heat of reaction.
According to the stoichiometry of hydrocarbon reforming/dehydrogenation, the number of moles of product stream is higher than that of feed. Thus, pressure increase in traditional reactors results in reduced hydrogen production during hydrocarbon reforming/dehydrogenation according to the Le Chatelier’s principle. In contrast, membrane reactors offer pertinent increased hydrogen production at higher pressures as it enhances the driving force for hydrogen permeation through membrane which subseqently shift the equilibrium toward more hydrogen productivity. Multifunctional thermally double connected membrane reactor further reduces process cost and optimizes process efficiency due to efficient energy utilization.
Future work
Industrial and reversible hydrocarbon reforming/dehydrogenation and water–gas shift reaction are routinely performed in traditional reactors; however, performance of such reactors is limited by equilibrium. Membrane reactor technology has been successfully utilized in laboratory, pilot, and plant scale to enhance the conversion and simultaneously produce hydrogen in an environmentally friendly and economical process. The suggestions of this study for the future works are as follows:
1)
Environmental assessment and process economic evaluation of transformation of industrially relevant hydrogen producing reactions from traditional to membrane reactors as a tool for establishing public awareness and governmental policies.
2)
Widespread industrialization of carbon dioxide utilization techniques including sequestration and production of fuel and value-added chemicals to develop an integrated carbon neutral hydrogen production industry.
3)
Design, fabrication, and commissioning of large-scale membrane reactors with improved and sustained mechanical and chemical stability for industrially relevant hydrogen producing reactions.
4)
Further studies on other hydrogen producing reactions such as medium and long chain alkanes, cycloalkanes, and aromatics dehydrogenation in membrane reactors.
5)
Further and pilot studies on novel membrane reactor designs including thermally double connected shell and tube membrane reactor and spherical tubular membrane reactors.
6)
Facilitating hydrogen utilization by developing and utilizing industrial hydrogen fuel cell stacks, internal combustion engines, and power plants together with their integrated supply chain.
