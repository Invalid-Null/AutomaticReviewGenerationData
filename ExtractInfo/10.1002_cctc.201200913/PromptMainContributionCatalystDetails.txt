Interplay Between Bromine and Iodine in Oxidative Dehydrogenation
Graphical Abstract
A single pass to the goal: A single-pass C3H6+C3H7X yield above 80 % was achieved in propane oxidative dehydrogenation using bromine and iodine together as oxidants. This dual-halogen process is promising for the synthesis of many other unsaturated hydrocarbons, including olefins, diolefins, and aromatics.
Abstract
Oxidative dehydrogenation is a promising way to produce olefins, diolefins and aromatics. However, the product yield is limited by the consecutive oxidation of the product to oxygenated products. The highest yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation is only about 30 %. Alternatively, halogens can be used as oxidants in oxidative dehydrogenations. Although the iodine process is highly selective, it requires very high reaction temperatures (≈900 K) to give a good yield of C3H6+C3H7I, and iodine is too expensive for industrial deployment. Bromine is a more reactive oxidant but less selective towards C3H6 and C3H7Br. We show that the use of bromine–iodine mixtures with low iodine content (no greater than 20 %) results in up to 80 % of C3H6+C3H7X single-pass yield at moderate reaction temperatures (<800 K). The results are promising for developing a low temperature on-purpose propylene technology. Furthermore, the underlying chemistry might be extended to the synthesis of many other commercially desirable unsaturated hydrocarbons.
Introduction
Most of the current propylene production is performed by steam cracking (SC) and fluidic catalytic cracking (FCC).1 However, in both the SC and FCC processes, propylene is produced as a by-product and the selectivity and yields are always low.2 The availability of ethane as a major component of natural gas at natural gas prices has attracted many ethylene producers to utilize ethane instead of naphtha as the feedstock in steam crackers. As a result, the ratio of propylene/ethylene produced from steam crackers continues to decline. At the same time, driven by the expanding polypropylene market, the demand ratio of propylene/ethylene is increasing. For these reasons, it becomes increasingly important to develop on-purpose propylene production technologies that offer higher propylene/ethylene production ratios.1
Propane dehydrogenation has long been thought to be an ideal route for propylene production because of the theoretical high propylene selectivity and low capital investment, as well as the independence of the propylene production cost to naphtha price. Propane is commercially available from two major sources: petroleum refining and natural gas processing (natural gas usually contains 1–4 % of propane by volume3). Compared to methane and ethane, propane is more easily transported. For this reason, most of the propane produced is used as a fuel for industrial and domestic heating. However, propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamics, so that very high reaction temperatures on the order of 1000 K are required to give a high single-pass propane conversion.2, 4 Hence, the separation of the resulting hydrogen and unreacted propane from propylene becomes an issue. Despite these disadvantages, several propane dehydrogenation processes have been commercialized, including the Catofin process developed by Lummus and the Oleflex process developed by UOP.4 Theoretically, introducing an oxidant can drive the reaction to be more thermodynamically favorable. However, the highest propylene yield reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is only about 30 %, owing mainly to the consecutive oxidation of propylene to oxygenated products.2, 5 The oxidative dehydrogenation pathways to produce diolefins and aromatics suffer from the same issue. Although many different catalysts, promoters and alternative oxidants have been studied,2, 5, 6 a commercially viable breakthrough has yet to be achieved. The chemistry described in this work is a new pathway that increases the previous best yield of ≈30 % for propane conversion to propylene to ≈80 %.
One possible alternative is to produce propylene through a halogen route, as illustrated in Figure 1. Propane reacts readily with halogens, producing propyl halides. A subsequent elimination process produces propylene and hydrogen halides.7 The resulting hydrogen halides can be oxidized back to halogens and recycled.7, 8 Among the halogens, F2 is inappropriate because of its high reactivity and the unfavorable thermodynamics for its use in a halogenation–dehydrohalogenation process. Similarly, Cl2 reactions with alkanes are always fast and non-selective, and under some conditions an explosion may occur.9 I2 reacts selectively, but relatively slowly, with propane at low temperatures to produce propyl iodides and propylene. High propylene yields can be achieved with stoichiometric I2 and propane feeding.10 However, this reaction is only thermodynamically favorable at high temperatures (Figure S1). Furthermore, as a stoichiometric reaction of I2 with propane is needed, the recycling efficiency of the relatively expensive I2 greatly limits the potential industrial application of this process.11 Figure S1 summarizes the thermodynamics and energy profiles of propane halogenation reactions. Compared to chlorine and iodine, reactions of bromine with propane are more feasible. However, to resolve the polyhalogenation selectivity issue in gaseous alkane bromination processes, a higher propane to bromine ratio is required to avoid the formation of 2,2-C3H6Br2.7 Consequently, single-pass propane conversion, using present technology, has limited utility.

Illustration of halogen-mediated propane to propylene process.
In our previous efforts to solve the dibromomethane selectivity issue in the bromine based methane conversion to petrochemicals process, we discovered that iodine efficiently catalyzed the reaction between propane and dibromomethane with highly selectivity and production of propylene and methyl bromide.8b Thereby, we proposed a low-cost, integrated on-purpose propylene technology using methane and propane as feedstocks. However, the overall propylene yield is limited by the methyl bromide-to-propylene conversion, which is analogous to the methanol-to-propylene process. To reduce the complexity and the potential capital cost of the propylene production, we aimed to use propane alone as the feedstock.
In this paper, we report a dual halogen process for the high yield, single-pass conversion of propane to C3H6+C3H7X (X=Br, I). The C3H7X that is formed is readily converted to propylene. The selectivity is significantly improved by the presence of even small amounts of iodine. This is a low temperature (<800 K) process that avoids all of the issues described above if either bromine or iodine is the sole halogenation agent. We show how the interplay between bromine and iodine plays an important role in oxidative dehydrogenation.
Results and Discussion
Ideally, a propane/bromine molar ratio of 1 is required to convert all the propane to propyl bromide or propylene. For this reason the propane/bromine molar ratio was fixed at 1 in this study. Initial control experiments were performed on propane bromination without I2, the results of which are presented in Figures S2, 2 a, and 3. Propane conversion with bromine alone increases with reaction temperature and finally reaches a constant value of approximately 66 %. At 523 K, propane is highly selectively converted to 2-C3H7Br, but with a low conversion (10 %). Significant amounts of polybrominated products, mainly 2,2-C3H6Br2, appear at reaction temperatures above 573 K [Reactions (1)–(5)]. If the reaction temperature is increased further to 673 K, C3H7Br and 2,2-C3H6Br2 start to decompose, giving C3H6 and CH2CBrCH3 [Reactions (6) and (7)]. CH2CBrCH3 further decomposes to C3H4 (allene and propyne) at even higher reaction temperatures [Reaction (8)]. As the reaction temperature is increased, the selectivity for C3H6+C3H7Br drops first and then slightly increases and finally reaches a constant value of approximately 70 %. Plotting the C3H6+C3H7Br selectivities against the propane conversions, one can see that the maximum C3H6+C3H7Br yield is less than 50 % (Figure 3)., , , , , , ,

To produce high-purity C3H6 using only bromine as a halogenation reactant, C3H7Br needs to be separated out of the stream and then fed into another reactor.7 Furthermore, compared to halocarbons, C3H6 is difficult to efficiently separate from C3H8. Thus, 573 K seems to be the best bromination temperature. Unfortunately, at this temperature the formation of 2,2-C3H6Br2 reduces the carbon and bromine efficiencies for the overall process.
The formation of 2,2-C3H6Br2 is similar to the formation of CH2Br2 in methane bromination. As described in previous work,8 the presence of CH2Br2 is one of the main obstacles hindering the industrial application of a bromine based gas-to-liquid technology. It was found that small amounts of iodine can catalyze the reaction between CH2Br2 and C3H8 to produce CH3Br and C3H6.8b Iodine can also improve the methane conversion and CH3Br selectivity in the methane bromination process, as iodine catalyzes the reaction between CH2Br2 and CH4, producing more CH3Br.8c
Inspired by the iodine catalysis effect in the methane bromination process, we expected that similar chemistry should exist in the C3H8 bromination process. We studied next the influence of iodine in the C3H8 bromination process. The C3H8/Br2 molar ratio was kept at 1 and the I2/Br2 ratio, reaction temperature, and residence time were varied. The results are given in Figures 2–3, 4 and S3–S5. With an I2/Br2 ratio of 1:9, the conversions of C3H8 and selectivities for C3H6+C3H7X at low reaction temperatures (573 and 673 K) are similar to results obtained in the absence of I2 (Figure 3 a). Further increasing the reaction temperature leads to dramatic differences in the C3H8 conversions and C3H6+C3H7X selectivities with and without I2. As mentioned above, both C3H8 conversion and C3H6+C3H7X selectivity reach constant values above 723 K without I2. Interestingly, and in contrast, in the presence of I2, both C3H8 conversion and C3H6+C3H7X selectivity increase with reaction temperature. At 773 K, only 66 % of C3H8 is converted with C3H6+C3H7X selectivity of 71 % without I2, whereas, in the presence of I2 (with an I2/Br2 ratio of 1:9), 84 % of the C3H8 is converted with a C3H6+C3H7X selectivity of 81 %. Further increasing the temperature to 798 K leads to a C3H8 conversion of 87 % with the C3H6+C3H7X selectivity of 85 % in the presence of I2, and C3H4 as a major side-product.

Increasing the I2/Br2 ratio from 1:9 to 2:8 leads to a higher conversion of C3H8 with almost the same selectivity for C3H6+C3H7X, whereas the trends of these two factors as a function of the reaction temperature are similar. A C3H8 conversion of 97 % with a C3H6+C3H7X selectivity of 84 % was achieved at 798 K with the I2/Br2 ratio of 2:8. The C3H6+C3H7X selectivities are plotted against propane conversions in Figure 3 b, and one can see that the maximum C3H6+C3H7X yield in the presence of I2 is well above 80 %.
To explore the origin of the iodine promoting effects in the C3H8 bromination process, several control experiments were performed. We first focused on the reaction between 2,2-C3H6Br2 and C3H8. Control experiments on the 2,2-C3H6Br2+C3H8 reaction showed that 2,2-C3H6Br2 is too reactive against C3H8 (Figure S6 and S7). 2,2-C3H6Br2 decomposes quickly into CH2CBrCH3 and C3H4 in high conversions at higher temperatures with or without a heterogeneous catalyst, but the C3H8 conversion remains lower than 10 %. As stated above, iodine effectively catalyzes the reaction between CH2Br2 and C3H8/CH4.8b, 8c Iodine mainly abstracts bromine from CH2Br2, whereas bromine abstracts hydrogen from C3H8/CH4. Introducing a small amount of iodine (I2/2,2-C3H6Br2 molar ratio of 3:97) certainly accelerates the reaction between 2,2-C3H6Br2/CH2CBrCH3 and C3H8 (Figure S8). However, the conversion of C3H8 is lower than that in the CH2Br2+C3H8 system using the same amount of I2.8b Although the exact bond dissociation energy (BDE) of the CBr bonds in 2,2-C3H6Br2 is not known, we estimate that the value is somewhat close to that of CH2Br2 (≈66 kcal mol−1).12 From our previous work,8b we determined that bromine atom abstraction by iodine radicals requires a high temperature (773 K in case of CH2Br2). However, such a high reaction temperature leads to the decomposition of 2,2-C3H6Br2, producing CH2CBrCH3. As the CBr bond in CH2CBrCH3 has a much higher BDE (≈80 kcal mol−1), the bromine abstraction becomes even harder. This explains the lower conversion of C3H8 in 2,2-C3H6Br2+C3H8 system relative to that in CH2Br2+C3H8 system.
The influence of residence time on the C3H8 bromination process was also studied. Changing the residence time is equivalent to changing the size of the reactor and keeping the flow constant. It can be seen in Figure 4 and S5 that a longer residence time leads to slightly higher C3H8 conversion and C3H6+C3H7X selectivity. From the product distributions one can clearly see that the percentage increases of C3H6+C3H7X are approximately equal to the percentage decreases of C3H8+C3H5Br. This can be ascribed to the iodine-catalyzed C3H8 reaction with C3H5Br (Figure S8). The iodine-catalyzed C3H8 reaction with C3H5Br giving C3H6 and C3H7X is one of the reasons for the higher C3H8 conversions and C3H6+C3H7X selectivities of C3H8 bromination in the presence of I2.
Notably, the contribution of 2-C3H7Br decreases with reaction temperature and residence time, whereas the contribution of 2-C3H7I goes in the opposite direction (Figure 2 and S3–S5). As 2-C3H7I decomposes faster than 2-C3H7Br, it is not reasonable that 2-C3H7I remains in the outlet stream, whereas 2-C3H7Br does not. The most likely explanation is that the observed 2-C3H7I in the outlet stream was formed in the cooling region between the reactor and NaOH/organic bi-phase trap, through the addition of HI to C3H6. The amount of 2-C3H7I is proportional to the concentrations of HI and C3H6 and residence time in the cooling region. Higher temperature accelerates reaction 9 in the forward direction so that more HI and 2-C3H7I are formed.

As the ⋅Br-radical abstraction of hydrogen from C3H8 is several orders of magnitude faster than the abstraction of hydrogen from C3H8 by the ⋅I radical,8b reaction 11 does not make a significant contribution if Br2 is present. Instead, reaction 2 is the main route for the generation of the ⋅CH(CH3)2 radical. After the ⋅CH(CH3)2 radical is formed, it can be trapped both by Br2 and I2, giving 2-C3H7Br and 2-C3H7I respectively, which further decomposes into C3H6. 2-C3H7I decomposes faster than 2-C3H7Br. In addition to Br2 and I2, IBr is also likely present during propane dehydrogenation [Reaction (14)]. It has been shown that the reaction between a radical and an interhalogen molecule XY (ICl, BrCl and IBr) will always favor attack on the less electronegative atom of XY.13 For this reason, 2-C3H7I instead of 2-C3H7Br is more likely to be formed on reaction of the ⋅CH(CH3)2 radical with IBr [Reaction (15)].
(14)
(15)
Another possible way for the ⋅CH(CH3)2 radical to evolve into C3H6 is by reacting ⋅CH(CH3)2 radical with ⋅Br and ⋅I radicals, as shown in Reactions (16) and (17).10b, 14 These two aspects, the trapping of ⋅CH(CH3)2 radical by I2 and IBr to form 2-C3H7I [Reactions (12) and (15)] and the dehydrogenation of ⋅CH(CH3)2 radical by ⋅I radical to form C3H6 [Reaction (17)], both contribute to the acceleration of C3H6 formation with the addition of I2.,
(16)
(17)
Based on our results shown in Figures 2 a and S2, we know that the main side-reaction of C3H8 bromination is the consecutive bromination of 2-C3H7Br to 2,2-C3H6Br2. The introduction of I2 into the bromine halogenation process accelerates the formation of C3H6, which is in competition with the formation of 2,2-C3H6Br2. The result is a higher selectivity to C3H6+C3H7X.
Conclusions
We have studied C3H8 dehydrogenation by bromine with and without iodine. A small amount of I2 (I2/Br2 ratio no greater than 2:8) results in up to 80 % single-pass C3H6+C3H7X yield at 798 K. The yields presented here are much higher than those reported in the traditional ODH processes, which are no greater than 30 %. Compared to the less-selective bromine process and the high-temperature, expensive iodine process, a dual halogen process involving both bromine and iodine displays the advantages of both halogens. The results are particularly promising for developing a low-temperature on-purpose, high-yield propylene technology. Furthermore, the underlying chemistry might be extended to the high yield syntheses of many other unsaturated hydrocarbons, including olefins, diolefins, and aromatics.10, 15
Experimental Section
The reactions were conducted in an atmospheric pressure glass tube reactor system, which is identical with that in our previous work.8a, 8b The configuration of the reaction system is shown in Figure S9. C3H8, HBr and Ar flow rates were controlled by mass flow controllers. I2 was dissolved in Br2 or 2,2-C3H6Br2 and delivered by syringe pump. The liquid reactant was vaporized in the head space of the reactor. The effluent stream from the reactor was passed through a fritted glass bubbler trap containing organic solution (10 wt % octadecane in hexadecane) and 4 M NaOH solution, all remaining gaseous products were collected in a gas bag after passing through a final base trap (4 M NaOH solution) to prevent any residual HBr/HI from entering the bag. For most of the experiments, reactions were run for half an hour with all the products collected and analyzed. The products were analyzed by using three GCs equipped with flame ionization detectors and capillary columns, which measured: 1) gaseous halocarbons including C3H5Br and C3H7Br (HP-PLOT Q and DB-624, Agilent); 2) gaseous hydrocarbon C1-C6 (Select Al2O3 MAPD, Varian); and 3) liquid halocarbon products (DB-17, Agilent). All the experiments reported here have carbon balances of 95–105 %.
