Graphical Abstract
A catalyst design consisting of the double-decoration of nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa with Pb and Ca was applied to produce an ultra-stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at a high temperature. PtGa−Ca−Pb/SiO2 exhibited outstanding catalytic stability in PDH at 600 °C, and almost no deactivation was observed for up to 1 month.
Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is a promising chemical process that can satisfy the increasing global demand for propylene. However, the Pt-based catalysts that have been reported thus far are typically deactivated at ≥600 °C by side reactions and coke formation. Thus, such catalysts possess an insufficient life. Herein, we report a novel catalyst design concept, namely, the double decoration of PtGa intermetallics by Pb and Ca, which synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects on the catalyst stability, respectively. Pb is deposited on the three-fold Pt3 sites of the PtGa nanoparticles to block them, whereas Ca, which affords an electron-enriched single-atom-like Pt1 site, is placed around the nanoparticles. Thus, PtGa−Ca−Pb/SiO2 exhibits an outstandingly high catalytic stability, even at 600 °C (kd=0.00033 h−1, τ=3067 h), and almost no deactivation of the catalyst was observed for up to 1 month for the first time.

Propylene is one of the most essential basic raw materials in the chemical industry that is suddenly scarce and demanded for the shale gas revolution.1-3 Among the propylene production processes, on-purpose propylene production via catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has attracted tremendous interest as a strategy for satisfying the growing global demand for propylene. Pt is widely utilized for alkane, including propane, dehydrogenation because of its high performance in C−H scissions and relatively low performance in C−C cleavage. However, a high reaction temperature (>600 °C) is required to obtain sufficient propylene yield because of the high endothermicity of PDH. Thus, the Pt-based catalysts are inevitably deactivated by coking and/or nanoparticle sintering at such a high temperature and must be regenerated in short cycles. In this context, the development of a perfectly stable catalytic system that does not require regeneration, even at >600 °C, is a great challenge, yet highly attractive for practical applications. Although several researchers have attempted to resolve this challenge, no catalyst has been reported, which exhibits month-long stability for PDH at >600 °C. Therefore, to achieve this milestone, an innovative catalyst design must be developed to completely inhibit the occurrences of undesired side reactions.
The geometric and electronic effects are known to be pivotal to most catalytic systems, including the PDH one. Regarding the geometric effect, a catalyst design that is based on the alloying of Pt is generally applied. Furthermore, PDH is a structure-insensitive reaction, whereas, side reactions, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization, and polymerization, are structure-sensitive reactions.1-3 Moreover, since large Pt−Pt ensembles are well-known activators of undesired side reactions, the dilution of such ensembles (also known as the “ensemble effect”) by alloying Pt with inactive metals such as Sn,4-6 Ga,7-9 In,10 and Zn11, 12 has been generally applied to prevent side reactions. The ensemble effect can also be maximized by completely isolating the Pt atoms by the second metals, thus favoring the first and second C−H scissions, whereas the subsequent C−H scission would be successfully inhibited.8, 13, 14 J. Gong et al. designed an isolated Pt site utilizing a Pt−Cu single-atom alloy (SAA), which exhibited high stability at 520 °C.13 However, the Pt−Cu SAA catalyst was severely deactivated at 600 °C by nanoparticle sintering. Thus, materials possessing isolated Pt sites with high thermal stability should be utilized for continuous working at a high temperature (≥600 °C).8, 10, 15-21 In the previous study, we observed that an isolated Pt atom (single-atom-like Pt, Pt1) included in thermally stable intermetallic PtGa (Pt:Ga=1:1, Space group of P213)22 functioned as a highly selective and durable active site for PDH without sintering even at 600 °C.8 Although PtGa contains the isolated Pt1 and Pt3 ensembles at the most stable (111) surface, the latter can be selectively blocked by Pb decoration (Scheme 1).

Catalyst design concept of the double decoration of the nanoparticulate intermetallic PtGa supported on SiO2. The synergy of the geometric and electronic effects is expected to greatly enhances propylene selectivity and the stability of the catalyst.
As well as the geometric property, the electronic properties of Pt contribute to the adsorption strength of propylene on the Pt site. For instance, an increase in the electron density of Pt induces its electrostatic repulsion to propylene, thereby promoting propylene desorption and improving stability.23-25 Hence, tuning the electronic properties of Pt can be another approach for increasing the lifetime of PDH catalysts. Therefore, the double modification of PtGa to synergize the geometric and electronic promotion effects can be a promising catalyst design concept to construct an ultra-stable catalytic system for PDH. Crucially, the considered geometric and electronic effects for the double decoration concept should be compatible and not change the parent PtGa intermetallic structure. Scheme 1 shows a possible approach that satisfies this guideline. The surface of the intermetallic PtGa nanoparticles on SiO2 was decorated with Pb for the geometric modification to block the Pt3 sites. Pb remains at the surface of PtGa and is not diffused into the PtGa bulk, even at a high temperature, because of its large atomic size and the high thermal stability of PtGa.8 Moreover, a certain alkali or alkaline earth cation, such as Ca2+,26-28 is deposited around the PtGa nanoparticles as an electron-donating agent. Notably, such a cation that exhibits high ionization tendency is not easily reduced and alloyed with PtGa. Hence, the resulting electron-enriched Pt1 site is expected to function as an ideal active site that can almost perfectly suppress side reactions in PDH.
In this study, we report a novel catalyst design concept, the “double decoration of intermetallics,” where PtGa was modified with Pb and Ca. This strategy enabled the synergy of the geometric and electronic promotion effects without changing the parent PtGa structure, thereby affording, for the first time, an innovative catalyst with outstandingly high catalytic stability in PDH for up to 1 month at 600 °C.
First, we prepared and characterized PtGa−Ca/SiO2 to elucidate the effect of Ca. High-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image of PtGa−Ca and its particle size distribution are shown in Figure S1. The nanoparticles with a mean particle size of 2.4±0.5 nm were uniformly distributed. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis revealed that Pt and Ga co-existed in each nanoparticle in a ratio of ≈1:1 (Figures 1 a and b). The quantitative analysis on the EDX maps revealed that the Ca ratio became much higher when the surrounding areas of nanoparticles were included (odd No. ≫ even No., Figure 1 b). The high-resolution (HR) HAADF-STEM image (Figure 1 c) revealed an ordered crystal structure with interplanar distances of 1.98 Å and 2.29 Å and a dihedral angle (56°), which agree with those of the (211) and (20 ) planes of intermetallic PtGa that were viewed along the [1 2] direction (Figure 1 d). These results indicate that Ca is present at the metal-support interface rather than on nanoparticles and does not change the bulk structure of intermetallic PtGa. To obtain further structural information, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) analysis was performed (refer to Figure S2 and Table S1 for the extended XAFS (EXAFS) oscillations and summarized curve fitting, respectively). Pt−Ga scattering with 2.47 Å was observed, and this is consistent with the interatomic distance of the closest Pt and Ga atoms in intermetallic PtGa (2.50 Å).22 Similar results were also obtained for the undecorated PtGa/SiO2 catalyst (Figure S3 and Table S1). Furthermore, Figures 1 e and 1f show the Pt LIII- and Ga K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of PtGa and PtGa−Ca, respectively. The absorption edge in Pt LIII-edge XANES shifted to lower energy than that of PtGa, indicating the electron donation from Ca to Pt upon Ca decoration.29 Contrarily, the white line intensity of Ga K-edge XANES slightly increased upon Ca decoration, indicating that a part of Ga had been oxidized. This is probably due to the formation of a Ga−O−Ca linkage and suggests the close contact of the PtGa nanoparticles with the CaO species. Note that the Ca decoration did not decrease Pt dispersion (Table S2); therefore, the active Pt sites are still open for reaction despite the close contact with CaO.

Next, we prepared the doubly decorated PtGa−Ca−Pb/SiO2 catalyst and thoroughly analyzed its structure. The HAADF-STEM-EDX analysis revealed that the particles size, Pt−Ga elemental distribution, and the bulk crystal structure were similar to those of PtGa−Ca/SiO2 (2.2±0.5 nm, Pt:Ga≈1:1, and intermetallic PtGa, respectively (Figures 1 g–i, and S4)), thus confirming that the parent PtGa structure was retained (not changed). The formation of the intermetallic PtGa phase was also suggested by EXAFS curve fitting (Table S1: Pt-Ga, 2.46 Å). The quantitative analysis on the EDX map revealed that the Ca ratio was higher when the surrounding areas was included (odd No. ≫ even No.) as observed for PtGa−Ca, whereas the Pb ratio did not change (Figures 1 h,i, and S4). Therefore, unlike the Ca species, Pb atoms seem to be present mainly on the surface of PtGa. This result was also supported by the change in the dispersions of Pt, as shown in Figure 1 j and Table S2. Pt dispersion was not changed by Ca modification, although it was reduced by Pb deposition, which strongly suggests that Pb was deposited on some of the Pt sites,8 whereas Ca was not. A similar trend was observed in the distribution of Pb in PtGa−Pb (Figure S5 and Table S2). The electron density of Pt was higher in PtGa−Ca−Pb than in PtGa−Pb, as observed in Pt LIII-edge XANES (Figure S6). This result is consistent with the aforementioned trend between PtGa and PtGa−Ca. Similarly, the Ga K-edge XANES analysis revealed the slight oxidation of Ga probably because of its close contact with Ca (Ga−O−Ca interaction, Figure S6). These results indicate that PtGa−Pb can be modified by Ca similarly to PtGa. Thereafter, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy with CO adsorption was conducted at −196 °C to obtain information about the surface structure (Figure 1 k). The PtGa−Ca catalyst exhibited absorption bands, which were assignable to the stretching vibrations of CO that was adsorbed on the Pt3 sites, and a small shoulder that corresponds to CO on the Pt1 sites,8 which is similar to that of the PtGa catalyst. However, the peak position of PtGa−Ca was at a lower wavenumber than that of PtGa and indicated the electron donation from the interfacial CaO to the surface Pt. Conversely, only CO that was adsorbed on the Pt1 sites appeared in PtGa−Ca−Pb, thus supporting the blockage of Pt3 sites and the exposure of the Pt1 ones via Pb deposition. These results confirm that Ca located at the PtGa−SiO2 interface, whereas Pb was deposited on the surface of the PtGa nanoparticles. Thus, the electronic and geometric effects of Ca and the deposited Pb, respectively, on the catalyst are compatible because of their different locations and roles therein. Thus, we have successfully synthesized the doubly decorated intermetallic compound catalyst, in which the electron-enriched Pt1 active sites are present according to the rational catalyst design (Scheme 1).
Next, density functional theory calculations were conducted to elucidate the effect of Ca and Pb on the electronic structure of Pt and the adsorption property of the product, alkene. Figure 1 l shows the optimized model structure of the PtGa(111)−Pt1 surface modified with CaO and Pb. The CaO moiety was situated on the Ga3 hollow site with a Ca−O−Ga linkage, while the Pb atom was placed on the hollow site of the Pt3 site. Similar model without Pb deposition was also considered. The surface Pt atoms became more negatively charged upon the CaO modification, indicating the electron transfer from CaO to Pt. The electron donation was prominent at the Pt1 site (1) (Figure 1 m, charge: < −0.1). Moreover, the adsorption of ethylene as a model light alkene was considered (Figure 1 n). Upon Ca modification, the adsorption energy (Ead) increased from −1.09 to −0.75 eV, indicating promoted desorption, which is unfavorable to side reactions that form cokes. Furthermore, the density of states (DOS), which were projected on the d-orbitals of the model structures with and without CaO, were calculated (Figure S7). However, no significant difference was observed in the d-band structures, and this confirmed that the electron donation from Ca to Pt was crucial to promoting alkene desorption. Interestingly, the Pb deposition further increased Ead of ethylene (−0.47 eV), which is probably due to the steric hindrance by the large Pb atom.
Then, we tested the catalytic performances of the prepared catalysts for PDH. Figure 2 a shows the normalized C3H8 conversion, in which a considerably harsh condition was applied to investigate the stability in a short time (600 °C without co-feeding H2, refer to Figures S8 and S9 for the original catalytic performances). PtGa−Ca, which possesses electron-enriched Pt atoms, exhibited higher C3H6 selectivity and stability compared with those of PtGa. Thus, tuning the electronic property of the intermetallics was effective in prolonging the lifetime of the catalyst. Pb deposition, as well as the Ca decoration, enhanced the stability of the catalyst.8 More importantly, the combination of Pb and Ca exerted a synergistic effect on the stability of the catalyst. The mean catalyst lifetime (reciprocal deactivation constant: kd−1=τ=233 h) of PtGa−Ca−Pb was much longer than that of PtGa−Pb (τ=149 h), thus highlighting the further enhancement of the catalytic stability via the double decoration by Ca−Pb, which afforded the electron-enriched Pt1. Regarding the Pb-containing catalysts, a short induction period (≈10 h) was observed. This was probably due to the redistribution of excess Pb from a part of the Pt1 sites to the Ga sites or SiO2 support (Figure S10). Figure 2 b shows the amount of coke after 20 h of reaction (refer to Figures S11 and S12 for details). The trend of the amount of coke was very consistent with that of the catalytic stability. Notably, the catalytic performance of spent PtGa−Ca−Pb could be recovered by a simple regeneration process (O2−H2 treatment, Figure S13). The spent catalyst after regeneration process (shown in Figure S13) was evaluated and no aggregation of nanoparticles was not observed even after long-term reaction and regeneration process (Figure S14), revealing the high thermal stability against nanoparticles sintering. Despite the excellent stability of PtGa−Ca−Pb, its catalytic activity gradually decreased probably because of the thermal cracking of propane (refer to Figure S15 and S16 for the temperature and concentration dependences of the thermal cracking, respectively). Afterward, the catalytic performance of PtGa−Ca−Pb/SiO2 was tested by co-feeding H2 (a typically applied condition for PDH2) to suppress the accumulation of coke. Co-feeding H2 drastically decreased coke formation (Figure 2 b), thereby improving the catalytic stability. PtGa−Ca−Pb/SiO2 was barely deactivated for 1 month at least, thus highlighting its much greater stability compared with those of previously reported catalysts (refer to Tables S3–S6 and Figures S17,S18 for comparisons). Noteworthily, the mean catalyst life (τ=3067 h) was 2.6 times higher than the highest ever reported mean catalyst life (τ=1159 h). Finally, PtGa−Ca−Pb/SiO2 was tested in PDH at 580 °C utilizing undiluted neat C3H8 (a more industrially favorable condition, Figure S19). Therein, PtGa−Ca−Pb achieved 36.6 % initial conversion of C3H8 and retained 25.2 % conversion after 10.5 days of reaction (τ=465 h), indicating its much greater stability than that of the recently reported stable catalyst (PtLa/mz-deGa with τ=380 h).30 To the best of our knowledge, our PtGa−Ca−Pb/SiO2 catalyst afforded the highest stability in PDH under different conditions. We also tested other basic additives or supports instead of Ca or Ca−SiO2, respectively, of which results are summarized in Table S7 (refer Figures S20–26 and Table S8 for details). However, none of them showed positive effects on the catalytic activity and stability of PtGa in PDH.

In conclusion, we designed and successfully synthesized doubly decorated intermetallics applying Ca and Pb to modify the geometric and electronic characters of PtGa. Pb was deposited on the three-fold Pt (and Ga) sites of the PtGa nanoparticles, whereas Ca was placed around the nanoparticles to impart them with an electron-enriched Pt1 site (an active site for highly selective PDH). The effects of these modifications were synergistic and remarkably improved the catalytic stability in PDH. The PtGa−Ca−Pb/SiO2 catalyst exhibited much superior stability to those of reported PDH catalysts (month-long stability, even at 600 °C) was achieved. No other basic additives and supports than Ca did not work as effective modifiers for PtGa intermetallics, highlighting the specific character of Ca for the double-decoration strategy. The catalyst design concept, which was established in this study exposes a new horizon to enhance the catalytic performance of intermetallics in alkane dehydrogenation.
