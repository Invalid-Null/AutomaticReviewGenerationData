1. Introduction
Propene is one of important petrochemicals used for the production of variety of polymers and chemical intermediates, such as acrylonitrile, oxo alcohols, isopropylbenzene, acrylic acid and propylene oxide. Numerous applications stimulate a continuous growing of demand for propene, which exceeded currently 90 million tons [1]. The highest amounts of propene are produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking, however some other industrial processes (e.g. olefins metathesis, methanol based processes (MTO and MTP) and dehydrogenation of propane (DHP)) are also sources of this olefin. The DHP process is of importance especially in the regions where the cheap propane is available. In 2012 fourteen DHP installations produced about 5 million tons of propene. Nevertheless, dozens of new installations are under construction and should be finished by the end of 2018, giving additional 14 million tons of propene produced per year [2].
The endothermic process of propane dehydrogenation is limited by chemical equilibrium. Therefore, higher propane conversions require either lower pressures or higher temperatures according to the Le Chatelier’s principle. That is a reason why commercially viable conversions of propane are achieved at the reaction temperature of 550 °C or higher. The high temperature, however, favours side reactions leading to a decrease in selectivity to propene. Thus, in all commercial DHP installations a suitable catalyst is applied in order to get high selectivity toward propene at a reasonable conversion per one pass. The chromium oxide or platinum supported catalysts are the most widely applied [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. These active components are usually dispersed on a surface of various oxides (e.g. Al2O3, ZnAl2O4 or MgAl2O4) [5], but γ-Al2O3 is the most effective support. Furthermore, different alkaline metals (mainly sodium or potassium) are added to increase the resistance on coking. In the case of platinum-containing catalysts, tin is an additional important promoter that suppresses contribution of side reactions, minimizes metal sintering, neutralizes acidity of a support, and facilitates diffusion of coke species from the Pt surface to the support [2].
Numerous new catalysts, containing gallium [7], [8], [9], indium [10], gallium–indium [11], vanadium [12] and molybdenum [13], were tested in the propane dehydrogenation. More recent results have indicated that carbon based materials also exhibit the catalytic activity in the oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, including propane [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. This observation is not surprising, because various carbon materials are commonly considered as very promising catalysts of the oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene [19], [20], [21], [22]. For example, pure mesoporous carbon CMK-3, prepared by nanocasting, showed the catalytic activity comparable to that observed over the commercial catalyst containing Fe–K–Al oxides for the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation [19]. It should however be noticed that the catalytic activity of carbon materials in the conversion of light alkanes is significantly lower. A little improvement can be obtained by a modification of carbon matrix with oxygen, nitrogen or phosphorus containing functional groups, which enhance either activity or selectivity in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes [23], [24].
The main goal of this work was to investigate the catalytic performance of chromium oxide dispersed on ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-3) in the DHP process. By combination of chromium oxide phase, characterized by the high catalytic activity in DHP, and CMK-3 carbon, with the moderate catalytic activity in DHP, but providing an extremely high surface area (exceeding 1000 m2/g) and a suitable thermal stability, very promising DHP catalysts were developed. An influence of the chromium content on the catalytic performance and stability with consecutive reaction-regeneration cycles was carefully investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of mesoporous supports and catalysts
SBA-15 was synthesized under acidic conditions using Pluronic P123 triblock copolymer (EO20PO70EO20, Mav = 5800 g/mol) and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as a silica source according to the procedure described previously [25]. Briefly, 8 g of Pluronic P123 (Aldrich) was dissolved in a solution containing 60 g of distilled water and 120 g of 2 M HCl at 35 °C. The mixture was vigorously stirred until complete dissolution of Pluronic P123. Next, 17 g of TEOS (98%, Aldrich) was added dropwise to the clear solution under vigorous stirring (400 rpm). Finally, the slurry was kept under stirring at 35 °C for 20 h, and then hydrothermally treated under static conditions at 90 °C for another 24 h. The resulting white precipitate was isolated by filtration without washing, dried at 60 °C overnight and calcined in air by rising temperature from ambient to 550 °C over 9 h period and then keeping it at 550 °C for 12 h.
The obtained SBA-15 material was used as a hard template in the synthesis of CMK-3 replica. Mesoporous silica (1 g) was impregnated with a solution containing 5.00 g of water, 1.25 g of sucrose and 0.14 g of sulfuric acid [26]. The sample was dried in two steps: at 100 °C for 6 h and then at 160 °C for another 6 h. The SBA-15 containing partially polymerised and carbonised sucrose was impregnated again. In the second impregnation, a solution with 0.80 g of sucrose and 0.09 g of sulfuric acid dissolved in 3.00 g of water was used. The drying procedure was repeated. Subsequently, the dried material was calcined in flowing N2 by rising temperature (1 °C/min) up to 750 °C and an isothermal step at 750 °C for 12 h. The carbon–silica composite obtained after pyrolysis was washed two times in 10% HF solution at room temperature to remove the silica template. TG analysis by heating the CMK-3 sample (after washing with HF) to 1000 °C in the air flow showed 99.9% weight loss confirming a complete silica template removal.
Various amounts of chromium (1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40 wt.% of Cr2O3) were introduced onto the CMK-3 support by the incipient wetness method using Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (Polish Chemical Reagents, POCh) as a chromium source. Before the impregnation CMK-3 was dried at 120 °C for 12 h. Then, 1 g of the carbon replica was treated with 4.0 cm3 of an aqueous solution containing the desired amount of Cr(NO3)3. The impregnated samples were dried at room temperature overnight, then at 100 °C for 6 h and finally calcined at 600 °C for 6 h in flowing N2. The synthesized samples are denoted as Crx/CMK-3, where x is the intended Cr content. As a reference sample, the Cr20/AC material was synthesised by impregnation of commercial activated carbon (Merck, SBET = 978 m2/g) with 20 wt.% of Cr2O3 using the identical procedure like in the case of the Crx/CMK-3 catalysts.
2.2. Characterization
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at −196 °C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. Before the measurements the samples were degassed at 250 °C under vacuum. Specific surface area was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method within the relative pressure range of p/p0 = 0.10–0.25. Pore size distribution as well as micro- and mesopore volumes were determined using the equilibrium model of non-local density functional theory (NLDFT).
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the parent mesoporous materials and the catalysts were collected on a Bruker D2 Phaser instrument equipped with a LYNXEYE detector. The diffractograms were recorded using CuKα X-ray radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) in two ranges of 2θ (0.5–5° and 10–70°) with a 2θ step size of 0.02°.
The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were measured in a Prevac photoelectron spectrometer, equipped with a hemispherical VG SCIENTA R3000 analyzer, using a monochromatized aluminum AlKα source (E = 1486.6 eV). No additional charge compensation was applied. For calibration of the binding energy scale, the Au 4f7/2 signal at 84.0 eV of a clean Au surface was used. The base pressure in the analysis chamber during the measurements was 5 × 10−9 mbar. The spectra were recorded with constant pass energy of 100 eV. The composition and chemical surrounding of sample surface were investigated on the basis of the areas and binding energies of Cr 2p, O 1s and C 1s photoelectron peaks. Fitting of the high resolution spectra was provided through Casa XPS software.
The thermal stability of materials was examined with a SDT Q600 (TA Instruments) thermoanalyzer. The measurements were performed in an alumina pan using 7–14 mg of a sample in air atmosphere (a flow rate of 100 cm3 min−1) from 20 to 1000 °C at a heating rate of 20 °C/min.
Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were collected using a Merlin Gemini II microscope equipped with field emission gun (FEG). Prior to the observation the sample was vapor-deposited with carbon.
TEM images were taken on a Tecnai G2 TWIN (FEI) instrument equipped with Lanthanum Hexaboride (LaB6) cathodes. The sample was suspended in water and then deposited onto a carbon-coated copper grid.
Temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were carried out in a modified gas chromatograph, equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and connected on-line with a quartz reactor. The purified mixture of N2/H2 (95/5 vol.%, Air Liquide) served as a combined carrier and reducing gas at a total flow rate of 30 cm3 min−1. The flow rate of the reduction mixture was regulated by a mass flow controller. Before the H2-TPR experiments, all samples were dried at 120 °C for 12 h. The dry catalyst (100 mg) was preheated in the reactor in pure helium (99.999 vol.%, Linde) at 750 °C for 30 min, and then cooled down to room temperature (RT) in the He stream. During the H2-TPR measurement the temperature was raised from RT to 750 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1. The H2 consumption was measured by TCD after removal of water vapour by condensation.
2.3. Catalytic tests
The catalytic tests were carried out in a flow-type quartz reactor packed with 200 mg of a catalyst (grain size 0.2–0.3 mm, without dilution). The feed with the C3H8:He molar ratio of 1:14 was introduced into the catalytic reactor at the total flow rate (30 cm3 min−1). Before the catalytic test, the sample was pretreated in dry He (30 cm3 min−1) for 0.5 h at a reaction temperature. The catalytic runs were carried out at 500, 550 and 600 °C under atmospheric pressure. The reactants and products were analyzed on-line using an Agilent 6890N gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with two columns (Hayesep Q and Molecular Sieve 5A) and TCD. The column packed with Hayesep Q was used for the separation of H2, CO2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8, while CH4 and CO were analyzed using Molecular Sieve 5A.
Activity, specific activity, conversion of propane (Xp), yield of propene (Yp) and selectivity to products (Si) were calculated as follows:
where: Fp is a number of propane moles fed per second, Cp is conversion of propane per gram of a catalyst, nCr is a number of chromium moles per gram of a catalyst,
and
are numbers of propane moles in the reactor inlet and outlet, respectively,
is a number of propene moles in the reactor outlet, ai is a number of carbon atoms in a product, and ni is a number of moles of “i” product.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physicochemical properties of the synthesized catalysts
Fig. 1A shows the small-angle X-ray diffraction patterns of SBA-15 (hard template) and CMK-3 (replicated carbon support) with three characteristic reflections. The intense peak at low angle and two significantly weaker lines at higher angles can be indexed as the (1 0 0), (1 1 0) and (2 0 0) diffractions, respectively, which are typical of materials with the hexagonal arrangement of mesopores (space group p6 mm) [26], [27]. Such ordering indicates that the produced CMK-3 support is an inverse replica of SBA-15 hard template. The uniform pore structure of both mesoporous materials was confirmed by the TEM micrographs, while the SEM images reveal that they consist of aggregated microparticles (Fig. 1C and D). SBA-15 is built of wheat-like aggregates with rope-like domains with the uniform size of 1–2 μm, whereas CMK-3 particles have more spherical shape with diameters within the same range. The well ordered mesoporous structure of the materials was also confirmed by low temperature N2 sorption measurements (Fig. 1B). According to the IUPAC classification, the isotherms of SBA-15 and CMK-3 are of type IV characteristic of mesoporous solids. Nevertheless, both materials differ in the pore size distribution (PSD, inset to Fig. 1B). SBA-15 exhibits the presence of significantly wider pores (with the PSD maximum at 8.2 nm). In the case of CMK-3, pores with diameters close to 5.4 nm dominate. Moreover, SBET of CMK-3 is almost twice that of the template (SBA-15) indicating a contribution of micropores in the carbon matrix. Nitrogen adsorption results for the silica–carbon composite (before washing with HF) show that double impregnation blocks almost completely the mesopores of SBA-15 (Fig. 1s). The composite has however SBET = 484 m2 g−1 which can be related to the presence of micropores formed in the carbon nanorods.

The XRD patterns of the chromium containing materials are shown in Fig. 2. In the low 2θ range (0.5–5.0°) intensities of reflections characteristic for hexagonal ordering decrease gradually with the Cr loading (inset to Fig. 2A) due to filling of the pores with CrOx, which has a higher absorption factor for X-rays than carbon. A partial oxidation of carbon matrix with gaseous oxidants produced during Cr(NO3)3 decomposition (calcination steps) and/or removal of oxygen-containing groups during the thermal treatment may be additional reasons of this effect. The diffraction patterns recorded in the 2θ range of 10–70° reveal that in the fresh Crx/CMK-3 catalysts active phase exists mainly as poorly crystallized species (Fig. 2B).

Only in the samples with the highest amount of Cr (Cr30/CMK-3 and Cr40/CMK-3) very weak reflections attributed to the α-Cr2O3 phase appeared. In the case of oxide-supported chromium oxide materials reported in literature, the crystalline Cr2O3 particles were detected at much lower Cr contents compared to those studied in this work. For example, in the CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts the XRD reflections of crystalline α-Cr2O3 were found in the materials with the chromium loading of 16 wt.% of Cr2O3 or higher [28], whereas for the Cr/SiO2 catalysts—in the samples containing between 1.5 and 3.0 wt.% of Cr2O3 [25], [29], [30]. In the latter case the tendency to form Cr2O3 crystals rather than a well-dispersed phase is due to a low concentration of reactive hydroxyl groups on the silica surface. As we reported in our previous work, the exchange of commercial silica with ordered mesoporous silica (i.e. SBA-15 or SBA-1) enhances the resistance against α-Cr2O3 formation [25]. A 2–3 times higher specific surface area of mesoporous silica supports (i.e. SBA-15 and SBA-1) causes that the XRD reflections of α-Cr2O3 in the fresh samples are observed for Cr2O3 loadings of 5 wt.% for SBA-15 and 10 wt.% for SBA-1. The chemical composition and high area of CMK-3 surface may be responsible for the high dispersion of chromium and the absence of crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase in the case of the studied Crx/CMK-3 catalysts.
Fig. 3 displays the adsorption–desorption isotherms and PSD for the fresh Crx/CMK-3 materials. The isotherms of the samples with the intended Cr2O3 content up to 10 wt.% correspond to type IV as classified by IUPAC. All these isotherms exhibit capillary condensation step at relative pressures between 0.4 and 0.6, confirming uniform mesoporosity similar to that of unmodified CMK-3. For the samples with the higher Cr content the step characteristic for filling mesopores with liquid nitrogen disappeared. It should therefore be concluded that the amount of introduced Cr oxide was so high that the mesopores of CMK-3 support were completely clogged. Fig. 3B shows PSD calculated by the NLDFT model for the different chromium contents. It can be noticed that the contribution of mesopores decreases rapidly with the increase in the chromium loading. In the Cr30/CMK-3 and Cr40/CMK-3 samples mesoporosity disappears almost completely confirming the observations given by the analysis of N2 adsorption isotherms (Fig. 3A) and XRD patterns (Fig. 2A).

The XPS surface composition and textural parameters of the Crx/CMK-3 catalysts are summarized in Table 1. It is clear that the specific surface area (SBET), mesopore volume (Vmeso) and total pore volume (Vtotal) decrease gradually with raising the Cr content. Thus, impregnation of CMK-3 with the chromium salt followed by calcination under inert atmosphere reduced mesoporosity. On the other hand, the volume of micropores (Vmicro) in the Crx/CMK-3 catalysts increases slightly from 0.08 to 0.17 cm3/g with the increasing Cr content. The formation of additional microporosity can be attributed to the imperfect filing of the mesopores with the impregnate.

Fig. 4. H2-TPR profiles of fresh Crx/CMK-3 catalysts.
The TPR profiles of Crx/CMK-3 are different from those reported for Crx/SiO2 (amorphous or mesoporous), Crx/Al2O3 or Crx/ZrO2 materials [31], [32]. Generally, the profiles of chromium oxide supported on the mentioned oxides exhibit one reduction maximum in the temperature range of 350–450 °C. For example, in the profile of Cr20/SBA-15 a clear maximum at about 420 °C can be identified (Fig. 4). Such maximum is ascribed to reduction of Cr(VI) species which are directly attached to the support. The absence of this maximum indicates that the chromium species are stabilized in the reduced form in the case of the CMK-3 based materials. The only small broad maximum is observed between 250 and 300 °C. The position of this maximum coincides to the low-temperature reduction maximum observed for bulk Cr2O3 calcined in air, which is assigned to the reduction of Cr(VI) species formed on the surface of Cr2O3 particles [32], [35]. The traces of Cr(VI) species can be stabilized only when they are isolated from the carbon surface, e.g. by the Cr2O3 particles. Moreover, the results of study on the unmodified CMK-3 support by temperature-programmed desorption and FTIR spectroscopy reveal that after treatment at 750 °C in the inert atmosphere the oxygen containing groups capable of Cr species bonding are decomposed (Fig. 2s).
The surface composition of the Crx/CMK-3 catalysts was studied by XPS mainly in order to find the concentration of different forms of chromium oxide. In Fig. 5 the XPS spectra of the Cr 2p region for the chosen materials are shown. The Cr 2p3/2 peaks related to Cr(III) and Cr(VI) were found for all measured samples. The presence of Cr2O3 is manifested by the peak settled at 576.6 eV, while the Cr(VI) species give the signal at 579.1 eV [33]. The quantitative results of the XPS analysis are summarized in Table 1. It is found that the gradual increase in the Cr content on the external surface is detected with raising amount of Cr(NO3)3 used for impregnation. On the other hand, the Cr(VI)/Cr(III) atomic ratio is very stable (0.13–0.17) and only for two samples (Cr3/CMK-3 and Cr5/CMK-5) increased insignificantly to 0.27–0.28. This observation is in accordance to the previously discussed results, which showed the dominant role of amorphous Cr2O3 among the forms of Cr species present on the CMK-3 surface.

3.2. Catalytic performance
The catalytic performance of the Crx/CMK-3 materials was tested in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. Fig. 6 presents the initial yield of propene and the specific activity at 550 °C vs. the Cr2O3 loading.

Fig. 6. Variation of initial propene yield and specific activity with chromium content. Reaction conditions: Tr = 550 °C; C3H8:He molar ratio = 1:14; Total flow rate = 30 cm3 min−1; Catalyst weight = 200 mg; WHSV = 1.2 h−1; Reaction time = 10 min.
The observed correlation is similar as in the case of chromium oxides deposited on inorganic supports (Al2O3, ZrO2 or SiO2), it means that the yield of propene rises with the Cr content to the maximum value and then decreases at the higher Cr loadings. Over the Crx/CMK-3 materials the initial propene yield increases sharply to 35–40% with the Cr content up to 20 wt.% of Cr2O3. The further increase in the Cr concentration leads to the decrease of this catalytic parameter, caused mainly by partial pore blocking with the impregnate, confirmed by the rapid decrease in the textural parameters and the disappearance of XRD peaks in the low 2θ range.
It is generally accepted that only Cr(III) or/and Cr(II) sites are responsible for the catalytic activity in DHP [2], [6], [30], [34]. Moreover, nuclearity and dispersion of the chromium sites are critical factors. Thus, fully accessible for reactants, coordinatively unsaturated, isolated Cr(II)/Cr(III) sites and small amorphous Cr(III) species are the most active in DHP, while Cr(III) ions in a perfect octahedral environment, like crystalline α-Cr2O3, show no catalytic activity in this reaction [2]. Very active, dispersed Cr(II) or Cr(III) sites are generated on oxide supports in-situ by reduction of Cr(V)/Cr(VI) species, directly attached to the support surface, produced during preparation or regeneration steps under an air atmosphere [34], [35]. In the case of Crx/CMK-3 catalysts, due to the nature of CMK-3 and the non-oxidative synthesis conditions, the formation and stabilization of highly dispersed Cr(V)/Cr(VI) species is strongly limited. Therefore, the presence of relatively high amounts of Cr(III) sites allows to achieve the high catalytic performance. Moreover, the rapid decrease of the specific activity with the Cr content clearly indicates that high dispersion and accessibility of the Cr(III) sites are crucial for high activity (Fig. 6).
Fig. 7 illustrates the variations of propane conversion and selectivity to propene with time-on-stream (TOS). In the presence of each catalyst the conversion of propane decreases gradually with TOS, while at the same time the selectivity to propene rises reaching high values between 92 and 95 % after 0.5 h. The similar tendency in the conversion/selectivity vs. TOS was reported for others Cr, Pt–Sn, Ga or In containing catalysts, active in DHP [7], [9], [36]. The fast loss of conversion with TOS is caused mainly by a coke formation. In some cases, the redispersion of active compound and loss of textural parameters of support are additional reasons of deactivation [6].

Fig. 7. Variation of propane conversion (A) and selectivity to propene (B) with time-on-stream over Crx/CMK-3 catalysts. Reaction conditions: T = 550 °C; C3H8:He molar ratio = 5:14; Total flow rate = 30 cm3 min−1; Catalyst weight = 200 mg; WHSV = 1.2 h−1.
For the studied Crx/CMK-3 catalysts, the loss of conversion vs. TOS rises with the Cr loading up to 20 wt.% of Cr2O3, and the materials with the higher Cr content exhibit very similar catalytic behaviour. Such relation between the Cr content and the loss of conversion (deactivation) can be explained in terms of the substrate-product reactivity. Because alkenes are more reactive than alkanes, the rate of coke formation increases with the conversion achieved over a given catalyst in DHP. Our previous results confirmed such correlation for the silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts [37]. The increase in the propane conversion to more reactive propene led to the increase of mass of the produced coke. The formation of coke from propene during the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane was also confirmed by in-situ UV–vis DR spectroscopy. Using a catalytic reactor equipped with UV–vis diffuse reflectance probes (located at different catalyst bed heights) Nijhuis et al. [38] showed that the coke formation rate is higher at the end of the catalyst bed, where the concentration of more reactive propene is the highest. Our results for the Crx/CMK-3 catalyst are in good agreement with mentioned above observations.
Table 2 summarizes the catalytic results obtained over pure CMK-3, Cr20/CMK-3 and several promising materials reported in the literature. It is not surprising that the materials based on mesoporous carbon as the support exhibit high activity in DHP. Recently, Liu et al. evidenced activity of ordered mesoporous carbon, nanorodes and others carbon nanomaterials in DHP [18], [19], [20]. They postulated that oxygen-containing groups, present on the carbon surface, are responsible for the DHP activity like in the oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Most probably on carbonyl/quinone groups (CO), which act as electron donors, molecule of propene is produced and hydroxyl groups (COH) remain as intermediates. In the next step, the hydroxyl groups decompose (2COH → 2CO + H2) forming re-oxidized carbonyl/quinone species and gaseous hydrogen. The catalytic results, demonstrated in Table 2, indicate that deposition of chromium oxide on the CMK-3 support strongly enhances its catalytic performance in DHP. On the other hand, the catalytic parameters of chromium oxide supported on various materials (CMK-3, γ-Al2O3 or ZrO2) are similar. This suggests that the presence of Cr(II)/Cr(III) species directly attached to the surface of supports is not a crucial factor for the high DHP activity. It seems that highly dispersed amorphous Cr(III) sites are active as well. Moreover, the Cr20/CMK-3 catalyst exhibited the higher activity than the amorphous (unordered) activated carbon supported catalyst (Cr20/AC) indicating that the ordered pore structure of CMK-3 is more suitable for catalytic application. The new Cr20/CMK-3 material also showed high selectivity in DHP. At each investigated temperature primary product, propene, was produced with a high initial selectivity in the range between 82 and 93%. In addition to propene, only small amounts of lighter hydrocarbons, such as methane, ethane, and ethene, were formed. In compliance with the paper by Fridman [40], the main source of these byproducts is propene, which is converted by the hydrocracking to ethene and methane.

3.3. Regeneration of the used catalyst
The stability tests for the Cr containing materials in the temperature range of 500–600 °C showed that the catalytic activity decreases gradually with TOS due to the coke formation. In the case of DHP catalysts based on oxide supports the coke produced during dehydrogenation can easily be removed by air treatment at the reaction temperature [25], [37]. Such regeneration restores the initial activity. For the catalysts supported on CMK-3, the regeneration by air is impossible in view of a possibility of carbon burning. Fig. 8 shows the TG profiles recorded in air atmosphere for the pure CMK-3 support as well as the fresh and used catalysts containing 20 wt.% of Cr2O3.

Fig. 8. TG curves recorded for fresh CMK-3 as well as Cr20/CMK-3 before and after catalytic test.
The pristine CMK-3 starts to react with oxygen at about 400 °C, while in the case of Cr containing samples the oxidation begins at temperature as low as 250 °C. Obviously, Cr accelerates the oxidation of carbon support, that is in good agreement with the results for active carbon materials reported previously [41]. Unfortunately, an insignificant difference between TG profiles of the fresh and used samples suggests that both coke produced during DHP and carbon matrix of CMK-3 react with oxygen at a similar temperature.
Taking into account the TG results, the catalyst regeneration with air was examined during the catalytic run in the temperature range of 200–300 °C. Fig. 9 illustrates the results obtained in consecutive dehydrogenation/regeneration/purification cycles. During each regeneration/purification step (R/P) the used catalysts were treated with 150, 300 and 450 cm3 of air diluted in helium flow and then flashed with pure helium before another dehydrogenation cycle (DH).

DH conditions: T = 550 °C; C3H8:He molar ratio = 5:14; Total flow rate = 30 cm3 min−1; Catalyst weight = 200 mg. R/P conditions: Flow of helium with 150, 300 and 450 cm3 of air; total flow rate = 30 cm3 min−1 (during purification only He was used).
Each regeneration restores partially the lost catalytic activity. At 250 and 300 °C the conversion and yield in the DH step arose with the air volume injected into the reactor in the consecutive R/P cycles. In a contrast, after regeneration at 200 °C the effect of air volume injected on the catalytic performance was similar after all R/P steps. Table 3 shows the loss of conversion after last regeneration step as well as the loss of catalyst mass after all dehydrogenation/regeneration/purification cycles. The air treatment led to the loss of catalyst mass confirming clearly that during regeneration even at so low temperatures both coke and CMK-3 matrix react with oxygen. However, the loss of catalyst mass decreases with the regeneration temperature drops and after regeneration at 200 °C the mass loss of only 7% was observed. The TG results of the fresh Cr20/CMK-3 (Fig. 8) showed about 3–5% loss of catalysts mass below 150 °C caused by physical desorption. Therefore, it can be concluded that the regeneration at 200 °C leads to a negligible destruction of CMK-3 support, and may restore partially the catalytic activity with a small loss of catalyst mass. The promising effect of low-temperature regeneration with air needs however a further investigation. Especially, the optimal oxygen content and regeneration time as well as the mass balance in consecutive DH and R/P steps should be investigated more carefully.

4. Conclusion
The catalysts containing different amounts of Cr supported on mesoporous CMK-3 carbon were prepared. It was proven that impregnation with chromium nitrate followed by thermal decomposition in inert atmosphere had a slight effect on the CMK-3 structure. Nevertheless, at the high Cr loadings the introduced species blocked the pore system. The high-temperature and non-oxidative pretreatment conditions led to the weak stabilization of Cr species by the direct interaction with the support and the absence of crystalline α-Cr2O3. Thus, amorphous Cr2O3 was a dominant form present on the CMK-3 surface. Only a small contribution of Cr(VI) species was identified by H2-TPR and XPS.
The Crx/CMK-3 materials exhibited an excellent catalytic performance in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. The catalytic activity observed in the initial period of the reaction was the highest over the Cr20/CMK-3 sample, which also exhibited very high selectivity to propene. The decrease in the propane conversion was observed with time-on-stream, caused by the formation of coke. The attempts of regeneration of spent catalysts with air pulses showed very promising results. However, the regeneration temperature has to be limited due to carbon support oxidation which accelerates at higher temperatures. Therefore, the appropriate regeneration method for CMK-3 based catalysts (and other carbon materials tested in DHP) seems to be crucial.
