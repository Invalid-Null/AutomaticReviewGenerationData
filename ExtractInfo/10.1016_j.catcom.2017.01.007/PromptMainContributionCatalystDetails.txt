Direct conversion of ethylene to propene over Ni impregnated by incipient wetness on silica-alumina




1. Introduction
Propene represents one of the most wanted starting materials for the polymer industry and its demand in polypropylene production is growing continuously. Steam and catalytic cracking of crude oil and natural gas deliver the great part of ethylene and propene worldwide. Nowadays crackers in petroleum refining plants are optimized to produce as high propene to ethylene ratio as possible; however, propene demand is still higher [1]. Therefore, scientific and industrial interest has been devoted to find alternative outgoing materials and to develop catalysts and technologies for propene production like: (i) propane dehydrogenation [2], [3], [4], [5], (ii) methanol to propene (MTP) [6], [7], (iii) selective dehydrogenation of bioethanol ([8] and ref. therein) and (iv) olefin metathesis of ethylene with butene to propene [9], [10], [11].
Simultaneously, an increased scientific attention has been paid on using surplus ethylene from cracking. An attractive alternative provides the direct conversion of ethylene to propene (EtP). HZSM-5 produced propene and butenes from ethylene thanks to acidic sites and shape-selectivity of the zeolite [12]. By combining Ni-catalyst for ethylene dimerization and a metathesis catalyst (supported oxides of Mo [13] or Re [14]) propene can be produced in a two-step process. Direct propene formation from ethylene on W-H/Al2O3 catalyst was reported by the group of Basset [15], [16]. All steps of the reaction proceed at the same active site, which is single tungsten hydride species. Iwamoto et al. published the direct reaction of ethylene to propene on Ni template-ion exchanged mesoporous silica (MCM-41) [17], [18], [19]. The authors suggested a three step reaction: (i) dimerization of ethylene to 1-butene on Ni centers, (ii) isomerization of 1-butene to 2-butene on acidic sites and (iii) metathesis reaction of 2-butene with unreacted ethylene to propene on a Ni(III) carbene. Seidel-Morgenstern et al. evaluated Ni-MCM-41 and Ni-AlMCM-41 catalysts prepared by equilibrium adsorption in EtP reaction and found out that the catalyst with 4–5% Ni incorporated in a matrix with Si/Al = 60 features the best catalytic performance in EtP with propene yield of 14.8% [20], [21]. The authors underlined the importance of optimum aluminum content incorporated into MCM matrix for high catalytic activity; Ni on pure MCM-41 shows only low activity. Ni on AlMCM-48 has shown to be also active for the reaction [22]. Ni phyllosilicate layered structure was identified in the catalysts by different groups [23], [24], [25], [26], [27] and was supposed to be the catalytically active phase for the dimerization and metathesis steps of the reaction.
The results reported so far show that an active catalyst needs two functions: (i) Ni-containing phyllosilicate phase in ordered mesoporous support for ethylene dimerization and metathesis and (ii) acidic sites with optimal strength (Al sites in the pore walls) for butene isomerization. We report here about simply prepared catalysts that contain NiOx on the surface of acidic silica-alumina. The acidity was modified by changing Si/Al ratio. For comparison, a Ni-AlMCM-41 was synthesized by template-ion exchange and tested under the same reaction conditions.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Catalyst preparation
We used commercially available silica-alumina supports with silica content varying from 10 to 87 wt.% (Siral®-10, -40, -70 from SASOL and silica-alumina with Si/Al = 6.7 from Sigma Aldrich). Ni from aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Merck) in amount of 1 and 5 wt.% was impregnated onto the dried supports using incipient wetness technique. The catalysts were dried at 90 °C for at least 6 h and calcined in air at 550 °C (rate 5 K·min− 1) for 12 h. The synthesized samples are denoted as xNi-S87,-S70,-S40,-S10, where x stands for Ni loading in wt.%, the number behind S points silica weight percentage and the balance to 100 is alumina content in the support material. For comparison, Ni containing AlMCM-41 (denoted hereafter by 5Ni-AlMCM) catalyst consisting of 5 wt.% Ni, 98.4 wt.% Si and 1.6 wt.% Al was synthesized according to [21], [28] using a template-ion exchange method.
2.2. Characterization of catalysts
Nitrogen adsorption isotherms collected at 77 K on BELSORP-mini II (BEL Japan) were used to calculate the specific surface area (SBET) of the calcined catalysts and of the bare supports applying the Brunauer, Emmet and Teller (BET) equation for N2 relative pressure in the range of 0.05 < P/P0 < 0.30. The pore size distribution was derived from the desorption branch using the BJH method. The nickel content was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP–OES, Varian 715-ES). XRD powder patterns were recorded on a Panalytical X'Pert diffractometer equipped with a RTMS detector (X'Celerator), automatic divergence slits and Cu Kα1/α2 radiation (40 kV, 40 mA). The TEM measurements were performed at 200 kV with an aberration-corrected JEM-ARM200F (JEOL, Corrector: CEOS). Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed in a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument. More information about sample characterization, measurement conditions and apparatus specification is given in electronic supplementary information (ESI).
2.3. Catalytic activity tests
The activity of the catalysts was measured in a 15-channel apparatus equipped with automated control of gas flows and of three temperature zones (gas pre-heating, reactor, and post reactor lines). Multiport-valves located at the reactor input and output position allows switching feed gas flow and product sampling from one reactor to the next as described elsewhere [29]. To ensure plug flow condition, all catalysts were sieved in fraction of 250–600 μm and filled in quartz reactors (4 mm i.d.). Reactor bed length accounts for 88–105 mm. Parallel pre-treatment of all catalysts in air with flow rate of 10 mL·min− 1·channel− 1 was applied for 2 h at 550 °C (ramp of 10 K·min− 1). Afterwards the system was cooled down to reaction temperature (375 °C) under dried N2 flow. The reaction was carried out using feed gas mixture of ethylene (99.9%, Linde) and N2 (99.999%, Linde) in ratio 10:90 vol.% and total flow rate of 17.5 mL·min− 1·channel− 1. GHSV was varied by using different catalyst masses. During the EtP reaction performed in one reactor all other reactors were kept under N2 flow. The composition of the reaction gas was analyzed online by an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph. Details of GC configuration and calculation of conversion, yields, selectivities and space-time yields (STY) are given in ESI.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
With increasing Si content in the carrier matrix the surface area increased as well except S70. Once modified with Ni, a decrease in the specific surface area was observed for all catalysts (Table 1). Ni catalysts preserved relatively high specific surface area after calcination. For Ni-SiAlOx catalysts neither 1 nor 5 wt.% Ni loading affected considerably the texture of carrier. The adsorption-desorption isotherms of 1 and 5 wt.% Ni-SiAlOx samples were very similar exhibiting Type IV-isotherm with H3-type hysteresis loop, typical for materials with plate-like particles [30] inducing slit-shaped pores (Fig. S1 in ESI). On the contrary, 5Ni-AlMCM showed a two-step adsorption isotherm demonstrating the existence of a bimodal pore-size distribution with maxima at radii 1.8 and 10.0 nm, whereas pure MCM-41 exhibits single pore-size distribution centered at 1.8 nm. The first part corresponds to Type I (Langmuir) isotherm accounting for the micropores probably in the mesopore walls of AlMCM, and the second part, with a hysteresis loop, accounts for the AlMCM-mesopores. The latter hysteresis shape belongs to H4-type, which is mostly associated with narrow slit-like pores. This presence of “parallel layered narrow slit channels” supports the assumption that Ni-phyllosilicate structure was formed during 5Ni-AlMCM synthesis according to [21], [28].

The diffraction pattern of 5Ni-AlMCM shows a phyllosilicate layered structure with embedded Ni, [Ni3Si2O5(OH)4], as it can be seen from Fig. 1. This finding confirms that the layered structure of this catalyst described in literature was be reproduced. On this catalyst crystalline nickel oxide was detected as well. Interestingly, none of the Ni impregnated SiAlOx samples showed phyllosilicate-like structure, independent from Si content in the support. 5Ni-AlMCM, 5Ni-S70 and 5Ni-S40 (traces) contain NiO phase, whereas in 5Ni-S40 and 5Ni-S10 Al2O3 is the predominant phase. The signal at 36° could be a weak indication for the existence of a NiAl2O4 spinel phase.

Fig. 1. XRD patterns of impregnated Ni-SiAlOx samples and template-ion exchanged Ni-AlMCM.
The reduction profiles of selected Ni-SiAlOx catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. The measurements were done in order to distinguish the strength of interaction between the oxidized Ni species and carrier matrices with different Si/Al ratio. In all samples at 900 °C NiO is fully reduced to Ni as shown by the total amount of consumed H2 (Table 1). For catalysts with 5 wt.% Ni loading with increasing amount of alumina in the SiAlOx matrix the maximum of reduction peak (Tmax) is shifted to higher temperature and follows the order: 5Ni-S10 > 5Ni-S40 > 5Ni-S70. The reduction peak between 760 °C and 800 °C is assigned to NiO that have strong interaction to the support [31], [32] or to amorphous Ni silicate/aluminate [33]. The TPR peak of 5Ni-S10 possesses a shoulder at high temperature indicating reduction of a second NiO species strongly interacting with the support which is believed to be NiAl2O4. According to literature, this phase gives a peak above 700 °C [31] or above 800 °C [32]. For the catalysts with 1 wt.% Ni loading similar behavior was observed, however, a second reduction peak appeared as shoulder at slightly higher temperature indicating presence of NiO species stronger linked to the support. Catalysts with higher portion of silica in the carrier show appearance of an additional reduction peak at distinct lower temperature (360–400 °C) indicating presence of NiO without (or with very weak) interaction to the Si-rich support [31], [32], [33]. This is in accordance with XRD that showed finely dispersed NiO in 5Ni-S70 (Fig. 1). According to the TPR results it is expected that under the applied reaction temperature of 375 °C only the NiO with weak interaction to the support is reduced in Ni-S70 and Ni-S87. The major part of NiO has strong interaction to the support and is expected to stay in Ni2 + state under reaction conditions.

Fig. 2. H2-TPR profiles of selected Ni-SiAlOx catalysts.
HR-STEM images of 5Ni-AlMCM confirm the formation of lamellar structure (Fig. S2a of ESI). The distance of 0.26 nm between the layers is in accordance with Ni phyllosilicate structure. In 5Ni-S70 areas either with cluster (Fig. S2b of ESI) or without cluster structures (Fig. S2c of ESI) were identified. In the last case EDX measurements showed traces of Ni on the amorphous looking support. These points to highly dispersed Ni presumably atomically distributed. 1Ni-S70 seems to have totally amorphous structure and EDX shows that Ni here is finely dispersed over the whole sample (Fig. S2d of ESI, left). Most likely the developing of NiO particles happened under the electron beam (Fig. S2c of ESI, right, with arrows indicating the area of focusing).
3.2. Catalytic behavior in EtP reaction
The Ni-impregnated SiAlOx were tested in the conversion of ethylene to propene under similar reaction conditions as described in literature [20]. 5Ni-AlMCM synthesized by template-ion exchange according to [21], [28] was used as a reference. Experiments with bare SiAlOx have shown no catalytic activity in this reaction. Fig. 3 shows the initial conversion of ethylene and space time yield (STY) of propene over catalysts with 1 and 5 wt.% Ni loading and different Si/Al ratio in the support matrix. For the SiAlOx with both Ni loadings the overall conversion of ethylene decreased with increasing alumina content in the support. With respect to ethylene conversion 5Ni-S70 and 5Ni-S40 even outperform the 5Ni-AlMCM reference. This may be partly explained by the slightly lower Ni content in 5Ni-AlMCM (Table 1). STY of propene is higher for all 5Ni-SiAlOx catalysts compared to the reference what is mainly due to the very low density of mesoporous MCM-41. Within Ni-SiAlOx catalysts highest STY of propene is reached over samples having high Si/Al ratio (S70, S40) in the support but is lower over the one with highest silica content (S87).

Fig. 3. Initial conversion of ethylene and STY of propene over catalysts with 1 and 5 wt.% Ni on supports with different Si-content; reaction conditions: 375 °C, total gas (ethylene:nitrogen = 10:90 vol.%) flow rate 17.5 mL·min− 1, catalyst charge 0.45 g.
Selectivity is influenced to a great extent by catalyst composition. Over all studied catalysts main reaction products are the different isomers of butenes, propene and coke. Other reaction products formed to a minor degree are methane, ethane, propane, butanes, as well as different C5 and C6 hydrocarbons; they are summarized as “others” in the following. In Fig. 4 the selectivity is compared at ethylene conversion of 16–18 and 20–25% for catalysts with 1 wt.% and 5 wt.% Ni, respectively. Within the Ni-SiAlOx catalysts selectivity to propene increases with increasing Si/Al ratio in the support being highest for 1Ni-S70. The same was found for selectivity to butenes. On the contrary, coke selectivity decreases and is highest for Ni supported on Siral10. Coke selectivity can be correlated with the acidity of the bare SiAlOx supports [4], [34]; the acidity increases with decreasing Si/Al ratio and catalysts with higher surface acidity produce more coke.

Fig. 4. Selectivity to propene, butenes, others (methane, ethane, propane, sum of pentanes, pentenes and hexenes), and coke over catalysts with 1 and 5 wt.% Ni on supports with different Si-content. Reaction conditions see Fig. 3. GHSV was adjusted to reach similar conversion.
1Ni-S70 and 5Ni-S70 gave higher selectivity to propene and butenes and lower coke formation than the reference 5Ni-AlMCM what is remarkable since these catalysts do not contain the layered Ni phyllosilicate structure that has been considered to be responsible for the EtP reaction [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Interestingly, selectivity is higher over 1 wt.% Ni-SiAlOx catalysts compared to the 5 wt.% samples what may be caused by their higher NiO dispersion and its stronger interaction to the support. The butenes/propene ratio is for both Ni loadings highest for Ni-S10 and decreases with increasing Si content in the support. Therefore, we can assume that catalysts with high Si/Al ratio catalyze more efficiently the propene formation. A more detailed analysis of the different butenes shows that the ratio of 2-butenes (cis- + trans-) to 1-butene is about 2.5 and does not differ within the catalysts. Thus it seems that all samples are able to catalyze the double bond shift efficiently up to the thermodynamic equilibrium. The selectivity to undesired isobutene, however, depends on catalyst composition and is highest for 1Ni-S87 and 5Ni-AlMCM indicating higher activity for skeletal isomerization of these catalysts.
Besides activity and selectivity, the stability of the catalysts was also studied. The development of propene yield with time on stream over Ni-SiAlOx and 5Ni-AlMCM is shown in Fig. S3 in ESI. All catalysts deactivate with time on stream that is most probably due to covering active sites by coke. Deactivation rate can be compared for catalysts that start at similar conversion. Among these, 1Ni-S87 shows the fastest deactivation rate followed by 5Ni-AlMCM. 1Ni-S70, 5Ni-S40 and 5Ni-S70 show slower deactivation compared to the former two catalysts but still lost half of their activity within 2 h.
4. Conclusions
The direct conversion of ethylene to propene was studied over Ni supported by simple impregnation on silica-alumina with different Si/Al ratio. Ni-AlMCM-41 catalyst was prepared according to literature and used for comparison. The new Ni-SiAlOx catalysts convert ethylene to propene with very similar results as Ni-AlMCM-41. Since they contain neither ordered pore structure of MCM-41 nor layered Ni-containing phyllosilicate phase, it can be concluded that these features are not necessary for catalyzing the three steps of EtP reaction. Ni-SiAlOx catalysts possess besides NiOx particles finely dispersed NiOx catalytic sites having strong interacting with the support. The latter are postulated to be responsible for ethylene dimerization and reaction of ethylene with butene to propene. Double bond shift converting 1-butene to 2-butene is catalyzed by acidic sites available on the surface of silica-alumina. Since the strength of these acidic sites as well as the interaction between supported NiO and support varies within the support materials, a distinct influence of Si/Al content on catalytic activity and selectivity has been identified with Ni-S70 presenting the best catalytic results. Moreover, coke formation is lower over this catalyst compared to the reference 5Ni-AlMCM.
