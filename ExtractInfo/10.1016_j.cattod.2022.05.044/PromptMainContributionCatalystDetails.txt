Effect of In addition on the performance of a Pt-In/SBA-15 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation
Propane dehydrogenation is a promising way to produce propylene. Catalysts with high propane conversion, selectivity to propylene, and stability are vital to this technology. In this work, we determined that the catalytic performance of Pt/SBA-15 can be significantly enhanced by introducing an appropriate amount of indium. A too low ratio of In/Pt (1/8) or too high of a ratio (2/1) is detrimental to the activity of the catalyst. When the nominal ratio of Pt to In is 1/1, the initial propane conversion and selectivity towards propylene over 1Pt1In/SBA-15 are highest among all catalysts tested at 57.06 % and 99.04 %, respectively. The conversion rate decreased to 39.63 % after 28 h of reaction, but selectivity was retained at greater than 99 %. Very little coke was deposited on the used 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst. With catalyst characterization, it was proposed that Pt1In1 alloy nanoparticles with surface-enriched In2O3 were responsible for the selective dehydrogenation of propane.
1. Introduction
Lower alkanes including ethane, propane, and butane are readily available from petroleum and gas resources. Traditional applications of lower alkanes are based on the release of stored energy as heat via combustion. Such applications entail the complete oxidation of alkanes, which also release a massive amount of CO2. In comparison, production of more value-added chemicals such as ethylene, propylene, 1-butylene, 2-butylene, and 1,3-butadiene from lower alkanes is more valuable [1], [2], [3]. Taking propylene as an example, it is a key intermediate of industrial polymers and has been produced via steam cracking of naphtha or gas oil. With recent growth in propylene derivatives, the direct conversion of propane (propane dehydrogenation, PDH) to the corresponding propylene is becoming more and more admirable [4], [5].
Unfortunately, the PDH process requires partial or selective oxidation of propane [6]. As one significantly endothermic process, high reaction temperatures (preferably ≥600 °C) are generally necessary to obtain sufficient propylene yields. Such harsh reaction conditions often cause catalyst deactivation due to coke deposition and/or sintering. Modification of Pt catalysts with a second metal is an efficient strategy to improve dehydrogenation selectivity and maintain activity, and enhance the stability of the catalyst. Of the promoting elements reported, the greatest attention has been focused on Sn [7], [8], [9]. Deng L. et al. developed different Pt-Sn alloys composed of different Sn/Pt ratios, where the properties of the catalyst were shown to be closely related to the added amount of Sn [10]. When the Sn/Pt ratio was 1, primarily the Pt3Sn alloy was formed and exhibited the highest activity. In contrast, if the Sn/Pt ratio was larger than 1, mostly the Pt1Sn1 alloy was observed and the catalysts showed low activity [11]. Zhu H. et al. reported more activity for propane dehydrogenation due to a high concentration of inactive Sn at the surface of the Pt nanoparticles and found that propylene selectivity close to 100 % could be achieved on the Pt3.1Sn/MgAl2O4 catalyst with the highest Sn loading [12].
Indium, another promoter, has also been employed in Pt-based catalysts for the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes [13]. Non-acidic materials, especially magnesium aluminum oxides (Mg(Al)O), have been widely used as supports for Pt-In bimetallic catalysts [14], [15]. It was found that In more homogeneously dilutes Pt atoms than Sn [16], [17]. Sun P. et al. found that the activities of Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalysts for propane dehydrogenation were strongly influenced by the bulk In/Pt ratio. Maximum activity was achieved for a bulk In/Pt ratio of 0.48, corresponding to a Pt-In alloy containing 12 % In. The selectivity to propylene was nearly 100 % for Pt/Mg(In)(Al) [18]. Coke formation was significantly reduced on all prepared bimetallic Pt-In catalysts, especially coke on the active metal, which diminished the catalytic deactivation. W. Tolek et al. found that coke formation was significantly reduced on bimetallic Pt-In catalysts, especially coke on the active metal [19]. Consequently, Pt-In catalysts show potential as catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane.
Because the intrinsic acidity of alumina causes large amounts of coke formation via catalyzing C-C bond cleavage, isomerization, and polymerization, non-acidic materials such as magnesium aluminum oxides (Mg(Al)O) has been widely used as the support for Pt-based bimetallic catalysts [20]. Other than magnesium aluminum oxides, mesoporous silica materials, such as SBA-15, has received attention as a support for Pt-In catalysts owing to their highly ordered nanopores, large surface area, moderate acidic characteristics, and high thermal stability [4], [21], [22].
Therefore, in this study, Pt-In bimetallic nanoparticles were synthesized on an SBA-15 support, and applied to the propane dehydrogenation reaction. It was found that the addition of In greatly influenced the catalyst structure and catalytic performance. When the In/Pt ratio was as low as 1/8 (8Pt1In), Pt surface-enriched Pt-In bimetallic nanoparticles were detected, and the surface concentration of Pt was found to be higher than Pt/SBA-15. 8Pt1In/SBA-15 exhibited poor activity. By gradually increasing the In concentration, the catalytic activity and stability over the Pt-In/SBA-15 increased. The Pt1In1 alloy formed with a nominal In/Pt ratio of one exhibited the highest activity. Furthermore, the selectivity towards propylene remained stable and ≥ 99 % over the catalytic reaction time. Over 28 h, the propane conversion gradually decreased from an initial value of 57.06–39.63 %. When the In/Pt ratio was greater than 1, the propane conversion decreased even more. The present work may provide more options for the development of a high-efficiency catalyst system for propane dehydrogenation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Mesoporous silica SBA-15 was synthesized using a typical hydrothermal method. Briefly, 5 g of a Pluronic P123 (EO20PO70EO20, Mn 5800, Sigma-Aldrich) was added into 177 mL of HCl aqueous solution (2 mol L−1). Then, the mixture was stirred at 40 °C for 6 h. 10.56 g of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS, 98 %, Aladdin) was then slowly dripped into the mixture under stirring. The resultant solution continued to stir at 40 °C for another 48 h. The white gel mixture was loaded into an autoclave lined with Teflon and aged at 100 °C for 48 h. The obtained sample was filtered, washed using distilled water, and desiccated at 100 °C for 12 h. The sample was ultimately calcined at 550 °C for 6 h to generate the SBA-15 support.
A Pt-In/SBA-15 catalyst was prepared by co-impregnation with H2PtCl6∙6 H2O (Aladdin) and In(NO3)3∙xH2O (Aladdin) as the precursors. The support was then impregnated with H2PtCl6 and the In(NO3)3∙xH2O solution. The mixed aqueous solution was sonicated for 0.5 h and stirred for 24 h at room temperature. The resultant mixture was evaporated at 60 °C for 12 h. Then the dried sample was reduced by H2 at 550 °C for 1 h to obtain Pt-In/SBA-15 catalysts. The loading of Pt was 3 %, and the catalysts were labeled as xPtyIn/SBA-15, where x and y represent the initial molar ratio of Pt to In. For comparison, Pt/SBA-15 with 3 wt % Pt was prepared by the same method.
2.2. Catalytic testing
Propane dehydrogenation took place in a fixed-bed quartz tube reactor (diameter: 8 mm), which was packed with 100 mg of catalyst (20–40 mesh pellets). Prior to catalyst evaluation, the sample was first treated with a 25 vol % H2/N2 gaseous mixture (50 mL min−1) at 550 °C for 1 h. The temperature was then maintained at 550 °C, and a reactant gas mixture was fed (100 mL·min−1, C3H8: H2: N2 =4: 1: 15, weight hour space velocity (WHSV) = 12 L·h−1·g−1cat, atmospheric pressure). The resultant gas products were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (Ramiin GC2060, China) equipped with a flame ionization detector (Rt-Alumina BOND MAPD column).
2.3. Catalyst characterization
N2 adsorption–desorption experiments were performed using a Quantachrome Autosorb iQ analyzer (USA.). Prior to physisorption measurements, the catalysts were pretreated in a vacuum at 150 °C for 12 h. The specific surface areas of the catalysts were measured using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method. The specific pore volume and pore diameters were determined using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) data were collected using a Smartlab X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (γ = 1.5406 Å) radiation sources in the 2θ range of 10°− 90° with a scan rate of 10 °/min.
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images of different catalysts were recorded using a JEM-2100 F microscope. The powder sample was ultrasonicated in ethanol, and a small amount of the resulting suspension was deposited on carbon-coated copper grids.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded using an ESCALAB Xi+ spectrometer (Thermo Fischer) with monochromic Al Kα radiation (hν=1486.6 eV) in a chamber under vacuum conditions of 8 × 10−10 Pa. XPS data were collected at pass energies of 30 eV for C 1 s, O1s, Si 2p, Pt 4 f, and In 3d core XPS levels. To calibrate the binding energies, the C 1 s peak was adjusted to 284.8 eV.
The number of exposed Pt surface sites was estimated by CO chemisorption using a chemisorption analyzer (ChemStar, Quantachrome Instruments) equipped with TCD detectors. Fifty milligrams of catalyst precursor was packed in a quartz tube and reduced with hydrogen at 550 °C for 1 h, followed by a pure He (30 mL·min−1) purge for 1 h at the same temperature. CO chemisorption was carried out at 50 °C, and each sample measurement was repeated five times. The amount of exposed Pt was correlated to the amount of adsorbed CO.
In situ CO diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (CO-DRIFTs) was performed using a FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet IS50, Thermo Fisher, USA). Before the CO chemisorption test was conducted, the catalysts were placed in an in situ DRIFTS cell and slightly pressed onto a flat surface. The sample was reduced under a hydrogen stream (50 mL·min−1) at 500 °C for 30 min. The cell was then cooled to 30 °C under a N2 stream, and background spectra were obtained. CO adsorption was conducted with 10 vol % CO/N2 flowing.
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis was performed using a chemisorption analyzer (ChemStar, Quantachrome Instruments) coupled to an online mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum, D-35614 Asslar). Fifty milligrams of spent catalysts were packed in a quartz tube and pretreated at 100 °C for 30 min under Ar (30 mL·min−1). Then the temperature was increased to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 using a 20 vol % O2/N2 gaseous mixture (30 mL·min−1). The amount of CO2 formed was analyzed using an online mass spectrometer.
Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) measurements were conducted using a chemisorption analyzer (ChemStar, Quantachrome Instruments) coupled to an online mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum, D-35614 Asslar). Prior to testing, 50 mg of the sample was pretreated by hydrogen at 550 °C for 1 h and cooled to 50 °C under argon. Then, the samples were exposed to NH3 (10 % NH3/He, 30 mL·min−1) for 30 min. The weakly adsorbed NH3 was removed by flushing with pure He (20 mL·min−1) for 0.5 h. The temperature was increased to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under He stream, and the signal of NH3 desorption was recorded by an online mass spectrometer.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic performances of Pt-In/SBA-15 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation
Fig. 1 shows the effect of the molar ratio of Pt/In on the catalytic performance of Pt-In/SBA-15 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation. As shown in Fig. 1 (A), the initial conversion of propane over the Pt/SBA-15 catalyst was 49.81 %, which dropped to 32.51 % after 4 h of reaction, indicating a rapid decrease in activity. With the addition of In, this trend significantly changed. When the Pt/In mole ratio was 8, the initial conversion of propane was almost the same as that of Pt/SBA-15, and then significantly decreased after 4 h. The conversion was 28.45 %, which was less than 32.51 % over Pt/SBA-15. This result shows that low In loading is detrimental to the effectiveness of the catalyst. When the Pt/In molar ratios were 5, 2, 1 or 0.5, the initial propane conversion rates over Pt-In/SBA-15 catalysts were 53.36 %, 46.64 %, 57.54 %, and 41.94 %, respectively, which changed to 41.10 %, 41.35 %, 50.19 %, and 45.80 % after 4 h reaction. The 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst exhibited the best activity and stability.

Selectivity towards propylene over Pt-In/SBA-15 catalysts is shown in Fig. 1 (B). Pt/SBA-15 showed poor selectivity towards propylene, which was initially 81.99 %, and slightly increased to 93.61 % after 4 h of reaction. There were some side reactions that occurred besides propane dehydrogenation, leading to by-products such as methane and ethane. The selectivity towards propylene was similar to that over Pt/SBA-15 when the Pt/In molar ratio was 5 or 8. For 8Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst, propylene selectivity was the lowest, 84.31 % and 92.61 % for the initial and final test time, respectively. As seen in 1Pt1In/SBA-15 and 1Pt2In/SBA-15 catalysts, further increases in In loading improved propylene selectivity. When the molar ratio of Pt/In was greater than 1, the selectivity of the catalyst was more than 99 % and remained at that level throughout the whole test.
We further evaluated the stability of the 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst, which had exhibited the highest activity among all catalysts tested in this study. As shown in Fig. 2, the initial propane conversion and selectivity towards propylene over 1Pt1In/SBA-15 were 57.06 % and 99.04 %, respectively. After a 28 h reaction time, the conversion rate decreased to 39.63 % and the selectivity increased to 99.80 %. The catalyst maintained high selectivity over the long reaction process. At the same time, we also noticed that the conversion of propane gradually decreased over the long catalytic test, which was likely due to the gradual accumulation of coke on the catalyst.

3.2. Structural properties of Pt-In/SBA-15 catalysts
Fig. 3 shows the XRD patterns of the Pt/SBA-15 and Pt-In/SBA-15 catalysts. The broad peaks located at around 22° were ascribed to the support material SiO2. The Pt/SBA-15 catalyst showed diffraction peaks at 39.8°, 46.2°, and 67.4°, corresponding to the Pt (1 1 1), (2 0 0), and (2 2 0) planes (JCDPS No. 04–0802), respectively. With the addition of In, the peaks related to metallic Pt shifted toward lower or higher degrees. For example, the Pt (1 1 1) peak gradually shifted towards lower angles when the molar ratio of Pt/In decreased in the range of 8–2. Based on reported Pt-In alloys including Pt19In1, Pt17In3, and Pt3In (Fig. S4) [23], [24], [25], it is believed that PtnIn alloys (n ≥ 3) with an face center cubic structure were formed on 8Pt1In/SBA-15, 5Pt1In/SBA-15, and 2Pt1In/SBA-15. Moreover, the Pt diffraction peak signals over 5Pt1In/SBA-15 (spectrum (d)) and 8Pt1In/SBA-15 (spectrum (e)) became stronger, indicating the increase of crystal Pt size. The situation changed when the Pt/In ratio was greater than 1. Particularly, the 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst showed diffraction peaks at 39.6°, 39.8°, 40.7° and 41.1°. The diffraction peak at 39.8°, 40.7° and 41.1° are corresponding to the Pt1In1 (6 0 2), (0 2 0) and (3 1 3) plane (JCDPS No. 31–0599), the lower diffraction peak at 39.6° is corresponding to the Pt19In1 (1 1 1) plane (ICSD No. 01–073–9007). This result indicated that Pt1In1 and Pt19In1 alloys coexist over 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst [26]. Meanwhile, HAADF-TEM-EDS image of 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst (Fig.S6) show that In located in the intimate area of Pt, and the atom ratio of Pt and In at the chosen spot 1 is 10:9. These results indicated Pt-In alloy formation over 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst. In addition, the 1Pt2In/SBA-15 catalyst showed same diffraction peaks as Pt/SBA-15 catalyst, indicating no alloy formation over 1Pt2In/SBA-15 catalyst.

Table 1 shows the specific surface area, pore volume, and pore size of the support and Pt-In/SBA-15 catalysts. The specific surface area, pore volume and average pore size of SBA-15 were 33.02 m2·g−1, 1.08 cm3·g−1, and 6.54 nm, respectively. As for Pt/SBA-15 and 1Pt1In/SBA-15, their specific surface areas are lower than that of the SBA-15, which may be caused by a partial collapse or blockage of the pore channels of the sample with active metal loading during the impregnation and reduction processes.

In the case of 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst, seen in Fig. 5(d) and (e), nanoparticles with an average particle size of 4.83 ± 0.12 nm were dispersed on the SBA-15. Compared with the Pt/SBA-15 catalyst, the average size of metal particles on the 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst is smaller with the addition of In.

To further study the distribution of Pt and In elements on the 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst, we used HAADF-STEM to analyze the distribution of specific elements on the catalyst, as seen in Fig. 5(f–i). It is obvious that Si almost covers the entire selected area, and Pt aggregation could be seen in the Pt nanoparticles. In contrast, In was homogeneously distributed over SBA-15.
3.3. Surface properties of Pt-In/SBA-15 catalysts
To further study the composition and chemical states of the surface components of the catalyst, XPS characterization was carried out. As shown in Fig. 6 and Table 2, the Si and O signals are attributed to the SBA-15 support. The signal peak of Pt 4 f could be observed in all catalysts. In addition, the 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst presented an obvious signal peak of In 3d, while the In 3d signal peak of 8Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst was extremely weak.

Fig. 7 (A) shows the XPS spectra corresponding to the Pt 4 f regions for Pt/SBA-15, 8Pt1In/SBA-15, and 1Pt1In/SBA-15. Two peaks appeared around 75 eV (Pt 4 f5/2) and 72 eV (Pt 4 f7/2) represent metallic Pt species for all catalysts, indicating that Pt was completely reduced with H2 reduction. The Pt 4 f7/2 peak for Pt/SBA-15 is located at 71.66 eV. After adding a small amount of In with Pt/In= 8, this Pt 4 f7/2 peak shifts to higher energy. Considering higher Pt/Si, Pt/In ratios in 8Pt1In/SBA-15, this shift is probably caused by more Pt atoms in the catalyst surface. The Pt 4 f XPS peak of the 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst at 71.71 eV implies increased electron density around Pt with alloying with In.

Fig. 7 (B) shows the XPS spectra corresponding to the In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 regions of 1Pt1In/SBA-15 and 8Pt1In/SBA-15 catalysts. After the deconvolution of the spectrum of 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst, two different indium species were obtained around 444.87 eV and 445.91 eV, respectively [27]. The peak at the lower binding energy was attributed to the metallic In (In0), whereas the higher binding energy was ascribed to the oxidation state of the In species (In3+) on the catalyst surface [28], [29]. The XRD result of 1Pt1In/SBA-15 indicated the formation of the Pt1In1 alloy. The mixture of both In0 and In3+ on 1Pt1In/SBA-15 further implied that In was not completely reduced. The XPS signal for 8Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst was quite weak, indicating that the surface concentration of In on the 8Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst was very low. Combined with the previous XRD and CO pulse characterization, it is reasonable to infer that Pt was enriched on the surface of the catalyst, which may cover some of the PtnIn (n ≥ 3) alloy. We also speculate that both In0 and In3+ coexist on 8Pt1In/SBA-15 from its appearance in the XPS spectrum.
The semi-quantitative analysis of metal content on the catalyst surface was carried out using XPS characterization data. Table 2 indicates that Pt enriched over 8Pt1In/SBA-15. The Pt/In molar ratios of 8Pt1In/SBA-15 and 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalysts were 1.41 and 0.44, respectively. Considering the bulk In/Pt ratio for preparing 1Pt1In/SBA-15 is 1, it seem that some oxidized In was decorated on the Pt1In1 alloy surface for 1Pt1In/SBA-15.
Table 3 show the CO pulse chemisorption results of Pt-In/SBA-15 catalysts with different In/Pt nominal ratios. As seen from Table 3, the addition of In greatly influenced the adsorption amount of CO on the catalyst surface. For the Pt/SBA-15 catalyst, about 16.5 µmol g−1 CO was adsorbed, and the ratio of adsorbed CO to the initial Pt is 0.107. When In was introduced, it was found that a small amount of In could significantly increase the CO adsorption capacity. The CO adsorption capacity of 8Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst was the largest, 45.8 µmol·g−1, with a 0.298 ratio of CO/Pt. This indicates that there are more accessible Pt sites for 8Pt1In/SBA-15. However, if more in was added, the adsorption amount of CO on the catalyst surface gradually decreased. Only 6.0 and 4.1 µmol g−1·CO were adsorbed on 1Pt1In/SBA-15 and 1Pt2In/SBA-15, respectively, implying few accessible Pt sites on the catalyst surfaces.

To further evaluate the effects of In introduction on the electronic environment around Pt, we used CO small molecules as gas probes to carry out CO-DRIFTs characterization [30], [31]. As shown in Fig. 8, four adsorption peaks appear on Pt/SBA-15 catalyst, among which three peaks at 2079 cm−1, 2123 cm−1, and 2175 cm−1 correspond to the linear adsorption peak of CO on the catalyst, and the peak at 1868 cm−1 corresponds to the bridge adsorption peak of CO on the catalyst. For the 8Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst, the linear adsorption peaks appear at 2080 cm−1, 2117 cm−1, and 2177 cm−1. In addition, a weak adsorption peak appears at 2360 cm−1, corresponding to that of CO2, which may be due to the combination of CO and O atoms of In2O3 on the catalyst surface, forming a CO2 signal. For the 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst, two linear adsorption peaks appear at 2117 cm−1 and 2174 cm−1. We discovered a shift in position of the linear adsorption CO-Pt peak as a function of In, indicating that In had strong electronic interaction with Pt and changed the electron density of Pt. At the same time, we found that the bridge adsorption peak of CO on the surface of Pt disappeared after adding In, indicating that the introduction of In improved the dispersion of Pt on the surface of the catalyst.

The acidic properties of the SBA-15 and catalysts were investigated by NH3-TPD, and the results are displayed in Fig. 9. All catalysts showed a similar appearance consisting of one desorption peak region at 100–180 °C. According to the other supported Pt-In bimetallic catalysts reported [14], [32], the peak could be inferred as weak acid sites. When Pt was loaded on the SBA-15, the NH3 desorption peak of SBA-15 was weakened, indicating that Pt could neutralize some acidic sites. With the increasing In concentration, the number of weak acid sites over Pt-In/SBA-15 catalysts first increased and then decreased, indicating the different roles of In at different loadings. The introduction of a small amount of In increased the number of acid sites. As the In loading continued to increase, the number of weak acid sites on the catalyst surface greatly decreased. The NH3 desorption peak at the weak acid level of 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst was the smallest, and the catalyst activity was the highest. This indicates that an appropriate amount of In can adjust the acidity of the Pt-In/SBA-15 catalyst surface and improve the reaction activity of the catalyst.

3.4. Catalyst deactivation analysis
Metal sintering and coke formation are two main reasons for catalyst deactivation during high temperature reactions. The particle sizes of Pt-containing particles for the fresh and spent 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst were observed with TEM images. As shown in Fig. 10, both fresh and spent 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalysts exhibited high metal dispersion. The average particle size of fresh 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst was 4.83 ± 0.12 nm. After the reaction for 4 h, the particle size of spent catalyst was 5.03 ± 0.08 nm, being similar with that of the fresh one. This result indicated no obvious sintering of Pt-containing nanoparticles after the reaction.

Coke formation is another reason for catalyst deactivation during high- temperature reactions [33]. Thus, we further conducted coke analysis of the spent Pt-In bimetallic catalysts by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). Fig. 11 shows the TPO profiles of Pt-In/SBA-15 catalysts with different In/Pt molar ratios. There are two peaks in the range of 300–500 °C and 500–600 °C for all the catalysts, which are related to the accumulation of carbon on the metal active site and inert support, respectively. It was found that more coke was deposited on the 8Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst than the Pt/SBA-15. This may have been caused by Pt enrichment on the surface of the 8Pt1In/SBA-15, and excessive carbon deposition further resulted in rapid deactivation of the catalyst.

Except for 8Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst, the amount of coke deposition over other catalysts was found to gradually decrease with increasing In loading. It was indicated that In can effectively inhibit the generation of carbon deposition. The intensity of the TPO profile for 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst is very small. The carbon deposition over 1Pt1In/SBA-15 is the smallest even compared with 1Pt1Sn/SBA-15 or 1Pt1Ga/SBA-15, as shown in Fig. 10 and Fig. S5. A low level of coke deposition is one important reason for the high stability of the 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst.
4. Discussion
We investigated the effect of In addition on the performance of the Pt/SBA-15 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, which showed that the initial activity is high but then rapidly decreased. When a small amount of In was introduced, the XRD peak due to metallic Pt over 8Pt1In/SBA-15 was found to intensify compared with that of Pt/SBA-15. The semi-quantitative XPS analysis and CO chemisorption further indicated Pt enrichment on the catalyst surface of 8Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst, which is consistent with the XRD results. Such Pt enrichment has a deleterious effect on catalyst stability. 8Pt1In/SBA-15 suffered greater activity loss than Pt/SBA-15. O2-TPO revealed that a huge amount of coke was deposited on the 8Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst. As the amount of In increased, the amount of surface accessible Pt sites gradually decreased, and the catalytic activity was gradually improved. Specifically, the 1Pt1In/SBA-15 exhibited the best activity and stability, and only a little amount of coke was deposited over the used one. In analyzing the 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst via XRD, XPS, and HRTEM techniques, the Pt1In1 alloys decorated with surface In2O3 on SBA-15 were thought to be responsible for the high catalytic activity. If the loading amount of In continued to increase, the activity of the catalyst decreased, indicating that an excessive loading of In is also unfavorable to the activity of the catalyst.
NH3-TPD results showed that In could also regulate the surface acidity of catalyst. With increasing In loading, the acidity of Pt-In/SBA-15 catalyst first increased and then decreased, which is consistent with the changes in carbon deposition amount. The surface acidity of the catalyst can promote C-C cleavage and affect the desorption process of propylene, which induced more side reactions and carbon deposition. In summary, the addition of In to Pt/SBA-15 not only regulated the accessibility of surface Pt atoms, but also the acidity. An appropriate amount of In to Pt/SBA-15 can inhibit coke formation and enhance catalyst stability.
5. Conclusions
In this work, we introduced In into Pt/SBA-15 to investigate the role of different loadings of In in the catalytic performance of Pt-In/SBA-15 in propane dehydrogenation. Small amounts of In addition with a Pt/In ratio of 8 can dilute Pt nanoparticles and induce Pt enrichment over PtnIn alloys (n ≥ 3). During propane dehydrogenation, a high concentration of Pt atoms over 8Pt1In/SBA-15 resulted in more coke deposition and poor stability and activity. When the Pt/In ratio was increased as 1, it was found that propane conversion, selectivity towards propylene, and reaction stability were maximized over the 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst. Pt1In1 alloy nanoparticles and surface-enriched In2O3 were detected on the active 1Pt1In/SBA-15 catalyst. Such an ensemble is probably the most active ensemble for the selective dehydrogenation of propane towards propylene. In addition, too much In can cover the Pt-In alloys and is detrimental to the activity of the catalyst. Generally, In can effectively regulate the surface concentration of Pt atoms on the Pt-In/SBA-15 catalyst and catalyst acidity. An appropriate amount of In can guarantee the activity of Pt-In alloys and inhibit coke formation with surface-enriched In2O3 species.
