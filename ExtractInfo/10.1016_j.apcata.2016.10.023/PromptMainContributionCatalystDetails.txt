Effect of Zn addition on the direct synthesis of hydrogen peroxide over supported palladium catalysts
Highlights
•
The configuration of Zn and Pd has both a significantly positive effect on H2O2 productivity and a corresponding increasing on the selectivity.
•
The addition of Zn increases the isolated Pd sites, the primary active sites for H2O2 formation, which promotes the H2O2 selectivity.
•
Both the high Pd dispersion and the incremental Pd0 content in PdZn samples lead to a high reactivity and a striking H2O2 productivity.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has attracted attention in the fields of environmental protection, chemical synthesis, pharmaceuticals, papermaking and wastewater treatment [1], [2]. Currently, H2O2 is industrially produced by the anthraquinone process involving the sequential hydrogenation and oxidation of an alkyl anthraquinone precursor, which is a high-cost and energy-intensive multi-step process [3]. Direct synthesis of H2O2 using raw materials hydrogen and oxygen is considered a promising green process, because it offers remarkable advantages such as atom economy, low energy consumption, and low operation costs [4], [5]. However, it is still a challenge to explore an effective catalyst to implement the green direct synthesis process of H2O2 on an industrial scale.
A number of metallic catalysts have been studied, involving Au [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], Pt [9], [12], [13], and Pd [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21] to improve the catalytic activity and selectivity of H2O2 in direct synthesis. Pd has been considered the most promising catalytic metallic component, and the effects of other metallic components on the activity of the Pd catalyst have been extensively investigated [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]. Hutchings and co-workers reported a H2O2 productivity of 110 mol kgcat−1 h−1 and a H2O2 selectivity of 80% over the bimetallic Pd-Au/C catalyst (2.5 wt% Pd, 2.5 wt% Au) at the reaction temperature of 2 °C, which were much higher than the corresponding values obtained over monometallic 5.0 wt% Pd [22]. When the carbon support was pre-treated by acid, Au-Pd bimetallic catalysts showed no activity for hydrogenation/decomposition side reactions, resulting in a high H2O2 selectivity (95%) [23]. Subsequently, Hutchings et al. found that PdSn catalysts treated by an appropriate heat treatment cycle can switch off the sequential hydrogenation and decomposition reactions, thus achieving selectivity of >95% toward H2O2 at the reaction temperature of 2 °C [32]. Han et al. reported that the addition of a small amount of Pt into the Pd phase (3.3 wt% Pd, molar ratio Pd/Pt = 16) could significantly enhance H2O2 selectivity (from 12% to 60%) and productivity (from 990 mol kgPd−1 h−1 to 1770 mol kgPd−1 h−1) [31]. Gu et al. demonstrated that the addition of Ag can improve the performance of Pd catalysts, i.e. over the catalyst PdAg-40 (1 wt% Pd, molar ratio Pd/Ag = 40), the H2O2 selectivity was 70.9% and the productivity was 7022 mol kgPd−1 h−1 at the reaction temperature of 2 °C [33]. Maity et al. reported that the presence of Ni enhanced the catalytic activity of Pd: the concentration of H2O2 was 356 mM (49 mol kgPd−1 h−1) in 72 h which was about three times higher (∼200% increase) than that of H2O2 obtained over pure Pd; the PdNi catalyst was also very stable under harsh acidic conditions [34]. For industrial production, it is essential to explore a low-cost effective catalyst with a high productivity of H2O2 and low activity for side reactions.
Recently, Childers et al. demonstrated that PdZn bimetallic catalysts showed high selectivity for propane dehydrogenation to propylene owing to the geometric isolation of active Pd atoms surrounded by the inactive metal Zn [35]. Previous theoretical calculations have indicated that the Pd monomers are favorable for the formation of H2O2 by suppressing OO bond scission [36]. Ouyang et al. studied the direct synthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2 as well as the side reactions over Pd-Au/TiO2 catalysts and found that H2O2 productivity increased with a decrease in the Pd/Au ratio, suggesting that the Pd monomer surrounded by Au atoms could be the primary active site for H2O2 formation [27]. We herein report on the effect of Zn additives on the catalytic performance of Pd catalyst for the direct synthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2. In this study, we prepared a series of bimetallic PdZn catalysts on alumina with different metal loadings, and assessed the catalytic performance for the direct synthesis of H2O2 (including the sequential side reactions of hydrogenation and decomposition reactions). The reasons why Zn addition can improve the catalytic activity of Pd catalyst were studied, and the catalysts were characterized by TEM, X-ray diffraction (XRD), TPR, XPS, H2-/O2-TPD, CO chemisorption, and CO-DRIFTS.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Na2PdCl4 (99.95%, Energy Chemical, China) was used as the palladium precursor and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (AR, Tianjin Kemiou Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) as the zinc precursor. NH3·H2O (25 wt.%) was purchased from Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute. Pseudoboehmite (99%, CNOOC Tianjin Chemical Research & Design Institute) was calcined in air at 600 °C for 4 h to obtain γ-Al2O3. γ-Al2O3 was used as a support to prepare the bimetallic Pd-Zn samples by the sequential impregnation method with the same nominal Pd loading of 1 wt% but varied Zn loadings (1 wt%, 3 wt%, and 5 wt%). The representative procedure to prepare the bimetallic samples is described below.
First, a zinc precursor solution was prepared by adding NH3∙H2O into an aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O. For example, 2.275 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was dissolved in 45 mL of water, followed by drop-wise addition of NH3∙H2O into the solution with stirring to prepare a uniform solution (named the zinc precursor solution). Then, 10 g of alumina support was added into the zinc precursor solution under vigorous stirring for 1 h followed by incubation at 45 °C for 1 h. The obtained suspension was filtered, washed three times with deionized water, and then calcined in air at 300 °C for 4 h after being desiccated at 120 °C for 12 h. Next, the zinc-loaded sample was impregnated with 50 mL of 0.0188 mol/L Na2PdCl4 aqueous solution under stirring for 1 h, followed by incubation at 45 °C for 1 h. Finally, the suspension was filtered, washed, dried, and calcined under the same conditions mentioned above to yield the bimetallic sample.
The samples were denoted in terms of the nominal loading amounts of metallic components. For instance, 1Pd1Zn indicates the sample prepared with a nominal Pd loading of 1 wt% and Zn loading of 1 wt% using Al2O3 as the support. As a control, the monometallic Pd catalyst (1 wt% Pd, represented as 1Pd) and the monometallic Zn catalyst (3 wt% Zn, represented as 3Zn) were prepared using the procedure mentioned above.
2.2. Catalytic performance test
2.2.1. Direct synthesis of H2O2
Prior to the reaction, the samples were pretreated at 300 °C in 10% H2/Ar for 4 h. The catalysts were evaluated for the direct synthesis of H2O2 in a stainless steel autoclave (internally coated with Teflon) with a nominal volume of 150 mL and a maximum working pressure of 10 MPa. The autoclave was equipped with a magnetic stirrer and provisions were made for measuring the temperature and pressure. Typically, 50 mg catalyst and 20 mL of 0.03 M H2SO4/methanol solution were loaded into the reactor. The reactor was purged thrice with N2 (3 MPa) and then filled with 5% H2/N2 and 25% O2/N2 to provide the H2-to-O2 ratio of 1:2 at the total pressure of 3 MPa. The reaction was performed at 2 °C and the stirring rate of 1000 rpm for 15 min, unless otherwise stated. The H2O2 content, n(H2O2), was measured by titration with acidic Ce(SO4)2 solution, while the water content, n(H2O), was determined by the volumetric Karl Fischer method. The productivity is defined as the moles of H2O2 produced per kilogram Pd per hour. H2 conversion and H2O2 selectivity were calculated according to the following equations:

2.2.2. Hydrogenation and decomposition of H2O2
H2O2 hydrogenation and decomposition reactions were studied with the initial H2O2 concentration of 1.0 wt% and the same reaction conditions mentioned above. Hydrogenation experiments were carried out in an atmosphere of 5% H2/N2, while the decomposition experiments were only fed with pure N2. The H2O2 conversion rate is defined as the moles of H2O2 consumed per kilogram Pd per hour.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured on a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument at −196 °C. Inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) was carried out using an Iris advantage Thermo Jarrel Ash device. XRD patterns were measured from 10° to 90° 2q using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped with a Si (Li) solid-state detector (SOL-X) and a sealed tube which provides Cu-Ka radiation. TEM analysis was carried out using a JEOL JEM2100F microscope under an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. XPS was recorded using a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer employing a monochromated Al-Ka X-ray source (hn = 1486.6 eV), hybrid (magnetic/electrostatic) optics, a multi-channel plate, and a delay-line detector (DLD). All the binding energies were referenced to the C1S peak at 284.8 eV. TPR experiments were performed with an AutoChem BET TPR/TPD (Quantachrome Instruments AMI-90) connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD): a sample of 100 mg was heated from room temperature to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a flow of 10% H2/Ar. H2- and O2-TPD experiments were performed with an AutoChem BET TPR/TPD (Quantachrome Instruments AMI-90) connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Prior to adsorption, the catalyst was reduced in 10% H2/Ar at 300 °C for 60 min, and then cooled down in pure He. Adsorbents of 10% H2/Ar and 10% O2/Ar were introduced into the system at 40 °C for 15 min, respectively. Afterwards, the system was purged with He for 15 min. The temperature was ramped from 40 °C to 500 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 in He. Metal dispersion was measured by CO chemisorption with an AutoChem BET TPR/TPD (Quantachrome Instruments AMI-90). The catalysts were reduced in H2/Ar at 300 °C for 60 min and then flushed for 30 min in He. Thereafter, the catalyst was cooled to 40 °C and CO pulses were injected into the system through 10% CO/He. CO adsorption was assumed to be completed when three successive peaks showed the same peak area. A 1:1 CO/Pd molar ratio was assumed to determine the Pd surface content of the catalysts. CO-DRIFTS spectra were recorded with a Nicolet iS10 spectrometer equipped with a mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector. Before the adsorption, the sample was reduced in 10% H2/N2 at 300 °C for 60 min, and then cooled down in a pure N2 atmosphere. CO gas was introduced into the system at 30 °C for 15 min. The system was purged with N2 and spectra were collected at a resolution of 4 cm−1. All infrared data were evaluated in Kubelka-Munk units, which are linearly related to the adsorbent concentration in the spectra. The bridge-to-linear-bound ratios reported here do not take into account the differences in extinction coefficients between the adsorption sites, and therefore, the bridge-to-linear-bound does not represent quantitative coverage, but reflects qualitative differences between catalysts [37].
The N2 adsorption-desorption, ICP, H2-TPR, H2-/O2-TPD, CO chemisorption and CO-DRIFTS investigations were performed with fresh catalysts and the XRD, TEM and XPS investigations were performed using the reduced catalysts.
3. Results
3.1. Catalyst characterization
3.1.1. Catalyst textural properties and chemical compositions
The N2 physisorption measurement was carried out to determine the textural properties of the catalysts. As listed in Table 1, the γ-Al2O3 support exhibits a mesoporous structure with SBET = 167.53 m2 g−1, Vp = 0.54 cm3 g−1, and Dp = 12.84 nm. Both the surface area and the total pore volume of the samples reduced upon loading with the metallic components due to pore blockage caused by the metallic components during catalyst preparation [3].

BET surface area, total pore volume (Vp), and average pore diameter (Dp) were measured from the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms.
Table 1 also shows the chemical compositions of the samples measured by ICP. It is indicated that the measured amounts of Pd and Zn are lower than the corresponding nominal values, due to incomplete adsorption of metal ions onto the support. In particular, the measured amount of Zn in the 5Zn sample is 2.70 wt%, much lower than the nominal value of 5 wt%, suggesting that the maximum adsorption capacity of Zn on the support is approximately 2.70 wt%. For sample 1Pd5Zn, the Zn amount is about 2.69 wt%, which is consistent with that of 5Zn.
3.1.2. TEM and CO chemisorption
Fig. 1 displays typical TEM images and particle size distribution histograms of the monometallic Pd and Pd-Zn bimetallic samples. The average particle size of 1Pd is 4.22 nm; the average particle size of the bimetallic samples decreases with the loading amount of Zn, with values of 3.49, 2.56, and 2.39 nm for 1Pd1Zn, 1Pd3Zn, and 1Pd5Zn, respectively. It is suggested that the addition of Zn improves the dispersion of Pd.

Table 2 lists the dispersion of Pd particles calculated from CO chemisorption. The sample 1Pd has a Pd dispersion of 16.0%, and the Pd dispersion increased with increasing the Zn loading amount from 22.9% to 31.4% for the bimetallic samples, confirming that the addition of Zn can promote the dispersion of Pd on the alumina support.

3.1.3. XRD
Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the bare support and the catalysts after reduction treatment. All the catalyst samples present almost the same profile as the γ-Al2O3 support with no characteristic peaks corresponding to metallic Pd or Pd-Zn alloy. This is attributed to the small metal particles (less than 4 nm) that are lower than the detection limit of the instrument [38]. Previously, the PdZn alloy was reported to be generated from a PdZn bimetallic sample during the facile reduction process of ZnO which was caused by the spill-over of hydrogen from the Pd metal to ZnO [35], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. However, our XRD patterns do not show the formation of PdZn alloy in the prepared samples.

3.1.4. H2-TPR
H2-TPR analysis was performed to investigate the reducibility of the unreduced samples and to identify possible interactions between Pd and Zn. Fig. 3 shows the reduction profiles of the various samples. The TPR profile of the 3Zn sample is completely flat and does not show any peak because the reducibility of Zn is stronger than H2. The monometallic Pd (1Pd) sample displays two peaks at low temperatures (87.7 °C and 111.8 °C). This is ascribed to either the reduction of PdO species that have different interaction strengths with the support, or the two-step reduction of PdO [44]. Moreover, the monometallic Pd sample also presents a H2 consumption peak at 341.6 °C, attributed to the reduction of subsurface PdO [33]. For the PdZn bimetallic samples, H2 consumption peaks ranging from 50 to 200 °C are ascribed to the reduction of PdO and ZnO [41], [45]. The reduction peaks of PdZn samples shift to lower temperature and merge into one main peak when the Zn loading is more than 1 wt%, indicating that Zn additives enhance PdO reduction. In addition, the reduction peak of subsurface PdO is not observed due to the smaller metallic particle sizes of PdZn samples. Previously, Nilsson et al. reported that the reduction of ZnO can be facilitated in the presence of Pd and H2 [46]. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Zn can interact strongly with Pd species in the bimetallic samples to change the reducibility.

3.1.5. XPS
XPS analysis was performed to reveal the electronic interactions between Pd and Zn and the valence state of the surface Pd species for the catalysts. Fig. 4a shows the Pd3d XPS spectra of the catalysts. The peaks near 341.7 and 336.2 eV are attributed to Pd2+, while those at 340.0 and 334.7 eV due to Pd0 species [47]. The relative content of each palladium species of the catalyst is calculated by curve fitting and listed in Table 2. Fig. 4b shows the Zn2p3/2 XPS spectra of the catalysts with the peak around 1021.8 eV due to zinc species [48]. As listed in Table 2, the contents of Pd0 in the bimetallic samples are higher than that of 1Pd, increasing from 52.7% to 64.9% as the loading of Zn increases from 1 wt% to 5 wt%. It is illustrated that the Zn additives can transfer electrons to palladium species in the bimetallic samples.

3.1.6. O2-TPD and H2-TPD
The O2-TPD and H2-TPD profiles were recorded for all catalysts, as shown in Fig. S1 and Fig. S2 in Supplementary material. Neither the O2 desorption peak nor the H2 desorption peak is observed with the 3Zn sample, indicating that the monometallic 3Zn sample lacks affinity towards O2 and H2. With the 1Pd sample, the O2 desorption peak is detected at 216.5 °C, while the bimetallic samples had desorption temperature of 219.5 °C, 277.5 °C, and 233.1 °C for 1Pd1Zn, 1Pd3Zn, and 1Pd5Zn, respectively, i.e. the desorption temperature gradually increases with the loading amount of Zn. In the case of H2-TPD profiles, a similar tendency is observed, illustrating that the presence of Zn additives enhances the interactions between O2/H2 and Pd species. As listed in Table 3, the desorption amounts of both O2 and H2 increase strongly with the loading of Zn. Therefore, Zn addition can generate more adsorption sites in the bimetallic catalysts than monometallic 1Pd.

3.1.7. CO-DRIFTS
In situ DRIFTS measurements of CO adsorption were performed to study the nature of the exposed sites of the catalysts. Fig. 5 shows the DRIFT spectra for the monometallic Pd and PdZn bimetallic catalysts. In the case of the monometallic 1Pd catalyst, the bands observed at 2089, 1994, and 1941 cm−1 are attributed to CO adsorbed on different metallic Pd sites [49], [50]. The peak at 2089 cm−1 is related to linear CO species on isolated surface Pd sites [51], 1994 cm−1 is assigned to the bridged CO on the Pd edges [52], while 1941 cm−1 is due to the bridged CO species on Pd atoms exposed at the surface of either (100) or (111) facets [53]. For the bimetallic catalysts, all three peaks were red shifted; in particular, the peak intensity at 1941 cm−1 decreases significantly in 1Pd1Zn and 1Pd3Zn before finally disappearing in 1Pd5Zn. This indicates that the palladium surface structures are significantly modified by Zn. These peaks shifted to lower wavenumber, probably because of the enhanced d-orbital electron density resulting from the charge transfer from Zn to Pd species [27].

Fig. 5. In situ DRIFTS of CO adsorption over different catalysts.
The bridge-to-linear-bound ratio of the adsorbed CO species was calculated according to individual peak area, as listed in Table 3. This ratio is 7.59 for 1Pd, while it decreased regularly to 3.74 (1Pd5Zn), suggesting that the surface content of contiguous Pd sites is reduced, whereas the number of isolated Pd sites increased as the Zn loading was increased. It has been reported previously that Zn can break up Pd ensembles on the surface, thus reducing the number of neighboring Pd atoms, resulting in the formation of more Pd islands and single Pd surface atoms [35].
3.2. Catalytic behavior
3.2.1. H2O2 direct synthesis
All the synthesis experiments were carried out in triplicate to ensure the accuracy of the test. The catalytic performances of all the catalysts are summarized in Table 4. Among the catalysts, the 3Zn sample is not active in the H2O2 direct synthesis (the catalytic performance of 1 wt% and 3 wt% Zn behaves similarly), while 1Pd catalyst shows H2 conversion of 22.9% and H2O2 selectivity of 64.3%; the H2O2 productivity is 8533 mol kgPd−1 h−1. It is obvious that PdZn bimetallic catalysts show a significant improvement in catalytic performance compared with that shown by the monometallic Pd catalyst. In particular, H2O2 productivity increases from 8533 mol kgPd−1 h−1 over the 1Pd sample to 25431 mol kgPd−1 h−1 over 1Pd5Zn. Simultaneously, Zn addition results in higher H2O2 selectivity and H2 conversion; e.g. 1Pd1Zn has a H2O2 selectivity of 76.6% and H2 conversion of 42.8%. However, increasing the Zn loading cannot increase the H2O2 selectivity and the H2O2 productivity linearly. The catalytic performance we obtained was comparable to that reported in the related literature (as shown in Table 5).

We also assessed the stability of the catalysts with recycle experiments over 1Pd and 1Pd5Zn. As listed in Table 6, the re-used catalysts exhibited a slight decrease in productivity which resulted from the slight loss of Pd during the direct synthesis process.

3.2.2. H2O2 decomposition, hydrogenation and H2O formation from H2 and O2
In order to uncover the possible side reactions over the catalysts, H2O2 decomposition and hydrogenation reactions were carried out in H2O2-methanol solutions under N2 and H2 atmospheres, respectively. For H2O2 decomposition reaction, H2O2 consumption was not detected over these catalysts (Fig. 6); hence, these catalysts are inert toward the decomposition of H2O2 during the reaction. The H2O2 hydrogenation rate is 11816 kgPd−1 h−1 over 1Pd and increases with Zn loading, reaching 20888 mol H2O2 kgPd−1 h−1 over 1Pd5Zn.

Fig. 6. Decomposition and hydrogenation of H2O2 over catalysts.
The formation of H2O from H2 and O2 was also examined as a side reaction in this reaction system, which may occur simultaneously during the H2O2 synthesis process. We measured the selectivity over the monometallic Pd and PdZn catalysts under low H2 conversions by shortening the reaction time. At a very low conversion of H2, the contributions of both the hydrogenation of H2O2 and the decomposition of H2O2 are negligible to the overall rate of H2O2 synthesis [26]. H2O formation from H2 and O2 is the main side reaction responsible for lowering the selectivity of H2O2 under such conditions. As shown in Fig. S3 in Supplementary material, the 1Pd catalyst shows a H2O2 selectivity of 75.8% at a H2 conversion of 11.7%, suggesting that the monometallic Pd catalyst is very active in H2O formation from H2 and O2. The H2O2 selectivity over the PdZn bimetallic catalysts is higher than 90.0% when the H2 conversion is approximately 12.0%. Thus, the addition of Zn can effectively inhibit the formation of H2O from H2 and O2.
4. Discussion
Previous studies reported poor activity and selectivity for H2O2 by direct synthesis when using Al2O3 as a support. For example, Hutchings et al. reported that 5 wt% Pd/Al2O3 showed the H2O2 productivity of 9 mol kgcat−1 h−1 with a low selectivity [22]. However, Pashkova et al. obtained different results with respect to the activity and selectivity of Pd/Al2O3 [57]. The catalyst (Heraeus K-0219, 5 wt% Pd on Al2O3, particle size 10–20 mm) which they used achieved a H2O2 selectivity of 82–85% and a productivity of 6500 mol h−1 kgPd−1. Fan et al. demonstrated that both H2 conversion and H2O2 selectivity increased with increasing Pd loading up to a maximum followed by a decrease. H2O2 selectivity was about 40% and H2 conversion was about 60% over the best Pd loading of 1 wt% [58]. The poor catalytic performance of 5 wt% Pd/Al2O3 reported by Hutchings is possibly due to the different conditions applied in the direct synthesis process.
The addition of Zn into the Pd catalyst can significantly enhance the H2O2 productivity using H2 and O2 as the raw materials. From the above experimental results, the function of Zn addition on the H2O2 direct synthesis can be explained in terms of the geometric effect and the electronic effect in the bimetallic PdZn catalysts.
In this study, PdZn catalysts show a smaller particle size and higher Pd dispersion than the monometallic Pd sample, as measured by CO chemisorption and TEM. These observations are consistent with the measured catalytic activity, indicating that more exposed Pd atoms on the surface can increase the adsorption capacity of PdZn catalysts towards H2 and O2 (as determined by H2-/O2-TPD). Therefore a high H2 conversion and H2O2 productivity are achieved over bimetallic PdZn catalysts. In addition, the electronic interactions between Pd and Zn also play a positive role in augmenting the H2 conversion and the H2O2 productivity. As shown by XPS and CO-DRIFTS results, the fraction of Pd0 increased with the loading of Zn owing to charge transfer between Pd and Zn species. It has been demonstrated that Pd0 was more active than the corresponding Pd2+ in the direct H2O2 synthesis [59], [60], [61], [62], [63].
From the CO-DRIFTS analysis, the fraction of Pd linearly bound to CO increases at higher Zn loadings, indicating that the Zn additive can promote the formation of more isolated Pd sites and less contiguous Pd ensembles on the surface. It is well known for the direct synthesis of H2O2 that the formation of H2O2 results from the interaction of atomic H and molecular O2, while the dissociation of O2 usually leads to H2O formation from H2 and O2. Therefore, the activation of molecularly adsorbed O2 without dissociation is pivotal for this reaction system. Theoretical calculations and experimental results have confirmed that isolated Pd surrounded by less active metal atoms are more favorable for H2O2 formation than contiguous Pd ensembles by inhibiting OO bond scission [27], [33], [36], [64]. Therefore, we conclude that the enhanced H2O2 selectivity over PdZn bimetallic catalysts is attributed to the isolation of active Pd atoms by the Zn additive.
The addition of Zn results in a higher rate of H2O2 hydrogenation over palladium catalysts. The catalytic behavior is related to the high Pd dispersion and the incremental Pd0 content. First, PdZn bimetallic catalysts provide more adsorption sites for H2 than monometallic Pd, which affects the H2O2 hydrogenation activity. Secondly, Pd0 has been demonstrated to have a higher H2O2 hydrogenation activity than Pd2+ since H2O2 has higher propensity to get adsorbed on the Pd0 sites [59], [65].
5. Conclusion
In this work, monometallic Pd and PdZn bimetallic catalysts supported on Al2O3 were investigated for the direct synthesis of H2O2 from H2 and O2. The addition of Zn can significantly improve the catalytic performances of palladium catalysts. The promotional effect of the Zn additive is attributed to both the geometric change and the electronic interaction between Pd and Zn. The addition of Zn was beneficial to increase the dispersity of the active Pd on the Al2O3 support surface and also the amount of Pd0, which result in increased H2O2 productivity over the PdZn bimetallic catalysts. The high H2O2 selectivity results from the geometric effect between Pd and Zn; the presence of Zn increases the amount of isolated Pd sites and reduces the contiguous Pd sites, effectively suppressing the H2O formation from H2 and O2. However, the incremental Pd0 content and the increased adsorption capacity of H2 due to the Zn addition increased the rate of H2O2 hydrogenation. Combining the above trends, increasing the Zn loading can result in a weak incremental H2O2 selectivity.
