The supplied document does not discuss Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) or Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). It focuses on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane but not specifically to produce propylene via PDH or ODH. Therefore, I have indicated that the document is not relevant to assessing PDH or ODH catalyst advancements.
