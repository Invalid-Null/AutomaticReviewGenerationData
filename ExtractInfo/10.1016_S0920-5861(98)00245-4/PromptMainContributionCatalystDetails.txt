Promoting effects of CO2 on dehydrogenation of propane over a SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalyst
Abstract
The effects of carbon dioxide on the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to produce C3H6 were investigated over several Cr2O3 catalysts supported on Al2O3, active carbon and SiO2. Carbon dioxide exerted promoting effects only on SiO2-supported Cr2O3 catalysts. The promoting effects of carbon dioxide over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation.
1. Introduction
The utilization of carbon dioxide has recently received much attention since the global warming mainly due to carbon dioxide was recognized as one of the most serious problems in the world. The catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 to produce methanol, hydrocarbons, etc., and the CO2 reforming of methane to syngas have been extensively studied. Furthermore, it has been reported that CO2 has several promoting effects on the conversion of hydrocarbons, for example, oxidative coupling of methane [1], aromatization of propane [2]and dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene 3, 4. The authors have investigated the effect of CO2 on the dehydrogenation of propane over several supported Cr2O3 catalysts, and found that CO2 has promoting effects on silica-supported Cr2O3 catalysts.
2. Experimental
Several supported Cr2O3 catalysts were prepared by an impregnation method using an aqueous solution of chromium nitrate. The supports used were γ-Al2O3, active carbon (AC) and SiO2. The catalysts were calcined at 823 K in air for 2 h. The catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD patterns of Cr2O3/Al2O3 and Cr2O3/AC showed the diffraction lines ascribed only to the phases of respective supports. In the case of Cr2O3/SiO2, a Cr2O3 phase and an amorphous SiO2 phase were observed. The post-reactor XRD was performed. In Cr2O3/Al2O3 and Cr2O3/AC, the observed patterns were not changed, but the diffraction of Cr2O3 was increased slightly in Cr2O3/SiO2. The dehydrogenation of C3H8 was conducted under atmospheric pressure of C3H8+CO2(Ar) at 823 K by using a fixed bed flow reactor. TPR/D studies were carried out to elucidate the behavior of Cr2O3 in the catalyst during treatment with H2 and CO2. A pulse reaction technique was also employed for examining the initial activity of the catalyst.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effects of CO2 on dehydrogenation of C3H8
The main products of the conversion of C3H8 in the presence of Ar were C3H6 and H2, while those in the presence of CO2 were C3H6, H2, and CO, as shown in Table 1. Since the selectivities for C3H6 were more than 90%, the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H6 should be the main reaction both in the presence of CO2 and in the absence of CO2. The yield of H2+CO was found to be higher than C3H6 yield over all catalysts used in the present study. There might be three possible routes for CO formation; the first one via the successive reactions (1) and (2), the second one via the reaction (3) and the third one via CO2 reforming of C3H8 (reaction (4)) as shown below:

Fig. 1 shows the activities of several supported Cr2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the presence of CO2 as well as in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was much lower in the presence of CO2 than that in the absence of CO2. The activity of the Cr2O3/AC was independent of the presence of CO2. On the other hand, the activity of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst in the presence of CO2 was surprisingly found to be 40% higher than that in the absence of CO2.

Fig. 2 shows the selectivities for H2 and CO as a function of C3H6 yield. In the case of Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, the selectivity for H2 decreased with an increase in C3H6 yield, whereas the selectivity for CO increased with an increase in C3H6 yield, as shown in Fig. 2(A). On the other hand, the selectivities of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst for CO and H2 did not change irrespective of C3H6 yield, as shown in Fig. 2(B). These findings suggest that CO might be formed via successive reactions (1) and (2) over Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, whereas both the reactions (1) and (3) could take place simultaneously over Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst.

In order to study the contribution of CO2 in the conversion of C3H8 to C3H6 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, catalytic tests with alternate feeds of C3H8/Ar and C3H8/CO2/Ar were carried out. The results shown in Fig. 3 clearly indicate that the presence of CO2 markedly improved the yield of C3H6. This catalytic performance is a proof that CO2 plays a promoting role in the conversion of C3H8 to C3H6 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst.

Furthermore, the ratio of C3H6 yield in the reaction in the presence of CO2 to that in the absence of CO2 decreased with increasing Cr2O3 content in the Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst, as shown in Fig. 4. This suggests that the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles might have an important role in the promoting effect of CO2.

The effect of CO2 addition on the deactivation of a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst was also examined (Fig. 5). The reaction conditions for both the cases with and without CO2 were the same except the catalyst weight, which was 50% larger in the case of the reaction without CO2, in order to obtain the same initial yield of C3H6. The decrease in the yield of C3H6 was found much less in the presence of CO2 than in the absence of CO2. This finding suggests that the addition of CO2 could suppress the deactivation of the catalyst.

3.2. TPR/D result
Fig. 6 shows TPR/D profiles during various treatments of Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. The Cr2O3 was found to be reduced in a stream of H2. And smaller peaks were observed when the catalyst, which was reduced with H2 and then treated with CO2, was re-reduced with H2. This suggests that CO2 could oxidize some part of the surface of Cr2O3 in the catalyst. Accordingly, these findings suggest that the surface of Cr2O3 on a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be reduced during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 in the absence of CO2, whereas the surface of Cr2O3 might be maintained partially oxidized during the reaction in the presence of CO2.

3.3. Pulse reaction
A pulse reaction technique was employed for examining the initial activity of the catalyst. Fig. 7 shows the conversion of C3H8 and the yield of hydrocarbon products as a function of the number of C3H8 pulses on Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. The yield of C3H6 reached a maximum of about 21% at the second pulse. After the second pulse, the yield of C3H6 slightly decreased with increasing pulse number. The yield of C3H6 decreased to 17% by the treatment of the catalyst with H2 after fifth pulse, and remained constant from sixth pulse to ninth pulse. The treatment of the catalyst with CO2 after ninth pulse raised the yield of C3H6 to 19%, but the yield of C3H6 gradually decreased with increasing pulse number from tenth pulse. These findings confirm that partially oxidized Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst could be more active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 than a reduced catalyst. The results obtained from pulse reaction studies and from TPR/D studies might explain slower deactivation of the catalyst during the dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2.

Furthermore, pulse reaction studies were performed for comparing between the yield of C3H6 during the reaction in a stream of CO2 and in a stream of He. The C3H6 yield at the first pulse and the second pulse in the presence of CO2 was found to be higher than those in the absence of CO2. This strongly suggests that CO2 could enhance the rate of the dehydrogenation of C3H8 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst. This promoting effect of CO2 might occur at the boundaries between Cr2O3 and SiO2 particles.
4. Conclusion
Carbon dioxide promotion of propane dehydrogenation performance was only observed on SiO2 supported catalysts. The promoting effects of CO2 over a Cr2O3/SiO2 catalyst were to enhance the yield of C3H6 and to suppress the catalyst deactivation. The partially oxidized Cr2O3 supported on SiO2 catalyst is active for the dehydrogenation of C3H8. In the presence of CO2, the surface of Cr2O3/SiO2 might be maintained to be partially oxidized during the reaction.
