Acidic nanomaterials (TiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3) are coke storage components that reduce the deactivation of the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in propane dehydrogenation†
Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were physically mixed with various nanostructured metal oxides (TiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3) and investigated as catalysts for propane dehydrogenation at 550 °C and atmospheric pressure. The additives did not affect the catalytic activity or selectivity for the main product (propylene), but they markedly enhanced the catalyst stability. The benefit arose because coke deposition on Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 decreased by approximately 3%, 19%, and 32% as a result of addition of Al2O3, ZrO2, and TiO2, respectively. The deposits of both aliphatic and aromatic coke on the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were reduced when the additives were present, as shown by temperature-programmed oxidation, infrared, and ultraviolet-visible data characterizing the used catalysts. Catalyst characterization data including surface areas, temperature-programmed reduction profiles, NH3 (and O2) temperature-programmed desorption profiles, X-ray photoelectron spectra, CO-chemisorption data, and in situ differential scanning calorimetry data show that the number of oxygen vacancy defect sites play a key role in the adsorption of coke precursors generated on Pt particles, leading to decreased coke deposition on Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 and, correspondingly, increased coke deposition on the acidic additives. Moreover, an in situ infrared investigation of propadiene adsorption led to the conclusion that aliphatic coke is transformed into aromatic coke and that this transformation is related to the deep dehydrogenation reaction.
1. Introduction
Coke formation is the principal cause of catalyst deactivation in petroleum refining and petrochemical conversion; it is associated with high-temperature operation, especially in endothermic processes.1,2 Normally, coke forms on the catalyst surface from a coke precursor.3 Coke can be deposited on both the metal and the acidic support in supported metal catalysts.4,5 Coke precursors are formed by deep dehydrogenation and polymerization, and then soft coke is generated on the metal from the coke precursor. This coke precursor migrates to acidic sites, where it undergoes polymerization/oligomerization, condensation, cyclization, and hydride transfer, resulting in the formation of hard coke.6,7
A number of strategies have been suggested to help maintain the stabilities of catalytic sites. The shift of the coke precursor from metal sites to support sites has been found to be enhanced by the addition of promoters such as Sn.5,8–10 The enhancement of alkene product desorption to diminish the possibility of coke formation through deep dehydrogenation was investigated by the addition of metals such as Cu,11 Ti,12 and Fe.13 Furthermore, the addition of alkali, alkaline earth, and some other metals (Li,14 K,15 Ca (ref. 16) and In (ref. 17)) was found to suppress the strong acidity responsible for reactions including cracking, oligomerization, cyclization, and coke formation. However, many reactions require acidic properties to catalyze the reaction, and it is difficult to decrease coke formation by methods other than decreasing the acidity of the catalyst.18 An interesting approach to maintaining the optimized properties of the catalyst is to include components that facilitate storage of coke on their surfaces—removed from the active sites.
In recent years, acidic metal oxide nanomaterials have been found to be attractive catalysts because of their high specific surface areas, strong acidities, and high densities of oxygen vacancies as defect sites.19,20 These properties of acidic metal oxide nanomaterials are expected to be correlated with their coke formation and coke storage tendencies. Many acidic catalysts, such as TiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3, have been used to catalyze many acid-catalyzed reactions.21 However, many reports have stated that the intrinsic acidity of the support, especially of strongly acidic sites, can favor undesirable reactions that result in coke formation.14,15 Both the acidic properties and the density of oxygen vacancies as defect sites of metal oxides can influence adsorption and catalytic sites.22–24 It is possible that oxygen vacancies will play important roles in adsorbing and storing coke in mixed catalyst systems.
To test these ideas, the work reported here was performed to investigate acidic nanomaterials (TiO2, ZrO2, and Al2O3) that were physically mixed with a Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, with propane dehydrogenation used as a model reaction. Dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic process, and it requires elevated temperatures for high yields of the desired product.25,26 However, the high reaction temperature results in major challenges associated with hydrocarbon cracking and coke formation, which respectively reduce the selectivity to desired products and cause catalyst deactivation.9,17 Thus, in the work reported here, the dehydrogenation reaction was studied as a model reaction to determine the roles of added nanomaterials in coke formation in mixed catalysts.
2. Experimental methods
2.1 Catalyst preparation
The Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness co-impregnation method. First, extruded γ-Al2O3 (Sasol) used as the support was ground and sieved to a mesh size of 250–400 μm. The support was then impregnated with a mixture of chloroplatinic acid hydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) and tin chloride dihydrate (Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol solution (Labscan). The Pt and Sn metal loadings were 0.3 wt% for Pt and 0.3 wt% for Sn. The impregnated sample was dried in ambient air for 2 h and subsequently in an oven at 110 °C for 10 h. The sample was calcined at 550 °C for 3 h to remove impurities. N2 gas was introduced into a flow reactor tube at a rate of 60 mL min−1. The temperature of the calcination furnace was ramped at a rate of 10 °C min−1. The N2 stream was switched to air at a flow rate of 100 mL min−1 when the temperature reached 550 °C. TiO2 (21 nm, Deggusa), ZrO2 (24 nm, Sigma-Aldrich), and Al2O3 (<50 nm, Sigma-Aldrich) were used as acidic nanomaterials that were physically mixed with the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in 1 : 1 mass ratios.
2.2 Catalyst characterization
The specific surface area (SBET), pore volume (Vpore), and average mean pore diameter of the acidic nanomaterials were calculated from nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms collected on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 automatic adsorption analyzer. The sample was outgassed for 4 h in flowing N2 before performing N2 physisorption at −196 °C. The SBET was determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and the pore volume and mean pore diameter were calculated by applying the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method to the data from the desorption branch of the isotherm.
The reducibility of the acidic nanomaterials was observed by temperature-programmed reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR). H2-TPR profiles were obtained by using a Micromeritics Chemisorbs 2750 automatic system with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Prior to the measurement, the 100 mg sample was pretreated in Ar (99.99%, 25 mL min−1) at 700 °C for 1 h. After cooling of the sample to room temperature in Ar, the gas flow was switched to 10% H2 in Ar (15 mL min−1), and the sample was heated from room temperature to 900 °C with a temperature ramp of 10 °C min−1.
The total acidities of the nanomaterials were measured by temperature-programed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD), using a Micromeritics Chemisorb 2750 automated system. The sample was pretreated in flowing He at 550 °C for 1 h and cooled to room temperature before a 30% NH3/He gas mixture was allowed to flow over the sample for 0.5 h for adsorption of NH3 on the acidic sites. Then the excess ammonia was purged by flowing He at room temperature for 1 h. The catalyst was heated and the TPD profile was determined by analysis of the effluent with a thermal conductivity detector and analysis of the data with ChemiSoft TPx software.
CO-Pulse chemisorption experiments to count surface metal sites were performed with a Micromeritic ChemiSorb 2750 automatic system and ChemiSoft TPx software. Metal dispersions were determined by pulsing CO over the reduced catalyst. Approximately 100 mg of catalyst was placed in a quartz tube placed in a temperature-controlled oven and connected to a TXD. Prior to chemisorption of CO, the catalyst was reduced in flowing H2 (50 mL min−1) at 500 °C for 1 h. Then the sample was cooled to 40 °C with helium flow and held at this temperature for 1 h for removal of any physically adsorbed CO. Then pulse injections of CO were conducted to characterize the reduced catalyst until its metal sites were saturated with CO.
Oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD) analysis was performed with a Micrometrics Chemisorbs 2750 automated system. The sample was reduced in a mixture of flowing H2 (99.99%, 25 mL min−1) and N2 (99.999%, 25 mL min−1) at 500 °C for 1 h, and then it was heated to 550 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 in flowing N2 for 30 min. After H2/N2 reduction, the sample was cooled to 40 °C in flowing He, followed by exposure to flowing 1% O2/He for 30 min at 40 °C for O2 adsorption. Then the sample was purged with He for 1 h at 40 °C to remove any physically adsorbed O2. Finally, the sample in flowing He was heated to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. The desorbed O2 was monitored with a TCD.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed with an AMICUS photoelectron spectrometer equipped for Mg Kα X-ray radiation and operated at a voltage of 10 kV and a current of 20 mA.
In situ differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to evaluate the adsorption energy of 4% propylene and 4% propadiene (coke precursor) in N2; 100 mg of nanomaterial was packed in a gas circulation cell and placed into a furnace. The sample was reduced in flowing H2 + N2 (99.99% H2, 25 mL min−1 + 99.999% N2, 25 mL min−1) at 500 °C for 1 h and then heated to 550 °C for 30 min in flowing N2. Then the sample was cooled to room temperature, and the circulation cell was removed and placed into the furnace chamber in the sample cell holder of a calorimeter (C-80 Calvet Calorimetry, SETARAM Instrumentation). Then a stream of propylene or propadiene as the probe molecule was fed simultaneously at a rate of 20 mL min−1 to the reference cell and sample cell with N2 carrier gas at 40 °C. The total heat evolved was measured with a 3D Calvet sensor with a high sensitivity of 30 μW mW−1 and resolution of 0.10 μW. The total energy was converted with CALISTO software to analyze the adsorption energy of propylene and propadiene on the materials.
The amount of coke on the catalysts was examined by temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). The spent catalyst was placed in the reactor in flowing 1%O2/He and heated at a rate of 5 °C min−1 until the temperature reached 700 °C. The TPO technique was carried out on a Micromeritics Chemisorb 2750 automated system. CO and CO2 can be analyzed every 5 min on-line by using a Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatograph with an Rt®-Q-BOND-fused silica plot column but only CO2 is detected as the product of the TPO and its concentration is determined.
The forms of the coke on the spent catalyst samples (aliphatic and aromatic) were determined by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The experiments were conducted with a Bruker Vertex-70 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a Harrick Praying Mantis attachment for diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The sample mass was 160 mg. Moreover, aromatic coke on the catalysts was further observed by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy. The sample were examined with a Lambda 650 UV-vis spectrometer in the range of 200–800 nm at ambient temperature.
The mechanism of coke formation on the nanomaterials was investigated by in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (in situ DRIFTS). The sample was reduced in flowing H2 (10 mL min−1) and N2 (10 mL min−1) at 500 °C for 1 h and then heated to 550 °C for 30 min in flowing N2 and subsequently cooled to 40 °C in N2 at a flow rate of 10 mL min−1, followed by recording of a background spectrum. Then the sample was exposed to 4% propadiene in N2 (10 mL min−1) flowing at 40 °C for 30 min to ensure the steady-state conditions and subsequently purged with N2 at a flow rate of 10 mL min−1 to remove any physically adsorbed propadiene, and then the IR spectrum was recorded. Then the sample temperature was increased to 100, 200, and 300 °C in N2 flowing at a rate of 10 mL min−1, whereupon the previous step was repeated to obtain the IR spectra at each of the corresponding temperatures.
2.3 Catalyst performance testing
The dehydrogenation of propane was performed at atmospheric pressure in a fixed-bed stainless steel flow reactor with a diameter of 0.75 in. The mass ratio of physically mixed Pt–Sn/Al2O3 and acidic nanomaterial was 1 : 1. Moreover, inert spherical particles of ceramic balls were also mixed with the Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst with the same ratio as the reference catalyst. At the beginning, 4 g of catalyst was placed in the stainless-steel reactor and reduced in flowing H2 (50 mL min−1) mixed with N2 (50 mL min−1) at 500 °C for 1 h followed by purging with N2 to remove H2 at 550 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, pure propane gas was fed into the reactor at a temperature of 550 °C at a rate of 20 mL min−1. The reaction was carried out for 5.1 h time-on-stream (TOS). The reactants and products were analyzed online using an Agilent 7820A gas chromatograph equipped with a packed column HP-PLOT Al2O3 “M” deactivated (50 m with 8 μm ID) and a flame ionization detector (FID). The propane conversion and product selectivity were calculated on a weight basis using the following equations:

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Catalyst performance
The catalytic performance of Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 mixed with various components is shown in Fig. 1a. Propane conversions of 26–31% were observed initially which decreased significantly with time on stream. The initial conversions were slightly higher when the additional components were present with Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3. The deactivation is quantified by a parameter (D) defined in eqn (3) as the average deactivation rate. The values of D for Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 + inert, Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2 nanomaterials were 53.4, 54.9, 30.3, and 20.5%, respectively, indicating how the added components affected the average rate of deactivation of Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3.

Side reactions including hydrogenolysis, cracking, and coke formation compete with the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Propylene is the major product of the reaction, with methane, ethane, and ethylene being by-products.10,16 The initial propylene selectivity data characterizing the catalysts (Fig. 1b) show that the selectivity for its formation decreased when the added components were present.
Propane dehydrogenation experiments characterizing the nanomaterials in the absence of Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 were also conducted, and the propane conversion data are summarized in Table S1 in the ESI.† Propane was converted to light hydrocarbons on these nanomaterials, especially on TiO2. Propane cracking to methane and ethylene was clearly observed, while propylene was generated by propane dehydrogenation. Propane cracking affected mainly the product selectivity over Al2O3. On the other hand, propane conversion on TiO2 proceeded mainly through dehydrogenation. In summary, increased initial conversions and decreased propylene selectivities were found when the additional components were mixed with Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3.
The formation of ethylene from propane was not observed in the presence of the Pt catalyst. It could have formed and been hydrogenated to form ethane, especially at the initial stage of the reaction, as reported by Bariås et al.10 After the catalyst had undergone deactivation, the selectivity to propylene had increased. Bai et al.16 suggested that initially coking occurred rapidly on the metallic sites that were active for hydrogenolysis, causing a gradual blocking of the active sites by carbonaceous deposits. In the work reported here, it was found that addition of the acidic components led to a slightly increased selectivity to propylene, but, we infer, not by increasing the selectivity for propylene formation as the primary product of propane dehydrogenation but rather by reducing the deactivation of the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Thus, we sought to further investigate the role of the added materials in affecting the stability of the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst.
3.2 Characterization of fresh catalysts
The textural properties of the various nanomaterials were investigated (Table S2†). Nano-Al2O3 showed the highest surface area and pore volume and the smallest pores among all these nanomaterials. The surface areas of these materials (and the pore volumes) decreased in the following order: Al2O3 > TiO2 > ZrO2.
The acid site strengths of the nanomaterials investigated with NH3-TPD (Fig. S1†) and the numbers of acid sites are summarized in Table S3 in the ESI.† It is well known that Al2O3, ZrO2, and TiO2 are acidic catalysts.27 Generally, the first TPD peak can be assigned to the weaker acid sites and the latter one corresponds to stronger acid sites.28 The first desorption peak (100 °C) can be attributed to weak acid sites, the second (225 °C) to medium acid sites, and the third (360 °C) is typical of strong acid sites. Weak, medium, and strong acid sites were found on all the nanomaterials. The total numbers of acidic sites (per unit mass) decreased in the following order: Al2O3 > TiO2 > ZrO2, and the numbers of weak, medium, and strong acid sites decreased in the same order.
The reducibility of each of the added components was investigated by H2-TPR (Fig. S2†). There was no obvious H2 consumption peak characterizing Al2O3, as it is well known that Al2O3 is a nonreducible oxide. In contrast, ZrO2 and TiO2 were characterized by reduction peaks, indicating that H2 molecules accessed and reacted with the surface oxygen species of these oxides—which are well known as reducible oxides.29 ZrO2 was characterized by a reduction peak at 630 °C and TiO2 by a reduction peak at 545 °C; thus, TiO2 was more easily reduced than ZrO2.
The metal active sites on the catalyst were evaluated by CO chemisorption after being mixed with each of the additive nanomaterials (Table S4†). The chemisorption results indicate that addition of these materials increased CO chemisorption on the catalysts. There is no basis for suggesting that the added materials had a negative effect on the Pt dispersion, and so we infer that the increased CO uptake was evidence of adsorption of CO on the added components. CO can adsorb, for example, on the coordinatively unsaturated surface metal ion of these oxides.30 The pattern of increasing CO chemisorption matched the trend of increasing reducibility of the nanomaterials, suggesting that reduced ZrO2 and TiO2 provided the sites for CO chemisorption.
The oxygen vacancy sites on the added nanomaterials were characterized by O2-TPD. As displayed in Fig. S3,† each of these materials exhibited three O2-desorption peaks, centred at 80–175, 300–375, and 650 °C, which we refer to as OI, OII, and OIII, respectively. As has been reported, the OI species represent the chemisorbed oxygen on oxygen vacancies, probably generated at structural defects of high-energy surfaces; the OII species correspond to surface lattice oxygen; the OIII species are ascribed to the lattice oxygen in the bulk.31 The surface densities of oxygen vacancies estimated on the basis of the amounts of chemisorbed oxygen follow the order: TiO2 (0.93) > ZrO2 (0.56) > Al2O3 (0.44) (Table S5†).
XPS was carried out to investigate the surface chemical states of the oxygen-containing species on the nanomaterials. The spectra are displayed in Fig. S4,† and the Oads/Olatt ratios calculated from the corresponding peak areas are summarized in Table S6.† The O 1s spectra show three peaks, centered at 529.6–529.9, 530.5–531.5 and 532.5–533.5 eV. Each can be assigned to lattice O2− ions (OL), native defects of O2− vacancies (OV), and H2O or C–O bonded to the surface (OC), respectively.32 The data show that the surface oxygen vacancies (OV)/lattice oxygen (OL) increased in the sequence of Al2O3 < ZrO2 < TiO2, consistent with the O2-TPD results.
It is expected that during catalysis propane was dehydrogenated to give propylene via a conventional pathway, with propadiene produced by deep dehydrogenation of propylene as a coke precursor.1,33 Thus, the adsorption energies of propylene and propadiene on the added nanomaterials are considered to be valuable, and we investigated them by in situ DSC. As presented in Table S7,† it was found that propylene adsorption energies on these materials decreased in the following order: TiO2 (1.46 J gcat−1) > ZrO2 (1.27 J gcat−1) > Al2O3 (1.03 J gcat−1). The corresponding data for propadiene adsorption are TiO2 (6.50 J gcat−1) > ZrO2 (5.33 J gcat−1) > Al2O3 (5.07 J gcat−1). The adsorption energy of propadiene was thus found to be higher than that of propylene, consistent with the results of Pálfi et al.,34 with the values greater for TiO2 than those for the other oxides.
3.3 Characterization of spent catalysts
TPO measurements were carried out to investigate the locations of the coke components, as shown in Fig. 2. Before the TPO experiment, the spent Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was separated from the added nanomaterials. The TPO profiles of the spent Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and spent nanomaterials are shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. Generally, TPO profiles of coke on Pt-containing dehydrogenation catalysts are characterized by three peaks: peak I at 275–320 °C, peak II at 400–480 °C, and peak III at 480–550 °C. Peak I is ascribed to carbon deposited on metal sites, whereas peaks II and III correspond to two different forms of coke on the support. Peak II is assigned to the carbon deposited on the acidic sites of the support in the vicinity of the metal particles, and peak III is associated with the carbon deposited on the acidic sites of the support far away from any metal sites.7,35Table 1B shows a summary of data characterizing the amount of coke deposited on the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and each of the nanomaterials. The data clearly show that coke deposition on Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 decreased with nanomaterial addition, in contrast to what was observed when the inert material was added instead of one of the nanomaterials. The amount of coke deposited on the metal sites (peak I) of the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was markedly decreased when the added nanomaterial was ZrO2. The amount of coke deposited on the support sites of the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, that deposited in the vicinity of the metal sites (peak II), and that deposited far from the metal sites (peak III) decreased in the following order: Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 with added inert material > Al2O3 > ZrO2 > TiO2. TiO2 addition showed the lowest formation of coke on the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, whereas coke deposition on separated nanomaterials clearly increased in a different order: TiO2 > ZrO2 > Al2O3 > inert. The decrease of coke on the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts correlates well with the increased coke on the added nanomaterials. The results thus indicate that the coke precursors generated on Pt sites were captured by the nanomaterials. This process led to decreased coke deposition on the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts by about 3, 19, and 32% when the added materials were Al2O3, ZrO2, and TiO2, respectively. The amounts of coke deposited on the nanomaterials were quite large, but that coke was soft coke, as shown in Fig. 2b.

a Coke on nanomaterials during propane dehydrogenation. b Coke on separated Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 and separated nanomaterials during propane dehydrogenation.
Coke formation during propane dehydrogenation catalysis was further investigated with the nanomaterials in the absence of the Pt catalyst, as shown in Table 1A. Coke deposition on Al2O3 and ZrO2 was very little, but it was much higher on TiO2. As discussed in the catalytic performance section, propane obviously cracked when the additive was Al2O3, but it was dehydrogenated when the additive was TiO2. These results imply that dehydrogenation led to high rates of deposition of coke on TiO2. Normally, in propane dehydrogenation catalysis, coke precursors are formed by deep dehydrogenation.5,12,36 However, in the presence of a Pt catalyst, the coke deposition on the added nanomaterial was markedly increased. Normally, a coke precursor generated on the metal will also migrate to the acidic sites. On these sites, the coke precursor undergoes polymerization/oligomerization, condensation, cyclization, and hydride transfer, resulting in the formation of hard coke.6,7 Our data suggest that the added nanomaterial captures coke precursors generated on Pt metal sites on the dehydrogenation catalyst, resulting in decreased coke deposition on the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and therefore increased stability.
Next, we discuss the decreased coke deposition on the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and the enhanced stability for propane dehydrogenation when the added components are present. The Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst with added ZrO2 was characterized by the lowest coke deposition on Pt metal sites among all the nanomaterials used as additives in this work—and consequently, this combination gave the most stable propane dehydrogenation catalyst of those investigated in this work—thus, less coke on the metal surface and correspondingly better stability of the catalyst.11,12
Coke deposition on Pt metal sites was not significantly decreased when TiO2 was added, but coke deposition on the support in the vicinity of the metal particles was clearly decreased. Correspondingly, the catalyst performance data show that TiO2 addition to the catalyst improved its stability as well. In contrast, coke deposition on the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst with added Al2O3 was not significantly decreased, and the catalyst stability was essentially unimproved. Thus, we infer that the improved catalyst stability depended not only on the reduction of the amount of coke deposition on Pt metal sites but also on the reduction of the amount of coke deposition on the support in the vicinity of the Pt metal particles.
We further investigated how an increase in the amount of coke deposited on the nanomaterial was related to the coke precursors generated on the Pt metal particles. Thus, we did a qualitative analysis of the coke composition on the catalyst. The IR spectra of the spent Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and the spent nanomaterial separated from the catalyst after 5.1 h on stream are presented in Fig. 3. The adsorption bands between 1400 and 1450 cm−1 can be ascribed to the skeletal vibrations of branched aliphatics. The bands between 1640 and 1680 cm−1 represent the stretching vibrations of CC in alkenes, and the bands between 1500 and 1630 cm−1 can be assigned to the vibrations of CC in aromatics.5,37,38 The IR spectra indicate that the coke deposited on the separated Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and nanomaterial incorporated both aliphatics and aromatics. The peak area corresponding to aliphatics is much greater than that corresponding to aromatics, implying the relatively low aromatic character of the coke. This result is consistent with results of Wang et al.,5 who investigated coke formation on Pt–Sn/Al2O3 used to catalyze propane dehydrogenation; they found that the coke formed on the Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst was 69 wt% aliphatic, 4.4 wt% aromatic, and 26.6 wt% pre-graphitic coke.

Fig. 3a shows data characterizing the forms of coke on our spent Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. The amounts of aliphatic and aromatic coke on the spent Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst clearly decreased with nanomaterial addition. The amounts are characterized by the following order: Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 with the addition of inert material > Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 with the addition of Al2O3 > Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 with the addition of ZrO2 > Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 with the addition of TiO2. This trend is similar to the trend of amounts of coke indicated by the TPO data. The results thus indicate that coke deposition in the forms of aliphatics and aromatics on Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 decreased with nanomaterial addition.
Fig. 3b shows data characterizing the forms of coke on the spent nanomaterial. The two peaks shown represent the aliphatic and aromatic coke. The amounts of aliphatic coke on the various additive materials decreased in the following order: Al2O3 > ZrO2 > TiO2. In contrast, the aromatic coke amounts increased in the following order: Al2O3 < ZrO2 < TiO2—opposite to that for the aliphatic coke. These data may be an indication of the transformation of aliphatic to aromatic coke on the acidic materials.5,39
UV-vis spectroscopy was used to monitor the formation of coke species, especially the aromatic nature of the coke, on the spent catalysts (Fig. 4). On the basis of literature results,40 the UV region with bands at frequencies >35 000 cm−1 is assigned to neutral aromatic species, whereas those at lower frequencies are assigned to conjugated carbocations, including protonated aromatics. With increasing size of the conjugated carbocations, the absorption band occurs at lower wavenumbers. Neutral and charged polyaromatic species absorb at wavenumbers <23 000 cm−1. The bands in the gap between 35 000 and 30 000 cm−1 are ascribed to charged monoenyl or cyclopentenyl species. The bands at approximately 27 000 and 25 000 cm−1 are assigned to charged polyalkylated benzene species and the bands at approximately 25 000 and 23 000 cm−1 to charged alkylated naphthalene species. The data show that neutral aromatic, charged polyalkylated benzene, charged alkylated naphthalene, and charged polyaromatic species were formed on Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 during propane dehydrogenation catalysis, as shown in Fig. 4a. The nanomaterials added to the catalyst led to a decreasing aromatic character of the coke on Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3, which is consistent with the IR results. Small decreases of charged polyalkylated benzene, charged alkylated naphthalene, and neutral and charged polyaromatic species on the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst were found when Al2O3 was added. The addition of ZrO2 and TiO2 significantly reduced the amount of charged polyalkylated benzene, charged alkylated naphthalene, and neutral and charged polyaromatic species and also reduced the amount of neutral aromatic species. TiO2 addition gave the lowest amount of aromatic coke on the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, especially for the higher-molecular-weight aromatic coke. The decreasing amount of high-molecular-weight aromatic coke components, such as charged alkylated naphthalene and neutral and charged polyaromatic species, on the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was in the following order: Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 with the addition of inert material > Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 with the addition of Al2O3 > Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 with the addition of ZrO2 > Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 with the addition of TiO2. Fig. 4b shows the types of aromatic coke on the spent nanomaterials separated from the mixed catalysts. Neutral aromatic species were largely found on ZrO2, whereas charged alkylated naphthalene and neutral and charged polyaromatic species were the predominant coke forms on TiO2. These coke amounts are related to the coke amounts on Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3. Nevertheless, a small amount of aromatic coke was found on spent Al2O3.

It is commonly believed that propadiene is formed by deep dehydrogenation of propylene and is critical for coke formation reactions in propane dehydrogenation.5,12,36 Wang et al.5 investigated the mechanism of coke formation on the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst by using in situ DRIFTS. They proposed that the aliphatic coke can be transformed into aromatic coke, and this transformation is associated with deep dehydrogenation reactions. In our investigation, the pathway of coke formation on the added nanomaterial was also investigated by in situ DRIFTS, with results shown in Fig. 5. The IR bands at approximately 1644–1700 cm−1 are assigned to the characteristic band of CC stretching of alkenes. The bands at approximately 2950–3020 cm−1 are ascribed to C–H vibrations in –CH3 species in aliphatic hydrocarbons. The bands between 1400 and 1575 cm−1 are assigned to the skeleton vibration of CC in aromatic rings.5 At the temperature of 40 °C, intense IR bands at about 1644–1700 cm−1 were observed, indicating propadiene adsorption on the nanomaterial, and bands at about 2950–3020 cm−1, ascribed to aliphatic hydrocarbons, also appeared. The CC stretching bands of alkenes continuously decreased in intensity with increasing temperature, and the band of aliphatic hydrocarbons also increased, indicating the formation of aliphatic coke on the nanomaterials. When the temperature was increased to 200 °C, bands at approximately 1644–1700 cm−1, ascribed to aromatic rings, were observed. Further increasing the temperature to 300 °C led to the observation of the bands characteristic of the aromatic ring, which increased in intensity as the intensity of the aliphatic band decreased. Thus, the quantity of aromatic coke increased with increasing temperature, and the amount of aliphatic coke concomitantly decreased. These results imply that the aliphatic coke transformed into aromatic coke at elevated temperatures, as was observed by Wang et al.5
Fig. 5 In situ DRIFTS study of propadiene on the acidic nanomaterials at different temperatures.
Table S8† is a summary of the various coke forms observed in the DRIFTS characterization of propadiene adsorption at various temperatures. Propadiene adsorbed on TiO2 and ZrO2 continuously decreased as the temperature increased, disappearing when the temperature reached 300 °C, whereas propadiene adsorbed on Al2O3 remained unaltered at 300 °C. These results are related to those characterizing aliphatic coke, which appeared with increasing temperature and then decreased as aromatic coke formed. This proposed pathway is consistent with the large amounts of aromatic coke formed on TiO2 and on ZrO2, as shown by the UV-vis spectra. On the other hand, the aliphatic coke on Al2O3 continuously increased in amount with increasing temperature, and a small amount of aromatic coke was observed. These results indicates that a small amount of aliphatic coke on Al2O3 can be transformed into aromatic coke. In other words, there was a limitation on the formation of high-molecular-weight coke on Al2O3. According to the TPO data, the in situ DSC data characterizing propylene and propadiene adsorption, and the in situ DRIFTS data characterizing propadiene adsorption, these results imply that the formation of aromatic coke could be associated with deep dehydrogenation reactions.
3.4 Effect of oxygen vacancies of acidic nanomaterials for capturing coke in propane dehydrogenation
According to many reports, most acidic catalysts lead to the deposition of large amounts of coke on the catalyst surface. The acidity, especially the strong-acid sites on the catalysts, must be important for coke deposition on the catalysts.41 On these sites, the coke precursor undergoes polymerization/oligomerization, condensation, cyclization, and hydride transfer, resulting in the formation of hard coke.6,7Table 2 is a summary of data characterizing coke deposition, surface acidity, oxygen vacancies, and adsorption energies of coke precursors on the nanomaterials added to our catalysts. Al2O3, which provided the highest number of strong-acid sites, was characterized by the lowest coke deposition. Although TiO2 contained fewer strong-acid sites than Al2O3, it was characterized by the highest amount of coke deposition. We therefore conclude that coke deposition on the added nanomaterials was not directly related to the number of strong-acid sites.
Table 2 Summary of coke deposition, acidity, oxygen vacancies, and adsorption energy of the coke precursor over acidic nanomaterials
Nanomaterials Coke on nanomaterial (%) Acidity (μmol NH3 gcat−1) OV/OL Adsorption energy (J gcat−1)
Strong acid sites Total Propylene Propadiene
Al2O3 1.7 1283 3298 0.63 1.03 5.07
ZrO2 2.5 834 1149 0.69 1.27 5.33
TiO2 3.1 916 2191 1.23 1.46 6.50
Another property of the materials that is important for coke formation is the number of oxygen vacancy defect sites. Shukri et al.22 investigated the role of surface oxygen vacancies in molecular adsorption of ethylene on reduced anatase TiO2. Ethylene was found to preferably adsorb on the oxygen vacancy site, with the excess electrons originating from the removed oxygen weakening the CC double bond of ethylene. Park et al.23 proposed a technique that significantly decreases coke formation by capturing coke precursors in a palladium lattice. The palladium lattice on a carbon support was easily loosened, generating oxygen vacancies, and then coke precursors were incorporated. In our work, the adsorption energies of propylene and propadiene (coke precursor) were found to indicate bonding to the oxygen vacancy sites of our added nanomaterials. TiO2 with the highest number of oxygen vacancy sites showed the highest amount of adsorbed coke precursor and, consequently, a high degree of coke deposition was found on its surface.
Furthermore, oxygen vacancy sites were observed on the spent catalysts, as shown in Fig. 6 and Table 3. It was found that the number of oxygen vacancy sites decreased after the catalytic reaction. The percentage decreases in oxygen vacancies were in the following order: TiO2 > ZrO2 > Al2O3. This result is consistent with the coke formation results, indicating the amount of coke on the respective nanomaterials. Moreover, the peak assigned to a C–O band was increased on all nanomaterials, indicating the replacement of carbon on oxygen as also observed by Solanki et al.42
Fig. 6 O 1s peak in the XPS spectra of the spent nanomaterials.
Table 3 XPS results of the spent nanomaterials
Nanomaterials OV/OL (fresh) OV/OL (spent) % decrease of oxygen vacancies
Al2O3 0.63 0.61 3.2
ZrO2 0.69 0.47 31.9
TiO2 1.23 0.55 55.3
The data also provide evidence of coke precursor adsorption on the oxygen vacancies of the added nanomaterials. Eder et al.43 reported that the number of vacancies on zirconia increases with increasing treatment temperature, with increasing hydrogen flow rate, and with increasing treatment time. To test the mechanism, the nanomaterials were pretreated at different temperatures (500, 550, and 600 °C) to create various oxygen vacancy sites. Fig. S5† shows evidence of oxygen vacancy sites as indicated by XPS, with a summary shown in Table S9.† The data show that the number of oxygen vacancies on TiO2 increased with increasing temperature, whereas the numbers of oxygen vacancy sites on ZrO2 and Al2O3 were not influenced by changes in the temperature. From the H2-TPR data, we infer that TiO2 can be markedly reduced, and even almost fully reduced when the temperature reaches 550 and 600 °C, respectively. In contrast, ZrO2 was partially reduced at 550 and 600 °C, while no evidence of reduction of Al2O3 was found. Thus, it is reasonable why the oxygen vacancy sites of TiO2 were improved by the increasing temperature in the proved experiments. The nanomaterials with different oxygen vacancy sites mixed with the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst were used in propane dehydrogenation to observe the mechanism of coke formation. After propane dehydrogenation, the nanomaterial was separated from the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and the coke deposition on the nanomaterials was investigated as shown in Table S9.† Coke deposition on the nanomaterial, especially on TiO2, was directly proportional to the oxygen vacancy sites of the nanomaterial. A high number of oxygen vacancies led to a high degree of coke formation over the catalyst. However, the oxygen vacancy sites of ZrO2 were slightly improved with elevated temperature, so that coke deposition on ZrO2 was not significantly different. From these additional experiments, it is suggested that the oxygen vacancies of the nanomaterial were the sites for initial adsorption of the coke precursor. After that, the propagation of the coke precursor occurred on them to form high molecular weight coke like aliphatic and aromatic coke.
In summary, a model representing the influence of added nanomaterials for capturing the coke precursor from the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in propane dehydrogenation is shown in Scheme 1. First, the coke precursors generated on the Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst by deep dehydrogenation are captured by the oxygen vacancy sites of the nanomaterials. Subsequently, the coke precursors react to give high-molecular-weight species on the nanomaterials. Polymerization, oligomerization, and cyclization occur on the nanomaterials to form aliphatic and aromatic coke. This reaction network accounts for the observed improvement in the stability of Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 in propane dehydrogenation resulting from addition of the nanomaterials.

4. Conclusions
The present study shows that catalyst stability for propane dehydrogenation can be improved by adding materials that serve as coke reservoirs. The acidic nanomaterials investigated in this work were Al2O3, ZrO2, and TiO2. TPO results show that addition of these materials reduced the amount of coke deposition on Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3, enhancing the catalyst stability. Oxygen vacancy sites on the added nanomaterials play an important role in capturing coke precursors, as shown by XPS and DSC data. Coke precursors formed on Pt particles of the dehydrogenation catalyst were adsorbed on the oxygen vacancies of the nanomaterials and then deposited on the nanomaterials. TiO2 is the nanomaterial found in this work to have the highest number of oxygen vacancy sites, the greatest degree of adsorption of coke precursors, and consequently the highest degree of coke deposition. Moreover, the forms of coke were investigated by IR and UV-vis spectroscopy, with an in situ DRIFT investigation of propadiene adsorption. The data show that the aliphatic and aromatic coke on the catalyst decreased when the nanomaterial was added, and the results are correlated with the decreased amount of coke on the catalyst evidenced by TPO experiments. The aliphatic coke was transformed into aromatic coke on the added nanomaterials, and this transformation is related to the deep dehydrogenation reaction. The results presented here may indicate a promising path towards enhancing catalyst stability and for design of coke storage materials.
