The given document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation for converting propane to propylene. It focuses on using acidic nanomaterials (TiO2, ZrO2, Al2O3) as coke storage components to reduce deactivation of a Pt-Sn/Î³-Al2O3 catalyst in propane dehydrogenation. There is no mention of improvements to selectivity, conversion, or stability of the catalyst through enhancements in preparation method, composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
