NiO and CrOx interaction promoting in situ generation of the coordinatively unsaturated Cr–O acid–base for oxygen-lean propane dehydrogenation†
Highly dispersed Ni and Cr-doped MgAlxOy composite oxides (xNi20Cr–O) were prepared by calcining as-prepared MgAl hydrotalcite with cationic plate lattice-confined Ni and Cr. The xNi20Cr–O catalysts were used as the catalysts for O2-lean propane dehydrogenation (PDH), and the 10Ni20Cr–O catalyst exhibited 90% C3H6 selectivity at 34% C3H8 conversion after two induction periods. Operando Raman, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, etc. were conducted to investigate the valence evolution of Ni and Cr species under O2-lean PDH conditions. The surface Cr6+ species were reduced in the first induction period. In the second induction period, a mutation reduction phenomenon (the abrupt generation of CO and CO2) happened because of the interaction between NiO and CrOx species to increase lattice oxygen reducibility, such as the lattice oxygen of Cr–O–Ni. These promote lattice oxygen consumption and oxygen vacancy formation. Results of density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the coordinatively unsaturated Cr–O acid–base pairs close to oxygen vacancy as possible active sites exhibit higher PDH performance than stoichiometric Cr3+–O bonds. The small amount of molecular oxygen in the reactant gas not only inhibits the reduction of NiO species into metal Ni for hydrogenolysis, but can also in situ oxidize the over-reduced 10Ni20Cr–O catalyst, which exhibits excellent stability without deactivation within 20 h.
1. Introduction
Propene is an important raw material in the modern chemical industry. Demand for it is continuously increasing. The dehydrogenation of C3H8 from natural gas and shale gas to propene has great economic value, and high-temperature non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene has been commercialized.1 Supported CrOx- and Pt-based catalysts are applied industrially. Compared to a Pt-based catalyst, a CrOx-based catalyst has the advantages of low price and low requirements for raw material impurities.2 However, a CrOx-based catalyst is easy to deactivate and requires frequent regeneration. The main reason for deactivation is the polymerization and transformation of highly dispersed CrOx species and coke generation on the catalyst surface at high temperature.3,4
Therefore, the synthesis of thermally stable supports to anchor highly dispersed CrOx species with a high specific surface area is the key to designing an efficient PDH catalyst. Their inevitable deactivation because of coke is still a big challenge. In general, the oxidative PDH reaction generates almost no coke or the formed coke is combusted in situ.5 However, CrOx-based catalysts exhibited poor C3H6 selectivity and are typically used as catalysts for C3H8 combustion in an O2-rich atmosphere.6–8 Thus, appropriate process operations, such as co-feeding of a soft oxidant (CO2 or N2O) instead of active molecular oxygen,9–11 chemical looping,12,13 or a membrane reactor14–16 to avoid alkane and O2 contacting the catalyst simultaneously, are used to improve dehydrogenation activity and inhibit coke. However, they typically increase raw material costs, separation costs or investment in equipment.
Kondratenko et al.17,18 investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) on VOx/SiO2 under O2-lean conditions (C3H8/O2 > 10), which exhibited 80% propene selectivity at 50% propane conversion. On the one hand, the O2-lean operation not only takes advantage of high propene selectivity similar to non-oxidative PDH, but also provides heat from the exothermic ODP reaction to endothermic DH. Furthermore, the low concentration of gas-phase oxygen is safer and cheaper to operate than oxidative dehydrogenation with an O2-rich environment.19,20
Under O2-lean PDH operation, the real catalytic structure and performance of the CrOx species have barely been investigated. According to a previous reference,21 the fresh CrOx species generally undergo a reduction process under high-temperature DPH reaction conditions with or without a soft oxidant, including Cr6+ → Cr3+ → Cr2+ valence change and coordination number reduction. Typically leading to coordinatively unsaturated Cr–O active sites, they are suggested as key factors affecting dehydrogenation activity.22,23 Olefin hydrogenation is the reverse DH reaction and can occur at lower temperature. It is easy to control the degree of CrOx site reduction because its reduced structure is relatively stable. Indovina et al.24 controlled the reduction degree of CrZrOx catalysts through CO pretreatment at different temperatures. The catalytic activity abruptly increased by nearly two orders of magnitude when the reduction degree was further slightly increased. The surface mononuclear Cr3+ species with three coordinative vacancies are suggested as low-temperature-hydrogenation active sites. Hydrogenation reactivity is typically related to dehydrogenation reactivity.25,26 Thus, the decrease in Cr coordination number is also suggested as a main factor for PDH activity. However, no direct evidence has been found.
Furthermore, the modification of Ni,27,28 Sn,29 Ce,30 and Zr (ref. 31) on CrOx species typically enhances their PDH performance. These partially attribute to the enhanced reducibility of CrOx lattice oxygen because of the strong interaction between the promoters and CrOx species. However, CrOx species reduction with CrO, Cr–O–Cr, and Cr–O-support/promoter lattice oxygen consumption is dynamic. It is difficult to control the Cr coordination number to correlate dehydrogenation activity at high temperature. The different types of lattice oxygen consumption result in different coordinatively unsaturated metal–O Lewis acid–base pairs and their contributions to DPH are still ambiguous.
Here, taking advantage of the lattice confinement effect of a hydrotalcite cationic plate layer, we prepared Ni and Cr-doped MgAl hydrotalcite with lamellar morphology, then topologically transformed it into highly dispersed Ni and Cr-doped MgAlxOy composite oxides (xNi20Cr–O) through high-temperature roasting. The xNi20Cr–O with different Ni doping amounts were used as catalysts for O2-lean PDH. In situ/operando Raman, ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), etc. characterizations were used to investigate the valence evolutions of Ni and Cr species. On this basis, the relationship between lattice oxygen consumption and PDH active site formation can be inferred from the evolution of product distribution with reaction time, especially for mutation reduction with the formation of a large amount of CO and CO2. NiO and CrOx interactions regulate the reducibility of the lattice oxygen, such as Cr–O–Ni lattice oxygen. These promote lattice oxygen consumption and oxygen vacancy formation under O2-lean PDH conditions. According to the results of DFT calculations, in situ formed coordinatively unsaturated Cr–O acid–base pairs close to oxygen vacancy are suggested as active sites with higher PDH performance than stoichiometric Cr3+–O bonds.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A series of MgAl, Ni–MgAl, Cr–MgAl and NiCr–MgAl LDHs were prepared by the coprecipitation method, and these LDHs were topologically transformed into the corresponding composite oxide catalysts via high-temperature calcination. The typical Ni and Cr co-doped MgAlOx catalysts were synthesized by the following steps: firstly, solution A was prepared by dissolving a certain amount of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, 1.5 g of Al(NO3)3·9H2O and 0.4 g of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O in 15 mL of deionized water. The MII/MIII molar ratio was kept constant at 4 for all samples. Secondly, solution B was prepared by dissolving 0.7 g of Na2CO3 and 1.1 g of NaOH in 60 mL of deionized water. Thirdly, solution A was added slowly to solution B under vigorous stirring at 60 °C and kept under stirring for 24 h. Afterwards, the deposited products were thoroughly washed with deionized water in order to eliminate excess ions, and dried at 80 °C for 12 h. The obtained NiCr–MgAl LDHs are denoted xNi20Cr–L (x is the molar ratio of Ni/(Ni + Mg) × 100, x = 5, 10, and 20). These samples were calcined in a muffle furnace at 600 °C for 6 hours to obtain the corresponding composite metal oxides, which were denoted xNi20Cr–O (x = 5, 10, and 20). For comparation, the MgAl, Ni–MgAl, Cr–MgAl LDHs samples were prepared by similar methods but with no Ni or Cr precursor addition, which were donated MgAl–L, 10Ni–L, and 20Cr–L, respectively. After calcination at 600 °C, their corresponding composite oxides were denoted MgAl–O, 10Ni–O, 20Cr–O catalysts, respectively.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on an RIGAKU Ultima IV power diffraction system with CuKα radiation in the 2θ range of 5 to 90°. Specific surface areas, pore volumes (Vp), and pore diameters (Dp) of the catalysts were measured by N2 adsorption–desorption at liquid nitrogen temperature with a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 and were analyzed by the BJH (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda) method. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and element mapping images of the 10Ni20Cr–O catalyst were taken on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 electron microscope. Raman spectra were undertaken on a LabRAM HR Evolution Raman spectrometer (HORIBA) with 532 nm laser excitation. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) measurements of the samples were carried out on a Micromeritics Auto Chem II 2920. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were recorded on a US Thermo Scientific ESCALAB250Xi spectrometer using Al Kα (hv = 1486.6 eV, 15 kV, 150 W) X-ray source. The binding energies were calibrated using the C 1s peak of contaminant carbon (BE = 284.6 eV) as an internal standard. Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV-vis DRS) measurements were conducted on a Hitachi UH4150 spectrophotometer equipped with accessory integration sphere diffuse reflectance. The powder samples were loaded in a transparent quartz cell after drying and measured in the range of 200–800 nm. Barium sulfate acted as a reference in the tests.
In this work, all density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the Vienna ab initial Simulation Package (VASP).32,33 The PAW pseudopotential was used to describe the core–valence electron interactions.34 The generalized gradient approximation parameterized by Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (GGA–PBE) was adopted to describe the exchange and correlation energy.35 Considering long-range van der Waals (vdW) interactions, we adopted the DFT-D3 method with Becke–Johnson damping.36,37A plane-wave basis set with an energy cutoff of 500 eV was used in this work. We built a periodic slab with four layers for the MgAl2O4 (100) facet. The vacuum gap thickness was set to 20 Å to avoid interactions between periodic images. A Monkhorst–Pack 4 × 4× 1 k-point mesh was used for Brillouin zone integration.38
During structural optimization, the convergence criteria for energy calculation and structural optimization were set to 1.0 × 10−5 eV and a force tolerance of 0.02 eV Å−1, respectively. The climbing-image nudge elastic band (CI-NEB) method was used to locate transition states (TS), and the minimum energy pathways (MEPs) were constructed accordingly. The minima possess all real frequencies, and the transition states have only one imaginary frequency based on vibrational analysis. Adsorption energy was calculated using the following expression:
Ead = Etot − Eslab − Ex
where Etot is the total energy of the combined system with the adsorbate X bound to the slab, Eslab is the energy of the slab alone, and Ex is the energy of the adsorbate in the gas phase. According to this definition, exothermic adsorption results in a negative value of Ead.
2.3. Catalytic performance measurements
The catalytic tests were conducted in a fixed-bed quartz reactor at atmospheric pressure. Typically, the powdered catalyst was crushed and sieved to a particle size of 60–80 mesh. 0.2 g of catalyst particles were used and pretreated under O2 gas flow at 550 °C for 30 min. After 5 min of N2 purging, a total flow of 10 ml min−1 reactant gas (C3H8/O2/N2 = 5 : 0.5 : 94.5) was passed through the catalyst bed. The reactants and products were analyzed by on-line gas chromatographs equipped with two flame ionization detectors (FID). An HP-PLOT/Q capillary chromatographic column (30 m) was used for the separation of C3H6, C3H8, C2H4, C2H6, CH4 and some possible oxygenates. CO and CO2 were separated by a 3 m Porapak Q column, then hydrogenated through an Ni catalyst at 380 °C and detected by FID. The propane conversion (CC3H8), selectivity of products (Si), and yield of products (Yi) were determined from eqn (1)–(3), respectively.
CC3H8(%) = 100 × ([FC3H8]in − [FC3H8]out)/[FC3H8]in (1)
Si(%) = (100 × ni[Fi]out)/(3[FC3H8]in − 3[FC3H8]out) (2)
Yi(%) = CC3H8 × Si/100 (3)
where i represents the products in the effluent gas, ni is the number of carbon atoms of component i, and Fi (ml min−1) is the corresponding flow rate.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
As shown in Fig. 1a, only the (003), (006), (012), (015), (018), (110), (113) characteristic plane diffraction peaks of LDHs can be observed in the MgAl–L, 10Ni–L, 20Cr–L, and three xNi20Cr–L samples (Mg6Al2CO3(OH)16·4H2O, JCPDS 014-0191). Cr doping and Ni–Cr-co-doping significantly decrease the intensity of LDH diffraction peaks, suggesting that the Cr and Ni doping inhibits LDH crystal growth.39 The (003) and (006) peaks of MgAl-LDH shifted to a higher 2θ angle after Ni doping (Fig. S1†), as a result of changes in the lattice parameters. No other crystalline phase XRD peaks were detected, suggesting that Ni and Cr are incorporated into the cation layer lattice, are highly dispersed on the surface, have a low particle size or are in a highly amorphous phase. XRD patterns of the calcinated MgAl–O, 10Ni–O, 20Cr–O and xNi20Cr–O catalysts with different Ni contents are shown in Fig. 1b. Their LDH diffraction peaks disappear and new characteristic peaks at 2θ ≈ 36°, 43°, 63°, and 79° are observed, which correspond to the MgO (111), (200), (220), and (222) crystal planes.40,41 This is consistent with the 10Ni20Cr–O (200) interplane distance of 0.21 nm (Fig. 2a).42 Ni and Cr co-doping significantly weakens the MgO diffraction peak intensity, but no NiO and CrOx crystal XRD peaks are detected, suggesting that Ni and Cr are incorporated into the lattice of MgAlxOy composed oxides and/or highly dispersed on the surface. The elemental distribution of a representative 10Ni20Cr–O catalyst further indicates that the Cr and Ni species are uniformly and highly dispersed (Fig. 2b–f). Thus, the lattice confinement effect of the LDH cation layer can retain a high dispersion of Ni and Cr after topological transformation at high temperature.

The physical parameters of the synthesized MgAl–O, 10Ni–O, 20Cr–O and xNi20Cr–O catalysts were determined by the N2 adsorption–desorption method (Fig. S2 and Table S1†). All the catalysts exhibit a type-IV absorption/desorption isotherm and type H1 hysteresis loop, which belong to a mesoporous morphology stacked by a lamellar catalyst with uniform size (Fig. S3†). The Ni or Cr doping, especially NiCr co-doping, lead to the hysteresis loop shifting to relatively lower pressure zones along with the decreasing in Vp and Dp, suggesting that LDH lamellar morphology growth is inhibited by doping with heteroatoms. Thus, smaller sized lamellar catalysts with a higher SBET are generated after calcination, which stack to form mesopores with lower Vp and Dp.
UV-vis DRS characterization provides more information about the coordination and valance of chromium species in 10Ni–O, 20Cr–O, and xNi20Cr–O catalysts, as shown in Fig. 3. For the 20Cr–O catalyst without Ni species, the adsorption bands centered at around 273 and 374 nm can be assigned to the O2− → Cr6+ charge transfer transition of the isolated CrOx species with tetrahedral symmetry. The bands at around 448 nm and 600 nm are assigned to the A2g → T1g and A2g → T2g d–d transitions of Cr3+ with octahedral coordination in dichromate, polychromate, or bulk of Cr2O3.29,43–46 The peak at 483 nm can be attributed to the dichromate or polymeric Cr6+ species anchored to the support surface. It is symmetry forbidden in Td coordination and its detectability depends upon the distortion of the Cr(vi) group from a tetrahedral symmetry.47,48

For the 10Ni–O catalyst without Cr species, almost no absorbance in the 250–350 nm region, which is assigned to O2− → Ni2+ charge-transfer in octahedral symmetry in an NiO lattice. Only a strong absorption centered at 245 nm were observed, indicating the good dispersion of nickel oxide and strong interaction with the MgAlxOy support.49–51 The broad bands at ∼400 and 650 nm are related to the octahedral and tetrahedral Ni2+ species in the NiAl2O4-like surface spinel lattice, respectively.49,52 For the xNi20Cr–O catalysts with both Cr and Ni species, two bands with maxima at 260 and 380 nm are attributed to the overlap of adjacent absorption peaks of Ni species and Cr species. Therefore, the highly dispersed NiOx and CrOx species are supported on the surface NiCr–O catalysts and doping into the MgAl–O oxide lattice to form a new spinel phase. Furthermore, the peak intensities of the xNi20Cr–O catalysts at 600 nm are lower than that of the 20Cr–O catalyst, indicating that introduction of Ni contributes to the dispersion of CrOx species.
The Raman spectra of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 4. The 20Cr–O and xNi20Cr–O catalysts possess a Raman band at ∼845 cm−1, which is assigned to the symmetric stretching mode of isolated tetrahedral surface–chromate species.53 This Raman peak intensity increases after Ni doping, and it shifts to 856 cm−1 with the introduction of more Ni, perhaps because of its distortion by interaction with Ni species.54 The peaks at 882, 936 and 991 cm−1 are assigned to the surface oligomeric chromate species (Cr2O72−, Cr3O102−, Cr4O132−).29,54,55 The peak at 605 cm−1 indicates the presence of polymeric Cr6+ species.29,56 A new band appearing at 556 cm−1 for the 5Ni20Cr–O and 10Ni20Cr–O catalysts can be commonly assigned to crystalline α-Cr2O3.53 The peak at 1066 cm−1 is due to the sample containing the residual anion CO3.2–57 Thus, the Ni doping leads to the formation of more isolated CrOx species, along with a small number of polymeric or crystalline CrOx species on the surface. No NiO Raman peaks are observed, indicating the high dispersion of Ni species.58

The reducibility of the catalysts was characterized by H2-TPR, as shown in Fig. 5. Asymmetric peaks in the range of 250–450 °C are typically ascribed to the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+.27 According to the “hard Cr(vi)” and “soft Cr(vi)” sites concept proposed by Baek et al.,47 the two peaks at ∼350 and 427 °C are assumed to be polymeric Cr6+ oxide and isolated Cr6+ oxide, respectively, which is consistent with the Raman characterization results, especially for the 20Ni20Cr–O catalyst with more polymeric Cr6+ species. The isolated Cr6+ reduction peak shifts to low temperature (from 427 to 401 °C) with Ni doping, suggesting that the formed Ni–O–Cr bonds substitute Mg–O–Cr/Al–O–Cr bonds, and enhance the Cr6+ species reducibility. This is consistent with the previous results that appropriate amounts of Ni,27 Ce,30 and Sn (ref. 29) modification enhanced CrOx reducibility. The reduction peak of the 10Ni–O catalyst at 583 °C is attributed to reduction of the highly dispersed surface NiO species. This reduction peak also shifts to low temperature with Ni doping. More Ni doping enhances the interaction between NiO and CrOx species, which generates more Ni–O–Cr bonds. Thus, the weak reduction peaks of xNi20Cr–O catalysts at around 500 °C can be attributed to Ni–O–Cr lattice oxygen reduction. Except for the 20Cr–O catalyst, the other Ni-containing catalysts all exhibit a high-temperature peak above 600 °C, which can be assigned to the reduction of NiAl2O4 spinel.52,59

3.2. The evolution of the catalysts' surface structure and catalytic performance under oxygen-lean PD reaction conditions
According to the above characterization results, xNi20Cr–O catalysts with different amounts of Ni doping were synthesized to form highly dispersed NiO and CrOx species. The interaction between NiO and CrOx forms abundant Ni–O–Cr bonds and significantly affects the redox property of NiO and CrOx species on xNi20Cr–O catalysts. To investigate the evolution of the catalysts' surface structure and catalytic performance under oxygen-lean PDH reaction conditions, a low concentration of C3H8/N2 (5 vol%) gas with 5000 ppm O2 at 550 °C was used to prolong the initial induction period of the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 6 and Table S2,† the COx yields of all the catalysts were significantly higher in the early stage (5–80 min) than in the later stage (305 min), suggesting that the oxygen of COx not only comes from O2 gas, but also from catalyst surface active oxygen species, such as chemisorbed oxygen species and lattice oxygen.22,23,60–62 Thus, under these oxygen-lean PDH reaction conditions, the NiO and CrOx species should be partially reduced.
Fig. 6 The C3H8 conversion (a) and C3H6 selectivity (b) of the 10Ni–O, 20Cr–O and xNi20Cr–O catalysts versus time on stream. The CO, CO2, CH4, and C3H6 selectivity of 10Ni20Cr–O (c) and 20Ni20Cr–O (d) catalysts versus time on stream.
For the 10Ni–O catalyst, its C3H8 conversion decreases from 30.5% to 3.3% and its COx yield decreases from 17.2% to 0.2% after a 155 min induction period; then its catalytic performance is stable and similar to the empty tube reaction performance, especially for C3H6 selectivity. This demonstrates that the highly dispersed NiO species of the 10Ni–O catalyst are not PDH active sites under oxygen-lean conditions.
The induction period (0–35 min) of the 20Cr–O and 5Ni20Cr–O catalysts are relatively short. After the induction period, their C3H6 selectivities are around 90%. However, the C3H8 conversion of the 5Ni20Cr–O catalyst is more than twice that of the 20Cr–O catalyst, indicating that Ni doping leads to the formation of more PDH active sites. As shown in Fig. 6c, with the induction period increasing from 0 to 50 min, the CO2 selectivity of the 10Ni20Cr–O catalyst decreases from 44% to 3%, while C3H6 selectivity increases from 43% to 89%. According to the operando Raman characterization (Fig. 7), the Raman bands of Cr6+ species with CrO bonds disappear below 550 °C under 5% H2 or oxygen-lean PDH conditions. This is consistent with the reduction of Cr6+ species in H2-TPR characterization. During this reduction process, the 10Ni20Cr–O catalyst exhibits two sharp Raman peaks at 866 and 891 cm−1 between 250 and 450 °C, which can be assigned to symmetric and anti-symmetric Cr–OH stretching.63–65 These demonstrate that the CrOx reduction goes through an intermediate process of hydroxylation. Thus, during this induction period, Cr6+ species are reduced to Cr3+ species with low coordination which are the possible PDH active sites with 89% C3H6 selectivity.
Fig. 7 In situ/operando Raman spectra of the 10Ni20Cr–O catalyst at 150–550 °C under 5% H2 reduction (a), 5% O2 oxidation (b), and oxygen-lean PDH reaction conditions (c), respectively.
Notably, the temperature of the Cr–OH Raman peaks occuring under oxygen-lean PDH reaction conditions is lower than that under the H2 atmosphere. This demonstrates that C3H8 exhibits stronger reducibility than H2, and C3H8 even coexists with a low concentration of O2. As shown in Fig. 7b, the H2-reduced 10Ni20Cr–O catalyst is re-oxidized and the Cr–OH species also emerges at 350 °C, suggesting that the reduced surface bonded some H species, which react with O2 to form OH groups. This demonstrates that the reduced 10Ni20Cr–O catalyst can be the hydrogen transfer platform for the DPH reaction.
Interestingly, for the 10Ni20Cr–O catalyst at 80 min reaction time, the CO selectivity suddenly increases to 85% while the C3H6 selectivity decreases to 11%. 5000 ppm of O2 are not enough to oxidize C3H8 to generate COx with 11.2% yield. Thus, the lattice oxygen of the 10Ni20Cr–O catalyst is abruptly consumed by propane and its derivatives to form COx. This phenomenon is denoted as a mutation reduction. After this mutation reduction, the C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity increase to 34% and 90%, respectively. These results indicate that mutation reduction leads to the formation of more PDH active sites.
To further investigate the evolution of Cr and Ni valence during mutation reduction, XPS characterizations of the fresh, reduced, and spent 10Ni20Cr–O catalysts were conducted (Fig. 8). The Ni 2p3/2 peaks at 855.5 and 861.5 eV and the Ni 2p1/2 peaks at 873 and 879 eV are assigned to Ni2+ species. A metallic nickel peak presented at a binding energy of 852.6 eV.66,67 The fresh and spent 10Ni20Cr–O catalysts had only Ni2+ (no Ni0), suggesting that its surface Ni species maintain a +2 valence state under oxygen-lean PDH reaction conditions. Two Cr2p3/2 spectra peaks at ∼576.7 eV and at ∼579.3 eV can be assigned to Cr3+ and Cr6+ species, respectively.23 After an oxygen-lean PDH reaction, the Cr6+ species on the fresh 10Ni20Cr–O catalyst transform into Cr3+ species without the generation of Cr2+ species. These results are consistent with the UV-vis spectrum characterization results for the 10Ni20Cr–O catalyst (Fig. 9).

Fig. 9 UV-vis spectra of the fresh, reduced, and spent 10Ni–O and 10Ni20Cr–O catalysts.
Therefore, the mutation reduction process exhibits no valence change for Ni2+ and Cr3+, but proceeds through lattice oxygen consumption. According to the H2-TPR results, we suggest that the lattice oxygen of the highly dispersed CrOx and NiO species with strong interaction, such as Ni–O–Cr lattice oxygen, is consumed to form unsaturated Cr–O Lewis acid–base pairs for PDH.
For the 20Ni20Cr–O catalyst with more Ni doping, the evolution of catalytic active sites and performance is also divided into three periods (Fig. 6d). Although, in the second period, C3H8 conversion increased to 80%, the CH4 selectivity increased to 91%, and C3H6 selectivity decreased to 0% after a large amount of CO formation. According to previous reports,68 Ni-based catalysts with metallic Ni exhibit an extremely high hydrogenolysis activity for light alkanes. As shown in Fig. 8a, the Ni2+ species can be reduced into metallic Ni0. Thus, partial NiO species on the 20Ni20Cr–O catalyst are reduced into Ni metal for C3H8 hydrogenolysis to form CH4. In the third period, C3H8 conversion and CH4 selectivity decrease slowly, along with an increase in CO selectivity, indicating the Ni0 are slowly re-oxidized by the oxygen molecule. However, the C3H6 selectivity is still 0%, indicating that no coordinatively unsaturated PDH active sites (oxygen vacancies) are formed. We suggest that the surface NiOx species from the slow re-oxidation of Ni0 metal nanoparticles are active for O2 dissociation. The generated O species rapidly occupy the oxygen vacancies, inhibiting the consumption of Ni–O–Cr lattice oxygen to form oxygen vacancies (PDH active sites). Thus, almost no C3H6 was detected.
To further investigate the above assumed structure–activity relationship, the 10Ni20Cr–O catalyst was pre-reduced and tested under oxygen-lean PDH reaction conditions (Fig. 10). The initial C3H8 conversion and CH4 selectivity were ∼100% and 90%, respectively, indicating the presence of Ni metal for efficient C3H8 hydrogenolysis after the pre-reduction. This is demonstrated by the result of XPS characterization (Fig. 8a). With time on stream, C3H8 conversion and CH4 selectivity decreased rapidly and significantly, indicating that the oxygen gas quickly re-oxidized the Ni metal. CO selectivity first increased, and then decreased with reaction time, reaching a maximum (70%) at around 160 min. This process is similar to mutation reduction, as shown in Fig. 6c. After this mutation reduction, the 10Ni20Cr–O catalyst exhibited extremely stable PDH activation and no deactivation within 20 h.

In order to investigate the effects of NiOx–CrOx interaction and oxygen vacancies on activity at the atomic level, DFT calculations were carried out. Three possible structures were built to investigate the dehydrogenation of propane on the catalyst surface: the MgAl2O4 (100) surface, Cr and Ni doped MgAl2O4 (Cr and Ni replace Al and Mg atoms, respectively, in the outermost layer of MgAl2O4 (100)), as well as Cr and Ni doped MgAl2O4 with oxygen vacancies from the elimination of Ni–O–Cr lattice oxygen, which are denoted MgAl2O4 (100), MgAl2O4–CrNi (100), and MgAl2O4–CrNi–OV (100), respectively. Due to the stability of the low-index crystal plane and the possibility that rich metal atoms can be exposed on the (100) surface, we studied the reaction mechanism on the (100) surface. The side view and top view of these structures can be seen in Fig. 11. There are five-coordinated Cr cations and four-coordinated Ni cations on MgAl2O4–CrNi (100) as well as four-coordinated Cr cations and three-coordinated Ni cations on the MgAl2O4–CrNi–OV (100) surface.

Propane adsorbs on the surface via a horizontal configuration with weak physical adsorption. The first hydrogen atom of propane cracking is typically the rate controlling step of the whole reaction.69,70 Simply, we explored the first step of propane dehydrogenation on these three catalysts. As shown in Fig. 12, propane breaking the first hydrogen atom requires a rather high energy barrier of 1.52 eV on the MgAl2O4 (100) surface. However, when Cr and Ni atoms are doped, the Ni atom regulates the electronic structure of Cr–O Lewis acid–base pairs, resulting in the first C–H activation energy barrier decreasing to 1.08 eV and improving the activity. When the catalyst generates oxygen vacancies and nearby coordinatively unsaturated Cr–O Lewis acid–base pairs, the dehydrogenation energy barrier is further reduced to 0.95 eV. Our calculation results showed that doping Cr and Ni atoms in spinel and the existence of oxygen vacancies improve the activity of the catalyst.

On the basis of the above, we tested 10Ni20Cr–O catalysts using an industrial feed with relevant 40 vol% C3H8 in N2 (no oxygen addition). After a 1 h induction period, CH4 selectivity is ∼30% (Fig. S4†), suggesting that the surface NiOx species are reduced to Ni0 species for the hydrogenolysis reaction. As shown in Fig. S5a,† a metallic nickel peak is observed at a binding energy of 852.6 eV for this spent 10Ni20Cr–O catalyst, further demonstrating that the NiO is reduced. However, the 0.5% O2 cofeed significantly inhibits methane formation (only 6% CH4 selectivity). Under such oxygen-lean PDH conditions (C3H8/O2/N2 = 40 : 0.5 : 59.5) similar to an industrial feed, the space–time yields of propene formation (STY(C3H6)) of the 10Ni20Cr–O catalyst are 0.25 and 0.6 kg(C3H6) h−1 kg(cat)−1 at 550 and 600 °C, respectively. Compared with some state-of-the-art catalysts, such as Pt,71,72 Cr,23,31,46,73 Zn (ref. 74) and Zr-based70 catalysts in Table S3,† its STY(C3H6) has no significant advantage. However, its deactivation rate constants (kd = 0.11 and 0.22) are lower than those of most state-of-the-art catalysts under industrial PDH reaction conditions (40 vol% C3H8 in N2), indicating its high stability.
In summary, the catalytic performance of xNi20Cr–O (x = 0–20) catalysts after 300 min of reaction time (the mutation reduction period) and the possible structures of their active sites are shown in Fig. 13. The interaction between NiO and CrOx species increases their lattice oxygen reducibility, such as lattice oxygen of Cr–O–Ni. The Cr–O–Ni lattice oxygen is consumed by C3H8 and its derivatives along with oxygen vacancy formation. Coordinatively unsaturated Cr–O acid–base pairs close to an oxygen vacancy as possible active sites exhibit higher PDH performance than stoichiometric Cr3+–O bonds. For the xNi20Cr–O catalysts, the small amount of molecular oxygen in the reactant gas not only inhibits the reduction of NiO species into metal Ni for hydrogenolysis, but can also in situ oxidize the over-reduced NiOx or CrOx species, exhibiting excellent stability without deactivation within 20 h. However, the surface NiOx and Ni0 metal nanoparticles on the 20Ni20Cr–O catalyst are more active for O2 dissociation than Ni–O–Cr lattice oxygen consumption to form oxygen vacancies (PDH active sites). The generated O species rapidly occupy the oxygen vacancies. Thus, almost no C3H6 is generated.

Conclusions
Taking advantage of the lattice confinement effect of the hydrotalcite cationic plate layer, we prepared Ni and Cr-doped MgAl hydrotalcite with lamellar morphology, and then topologically transformed it into highly dispersed Ni and Cr-doped MgAlxOy composite oxides (xNi20Cr–O) through high-temperature roasting. The xNi20Cr–O catalysts with different Ni doping amounts were used as catalysts for oxygen-lean PDH. Two induction periods were found. One is Cr6+ reduction to Cr3+. The other is mutation reduction with the formation of a large amount of COx by the consumption of lattice oxygen because of the interaction between the CrOx and NiO species. After the two induction periods, the 10Ni20Cr–O catalyst exhibited 90% C3H6 selectivity at 34% C3H8 conversion. According to the results of DFT calculations, the first C–H activation energy barrier on the coordinatively unsaturated Cr–O acid–base pairs close to an oxygen vacancy is lower than that on stoichiometric Cr3+–O bonds. The small amount of molecular oxygen in the reactant gas not only inhibits the reduction of NiO into metal Ni for hydrogenolysis, but can also in situ oxidize the reduced 10Ni20Cr–O catalysts, which exhibited excellent stability without deactivation within 20 h. Excessive Ni doping leads to in situ reduction of metallic Ni and partial re-oxidization into nano nickel oxide particles by the small amount of molecular O2, resulting in hydrogenolysis and an excessive oxidation reaction to form CH4 and CO.
