The document discusses propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene, but does not focus on a specific catalyst's performance enhancements. It mainly describes the structure-activity relationship between NiO-CrOx interaction and oxygen vacancy formation in Ni-Cr-MgAlxOy composite oxide catalysts under oxygen-lean PDH conditions. No specific catalyst represents the main scientific contribution for performance improvements.
