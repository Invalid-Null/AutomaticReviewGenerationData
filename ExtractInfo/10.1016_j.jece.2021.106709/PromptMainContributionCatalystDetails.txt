Role of brush-like additives in CO2 adsorbents for the enhancement of amine efficiency
Amine adsorbents have been widely investigated for direct CO2 capture from air. However, the low amine efficiency of the widely-studied amine sorbents is the critical factor to hinder the practical application under dry conditions. Herein, we developed the brush-like cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) templating strategy to prepare micro-mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MMSN-X) and TEPA-functionalized adsorbents (MMSN-X/TEPA-Y). The character of samples was investigated by transmission electron microscopy, N2 adsorption-desorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analyzer and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The adsorbent (MMSN-30/TEPA-50) with appropriate amount of brush-like CTAC exhibited higher CO2 adsorption capacities (3.68 mmol/gadsorbent under simulated dry air conditions) than that of the adsorbents with none or less additives. The kinetic and thermodynamic model were applied to investigate the adsorption rate control factors and adsorption behavior of CO2 adsorbents with brush-like CTAC. Moreover, with the effect of brush-like CTAC, the significant variation of adsorption product (conversion from carbamate (CO2/N = 0.5) to carbamic acid (CO2/N = 1)) was detected by in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. These results demonstrated that the combination of CO2 and amine was altered in the presence of brush-like CTAC and thereby the amine efficiency was enhanced, which could be expected to be an efficient adsorbent for CO2 from air in practical applications.
1. Introduction
Since the industrial age, the CO2 level of the atmosphere has increased from 0.0280 to 0.0410 vol%, increasing about 46.4% [1], [2], [3]. Its recognized influence on climate change has facilitated widespread investigation to develop effective pathways in inhibiting CO2 emissions from the thermal power plants and other point sources [4]. Amine modified sorbents in the form of liquid amines, amine-based ionic liquids, immobilized amines, natural polymers have been widely used for CO2 capture [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].
The use of immobilized amines for adsorbents (solid amine adsorbents) is a promising alternative for CO2 capture owing to easy operation, low energy consumption, excellent capture efficiency, and low capital cost [10], [11]. Specifically, the CO2 capture on the solid amine adsorbents could be realized via acid-base interaction to generate neutral or charged CO2 adducts in CO2 adsorption process [12]. Recently, many investigators have found that carbamic acid species in the reaction of CO2 with amine-modified porous adsorbents could be detected by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) or solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy [12], [13], [14], [15]. Furthermore, carbamic acid was stabilized through the formation of dimers or hydrogen bonding with neighboring amine groups, which has been supported by computational chemistry method [16], [17], [18].
Theoretically, 1 mol of CO2 reacts with 2 moles of the amine to form carbamate, while 1 mol of CO2 could combine with 1 mol of amine to form carbamic acid under the same conditions. Hence, strenuous efforts have been investigated to enhance the ratio of CO2 to N atoms for addressing the deficiency of amine efficiency [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. The common strategy incorporates surfactants, polymers, or other additives rich in hydrogen bonding into amine impregnated porous materials. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was added into PEI solution to prepare adsorbents, and CO2 adsorption capacity was improved at flue gas conditions [20]. Zhu et al. developed another novel strategy to introduce tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) directly into as-prepared SBA-15 loaded with poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) (Pluronic P123). The TEPA functionalized SBA-15 that containing template Pluronic P123 displayed higher amine utilization than that of the calcined support without Pluronic P123 [21]. These strategies showed excellent prospects for solid amine adsorbent to solve the issue of low amine efficiency. However, few in-depth studies that probed how to realize the variation of adsorption product (conversion from carbamate (CO2/N = 0.5) to carbamic acid (CO2/N = 1)) was major bottlenecks for the development of high-performance materials for application in CO2 capture.
Inspired by the above mechanisms of the CO2-amine reaction, a successful strategy could promote a change in the combined formation between CO2 and amine groups from carbamate to carbamic acid to improve amine efficiency. In this paper, to study the role of brush-like cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) on the CO2 adsorption performance, a series of micro-mesoporous silica nanoparticles supports (MMSN-X) were produced by adding different amounts of brush-like CTAC, and adsorbents were synthesized by impregnating amine into supports. We further analyzed the properties of as-synthesized samples through spectroscopy and microcalorimetry. Moreover, the influence of CTAC on the adsorption kinetics was considered, and the adsorption curves were fitted by three kinetics models on different adsorbents to investigate the adsorption behavior. Eventually, the changes of functional groups on the adsorbent surface during CO2 adsorption were monitored by in situ FTIR to verify the feasibility of CTAC to enhance amine efficiency.
2. Experimental section
2.1. . Materials and preparation
Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 98%), tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA, 99%), ethanol (99.7%), methanol (99.5%) was obtained from Aladdin. Cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC, 98%), triethanolamine (TEA, 99%) and sodium chloride (NaCl) were purchased from China Pharmaceutical Group Chemical Reagents Co., Ltd. as received without further purification.
2.2. Synthesis of supports
Micro-mesoporous silica nanoparticles as supports were synthesized using CTAC as the structure-directing template and TEOS as the silica source (Fig. 1a). For the support named MMSN-30 that containing 30 wt% CTAC, the experiment steps were as follows. CTAC (1.92 g) and TEA (0.45 g) were dissolved in 20 mL deionized H2O and the mixture was refluxed at 95 °C under intensive stirring for 1 h. Then, 1.50 g of TEOS was added into the mixed solution and the mixture was stirred for another 3 h. The product (MMSN-30) was collected by centrifugation and washed 3 times with ethanol to remove the residual reactants, and was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 3 h. Afterwards, MMSN-30 was washed with 1 wt% solution of NaCl in methanol at room temperature for 3(6) h, and the product with 20(10) % CTAC was named as MMSN-20(MMSN-10). The products were collected by centrifugation and washed 3 times with ethanol to remove the residual reactants, and were dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 3 h. The obtained supports were named as MMSN-X, where X (30, 20, 10) represented the weight percentage of CTAC in support. Finally, the sample was labeled as MMSN after calcination at 400 °C for 10 h to remove the template CTAC.

2.3. . Synthesis of the adsorbents
MMSN-X materials were modified through the physical impregnation method (Fig. 1b). In this work, a suitable amount of TEPA was added into 60 mL ethanol solvent, and the solution was dissolved at 25 °C for half an hour. After that, a required amount of the support (TEPA/support weight ratio from 0.25 to 3) was added under the conditions of stirring at 40 °C until the solvent evaporated. Finally, the sample was dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. The obtained samples were referred to as MMSN-X/TEPA-Y, where Y represented the weight percentage of TEPA in adsorbent.
2.4. Adsorbents characterization
All samples were dried at 100 °C for 1 h before characterization. The morphology and micro-mesoporous structure of the samples were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100 F), small angle X-ray diffraction (SAXD), N2 adsorption-desorption (BEL sorp II), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, Nicolet iS50 IR spectrometer), Thermal gravimetric analyzer (TGA, Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC 3+) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer). In situ FTIR experiments were tested on a Nicolet iS50 IR spectrometer. Before recording the FTIR spectra, the pretreatment of the sample was performed in pure N2 at 100 °C for about 60 min. Then, the spectrum of the sample as the base line was deducted. Finally, the temperature was set up at designated adsorption temperature and 20 mL/min of CO2 was introduced into the sample pool. The detailed measurement procedures were presented in Supporting Methods.
2.5. CO2 adsorption measurements
The CO2 capture performance was measured by the TGA device (Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC 3+). A certain quantity of solid amine adsorbent was put into an alumina pan. To remove moisture and CO2 from adsorbents, the samples were heated to 100 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min and kept for half an hour under pure N2 flow (50 mL/min). Then, the temperature was decreased to the desired temperature and switched 100 vol% CO2 (1 atm at 25, 50, 75 °C) or mixed gas (15 vol% at 75 °C or 0.0400 vol% CO2 at 25 °C in N2, 1 atm) flow (50 mL/min).
Amine efficiency (mmol CO2/mmol N) was calculated according to CO2 adsorption amount (qCO2 (mmol CO2/g)) and N contents (qN (mmol N/g)) per gram of adsorbent, N contents were obtained from TGA analysis.

2.6. Kinetic and mechanism analysis
Three models were adopted to describe kinetic process in the CO2 adsorption for an explicit understanding to its adsorptive behaviour.
Kinetic data of CO2 adsorption were obtained from adsorption curves acquired by thermogravimetric comments with pseudo-first, pseudo-second, and fractional-order kinetic models. We also tested the CO2 adsorption capacity with different flow rates of identical compositions, and the results showed that the effect of external mass transfer resistance was ignorable [25], [26], [27].

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Supports analysis
To investigate the role of brush-like additive CTAC on CO2 adsorption process, the preparation process should ensure that the structure of the support was not destroyed first. A similar morphology and same particle size (≈30 nm) of MMSN-X (X = 0, 10, 20, 30) could be observed in TEM images (Fig. 2a and , Appendix A Supplementary material). In addition, SAXD of these samples (Fig. S2) showed that the intensities of all patterns were similar, implying a similar crystallinity of all supports. Interestingly, with the increase of CTAC, SAXD patterns exhibited a slight shift of peak at the low 2θ region from 2.0° to 2.1°, indicating a regular variation of mesoporous size [22]. This was further confirmed by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms test discussed below (Fig. 2b). With the increase of CTAC content, a significant decrease in isotherms was observed due to the occupation of brush-like CTAC in the samples. Although CTAC occupied a large proportion of pores in the MMSN-X, they still retained similar type of adsorption-desorption isotherms compared with MMSN. The corresponding pore size distribution curve (Fig. S3) further showed two distinct peaks in the pore width ranged of 0.9–1.5 and 2–4 nm. The same result of meso-size change could be confirmed indirectly in SAXD spectrum. As listed in Table S1, with the additive amount of CTAC decreasing from 30 to 0 wt%, the surface area, micropore and mesopore volume of the supports increased in turn from the initial 431 m2/g, 0.28 cm3/g, and 0.72 cm3/g to the final 981 m2/g, 0.78 cm3/g, and 1.12 cm3/g. The changing trend of these structural properties provided evidence that brush-like CTAC amount in MMSN samples could be adjusted and controlled.

The successful synthesis of MMSN-X with brush-like CTAC was verified using FTIR spectra in Fig. 2c. The IR spectra of all samples resembled the reported silica and exhibited the following characteristic (1) asymmetric Si-O-Si stretching vibration bands at 1220 and 1060 cm−1; (2) symmetric Si-O stretching vibration band at 798 cm−1; and (3) Si-O-Si rocking vibration band at 959 cm−1 [28]. Compared with MMSN without brush-like CTAC, some new peaks of MMSN-X were observed at 2926 and 2850 cm−1 corresponding to the methylene C-H stretching vibration associated with an absorption band at 1479 cm−1, which could confirm the existence of brush-like CTAC in the supports [29]. More importantly, peak height ratios of the methylene C-H to the silica Si-O-Si gradually reduced (Table S2) during the removal of CTAC from MMSN-30, illustrating that the number of CTAC was successfully controlled on MMSN-X. To ascertain the amount of CTAC in MMSN-X samples, quantitative analysis was discussed by TGA experiments at the oxygen atmosphere in Fig. 2d. Obviously, the weight loss for MMSN-X can be observed after heating above 100 °C, while the weight of MMSN was not noticeably decreased. The CTAC content of MMSN, MMSN-10, MMSN-20, and MMSN-30 calculated according to the TGA weight loss were 0.00, 6.26, 21.44, 31.88 wt%, respectively (Table 1).

To further verify the existence and the amount of brush-like CTAC in MMSN-X samples, XPS analysis was discussed. The complete XPS survey spectra of support in Fig. 2e showed the existence of Si 2s and O 1s core-levels that was attributed to the silica at binding energies of 100 and 529 eV. The C 1s response of the MMSN-10, MMSN-20, and MMSN-30 samples observed at 284.78 eV was assigned to a combination of adventitious carbon on the surface and the CTAC of brush-like long-alkyl chains [30]. For a better interpretation of the XPS spectra, the high-resolution N 1s and O 1s spectra of MMSN-X were deconvoluted in Fig. S4. Compared with the high-resolution spectra of MMSN, MMSN-X displayed two additional peaks at binding energies of 402.5 and 529.9 eV, indicating the presence of CTAC on the MMSN-X surface [31]. Moreover, C 1s and N 1s responses of these samples were also greatly enhanced by increasing the amount of brush-like CTAC. The corresponding XPS intensity ratio was listed in Table S2. The C/Si and N/Si ratios in these samples increased from 0.05 and 0.00–1.08 and 0.05 with the brush-like CTAC content increasing, respectively. The CTAC content of MMSN, MMSN-10, MMSN-20, and MMSN-30 calculated from XPS analysis were 0.00, 5.81, 25.40, and 33.02 wt%, respectively, which were close to the results concluded from TGA analysis discussed before. This result indicated the existence of CTAC on the silica surface, in which this form owned a much more active chemical environment than the silica-hydroxyl [32], [33].
3.2. Adsorbents analysis
The adsorbents (MMSN-X/TEPA-50 (X = 0, 10, 20, 30)) were prepared by impregnating with the same amount of TEPA (50 wt%) onto supports, respectively. In comparison with the FTIR spectra of the supports (Fig. 2c), MMSN-X/TEPA-50 (X = 0, 10, 20, 30) shown in Fig. 3a exhibited new IR absorbance bands at 1660 and 1565 cm−1, which were assigned to the bending vibrations of secondary amine (NH) and primary amines (NH2) in TEPA [34], [35]. In addition, the decrease in pore volume of adsorbents indicated that TEPA was loaded within the channels (Table S1). This result could verify that TEPA molecules were successfully impregnated into the supports. To ascertain the amount of TEPA in the supports, TGA experiments were carried out at the oxygen atmosphere in Fig. 3b. According to the TGA weight loss curves, the actual TEPA content of MMSN/TEPA-50, MMSN-10/TEPA-50, MMSN-20/TEPA-50, and MMSN-30/TEPA-50 were 47.6, 48.0, 47.7, and 48.3 wt%, respectively (Table S3). Besides, amine modified support (MMSN-30) was selected to determine the optimal amine amount. For other adsorbents, the TEPA content of MMSN-30/TEPA-20, MMSN-30/TEPA-30, MMSN-30/TEPA-40, MMSN-30/TEPA-60, and MMSN-30/TEPA-70 was 16.3, 22.3, 36.8, 54.3, and 63.9 wt%, respectively. (Fig. S5 and Table S3).

3.3. CO2 capture
Before evaluating the role of brush-like CTAC on CO2 adsorption, the optimal TEPA loading should be determined. CO2 adsorption amount of MMSN-30/TEPA-Y (Y=20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70) were carried out under different temperatures (25, 50, and 75 °C) and 1 atm. As shown in Fig. 4a, with the increased content of TEPA loading in MMSN-30, CO2 adsorption capacity of adsorbents first increased and then decreased under all temperature conditions. This indicates that the loading of TEPA can indeed increase the amine sites, whereas the excess TEPA would block the pore (Fig. S6), leading to the decrease of the adsorption capacity when the proportion exceeds 50% [36]. MMSN-30/TEPA-50 exhibited the maximum CO2 adsorption capacity at ambient temperature (from 4.55 to 4.78 mmol/g in the range of 25–50 °C), and was chosen as the optimal amine impregnated adsorbent. In addition, the maximum CO2 adsorption capacity of high TEPA loading adsorbents was obtained at 75 °C rather than 25 °C, which was contrary to the general conclusions of thermodynamics. This phenomenon was determined by the combined effects of thermodynamics and kinetics, consistent with the results reported previously [6].

Based on the above result about the maximum CO2 adsorption capacity, all supports were impregnated with 50 wt% TEPA. The CO2 adsorption capacity and amine efficiency of MMSN-X/TEPA-50 (X = 0, 10, 20, 30) were illustrated in Fig. 4b. Both CO2 adsorption capacity and amine efficiency of adsorbents increased with the amount of brush-like CTAC. Consequently, in contrast with MMSN/TEPA-50, MMSN-30/TEPA-50 exhibited the maximum CO2 capture (4.55 mmol/g) and amine efficiency (0.25 mmol CO2/mmol N) at 25 °C and 1 atm (Table 1), which increased by about 47% and 39%, respectively. In addition, the multicycle stability of MMSN-X/TEPA-60 (X = 0, 10, 20, 30) was investigated at 25 °C under dry 100 vol% CO2. After 6 cycles, there was no significant loss in CO2 adsorption capacity at 25 °C (Fig. S7 and Table S5), indicating MMSN-X/TEPA-60 with excellent multicycle stability.
Moreover, the CO2 capture of adsorbents was assessed under simulated practical conditions. Generally, the typical ﬂue gas (75 °C) has 15 vol% CO2 and the typical ambient air (25 °C) contains 0.0400 vol% CO2 [37]. Hence, the adsorption performance of MMSN-X/TEPA-50 (X = 0, 10, 20, 30) was measured in the simulated flue gas and ambient air flow, respectively, in Fig. 5. At the same TEPA loading, the CO2 adsorption capacity under simulated practical conditions was still enhanced by increasing the content of brush-like CTAC in the adsorbents, corresponding to the above conclusion. The CO2 capture of MMSN-30/TEPA-50 was as high as 4.72 and 3.68 mmol/g under flue gas and air ambient conditions (Fig. S8d–e). The most relevant literature data obtained under dry conditions were shown in Fig. 6 [4], [6], [14], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79], [80], [81], [82], [83]. Compared with the literature data, MMSN-30/TEPA-50 exhibited higher CO2 adsorption capacity, demonstrating the role of brush-like CTAC to enhance CO2 adsorption. It was particularly noticeable that moisture had a positive effect on CO2 capture on MMSN-30/TEPA-50 (Fig. S9), confirming by breakthrough curves under humid and dry conditions. The amount of CO2 adsorption under ambient air in humid conditions was 4.75 mmol/g, which was enhanced over 20% compared with that in dry conditions (3.83 mmol/g under ambient air), indicating that the water-enhancing effect towards CO2 adsorption would not be influenced by the presence of CTAC. These may be related to a change in the chemical compound formed between CO2 and TEPA from carbamate (CO2/N = 0.5) under dry conditions to the bicarbonate (CO2/N = 1) under humid conditions [23]. Therefore, MMSN-30/TEPA-50 is a promising adsorbent for the application of CO2 adsorption from ambient air.

3.4. CO2 adsorption properties
In order to investigate the role of brush-like CTAC on the adsorption rate, the pseudo-first, pseudo-second and fractional order kinetic models were employed to study the adsorption kinetics of MMSN-X/TEPA-50 (X = 0, 10, 20, 30) in 100 vol% CO2 at 25 °C. The fitting results showed that R2 of fractional order model significantly was higher the pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order model (Table S7), indicating that the fractional order model could precisely reflect the CO2 adsorption process (Fig. 7). The phenomenon illustrated that the adsorption rate control step has changed from single physisorption or chemisorption to both physical and chemical adsorption [84]. In addition, the parameter m reflected the adsorption rate. The value of m enhanced with increasing CTAC loading amount (Table S7), as expected [85], [86]. In order to further explain the relationship between the adsorption rate and the number of brushes, CO2 adsorption process was divided into three sections and fitted using linearized adsorption rate model, including initial, intermediate and final adsorption stage (Fig. 8) [87], [88]. At the initial adsorption stage, most of the adsorption period was completed. Therefore, a great number of amine sites were occupied, and the adsorption rate nearly ceased at the intermediate and final stage. The initial adsorption stage was predicted using linearized adsorption rate model, and the adsorption rate became faster with the increase of the brush-like CTAC (Table S7). In addition, the CO2 adsorption isotherms of adsorbents were shown in Fig. S10. Freundlich model was applied to analyze the thermodynamic behavior, and related parameters were summarized in Table S8 and S9. The negative value of ΔG meant that the adsorption process led to a decrease in Gibbs free energy and confirmed the spontaneous nature of the adsorption process. As the temperature rose, the CO2 adsorption capacity on the adsorbent increased, which was the same as the result of CO2 uptake test. Moreover, the value of enthalpy change was gradually enhanced with increasing CTAC amount, indicating that there was a conversion in adsorption product.

3.5. Adsorption mechanism
In situ FTIR spectroscopy on MMSN/TEPA-50 and MMSN-30/TEPA-50 was performed to demonstrate the role of brush-like CTAC on CO2 adsorption mechanism (Fig. 9) under conditions of 100 vol% CO2, 1 atm and 25 °C. Some new bands readily appeared after CO2 adsorption on solid amine sorbent for a few minutes as tabulated in Table S10. Owing to the frequency for the vibrational mode in gaseous CO2, the specified peak intensity at 2349 cm−1 increased gradually with the measurement time [89], [90]. Meanwhile, a similar trend in the band intensity at 3730–3580 cm−1 (gas-phase CO2 overtones) was observed. The phenomena proved that CO2 adsorption gradually came to saturation [30], [91]. Moreover, to distinguish the phenomenon between adsorbents and supports on CO2 adsorption, the spectra of a non-polar group (non-amine functionalized samples) as a reference were presented in Fig. S11. As shown in Fig. 9a–b, several peaks indicated CO2 molecules only reacted with the primary amines of TEPA chains, including the features in the fingerprint region from CO stretching band of carbamic acid at 1696 cm−1, RNH3+ stretching and deformation bands at 3030 and 1640 cm−1, stretching vibration of COO- in carbamates at 1560 and 1525 cm−1, and NCOO- skeletal vibrations at 1410 and 1285 cm−1 [92], [93], [94], [95], [96]. This agreed with the CO2 reaction mechanisms proposed by Wilfong et al., who studied the nature of adsorbed CO2 on TEPA films by in situ ATR and DRIFTS [34]. These demonstrated that CO2 molecules reacted with the primary amines of TEPA chains to form alkylammonium carbamate and carbamic acid on MMSN/TEPA-50 and MMSN-30/TEPA-50 at 25 °C as described in reactions (1)-(2). As displayed in Fig. 9a, the band formed at 1696 cm−1 is CO stretching of carbamic acid, and the band at 1640 cm−1 is N-H deformation in RNH3+. As a result, the peak intensity of these formed species gradually increased for brush-like MMSN-30/TEPA-50 as the adsorption process proceeded. Notably, the intensity of CO stretching band of carbamic acid became stronger than that of N-H deformation in RNH3+ from 9 min to saturation time of 20 min. Nevertheless, MMSN/TEPA-50 in Fig. 9b displayed that the intensity of CO stretching band of carbamic acid was always weaker than that of N-H deformation in RNH3+ from the beginning to saturation (30 min). In other words, for MMSN-30/TEPA-50, the reaction (1) was the dominant reaction at the beginning, then the reaction (2) dominated the adsorption process for the next reaction time, while the reaction (1) always played a major role for MMSN/TEPA-50 without brush-like CTAC. These discrepancies demonstrated the existence of brush-like CTAC could promote intramolecular proton transfer of the RNH2+COO- intermediate to produce NHCOOH (carbamic acid) for brush-like long-alkyl chains in TEPA-functionalized adsorbent. In brief, CO2 adsorption capacity and amine efficiency of adsorbents were improved at 25 °C for MMSN-30/TEPA-50 due to the double utilization of amine in reaction (2).

Fig. 9. FTIR spectra of CO2 adsorption were recorded (a) on MMSN-30/TEPA-50, (b) MMSN/TEPA-50 under conditions of 100 vol% CO2, 1 atm and 25 °C, (c) on MMSN-30/TEPA-50 under conditions of 100 vol% CO2, 1 atm and 75 °C, (d) on MMSN-30/TEPA-50 at 25, 75 °C, and on MMSN/TEPA-50 at 25 °C under conditions of 100 vol% CO2 and 1 atm.
For the CO2 adsorption on MMSN-30/TEPA-50 at 75 °C (Fig. 9c), except for the previously observed bands, the new stretching vibration peak at 3330 cm−1 was ascribed to N-H stretch in R2NH+COO-. Ultimately, proton transferred from the R2NH+COO- intermediate to a neighboring R2NH group, generating R2NH2+ and R2NCOO-. In addition, the bands at 3030 cm−1 were also attributed to N-H stretch in RNH3+/R2NH2+ [92]. Therefore, CO2 adsorption on the MMSN-30/TEPA-50 at 75 °C involved the primary amine at the above reactions (1)-(2) and secondary amine of TEPA chains in the following reactions (3). Unexpectedly, the intensity of CO stretching band of carbamic acid at 1696 cm−1 was always weaker than that of N-H deformation in RNH3+ at 1640 cm−1 and N-H stretch in R2NH+COO- at 3330 cm−1 until the end of the reaction (16 min), namely the reaction (1) and (3) seized a dominant. This feature can be postulated that a high temperature promoted TEPA dispersion in the presence of brush-like CTAC and the part of polymerized secondary amine moieties may be readily accessible to CO2 molecules [93], [97].

The reaction mechanisms were illustrated in Fig. 9d. The difference of CO2 adsorption spectrum suggested brush-like long-alkyl chains played a key role in promoting the reaction for CO2 and primary amine to form carbamic acid and enhancing amine dispersion to use the secondary amine. Therefore, the increase of the CO2 adsorption capacity of MMSN-30/TEPA-50 was mainly owing to the change of the dominant reaction at the ambient temperature. At the high temperature, the enhancement could attribute to the secondary amine participation in the reaction.
Based on the above results, we could conclude that the introduction of CTAC at the interface of the silica enhanced the CO2 adsorption performance. As illustrated in Fig. 10, there were two mature insights on the reaction between amine and CO2 under dry conditions [90]. With the cooperation from external protons, carbamic acid was produced by one amine and one CO2 molecule (CO2/N = 1), while two amines combined with one CO2 molecule (CO2/N = 0.5) to form carbamate without the external assistance. For chemisorption of CO2, Hahn et al. reported that the activation energy of carbamic acid was lower than that of carbamate by density functional theory [89], so the synthesis of carbamic acid showed a faster adsorption rate. Consequently, CO2 was excited and the proton assisted the amines to form carbamic acid under dry conditions, which improved the CO2 adsorption capacity and accelerated the CO2 adsorption rate.

4. Conclusions
Herein, we demonstrated a high amine efficient sorbent for CO2 capture from flue gas or ambient air and the role of CTAC in amine adsorbent materials. The brush-like CTAC supports were successfully synthesized as confirmed by N2 adsorption/desorption, XPS and FTIR. Meanwhile, the amount of CTAC was calculated by TGA and XPS. In addition, TEPA was introduced to MMSN-X supports by employing well-known impregnation procedures, creating four analogous series of amine-hybrid adsorbents. We observed unique trends in CO2 capacity with the increase of CTAC, and brush-like MMSN-30/TEPA-50 showed the supreme CO2 adsorption capacity (4.55 mmol/g) in 100 vol% CO2 and 25 °C. To further study the role of brush-like CTAC, the CO2 adsorption curves of different amounts of CTAC adsorbents were fitted by fractional order model, and CO2 adsorption rate was gradually improved with the increase of brush-like CTAC amount. Hence, we considered that the rate change might be due to CTAC involvement to generate low binding energy products more readily. Finally, the improvement of amine efficiency was verified by in situ FTIR that brush-like CTAC promoted the variation of adsorption product (conversion from carbamate (CO2/N = 0.5) to carbamic acid (CO2/N = 1)). This work provided a new strategy by modifying the surface of support for the development of high amine efficiency adsorbents for CO2 capture from air.
