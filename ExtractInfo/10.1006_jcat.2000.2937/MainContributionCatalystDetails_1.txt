The given document discusses the MoVNbTeOx catalyst for propane ammoxidation, which is the conversion of propane to acrylonitrile using ammonia as the nitrogen source. It does not relate to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH), which convert propane to propylene. As the document does not pertain to PDH or ODH processes, no scientific contributions related to propane to propylene conversion catalysts are extracted.
