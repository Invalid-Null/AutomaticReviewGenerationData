The given document does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on low-temperature selective catalytic reduction of NO by NH3 over CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2 catalysts. While it discusses catalyst preparation methods and improvements in performance, the catalysts and reactions are not related to converting propane to propylene.
