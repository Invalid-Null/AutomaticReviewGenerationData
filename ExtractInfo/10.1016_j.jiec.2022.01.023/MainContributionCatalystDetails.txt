 Based on the multiple extractions provided, here is a synthesized summary of the key information in a unified XML format:

The documents provided do not seem directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation research. They focus on selective catalytic reduction of NOx using NH3 over various catalysts like Mn/TiO2 and CeO2-promoted Mn/TiO2. While they explore catalyst preparation methods and performance enhancements, they do not specifically discuss conversion of propane to propylene. Since the documents are not directly related to propane dehydrogenation, I have indicated "No" relevance in the XML output.
