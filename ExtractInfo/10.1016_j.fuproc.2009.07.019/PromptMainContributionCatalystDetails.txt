Influence of the different dechlorination time on catalytic performances of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation
Abstract
Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has recently received considerable attention because of the increasing demand for propene. Among several catalysts, PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst is one of the most suitable ones. In this study, PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalysts with different content of chlorine were prepared by changing the time of catalyst dechlorination. The obtained catalysts were characterized by X-ray fluorescence (XRF), XRD, nitrogen adsorption, 27Al MAS NMR, NH3-TPD, H2 chemisorption and TPR. It was found that with the increase of treatment time, more framework aluminum atoms were removed from tetrahedral positions, leading to the loss of Sn species and the decrease of catalyst acidity. Meantime, the porous properties and the interactions between Pt and Sn of the catalysts changed remarkably, which was disadvantageous to the reaction. Compared with the dechlorinated catalysts, the fresh sample with suitable content of chlorine exhibited the best reaction activity and stability. The average yield of propene was about 30.4% over 45 h for the reaction of propane dehydrogenation at 590 °C. Finally, a model was proposed for the influence of dechlorinated treatment on catalytic properties of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation.
1. Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene.[1], [2]. However, the reaction of propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic process that requires a relatively high temperature to obtain a high yield of propene. Therefore, the deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation is inevitable because of the rigorous reaction conditions. Meanwhile, two types of catalysts have been reported for propane dehydrogenation: chromium-based catalysts and platinum-supported catalysts [3], [4], whereas the reaction stability of these catalysts are relatively low.
ZSM-5 zeolite is a member of crystalline microporous aluminosilicates with low aluminum content. Due to the specific framework structure and the low aluminum content ZSM-5 zeolite has special properties and is used widely in many important industrial processes like catalytic aromatization [5], cracking [6] and disproportionation [7]. On the other hand, there is growing interest in developing platinum-impregnated HZSM-5 zeolite for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. Our previous work [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13] discussed the effect of promoter and reaction conditions on catalytic performances of PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and found that PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst with suitable amount of Na showed relatively high propane conversion and propene selectivity. However, worthy of mention is that on these reported catalysts, the conditions for dechlorination are relatively gentle. Therefore, it can be assumed that the possibilities of severe dechlorination of these catalysts are relatively little.
In order to further improve the catalytic property of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, changing the catalyst acidity and the character of Pt active sites is very important. Generally, supported Pt–Sn catalysts are often prepared from Cl-containing precursors such as H2PtCl6, SnCl2 or SnCl4. Therefore, the role of Cl influencing catalytic character in terms of structural, acidic, and active metal are inevitable. Many previous investigators [14], [15], [16] have reported that the presence of chlorine can lead to improved selectivity in oxidation reactions and the addition of chlorine either to the catalyst itself or in the feed has increased reactant conversion and product selectivity by several percent. Gracia et al. [17] reported the effect of Cl on the activity of Pt-supported catalysts for CO, methane, and ethane oxidation. They found that on the Cl-containing catalyst, there were also Pt–Cl as well as Pt–Pt and Pt–O bonds, and the presence of chlorine could significantly reduce the amount of CO adsorbed on metallic Pt sites. Paulis et al. [18] systematically studied the effect of chlorine on catalytic properties of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in the complete oxidation of toluene and found that the mobility of chlorine was responsible for the changed reaction stability. Arteaga et al. [19] investigated the catalyst regeneration over Pt/Al2O3 and Pt–Sn/Al2O3 with and without chlorine in detail and concluded that although the electronic effects of added chlorine on metal catalysis were not important, the presence of both Sn and Cl showed additional effects due to the promotion by chlorine of greater intimacy between Sn and Pt in reduced catalysts. However, in non-oxidative reaction, particularly the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, the effect of chlorine has been reported rarely. Moreover, in terms of the reported literatures [20], [21], the contents of chlorine of the catalysts are confirmed mainly by using the chlorinated and nonchlorinated metal precursor salts, which is absolutely different with the treatment procedures that we adopted. Character of chlorine on Pt-based catalysts by the different treatment may result in the variant behaviors, which may affect on the catalytic performance significantly.
In the present study, relatively severe dechlorinated procedures were carried out and PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalysts with different content of chlorine were prepared mainly by changing the time of catalyst dechlorination. The catalysts were studied by several techniques, including X-ray fluorescence (XRF), XRD, 27Al MAS NMR, nitrogen adsorption, NH3-TPD, H2 chemisorption and TPR. Particular emphasis was focused on the changes of acidity and character of Pt active sites in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst and the results were correlated with a corresponding catalytic reaction. This can provide us with important information to understand the role of chlorine on supported metallic catalyst.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by sequential impregnation method in our laboratory according to a procedure in our previous work [8], [9], [11], [12]. The nominal compositions of the catalyst were 0.5 wt.% for Pt, 1.0 wt.% for Sn, and 1.0 wt.% for Na, respectively.
To obtain larger and more resistant particles, the prepared samples were fully agglomerated with 5.0 wt.% alumina during the process of pelletization. About the effect of alumina binder on catalytic property of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst has been reported elsewhere [8]. After totally dried, the catalysts were calcined at 500 °C for 4 h, then dechlorinated at 500 °C in air containing steam for different time. After the routine dechlorination treatment, the catalysts were reduced under H2 at 500 °C for 8 h.
2.2. Dechlorinated treatment
Dechlorinated treatment of the catalysts was performed in a reactor that we constructed. The samples were heated up to 500 °C, under a flow of an air-steam mixture at a flow rate of 30 ml min− 1 and a steam partial pressure of 7.38 KPa. The samples were kept at this temperature for a specified time period (1, 2, 3 or 4 h). Finally, the samples were cooled to room temperature before the reaction.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
The elemental contents were obtained by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements on a SWITZERLAND ARL9800 XRF. The corresponding designation of the different catalysts is shown in Table 1.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the different samples were obtained on a XD-3A X-ray powder diffractometer coupled to a copper anode tube. The Kα radiation was selected with a diffracted beam monochromator. An angular range 2θ from 5 to 40° was recorded using step scanning and long counting times to determine the positions of the ZSM-5 peaks.
Solid-state 27Al MAS NMR spectra were collected in a Brucker DSX-400 spectrometer. The 27Al NMR spectra were obtained at 10.0 KHz, using 15° pulses and 4 s delay, a total of 2000 pulses being accumulated.
N2-adsorption studies were used to examine the porous properties of each sample. The measurements were carried out on Micromeritics ASAP 2000 adsorptive and desorptive apparatus, and all the samples were pretreated in vacuum at 350 °C for 15 h before the measurements. The specific surface area was obtained using the BET method. The micropore volume was determined from the t-plot method.
NH3-TPD experiment was measured with a conventional TPD apparatus. About 0.15 g of sample was placed in a quartz reactor and saturated with ammonia at room temperature. TPD was carried out from 100 °C to 550 °C with a heating rate β of 10 °C min− 1 and with helium (30 ml min− 1) as the carrier gas.
Hydrogen chemisorption experiment was performed on the apparatus that described for NH3-TPD. The samples were reduced in flowing H2 at 500 °C for 2 h, then exposed to N2 at 550 °C for 1 h to remove the hydrogen. Details of the experimental procedure have been described elsewhere [22] except that the high temperatures for chemisorption are 300 °C and 450 °C.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was measured with the same apparatus as that of the hydrogen chemisorption. Prior to the TPR experiments, the catalysts were dried in flowing N2 at 400 °C for 1 h. 5% H2/N2 was used as the reducing gas at a flow rate of 40 ml min− 1. The rate of temperature rise in the TPR experiment was 10 °C min− 1 up to 700 °C.
2.4. Catalytic reaction
After the treatment, propane dehydrogenation was carried out in a conventional quartz tubular micro-reactor. The catalyst (mass 0.2 g) was placed into the center of the reactor. Reaction conditions were as follows: 590 °C for reaction temperature, 0.1Mpa pressure, H2/C3 = 0.25(molar ratio) and the propane weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) is 3.0 h− 1. The reaction products were analyzed with an online GC-14C gas chromatography and the conversion of propane and selectivity of alkenes or alkanes were defined as follows:
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of catalysts
X-ray diffraction patterns of the different catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. It is clear that the XRD of no dechlorinated sample displays the same peaks as pure ZSM-5, indicating that the impregnation does not destroy the original structure of ZSM-5 zeolite. Presumably, part of Na+ and Sn4+ could enter the main channels of ZSM-5, whereas the platinum particles were located mainly on the external surface of the zeolite due to their relatively large average diameters [11], [12], [13]. As shown in Fig. 1, when the dechlorination time is 2 h (Fig. 1c), the intensities of the corresponding peaks of angle 2θ = 22–24° decrease a little in comparison with those of the fresh sample, implying that the crystallinity of the catalyst is degraded [23]. With the increase of dechlorination time, this tendency becomes more evident. It is obvious that the sample dechlorinated for 4 h (Fig. 1d), the lowest percent crystallinity is observed.

27Al MAS NMR spectra for some samples in this study are collected. As shown in Fig. 2, ZSM-5 zeolite exhibits a relatively strong signal at about 54 ppm, which is attributed to four-coordinated aluminum, and a weak peak assigned to six-coordinated extra-framework Al (EFAL) at about 0 ppm [24]. As for the catalyst that has no dechlorination, the changes of the corresponding peaks at 54 ppm and 0 ppm can be considered negligible. However, after the dechlorinated treatment for 2 h, more decrease in four-coordinated aluminum and increase in six-coordinated aluminum are observed, indicating that some Al species have migrated from framework tetrahedral positions and existed as nonstructural Al species. Moreover, this tendency becomes more apparent with the increase of treatment time. These findings display that the degree of dealumination would mainly depend on the dechlorinated treatment time and this is the possible reason for the degraded crystallinity of the catalysts. Nevertheless, after the 27Al MAS NMR spectra of this experiment and former hydrotreated ones [11] are compared, the degree of dealumination of the catalyst by the dechlorination is inferior to that by the hydrothermal treatment. This is because the partial pressure and treatment temperature of steam in this experiment are less than those of the hydrotreated ones.

Table 2 lists the basic characterization data of the different catalysts. It is apparent that the fresh catalyst possesses the largest BET surface area, instead, a decrease in the surface area is observed after the dechlorinated treatment. Similarly, this tendency becomes more apparent with the increase of treatment time. In the sample dechlorinated for 4 h, the surface area decreases about 8.9% when comparing with that of the fresh one. Previous study showed that the BET surface area of Y zeolite decreased upon the hydrothermal treatment because of the collapse of the zeolite framework [25]. However, in this study, the possibility about the collapse of ZSM-5 framework is little as it is revealed from their XRD patterns, and the changes in BET surface areas are more related to the modifications of physicochemical properties of the zeolite due to the treatment of dechlorination. With respect to pore volume of the different catalysts, it decreases with the increase of dechlorination time. These findings show that the treatment of dechlorination has obvious impacts on the porous properties of the catalysts. As discussed above, these behaviors are related with the dealumination of the catalysts. Under the relatively severe dechlorination conditions, more amounts of non-framework aluminum may exist in the channels of the zeolite, thus decreasing the pore volume of the catalyst.

Different dechlorination time can affect the catalyst acidity obviously. NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and NH3 uptake of the different catalysts are presented in Fig. 3 and summarized in Table 3, respectively. There displays two ammonia desorption peaks for ZSM-5 zeolite: the first desorption peak at about 240 °C is assigned to the weak acid sites, whereas the second peak at about 450 °C corresponds to strong acid sites, which is in good agreement with the reported literature data [26], [27]. As for the untreated catalyst, a distinct decrease of ammonia desorption at low temperature, and almost no ammonia desorption at high temperature are observed, suggesting that the addition of sodium can neutralize the strong acid sites preferentially. After the treatment of dechlorination, all samples exhibit the similar TPD profiles. With increasing dechlorination time, the acid amount of the catalysts decrease (Table 3), and the acid intensities of the weak acid center become weaker continuously as evidenced from the ammonia desorption temperature moves towards the lower range. Similar effect was also observed by Arteaga et al. [19] and they found that the presence of chlorine could increase the acidity of the support. Actually, in many industrial reforming catalysts, the introduction of chlorine is an essential method to make the surface of the support more acidic [28], [29]. Sachtler [30] discussed the possible reasons for chlorine-containing catalyst and assumed the formation of a surface complex from promoter, support and Cl, which could produce a change in the acid function of the catalyst.

Dechlorinated treatment can also have obvious impact on the character of Pt active sites. Table 4 lists the H2 uptake of the different catalysts. It is known that H2 chemisorption has been employed as one of the effective methods to determine the metal surface area and dispersion of metallic catalysts. However, the quantitative determination of the surface area by H2 adsorption is interfered by the interaction of Pt with Sn oxide. This neighboring effect can be used as a probe to characterize the properties of different active sites via selective adsorption or temperature-programmed desorption of H2. From Table 4, the fresh catalyst shows a relatively little amount of H2 that adsorbed at room temperature, whereas the amount of adsorbed H2 is relatively high when the experiment is carried out at 300 °C and 450 °C, suggesting that some interactions exist between Pt and SnOx. According to Lin et al. [31], Pt could be located on SnOx modified carrier surface to form new active sites with “sandwich structure,” which was favorable for the reaction. After the dechlorinated treatment for 1 h, the amounts of adsorbed H2, not only at room temperature, but also at high temperature decrease a little, meaning that in this case, the interactions between Pt and SnOx become a little weak and the surface character of active sites changes. In the same way, this tendency becomes more evident with the increase of treatment time. These findings demonstrate that the relatively severe treatment condition can significantly change the character of Pt active sites and the interactions between Pt and SnOx become weak remarkably. In other words, the presence of chlorine would favor the platinum–tin interactions. Traxel and Hohn [32] investigated the roe of chlorine on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane at millisecond contact times and found that the addition of chlorine resulted in a doubling of Pt dispersion. Recently, Albero et al. [33] found that the Cl-free PtZn catalysts showed the relatively lower catalytic selectivity, which could be explained by a lower Pt–Zn interaction. Obviously, their findings are consistent with the results of the chemisorption experiment.

Fig. 4 shows the H2-TPR profiles of the different catalysts. The fresh sample presents a peak, whose maximum is placed at about 300 °C, and also two other peaks at about 410 °C and 600 °C, respectively. In general, the signal at 300 °C is ascribed to reduction of Pt, whereas the high-temperature peaks represent reduction of Sn4+ to Sn2+ and Sn2+ to Sn0 [9], [11]. As listed in Table 5, in this case the total H2 consumption is 71 µmol/g cat. After the dechlorinated treatment for 1 h, sharply decreased amount of total H2 consumption is observed (Table 5), indicating that the treatment of dechlorination has obvious impact on the reduction behaviors of Pt and Sn species. With the increase of treatment time, the reduction temperature of Pt species movies towards the lower range apparently. At the same time, it is interesting to note that the higher temperature peak corresponding to the reduction of SnO2 to Sn2+ increases considerably, meaning that most of Sn forms SnO2 after the dechlorinated treatment. Additionally, this tendency becomes more apparent when the treatment time is 3 h.(Fig. 4d.) From Table 5, the H2 consumption of this reduction (dechlorinated for 3 h) increases about 25.9% when comparing with that of the catalyst (dechlorinated for 1 h). Morales et al. [34] investigated the oxidation states of Sn on the surface of PtSn/H[Al]ZSM-5 catalyst by XPS and found that most of tin existed in a form of SnOx (0 < x < 2). Therefore, the increase in the Sn4+ reduction signal can be attributed to the oxidative effect of steam. This is because the dealumination of carrier is inevitable during the process of dechlorination, which in consequence weakens the interactions between Sn species and ZSM-5 zeolite. However, as for the sample dechlorinated for 4 h, a decrease in this reduction peak is found. In order to discuss the possible reasons for this behavior, elemental contents of different samples (by X-ray fluorescence) are measured. As Table 1 indicates, the content of Cl decreases sharply after the dechlorination treatment for 1 h, then this depressed extent becomes relatively gentle. Moreover, the change tendency of Pt and Na contents can be considered negligible, while the content of Sn decreases relatively clearly. Indeed, the lost degree of it becomes more serious with the increase of treated time. It is proposed that the loss of Sn species is also associated with the dealumination of the zeolite, because the existence of aluminum can stabilize Sn species [31].

3.2. Catalytic performances
Fig. 5 presents the catalytic performances of the different catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5(1), the fresh sample exhibits the highest initial propane conversion. In this situation, the selectivity to propene increases progressively and reaches 96.3% finally. Clearly, these phenomenons can be attributed to the carbon depositions that produced during the reaction, which can cover the active sites of the catalysts, thus decreasing the catalytic activity and inhabiting the side reactions to be carried out to some extent. In contrast, the catalytic activity decreases significantly, whereas the propene selectivity increases after the dechlorinated treatment for 1 h. From Fig. 5(2), its selectivity is 97.4% after the reaction. Increasing the treatment time, not only the propane conversion, but also the propene selectivity shows the degressive trend. The longer the dechlorination time is, the more apparent of this tendency is. Concerning the sample that has been dechlorinated for 4 h, the catalytic activity and the selectivity decreases about 24.7% and 4.6% respectively when comparing with those of the fresh sample after the reaction.

To explain this, it should be noted that PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst is bifunctional and the two active centers (the metal particles and the acid sites) may work collaboratively [36]: the (de)hydrogenation and ring opening occur on the metal particle while the isomerization through the carbonium ion intermediates occurs on the acid site. At the same time, it is known that on PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst platinum is the only active metal and the propene is only formed on the metal by dehydrogenation; the main cracking product (ethene) is mainly formed from cracking on the carrier and the ethane is formed by hydrogenolysis of propane and by hydrogenation of ethene, with both reactions taking place on the metal. Therefore, the change of catalyst acidity and character of Pt active sites may influence the catalytic performances effectively. The fresh catalyst with relatively high content of chlorine, can affect the metal dispersion on the catalyst, which would indicate more surface area available for reaction and consequently lead to higher conversion. In addition, the presence of chlorine is also known to delay migration or sintering, because of greater metal-support interactions that occur with acidic support [32].Therefore, the fresh catalyst shows the best reaction stability. After the treatment for 1 h, the catalyst acidity (Table 3) and the H2 uptake (Table 4) decreases a little, thus destroying the initial matching between the metallic function and acid function in the fresh sample, which results in the decreased catalytic activity. On the other hand, little decreased acidity can suppress the side reactions to be carried out, which in consequence increases the selectivity to propene. With the increase of dechlorination time, the acidity of the catalyst decreases continuously and the interactions between Pt and Sn become weak. Besides, in these cases, the loss of Sn species is inevitable due to the dealumination of ZSM-5 zeolite. Thus, it seems reasonable that the initial best matching between the Pt active sites and the acid function may be destroyed further under the relatively severe treatment conditions, which is disadvantageous to the dehydrogenation of propane.
To further assess the performance of the fresh PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, a comparison with the dechlorinated PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst (dechlorinated for 1 h) by using a recycle reaction is made. As shown in Fig. 6, the propane conversions decrease with the process time. It is interesting to note that the deactivation rate of the dechlorinated PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst is much faster than that of the fresh sample with the increase of recycle number. In the fifth cycle reaction, the propane conversion decreases about 17.74% in dechlorinated PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst in contrast to that of the fresh one after reaction for 4 h. These findings indicate that the remarkable stability of dehydrogenation in recycle reaction is obtained over the fresh PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst.

A stability test of the fresh PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst without dechlorination is also carried out. The propane conversion and the selectivity to propene as a function of the reaction time are shown in Fig. 7. The selectivity to propene increases relatively quickly in the initial period and then becomes smooth, a high value (96.5%) is obtained in the overall process. On the other hand, only a small deactivation rate is observed in the overall process. The mean yield of propene is about 30.4% during the course of the reaction for 45 h. Following our previous work [10], the capacity of ZSM-5 supported catalyst to accommodate the coke is much better than the catalyst that supported on γ-Al2O3, thus improving the catalytic stability. The possible reason may attribute to the larger surface area and the particular character of channels of ZSM-5 zeolite.

On the fresh PtSnNa/ZSM-5 sample (Fig. 8a), Pt particles are dispersed highly on the external surface of the catalyst and some amounts of tin are deposited over the surface of platinum, existing in a form of SnOx (0 < x < 2). In this case, two kinds of active Pt species may exist on the surface of the catalyst, named Pt1 sites and Pt2 sites. Pt1 sites are the sites in which Pt directly anchors on the carrier surface, while Pt2 sites corresponding to the sites in which Pt anchors Sn oxide surface, with a “sandwich structure” composed of PtSnNa/ZSM-5. Generally, Pt1 sites are responsible for the side reactions, while Pt2 sites are the main reaction active sites for the dehydrogenation of propane [31]. However, after the treatment of dechlorination, the dealumination of ZSM-5 zeolites is inevitable due to the presence of steam as shown in Fig. 2. Therefore, the interactions between the tin species and ZSM-5 carrier become weak, which results in the loss of Sn species as listed in Table 1. In these circumstances, the initial “sandwich structure” is destroyed to some extents, making the Pt species that anchor Sn oxide previously anchor the carrier surface directly. In other words, the proportion of Pt1 sites increases, while the proportion of Pt2 sites decreases, which results in the decrease of catalytic activity and selectivity to propene. Prolonging the dechlorination treatment time, this change direction becomes more remarkably.
4. Conclusions
Different time of dechlorination has obvious impacts on catalytic performances of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. When the dechlorination time is 1 h, the catalyst acidity decreases a little and the interactions between Pt and Sn becomes weak, thus destroying the initial matching between the metallic function and acid function of the fresh catalyst, which results in the decreased catalytic activity. Increasing the dechlorination time, the porous properties and the character of Pt active sites of the catalysts have changed significantly. In these cases, more framework aluminum atoms are removed from tetrahedral positions, which lead to the loss of Sn species and weaken the interactions between Sn and ZSM-5 zeolite. In our experiments, the catalyst which has no dechlorination shows the best reaction activity and stability. The average yield of propene is about 30.4% over 45 h for the reaction of propane dehydrogenation at 590 °C. As for the sample dechlorinated for 4 h, the propane conversion and the selectivity to propene decreased about 24.7% and 4.6% respectively when comparing with those of the fresh catalyst.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
