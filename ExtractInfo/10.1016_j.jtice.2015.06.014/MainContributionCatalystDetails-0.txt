 Unfortunately the provided information does not seem to contain any relevant details about propane dehydrogenation research. The documents focus on the conversion of lactic acid to acetaldehyde using a magnesium aluminate spinel catalyst, which is not directly related to propane dehydrogenation. Since no pertinent information is provided, I cannot generate a meaningful XML summary for this request. Please provide documents that actually discuss propane dehydrogenation if you would like me to summarize their key findings in the requested XML format.
