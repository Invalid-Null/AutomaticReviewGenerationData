AbstractAbstract
Ga-based catalysts are promising for use in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) because of the relatively superior activity, but the conventional Ga-based catalysts usually suffer from serious deactivation and unsatisfactory propene selectivity. Here, ultrafine bimetallic Ga-Pt nanocatalysts encapsulated into silicalite-1 (S-1) zeolites (GaPt@S-1) were synthesized by a facile ligand-protected direct H2-reduction method. It is indicated that this catalyst is composed of confined ultra-small GaPt alloy nanoclusters and a part of isolated tetrahedral coordination of Ga species. The confined GaPt alloy nanoclusters are the active sites for PDH reaction, and their high electron density could boost the desorption of products, resulting in a high propene selectivity of 92.1% and propene formation rate of 20.5 mol g−1Pt h−1 at 600 °C. Moreover, no obvious deactivation was observed over GaPt@S-1 catalyst even after 24 h on stream at 600 °C, affording an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.0068 h−1, which is much lower than that of the conventional Ga-based catalysts. Notably, the restriction of the zeolite can enhance the regeneration stability of the catalyst, and the catalytic activity kept unchanged after four consecutive cycles.

1. Introduction
Propene is one of the most important feedstocks employed in the production of high valued chemical products such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile [1], [2], [3]. Growing attention has been focused on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) due to the growing demand of propene and the increasing production of propane from shale gas. In recent years, Pt-Sn and CrOx catalysts are widely used in industrial PDH processes, but the former is expensive and the latter is toxic [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Moreover, both of them are easily deactivated and require frequent regeneration. These factors limit the further development of PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent.
Alternatively, among various metal oxides (vanadium oxide [9], [10], [11], [12], zinc oxide [13], [14], [15], [16], gallium oxide [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], etc.) used in PDH, gallium oxide (GaOx) with low toxicity and low cost has been emerging as the promising candidate material in PDH process. However, the π-electrons of olefins are difficult to dissociate from the Ga-based catalysts, leading to the cleavage of CC bonds, thereby reducing its catalytic performance and limiting its practical application. The preparation of Ga-based catalysts with superior catalytic performance is very important from both industrial and academic points of view.
Platinum-based materials are well-known for exceptional performance in PDH process because of their superior activation of CH bonds [26]. Most significantly, introducing trace platinum into the non-expensive metal can modify the electronic structure of the catalyst by alloying, thus weakening the adsorption of π-bonded alkenes and decreasing the cracking of CC bonds. In addition, the electronic effects of the alloys are also driven by changes in the valence electron energy of the metal surface, which can effectively decrease the metal-adsorbate bond energy and boost the desorption of products [6], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. However, the surface Pt species of this catalyst usually suffer from poor recyclability and inferior stability during high-temperature reactions. Therefore, it is highly urgent to develop platinum-modified gallium catalysts with outstanding durability.
Zeolites with well-defined microporous channel structures and excellent thermal stability are considered as ideal supports for stabilizing metal species. In particular, zeolite-encaged metal catalysts possess unique and remarkable catalytic stability, which is very attractive in heterogeneous catalysis [32], [33], [34]. Recently, Pt and PtM catalysts (M = Zn, Sn) have been encapsulated into zeolites, and the reports have shown that the zeolite-encapsulated supported catalysts with excellent stability are valuable in practical applications [26], [34], [35], [36], [37]. Nevertheless, there is no report on the zeolite-encaged Ga-Pt bimetallic catalyst applied for PDH with excellent catalytic activity and stability, not mention to the study of the electronic effect of Ga-Pt bimetallic catalyst within zeolite for PDH reaction.
Herein, highly dispersed Ga-Pt bimetallic clusters encapsulated within a purely siliceous silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were prepared by an in situ method of hydrothermal process and subsequent ligand-protected direct H2 reduction. Monometallic Pt and Ga catalysts within S-1 zeolites were also synthesized for comparison purposes. Notably, the resulting GaPt@S-1 catalyst displays excellent catalytic performance and high stability during PDH. Furthermore, the active sites of GaPt@S-1 for PDH were verified by a series of techniques of XRD, DR UV–vis, XPS and the calculation of turnover rate (TOR). The electronic effect of GaPt alloy as well as the influence of electronic effect on the desorption of products were investigated in detail. Besides, the influence of acidity on the reaction and the confinement effect of zeolites were also studied and discussed.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), ethylenediamine, tetrapropylammonium hydroxide solution (TPAOH, 25 wt%), platinum dichloride, chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate and gallium(III) nitrate hydrate were obtained from Beijing Inno Chem. Co.
Silicalite-1 zeolite was prepared according to the reported procedure [38]. The GaPt@S-1 catalyst was prepared with the weight composition of 1.0 SiO2: 1.4 TPAOH: 10.5 H2O: 0.046 x [Ga(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3](NO3)3: 0.025 y [Pt(NH2CH2CH2NH2)2]Cl2 (x and y are the weight ratio of Ga and Pt in the mixture, respectively) under conventional hydrothermal conditions at 170 °C for 4 d. The detailed preparation of [Pt(NH2CH2CH2NH2)2]Cl2 and [Ga(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3](NO3)3 solution is shown in Supplementary Material. Then, the synthesized sample was washed three times with deionized water and dried overnight at 80 °C. Afterward, the resultant solid was reduced at 600 °C for 4 h under H2 atmosphere to obtain the final sample. For the purpose of comparison, Pt@S-1 and Ga@S-1 catalysts were also synthesized using similar synthesis strategy as GaPt@S-1 catalyst without the addition of [Ga(NH2CH2CH2NH2)3](NO3)3 and [Pt(NH2CH2CH2NH2)2]Cl2, respectively. Moreover, GaPt/S-1 catalyst was also synthesized by a simple impregnation method (presented in Supplementary Material).
2.2. Catalysts characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out on a Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer (Cu-Kα, 40 mA, λ = 0.15418 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of the samples were measured on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). For depth-profile analysis, the samples were sputtered in Ar+ for 50 s before the analysis. Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet–visible (UV/vis) spectra of the samples were obtained on a Shimadzu 2450 spectrometer using BaSO4 as white standards. Before the characterization test of XRD, XPS and UV–Vis, the samples were pre-reduced at 550 °C for 0.5 h in H2 and sealed in a sample bottle. N2 adsorption–desorption measurements were performed on a Quantachrome NOVA 2000e sorption analyzer at 77 K. The specific surface area (SBET) was calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, and the pore volume was calculated at P/P0 = 0.99. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images were collected on a Jeol JEM-2800 microscope at 200 kV. Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) was measured on a TA SDT Q600 analyzer with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in flowing air (100 mL min−1). The contents of gallium and platinum were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on a ThermoFisher iCAP7400 instrument. Before analysis, the samples were digested in the mixed solution of aqua regia and H3PO4.
CO chemisorption, propene/ammonia temperature-programed desorption (C3H6-TPD and NH3-TPD) were all performed using a Quantachrome CHEMBET3000 with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). In situ Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of chemisorbed CO and propane on reduced samples were carried out on a BRUKER TENSOR II using a resolution of 4 cm−1. The detailed measurement methods of CO chemisorption, C3H6-TPD, NH3-TPD and in situ FTIR spectra of chemisorbed CO and propane are described in the Supplementary Material.
2.3. Catalytic PDH evaluation
PDH tests were carried out in a quartzose fixed-bed (5 mm in inner diameter) at atmospheric pressure. In a typical experiment, all samples were compressed into tablets, crushed, and then sieved to a particle size of 0.3–0.5 mm. Afterward, 0.10 g of catalyst was loaded into the isothermal zone of the reactor using two quartz wool plugs. The reactants (C3H8:N2 = 1:19, 20 mL min−1) were passed through the catalyst bed, and then the reactor was heated to the target temperature and held for 15 min. The reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (SP-6890), which was equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The C3H8 conversion and the selectivity to C3H6 were defined by the following equations based on a carbon atom balance method:

The turnover rate and propene formation rate were calculated as follows:

The absence of external and internal mass transfer limitations was checked following standard experimental criteria by changing the flow rate of C3H8 and Pt content of GaPt@S-1 catalysts [39]. The initial activity correlates linearly with the WHSV−1, and the intersection of the fitting line with Y-axis is zero (Fig. S1a), which suggests that the influence of external transport can be neglected. Moreover, similar propene formation rates are obtained over GaPt@S-1 catalysts with different exposed Pt content (Table S1 and Fig. S1b), indicating the absence of internal diffusion limitations. Therefore, we ensure that the experiments are carried out in the proper kinetically-controlled regime.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Material synthesis and characterization
The whole synthesis process of GaPt@S-1 catalyst is shown in Scheme 1. First, the Ga and Pt complexes interact with the initial zeolitic gel through electrostatic interaction, being wrapped into the framework of zeolite during the crystallization process. Next, the ultra-small Ga-Pt bimetallic nanoclusters can be ultimately confined into the S-1 zeolites after the reduction in H2 at 600 °C. The ligand-protected direct H2 reduction method can significantly lead to small metal species with atomic dispersion, in which the templates and organic ligands can act as protective agents to prevent the aggregation of metal species during the reduction process. For comparison, the monometallic Pt@S-1 and Ga@S-1 catalysts were also prepared through the similar procedure. The Pt and Ga contents of the samples were measured by ICP-OES, and the results are shown in Table S2 and Table S3. The Ga and Pt contents of 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 are 0.82 and 0.092 wt%, respectively.

3.1.1. Compositional and structural information
The XRD patterns of as-prepared catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. All the synthesized samples exhibit typical diffraction peaks of MFI zeolites, demonstrating that the MFI structure is maintained during the synthesis (Fig. 1a) [40]. No peaks attributed to the crystal structure of platinum and gallium are found, indicating that there are no large metal particles in the prepared catalysts. Notably, the peak corresponding to GaPt alloys can be observed in 9Ga0.6Pt@S-1, indicating that GaPt alloys are formed through in situ synthesis (Fig. 1b) [41].

XPS experiments were carried out to analyze the atomic composition and the state of each component in the bimetallic catalysts. In the conventional Pt 4f spectrum of 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst, no XPS signals are observed. However, after depth profile, Pt 4f5/2 peak at 71.6 eV and Pt 4f7/2 peak at 74.5 eV corresponding to the typical zero-valent Pt are detected in 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst (Fig. 2a), confirming that the Pt clusters are completely encaged inside S-1 zeolites [37]. Notably, a small shift of binding energies in Pt 4f core levels to the higher binding energies for 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 (71.6 eV) can be found compared with 0.1Pt@S-1 (71.2 eV). The higher electron binding energy may be ascribed to the formation of GaPt alloy during the reduction process, which was further investigated by examining the Ga 2p spectra [41], [42], [43], [44]. In the Ga 2p XPS spectrum of 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 (Fig. 2b), it can be fitted with two peaks at 1118.7 and 1117.9 eV, corresponding to the isolated GaIII sites and reduced Gaδ+, respectively [23], [44]. Thus it can be proposed that 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst contains GaPt alloy nanoclusters as well as a part of isolated GaIII sites.

Direct investigations on the existing states of Ga species in the Ga@S-1 and GaPt@S-1 catalysts were studied by UV–vis spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. S2, the UV–vis spectrum of S-1 is considered as reference. The 1.5Ga@S-1 and 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 samples show similar absorption bands at 210 nm. This band is ascribed to the charge transfer transition of Ga coordinated with O2−, which is the characteristic of the isolated tetra-coordinated Ga atoms [45]. With the introduction of Pt in the catalyst (1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1), it can be observed that the signal intensity is lower than that of 1.5Ga@S-1, which further illustrates the successful formation of GaPt alloy. In addition, no absorption bands over 350 nm are found in the spectra of all the samples, demonstrating that no bulk Ga2O3 is formed [46], which is consistent with the results of XRD (Fig. 1) and XPS (Fig. 2).
3.1.2. Morphology and textural property
The textural properties of the prepared samples were measured by N2 adsorption–desorption sorption technique (Fig. S3 and Table S2). The isotherms of type I are observed, which are typical characteristics of microporous materials [47], [48]. For metal-containing S-1 zeolite, the slight decreases in pore volume and BET surface area compared with those of S-1 zeolite are due to the occupation of metal species in the S-1 zeolite channels, in consistent with the results of XPS. Still, the metal-containing S-1 zeolites have adequate space to ensure the sufficient diffusion of the reactant (Table S2).
The morphology of the Ga-based catalysts was characterized by TEM. As shown in Fig. 3a–c, no metal particles can be seen in 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1, indicating that Pt and Ga species are well dispersed throughout the whole S-1 zeolite. However, some large nanoclusters with ~ 5.45 nm can be observed in 1.5Ga0.1Pt/S-1 catalyst (Fig. 3d and e inset). The corresponding EDS mapping images indicate that the Pt and Ga species are located at almost the same positions, suggesting the formation of Ga-Pt bimetallic particles (Fig. 3f). To further test the dispersion of Pt species, CO chemisorption experiments were performed (Table S2). Platinum dispersion of 0.1Pt@S-1, 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 and 1.5Ga0.1Pt/S-1 catalysts are 41%, 60% and 31%, respectively. Notably, the dispersion of platinum increases obviously when both gallium and platinum exist, specially prepared by hydrothermal treatment and subsequent ligand-protected direct H2 reduction method. It is shown that the in situ confinement of nanoclusters in S-1 zeolites can effectively restrain the growth of nanoclusters, thus forming ultra-small diameter and highly dispersed Ga-Pt bimetallic nanoclusters within S-1 zeolites, in agreement with the XRD results in Fig. 1.

3.2. Catalytic performance
The catalytic performance of the prepared catalysts is shown in Fig. 4. Pt@S-1 and Ga@S-1 catalysts exhibit unsatisfactory catalytic performance with low propane conversions of 22.2% and 15.9%, respectively. The physical mixture of Pt@S-1 and Ga@S-1 catalyst prepared by grinding the above two samples in equal amounts also shows low propane conversion of 20.7% (Fig. S4). While for GaPt@S-1 catalyst, the initial propane conversion is up to 45.9% (20.5 mol g−1Pt h−1) with high selectivity toward propene of 92.1% at the beginning of the reaction (Fig. 4a). The propane conversion of GaPt@S-1 is lower than equilibrium conversion (87.5%) (Fig. S5), confirming the propane conversion is not inhibited by products under the high temperature reaction condition of 600 °C. On the other hand, GaPt@S-1 catalyst shows the highest propene selectivity (96%) than Ga@S-1 and Pt@S-1 catalysts at the same propane conversion (15%) in Fig. 4b. It is clearly shown that the formation of GaPt alloy can significantly improve dehydrogenation activity and selectivity.

(c) The catalytic performances of the GaPt@S-1catalysts with a fixed amount of Pt (0.1 wt%) and increasing content of Ga (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 wt%). (d) The catalytic performances of the GaPt@S-1 catalysts with a fixed amount of Ga (1.5 wt%) and decreasing the content of Pt (0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08 and 0.1 wt%). Reaction conditions: 600 °C (a, c and d), 100 mg catalysts, atmospheric pressure, WHSVpropane = 0.65 h−1 and C3H8:N2 = 1:19 with a flow rate of 20 mL min−1.
The effects of Ga and Pt loadings on the catalytic performance of GaPt@S-1 catalysts were investigated, and the loadings of Ga and Pt were defined by ICP-OES (Table S3). The Ga loadings of GaPt@S-1 catalysts have an important influence on PDH reaction (Fig. 4c). When the Pt weight loading is 0.1%, the optimal loading of Ga is 1.5 wt%. Furthermore, keeping the loading of Ga (1.5 wt%) invariant while the loading of Pt decreasing from 0.1 to 0.02 wt%, the dehydrogenation activity of GaPt@S-1 shows a linear relationship with the platinum content (Fig. 4d). Moreover, the intersection of the fitting line and Y-axis is not zero because the Ga species retained in the S-1 zeolite possess weak catalytic ability [49].
In order to reliably compare the catalytic rate and identify active metals, it is necessary to normalize the conversion rate by the TOR. As shown in Table 1, the TOR of monometallic Pt is much higher than that of monometallic Ga, and the TORs of the bimetallic catalysts based on Pt are very similar to that of monometallic Pt. In addition, the TORs based on (bimetallic) Ga are much higher than that of monometallic Ga. Therefore, the TORs indicate that Pt is the active site for PDH.

Catalytic stability and recyclability are essential for industrial applications. The stability of 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 was investigated (Fig. 5a). During 24 h PDH, the conversion of propane only decreases from 45.9% to 41.5%. To test the recycling stability of 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst at 600 °C, the spent 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst was regenerated by the treatment in air at 500 °C for 0.5 h and then in H2 at 500 °C for 0.5 h, followed by the next catalytic PDH investigation. It is shown that the high propane conversion of the catalyst can be kept during four cycles (Fig. 5b). A first-order deactivation model used to estimate catalytic stability is displayed in Fig. 5c and Table S4. A lower deactivation constant of 0.0068 h−1 and a higher specific activity of 0.027 s−1 for the 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst quantitatively demonstrate its higher stability and dehydrogenation activity when compared to the 1.5Ga@S-1 catalyst (0.0164 h−1, 0.0058 s−1). In addition, the deactivation constant of 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst is much lower than that of the conventional Ga-based catalysts.

According to the results of characterization and catalytic performance, the active sites of the Ga@S-1 and GaPt@S-1 catalysts for PDH are summarized in Scheme 2. The π-electrons of olefins are difficult to dissociate from Ga-based catalyst, leading to the cleavage of CC bonds [31], which greatly decreases the catalytic performance, thus showing low activity and propene selectivity (Fig. 4a, b). After the introduction of trace Pt, ultra-small GaPt alloy nanoclusters as well as a part of isolated tetrahedral coordination of Ga species are formed in GaPt@S-1 catalyst. The remaining isolated tetrahedral Ga sites of GaPt@S-1 catalyst can stabilize these GaPt alloy nanoclusters [44]. The confined GaPt alloy nanoclusters of GaPt@S-1 catalyst are responsible for PDH reaction and obtains excellent catalytic performance (Fig. 5 and Table 1). The high electron density of GaPt alloy nanoclusters could contribute to desorption of products, which will be discussed in detail in the following section.

3.3. Electronic effects of alloying in GaPt@S-1 catalyst
It has been demonstrated that doping of Pt with certain elements is helpful to the desorption of hydrogen and propene, thereby improving the catalytic stability and selectivity of propene [28], [29], [31], [50]. Considering the high cost of platinum, it is always advisable to reduce the content of platinum in the catalyst. Herein, Ga-Pt bimetallic catalyst was prepared via a facile ligand-protected direct H2-reduction method. As shown in Fig. 2, the formation of GaPt alloy affects the XPS spectra of Pt and results in an edge shift toward higher energy, which is consistent with electron transfer from Ga to the platinum 5d band [41], [42], [43], [44]. The electronic environment nearby Pt species was further studied by the FT-IR spectra of the CO adsorption (Fig. 6a). No evident adsorption peak in Ga@S-1 was detected, suggesting that the CO adsorption occurred on the Pt species. The adsorbed CO on 0.1Pt@S-1 exhibits a broad peak, which is assigned to linear adsorption on the metallic platinum surface. The linear adsorption peak of 0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst can be divided into two peaks. The higher energy band near 2037 cm−1 is related to the linear CO binding on the coordinatively saturated terraces or planes, while the band near 2000 cm−1 is attributed to the CO adsorption on the coordinatively unsaturated corners or steps [7], [51], [52]. Compared with 0.1Pt@S-1, these CO adsorption peaks are red-shifted to 2022 and 1995 cm−1 for 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1, which strongly suggests a higher surface electron density over the platinum atoms because of the electron donation from the Ga species. The modification of electronic structure in GaPt@S-1 is consistent with XPS results showing a more electron-rich Pt surface.

To verify the influence on propene desorption caused by the electronic effects of GaPt alloy in GaPt@S-1 catalyst, the C3H6-TPD experiments were carried out. No obvious desorption propylene signal can be detected in S-1 (Fig. S6), which eliminates the influence of S-1 on propylene adsorption. 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 shows a lower propene desorbed signal than that of 1.5Ga@S-1 catalyst, revealing that there is a weak interaction between propylene and 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst (Fig. 6b). Besides, the desorption peak of propene over 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst shifts to a lower temperature (245 °C) when compared to 1.5Ga@S-1 catalyst (261 °C). It seems that the electronic effects of GaPt alloy in 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst tend to reduce the interaction between propene and catalyst, thereby reducing the adsorption capacity of propene [52].
To further certify the influence on propene desorption caused by the electronic effects of GaPt alloy in GaPt@S-1 catalyst for PDH, in situ FTIR experiments of PDH over the reduced 1.5Ga@S-1 and 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalysts were performed. As shown in Fig. 7a, a strong band appears below 1500 cm−1 due to the CH vibration, suggesting that propane participated in the reaction on these catalysts. Meanwhile, the bands at 2965, 1850 and 1580 cm−1 assigned to propane, propene and carbon species, respectively, are also detected, demonstrating that propene has been formed at 350 °C [53]. After the evacuation at 350 °C for 30 min, the bands attributed to products and carbon species disappear in 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst, while these bands are still detected in 1.5Ga@S-1 catalyst (Fig. 7b). These data further confirm the coke resistance of the 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1, compared with the 1.5Ga@S-1 catalyst. Similar results from theory and experiment have been reported for other bimetallic dehydrogenation catalysts such as Pt3M and PtM intermetallic alloys containing Sn, Zn, Co, Mn, Cr and Cu [5], [6], [29], [30], [54], [55].

A schematic model related to the electronic effects of 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst on PDH catalytic reaction is proposed. As shown in Scheme 3, GaPt alloy nanoclusters along with a part of Ga(III) species are highly dispersed inside the channels of S-1 zeolites after reduction at 600 °C. Subsequently, the Pt atoms obtain a great deal of negative charge from the Ga species. The increase of platinum atomic electron density in GaPt alloys hinders the adsorption of products on metal surfaces, and also contributes to the migration of coke and coke precursors from active sites to external channels. Thus it can be concluded that the electronic effects of GaPt alloy in GaPt@S-1 catalyst could contribute to the migration of products from active sites to external channels, and quickly release the active sites to activate CH bond of propane that serves the key step of PDH reaction, thereby achieving the high propene selectivity (92.1%, Fig. 4a, b). In addition, the isolated tetrahedral Ga sites could also facilitate the dissociation of H2 [44], [56]. As expected, this catalyst exhibits a high propene selectivity of 92.1% and propylene formation rate of 20.5 mol g−1Pt h−1 at 600 °C, and the propane conversion only drops a little after 24 h on stream at 600 °C, affording an extremely low deactivation constant of 0.0068 h−1, which is much lower than that of the conventional Ga-based catalysts (Fig. 5c).

3.4. Acidic properties of the selected catalysts
The acidic properties of samples were measured by the means of NH3-TPD. As shown in Fig. 8a, a weak signal at 190 °C occurs in the NH3-TPD curve of all samples, which can be ascribed to the sites where ammonia is physisorbed and weakly held [20], [57]. For 1.5Ga@S-1 catalyst, a weak new signal corresponding to the Lewis sites appears at 400 °C, which is ascribed to Ga-OH groups at the outer surface of zeolite [19]. After the Pt introduction, the weak signal at 400 °C decreases obviously. Specifically, the concentration of acid sites drops from 0.25 mmolNH3/g in 1.5Ga@S-1 to 0.21 mmolNH3/g in 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1, probably due to the formation of GaPt alloy nanoclusters. The GaPt@S-1 catalysts with weak acid could improve the propene selectivity and anti-coking capability during PDH [58].

To quantify the coke content, the TGA experiments of 1.5Ga@S-1 and 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalysts were carried out. As shown in Fig. 8b, both of which show two weight loss steps in the temperature range of 30–250 °C and 250–500 °C, ascribed to the physically adsorbed water and coke combustion, respectively [53]. The weight loss of 1.5Ga@S-1 catalyst is 0.85% after 5 h time on stream. While 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst after 20 h time on stream only has a weight loss of 0.43%. It can be concluded that the 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst with weak acidity has strong anti-coking ability during PDH, which is consistent with its excellent propene selectivity (92.1%, Fig. 4a) and catalytic stability (Fig. 5).
3.5. Confinement effect of S-1 zeolites
In this work, 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 prepared via a facile ligand-protected direct H2-reduction method catalyst showed excellent thermal stability and cyclic stability (Fig. 5a, b). The spent catalysts after 24 h on stream were characterized to clarify the relationship between the improved catalytic performance and the structure of 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1. CO chemisorption measurement for the spent 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst exhibits that Ga-Pt bimetallic nanoclusters are still highly dispersed in S-1 zeolites, demonstrating the high dispersion of Pt in 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst is well maintained during PDH reaction (Table S2). In addition, the morphology, crystallinity as well as the metal loading amount of 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst almost remain unchanged (Table S2 and Fig. S7). Combined with the stability measurement experiment and characterization results of spent catalyst, it can be confirmed that the crystalline nanoporous structure of silicalite-1 zeolite can act as powerful hosts, encapsulating nanoclusters in the internal void nanospaces, and inhibiting its further growth and agglomeration.
4. Conclusions
This work reports a highly stable and selective catalyst (GaPt@S-1), in which well distributed and ultra-small GaPt alloy nanoclusters along with a part of isolated tetrahedral Ga sites are highly dispersed inside S-1 zeolites. The GaPt@S-1 catalyst exhibits remarkable catalytic performance with a high propene selectivity of 92.1% and propane dehydrogenation rate of 20.5 mol g−1Pt h−1 (corresponding to 45.9% propane conversion) at 600 °C. Moreover, no obvious deactivation was observed over GaPt@S-1 catalyst even after 24 h on stream. It is indicated that the electronic effects of GaPt alloys in 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst have a profound impact on the catalytic performance of PDH. Moreover, the GaPt@S-1 catalyst with weak acidity possesses strong anti-coking capability. Overall, the 1.5Ga0.1Pt@S-1 catalyst is much more inexpensive than Pt-based PDH catalysts, and simultaneously, it is more stable than conventional Ga-based catalysts. This work may provide enlightenment for the development of other metal-based catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation process.
