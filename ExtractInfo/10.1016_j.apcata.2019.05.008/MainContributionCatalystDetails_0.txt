 Based on the details provided in the document, this does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene, not propane to propylene. Therefore, I have indicated that the document is not relevant and have not included any specifics on catalyst details or performance enhancements.
