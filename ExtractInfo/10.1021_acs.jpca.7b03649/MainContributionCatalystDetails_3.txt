 Unfortunately, the provided document does not seem to discuss propane dehydrogenation or any related process to convert propane to propylene. The document focuses on modeling thermodynamic properties of aqueous electrolyte solutions. As such, I do not have relevant information to extract about propane dehydrogenation catalysts or process enhancements.
