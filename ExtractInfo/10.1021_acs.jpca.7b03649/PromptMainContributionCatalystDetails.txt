Isotherm-Based Thermodynamic Model for Solute Activities of Asymmetric Electrolyte Aqueous Solutions
Abstract
Adsorption isotherm-based statistical thermodynamic models can be used to determine solute concentration and solute and solvent activities in aqueous solutions. Recently, the number of adjustable parameters in the isotherm model of Dutcher et al. J. Phys. Chem. A/C 2011, 2012, 2013 were reduced for neutral solutes as well as symmetric 1:1 electrolytes by using a Coulombic model to describe the solute–solvent energy interactions (Ohm et al. J. Phys. Chem. A 2015, Nandy et al. J. Phys. Chem. A 2016). Here, the Coulombic treatment for symmetric electrolytes is extended to establish improved isotherm model equations for asymmetric 1–2 and 1–3 electrolyte systems. The Coulombic model developed here results in prediction of activities and other thermodynamic properties in multicomponent systems containing ions of arbitrary charge. The model is found to accurately calculate the osmotic coefficient over the entire solute concentration range with two model parameters, related to intermolecular solute–solute and solute–solvent spacing. The inorganic salts and acids treated here are generally considered to be fully dissociated. However, there are certain weak acids that do not dissociate completely, such as the bisulfate ion. In this work, partial dissociation of the bisulfate ion from sulfuric acid is treated as a mixture, with an additional model parameter that accounts for the dissociation ratio of the dissociated ions to nondissociated ions.

Key aqueous solution properties such as surface tension, vapor pressure, critical supersaturation, and freezing point depend upon the type and concentration of solute molecules. For example, aqueous atmospheric aerosol particles containing a wide range of both organic compounds and inorganic salts (1) can undergo liquid–liquid phase separation into an organic rich and organic poor phases, (2) depending on the type of the solutes and the temperature and relative humidity conditions. To predict the phase behavior as well as partitioning within atmospheric aerosols, predictions of the thermodynamic equilibrium state (3) of the particle, including its solute concentrations, and osmotic and activity coefficients at a given ambient temperature and relative humidity, is required. Predictive models for these bulk scale thermodynamic properties are governed by the molecular scale interactions of the organic, inorganic, and water molecules.
Recently, adsorption isotherm models using statistical mechanics were used to model thermodynamic properties of solutions with very low water content. In this framework, solutes were the adsorbents, which were “hydrated” by waters in multilayer lattice formation. (4, 5) The framework consisted of two main energetic interaction terms: long-range Debye–Hückel and short-range adsorption. Debye–Hückel theory describes nonideal behavior by the Coulomb potential of the hard charged spherical ions in a continuous dielectric medium, such as water. (6) It is also used in other available thermodynamic models for the Gibb’s energy (7, 8) consisting of the excess Gibbs Margules expansion for short-range forces and Debye–Hückel terms, which successfully predict water activity of inorganic aqueous electrolyte solutions. In the adsorption isotherm model, however, the short-range adsorption interaction is used, versus a more empirical Margules expansion. For the adsorption treatment, an associated energy parameter for each sorption layer was initially determined by an empirical power law model (for various electrolytes, organics, and mixtures), (9) and then by a more accurate short-range Coulombic interactions model (for symmetric 1–1 electrolytes and various organics), (10) reducing the number of model parameters. The advantage of the Coulombic model is that it provides physical interpretations of the model parameters. Recently, the Coulombic interactions model for organic acids that partially dissociate into 1–1 electrolyte was used to represent activity coefficients and solute concentrations by treating the acids as a mixture of electrolyte and a neutral nondissociated organic. (11)
The recently developed Coulombic isotherm model, when applied to salts, only treated symmetric 1–1 aqueous electrolyte solutions. However, ions common to atmospheric aerosols (12) as well as water treatment (13) and desalination (14, 15) include mixtures of both symmetric and asymmetric electrolytes. The difference in valency is important, as it produces a different effect on aqueous solutions in a variety of applications from sea salt aerosols, soil permeability, wastewater treatment, rheology, drug delivery, and industrial discharge. For example, it has been shown in a study on hygroscopic behavior (16) that NaCl–MgCl2 mixture aerosol particles from sea salt particles can maintain an aqueous phase over a wider relative humidity range than the pure NaCl particles, and hence will be more susceptible to aqueous heterogeneous reactions with the gas phase. Even at very low relative humidities, Mg2+ will more readily remain in the aqueous phase having a high surface tension and viscosity than those of NaCl that crystallizes at a higher relative humidity. In a study on nanoparticles from industrial discharges and disposal of wastewater treatment effluents, (17) it is shown that the presence of divalent cations promote destabilization of TiO2 nanoparticles in aqueous solutions, which then enter natural aquatic systems and form agglomerates. (17) Finally, soil permeability studies suggest improvements in water permeability when divalent calcium and magnesium ions are in excess compared to monovalent sodium and potassium ions, due to enhanced soil flocculation, and resulting enlarged porous chemical size, in the presence of higher valency ions. (18)
In addition, crustal species like Ca2+ and Mg2+ may be in thermodynamic equilibrium with atmospheric gases as they are a major component of ambient particles from significant dust sources. (19) The SCAPE2 gas–particle equilibrium model introduced these water-soluble ions that affect aerosol chemistry in dusty regions for accurate estimation of the gas–aerosol equilibrium. (20) A considerable amount of the alkaline elements (Ca and Mg) is in the form of carbonate. Hence, the gas–aerosol equilibrium models need to incorporate carbonate and bicarbonate salts as well. (21) A size-resolved equilibrium model like SELIQUID for treating crustal species assuming equivalent concentrations of sodium has been developed, (22) although it introduces errors when concentrations of these species are high. Other studies have showed that gas–aerosol partitioning of volatile or semivolatile aerosol compounds are influenced by the concentration levels of alkaline cations. (23) Because partition prediction considering these materials is important, ISORROPIA II was introduced that could add the thermodynamics of the Ca2+, Mg2+, and SO42– aerosol systems in addition to monovalent species. (24)
In this work, the Coulombic model has been extended to calculate thermodynamic properties of asymmetric (1–2 and 1–3) aqueous electrolyte solutions over the entire concentration range at 298.15 K. The compounds studied include Al3+, Cr3+, Co2+, Cu2+, Mn2+, Ni2+, Ba2+, Sr2+, Na+, K+, H+, Li+, NH4+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl–, Br–, I–, SO42–, NO3–, HSO4–, PO43–, CO32–. Partial dissociation of the weak acid bisulfate ion is also considered by treating the system as a mixture of dissociated ions and nondissociated bisulfate ion. Although sulfuric acid is a strong acid, the bisulfate ion dissociates partially. Several studies have considered partial dissociation of electrolytes in their model. Activity coefficients have been derived using excess Gibb’s energy from infinite dilution in solvent to electrolyte saturation, where both long-range and short-range interactions have been considered to account for partial dissociation into ions at high electrolyte concentrations. (25) The aqueous electrolyte nonrandom two-liquid (NRTL) model is used to represent ionic activity coefficients for study of partial dissociation of weak electrolytes. (26) A recent model predicts thermodynamic and volumetric properties of a partially ionized aqueous electrolyte along with estimation of degree of dissociation at varying concentrations. (27) This approach has applications in the hydrothermal and geothermal processes where understanding of electrolyte solution concentrations at high temperatures is required. The model can predict properties in a wide range of temperatures, pressures, and concentrations to represent nonidealities of aqueous electrolyte solutions. However, the model has more limited accuracy for some systems at very high electrolyte concentrations, which could be especially important for atmospheric aerosols.
The present work successfully makes accurate model calculations of thermodynamic properties for the entire range of electrolyte aqueous solution concentrations containing ions of arbitrary charge. The development of the model treatment for the energy parameters with asymmetric electrolytes is given in section 2. Resultant parametrizations in sections 3 and 4 shed new insights on interactions between solute and solvent, and between partially dissociated and nondissociated ions.

Solution molality and solute activity are determined by previous models using lattice adsorption isotherm-based statistical mechanics and long-range electrostatic interactions. (4, 5, 9) The model can incorporate an arbitrary number of hydrated layers, each characterized by a sorption energy parameter that is determined by a power-law empirical relationship. (9) The short-range sorption energy parameter Cj,i is given by
(1)
where j is the solute, i is the hydration layer, μj is the dipole moment of solute j, μw = 2.9, rww = 2.82 × 10–10m, εo is the permittivity of space, 4πεo = 1.113 × 10–10 C2 N–1 m–2, D is a unit of conversion (Debye), D = 3.33564 × 10–30 C m, rjw is the intermolecular distance between solute j and solvent w (here water), k = 1.38 × 10–23 J K–1 (Boltzmann’s constant), and T is temperature. We assume that all molecules, both solute and solvent are modeled as apparent dipoles and that the adsorbed species is a ternary cation–water–anion cluster. We also assume that the sorption energies are due to short-range dipole–dipole electrostatic forces at the molecular level. (10)
Here, for a 1–2 or 1–3 electrolyte, the apparent dipole moment is calculated by considering the electrolyte as a solvent-separated ion cluster, given by
(2)
where q is the charge, the valency of each side of the cluster separated by a characteristic intermolecular distance r. In the case of 1–2 electrolytes q has a value of 2, and for 1–3 electrolytes it has a value of 3, e is the elementary charge, e = 1.60218 × 10–19 C. For example, a 1–2 electrolyte may have two single-charged cations (2 Na+) and a double-charged anion (SO42–); so q will be 2. The characteristic cluster distance r is related to rjw by the following expression
(3)
r is obtained by assuming different ionic geometry for the 1–2 and 1–3 electrolytes as shown in Figure 1a,b, respectively, and is related to the total center-to-center distance between the ions, a = rjj + rj+ + rj–. rjj is the interspatial distance between cation and anion, and rj+ and rj– are the effective radii of the cation and anion, respectively. Note that rjj represents the distance between ions, r represents the distance between center of ion cluster and water, and rjw represents the center-to-center distance between solute and water.

Figure 1. (a) Schematic of a solute–solvent lattice model spacing for a 1–2 electrolyte (2 single-charged cations + 1 double-charged anion or 1 double-charged cation + 2 single-charged anions). The solute is assumed to have ions arranged by an equilateral triangle of side “a” = rjj + rj+ + rj–. Height of the triangle = = [rjj + rj+ + rj–], and therefore, rjw = r + and μj = r where q = 2. (b) Schematic of a solute–solvent lattice model spacing for a 1–3 electrolyte (3 cations + 1 anion or 1 cation + 3 anions). The solute is assumed to have ions arranged by a regular tetrahedron of side “a” = rjj + rj+ + rj–. Height of the tetrahedron = = [rjj + rj+ + rj–], and therefore, rjw = r + and μj = r where q = 3.
To apply this framework to the model, once the energy parameters (eq 1) are determined for our system, we use the same governing equations for asymmetric electrolytes as we did for symmetric (1–1) electrolytes (eqs 27 and 28 of Dutcher et al. 2013). (9) The equations, given below as eqs 4 and 5, give the solution molality and the solute activity of j in a pure aqueous solution at water activity of the mixture, a̅w normalized by long-range Debye–Hückel term.

(5)
where Mw (kg mol–1) is the molecular weight of the solvent (water), vj is the stoichiometric coefficient of solute j. It is the number of moles of ions formed from 1 mol of fully dissociated solute j. For a multicomponent system with arbitrary number of solutes, the molality mj in the mixture can be found by using the following mixing model. (9)

3 Model Parametrization and Results
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The thermodynamic modeling has been applied to thirty-eight 1–2 electrolytes and five 1–3 electrolytes, to determine osmotic and activity coefficients in aqueous solutions at 298.15 K. Incorporating eqs 1 and 4 in the asymmetric electrolyte model, there are four unknown model parameters ρ, nj, rjw, and μj, where nj is the number of hydration layers and ρ is a fitting parameter. (10) Treating nj as a constant, the number of fit parameters are three. Finally, employing eqs 2 and 3 for μj and rjw respectively, the number of parameters are reduced to two, i.e., ρ, and rjj. Special treatment for sulfate and bisulfate ions are given in the next section.
The results of two- and three-parameter fitting are given in Tables 1 and 2 for 1–2 electrolytes, and in Tables 3 and 4 for 1–3 electrolytes, respectively. For the two-parameter model (Tables 1 and 3), the parameters ρ and rjj are fit to data. For the three-parameter model (Tables 2 and 4), the parameters ρ, rjj, and μj are fit to data, whereas rjw is calculated by using eq 3. The accuracy of the fitting model was calculated using a normalized mean square error (MSE), and the tables show the MSEs and the data sources. It should be noted that in Table 2, a negative rjj resulted for H2SO4 and (NH4)2SO4, possibly due to the physical arrangement of the molecular ions suggesting overlap. Also, note that Li2SO4 and K3PO4 did not yield reasonable fits with the three-parameter model approach. Figure 2 (a and b) shows plots of calculated osmotic coefficients by two-parameter fitting and three-parameter fitting, respectively, with experimental literature data for family of bromides of divalent cations over the entire concentration range. Note that though both the models fit well with BaBr2 data, they have peaks in osmotic coefficient at different concentrations. The bromide family of curves is representative of the accuracy of the model calculations of 1–2 electrolytes with univalent anions; complete plots of chlorides, iodides, and nitrates are shown in Supporting Information (Figures S1–S3) for both two- and three-parameter fitting models.

Figure 3 shows results of the model calculations for magnesium electrolytes with univalent anions, which, like bromide, is also representative of other systems of 1–2 and 2–1 electrolytes. Complete plots of the calcium family with univalent anions, and the sulfate family with univalent cations are shown in the Supporting Information (Figures S4 and S5) for both two- and three-parameter fitting models. It is seen that the calculated osmotic coefficients of sulfuric acid do not follow the trend of available data, and hence sulfuric acid has been treated separately in section 4. Figure 4 shows results for 1–3 electrolytes containing trivalent ions of aluminum, chromium, and phosphate. There is agreement between the model calculations and the experimental data for all 1–2 and 1–3 solutes except sulfuric acid due to partial dissociation of the bisulfate ion. The model calculations by the three-parameter fit are seen to be improved, and μj can be related to rjj by the following equation by power fit as shown in Figure 5 for 1–2 electrolytes.

The adsorption isotherm model framework is based on the mole fraction with a pure solute reference state. However, it is essential to mention that the model can be analytically recast (9) to a molality basis with an infinite dilution reference state that is more standard for some fields. Additionally, model calculations for solute activity coefficients at infinite dilution reference state on a molality basis are comparable to the RMSE of the model calculations for osmotic coefficient as shown here.
4 Treatment of Sulfuric Acid
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Sulfuric acid is known as a strong acid (first ionization) completely dissociating in aqueous solution with pKa (−log10 Ka) = −3 (dissociation constant, Ka > 1), and the bisulfate ion is known as a weak acid (second ionization) at 298.15 K because it does not dissociate completely and has a pKa value of 1.92 (Ka < 1). (29) The dissociation of H2SO4 is described below as two steps, where step I is the total dissociation and step II is the partial dissociation. Hence, our model can treat aqueous H2SO4 solution by considering it a mixture of two electrolytes (similar to treating a partially dissociated dicarboxylic acid as a mixture of an electrolyte and an organic in Nandy et al. (11)).
(I)
(II)
Moreover, there is an additional parameter that accounts for the ratio of dissociated ions to nondissociated acid ion, defined as the dissociation ratio, β. It is a parameter that indicates the dissociated to nondissociated solute ratio, i.e., the ratio of 1–2 electrolyte (SO42– + 2H+) to 1–1 electrolyte (HSO4– + H+), and is known to be a function of the concentrations of both solutes. However, for simplicity, β is treated as a fixed adjustable parameter. Note that the van’t Hoff factor (i), often related to the degree of dissociation for osmotic coefficients, depends on the degree of dissociation and is related to β by the following equation.
(8)
where n = number of dissociated ions.
Because the solute is treated as a mixture, for a given β, there are originally four parameters: ρ and rjj for each electrolyte, i.e., rjj,BS, rjj,S, ρBS, ρS, where subscripts BS and S stand for bisulfate and sulfate, respectively. μj and rjw for each electrolyte are calculated using eqs 2 and 3. Results for six values of β for the four-parameter fit are provided in Figure S6a. Poor agreements were found for β < 0.3 and β ≥ 0.8, and the model calculated unrealistic parameter values for β < 0.1. The model agreed reasonably well at β = 0.5 and 0.55, with an optimal value at β = 0.55. Interestingly, it was observed that the value of ρ for each electrolyte is approximately the same (from Table 5). Therefore, by fitting only ρS and equating that to ρBS, the number of parameters could be reduced to three, i.e., rjj for each electrolyte and ρS parameter. Figure S6b shows the fitting plots for all six values of β for the three-parameter fit, with only a marginal change in MSE compared to the four-parameter model. Again, the most agreeable fitting plot was found for 0.55 dissociation ratio.

Finally, the parameter ρ was related to the hard-core collision radius of the solute: (28)

where a is the hard-core collision radius, e is the electronic charge, NA is Avogadro’s number, d1 is the density of the solvent, M1 is the molecular weight of the solvent, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, D is the dielectric constant (relative permittivity) of the solvent, k is Boltzmann’s constant, and T is the temperature. The collision radius was assumed to be rjw for each electrolyte, (11) thereby further reducing the number of parameters to two with modest accuracy. For example, rjj could be fit for each electrolyte and both ρ values could be calculated using eq 9. Figure S6c represents the fitting plots for varying β for the two-parameter fit showing a modest agreement for solute ratio 0.55. Though the parameters do not vary significantly (Table 5), the mean square error for the two-parameter fitting model is the highest. Results of the best fit at β = 0.55 are shown in Figure 6 for each four-, three-, and two-parameter model. Here, the mixture treatment of sulfuric acid resulted in an improvement at higher concentrations over the three-parameter fit of Figure S5b (model with total dissociation). Note that the dissociated solute is treated as a solvent-separated ion cluster, whereas the nondissociated solute is treated as a molecular salt.

5 Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The electrostatic solute–solvent interaction model has been used to develop a solution thermodynamic model for accurate calculations of osmotic coefficients for a wide range of binary electrolyte solutions over the entire concentration range. The number of model parameters is reduced to two by relating two of the parameters to the intermolecular spacing. This work calculates the energy of adsorption by parametrizing the ion–solvent and solvent–solvent bond length that represent physical structure properties. Although the intermolecular distances are fitted here, the model has potential to be fully predictive for solutes for which intermolecular spacing is known. With the known parameter values, activities can be calculated for multisolute systems.
The model works well for all the 1–2 and 1–3 electrolytes explored here, except for sulfuric acid due to two-step dissociation, allowing for inter- and extrapolation of calculations for concentrations and mixtures where data are not available. Taking partial dissociation of the bisulfate ion into account, the trends of osmotic coefficient could be well-captured with a mixture treatment of dissociated acid and nondissociated acid as a result of partial dissociation. Although the model here is developed for temperatures at 298.15 K only, it can potentially be developed for other temperatures that represent a wide range in the atmosphere. This may be done by taking into account the explicit temperature dependence in the energy parameter equation as well as in the Debye–Hückel ρ parameter equation.

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. (a) Schematic of a solute–solvent lattice model spacing for a 1–2 electrolyte (2 single-charged cations + 1 double-charged anion or 1 double-charged cation + 2 single-charged anions). The solute is assumed to have ions arranged by an equilateral triangle of side “a” = rjj + rj+ + rj–. Height of the triangle = = [rjj + rj+ + rj–], and therefore, rjw = r + and μj = r where q = 2. (b) Schematic of a solute–solvent lattice model spacing for a 1–3 electrolyte (3 cations + 1 anion or 1 cation + 3 anions). The solute is assumed to have ions arranged by a regular tetrahedron of side “a” = rjj + rj+ + rj–. Height of the tetrahedron = = [rjj + rj+ + rj–], and therefore, rjw = r + and μj = r where q = 3.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
