Mn/Co bimetallic MOF-derived hexagonal multilayered oxide catalysts with rich interface defects for propane total oxidation: Characterization, catalytic performance and DFT calculation
Several hexagonal layered Mn/Co oxide catalysts were synthesized from Mn/Co-based metal–organic framework (MOF) precursors. The molar ratio of Mn/Co affects the physicochemical properties of catalysts, further affects their catalytic performance. The Mn/CoOx-3/2 sample with wide interlayer spacing exhibited the highest catalytic activity for total oxidation of propane, with a T90 of 270 °C at 120 L g−1 h−1. Low-temperature reducibility, oxygen mobility, water vapor tolerance, and oxygen defects play the key roles for improving catalytic activity. Oxygen defects were calculated using the density functional theory (DFT). The results show that the doping of Mn on Co oxide is conducive to the formation of oxygen vacancies. Therefore, benefiting from the layered structure and metal-doping for the catalysts, the formation of more abundant interfacial defects can further improve the catalytic performance. This study offers a simple way to synthesize regular layered multi-metal oxide, which can expose abundant interface defects and active sites.
1. Introduction
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have vapor pressures greater than 10.3 Pa at room temperature (293.15 K) and standard atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa) [1]. With the rapid development of modern industry, VOCs have become one of the primary air pollutants. They not only cause the generation of photochemical smog and stratospheric ozone destruction but also induce air pollution and directly cause serious harm to human health [2], [3]. VOCs mainly originate from natural and man-made sources, and the vast majority of harmful VOCs originate from transportation, burning of fossil fuels, and man-made emissions from industry and manufacturing. Therefore, the effective prevention and treatment of regional compound pollution caused by VOCs is a major environmental issue faced by the country. Among all the types of VOCs, propane is one of the main light alkanes, which originates from the waste gas emitted by sewage treatment plants of refining and chemical enterprises and from the production and transportation of liquefied petroleum gas [4]. Propane is often used as a model reactant in VOCs research because its molecular structure is relatively stable, so it is difficult to process completely. The elimination of VOCs via catalytic oxidation refers to the redox reaction between the adsorbed waste gas molecules and active oxygen species at the gas–solid interface between the waste gas and catalyst, which generates CO2 and H2O under the drive of heat energy. Catalytic oxidation has a wide range of applications, not only in the treatment of malodorous waste gas containing Cl and N but also for the selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides and catalytic combustion of carbon soot particles [5], [6], [7]. Catalytic oxidation has the advantages of high treatment efficiency, low operating temperature, clean and pollution-free operation, and efficient degradation of waste gas.
Transition-metal oxides have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to their low cost, abundant resources, and simple preparation. Transition metal oxides used for the complete oxidation of propane generally include Co, Mn, Ni, and Cr [8], [9], [10]. Rare-earth elements such as La and Ce are not used as the main catalysts for propane oxidation. However, they are typically used as cocatalysts or carriers to regulate the interactions between different species on the material surface and oxygen defects [11], [12]. Dong et al. studied Pd–CeO2 nanowires, a new catalyst for propane degradation, and reported excellent catalytic activity (T90 = 296 °C) [13]. Wang et al. prepared a supported MnOx catalysts (layer-like Nb2O5-L) for the degradation of propane to T90 at a temperature of 452 °C [14]. Li et al. synthesized a highly defective amorphous Co1Mn3Ox catalyst with the best catalytic activity for propane mineralization at a T90 of 207 °C at a fast space velocity (18 L g−1 h−1) [8]. Zhang et al. prepared a multi-defective spinel catalyst by Na assisted milling of NiCo2O4 via mechano-chemical strategy as a highly active stable catalyst for propane combustion with T90 of 194 °C [9]. Li et al. reported to reuse the waste ternary lithium-ion batteries (TLIBs) as precursors to develop efficient CoMnNiOx catalysts for propane oxidation. (T90 of 200 °C) [15]. It was found that the oxides of Co and Mn are efficient catalysts for activating and dissociating C–C and C–H bonds and have good low-temperature reaction performance in the deep oxidation of propane [16]. In addition, owing to the synergistic effect of a dual-metal material, composite oxides often exhibit better catalytic oxidation performance than single-metal oxides [8], [9], [10], [12], [17].
Metal doping and solution treatment can not only modify the microstructure of metal oxides (crystal defects, crystallinity, heterojunction interface, surface valence, specific surface area, and morphology) but also enable synergistic catalysis of different species, significantly improving the activity, selectivity, and stability of catalysts [8], [9], [10], [12], [18]. Therefore, the addition of other metal species is an effective method of improving the catalytic performance of Co3O4. Manganese ions have a variety of valence states and can exhibit excellent synergistic effects with other metals, specifically limiting grain growth and promoting the migration of oxygen species [19]. Mn can be substituted with Co at the octahedral position in the spinel structure to form a Mn–O–Co solid solution with lattice defects. The increase in Co2+ concentration is conducive to the exposure of reactive oxygen species [8], [20]. In addition, the modification of the Co3O4 catalyst with MnOx may also significantly improve its stability [21], [22]. In recent years, first-principles calculations of density functional theory (DFT) have been widely used to predict the structure and properties of catalysts. Li et al. confirmed the effect of oxygen vacancies (OVs) formed by Zn-doped AgFeO2 on photocatalysis through DFT calculations [23]. Zhang et al. revealed the oxygen vacancy and toluene/oxygen adsorption energy in catalysts at different K-doped locations through DFT calculations [24].
Studies have shown that Co–BTC and Mn–BTC prepared using the solvothermal method have similar columnar layered crystal structures [25]. Therefore, based on the similar coordination habits of Mn2+ and Co2+ in this framework, the Mn/Co–MOF-derived bimetallic oxides easily maintain a layered morphology similar to that of Co3O4, which is also conducive to the high dispersion of the same elements and tight coupling of different elements. Therefore, in this study, a series of Mn/Co–BTCs were prepared through the addition of Mn and synthesis of layered hexagonal Mn–Co metal oxide catalysts were synthesized at a pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C (Fig. 1). The addition of Mn limited the grain growth and resulted in the formation of a displacement-based solid solution with dispersed metal elements. Mn/CoOx-3/2 showed a propane conversion rate of 90% at 270 °C and 120 L g−1 h−1, thus exhibiting catalytic activity comparable to those of some precious metal catalysts. Owing to its large surface area, high degree of reduction, and abundant interfacial defects, Mn/Co-BTC-3/2 showed improved low-temperature reducibility, oxygen mobility, and resistance to water vapor. At the same time, density functional theory was also used to calculate and analyze the oxygen vacancy and state density of Mn-doped Co3O4 catalyst, and theoretical analysis explained the influence of Mn introduction of Co3O4 on the catalytic activity of propane.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of precursors and metal oxides
The XRD patterns of the Mn/Co–BTC precursors and the derived catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, the skeletal structures of all the samples are consistent with that of MOF-CJ4 (CCDC: 258461, 724746) [25], [26]. With increasing Mn content, no new phase was generated, but the intensities of individual diffraction peaks changed, indicating that Mn completely replaced the Co node. The dried precursor samples were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis in air at 0–600 °C. As shown in Fig. S1 (Supporting Information), complete pyrolysis of several precursors to oxides occurs at 350–400 °C for Co–BTC and at 400–450 °C for Mn–BTC. Heat treatment at 400 °C not only ensures the complete combustion of residual organic matter or carbon on the surface of the catalyst but also reduces the growth of catalyst grains to a certain extent.

Fig. 2b exhibits the diffraction patterns of the MOF-derived catalysts after the calcination of the precursors at 400 °C. The oxide derived from Co-BTC is spinel-structure Co3O4 (JCPDS 42–1467). The oxides derived from Mn-BTC show strong diffraction peaks at 23.1°, 32.9°, 38.2°, 45.2°, 55.2°, and 65.8°, which were ascribed to the (211), (222), (400), (332), (440), and (622) crystal planes, respectively, and belong to the Mn2O3 phase (JCPDS 41–1442). With the increase in Mn content, the characteristic peaks of all composite oxides weaken in intensity, expand in width to a certain extent, and shift to smaller angles, indicating that the combination of Mn and Co oxides restricts the grain growth; at the same time, lattice distortion occurs, resulting in the formation of the Mn–O–Co solid solution with defective structure [8], [20]. The characteristic peaks of Mn/CoOx-3/2 and Mn/CoOx-4/1 are not clear, indicating a very low degree of crystallization and a large number of amorphous structures.
Fig. S2a, b, and c show the optical micrographs of Co–BTC, Mn/Co–BTC-3/2, and Mn–BTC, respectively. The cross-sections of the Co–BTC and Mn–BTC crystals are regular hexagonal, but the relative longitudinal size of Mn–BTC is larger; that is, it easily forms a hexagonal prism morphology. Owing to the lattice distortion caused by different metal elements in the same frame structure, bimetallic Mn/Co–BTC-3/2 shows irregular hexagonal morphology. The surface morphologies of the Mn/Co–BTC-derived catalysts were observed using SEM. As shown in Fig. 3a–f, all oxides inherited the hexagonal morphology of the MOF precursors, accompanied by layered structures. Under the action of heat treatment and lattice distortion, the prisms in Mn/CoOx-3/2 were stratified, which increased the number of exposed active sites. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was used to determine the percentages of Mn and Co atoms on the hexagonal surfaces of Mn/CoOx-1/4, Mn/CoOx-2/3, Mn/CoOx-3/2, and Mn/CoOx-4/1 (Table 1). The atomic percentages of Mn and Co were slightly higher than the molar ratios in the initial reaction, but the ratio remained the same. The EDS maps of Mn/CoOx-1/4, Mn/CoOx-2/3, Mn/CoOx-3/2, and Mn/CoOx-1/4 (Fig. 3g–j) indicate that the Mn and Co species are tightly coupled in the Mn–Co dual oxide and that a replacement solid solution with a good dispersion of the metal species was formed.

3.2. Catalytic performance of the catalysts
The propane conversion rate and CO2 production rate (WHSV: 120 Lg−1h−1) are shown in Fig. 4a and Fig. 4b, respectively. The CO2 yield curve is consistent with the propane conversion curve, indicating that almost all the propane was converted into CO2 and H2O. The T10, T50, and T90 values of the catalyst at a WHSV of 120 L g−1 h−1 (Table 2). The order of catalytic activity is Mn/CoOx-3/2 > Mn/CoOx-4/1 > Mn/CoOx-2/3 > Mn/CoOx-1/4 > Mn2O3 > Co3O4 > CP. The activity of the MnCo composite catalysts was significantly higher than those of Co3O4 and Mn2O3. Specifically, the activities of Mn/CoOx-3/2 and Mn/CoOx-4/1 were similar, with T90 of 270 and 275 °C, respectively. Even under harsh conditions of an initial propane concentration of 1 vol% and a space velocity of 120 L g−1 h−1, the catalytic activity of the composite catalysts is comparable to those of some precious metal catalysts [13], [14], [27], [28], [29]. At the same calcination temperature of 400 °C, the activity of CP prepared without organic preparation is much lower than that of Mn-Co binary oxide prepared using MOFs as template. As shown in Fig. 4c, the propane conversion using Mn/CoOx-3/2 was performed at space speeds of 60, 120, and 240 L g−1 h−1. In general, an increase in space velocity is not conducive to the adsorption and activation of reactants [8], [30]. When the WHSV of Co3O4-400 was adjusted from 60 to 120 Lg−1h−1, its catalytic activity significantly decreased, and T90 increased from 315° to 350°C. However, for Mn/CoOx-3/2, T10 and T50 at a WHSV of 60 Lg−1h−1 were greater than those at 120 L g−1 h−1. This may be due to the low space velocity of the reaction system, resulting in the water vapor generated by the complete oxidation of propane being affected by external diffusion and not being easily desorbed by the airflow. In addition, high propane concentrations may lead to competitive adsorption of intermediates and reactants at low space velocities, thus reducing the catalyst activity. When WHSV was increased to 240 Lg−1h−1, the catalytic activity of Mn/CoOx-3/2 significantly decreased because the contact time between the reactants and the catalyst shortened, and the intermediate product was easily taken away by the airflow, resulting in incomplete oxidation of propane [31], [32]. Based on previous research results, a replacement solid-solution catalyst with the same layered morphology was prepared using a layered hexagon of Co oxides and Mn species. Material characterization revealed that the specific surface area, defect content, reducibility, and oxygen mobility of the catalyst were improved, which promoted the catalytic oxidation activity of propane.

As shown in Fig. 4d, the durability test of Mn/CoOx-3/2 was conducted for 50 h at 120 Lg−1h−1 and 300 °C, and the conversion rate of propane remained at 100%. After 5 cycle tests, the catalyst activity had a slight decrease (Fig. 4e), according to previous reports [17], the oxidation of propane generates intermediate carbonaceous species. These carbonaceous species tend to deposit on the catalyst surface, obstructing the active sites and consequently resulting in a decrease in catalytic activity. However, in the overall view, the Mn/CoOx-3/2 has better cyclic stability than Co3O4-350. The effect of water vapor on the catalytic elimination of VOCs is quite complex. Therefore, the effect of water vapor should be considered when designing a catalyst. According to the literature, pure Co3O4 often has low high-temperature stability and water resistance; however, its stability can be greatly improved through modification or compositing with Mn [21], [22]. In addition, Li et al. reported that amorphous Co1Mn3Ox showed good water resistance (propane conversion slightly decreased from 82% to 79% in the presence of 3.1 vol% water vapor) and showed that proper bimetallic composite can exhibit good water vapor tolerance [8]. In the present study, the water stability of Co3O4, Mn/CoOx-3/2, and Mn2O3 was evaluated at the reaction temperature of 300 °C and WHSV of 60 L g−1 h−1 with the addition of 2.5 vol% water vapor. As shown in Fig. 4f, the propane conversion rate of Mn/CoOx-3/2 with lower crystallinity can be approximately 100% in a humid environment, whereas the propane conversion rates of Co3O4 and Mn2O3 decrease by 3.5% and 2.4%, respectively, in a humid environment.
The kinetics of each catalytic system was studied at the WHSV of 120 L g−1 h−1. The propane conversion rate over each catalyst at a reaction temperature of 230 °C was calculated according to Equation (S3). As shown in Table 2, the reaction rates of all bimetallic oxide catalysts are significantly better than those of Co3O4 and Mn2O3; the maximum reaction rate of 5.59 μmolg−1s−1 is observed for Mn/CoOx-3/2. The Arrhenius curve (Fig. 4g) of the propane catalytic oxidation reaction was obtained by fitting Equations (S4) and (S5), and the order of the activation energies was consistent with the catalytic activity in propane oxidation (Table 2). The activation energies of Mn/CoOx-3/2 and Mn/CoOx-4/1 are 71.5 and 72.1 kJmol−1, respectively, which are much lower than those of the other catalysts, consistent with the analysis results of hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and oxygen temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD).
3.3. N2 sorption, H2-TPR, and O2-TPD analysis of catalysts
Fig. 5a shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms obtained from the MOF-derived catalysts, which are all type IV isotherms. The presence of H3 hysteretic rings in the middle high-pressure zone indicates the presence of mesoporous and lamellar material accumulation fractures. The specific surface areas of Co3O4 and Mn2O3 are 16.3872 and 15.7613 m2g−1, respectively. With an increase in the degree of recombination, the maximum specific surface area of the sample reached 60.6297 m2g−1; in particular, a drastic change occurs from Mn/CoOx-2/3 to Mn/CoOx-3/2, which is consistent with the SEM analysis results. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda pore-size distribution curves of the samples are shown in Fig. 5b. The pore size distributions of Co3O4, Mn/CoOx-1/4, and Mn/CoOx-2/3 are similar: the materials are mainly mesoporous with a pore size of approximately 20 nm. The pore size distributions of Mn/CoOx-3/2 and Mn/CoOx-4/1 are not concentrated and gradually develop into multistage pores, whereas Mn2O3 mainly contains mesopores and macropores.

Typically, the redox properties of catalysts are closely related to their performance in the catalytic oxidation of VOCs. Therefore, the redox properties of CoOx, bimetallic Mn/Co oxides, and MnOx were determined via H2-TPR, and the results are presented in Fig. 6a. Co3O4, Mn/CoOx-1/4, and Mn2O3 exhibit two reduction peaks, which can be attributed to the following reductions: Mn4+→Mn3+→Mn2+ and Co3+→Co2+→Co [18]. Mn/CoOx-2/3, Mn/CoOx-3/2, and Mn/CoOx-4/1 show three reduction peaks related to the formation of Mn–O–Co solid solutions. The first is the reduction of some electron-deficient species in Mn–O–Co solid solutions, followed by the reduction of Mn3+→Mn2+ and Co3+→Co2+, and finally, the reduction of divalent ions to metallic elements [20]. Mn/CoOx-4/1 shows the lowest reduction temperature, but its hydrogen consumption is lower than that of Mn/CoOx-3/2. Overall, Mn/CoOx-3/2 and Mn/CoOx-4/1 show excellent reducibility at a low temperature.

To investigate the mobility of oxygen species in the samples, O2-TPD analysis was performed (Fig. 6b). The results show that the desorption of oxygen species in the sample can be subdivided into four processes, namely molecular oxygen (O2) at 40–120 °C, chemosorbed oxygen at 120–450 °C (α-O), surface lattice oxygen at 450–600 °C (α'-O), including non-stoichiometric α"-O, and bulk lattice oxygen (β-O) above 600 °C [30], [33]. Mn/CoOx-3/2 shows larger peak intensity and peak area than other samples in the range of 40–450 °C, indicating that Mn/CoOx-3/2 contains more abundant surface oxygen species, which is consistent with the XPS results. The migration between the reactive surface lattice oxygen and the chemically adsorbed oxygen contributes to the transfer of electrons during the catalytic oxidation of propane, thus promoting the dehydrogenation and complete oxidation of propane molecules [8]. Therefore, Mn/CoOx-3/2 shows the highest amount of desorbed oxygen species at temperatures below 600 °C, indicating that Mn/CoOx-3/2 has the potential for the efficient catalytic oxidation of propane.
3.4. Raman and XPS analysis of catalysts
Raman scattering can be used to study the defect structures in oxides. As shown in Fig. 7a. Co3O4 exhibits three Raman peaks at F2 g (517 cm−1), Eg (480 cm−1), and A1 g (683 cm−1), which are similar to those of pure Co3O4 spinel oxide reported in other studies [34]. The A1 g (683 cm−1) mode was attributed to the octahedral vibration [CoO6], whereas the Raman peak at 638 cm−1 corresponds to the Mn–O stretching vibration of the [MnO6] octahedron in Mn2O3 [35]. With an increase in the Mn content of Mn/CoOx-3/2, the Raman displacement shifts to lower frequencies and gradually widens, which was due to structural disorder and an increase in oxygen defects caused by element doping [8]. The presence of oxygen defects leads to the weakening of the Mn–O and Co–O bonds in the catalyst, which plays an important role in improving the catalytic activity [8], [36]. According to Hooke's Law [35], [37]:

where vi denotes the Raman shift of the M (Mn, Co)–O stretching vibration, c is the speed of light, and k and µ are the force constant and effective mass of the M–O bond, respectively (Fig. 7b). If the error caused by the difference in the atomic radii of Mn and Co is not considered, the relative value of the chemical bond force constant can be compared to the oxygen defect content on the catalyst surface.

The XPS spectra of Co 2p3/2, Mn 2p3/2, and O 1 s are shown in Fig. 8. Co 2p3/2 is divided into two peaks, which belong to surface Co3+ and Co2+ species at the binding energies of 779.9 and 781.3 eV, respectively (Fig. 8a) [12]. The absence of a satellite peak of Mn 2p3/2 at + 5 eV indicates the absence of Mn2+ [38]. Therefore, after the deconvolution of Mn 2p3/2, three peaks are obtained at 641.0, 642.5, and 644.2 eV, corresponding to the satellite peaks of Mn3+, Mn4+, and Mn3+, respectively (Fig. 8b) [39], [40]. O 1 s was fitted to two peaks at 530.1 and 531.5 eV (Fig. 8c) [18], [41]. The peak at 530.1 eV corresponds to Mn–O and Co–O bonds (Olat) of lattice oxygen, whereas the peak at 531.5 eV was attributed to surface reactive oxygen species (Osur) [18], [19], [42]. The atomic percentages and stoichiometric ratios of Mn and Co are basically consistent, indicating that Mn and Co species strongly interact. In the Co3O4 spinel, Co3+ and Co2+ ions are located at octahedral and tetrahedral sites, respectively [43], [44]. As presented in Table 1,The decrease of Co3+/Co2+ ratio indicates that Mn replaces Co3+ at the octahedral position of Co3O4 [12]. The Mn4+/Mn3+ ratio estimated by the XPS Mn 2p peak is also lowest in Mn/CoOx-3/2, which is consistent with Co3+ being replaced by Mn. Mn/CoOx-3/2 has the lowest Co3+/Co2+ and Mn4+/Mn3+ ratios, indicating the highest degree of reduction on its surface, which may be related to the existence of a large number of oxygen vacancies [45]. The total for different oxygen species in O 1 s shows that Mn/CoOx-3/2 possesses the highest surface oxygen content. Surface reactive oxygen species are formed through the chemical adsorption of oxygen on oxygen defects. Therefore, the combination of Mn and Co exhibits a significantly increased number of oxygen defects, which may be conducive to the adsorption of oxygen on the catalyst surface and the migration of oxygen species. As summarized in Table 1, the Mn/Co mole ratios measured through XPS are slightly lower than the stoichiometric ratios, which is consistent with the EDS results. The results indicate that Mn species may be distributed in the interior of the samples, whereas Co species may be preferably distributed on the surface. With an increase in the Mn content, the ratio of Co3+/Co2+ decreases, and Mn/CoOx-3/2 exhibits the minimum Mn4+/Mn3+ ratio. This is consistent with the fact that Mn/CoOx-3/2 possesses the most abundant defect oxygen species because a decrease in the average valence of metal ions in transition metal oxides is an indication of the generation of oxygen vacancies [12].

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a useful technique for studying materials with unpaired electrons and defects. To understand the effect of hypoxia on the catalytic oxidation performance of propane, the Co3O4, Mn2O3, and Mn/CoOx-3/2 samples were analyzed using EPR at low temperatures. As shown in Fig. 8d, the EPR signals of the three samples show a symmetric peak at a g factor of 2.003, indicating the existence of oxygen vacancies [46], [47]. Interestingly, the peak strength of Mn/CoOx-3/2 is significantly higher than those of Co3O4 and Mn2O3, indicating that there are more oxygen defects in the Mn/CoOx-3/2 samples, which is more conducive to the catalytic oxidation of propane. At the same time, the Raman and XPS spectra are in good agreement.
3.5. TEM of the catalysts
The defect structures of Co3O4, Mn/CoOx-3/2, and Mn2O3 were further characterized using TEM. The illustrations in Fig. 9a, d, and g show that Co3O4, Mn/CoOx-3/2, and Mn2O3 are all stacked with nanoparticles. Fig. 9a and b show high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of Co3O4. The exposed (111), (311), and (220) crystal faces belong to the {112} crystal-face family. The HRTEM images of Mn/CoOx-3/2 (Fig. 9d and e) mainly expose the {112} crystal group of Co3O4, indicating that in the replacement solid solution formed by Co and Mn oxides, spinel Co3O4 is the solvent and Mn species are the solutes. Fig. 9 g and h show HRTEM images of Mn2O3. The large crystalline region corresponds to the (110) crystal plane of MnO2, whereas the Mn2O3 species corresponding to the (211) crystal plane are mainly distributed in the region with abundant interfaces (JCPDS 44–0141 and 41–1442). Therefore, species in the lower state are easily distributed on the surface of the catalyst and produce surface defects. In Fig. 9a and j, stacked layers with a spacing of approximately 1 nm are observed. Lamellar stacking can provide additional interfacial defects with abundant oxygen vacancies [48]. In addition, more abundant grain boundaries are observed in Fig. 9e, indicating that Mn/CoOx-3/2 has a fine grain size. As shown in Fig. 9k, there are interface defects at the grain boundaries, which can form crystal–amorphous heterojunctions that are often rich in oxygen defects promoting the catalytic reaction [49]. Fig. 9c, f, and i show the selected electron diffraction patterns of Co3O4, Mn/CoOx-3/2, and Mn2O3, respectively, which correspond well correspond with the HRTEM results. The coexistence of diffraction spots and diffraction rings indicates that the catalysts are all polycrystalline, whereas the dispersion distribution of the diffraction rings in Mn/CoOx-3/2 indicates that the degree of crystallization is low, which is consistent with the above characterization of defects.

3.6. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
Previous studies have shown that oxygen vacancies play a crucial role in catalytic oxidation reactions [50]. As shown in Fig. 10a, the oxygen vacancy formation energy was calculated using DFT. The effect of Mn-doping on the system was also investigated. The Evo values of Co3O4 and Co3O4–Mn are 1.44 and 1.17 eV, respectively. The results show that the oxygen vacancy formation energy of Co3O4–Mn is lower than that of Co3O4, indicating that Mn-doping is conducive to the formation of oxygen vacancies. The calculation results are consistent with the EPR and XPS results. These oxygen vacancies activated more adsorbed oxygen, thus accelerating the activation of propane molecules on Co3O4–Mn.

Additionally, the density of states (DOS) was analyzed to determine the surface properties [51]. The DOS and projected density of states (PDOS) of Co near the Fermi level (EF) increased after Mn-doping, implying an improvement in surface conductivity, effective electron transport, and ion diffusion (Fig. 10 b, c). At the same time, the DOS peak of Co3O4–Mn is closer to the EF, indicating that electrons can more effectively regulate the surface valence state and rapidly activate the surface-adsorbed reactants [52]. This was beneficial for the catalytic oxidation of propane.
3.7. Mechanism of propane oxidation
In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) was performed to trace the intermediates formed during the adsorption and oxidation of propane on the catalyst surface to elucidate the reaction mechanism. As illustrated in Fig. 11a, c, and e, the characteristic peaks in the range of 3100–3600 cm−1 were attributed to the stretching vibration of the hydroxyl group in the surface-adsorbed water. The peaks at 2850–2980 cm−1 correspond to the stretching vibration of propane –CH2– and –CH3 [28], [30]. In the low-wavenumber region, the presence of CC (1649 cm−1), –COOH (1589 cm−1), –CH3 (1360 cm−1), –CH2– (1457 cm−1), and C–O (1045 cm−1) bonds indicates that propane was adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst in the form of propylene (CH2 =CH–CH3) and oxygen-containing compounds [11]. Therefore, adsorption on the catalyst occurs through propane dehydrogenation and further oxidation driven by reactive oxygen species. Mn/CoOx-3/2 showed the strongest CC absorption peak, indicating that the catalyst exhibited excellent propane adsorption performance.

After the introduction of oxygen (Fig. 11b, d, and f), with increasing temperature, the intensities of the peaks corresponding to the stretching vibrations of –CH2– and –CH3 (2850–2980 cm−1) gradually decrease, and CO32− and –COOH gradually accumulate on the catalyst surface. Co3O4 and Mn2O3 show significant changes in the –CH3 absorption peaks at 1360 cm−1, which may be due to the difficulty in removing hydrogen atoms far from the adsorption site; the difficulty in detecting the –CH3 bending vibration signal of Mn/CoOx-3/2 indicates that the degree of oxidation of propane on Mn/CoOx-3/2 is higher. It was found that the evolution of the species structure on Co3O4 is relatively slow, whereas Mn2O3 has a strong ability to oxidize propane to carboxylate and carbonate but a weak ability to desorb these two species. As shown in Fig. 11f, the accumulation of –CH3 at 100–200 °C was attributed to the insufficient migration ability of oxygen species. Mn/CoOx-3/2 gradually exhibits carbonate accumulation and desorption at 150–300 °C, indicating that a large amount of propane was fully converted (Fig. 11d).
Although the evolution rates of the surface species differ, the reaction pathways on several catalyst surfaces are similar. First, the dehydrogenation of propane on the catalyst surface produces CH2 =CH−CH3. The surface oxygen species then react with the adsorbent, causing further oxidation to form carboxylates and carbonates. Later, oxygen molecules fill the oxygen vacancies and participate in the reaction, promoting the oxygenation of intermediates (propylene, allyl alcohol, and acrolein) and C–C bond breaking, during which oxygen fluidity is maintained, and greater amounts of carboxylate and carbonate are produced [53], [54]. Finally, all intermediates are completely oxidized to CO2 and H2O. The catalytic oxidation of propane on the three catalysts conformed to the Mars van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism (Fig. 12).

3.8. Discussion
According to previous references, propane oxidation on the metal oxide follows the Mars-Van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism [53], [54]: First, propane molecules are adsorbed on the surface of Mn/Co oxides and react with surface reactive oxygen species. Simultaneously, oxygen vacancies are generated when manganese cobalt metal oxides are reduced, and oxygen in the gas phase can fill these vacancies and be activated, leading to the reoxidation of reactive oxygen species in the reduced Mn/Co oxides (as shown in Fig. 12). The XPS, O2-TPD, and catalytic activity analysis demonstrated that Mn3+ serves as the primary active site and Osur as the main reactive oxygen species for propane oxidation on Mn-containing catalysts, which is also supported by previous report [55]. Based on the analysis of H2-TPR, O2-TPD, Raman, XPS, EPR, and DFT theoretical calculations, Mn/CoOx-3/2 exhibits better low temperature reducibility and more oxygen vacancies, Mn3+, and Osur species. Consequently, compared to pure Co3O4, Mn/CoOx-3/2 can adsorb more propane molecules at the Mn3+ site and subsequently react with more Osur on the catalyst, resulting in significant catalytic activity for propane oxidation. Furthermore, the low-temperature reducibility facilitates the reoxidation of Mn/CoOx-3/2, while more oxygen vacancies promote the activation of more gas phase O2, accompanied by an increase in Osur species. Thus, propane molecules could convert to carbon dioxide and water on Mn/CoOx-3/2 surface more easily.
4. Conclusions
In this study, we prepared a series of Mn/Co–BTC materials through the addition of Mn to Co–BTC and synthesized multilayer columnar hexagonal Mn–Co oxide catalysts at the pyrolysis temperature of 400 °C. The addition of Mn limited the growth of catalyst grains, and the Mn and Co species were tightly coupled in the composite oxides, forming a replacement solid solution with well-dispersed metal species. Owing to its large specific surface area and abundant interfacial defects, Mn/CoOx-3/2 showed improved reducibility, oxygen mobility, and resistance of the catalyst to water vapor. The oxygen vacancies and state densities of Co3O4 and Co3O4–Mn were calculated using DFT, and it was confirmed that Mn-doping is conducive to the formation of oxygen vacancies. The reaction mechanism was studied using DRIFTS. Propane is pre-oxidized, forming propylene and oxygen-containing compounds (propylene, allyl alcohol, acrolein, and acrylic acid) during adsorption. With the intake of oxygen and an increase in temperature, the intermediate products were completely oxidized to CO2 and H2O, and the reaction process conformed to the MvK mechanism model. Therefore, the synergistic effect of columnar MOF-derived layered dual-metal oxides is conducive to the formation of a greater number of surface defects, which can further improve the catalytic propane oxidation performance.
