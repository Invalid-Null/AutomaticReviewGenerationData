CexZr1–xO2-Supported CrOx Catalysts for CO2-Assisted Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane─Probing the Active Sites and Strategies for Enhanced Stability

Abstract
CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODH) represents an attractive approach for propylene production and CO2 utilization. As a soft oxidant, CO2 can minimize overoxidation of the hydrocarbons to enhance the propylene selectivity while increasing the equilibrium yield. However, a major challenge of CO2-ODH is the rapid deactivation of the catalysts. The current study focuses on designing CexZr1–xO2-mixed oxide-supported CrOx catalysts for CO2-ODH with enhanced product selectivity and catalyst stability. By doping 0–30% Ce in the CexZr1–xO2 mixed oxide support, propane conversion of 53–79% was achieved at 600 °C, with propylene selectivity up to 82%. Compared to the pure ZrO2-supported catalyst (i.e., 5 wt %Cr/ZrO2), 20–30 %Ce doped catalysts (i.e., 5 wt %Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 and 5 wt %Cr/Ce0.3Zr0.7O2) inhibited the formation of CH4 and ethylene and improved propylene selectivity from 57 to 77–82%. Detailed characterizations of the 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated that Cr3+ is the active species during the CO2-ODH reaction, and the reaction follows a non-redox dehydrogenation pathway. Coke formation was determined to be the primary reason for catalyst deactivation, and the addition of Ce to the ZrO2 support greatly enhanced the coke resistance, leading to superior stability. Coke removal by oxidizing the catalyst in air is effective in restoring its activity.

1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propylene (C3H6) is one of the most widely produced chemicals worldwide. It finds a variety of important applications, such as the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylic acid, and acrylonitrile. The global propylene market is projected to exceed 165 million tons by the end of 2030. (1) Currently, propylene is mainly produced by two industrial processes: steam cracking of naphtha/liquid petroleum gas and fluid catalytic cracking of heavy gas oils. The cracking reactions are endothermic and energy-intensive, so they indirectly lead to the emission of large amounts of CO2. Direct dehydrogenation of propane is an alternative route for propylene production and is currently receiving increased interest due to a surplus of shale gas supply. Several commercial technologies are available for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, such as the Oleflex and CATOFIN processes. (2) The Oleflex process uses platinum catalysts (e.g., Pt–Sn/Al2O3) in moving-bed reactors, while CATOFIN employs chromium oxide (CrOx) catalysts (e.g., Cr/Al2O3) in fixed-bed reactors. However, direct dehydrogenation of propane is also endothermic, requiring high energy input, and dehydrogenation catalysts suffer from fast deactivation due to coke deposition.
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is a promising alternative to the aforementioned processes. (3,4) Using oxygen as the oxidant, the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction is exothermic, and its conversion is not limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. In addition, coke formation is substantially suppressed in the presence of oxygen. However, oxygen is a strong oxidant, which tends to overoxidize the hydrocarbons (e.g., propylene) to form CO2, limiting the yield of propylene. Chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation has also been explored to increase propylene selectivity and eliminate oxygen separation. However, the long-term stability of the redox catalysts has yet to be demonstrated. (5−9) More recently, soft oxidants (i.e., CO2 and N2O) have been used as a replacement for O2 in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. For example, CO2 has been shown to maintain an oxidative environment while greatly reducing the overoxidation of propylene to undesired COx byproducts. There are several advantages of using CO2 as the oxidant in dehydrogenation of propane: CO2 can react with hydrogen via the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS) and shift the reaction equilibrium to produce more propylene. CO2 can also enhance catalyst stability by removing formed coke via the reverse Boudouard reaction. An additional benefit to CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODH) is the direct use of a greenhouse gas to mitigate CO2 emissions. CO2-ODH of propane (10−12) has received significantly less attention than CO2-ODH of ethane (13−21)
Many heterogeneous catalysts based on redox-active metal oxides (i.e., chromium oxide, vanadium oxide, and iron oxide) and main group metal oxides (i.e., gallium oxide) have been investigated for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Among the metal oxide catalysts, Cr-based catalysts have been reported to be among the most promising for the CO2-ODH reaction. For example, mesoporous silica (i.e., MCM-41)-supported metal oxides exhibit activity in the following order: Cr > Ga > Ni, V > Fe, Mn, and Co for CO2-ODH. (22) In fact, CrOx is the key component of the industrial catalyst used in the CATOFIN process for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. High dispersion of CrOx on catalyst supports is critical in achieving high propane conversions. (23) Various mesoporous silicas with high surface areas, such as SBA-1, SBA-15, MCM-41, and MSU, have been used to disperse CrOx, and significantly higher propylene yields have been reported, compared to conventional amorphous silica-supported CrOx catalysts. (22,24,25) Modification of CrOx catalysts by a dopant is another strategy to improve the catalyst performance. For example, a nickel-doped chromium catalyst exhibited 50% enhancement of propane conversion, due to stabilized Cr3+ by doped Ni. (26) Similar promotional effects were also observed for a Ru-promoted Cr catalyst with 2-fold enhancement in the propylene production rate. (27)
Cr-based catalysts are among the most active catalysts for the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. (25,28−30) However, poor catalyst stability remains the main obstacle for the practical implementation of the CO2-ODH process. A commonly proposed deactivation pathway is coke deposition, while other factors such as sintering and/or reduction of active sites have also been proposed as the potential causes. The presence of CO2 can enhance catalyst stability depending on the type of catalyst support used. It was reported that both the propylene yield and catalyst stability were improved using CO2 with 5%Cr/SiO2 catalyst, although CO2 had no significant impact on the catalyst performance for activated carbon-supported CrOx catalysts. Mixed results were observed for 5%Cr/Al2O3, with decreased propylene yield and improved stability in the presence of CO2. (31) The effect of catalyst support on Cr catalyst stability has been investigated using Cr supported on mesoporous SiO2 (i.e., SBA-15), γ-Al2O3, and ZrO2. (32) Although significant amount of research has been published on CrOx-based catalysts for CO2-ODH of propane, there is still an ongoing debate in terms of (i) the active sites and the reaction pathway and (ii) primary deactivation mechanism. Typically, fresh CrOx catalysts consist of both Cr6+ and Cr3+ species, which have been investigated for the ODH reaction. (33) However, the oxidation states of Cr during the ODH reaction remain unclear. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) studies suggest that Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+ in the presence of propane, which represents the active sites during direct dehydrogenation of propane without oxidants. (28) Reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ was also observed by in situ XAS for CO2-assisted ODH over a Cr-MCM-41 catalyst. As the regeneration of Cr3+ to Cr6+ was achieved by introducing O2 or CO2, it was postulated that a Cr6+/Cr3+ redox couple is responsible for the CO2-ODH reaction. (22) Regeneration of the reduced Cr4+ to Cr6+ by CO2 was very slow compared to O2-assisted regeneration. Michorczyk et al. reported that reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ occurs during the CO2-ODH reaction for the Cr/SBA-1 catalyst, as evidenced by in situ UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. (34) However, Cr3+/Cr2+ was considered to be responsible for the dehydrogenation reaction. These studies, based on either the Cr6+/Cr3+ or Cr3+/Cr2+ redox pathway, proposed that the reaction follows a Mars-Van Krevelen mechanism. On the other hand, Hakuli et al. proposed that the dehydrogenation reaction uses both reduced Cr6+, that is, redox 3+ and exposed non-redox Cr3+ sites. (35) Shishido et al. further pointed out that oxidative dehydrogenation over Cr6+ takes place in the initial stage, while direct dehydrogenation over Cr3+ proceeds after 5 min of reaction. (36) After all, direct dehydrogenation of propane proceeds well over Cr3+ active sites. (2,37,38) In terms of the catalyst deactivation, the reduction of Cr6+22,26 and/or coke deposition (25,28,39) were proposed to be the primary mechanisms.
Given these challenges in the field of CO2-ODH with Cr catalysts and the lack of consensus over the reaction pathway and catalyst deactivation mechanism, this work reports CexZr1–xO2-supported CrOx catalysts with enhanced selectivity/stability and investigates the underlying reaction/deactivation mechanisms. Ceria-stabilized zirconia has been widely used as the catalyst support due to its excellent redox properties, (40−42) but it has not been thoroughly investigated for CO2-ODH. Comprehensive characterization including both ex situ and in situ techniques shed light on the active sites of CrOx/CexZr1–xO2 catalysts. The correlations among catalyst properties, product selectivities, and stability are thus established. DFT calculations were performed to provide insights into the reaction pathways, catalyst activity, byproduct formation, and catalyst deactivation mechanism.
2. Methods
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
2.1. Catalyst Synthesis
A sol–gel method is used for catalyst preparation to ensure a higher degree of homogeneity among the active metal and the support. Respective amounts of nitrate precursors were dissolved in deionized water (DIW) and stirred well for 15 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of citric acid. After the solution was allowed to thoroughly mix for 30 min, ethylene glycol was added dropwise and brought to 80 °C until the gel formed. The resultant sol–gel product was dried at 120 °C overnight and then calcined at 650 °C for 8 h to burn off the organic template. Lastly, the samples were crushed, pressed at 15 MPa, and sieved to a grain size of 150–250 μm.
2.2. Characterization
Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at −196 °C were measured using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 porosimeter. After degassing, the respective support and catalyst (∼250 mg) specific surface areas were calculated by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analysis. Standard powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired with a PANalytical Empyrean XRD over a 20–70° 2θ range, 0.05° step size, and 2°/s scan rate. The resultant data were analyzed in Microsoft Excel, while reference patterns were accessed via HighScore Plus’s highly comprehensive database. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were acquired with a Kratos Analytical Axis Ultra spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα (hν = 1.487 eV) X-ray source. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed with a TA Instruments SDT-Q600 Simultaneous TGA/DSC. Approximately 10 mg of fresh sample was pretreated at 650 °C for 60 min under 10% O2/Ar gas flow to drive off surface H2O. The sample was then allowed to cool to room temperature in an argon environment. Reduction of the fresh catalyst was carried out by heating the sample at 350 or 600 °C in 10%H2/Ar for 30 min. Spent catalysts were analyzed via TGA by heating from room temperature to 600 °C at 20 °C/min under 10% O2/Ar gas flow. Raman spectra were acquired using Horiba XploRA PLUS Confocal Raman Microscope with an excitation source of 785 nm. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiments were performed in a Thermal Scientific Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a high-temperature cell and a mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT-A) detector, which was cooled with liquid nitrogen. Spectra were acquired at a resolution of 4 cm–1, typically over 256 scans. The catalyst was first oxidized in a 10% O2 flow at 650 °C for 30 min and cooled down to 25 °C in Ar. After that, the catalyst was exposed to 10% propane at 25 °C for 1 h, before being purged in Ar for 30 min. Then, the sample was heated in Ar to 100, 200, 300, and 400 °C and held isothermally at each temperature for 10 min. After the desorption steps, the catalyst was cooled down to 25 °C in Ar. In the cyclic study, the spent catalyst was subjected to the repeated procedure of propane adsorption and desorption, as described above, without catalyst regeneration (reoxidation) between cycles.
2.3. Catalytic Activity Measurements
First, 200 mg of catalyst was loaded in a quartz U-tube with an inner diameter of 4 mm and placed in a tube furnace after packing the ends of the U-tube with quartz wool. To create a carbon balance basis, a room temperature measurement of reactant gasses (C3H8:CO2:Ar = 1:2:37, 20 mL/min) was acquired. To activate the catalyst, the temperature of the furnace was ramped from room temperature to 600 °C and held at this temperature for 30 min. The activation feedstock concentration contained 10% O2 (Ar balance) at 20 mL/min. During a 10 min argon purge, the reactor was cooled to 500 °C. The reaction was then initiated by introducing relative concentrations of C3H8:CO2:Ar = 1:2:37 at a total flow rate of 20 mL/min. After equilibrating for 5 min, effluent gas was collected for 10 min. The reactor was then ramped to 550 and 600 °C after similar equilibrations and collections. Each sample was collected via a gas bag and subsequently analyzed in GC/TCD-FID instrumentation. For the stability test, the catalyst was loaded into the reactor and activated by the same procedure outlined above. After a 10 min Ar purge at 600 °C, the reactant feedstock was introduced to the system at the same relative concentration and flow rate, as mentioned above in Section 2.3. After flowing for 5 min to account for any pre-equilibration effects, the first gas sample was collected and designated as the 5 min sample. Samples were then collected in 30 min intervals for 180 min total time on stream. Each sample was collected for 10 min via a gas bag and subsequently analyzed in GC/TCD-FID instrumentation. The conversions of propane and CO2 were calculated based on the amount of propane and CO2 in the feed and the product stream (quantified by GC). The selectivity was calculated using the amount of individual hydrocarbon products divided by the total hydrocarbons formed in the product stream on a carbon basis since carbon balance analysis indicated negligible propane reforming.
2.4. Computational Details
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). (43−46) We used the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to calculate the electronic structures, and the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was employed. (47) The projector-augmented wave (PAW) method was utilized to describe the electron–core interaction. (48,49) The cutoff energy was set as 450 eV. The force threshold was set as 0.05 eV Å–1 with energy convergence criterion for every electronic loop of 10–4 eV, and these settings are proved to be accurate enough and applied in our previous work. (50,51) Spin polarization effects were considered, and Hubbard U corrections were involved with Ueff = 4.5 and 3.5 eV for Cr and Ce, respectively. (52,53) The lattice parameters of ZrO2 were optimized, and they were used to build a 9-layer ZrO2(101) surface. The bottom 3 layers of the atoms were fixed during all of the calculations, and the other atoms were relaxed. Based on the ZrO2(101) surface structure, we compared the energetics when a surface Zr atom or subsurface Zr atom was substituted by Ce, and the Ce was favorably doped at the surface Zr site. The Ce dopant concentration is 17%, consistent with the experimental Ce concentration of 20%. The obtained structures were shown in Figure S1. To further consider ODH reactions, we build a 2 × 3 ZrO2(101) supercell structure either with or without the Ce dopant, and we further put a Cr2O3 cluster on the ZrO2(101) surface. The vacuum layer was set larger than 12 Å to diminish the artificial interactions from adjacent slabs. The obtained Cr/ZrO2 and Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 structures were optimized by using a 2 × 2 × 1 k-point grid to describe the surface Brillouin Zone. To validate the stability of the Cr/ZrO2 and Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 structures, we conducted structural relaxations by the ab initio molecular dynamics method using the parameters reported in previous work, (54,55) and it was found that the structures remain stable after 5 ps at 600 °C, suggesting good stability. The transition-state structures were obtained by the climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB). (56,57)

3.1. Catalyst Preparation and Characterization
The 5 wt %Cr/CeZrO2 catalysts were synthesized by a one-pot sol–gel method, as described in the experimental section, followed by calcination in air at 650 °C for 6 h. The structures of the catalysts were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (Figure 1). Pure ZrO2-supported Cr catalyst exhibits a tetragonal ZrO2 phase. By doping 10–30 mol % Ce, the tetragonal ZrO2 phase was retained, while peak shifts to lower angles were observed due to lattice expansion caused by Ce doping. At higher Ce loading (i.e., 50 mol %), the crystal structure changes to a cubic phase, resembling that of the CeO2 support.

The surface areas of the 5 wt %Cr/CexZr1–xO2 catalysts were measured by nitrogen physisorption. As shown in Table 1, the pure ZrO2-supported CrOx has a BET surface area of 99.5 m2/g. By increasing Ce doping from 0 to 100%, the surface area decreases from 99.5 to 30.3 m2/g.

3.2. CO2-Assisted Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane
The catalytic performance of 5 wt %Cr/CexZr1–xO2 catalysts was evaluated for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (Figure 2 and Table 2). Generally, both the propane and CO2 conversion increase with reaction temperature for all the 5 wt %Cr/CexZr1–xO2 catalysts investigated. For example, the propane and CO2 conversions were 13.3 and 5.0% at 500 °C for a 5 wt %Cr/ZrO2 catalyst. By increasing the reaction temperature to 550 °C, the propane and CO2 conversions increased to 42.7 and 16.8, respectively. Further increasing the temperature to 600 °C resulted in 79.8% propane conversion, and 42.7% CO2 conversion. Although high propane conversion can be achieved at 600 °C with ZrO2-supported catalysts (i.e., 5 wt %Cr/ZrO2), the propylene selectivity was only at 57.6% (Table 2). By doping 10 mol % Ce in the catalyst (i.e., 5 wt %Cr/Ce0.1Zr0.9O2), the propane conversion slightly decreased to 75.0%, while the propylene selectivity increased to 66.7% at 600 °C. Further increasing Ce doping to 20 mol % resulted in propylene selectivity reaching 79.4% with propane conversion of 62.6%. Propylene selectivity up to 92.9% can be achieved with a 5 wt %Cr/Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 catalyst at a propane conversion of 9.7%. Overall, a maximum propylene yield of ∼50% is achieved with 10–20% mol Ce-doped catalysts (i.e., 5 wt %Cr/Ce0.1Zr0.9O2 and 5 wt %Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2). The hydrocarbon product distribution is shown in Figure 3 and Table S1. The major side products are methane and ethane, from the cracking of propane and/or propylene. At 600 °C, the methane selectivity was 34.2% for a 5 wt %Cr/ZrO2 catalyst. The Ce-doped catalyst (i.e., 5 wt %Cr/CexZr1–xO2) reduced methane selectivity by half to 17.7%, suggesting that the presence of Ce inhibits cracking product formation. When propane concentration was increased to 25%, the propane conversion decreased to ∼12%, while propylene selectivity was above 90% at 600 °C (Figure S2).

The stability of 5%Cr/ZrO2, 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2, and 5%Cr/Ce0.3Zr0.7O2 catalysts were evaluated for CO2-ODH reaction over 6 h (Figure 4). The 5%Cr/ZrO2 catalyst had a higher initial propane conversion of 81.1% compared to 55.1–56.2% from Ce-doped catalysts (i.e., 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2, and 5%Cr/Ce0.3Zr0.7O2). However, the 5%Cr/ZrO2 catalyst deactivated very fast, with propane conversion dropping to 48.0% at 2 h of reaction. At 6 h, the propane conversion further decreased to 9.2%, corresponding to 11% of its initial value at 5 min. As a comparison, the Ce-doped catalysts are far more stable, retaining 52–60% of their initial activity after 6 h of CO2-ODH reaction.

3.3. Reaction Pathway and Mechanism
Comprehensive characterizations were conducted to understand the underlying reaction mechanism. The oxidation states of Cr for the fresh and spent 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts were examined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Figure 5). Both Cr6+ and Cr3+ were present in the as-prepared catalysts, with a Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio of 2.45 and 1.75 for 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst, respectively. After the CO2-ODH reaction, CrOx was reduced, and only Cr3+ was observed in both 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts. This suggests that Cr3+ is the active site during the ODH reaction. The surface structure of supported CrOx was analyzed by Raman spectroscopy (Figure 6). For as-prepared 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts, three peaks were observed in the 800–1100 cm–1 region, corresponding to surface Cr6+ species. (58) More specifically, the peaks at 1028–1030 cm–1 are attributed to Cr═O vibration of isolated CrOx species. The peaks at 880–882 and 1002–1008 cm–1 are due to Cr–O–Cr and Cr═O vibrations of polymeric CrOx, respectively. The peaks corresponding to ZrO2 or Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 were observed in the region of 200–800 cm–1, which could overlap with Ce–O–Ce stretching (i.e., 465 cm–1) in the case of the 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst. (59) After the CO2-ODH reaction, the peak intensity for both the monomeric and polymeric CrOx species significantly decreased. This suggests that reduction of Cr6+ occurs during the reaction, consistent with XPS results. In order to further verify this hypothesis, the fresh 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst was pre-reduced in H2 at 350 °C before conducting the CO2-ODH reaction (Figure 7). Reduction of supported CrOx in hydrogen is facile at less than 400 °C, as reported in the literature. (60,61) To ensure a 350 °C pre-reduction would fully reduce Cr6+ to Cr3+, additional experiments were carried out for reduction at both 350 and 600 °C (Figure S3). After subtracting the weight loss from the support, the reduction of CrOx in 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 contributed to similar weight loss (0.57–0.61 wt %) at both 350 and 600 °C (30 min reduction in 10% H2). This confirms that a reduction at 350 °C is sufficient to reduce Cr6+ to Cr3+. The low reduction temperature (i.e., 350 °C) is preferred to maintain the CrOx dispersion on the surface and to avoid excessive reduction of the support. The initial activity of the as-prepared and pre-reduced 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts were similar, with propane conversion at 56.2 and 57.1%, respectively. This further confirms that the reduced Cr3+ is the active species for propane dehydrogenation. It is noted that the pre-reduced catalyst was slightly less stable compared to the fresh catalyst, with 44% of initial activity preserved at 6 h of reaction for the pre-reduced catalyst versus 53% remaining for the fresh catalyst. This is likely to be due to the increased coke formation of the pre-reduced catalyst, as will be discussed later in the context of the deactivation mechanism. The direct dehydrogenation pathway is further supported by a propane dehydrogenation reaction without CO2. As shown in Figure S4, initial propane conversion was measured to be 52.6% at 600 °C without CO2, which is comparable to the propane conversion (i.e., 56.2%) during the CO2-assisted ODH reaction at the same temperature, suggesting that CO2 is not essential for propane activation. Instead, CO2 is more likely to react with formed hydrogen via the RWGS reaction.

In situ DRIFTS study was carried out to provide insights on the CO2-ODH reaction pathway over the 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst (Figure 8). The fresh catalyst was first pretreated at 650 °C for 30 min in the presence of 10%O2, followed by cooling down to room temperature for propane adsorption. After propane adsorption, the catalyst was purged at room temperature for 20 min. Adsorption of propane is evidenced by peaks at 1378 and 1456 cm–1, corresponding to C–H bending. Interestingly, three peaks appear in the region of 1500–1700 cm–1 (i.e., 1560, 1616, and 1675 cm–1) due to C═C stretching, suggesting the formation of surface-adsorbed propylene. Desorption of propylene was observed when the catalyst was heated above 200 °C. When propane and CO2 were coadsorbed on the catalyst surface, both propane and propylene peaks were observed (Figure 8b). Desorption of propylene occurs at above 200 °C, similar to the case of propane adsorption only. In the temperature range studied (i.e., 25–400 °C), no CO peak was observed. This suggests that propane dehydrogenation is more favorable than CO2 splitting over the 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst. In fact, negligible CO2 chemisorption over the catalyst was observed based on the CO2-TPD study (Figure S5). Cr3+ as the active site is further supported by cyclic DRIFTS experiments in the presence of propane for two cycles without regeneration of the catalyst in-between (Figure S6). Based on previous discussions, Cr6+ is reduced to Cr3+ after the dehydrogenation reaction. After the cycle 1 propane dehydrogenation reaction, the spent 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalyst was re-exposed to propane. As shown in Figure S5, propylene peaks were immediately observed at room temperature, further confirming that Cr3+ is the active species responsible for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Therefore, direct dehydrogenation of propane is the pathway for propylene production. CO2 can then react with the formed hydrogen via RWGS to shift the reaction equilibrium to produce more propylene as well as the CO coproduct.

DFT calculations were performed to provide molecular-level insights into the CO2-assisted ODH on Cr/ZrO2 and Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts. Figure 9a shows the energy profile of ODH of propane on the two structure models considered. The ODH reaction starts from the activation of propane (C3H8) to isopropyl (C3H7) with barriers of 2.16 eV on Cr/ZrO2 and 2.33 eV on Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 surfaces, indicating slightly favorable kinetics on Cr/ZrO2 for this step. The dehydrogenation of C3H8 to propyl (CH2CH2CH3) is unfavorable compared with isopropyl (62) The subsequent dehydrogenation of C3H7 to propylene (C3H6) has a low barrier of 0.80 eV on Cr/ZrO2, while the barrier is 2.12 eV on Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 surfaces. The results suggest that Cr/ZrO2 has better reactivity than Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 for the dehydrogenation from C3H8 to C3H6, and the rate-limiting step is the dehydrogenation of C3H8 to C3H7. In addition, the desorption energies of C3H6 are 0.43 and 0.51 eV for Cr/ZrO2 and Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2, respectively. Considering the dehydrogenation barriers of C3H6 to C3H5 are larger than 1.5 eV on Cr/ZrO2 and Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2, the product C3H6 would be more favorable toward desorption from the surface than further dehydrogenation. In Figure 9b, the barriers and reaction energies of the CO2 splitting reaction on Cr/ZrO2 and Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 surfaces are calculated to be 2.58 and 2.43 eV, respectively. These barriers are higher than those of C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H7, and hence, the dehydrogenation reactions are likely the main reactions during the overall process, consistent with observations from the DRIFTS study as well as activity measurements.

3.4. Effect of Ce Doping
To further understand the superior product selectivity for Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2, we considered cracking reactions during propane dehydrogenation, which are a key precursor reaction of forming coke species, as well as methane and ethylene byproducts. As mentioned above, C3H6 is readily desorbed from the surface, and the C–C bond cleavage of C3H6 has barriers of ∼3 eV on both Cr/ZrO2 and Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 surfaces, and hence, C3H6 is not likely to be the precursor of cracking reactions. In addition, considering that the C3H8 species has no unpaired electrons and it binds weakly with the surface, it is unlikely for such species to undergo cracking. Therefore, here we mainly discuss the cracking process of C3H7 (Figure S7). According to the comparison between the dehydrogenation barriers of C3H7 (Ea, dehydro) and C–C bond cleavage barriers of C3H7 (Ea, C–C cleav) in Table 3, it was found that C3H7 can be dehydrogenated to C3H6 on both Cr/ZrO2 and Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 structures. A descriptor of Ea, C–C cleav – Ea, dehydro is introduced to estimate the possibility of cracking, and a lower value means C3H7 species tend to have a higher possibility to have C–C bond cleavage relative to further dehydrogenation. A similar descriptor was used in previous hydrogenation reaction studies. (63−66) According to the results in Table 3, C3H7 is much less likely to undergo C–C bond cleavage on Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2, since the Ea, C–C cleav – Ea, dehydro value is significantly lower on Cr/ZrO2 (0.27 eV) than on Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 (0.88 eV). This is in accordance with the reduced coke formation and higher propylene selectivity found on 5% Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 during the reaction (Figure 3).

  Cr/ZrO2 Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2
Ea, dehydro 0.80 2.12
Ea, C–C cleav 1.07 3.00
Ea, C–C cleav – Ea, dehydro 0.27 0.88
In order to understand the effect of Ce on catalyst stability, the spent 5%Cr/ZrO2 and 5%Cr/Ce0.2Zr0.8O2 catalysts were investigated by temperature-programed oxidation (TPO) in 10%O2. As shown in Figure 10, weight loss was observed for both catalysts, suggesting coke deposition on the catalyst during the CO2-ODH reaction. Specifically, the spent 5%Cr/ZrO2 catalyst has 5.3 wt % coke deposited, while the Ce doped catalyst only has 2.5 wt % coke deposition. This shows that doping of Ce inhibits coke formation, which results in enhanced catalyst stability. Furthermore, as the direct dehydrogenation of propane over Cr3+ active sites is the primary reaction pathway based on our experimental results and DFT calculations, the catalyst deactivation is likely mainly caused by coke deposition, given that Cr3+ remained after the CO2-ODH reaction. Catalyst reactivation can be achieved by removing the deposited coke with oxygen. The regenerated catalyst exhibits similar catalytic performance, particularly during extended reaction time (Figure S8).

4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In summary, effective CexZr1–xO2-supported CrOx catalysts have been developed with high selectivity and enhanced stability for CO2-ODH of propane. Comprehensive characterizations identified that the as-prepared catalysts consist of both monomeric and polymeric CrOx species at 6+ and 3+ oxidation states. Under the reaction conditions, Cr6+ is easily reduced, and activity is maintained when the catalyst is pre-reduced (removing the Cr 6+), indicating that Cr3+ is the active site in CO2-ODH reactions. An in situ DRIFTS study, coupled with DFT calculations, suggests that the reaction proceeds via a direct dehydrogenation pathway. Ce doping modifies the electronic structure of supported Cr3+, increasing the energy barrier for C–C bond breakage. This inhibits the selectivity toward byproducts. Besides the enhanced propylene selectivity, Ce doping reduces coke formation by as much as 50% compared to undoped ZrO2-supported Cr catalysts, leading to substantially enhanced catalyst stability.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
