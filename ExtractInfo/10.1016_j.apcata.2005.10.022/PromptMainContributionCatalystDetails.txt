Synthesis of ZSM-48 zeolites and their catalytic performance in C4-olefin cracking reactions
Abstract
ZSM-48 zeolite samples with a series of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios were synthesized in the hydrothermal system of Na2O–SiO2–Al2O3–H2N(CH2)6NH2 (HDA). The samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction, N2 adsorption, scanning electron microscopy, temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia, thermo-gravimetric analysis and chemical analysis. Both the OH−/SiO2 and SiO2/Al2O3 ratios played key roles for the formation of pure ZSM-48. C4-olefin cracking reactions were carried out on these ZSM-48 zeolites to produce propylene. Compared with currently used HZSM-5 zeolite, HZSM-48 zeolite exhibits a more excellent selectivity for the aimed olefins, especially for those with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratios. The difference of catalytic performance of HZSM-48 and HZSM-5 zeolites for the cracking of C4-olefin can be attributed to their different acidities. The influences of reaction temperature and liquid hour space velocity on the catalytic performance of the HZSM-48 catalysts were investigated. The reasons for the deactivation of HZSM-48 zeolite in C4-olefin cracking reactions were also studied.
1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important basic organic products; we presently face a serious squeeze in the petrochemical industry as a result of the huge growth in propylene derivatives, e.g., polypropylene. However, the traditional methods for enhancing propylene yield are not satisfactory. For example [1], [2], the naphtha steam cracking process, which produces about twice as much ethylene as propylene is an expensive way because of the high capital investment and the high value of the feedstock. Propane dehydrogenation could give a high yield of propylene, but the feedstock is only cost effective during limited periods of the year, making the process expensive and limiting the production of propylene. Propylene could also be generated in FCC units but its yield in this process is relatively low. And the route for producing propylene from metathesis of ethylene and butylenes is an unengaging way, since it will consume the same highly valuable ethylene as the main feedstock. Thus, the development of the more reasonable processes for high yield of propylene was desired. One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to integrate the propylene production process into refinery or petrochemical plants, starting from a less valuable feedstock, such as catalytic cracking of mixed C4-olefin or higher carbon olefins [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8].
Because of the uniform micropore size and controllable surface acidity, zeolites with the medium pore size [larger than the diameter of C4-olefin (0.51 nm) and smaller than the size of coke precursors] were being studied for use as the effective catalysts in C4-olefin cracking reaction [4], [5], [6], [9]. ZSM-48 zeolite, first synthesized by Chu [10] in 1983, was one of the prospective candidates for this reaction because of its unique framework structure and uninterpenetrating linear 10-membered ring channels (0.53 nm × 0.56 nm). In a previous patent, Rollmann and Valyocsik [11] reported a method for synthesizing ZSM-48 using a diamine with 4–12 carbons or a mixture of an amine with 2–12 carbons and a tetramethylammonium compound as the directing agent. However, the lack or absence of aluminum in their framework often resulted in the low activity in the acidic catalytic reaction. Li et al. [12] synthesized ZSM-48 with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios successfully in a solid system using H2N(CH2)6NH2 (HDA) as template, but the too long reaction time (more than 18 days) and the high reaction temperature (453–473 K) limited the practical application of such route. In the present paper, a series of ZSM-48 zeolites with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios were synthesized in the hydrothermal system of Na2O–SiO2–Al2O3–HDA and their catalytic performance in C4-olefin cracking reaction was investigated in detail. The results showed that HZSM-48 with SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of ca. 200 was an effective catalyst for the cracking of C4-olefin to produce high yields of propylene.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
ZSM-48 with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios were synthesized hydrothermally in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave with the capacity of 100 ml. Typically, 0.80 g of Al2(SO4)3·18H2O were added into the mixture containing 180 g of distilled water, 2.97 g of NaOH, 0.9 ml of H2SO4 (98%) and 26.2 g of HDA under stirring, then, 75 g of colloidal silica (40% SiO2) was added. After being aged at room temperature for 2 h, the mixture was transferred into an autoclave and crystallized at 433 K. The products were filtered, washed and dried at 393 K in air for several hours and then, calcined at 873 K for 3 h. Ion exchange was carried out with 5 wt.% NH4NO3 solution at 353 K for 2 h. The mixture of 85 wt.% NH4ZSM-48 was extruded with 15 wt.% SiO2 and then, calcined at 873 K for 3 h, the HZSM-48 catalyst was thus obtained.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Rigaku D/max-400 X-ray diffractometer with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation over 2θ angles ranging from 5 to 50° and the tube voltage and the current were 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. BET surface areas of the catalysts were measured by the nitrogen adsorption method using a Tristar 3000 apparatus (Micromeritics Corp., USA). Before measurements, the samples were dried in situ at 450 °C for 3 h under vacuum. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was carried out in a XL30E apparatus with the accelerated voltage of 20 or 25 kV. The chemical composition of HZSM-48 was performed on P-4010/ICP-AES apparatus. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted in air in the temperature range 323–1123 K (20 K min−1) in a TA4000 apparatus. 27Al MAS NMR was obtained on a Bruker AMX-400 spectrometer at a spinning speed of 4 k MHz with a pulse of 0.5 μs and a pulse interval of 60 s. Al(H2O)63+ was used as the reference.
The acidity of the catalysts was determined by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) using a conventional flow apparatus equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The load amount of sample was 100 mg with particle sizes of 20–40 mesh. After being flushed with He (25 ml min−1) at 873 K for 60 min, the sample was exposed in a mixed gas of 9 vol.% of NH3 in He at room temperature for ammonia adsorption and then flushed with pure He at 423 K until the TCD baseline remained unchanged. Afterwards, NH3-TPD was promptly warmed at a heating rate of 10 K min−1 to 873 K. The desorbed ammonia was detected on the TCD and then trapped in a 0.01N H2SO4 aqueous standard solution. The amount of trapped ammonia was determined by titrating the excess of H2SO4 in the NH3-trapped solution with a 0.01N standard NaOH solution to estimate the total acid quantity quantitatively. The distribution of the acidity on the ZSM-48 was deconvolved by simulating the TPD plots through Gaussian curves [13], [14], [15].
The coke content of the used catalysts was determined by combustion in a thermo-gravimetric analyzer. Samples were first heated to 623 K in a nitrogen flow of 30 ml min−1, until no more weight loss occurred. Then, a stream of 50 ml min−1 of air was passed through the samples and the temperature was raised to 973 K at 10 K min−1. The weight loss between 623 and 973 K was recorded as coke content.
2.3. Catalytic test
C4-olefin, obtained from Shanghai Petrochemical Company, was used as reactants without further purification. The cracking of C4-olefin test was carried out in a continuous flow fixed-bed system with a stainless steel tubular reactor (Ø 10 mm × 530 mm) equipped with a laboratory-scale piston pump for C4-olefin input. The amount of the catalyst is 1.85 g. The reaction was conducted at preset temperatures under a total pressure of 0.1 MPa. Prior to the experiments, the catalyst was in situ heated at the ramp rate of 5 K min−1 to the reaction temperature in N2 flow (100 ml min−1) and maintained at this temperature for 2 h. Then, the N2 was switched to the feed mixture of 88.67 wt.% butylenes and 11.33 wt.% butanes. The output products were analyzed online on an HP 4890 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The conversions of C4-olefin, selectivity and yields of the products are calculated by one of the following equations:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis of ZSM-48
3.1.1. Influence of the composition of reactant mixture
The OH−/SiO2 ratio in the reactant gel played a key role for the formation of ZSM-48 zeolite. When the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio was kept at 210, the different OH−/SiO2 ratios would result in different products (Table 1). If the OH−/SiO2 ratio was below 0.05, the crystallinity of the as-synthesized ZSM-48 samples was very low and a great deal of amorphous products was observed in the product (Fig. 1a). On the contrary, if the OH−/SiO2 ratio was above 0.09, the as-synthesized products were the mixtures of ZSM-5, ZSM-48 and α-SiO2 (Fig. 1c). Only when the OH−/SiO2 ratio was between 0.05 and 0.09 could pure ZSM-48 with high crystallinity be obtained (Fig. 1b). Another factor that would significantly influence the products was the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the reactant mixtures. When the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio in the reactant mixtures was below 200, it was difficult to obtain the pure ZSM-48 products at any OH−/SiO2 ratios. However, when the SiO2/Al2O3 ratio was elevated to 400, pure ZSM-48 crystal could be easily obtained even at the OH−/SiO2 ratio up to 0.16 (e.g., Table 1, sample 10).

3.1.2. Influence of salts and ZSM-48 seeds
Nucleation and crystallization are two successive steps in the formation of zeolite. In order to shorten the synthesis time and to raise the crystallinity of zeolite, one of the effective ways is to add seed crystal or salts into the reaction mixtures. Here, the effects of salts and ZSM-48 seed crystal on products were investigated. The addition of salt is not beneficial for the formation of ZSM-48 zeolite. When 10 wt.% of NaCl or NaF was added, only ZSM-5 zeolite could be obtained (Table 1, samples 11 and 12). Contrarily, when 10 wt.% of seed crystal of ZSM-48 was added into the reaction mixtures, pure ZSM-48 with high crystallinity was obtained in a short reaction time in good yield (Table 1, sample 13).
3.2. Catalyst characterization
3.2.1. Structural properties
The XRD patterns of the as-synthesized ZSM-48 zeolite prepared in the gel with SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of 210, 350 and 400 (samples 5, 8 and 9 in Table 1) show the exact same characteristic lines (e.g., Fig. 1b for sample 5) as that of ZSM-48 zeolite reported in patent [11] and their SiO2/Al2O3 ratios are found to be 200, 272 and 331 through chemical analysis, respectively. Their BET-specific surface areas were measured by N2 adsorption (Table 2) and all samples exhibit high specific surface areas of about 300 m2 g−1, proving that three of the ZSM-48 samples possess high crystallinity.

3.2.2. TGA
The TGA curve of as-synthesized sample 5 is displayed in Fig. 2, which shows two main regions of weight loss at 343–573 and 573–923 K, corresponding to the loss of adsorbed water and the decomposition/combustion of HDA existing in the pores of as-synthesized ZSM-48 sample, respectively. The weight loss of HDA of sample 5 is about 5.0 wt.%. There was almost no further weight loss in the TGA curve of sample 5 when the temperature was over 873 K, indicating that the template in ZSM-48 could well be removed after calcination at this temperature.

3.2.3. SEM
The SEM images of samples 5, 8 and 9 are shown in Fig. 3. It can be seen that all samples are well crystallized with absence of amorphous materials and impurities. Sample 5 contains corolla-like aggregates of small rod-like crystals 1–2 μm in length and 0.8 μm in width, the typical morphology of ZSM-48 given in a previous report [16], while those with higher SiO2/Al2O3 ratios (samples 8 and 9) mainly exhibit a discrete rod-like (or needle-like) morphology, similar to the morphology of siliceous ZSM-48 described by Chu [10] and Rollmann and Valyocsik [11]. The individual rods of sample 8 are about 4–5 μm in length and 1–2 μm in diameter and the individual rods of sample 9 are about 2–5 μm long and 0.2–1 μm in diameter.

3.2.4. NH3-TPD
The acidities of the samples were measured by NH3-TPD experiment and the TPD curves were deconvoluted into individual desorption peaks of Gaussian shape (Fig. 4). The resulting peaks were classified and grouped into two types of acid sites with different acidity strength, i.e., weak and strong, according to the temperature of the peak maximum. The temperature range for the peak maxima of the weak acid sites was set between 423 and 550 K and for the strong acid sites above ∼600 K. Table 3 lists the distribution of acid sites with different strength estimated from the deconvolution of the TPD plots with Gaussian curve. The total acid amounts in Table 3 were obtained by titrating the H2SO4 solution after absorbing the effluent NH3 from the TPD apparatus. With the increasing of SiO2/Al2O3 ratios, the total acid amount monotonously decreased, while the relative ratio of strong acid sites slightly increased. From Table 3, it can be seen that the total quantities of acid sites obtained by titration method (AT) are larger than the aluminum content ([Al]) obtained from elemental analysis. Such deviation has also been found in other zeolites, e.g., fresh HZSM-5 [13]. Furthermore, one can also notice that the amount of desorbed ammonia of the high-temperature peak (AS) is almost the same as the [Al], so the deviation between AT and [Al] may mainly result from the amount of desorbed ammonia of the low-temperature peak (AW). It is well known that the amount of desorbed ammonia of the low-temperature peak is greatly affected by the experimental conditions of the TPD-tests and some debate still exists upon whether the ammonia of the low-temperature peak corresponds to actual weak acid sites or to physical adsorption. The NH3-TPD profile of HZSM-5 with SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 200 is shown in Fig. 4d for comparison. Fig. 4 shows clearly that the temperature of desorption peak corresponding to strong acid sites in ZSM-5 is higher than that in ZSM-48, indicating that the acidity strength of ZSM-5 is stronger than that of ZSM-48.

3.3. Catalytic results of C4-olefin cracking
3.3.1. Effect of SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratios
Three typical samples with the SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of 200 (sample 5), 272 (sample 8) and 331 (sample 9) were adopted to investigate the catalytic performances of ZSM-48 zeolite on C4-olefin cracking reaction. Table 4 and Fig. 5a display the C4-olefin conversion, product distribution and yields of each product, respectively. Although some by-products from secondary side reactions, e.g., olefin oligomerization and hydrogen transfer reaction, were observed, all the HZSM-48 catalysts tend to produce propylene, one of the primary products in C4-olefin cracking reactions. With the increasing of the aluminum content, both the conversion and the yield of the desired propylene product increase. Sample 5 with the lowest SiO2/Al2O3 exhibits the highest conversion and propylene yield. Comparing with the data of acidic properties in Fig. 4 and Table 3, one easily sees that the reaction performance of the catalysts depends on their surface acidity. The results of our previous research [4] showed that although the weak acid sites remained almost unchanged, the catalytic activity decreased greatly with the decreasing of strong acid sites. So, it can be concluded that it is the strong acid sites that play the key role in the reaction of C4 cracking. Fig. 5b shows that the conversion of C4-olefin almost linearly increases with the quantity of strong sites in the zeolite catalysts.

3.3.2. Influence of reaction temperature
The influences of reaction temperature on the catalytic reaction were investigated. Fig. 6a shows the influence of reaction temperature on the activity and selectivity of the C4-olefin cracking reaction over sample 5. Within the range of our experiment, propylene was the product with the highest yield and the high reaction temperatures are favorable for both the conversion of C4-olefin and the selectivity to propylene, leading to the improvement of the propylene yield (Fig. 6b). C5+ are the products of polymerization of C4-olefin polymerizations, while propane and butane are the products of hydrogen transfer reactions of propylene and butylenes [17]. Fig. 6b shows that the yields of C5+ products, propane and butanes all decrease with the increasing of reaction temperature, indicating that the high temperature is unfavorable for polymerization and hydrogen transfer reaction. The previously calculated equilibrium constants [18] also showed the same conclusions.

3.3.3. Influence of liquid space velocity
Table 5 lists the effect of liquid hour space velocity (LHSV) of the feed on C4-olefin cracking over sample 5. Although the conversion of C4-olefin gradually decreases with the increasing of the LHSV, the selectivity of propylene always increases. It can be attributed to the reduction of secondary side reactions, such as propylene hydrogen transfer reaction at such a short contact time. This conclusion can be also proved by the decreasing of the selectivity to propane, the product of the hydrogen transfer reaction of propylene at high LHSV (Table 5).

3.3.4. Comparison of catalytic performances of HZSM-48 and HZSM-5
For comparison, the cracking of C4-olefin over HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 ratio = 200) is also investigated. As shown in Table 6, the conversion of C4-olefin over HZSM-5 is higher than that over HZSM-48 with the same SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, while the selectivity and yield of propylene over HZSM-5 are lower than those over HZSM-48. The phenomena can be well explained from the different acidity values of these two samples (Fig. 4). Although the acid sites with stronger strength in HZSM-5 will help the conversion of C4-olefin, they also cause the formation of the products from the hydrogen transfer reaction, e.g., ethane, propane and butane. Moreover, because of the existence of the stronger acid sites in HZSM-5, HZSM-5 presents a remarkable coking tendency compared with HZSM-48. The coke contents of HZSM-48 and HZSM-5 are 4.3 and 5.4 wt.% after cracking for 5 days, respectively. Therefore, ZSM-48 would be the more attractive catalyst for the production of propylene due to its appropriate acidity.

3.3.5. Regenerative performance of HZSM-48
A regeneration experiment of sample 5 was conducted in order to find out the cause for the deactivation of HZSM-48 in C4-olefin cracking reactions. The activity of deactivated sample 5 can recover completely after being calcined at 823 K in air for 3 h (Table 7). The states of the aluminum atoms in fresh and used HZSM-48 samples were also characterized by 27Al MAS NMR spectra, an effective technique used to identify states of the aluminum atoms in zeolites [19], [20], [21], [22]. Although neither sample showed the resonance at 0 ppm corresponding to the EFAL, as shown in Fig. 7, the peak shapes in 27Al NMR for the fresh and used HZSM-48 showed some differences. Compared to the fresh HZSM-48, the peak shape of used HZSM-48 showed a relatively broader and lower resonance at 55 ppm and the spectrum of used HZSM-48 indicated reduced intensities. These findings can be explained by the invisibility of the aluminum species in the NMR spectrum due to larger quadrupole couplings [23], [24]. However, this kind of minor variation of 27Al NMR did not affect the recovery of the activity of deactivated ZSM-48 at all. According to the above results, one can conclude that coking is the main reason for the deactivation of HZSM-48 in C4-olefin cracking reaction.

4. Conclusions
A series of ZSM-48 samples with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios were synthesized in the hydrothermal system of Na2O–SiO2–Al2O3–HDA and their catalytic performances in the C4-olefin cracking reactions were investigated. OH−/SiO2 and SiO2/Al2O3 ratios in the reaction mixtures are the key factors that affect the crystallinity and purity of ZSM-48. The addition of salts, such as NaCl and NaF does not favor the synthesis of ZSM-48, while the addition of seed crystal can shorten the crystal time. HZSM-48 with relative lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratio possesses appropriate acidity for C4-olefin cracking to produce high yield of propylene. The effects of reaction temperature and liquid hour space velocity on the catalytic performance of HZSM-48 catalysts were investigated; the results indicated that high temperature and high LHSV were favorable for the production of propylene with high selectivity. The results of comparative experiments of C4-olefin cracking over ZSM-48 and ZSM-5 showed that ZSM-48 would be more attractive than ZSM-5 for the production of propylene due to its appropriate acidity. Coking was the main reason for the deactivation of HZSM-48 in C4-olefin cracking reactions.
