Chapter Four - Boron compounds for catalytic applications
Abstract
Boron-based catalysts are playing key role in synthetic chemistry for variety of chemical transformations to produce products ranging from commodity chemicals to selective pharmaceuticals. In synthetic chemistry hydrocarbon processing e.g. oxidation, reduction, selective hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, isomerization and polymerization are very important. Nowadays, it is almost impossible to drive any industrial chemical process without catalysts. Cheaper earth-abundant catalysts urge to replace the inherited high-cost noble metals-based catalysts. Therefore, boron-based catalysts are potentially cost-effective candidates to switch the conventional expansive catalysts. The primary focus of the current study is to get an overview of the contributions of boron-based compounds as catalysts. Chemically, boron is a strong Lewis acid having an empty p-orbital and is electrophilic, which forms coordinate covalent bonds with nucleophiles. Applications of boron-based compounds as Frustrated Lewis Pairs (FLPs) catalysts which are combination of Lewis acidic and basic p-block species and sterically incapable to neutralize each other's reactivity through adduct formation, have become an attractive strategy in the field of catalysis. This chapter briefly introduces the basics of catalysis with the focus on heterogeneous catalysis of boron-based compounds, which is dynamic toolbox in synthetic chemistry. Common synthetic strategies of boron-based catalysts are also discussed as they are being applied in a growing number of transformations by performing comparably or even better than the gold standard catalysts and have gained special attention in photo-, electro- and thermal catalysis.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
