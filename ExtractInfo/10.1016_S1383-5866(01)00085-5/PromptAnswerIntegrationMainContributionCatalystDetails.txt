The given document discusses the development of H2-selective SiO2 membranes for propane dehydrogenation, but does not provide details on a specific catalyst that represents a main scientific contribution for enhancing propane dehydrogenation performance. The focus is on the membrane development and testing. Since the document does not contain information about a catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, I have indicated that it is not relevant in the XML output.

The supplied document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on the development of a H2-selective SiO2 membrane for potential use in membrane reactors, but does not provide details on any specific propane dehydrogenation catalyst or process. The document mainly discusses the preparation and characterization of the SiO2 membrane. While it mentions testing the membrane for propane dehydrogenation, it does not go into details on the catalyst used or evaluate catalyst performance. Since the document does not contain information directly related to advancements in propane dehydrogenation catalysts or processes, I have indicated that it is not relevant.

The given document does not focus on propane dehydrogenation specifically. It discusses the development of a H2-selective SiO2 membrane for catalytic dehydrogenation in general. Propane dehydrogenation is only briefly mentioned as an example application, but no catalyst details or performance data related to propane dehydrogenation are provided. The main scientific contribution is the development of the H2-selective membrane, not a propane dehydrogenation catalyst.

The given document discusses the development of a H2-selective SiO2-membrane for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. However, it does not provide any details about the catalyst used for propane dehydrogenation. The focus is on the membrane for hydrogen removal rather than the catalyst. Therefore, this document is not relevant for extracting information about propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

Based on reviewing the document, it does not contain information directly related to propane dehydrogenation catalysts or processes. The document focuses on the development of H2-selective SiO2 membranes for propane dehydrogenation reactors. While propane dehydrogenation is mentioned as an application, the core of the research is on the membrane technology rather than catalysis. No specific propane dehydrogenation catalyst is discussed in detail. Therefore, I have indicated this is not relevant and did not include the detailed catalyst information in my output.
