The given document does not focus on propane dehydrogenation specifically. It discusses the development of a H2-selective SiO2 membrane for catalytic dehydrogenation in general. Propane dehydrogenation is only briefly mentioned as an example application, but no catalyst details or performance data related to propane dehydrogenation are provided. The main scientific contribution is the development of the H2-selective membrane, not a propane dehydrogenation catalyst.
