The given document discusses the development of a H2-selective SiO2-membrane for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. However, it does not provide any details about the catalyst used for propane dehydrogenation. The focus is on the membrane for hydrogen removal rather than the catalyst. Therefore, this document is not relevant for extracting information about propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
