Based on reviewing the document, it does not contain information directly related to propane dehydrogenation catalysts or processes. The document focuses on the development of H2-selective SiO2 membranes for propane dehydrogenation reactors. While propane dehydrogenation is mentioned as an application, the core of the research is on the membrane technology rather than catalysis. No specific propane dehydrogenation catalyst is discussed in detail. Therefore, I have indicated this is not relevant and did not include the detailed catalyst information in my output.
