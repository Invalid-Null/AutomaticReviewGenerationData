The supplied document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on the development of a H2-selective SiO2 membrane for potential use in membrane reactors, but does not provide details on any specific propane dehydrogenation catalyst or process. The document mainly discusses the preparation and characterization of the SiO2 membrane. While it mentions testing the membrane for propane dehydrogenation, it does not go into details on the catalyst used or evaluate catalyst performance. Since the document does not contain information directly related to advancements in propane dehydrogenation catalysts or processes, I have indicated that it is not relevant.
