Development of a H2-selective SiO2-membrane for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane
Abstract
Commercial alumina ceramic tubes of asymmetric cross section were used as supports for the deposition of SiO2 layers by the sol–gel technique. The SiO2 gel layer has been built up on the γ-alumina ultrafiltration (UF)-layer of the support by dip-coating with a SiO2-polymer sol. The sol was prepared by a two-step acidic-base hydrolysis of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) in alcoholic solution with a relative low content of water (H2O:TEOS=4.3:1). The following step of hydrolysis and condensation was varied by different amounts of NH4OH. These sols of lowly branched SiO2 polymers with 60–70% Q3 units were used for dip-coating. After drying (2 h at ambient temperature) the membranes have been calcined at 600°C. The resulting membranes show hydrogen fluxes ≥20 m3(STP)/m2 h bar and permselectivities hydrogen:propane between 30 and 75 in a temperature region of 450–550°C. The membranes were tested in membrane supported propane dehydrogenation. The propene yield in the membrane reactor can be higher than in a conventional fixed-bed reactor if the hydrogen is removed by a H2-selective membrane. After several regeneration cycles, stable and acceptable membrane properties are found.
1. Introduction
The properties of inorganic membranes such as thermal stability, solvent and chemical resistance, sterilization ability and biocompatibility allow new applications in high temperature gas separation and recovery of solvent mixtures by pervaporation. More challenging concepts are the use of sophisticated inorganic membranes in fuel cells and in catalytic membrane reactors. The progress achieved in the rapidly growing field of inorganic membranes is reflected by a number of recent overviews [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8].
Chemical membrane reactors offer a potential application for newly developed inorganic membranes. However, despite numerous successful demonstrations of membrane reactors in the laboratory scale, up to now no large scale technical membrane reactor could be realised. Main hurdles are insufficient properties of the available membranes (limited fluxes and selectivities, poor mechanical stability). Extensive overviews concerning the present state of the development of membrane reactors were recently published [9], [10], [11], [12]. In a membrane-assisted chemical reaction the yield of an equilibrium controlled reaction can be increased by the ‘drain off’ of the products by a selective membrane. It was shown in several papers that the use of H2-selective membranes can increase the yield of dehydrogenation [13], [14], [15], [16], [17].
In our study, the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is used as a model reaction. A membrane which is suitable for this reaction has to show a preferred hydrogen transport and, furthermore, a stability at the reaction temperature. In contrast to [18], [19] we prepared our membranes on tubular alumina supports with higher membrane areas (55 cm2) instead using flat plates. In this paper we report the preparation of H2-selective SiO2 membranes with improved fluxes and stability in the absence at 535°C which is a typical temperature for the catalytic propane dehydrogenation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Membrane preparation and characterization
Ceramic alumina filter membranes of tubular geometry (length 300 mm, inner/outer diameters approximately 7/10 mm, from the Hermsdorfer Institut für Technische Keramik, hitk, Hermsdorf, Germany) have been used as supports. Table 1 gives the multi-layer structure of the asymmetric membrane.

1st layer α-Al2O3 1 μm 25 μm

3rd layer Micro/ultrafiltration α-Al2O3 60 nm 25 μm

5th layer Nanofiltration/ gas-separation SiO2 ≤1 nm ca. 100 nm
a
Pore radii at 50% of the pore volume (d50 data).
For molecular separations the pores of the ultrafiltration membranes have to be narrowed to a size ≤1 nm. Usual techniques for this pore narrowing are the sol–gel technique [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], CVD/CVI methods [24], [25], [26], [27], crystallisation of zeolite layers [2], [7], [8] or a chemical modification of the pore walls [28].
In this paper we applied the sol–gel technique. It is known that the fluxes and selectivities of metal oxide membranes are strongly affected by the parameters of the sol–gel process. In particular the degree of branching of the polymeric metal oxides turned out to be very important for the pore sizes. Furthermore, it is known that lowly branched inorganic polymers lead to gels which can result in membranes with a smaller mean pore size [19], [29], [30], [31]. SiO2 polymer sols were prepared by acid catalysed hydrolysis of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) in alcoholic solution. The SiO2 gel layers were deposited by a dip-coating technique. The polymeric SiO2 sol was sucked into the vertically positioned tubes by means of reduced pressure. After a defined contact time of a few seconds, Argon was slowly dosed and — following gravity — the sol flow out of the tube at a defined velocity. After drying at ambient temperature for 2 h, the membranes were calcined at 600°C. Table 2 shows characteristic parameters of the sol–gel technique applied.

Velocity of the sol flowing out of the tubes 3–6 mm s−1

To characterise the sols, 29Si NMR spectra were recorded on an Unity Plus 500 (Varian). Scanning electron microscopy with a cold field emission electrode (FE-SEM) was made by a Hitachi S 4100 device at 3 kV without Au coating. Simultaneously, the element composition could be recorded by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX line scan).
2.2. Permeation measurements
The silica membranes have been tested in single component permeation studies of H2 and propane. In the beginning of the instationary single component experiment, the shell side of the tube was evacuated and the flux of the test gases from the tube to the shell side was recorded by the pressure increase with time in the shell side of the membrane. All single gas measurements took place at a mean pressure of 600 mbar. From the single component fluxes, the permselectivities as the ratio of the single component fluxes have been derived.
2.3. Catalytic tests
Propane was catalytically dehydrogenated on a commercial Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst at a temperature of 535°C. The pelletized catalyst was contained on the tube side of the membrane. Pure propane was used as feed and nitrogen as sweep gas for the H2 removal on the shell side of the membrane. The H2-rich permeate was transported by the sweep gas N2 into the GC. The sweep: feed ratio was 6.7 in all cases. The WHSV of the reaction was 1.1 h−1. Due to coking, the catalyst had to be regenerated. This was performed without removing the catalyst from the membrane tube at 450°C by 3% oxygen in nitrogen (14 h).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Membrane development
Fig. 1 shows a cross section of the asymmetric tubular alumina membrane with the SiO2 top layer prepared following the procedure given in Table 2. The γ-Al2O3 layer is completely covered by a very homogeneous nearly 100 nm thick SiO2 gel layer. However, the EDX analysis (Fig. 2) shows that SiO2 is penetrated into the γ-Al2O3 layer as well. In addition to the Si signal due to the SiO2 gel layer on the support, the recorded EDX spectra reveal that there is an Si gradient across the γ-Al2O3 and α-Al2O3 layers of the support. Obviously, the SiO2 polymer sol species penetrate into the γ-Al2O3 layer during the dip-coating.

Fig. 3 shows the temperature dependence of the single gas fluxes of hydrogen and propane as well as the permselectivity as the calculated ratio of the single component fluxes. The hydrogen flux increases with increasing temperature due to an activated diffusion mechanism in the narrow pores of the SiO2 gel layer. For hydrogen, the contribution of adsorption to the permeative mass transport can be neglected at elevated temperatures. In contrast, the propane flux is effected by adsorption and a certain surface mobility. Due to the contrary temperature effects of adsorption and diffusion on the permeation, these effects compensate and only a slight temperature influence is found.

3.2. Influence of the sol properties on the permselectivities H2:C3H8
It is known that lowly branched inorganic polymers lead to gels and membranes with smaller pore size. We used 29Si-NMR for characterizing the degree of branching. Fig. 4 shows the 29Si NMR of a highly concentrated (12%SiO2) SiO2-sol which was used after diluting afterwards for membrane preparation by dip-coating. There are only a few Q2 and Q4 Si-species indicating lowly and highly branched silica species, respectively. Most Si-species are present as Q3–Si (δ∼−101 ppm). The quantitative ratios between Q2:Q3:Q4 were determined to be 19:66:15%. We found that silica sols with a finger-print-like Si spectrum as shown in Fig. 4 show best permselectivities and high H2 fluxes at T>400°C.

Measuring time: 18 h on a Unity Plus 500 (The proton resonance frequency of 500 MHz corresponds to a 29Si resonance frequency of 99.30 MHz.). Sixty-six±five percent of the Si are present as so called Q3 units R-(Si-O-Si)3 with R standing for OEt and OH. Chemical shift relative to tetramethylsilane.
The strongly acid starting sol (pH<1.0) was diluted for dip-coating with pure ethanol or an ammonia/ethanol solution. These solutions with different pH were used for dip-coating to produce a silica layer on the γ-alumina UF support. As shown in Fig. 5, the permselectivities H2: propane increase with higher pH-values. For a better mechanical stability of the attachment of the SiO2 layer to the alumina support, two of the supports were modified by reaction with tetramethylsilicate. This procedure has no negative effect on the permselectivity (see Fig. 5).

3.3. Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane in a membrane reactor
Fig. 6 shows that the propene yield can be increased if the hydrogen is continuously removed by a membrane. However, the following observations have been made:
•
The yield in the membrane reactor is only higher than in the reference experiment if a membrane with a permselectivity H2: propane >25 and a propane flux <0.5 m3(STP)/m−hbar is used. For membranes with lower permselectivities, a great part of propane can leave the reactor through the membrane unreacted, e.g. up to 25% by a propane flux of 1 m3(STP)/m2hbar) and, as a consequence, the yield becomes lower.
•
The propene selectivity of the propane dehydrogenation is in both cases (conventional fixed-bed and membrane reactor) 85–90% at the reaction temperature.
•
The removal of H2 accelerates catalyst deactivation. As Fig. 6 shows, the membrane reactor gives only in the first 350 min time on stream better results than the conventional fixed-bed reactor. After 360 min the catalyst was regenerated by oxidative treatment (3% O2 in N2 at 450°C at 14 h).
•
After regeneration, the hydrogen flux was found to be 5.6 m3(STP)/m2hbar at 535°C which is only 25% of the value of the membrane before regeneration (cf. Fig. 3). However, this flux remained constant in the next three regeneration cycles. The permselectivities H2: propane dropped from initially 72 to a constant value of 25. This behaviour of the membrane is not completely understood.

The membrane under study has been regenerated 3 times. After the 4th regeneration, the yield of the membrane reactor was similar as before (WHSV=1.1 h−1; Vpropane=30 ml min−1).
4. Conclusion
•
The selectivity of SiO2 gel membranes can be fine-tuned by the pH in the preparation of the SiO2 polymer sol. Silica polymer sols with pH=2.7–2.9 gave the best results for hydrogen selective membrane preparation.
•
A certain degree of branching of the SiO2 polymer sol is required. Due to our preparation way, best membrane properties have been obtained with a sol which contains polymeric SiO2 species with 2/3 Q3 units.
•
Such a silica membrane can give better yields in propane dehydrogenation than a conventional fixed-bed reactor at high WHSV value (1.1 h−1). In our case, after a reaction time of 350 min the yield of both reactors is very similar.
•
Regeneration of the catalyst damages the silica membrane and reduces flux and selectivity. However, after several regeneration cycles no further noticeable influence on the membrane behaviour was found.
