 Unfortunately, based on the information provided, none of the documents contain relevant details about a propane dehydrogenation catalyst that represents a main scientific contribution. The documents focus on the development of H2-selective SiO2 membranes rather than advancements in propane dehydrogenation catalysis. Since no specific propane dehydrogenation catalyst details were extracted, I am unable to provide a synthesized summary. The output would indicate no relevance as follows:

<output>
  <Relevance>No</Relevance>
</output>

Please let me know if you are able to provide any documents that do contain detailed information about a propane dehydrogenation catalyst innovation that can be summarized. I'd be happy to synthesize the information in that case according to the provided XML structure.
