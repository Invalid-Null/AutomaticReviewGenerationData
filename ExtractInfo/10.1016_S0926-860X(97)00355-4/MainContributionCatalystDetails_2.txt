 Based on the details provided in the document, this does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses the regeneration and performance of a H-GaMFI zeolite catalyst for propane aromatization. Although propane dehydrogenation occurs as an intermediate step in the aromatization process, the focus is on enhancing aromatics yield rather than specifically improving propane dehydrogenation to propylene.
