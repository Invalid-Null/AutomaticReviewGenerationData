1. Introduction
Propylene is a commercially important component of the petrochemical industry. It is extensively used to produce a wide array of chemicals including polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide and other chemical intermediates [1]. Based on the global demand of petrochemical products from LPG feedstock, the average demand growth rate will be up to 4% per year until 2025 [2]. The dehydrogenation of propane is an attractive on-purpose technology to produce propylene. Furthermore, propane can be obtained from low-cost feedstock such as shale gas deposits, which are now becoming available [3]. However, this process is an endothermic reaction, which requires a relatively high reaction temperature to obtain high yield of propylene. Thus a rapid loss of activity due to the deactivation of catalyst is inevitable.
Pt-based catalysts are currently used in commercial processes because of its excellent activity. Nevertheless, monometallic platinum catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation owing to coke formation [4]. The addition of a secondary metal to form a bimetallic alloy has been studied to suppress coking and increase propylene selectivity. Several reviews have reported that Pt-Sn based catalysts are quite efficient and well-known catalyst for alkane dehydrogenation [5,6]. Although Sn could improve the catalytic performance in terms of activity and selectivity, the catalyst deactivation over time is still remain. Another approach has been the use of non-acidic material as a support to diminish the formation of carbonaceous deposit compared to acidic supports [7,8].
Magnesium aluminum oxide (Mg(Al)Ox) has been proposed as a promising support for Pt-based catalysts because of its moderate basicity and high resistance to sintering [9,10]. The presence of alkaline-earth metals (IIA) in supported Pt-Sn catalyst have some unique properties, thus promoting the catalytic performance [11,12]. Lai Y. et al. [13] discovered adding Mg into the supports resulted in moderate total acidity, weakening the strong acidic sites, and strengthening the interaction between Pt and support. Shi J. et al. [14] reported that suitable content of Mg could enhance the interaction between Sn and support leading to more amounts of tin in oxidized states, which was beneficial to the catalytic performance. Nevertheless, Mg-modified alumina for use as catalyst supports were prepared by various methods including co-precipitation [9], impregnation [14], sol-gel [15], mechanochemical method [16], and hydrothermal method [17]. The structural characteristics and properties of Mg(Al)Ox depended largely on the synthesis routes, and as a consequence has a distinctive effect on their catalytic behaviors. Notably, most of the synthesis methods of Mg(Al)Ox for use as supports for Pt-based catalysts, calcination step is necessary as a post-synthesis treatment. A few researchers have explored the effect of calcination temperature of Mg(Al)Ox as a support for dehydrogenation reaction. For example, Shen L.-L. et al. [18] illustrated that increasing calcination temperature of support from 600 to 900 °C contributed to the decrease in specific surface area leading to the accumulation of Pt particles, which is disadvantageous to the reaction. To the best of our knowledge, Mg(Al)Ox prepared without calcination has never been employed for preparation of supported Pt-based catalyst for propane dehydrogenation reaction.
Solvothermal process is a one-step synthesis of various metal oxides, which has attracted more attention in many applications. Solvothermal process is simple, template-free and highly flexible route, which provides better control in morphology and structural properties [19,20]. Wannaborworn M. et al. [21] reported that the solvothermal-derived alumina exhibited an excellent performance in ethanol dehydration compared to the commercial one because of its high surface area and suitable acidic properties. In addition, Xiao F. et al. [22] synthesized aluminum magnesium oxide nanocomposites by one-step microwave assisted solvothermal method using in the adsorption of heavy metal ions application. On the other hand, the use of solvothermal technique has seldom been reported in the preparation of Mg(Al)Ox used in the catalytic reaction, especially in the dehydrogenation process. Consequently, this paper describes the effect of synthesis methods of Mg(Al)Ox on the catalytic properties of PtSn/Mg(Al)O catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane. The Mg(Al)Ox supports were prepared by the physically mixing, hydrothermal, and solvothermal methods with and without calcination. PtSn/
-Al2O3 was also prepared and used as a reference. A series of state-of-art characterization techniques were carried out including X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen physisorption, scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and temperature program oxidation (TPO).
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of Mg(Al)Ox
2.1.1. Physical mixing method (Mg(Al)O-mix)
Pure MgO and
-Al2O3 were mixed and ground to a fine powder using a ball mill with a Mg/Al molar ratio = 3. After the grinding process, the obtained powder was sieved and the particle size was smaller than 106 μm. Finally, the solid was dried at 110 °C overnight and calcined at 600 °C for 3 h.
2.1.2. Hydrothermal method (Mg(Al)O-hd)
15.7 g Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and 7.66 g Al(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in 50 mL deionized water. Under stirring, 1.2 g cetyltrimethylammonium bromide was added to the solution and then ammonia aqueous solution (30 wt.%) was dropped to form the viscous liquid until reaching pH 11. The compound was transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave to heat at 180 °C for 24 h. After the autoclave was cooled down, the product was washed with deionized water until wash water was pH 7. Subsequently, the solid was dried at 110 °C overnight and calcined at 600 °C for 3 h.
2.1.3. Solvothermal method (Mg(Al)O-sv and Mg(Al)O-svc)
Magnesium acetylacetonate dihydrate (Mg(CH3COCHCOCH3)2·2H2O) and aluminium isopropoxide (Al(OCH(CH3)2)3)) at molar ratio of 3:1 were dissolved in 100 mL of 1-butanol. After stirring for 30 min, the compound was transferred into an autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and purged with nitrogen gas before heating up to 300 °C and held at that temperature for 2 h. Then, the autoclave was cooled down naturally to room temperature. The obtained powder was washed with ethanol followed by centrifugation and dried at 110 °C overnight. The resultant sample was labeled as Mg(Al)O-sv. For investigating the effect of calcination on the catalytic properties, the dried sample was calcined at 600 °C for 3 h and the corresponding product was labeled as Mg(Al)O-svc.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
The PtSn catalysts supported on different support were prepared by co-impregnation method using the mixture of H2PtCl6·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) and SnCl2·2H2O (Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol solution. After impregnation, the prepared samples were dried in ambient air for 2 h and dried in oven at 110 °C overnight, following by calcination at 550 °C in air for 3 h. The Pt loading was 0.3 wt.% and Sn loading was 0.3 wt.%. For reference, PtSn/
-Al2O3 catalyst was also prepared similarly using
-Al2O3 obtained from calcined boehmite (Pural) at 550 °C for 4 h.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
The textural and physical properties of the catalysts were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 advance with CuKα radiation in the 2
range of 20° to 80°. The specific surface areas, pore sizes and pore volumes were measured by N2 physisorption using Micromeritics Chemisorbs 2750 instrument. Before the measurement, the samples were degassed at 200 °C under nitrogen flow. The specific surface areas were determined by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The measurements of morphology of the catalyst were carried out using JEOL JSM-5800LV scanning Electron Microscope. The TEM images were used to investigate the average particle sizes of the catalyst measured in a JEM-2010 microscope operated at 200 kV. Prior to testing, the reduced samples were dispersed in ethanol by ultrasonic, then a small drop of this solution was placed onto carbon film coated copper grids. The reducibility of catalysts was investigated by H2-TPR technique using Micromeritics Chemisorbs 2750 automated system. The catalyst (0.1 g) was conducted in a quartz U-tube and pretreated under 25 cm3/min of Ar flow at 500 °C for 1 h and cooled down to 50 °C. Then, the catalyst was reduced under 15 cm3/min of 10% H2/Ar flow from 50 to 550 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Finally, TPR profiles as a function of temperatures were recorded using thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The acidity of catalysts was measured by NH3-TPD process. Approximately 0.1 g of sample was placed in a quartz U-tube and pretreated at 500 °C with a He gas flow (25 cm3/min) maintained for 1 h to remove a moisture. After cooling down to 40 °C, the sample was saturated with 15%NH3/He mixed gas flow (25 cm3/min) at this temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, it was purged with a He gas flow for 1 h to desorb the physisorbed ammonia and then heated to 600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The NH3 desorption profiles were detected by using TCD detector. The XPS analysis was performed to determine electronic states of metals and the surface composition of the reduced catalysts. XPS element spectra were carried out using an AMICUS photoelectron spectrometer with a Mg Kα X-ray as a primary excitation and a KRATOS VISION2 software. The coke deposition of spent catalysts was analyzed by TPO experiments using Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatograph equipped. The spent catalyst (0.05 g) was placed in the quartz tube and exposed to 1%O2/He mixed gas flow at a flow rate of 25 cm3/min. The temperature was increased from room temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min.
2.4. Propane dehydrogenation reaction
The propane dehydrogenation was carried out in the stainless steel tubular fixed-bed reactor with internal diameter of 19.05 mm. The catalyst of 2 g was packed into the center of the reactor and pretreated under mixed 1:1 H2/N2 gas flow with a total flow rate of 100 cm3/min at 500 °C for 1 h. The reactor was then heated up to the reaction temperature of 550 °C under N2 gas flow and held for 30 min. Pure propane was fed to the reactor at a flow rate of 20 cm3/min with a WHSV of 1.13 h−1 under atmospheric pressure. The effluent stream was analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (Agilent 7820A) with a packed column HP-PLOT Al2O3 “M” deactivated (50 m with 8
m ID) and a flame ionization detector (FID).
The propane conversion (%) and the propylene selectivity (%) were calculated according to the following formulate:
where
represented the content of propane in feed,
and
represented the content of propane and propylene in the effluent stream, respectively. All the values were calculated in weight percentages.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Propane dehydrogenation results
The catalytic performances of the prepared catalysts in propane dehydrogenation at 550 °C for 5 h time on stream (TOS) are shown in Fig. 1. It can be observed that the PtSn/
-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited a relatively poor activity, selectivity and stability. It showed the initial conversion of 22.6%, after 5 h gradually decreased to 7.2%. Furthermore, the final selectivity of propylene was approximately 87%, which was relatively lower than the other catalysts. In contrast, the presence of Mg(Al)O supports enhanced the activity and stability remarkably. The initial propane conversions for PtSn/Mg(Al)O-mix, PtSn/Mg(Al)O-hd, PtSn/Mg(Al)O-svc, and PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv catalysts were 23.2, 27.8, 26.8 and 27.7%, after 5 h reaction, the final propane conversions were 16.7, 23.3, 25.5 and 27.8%, respectively. It is interesting that PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv catalyst showed a stable propane conversion, while the others exhibited the gradual deactivation due probably to coke formation and/or sintering [23]. The turnover frequencies (TOFs) of the prepared catalysts were determined based on the CO-chemisorption experiments as listed in Table S1. The results display that there was no obvious difference in TOF values for PtSn/Mg(Al)O catalysts. In Fig. 1b, propylene selectivity for all the PtSn/Mg(Al)O catalysts increased progressively with time on stream, which was due to the fact that some active centers catalyzed cracking and hydrogenolysis reactions were poisoned by coke formation [24]. The final propylene selectivities for PtSn/Mg(Al)O-mix, PtSn/Mg(Al)O-hd, PtSn/Mg(Al)O-svc and PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv catalysts were 97.4, 94.8, 97.5, and 96.6%, which were superior to the PtSn/
-Al2O3 catalyst. It is indicated that the use of Mg(Al)O supports could suppress undesired side reactions i.e. cracking and hydrogenolysis reaction, leading to the decrease of the undesirable products. It was clear that the existence of Mg resulted in dominant improvement of catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability where the PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv catalyst exhibited the most satisfactory performance for propane dehydrogenation reaction.

To further demonstrate the stability of the catalyst, a long-term propane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out over the PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv catalyst. As can be seen in Fig. S1, the PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv catalyst showed excellent stability during 20 h of time on stream (the propylene selectivity remain unchanged at around 97%). Moreover, the PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv catalyst was chosen to investigate the regenerability in 3 cycles of reaction-regeneration test. After the first cycle, the catalyst was subjected to the oxidative regeneration treatment in flowing air at 550 °C for 2 h. Then, the reduction step and the next dehydrogenation reaction were performed for 5 h. Fig. S2 illustrates that the PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv catalyst was remarkably stable with high propane conversion (approximately 27%) and propylene selectivity (up to 97%). It indicates that PtSn/Mg(Al)O derived from one-step solvothermal method was highly active, selective and stable catalyst for propane dehydrogenation.
3.2. Characteristics of the PtSn/Mg(Al)O catalysts
The XRD patterns of prepared catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. For PtSn/
-Al2O3, the characteristic peaks at 2
= 37.6°, 45.8° and 66.8° indicating the crystal planes of the
-alumina phase can be seen. Whilst the XRD patterns of PtSn/Mg(Al)O with different preparation methods exhibited periclase (MgO) which located at 2
= 37.2°, 43.1°, 62.4°, 74.7° and 78.7° as a dominant phase. The intensity of diffraction peaks was quite similar, suggesting that there were no significant changes in crystallite size for PtSn/Mg(Al)O catalysts. Moreover, the diffraction peaks of spinel MgAl2O4 were found in the XRD pattern of PtSn/Mg(Al)O-mix. This finding may be due to the solid phase reaction between
-Al2O3 and MgO during the intimate mixing and grinding steps [16]. In addition, the XRD patterns of all the samples displayed no obvious peaks of Pt and Sn species, probably due to well dispersion on the supports and low concentration of these metals.

The textural properties such as specific surface area, pore volume and average pore diameter are reported in Table 1. It can be seen that BET surface area of alumina support was 192 m2/g which was higher than that of Mg(Al)O supports. Adding Mg into support also caused a slightly decrease in pore volume and increase in average pore diameter. Such results implied that addition of Mg may lead to an aggregation of MgO species and block the channels of support [14]. However, there was no remarkable variation in textural properties for Mg(Al)O derived from the different routes. For Mg(Al)O synthesized by solvothermal method, the surface area slightly decreased, whereas the pore volume and pore diameter increased after calcination. This is attributed to the dehydration and aggregation of particles during calcination resulting in structural collapse [25].

Fig. 3 illustrates the morphologies of the catalysts investigated by scanning electron microscopy. The PtSn catalyst supported on
-alumina nanoparticles showed spherical shape with particle size ranging between 20–30
m. On the other hand, PtSn/Mg(Al)O-mix and PtSn/Mg(Al)O-hd were composed of agglomerated primary particles with irregular shape and sizes. Interestingly, PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv and PtSn/Mg(Al)O-svc exhibited flower-like morphology assembled from nanosheets interleaved with each other. According to the previous study by Li G. et al. [25], longer alkyl chain of the used alcohol (i.e. butanol) was favorable for the formation of flower-like hierarchical structure consisted of nanoplates due to its larger steric hindrance. Fig. 3d and e show that calcination process did not modify their morphology, but the plate-like structures slightly became larger to some extent. Similar trend was found in the results of Shen L.-L. et al. [18], the nanoflake structure in catalysts gradually collapsed when calcined at high temperature. As a result, some slit pores were blocked, leading to a decrease in BET surface area. Thus, the surface morphologies of catalysts prepared by solvothermal method with and without calcination are in accordance with BET surface area and the pore volume as listed in Table 1.

The influence of different preparation methods of the support on the reduction behaviors of supported PtSn catalysts was investigated by H2-TPR technique. From Fig. 4, the PtSn/
-Al2O3 catalyst showed three reduction peaks centered at about 202, 351 and 454 °C, respectively. Based on many previous studies [13,26], the first peak appeared at low temperature region (200–250 °C) was assigned to the reduction of platinum oxide species, while the second peak at medium temperature (350–410 °C) and the high-temperature reduction peak at around 454 °C were attributed to the reduction of Sn4+ to Sn2+ and Sn2+ to Sn0, respectively. When incorporated with Mg, the reduction peaks of PtOx shifted to a higher temperature. It suggested a stronger metal-support interaction and also some interaction between Pt and Sn species, leading to the formation of PtSn alloyed phases [27]. For PtSn/Mg(Al)O obtained from hydrothermal and solvothermal routes, the reduction peaks of Pt oxide exhibited smaller peak areas than the others, probably due to smaller Pt particles and higher Pt dispersion [28]. Moreover, the reduction peaks of Sn4+ to Sn2+ shifted towards the higher temperature range and the corresponding peak areas decreased after adding Mg into the support, implying that the interaction of SnOx and the support were also strengthened. In addition, the reduction peaks of Sn2+ to metallic Sn were not clearly apparent, indicating that the existence of Mg may inhibit the complete reduction of Sn0, which is consistent with the previous works [14]. Generally, the oxidation states of Sn have an important role in the catalytic performance for bimetallic PtSn catalyst. It is well established that the oxidized tin species (Sn4+ or Sn2+) act as a promoter, whereas the metal tin (Sn0) acts as a poison [27,29]. Therefore, it can be summarized that introducing Mg into the catalyst resulted in the enhancement of the interaction between Pt, SnOx and support, which have a positive impact on the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation.

-Al2O3, (2) PtSn/Mg(Al)O-mix, (3) PtSn/Mg(Al)O-hd, (4) PtSn/Mg(Al)O-svc and (5) PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv.
The TEM micrographs of the catalysts and their particle size distributions are shown in Fig. 5. The calculated average particle sizes of different catalysts are summarized in Table 2. The results illustrate that the Pt nanoparticles were not well dispersed on the support for PtSn/
-Al2O3 while the PtSn/Mg(Al)O catalysts exhibited smaller average Pt particle sizes, suggesting that the dispersion of Pt particles was also enhanced. This results may be related to the interaction between metal and support in TPR results and the surface properties as discussed below, which further affected the anchoring of platinum particles on the support surface [30]. Thus, in the case of the PtSn/
-Al2O3 catalyst, some large particles may be attributed to the weak metal-support interaction, leading to the agglomeration of platinum during the thermal treatment at high temperature. On the contrary, modified by Mg into the support can effectively improve the metal-support interaction resulting in more uniform Pt particle distribution. As can be seen from Fig. 5, the relatively homogeneous distributions of metallic particles were obtained from PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv and PtSn/Mg(Al)O-svc, which possessed the smallest average Pt particle sizes with similar values (1.13 nm) as listed in Table 2. This results are advantageous to enhance the dehydrogenation activity, which is believed to be catalyzed by small Pt ensembles, while undesirable side reactions such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization and coking reaction require large Pt particles [31,32].

The acidity of the different catalysts was determined by NH3-TPD measurements. The NH3-TPD profiles are displayed in Fig. 6 and the corresponding semi-quantitative results using the Gaussian curve fitting method to deconvolute the ammonia desorption peaks are summarized in Table 3. In general, the ammonia desorption peaks in the temperature ranges of 120–250 °C, 250–400 °C and 400–550 °C were assigned to the weak, medium and strong acid sites, respectively [33]. It can be seen that the PtSn/
-Al2O3 catalyst showed the highest total acidity, which was ascribed to the Lewis acid sites of alumina support [34]. Addition of Mg could obviously decrease the acidity of the catalysts and the degree of reduction depended on the synthesis method. The order of the total desorption peak areas was as follows: PtSn/
-Al2O3 > PtSn/Mg(Al)O-hd > PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv > PtSn/Mg(Al)O-mix > PtSn/Mg(Al)O-svc. It is interesting to note that the correlation between the selectivity of by-products (methane, ethane and ethylene) and the total acidity of the catalysts is almost linear as shown in Fig.7. It suggests that the reduced acidity of catalysts could suppress undesired side reactions and enhance the propylene selectivity. Moreover, the distribution of acidic strength was also changed after adding Mg into the catalysts. It was found that the existence of Mg significantly decreased the ammonia desorption at high temperature, indicating that most of acidity were weak to medium over PtSn/Mg(Al)O catalysts. A declining trend of fraction of strong acid sites (peak V) was in the following order: PtSn/
-Al2O3 (58%) > PtSn/Mg(Al)O-hd (42%) > PtSn/Mg(Al)O-mix (39%) > PtSn/Mg(Al)O-svc (31%) > PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv (25%). Previous studies have been reported that side reactions such as cracking, isomerization and coking were mainly catalyzed by strong acid sites [35]. Among these investigated catalysts, PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv exhibited the lowest fraction of strong acid sites which was beneficial to improve propylene selectivity and stability.

Fig. 8 demonstrates the XPS spectra of Mg2p over the catalysts after reduction which are deconvoluted into two components, corresponding to different Mg species. The first one located around 48.8 eV was ascribed to Mg2+ in periclase MgO structure, whereas the second one centered around 50.5 eV was assigned to Mg2+ interacting strongly with Al, in Mg-O-Al bonds [36]. The results show that there were both types of Mg species for PtSn/Mg(Al)O-mix, on the other hand, PtSn/Mg(Al)O-hd, PtSn/Mg(Al)O-svc and PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv exhibited only Mg2+ in Mg-O-Al bonds. It was reported in the previous works that Mg-O-Al bonds increased the defects on the support surface which served as strong site for Pt loading [14]. Additionally, the Mg and Al surface concentrations on the catalysts and the ratios of Al/Mg are listed in Table 4. It can be seen that PtSn/Mg(Al)O-mix possessed the Al/Mg ratio of 0.48, which was much lower than that of the other catalysts. It indicates that increasing Al/Mg ratio over PtSn/Mg(Al)O-hd, PtSn/Mg(Al)O-svc and PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv may lead to an increase in the formation of Mg-O-Al bonds, which is significant to stabilize the distribution of Pt on the support. Therefore, it is reasonable to mention that the presence of Mg-O-Al bonds plays an important role in enhancing catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation.

The XPS analysis of the reduced catalysts corresponding to Sn3d5/2 region is displayed in Fig. 9. The peak areas of Sn3d5/2 spectra are deconvoluted into three peaks, representing different electronic states of tin. In general, the component at lower binding energy was attributed to the metallic tin (Sn0) [37], whereas the others at higher binding energy were assigned to oxidized tin species (Sn2+ or Sn4+) which were not distinguishable by XPS measurement due to their close BE [38]. Nevertheless, the main purpose of the deconvolution is to differentiate the metallic tin from the oxidized tin species. The peak percentages given in parentheses for all catalysts are summarized in Table 5. It can be seen that most amount of Sn species were in oxidized form which is beneficial to propane dehydrogenation [37]. The proportions of metallic tin for PtSn/
-Al2O3, PtSn/Mg(Al)O-mix, PtSn/Mg(Al)O-hd and PtSn/Mg(Al)O-svc were 17.1, 12.5, 14.4 and 9.3% respectively. This result verifies that Mg addition helps stabilize the oxidized tin species which is consistent with TPR results. As mentioned above, it is well-known that the chemical states of Sn in bimetallic PtSn catalyst have an impact on the catalytic performance. According to the previous works [23], the presence of SnOx could modify the electronic and geometric properties of Pt species, leading to a smaller platinum ensembles and inhibition of coke formation. From Table 5, it is also observed that the PtSn/Mg(Al)O-svc catalyst possessed the lowest percentage of zero-valent Sn, meaning that large fraction of Sn species could effectively stabilize in the oxidative state, thus improving the catalytic activity and stability.

As mentioned before, coke formation is the main important factor of catalyst deactivation which is an unavoidable problem for Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts. TPO measurements were carried out to determine the amount and location of coke on the spent catalysts. The spent catalysts were collected after tested in propane dehydrogenation for 5 h at 550 °C. The TPO profiles are shown in Fig.10 and the contents of coke deposit for all catalysts are reported in Table 2. In general, the first peak at low temperature (250–400 °C) represented the coke deposits on the active metal and the second peak at high temperature (above 400 °C) corresponded to the deposited carbon on the external surface of support [39]. As shown in Fig.10, it can be obviously seen that the PtSn/
-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited a large amount of coke at high combustion temperature (ca. 520 °C), which implied that coke mainly deposited on the support. On the other hand, the presence of Mg(Al)O supports resulted in significant change in the TPO profiles. The relatively lower combustion temperature peaks and smaller amount of coke are observed over the PtSn/Mg(Al)O catalysts. The total amount of coke decreased in the following order: PtSn/Mg(Al)O-hd (0.55%) > PtSn/Mg(Al)O-mix (0.38%) > PtSn/Mg(Al)O-svc (0.34%) > PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv (0.33%) and the combustion temperatures of coke in each sample are different. It can be evidently observed that the PtSn/Mg(Al)O prepared by solvothermal method had relatively small peak located at lower temperature.

Based on the coke formation mechanism proposed by Qing Li et al. [40], the coke precursors formed through dehydrogenation were generated on the metal and then migrated to the support which these acid sites of the support could promote oligomerization/polymerization. Generally, a higher temperature of the combustion peak was due to a larger degree of polymerization of coke [41]. It suggests that for PtSn/
-Al2O3 catalyst, a comparatively large amount of coke covered on the metal and mainly on the support arises from high acidity of alumina, leading to quick deactivation. When addition of Mg, dominantly decrease of coke formation is attributed to decrease in acidity of catalysts, especially strong acid sites, which promote the fraction of CC bonds [42]. Besides, another factor that affects the amount of coke is the olefin adsorption behavior [43]. It has been reported by A. Iglesias-Juez et al. [4] that the presence of SnOx modified the electronic properties of Pt and reduced the interaction of propylene with Pt surface. The higher electron density of platinum was beneficial to repulse the coke precursors as well as propylene, suppressing deep dehydrogenation and cracking [44]. As a result, the easier desorption of product molecules could inhibit CC cleavage and coking reaction on the active metals. Notably, PtSn/Mg(Al)O-sv and PtSn/Mg(Al)O-svc dramatically inhibited coke deposition on metal surface, meaning that more active sites still remained resulting in the enhancement of catalyst stability.
4. Conclusions
The influences of different preparation methods of Mg(Al)O (physically mixing, hydrothermal and solvothermal) used as supports for PtSn catalysts on the catalytic properties were examined. Several characterization techniques were analyzed to explore the correlation with their catalytic performance. There were no obvious variations in structural and textural properties of PtSn/Mg(Al)O derived from different synthesis routes. The SEM image showed that PtSn/Mg(Al)O prepared by solvothermal method had flower-like morphology. After calcination, BET surface area was slightly decreased owing to the structural collapse. The H2-TPR and XPS results confirmed that enhancing Sn-support interaction could stabilize the oxidation state of tin, thereby affecting the interaction of Pt with SnOx and improving the catalytic stability. The suitable Mg-O-Al bonds on the catalyst surface had a significant effect on maintaining distribution of Pt particles. The NH3-TPD measurement verified that high acidity of catalyst promoted undesirable side reactions which decreased propylene selectivity. Moreover, the fraction of strong acid sites was well correlated with the amount of coke on spent catalyst. Among the investigated catalysts, the PtSn/Mg(Al)O obtained from solvothermal method exhibited the smallest average Pt size, the lowest fraction of strong acid sites and metallic tin species as well as the coke content. Consequently, the optimal catalytic performance was achieved over PtSn/Mg(Al)O synthesized by one-step solvothermal method which is relatively simple and highly flexible route, suggesting that solvothermal synthesis is a promising technique in the preparation of Mg(Al)O supported PtSn catalyst for propane dehydrogenation.
