 Unfortunately, the provided extracts do not contain any information related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation research. All the extracts indicate that the documents discuss oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene, and are not relevant to propane conversion.

Since there are no relevant extracts provided, I cannot synthesize or aggregate information about propane dehydrogenation from these documents. The output would simply indicate that the extracts are not relevant:

<output>
  <Relevance>No</Relevance> 
</output>

Please provide extracts that contain information pertinent to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation research so I can attempt to synthesize the key findings into a structured XML output. The current extracts exclusively discuss ethylbenzene to styrene conversion, which is not relevant.
