The provided document does not pertain to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). It discusses the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene to styrene using CO2 and O2 as oxidants over a K-modified ceria catalyst. The process converts ethylbenzene to styrene, not propane to propylene. Therefore, this work is not directly relevant to PDH or ODH of propane.
