 Unfortunately the document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The abstract and contents do not mention propane dehydrogenation specifically. The document discusses CO2 assisted propane dehydrogenation over a PtFe catalyst, but does not provide details on performance metrics like conversion, selectivity, or stability. Since the relevance criteria are not met, I will output that this document is not relevant.
