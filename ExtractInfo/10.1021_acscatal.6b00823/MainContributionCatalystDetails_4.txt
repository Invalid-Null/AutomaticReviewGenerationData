The given document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically for converting propane to propylene. It is an overview of catalysis research at various DOE national laboratories, covering a wide range of catalysis topics beyond just PDH and ODH. Since it does not focus on PDH or ODH for propylene production, I have indicated that it is not directly relevant.
