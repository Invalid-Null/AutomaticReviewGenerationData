The document does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) to produce propylene. It focuses on dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, but does not specifically mention conversion of propane to propylene as the end goal.
