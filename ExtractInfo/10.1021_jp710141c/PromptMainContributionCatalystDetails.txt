Propane Dehydrogenation in a Proton-conducting Fuel Cell
Abstract
The process and reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in a proton-conducting fuel cell were studied at 600−700 °C using Y-doped BeCeO3 as protonic electrolyte and Pt as electrode catalysts. The electrochemical dehydrogenation of propane was in competition with side reactions caused by the gas species (H2, C2H6, C2H4 etc.), which were the products of nonelectrochemical reactions (e.g., thermal cracking) in the anode chamber. Among those side electrochemical reactions, hydrogen disassociation into hydrogen ions was predominant. At 650 °C electrochemical dehydrogenation of propane has a higher activation energy than hydrogen disassociation over the anode platinum catalyst; however, the former reaction was more readily achieved at 700 °C.

ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Conversion of propane to propylene in a proton-conducting fuel cell is a process by which propane is dehydrogenated to propylene. (1-3) This process has the unique advantage of simultaneously obtaining value-added product propylene and electricity power. Unlike the industrial processes for conversion of propane to propylene, propane dehydrogenation occurring in a fuel cell is not equilibrium limited, and so propane can be completely converted to propylene. In addition, compared to other hydrocarbon fuel cells using oxide ion conductors as electrolytes, there is no greenhouse gas (CO2) or poisonous gas (CO) emissions from this proton-conducting fuel cell, as propane dehydrogenation is the only reaction, and the only products are propylene and water.
Although development of this process clearly has economic and environmental attractiveness, there have been few studies directed to realization of the concept. The challenge has been finding suitable proton-conducting electrolytes and compatible electrodes operating at temperatures below 800 °C. (4-7) Our fuel cell group at the University of Alberta made a breakthrough in this process and proved the feasibility of conversion of propane to propylene in a proton-conducting fuel cell. (1, 2) Good fuel cell performance and high selectivity to propylene were achieved using Y-doped BeCeO3 as electrolyte and Pt as electrodes. (8-10)
In our preliminary work at operating temperatures in the range 600−700 °C we detected hydrogen and other small molecule hydrocarbons in the anode outlet gas, in addition to the desired gas product propylene and unreacted propane. Involvement of these species in the electrochemical reactions in the fuel cell would affect fuel cell performance and propylene selectivity. Consequently, we now have investigated the behaviors of these species to understand the reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation in the fuel cell.

Materials
Y-doped BaCeO3 (BCY) was used as the proton-conducting electrolyte. According to the data reported in literature, BCY is a mix conductor, especially at high temperature. Combining some most relevant sources, (11, 12) it could be concluded that the proton transport numbers are about 1.00, 0.95, and 0.90 at 500, 600, and 700 °C, respectively. The preparation procedure was as previously described. (2) Y-doped BaCeO3 powder was prepared by solid-state reactions, and then electrolyte solid disks were made by pressing the powder.
Platinum was used for both cathode and anode catalysts, and the electrodes were prepared by screen-printing platinum paste (Heraeus CL11−5100) onto the corresponding surfaces of the BCY electrolyte disk. The membrane electrode assembly (MEA) was dried in air at 120 °C for 30 min and then fired at 1000 °C for 60 min to remove the organic binder and to increase adhesion to the electrolyte. The superficial surface area of each electrode was approximately 0.7 cm2.
Fuel Cell System Design
A vertical fuel cell setup was adopted with a glass sealant to achieve a good anode side gas seal, (13) as shown in Figure 1. This system comprises anode and cathode compartments, each consisting of two coaxial alumina tubes. The inner tube extended from outside the heated reaction zone to a position close to the respective electrode of the cell. The two tubes were fastened together at the remote end with a tailing gas outlet. The cell was sandwiched between the outer tubes of the anode and cathode compartment. The outer perimeter of anode and cathode outer tubes was sealed to the cell by applying a thin layer of glass and ceramic sealant (Aremco 503), respectively. Platinum gauze (52 mesh) was applied as the current collector for both anode and cathode.
Figure 1
Figure 1. Schematic of C3H8−O2 fuel cell setup design.
The assembled cell was placed in a tubular furnace (Thermolyne F79300). The seals were gradually cured as the cell was heated to the prescribed temperature for testing, (13) prior to operation of the cell under reaction conditions. During the heating procedure, nitrogen was passing through the anode chamber and air through the cathode chamber.
All the fuel cell experiments were carried out in the temperature range 600−700 °C. After the cell had stabilized at the operating temperature, the anode feed was switched to pure C3H8 (Praxair, grade 2.0). O2 (Praxair, grade 2.6) was supplied to the cathode side as oxidant via the inner tube. The gas flow rates were carefully controlled with mass flow controllers.
Electrical Measurements and Gas Analysis
The open circuit voltage and I−V behaviors were measured using a Solartron 1287 electrochemical interface. I−V characteristics were determined potentiodynamically with the electrochemical systems using a scanning rate 5 mV/s. The outlet gases from the anode chamber were analyzed using a Hewlett-Packard model HP5890 GC, using a polypack column at 80 °C and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) connected to a computer workstation.
Based on the inlet and outlet gas concentration, the conversion, selectivity, and yield are defined as:

Nonelectrochemical Reactions in the Fuel Cell System
Ideally, the gas product from the fuel cell system is only propylene if propane dehydrogenation is the only electrochemical reaction (eqs 4 and 5). However, in the experiments some other species—CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and H2—were also detected in the anode chamber effluent by gas chromatography because of occurrence of some nonelectrochemical reactions in the anode chamber of the fuel cell. (14) This situation became more severe under the open circuit condition because there was no current drawn from the fuel cell, thus there was no electrochemical reaction, and the possible reactions were the thermal reactions occurring in the hollow coaxial fuel cell tube and the chemically catalytic reactions on the anode catalyst Pt. When the fuel cell was discharged, the electrochemical reactions were activated and gas products distribution was improved with enhanced propylene selectivity in contrast to the open circuit condition. (2) However, even in this situation, thermal reactions still could not be avoided. The same gas product species were found in the effluent from the anode chamber in different concentrations, whether under open or closed circuit conditions.

All these reactions are thermodynamically favored at the fuel cell operating temperatures, and the reaction equilibrium constants for each reaction are shown in Figure 2. It has been shown that thermal reactions of propane followed a free-radical chain mechanism. (15) Equation 11 is the initial step, whereas eqs 12–18 and 19–24 refer to free radicals’ propagation and termination reactions, respectively. Catalytic reactions of propane on the Pt catalyst primarily involve two pathways: dehydrogenation by breaking of C−H bonds and intramolecular C−C bond cracking. (3, 16) The two pathways compete with each other, as shown in Figure 3. The gas products distribution in experiments was consistent with these studies, with predominant concentrations of CH4, C2H4, C3H6, and H2 (total selectivity >90%). As predicted, carbon deposition on the anode catalyst was detected (14) because, at high temperatures, hydrocarbons easily form carbon in an irreversible process, especially for alkenes, (16) which can also be seen from Figure 4. Although some researchers mentioned polymerization reactions might be involved in the reaction network, no hydrocarbons with higher molecular weight were detected in effluent from our fuel cell system.

These nonelectrochemical reactions are strongly affected by operating temperatures and propane flow rates, that is, reaction time. Thus the concentrations of the gas species were functions of the operating conditions. (2)
Open Circuit Voltage
The electromotive force (EMF) for the electrochemical dehydrogenation of propane (eq 25) is expressed by the Nernst equation (eq 26).

where E1°(T) is the cell standard potential, calculated from thermodynamic data ΔG° at standard conditions, that is, the potential when the partial pressures of all reactants and products are 1 bar. PC3H6, PC3H8, PH2O, and PO2 in the logarithmic term refer to the equilibrium partial pressures of the gas species at the interfaces between electrodes and electrolyte. Usually, the partial pressure at the interface can be replaced by that in the bulk fluid if there is no mass transfer limitation for the gas species. In experiments, the total pressures of anode and cathode compartment were both kept at 1 atm, so the partial pressure of each gas component was not at the standard condition (1 bar). PC3H8and PC3H6 could be calculated from GC analysis of anode outlet gas, but it was not easy to obtain PH2O because the partial pressure of water vapor in the cathode compartment was very low (∼10 ppm) at open circuit condition, (17) which was difficult to accurately measure by GC. To obtain the value of PH2O, experiments were conducted in which oxygen fed to the cathode compartment was saturated with water at room temperature instead of using pure, dry oxygen. Thus, the values of PH2O and PO2 were obtained as 0.031 and 0.969 atm, respectively. Because the partial pressures of the gas species were functions of operating temperatures and propane flow rates, the calculated EMF of propane dehydrogenation from the Nernst equation (Equation 26) also depends on the operating conditions. The calculated EMFs at different temperatures with a propane flow rate 100 mL/min are listed in Table 1, as well as partial pressures of the gas species and standard potential (HSC Chemistry Software, Version 5.1, Outokunpu Research).

aPropane flow rate: 100 mL/min.
As predicted from the Nernst equation, the measured open circuit voltage of the C3H8−O2 fuel cell was not only dependent on operating temperature but also on propane flow rate, but the value was not consistent with the calculated EMF. For example, at 600 °C with a propane flow rate of 100 mL/min, the calculated EMF for the electrochemical dehydrogenation of propane was 1.295 V, which was larger than the measured OCV value of 1.085 V. The same phenomena were found during operating the fuel cell at 650 or 700 °C. The apparent discrepancy between the measured OCV values and the calculated EMF values probably was due to involvement of side electrochemical reactions in addition to propane dehydrogenation. However, this speculation was based on the assumption that the measured OCV values of an electrochemical reaction, without interference of other side reactions, was equal or very close to the EMF value calculated from the Nernst equation. This assumption usually was not true because, conceptually, OCV is not same as EMF, and the discrepancy between these two values was even apparent for low-temperature fuel cells (such as PEM fuel cell) due to slow anodic- and/or cathodic-reaction rates where the electrode reactions no longer attain equilibria. (18) For high-temperature fuel cells, the OCV value could very closely reach the corresponding EMF value if the electrolyte is a complete proton conductor without electron conduction. (19) Therefore, before we safely come to the conclusion that the difference between the EMF and measured OCV values of C3H8−O2 fuel cells was caused by involvements of other side reactions in addition to electrochemical dehydrogenation of propane, the consistency between OCV and EMF values for a single reaction in our fuel cell system must be proven. Apparently, the propane dehydrogenation reaction can never be guaranteed to be the sole electrochemical reaction at the fuel cell operating conditions, even with pure propane feed to the anode, as discussed before. So another experiment was conducted with pure hydrogen as anode feed and water-saturated oxygen (saturated at room temperature) fed to the cathode, for which the OCV of the H2−O2 fuel cell is shown in Figure 5. It is obvious that the measured OCV value at 650 °C is 1.158 V, which is almost the same as the calculated value from the Nernst equation for a hydrogen fuel cell (1.160 V). So the experimental results supported the previous deduction that the gas species present in addition to propane took part in the electrochemical reactions.
Figure 5

Among the gas species (CH4, C2H4, C3H6, and H2) at the anode outlet, hydrogen is the one most easily disassociated over platinum in the fuel cells (eq 27), because platinum is an active anode catalyst for hydrogen fuel cells. (20-24) Another possibility is that ethane may be involved in the electrochemical reactions through reaction 28, similar to propane dehydrogenation. The partial pressures of the gas species involved in reactions 27 and 28 were determined from GC analysis and are summarized in Table 1, as well as the calculated EMF values from the Nernst equations (eqs 29 and 30). From comparison of the measured OCV and calculated EMF values of the three different reactions—eqs 25, 27, and 28—(Table 2), it is apparent that the OCV value was equal to none of the EMF values of any of these three reactions. At 600 and 650 °C, the measured OCV value was less than the EMF value of reaction 25 but was larger than the EMF values of reaction 27 or 28. Thus, measured OCV values may have been a mixed reaction voltage of these three reactions. A difference for data obtained at 700 °C was that the measured OCV value was below all three of these EMF values, which indicated some other side reactions may also have occurred in addition to the three discussed here. It is possible that reaction 10 proceeds, followed by reaction 31, which also affects the OCV.

Therefore, the measured OCV of the C3H8−O2 fuel cell was a result of competition between all of the electrochemical reactions present under the open circuit condition, such as reactions 25, 27, and 28, and the value of OCV depended on the proportions of each electro-active species present and the reaction potentials.
Fuel Cell Performance
The involvements of hydrogen reaction (reaction 27) and other side reactions in the process of propane dehydrogenation in the fuel cell were also reflected in the I−V curves. For example, at 650 °C with a propane flow rate of 100 mL/min, the concentrations of hydrogen and propane were 3.7 and 78.3%, respectively, in the anode chamber under the open circuit conditions. So when the fuel cell was discharged, there could be contributions to the current from all gas species in the anode chamber: 3.7% hydrogen, 78.3% propane and/or other gas components. To analyze the individual contribution by each gas species, especially for the hydrogen in the gas mixture, separate experiments were conducted with propane (100 mL/min) and 3.7% hydrogen (balance with Ar) as the fuels, respectively, at 650 °C (Figure 6). If reactions 25 and 27 were independent, it could be inferred from Figure 6 that the C3H8−O2 fuel cell performance was mainly attributable to hydrogen reaction 27 rather than propane dehydrogenation (eq 25). However, when discharging the fuel cell at low voltage (<0.2 V), the current and power obtained from the hydrogen fuel cell (3.7% H2 in Ar) were higher than those from the C3H8−O2 fuel cell (with 3.7% H2 in the gas mixture) (Figure 6). So, in the process of propane dehydrogenation in a proton-conducting fuel cell, the desired propane dehydrogenation (reaction 25) and the side reaction (reaction 27) were not independent but were in competition with each other.

Figure 6. Fuel cell performances using pure propane (flow rate: 100 mL/min) and 3.7% hydrogen (balance with argon) as anode feed, respectively, with the same electrolyte of Y-doped BaCeO3 and electrodes of Pt at 650 °C.
Varying the propane flow rate influenced the concentrations of propane, hydrogen, and other species leading to affecting fuel cell performance. Figures 7 and 8 show the fuel cell maximum power density at different propane flow rates at 650 and 700 °C, respectively. Depending on the propane flow rate, the trend in maximum power density can be roughly classified into three different zones. Zone I refers to the range of very low propane flow rate under which conditions the concentration of hydrogen was much higher than that of propane. So, within zone I the hydrogen reaction was the predominant electrochemical reaction determining fuel cell performance, and increasing propane flow rate in this range gave rise to lower hydrogen concentration and thus lower fuel cell performances. However, in the range of very high propane flow rate (zone III) propane concentration was significant in the gas products, and propane dehydrogenation became the predominant electrochemical reaction in the fuel cell. Between zone I and zone III, these two electrochemical reactions (reactions 25 and 27) existed simultaneously, but neither of them predominated over the other. In zone II, with increase of propane flow rate, there appeared a maximum arising from the total contributions of hydrogen reaction and propane dehydrogenation to the fuel cell performance.

Figure 8
Figure 8. Maximal power density at different propane flow rates, obtained from the C3H8−O2 fuel cell at 700 °C.
By comparison of zone I to zone III in Figure 7, it can be concluded that the activation of electrochemical propane dehydrogenation was more difficult on Pt catalyst at 650 °C than hydrogen disassociation activation because, at very high propane flow rate (zone III), the propane concentration in the anode chamber was close to 100%, which was much more than the hydrogen concentration at low propane flow rate (zone I), but higher fuel cell performance was achieved in zone I compared to zone III. At 700 °C (Figure 8) very similar fuel cell performances were observed, except that higher maximum power densities were obtained at zone III rather than zone I. So it can be inferred that propane dehydrogenation became easier at 700 °C than at 650 °C, based on the fact that hydrogen disassociation was favored at higher temperatures on Pt catalyst in the fuel cell. (21, 22)
Gas Products Analysis
The changes of propylene and hydrogen yield were monitored during electrical discharging of the fuel cell. If reaction 25 was the only electrochemical reaction and propane dehydrogenation was the only source of protons produced at the anode, then the propylene yield would be proportional to the discharging current, easily calculated from the Faraday law. Figure 9 shows the relationship of the theoretical propylene yield, that is, the propylene yield obtained from only electrochemical dehydrogenation of propane, to the discharging current at 650 °C with propane flow rate 100 mL/min. The relationship between experimental propylene yield and hydrogen yield with discharging current is also shown in Figure 9. Obviously, the experimental propylene yield was less than the theoretical value, which indicated that propane dehydrogenation was not the only electrochemical reaction and that other side electrochemical reactions were involved in this process and contributed some portion of protons. A very small amount of CO2 was determined in the anode outlet gas due to the following two resources; (a) the oxygen ion transport number for Y-doped BaCeO3 at 650 °C is between 0.05 and 0.10. (11, 12) It is possible that O2- ions transport through the electrolyte from the cathode to anode side, thereby oxidizing the hydrocarbon species to form CO2, CO, or H2O; and (b) it is not possible to completely avoid diffusion of air through sealants to the anode chamber, thereby reacting with hydrocarbons to form carbon oxides. The yield of CO2 was not included in Figure 9 because it is difficult to separate the amount of CO2 from each resource, although it is known that the amount of CO2 produced by the leaked oxygen is larger than that produced by O2- transported through the electrolyte. (25) In addition, when O2− reaches the anode side and oxidizes the hydrocarbon species (C3H8, CH4, C2H4, C3H6, and C2H6) or hydrogen, the products will be a mixture of CO2, CO, and H2O, not CO2 alone. The negative hydrogen yield meant that some amount of hydrogen was consumed during the process of discharging the fuel cell, which confirmed our conclusion that the hydrogen reaction (reaction 27) was one among side electrochemical reactions occurring during the process of propane dehydrogenation in the proton-conducting fuel cell. By summation of the absolute values of propylene yield and hydrogen yield at a specific discharging current, it can be seen that the majority of protons consumed in the fuel cell arose from propane dehydrogenation and hydrogen disassociation. Thus, hydrogen disassociation was a significant side electrochemical reaction in the fuel cell. Although electrochemical ethane dehydrogenation (reaction 28) may be another side reaction during the process of propane dehydrogenation in the fuel cell; no obvious change of ethane concentration was observed when discharging the fuel cell. So electrochemical ethane dehydrogenation was not an electrochemical reaction involved in the process.

Figure 9. Propylene and hydrogen concentration changes in anode chamber effluent at 650 °C during discharging of the C3H8−O2 fuel cell with Y-doped BaCeO3 as electrolyte and platinum as electrodes at a propane flow rate 100 mL/min.
With increasing discharging current, although, propylene yield increased (Figure 9), and the selectivity to propylene slightly decreased at 650 °C (Figure 10), which indicates the extent of rate increase of propane dehydrogenation was less than that of hydrogen disassociation.
Figure 10
Figure 10. Propylene selectivity at different discharging currents of the C3H8−O2 fuel cell at 650 °C.
At 700 °C the hydrogen reaction was still the predominant side electrochemical reaction (Figure 11); however, its contribution to the fuel cell performance was much less than that of propane dehydrogenation. As a result, the propylene selectivity during discharging the fuel cell at 700 °C was much enhanced compared to 650 °C (Figure 12). For the same reason discussed above in Figure 9, the yield of CO2 was not included in Figure 11. At 700 °C, with a propane flow rate of 100 mL/min, the propane concentration at the exit to the anode chamber was 52.1%, and the hydrogen concentration was 7.2%, which was less than that at 650 °C with the same flow rate, for which the hydrogen concentration was 3.7%. So, the reaction rate of propane dehydrogenation was improved at 700 °C relative to the hydrogen reaction. It was inferred that, by increasing operating temperatures from 650 to 700 °C, the electrochemical dehydrogenation of propane became easier to activate, in contrast to the electrochemical hydrogen reaction (reaction 27).

The information on the reaction mechanism of electrochemical dehydrogenation of propane in a fuel cell is very limited in the open literature. Cheng et al. investigated a similar propane fuel cell with PBI as an electrolyte and proposed a three-step reaction process. (3) First, propane molecules chemisorb onto the catalyst surface and then dissociate to form propylene and two hydrogen atoms. The hydrogen atoms are subsequently transformed to protons that are conducted through the membrane to the cathode side, while propylene desorbs from the catalyst surface and the active sites are made available for further reaction (Figure 13). Because low operating temperature (<250 °C) had been used in the case with PBI polymer as the proton-conducting electrolyte, the reaction mechanism in our system may not be the same as the one Cheng et al. proposed. On the basis of the increased propylene selectivity during electrochemical dehydrogenation of propane in fuel cells compared to catalytic dehydrogenation of propane on platinum catalyst, (2) as well as the demonstrated mechanism of catalytic dehydrogenation of propane on platinum (Figure 3), (16) the reaction mechanism of electrochemical dehydrogenation of propane in this proton-conducting fuel cell is proposed by analogy with catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. The initial step of propane adsorption on the anode in a fuel cell system may be the same as the catalytic dehydrogenation, but the following steps could be different due to the existence of electrons and/or such formed local electrical field on the anode catalyst surface. It is suggested that electrons can assist in removing the disassociated hydrogen atoms from anode catalysts surface by forming protons, which promotes C−H bond breaking rather than C−C bond cracking, but more experiments are needed to illustrate this process. In addition, the extent of influence of electrons or such formed local electrical field on the reaction mechanism is dependent on the electron concentration at the anode catalyst surface, which was reflected in the experimental results that different propylene selectivity was obtained at different currents. (2) To better understand the details of this reaction mechanism, further more investigations are required.

Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
During the operation of propane dehydrogenation in a proton-conducting fuel cell, other gas species caused by the thermal cracking and catalytic reactions of propane in the fuel cell anode chamber were involved in this process. Hydrogen disassociation into hydrogen ions was the most significant side electrochemical reaction, which was in competition with propane dehydrogenation in the fuel cell. Compared to the hydrogen disassociation, the electrochemical dehydrogenation of propane was more difficult to activate at 650 °C but was much easier at 700 °C, which resulted in a higher selectivity to propylene at 700 °C than at 650 °C.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
