The given document discusses oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH), which involves the oxidation of propane as part of the dehydrogenation process to produce propylene. However, the document does not focus on a specific catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution. Rather, it evaluates and compares the performance of various doped cerium oxide catalysts for ODH. As there is no single catalyst identified as the primary advancement, I cannot extract the requested details. The document focuses more broadly on how doping influences the ODH activity and selectivity of cerium oxide.
