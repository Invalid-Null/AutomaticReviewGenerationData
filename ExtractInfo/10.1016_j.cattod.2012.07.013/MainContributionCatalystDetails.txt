 Based on the provided information, there does not appear to be any relevant details about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The documents focus on n-butane dehydrogenation and do not provide information pertinent to propylene production from propane.

The documents do not contain information relevant to summarizing advancements in propane dehydrogenation catalysts, as they focus on a different reaction - the dehydrogenation of n-butane to butenes. Since no relevant details were provided, I have indicated that the documents are not relevant and omitted the detailed XML structure. Please provide documents that focus specifically on propane dehydrogenation if you need a summary of advancements in catalysts for that reaction.
