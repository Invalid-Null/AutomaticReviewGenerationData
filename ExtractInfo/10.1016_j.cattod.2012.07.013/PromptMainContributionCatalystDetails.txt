n-Butane dehydrogenation over mono and bimetallic MCM-41 catalysts under oxygen free atmosphere
Abstract
The present study investigates the dehydrogenation of n-butane over mono (Cr or V) and bimetal (Cr-V) loaded MCM-41 catalysts. Wet impregnation technique was used, where the metal content maintained around 4 wt.%. The unique properties of bimetal supported catalysts were evaluated by means of XRD, N2 adsorption, and temperature programmed analysis H2-TPR and NH3-TPD. The mixed oxides Cr and V impregnated MCM-41 was tested for dehydrogenation of n-butane at different temperatures ranging 525–600 °C. The catalytic evaluation shows that Cr content of 1.2 wt.% and V content of 2.8 wt.% over MCM-41 designated as 1.2Cr2.8V/M-41 exhibited the highest butane conversion of 20.1% and butenes selectivity of 88.5% at 600 °C. Monometallic forms synthesized through hydrothermal (Cr-MCM-41) and impregnation route (3.5 wt.%Cr/MCM-41 and 3.8 wt.%V/MCM-41) were found to be less active for the dehydrogenation reaction. In the presence of CO2, the stability of 1.2Cr2.8V/M-41catalyst improved with n-butane conversion of 8.2% at 10 min to 6.5% at 180 min. The improved performance of bimetal catalysts can be correlated to synergetic effect of uniformly dispersed Cr-V-O mixed oxides over MCM-41, high reducibility and surface acidity.

1. Introduction
The importance of catalytic dehydrogenation of paraffin hydrocarbons to olefins has been growing steadily in recent years. Light olefins, such as butenes, are important raw materials for the synthesis of polymers, gasoline additives and various other petrochemical products. The cracking processes especially fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracker produce high-purity mono-olefins, such as 1-butene or butadiene. Despite such processes, currently more research is focused on developing alternatives such as oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) for two reasons: (1) undesired reactions take place at high temperature leading to coking and catalyst deactivation, making frequent regeneration of the catalyst unavoidable, (2) it consumes a large amount of heat and requires high reaction temperatures. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of n-butane is an alternative to classical dehydrogenation, steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking processes.
Over the years, a significant progress has been made in the development of catalysts for ODH of n-butane (C4H10) and isobutane (i-C4H10) to C4H8 and i-C4H8. Among the oxide catalysts, vanadium and chromium oxide supported catalysts have been most promising for ODH due to their high catalytic activity. The mononuclear Cr3+ species dispersed on the surface of silica support are reported to be responsible for dehydrogenation of light alkanes. These species predominate at low Cr loadings, while at higher loadings less active crystalline Cr2O3 tends to dominate [1]. Hakuli et al. [2] reported that silica- and alumina-supported chromium oxides were effective for the production of lower alkenes such as propene and isobutene. Botavina et al. [3] stated that for ODH of propane and isobutane, the highest activity, selectivity and stability were achieved over 5.0 wt.% CrOx/silica catalysts prepared by wet impregnation method. Volpe et al. [4] investigated n-butane dehydrogenation using VOx supported on USY, NaY, γ-Al2O3 and α-Al2O3. The high catalytic activity of VOx/USY and butane selectivity was related to the VOx monolayer and mild acidity. Recently, chromium oxide catalysts supported on high surface area, pore expanded MCM-41 silica was investigated for ethane dehydrogenation. The studies showed that the ethane conversion strongly depend on the chromia loading and the catalyst preparation method [5]. Similarly, VOx species supported on hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS) were found to be active in ODH of n-butane, where the isolated monomeric VOx species were determined to play most active catalytic role [6]. The comparative study on V-containing different mesoporous siliceous materials such HMS, SBA-16, SBA-15 and MCM-48 in ODH of propane and n-butane highlights the importance of population of tetrahedrally coordinated VOx complexes and isolated monomeric VOx complexes [7].
The dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 as a mild oxidant has been recently explored as an alternative to the equilibrium controlled dehydrogenation. Oxygen assisted dehydrogenation is less attractive because the abstracted hydrogen is oxidized, releasing heat in an exothermic reaction. Due to the exothermic property of these reactions, it is expedient to remove heat [8] and avoid the over-oxidation of n-butane to CO2 in order to reach high selectivity to butene. Nakagawa et al. [9] have shown that CO2 improves the stability of Ga2O3 loaded catalyst by the removal of the coke deposited on its surface according to the Boudouard reaction:
C(s) + CO2(g) ⇄ 2CO(g)
Also, CO2 removes the H2 adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst through the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGSR):
CO2 + H2 ⇄ CO + H2O
RWGSR is very important because it removes one of the products (H2) and shifts the equilibrium to the products, thereby improving the conversion. Wang et al. [10] reported, for i-C4H10 dehydrogenation with Cr/MCM41 catalyst, a selectivity of 90.4% at an i-C4H10 conversion of 18.3%. Shimada et al. [11] discussed that iron loaded on activated carbon produced an i-C4H10 conversion of 48% with 80% i-C4H8 selectivity at 600 °C in the ODH of i-C4H10 by CO2.
The literature shows that so for ODH in n-butane are little and are primarily based on monometallic system. It is well established that the incorporation of two different metals might create new redox and acidic properties [12]. Yuan et al. [13] reported on the synthesis of metallosilicate MCM-41 with hierarchical structure containing Cr and V species. The synthesis and catalytic application of single or two transition metals systems have been already reported [14], [15], [16], [17]. Therefore, in the present study, we extend the investigation using Cr and V based bimetallic impregnated MCM-41 in dehydrogenation of n-butane at 550 °C for 180 min. MCM-41 mesoporous molecular sieve is extensively used as support or catalysts as documented in recent review papers [18], [19]. The objective of this contribution was to investigate the most active catalytic species in dehydrogenation and to study the influence of temperature and CO2 atmosphere. The obtained catalytic results were correlated with the structural and surface characteristics.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts synthesis
2.1.1. Synthesis of Cr-MCM-41(CrM-41) by direct hydrothermal method
10.6 g of sodium meta silicate (Aldrich) and appropriate amount of chromium nitrate was dissolved in 50 g of water and then thoroughly stirred until a clear solution was obtained. 4.45 g of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (Aldrich) was dissolved in 30 g of distilled H2O. The resultant mixture was stirred for 2 h, and then the pH of the resulting gel was adjusted to 10.5 with 4N sulfuric acid followed by stirring for 3 h. The resulting homogenous solution was transferred into an autoclave and heated to 140 °C in static conditions for 12 h. The solid product was filtered, washed thoroughly using distilled water, dried at 80 °C overnight, then calcined at 550 °C for 6 h to remove the surfactant.
A similar method was used for the synthesis of SiMCM-41 but without the addition of chromium source.
2.1.2. Synthesis of Cr-V/MCM-41 by wet impregnation method
In case of impregnation, 4 wt.% of Cr, V or Cr-V were impregnated onto silica support by wet impregnation method. For 1.2 wt.% Cr and 2.8 wt.% V impregnation (1.2Cr2.8V/M-41), 0.092 g of chromium nitrate and 0.064 g of ammonium metavanadate was dissolved in 30 ml deionized water and then added to 1 g of MCM-41. The resulting mixture was stirred, dried and then calcined at 550 °C for 6 h (3 °C/min). The other samples (2Cr2V/M-41 and 2.7Cr1.2V/M-41) with different weight percentage loadings were prepared by similar way.
2.2. Characterization
Atomic absorption measurements were carried out with a PerkinElmer AAnalyst 100 using a mixed gas of acetylene–N2O–air. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was recorded on Rigaku Miniflex II system using nickel filtered Cu Kα radiation λ = 1.5406 Å at 40 kV and 30 mA. The surface area was measured by nitrogen adsorption at −196 °C using AUTOSORB-1 (Quantachrome). Before adsorption measurements, samples (ca. 0.1 g) were heated at 400 °C for 10 h under nitrogen flow. The nitrogen adsorption isotherms of calcined materials were measured at liquid nitrogen temperature (−196 °C). The surface areas and pore diameters were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method, respectively.
TPR and TPD (temperature-programmed reduction and ammonia desorption) experiments were performed in BEL-CAT-A-200, chemisorption apparatus that consists of a gas mixing unit allowing both continuous and pulsed reactant dosing, U-tube quartz microreactor with a thermocouple placed inside the sample, and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The linearity of the TCD response was proven by the injection of gas pulses of various known compositions, and the quantitative hydrogen consumption was calibrated in every measurement by a series of calibration gas pulses. H2-TPR analysis was performed using Ar/H2 gas mixture (95/5 vol%). The total flow rate of the feed was 50 cm3/min. Before the experiment, the sample (100 mg) was preheated in He at 300 °C for 3 h, and then cooled to room temperature. The sample was heated at 10 °C/min to the final temperature of 700 °C. The H2 consumption was measured by a thermal conductivity detector and CuO was used as a reference for the calibration of H2 consumption. Temperature programmed ammonia (NH3-TPD) was carried out on the same instrument. The sample (100 mg) was pretreated in a flow of He (50 ml/min) at 500 °C for 1 h. Then the sample was exposed to He/NH3 mixture (95/5 vol%) at room temperature for 30 min. The gas phase NH3 was removed by He purging for 1 h followed by which TPD was performed in He flow (50 ml/min) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min, and the desorbed NH3 was monitored by a TCD detector.
2.3. Catalysts test
The catalytic runs were carried out in a fully integrated, fixed bed continuous flow reactor system (BELCAT). The system consists of one tubular quartz reactor attached with stainless steel one-zone furnace assembly through reactor furnace wall thermo well. The catalysts sample (0.15 g) was packed in the reactor and activated with flowing N2 at 823 K for 2 h. After which the flow rate of reactant (n-butane) and N2 was maintained at 4.0 ml/min and 96 ml/min, respectively. The gas product samples were analyzed by online gas chromatograph (Agilent, 6890N) equipped with J&W Scientfic HP-5 capillary column (length: 30 m, ID: 0.32 mm, and film thickness 0.25 μm) and FID detector. The gas products, including H2, CO and CO2, were analyzed with a TCD and a GS-GASPRO capillary column. The products were identified by comparison with authentic samples.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization
3.1.1. X-ray diffraction
The X-ray diffraction patterns for impregnated samples (3.5Cr/M-41, 3.8V/M-41, 1.2Cr2.8V/M-41, 2Cr2V/M-41, 2.7Cr1.2V/M-41) and hydrothermally synthesized Cr-M-41 (Si/Cr = 50) are shown in Fig. 1(a–f). CrM-41 showed characteristics XRD diffraction patterns indexed to hexagonal symmetry [20] (Fig. 1(a)). However, apart from intense (1 0 0) peak, a significant reduction in the higher order peaks occurs indicating a decreased structural ordering of mesostructure. After the calcination, a major shrinkage in the unit cell is observed between Si-MCM-41 and Cr-M-41. For example, the d spacing for Si-MCM-41 is decreased from 41.63 to 36.78 Å, and the shrinkage is nearly 11%. In comparison, the d spacing of Cr-M-41 is reduced from 43.83 to 33.43 Å, and the shrinkage in the d spacing is 23% suggesting that further cross-linking of the silica species occurs during calcination [21]. Overall, the impregnated samples showed high orderedness irrespective of such high metal loadings. Comparatively, 3.5Cr/M-41 and 3.8V/M-41 samples showed well resolved four diffraction lines at 2θ range of 2.3, 4.2, 4.8 and 6.3 indexed to (1 0 0), (1 1 0), (2 0 0) and (2 1 0) peaks corresponding to hexagonal symmetry (Fig. 1(b and c)). In the case of bimetal impregnated samples three diffraction lines are still observed, indicating well ordered mesoporous support (Fig. 1(d–f)). The absence of crystalline α-Cr2O3 and V2O5 between 2θ range 10–50° for all the samples show the highly disbursed metal oxide phase over the support.

3.1.2. Nitrogen adsorption isotherms
The textural characteristics of CrM-41, mono and bimetal impregnated MCM-41 samples are presented in Table 1. All samples showed characteristic type IV isotherms typical to that of siliceous MCM-41 (Fig. 2(a–f)). Hydrothermally synthesized Cr-M-41 showed a less sharp inflection at P/P0 range between 0.2 and 0.3 indicating a slight decrease in textural characteristic after chromium incorporation (Fig. 2(a)). The surface area reduced considerably at 577 m2/g compared with Si-MCM-41 (1229 m2/g), while pore volume decreased from 0.81 cc/g to 0.39 cc/g. Singh and co-workers [22] attributed such a trend to the presence of large amount of chromium species outside the framework of MCM-41. In the case of impregnated samples, a sharp inflection can be observed reflecting uniform mesopore size distribution (Fig. 2(b–f). When compared with SiMCM-41, only a slight decrease in the surface area and pore volume is observed (Table 1). 1.2Cr2.8V/M-41 showed the highest surface area of 1079 m2/g and pore volume of 0.66 cc/g. The pore size distribution curves of all samples as calculated by BJH method are centered in the range 2.4–2.9 nm.

3.1.3. Temperature programmed reduction
In ODH of alkanes over transition metal oxides supported catalysts, the reaction proceeds via redox mechanism, in which the reducibility is a key factor for the catalyst activity [23]. XRD is a relatively known to be an insensitive for the detection of small crystallitine nanoparticles or surface VOx species due to absence of long range orderedness [24]. Therefore, the materials were characterized by H2-TPR. Fig. 3(a–f) shows the reducibility of Cr, V or Cr-V impregnated MCM-41 support. The TPR results are presented in Table 2. A significant difference in the reducibility is observed between the mono or bimetallic supported system. CrM-41 showed a sharp reduction peak at the temperature around 444 °C. This peak can be attributed to the reduction of Cr6+ species [25]. In the case of 3.5Cr/M-41, two reduction peaks are observed at 354 and 435 °C, respectively. Ellison et al. [26] attributed such peaks to CrO3 clusters with smaller interaction over the silica support. However, the H2 consumption was found to be smaller than for other samples. In the case of 3.8V/M-41, two reduction peaks are observed around 535 and 617 °C, respectively. The reduction peak maxima between 500 and 550 °C is attributed to the reduction of surface V5+ species to surface V3+ species [27], [28], [29], [30]. The presence of a less intense peak between 580 and 630 °C for 3.8V/M-41 is attributed to the reduction of polymeric and bulk vanadia species [31]. In the case of bimetal loading, for 1.2Cr2.8V/M-41 sample, a shift in the onset of reduction peak towards lower temperature between 335 and 520 °C compared to 3.8V/M-41 indicating more reducible species due to the Cr-V oxide interaction leading to mixed oxide phase over the support. A small reduction peaks at 431 °C and a distinct reduction band at 457 °C were observed. Gaspar et al. [32] ascribed such reduction to Cr6+ species that is interacted at different locations over the silica support. The presence of high temperature peak at 497 °C, which extends up to 540 °C can be due to monomeric or low oligomeric surface dispersed tetrahedral species [33], [34]. Thus it can be pointed out that the VOx species in the presence of CrOx species tends to inhibit the agglomerization of vanadia species and hence the formation of bulk-like vanadia species becomes less prominent. The peaks at 366 and 445 °C became dominant for the samples 2Cr2V/M-41 and 2.7Cr1.2V/M-41 with increasing chromium content indicating the formation of polychromates. Airaksinen et al. [35] observed that such polychromates species on the chromia/alumina sample are more reducible than monochromates species. The H2 consumptions (mmol/g) were in the following order: 1.2Cr2.8V/M-41 > 3.8V/M-41 (0.655) > 2Cr2V/M-41 (0.605) > 2.7Cr1.2V/M-41 (0.495) > CrM-41 (0.385) > 3.5Cr/M-41 (0.285), respectively. The depreciation of H2 consumption with high Cr loading indicates increasing Cr-V oxide interactions, which may lead to the formation of mixed oxide phases and, therefore, may inhibit the thermal decomposition of chromium species in oxidation states VI and/or V during calcination [36], [37]. The amount of transition metal reduced for all the catalysts were calculated. In the case of mono metal impregnated SiMCM-41 such as 3.8V/M-41 and 3.5Cr/M-41, a reduction of 42 and 87% of metals are observed indicating reduction of V5+ to V3+ and Cr6+ to Cr3+ species, respectively. In the case of bimetal impregnated MCM-41, reduction temperature was observed in between V or Cr impregnated MCM-41 samples. Almost all the metal content in 1.2Cr2.8V/M-41 is observed to be reduced to trivalent state, whereas the reduction of 78 and 65% occurs over 2Cr2V/M-41 and 2.7Cr1.2V/M-41, respectively.

3.1.4. Temperature programmed desorption
Fig. 4(a–f) shows the temperature programmed desorption of ammonia from various samples. The results of total acidity from corresponding maximum desorption peak are presented in Table 2. A small broad peak at 230 °C is observed over SiMCM-41 indicating the presence of very weak acid sites mainly due to perturbed silanol groups [38]. The mono Cr, V or Cr-V impregnated samples show a broad desorption band indicating a wide distribution of the acid strength of surface acid sites. Particular, in the case of monometallic Cr or V impregnation, a major desorption peak appear between 100 and 220 °C indicating an increased acid amount of weak acidity. This is reflected in the overall concentration of acid sites of bimetallic Cr-V impregnated MCM-41 (Table 2). Santamaria-Gonzalez et al. [39] attributed such a rise due to the enhancement of acid strength of silanols groups caused by the strong interaction with metal oxides. The amount of ammonia consumed in the samples is as follows: 1.2Cr2.8V/M-41 ∼ 2.7Cr1.2V/M-41 > 2Cr2V/M-41 > 3.5Cr/M-41 ∼ 3.8V/M-41 > CrM-41 > SiMCM-41. The increased surface acidity shows the stronger interaction of mixed oxides over support than that of the mono metal oxide supported catalysts. Park and co-workers [40] indicated that such type of increased acidity to the existence of synergistic effect between the metal oxides.

3.2. Dehydrogenation of n-butane
The catalyst performances are as shown in Fig. 5. The dehydrogenation of n-butane was carried out in N2 atmosphere at 550 °C over V/M-41, Cr/M-41 and Cr-V/M-41 catalysts with different metal loadings for 180 min. The flow rate of n-butane was 4 ml/min while nitrogen flow rate was 96 ml/min, and the catalyst loading was 0.15 g. The major reaction products observed were methane, ethane, ethene, propane, propene, 1-butene, t-2-butene, cis-2-butene, isobutene and 1,3-butadiene. CrOx and VOx based mesoporous catalysts have been proposed to be catalytically active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes [1], [7]. The main factors affecting the selectivity are reported to be the metal content, nature of the support (structure, acidity) and the reactions temperature [41]. In agreement with this report, hydrothermally synthesized CrM-41 (Si/Cr molar ratio 50) exhibited a low dehydrogenation activity as well as a low selectivity. The dehydrogenation selectivity was 81%, for the n-butane conversion of 3.74% at 10 min. It indicates that in butane dehydrogenation, in addition to dispersion, a high metal loading higher than 1.5 wt.% and large surface area is significant for high dehydrogenation activity. 3.8V/M-41 shows a better stability than 3.5Cr/M-41 even though the first 10 min initial activity of 3.5Cr/M-41 was better (9.2% conversion, compared with 6.0% conversion for 3.8V/M-41). The selectivity to butenes of 3.8V/M-41 was slightly better. However, it is interesting to observe that the catalysts modified with bimetals over MCM-41 shows an enhanced dehydrogenation activity. The impregnation of 1.2 wt.% Cr and 2.8 wt.% V over MCM-41 (1.2Cr2.8V/M-41) significantly affects the conversion of butane and butenes selectivity. The maximum conversion was 9.8% at 10 min of reaction time, whereas the selectivity to butenes improved sharply and remains above 90% through the course of entire reaction time. The oxidative dehydrogenation reaction is postulated to occur through a redox cycle, where the catalysts lattice oxygen takes part in the oxidation reaction, and then the reduced catalyst is reoxidized following a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [42]. Ruettinger et al. [43] shows that an isolated VO groups are active sites in the ODH reaction. The VOx species with higher degree of polymerization participate in undesired consecutive reactions with ODH products [6]. The improved results of bimetal impregnated MCM-41 samples can be explained to the synergetic effect of active metals (VOx and/or CrOx species), which according to the results of XRD and TPR, are well dispersed on the surface of mesoporous support. An intermediate reduction temperature between 300 and 520 °C of the Cr-V/M-41 catalyst determined by TPR than that of Cr and V based MCM-41 catalyst supports the correlation between the higher activity and easier reducibility of the Cr-V/M-41 catalyst. Karamullaoglu and Dogu [42] correlated the activity of Cr-O and Cr-V-O in oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with the reduction temperature as determined from the TPR data. The Cr-O catalyst showed activity at temperatures over 225 °C, whereas the Cr-V mixed oxide catalyst showed activities at much higher temperatures over 400 °C. In the present study, TPR result of mixed oxides showed an intermediate reduction at about 366 and 490 °C, respectively (Fig. 3(d–f). The absence of the high temperature reduction peak shows a well dispersed monomeric VOx species. The observed activity and the TPR result indicate the strong correlation between facile reducibility and the activation temperature of the catalyst. Thus the bimetallic supported catalysts were found to be most reactive due to its higher reducibility, thus providing additional sites for oxygen activation.

Fig. 5. Dehydrogenation activity of Cr or V and Cr-V supported MCM-41 for 3 h of time on stream in N2 atmosphere at 550 °C.
Fig. 6 shows the influence of total acidity on the yield of butenes over CrM-41, Cr or V and Cr-V impregnated MCM-41 for the reaction time of 10 min at 550 °C. The total number of acid sites of Cr-V impregnated MCM-41 samples increases linearly with increased vanadium addition and it has a direct effect on the increase the yield of butenes (Fig. 6). The order of the amount of ammonia consumed in the samples is as follows: 1.2Cr2.8V/M-41 ∼ 2.7Cr1.2V/M-41 > 2Cr2V/M-41 > 3.5Cr/M-41 ∼ 3.8V/M-41 > CrM-41 > SiMCM-41. This increase in weak acid sites with vanadium addition could probably be due to the increased concentration of surface-isolated tetrahedral vanadium species [44], [45], [46]. In particular, 1.2Cr2.8V/M-41 showed a high total acidity indicating the presence of large fraction of exposed active V sites. The yield of butenes versus total acidity over CrM-41, Cr or V and Cr-V impregnated MCM-41 measured at the reaction time of 10 min at 550 °C are in the following order: 1.2Cr2.8V/M-41 > 2.7Cr1.2V/M-41 > 2Cr2V/M-41 > 3.5Cr/M-41 > 3.8V/M-41 > CrM-41 > SiMCM-41, respectively. The selectivity to dehydrogenation products over Cr-V-O based MCM-41 can be related to the acid-base character of the catalysts. It has been reported that presence of VOx species favor dehydrogenation, while vanadia over layer or V2O5 crystallites play detrimental role by favoring coke formations [4]. The observed high conversion of 1.2Cr2.8V/M-41 followed by 2.7Cr1.2V/M-41 and 2Cr2V/M-41 shows the presence of dispersed CrOx and VOx species that play an important role for the formation of key intermediate species. The obtained results coincide with the report of Le Bars et al. [47], where they showed a linear relation between conversion rate of ethane and acid surface character of V/SiO2 catalyst in the ODH of ethane.

Fig. 7 presents the dependence of conversion and selectivity to butenes on the reaction temperature over 1.2Cr2.8V/M-41 observed at 10 min of time on stream in N2 atmosphere. It can be observed that an increase of the reaction temperature from 525 to 600 °C resulted in a significant increase in n-butane conversion, but at the expense of butenes selectivity. The conversion improved from 6.1% to 20.1%, while the dehydrogenation selectivity (1-butene, trans 2-butene, cis 2-butene, isobutene, 1,3-butadiene) decreased from 94.7% to 88.5% within the temperature range of 525–600 °C. The cracked products include light hydrocarbons like methane, ethane, ethene, propane and propene that occur at high temperatures. The absence of aromatic and heavier products suggests that cracking occurs through monomolecular mechanism [48]. The initial step of cracking on zeolite has been considered to be a protonation followed by cracking in three paths: (1) to hydrogen and butene; (2) to methane and propene; (3) to ethane and ethene [49]. Narbeshuber [50] attributed the formation of ethene occurs due to secondary cracking of butene isomers via primary carbenium ion formation. The present results with 1.2Cr2.8V/M-41 catalyst are quite similar to dehydrogenation over ZSM-5 based catalyst [51]. The cracking selectivity was defined as the sum of wt.% of products (C1 and C3) or (C2 and C2) divided by total wt.% of cracked products. The cracking pathways: methane and propene, ethane and ethene increases with reaction temperature indicating lower energy activation for dehydrogenation than cracking (Fig. 8).

Fig. 8. Cracking selectivity of 1.2Cr2.8V/M-41 catalysts in n-butane dehydrogenation at 525–600 °C.
Fig. 9 shows the activity of 1.2Cr2.8V/M-41 in ODH of n-butane in CO2 or nitrogen atmosphere at an operating temperature of 550 °C. The flow rate of the reactant mixture (n-butane/nitrogen/CO2 was 4:56:40) was 100 ml/min, respectively, while the catalyst loading was 0.15 g. In the presence of CO2, the catalyst showed 6% n-butane conversion with dehydrogenation selectivity above 90% for the duration of 180 min. However, in the case of N2, though the initial conversion was high at 10%, during the course of reaction time, the conversion fell below 5% indicating rapid deactivation. This result shows that CO2 can be regarded as a good promoter in butane dehydrogenation. Michorczyk et al. [34] reported similar positive effect in propane dehydrogenation, where the selectivity to propene was maintained above 80%.

4. Conclusions
The study shows the preparation and characterization of mono (Cr or V) and bimetallic (Cr-V) based MCM-41 catalysts. The XRD results reveal that the CrOx and VOx species are well dispersed without any detectable crystalline peaks. The BET results indicate that in impregnated samples the mesoporous hexagonal is well retained with uniform pore size distributions. According to TPR results, the absence of considerable amount of polymeric vanadium species in bimetallic system clearly indicates a promoted dispersion of VOx species in the presence of CrOx species. The H2 consumptions (mmol/g) were in the following order: 1.2Cr2.8V/M-41 > 3.8V/M-41 (0.655) > 2Cr2V/M-41 (0.605) > 2.7Cr1.2V/M-41 (0.495) > CrM-41 (0.385) > 3.5Cr/M-41 (0.285), respectively. The amount of ammonia consumed in the samples is as follows: 1.2Cr2.8V/M-41 ∼ 2.7Cr1.2V/M-41 > 2Cr2V/M-41 > 3.5Cr/M-41 ∼ 3.8V/M-41 > CrM-41 > SiMCM-41. The increased surface acidity shows the stronger interaction of mixed oxides over support than that of the mono metal oxide supported catalysts. Concomitantly, the catalytic selectivity can be related to the uniform dispersion of Cr, V and surface acidity of the catalysts. 1.2Cr2.8V/M-41 showed highest butane conversion of 20.1% and butenes selectivity 88.5% at 600 °C. In addition, it is shown that CO2 atmosphere has a promoting effect on catalysts stability accompanied with slightly increased butane conversion.
