Abstract
We demonstrate that refinery-grade propane/propylene mixtures, rather than polymer-grade propylene, can be used for industrial propylene hydroformylation with Rh/BiPhePhos catalyst complexes. Because propylene hydroformylation is selective, an enriched propane stream is produced, which may be recycled for producing more propylene. In addition to the potential energy savings and associated economic/environmental benefits, the mixed propane/propylene feed also provides reaction benefits by volumetrically expanding the reaction mixture to yield gas-expanded liquids (GXLs) with tunable physicochemical properties. Unlike conventional reaction media, the H2/CO ratio in GXL media can be enhanced by simply increasing the partial pressure of propane. For rhodium/triphenylphosphine catalyzed propylene hydroformylation in propane-expanded liquids, performed between 343.15 K and 363.15 K and pressures up to 2.0 MPa, the n/i aldehyde ratio is increased by up to 45% (corresponding to an increase in n-aldehyde selectivity from 71% to 78%). This is attributed to the increased H2/CO ratio in the GXL phase. At identical operating conditions, such enhancements are not seen in the case of bidentate ligands wherein electronic effects likely exert more influence on the n/i ratio.

1. Introduction
The hydroformylation reaction, also known as “oxo synthesis”, comprises the addition of syngas (the mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) to the double bond of an alkene yielding the aldehydes (Fig. 1). It is one of the most important homogeneous catalysis reactions, industrially used to produce basic building blocks for myriad consumer goods, including pharmaceuticals, detergents, plastics, and many more (Castillón and Fernández, 2000, Franke et al., 2012). More than 75% of the existing industrial hydroformylation units in the world are used for propylene hydroformylation, wherein propylene is reacted with syngas to produce butyraldehyde. Besides the desired linear n-aldehydes, branched isoaldehydes can also be formed in a parallel reaction (Bernas et al., 2008, Bohnen and Cornils, 2002).

Industrial hydroformylation processes use either cobalt- or rhodium-based catalyst complexes. Propylene hydroformylation processes use rhodium-based catalysts that they allow operation at relatively mild conditions, are more active and also selective toward the preferred linear aldehyde (Riisager et al., 2005). The regioselectivity (n/i) is influenced by the type of ligands used to form the Rh complex, the H2/CO ratio in the reaction phase and the nature of the solvents used (Bahrmann et al., 1997, Evans et al., 1968, Natta et al., 2002, Takegami et al., 1969, Tucci, 1970). In most reported studies of propylene hydroformylation, high purity propylene (up to 99.5% propylene or polymer-grade) is used as feedstock. Polymer-grade propylene costs 50% more than refinery-grade propylene (60–70% purity). The use of polymer-grade propylene makes sense if it is readily available on site from feedstock that is specifically made for manufacturing polypropylene with a much higher capacity. However, if propylene is made on site from a propane dehydrogenation unit, it may be more economical to use the cheaper propane + propylene mixture as feedstock. Further, propane + propylene mixtures may also provide process advantages because of the increased ability of the mixture to expand the liquid reaction phase. It should be noted that compressed propylene (the substrate) by itself will expand the hydroformylation reaction mixture. However, the addition of unreactive propane expands the reaction mixture further to provide more tunability of the reaction mixture. Throughout the manuscript, we refer to the reaction mixture containing propylene and propane as the PXL phase.
We have previously shown that the H2/CO ratio can be easily tuned in CO2-expanded liquids (CXLs) with pressure such that the TOF and n/i are maximized (Jin and Subramaniam, 2004, Jin et al., 2006). In comparison to CO2 (Tc = 304.15 K; Pc = 7.38 MPa), propane (Tc = 369.75 K; Pc = 4.25 MPa) and propylene (Tc = 364.25 K; Pc = 4.55 MPa) possess much higher critical temperatures but lower critical pressures. Consequently, propane and propylene can expand organic solvents at higher temperatures and lower pressures. Similar to CXLs, reaction media expanded by either propylene or a mixture of propylene and propane have the potential to enhance propylene hydroformylation. In this context, we have recently shown that the solubilities of H2 and CO in either propane-expanded or propylene-expanded organic solvents are greater than those in the neat solvents, by as high as 78% at 70 °C and 1.5 MPa (Liu et al., 2018a, Xie et al., 2009).
In this manuscript, we experimentally quantify the volumetric expansion of typical hydroformylation mixtures by propane and propylene and investigate homogeneous propylene hydroformylation in PXLs with conventional rhodium-based catalysts modified by various ligands. The experimental results reveal that refinery-grade propane/propylene mixtures may indeed be directly used for performing propylene hydroformylation. In addition to the tunable syngas solubility and increased regioselectivity afforded by the PXL media, an enriched propane stream is also produced. Thus, this reactive separation alleviates the need for energy-intensive separation of propane and propylene by conventional distillation.

2.2. Apparatus and methods
2.2.1. Volumetric expansion and phase equilibrium studies
The equipment and procedures used for volumetric expansion and phase equilibrium studies are described elsewhere (Jin and Subramaniam, 2004, Xie et al., 2009). For measuring the volumetric expansion of organic solvents, a Jerguson® view cell was used. In a typical run, a known quantity of a simulated reaction mixture consisting of the solvent used for propylene hydroformylation was placed in the view cell either with or without dissolved catalyst complex. This liquid phase is then brought to the desired temperature by external heating. Either dense propane or propylene is then gradually introduced through a dip tube immersed in the liquid phase to achieve predetermined partial pressures. The expansion of the organic liquid by propane or propylene was recorded in terms of the relative increase in the liquid volume from the initial state (C3-free, equilibrated pressure, P0) to the final state (C3-expanded, equilibrated pressure, P) at the same temperature. The volumetric expansion ratio was calculated using Eq. (1).
(1)
The solubilities of CO and H2 in propylene and/or propane-expanded phases are measured by using a Supercritical Fluid Technologies® variable-volume equilibrium cell equipped with on-line sampling of the vapor and liquid phases. Details of this equipment and its operation are provided elsewhere (Liu et al., 2018a, Xie et al., 2009).
2.2.2. Hydroformylation experiments
The hydroformylation reactions were performed in a 50 cm3 high-pressure Parr reactor. A schematic of the reactor setup is shown in Fig. 3. Mixing is provided by a magnetic stirrer with a maximum agitation rate of 1700 rpm. Pressure and temperature are monitored by a Labview® data acquisition system and controlled with a Parr 4840 controller. Syngas is introduced from an external gas reservoir equipped with a pressure regulator and a pressure transducer. The pressure regulator, located at the exit of the reservoir, is used to admit syngas and maintain a constant total pressure in the reactor. The pressure transducer monitors the total pressure in the reservoir which drops due to syngas and propylene consumption from the gas phase. The reactor lid is equipped with ports to admit propane and/or propylene, a product sampling line, a pressure transducer, a thermocouple, and a safety rupture disc (HIP rated to 33.6 MPa).

Fig. 3. Schematic of reactor setup for investigating homogeneous hydroformylation in neat and propane-expanded solvents.
In a typical run, a known amount of liquid solution containing the dissolved catalyst precursor, ligand, internal standard (decane) and the organic solvent is first introduced into the reactor and heated to the desired temperature with stirring. Following this step, predetermined amounts of either propylene or propane followed by propylene are pumped to predetermined partial pressures. The partial pressures are chosen based on the volumetric expansion studies to maintain the same initial volume of the homogeneous reaction mixture in all cases. Stirring is temporarily halted and the premixed syngas (molar CO/H2 = 1) from the gas reservoir is then introduced into the reactor to the desired partial pressure. The stirrer speed is then increased to 1000 rpm to start the reaction. The reactor pressure is maintained constant by continuously replenishing syngas from an external reservoir.
The substrate conversion, regioselectivity and turnover frequency (TOF) are defined as follows:
(2)
The moles of propylene fed to the reactor are estimated from the volume of liquefied propylene injected by the syringe pump into the reactor. The moles of propylene consumed by reaction are estimated from the monoaldehydes products formed. In most cases, only linear and branched butyraldehydes (>99%) are detected by GC analysis and hence the conversion calculation can be based on moles of aldehyde products formed. The hydrogen and carbon mole balances were estimated by comparing the moles of syngas consumed with the moles of hydrogen and carbon added to the products. The total moles of hydrogen and carbon depleted from the external reservoir is generally more than what can be accounted for by product formation. However, even at the highest conversion in this manuscript (20%), this discrepancy is no greater than 8%. This is because syngas is also drawn into the reactor from the reservoir when some propylene is transferred from the vapor phase to the liquid phase upon reaction. Sample calculations for propylene conversion and syngas consumption along with the molar carbon + hydrogen balance deficits are provided in the supplementary materials (Section S1 and Table S1).
The regioselectivity (n/i) is estimated as the molar ratio of the linear to branched aldehydes in the product.
(3)
Since each mole of propylene react with two moles of syngas (H2/CO = 1:1), the TOF is estimated as follows, assuming negligible propylene transfer from the vapor phase to the liquid phase at low (∼5%) propylene conversion, based on monoaldehydes formation.

Uncertainties in measured TOF, conversion and selectivity data are within ±5% of mean values.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Volumetric expansion of organic solvents by propane and propylene
The operating conditions (organic solvent volume, propane/propylene pressures, temperature) for performing homogeneous hydroformylation are determined from volumetric expansion studies of representative reaction mixtures. Fig. 4 shows the volumetric expansion of toluene by propylene and propane at pressures up to 2.0 MPa at 343.15 K. The volume of the liquid mixture increases exponentially upon either propane or propylene pressurization (by up to twofold at 1.5 MPa for propane and 1.7 MPa for propylene), with propane providing a greater expansion at a given pressure. The results clearly confirm that at typical industrial hydroformylation conditions (1.0–1.8 MPa, 70–110 °C), the reaction mixture undergoes significant volumetric expansion by propylene (the substrate). The experimental expansion data are predicted reasonably well by simulations performed using Aspen Plus® software employing the Peng-Robinson equation of state (Tester and Modell, 1997, Xu and Sandler, 1987). Our recent work has demonstrated that this methodology satisfactorily predicts the experimental VLE data of these systems (Liu et al., 2018a, Xie et al., 2009).

The volumetric expansion behavior of toluene by propane at 353.15 K and 363.15 K is presented in Fig. 5. The volumetric expansion by propane was greater and more sensitive to pressure at the lower temperature (353.15 K) as compared to the higher temperatures (363.15 K). This trend is to be expected given that the propane density (and, therefore, its solubility) in the PXL phase decreases with an increase in temperature. As inferred from Fig. 5, no significant variation in the expansion behavior is observed at 363.15 K with and without dissolved catalyst complexes because of the relatively dilute catalyst concentrations (2.21 mmol/L).

Knowledge of the extent of volume expansion of typical hydroformylation reaction mixtures by compressed propane and propylene at the reactor operating conditions (P and T) is essential for rational reactor design and operation. Fig. 6 shows the volumetric expansion effects of propylene (0.60 MPa) and propane (up to 1.6 MPa) on various solvents (toluene, NX-795 and butanol) containing dissolved Rh catalyst complex. NX-795 solvent consists of butyraldehyde oligomers (mostly trimers) and is used in some industrial propylene hydroformylation processes as the solvent. As inferred from the expansion curves (Fig. 6), all the tested solvents demonstrate good miscibility with propane/propylene at relatively mild pressures (up to 1.5 MPa, consisting of 0.6 MPa propylene and propane). At identical temperature and pressure. the volumetric expansion for toluene is greater than those of NX-795 and butanol. No catalyst precipitation was observed in the investigated P and T ranges indicating that under typical hydroformylation conditions, the Rh/TPP catalyst complex remains dissolved in these PXL phases. This was found to be the case with all the catalyst complexes listed in Fig. 2 (see Supplementary Materials Section S2 and Fig. S1).

3.2. Effects of propane and propylene on H2/CO ratio in the expanded phase
The equilibrium solubilities of CO and H2 were measured in typical reaction mixtures expanded by either propylene or propane. To avoid reaction, catalyst complexes were excluded from the reaction mixture. The H2 and CO concentrations in the liquid phase at 343.15 K with and without propane or propylene are shown in Table 2. The standard deviations are ±5% for all data points. The initial composition for the measurement is also presented in the supplementary materials (Section S3, Tables S2 and S3).

As can be seen from Table 2, both H2 and CO concentrations increased when pressurized with syngas alone, while the H2/CO ratio in the liquid phase remains constant. This is because the gas solubilities follow Henry’s law and the CO solubility is greater than that of H2 in toluene. However, when replacing syngas in excess of 0.60 MPa with either propane or propylene, the H2/CO ratio in the liquid phase is enhanced with increasing partial pressures of either propane or propylene. For example, while the H2/CO ratio in the neat toluene is 0.46 with 2.0 MPa syngas (Table 2, Entry 6), it increases to 0.59 with 0.60 MPa syngas + 1.40 MPa propane and to 0.55 with 0.60 MPa syngas + 1.40 MPa propylene. Clearly, H2 is more soluble in propane or propylene-expanded toluene than in the mixture pressurized with syngas alone, causing the H2/CO to increase as more propane is added. The increased H2/CO ratio is attributed to the high solubility of pressurized propane and propylene in the liquid phase (Fig. 4) which increases the free volume of the expanded phase. In addition, the polarity of the expanded phase is continuously diminished by the addition of either propane or propylene. Less polar phases tend to favor syngas solubilities (Ford et al., 2008). Further, the enhanced H2/CO in propane-expanded liquid relative to propylene-expanded liquid correlates with the higher volumetric expansion caused by propane. As seen from Table 3, H2/CO enhancement is also seen in propane- and propylene expanded NX-795, which is a polar solvent similar to the aldehyde products. This tunability of H2/CO ratio in the expanded phase favors TOF and regioselectivity during propylene hydroformylation as discussed in the following section.

3.3. Reaction studies
3.3.1. Benchmark reaction
Early industrial process for propylene hydroformylation employed a rhodium- triphenylphosphine (TPP) catalyst in the low pressure oxo (LPO) process. The TPP ligand is used in a large excess (molar P/Rh up to 250) to stabilize the catalyst complex and to maximize the n/i ratio (Franke et al., 2012, Tudor and Ashley, 2007). The latest version of the LPO process uses bidentate phosphine ligands (such as Dow LP oxo SELECTOR 30 technology) employing relatively low molar P/Rh ratio (3–15) to obtain high chemo- and regioselectivities. Linear aldehyde selectivity exceeding 95% is attained at a relatively moderate temperature and pressure (e.g., 373.15 K, 2.0 MPa) (Wiese and Obst, 2006).
We first benchmarked propylene hydroformylation with Rh/BiPhePhos catalysts in toluene and PXL media at typical industrial process conditions. The reactions were performed at 363.15 K with a syngas partial pressure of 0.60 MPa. As summarized in Table 4, more than 95% n-butyraldehyde selectivity is obtained in pure toluene which matches well with the conventional process (Wiese and Obst, 2006). For the reaction in PXLs, the total pressure is kept constant (1.0 MPa) by partially replacing propylene with propane, while maintaining an identical volume of both the “neat” and PXL phases. While propane addition dilutes the propylene concentration in the PXL phase and therefore decreases the reaction rate, it has less effect on the n/i ratio (Entries 1–3, Table 4). To eliminate the dilution effect caused by propane addition in the batch reactor, the propylene and propane partial pressures were varied, based on calculation methods developed previously (Liu et al., 2018a) to ensure that the initial propylene concentration in the PXL phase is identical to the other runs (Entries 4 & 5, Table 4). Under such conditions, the regioselectivity and the TOFs are comparable to the values observed without propane addition. Thus, the advantages of using PXLs are as follows: (a) the use of relatively inexpensive refinery grade propylene (that contains more than 30% propane) as feedstock; (b) selective removal of propylene by reaction thereby enriching the propane stream; and (c) >40% replacement of the organic solvent with compressed propane that is easily separated and recycled.

3.3.2. Ligand effect
The performances of several conventional mono-phosphine ligands (TPP, CHDP and TPPA) for propylene hydroformylation were also assessed in toluene and PXL media. The results are summarized in Table 5. At identical Rh concentration and P/Rh mole ratio, the Rh/TPP catalyst shows higher TOF and n/i in neat toluene compared to other monophosphine ligands (entries 1–3, Table 5). This is consistent with previous observations (Bernas et al., 2008). Over all three catalyst complexes, the n/i ratio in PXL media (entries 4–6, Table 5) is higher than in neat toluene. For the TPPA ligand, the increase is more than 35%. The enhanced catalyst performance was achieved by propylene/propane mixtures with 30 vol% of toluene being replaced with propane in the liquid phase. However, none of the ligands matched the performance of the BiPhePhos ligand (Table 4) suggesting that electronic effects are far more important compared to solvent effects in determining the yield of the linear aldehyde.

3.3.3. Effect of H2/CO ratio
The Wilkinson mechanism is commonly accepted for phosphine-modified rhodium-catalyzed hydroformylation of terminal olefins (Evans et al., 1968, Pruett, 1979). It is believed that the regioselectivity is largely dictated by the competitive reaction of the alkene with the intermediates (3), (4) shown in Fig. 7 resulting in either high or low n/i ratio, respectively. The progressive substitution of TPP by CO attachment to the Rh center is believed to worsen the regioselectivity. Thus, for a given catalytic system, it is plausible that at certain CO concentrations in the liquid phase the three PPh3 ligands could all be displaced by CO, resulting in lower regioselectivities (Bohnen and Cornils, 2002, Xie et al., 2015).

Fig. 7. Simplified mechanism for Rh-catalyzed hydroformylation to form linear and branched products.
The effects of H2 and CO concentrations on substrate conversions and product selectivities for olefin hydroformylation have been studied in various solvent media, including organic liquids (Bernas et al., 2008), ionic liquids (Bronger et al., 2002), scCO2 (Palo and Erkey, 1999) and gas-expanded solvents (Jin and Subramaniam, 2004, Xie et al., 2015). In general, higher H2 concentrations and lower CO concentrations in the reaction phase favor higher rates and linear aldehyde selectivity. Table 6 presents the effect of H2/CO mole ratio in the feed on Rh-catalyzed propylene hydroformylation in neat and propane-expanded toluene. Higher H2/CO ratios significantly increase the n/i ratio in both the neat solvent (entries 1–3, Table 6) and PXLs (entries 4–6, Table 6). At identical H2/CO ratio in the feed, the n/i ratio in PXLs is more compared to toluene, which is attributed to the higher H2/CO ratio in the PXL phase. While the TOFs increase slightly with H2/CO ratio in the case of the neat solvent, there is a ∼10% increase in the case of PXLs (entries 4–6, Table 6). This is consistent with the higher H2/CO ratios in PXLs. It must be noted that higher H2/CO ratios tend to promote hydrogenation reaction. Approximately 15 mol% of propane is formed at a H2/CO ratio of 2, which is not observed at lower H2/CO ratios in either neat toluene or PXLs.

3.3.4. Effect of solvent replacement with propane
Propylene hydroformylation was performed at 343.15 K with Rh/TPP complexes in PXLs with identical initial propylene concentrations in the PXL phase containing the dissolved complex. This is achieved by varying the volumetric expansion ratios and relative partial pressures of propane and propylene based on modeling results. The propane concentration in the propylene feed is varied from 0% to mole 37%. The corresponding increase in the V/V0 ratio ranges from 1.1 to 1.9. As seen in Table 7, comparable TOF and higher n/i ratio were achieved in the PXL media. The n/i ratio increased by 44% as the volumetric expansion ratio (V/Vo) increases from 1.1 to 1.9 (entries 1–4, Table 7). The volumetric expansion may be viewed as solvent replacement by the expansion gas. Thus, at the highest expansion ratio (V/Vo = 1.9), toluene replacement by propane in the expanded reaction mixture is approximately 48%.

When toluene is expanded by pure propylene alone, the TOF increased from 26.32 min−1 at V/Vo = 1 (entry 1, Table 7) to 52.81 min−1 at V/Vo = 1.7 (entry 7, Table 7). However, the n/i ratio increase from 2.51 to 3.2 is approximately 28%. In contrast, the corresponding n/i increase in the PXL phase (entries 1 and 4, Table 7) is 44%. This is attributed to the generally higher H2/CO ratio in the PXL phase (see Table 2, Table 3). Similar trends were also observed for cobalt catalyzed hydroformylation in butane-expanded liquids (Liu et al., 2018b).
3.3.5. Effect of organic solvents
Solvents have a significant effect on the hydroformylation of olefins. The general roles of conventional solvents and gas-expanded liquids in multiphase catalytic processes have been recently reviewed (Subramaniam et al., 2014). Conventional hydroformylation reactions usually employ a high boiling mixture of aldehyde condensation products (dimers, trimers and tetramers) as the solvent (Eisenschmid and Mokhtarzadeh, 2014, Wiese and Obst, 2006). A solvent used in industrial propylene hydroformylation processes is NX-795 which is composed of butyraldehyde oligomers. Hence, in addition to toluene, we also investigated the reaction in NX-795 and butanol. Table 8 summarizes the results of propylene hydroformylation performed in neat solvents as well as PXLs. For the reaction in neat organic solvents, the highest TOF is observed in toluene while butanol shows the highest n/i ratio (Entries 1–3, Table 8). In PXL media, while the TOFs were not significantly altered, the n/i ratio increased for all solvents, with propane-expanded butanol showing the largest increase of ∼45% (entries 4–6, Table 8).

4. Conclusions
The homogeneous hydroformylation of propylene in propane- and propylene- expanded solvent media with Rh-based catalyst complexes was investigated. Volumetric expansion studies show that both propane and propylene can significantly expand typical hydroformylation solvents, by approximately 2-fold at a propane pressure of 15 bar and 343.15 K. The H2/CO ratio in the reaction media may be tuned with either propane or propylene addition at fixed syngas feed composition and partial pressure, with the ratio being higher in propane-expanded liquids or PXLs. For Rh catalyzed propylene hydroformylation using bidentate BiPhePhos ligand, the n/i ratio and TOF are comparable with those observed during conventional processes in neat solvent. In contrast, clear increases in n/i ratio are observed during Rh-catalyzed propylene hydroformylation in PXL media with monophosphine ligands (triphenylphosphine, cyclohexyldiphenylphosphine, triphenylphosphate). However, the TOFs and regioselectivity are much lower than those obtained with the Rh/BiPhePhos complex. Our results show clearly that refinery grade propylene (rather than polymer-grade propylene) can be used in industrial hydroformylation processes involving Rh/BiphePhos complexes without any adverse effects on TOF or product selectivity. The selective conversion of propylene during hydroformylation produces an enriched propane stream thus providing effective, less energy-intensive separation of propane and propylene.
