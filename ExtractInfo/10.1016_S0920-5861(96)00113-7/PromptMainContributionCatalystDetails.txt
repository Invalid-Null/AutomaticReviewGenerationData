Catalytic partial oxidation of propane to acrolein
Abstract
Results are discussed on the direct oxidation of propane to acrolein on MexOγ-supported Ag0.01Bi0.85V0.54Mo0.45Ox (MexOγ = γ-Al2O3, TiO2, SiO2) and on Me7Bi5Mo12Ox (Me = Mg, Ca, Zn) catalysts. Almost no formation of acrolein was observed over MexOγ-supported catalysts although active phases for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (dispersed VOx species) and oxygen insertion in propene (scheelite structure) were present. For Me-Bi-Mo-O, selectivities to acrolein and COx depended on the nature of the third cation and reaction mixture used. The acrolein selectivities amounted to 34 and 20% (yields of 3.2 and 2.7%) when using Ca7Bi5Mo12Ox and Mg7Bi5Mo12Ox, respectively. Redox properties were found to be an important factor determining the reaction pathways. Tentatively it can be concluded that different types of lattice oxygen are involved in propane dehydrogenation to propene and consecutive reactions towards acrolein and COx. Under conditions of effective propane dehydrogenation to propene a competitive reaction between an allylic intermediate and propane forming propene and propyl radical can be assumed as the reason for low acrolein formation in favour to propene. Applying a two layer fixed bed reactor an acrolein yield of 7.4% (S = 20%) was obtained.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
