H2 Evolution at a Reduced Hybrid Polyoxometalate and Its Vanadium-Oxo Derivative Used as Molecular Models for Reducible Metal Oxides
Abstract
We herein report our investigations on the use of a tris-silanol-decorated polyoxotungstate, [SbW9O33(tBuSiOH)3]3–, as a molecular support model to describe the coordination of an isolated vanadium atom at metal oxides, focusing on the reactivity of the reduced derivatives in the presence of protons. Accumulation of electrons and protons at an active site is a main feature associated with heterogeneous catalysts able to conduct the (oxy)dehydrogenation of alkanes or alcohols. Our results indicate that two–electron reduced derivatives release H2 upon protonation, a reaction that probably takes place at the polyoxotungstic framework rather than at the vanadium center.

Synopsis
A tris-silanol-decorated polyoxotungstate and its vanadium-oxo derivative were chemically reduced by two electrons and isolated. Their protonation leads to the release of hydrogen, a reaction that takes place in both cases at the polyoxotungstic fragment.
Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The design of robust inorganic systems for the accumulation of multiple reduction equivalents at a single site is a key step toward the development of innovative catalytic materials able to face the numerous environmental and energy-related challenges. (1,2) Among numerous examples, (oxy)dehydrogenation of light alkanes, partial dehydrogenation of alcohols, but also dinitrogen activation/reduction toward ammonia and CO2 reduction are reactions in which the pivotal role of active sites is to accumulate electrons and protons and to assist their transfers, in concerted processes or in elementary steps. (3−5) Polyoxometalates (POMs), and more particularly W and Mo derivatives of the Keggin and Wells–Dawson series, have found applications in energy-related domains, including the hydrogen evolution reaction. (6−11) Considered as molecular metal-oxides, POMs display properties of high interests within this context, which include their robustness toward temperature and oxidative conditions and their ability to behave as electron and proton acceptors. (12,13) The redox properties of POM are sensitive to the nature of their associated counterions and particularly to the presence of protons. Upon their reduction, the basicity of POM increases and, in the presence of an acid source, an anodic shift of the redox potentials is generally observed which testifies to the emergence of proton-assisted redox processes. (14−18) These features make POMs ideal candidates to study the conversion of raw substrates to energy-rich chemical fuels or feedstocks.
We recently developed a molecular model for single-site vanadium isolated on silica and reducible metal-oxides. (19,20)Scheme 1 sketches the rigid and preorganized C3v symmetric tris-silanol environment provided by the functionalization of [α-B-SbW9O33]9– with tert-butyltrichlorosilane, SiloxPOM (0), and its ability to accommodate a {d0-VO}3+ to give [SbW9O33(tBuSiO)3VO]3– (1). As it relates with heterogeneous catalysis, supported vanadium oxides have been reported throughout the literature of C1–C4 alkane partial oxidation, including oxidative propane dehydrogenation. (21,22) In the latter case, a simple relationship between catalyst activity and the reducibility of the active site (or the oxygen defect formation enthalpy) has been clearly established. Hybrid polyoxometalates (23,24) therefore bring new structures with versatile redox properties that may be useful to gain molecular insights in the electron and proton transfers at metal oxides. (25) It is worth remembering that reduction of compound 1 by two reductive equivalents led to a unique case of a bireduced heteropolyanion derivative with completely decoupled d1-V(IV) and d1-W(V) as a triplet ground state. (20) We were thus interested in studying the behavior of such reduced species in the presence of protons in order to evaluate its ability to collect the reducing equivalents and protons on a single site to either produce a dihydrogen molecule or to promote an oxygen-atom vacancy through the release of a water molecule, a process that is often proposed in metal oxides.

Electrochemical Studies
The redox properties of the tris-silanol-decorated polyoxotungstate, [SbW9O33(tBuSiOH)3]3– (0), and its vanadium-oxo derivative (1) have already been investigated by cyclic voltammetry and spectroelectrochemical techniques in deoxygenated acetonitrile solutions. (20) In the reduction part both compounds are characterized by three quasi-reversible electrochemical events, each one corresponding to a monoelectronic process (Table 1). For compound 1, the first process has been previously attributed to a reduction localized at the vanadium center while the second and third processes correspond to the reduction of the polyoxotungstic framework. The comparison of the two cyclic voltammograms shows that it is overall easier to accumulate electrons on the vanadium derivative (1) than on the starting SiloxPOM (0) albeit both compounds display identical charge. For our study purposes, we carried out the electrochemical study of both compounds in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid. As previously mentioned, the redox potentials of POM assemblies are sensitive to the nature of the charge-compensating counterions. Specifically, the presence of protons results in anodic shifts of the electrochemical events, which in some cases may also result in redox-potential inversions leading to multielectron–multiproton transfer events.

Figure 1a displays the evolution of the cyclic voltammogram of 0 upon the addition of 5 and 10 equiv of trifluoroacetic acid (as a proton source). The second and third electrochemical events are particularly affected with an anodic shift of the cathodic peak potentials (Epc,i) of +300 mV and +800 mV, respectively (Table 1). This reflects the higher reducibility of the polyoxotungstic framework and the emergence of proton-assisted electron transfers. Cycling after this first cathodic peak indicates that the electrochemical event is slow but probably reversible (Figure S1). Oxidation waves in the voltammograms reported in Figure 1a are difficult to assign because of the coexistence of reduced species at different levels of protonation. Upon addition of a larger amount of trifluoroacetic acid (100 equiv), a catalytic cathodic current eventually associated with the reduction of the protons appears around −1.2 V vs SCE (Figure S1). At first glance, the electrochemical properties of [SbW9O33(tBuSiO)3VO]3– (1) in acidic media are slightly different (Figure 1b). Upon addition of 5 equiv of trifluoroacetic acid, the first reduction, centered on the vanadium center, undergoes a +120 mV shift in the presence of protons (Epc,1 = −0.37 V vs SCE), and cycling after this first cathodic peak also indicates that the electrochemical event is irreversible (Figure S2). The second electrochemical event, which corresponds to the first reduction at the tungstic oxide framework, is very well-defined, showing a cathodic peak-potential at −0.63 V (vs SCE) shifted by +350 mV compared to that of compound 1 in nonacidic conditions. It thus involves the [(H)SbW9O33(tBuSiO)3VIVO]3–/[(H)2Sb{WVI8WV}O33(tBuSiO)3VIVO]3– couple, and it is worth noting that this second electrochemical event is at the same potential as the first reduction of compound 0 under acidic conditions involving isocharged species [SbW9O33(tBuSiOH)3]3–/[(H)Sb{WVI8WV}O33(tBuSiOH)3]3– (Epc,1 = −0.6 V vs SCE). Similarly, the next two redox processes, which are very close to each other, are also similar to the second and third redox processes of compound 0. Finally, in the presence of a larger amount of protons (100 equiv) an electrocatalytic current also appears around −1.3 V (Figure S2). This set of experiments tends to indicate that proton reduction takes place at the polyoxotungstic framework and that the presence of the {VO} moiety does not seem to interfere with the hydrogen evolution reaction.

Chemical Reduction and Protonation Reactions
We proceeded to the chemical reductions of compounds 0 and 1 and studied their reactivity toward a proton donor (see SI) in order to understand the irreversibility of the first redox process associated to compound 1, to determine the nature of the species involved, and to confirm the release of H2. As previously reported, (20) we used sodium naphthalenide (0.2 M in THF) as a stoichiometric reductive agent to prepare and isolate the one-electron and two-electron reduced species of [SbW9O33(tBuSiOH)3]3– and [SbW9O33(tBuSiO)3VO]3–, respectively, labeled 0·(1e), 0·(2e), 1·(1e), and 1·(2e).
Reaction of lutidinium trifluorosulfonate, [LutH][OTf], as a proton source with fully oxidized [SbW9O33(tBuSiO)3VO]3– in tetrahydrofuran did not lead to any significant acid–base reaction (Figure S3) whereas reaction with the one-electron reduced derivative, the vanadium(IV) complex [SbW9O33(tBuSiO)3VIVO]4–, 1·(1e), led to the new compound, 1·(1e/H+), as sketched in Scheme 1. NMR monitoring in deuterated THF indicated that the reaction is quantitative, as revealed by the disappearance of the signal corresponding to the acidic proton in [LutH][Tf] and the full release of 2,6-lutidine (Figure S4). It is then rather difficult to unambiguously determine the location of such a small and mobile electrophile by spectroscopy, either in solution or at the solid state. Although the NMR spectrum of isolated 1·(1e/H+) is ill defined, as a consequence of the paramagnetic contribution of the vanadium(IV) ion, there are two key observations: (i) the signal corresponding to the tert-butyl groups is split into two peaks at a 2:1 ratio, demonstrating a lower symmetry; (ii) a new singlet at 5.56 ppm (integrating for ca. 1H) appears. Accordingly and given the spin density at the O3V═O moiety, due to the presence of a d1-V(IV) center, (20) it is reasonable to suggest that the proton is localized at the V–O–Si sites in 1·(1e/H+). FTIR spectroscopy analysis of isolated 1·(1e/H+) supports this proposition. A weak and broad band, analogous to the SiO–H stretch in compound 0, appears at 3440 cm–1, whereas the bands associated to the V═O stretch at 1042 and 1013 cm–1 are only slightly affected in 1·(1e/H+) compared to compounds 1 and 1·(1e) (Figure S5). This latter observation also supports that protonation does not occur at the oxo ligand of the {V═O} moiety. Thus, there is no formation of {VIV–OH} species in our SiloxPOM system, an intermediate often proposed in mechanisms involving the formation of oxygen atom vacancy, i.e., {VIII–OH2}, at vanadium oxide surfaces active in dehydrogenation reactions. (21,27) All combined, these results also fully explain the irreversibility of the first electrochemical event that was observed during cyclic voltammetry studies.
Surprisingly, reaction of [LutH][OTf] with the bireduced species [Sb{WVWVI8}O33(tBuSiO)3VIVO]5–, 1·(2e), led also to the formation of the monoreduced protonated compound [(H)SbW9O33(tBuSiO)3VIVO]3–, 1·(1e/H+), as evidenced by NMR spectroscopy and UV–vis monitoring. After the addition of 2 equiv of [LutH][OTf] to a solution of 1·(2e) in THF, the deep blue coloration, which is associated to the reduction at the tungsten oxide core, instantaneously vanished. Accordingly, the intense bands in the vis and NIR regions, typical of metal–metal and intervalence charge transfers (IVCT) from W(V) to W(VI), completely disappeared (Figure 2). This body of experiments indicates that the reaction between compound 1·(2e) and protons led to the complete formation of 1·(1e/H+) and the coupled loss of one electron with one proton, which evolves as H2 as evidenced by NMR monitoring and gas-phase analysis (see Figure S6).

To decipher whether the polyoxotungstic framework is responsible by itself for the hydrogen evolution reaction, as suggested by the cyclic voltammetry studies, we explored the reactivity of the one-electron-reduced derivative, [Sb{WVWVI8}O33(tBuSiOH)3]4–, and the two-electron-reduced derivative, [Sb{WV2WVI7}O33(tBuSiOH)3]5–, with 1 and 2 equiv of [LutH][OTf], respectively. In the case of 0·(1e), H2 was not detected and, similarly to 1·(1e/1H+), a monoreduced monoprotonated [(H)Sb{WVWVI8}O33(tBuSiOH)3]3– species formed. Evolution of the profile of the UV–vis spectrum is highlighted in Figure 3a. In the case of the two-electron-reduced species 0·(2e), gas-phase analysis revealed the evolution of H2 when 2 equiv of [LutH][OTf] was added (Figure S7). Figure 3b displays the evolution of the UV–vis spectrum of the bireduced [Sb{WV2WVI7}O33(tBuSiOH)3]5– upon the addition of protons. The bands associated to the metal–metal and WV/VI IVCT are modified but do not vanish, highlighting that the reaction did not lead to the fully oxidized compound 0, a scenario that is similar to the one using the vanadium derivative 1. Instead, the reaction probably stopped at the monoreduced monoprotonated species, [(H)Sb{WVWVI8}O33(tBuSiOH)3]3–, as suggested by a linear combination of UV–vis spectra (Figure S8) that indicates the presence of 0·(1e/1H+) as a major product (>80%). (28) These results apparently differ from the electrochemical studies, that indicated an electrocatalytic reduction of the protons after the third redox process, i.e., after the accumulation of at least three reductive equivalents onto the POM. The fact that H2 formation is also observed starting from bireduced species only can be tentatively explained by a bimolecular reaction as follows. Upon addition of [LutH][OTf], protonated species may coexist with nonprotonated species. In that case, intermolecular electron transfer may occur between non (or less) protonated species, that exhibit more negative redox potentials, and the more protonated species. This suggestion is supported by the electrochemical studies which point out the following two points. First, the anodic shifts of the potentials in the presence of protons induce a ΔEpc,2 ∼ 0.32 V for 0 and ∼0.39 V for 1 and, second, the predominance domain of the bireduced species, 0·(2e) and 1·(2e), overlap with the predominance domain of the expected three-electron-reduced species in the presence of protons (Figure 4 and Figure S9). Therefore, such an electron transfer would induce an accumulation of three reductive equivalents on a single entity, resulting in the formation of hydrogen (use of two reductive equivalents) and a monoreduced monoprotonated compound (the remaining reductive equivalent).

Vanadium oxide-based catalysts are known to promote many hydrocarbon oxidation reactions, including dehydrogenation. (22,29) It is well established that under hydrocarbon feed, heterogeneous vanadium oxide catalysts are reduced to V(IV)/V(III) species. (30,31) More specifically, computational modeling of supported vanadium oxides also supported that during dehydrogenation reactions, the formation of H2 on reduced vanadium sites, V(III), is found to be more favorable than for oxidized vanadium species, V(V). (32) It is therefore not surprising that in our SiloxPOM derivatives the vanadium-oxo function does not directly participate in the formation of hydrogen, as a consequence of its low reducibility in the tris-siloxy environment provided by [SbW9O33(tBuSiOH)3]3–. Indeed, we have already established that a V(III) oxidation state is only accessible in the absence of the {V═O} function, i.e., in the presence of a less π-donating ligand in the apical position, such as the tetrahydrofuran ligand in [SbW9O33(tBuSiO)3VIII(THF)]3–. (20) Because protonation does not occur at the oxygen atom from the {V═O} moiety there is no significant alteration of the ligand field that may favor the formation of reduced V(III) species, and generation of H2 therefore occurs at the polyoxometallic framework, which behaves as a charge-storage system. This makes our SiloxPOM a very different system from the polyoxovanadate–alkoxide clusters [VIV6O7(OC2H5)12]2– recently described by Matson et al., (33) which react with organic acids to form a water molecule and an oxygen-atom vacancy, through a 2H+/2e– concerted proton–electron-transfer pathway.

Conclusion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In the current work, we report our investigations into the ability of the tris-silanol-decorated polyoxotungstate, [SbW9O33(tBuSiOH)3]3–, and its vanadium-oxo derivative, [SbW9O33(tBuSiO)3VO]3–, to collect reducing equivalents and protons at a single site. Chemical reduction of these species by two electrons was performed, and the isolated compounds reacted with protons to form hydrogen. Our body of experiments tend to show that in both cases the hydrogen is produced at the polyoxotungstic framework, behaving as a charge-storage system, and not at the vanadium center, which is often the case in related heterogeneous vanadium oxides. In the latter case, this would have led to an oxygen-atom vacancy through the release of a water molecule, a process that is often proposed for vanadium oxides. It is meaningful that these homogeneous model complexes may offer unique opportunities to gain in-depth knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of electron and proton transfer in heterogeneous catalysts.

General Procedures
All reactions were carried out in an inert atmosphere using standard Schlenk line and a glovebox. Tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether were distilled from sodium/benzophenone under nitrogen atmosphere, acetonitrile was dried using solvent purification systems, and deuterated solvents were degassed by several freeze–pump–thraw cycles and stored over activated molecular sieves. (THA)3[SbW9O33(tBuSiOH)3], (THA)3[SbW9O33(tBuSiO)3VO], and its one- and two-electron-reduced derivatives were prepared according to previously reported procedures. (20) 2,6-Lutidinium triflate [LutH][OTf] was prepared under argon atmosphere following the reported procedure and stored in the glovebox. (37)1H NMR and 51V NMR spectra were obtained at room temperature in 5 mm o.d. tubes on a Bruker Avance I 400 spectrometer or on a Bruker Avance III 600 spectrometer both equipped with a BBFO probe head. UV–visible NIR spectra were recorded on an Agilent CARY 5000 spectrophotometer using a quartz cell with a screw cap and a path length of 1 cm, under argon atmosphere. FTIR spectra were recorded on anhydrous compounds using a Bruker Alpha II spectrometer inside the glovebox. Gas-phase analysis: all samples were analyzed using an SRI 8610C gas chromatograph coupled to a FID detector. A 50 μL sample of the gas phase was drawn for analysis.
Electrochemical Studies
Cyclic voltammetry studies were carried out on deoxygenated solution of the desired compound in CH3CN with TBAPF6 as supporting electrolyte (0.1 M) in a standard three-electrode cell, composed of a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum counter electrode, and a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE).
NMR Monitoring of H2 Evolution
The reduced species (0.0291 mmol) was placed in a J Young NMR tube in the glovebox, and 2.5 mL of dried THF-d8 was then added to dissolve the solid and reduce the residual volume. [LutH](OTf)] (0.06 mmol) was then quickly added, and the NMR tube was closed. The solution was mixed, and NMR analyses were carried out immediately and 24 h later.
Preparation of the Reduced Derivatives [Sb{WVWVI8}O33(tBuSiOH)3]4– and [Sb{WV2WVI7}O33(tBuSiOH)3]5–
Dehydrated (THA)3[SbW9O33(tBuSiOH)3] (0.147 mmol) was placed in a Schlenk tube, and, under argon atmosphere, distilled THF was added (10 mL). At room temperature, 1 or 2 equiv of sodium naphthalenide, as a 0.2 M solution in THF, was then added and the resulting mixture was stirred overnight. The volatiles were removed under vacuum, and the crude product was washed with diethyl ether under argon atmosphere to remove naphthalene. The blue solid was dried under vacuum: yield for 0·(1e), 77%; yield for 0·(2e), 73%.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
