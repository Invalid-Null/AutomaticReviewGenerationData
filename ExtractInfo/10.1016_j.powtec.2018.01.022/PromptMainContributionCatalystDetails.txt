Abstract
Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites were prepared by “Dry Gel Conversion-Steam Assisted Crystallization” (DGC-SAC) procedure without the involvement of additional template. Moreover, the formation mechanism and feather of mesopores were summarized. Nanoscale Kirkendall effect was existed in the growth of zeolite crystals under high SiO2/TPA+ ratio, which was responsible for the production of intra-crystal mesopores. However, small ZSM-5 nano-crystallites, with the average diameter of <50 nm, were successfully synthesized under low SiO2/TPA+ ratio. The random assembly of these nano-crystallites gave rise to abundant inter-crystal mesopores within these nano-crystallites zeolites. Benefiting from the significantly higher concentration of TPA+ at the surface of amorphous aluminosilicate during the DGC-SAC process, the DGC-SAC procedure exhibited higher usage efficiency of template (TPA+) than that of conventional “Hydrothermal Crystallization” (HC) route, and the ZSM-5 zeolites with a low consumption of TPA+ (SiO2/TPA+ = 53.7) could be successfully synthesized by DGC-SAC method. Compared with the conventional ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by HC routes, the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by DGC-SAC procedure exhibited significantly higher catalytic lifetime and selectivity of light aromatics (benzene (B), toluene (T) and xylene (X)) in aromatization of methanol under same low addition of TPA+ (SiO2/TPA+ = 13.5). Moreover, the produced hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites (SiO2/TPA+ = 13.5) also exhibited superior catalyst stability after being further hydrothermally treated at 160 °C for 72 h. TG analysis of all used catalysts confirmed that the produced hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites had higher coke capability and lower average rate of coke formation.

1. Introduction
Zeolites, with their ordered networks and precisely uniform micropores, find a wide range of applications in shape selective catalysis, gas adsorption and separation, ion-exchange and so on [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. In particular, MFI-type zeolites have attracted continuous attention for their practical application in selective chemical conversion [6,7]. The typical three-dimensional network structure of such zeolite provides high selectivity of aromatics compounds during the methanol to hydrocarbons (MTH) reaction [[8], [9], [10], [11], [12]], which is considered as another milestone in zeolite and heterogeneous catalysis research fields since the industrialization of Fischer-Tropsch process.
Typically, the MFI-type zeolites are synthesized by a hydrothermal method using costly tetrapropylammonium (TPA+) cations as an organic structure-directing agent (OSDA) [13]. The traditional hydrothermal synthesis process often requires the use of a large amount of solvent (e.g., water and ethanol), which often results in incomplete crystallization with a yield of 80% or less zeolites [3]. This leaves a significant amount of toxic liquid waste containing alkali, silicates and aluminates, which not only increases the total cost for separation, but also results in consequent healthy issues and environmental pollution [14].
To solve this problem, great efforts have been made by researchers to enhance the zeolite product yields and reduce the waste production. In 1990, Xu et al. [15] reported synthesis of ZSM-5 zeolites from “dry gel conversion-vapor phase transport” technique. Later, Matsukata and coworkers [16] designed a similar vapor phase transport method to prepare MFI and FER zeolites. In 2012, Ren et al. [14] reported solvent-free synthesis of zeolites from solid raw materials, the crystal water existed in starting materials is indispensable for the formation of zeolite in the solvent-free route. Later, Luo and coworkers [17] synthesized ZSM-5 aggregates made of zeolite nanocrystals through a similar solvent-free method. More recently, Wang et al. [18] reported synthesis of hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites by solid-state crystallization, in which the water stored in individual starting nanogels triggered the nucleation and further crystallization. All of above efforts not only effectively increase the zeolite yields, but also decrease the discharge of toxic liquid waste.
On the other hand, however, the heavy use of expensive organic templates (TPA+) in zeolite synthesis process not only increases the preparation cost but also results in the production of harmful gases for removing the organic templates by calcination at high temperature [11,13,14,[17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]]. In particular, the synthesis of MFI-type zeolites by templating method mainly include the following reports, as listed in Table 1.

As we can see (Table 1), the ratios of SiO2/TPA+ range from 1.7 to 19.6 in previous research. Moreover, most of researches have relatively low ratio of SiO2/TPA+ ranged from 4 to 10. This means that a large amount of organic templates (TPA+) existed in the synthetic system. Based on the drawbacks mentioned above, Inagaki et al. [13] successfully synthesized the ZSM-5 zeolites in the absence of OSDA by a hydrothermal method in an alkaline medium. This method not only effectively reduces the synthesis cost, but also circumvents the calcination step, which seems to accord with the principle of “green production”. However, a large amount of waste liquid, containing alkali, silicates and aluminates, would be produced during the hydrothermal synthesis process. This not only gives a relatively low zeolite yields [3], but also brings environmental pollution.
Last but not the least, the intrinsic micropores of MFI-type zeolites are often accompanied with serious diffusion problem inside zeolite crystalline and consequent pore blocking issues, which significantly prevents their wide application in industrial catalysis and petrochemical processing. Introducing mesopores or hierarchical porosity is considered as a promising solution to facilitate molecule transport and slow down the pore blocking. Various synthesis routes, including both post-treatment [[33], [34], [35], [36]] and template assembly [30,[37], [38], [39]], have been developed to produce hierarchical zeolites. The post-treatment approach obtains hierarchical structure by selectively leaching Si or Al atoms out of the zeolite framework, which not only gives inevitable change on the acidity and crystalline framework of zeolites [40,41], but also produces a large amount of waste liquid. The template synthesis approach often needs hard/soft mesoporogen or organosilane mesoporogen to modulate both the precursor assembly and the hierarchical structure construction in the final crystal products [42]. The complex multistep synthesis and removal of costly mesoporogen unfortunately limit their practical application for large-scale production of hierarchical zeolites in industry. All of these facts stimulate great desire to look for new, low-cost, and environmental benign strategies in hierarchical zeolite synthesis.
Herein, we prepared hierarchical [Si, Al]ZSM-5 zeolites by “Dry Gel Conversion-Steam Assisted Crystallization” (DGC-SAC) method. Similar synthesis procedure has been used for the synthesis of mesoporous silicate-1 zeolites [27]. It is worth noting that the DGC-SAC route is distinguishable from traditional “Dry Gel Conversion (DGC)” route for synthesizing zeolite. In our DGC-SAC route, only a rather limited amount of water was involved during the crystallization process, as a result, trace amount of TPA+ is sufficient for the zeolite synthesis due to the high concentration of OSDA on the surface of amorphous aluminosilicate [27].
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Typically, the homogeneous silica-alumina mixed sol was obtained according to the following procedures:
(1)
The preparation of aluminum source: 0.2 g sodium hydroxide (NaOH) was dissolved in 12 ml distilled water (H2O). Afterward, 0.674 g aluminum isopropoxide (AIP) was gradually added into the above aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. After being stirred for 30 min by electromagnetically, 0–12 ml 25 wt% tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) was added dropwise and continuously stirred for another 2 h to obtain clear solution A.
(2)
The preparation of silicon source: 6 ml distilled water (H2O), 0.1 g sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 20 ml ethanol (CH3CH2OH) were mixed together adequately. Afterwards, 15 ml tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) was added dropwise and continuously stirred for another 2 h to obtain solution B.
(3)
The preparation of homogeneous silica-alumina mixed sol: The solution A was slowly added to solution B. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h to obtain the homogeneous silica-alumina mixed sol with molar compositions of 40SiO2:Al2O3:2.27Na2O:0.745–8.89TPAOH:208CH3CH2OH:606H2O. In particular, the adding amount of TPA+ aq (ml) and corresponding molar ratio of SiO2/TPA+ were shown in Table 2.
Table 2. Adding amount of TPA+ (ml) and corresponding molar ratio of SiO2/TPA+.
TPA+ aq (ml) 0 1 4 8 12
SiO2/TPA+ – 53.7 13.5 6.7 4.5
Then, as depicted in Scheme 1, the homogeneous silica-alumina mixed sol was dried at 70 °C for 16 h to remove the solvent and obtain the amorphous aluminosilicate dry gel, which was used for steam assisted crystallization in a specially designed autoclave equipped with a porous metallic network for holding the dry gel, and trace water (weight ratio of dry gel/H2O = 7:1) was placed at the bottom of autoclave. The crystallization was carried out at 170 °C for 3 days, and the steam obtained from the aqueous phase came in contact with the upper solid to trigger the crystallization process of the ZSM-5 zeolite. Finally, the resulting solid was filtered, washed with distilled water until neutral, dried at 100 °C for 10 h and calcined at 550 °C for 5 h to remove the template.

Scheme 1. The overall synthesis process of hierarchical [Si, Al]ZSM-5 zeolite by “Dry Gel Conversion-Steam Assisted Crystallization” method.
To obtain the final acidic catalyst, the above calcined solid were subjected to ion-exchange with a 1 mol/l NH4NO3 solution at 80 °C for 4 h in two consecutive cycles, followed by dried at 100 °C for 10 h and calcined at 550 °C for 5 h. The resulting solid was denoted as D-HZSM-5-X catalyst (X represents the amount of template (ml), X = 0, 1, 4, 8, 12).
The ZSM-5 zeolites prepared by hydrothermal crystallization (HC) method were also introduced as reference samples. The synthesis of silica-alumina mixed sol was similar to the above synthesis procedure, which was then transferred directly into the autoclave. In particular, the solid power synthesized by hydrothermal crystallization was denoted as H-HZSM-5-X catalyst (X represents the amount of template (ml), X = 2, 4, 8, 12).
In order to obtain the extruded catalyst, the HZSM-5 zeolite power and pseudo boehmite were mixed sufficiently with a mass ratio of 4:1, respectively. Then, proper amount of Sesbania powder was added to above mixture. After being stirred a little time, proper amount of dilute nitric acid (3%) was added dropwise and squeezed to form block. Finally, the block was extruded and shaped to strips, which were dried at 100 °C for 10 h and calcined at 550 °C for 5 h.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were characterized by a SHIMADZU-6000 powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at a scanning rate of 8°/min from 5° to 45°. The FT-IR spectra were performed by a BRUKER TENSOR-27 FT-IR spectrometer with a resolution of 4 cm−1. The framework vibration bands of zeolite were obtained with KBr pellet at the room temperature. N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured on a BELSORP-max gas adsorption analyzer. Prior to the measurement, the zeolite sample was degassed under high vacuum at 300 °C for 8 h. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of calcined catalysts were analyzed by JEM-2010 High-resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) with accelerating voltage of 100 kV. The samples were prepared by ultrasonic dispersion of the calcined catalysts in ethanol for 1 h, and the samples were then dispersed onto a lacey support films. High resolution 27Al magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) spectra were recorded using a Varian UNION INOVA 300 M spectrometer. The resonance frequency was 78.205 MHz, and the rotor was spun at 3.0 kHz. The radio frequency field was 51.0 kHz, the reversing angle was 18°, and the recycle time was 500 ms. AlCl3·6H2O was used as a reference for the 27Al chemical shift. The investigated samples were kept over saturated ammonium chloride solution for at least 12 h [17]. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image was taken on a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSM 7001-F, JEOL, Japan) with accelerating voltage of 20 kV. TG data were recorded on a Mettler TGA/SDTA851 thermal analyzer. TG analysis was carried out in 50 ml min−1 air flow and from 50 to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
2.3. Catalytic test
Methanol conversion was performed in a fixed bed reactor with an inner diameter of 16 mm and a length of 90 cm. The strips of catalyst was crushed and sieved to 20–40 mesh before use. In a typical procedure, 11 g of catalyst was loaded in the middle part of the reactor, both ends of the catalyst were filling with quartz pellets. Methanol was inputted into the reactor by a syringe pump with a liquid weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 1 h−1. The reaction was carried out at 400 °C and 0.1 MPa. The gas products were analyzed by GC-920 gas chromatograph equipped with 5A molecular sieve with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and carbon molecular sieve and modified alumina with a flame ionization detector (FID). All of results of gas products were calibrated by methane concentration. The liquid hydrocarbons collected from the condenser were analyzed by GC-950 gas chromatograph equipped with a RTX-1 capillary column (60 m × 0.25 mm) with FID.
The regeneration of deactivated catalyst was performed in the fixed bed reactor. Firstly, the deactivated catalyst, which is located in the middle part of the reactor, was purged with N2 (150 ml/min) for 2 h at 400 °C. Afterwards, the deactivated catalyst was heated to 550 °C in an air (150 ml/min) atmosphere at a heating rate of 1 °C min−1. Finally, the overall system was maintained at 550 °C for 6 h in an air (150 ml/min) atmosphere, and the regenerated catalyst was obtained.
The experiment of catalyst stability was performed as follows. Typically, 2 g HZSM-5 zeolites were dissolved in 30 ml distilled water, after being stirred fully, the mixture were transformed into the autoclave. The hydrothermal treatment was carried out at 160 °C for 72 h. Finally, the resulting white solid was filtered, dried at 100 °C for 10 h and calcined at 550 °C for 5 h.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Advantages of “DGC-SAC” method
In particular, the “DGC-SAC” method effectively combines the advantages of “OSDA-free route” and “solvent-free route”, and we mainly summarize it as follows: (1) A significant reduction of pollutants. Typically, the nutrients dissolved in the crystallization solution under hydrothermal conditions are pollutants [14]. In contrast, the “Dry Gel Conversion-Steam Assisted Crystallization” (DGC-SAC) method nearly completely avoids the production of waste. The solvent was completely removed under 70 °C before crystallization, and the steam, originated from the trace water placed at the bottom of autoclave, was used to trigger further crystallization of dry gel. (2) A large reduction of OSDA (TPA+). Usually, a large amount of TPA+ (SiO2/TPA+ = 4–10) are used to direct the formation of frameworks of MFI-type zeolites. In our work, only a small number of TPA+ is needed (SiO2/TPA+ = 53.7). It is the first time to report such a low consumption of TPA+ in the preparation of [Si, Al]ZSM-5 zeolites to the best of our knowledge. We tentatively ascribed this to the high concentration of TPA+ at the surface of amorphous aluminosilicate [27]. (3) High yields of ZSM-5 zeolites. Generally, partial nutrients, such as silicates and aluminates, still exist in the solvent when the crystallization has been finished under hydrothermal conditions, thus, giving a relatively low yield of zeolites [3]. This work could effectively turn all of amorphous aluminosilicate dry gel into ZSM-5 zeolites, and thus significantly increase the zeolite yield. (4) A large reduction of reaction pressure. The trace water in crystallization process significantly decreases the reaction pressure, as a result, the safety concerns are effectively eliminated [14,43].
3.2. Catalyst characterization
Fig. 1 represents the XRD patterns for the investigated ZSM-5 catalysts. Almost all of patterns display distinct broad diffraction peaks in 8–10° and 22–25° 2θ ranges, all consistent with typical pattern corresponding to the MFI crystal structure [44,45]. Moreover, the intensity of characteristic diffraction peaks of H-HZSM-5-X zeolites significantly decrease with the decrease of the amount of organic template (TPA+). This may largely be attributed to the low crystallization of ZSM-5 zeolites at low template concentration. However, the intensity of characteristic diffraction peaks of D-HZSM-5-X zeolites decrease slightly with the decrease of the amount of organic template (TPA+). In addition, the “Dry Gel Conversion-Steam Assisted Crystallization” (DGC-SAC) route also exhibits significantly higher usage efficiency of template (TPA+) than that of conventional “Hydrothermal Crystallization” (HC) route, and the D-HZSM-5-1 catalyst could be successfully synthesized even under higher SiO2/TPA+ ratio (SiO2/TPA+ = 53.7). We tentatively ascribed this to the higher concentration of TPA+ at the surface of amorphous aluminosilicate during the DGC-SAC process.

Fig. 1. XRD patterns of investigated ZSM-5 catalysts. (a. DGC-SAC method; b. HC method).
The framework structures of investigated ZSM-5 catalysts are characterized by means of FT-IR absorption spectroscopy. As reported in the literature, the FT-IR bands at 453, 547, 795, 1100 and 1222 cm−1 are characteristics of ZSM-5 framework [46,47]. In particular, the vibrational modes near 453, 795 and 1100 cm−1 are assigned to internal vibrations of SiO4 or AlO4 tetrahedra, which can also be observed in silica, quartz and cristobalite. However, the vibrational modes near 547 and 1222 cm−1 are assigned to the double-rings tetrahedra vibration and the asymmetric stretching of SiO4 and AlO4 tetrahedra in the zeolite framework, respectively [48]. As we can see in Fig. 2a, the absorbance band at around 1100 cm−1 in D-HZSM-5-1,4,8,12 zeolites become narrower than that of D-HZSM-5-0 zeolites, moreover, the wavenumber near 453 cm−1 of D-HZSM-5-1,4,8,12 zeolites is 20 cm−1 lower than that of D-HZSM-5-0 zeolites and the sensitive absorbance band at 542 cm−1 only exists in D-HZSM-5-1,4,8,12 zeolites. All the results indicate the increase of ordering degree of [T-O] units (TSi, Al) and crystalline nature of D-HZSM-5-1,4,8,12 zeolites [17,49]. Even though, the D-HZSM-5-1,4,8,12 catalysts show similar structure-sensitive bands in the FT-IR spectra at the same position, which indicates that all of these catalysts possess similar ZSM-5 framework structures. These results are well matched with the XRD results as is shown in Fig. 1a. On the contrary, the H-HZSM-5-2,4,8,12 catalysts, as is shown in Fig. 2b, show different absorbance bands at 1100 cm−1 in the FT-IR spectra. The absorbance band at around 1100 cm−1 become narrower with the increase of TPA+. This indicates that the ordering degree of [T-O] units and crystallinity of zeolites increases with the increase of TPA+ during the hydrothermal crystallization process [17,49]. This result could also be confirmed by XRD pattern as is shown in Fig. 1b. In addition, the higher wavenumber near 453 cm−1 and the absence of absorbance band at 542 cm−1 further prove the amorphous nature of H-HZSM-5-2 zeolites.

Fig. 3 presents the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the as-prepared samples. It is clear that the D-HZSM-5-1 zeolite prepared by DGC-SAC method shows a typical type-I isotherm with only one high uptake at low relative pressures (P/P0 < 0.02) and a long plateau at high relative pressures (0.4 < P/P0 < 0.9), indicating that the D-HZSM-5-1 zeolite is a purely microporous phase with negligible mesoporosity (Fig. 3a) [18]. However, the other D-HZSM-5-4,8,12 zeolites prepared by DGC-SAC method exhibit both high nitrogen uptake at relatively low pressure (P/P0 < 0.02) and a hysteresis loop at high relative pressure above P/P0 = 0.4 (Fig. 3a), indicating the coexistence of intrinsic micropores and mesopores [18,24,27]. Moreover, all of these samples show a type-IV isotherm with an H4 type hysteresis loop [18,50]. In particular, the D-HZSM-5-12 zeolites show hysteresis loop at high relative pressure above P/P0 = 0.85, indicating the existence of larger mesopores [27]. This may largely be ascribed to the assemblies of nanocrystals with random orientations, which could be further verified by TEM (Fig. 4g and h) and SEM images (Fig. 7g and h). On the other hand, the H-HZSM-5-4 zeolite prepared by HC method is also a purely microporous zeolite with negligible mesoporosity (Fig. 3b). In addition, the H-HZSM-5-8 zeolites show a typical type-IV isotherm with an H4 type hysteresis loop (Fig. 3b), indicating the existence of both microporosity and mesoporosity. Unlike the D-HZSM-5-12 zeolites, the H-HZSM-5-12 zeolites exhibit H3 type hysteresis loop, and a steep uptake in nitrogen adsorption at relative pressures above P/P0 = 0.85 could be observed, revealing the existence of much of larger mesopores. As a result, the textural properties of these two kinds of zeolites are obviously different.

The textural properties of the as-prepared samples are summarized in Table 3. As we can see, the D-HZSM-5-8,12 zeolites prepared by “DGC-SAC” method exhibit comparable BET surface area to the H-HZSM-5-8,12 zeolites prepared by HC method. Moreover, the D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites show larger total pore volume and mesoporous volume compared with that of H-HZSM-5-4 zeolites at the same consumption of TPA+. These increased mesopores could effectively increase the diffusion rate of bulky molecules, and thus overcome the diffusion limitations of the bulk phase [[51], [52], [53]]. On the other hand, these mesopores also provide enough space to store cokes and prevent the entrance of the micropores from blocking up [23]. It should be noted that the D-HZSM-5-1 zeolites exhibit similar textural properties compared with H-HZSM-5-4 zeolites even under low consumption of TPA+, which should be rationally attributed to the higher usage efficiency of TPA+ during “DGC-SAC” process.

Fig. 4 shows the corresponding overview TEM images of D-HZSM-5-X catalysts, revealing the mesoporous feature of these MFI crystals. As is shown in Fig. 4a and b, the D-HZSM-5-1 catalyst exhibits irregular bulk morphology, moreover, no mesopores could be observed from the bulk crystals. However, the D-HZSM-5-4 catalyst (Fig. 4c) shows Quadrilateral-like morphology with a crystal size of about 300–400 nm. Moreover, a certain amount of mesopores are existed inside the crystals, which may largely be attributed to the nanoscale kirkendall growth during the DGC-SAC process. This nanoscale kirkendall effect has been proposed by Cui et al. during the synthesis of silicalite-1 zeolite [27]. At the same time, the TEM images in Fig. 4d also presents that the D-HZSM-5-4 catalyst is high crystalline with very clear lattice fringes. Unlike D-HZSM-5-4 catalyst, the D-HZSM-5-8 (Fig. 4e) and D-HZSM-5-12 (Fig. 4g) catalysts exhibit spherical-like morphology with a particle size of about 600–800 nm and 400–600 nm, respectively. Moreover, the D-HZSM-5-8 and D-HZSM-5-12 catalysts are composed of abundant small nano-crystallites with the average diameter of 50–80 nm and <50 nm, respectively. The random assembly of these nano-crystallites gives rise to abundant inter-crystal mesopores within these nano-crystallites zeolites. At the same time, the TEM images in Fig. 4f and h also presents that each of the nanocrystals is highly crystalline with very clear lattice fringes.
The acidic properties of D-HZSM-5-X and H-HZSM-5-X catalysts are determined by NH3-TPD technique, as presented in Fig. 5. Both low temperature (l-peak at 260 °C) and high temperature (h-peak at 460 °C) features are observed for all the profiles. The l-peak is assigned to the weakly held ammonia (probably the hydrogen-bonded species), but not to the one adsorbed on acid sites [[54], [55], [56]]. However, the h-peak above 400 °C is due to the desorption of NH3 from strong acid sites [57,58]. In particular, the area of desorption peak measures the amount of acid sites [59,60]. As we can see in Fig. 5a, the quantity of strong acid sites of D-HZSM-5-X catalysts follows the sequence of D-HZSM-5-12 > D-HZSM-5-8 > D-HZSM-5-4 > D-HZSM-5-1. This result indicates that the higher concentration of TPA+ is beneficial to the formation of strong acid sites in ZSM-5 zeolites. It should be noted that similar situations happen to the H-HZSM-5-X catalysts, as is shown in Fig. 5b, the quantity of strong acid sites of H-HZSM-5-X catalysts follows the sequence of H-HZSM-5-12 > H-HZSM-5-8 > H-HZSM-5-4.

Fig. 5. NH3-TPD profiles of investigated ZSM-5 catalysts. (a. DGC-SAC method; b. HC method).
The solid-state 27Al MAS NMR spectra of D-HZSM-5-1,4 and H-HZSM-5-4,12 catalysts are presented in Fig. 6. All of investigated samples show a sharp peak centered at 55 ppm, which corresponds to the tetrahedral aluminum species in the zeolite framework [61,62]. Moreover, a broad weak peak around 0 ppm, which corresponds to the octahedral aluminum species [61,62], is appeared in D-HZSM-5-1 and H-HZSM-5-4 catalyst. This means that most of [Al-O] species connect with [Si-O] fragments to form the [Si-O-Al] tetrahedrons, and only a few of [Al-O] species exist in the form of non-framework octahedral aluminum even under lower consumption of TPA+ (SiO2/TPA+ = 53.7) by taking DGC-SAC method. Moreover, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of tetrahedral aluminum in D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites (5.20 ppm) is narrower than that of D-HZSM-5-1 zeolites (6.85 ppm), which further indicates that the tetrahedral aluminum in D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites is located in the crystalline framework of zeolites [17]. Similarly, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of tetrahedral aluminum is 8.21 ppm and 5.54 ppm for H-HZSM-5-4 and H-HZSM-5-12 zeolites, respectively. These results strongly prove that the DGC-SAC process could effectively graft [Al-O] species into the crystalline framework of zeolites even under lower consumption of TPA+ (SiO2/TPA+ = 53.7).

3.3. Discussion on synthesis mechanism
The morphologies of all the investigated ZSM-5 samples are characterized by SEM. As is shown in Fig. 7a and b, the D-HZSM-5-1 zeolites exhibit irregular bulk with a crystal size of about 10 μm. Moreover, the D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites, as is shown in Fig. 7c and d, are single crystals with significantly smaller crystal size of about 300–400 nm. The D-HZSM-5-8 catalyst shows larger particle size (of about 600–800 nm) compared with D-HZSM-5-4 catalyst, moreover, the D-HZSM-5-8 particles are composed of abundant small nano-crystallites with an average diameter of 50–80 nm, and thus they show a very rough external surface (Fig. 7e and f). The D-HZSM-5-12 catalyst shows similar morphology compared with D-HZSM-5-8 catalyst, moreover, the D-HZSM-5-12 particles (of about 400–600 nm) are composed of abundant small nano-crystallites with an average diameter of <50 nm (Fig. 7g and h). All of above results are well matched with the TEM images as is shown in Fig. 4. Taking all of above into consideration, it would be easy to conclude that the crystal size decreases along with increasing the amount of TPA+. This could be rationally ascribed to the increased number of nucleation at high concentration of TPA+, as a result, the inorganic aluminosilicate used for crystal growth decrease and the crystal size decreases accordingly. These small nano-crystallites zeolites randomly accumulate, and thus generate large amount of intercrystal mesopores. In addition, the D-HZSM-5-4 catalyst also exhibits non-ignorable amount of mesopores as is shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4 and Table 3. This may largely be attributed to the nanoscale kirkendall growth, as proposed by Cui et al. during the synthesis of silicalite-1 zeolite [27]. Similarly, the SEM images of H-HZSM-5-4, H-HZSM-5-8 and H-HZSM-5-12 catalysts are shown in Fig. 8. As we can see, the H-HZSM-5-4 catalyst exhibits typical regular hexagon morphology (Fig. 8a) with crystal size of 25 μm in length, 9 μm in width and 5 μm in height (25 × 9 × 5 μm, Fig. 8b). However, the H-HZSM-5-8 catalyst shows large ellipsoid morphology (Fig. 8c) with particle size of 4 μm in long axis and 3 μm in short axis (Fig. 8d). Moreover, the H-HZSM-5-8 particles are composed of abundant small nano-crystallites with an average diameter of 100–200 nm. In particular, the H-HZSM-5-12 catalyst shows irregular ellipsoid morphology with particle size of 300–500 nm (Fig. 8e), moreover, which are also composed of abundant small nano-crystallites with average diameter of <80 nm (Fig. 8f). This structure is very similar to that of D-HZSM-5-8 and D-HZSM-5-12 catalyst. Even though, the D-HZSM-5-1 catalyst exhibits smaller crystal size compared with H-HZSM-5-4 catalyst under less addition of TPA+, we tentatively ascribe this to its higher concentration of TPA+ on the surface of D-HZSM-5-1 catalyst in the DGC-SAC process.

3.4. Evaluation of catalytic performance in aromatization of methanol
As is known to us, due to its precisely uniform micropores and peculiar three-dimensional network structure, ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts are widely used for converting methanol into hydrocarbons of petroleum-range boiling products. In particular, such zeolite provides high selectivity of aromatics compounds during the methanol to hydrocarbons (MTH) reaction. In our study, all of investigated ZSM-5 catalysts are used for the evaluation of catalytic performance in aromatization of methanol, and the corresponding experimental results are listed in Fig. 9, Fig. 10.

Time course of methanol conversion over all of investigated ZSM-5 catalysts are shown in Fig. 9. As we can see, the D-HZSM-5-1 zeolites show comparable catalyst stability compared with H-HZSM-5-4 zeolites at the low consumption of TPA+. In particular, the conversion of methanol over D-HZSM-5-1 catalyst maintains at a high level in the first 24 h and, rapidly decreases to 30.77% after 66 h on-stream. Similarly, the H-HZSM-5-4 catalyst shows high methanol conversion in the first 30 h, and thereafter, it quickly declines to 26.77% after 72 h on-stream. However, the D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites show much better catalyst stability compared with the H-HZSM-5-4 zeolites at the same consumption of TPA+. The D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites shows a high methanol conversion in the first 54 h, and it gradually declines to 30.66% after 114 h on-stream. The high methanol conversion over D-HZSM-5-8 zeolites is similar to that of H-HZSM-5-8 zeolites in the first 84 h. Thereafter, the D-HZSM-5-8 zeolites show slightly higher methanol conversion compared with the H-HZSM-5-8 zeolites and, rapidly decrease to about 27.65% after 120 h and 32.76% after 114 h on-stream, respectively. The D-HZSM-5-12 zeolites and the H-HZSM-5-12 zeolites show similar highest methanol conversion during the whole reaction process. In particular, the methanol conversions of the D-HZSM-5-12 zeolites and the H-HZSM-5-12 zeolites are higher than 90% in the first 84 h, and thereafter, they rapidly decrease to about 32.42% and 35.25% after 126 h on-stream, respectively. It should be noted that the R-D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites exhibits comparable high methanol conversion compared with D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites, we tentatively ascribe this to its excellent hydrothermal stability.
Time course of selectivity to BTX over all of investigated ZSM-5 catalysts are shown in Fig. 10. It is clear that the selectivities of BTX for all of catalysts decrease with time on stream. This may largely be ascribed to the fact that the coke gradually covers the acid sites of catalysts, however, the MTA is a typical acid catalytic reaction and, the strong acid sites in a large amount are crucial for the high yield of aromatics [58]. As a result, the selectivity of BTX gradually decrease with the coverage of strong acid sites. In particular, the highest selectivity of BTX over D-HZSM-5-1 and H-HZSM-5-4 zeolites are 30.46% and 30.75%, respectively. Moreover, they quickly decline to 5.23% after 66 h on-stream and 3.68% after 72 h on-stream, respectively. However, the highest BTX selectivity of about 32.75% over D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites is observed in the initial stage of reaction. Moreover, the selectivity of BTX over D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites is slightly higher than that of D-HZSM-5-1 and H-HZSM-5-4 zeolites in initial 36 h of reaction, thereafter, it gradually decreases to 4.84% after 114 h on-stream, and exhibits much higher selectivity of BTX compared with D-HZSM-5-1 and H-HZSM-5-4 zeolites. The D-HZSM-5-8 and H-HZSM-5-8 zeolites exhibit similar BTX selectivity, which is slightly higher than that of D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites. The D-HZSM-5-12 and H-HZSM-5-12 zeolites exhibit higher BTX selectivity compared with other investigated samples during the whole reaction process. Specifically, the highest selectivity of BTX over D-HZSM-5-12 and H-HZSM-5-12 zeolites are 34.05% and 33.77%, respectively. Thereafter, they quickly decline to 3.25% and 2.47% after 126 h on-stream, respectively. It should be noted that the R-D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites also exhibit comparable high selectivity of BTX compared with D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites. Even so, the selectivity of BTX over R-D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites slightly decrease after D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites regeneration.
The selectivities of hydrocarbons versus time on stream over D-HZSM-5-4 catalyst is shown in Fig. 11. It is clear that the selectivity of BTX decreases with time on stream. However, the selectivities of C2 and C3 hydrocarbons increase slightly and, the selectivities of C4, C5 and C6-C8 aliphatic hydrocarbons increase significantly. That is to say, the aromatization performances of low-carbon hydrocarbons are limited with the process of reaction. We tentatively ascribe this to the decrease of strong acid sites caused by the deposition of carbon species, which inhibits the oligomerization and hydrogen transfer reactions occurred in Bronsted acid sites [63] as well as the alkylation and dehydrogenation reactions occurred in Lewis acid sites [64]. In particular, as is shown in Scheme 2, the inhibition of alkylation and oligomerization reactions results in higher selectivities of C3-C5 hydrocarbons, moreover, the inhibition of hydrogen transfer and dehydrogenation reactions results in higher selectivities of C6-C8 aliphatic hydrocarbons, all of above factors result in the decrease of BTX selectivity with the process of reaction.

3.5. Evaluation of catalyst stability
In order to examine the hydrothermal stability of D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites. The D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites are further hydrothermally treated at 160 °C for 72 h [18], and the resultant sample is denoted as HT-D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites. Fig. 12 shows the FT-IR (Fig. 12a), XRD (Fig. 12b) and 27Al NMR (Fig. 12c) patterns of D-HZSM-5-4 and HT-D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites. As we can see, all of patterns (Fig. 12a, b and c) are well preserved after hydrothermal treatment. These results strongly indicate that the D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites synthesized by “DGC-SAC” method have excellent hydrothermal stability.

3.6. Discussion on relationships between catalyst properties and its catalytic performance in aromatization of methanol
The product distributions of methanol aromatization over all of HZSM-5 zeolites are shown in Table 4. It is clear that the D-HZSM-5-1 and H-HZSM-5-4 catalysts show similar low selectivity of BTX hydrocarbons. We tentatively ascribe this to their similar textural properties and lower strong acid sites, as is shown in Table 3 and Fig. 5. However, the D-HZSM-5-4 catalysts show higher selectivity of BTX hydrocarbons compared with D-HZSM-5-1 and H-HZSM-5-4 catalyst. This may largely be attributed to the synergistic effect between its higher micropore volume and more strong acid sites, which greatly improves not only the shape selectivity of products, but also the aromatization performance of intermediate products. Compared with D-HZSM-5-4 catalysts, the D-HZSM-5-8 catalysts exhibit slightly higher BTX selectivity even under lower micropore volume, which could be rationally ascribed to its more strong acid sites as is shown in Fig. 5. The H-HZSM-5-8 catalysts also shows higher BTX selectivity compared with D-HZSM-5-4 catalysts, which may closely be related to its higher micropore volume and more strong acid sites. The D-HZSM-5-12 and H-HZSM-5-12 catalysts show significantly higher BTX selectivity compared with D-HZSM-5-4 catalysts. We tentatively ascribe this to their significantly higher micropore volume and more strong acid sites, as is shown in Table 3 and Fig. 5. It should be noted that the R-D-HZSM-5-4 catalysts exhibit comparable high BTX selectivity compared with D-HZSM-5-4 catalysts, which indicates that the D-HZSM-5-4 catalysts have a better regeneration performance.

On the other hand, the selectivity of heavy hydrocarbons (C9+ hydrocarbons) follows the sequence of H-HZSM-5-12 > D-HZSM-5-12 > D-HZSM-5-8 > D-HZSM-5-4 > H-HZSM-5-8 > D-HZSM-5-1 ≈ H-HZSM-5-4 (Table 4). As reported in the literature, mesitylene molecules are difficult to enter ZSM-5 channel due to its limited pore size [65]. That is to say, most of C9+ hydrocarbons may probably be produced on the external surface of HZSM-5 zeolites. This analysis is well in accordance with the results of N2 adsorption–desorption. As is shown in Table 3, the mesopore surface area of investigated ZSM-5 samples follows the sequence of H-HZSM-5-12 > D-HZSM-5-12 > D-HZSM-5-8 > D-HZSM-5-4 > H-HZSM-5-8 > D-HZSM-5-1 ≈ H-HZSM-5-4, which is well in line with the sequence of heavy hydrocarbons selectivity.
The last but not the least, as we can see in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10, the investigated ZSM-5 catalysts exhibit obviously different catalytic lifetime, which is closely related to the carbon deposition species on the catalyst surface. In particular, as is shown in Scheme 2, the catalytic conversion of methanol to hydrocarbons follows two stages [[66], [67], [68], [69], [70]]: first the catalytic conversion of methanol to “hydrocarbon pool species”, followed by a dual olefin and aromatic catalytic cycle. During the whole reaction processing, Oxygenic coke with high sticking affinity and graphite-like coke with high molecular weight are two principal carbon deposition species [71,72]. Moreover, the oxygenic coke could be further transformed into aromatic species by hydrogen transfer pathway, which remains strongly chemisorbed at acid sites causing site blocking [72]. As reported in the literature, carbon deposition species associated with oxygenic coke deactivate the catalyst in a relatively much higher rate compared to the graphite-like coke [71,72]. It is clear that formaldehyde is indispensible for the production of oxygenic coke, and methane (CH4) is proposed to form together with formaldehyde via a mechanism involving methanol as a hydride donor [73]. That is to say, the selectivity of CH4 could be used to reflect the amount of oxygenic coke, and thus reflect the catalyst lifetime. As is shown in Table 4, the CH4 selectivity of investigated ZSM-5 catalysts follows the sequence of D-HZSM-5-1 > H-HZSM-5-4 > H-HZSM-5-8 ≈ D-HZSM-5-4 > D-HZSM-5-8 > H-HZSM-5-12 ≈ D-HZSM-5-12. As a result, the amount of carbon deposition species associated with oxygenic coke would follow the same sequence. That is to say, the catalyst lifetime of investigated ZSM-5 catalysts should follow the sequence of D-HZSM-5-1 < H-HZSM-5-4 < H-HZSM-5-8 ≈ D-HZSM-5-4 < D-HZSM-5-8 < H-HZSM-5-12 ≈ D-HZSM-5-12. This analysis is well matched with the catalytic performance results presented in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10.
Carbon amount are studied by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis, and the TG curves of used D-HZSM-5-1, H-HZSM-5-4 and D-HZSM-5-4 catalysts are shown in Fig. 13. It is clear that the TG profiles of all investigated catalysts are very similar, however, the weight losses of them are markedly different. The D-HZSM-5-4 catalyst shows the weight loss of about 21.25%, which is significantly larger than that of H-HZSM-5-4 (16.50%) and D-HZSM-5-1 (15.37%) catalysts. That is to say, the D-HZSM-5-4 catalysts have relatively higher coke capacity compared to H-HZSM-5-4 and D-HZSM-5-1 catalysts. On the other hand, the weight loss per hour is identified as the average rate of coke formation on the catalysts [74]. Here, the catalyst deactivation is set as that methanol conversion falling to around 50% [41,75]. As a result, the catalytic lifetime of D-HZSM-5-1, H-HZSM-5-4 and D-HZSM-5-4 catalysts are around 62 h, 65 h and 109 h, respectively, as is shown in Fig. 9. Therefore, the average rate of coke formation over D-HZSM-5-4 catalyst is 0.195% per hour, which is much lower than that of 0.254% and 0.248% per hour on the H-HZSM-5-4 and D-HZSM-5-1 catalysts, respectively. The increased coke capacity and decreased average rate of coke formation over D-HZSM-5-4 catalysts may largely be attributed to its higher mesopore volume, which not only provides enough space to store cokes, but also further prevent entrance of micropores from blocking up. In particular, Ni et al. [23] also found that the hierarchical H[Zn,Al]ZSM-5 catalyst had much lower coke formation rate compared with conventional microporous HZSM-5. That is to say, the higher mesopore volume, in a manner, retard the deactivation of catalysts.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we successfully synthesized hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolites by DGC-SAC procedure without the involvement of additional template. The formation mechanism and feather of mesopores are closely related to the ratio of SiO2/TPA+. Hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite, with intra-crystal mesopores, could be successfully synthesized through the Kirkendall effect on the growth of zeolite under high SiO2/TPA+ ratio. However, small ZSM-5 nano-crystallites could be obtained under low SiO2/TPA+ ratio, moreover, the random assembly of these nano-crystallites gave rise to abundant inter-crystal mesopores within these nano-crystallites zeolites. Benefiting from the higher usage efficiency of template (TPA+), the D-HZSM-5-1 zeolites with a low consumption of TPA+ (SiO2/TPA+ = 53.7) could be successfully synthesized by DGC-SAC method, which exhibited comparable catalytic performance in aromatization of methanol compared with H-HZSM-5-4 zeolites (SiO2/TPA+ = 13.5) prepared by HC method. Compared with H-HZSM-5-4 zeolites, moreover, the D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites prepared by DGC-SAC method showed significantly longer catalytic lifetime and higher selectivity of light aromatics in aromatization of methanol under the same SiO2/TPA+ ratio (SiO2/TPA+ = 13.5). In addition, the D-HZSM-5-4 zeolites also had higher coke capability and lower average rate of coke formation due to its higher mesopore volume.
