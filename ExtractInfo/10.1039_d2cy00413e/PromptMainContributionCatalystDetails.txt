Synergetic effect between Pd2+ and Ir4+ species promoting direct ethane dehydrogenation into ethylene over bimetallic PdIr/AC catalysts†
This work reported an efficient PdIr/activated carbon (PdIr/AC) catalyst and its application during direct ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) into ethane. The XRD and HADDF-STEM results revealed Pd/Ir nano-particles and atomically dispersed Pd2+ and Ir4+ species simultaneously. The activity tests demonstrated that Ir species showed higher C2H4 selectivity than Pd species and the co-presence of Pd/Ir could further improve the catalytic stability and inhibit carbon deposition over the bimetallic Pd/Ir catalyst. Nevertheless, raising the reaction temperature from 500 °C to 600 °C boosted coking including carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon particles. XPS results of Pd7Ir2/AC-B after Ar or H2 pretreatment proved that the active sites are Pd2+/Ir4+ species. The simulation results exposed the reaction pathway over Ir4+/Pd2+ species, and ethane dehydrogenation was the rate-determining step over the PdIr/AC sample; meanwhile, the synergetic effect between Pd2+ and Ir4+ increased their TOF (C2H4). Finally, a deactivation mechanism was also proposed to examine the coking over various metal species.
1. Introduction
Ethylene, as one of the important building blocks in the modern chemical industry, could be utilized to synthesize plastics, rubber, fibers, ethanol and other valuable chemicals. In addition to steam cracking and naphtha cracking, ethylene could be produced from light alkane dehydrogenation, which produces less by-products than the cracking reaction. The ethylene production route from ethane dehydrogenation includes direct dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation by O2, CO2, etc. The former method is an endothermic reaction and usually performed at high temperature (above 550 °C), and presents a low catalytic efficiency considering the energy consumption. Nevertheless, the latter method uses O2 or CO2 to oxidize C2H6 into C2H4, and this process easily produces CO2 or CO as a by-product due to over-oxidation and declined ethylene selectivity. In this work, we chose direct ethane dehydrogenation (EDH) as reaction (1) to produce ethylene and attempted to improve the catalytic efficiency at lower temperature through utilization of a new activated carbon (AC) based catalyst.
Based on previous reports, platinum (Pt) and chromium (Cr) were proved to be active species for EDH and Al2O3, zeolites, SiO2, graphene, nanodiamonds, etc. were employed as catalyst supports.1–17 Miller et al. prepared a Pt–In intermetallic alloy and found that the Pt3In phase exhibited a superior ethane turnover rate (TOR) of 5.3 s−1 and 99% ethylene selectivity at 600 °C, and this catalyst exhibited little deactivation in 5 h. Compared with a monometallic Pt catalyst, the electronic changes and geometric changes were responsible for the higher TOR and ethylene selectivity of the PtIn alloy.1 Wang et al. deposited Pt and Sn over hydrotalcite materials (MgGaAlO) and found that the presence of Ga enhanced the interaction of the Sn-support and Pt–Sn, maintaining the oxidized Sn species and improving the EDH activity. The PtSn/MgGaAlO sample showed a 17% ethane conversion after 14 h and the ethylene selectivity was above 99%.6 Ma et al. fabricated fully exposed Pt3 clusters (0.5 wt% Pt) on defective graphene (ND@G) by the assistance of atomically dispersed Sn promoters which showed a 35.4% conversion and 99.0% alkene selectivity for n-butane direct DDH reaction at 450 °C.15 Compared to noble metals as active sites, the EDH activities of Cr, Ga, Co, Mo and Fe catalysts were also evaluated at higher temperature, which exhibited higher ethane conversion but lower ethylene selectivity.2,10,18–22 Sayari et al. utilized quasi in situ X-ray spectroscopy to examine the EDH reaction mechanism over a Cr/MCM-41 sample, and the results showed that the ethane conversion strongly depended on the Cr loading and preparation method. The Cr(iii) species were the main active sties for EDH, while Cr(vi) and Cr(ii) played a lesser role in C2H6 conversion.5 Table S1† lists the most recent EDH research progress and it was concluded that noble metal catalysts presented higher reaction rates and lower reaction temperature compared to transition metal catalysts. In addition to the C2H6 conversion and C2H4 selectivity, coking was another issue during the EDH process and greatly affected catalyst stability and efficiency.2,23,24 It is known that an acidic support boosts alkane adsorption and coking during the dehydrogenation process; therefore, a neutral or basic support might weaken the coking phenomenon during the EDH process. Xiao et al. pointed out that an Fe/silicalite-1 catalyst showed a superior coke resistance in 200 h without deactivation, and presented a 26.3% C2H6 conversion and 97.5% C2H4 selectivity at 600 °C. The research found that the isolated ferric sites could avoid ferric species reduction and deactivation; meanwhile, the Fe-zeolite structure benefited dehydrogenation and hydrogen desorption, improving ethane conversion and inhibiting coke formation.19 Similarly, Jorge Gascon et al. recently reported their EDH study over Cr/MFI catalysts, and the 0.8Cr/MFI sample presented an ∼20% C2H6 conversion and >99% C2H4 selectivity after a 110 h running time. The utilization of non-acidic siliceous supports indeed improved the catalyst stability and only 0.3 wt% coke was detected after 110 h on stream at 650 °C.25 Generally speaking, EDH possesses the advantage of ethylene separation and industrialization potential, and it is meaningful to explore new catalyst systems and the corresponding reaction conditions to improve C2H4 yield and catalyst stability.11

Pd catalysts exhibited a good propane dehydrogenation reactivity but only a few reports studied their ethane dehydrogenation behavior before.26–35 In 1994, R. Hughes reported the C2H6 conversion through a membrane reactor to be 7–8 times higher than that of a conventional fixed-bed reactor under isothermal conditions, and the 0.5 wt% Pd/Al2O3 catalyst with a Pd–Ag membrane reactor (23 wt% Ag/Pd on porous Vycor glass) showed complete C2H6 conversion and an almost 100% C2H4 selectivity under 660 K conditions, since the membrane reactor could separate the generated H2 and shift the reaction equilibrium towards increased conversion.31 Ir was reported to activate alkanes and improve propane dehydrogenation (PDH) activity, and also inhibited hydrogenolysis reaction simultaneously.36,37 Besides, carbon materials have been rarely used as dehydrogenation supports though they present less acidic/alkaline sites. Graphite, reduced graphene oxide, carbon nanofibers and mesoporous carbon were reported to conduct EDH at 450 °C with a microwave heating mode, and the mesoporous carbon presented the highest C2H6 conversion of ∼50% with H2, C2H4 and CH4 as products in a 3 h running time.38 In contrast, AC presented a higher SSA and rich porous structure, and has not been employed as an EDH support so far, which might benefit metal dispersion and improve catalytic stability under reduction conditions. Considering the price of noble metal catalysts, their application was always restricted for efficient reclamation. Nevertheless, noble metal/AC catalysts could be easily recycled after the combustion of carbon supports. Therefore, considering the advantages and novelty of AC as a support and Pd/Ir as active species, it is meaningful to explore the Pd–Ir performance over an AC support during the EDH process.
2. Experimental
2.1 Sample preparation
All noble metal catalysts were prepared through wet impregnation methods. Prior to the metal loading process, the AC support (from Aladdin) was deoxygenated with a NaBH4 solution and denoted as AC-B. Firstly, 0.4 g AC support was dispersed in 20 mL water and sonicated for 30 min, and then a NaBH4 solution (0.063 g NaBH4/10 mL H2O) at a certain percentage was added into the AC solution and stirred for another 1 h. After the reduction, the AC support was filtered and washed with distilled water and dried in a vacuum oven at 90 °C. The optimal NaBH4 : AC ratio was examined and it was found that the O content remained stable since the mole ratio of NaBH4 : pristine O in the AC support was 2. And improving the NaBH4 ratio continuously could not decrease the O content further.
For the metal loading procedure, herein we took Pd/AC-B as an example to explain the detailed process. Firstly, 0.2 g AC-B support was dispersed in 20 mL water and sonicated for 30 min at RT, and then 1.40 mL Na2PdCl4 (0.1 M, from Aladdin) was added into the AC solution with rapid stirring. After 4 h agitation, the solution was filtered with distilled water and then the filter cake was dried using a freeze dryer. For the bimetallic Pd7Ir2/AC sample, 1.40 mL Pd (0.1 M, Na2PdCl4 from Aladdin) and 0.24 mL Ir (0.1 M, H2IrCl6 from Aladdin) solutions were added into the solution at the same time, and their theoretical loading was denoted as the suffix in the sample name for bimetallic samples. Finally, the as-prepared sample was calcined under N2 at 500 °C for 1 h.
2.2 Material characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on an Empyrean-100 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 40 mA and 40 kV in the range of 20–90°. BET surface areas were examined through nitrogen adsorption at 77 K on a Quantachrome Autosorb iQ2 gas adsorption analyzer. Prior to the test, all samples were degassed at 200 °C for 3 h. The noble metal loading was determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP, Varian Vista Axial Instrument), while the O contents in the AC support were examined through an organic elemental analyzer (Elementar vario EL cube, Germany). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, TECNAI G2 F20 200 keV, USA) was used to investigate the morphology and noble metal dispersion over the AC based samples. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) with an energy resolution of 0.3–2 eV, using a Gatan imaging filter (GIF 200) attached to a TECNAI G2 F20 operated at 200 keV, were used to analyze the Pd, Ir and O dispersion on the catalysts. Atomic resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were obtained on an FEI Titan STEM/TEM equipped with a probe corrector. Before imaging, the powder was dissolved in anhydrous ethanol and lightly dusted onto 230 mesh Cu grids coated with ultrathin carbon.
H2-TPR and CO pulse were conducted on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 with a TCD as the detector. Prior to the H2-TPR measurement, 0.1 g sample was pretreated with Ar at 200 °C for 30 min, and then the temperature was elevated from 25 °C to 500 °C under 5% H2/Ar with a rate of 10 °C min−1. Before the CO pulse test, 0.1 g sample was pretreated with 5% H2/Ar at 500 °C for 20 min, and the CO pulse was conducted at 30 °C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were collected on a Thermo Escalab 250Xi by using an Al Kα radiation source operating at 1486.6 eV. The binding energy and the Auger kinetic energy scales were referenced to the C 1s line at 284.6 eV from adventitious carbon.
2.3 EDH activity tests
EDH activity tests were performed on a fixed bed reactor with a quartz lining. Typically, 50 mg powder sample mixed with quartz sand was used and the temperature was controlled using a type K thermocouple inserted directly into the center of the catalyst bed. The feed gas was composed of C2H6/H2/Ar = 10.4 vol%/0.4 vol%/5 vol%, with Ar as the internal standard for online gas chromatography (GC) analysis and N2 as balance. The reaction was performed at atmospheric pressure and 18 000 mL h−1 gcat−1. Prior to the activity test, the catalysts were pretreated under Ar to the reaction temperature with a rate of 10 °C min−1, and then the reactants were introduced into the reactor subsequently. More detailed temperature procedures for each activity test will be explained in the figure caption. The products were analyzed by online GC (ThermoFisher Trace1300), which was equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). Porapak Q and 5 Å molecular sieves packed columns were connected to the TCD while TG WAXMS and HP AL/S capillary columns were connected to the FID. Oxygenates and hydrocarbons could be analyzed by the FID, while C2H4, Ar, CO, CH4, and C2H6 were analyzed by the TCD. C2H6 was taken as a reference bridge between the FID and TCD. The first sample test was recorded after a 10 min running time. The C2H6 conversion and C2H4 selectivity were calculated on a carbon atom basis, i.e.

2.4 Computational methods
First-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) were performed on the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).39,40 The projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials were adopted to treat the electron–ion interaction.41,42 And we applied the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) realization to characterize the exchange and correlation potential.43 The DFT-D3 method of Grimme was employed to correct the intermolecular van der Waals (vdW) interaction.44 An energy cutoff of 500 eV was set to ensure precision. The convergence criteria for energy and force were 10−5 eV and 0.02 eV Å−1 in structure optimization, respectively. For frequency calculation, a stricter convergence criterion of 10−6 eV was used for electronic self-consistent computation. Transition states (TS) were searched by the improved dimer method.45,46
Based on the experimental characterization results, we designed a Pd–Ir dual-atomic model as shown in Fig. S1.† Pd2+ was anchored on graphene oxide (GO) by two Pd–C and two Pd–O coordination bonds, while Ir4+ had an extra O2−. A 5 × 5 supercell of graphite was used to avoid the interaction between adsorbates. According to reported construction methods of GO, four carbonyl groups and four carboxyl groups were added to the graphene, respectively.47,48 A vacuum space of 15 Å was built along the z-axis to avoid artificial interactions between the periodic sheet and adsorbates. Considering the time cost and precision, the Brillouin zone was sampled using a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack grid for geometry optimization.49
3. Results and discussion
3.1 The sample composition and their bulk characterization results
Table 1 lists the noble metal (Pd and Ir) contents over all samples from the ICP results. Compared to the monometallic Pd/AC-B and Ir/AC-B, bimetallic Pd7Ir2/AC-B and Pd7Ir2/AC were loaded with two metals simultaneously, and Pd7Ir2/AC was prepared over AC without deoxygenation. It was worthy to point out that Pd7Ir2/AC and Pd7Ir2/AC-B were loaded with the same weight percentage of Pd and Ir precursor, while the deoxygenation treatment of the AC support decreased the Pd and Ir contents on Pd7Ir2/AC-B, illustrating the boosting impact of oxygen species on metal loading. In addition, CO pulse was used to examine metal dispersion, and the results in Table 1 showed that monometallic Pd species in Pd/AC-B presented a much lower dispersion than Ir species in Ir/AC-B. For the bimetallic PdIr/AC samples, the metal dispersion in Table 1 was normalized by the Pd + Ir summation. It was obvious that the bimetallic samples presented higher metal dispersion compared with the Pd/AC-B sample.
Table 1 The noble metal contents from the ICP results
Samplea Pd loading/wt% Ir loading/wt% Pd + Irb dispersion%
Pd/AC-B 7.20% — 0.59%
Ir/AC-B — 2.28% 8.95%
Pd7Ir2/AC 6.93% 1.42% —
Pd7Ir2/AC-B 5.26% 0.93% 1.85%
a For the bimetallic samples, the number suffixes after Pd and Ir represent their theoretical loading. b The noble metal dispersion from the CO pulse results was calculated from the actual Pd and Ir contents from the ICP results.
The TEM image in Fig. 1a showed the pristine morphology of the AC support after deoxygenation. For Pd/AC-B, Pd particles were detected in Fig. 1b and the statistical results exhibited a 5–22 nm particle size. Nevertheless, Ir/AC-B showed much smaller Ir particles in Fig. 1c and their size ranged from 2–6 nm. For bimetallic Pd7Ir2/AC-B in Fig. 1d, the statistical results (3–13 nm) revealed that this bimetallic sample presented a much smaller nanoparticle size than monometallic Pd/AC-B, which illustrated that the hybrid metal impregnation procedure decreased the particle size. For Pd7Ir2/AC, the TEM images in Fig. S2† also presented that the deoxygenation treatment slightly increased the metal particle size compared with that for Pd7Ir2/AC-B. In order to further study the Pd and Ir distribution over the bimetallic samples, HADDF-STEM and EDS mapping were performed over Pd7Ir2/AC-B as shown in Fig. 2 and S3.† Firstly, the STEM elemental scans in Fig. 2a unveiled the existence of atomically dispersed Pd and Ir species in addition to the nanoparticles in Fig. 1b. Meanwhile, more EDS mapping images of Pd7Ir2/AC-B in Fig. S3† proved the intermetallic structure of Pd–Ir species through their overlapped area, and the average mole ratio of Pd/Ir on the particles was 83. In addition, the atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM image in Fig. 2b revealed lots of atomically dispersed metal sites on Pd7Ir2/AC-B. Furthermore, the EDS spectra through the line scan method in Fig. S4† certainly proved that the adjacent single atoms were dual Pd–Ir pairs and the defined mutual distance is referred to the model in Fig. S1.† In addition, plenty of atomically dispersed Pd and Ir species were also detected on Pd/AC-B in Fig. 2c and Ir/AC-B in Fig. 2d.

Table 2 lists the SSA results and Fig. 3 reveals the pore distribution of all mentioned samples. It was seen that the pristine AC support possessed a 2036.0 m2 g−1 SSA and the pore size was mainly under 2 nm, exhibiting a rich microporous structure. After the deoxygenation treatment, AC-B showed a 3198.6 m2 g−1 surface area and much higher N2 adsorption at lower pressure as shown in Fig. 3. For the monometallic samples, the Pd and Ir loading both decreased their SSA due to the pore blocking by metal particles, and Pd/AC-B especially presented a 48% decline of SSA compared with AC-B. Pd7Ir2/AC-B showed a comparable SSA result with Pd/AC-B. It was worthy to mention that all samples presented similar N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms and pore size distributions as shown in Fig. 3, which illustrated that the preparation method did not affect the pore size of the AC-B support.

Fig. 4 shows the XRD profiles of all samples and it was seen that metallic Pd typical peaks were detected over Pd/AC-B, Pd7Ir2/AC-B and Pd7Ir2/AC, which was consistent with the detected big-sized metal particles from the TEM images. In addition, the average particle size was calculated by the Scherrer equation using the 40° peak, and Pd7Ir2/AC-B, Pd7Ir2/AC and Pd/AC-B presented an 8.8 nm, 6.5 nm and 11.5 nm particle size, respectively, illustrating that the deoxygenation treatment increased the metal particle size and the co-existence of Pd/Ir decreased the particle size in bimetallic samples. For Ir/AC-B, after the spectrum was magnified 5 times, there were metallic Ir typical peaks detected and the calculated particle size was 3.1 nm.

3.2 Impact of deoxygenation treatment on EDH performance
For the commercial AC support, the elemental analysis presented a 13.5 wt% O content. Considering the oxidation of O species upon dehydrogenation reaction as shown by reactions (5) and (6), the pristine AC support was pretreated with NaBH4 to consume as much O species as possible. It was proved that the optimal NaBH4/AC ratio was 2, which could reduce the O content the furthest to 7.9 wt%, and the continuous increment of NaBH4 proportion to 50 (NaBH4/AC) could not decrease the O content obviously. Fig. S5† shows the inferior dehydrogenation activity over the pristine AC and AC-B supports proving no catalytic activity of supports. In Fig. 5a, the EDH activity results showed that the deoxygenation greatly improved the C2H6 conversion and catalytic stability through the comparison between Pd7Ir2/AC and Pd7Ir2/AC-B. Pd7Ir2/AC showed a 36.1% initial C2H6 conversion, but it dropped to 4.2% after 13 h. Nevertheless, after deoxygenation treatment of the AC support, the C2H6 conversion over Pd7Ir2/AC-B decreased from 35.2% to 8% after 13 h. Meanwhile, it was seen that the deoxygenation treatment improved C2H4 selectivity by 5–15% with less CH4 generation as shown in Fig. 5b. Fig. 5c presents that the deoxygenation treatment greatly improved the C2H4 yield during the EDH process, which was related to CO poisoning and the coking. Firstly, as reaction (5) shows, CO was detected during the EDH reaction in this work, which could poison noble metal sites and weaken their dehydrogenation activity. In Fig. S6,† Pd7Ir2/AC produced 234 ppm CO after 1 h reaction, which was much higher than that of Pd7Ir2/AC-B (21 ppm CO) under the same conditions as shown in Fig. S7,† explaining the faster deactivation of the Pd7Ir2/AC sample.

Furthermore, the TEM images in Fig. 6 displayed the coking on the used samples, and it was clearly seen that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were produced along the metal particles on Pd/AC-B in Fig. 6a, and some metal particles were shifted away from the catalyst surface since the noble metal particles were sealed inside the CNTs.35 For used Ir/AC-B, only carbon particles in Fig. 6b were detected. Compared with used Pd7Ir2/AC-B in Fig. 6c and d, the used Pd7Ir2/AC sample in Fig. 6e and f produced more CNTs and deposited carbon during the EDH reaction, and its BET results in Table 2 and pore distribution results in Fig. S8† showed that the coking covered the metal surface and inhibited reactant diffusion to metal species, while deoxygenation could weaken the coking phenomenon.

3.3 The interaction between Pd and Ir and its influence on EDH performance
Fig. 5 compares the dehydrogenation activity of the monometallic and bimetallic catalysts and discloses the interaction between Pd and Ir during the EDH process. In Fig. 5a, Pd/AC-B showed a 36.6% C2H6 conversion, but it decreased to 1% after 13 h on stream. The initial C2H4 selectivity in Fig. 5b was 35.2% for Pd/AC-B due to CH4 generation since the Pd metal showed higher intrinsic activity towards C–C bond cracking, while the C2H4 selectivity continuously rose to 87% after a 13 h running time.29 For Ir/AC-B, it presented a 35.9% C2H6 conversion which declined to 6.4% after 13 h on stream, and it showed a good initial C2H4 selectivity of 90.1% which improved to 98.3% quickly. The C2H4 yield as shown in Fig. 5c implied that Ir/AC-B exhibited a much higher efficiency than Pd/AC-B.
For Pd7Ir2/AC-B, it showed a 35.2% C2H6 conversion which decreased to 8% after 13 h. This result demonstrated that conjoint loading of Pd and Ir greatly improved their catalytic activity and stability. In addition, Pd7Ir2/AC-B showed a similar C2H4 selectivity of above 90% to Ir/AC-B in Fig. 5b. In Fig. 5c, Pd7Ir2/AC-B displayed the highest C2H4 yield for its higher C2H6 conversion and C2H4 selectivity.
In this work, the CO pulse was employed to examine the noble metal dispersion, and the results were further utilized to calibrate the turnover frequency (TOF) of C2H6 conversion and C2H4 yield according to formulas (10) and (11). In Table 3, the reaction rate (C2H4) over Pd/AC-B was higher than that over Ir/AC-B, which demonstrated that Pd species exhibited a good catalytic activity in the early stage. Ir/AC-B presented a rate (C2H4) of 2454.8 h−1 at 10 min on stream, and its TOF (C2H4) decreased to 570.3 h−1 after a 340 min running time. Compared with that over the monometallic samples, the rate (C2H4) over Pd7Ir2/AC-B was improved to 756.6 h−1 at 340 min, illustrating the boosting impact of bimetallic species on dehydrogenation activity. Since Ir was rarely reported as an active species for EDH reaction, Pd7Ir2/AC-B presented an initial C2H4 generation rate of 2586.9 h−1 at 10 min on stream, which was higher than those of the other reported noble metal catalysts in Tables S1 and S2.†

a The EDH activity results from Fig. 5 were utilized.
The XPS spectra in Fig. 7 revealed the binding energies of Pd 3d, Ir 4f, O 1s and C 1s for the fresh and used Pd7Ir2/AC-B and AC-B as reference. The binding energies obtained for Pd 3d5/2 were characteristic of Pd0 (335.2 eV) and Pd2+ (336.9 eV) in fresh Pd7Ir2/AC-B, and Ir4+ species (Ir4+ 4f7/2 62.1 eV) and Ir metal (Ir0 4f7/2 60.8 eV) were both detected over fresh Pd7Ir2/AC-B.50–53 Nevertheless, the Pd0 signal was higher than the Pd2+ signal on the surface of the fresh sample, and the Ir0 signal was much weaker than that of Ir4+ species. In addition, the Pd 3d and Ir 4f signals on spent Pd7Ir2/AC-B were greatly weakened or even vanished, which was induced by severe carbon deposition on the sample surface and is discussed later.

Fig. 7c presents the O 1s XPS spectra for the deoxygenated AC support and Pd7Ir2/AC-B. For the AC-B sample, the lowest binding energy peak (531.7 eV) was attributed to lattice oxygen (O2−) or C–O; the peak at 533.6 eV was ascribed to adsorbed oxygen species (O− or O2−) on the sample surface; the peak at 536.0 eV corresponded to hydroxyl groups or CO.54 Compared to AC-B, the lattice oxygen and hydroxyl group oxygen decreased clearly, which might be induced by oxygen consumption during the metal loading process and the sample surface coverage by metal particles. For the C 1s spectra in Fig. 7d, the AC-B support showed chemisorbed C, C–O and CO species, while the C–O and CO species were reduced on Pd7Ir2/AC-B, which presented the same trend with the O 1s spectra.10
In order to explore the reaction mechanism over the bimetallic samples, H2-TPR was firstly conducted as shown in Fig. S9.† Since the noble metal could be reduced at 450 °C, the EDH activity of Pd7Ir2/AC-B after H2 pretreatment from RT to 500 °C was examined in Fig. S10.† It was obvious that the H2 reduction prior to the activity test greatly decreased EDH activity compared with Ar pretreatment. Meanwhile, XPS spectra over Pd7Ir2/AC-B after H2 or Ar pretreatment from RT to 500 °C were collected as shown in Fig. S11† and the mole ratios of Pd2+ : Pd0 and Ir4+ : Ir0 are summarized in Table S3.† The comparison illustrated that the H2 treatment improved the metallic states Pd0 and Ir0, while the Ar treatment decreased the metallic states Pd0 and Ir0, which demonstrated that the metallic Pd and Ir were not the active species for EDH reaction and Ir4+ and Pd2+ species exhibited higher dehydrogenation activity. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the catalytic activity of Pd/Ir nanoparticles, we synthesized the Pd7Ir2/AC-B-N sample mainly possessing Pd/Ir nanoparticles (SI) and less atomic Pd/Ir species as shown by the TEM and HAADF-STEM images in Fig. S12.† The EDH activity results in Fig. S13† over Pd7Ir2/AC-B-N presented inferior activity for the Pd2+/Ir4+ species on the interface of nanoparticles which almost lost activity after 340 min compared with Pd7Ir2/AC-B, illustrating that atomically dispersed Ir/Pd species dominated the EDH activity.
3.4 Theoretical simulation results
Combining the above characterization results, DFT calculations were performed on three model catalysts: Pd/AC, Ir/AC and PdIr/AC using AC as a support, and the optimal structure is shown in Fig. S1.† In Fig. 5, the dehydrogenation process contained two stages: ethane dehydrogenation with O consumption as reaction (6) and direct ethane dehydrogenation as reaction (1). Fig. S14† examines the EDH process with mass spectra (MS) as confirmation, and it was seen that a water signal appeared during the initial stage which decreased with time on stream. AC-B still contained 7.9 wt% O species after deoxygenation, and the disappearance of hydroxyl signal and weakening of C–O bond signal in XPS spectra also proved the O consumption during the EDH process. Fig. 8a and c present the optimal structure and potential energy profiles for each step of dehydrogenation with O consumption. Ethane was first stripped off of an H atom by the O atom on the carbonyl group to form a hydroxyl group and *C2H5 (II). Then, *C2H5 was further dehydrogenated to ethylene and water (III). The results showed that the energy barrier of the rate-determining step in EDH on Pd/AC, Ir/AC and PdIr/AC was respectively 0.75 eV, 1.48 eV, and 1.02 eV, indicating that both Pd2+ and Ir4+ species were active for ethane activation. The Pd2+ species presented the lowest energy barrier, which was in line with the experimental results of Pd/AC-B with a higher TOF (C2H6) than those of Pd7Ir2/AC-B and Pd/AC-B in Table S2.† According to the literature, oxygen species could migrate on the surface of graphene;55,56 therefore, the active oxygen species in AC could fully react with ethane. In addition, Fig. 8b and d present the optimal structure and potential energy profiles for each step of direct dehydrogenation without O consumption, and it was seen that the potential energy was higher than that in the O consumption route. The rate-determining step on Pd/AC and PdIr/AC was ethane dehydrogenation with an energy barrier of 2.89 eV and 1.81 eV, respectively, while the rate-determining step was *C2H5 dehydrogenation with an energy barrier of 2.42 eV on Ir/AC. In particular, the Pd–Ir species presented the lowest free energy, which illustrated the Pd–Ir synergy and explained their boosting contribution to EDH activity over Pd7Ir2/AC-B.

The blue, green, and red numbers are the energy barriers of the rate-determining step for Pd, Ir, and Pd–Ir, respectively.
So far, we thought that the activity trend during the initial period in Fig. 5a was caused by two reasons. Firstly, with the consumption of active O species on AC supports, the EDH activity decreased quickly due to the weakening of dehydrogenation in the presence of O species with lower potential energy. In addition, the decreasing trend of activity was related to the catalyst deactivation due to coking. When the reaction transformed into direct dehydrogenation without O species, the reaction achieved equilibrium and Pd–Ir synergy greatly boosted C2H6 conversion.
To further explain the mechanism of the high activity of Pd–Ir/AC, density of states (DOS) analysis was performed on three models without O species.57 As shown in Fig. 9, the interaction between Pd and Ir in PdIr/AC significantly enhanced their d-band center (εd). The upward shift of εd was beneficial to the adsorption capacity of metal centers. Therefore, the Pd and Ir in PdIr/AC both presented stronger dehydrogenation ability than the monometallic Pd on Pd/AC and Ir on Ir/AC. Besides, since the coordination environments of Pd2+ and Ir4+ species were different, it was not sufficient to explain their dehydrogenation ability with the d-band center theory alone. In addition, it was seen that Ir4+ was highly positively charged, which enhanced its adsorption ability.

3.5 The impact of reaction temperature on EDH performance
In order to evaluate the impact of temperature on EDH activity, the dehydrogenation performance at 600 °C was estimated as shown in Fig. 10. For Pd7Ir2/AC-B, the C2H6 conversion at 600 °C reached 98.6% at 10 min and decreased to 10% after 10 h on stream as shown in Fig. 10a. It was not expected that the C2H6 conversion increased again after a 10 h running time. Under 600 °C conditions, Pd7Ir2/AC-B presented an inferior C2H4 selectivity also due to the CH4 generation at the initial stage as shown in Fig. 10b, while the C2H4 selectivity rose to 80% after 3 h and started to decrease after 10 h. Except that at the initial CH4 generation stage, Pd7Ir2/AC-B showed a higher C2H4 yield at 600 °C in Fig. 10c than that at 500 °C in Fig. 5c, and it presented the highest reaction rate (C2H4) of 979.1 h−1 at 340 min in Table 3. Generally speaking, increasing the temperature to 600 °C produced plenty of CH4 and decreased the C2H4 selectivity during the initial stage.
Fig. 10 The comparison of EDH activity over Pd7Ir2/AC-B at 600 and 500 °C. (a) C2H6 conversion; (b) C2H4 and CH4 selectivity; (c) C2H4 yield. Prior to the activity test, the catalysts were pretreated with Ar from room temperature to 600 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1.
As discussed in Fig. 6, coking was the main reason for the decreased EDH activity after 500 °C reaction. Compared with coking in Fig. 6c over Pd7Ir2/AC-B, reaction at 600 °C produced massive carbon particles (red arrow) and CNTs (black arrow) as shown in Fig. 11c, and two kinds of coking species were removed from the used sample surface through sonication. Fig. 11a and b show that the AC supports were sealed by intertwined coking species. From the above analysis, Pd/Ir nano-particles tended to produce CNTs during the EDH process,34 while carbon particles were generated by atomically dispersed Pd and Ir species as shown in Fig. 6b, and S15e and f.† In addition, Fig. 11 shows that raising the EDH temperature greatly enhanced reactions (3) and (4), and boosted the carbon deposition. It was easily understood that severe carbon deposition would cause pore blocking for the used samples. The decreased SSA results over used Pd7Ir2/AC-B in Table 2 and the varied N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms in Fig. S8† proved this conclusion. So far, it was understood that the weakening of Pd 3d and disappearance of Ir 4f XPS signals in Fig. 7a and b were induced by the carbon coverage on Pd and Ir species during EDH reaction. Fig. S16† lists the Pd 3d and Ir 4f XPS signals over Pd7Ir2/AC-B after 5 h reaction at 500 °C, possessing less carbon deposition on the sample surface, and the decreased Pd2+/Pd0 (3.1) and Ir4+/Ir0 (1.9) ratios implied that the active Pd2+ and Ir4+ could be reduced during EDH reaction, causing gradual deactivation. In addition to the coking, noble metal sintering might also weaken the C2H6 conversion at high temperature. Fig. S17† compares the XRD profiles between the fresh Pd7Ir2/AC-B and used Pd7Ir2/AC-B samples. It was seen that the metallic Pd signal weakened since the sample surface was sealed by the coking. And SiO2 peaks were induced by the addition of quartz during the activity test. The calculated particle size was 9.1 nm for the used Pd7Ir2/AC-B sample through the Scherrer equation, similar to that (8.8 nm) for the fresh Pd7Ir2/AC-B sample. Since it was difficult to distinguish and count the metal particles in the TEM images for the used samples, STEM and elemental mapping as shown in Fig. S18† were conducted to examine the Pd/Ir metal dispersion on the used Pd7Ir2/AC-B sample after 600 °C reaction. It was seen that atomically dispersed Pd and Ir species were also present while the single-atom density seemed to decrease, causing some metal sintering. Therefore, it was predicted that the coking should be the dominant reason for the decline of EDH activity, and metal sintering and decreased Pd2+/Ir4+ contents during EDH reaction also enhanced sample deactivation.
Fig. 11 The TEM images of (a) and (b) Pd7Ir2/AC-B after 600 °C reaction; (c) the carbon species on Pd7Ir2/AC-B after 600 °C reaction.
From the TEM images of the used samples, it was found that the CNT growth was based on the Pd/Ir nanoparticles in Fig. 6a and d and 11c, and these nanoparticles could be sealed inside the CNTs and separated from the catalyst surface as Scheme 1 shows, which was also detected in Fig. S15a–d.† Nevertheless, carbon particles could be generated over atomically dispersed Pd or Ir species. In addition, combining the C2H4 selectivity variation over Pd/AC-B in Fig. 5b, it was predicted that the main by-product CH4 was mostly produced over Pd sites including the isolated Pd species or Pd sites on nanoparticles according to reaction (3) as shown in Scheme 1, since Pd presented a higher intrinsic activity towards C–C bond cracking than Ir species.29 And the C2H4 selectivity started to increase with time on stream since these nanoparticles were covered by coke and gradually removed from the sample surface. Meanwhile, the EDS mapping results in Fig. S3† showed that the mole ratio of Pd/Ir on nanoparticles over Pd7Ir2/AC-B was 83, which was 6 from the ICP results in Table 1, illustrating that Pd species were enriched on the surface of nanoparticles and probably responsible for CH4 generation. The increment of CH4 generation at higher temperature (600 °C) in Fig. 10 was induced by the strengthening of side-reactions (2) and (3) shown in the Introduction section. Finally, the atomically dispersed Pd and Ir species, especially the Pd–Ir pairs, tended to catalyze C2H6 to C2H4 efficiently according to reaction (2).

4. Conclusions
This work utilized activated carbon as a support for EDH reaction, and it was found that deoxygenation by NaBH4 could decrease the pristine O content from 13.5 wt% to 7.9 wt%. After loading Pd and Ir on AC-B supports, atomically dispersed Pd2+ and Ir4+ species were detected in addition to Pd/Ir nanoparticles. The noble metal on monometallic Pd/AC-B and Ir/AC-B presented a 0.59% and 8.95% dispersion, and Pd species tended to form bigger sized nanoparticles compared with Ir species. The O species on the AC support benefited Pd and Ir dispersion and Pd7Ir2/AC presented a smaller metal particle size than Pd7Ir2/AC-B after deoxygenation, and co-impregnation of Pd and Ir could improve the metal dispersion. In addition, compared with Pd7Ir2/AC, Pd7Ir2/AC-B after deoxygenation treatment exhibited higher C2H6 conversion, C2H4 yield and catalytic stability, and CO generation and coking were the main reasons for the inferior activity of Pd7Ir2/AC. The synergy effect between Pd2+ and Ir4+ species could greatly improve the TOF (C2H4) to 756.6 h−1 at 500 °C on Pd7Ir2/AC-B, which was comparable or better than those of reported traditional Pt based oxide/zeolite catalysts. The experimental results and DFT simulation results showed two stages for the EDH reaction over the PdIr/AC catalysts: oxidative ethane dehydrogenation (OEDH) by O species on the AC support at the initial stage and subsequent direct ethane dehydrogenation. The rate-determining step over Pd/AC and Pd–Ir/AC was ethane dehydrogenation with an energy barrier of 2.89 eV and 1.81 eV, respectively, while the rate-determining step was *C2H5 dehydrogenation with an energy barrier of 2.42 eV on Ir/AC. Pd2+ species on monometallic Pd/AC-B presented higher activity for OEDH, while bimetallic Pd7Ir2/AC-B showed superior EDH activity due to the bimetallic synergy. Furthermore, the Pd species benefited CH4 production and generated CNTs as by-products, and the C2H4 selectivity improved gradually with time on stream due to the nanoparticles sealed in CNTs and separated from the catalyst surface. Atomically dispersed Ir species exhibited superior C2H4 selectivity and the presence of Pd further improved the C2H6 conversion and their catalytic stability. Coking was the main reason for the decrease of the EDH activity due to sample surface coverage and pore blocking, while some metal sintering and reduced Pd2+/Ir4+ contents during EDH reaction also enhanced sample deactivation. Finally, this was an interesting attempt to employ AC as a support to evaluate its performance on EDH reaction, and our results revealed that Pd7Ir2/AC-B showed satisfying EDH activity compared to other reported catalysts. With the improvement of Pd/Ir dispersion in later studies, the coking resistant performance would be greatly solved and this will greatly improve the industrialization potential of AC based EDH catalysts.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
