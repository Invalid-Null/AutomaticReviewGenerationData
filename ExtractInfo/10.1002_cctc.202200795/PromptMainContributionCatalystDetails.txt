Preparation of Shaped Binder-Free SSZ-13 Zeolite and Its Application in CO2 Adsorption and Catalysis
Graphical Abstract
Shaped binder-free SSZ-13 catalyst is prepared by treating the SSZ-13/SiO2 extrudate with amantadine solution under hydrothermal conditions. Recrystallization of SiO2 binder and redistribution of Si and Al species over SSZ-13 zeolite framework could improve the physical and chemical properties leading to enhanced CO2 adsorption capacity and catalysis performance.
Abstract
SSZ-13, small-pore zeolite with chabazite (CHA) topology, exhibits outstanding performance in gas adsorption-separation and catalysis. However, most of the studies on SSZ-13 zeolite are limited to the powder form. In practical application, the SSZ-13 zeolite should be shaped with a certain amount of inert binder into technical form resulting in reduced performance. Herein, shaped binder-free SSZ-13 zeolite was prepared by treating the extruded SSZ-13/SiO2 sample with amantadine solution under hydrothermal conditions, to crystallize the SiO2 binder into the zeolite phase. The characterization and DFT calculation results point out that the recrystallization of SiO2 binder in shaped SSZ-13 into zeolite crystal could improve the physical and chemical properties. Enhanced CO2 adsorption capacity and catalysis performance in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane were also found on the shaped binder-free SSZ-13 zeolite.
Introduction
Zeolite with unique shape selectivity, excellent hydrothermal ability, and developed porosity has been widely applied in adsorption and heterogeneous catalysis.1 As a typical small-pore zeolite with CHA topology, SSZ-13 zeolite composed of double six-membered rings connected via four-membered rings, possesses large ellipsoidal CHA cavities, and accessible 8-membered-ring windows with a pore size of ca. 3.8 Å. SSZ-13 zeolite has been widely studied and commercially applied in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOX with NH3 for its outstanding hydrothermal stability, adjustable surface acidity, large surface area, and abundant ion exchange sites.2-6
Recently, it has been found that ion exchanged SSZ-13 zeolite gave excellent CO2 adsorption performance for its small pore size (∼0.38 nm) which is quite close to the kinetic diameter of CO2 (0.33 nm). Fu et al.7 found that Zn-modified SSZ-13 zeolite could efficiently capture CO2 at low concentration environments, and the optimal CO2 capacity could reach 0.67 mmol/g. Different from the traditional material (low-silica 13X zeolite) applied for CO2 capture, SSZ-13 zeolite exhibited apparent advantages of higher CO2 capacity, lower desorption energy, and faster kinetics. Hudson et al.8 also found that H-SSZ-13 and Cu-SSZ-13 have unconventional and highly selective CO2 adsorption performance. In addition, our group has previously reported the outstanding catalytic performance of Zn modified SSZ-13 zeolite in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane.9, 10 Associated with operando FT-IR characterization and DFT calculations, we found that the excellent catalytic performance could be attributed to the tighter CO2 confinement by SSZ-13.
However, the abovementioned studies of SSZ-13 zeolite are mainly focused on the powder form. For most of the industrial applications, the zeolite powders should be shaped with binders (usually 20–50 wt %) into technical forms with sufficient mechanical strength before being loaded into fixed-bed, moving-bed, fluidized-bed reactors since the powder form may cause some serious problems, such as purification, recycling, and pressure drop within the reactor.11-13 But, in the shaped samples the added binders (typically silica, alumna, natural clay, etc.) would inevitably cover the surface of zeolite and block the pores and channels,14, 15 thus giving rise to additional diffusion resistance and limiting the access to catalytic sites. By now, shaped binder-free ZSM-5, X, 5A, ZSM-11, and Beta zeolites have been successfully prepared, using one-step methods, 3D printing, chitosan-assisted synthesis, and re-crystallization method, etc.11, 12, 16-19 The shaped binder-free zeolite obtain stronger mechanical strength, and better diffusion efficiency pointing out a feasible solution to the above issues.
Nevertheless, investigation about the preparation of shaped binder-free SSZ-13 zeolite has never been reported. In this study, we firstly extruded SSZ-13 zeolite with 20 wt % SiO2 binder to cylinder form. Then, the extrudate was treated with amantadine solutions under hydrothermal conditions to convert the SiO2 binder into SSZ-13 zeolite crystal. The TEM, SEM, XRD, N2 physisorption, NH3-TPD characterization, and DFT calculation were applied to investigate the crystallization process of the SiO2 binder. Results show that the SiO2 binder of SSZ-13/SiO2 extrudate could be converted into SSZ-13 zeolite after treatment with 4 wt % amantadine at 150 °C for 24 hours. Compared with the extruded SSZ-13/SiO2 sample, both the physical and chemical properties of as-prepared binder-free SSZ-13 zeolite were significantly improved. The mechanical strength increased from 31 N/cm to 40 N/cm. More importantly, the CO2 adsorption capacity was dramatically enhanced, even higher than the parent SSZ-13 zeolite powder. In addition, shaped binder-free SSZ-13 zeolite with higher mechanical strength also exhibited superior performance in the reaction of CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (CO2−ODHE) and propane (CO2−ODHP). The successful preparation of shaped binder-free SSZ-13 zeolite has led to further progress in the industrial application of SSZ-13 zeolite with outstanding performance in gas adsorption-separation and catalysis.
Result and discussion
Catalyst characterizations
To investigate the changes in the morphological structure of extruded SSZ-13 zeolite after amantadine treatment, we conducted SEM and TEM characterization of the parent SSZ-13 zeolite powder (hereafter referred to H−P), the extruded SSZ-13 zeolite with a binder (hereafter referred to H−E) and the shaped binder-free SSZ-13 zeolite (hereafter referred to H−R). As shown in Figure 1(a, b), a large amount of the SiO2 binder attached to the crystal particle of H−E can be observed. However, for H−P, the SiO2 binder disappeared and the crystal boundary of zeolite was clearly visible as in the case of H−P. The energy dispersive system (EDS) maps of oxygen, aluminum, and silicon of H−R are shown in Figure 1(c), the distribution of these species is uniform, indicating that the SiO2 binder was transformed into zeolite crystal after the treatment, otherwise the enriched regions of Si and O species should be observed in the images, because of the existence of SiO2 binder. XRD characterization of three samples was conducted and depicted in Figure 1(d). All three samples exhibit typical diffraction peaks at 2θ degrees of 9.5°, 14.0°, 16.1°, 17.8°, 20.7°, and 25.0°, which attribute to chabazite structure.20, 21 Taking the crystallinity of H−P as a reference, the relative crystallinity of H−E and H−R was calculated by comparing the sum of the areas of six characteristic peaks to that of H−P,22 and the values were noted in the corresponding positions of the figure (each sample is weighed in the same amount for XRD measurement to avoid interference of other factors in the peak intensity). The relative crystallinity of H−E was only 79.7 %, due to the existence of the amorphous SiO2 binder leading to the decreased crystallinity. For H−R, by contrast, the relative crystallinity was significantly recovered and even slightly higher than that of H−P.

As listed in Table 1, the bulk Si/Al ratio of samples after extrusion (H−E and H−R) is similar and higher than that of H−P, because of the addition of the SiO2 binder. It is worth noting that H−R has the same bulk Si/Al ratio of 24 as H−E, indicating that either the silica binder did not preferentially dissolve, or it grew back together with the original zeolite crystal after dissolution. In addition, XPS characterization was performed to obtain the surface Si/Al ratio, which was compared with the bulk Si/Al ratio obtained from XRF. The surface Si/Al ratio of H−E and H−R were 45 and 19, respectively, indicating that the surface of H−E is silica-rich, because a large amount of silica binder is attached to the surface of crystal particles. However, the surface Si/Al ratio of H−R did not show a significant difference from the bulk Si/Al ratio, indicating the redistribution of silica binder during the treatment. Associated with the above analysis and characterization results, it was preliminarily speculated that during the amantadine treatment the binder was dissolved and converted into SSZ-13 zeolite phase. Re-crystallization may have occurred during the hydrothermal treatment with the assistance of amantadine.

[a] Vtotal was determined from the amount of N2 adsorbed at p/p0=0.99, [b] t-plot method applied to the N2 isotherm, [c] BET method applied to the N2 isotherm (The selection point range of BET is 0.05–0.12), [d] Determined by XRF, [e] Determined by XPS.
The adsorption-desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distributions of H−P, H−E, and H−R were shown in Figure 1(e) and Figure 1(f), respectively. The isotherm of H−P and H−R can be attributed to type-I, which means that there were limited mesopores and dominant micropores in the sample. From the pore size distribution chart, it can be observed that the pore sizes of the internal mesopore connected to the surface via micropores in H−P and H−R were concentrated around 10∼12 nm. The isotherm of H−E can be identified as type-IV with a H4 hysteresis loop, indicating the existence of relatively more mesopores centered on 9 nm. The textural properties of samples are summarized in Table 1. Compared with H−P, the surface area and volume of micropores of H−E decreased sharply from 721 m2/g and 0.29 cm3/g to 594 m2/g and 0.23 cm3/g, respectively. The surface area and pore volume of micropores of H−E are respective 0.82 and 0.79 times that of H−P, both of which are around 0.8, just equal to the percentage of zeolite in the extrudate (the extrusion process used 80 % zeolite powder and 20 % SiO2 binder). The micropores of the samples are mainly from the zeolites, while the mesopores are mostly generated from the stacking effect of the binder.12 The surface area and pore volume of micropores of H−R increased significantly after amantadine treatment, while the corresponding values of mesopores have decreased, certificating the disappearance and transformation of the binder into SSZ-13 zeolite framework after the amantadine treatment.
Additionally, mechanical strength is an important parameter for heterogeneous catalysts in practical industrial applications. The strength of the binder-free zeolites changed after amantadine treatment and ion exchange/modification in comparison with the extruded sample, as shown in Table 1 (the mechanical strength of samples obtained by treating H−E under other conditions is shown in Table S1). The mechanical strength of samples after hydrothermal treatment was significantly improved without exception, probably due to the conversion of the amorphous binder into zeolite framework, which makes the interactions among the zeolite crystals stronger.12
It is well known that the binder addition would inevitably cover the surface of zeolite and block the pores and channels,14, 15 which will not only affect the textural properties of zeolite, but also have a negative impact on the chemical properties of zeolite. To further investigate the changes in chemical properties, NH3-TPD and FTIR characterizations have been made. Figure 2(a) shows FTIR spectra of three samples in the hydroxyl region. Two peaks at 3733 cm−1 and 3704 cm−1 correspond to the external and internal isolated silanol groups, respectively,23, 24 and the peaks at 3583 cm−1 and 3611 cm−1 belong to bridging Si(OH)Al hydroxyl groups.23, 25 Compared with H−P, the intensity of the peaks at 3733 cm−1, 3704 cm−1, 3611 cm−1, and 3583 cm−1 become weaker over H−E, confirming that the addition of a binder dilutes the acidic sites of zeolite. After the amantadine solution treatment, these peaks become sharp and clear again over H−R, indicating that the SiO2 binder converted into SSZ-13 zeolite crystal recovering the acidity. This is in line with the NH3-TPD results shown in Figure 2(b), the desorption peaks at 150∼250 °C and 400∼500 °C correspond to weak and strong acid sites region, respectively.9 Compared with H−P, the intensity of the two desorption peaks over H−E both decreased after the addition of the SiO2 binder. It's worth noting that after the treatment with amantadine solution, both the weak and strong acid sites are dramatically recovered over H−R, the results of quantitative calculation of acidity shown in Figure 2(b) indicate that the total acid amount of H−R is 3.8 mL/g higher than that of H−E.

Since the Si/Al ratio of H−P and H−E are similar, the redistribution of aluminum species occurred simultaneously with the re-crystallization process during the amantadine treatment, leading to the unexpected recovery in acidity. In Figure 2(a), the broad peak at approximately 3500 cm−1 is attributed to the hydroxyl nest.23, 26 It is worth mentioning that zeolite with defect sites in the framework is usually referred to as defective zeolite, one of the reasons for the forming of defect sites is the lack of a tetra-coordinated T atom (T=Si, Al, etc.) in the framework, out of charge balance, then a hydroxyl nest structure around the missing T atom was formed i. e., four silica hydroxyl groups connected to each other by moderately strong hydrogen bonds.27, 28 After amantadine treatment, the peak at 3500 cm−1 nearly disappeared over H−R, implying that the hydroxyl nest has healed after the treatment. Moreover, the peak at 3670 cm−1 attributing to the extra-framework aluminum sites29, 30 also nearly disappeared over H−R, suggesting that extra-framework aluminum disappeared during the amantadine treatment. Based on the above findings, we propose that during the treatment, Si and Al species in the SiO2 binder and extra-framework aluminum were dissolved in amantadine solutions and entered the hydroxyl nest, thus healing the defect sites.31 Combined with DFT calculation shown in Figure 3, it can be seen that the energies of Si and Al species entering the hydroxyl nests are −0.32 eV and −1.04 eV, respectively. From the view of thermodynamics, both tend to enter the framework of zeolite and heal the defect sites. Compared with Si species, Al species was more favorable to enter the framework of zeolites, which eventually make the acidity recover and even slightly enhanced compared with H−P. Furthermore, a comparative experiment was performed. The same extrusion and amantadine treatment processes were conducted on SSZ-13 zeolite without defect sites. The NH3-TPD results were shown in Figure S2, it can be seen that the acidity of SSZ-13 zeolite did not recover to the level of its parent zeolite powder after the amantadine treatment. It means that the defect sites provide space for Si and Al species playing a crucial role in the recovered acidity.

In summary, a more comprehensive understanding of the processes during the amantadine treatment can be obtained through the above characterization results and analysis. During the hydrothermal treatment with amantadine solution, the added binder and the extra-framework aluminum were dissolved in the solution of amantadine as a weak base, and then underwent re-crystallization into SSZ-13 zeolite framework under the effect of amantadine as a template agent. The physical properties such as micropore surface area, pore volume, and relative crystallinity of H−R were well recovered. Meanwhile, the Si and Al species dissolved in the amantadine solution would also spontaneously enter the hydroxyl nests, leading to a significant increase in the acidity of H−R with the healing of defect sites.
CO2 adsorption studies
CO2 adsorption measurements were performed and the results are shown in Figure 4. Compared with H−P, the CO2 adsorption capacity of H−E obviously decreased because the added binder would block the pores which can accommodate CO2 molecules.14 After amantadine treatment, the CO2 adsorption capacity of H−R significantly increased. It is well known that the introduction of alkali metals such as sodium could improve the adsorption of acidic molecules such as CO2.32 Ion-exchange was conducted with NaNO3 to further improve the CO2 adsorption performance. The adsorption capacity of Na−R unsurprisingly increased to 3.1 mmol/g, being the best one among all the tested samples. Besides, we performed zinc modification on Na−R (refers to the sample obtained by sodium exchange on H−E) to obtain Zn/Na−R for subsequent CO2-assisted dehydrogenation reactions. The CO2 adsorption performance of Zn/Na−R decreased to some extent, but it was still better than that of H−P.

Equilibrium CO2 adsorption isotherms at 298 K for different samples.
The CO2 adsorption capacity of H−R not only recovered but even obviously exceeded that of H−P, this phenomenon may arise due to the difference in the adsorption energy of CO2 on different configurations. As mentioned before, Al and Si species favorably incorporated into the framework of zeolite to form the CHA(Al) and CHA(Si) configurations, respectively, during the amantadine treatment. Based on DFT calculations (Figure 3), CO2 adsorption energy on defect sites, CHA(Al), and CHA(Si) conformations were 0.31 eV, 0.22 eV, and −0.88 eV, respectively. These results suggest that in contrast to the defect sites, CHA(Al) and CHA(Si) are both more favorable for CO2 adsorption, especially for CHA(Si). Therefore, the H−R with more CHA(Al) and CHA(Si) configurations has better CO2 adsorption performance than H−P. In addition, we also calculated the adsorption energy of CO2 in the conformation of H and Zn compensating charges on the Al site (Figure S3). Results suggested that the addition of Zn obtained strong interaction with CO2 which is favorable for CO2 adsorption. This is contrary to the experimental results, probably due to the modification method of IWI which might introduce some large particles of zinc oxide blocking the channels and pores,33 thus the surface area and pore volume of Zn/Na−R (refers to the zinc ion modified Na−R) is lower than that of Na−R, this deduction can be confirmed by the nitrogen adsorption results shown in Table 1 and UV-vis results shown in Figure S4 (d).
Catalytic performance
Ethylene and propylene are crucial platform materials in the petrochemical industry. In recent decades, studies about the catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane and propane to ethylene and propylene have been extensively made for its high efficiency,34-39 which40, 41 CO2 assisted ethane dehydrogenation (CO2−ODHE) and propane dehydrogenation (CO2−ODHP) could not only improve ethylene and propylene selectivity but also transform CO2 into valuable CO resources.42
In this section, two catalysts Zn/Na−E and Zn/Na−R with the same loading of Zn (ca. 8 wt %) were prepared. The catalytic performance in CO2−ODHE and CO2−ODHP was tested and the results are shown in Figure 5, and the carbon balance data of the reaction are shown in Table S2. The activity of alkanes and CO2 in both reactions increases with temperature. Particularly, the catalytic performance of two samples at 600 °C was compared. Results show that in CO2−ODHE the alkane and CO2 conversions of Zn/Na−E were 8.4 % and 7.5 %, respectively, while those of Zn/Na−R were 17.2 % and 13.0 %, respectively. In comparison with Zn/Na−E, the conversion of ethane and CO2 over Zn/Na−R were relatively improved by 100 % and 73 %, respectively. Similarly in CO2−ODHP the propane and CO2 conversion over Zn/Na−R are 30 % and 81 % relatively higher than that of Zn/Na−E, respectively.

CO2 : C3H8 : N2=1 : 1 : 18 (CO2−ODHP).
At the same time, no significant decrease in the selectivity of the ethylene and propylene in CO2−ODHE and CO2−ODHP was found. Abovementioned results show that the Zn/Na−R gave an excellent performance in both reactions, even better than Zn modified SSZ-13 zeolite powder (Figure S5). In addition, we also tested the stability of these samples (Figure S6) and the role of CO2 in both reactions (Figure S7). In CO2−ODHE, Zn/Na−R has a better lifetime than Zn/Na−E, and no significant deactivation of both two samples is evidenced during the test. On the other hand, the same catalysts show relatively rapid deactivation in CO2−ODHP and remain ca. 60–70 % of respective initial activity after 2 h. This is mainly because the incompatibility between small porous SSZ-13 and Kinetic diameter of C3H8 may result in severe diffusion problems and competitive adsorption with CO2,43, 44 and the formation of coke makes this contradiction more pronounced, thus resulting in the rapid deactivation. For the same reason, the introduction of CO2 instead reduced propane conversion. In CO2−ODHE, CO2 can improve ethane conversion because it reduces the energy barrier of the second C−H bond dissociation, thus facilitating the C2H4 desorption. It is worth noting that in this work CO2 did not have a significant role in improving the stability of catalysts. As Figure S8 shows, CO2 is mainly involved in the reverse water-gas shift reaction and the effect on carbon removal was not obvious. These results are different from some reports that the introduction of CO2 could react with coke and thus enhance the stability of catalysts in CO2−ODHP.45-47 This difference could be caused by the topology of zeolite being different. SSZ-13 with CHA topology obtain a vast cage that would tolerate more coke inside the zeolite crystal. Therefore, the reverse water-gas shift reaction is inhibited to some extent.
A series of chemical characterizations were performed to investigate the reason for the higher activity of Zn/Na−R in the above two reactions. In terms of acidity, it can be seen from the NH3-TPD profiles shown in Figure S4(a) that the acid amount of Zn/Na−R is significantly higher than that of Zn/Na−E. In addition, the NH3-IR patterns shown in Figure S4(b) indicate that Zn/Na−R has larger Lewis and Brønsted acid amounts than that of Zn/Na−E. In consistency with the UV-vis spectra shown in Figure S4(d), the Zn species distributed more uniformly and were easier to be accessed over the binder-free sample. CO2-TPD results (Figure S4(c)) suggest that Zn/Na−R obtains stronger basicity than Zn/Na−E facilitating the conversion of CO2.
To further investigated the activation energy of Zn/Na−E and Zn/Na−R in CO2−ODHE and CO2−ODHP reactions, we obtained linear apparent activation energy plots that satisfy the Arrhenius equation by increasing the space velocity of the reaction and controlling the temperature of the reaction so that the conversion of the reactants was kept below 10 %. From Figure 6, it can be seen that the apparent activation energies of Zn/Na−R are 95 kJ/mol and 75 kJ/mol in CO2−ODHE and CO2−ODHP, respectively, both of which are lower than the corresponding values of Zn/Na−E. This can mainly attribute to the improved accessibility and higher concentration of active sites over Zn/Na−R samples. In addition, the time-space yields of ethylene and propylene at different time (7200, 14400, and 28800 mL g cat−1 h−1) over Zn/Na−R and Zn/Na−E were compared. As shown in Table 2 and Figure S9, binder-free SSZ-13 zeolite has a higher feedstock handling capacity, especially at higher space velocity conditions. These results show that the shaped binder-free SSZ-13 zeolite has more excellent prospects for practical industrial applications.

Conclusions
In this study, the shaped binder-free SSZ-13 zeolite was successfully prepared by treating the extruded SSZ-13/SiO2 catalyst with amantadine solution under hydrothermal conditions to convert the SiO2 binder into the zeolite phase. Characterization results of XRD, Nitrogen physisorption, TEM, SEM, etc. show that shaped binder-free SSZ-13 zeolite possesses well-improved surface area, pore volume, relative crystallinity, and mechanical strength. Based on the OH-IR and NH3-TPD results, the acidity of shaped binder-free SSZ-13 zeolite was dramatically enhanced and even higher than that of SSZ-13 zeolite powder. The shaped binder-free SSZ-13 zeolite exhibits superior CO2 adsorption capacity due to its well-developed textural properties. Combined with DFT calculations, it was found that the Si in the binder and the Al species in the extra-framework aluminum were dissolved in amantadine solution and favorably entered the defect sites of SSZ-13 zeolite to reform SSZ-13 zeolite framework.
Moreover, the Zn modified shaped binder-free SSZ-13 catalyst exhibits much better performance in CO2−ODHP and CO2−ODHE reactions than the Zn modified shaped binder-containing SSZ-13 catalysts. In a word, the shaped binder-free SSZ-13 zeolite with enhanced mechanical strength, un-affected chemical properties, and catalytic performance was successfully prepared providing promising prospects for industrial application.
Experimental
Catalyst preparation
The parent powder of H-SSZ-13 zeolite (herein, indicated as H−P) with particles of ca. 1–3 μm and Si/Al molar ratio of 20 was supplied by Dalian CathayTech company (Dalian, China). H−P zeolite was then mixed with SiO2 binder (20 wt %) and fully blended at room temperature using a speed mixer (SpeedMixer, FlackTek Inc.). Afterward, the homogeneous mixture was extruded into a uniform cylindrical body by rapid extrusion molding, then dried at 110 °C for 12 h and calcined at 540 °C for 5 h in air. At last, the product was denoted as H−E. The H−R was prepared by the re-crystallization method using H−E as precursors. The re-crystallization method in this work mainly involves adding amantadine as a template agent with the H−E into a 100 ml PTFE-lined stainless-steel autoclave which was then put in an air-blowing thermostatic oven. In the above process, we examined a range of crystallization conditions and eventually determined 150 °C, 4 %, 0, and 24 h as the optimal crystallization temperature, template concentration, alkali concentration, and crystallization temperature, respectively, the detailed results were summarized in Figure S1 in supporting information. In the end, the sample was filtered and washed with deionized water, and subsequently calcined at 540 °C for 5 h in air after being dried at 110 °C overnight.
The Na−R was prepared by exchanging the H−R for 2 h for a total of 4 times at 80 °C, using 1 M solution of Sodium nitrate (NaNO3, 99.9 %) with a liquid-to-solid weight ratio of 5. After each exchange, the products were filtered and washed using deionized water, then dried at 110 °C for 12 h, and calcined at 540 °C for 5 h in air. The Zn/Na−R were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) route with 1 M solution of zinc acetate (Zn(CH3COO)2 ⋅ 2H2O, 99.9 %) using Na−R as the precursor. The IWI was carried out at 80 °C for 2 h. The impregnated samples were then dried at 110 °C for 12 h and calcinated at 600 °C for 5 h. The entire preparation process was shown in Scheme 1.

Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all samples were obtained by using a Rigaku SmartLab 9 KW diffractometer (Rigaku, Kyoto, Japan), which uses Cu Kα radiation (40 kV, 100 mA) and a scanning speed of 0.01° min−1 (2θ). X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements were employed to determine the bulk silicon to aluminum ratio using a Bruker AXS S8 TICER spectrometer. Nitrogen physisorption was performed to obtain texture information on a JWGB TB440 instrument at −196 °C. Samples (20–40 mesh) were degassed at 350 °C for 1.5 h prior to measurement. The surface areas of samples were calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, using adsorption branches in the range of p/p0 of 0.05 to 0.30. Pore volumes of samples were estimated at p/p0 of 0.99, while micro- and mesopores were distinguished by the t-plot method and the pore size distribution was calculated by the BJH method applying adsorption branch data. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and elemental mapping images were acquired on a HITACHI SU5000 microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was collected on a FEI (Tecnai F30 G2, The Netherlands) microscope. UV-Vis results were collected at 200–500 nm using BaSO4 as a reference on an Agilent UV-550 spectrophotometer. The strength test of all samples was carried out on the ZQJ-III intelligent particle strength tester, 15 tests were performed on each sample and their average value was taken as the strength of the samples.
Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) measurements were carried out on a BUILDER PCA-1200 chemisorb instrument to investigate the overall acidity of the catalysts. The samples (20–40 mesh, ca. 0.15 g) were loaded into a quartz U-shaped reactor and degassed at 600 °C in helium (99.999 % purity) for 1 h, and then cooled down to 100 °C. When the temperature is stabilized at 100 °C, ammonia gas stream of ca. 20 ml/min is passed through the sample for 15 min, and then the reactor was purged with 30 mL/min helium for at least 20 min to remove the non-chemisorbed ammonia. Finally, the NH3-TPD profiles were recorded in a 30 mL/min helium flow from 100 °C to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min. Temperature-programmed desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2-TPD) was performed on the same apparatus as described above. Particularly, the samples (0.15 g) were pre-treated in helium at 600 °C for 1 h. Then, the samples were cooled down to 100 °C in helium. After 20 minutes of CO2 adsorption, the CO2-TPD was carried out by heating the material from 100 °C to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min in helium flow.
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was also employed to characterize the acidic sites and surface hydroxyl (OH) groups of the zeolites. The spectra for surface hydroxyl (OH) vibrations were recorded with a Nicolet IS50 FTIR spectrometer in the range from 4000 to 400 cm−1 with an optical resolution of 4 cm−1. The zeolite samples were compressed into a self-supporting flake (ca. 16 mg) and were placed in a quartz IR cell equipped with CaF2 windows for pretreatment under vacuum (i. e., 10−3 Pa) at 400 °C for 4 h. The cell was cooled down to room temperature for sample measurement after the pretreatment. The hydroxyl vibrational spectra were measured by subtracting the background spectrum (recorded with an empty IR cell in the absence of the sample) from the measured sample spectrum. The spectra of Ammonia adsorption were obtained as follows: after the same pretreatment procedure as above, NH3 adsorption was performed in an NH3 stream (using a mixture of 10 vol % NH3/He) at a flow rate of 3 mL/min for 30 min. The sample was then evacuated (10−3 Pa) for 30 min for analysis at room temperature. The background spectrum (obtained with purified wafers before NH3 adsorption) was subtracted from the measured sample spectra to obtain the NH3-IR spectra of samples.
The CO2 adsorption isotherms of all samples were measured on a JWGB TB440 instrument, and a thermostat water bath was employed to maintain the temperature at 25 °C throughout the measurements. Prior to the CO2 adsorption experiments, the samples were pretreated at 350 °C under a vacuum for a period of 1.5 h and gradually cooled to 25 °C.
Catalyst performance
A continuous fixed bed reactor was used to evaluate the catalyst activity in the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (CO2−ODHE). The catalyst was crushed and sieved into 20–40 mesh particles. Approximately 0.125 g to 1.0 g of catalyst was loaded into a stainless-steel reactor with a length of 600 mm and an inner diameter of 10 mm. The temperature of the catalyst bed was monitored by a thermocouple that contacts the center of the bed. Prior to the catalytic activity test, the catalyst was pretreated in a carrier gas (Ar) at 550 °C for 1 h to remove any adsorbed water. Controlled by Sevenstar D08-1F&1FS Flow Readout Boxes, a feed mixture (C2H6 : CO2 : Ar volume ratio was 1 : 1 : 18) at a total flow rate of 60 ml/min was introduced into the reactor during the test. The products were analyzed by a flame ionization detector (FID). The catalytic measurements for each sample were carried out at a temperature ranging from 550 °C to 650 °C. The samples were kept at each condition for 20 min and all data points were obtained using fresh samples. The CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2−ODHP) shared the same experimental conditions and processes as CO2−ODHE described above, only the carrier gas is changed from Ar to N2. The conversions of reactant and selectivity to primary product were determined using the equations 1–3 as follows:

Wherein Xi is the molar rate of component i, n=2 (in the CO2−ODHE) or 3 (in the CO2−ODHP). It is of importance to emphasize that although the rate should be normalized to the number of active centers and not to the unit mass of the catalyst, the rate was used for comparing catalysts in this study, and considering the number of active sites was not often reported, it is, therefore, necessary to use the mass of the catalyst.
Density Functional Theory Calculations
To gain insight into the re-crystallization process of SSZ-13 zeolite and different sites (Si, Al, Zn) on CO2 adsorption properties. A periodic supercell (2×1×2) was used to represent the topology of zeolite (Figure 7). The crystallographic structure of SSZ-13 zeolite was adopted from the database maintained by the International Zeolite Association. All periodic DFT calculations were conducted with the CASTEP code in Materials Studio. Generalized gradient approximation of PBE form was used to describe electron exchange and correlation. Ultrasoft pseudopotentials and a plane wave cutoff energy of 450 eV were used for core and valence states, respectively. All calculations were performed spin polarized and van der Waals forces. We converged self-consistent field electronic energies to 2×10−6 eV atom−1 and atomic forces for geometric relaxation using the conjugate gradient algorithm to less than 0.05 eV Å−1. The Gamma point was used to sample the surface Brillouin zone.
