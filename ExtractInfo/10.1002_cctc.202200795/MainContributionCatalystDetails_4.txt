 Based on the provided document, this does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation. The document focuses on the application of SSZ-13 zeolite catalysts for CO2 adsorption and CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. While it mentions oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, this process utilizes CO2 as an oxidizing agent rather than being a pure propane dehydrogenation reaction.
