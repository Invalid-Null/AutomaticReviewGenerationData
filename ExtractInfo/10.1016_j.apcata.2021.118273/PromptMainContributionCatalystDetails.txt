1. Introduction
The production of valuable platform chemicals such as ethylene, propylene, styrene and others via oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes (C2-C4) isobutane, and ethylbenzene is a highly prospective alternative. The huge global demand for these chemicals coupled with large abundance of alkane feedstock from shale gas and other sources has sustained strong research interest to improve the economic viability of these processes and propel them to industrial scale. According to a 2020 report by BP Statistical Review of World Energy [1], there is an estimated 198.8 trillion Cubic meters proven global natural gas reserves, and a nearly 49.8 reserve-to-production ratio. In addition, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projected that domestic shale gas production will hit 19.8 trillion cubic feet by 2040 [2]. Methane is the major component of natural gas, while ethane, propane and butane accounts for about 1–10 %, <5%, <2%, respectively, depending on the source [3]. Besides, carbon-dioxide emission from energy and industry-related processes is widely considered as the prime greenhouse gas (GHG) greatly contributing to global warming [4,5]. The global CO2 emissions related to fuel consumption amounts to more than 32 Gt
, with expected rise driven by increase global demand for oil and gas, coupled with diverse regional dynamics, as revealed by the International Energy Agency, (IEA) [6]. The danger posed by
emission is worrisome, leading to adverse climatic changes, melting of the polar ice, ocean acidification, drought etc. As such, it becomes indispensable to enhance and developed promising sustainable technologies for post-combustion
capture, storage and utilizations [7].
Interestingly, the anthropogenic CO2 can be utilized as a soft oxidant to facilitate the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of the large underutilized light alkanes via tandem processes. In the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation processes (CO2-ODH), the role of CO2 as a soft oxidant include shifting the reaction equilibrium via reverse-water-gas-shift reaction (RWGS) and refilling of oxygen vacancies to restore the oxygen sites. Most recently, the development of dual-function materials for CO2-ODH application opens a new window of opportunity for integrated CO2 capture-utilization process [8,9]. In 2017, Mac Dowell et al. wrote a perspective that examined the potential role of CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) alternatives in offsetting the associated cost of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) towards mitigating climate change [10]. The authors highlighted that chemical conversion of CO2 would most probably not result in considerable CO2 emission reduction, even when the most demanded chemicals (globally) were to be produced from such processes. In order words, chemical CO2 conversion options should be majorly for feedstock substitution and cost reduction, given the large scale and rate of CO2 emission in comparison to the small potential contribution of CCU alternatives in ensuring long-term CO2 sequestration. Nonetheless, the role of CO2-ODH and other CCU processes (involving direct CO2-to-chemical routes) cannot be discounted, especially in complementing efforts in achieving environmentally benign processes in industries. In one of the pioneer reviews by Wang and Zhu, the authors have mentioned several motivations for producing chemicals from CO2 via the CO2-ODH and the closely-related CO2-assisted oxidative coupling of methane (CO2−OCM), and they have discussed several catalytic systems [11].
Generally, there are three major challenges that constrained the CO2-ODH processes. These are low olefin yield, poor catalyst stability and the demand for external heating source due to the endothermic nature of the reactions. Fig. 1 depicts these challenges and the possible research aspects to overcome them. As the figure illustrates, it is obvious that as much as novel catalyst design and development is important in advancing the CO2-ODH processes to industrial level, efficient reactor concepts coupled with effective process optimization strategies are indispensable. Adequate efforts are required in all these research aspects (highlighted in the Fig. 1) to improve the catalytic performance of the processes and close the gap in their industrial application. Notably, the two unique features of the CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) processes are the requirements for effective CO2 activation and selective CH activation at high catalytic activity coupled with suppressed C-C cleavage [12]. Metal oxide catalysts are the most explored catalytic systems, and the electronic character of surface oxygens [13] and their availability play key roles in modulating the reaction mechanism. Electron deficient (electrophilic) oxygens are highly reactive and drive the mechanism towards dry reforming (DR) pathways via C-C cleavage, while nucleophilic oxygens are less reactive but highly selective in CH activation and they steer the reaction towards oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) pathways. Moreover, the CO2 activation is necessary for RWGS and is mostly facilitated by oxygen vacancies, and electrophilic oxygens have lower barrier to oxygen vacancy formation. The RWGS promotes conversion of the light alkanes and the other feedstock via shifting the reaction equilibrium (in the case of two-step CO2-ODH route majorly). In addition, in the quest to promote the catalytic conversion by elevating reaction temperature, the contribution of unselective gas-phase homogeneous routes usually overwhelms. All these portray the complex interplay between the conversion and olefin selectivity in the CO2-ODH processes. Obviously, a potential CO2-ODH catalyst should be capable of achieving efficient tradeoff between the conversion and olefin selectivity. Notably, many other excellent reviews on the CO2-ODH processes exist, and many catalytic systems were discussed therein [11,[14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]].

Current review
Herein, we provide an account of recent advances related to catalyst design and tuning in CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) processes. The scope of the review is on metal oxide-based catalysts, and feedstock covered are light alkanes (C2-C4), isobutane, and ethylbenzene. The review is intended to cover some of the fundamentals of CO2-ODH processes, followed by brief discussions on CO2 activation and activation mechanisms in CO2-ODH processes. In the review, the strategies exemplified for active phase modulation include stabilization of active species in mesoporous materials, regulating highly reducible oxides, tuning composition of the active phase, novel dual-function materials (DFM), and interfacial modulation. Those exemplified for support modulation include tuning support composition, tuning of support morphology, defect-engineered supports, controlled treatment of support, and few-layer carbon-encapsulation. Most importantly, the unique requirement for effective CO2 activation coupled with selective CH activation at high catalytic activity remains the central focus that guide the catalyst design strategies. To further stimulate progress in the CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) processes and the general field of catalytic partial oxidation processes, discussion on process improvement along with challenges and perspectives are also provided. In particular, the critical insights and outlines on future research directions are hope to serve as roadmap to researchers in advancing the CO2-ODH process towards commercial and industrial level.
1.1. Comparison among DDH, O2-ODH, CO2-ODH, and (CO2 + O2)-ODH
The reactive nature of light olefins compared to their alkanes counterparts constitute them as indispensable building block chemicals in the petrochemical industry. Currently, these chemicals are produced commercially via steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking (FCC), and catalytic dehydrogenation. However, challenges associated with these processes, dynamics in market demand, feedstock sustainability, and the quest for more environmentally benign process have prompted intense research efforts to develop new alternative technologies. The first two processes utilize naphtha, light diesel, and other oil byproducts as feedstock and they are difficult to adjust in terms of product selectivity (especially propylene), and steam cracking is highly energy-intensive. The catalytic direct dehydrogenation (DDH) is inherently constrained (thermodynamically) in terms of alkane conversion coupled with rapid catalyst deactivation due to coking [28]. Detailed discussion on DDH in terms of the process, catalytic systems and patented technologies can be found elsewhere [29]. To alleviate the thermodynamic limitation related to conversion, facilitating catalytic dehydrogenation via oxidative route presents a promising alternative.
The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) can be facilitated with molecular oxygen (O2-ODH) as an oxidizing agent or with lattice oxygens of metal oxide catalysts. Progress on oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes has been discussed extensively [28,30]. Another promising alternative is the CO2-ODH, where CO2 is utilized as a soft oxidant. In a recent review, Otroshchenko et al. have critically analyzed and compared various catalytic metal oxide systems employed for DDH and CO2-ODH of propane and isobutane [27]. The authors revealed that catalysts based on VOx supported on silica material displayed superior olefin yields (propylene and isobutylene) in CO2-ODH compared to DDH routes. Table 2 provides some comparison between the DDH, O2-ODH and CO2-ODH dehydrogenation routes. The CO2-ODH process requires zero hydrogen input and production of CO as a co-product can recover some of the fuel capacity of the hydrogen consumed via reverse water-gas shift reaction, RWGS (CO2 + H2 → H2O + CO) [31]. Nonetheless, production of CO from dry reforming (DR) pathways in CO2-ODH can severely affect olefin selectivity. From Fig. 2a, it is obvious that presence of O2 or CO2 as oxidizing agent has significant promotional effect on the equilibrium conversions achievable in propane dehydrogenation [23]. Most of the investigated catalytic systems for CO2-ODH can only partially re-oxidize reduced sites (oxygen vacancy refilling) due to the strong inert nature of CO2 [32,33]. It is noteworthy that hybridizing CO2-ODH and O2-ODH through co-feeding of both CO2 and O2 may provide an opportunity to harness the advantages of both processes and avoid some of their individual drawbacks. As a result, the following benefits may be derived:
•
Offsetting the net heat addition requirement in CO2-ODH with the exothermic O2-ODH
•
Improved re-oxidation of reduced catalysts for stable catalytic performance
•
Presence of inert CO2 as co-feed can limit the gas-phase homogeneous routes in O2-ODH that usually leads to total oxidation of alkanes

(b) Catalytic conversion of 2.0 Cr/SiO2 (T=873 K, w = 200 h−1) under different reaction conditions (DDH, O2-ODH, CO2-ODH and (CO2 + O2)-ODH). The full symbols are after 5-8 runs, indicating that no obvious irreversible deactivation occurred. The catalyst was synthesized via direct hydrothermal method [34] - Published by The Royal Society of Chemistry.
Typically, the works of Botavina et al. investigated CrOx/SiO2 for propane dehydrogenation under DDH, O2-ODH, CO2-ODH and (CO2 + O2)-ODH, as depicted on Fig. 2b [34]. Despite the catalyst being stable against irreversible deactivation in all the cases (full symbols are after 5–8 runs), the DDH gave the lowest catalytic conversions. It is obvious that co-feeding CO2 and O2 resulted in superior conversions compared to when individual oxidants were used. The XANES results of the spent catalysts revealed that the nature of oxidants utilized likely affected the lowest oxidation state of the CrOx active species. And that impacted significantly on the observed selectivities, with CO2-ODH having the highest and lowest selectivity to propylene and ethylene, respectively. The opposite selectivity trend was observed under (CO2 + O2)-ODH. Depending on the nature of the catalyst, the presence CO2 might lead to evolution of entirely new active species on the catalyst surface. Bi et al. revealed that the formation of La2O(CO3)2 phase when LaBaSm oxide was investigated for ODH of isobutane, and it accounted for the improved surface specific conversion [35]. Besides, the addition of CO2 as co-oxidant in the air(oxygen)-mediated ODH promoted both conversion and olefin selectivity due to isolation of the sites responsible for overoxidation. The isolation is achieved through the competitive molecular adsorption of the O2 and CO2 on those sites and has been reported in other catalytic systems such as V-Mg-O [36] and titanium pyrophosphate [37]. Obviously, catalytic activity and stability in (CO2 + O2)-ODH is potentially better than when individual oxidants are utilized [38].
2. Description of the processes
2.1. CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH)
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes (C2-C4) and other feedstock can proceed in the presence of an oxidant (aerobic) and in oxidant-free (anaerobic) conditions. Recently, there is a growing interest in exploring CO2 as an alternative soft oxidant in diverse heterogeneous reactions such as oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) and others [23]. The use of CO2 as a soft oxidant in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) offers dual advantage of improving overall olefin selectivity and providing alternative utilization route for the CO2 that is known to be a greenhouse gas. It should be noted that direct dehydrogenation (DDH) and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) are facilitated on reduced and oxidized catalyst surfaces, respectively. Therefore, the fact that most of the studies reported on CO2-assisted dehydrogenation are on metal oxide catalysts (supported or unsupported), it is appropriate to term the process as CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH). Evolution of H2 and H2O as co-products with olefins are the distinguishing products for the DDH and ODH, respectively. The general description of the CO2-ODH is depicted as follows:
(1)
The CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) is generally believe to proceed via a single step or two step route [39]. Most importantly, potential CO2-ODH catalysts should be capable of activating both CO2 and the CH bond in the light alkanes, and selectively stabilize the generated intermediates to the desired light olefins. In the single step, lattice oxygen of metal oxide catalysts usually activates the CH bond in the alkanes with the formation of hydroxyl species. Upon desorption of H2O molecules from the adjacent sites containing the OH species, a oxygen vacancy, V(O), is generated ((
). The CO2 participate in refilling the generated vacancy to restore the active site for the next catalytic cycle. The single-step route is more appropriately described via Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism (Eq. (1)), especially when metal oxides with high oxygen capacity and high redox potential are involved. For conversion of C2-C4 alkanes to their corresponding olefins, only two electrons are involved, while conversion of n-butane to 1,3-butadiene requires 4 electrons. Eqs. (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) depict the CO2-ODH reactions of the various feedstock that will be covered in this review:
Ethane to ethylene:
(2)
Propane to propylene:
(3)
Butane to butenes and 1,3-butadiene:
(4)
(5)
Isobutane to isobutene:
(6)
Ethylbenzene to styrene:
(7)
In the two step route, the respective olefins are produced via direct dehydrogenation (DDH), and CO2 consumes the H2 co-product via reverse water-gas-shift (RWGS) reaction subsequently, thereby shifting the equilibrium of the processes forward. It is generally depicted by Eqs. (8) and (9).
(8)
(9)
Noteworthy, the works of Nowicka et al. provided further insight into the role of CO2 in CO2-ODH [40]. The authors revealed that depending on the composition and nature of the metal oxide catalyst, CO2-ODH can proceed via ODH (involving MvK) and RWGS mutually. That is, reactions depicted by Eq. (1) and Eqs. (8) and (9) can occur jointly, and this implies that CO2-ODH can be promoted more efficient than it was thought. However, this is only expected for highly stable CO2-ODH catalysts with robust synergistic redox coupling among its metal active centers, as would be discussed later. Also, the CO2 is expected to refill the vacancies with selective oxygen species (nucleophilic) at a significant rate to sustain the ODH pathway. Otherwise, only the two-step pathway will exist, and side reactions (such as, C3H8 + 10[O]* → 3CO2 + 4H2O) will substitute the single step ODH route. This introduces an additional challenge in the design and development of prospective catalysts that can facilitate the CO2-ODH via the beneficial mutual co-existence of the ODH and the RWGS, because both steps can be limited at lower temperature.
It should be noted that both the single-step and the two-step route are likely to occur during CO2-ODH, depending on the nature of the catalyst involved and the operating condition. Obviously, a catalyst that can promote the reaction via the single-step will be more preferred, because the direct dehydrogenation (DDH) that characterized the two-step pathway is thermodynamically limited, and more likely to favor coke formation [41]. Therefore, it is important to have studies that will explore more potential ways to develop catalysts that facilitate the CO2-ODH via ODH and RWGS mutually. Besides, the reactions routes involving C-C cleavage are undesired, as they result in significant olefin selectivity decline. Among the relevant side reactions are the selective and non-selective reforming reactions:
(10)
(11)
Other undesired C-C cleavage involving direct CO2 participation are the cracking reactions to lower alkanes or lower carbon number olefins, as exemplified for propane feedstock:
(12)
(13)
2.2. Insight from thermodynamics of CO2-ODH
Obviously, CO2-ODH of light alkanes are thermodynamically less favourable due to the high relative stability of the CO2 (with strong CO bonds) and the hydrocarbon feeds compared to the reactions products [42]. The CO2-ODH reactions are endothermic and the contribution of the T
S term is negligible to the overall thermodynamic driving force (
). Nonetheless, a previous thermodynamic investigation revealed that CO2-ODH of light alkanes with higher carbon number (i- C4 > C3 > n-C4 > C2) are likely more thermodynamically favourable due to more negative Gibbs free energy changes [20]. To offset the heat of reaction limitation of the CO2-ODH, use of molecular oxygen as co-oxidant could be adopted, since O2-ODH reactions are exothermic in nature [43]. To reveal further insight into the CO2-ODH reactions, we conducted thermodynamic analysis of CO2-ODH of some selected feedstock (ethane, isobutane and ethylbenzene) discussed in the present review. The analysis was performed with Aspen Plus ® software via Gibbs free energy minimization considering the single and two-step CO2-ODH products (Eqs. (1), (8) and (9)), at 1 bar (total pressure) and 2 kmol/hr (total flow rate) without any diluent. The model takes into account possible dry reforming (DR) routes, however, both CC routes that could lead to cracked products and solid carbon formation were not considered.
As depicted on Fig. 3, the results of the thermodynamic analysis revealed that the equilibrium conversions for all the selected feedstock increase with temperature. From the figure, it is evident that at typical reaction temperature (823 K), increase in the CO2/C3H8 ratio has profound promotional effect on the conversions of the hydrocarbon feedstock (Fig. 3 a, b and c). This reflects the impact of RWGS reactions that consume generated hydrogens and shift the thermodynamic equilibriums of the respective CO2-ODH reactions forward. The effect was more pronounced in the case of light hydrocarbons with lower carbon numbers (C2 > C3 > C4 > i-C4), with ethylbenzene (EB) displaying the least. However, both H2/CO ratio and rate of olefin (ethylene, isobutene and styrene) formation were significantly lowered for all the feedstock at higher CO2/hydrocarbon ratio (Fig. 3 d, e, and f). This can be attributed to possible competition between dry reforming (DR) and ODH pathways. Sandupatla et al. had made similar observation on propane feedstock [44]. It is a worthy conclusion that to achieve effective tradeoff between the conversions and olefin selectivities in CO2-ODH of light hydrocarbons, suitable catalysts capable of suppressing the DR and other C-C cleavage reactions, while selectively promoting ODH and the RWGS at higher rates are indispensable. Besides, a previous thermodynamic analysis on propane revealed that higher CO2/C3H8 ratio can significantly suppress coke formation tendency [39].

Variation of calculated equilibrium conversion, olefin selectivity and H2/CO ratio with temperature for ethane (a & d) isobutane (b & e) and ethylbenzene (c & f) during CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH). The thermodynamic calculations were performed with Aspen Plus ® software via Gibbs free energy minimization procedure at 1 bar (total pressure) and 2 kmol/hr (total flow rate) without any diluent. A two-step CO2-ODH (dehydrogenation followed RWGS reaction) with possible dry reforming (DR) was considered without involving C-C cleavage, C-C coupling and solid carbon formation.
2.3. CO2-ODH catalytic performances
In CO2-ODH conversion of light alkanes to the corresponding olefins, the alkane catalytic conversion, CO2 conversion and the olefin selectivity are the important performance parameters. Measurement of these parameters over long time on stream operation can provide insight on the stability of the particular catalysts being tested. The alkane conversion clearly indicates the extent of both the CH and CC activations, which account for the ODH activity and activities of undesired pathways such as dry reforming and cracking, respectively. Beside measurement of these parameters, establishment of the property-performance relationships is crucial, because it provides the basis for further tuning of the catalysts and serves as a useful guideline in the design of other potential catalysts with improved catalytic performance. In some of the CO2-ODH literatures, CO2 conversions are not reported. And those reported are at best the net conversion rates, because CO2 can both be consumed and generated in the reactions. To compare catalytic activity between different reported catalysts, the turnover frequency (TOF) is a more suitable index compared to reactant conversion expressed in percentage (%) that is used conventionally. This is true because catalytic activity is not only dependent on the unique nature of the active sites of the different catalysts. Several other factors are important, which include (i) amount of the catalyst used (ii) feed dilution (iii) number of exposed active sites (iv) number of sites that are potentially activated under the reaction condition. In instances where the TOF is reported in different papers, comparison of the catalytic activities can still be inadequate due to discrepancies in the active site estimation technique being utilized (such as XPS or H2-TPR etc). All these are in addition to the fact that different definitions of the TOF exist in the literature, and the nature of the different reactors being used has significant influence on the catalytic activities.
Obviously, the catalytic performances so far reported for the CO2-ODH of light alkanes is still below an industrially viable level. Notably, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7 shows the catalytic performances of various catalysts reported for CO2-ODH of different feedstock (ethane, propane, n-butane, isobutene and ethylbenzene) to their corresponding olefins. Most of the catalyst systems explored for CO2-ODH commonly have Cr and V as their main active components, mainly due to the promising performances observed. In addition, selective oxidation reactions such as ODH requires metal oxide systems with medium metal-oxygen (MO) bond strength to allow for good selectivity and reactivity, and the covalent nature of oxides such as vanadates make them suitable candidates [45]. Moreover, the ability of these species to have variable oxidation state (V; +3, +4, and +5: Cr; +2, +3, +5, and +6) provided unique opportunity to tune their coordination chemistry through controlling of the surface termination of the MOx species. Low coordination MOx species are known to selectively favor oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes to olefin [46]. In supported vanadia catalysts, terminal VO, bridging VOV or interfacial V-O-support oxygen species exist, and it is more likely that V-O-support or VO functionality (especially from ensemble of two vanadium atoms) constitute the main active sites responsible for CH activation [47]. The interfacial oxygens or coordinatively unsaturated V atoms (for non-oxidative CH activation) may be the stable sites for long time-on-stream performance after most of the VO have been consumed [48]. Nonetheless, small isolated VOx clusters are expected to be more selective due to stronger metal-oxygen bonds compared to condensed (polymeric) clusters. In addition, catalysts with either Cr or V as the main active centers usually have excellent redox property, partly due to the small changes in structure and oxidation state that these metal centers undergo during redox transformation [49].

Most importantly, irrespective of the type of active metal component, it is the chemical nature and distribution of the surface oxygen species (O2−) available within the active centers that play key role in defining selectivity during selective oxidative reactions of alkanes [50]. Less reactive oxygens (electron-rich) which are nucleophilic in nature will most likely favor selective CH activation to olefins [49]. Controlled incorporation of noble metals such as Ru and Pd (as CO2 activators) to further modify the redox character of the Cr- and V-based catalysts (as bimetallics or mixed oxides) is crucial, mainly due to the strong inertness of CO2 as a co-feed [51]. Obviously, more studies involving Cr- and V-based catalysts for CO2-ODH will continue to surge, largely for the quest to improve their catalytic performances and establishing strong property-activity relationships. Unravelling the unique nature of the active sites involved in those catalyst is crucial. Besides, bimetallic systems such as Fe3Ni/CeO2 and Ni1Fe3/CeO2-ZrO2 appeared to be highly promising due to presence of highly stabilized CO2-activation and CH activation sites.
The Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7 provide important highlights about the property-activity relationships of the various catalysts tabulated therein. As such, the tables will not be discussed further in the manuscript, except in few instances where reference will be made. However, detailed illustration of the various catalyst design and tuning strategies for CO2-ODH will be presented and discussed in a later section. It is noteworthy that the obtained olefin yields from the various catalytic systems are low and further significant research efforts are required. Feasibility studies on industrial implementation of the ODH process, particularly the CO2-ODH are important, however, it is not solely an issue of olefin selectivity improvement. Factors such as energy demand, feedstock cost and total production costs are crucial, and different industries would have different perspectives and considerations on what constitute an economic target yield for the olefins.
2.4. Roles of CO2 in CO2-assisted ODH (CO2-ODH)
Several findings have revealed that the presence of CO2 as a soft oxidant in oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes (C2-C4) and other feedstock has significant promotional effect in terms of activity and selectivity. There are excellent works that critically investigated the role of CO2 in the CO2-ODH through well-designed experiments. Nonetheless, most of the studies in CO2-ODH mainly focused on the promotional effect of the CO2, without providing much detail in establishing the property-activity relationships in the investigated catalytic systems. The most commonly attributed promotional roles of the CO2 include the following:
1
The reverse water-gas-shift (RWGS) reaction which shifts the equilibrium of the CO2-ODH via consumption of the H2 generated through direct dehydrogenation on reduced metal sites.
(14)
2
Restoring of the reactive oxygen species on the reduced sites to refill the generated vacancies (site regeneration).
(15)
(16)
3
Suppressing the formation of carbon (coke) during reaction that could potentially lead to site deactivation.
(17)
(18)
4
Blockage of unselective electrophilic oxygen species and/or inhibition of further reactions of generated alkyl radicals with the active sites [87]. CO2 can limit formation of electrophilic oxygens on catalyst surface [88].
In all the above reactions, CO is a common product. Therefore, the evolution of CO in CO2-ODH is likely from one or a combination of these reactions. The role of CO2 through RWGS can improve CO2-ODH activity and selectivity, while its role in site regeneration is crucial for long term stability. It should be noted that activation of CO2 is a requirement, and in situ experiments can help in revealing whether suspected active sites on the investigated catalyst can activate the CO2 effectively.
2.5. CO2 activation
In metal oxide catalytic systems, the available surface cationic and anionic species can act as Lewis acid sites (electron-pair acceptors) and Lewis basic sites (electron-pair donors), respectively. CO2 is highly inert chemically due to its strong CO bonds. It can be activated on Lewis acid sites and basic sites via chemical interaction with its electron-rich O atom and electron-deficient C atom, respectively [89]. Moreover, CO2 can be activated on oxygen vacancy or oxygen-defective sites [90]. The mechanism that the CO2 activation is promoted depends strongly on the nature of the catalyst involved. It should be noted that strong active sites are required, majorly due to the large bandgap of the molecule between its highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and its lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) [91]. In CO2 activation via thermocatalytic routes, the major intermediate species produced over the catalytic surfaces are CO, formate (HCOO) and carboxyl (COOH) species [89]. The intermediate that is more favorably stabilized on particular active sites will have lower formation energy barrier and will be predominant [92]. Presence of pre-adsorbed hydrogen especially on oxygen-defective sites could favor formation of the HCOO and COOH via reductive hydrogenation of CO2 over CO formation [90]. The COOH has an OH group attached to the carbon of its carbonyl group (CO), while HCOO has a H atom and an O atom attached. Basically, the activation may proceed via two mechanisms to produce the O or OH species required for CH activation during CO2-ODH. Either via strongly endothermic route,
(path I) or via more energetically favorable routes;
(path II),
(path III). The HCOO/ COOH intermediates further decompose to yield CHO and O or CO and OH, respectively.
Jalid et al. investigated CO2-ODH of ethane over transition metal catalysts (Rh, Ru, Ni and Co) via ab initio microkinetic model (MKM) [93]. The authors revealed a mechanistic insight that the CO2 activation via direct dissociation (path I) was more favorable compared to the formate (HCOO) and carboxyl (COOH) mediated pathways, and the reactivity trend follows Co > Ru > Ni > Rh. The CO2 reduction over the (111) surface occurred predominantly via RWGS as evident from the comparable CO and H2O production rates relative to the CO2 consumption rate [93], and electronic charge transfer from the metal surfaces to the adsorbed CO2 controls the C = O activation [89,94]. Table 8 shows the thermodynamic and kinetic energy requirement for the CO2 activation routes over a Pd site [95], and it appeared that the direct dissociation route (path I) was the least favorable. From the table, it is obvious that the presence of adsorbed H in path II and III lowered the barrier for CO2 activation significantly. The adsorbed H may be formed from initial CH activation or generated in situ from dynamic changes on catalyst surface. During CO2-ODH on Ga/ZSM-5, it was found that the protons of the in situ evolved [GaH]2+ species were directly involved in CO2 activation [66] via the path III. The [GaH]2+ is a strong Lewis acid site (LAS) formed via a proton transfer from Brønsted acid sites (BAS) of ZSM-5 zeolite to the supported Ga+ species after reductive treatment [96].

Notably, catalysts that could be effective for CO2 activation are catalysts active for RWGS (beneficial), CO2 hydrogenation (could be beneficial), and dry reforming (DR) reaction (non-beneficial due to C-C cleavage). Bifunctional materials either as binary or ternary metal/oxide based catalysts or supported metal/oxide based catalysts are suitable for CO2 assisted ODH roles. Interestingly, the active metals that catalyze these three reactions are common among them. DRM proceed on metallic sites, while CO2-ODH usually require the active phase be composed of redox metal centers and basic sites for CH and CO2 activation, respectively. The DRM and cracking reactions are highly detrimental to the olefin selectivity and occur due to possible consecutive and parallel C-C cleavage in the CO2-ODH. Decomposition of the hydrocarbon feed may occur at typical CO2-ODH reaction temperature, however, the generated coke could be consumed via reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C → 2CO). Moreover, parallel and consecutive overoxidation reactions are other important side routes that usually cause significant decline in the olefin selectivity. Thus, the development of efficient catalysts that could selectively facilitate CO2-ODH at high catalytic activity would require systematic tuning of the compositional and structural properties of catalysts in order to turn off the sites responsible for DR and C-C cleavage.
As evident from the catalytic activity of the various catalysts tabulated in Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, the data regarding CO2 conversion is missing in most of the CO2-ODH literatures. As depicted on Table 4, bimtallic Ga-V, Ga-Zr, V-Zr and trimetallic V-Zr-Ga supported on ZSM-5 displayed high CO2 conversion (46.5–48.7 %) and good ODH activity (22.9–37.2 %) in CO2-ODH of propane [60]. Moreover, incorporating Zn over ZSM-5 potentially enhanced the stabilization of the sites responsible for CO2 activation compared to using silicalite-1 material (Table 3) [52]. Besides, the formation of the CO2 activation sites can also be influenced significantly by the synthesis method. Cr/ZrO2 synthesized via microwave assisted heating gave nearly two-fold (42 %) CO2 conversion relative to conventional heating (Table 4) [57]. High concentration of the active metal responsible for the CO2 activation can promote better CO2 conversion [34,62]. However, it should be adequately regulated not to limit access to the CH activation sites due to large CO2 adsorption, especially when the active metals for the CH and CO2 activations are different. This is obvious from the catalytic performance of RuxCr10Ox/SiO2 (Table 4), where further increase in Ru content from 1 to 3 wt % improved the CO2 activity but with corresponding 50 % decline in the ODH activity [51]. In bimetallic NiFe/CeO2 (Table 5), the Ni species mostly existed in metal form and higher Ni content in the catalyst promotes CO2 activity while dry reforming routes may likely dominate [68]. The choice of support material can strongly influence the CO2 activity, as Ni1Fe3/ZrO2 and Ni1Fe3/CeO2 gave 35.1 and 18.7 % CO2 conversions during CO2-ODH of n-butane, respectively (Table 5) [72].
Moreover, higher reaction temperature may promote better CO2 conversion, as nearly two-fold improvement was observed over 5% Cr_TUD-1 when the temperature was raised from 550 to 600 °C (Table 4) [65]. All the examples are clear indications that as much as higher CO2 conversion is important, the development of CO2-ODH catalysts that can achieve efficient tradeoff between the CO2 activity and the ODH activity is necessary. Besides, CO2 activation is strongly influenced by presence of regulated structural defects. Most recently, Yamaguchi et al. found that introduction of ZrO2 (> 50 %) into CeO2 effectively induced high oxygen vacancy formation, and the ceria-zirconia mixed phase (CexZrx-1O2) promoted CO2 activation at much lower temperature [97]. The CexZrx-1O2 is highly thermally-stable and could be further tuned by incorporating an appropriate active phase to develop a potential CO2-ODH. Typically, Raju et al. have reported that VOx/CeO2-ZrO2 gave good performance (n-C4 conv., 28.5 % & total C4 olefin selectivity of 45.6 %) in CO2-ODH of n-butane (Table 5) [71]. The authors revealed that facile oxygen transport from the support significantly enhanced the redox properties of the VOx species. Similarly, CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2 was reported to be active for CO2-ODH of ethane (Table 3), however, it suffered deactivation and low ethylene formation rate [98].
Interfacial modulation provides an effective alternative to improve CO2-ODH catalysts, because CO2 activation as a crucial step in CO2-ODH is more favored at interfacial sites due to lowest activation energy requirement at the metal-oxide interface. Typically, Fig. 4a depicts that the magnitude of effective energy barrier for CO2 activation at the interface of MgO-supported Ni cluster was significantly lower compared to other sites [99]. Moreover, the size of supported metal clusters as well as edge or terrace sites can also result in significant variation in the CO2 activation capability, as depicted on Fig. 4b [100]. Fig. 4c illustrates CO2 activation at the interface of Ni55 cluster supported on 110 surface of γAl2O3 via
(path I) [100]. It should be noted that formation of smaller clusters can promote more metal-oxide support interfacial sites due to higher active phase dispersion on supports [101]. Thus, adequate dispersion of the active phase on the appropriate support is important in ensuring the formation of interfacial synergy that can promote the CO2 activation, as most recently exemplified by Li et al. on Ni/La2O3 for DR of methane (DRM) [102]. Most importantly, the nature and composition of the active species and the support that forms the interface strongly determine whether CO2-ODH or the side reactions will be more favoured [103]. Beside the formation of the appropriate interfacial sites, ensuring that the interfacial regions formed are adequately stabilized is equally important to guarantee stable performance with time on stream [104].

The geometries are for CO2 activation over Ni13 cluster [100] (c) CO2 activation at the interface of Ni55 cluster with the 110 surface of γAl2O3 [100].
It is noteworthy that the presence of an active component with moderate basic property (such as oxides of rare earth metals and manganese) in CO2-ODH catalysts could be vital due to the acidic nature of CO2. However, the strong tendency for carbonate formation of some metals such as those of alkali and alkaline earth oxides may lead to carbonate formation instead of the CO2 dissociating on the sites to form CO [105]. The blockage of the basic sites due to formation of the carbonate may result in significant catalyst deactivation. Oliveira et al. found that at low reaction temperature, large carbonate formation was evident on the strong basic sites of Cr/ZrO2 catalysts with high Cr loadings (> 5 wt%), as revealed from their TPD−CO2 experiment [57]. That contributed to the significant decrease in the initial propene yields observed during CO2-ODH of propane. Obviously, regulating the basic character of CO2-ODH catalysts provides an important handle to moderate the strength of CO2 adsorption and lower the barrier to its activation.
3. Activation mechanisms in CO2-ODH
In catalysis, reactions are facilitated as a result of electronic or protonic interaction between the main catalytic centers called active sites and the reactant molecules under the right conditions. For a particular reaction, active sites are different for different catalytic systems. In CO2-ODH, potential catalysts are expected to have the capability of activating both the alkane and CO2 reactants. To rationalize most of the results reported for CO2-ODH, it is important to understand the activation of these molecules. Accordingly, there are two possible scenarios for the activation of the reactant molecules:
i
Single-site activation mechanism (SSA)
ii
Dual-site activation mechanism (DSA)
Understanding the scenario of activation of the reactants (alkane feedstock and CO2) for the various catalysts involved in CO2-ODH can provide insight in the design and tuning of the catalysts for improved performance and stability. In addition, it will also assist in revealing the main catalytic roles of the CO2 molecule in the CO2-ODH process. Obviously, the structural and compositional complexity of most heterogeneous catalysts can be a bottleneck in unraveling the distinct nature of the available active sites in a catalyst and their unique catalytic roles. Nonetheless, properly designed experiments coupled with adequate characterization methods could provide a help in this regard. Moreover, DFT simulation can complement in similar effort, despite its limitation to adequately depict the real nature of most studied catalytic systems due to computational cost.
3.1. Single-site activation mechanism (SSA)
3.1.1. Redox activation
The single-site activation mechanism (SSA) can either proceed via a redox cycle or via site cooperation involving proton transfer. When SSA proceeds via redox cycle, the activation of both propane and CO2 reactants proceeds on a single redox-active metal center (Fig. 5). The redox-active metal center alternate from high oxidation level (M1h+) to lower (M1l+) during the process. Typically, Gao et al. reported CO2-ODH over Ca-promoted Cr-ZrO2, and the CH activation was facilitated on the Cr6+ sites, leading to evolution of reduced Cr3+ sites and release of H2O (Fig. 5) [63]. The Cr3+ sites activate CO2 to produce CO and subsequently restore the Cr6+ sites for the next catalytic cycle. Alternatively, CH activation may be facilitated on the Cr3+ sites, with H2 being produced via direct dehydrogenation (DDH), and CO2 may consume some of the adsorbed H2 via RWGS and H2O will be produced. This is the two-step mechanism (DDH + RWGS). It should be noted that the ratio of Cr3+ to Cr6+ in fresh catalyst may strongly depends on the synthesis method. Zhu et al. revealed that the Cr6+ oxide species were more catalytically active than their lower oxidation state Cr3+ species in ODH, and steam treatment can result in auto-reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ sites [106].

The presence of promoter such as Ca may improve the redox property of the Cr-ZrO2, leading to improved catalytic performance and stability (Table 2). The ZrO2 may not directly participate in the redox cycle, however, it may have significant influence on the reducibility of the CrOx active phase. Previously, de Oliveira et al. reported that CO2-ODH over unpromoted Cr/ZrO2 suffered decline in activity and propylene selectivity due to inability of the CO2 to fully re-oxidize the active sites [57]. The CO2 strongly adsorbed on the sites, and carbon deposits could only be oxidized effectively in O2 on the catalyst. Besides, Botavina revealed that the average oxidation of the Cr species could be as low as +2 over Cr-SiO2 [34]. Also, they found that the yield to propylene decreased while yield to ethylene increase when the O2 as oxidant (alone or mixed) was used, and Cr3+ species were dominant. Another example involving the single-site activation is the recent works of Wang and Tsilomelekis over Fe-doped CeO2 catalyst [67]. The CO2 most probably participated in both re-oxidation of generated oxygen vacancies and in coke removal via reverse Boudouard reaction. The Fe species induced promotional effect in the redox property of the Fe-CeO2 catalysts by modifying the local oxygen environments, resulting in enhanced CH activation activity. The catalytic performance of the FeCeO2 for propane CO2-ODH can be found on Table 4.
3.1.2. Activation via proton transfer
The second mode of single-site activation mechanism (SSA) in CO2-ODH proceeds via site cooperation involving proton transfer. Notably, this activation mechanism is exemplified in catalytic system composed of metals incorporated on zeolite materials (M/zeolite), such as Ga/H-ZSM‑5 [66]. The works of Schreiber on the well-defined Ga/H-ZSM‑5 provided a great insight on the nature of the active sites involved and their distinct roles in CH activation during light alkanes dehydrogenation [96]. The authors revealed that a synergistic interaction involving proton transfer between the Ga+ species and the Brønsted acid sites (BAS) resulted in the stabilization of new [GaH]2+ sites. The [GaH]2+ are stronger Lewis acid sites (LAS) that facilitate the dehydrogenation through cooperative role with the deprotonated BAS (DBAS), as depicted on Fig. 6a. After desorption of the propylene and H2 products, the sites may be restored again for the next catalytic cycle. Most recently, Niu reported a phosphorus-modified Ga/ZSM-5 for CO2-ODH of propane, and the catalyst displayed significant selectivity to propylene and aromatics [66]. The aromatics were derived through propylene coupling followed by series of dehydrogenation steps. In the presence of CO2 oxidant, the CO2-ODH proceeded via a modified mechanism on the Ga/ZSM-5 (different from that in Fig. 6a). As depicted on Fig. 6b, the CO2 is activated by the protons of the [GaH]2+ species (
(path III)), leading to formation of COOH intermediate bounded to the oxygen site of H3PO4 promoter. The dissociation of the COOH intermediate led to release of CO and hydroxyl group bounded to Ga+ site. Finally, the CH activation of propane restored the [GaH]2+ site for the next catalytic cycle.

Notably, the formation of the [GaH]2+ sites and their stability are crucial for facilitating the CO2-ODHP via the bifunctional Lewis-Brønsted Acid (LBAS) Mechanism over Ga/ZSM-5 [96]. Maeno reported the formation of [InH2]2+ species via reductive treatment of In/CHA under H2 atmosphere. The species served as the main active sites for nonoxidative dehydrogenation ethane to ethylene [107]. Thus, when the catalyst is investigated for CO2-ODH, it will most probably facilitate it via similar mechanism depicted on Fig. 6b, especially when the In/CHA catalyst is modified to ensure the binding sites for COOH intermediate to allow for the cooperative role. However, one unique feature of this type of single-site activation mechanism is that water molecule is produced after CH activation, instead of the RWGS that is conventionally used to rationalize CO2-ODH via the two-step route (DDH + RWGS). Obviously, the two-step route may also occur on zeolite-supported metal oxides, as exemplified In/HZSM-5 [108].
3.2. Dual-site activation mechanism (DSA)
The dual-site activation mechanism (DSA) involves acivation of the alkane and CO2 over two different redox-active metal centers, and it involves two cases. The two redox-active metal centers (for CH activation and CO2 activation) could be related through direct synergistic redox coupling or via cooperative role, as depicted on Fig. 7a and b, respectively. In the first, the CH activation results in redox transformation of the first metal center from high oxidation level (M1h+) to lower (M1l+) with the release of water (Fig. 7a). The second metal centers serve as oxygen buffer for re-oxidizing the reduced M1l+ sites back to M1h+, through a redox transformation from M2h+ to M2l+. Subsequently, the CO2 activation re-oxidizes the M2l+ sites back to M2h+ for the next catalytic cycle. Obviously, the occurrence of redox coupling between the metal centers in the dual-site activation mechanism (DSA) is beneficial for long term stability due to the rapid restoration of the CH sites and the chances of occurrence of direct dehydrogenation (DDH) are reduced. Typically, Nowicka reported an outstanding CO2-ODH performance with long-term stability (140 h TOS) over Pd/CeZrAlOx catalyst via the DSA mechanism [40]. The Pd species served as the redox-active metal centers for CO2 activation while the Ce metal centers of the support were responsible for CH activation. Obviously, there is the possibility that Pd species were also involved in the CH activation oxidatively [109], because Pd is a well-known hydrogen/dehydrogenation catalyst, and Pd/Al2O3 with well-confined active Pd sites (within micropores of Al2O3 overcoat) was reported to have performed excellently in O2-ODH of ethane [110]. Most recently, CeO2-supported PdFe bimetallic catalyst was reported to facilitate CO2-ODH of ethane via the same mechanism [12]. Moreover, Liu et al. [111] and Wang et al. [86] have reported ODH of ethylbenzene in the presence of CO2 over V2O5/Ce1-xZrxO2-Al2O3, where synergistic redox coupling between the V and Ce redox-active metal centers was pivotal for high stable catalytic performance of the catalyst.

The second case of dual-site activation (DSA) mechanism involves cooperative role between two different redox-active metal centers responsible for the CH activation and CO2 activation, as depicted on Fig. 7b. The CO2-ODH is facilitated majorly via the two-step route involving direct dehydrogenation (DDH) followed by RWGS, instead of the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism coupled with RWGS. The alkane dehydrogenation site (M1l+) exist in lower oxidation state, while the site that activates the CO2 and facilitate RWGS (M2l+) is usually an active metal in reduced form. Most recently, Jin et al. exemplified this mode of DSA mechanism for CO2-ODH over Ru-promoted Cr10Ox/SiO2 catalyst [51]. The CrOx species were rapidly reduced to Cr3+ species during the initial activity. The CH activation continues over the Cr3+ sites and the Ru species facilitated the RWGS reaction. The authors revealed that introduction of Ru has not modified the redox property of the catalyst, but majorly facilitated CO2 activation. At higher Ru loading, the redox-active metal centers switched from RWGS to dry reforming activity, leading to significant decline in propylene selectivity. Obviously, catalysts that facilitate CO2-ODH via this mode of dual-site activation will definitely require more intermittent regeneration due to high susceptibility of carbon deposition as a result of DDH [41].
4. Design and tuning strategies for CO2-ODH catalysts
Essentially, CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) could be facilitated on metal-based or metal-free catalysts. In this section, some promising strategies for designing and tuning the active phases and supports of metal-based CO2-ODH catalysts will be discussed. In metal oxide-based catalysts (supported or unsupported), surface reducibility, acid-base property, and vacancy formation are the most vital catalytic features. All these features could be effectively tuned via ensuing synergistic interactions at metal-support interface, and the overall CO2-ODH catalytic performance may be improved. Obviously, the tuning strategies are usually utilized to cause tailored changes in the geometric or/and the electronic properties of the active sites at nanoscale. Fig. 8a depicts the various nanoscale phenomena that strongly influence and regulate overall catalytic performance in CO2-ODH, and they include oxygen mobility, charge transfer, defect creation, interfacial synergy, and balanced acidity. Most importantly, the ability to precisely control the nanoscale phenomena can be widely exploited to design efficient CO2-ODH catalysts with remarkable activity and olefins selectivity. Fig. 8b and c depict possible design and tuning strategies for active phase and support in CO2-ODH catalysts, respectively.

The catalyst design strategies involve selection of suitable active phase and support materials that can be integrated to promote both CO2 and C-H activation towards enhanced CO2-ODH. Obviously, the extent of modulation of the performance-property function of the prospective catalysts will depend significantly on the synthesis methods and the physicochemical properties of the constituent metals or their precursors.
It should be noted that the idea of discussing the catalyst design and tuning strategies under common themes for all the feedstock (ethane, propane, butane, isobutane and ethylbenzene) is for better understanding of the concepts and the advances. Moreover, all the feedstock require similar catalysts to facilitate their CO2-ODH to the corresponding olefins [23]. As discussed in the previous section, the mechanisms of CO2-ODH of all the feedstock are similar, depending on the nature of the catalytic system. However, it is intuitive to expect that when a particular catalyst with defined composition and structure is tested for CO2-ODH of the different feedstock, differences in activity and selectivity would exist. One of the major reasons for such is the differences in the CH energy characteristics of the various hydrocarbons. The CH bond strength of methane, ethane, propane, n-butane and isobutene are 440, 420, 412, 410 and 404 kJ/mol, respectively [112]. Another factor that could contribute to the variation is the difference in the sizes of the feedstock in comparison with the size of the active site involved (which are usually ensembles of atoms) [49]. A detailed DFT investigation by Araujo-Lopez et al. revealed that light hydrocarbons (C2-C4) have similar trends in their CH activation over various transition metal catalyst system [113]. Apart from the differences in the CH activation of the various alkane substrates, the chemical nature of the corresponding olefin and their interactions with the catalyst surfaces strongly affect the overall selectivity of the CO2-ODH reactions [114]. In CO2-ODH, the CH activation is usually facilitated by reactive oxygen species available on the catalyst surface. For metal oxide-based catalysts, lattice oxygens are widely considered to be the active sites. Generally, more electrophilic (electron-deficient) oxygens are usually more reactive but less selective in the CH activation, and more nucleophilic ones are less reactive but more selective.
4.1. Design and tuning of active phase
Basically, catalytic systems may consist of standalone active phases or supported on either an oxide, zeolite, or on carbon-based materials. The active phase is usually made up of the main active metal along with promoter metal, and various active sites may be available on the catalytic surface. An efficient CO2-ODH catalyst is expected to have stable sites that facilitate selective CH activation at high activity coupled with effective CO2 activation. The C-C cleavage that usually lead to unselective pathways such as cracking and dry reforming should be significantly suppressed. In the following subsections, the various strategies that could be utilized in designing and tuning the active phase of potential CO2-ODH catalysts will be discussed.
4.1.1. Stabilizing active species in mesoporous materials
Controlled stabilization of active species in mesoporous materials such as SBA-15 [77], MCM-41 [115] and other tailored supports [56,64] provides a promising alternative to tune the active phase of CO2-ODH catalysts. Besides the advantage of the mesoporous nature of the supports, the stabilization may lead to formation of new active centers with modified catalytic features at the interface between the active metals and the support (M − O···Si or M − O···Ti). Also, the enhanced dispersion of the active phase could ensure that the formation of large metal ensembles that could possibly promote C-C cleavage is suppressed. In addition, adequate stabilization of the active species can serve as an effective strategy to limit their susceptibility to migration and coalescence [116], especially under long-term time-on-stream operation at elevated temperatures. The migration and coalescence are among the major nanoscale phenomena that usually lead to irreversible catalyst deactivation. Zhu et al. revealed that higher stabilization of active and selective V5+ sites was achieved on ordered mesoporous alumina (OMA) compared to commercial γ-Al2O3. The OMA-supported catalyst showed superior performance during CO2-ODH of ethylbenzene coupled with suppressed formation of carbonaceous deposit due to facile desorption of generated styrene via the tunable mesopores [117]. Obviously, it is well-demonstrated that the use of mesoporous support in CO2-ODH presents several advantages, particularly the dispersion of the active phase, coke resistance and improvement in overall catalytic performance [61,64,[117], [118], [119], [120], [121]]. ODH facilitated over lattice oxygen of oxides or via use of O2 as oxidant is highly exothermic in nature, and the use of appropriate mesoporous supports may reduce the susceptibility of hotspot formation [122]. In CO2-ODH, the major approaches utilized to promote the stabilization effects include use of novel strategies of incorporating the active phase and controlled doping of the supports. Fig. 9a shows a model illustration of active species stabilization in mesoporous materials. Most recently, Al-Awadi et al. revealed that the dispersion and reducibility of Cr species supported on MCM-41 can be tuned via controlled doping of the support with titania [115]. At moderated Ti doping (1.9 %), monolayer modification of the MCM-41 mesochannels was achieved, and the Cr species preferentially diffused inside and coordinated with the surfaces due to vital oxide-support interaction that resulted. The Cr (8)/Ti(1.9)/MCM-41 had the highest amount of the more active Cr6+ species (as depicted in Fig. 9b) and superior CO2-ODH activity (Fig. 7c). The modification probably had little influence on the nature of the oxygen species because similar ethylene selectivity was observed in all the catalysts (Fig. 9c). The authors reported similar performance on large-pore mesoporous silica (LPMS) supported CrOx (Cr(4)/LPMS-130) synthesized via hydrothermal treatment [121].

In a recent work, Chen et al. reported that V/Al-MCM-41 had higher dispersion of V species (predominantly isolated and/or low polymeric VOx) and favoured stabilization of active V5+ species compared to V/MCM-41, and that led to superior performance in CO2-ODH of ethylbenzene [123]. Unlike zeolites, the MCM-41 mesoporous material is catalytically inactive in CO2-ODH. However, appropriate doping could be utilized to simultaneously improve the stabilization of active species and also promote the acidity strength of the MCM-41 support that could be vital for CH activation. Typically, Taghavinezhad et al. reported sonosynthesized catalysts with acid strength in the order; VOx/MCM- 41 < VOx/Mg-MCM-41 < VOx/Mg-Al-MCM-41 < VOx/Mg-Zr- MCM-41, and their catalytic performance in CO2-ODH of ethane followed the same trend [124]. The acid strength was probed with NH3-TPD measurement and one may apparently expect that doping with Mg (an alkaline earth metal) would lower the acid strength. However, the concentration and strength of the acid sites of the MCM-41 and MCM-41 modified catalysts is mainly related to the nature and distribution of the VOx species stabilized on the surfaces of the catalysts. Probing of the oxidation state and the coordination number of the V oxo-species could have complemented the NH3-TPD results, because changes in these parameters can reveal insight on the acidity or basicity of the catalysts. In a one-pot synthesis, Al-Awadi et al. reported that sequential addition of Cr precursor then the silica precursor (tetraethyl orthosilicate, TEOS) can regulate the sizes of the mesoporous silica nanoparticles [125]. Smaller sizes favored higher dispersion of the CrOx species in the meso-channels and on the surface of the MCM-41 support, and consequently enhanced the interaction of reactants with the active sites during CO2-ODH of ethylbenzene. Besides, controlled plasma treatment can also improve the dispersion of the active phase on the mesoporous support [126]. It is important to note that possible collapse of the mesoporous structures may impact negatively on the long term stability of the catalysts [127].
4.1.2. Regulating highly reducible oxides
In catalysis, CeO2 material has been utilized in diverse applications due to its high oxygen mobility and oxygen storage capacity. Liu et al. recently demonstrated that the rich-vacancy nature of the CeO2 can be harnessed via chlorination of the superficial oxygen vacancies to achieved excellent catalytic performance in ODH of propane [128]. Similar effect on ODH selectivity can be achieved via controlled surface phosphatation, where interactions of Ce4+ species with phosphate groups potentially decreased the lattice-oxygen mobility and led to evolution of a new CePO4 active specie (at P content > 0.8 % on atomic basis) [129]. A recent investigation involving in situ electrical conductivity measurement (ECM) revealed that the phosphatation boosts the electronic conductivity of the catalytic system, thereby regulating the reactivity and availability of the surface and subsurface lattice oxygen species [130]. Oxygen mobility is a crucial factor in oxidative dehydrogenation role and CO2 activation [131,132]. It should be noted that other catalytic system such as iron oxides present less oxygen mobility, and effective doping strategy is required to improve it. Promoting the oxygen mobility of such oxides can significantly improve CO2 activation and consequently the CO2-ODH performance [120,132]. Obviously, the pure CeO2 can activate CO2 via direct CO scission due to high availability of surface defects, and the material can be regulated via controlled doping with some appropriate heteroatoms to develop potential CO2-ODH catalysts. Fig. 9d depicts a model illustration of controlled doping of reducible oxides.
Recently, Wang et al. exemplified this design strategy through formation of Fe-rich surface in Fe-doped CeO2 [67]. As depicted on Fig. 9f, the catalytic performance of the catalysts in CO2-ODH of propane remarkably improved with increase in Fe content. As evidenced from their Raman and XRD analysis, the Fe species substituted some of the Ce ions in the CeO2 crystal lattice, and no hematite phase was observed. In addition, based on the Raman spectra of spent catalysts (Fig. 9e), higher Fe/Ce ratio promoted more coke resistance. However, above 5 wt% doping, rapid decline in catalytic conversion was noticed with time on stream (1400 min) due to possible CeO2 sintering and Fe migration. Elemental mapping of the STEM image of the 10 %FeCeO2 spent catalyst revealed significant localization of the Fe species.
Interestingly, the nature of the regulated host oxide and its interaction with the dopant may prompt preferential formation of various oxide phases with different redox properties. Most recently, Jeong et al. reported a prototype Fe(x)/TiO2 (x=,5,10,15 and 20) for chemical looping (CL) CO2-ODH application [133]. The fresh samples contained Fe2O3 phases stabilized on anatase TiO2, and less active bulk iron oxide species were formed at higher Fe content due to strong oxide-host interactions. The Fe(5)/TiO2 was found to be the most active and selective sample (9.7 % ethane conversion, 91 % ethylene selectivity), and surface available lattice oxygens on Fe2O3 facilitated the selective CH activation. Consequently, the Fe ions diffused into the TiO2 lattices due to Kirkendall effects and formed new trigonal FeTiO3 phase with corresponding evolution of large amount of interstitial oxygen vacant sites. These sites activated CO2 subsequently (2FeTiO3 +CO2 ↔ Fe2O3 + 2TiO2 + CO), and the lattice oxygens were restored for the next catalytic cycle. Obviously, the controlled doping of the highly reducible TiO2 oxide improved the redox properties and resulted in the robust CO2-ODH catalytic performance of the Fe/TiO2 catalyst. Most importantly, the prospect of this design and tuning strategy should be further explored, since oxides such as CeO2 may equally serve as oxygen buffers to metal centers in the active phase through formation of interfacial oxygen sites with tuned reactivity [134].
4.1.3. Tuning composition of the active phase
Modulation of active phase composition provides an important versatile handle to rationally tune and design CO2-ODH catalysts for improved catalytic performance. Fig. 9g depicts a model illustration of tuning active phase composition. The vastly reported metals for the active phase are Cr [56,98,[137], [138], [139]] and V [111,124,[140], [141], [142]] as single phases or along with promoters. They are also supported on oxides such as ZrO2, silica materials, zeolites, and hybrid supports such as Al2O3-ZrO2. Others include bimetallic phases involving Fe, Ni and Co [72,103,[143], [144], [145]] or involving Cr, Ce [146,147], doped phases from Ce, Zr and Al (CeZrAl), noble metals (Ru, Pd) decorated phases [40,51], and supported Ga [[148], [149], [150]] and In [108]. The catalyst design concepts based on bimetallic catalysts, active supports decorated with noble metals, and zeolite-supported active phases are all highly promising because of co-presence of sites responsible for CH and CO2 activation. Most recently, Jalid et al. utilized ab initio microkinetic model (MKM) and probed the reactivity trends of some transition metals in CO2-ODH of ethane [93]. The authors revealed NiFe, NiCo and PtCo as potential bimetallic combination with appreciable ethylene production, high CO2 consumption and suppressed coke formation in comparison to their monometallic counterparts, and C-C cleavage dominates on stepped surfaces.
Controlled doping with an appropriate promoter metal is the major strategy utilized in tuning the composition of the active phase, and various crucial catalytic properties could be targeted, as exemplified by Li et al. on MCr/SiO2 (M = Zr, Ce, Sr, and Sn) [136]. As depicted on Fig. 9i, the modification significantly affected the surface composition of Cr6+species, hydroxyl oxygens, and lattice oxygen species, and the changes well-correlated with the catalytic activities. The Ce- and Zr-promoted samples showed the highest activities which was attributed to the presence of large amount of Cr6+ species located on the surface. These species were assigned medium temperature (350−440 °C) reduction peaks in the H2-TPR profiles depicted on Fig. 9h. The high temperature peaks (440–600 °C) were assigned to irreversible reduction of the bulk Cr6+ species, and that accounted for the low CO2 and ethane activities observed for the Sn and Sr-promoted catalysts, because the sites are likely not accessible during the reaction. Besides, the authors found that Ce- and Zr-promoted samples had lower coke formation compared to the unmodified Cr/ SiO2, but Sn and Sr-promoted catalysts were more resistant to coke, possibly due to their lower activities. Besides, the recent works of Jin et al. [51] on Ru-modified Cr10Ox/SiO2 has opened a new horizon in modulation of active phase composition via surface anchoring of small amount of noble metals as CO2 activators, without necessarily ensuing lattice substitution. The Cr species were the main redox-active metal centers that facilitate direct dehydrogenation (DDH) on Cr10Ox/SiO2, and incorporation of 1% Ru introduced RWGS reaction that shifted the equilibrium forward significantly, as evident by nearly two-fold propylene production rate (Table 4). At higher loading, reforming pathways dominated and propane activity declined significantly due to excessive CO2 adsorption that caused possible blockage of the CH activation sites.
Beside utilizing doping strategy to tune the composition of the active phase, regulating the loading level of supported single metal active phase can be utilized to tune the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) and create mixed oxide phases that could play crucial role in the CO2-ODH. Koirala et al. exemplified this concept on flame-synthesized CoOx/SiO2 through varying the cobalt loading from 0.1 to 4.5 wt% [151]. At 0.75 wt%, a Co-Si mixed oxide phase composed of highly dispersed active Co2+ species was fully developed, and highest ethylene yield around 39 % (46 % conv., and 85 % select., at 700 °C, CO2/C2H6 = 2.5 and GHSV of 6000 Lkg−1 h−1) was achieved. At higher loading, evolution of less active CoOx clusters prevailed, and significant decline in ethane conversion was noticed, despite the ethylene selectivity and CO2 activity being relatively stable. Obviously, the formation of mixed phase structures in the 0.75 wt% CoOx/SiO2 was vital, and their less susceptibility to sintering due to strong bonding with the silica matrix could account for the observed stable catalytic performance with time on stream. It should be noted that thermal treatment as well as other factors such as synthesis strategy and nature of cobalt precursor can contribute in mixed oxide phase formation [152]. In addition, these mixed oxide phase can also be stabilized via interfacial confinement, and inert supports such as SiO2 can tune the electronic features and oxygen availability of the structures [153]. Obviously, the composition of the active phase is crucial, because an entirely new catalyst can be engineered via simple modulation of the constituent active species.
4.1.4. Novel dual-function materials (DFM)
In recent times, the quest for integrated carbon capture-utilization alternatives to allow for in situ CO2 capture and direct conversion to value-added chemicals and fuels has led to the emergence of dual-function materials (DFM) [154]. The DFM are hybrid materials composed of adsorbents with basic nature (usually alkali metal-based) and catalytically active components. Fig. 9j shows a model illustration of adsorption-reaction dual-function material (DFM). The DFM materials are first saturated with CO2 from a diluted stream during an adsorption stage, and then later the second feedstock (H2 or hydrocarbons) is introduced, and reaction is initiated under the appropriate conditions. Interestingly, Al-Mamoori et al. have exemplified the dual-function material (DFM) concept for CO2-ODH of ethane [155]. Fig. 9k depicts the adsorption-reaction profiles of (K-Ca)50/(Cr10/H-ZSM-5)50 dual-function material [155]. The Cr were the main redox active metal that facilitated both CH and CO2 activation, while the basic (K-Ca)50 component acted as the adsorbent. Highest ethylene yield was achieved on the (K-Ca)50/(Cr10/H-ZSM-5)50 DFM, most probably due to its highest adsorption capacity of the (5.2 mmol/g) compared to the other DFMs, as depicted on Fig. 9l. As the Cr content was varied from 0−15 wt%, maximum ethane and CO2 activities were achieved at 10 wt% loading. In addition, the authors revealed that tuning the support properties can influence the overall capture-utilization performance of the hybrid DFM [9]. Higher Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio on H-ZSM-5-supported DFM accounted for its superior performance (45.2 % ethane conv., and 78.3 % ethylene select.) compared to SiO2 (29.3 % ethane conv., and 86.5 % ethylene select.). In addition, the zeolite-based DFM was more stable during adsorption-reaction cyclic stability test. Essentially, the stability and regenerability of the hybrid DFM material are crucial to allow for long-term performance [156]. The studies involving the application of DFM in CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) new and there are a lot of options to explore in other to improve their performance.
4.1.5. Interfacial modulation
Design of CO2-ODH catalysts via interfacial site modulation is a highly promising strategy to improve the processes, especially that dual function of CO2 and CH activation is necessary. It provides an opportunity to promote selective CH cleavage while limiting C-C cleavage pathways through effective tuning of the composition and structure of active phases in supported catalysts. Fig. 10a shows a model illustration of interfacial modulation strategy. Obviously, close proximity between the constituents of the active phase and the support material is vital in the formation of interfacial regions, and various synergistic interactions at nanoscale can modify the available sites. Interfacial active sites mostly have balanced reactivity due to significant electronic and geometric interactions between the different phases involved in the interface formation, and charge modulation can lower the barrier to oxygen vacancy formation at the interface [157,158]. As a structural defect, oxygen vacancy is important for CO2 activation, and it can be tuned appropriately to promote CO2-ODH catalytic performance [159].

(f) Illustration of selective cleavage of the CC/CH at different interfacial sites of Pd/CeO2 and PdFe/CeO2 catalysts [12].
Typically, the recent work of Yan et al. exemplified how the variation in the active phase loading and nature of support can strongly influence the type of interfacial sites formed on a particular catalyst [160]. The authors revealed that the possible formation of Ni-FeOx/CeOx interfacial sites over Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and NiFe-CeOx interfacial sites over Fe12Ni4/CeO2 led to nearly 3 times ethylene yield on the former compared to the later, despite both catalysts having similar ethane conversion during the CO2-ODH (Fig. 10d). Moreover, Fe3Ni1/ZrO2 catalyst favoured dry reforming pathways over selective CH activation despite having the same composition and loading of active phase as Fe3Ni1/CeO2. As depicted on Fig. 10d, both catalyst displayed similar CO2 activity, however, the formation of unselective Ni-ZrO2 interfacial sites over Fe3Ni1/ZrO2 account for the significantly lower ethylene selectivity of the catalyst. Interestingly, Fe3Ni1/SiO2 appears to have poor activity for CO2-ODH and DR due to the irreducible nature of the support to facilitate direct CO bond scission. This disparity in the CO2-ODH performance of the Fe3Ni1/CeO2, Fe3Ni1/ZrO2, and Fe3Ni1/SiO2 emphasize the importance of highly reducible support in the design of bimetallic catalysts with tuned interfacial sites. Besides, the authors have previously found that formation of Ni-CeOx interface also favors DR pathways [144]. Gomez et al. found that substituting Ni with Pt metal in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 switched the catalytic performance from CO2-ODH to dominantly DR, with profound decline (around 50 %) in the CO2 and propane conversion [103]. Similarly, Ni3Pt1/CeO2 showed nearly 100 % CO selectivity at significantly high propane and CO2 activity (10 times and 4 times, respectively) compared to Fe3Ni1/CeO2 catalyst.
All these findings clearly indicate that optimal loading of the species and the choice of a suitable support material are crucial in the catalytic nature of the interfacial sites that resulted. As depicted on Fig. 10b and c [160], in-situ X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra were collected to probe the chemical state of the Ni and Fe species in the catalysts, respectiviely. In all the catalysts, the Ni species existed in metallic form, while all the Fe species in Fe3Ni1/CeO2 were in oxidized form and in close proximity with the Ni species, a possible reason that led to the Ni-FeOx/CeOx interfacial sites to evolve. The in situ XRD under reaction conditions and the fairly low coordination number (CN) of Fe-O-Fe (from in situ XANES) in Fe3Ni1/ZrO2 revealed that the oxidized Fe and metallic Ni species were highly dispersed on the ZrO2. This limited the preferential formation of Ni-FeOx/ZrOx interfacial sites and favored Ni-ZrO2 interfacial sites, thereby resulting in the lesser ethylene formation rate observed for the former catalyst. Notably, the presence of an oxidized metal and precise regulation of the atomic ratio of metal that exist in reduced form is crucial in generating interfacial sites with tuned CO2-ODH catalytic performance [143]. Similar observations were made when the Fe3Ni1/CeO2 and Fe3Ni1/ZrO2 catalysts were investigated for n-butane CO2-ODH, and the catalytic performances of can be found on Table 5. Interestingly, significant improvement in both the CH and CO2 activation activities and the total C4 olefins selectivity was evident over Fe3Ni1/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst compared to Fe3Ni1/CeO2. This is strongly attributed to occurrence of synergistic interaction among the CeO2 and ZrO2 components of the support, because, the physical mixing of the individual catalysts (Ni1Fe3/CeO2+Ni1Fe3/ZrO2) has only resulted in lower total C4 olefins selectivity (14.2 %) compared to that of Fe3Ni1/CeO2 (30.6 % C4 selectivity). All the catalysts were synthesized via co-impregnation of the metal precursors over commercial supports. Notably, the method is simple and highly prospective for industrial applicability. Most recently, CrOx@Al2O3-supported FexNiy bimetallic catalyst (Fe:Ni = 5:1) was reported to have high ethylene selectivity, and the reaction pathways switched to dry reforming at higher Ni content [161]. Obviously, interface engineering with provides a highly promising alternative for designing and tuning CO2-ODH catalysts.
In a recent development, Xie et al. revealed that the electronic character of the oxygen at the interfacial site is decisive in tuning the olefins selectivity [12]. The authors unraveled the roles of distinct interfacial sites over CeO2-supported PdFe bimetallic catalysts in selective CC/CH bond cleavage through combined kinetic studies, in situ techniques and theoretical calculations. In the PdFe bimetallic samples, Kirkendall effect prompted the dispersion of the Fe species onto the Pd species which led to the FeOx/Pd interface formation under reaction condition. The FeOx/Pd interface had a more nucleophilic (electron-rich) oxygen site (
-
-
) and was directly involved in selective CH activation to ethylene product (Fig. 10e and f). The presence of Pd in Pd/CeOx interface resulted in a highly reactive oxygen site (electrophilic) that can facilitate regeneration of a neighboring Fe°Pd° or Pd° sites, or participate directly in CC and CC bonds cleavage to syngas. This explained the reason behind the nearly 100 % dry reforming activity observed for the monometallic Pd/CeO2 catalyst, and CO2 can be favorably activated on the reduced site (
-
-
). The formation of FeOx/CeO2 interface likely contributed in the selective CH activation as evident from the findings of Wang et al. [67], where they found that Fe-doped CeO2 resulted in high propylene selectivity during CO2-ODH of propane. Most importantly, the oxygen species at the FeOx/CeO2 interface are moderately reducible due to strong interfacial Fe-O-Ce bonding, that is vital in limiting the participation of nonselective oxygen species in the reaction.
4.1.6. Site isolation: adapting single atom catalysis in CO2-ODH
In recent times, there is a renewed interest in the design and application of single atom catalyst (SAC) in various heterogeneous catalytic reactions [162]. The SAC is centrally based on the concept of site isolation, where a single atom dispersed on a host material performs the catalytic role [163]. Essentially, the design of SAC aims to stabilize atomically dispersed catalytic sites with controlled size and morphology, coupled with tailored geometric and electronic properties. The application of SAC in oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes (ODH) is limited, especially in CO2-mediated ODH, where dual function or role in CO2 and CH activation is required. Nonetheless, adapting the SAC concept to develop novel CO2-ODH could be promising, since already there are similar studies on direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of light alkanes. In the bimetallic design of CO2-ODH catalysts, ceria appears the most promising candidate support, and concept of SAC could probably be utilized to stabilize it via dispersion of small amount of dopants to suppress its mobility. Most importantly, single atom catalysis will continue to shape the perspective of researches in heterogeneous catalysis [164], and CO2-ODH should not be an exception. Interestingly, the works of Wegener et al. [165] on regulating the stoichiometry of intermetallic compounds (IMC) for tailored catalytic application revealed a new alternative in designing metal-based catalysts with well-defined and uniformly distributed active sites that are catalytically comparable to SACs. The modified ordered IMCs were derived through isolation of active Pt atoms by less-catalytic Fe species, thereby eliminating Pt-Pt bonds partially in Pt ensembles. The catalysts displayed improved propylene selectivity in direct dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) through selective CH activation (which is structure-insensitive) with limited hydrogenolysis activity. Obviously, the works of Wegener et al. [165] and others [166] on intermetallic compound catalysts can inspire design of potential CO2-ODH catalysts, and one of the scenarios is isolation of redox-active metals (such as Cr) that are capable of activating both CO2 and CH bond with another less catalytic active one that can acts as structural promoter, as depicted in Fig. 11.

The first scheme depicts site ensemble (in oxidized or reduced form) that may likely promote both C-H and other undesired structure-sensitive reactions (coke formation and hydrogenolysis). In the second scheme, adsorption sites are structurally-decoupled via isolation of a less active structural promoter to limit non-selective pathways.

4.1.7. Exploiting reactive electrophilic oxygen sites for CH activation
The unique identity of oxygen species (electrophilic or nucleophilic) responsible for selective CH activation in ODH is still debatable, and establishment of strong property-performance relationships for catalytic systems is challenging. This is particularly true due to many reasons that include (i) the composition and structure of active sites in heterogeneous catalysis are complex, generally (ii) The sites are usually formed in situ and they undergo complex dynamic changes while facilitating or initiating reactions (iii) active sites for a particular reaction do not exist in isolation, and cooperative roles that are vital or detrimental may exist among the available sites (iv) possibility of switching of active centers over extended period (time on stream) due to evolution/activation of new sites and depletion of the initial ones exist. Typically, MoVNbTeOx is one of the most promising catalysts that has been studied extensively for ODH. It has VO oxo groups which are lattice oxygen species (
) with nucleophilic nature. However, reactive oxygen radical sites (electrophilic in nature) generated in situ (
) via dynamic electron redistribution process are considered to be directly responsible for the selective CH activation [167]. Generally, this emphasizes the critical role of operando/in situ surface characterization techniques in heterogeneous catalysis.
Nonetheless, it is a conventional cognition in selective oxidation catalysis such as ODH that electron-deficient (electrophilic) oxygen species usually promote deep oxidation, particularly due to their highly reactive nature compared to their electron-rich (nucleophilic) counterparts [30]. Unlike CH4 which has strong CH bonds that are symmetrical in nature thereby requiring more electrophilic oxygen sites for CH activation, the weaker bond characteristics of C2-C4 alkanes means that less reactive oxygen site could be adequate for their CH activation while preserving the CC bonds. Interestingly, the high reactive nature of electrophilic oxygens could be exploited to design CO2-ODH catalysts with improved performance via effective site isolation strategy. Most recently, Zhou et al. revealed that effective isolation of electrophilic oxygens (O−) in mixed oxide catalysts (NiAl-S), as depicted on Fig. 11b [168]. The catalyst was derived from layered-double hydroxide (LDH) and displayed exceptional improvement in ethylene selectivity (∼100 %) in CO2-ODH of ethane. The site isolation was achieved via intercalation of sulfate anion modifier during the co-precipitation synthesis protocol. The sulfate species primarily coordinated with the Ni sites, and significant proportion of the sites were transformed from the +2 to +3 chemical state due to electronic interactions. Obviously, the strategy is promising in modulating the coordination environment and chemical states of the active metals in mixed oxide catalysts for selective CH activation. This regulates the binding strength of the sites and ensure the generation of olefins intermediates [45].
Besides, other studies utilize effective doping strategy to decrease the concentration of the nonstoichiometric oxygen
on NiO to promote olefins production at high rate [169]. The electrophilic
species are thought to activate the first CH bond of the alkane to produce an alkyl radical, and the second CH activation is facilitated by nucleophilic lattice oxygen site (
). Incorporation of the dopants (Sn or Ti) into the NiO structure decreases the amount of localized holes (
) on the lattice oxygen sites. This in turn limits large evolution of the
species
) that might attack the generated alkyl intermediates to cause deep oxidation [169,170]. Despite the decrease in the concentration of the
which could lower the catalytic activity is compensated by an improved accessibility to active sites. Overall, the olefin formation rate is enhanced significantly, especially when vital interaction between the Ni species and the dopants are maximized [171].
4.2. Design and tuning of support
Beside modulation of the active phase, appropriate tuning of supports can be utilized to enhance overall catalytic performance of CO2-ODH catalysts. In the following section, important strategies for tuning supports shall be discussed.
4.2.1. Design and tuning support composition
One of the alternative is tuning the support composition via development of hybrid or mixed oxide support materials. Fig. 12a shows a model illustration of a promoted support (tuning support composition). Most recently, Theofanidis et al. exemplified this strategy and developed Fe-based catalysts supported on MgO-ZrO2 and NiO-MgO-ZrO2 oxides [172]. The authors revealed that incorporation of NiO species modified the electronic features of the NiMgZrOx and transformed it to be partially reducible and active for CO2 activation. In addition, possible formation FeOx-Ni interface resulted in changes in the local coordination environment of the Ni species in Fe/NiMgZr which prompted limited Ni-Mg interaction. This accounted for the nearly two-fold ethane and CO2 activities of the catalyst compared to Fe/NiMg. Both catalysts had comparable stable ethylene selectivities. The Fe/NiMgZr catalyst was highly coke-resistant during 17 h time on stream, and only about 25 % of ethane and CO2 activities were lost due to sintering at the early 3 h, while surface enrichment of Fe species subsequently stabilized the activities. It should be noted that the composition of the near-surface-region plays a key role in the catalytic performance of solid solution supports. Qiao et al. revealed that incorporation of metal promoters (M = Cr, Mo, and W) into Ni-Nb-M-O catalysts negatively affected the catalytic conversion during CO2-ODH of ethane, and the trend corroborated with increase in dilution or downward displacement of the Nb species that acted as the main redox centers (Ni–Nb–O (Ni/Nb ratio = 7.6) > Ni–Nb–Cr–O (12.2) > Ni–Nb–Mo–O (20) > Ni–Nb–W–O (35)) [87].

Depending on the nature of the support and active phase, support acidity (strength and density of acid sites) could be critical in suppressing undesired reactions in CO2-ODH. Koirala et al. revealed that lowest acid site density of silica typified it as the most preferred support for CoOx active phase, in comparison to Al2O3, ZrO2, and TiO2 [173]. Fig. 12b depicts the DRIFT spectra of NH3 adsorbed on the mixed metal oxide supported 4.5 wt%Co catalysts. The TiO2-ZrO2 supported catalyst had the highest amount of Lewis-acid centers (evidenced by bands at 1603 and 1190 cm−1), and that partly accounted for lowest ethylene selectivities of the catalyst (Fig. 12c). In contrast to findings of Koirala et al, a recent report by Li et al. revealed that Al2O3-ZrO2 can serve as an efficient support for CoOx active phase for CO2-ODH of ethylbenzene [82]. Notably, in corporation of Al brought about significant modification of the acidity, and Co/Al2O3-ZrO2 (Al/Zr molar ratio = 0.7) with high amount of moderately acidic sites gave the best performance (58.7 EB conv., and 96 % styrene select.) compared to individual oxide supports. Moreover, VOx/SnO2-ZrO2 was reported to have more amount of medium-strength acid sites [140], and the superior acid-base bifunctionality resulted in better performance in CO2-ODH (22.34 % conv., 36.63 % C4 olefins selectivity).
In addition, Lei et al. found that Ga/TiO2 displayed five-fold initial ethane conversion (53 %) and three-fold initial ethylene yield (23 %) relative to Ga/SiO2 [150]. Interestingly, the authors revealed that silica-doping (1−15 wt%) of the Ga/TiO2 improved ethylene selectivity and stability due to lower acid site density and weaken metal-support interaction, despite slight decline in ethane conversion. From the findings of Lei et al. [150] and Koirala et al. [173], it can be inferred that regulating acidity (strength and population) can effectively tradeoff between CO2 conversion (RWGS) and olefin selectivity, and that could be utilized to control catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. For Zn [52] and Cr [137,174] active phases, zeolite support is more likely to result in better dispersion due to abundance of silanol groups as compared to silica support, and controlling the Si/Al ratio via dealumination or siliceous modification is a decisive approach to regulate the acidity of zeolite-based supports and promote the overall CO2-ODH performance [62].
It is noteworthy that it is difficult to delimit the contributions of catalyst properties on observed catalytic performance individually, however, tuning support composition can be utilized to develop active supports with excellent redox property. Nowicka et al. and Wang et al. have demonstrated this concept and developed highly efficient and stable Pd/CeZrAlOx [40] for CO2-ODH of propane and V2O5/Ce1-xZrxO2-Al2O3 [86] for CO2-ODH of ethylbenzene, respectively. The catalytic performance for the Pd/CeZrAlOx and V2O5/Ce1-xZrxO2-Al2O3 catalysts are shown on Table 4, Table 7, respectively. The decorated redox metals (Pd and V species) and the redox Ce species in the supports were involved directly in the catalytic cycles, and synergistic redox coupling between these redox active metal centers accounted for the high stable performance displayed by the catalysts (Table 4, Table 7). Both catalysts facilitated the CO2-ODH reactions via the dual-site activation mechanism (DSA), with one of the redox metal center responsible for C-H activation while the other facilitate site regeneration via CO2 activation. Beside, carbon materials could also be utilized to develop hybrid support with improved CO2-ODH performance [83]. Obviously, tuning support composition is a vital alternative for development of highly efficient CO2-ODH catalysts.
4.2.2. Tuning of support morphology
In heterogeneous catalysis, tuning the morphology of support materials provides an important alternative to regulate crucial catalytic features such as oxygen vacancy formation, metal-support interaction, reducibility and dispersion of the active phase, majorly due to changes in the local coordination chemistry and extent of metal-support interaction [176,177]. Supports materials with the same composition but different morphologies are likely to have different predominantly exposed crystallographic facets, and that can give rise to significant variation in the catalytic feature of the supported active phase [178]. Fig. 12d shows a model illustration of morphology tuning of support. Interestingly, Wang et al. exemplified the promotional effect of morphology tuning in CO2-ODH of ethylbenzene via synthesis of nanoflake-assembled Al2O3-supported CeO2-ZrO2 (CZ/NFA) catalyst [175]. Fig. 12e depicts the FESEM image of both the CZ/NFA and a benchmarked CZ/CA (from commercial Al2O3) in form of nanoparticle. Both catalysts had similar styrene selectivity, however, CZ/NFA catalyst displayed superior ethylbenzene conversion (as depicted on Fig. 12f), majorly due to presence of more surface oxygen vacancies coupled with higher dispersion of the CeO2-ZrO2 active phase. The variation in the dispersion was attributed to the nature of slit-shape pores of NFA that provided more accessible to the Ce1-xZrx(OH)4 precursors compared to the intra-particle pores of CA. Similarly, Lei et al. reported significant variation in the CO2-ODH performance (6 h TOS) of Au/CeO2 catalyst with nanorod morphology (Au/CeR, 17.1 % ethane conv., 16.7 % ethylene yield) compared to the other in nanoparticle form (Au/CeP 13.1 % ethane conv., 12.9 % ethylene yield) [179]. All the catalysts deactivated rapidly under direct dehydrogenation, however, the Au/CeR was more stable under CO2-mediated condition, majorly due to enhanced surface oxygen reducibility. The authors recently reported that further modification of the support via controlled doping with Mn [180] and Y [181] likely improved the catalytic performance of the catalyst. Besides, support with appropriate mesoporous architecture could promote stabilization of the active phase and its dispersion, as exemplified in V/γ-Al2O3 for CO2-ODH of ethylbenzene [182].
4.2.3. Defect-engineered supports
Promotion of structural defects such as oxygen vacancies is a promising alternative in tuning the supports of CO2-ODH catalysts. The presence of defects usually promotes CO2 activation; a vital step for RWGS and site regeneration. Depending on the nature of the catalyst, the reduced sites may be regenerated with selective nucleophilic oxygens that promote olefins selectivity or the highly reactive electrophilic oxygens (electron-deficient) that may likely favor COx formation. Fig. 13a shows a model illustration of a defect-engineered catalyst. Controlled doping, nanostructuring, creation of metal/oxide interface, and thermal treatment are among the major techniques utilized to generate the defect sites [158]. It should be noted that the barrier to oxygen vacancy formation determines the redox properties of an oxide support, and that affects the tendency of the oxide to lose or donate its oxygen to an adsorbed species. controlled doping involves a lattice substitution of the metal species in the host and oxygen vacancies are induced as a result of charge compensation or steric effect and orbital effects, depending on the valence of the dopant. Dopants may preferentially occupy the surface or subsurface sites of the oxide host than the bulk of the host [183]. Notably, hydrothermal synthesis methods such as reverse microemulsion systems (water-in-oil droplets) can be utilized to effectively tune metal-oxide interaction that can prompt oxygen vacancy formation in potential CO2-ODH catalysts. As depicted on Fig. 13d, decreasing the molar ratio of water to surfactant can results in smaller water-in-oil droplets which can ensure close proximity among constituent metal species to trigger electronic interactions [184]. The intimate contact can create metal-oxide interfaces, and the perturbation of the Fermi level at the interfaces can prompt charge transfers from the metal with low work function to the one with higher (Fig. 13e) and consequently lead to vacancy creation. There are overwhelming studies that reveal the ease of oxygen vacancy formation at metal-support interfaces [101,185].

Recently, Wang et al. exemplified the use of controlled doping and synthesized a defect-rich Ce1-xZrxO2 catalyst for CO2-ODH of ethylbenzene [183,186]. The authors revealed that incorporation of small amount of Zr led to significant increase in the relative content of defect sites that facilitate CO2 activation. Consequently, the redox property of the Ce1-xZrxO2 became modified, which prompted evolution of more reducible Ce4+ species that acted as the main redox centers for CH activation. As depicted on Fig. 13c, the relative amount of defects increased with increase in the Zr content, and the ethylbenzene conversion (10 h TOS) followed the same trend. Yamaguchi et al. revealed that such Ce1-xZrxO2 solid solution is highly thermally-stable, and Zr loading above 50 % can significant suppress the chances for segregation of the constituents [97]. The defect enrichment on the Ce1-xZrxO2 was most probably induced by combined steric and orbital effects rather than charge compensation, because the dopant and the support metal are isolvalent [187]. Fig. 13b depicts the thermogravimetric analyses and differential scanning calorimetry (TG-DSC) profiles of the spent Ce0.1Zr0.9O2 catalyst (for 1 h and 3 h TOS). The peak at ∼300 °C revealed that significant weight loss due to coking occurred, about 2.5 and 5.2 wt.% for the 1 h and 3 h TOS. This suggest that further modification of the catalyst is required to limit the susceptibility of the catalyst to deactivation due to coke formation. One of the modification may include incorporation of a second redox metal as exemplified by Nowicka et al. [40] and Wang et al. [86] on Pd/CeZrAlOx and V2O5/Ce1-xZrxO2-Al2O3, respectively. Incorporation of Cr has been demonstrated to produce a catalyst (CrOx/CexZr(1-x)O2) with good ethylene selectivity (as shown in Table 3). The catalytic activity was low and the catalyst deactivated due to possible coking and sintering.
4.2.4. Controlled treatment
Controlled treatment of supports via thermal activation or use of chemical agents provides another alternative to tune the catalytic functions of CO2-ODH catalysts. For thermal treatment, the activation temperature and nature of the oxidizing or reducing atmosphere are among the major factors utilized in tuning the catalysts properties such as surface oxide reducibility, oxygen vacancy formation, dispersion of active phase, acid-base property, and metal-support interaction [188]. Sometimes, both thermal activation and use of appropriate chemicals could be utilized simultaneously to achieve the desired tuning. Fig. 14a shows a model illustration of controlled treatment of support via regulating the activation temperature. Most recently, Madduluri et al. exemplified this strategy on Co3O4/MgAl2O4 for CO2-ODH of ethylbenzene [189]. The authors reported that regulating the activation temperature Magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl2O4) support can ensure single-phase evolution and promote high dispersion of Co3O4 active phase. At 15 wt% Co-loading, increasing the activation temperature from 600 to 800 °C brought about nearly uniform increase in the crystallite size (16.6–18.2 nm). However, at 900 °C, the size blew up to 62 nm as determined from Scherrer equation. Consequently, the amount of moderate and strong acid sites decreased significantly. The HRTEM images of the thermally activated MgAl2O4 spinel at 800 °C (800MA) loaded with Co3O4 active phase, 15Co/MgAl2O4 (15Co/800MA), showed good dispersion of the Co3O4 (Fig. 14b). All these accounted for the superior ethylbenzene conversion observed for the regenerated 15Co/800MA (Fig. 14c) compared to regenerated 15Co/900MA (15Co/MgAl2O4 activated at 900 °C). The fresh 15Co/800MA catalyst gave 82 % and 98 % ethylbenzene conversion and styrene selectivity, respectively. Most probably, availability of more acid sites promoted RWGS reaction, and the shift in equilibrium was more for the 15Co/800MA catalyst. Obviously, there are limited reports in the literature related to application of the controlled thermal activation in tuning CO2-ODH catalysts. However, the strategy is highly prospective and can be utilized to develop robust catalysts with tuned particle size and vital metal-support interactions (geometric and electronic), as inspired by works on exsolution of active phases from solid solutions [190,191].

(f) Catalytic conversion and styrene selectivity of the catalysts with time on stream (TOS, h) during CO2-ODH of ethylbenzene [193].
On another perspective, the utilization of unconventional energy sources such as plasma for catalyst activation can result in significant modulation of catalytic properties. Recently, Asghari et al. revealed that controlled plasma-treatment of Cr/Ce-MCM-41 (Cr/Ce-MCM-41(Si/Ce = 25)-p) catalyst improved the dispersion of the Cr species and ensured uniform morphology coupled with smaller particle sizes compared to untreated sample [126]. The disruption of large Cr nanocluster ensemble that may likely have promoted C-C cleavage conferred better catalytic performance in the Cr/Ce-MCM-41(Si/Ce = 25)-p during CO2-ODH of ethane (64 % XC2H6, 62 %YC2H4 at T=700 °C for 5 h TOS). In addition, microwave-assisted synthesis were also found to help in enhancing the dispersion of active phase of CO2-ODH catalysts [192]. Besides, Zhu etal reported that steam treatment on Cr/H[B]MFI resulted in auto-reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ dispersed species, and significant improvement in stability during CO2-ODH of propane was observed, despite a small decline in activity [106]. It should be noted that controlled steam treatment can be done in situ, and it can effectively tune CO2-ODH catalysts supported on zeolite support. As exemplified by Mehdad et al. on Zn-ZSM-5 [52], the presence of steam hydrolyzed the incorporated Zn sites, and new BAS and Zn(OH)+ species evolved, leading to suppressed formation of aromatics. The catalytic performance of the Zn-ZSM-5 catalyst for ethane CO2-ODH is shown on Table 3. The initial Zn2+ LAS and the newly formed Zn(OH)+ sites in situ were majorly active for aromatization and dehydrogenation, respectively.
4.2.5. Few-layer carbon-encapsulated support
In recent times, few-layer carbon encapsulation provides another promising strategy for designing and tuning metal oxide supports such as alumina, for various applications in heterogeneous catalysis. Obviously, carbonaceous deposits contribute significantly to deactivation of oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts as a result of partial blockage of available surface active sites. Unregulated acidity of support constitutes the major factor that contributes to the coke formation during catalytic performance. Depending on the nature of the deposited coke, the catalytic activity may experience initial decline and later stabilize at a lower value. However, such decline in activity is usually accompanied with olefin selectivity improvement. Several studies have revealed a promotional effect of deposited coke on the stability of CO2-ODH catalysts [111,186]. Possible formation of active and selective carbonyl/quinone functional groups on the deposited coke under oxidizing atmosphere [194] coupled with the presence of remaining uncovered redox active metal centers accounts for the observed changes. Under non-oxidative environment, improved catalytic performance and stability of pre-coked metal oxides could be attributed to the presence of surface defects/ vacancies on the deposited coke [195]. Most importantly, the role of coke in heterogeneous catalysis can be exploited for effective design and tuning of catalysts with improved catalytic performance and stability [196].
Notably, the prospects of carbon-covered catalysts (CCC) are overwhelming because the design strategy affords the unique opportunity of integrating the advantages of both metal and metal-free catalysis in a single catalyst. Fig. 14d shows a model illustration of a carbon-covered alumina (CCA). Wang et al. exemplified this strategy and developed carbon-covered alumina (CCA) for CO2-ODH of ethylbenzene [193]. The authors tuned the textural and surface properties of the material via regulating the carbon loading and the pyrolysis temperature. As depicted on Fig. 14f, a catalyst derived with sucrose/Al2O3 mass ratio equal to 0.75 and pyrolised at 600 °C (0.75CCA-600) displayed superior catalytic conversion and styrene selectivity. Obviously, higher pyrolysis temperature enhanced the stability of the catalysts but at a much lower ethylbenzene activity. Moreover, the disorder of the carbon species increased at higher pyrolysis temperature, as evident from the increase in the intensity ratio of the D to G bands, ID/IG, in the Raman spectra (Fig. 14e). The same concept was also reported for a few-layer carbon-encapsulated Al2O3 [197], and the hybrid nanostructure had two-fold yield rate of styrene compared to nanodiamonds during ODH of ethylbenzene (30 % conv., and 96 % ST selectivity; 20 h TOS and O2/EB ratio of 1:5). Most probably, incorporation of a metal-based active phase on the carbon-encapsulated supports could yield efficient CO2-ODH catalyst, since metal-based active phase supported on carbon materials were reported to be very efficient. Most recently, Mishanin et al. revealed that carbon-supported FeCrOx active phase displayed efficient in situ regeneration in CO2 stream, and the FeCrOx/C displayed superior ethylene selectivity (80 %, T =650 °C) compared to SiO2 and Al2O3 supported samples [198].
5. Summary on catalytic requirement for CO2-ODH catalyst
Based on the insight gained from the activation mechanisms involved in CO2-ODH and the various catalyst design and tuning strategies discussed so far, the following catalytic requirements are proposed for an efficient CO2-ODH catalyst:
1
The catalyst should possess active sites that can effectively activate CO2 and selectively cleave the CH bond (with limited CC cleavage) at high activity.
2
Moderate concentration of the active sites that activate the CO2 is important in order to avoid large adsorption that could lead to blockage of the sites for CH bond cleavage. Therefore, tradeoff is required, especially when both the propane and CO2 are activated on different active components.
3
Balanced acid-base property. Depending on the nature of the catalyst, CO2 can be activated favorably on acidic sites, however, high acidity is known to be detrimental to olefin selectivity due to difficulty in desorption of generated intermediates. As such, availability of both acidic and basic sites is beneficial to CO2-ODH catalysts, and the acid sites should compose of medium and high strength acid sites.
4
Adequate site isolation is required to limit the sintering of reduced metal species that could suppress the rate of their re-oxidation. In bimetallic catalyst design, enhanced dispersion of the phases is beneficial in interfacial sites formation and their tuning. Moreover, less active component that can act as structural promoter could be utilized to achieve site isolation and suppress formation of large metal ensembles.
5
Synergy among the active components is vital to tune the redox property of the active sites to achieve enhanced mobility of the surface oxygens. In the case of metal oxides with exceedingly high oxygen mobility, non-metallic dopants could be used to regulate the redox property. However, for low reducible oxide catalysts, suitable metal promoter could be used to improve the redox property. Rapid redox cycle in creating oxygen vacancy as a result of CH activation and facile refilling of the vacancies with selective oxygen species via CO2 activation is crucial to improved CO2-ODHP performance.
6. Process design and improvement
In addition to rational catalyst design and tuning, efficient reactor design and process improvement are indispensable in enhancing the overall efficiency of the CO2-mediated oxidative dehydrogenation processes (CO2-ODH) for olefin production. Obviously, significant research efforts should be adequately deployed to pursue these two aspects. The following subsections provides some useful insights on the various potential alternatives to improve and alleviate some of the inherent technological challenges that constrained the CO2-ODH processes.
6.1. Integration of chemical looping with CO2-ODH
Despite the promising advantage of CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH), the route is highly endothermic in nature. This presents additional challenge in the industrial sustainability of the process, because, the heat demand is likely to be met via burning of fossil fuels which releases considerable CO2 emission into the atmosphere. Innovative engineering solutions are crucial in this regard. Incorporating chemical looping combustion is highly promising in improving the CO2-ODH performance dramatically. The strategy provides the opportunity to decouple the CO2-ODH into stepwise oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) route and subsequent site regeneration in a different unit within the process, and each unit could be operated at different condition. Compared to co-feeding of the reactants (light alkane and CO2), the CL−CO2-ODH, offers more versatility to improve the olefin selectivity, since the ODH is facilitated purely on lattice oxygens of metal oxide catalysts. However, development of highly selective, chemically and thermally stable oxygen carriers which are environmentally benign and less susceptible to sintering remains the bottleneck. Most recently, Jeong et al. exemplified the CL−CO2-ODH on a prototype Fe(x)/TiO2 and they achieved 9.7 % and 91 % ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity, respectively [133]. The evolution of new trigonal FeTiO3 phase in the oxygen carrier conferred excellent redox property on the oxide, and that ensured rapid sites regeneration in CO2 stream (2FeTiO3 +CO2 ↔ Fe2O3 + 2TiO2 + CO). Notably, CeO2 may equally serve as excellent support in development of oxygen carriers [134]. Several metal oxide catalysts have been discussed for chemical looping coupled with ODH (with air regeneration) elsewhere [199]. Wu et al. have screened various metal oxides via thermodynamic investigation for potential CL-ODH application [200].
On another perspective, integrating the ODH process with chemical looping technology provides not only a unique alternative to improve propylene yield and stability [200], but can also resolve the energy demand of the process through thermal integration. Notably, the recent works of Ruthwik et al. proposed a novel eco-friendly design that integrates the ODH−CO2 of propane with chemical looping combustion (CLC-ODH−CO2) via thermodynamic simulation [201]. The schematic representation of the CLC-ODP − CO2 is depicted on Fig. 15. The authors [201] revealed that 79.1 % propylene yield is attainable, and the heat demand and the CO2 requirement of the ODH−CO2 process can be met essentially through thermal integration of the hot depleted air stream from the CLC catalyst regeneration reactor and produced CO2 from the CLC fuel rector, respectively. Besides, recovery of the excess heat from the exit stream of the ODHP−CO2 reactor could potentially be utilized for power generation.

6.2. Innovative engineering and reactor concepts
Obviously, most of the reported literature on CO2-ODH were carried out in packed bed reactors (PBR) and PBRs constitute a largest portion of industrially operated reactors. One of the approach to improve their performance for CO2-ODH is via the use of novel engineering concept. Detailed computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulation could provide additional insights on the alternative improvement methods. Noteworthy, the research in CO2-ODH is generally at the nascent stage, but many concepts that have been exemplified in oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) could be adapted due to striking similarity in their nature, despite OCM being favoured on lattice oxygens with electrophilic character. Typically, catalyst bed arrangement to comprise of highly active catalysts as preheating zone followed by a less active but highly selective bed may potentially improve the overall CO2-ODH performance. In addition, a hybrid bed achieved with mortar mixing of two or more catalysts can also be explored. Beside the focus to improve olefin yield, novel reactor configuration may probably help in the heat demand of the process. One of the possible alternative is application of dual-reactor concept via coupling CO2-ODH reactor with another reactor operated for a highly exothermic reaction such as the OCM. The reactors could be coupled through heat integration, where a network of fluidized OCM reactors can probably be immersed in large packed bed CO2-ODH reactor [202], or series of OCM reactors and CO2-ODH reactors can be thermally coupled with multistage feeding/removal of reactants/ products [203]. The proposed options may probably help to meet up with the heat requirement of the CO2-ODH and equally ensure adequate heat management for the OCM without the utilization of expensive cooling system. Alternatively, packed bed membrane reactor technology may be utilized to couple the CO2-ODH and OCM with the help of suitable dual function catalysts [204].
6.3. Alternative source of heating
In gas phase heterogeneous reactions over solid catalysts, the presence of complex interplay between the catalytic surface reactions and the unselective gas-phase homogeneous routes can place an upper temperature limit to the conversion-selectivity tradeoff achievable catalytically. Even with the most efficient catalyst, raising the operating temperature beyond that upper limit to achieve higher conversion will be accompanied with profound decline in selectivity of desired product. Microwave heating (MWH) can offer preferential heating that could result in substantial gas-solid temperature gradient [205], and that could be utilized to deconvolute the complex interplay. Recently, Ramirez et.al exemplified this concept in CO2-mediated ODH of isobutane over V/Al2O3 [78]. Fig. 16a depicts the comparison of the gas-solid temperature gaps for different solid-phase temperatures under conventional (VH) and microwave heating (MW). Obviously, the MW heating can ensure lower gas phase temperature relative to the temperature of the solid catalyst at the same operated temperature. As depicted on Fig. 16b, the controlled MW heating brought about significant improvement in the isobutylene selectivity compared to conventional heating. The MW heating enabled direct heating of the solid catalyst and provided lower gas phase temperature that suppressed the undesired homogeneous routes which normally favor cracked products and COx. Most recently, the authors also demonstrated this approach in ODH of propane under oxygen atmosphere, and they reported an outstanding performance (21 % conv., 70 % propylene select.) over VMgO catalyst (having low MW absorbance) [206]. The VMgO was coupled with SiC monolith as the microwave susceptor. Obviously, the MW heating provides a powerful alternative to boost catalytic selectivity of desired products in processes that are critically overwhelmed by undesired gas-phase chemistry at elevated temperatures, and its application in heterogeneous catalysis is on the increase [205,207,208].

7. Challenges and perspectives
The development of efficient catalysts with high catalytic activity that can selectively convert feedstock such as light alkanes (C1-C4), isobutane, ethylbenzene and others into desired products through oxidative dehydrogenation routes has remained a grand challenge in heterogeneous catalysis. The processes are highly prospective, and the utilization of CO2 as soft oxidant in such processes provides dual advantage of synthesizing vital platform chemicals without H2 input and potentially mitigating CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. As promising sustainable technologies, once these CO2 utilization alternatives are improved to an economically viable level, they can easily be integrated along with other processes in the chemical industry. Obviously, the research interest in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) of light alkanes and other feedstock will be sustained for the next decades until the processes are fully developed. This is deeply motivated by the vision for circular carbon economy (CCE) coupled with the great prospect in feedstock sustainability. Currently, there is a large abundance of shale gas and associated petroleum gas in the United States and the Middle East, respectively.
The commercialization and industrialization of the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) of light alkanes not only require development of efficient catalysts, significant progress in terms of reactor development and process optimization are indispensable. In addition, the exploration of better alternatives to meet up the energy requirement of the processes through renewable energy sources coupled with the concern to leverage the cost of carbon capture and separation are other major challenges. Process integration can potentially provide vital alternatives in meeting up with the energy requirement. Typically, the recent works of Ruthwik et provided great insight and inspiration in this regard [201]. The authors demonstrated potential integration of chemical looping combustion (CLC) with ODH−CO2, the heat demand and the CO2 requirement of ODH−CO2 process can be met essentially through thermal integration and the produced CO2 from the CLC fuel rector, respectively. Moreover, recovery of the excess heat from the exit stream of ODH−CO2 reactor could potentially be channeled for power generation.
Notably, the active sites for different catalytic systems might be uniquely different, and could facilitate the CO2-ODH via different mechanisms. Thus, unravelling the unique structural and compositional nature of the active sites involved in various the CO2-ODH reactions presents another formidable challenges. Typically, powerful and highly robust techniques such as in situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR), in situ FTIR spectroscopy, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and in situ UV − vis spectroscopy coupled with DFT calculations can effectively help to understand and reveal the dynamic evolution of the sites and the reaction intermediates [209,210]. Synthesis methods such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) that allow for atomic-level precision in controlling the distribution of active sites could be utilized to develop model catalysts [211]. These model catalysts can facilitate the elucidation of CO2-ODH reactions mechanisms and establishment of better structure-property relationships. Besides, potential CO2-ODH catalysts for industrial application should have high catalytic activity, high selectivity to desired product (olefins), high stability with time on stream (TOS), and should be cost-effective and environmentally benign. Obviously, the space for catalyst discovery and optimization are inherently very wide, as such, accelerated catalyst discovery techniques (such as machine learning integrated with high-throughput experimentation and calculations) should be vigorously deployed to expedite the design and tuning of CO2-ODH catalysts. Moreover, rigorous CFD modelling coupled with 3D printing can potentially augment in efficient optimization of catalyst structure (in terms of heat and mass transport), and that can pave way for scaling up of lab-scale CO2-ODH catalysts to industrial application.
Furthermore, the possibility of occurrence of a complex interplay between surface catalytic routes and gas phase homogeneous routes during CO2-ODH presents another great challenge in promoting olefin selectivity. Ramirez et al. demonstrated that controlled microwave (MW) heating can be effectively utilized to promote the olefin selectivity via establishment of significant gas-solid temperature gradient that will limit the rate of the non-selective gas phase reactions [206]. In addition, photochemical [212] and electrochemical reactors could also be explored deeply to enhance the yield of olefins in CO2-ODH in order to circumvent the challenge of conversion-selectivity tradeoff that is mostly encountered in conventional gas phase reactors, especially at elevated temperatures. Besides, techno-economic analysis of the CO2-ODH processes is lacking, and it is indispensable in achieving efficient tradeoff between the overall catalytic performance, life cycle assessment and the economics of the processes prior to piloting and commercialization. Despite all the challenges, the prospects of the CO2-ODH processes in potentially bringing a paradigm shift in the petrochemical industry will continue to sustain research efforts in the area.
In summary, this review has discussed diverse catalyst design and tuning strategies that can potentially improve the different CO2-meadiated oxidative dehydrogenation (CO2-ODH) processes for olefin production. The catalytic requirement for effective CO2 activation and selective CH bond activation strongly guided the design strategies. Obviously, Cr- and V-based catalysts are the most explored, and incorporation of small amount of noble metals (such as Ru and Pd) as effective CO2 activators or addition of highly reducible oxides such as Ce can significantly improve their performances. In addition, mixed oxide supports with excellent redox ability such as CeZrAl have demonstrated to be excellent candidate supports, and incorporation of V and noble metals can render CO2-ODH catalysts with high stable performance. Moreover, bimetallic design exemplified with Fe along with either Ni, Co, and Pd phases over highly reducible ceria support is highly promising due ease of interfacial sites tunability. Most importantly, the electronic character of the interfacial oxygens is decisive; with electron-rich (nucleophilic) and electron-deficient (electrophilic) oxygens facilitating selective CH activation and CC cleavage, respectively. To stimulate further progress in development of efficient catalysts that could prompt the commercialization and industrialization of the CO2-ODH processes, the following research directions are proposed:
1
Complementary characterization techniques under in situ or operando mode and DFT calculation should be effectively utilized to gain further insights on the structural and compositional nature of active sites of various catalytic systems and reaction intermediates involved in CO2-ODH reactions.
2
Both mechanisms of CO2-ODH reactions and catalyst deactivation should be probed further to reveal other additional catalytic requirements that can guide in rational design and tuning of catalysts.
3
Diverse bimetallic catalyst designs with tuned composition and structure should be explored further in developing potential CO2-ODH catalysts. The concept offers unique avenue in tuning interfacial active sites effectively. In addition, less active metals could also be incorporated to offer site isolation, and such design strategy may probably expand the realm of CO2-ODH to mimic single atom catalysis. It is noteworthy that single atom catalysis will continue to shape the perspective of researches in heterogeneous catalysis, and CO2-ODH should not be an exception.
4
Accelerated catalyst discovery techniques should be deployed to expedite screening and design of novel CO2-ODH catalysts coupled with establishment of robust property-activity relationships.
5
Novel reactor designs and engineering concepts should be explored to further offer efficient conversion-selectivity tradeoff and suppress the contribution of homogeneous gas-phase routes, especially at higher temperatures. Integration of chemical looping (CL-ODH) concepts with the CO2-ODH is highly prospective, and more CFD and thermodynamic modelling of the concepts should be investigated to alleviate other technological challenges inherent in the process.
