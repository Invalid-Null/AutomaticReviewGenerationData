 Based on my analysis, the supplied document does not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

The document is a technoeconomic analysis comparing different pathways for producing isopropanol, including from propane, but does not go into details about specific catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on process simulation, design and economic evaluation of the different routes. Since there is no discussion of propane dehydrogenation catalysts and their performance, I do not have any relevant information to extract about catalyst composition, conversion, selectivity, stability, etc.
