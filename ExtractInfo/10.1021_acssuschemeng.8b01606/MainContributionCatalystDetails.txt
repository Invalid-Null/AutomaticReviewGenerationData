 Unfortunately, the provided extractions do not contain enough detailed information to populate the full XML template. The documents seem to focus on techno-economic analysis of isopropanol production pathways, without going into specifics on propane dehydrogenation catalysts.

Since there are no catalyst names, compositions, performance metrics, etc provided, I cannot synthesize a comprehensive summary. The most relevant information I can extract is:

<output>
<Relevance>No</Relevance> 
</output>

The documents discuss propane dehydrogenation at a high level as part of the isopropanol production process, but do not provide in-depth catalyst details. Without more technical information on the catalysts, I cannot populate the different sections of the XML output. Please provide documents with more specific PDH/ODH catalyst data to enable a complete summary extraction.
