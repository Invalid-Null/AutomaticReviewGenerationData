Abstract
In industry, H-type zeolites are usually synthesized under hydrothermal conditions in the sodium-containing system, in which great deal of ammonia nitrogen wastewater will be produced during the transformation of zeolites from Na-type to H-type. In this work, we prepared ZSM-5 zeolites in the sodium-free system using organic amines in a rotating packed bed (RPB), which can greatly reduce the amount of wastewater. It was found that the ZSM-5 zeolites synthesized by isopropanolamine (MIPA) had the highest acid amount with a value of 2.331 mmol/g compared to that by other three amines, and exhibits the highest conversion of benzaldehyde with a value of 77.63% in the acetal reaction of benzaldehyde and ethylene glycol. More importantly, RPB premixing can improve the transfer of Al into the framework of ZSM-5 zeolites relative to conventional stirring technique. This work provided a new route to prepare ZSM-5 zeolites with high acid amount in sodium-free system.

1. Introduction
ZSM-5 zeolites have been widely employed in the petrochemical industry owing to its excellent catalytic performance. For most reactions catalyzed by ZSM-5 (eg. aromatization [1], alkylation reaction [2] methanol-to-aromatics reaction (MTA) [3], dehydrogenation reaction [4] methanol-to-gasoline (MTG) [5,6]), the active center is Brønsted or Lewis acidity, located on Al sites. In industry, ZSM-5 usually synthesis via hydrothermal method in the sodium-containing system, following by the transformation of zeolites from Na-type to H-type using NH4+-exchange, due to its low cost, easy operation, and process controllability. This process also exhibits the advantages of easy formation of [AlO4]− caused by Na+, which is beneficial for its catalytic performance [7,8]. However, a large amount of ammonia nitrogen wastewater will be produced during this process. Therefore, it is desired to develop a green synthesis strategy of H-type ZSM-5 zeolites without alkali metal cations and NH4+-exchange treatment.
Bibby et al. [9] have successfully synthesize H-ZSM-5 using ammonium hydroxide without any alkali metal cations, they used NH3·H2O as alkali source, and found that when Na+ is replaced by NH3·H2O, the reaction rate is extremely low and a trace amount of Na+ (−0.01%) must be used to catalyze the reaction. Ryoo et al. [10] used diammonium-type bromide surfactant and sodium free silicon source to synthesize zeolites. Instead of converting the surfactant to the hydroxyl form, the alkalinity of the synthetic mixture was adjusted by adding the readily available N(CH3)4OH. Hou et al. [11] further explored the influences of the concentration of NH4+, SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio on the product morphologies and crystallization rates. In aqueous solution, NH4+ ions have weak interaction with surrounding water molecules, resulting in a "hydration structure" [12]. Aluminosilicate anions will be attracted by NH4+ and reduce their contact with TPA+, thus inhibiting crystal nucleation and growth. Xue et al. [13] adopted relatively extensive tetrapropylammonium hydroxide with a TPA+/SiO2 mole ratio of 0.35, to prepare NH4-ZSM-5, and added silica as seed to control the particle sizes [14,15]. Sang et al. found that types of organic templates in the sodium-containing system affect the acid amount of ZSM-5 zeolites [16]. Generally, in the sodium-free system, Al is difficult to enter the ZSM-5 framework due to the absence of alkali metal cations, which causes the decrease of acid centers of ZSM-5. Therefore, seed guidance or extensive templates are often needed in the sodium-free system. Because Na+ can promote the formation of [AlO4]− structure by improving the reaction activity [17]. Without Na+, Si-O-Al structure needs higher energy for bonding. Therefore, how to realize the uniform dispersion of template agent in the system and reduce the reaction activation energy are the keys to realize the preparation of high-performance ZSM-5 zeolites by the sodium-free synthesis process.
Rotating packed bed (RPB), as an efficient process intensification device, which can improve micromixing efficiency, has been widely applied in synthesis nanomaterials [18], [19], [20]. Our group [21] reported that RPB can accelerate the nucleation/crystal growth process by enhancing the micromixing and creating abundant tiny bubbles to lower the energy barrier of nucleation [22,23].
Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel process to prepare HZSM-5 zeolites in the sodium-free system using RPB. We screened out isopropanolamine (MIPA) for the sodium-free system among four organic amines, and adopted RPB to enhance the nucleation and impel Al into the framework. Furthermore, the synthesized ZSM-5 samples were adopted to catalyze the acetal reaction of benzaldehyde and ethylene glycol to characterize their catalytic performance [24].
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals
Aluminum isopropoxide was purchased from Beijing Bailingwei Technology Co., Ltd. Silica sol (40 wt% aqueous solution) was purchased from Qingdao Jiyida silica reagent factory. Diethanolamine (DEA), benzaldehyde and ethylacetate were purchased from Aladdin Co., Ltd. Ethylene glycol and cyclohexylamine (CHA) were purchased from Shanghai McLean Biochemical Technology Co., Ltd. Monoethanolamine (MEA) was purchased from Sigma-aldrich Trading Co., Ltd. Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 25 wt% aqueous solution) was purchased from Shanghai Shaoyuan Co., Ltd. Ammonia solution (25 wt%) was purchased from Fuchen (Tianjin) chemical reagents Co., Ltd. Monoisopropanolamine (MIPA) was purchased from Rhawn Co., Ltd.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
ZSM-5 samples were hydrothermally synthesized with the gel composition of 1.33Al2O3: 200SiO2: 30TPAOH: 190X: 4500H2O (X: monoethanolamine, isopropanolamine, diethanolamine or cyclohexylamine, denoted as ZSM-5-MEA, ZSM-5-MIPA, ZSM-5-DEA and ZSM-5-CHA, respectively). As shown in Fig. 1, the Al source comprising 0.0026 mol Al(OPri)3, 2.48 mol H2O, 0.03 mol TPAOH solution and 1.9 mol organic amine, was prepared at room temperature with a stirring speed of 700 r/min for 1.5 h to obtain a fully hydrolyzed solution. While the silica source contained 30.04 g (0.2 mol) silica sol. The two sources were simultaneously pumped into RPB with 60 °C water bath for pre-mixing using two peristaltic pumps, respectively. After feeding, the initial gel was circulated between RPB and STR with a flow rate of 608 mL·min-1 for 30 min. The obtained gel was then poured into 100 mL Teflon®-lined autoclave for crystallization, where the gel was static aging at 120 °C for 24 h and static crystallized at 170 °C for 16 h. And then, samples were washed by deionized water four times, following with drying at 120 °C for 12 h and calcining at 550 °C for 5.5 h to remove the template. By comparing the amount of NH4Cl solution used for ammonium exchange in a conventional preparation process and the weight of ZSM-5 zeolite synthesized in a conventional preparation process, we calculated that producing 1 ton of ZSM-5 zeolites can reduce the generation of 15.15 ton of ammonia nitrogen wastewater.

2.3. Characterization
XRD patterns of the samples were recorded on an XRD-6000 diffractometer (Shimadzu Inc.) using Cu Ka radiation (40 kV, 40 mA), in the 2θ range from 5 to 90 °, with a step size of 0.02 ° and a counting time of 10 s per step. Morphology and particle size of samples were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Tescan). FT-IR spectroscopic analyses were carried out with pressing potassium bromide troche (with a mass ratio of 1/100) on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (Nicolet Instrument Co., USA) to analyze the formation amount of [AlO4]− during the crystallization. The textural properties of samples were characterized on a Quantachrome surface area analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2460 3.01). The pore size distributions were calculated by Barrett-Joyner-Halenda method from the desorption branch of the isotherm. The Si/Al molar ratios were determined on an inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES, Agilent 5800). The high-resolution 27Al MAS NMR characterizations were used to analyze the Al amount in framework and extra-framework of samples, and then samples were carried out on a Bruker AVANCE III 600 spectrometer equipped with a 4 mm standard bore probe head. NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments were conducted on a chemisorption AutoChem II 2920 analyzer with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for analyzing surface acid properties of samples. A 100 mg sample was pretreated under Helium at 300 °C for 1 h and then saturated under a gas mixture with 10% ammonia and 90% helium at 50 °C for 1 h. Afterward, the sample was kept in He flow stream for 1 h to remove physically adsorbed ammonia, followed by heating to 700 °C with a rate of 10 °C/min in He (30 mL/min). The Brønsted and Lewis acid amounts of samples were measured by Pyridine-adsorbed FT-IR spectra using Tensor 27 instrument. During this process, samples are pressed into the self-support sheet and placed in the in-situ chamber of the infrared spectrometer. The treated samples were vacuumized to 10−3 Pa at 400 °C for 1 h to remove the gas molecules adsorbed on the sample surface, and then cooled to room temperature. Then pyridine vapor was introduced into the in-situ chamber, followed by heating samples to a certain temperature and vacuuming again to 10−3 Pa, keeping for 30 min, and cooling to room temperature. Finally, the infrared spectra of pyridine adsorption were recorded.
2.4. Catalytic performance
In the acetal reaction of benzaldehyde and ethylene glycol, 29.71 g benzaldehyde, 26.07 g ethylene glycol, 16.83 g cyclohexane, and 500 mg catalyst are added in a 250 ml three-necked round bottom flask which was equipped with a water segregator, a reflux condenser and a magnetic agitator. The reaction was carried out under continuous stirring at 120 °C for 90 min. The obtained products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC) with an SE-30 column. The conversion of benzaldehyde was defined as follows:

The morphological properties and yield of four ZSM-5 samples are shown in Fig. 3, and the particle size distributions are shown in Fig. 4. All ZSM-5 samples exhibit spherical morphologies with rough surface, but show different particle size distributions. It is notable that ZSM-5-CHA has a larger particle size compared with other prepared samples. While ZSM-5-DEA has wider particle size distribution than other prepared samples, which may be resulted from the secondary nucleation which allows smaller crystals to be deposited on the original crystal, but their original form has not change [16]. It also shows that the particle size distribution of ZSM-5-MEA and ZSM-5-MIPA are narrower than other two products, but the average particle size of ZSM-5-MIPA is smaller. Moreover, the four ZSM-5 samples show good spherical morphology, with a small usage of TPA+, indicating that RPB premixing can reduce the usage of template in this organic ammonia synthesis process. To sum up, MIPA has a better performance in controlling the particle size of zeolites, zeolites with uniform size and average particle size of 1.51 μm with rough surface were synthesized by MIPA.

In order to observe the formation and growth of structural units in the crystal nucleation, FT-IR was used to characterize the samples at different crystallization times. The samples were prepared using the experimental conditions described in 2.2. During the crystallization process, the samples were collected every 2 h. Initially, the precursor gradually became turbid, but no solid products were formed. After 6 h, a small amount of particle appears. Then samples were conducted at intervals of 1 h after crystallization for 8 h. As shown in Fig. 5, the band at 530–560 cm−1 is indicative of D5-ring units, which is caused by the secondary structural units in the MFI-type structure. It is noteworthy that the peak near 550 cm−1 shifts to the left and became sharp with a long crystallization time more than 8 h, indicating that the SiO4 tetrahedra in D5-ring is constantly replaced by the AlO4 tetrahedra, which means Al enter the zeolite framework continuously [25].

Fig.6 shows the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms of four prepared ZSM-5 samples. All the four adsorption isotherms have a similar change trend: a sharp uptakes near P/P0 = 0 is due to the microporous structure; Xing et al. [26] proposed that a tiny hysteresis loop in the region 0.2 < P/P0 < 0.7 is indicative of capillary condensation in the mesopores. Overall, it can be concluded that the pore structure of all four samples is mainly composed of micropore structure.

Fig. 7. Pore size distributions of four ZSM-5 samples obtained by different ammonia source.
Fig. 8 shows the 27Al MAS NMR spectra of the calcined samples. The positions of Al in the zeolites obtained by different ammonia sources are different. Some literatures reported that the framework Al in ZSM-5 zeolite is not distributed randomly, but changes regularly by regulating the synthesis conditions [27]. The two major peaks of ZSM-5 zeolites are located in the region of 45–60 ppm, and 0 ppm, assigned to tetrahedral framework Al (AlF) and extra-framework octahedral Al species (AlEF), respectively [28,29]. The weak peak at 0 ppm was observed for ZSM-5-CHA and ZSM-5-DEA samples, which confirms the presence of a small amount of extra-framework Al in these two samples. In contrast, the other two samples almost have no extra-framework Al. Yokoi et al. [30] reported that in NMR spectra, the proportion of framework Al at the chemical shift δ=54 ppm and δ=56 ppm in different ZSM-5 zeolites was different. By deconvoluting the main peak concerning the tetrahedral Al, six or seven peaks are obtained, as shown in Fig. 9. In 27Al NMR spectra, the chemical shifts of δ=54 and δ=56 represent different Al locations, while the chemical shift of δ=54 corresponds to Al at the intersection of sinusoidal channel and straight channel in ZSM-5 zeolite, and the chemical shift of δ=56 corresponds to Al in sinusoidal and straight channels in ZSM-5 zeolite.

As shown in Table 2, bulk-chemical compositions of ZSM-5 were measured by ICP. The molar ratio of SiO2/Al2O3 for ZSM-5-MIPA is much lower than that for ZSM-5-MEA, ZSM-5-DEA and ZSM-5-CHA, 27Al MAS NMR spectra results show that the Al in ZSM-5-MIPA samples is basically framework Al (AlF), which are considered as acidic sites, indicating that MIPA facilitates the formation of framework Al (AlF), and thus improves the amount of acidic site in ZSM-5.

The surface acid properties of the four ZSM-5 samples were investigated by NH3-TPD and pyridine FT-IR experiments. As shown in Fig. 10, all ZSM-5 samples have two NH3 desorption peaks at 100–200 °C and 500–550 °C, which correspond to weak acid sites and strong surface acid sites, respectively [26,31]. The acid amount and acid strength of samples are reflected by peak area and peak position of the TPD profile, respectively [21]. The weak peaks around 500 °C indicate that there are a few strong acids in all the four samples, but the main peaks between 100 °C and 200 °C indicate that most of them are weak acid and the amount of weak acid is shown in Table 3. Due to the small proportion of central peak area of strong acid, the amount of total acid of ZSM-5 samples is determined by the amount of weak acid. The weak acid amount of ZSM-5-MIPA sample is significantly higher than that of other samples, which is consistent with the ICP results. Moreover, the desorption temperature of ammonia from the weak acid sites shifts to higher temperatures for ZSM-5-MIPA/MEA, indicating the increase of acid strength in ZSM-5-MIPA/MEA [32].

Fig. 11, Fig. 12 shows that zeolite prepared by RPB premixing has a larger peak area in NH3-TPD compared with that by STR premixing, indicating that RPB premixing can effectively promote Al growth into zeolites framework. Consequently, the acid amount of ZSM-5-MIPA prepared by RPB premixing is up to 2.331 mmol/g, which is 80.7% higher than that by STR premixing. Moreover, compared with data presented in the literature, the total acid amount is increased 10–20 times under the same SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio [33], [34], [35].

The pyridine FT-IR results are shown in Fig. 13. The stretching bands at around 1540 and 1450 cm−1 are ascribed to Brønsted (B) and Lewis (L) acid sites, respectively [36]. The peaks near 1490 cm −1 can be attributed to the pyridine species interacting with B and L acid sites [37]. As shown in Fig. 13, the quantities of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites were calculated from the Py-IR spectra. The acid sites at 200 °C and the remaining acid sites at 350 °C correspond to the total and strong acid sites, respectively[37]. Compare to ZSM-5-DEA and ZSM-5-CHA, both ZSM-5-MEA and ZSM-5-MIPA exhibit lower B/L ratios, and possesses more Lewis acid sites. While the latter two samples have little difference in the amount of Brønsted acid sites at 200 °C (Table 4). Moreover, for all ZSM-5 samples, the amount of L acid sites decreases obviously with the increasing temperature, indicating that most of L acid sites is weak acid sites. In contrast, most of B acid sites is strong acid sites [38,39].

3.2. Effect of RPB operating conditions
Fig. 14 shows the average particle size and yield of ZSM-5 samples at different rotating speeds in RPB premixing for 30 min. With the increase of RPB rotating speed, the average particle size of the synthesized sample decreases and the yield increases gradually. The optimal yield of 84.16% was obtained under 2850 rpm. This observation can be attributed that increasing the rotational speed results in a larger shear force of the packing, which efficiently cut the solution into smaller liquid film and droplets, thereby greatly strengthening the micromixing. Consequently, the smaller average particle size of ZSM-5 samples was obtained.

3.3. Catalytic performance
The acetal reaction between benzaldehyde and ethylene glycol can be used as a probe reaction, to test the catalytic performance of the four ZSM-5 samples, which preliminarily reflects the catalytic performance of zeolite [24], as shown in equation. Catalytic results and the amount of product per gram of catalyst are given in Fig. 16. The conversion of benzaldehyde by the ZSM-5-MEA ZSM5-MIPA, ZSM-5-DEA and ZSM-5-CHA are 66.11%, 77.63%, 57.25% and 56.35% for 1.5 h, respectively. And the conversion of benzaldehyde increase obviously with decreasing SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratios. As discussion above, four samples possess similar pore structure. Therefore, the good catalytic performance of ZSM-5-MIPA could be ascribed to acidic sites of zeolite induced by different amount of framework Al in the ZSM-5, which is consistent with the reported findings [24,40].

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, this work developed a novel route for the synthesis of ZSM-5 zeolites without Na+ using RPB premixing process. Compared with other organic amines, the ZSM-5 samples prepared by MIPA have smaller and uniform particle size distribution, larger specific surface area, and more Al in the ZSM-5 zeolite framework in the sodium-free system, which has higher acid amount and stronger acidity, more Lewis acid sites. In addition, the micromixing enhanced by RPB is also conducive to the entry of Al into the framework. Furthermore, compared with the traditional sodium-containing synthesis method, the preparation of ZSM-5 zeolite by RPB premixing sodium-free method has great advantages of reduce in the cost of raw materials, because this method reduces the use of template and avoids the NH4+-exchange step. Moreover, the ZSM-5 samples prepared by MIPA were used in the reaction of benzaldehyde and ethylene glycol acetal, and good catalytic performance was obtained. This synthesis route for the preparation of ZSM-5 zeolites possesses promising potential in industrial application.

7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
