The document discusses oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) using carbon nanotube (CNT) catalysts. It does not discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) without an oxidizing agent. Since the document does not pertain to PDH, I have indicated that it is not relevant and did not include any additional information.
