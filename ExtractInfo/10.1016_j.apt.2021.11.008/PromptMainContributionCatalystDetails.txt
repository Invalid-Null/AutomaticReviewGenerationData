Abstract
Using promoters in different types of catalysts can positively affect the yield of oxidative dehydrogenation process and the selectivity of propylene as the main product Titania nanotubes containing distinct promoters including silver, nitrogen and cerium have been synthesized with high specific area by the hydrothermal technique and used as a support in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The incipient wetness impregnation method was applied for catalysts preparation Mo/Ce-TNT, Mo/Ag-TNT and Mo/N-TNT were characterized by various techniques such as XRD, TEM, SEM, EDS, BET, H2-TPR. The presence of these promoters lead to enhancement of propylene yield among which the Mo/Ce-TNT catalyst was of great efficiency. From the results, it is considered to be quite evident that the oxygen capacity of the catalyst containing Ce can contribute to the oxidation state and redox reactions. In comparison to Mo/TNT, the yield to propylene in the Mo/Ce-TNT sample increased from 9.3% to 14.8% and propylene selectivity substantially surged from 39% to 66.3%.

1. Introduction
One of the major building blocks in the petrochemical industries is propylene. In the present day, olefins are manufactured by various strategies including methanol to olefins, steam cracking, catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons, oxidative coupling of methane, etc.[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Indeed careful consideration must be done about process barriers like an endothermic process, high temperatures, operation energy consumption, thermodynamic limitations, accelerated deactivation, and unwanted side reaction beside coke formation [7], [8], [9]. Taking all these predicaments into consideration, there is a need to develop an innovative technology to produce propylene much more effectively. To tackle these obstacles, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) over various catalysts is being developed [10], [11], [12], [13].
Performing exothermic ODHP is caused by O2 addition as one of the most attractive alternative procedures at a glance [14], [15], [16], [17]. In comparison to the conventional techniques mentioned, the ODHP requires less energy input. Besides, the existence of oxidants such as O2 in the feed stream certainly to some extent not only can devastate the coke formation but also enhance the stability of catalysts [18]. However, the optimization of propylene selectivity, high yield, and conversion are an ambitious as well as a sophisticated challenge. It is obvious that several process designs and process integrations are conceivable. Thus, developing new catalysts with high propylene selectivity at high propane conversion is clearly indispensable [19], [20]. Calcination temperature, type of supports, active phase content, and using promoters are main factors for improving the catalytic activity and the performance of catalysts [21], [22]. It is said that Mo, V, Cr, and Mg as active sites, TiO2, SiO2, Al2O3, and ZrO2 as supports and K, Nb, Ce, Ni, and Ag as promoters can be used in the ODHP process. It was mentioned that molybdenum catalyst supported on TiO2 is highly active in the ODHP[23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Hiramatsu cited that titanate nanotubes can be synthesized by a hydrothermal as a straightforward, simple, eco-friendly, cost-effective technique in comparison to others [28]. Based on recent experiments, specific oxygen adsorption as well as the relatively low cost of Ag, excellent redox property of cerium oxide in catalytic activities and less phase transformation of nitrogen doping encouraged us to use these materials as promoters [29]. There are various procedures for metal-TNT catalysts preparation such as hydrothermal method [30], sol–gel method [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], impregnation method [36] and so on. In addition, conventional strategies to form N-doped TiO2 are considered to be annealing TiO2 through ammonia gas [37], [38], [39], [40], ion implantation, hydrothermal treatment [41], [42], and hydrolysis of N-containing solutions [43], [44].
Promoters have a key role in increasing active sites during reaction and they facilitate redox reactions which are important for catalyst recovery as well as oxidative dehydrogenation process. In this work, the impact of cerium, silver, and nitrogen addition into molybdenum supported on synthesized TiO2 nanotube were investigated on the ODHP reaction at various temperatures steps.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Hydrophilic titanium dioxide P25 (>99%) was supplied from Degussa. Furthermore, NaOH (>99%), cerium (III) nitrate hexahydrate (>99.5%), silver nitrate (>99.8%), carbamide (CH4N2O) (>99.5%), Nitric acid (>65%) and ammonium hepta-molybdate tetrahydrate (>99.5%) were purchased from Merck Company. These precursors were used as received without further purification.
2.2. Nanocatalysts preparation and procedures
In this work nanotube was prepared by the hydrothermal method. Generally, 1.14 g of hydrophilic titanium dioxide P25 was added to 100 ml of 10 M aqueous solution of NaOH and the mixture was stirred for 30 min. After stirring the mixture, cerium nitrate, silver nitrate and carbamide were added to solution separately to obtain Ce-TNT, Ag-TNT and N-TNT, respectively. The calculated amount of Ce/TiO2, Ag/TiO2, and N/TiO2 molar ratio was 0.5, 0.1 and 0.08, respectively. Then it was sealed in a Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave, set it in an oven at 140 °C for 24 h. After placing the mixture in a centrifuge, 0.1 M nitric acid was used to wash the materials until the pH reached around 1. Then, we use doubly deionized distilled water for washing the precipitate until the acidity of passing water decreased and reached pH 7. The obtained samples were dried for 12 h at 110 °C. The incipient wetness impregnation method was employed for loading 10 wt% Mo over modified titanium nanotubes. For this purpose, a calculated amount of ammonium hepta-molybdate tetrahydrate was added into the mixture containing support and doubly deionized water, in order to prepare Mo/TNT, Mo/Ce-TNT, Mo/Ag-TNT, Mo/N-TNT catalysts. Finally, samples were dehydrated for 12 h at 110 °C. The obtained powders were calcinated in air atmosphere for 3 h at 500 °C.
2.3. Nanocatalysts characterizations
In order to study X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts and their structures, a Philips PW1840 diffractometer made by Netherland using Kα radiation of Cu (λ Kα = 0.178897˚A) in 40 kV and 30 mA was employed with 2θ range from 10° to 80° and a scan size of 0.02°. The morphology of synthesized nanocatalysts were studied using a scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SIGMA VP-500, Germany with an analytical system for energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) through Oxford instrument to confirm the presence of Ag, Ce, N and Mo species. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, Zeiss EM 900 microscope) was utilized to examine the morphology of the prepared catalysts. The BET surface areas of the samples were measured by N2 adsorption/desorption at −196 °C (CHEMBET-3000) with a ten point-isotherm. The samples were degassed for 2 h at 200 °C prior to nitrogen adsorption. The H2-Temperature Programmed Reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were carried out using Quantachrome CHEMBET-3000 apparatus in order to investigate the reducibility of synthesized samples.
2.4. Nanocatalysts performance test
The catalytic activity of samples in the ODHP reaction was investigated in a fixed-bed reactor (Fig. 1). The external diameter, internal diameter and length of quartz reactor are 7 mm, of 6 mm and of 50 cm, respectively. When the catalyst bed was heated by an electric furnace, the temperature of fixed-bed quartz reactor was controlled by a thermocouple type K. For each cycle, the mixture of 100 mg of catalyst and silicon carbide was used to have better thermal spreading of the samples. Subsequently, a mixture of air and propane was provided into the reactor bed. Separate flow of propane and oxygen with molar ratio of C3H8/O2 equal to 1 was mixed by mass flow controller (MFC) until the flow rate reached 100 sccm. In each activity test, the system was allowed to reach steady state condition for about 1 h. The products were passed through a condenser and the non-condensable gaseous products were analysed by a GC apparatus (Varian-CP3800) equipped with a SCION-Al2O3/Na2SO4 column (50 m × 0.53 mm) and a FID detector. The selectivity and yield of products and the conversion of propane were all assessed as follows:

3. Results and discussions
3.1. Characterization of prepared nanocatalysts
3.1.1. XRD analysis
Obtained results from crystallographic analysis of prepared titanate nanotube and different catalysts are shown in Fig. 2. The synthesized TNT showed peaks at 10.66°, 24.22°, and 43.63°. They can be attributed to planes [2 0 0], [1 1 0] and [8 0 0] for H2Ti5O11·H2O structure which is matched with JCDPS file number 44–0131. Recognizing titanate nanotubes and its crystalline structure is of great complexity which can contribute to the small size of nanotubes [45], [46]. Supplementary to this, the specific crystal structure of titanate nanotubes would be ambiguous because of the fact that during calcination process or acid washing as crystal preparation, titanate nanotubes undergo different phase transformations as well as being relatively unstable. Therefore, an entirely new structure is formed. According to reflection peaks observed in Fig. 2-b, the molybdenum oxide species (JCPDS: 00–001-0615) and anatase phase (JCPDS: 01–071-1169) were formed during synthesis of Mo/TNT catalyst. Some low intense peaks can be contributed to few molybdenum oxide crystals (mono and poly molybdate species). There was no detectable rutile phase among relevant peaks. The diffraction peaks of N, Ag and Ce were not detected in the Fig. 2 (c-e), probably due to the low doping amount and fine dispersion. In comparison with the XRD pattern of Mo/Ag-TNT and Mo/Ce-TNT, nitrogen-dopes sample shows that the intensity of anatase peaks which was significantly weakened transformed to rutile, suggesting that the phase transformation of Titania nanotube to rutile in Mo/N-TNT may occur more, relating to disordered layer of nanotubes by nitrogen doping. Adding Ag into catalyst may facilitate the phase transition, surge the density of insufficiency of adequate Ag-TiO2 surface, also the oxygen vacancy of anatase particles increase [47], [48]. Presence of cerium in the catalyst Mo/Ce-TNT resulted in no detectable peaks associating with MoO2 crystalline phase. It is probably due to the fact that particles distribute fine over the TNT surface or the formation of very small crystals cannot be recognized by diffractometer. Unlike the Mo/TNT catalyst, the intensity of the peaks in Mo/Ce-TNT related to anatase phase was of great strength. It can be suggested that transformation of anatase phase into rutile has been substantially reduced due to the presence of cerium. From Fig. 2-e, thus, it can be seen that Ce doping can hinder the conversion of anatase to rutile as well as diminishing the crystallization of the TiO2 nanoparticles, leading to higher thermal stability [49].

3.1.2. SEM and EDS analyses
SEM microphotographs were conducted to study the catalysts morphology. Fig. 3 illustrates the surface morphology of prepared catalysts. According to obtained results, titanium oxide with nanotube morphology was successfully synthesized. The EDS analysis was conducted to investigate the atomic ratio of elements in the catalysts. As can be seen in Fig. 4, the presence of appropriate amount of Ti, Mo, Ce, Ag, O and N in the catalysts’ structures were approved. It is suggested that the impregnation procedure is appropriate for silver, nitrogen, and cerium addition on to the catalysts.

3.1.3. TEM analysis
TEM images of the Mo/TNT, Mo/N-TNT, Mo/Ag-TNT, and Mo/Ce-TNT samples are shown in Fig. 5. It is quite evident that the tubular morphology somehow altered and some nanotubes were broken into nanoparticles. In contrast, the addition of promoters showed different patterns after impregnation and calcination at 500 °C. Although a few nanoparticles are formed, the TNT tubular structure is relatively stable. Fig. 5(b, c, d) illustrates an increase in structural thermal stability after the addition of nitrogen, silver, and cerium into the tubular structure of TNT.

3.1.4. BET analysis
The BET surface area of the catalysts is the given in Table 1. As can be seen the BET surface area of TNT was much higher than TiO2 P25, however after impregnation and calcination process for synthesizing the Mo/TNT sample, its BET surface area substantially declined from 408 to 78 m2/g. Regarding the Mo/TNT catalyst, it was observed that its BET surface area was considerably lower than the synthesized nanotube. Moreover, slight decreases in the surface area of each catalyst were seen by adding promoters. The BET surface area of Mo/N-TNT, Mo/Ag-TNT, and Mo/Ce-TNT reach to 74 m2g−1, 69 m2g−1, 71 m2g−1, respectively. The partial structure degradation of TNT during impregnation and calcination can be one of the most important reasons for surface area loss which in agreement with other researchers’ findings [26], [48].

3.1.5. H2-TPR analysis
Fig. 6 shows catalysts reducibility and it is evident that molybdenum oxide reduces in several steps. The peaks below 600 °C can be attributed to the decrement of monomeric and polymeric molybdenum oxide surface species because of MoO3 reduction to MoO2 and Mo. It can be deduced that the maximum reduction temperature of the monomeric species is slightly lower than polymeric species so the reduction temperature would go up when different molybdenum particles and other promoters coexist. The more polymerization and crystallization occur, the higher the maximum reduction temperature would be [50], [51]. Each promoter has its own TPR peak area and temperature. In comparison to Mo/TNT which had two peaks at 430 °C and 512 °C, the Mo/Ce-TNT had an intense peak at 487 °C with much higher area under its curve (4.84). In contrast, the intense of Mo/N-TNT and Mo/Ag-TNT peaks were remarkably weaker at 437 °C and 512 °C, also the areas under their curve were considerably smaller, 1.24 and 0.58 respectively. It is noteworthy to mention that adding Ce to catalyst positively affected the reducibility of catalyst. In the sample consisting Ce, these reductions seem to be lower than other catalysts which means that Ce particles have stronger interactions and can form more monomeric species [23].

3.2. Comparative performance of nanocatalysts toward oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
The catalytic performance of prepared catalysts in the ODHP was investigated within the 200–500 °C as shown in Fig. 7, Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. The main product was propylene, however carbon dioxide, water, and ethylene were also clearly observed as well. However, their selectivity results were negligible.

3.2.1. Effect of temperature and types of promoters on the propane conversion
Fig. 7 depicts that in spite of exothermic nature of the ODHP reaction, as the reaction temperature increases, propane conversion grows. Thermodynamic analysis of this reaction showed that equilibrium conversion of propane is 100% in 200–500 °C. As can be seen, the Mo/Ce-TNT catalyst showed better results compared to other samples. For instance at 500 °C, the conversion of propane moved upward from 23.8% to 26.3% after adding Ce into catalyst. According to H2-TPR analysis, this can be due to the higher and more intense reduction temperature peak of Mo/Ce-TNT. It facilitated accessibility to oxygen species during the ODHP reaction [52], [53]. The positive effects of Ce doping has been confirmed in other research, as the conversion to V/Ce-TNT reached to 24.2% at 500 °C [50]. On the contrary, there was a 4.6% drop in the ratio of Mo/TNT conversion by N doping, reaching to 19.2% at 500 °C and conversion to Mo/Ag-TNT was almost the same as Mo/TNT during the activity test, except at 500 °C in which this sample experienced a slight fall by 3.3%.
3.2.2. Effect of temperature and types of promoters on the propylene selectivity and yield
As is presented in the Fig. 8, by increasing temperature, propylene selectivity gradually decreased which is followed by an ascent trend of selectivity of COx(CO2, CO). Because of the mechanism of reaction, feed and product (propane and propylene) can be oxidized to CO and CO2 during the ODHP [54], [55], [56]. Additionally, it can be clearly observed that using promoters can have favourable impacts on the selectivity of propylene. The propylene selectivity at 500°Cover the Mo/Ce-TNT, Mo/Ag-TNT, and Mo/N-TNT were 66.3%, 58%, 47% respectively, noticeably higher than the unpromoted catalyst. Conforming to analysis, the accessibility to active sites was made easier in the presence of promoters because of better dispersion. It is also cited that, in the promoted catalysts, absorbed propylene can release much smoother rather than unpromoted catalysts. The low acidity and more basicity of surface can hardly hold propylene as base, thus more and more oxidation is prevented and more propylene is desorbed [48], [57], [58].
Furthermore, the Fig. 9 reveals that there were upward trends for propylene yield of all samples with increasing reaction temperature in the sequence: Mo/Ce-TNT > Mo/Ag-TNT > Mo/N-TNT ≥ Mo/TNT. According to the XRD analyses, the dispersion of monomeric and polymeric species in catalysts was confirmed. In addition, anatase and rutile phase have something to do with activity of catalysts since the capacity for upholding metal oxides species on its surface for each one is different [12], [52], [53]. The catalytic activity of prepared samples was compared with the previous work and results are shown in Table 3. The activity and yields of our samples are higher than those noted in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane supported on TiO2, V/TNT (5.1%) [45], Mo/Rb-TNT (8%), V/K-TNT (10.3%) [48], and Mo/K-TNT(11.3%) [51]. As reported Mo/Ce-TNT is the most promising catalyst with 14.8% yield in our research and the positive effects of adding promoters are crystal clear.
The possible reactions which can occur during oxidative dehydrogenation of propane are listed in Table 2. The Gibbs free energy of mentioned reaction are shown in Fig. 10. As can be seen in this figure, the Gibbs energy of the all reactions is lower than zero. It means that they are favourable in the reaction temperature range.

Mars–Van Krevelen Mechanism is one of the most common mechanistic approaches in catalysis. This mechanism is generally used to describe the kinetics of reactions such as selective oxidation of hydrocarbons (HCs) and is based on the idea that adsorption of one molecule occurs on top of another molecule which had previously been adsorbed. This mechanism is shown in Fig. 11 that reveals the molecule is oxidized by a catalyst and then reoxidized by oxygen. The adsorption occurs by the reaction and after forming the product, desorption step starts. The catalyst should change easily its sate of oxidation cations. Therefore, the oxidation- reduction cycle is very suitable. The oxide metals are used in the selective and active catalysts, because of the fact that the cations of transition metals in metal oxides can change their energy level in a wide range.

4. Conclusions
The doping of promoters including N, Ag and Ce into TNT caused increased thermal stability of TNT. However, catalyst preparation accounted for support surface area loss, mostly because of the calcination. The less structure damage of TNT at calcination temperature of 500 °C is contributed to co-doping. Experimental results including XRD, SEM, EDX, TEM, and TPR illustrate that co-doping can influentially diminish the agglomeration of the TiO2 NPs, restrain the phase transition, lead to more thermal consistency, hindering the rise of the crystallite grains, and its surface area increase. Therefore these promoters have shown substantial influence on the dehydrogenation of propane. In this work, all of the tested catalysts were active, particularly Ce shows much better efficiency compared to N and Ag as promoters and among these catalysts, Ce-MoTNT10 is the most effective catalyst, clearly affect catalyst yield (14.8%), especially at high temperatures in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
