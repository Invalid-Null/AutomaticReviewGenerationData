Fully selective catalytic oxidation of NO to NO2 over most active Ga-PCH catalyst
Abstract
The series of xGa-PCH catalysts were prepared by the impregnation method for low temperature selective catalytic oxidation of NO in the excess of O2 and characterized by N2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, SEM, Py-FTIR, XPS, O2-TPD, and NO-TPD. The experimental study and characterization results were demonstrated that among all the samples, the 24Ga-PCH catalyst was highly active and had superior catalytic properties and never has been reported yet. The 24Ga-PCH catalyst exhibited high catalytic efficiency and 100 % NO oxidation at low temperature (150 °C). The effect of gallium loading, the effect of carriers, influence of O2, temperature and catalytic oxidation of NO with function time-on-stream were studied in detail. Meanwhile, the NO conversion experiment, SEM and Py-FTIR tests indicated that a small amount of gallium oxide on PCH result on considerable improvement in the catalytic performance, because of the higher acidic site and amorphous formation which were beneficial for NO oxidation at low temperature.
1. Introduction
Major air pollutants in the environment such as CO, SOx, NOx, and unburned hydrocarbons from the combustion power plants and stationary sources. The production of nitrogen oxides has more attention due to the play a significant role in acid rain and smog. The nitrogen oxides (NOx) are mainly composed of NO, NO2, N2O and these gases are highly toxic and cause environmental pollutants. In the previous study, the various methods reported for NOx conversions such as three-way catalysis, NO storage reduction (NSR), continuous regeneration trap (CRT) and the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NOx with NH3 and hydrocarbons over different catalysts [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]].
The high acceleration in NOx conversion efficiency by nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and also it is directly related to the mechanism of "fast SCR of NO" [6,7]. The nitric oxide is very less water-soluble than the nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and instantaneous NOx and SOx adsorption is feasible to fluctuate in the flue gas combustion plant [8,9]. Many authors studied that the selective catalytic oxidation of NO plays an important role in the fast selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO by ammonia and hydrocarbons over different metal oxide catalyst [4,10,11]. The Ru rare transition metal was supported on different supports such as TiO2-Anatase, TiO2-Rutile, Al2O3, ZrO2 & SiO2 for investigation of NO oxidation to NO2 [12]. Li at al. [13] prepared the Mn-Ce-Ox series of catalysts with different methods for catalytic oxidation of NO and reported that the 60 % NO conversion at 150 °C. Zhang et al. [14] used different supports (Y2O3, ZrO2, La2O3, Al2O3) with Pt/CeO2-MnOx to study the thermal stability of all different supported samples and reported that oxidation of NO was achieved at high temperature (∼350 °C) after thermal treatment. Wang et al. [15] examined the selective catalytic NO oxidation over Mn, Cr, Co, Fe, and Ni modified CeOx catalysts and found that the Co modified Ce catalyst shown <92 % NO conversion at ∼200 °C. The Mn-Co-Ce oxides catalysts were reported for catalytic oxidation of NO at low temperature in the excess of O2 and showed 80 % NO conversion at 150 °C, but at very narrow temperature ranges [16]. Dawody et al. [17] used alumina support with different metal oxides (MoO3, Ga2O3, WO3, V2O5) with Pt catalyst for the evaluation the influences of metal additives on the catalytic oxidation of NO and found that the ∼85 % NO oxidation at ∼220 °C over MoO3/Pt-Al2O3. The Ga2O3/Pt/Al2O3 catalyst showed ∼70 % NO2 concentration at 300 °C. Haneda et al. [18] reported the ∼20 % NO2 concentration at 400 °C over the Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalyst. Recently, a new method based on the photocatalytic oxidation of NO was proposed additionally, the NO oxidation mechanism was discussed in detail [[19], [20], [21]]. In which NO2 production rate was lower than 50 %. The metal oxide-based catalysts are still a major consideration for NO oxidation. On the other hand, mostly all catalyst shows NO oxidation at very narrow temperature ranges as well as the presence of NO2 formation at high temperature. So it needs to synthesize a new catalyst that shows high catalytic activity at very initial temperature ranges and attain high rate in broad ranges of temperature.
The support of catalyst has a high impact on the NO oxidation and the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) of NO in the excess of oxygen. Xue et al. [22] reported the importance of catalyst support and Pt content on the NO oxidation performance, examined that the SiO2 supported Pt catalyst showed high NO oxidation than ZrO2 and Al2O3 supported catalysts at similar platinum content. Oi-Uchisawa et al. [23] also reported a similar study related to the influence of catalyst support on the NO oxidation to NO2. The porous clay heterostructures (PCH) material has attracted more attention due to the high BET surface area, large pore structure, high thermal stability, low cost and negligible deactivation in the existence of H2O and SO2 [[24], [25], [26]]. Yuan et al. [27] modified that the Fe-PCHs catalyst with Cu, showed 98 % NO conversion at low temperature (350 °C).
The gallium oxide is one of the transparent and large band-gap semiconductor material and it has been applied for SCR catalysts [[28], [29], [30], [31], [32]]. Stepanov et al. [33] proposed that the gallium oxide is highly oxidation material and organic compounds due to high photocatalytic activity and provides high surface sites which could be able to interact more with the environment. Additionally, the gallium oxides catalysts have been reported for the aromatization of propane due to the good capability of activating hydrocarbons species [[34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]]. Zahoranova et al. [40] and Shao et al. [41] also studied that the oxidation state of gallium strongly depends on the material of support and content amount of gallium, and it strongly influences the catalytic activity and the physicochemical properties of the catalyst sample. Schmitz et al. [42] reported the important factors that affect the catalytic oxidation of NO such as catalyst support, metal concentration, and calcination temperature.
In this present work, we prepared the series of xGa-PCH catalysts for NO oxidation to NO2 to provide an update in research work and evaluated the different parameters related oxidation of NO such as the effect of support, temperature, Ga loading, O2 concentration, and catalytic oxidation of NO with the function of time. The surface analysis, oxidation, acidic amount and NO-O2 desorption in the xGa-PCH catalysts were investigated with N2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, SEM, XPS, Py-FTIR, O2-TPD, and NO-TPD.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalyst
The porous clay heterostructures (PCH) synthesis method was reported by Galarneau et al. [43]. The parent montmorillonite (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent, China) clay was used with different reaction conditions and involved several steps in the synthesis of PCH such as, (1) modification of host montmorillonite clay with NaCl, (2) the high cation exchange capacity (CEC) surfactant (hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride) enhance the interlayer spacing and swelling, (3) modified clay was synthesized with dodecylamine (neutral amine) and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) for connections between adjacent layers and produced well-developed porous structures. (4) Then finally modified clay was dried for 12 h at 110 °C and then calcined at 600 °C for 6 h. The xGa-PCH catalyst was prepared by the impregnation method using different gallium concentrations (7, 13, 24, 32 wt%). The 1.5-gram porous clay heterostructures (PCH) was added to 10 ml solution of Ga (NO3)3.9H2O. After 12 h impregnation, the water mixture was evaporated. The catalyst samples were dried for 12 h at 110 °C and finally calcined at 600 °C for 03 h.
2.2. NO oxidation activity measurement
The catalyst activity experiment for NO oxidation was investigated in a vertical fixed-bed reactor (15 mm i.d.). The 0.3-gram catalyst samples were used in each sample testing. The feed gas concentrations were 0.1 % NO, 0 to 6 % O2, balance He and the total flow rate was 200 mL/min. The NO and NO2 gas species data were continuously monitored by an online gas analyzer (ECOM-J2KN, Germany). The catalyst sample was investigated at a certain temperature from 30 to 350 °C, and the heating temperature was controlled by electric furnace programming. The NO and NO2 concentration were recorded every after 10 min from the online gas analyzer. Since the concentration of inlet and outlet of NO was calculated after the steady-state condition in all experiments. The conversion of NO was described as:
Conversion of NO = (NOin ̶ NOout) ⁄ NOin × 100 %.
2.3. Catalyst characterizations
The N2 adsorption-desorption characteristic of the catalysts was measured by ASAP 2460 Micromeritics instrument. The specific surface area, pore diameter and pore volume of the samples were calculated with BET and BJH methods. The test was carried out by cryogenic static capacity method with nitrogen (−196 °C) as the adsorption gas, and the sample was pretreated at 300 °C for 3 h.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) test was used to identify the phase composition and spectra recorded by 18 KW X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku) equipped with Cu Kα (λ = 0.15406 nm) and operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. The catalyst powder was scanned in the range of 10-60° with a rate of 2°/min.
The scanning electron microscope (SEM FEI, Quanta-250) test was carried out to analyze the surface morphology of catalyst with image resolution range from low vacuum mode: ≤ 10.0 nm (3 kV) to high vacuum mode: ≤ 3.0 nm (30 kV) and acceleration voltage were 0.2 ∼ 30Kv.
The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were recorded by Thermo Fisher at 150 W with Al Kα as the X-ray source (hv = 1486.6 eV) to evaluate the surface elements in the catalyst.
The Pyridine-adsorption infrared spectroscopy (Py-FTIR) test was applied to characterize the surface acidity (Lewis & Brønsted acid sites) of the samples. The sample was pretreated at 500 °C for 02 h. During the process of cooling, the background spectrums of the catalysts were collected. After the pyridine probe molecule adsorbed for 20 min, desorptions under vacuum conditions were performed at 40 °C and 300 °C respectively.
The O2-TPD profile, the 2-gram sample was pretreated in a quartz reactor at 350 °C for 60 min with He (50 ml/min) followed by cooling down at room temperature. After the mixture gas 5 %, O2/He (50 ml/min) was introduced for 2 h. After two hours of adsorption was completed, then only pure He was charged. The adsorption profile of O2 was carried out with a heating rate of 5 °C min-1 to 350 °C with the flow of He (50 ml/min). The TCD was used to monitor the O2 desorption.
The NO-TPD tests of NO were conducted by using 2 g of a catalyst sample in the fixed-bed flow reactor. The sample was pretreated with 5 % O2/He gas at 350 °C for 60 min. After sample cooling down to 32 °C then NO (500 ppm) was introduced with He flow (300 mL/min). After two hours adsorption was completed, then flushed by He until no NO was detected in the analyzer. The adsorption profile of NO was carried out with heating the catalyst sample from 30 to 350 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min-1 in the flow of He (300 ml/min). The NO desorption values were continuously monitored by using an online gas analyzer.
3. Experimental result and discussion
3.1. NO oxidation to NO2
The catalytic oxidation of NO to NO2 by 2 % oxygen over PCH and the series of xGa-PCHs catalysts at different gallium concentrations as shown in Fig. 1. It can be seen in Fig. 1 that the ∼20 % NO oxidation to NO2 was achieved over PCH support without gallium loading. The small amount of gallium loading on PCH support was enhanced the catalytic oxidation of NO at low temperatures. The ∼70 to 75 % NO oxidation was noticed, when 7 wt% gallium impregnated on PCH support and the NO has remained nearly about 25–30 % at 150 °C. The 100 % NO conversion to NO2 was achieved at 150 °C with 2 % oxygen over a 24 wt% Ga-PCH catalyst. The NO2 formation was decreased due to the thermodynamic equilibrium (NO2 ⇔NO+1/2O2) with an increased temperature from 150 to 350 °C. The selective catalytic oxidation of NO over xGa-PCH catalyst was kinetically wide-ranging of temperature. However, the NO2 formation did not appear at a high temperature (350 °C) and the remaining small concentration of NO2 convert to NO or N2 over xGa-PCH catalysts. It is also observed that the NO was converted to N2 at high temperature on porous clay heterostructures (PCH) supported catalysts [26,27].

Fig. 1. Oxidation of NO with the function of temperature on a series of xGa-PCH and PCH Reaction conditions: 0.1 % NO, 2 % O2, He balance, catalyst weight =0.3 g and total flow = 200 mL/min).
These results are demonstrated that the addition of gallium oxides on the PCH support enhance the catalytic oxidation of NO and the similar phenomenon reported in previous literature [18,44]. The selective catalytic oxidation of NO is a surface reaction of exothermic, according to this reaction conversion of NO increases firstly to the highest level with the reaction of temperature increasing; however, when temperature of reaction persists to rise, finally conversion of NO drops, which could be because of the accelerated of the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) decomposition reaction [[45], [46], [47]]. As we all know that the properties of any substances are usually find out by a structure in the material world, so the catalytic activity could be manipulated by phase structures of the catalyst sample. It was a remarkable result that the gallium supported on porous clay heterostructures (PCH) exhibited 100 % NO oxidation to NO2 with very low excess of O2 at low temperatures (100 C to 150 °C). It is proposed that PCHs support has a high surface area and lower cost than different metal oxide support catalysts. Additionally, the PCHs based catalyst was highly active for NO conversion at low temperature and it could be a well-suited catalyst for different fossils fuel combustion industries [26,27,48].
3.2. Effect of support and influence of Ga content on NO oxidation
The selective catalytic oxidation of NO over gallium based catalyst was directly depended on the support of catalysts. The comparison of NO oxidation over Ga-PCH catalyst vs Ga2O3-Al2O3 was shown in Table 1. It can be observed from Table 1, the 24 wt% Ga-PCH catalyst had exhibited high NO oxidation efficiency than Ga2O3/Al2O3. Shimizu et al. [44,49] and Shao et al. [41] reported that catalytic activity was highly affected by catalyst support for gallium oxide-based catalysts. Recently, our research group was investigated that clay-based catalyst exhibited high NO reduction at low temperature (300 °C) and better resistance to water and SO2 as comparable to Al2O3, SiO2 and TiO2 supported catalysts [25,26,50].

Fig. 2 shows the NO Oxidation to NO2 efficiency with the function of Ga2O3 loading in the catalysts. The catalytic oxidation was evaluated over xGa-PCH catalysts at different gallium concentration from 7 % to 32 %. It can be seen in Fig. 2, the 24 wt% Ga-PCH catalyst sample showed 100 % NO oxidation at 150 °C and then NO conversion was little decreased with increases of gallium loading. During the experiment, we observed from NO oxidation test that a very small Ga loading was enhanced the catalytic activity and the high catalytic activity could be achieved by controlling the loading of gallium. The high concentration of gallium could promote the secondary reactions, decrease the physical properties of catalysts and no beneficial for catalytic oxidation of NO and similar study on Al2O3 supported Ga2O3 based catalyst reported by Haneda et al. [18,51] and Shimizu et al. [44,49]. On the other hand, increasing the gallium wt% could cause agglomeration of Ga particles and block the porous clay heterostructures (PCHs) pores. Furthermore, Shao et al. [41] reported that the gallium based catalyst depends on the material of support and the gallium content strongly influence the catalytic activity.

3.3. Influence of O2 concentration
The 7 wt% and 24 wt% Ga-PCH catalyst samples were applied to investigate the influence of O2 with a different concentration on the conversion of NO to NO2. Fig. 3 shows the NO oxidation was increased with the very low excess of oxygen (0–1%) over 7 wt% Ga-PCH and 24 wt% Ga-PCH catalyst. Meanwhile, the catalytic oxidation was rapidly increased and stabled when O2 percentage was reached at 2 %. It can be seen in Fig. 3, the ∼70 % NO oxidation was achieved over 7 wt% Ga-PCH and 24 wt% Ga-PCH catalyst showed 100 % conversion of NO to NO2 by 2 % oxygen at 150 °C. Thus, the O2 is a very important factor for the conversion of NO to NO2 or N2 and enhances the rate of reaction. Li et al. [52] reported that the chemisorbed oxygen concentration on the surface of the catalyst plays a significant role in the catalytic reaction.

3.4. NO oxidation at 150 °C with function of time-on-stream
The catalytic oxidation of NO to NO2 by 2 % O2 over 7 wt% and 24 wt% Ga-PCH catalysts were examined with the function of time at 150 °C. It can be seen in Fig. 4, the 7Ga-PCH catalyst showed ∼70 % and 100 % NO2 concentration on 24Ga-PCH catalyst sample at 150 °C, and after ∼3 h the NO2 concentration was started to reduces. The NO2 concentration was declined after some hours due to the inactive concentration of NO and NO2 concentration increases at peak level over both catalysts than it was contributed to the fast raise up of NO and catalytic oxidation of NO which refers to capture the place of the nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The conversion of NO to NO2 directly depends on the O2 % temperature, moisture and time as well as the physicochemical properties of catalyst support [14,41,42].

4. Characterization results of catalysts
4.1. N2 adsorption-desorption
Table 2 illustrates the Ga content, BET surface area, pore volume and pore diameter of the (7 and 24 wt%) Ga-PCH catalyst samples. As shown in Table 2 the BET surface area, pore volume and pore diameter of samples were significantly reduced due to the increases of gallium loading. The addition of gallium contents was decreased the BET surface area due to the blockage of meso- and micropores of PCH support but increased the acidic site concentration in the catalyst and similar results reported in previous literature [48]. The physical characterization of the catalysts illustrated that the pore volume and surface area was not the dominant factors to enhance the catalytic activity. It is found in the previous study, that the catalytic reaction or surface chemistry plays an important function in the catalytic activity of the catalyst than surface area [27,53].

Pore Volume v/(cm3·g‒1) 0.41 0.30
The Ga loading was measured by ICP analysis.
The total surface area was determined from the BET equation.
The pore diameter and pore volume were obtained by the BJH method.
4.2. XRD
The XRD characterization was used to identify the crystalline phases of xGa-PCH catalysts as shown in Fig. 5. The recorded patterns were analyzed by Jade 6 software to identify the phase composition in the catalysts. Fig. 5 shows the two major peaks at 19.8° and 21.9° was represented the two-dimensional (hk) crystal planes of montmorillonite clay. The peaks at 26.6° and 35.4° were attributed to clay impurities of quartz in xGa-PCH catalyst samples [26,54,55]. It can be seen that no proper diffraction peaks were allocated to Ga2O3 in all catalyst samples and indicated a highly amorphous structure. The small peak points at ∼31.8° and ∼35.5° were attributed to γ-Ga2O3 phases and low crystallinity is very common in the γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs, so maybe other phases (α- and β-) also be present [56,57]. It can be seen in the XRD recorded pattern analyses by Jade 6 software, the gallium oxide have found in the whole area of the XRD pattern from 20 to 60° and signifying a complex formation of material [11]. Although the peak intensity was decreased when increases the gallium loading as shown in the XRD pattern of xGa-PCH catalyst samples.

4.3. SEM
The surface morphologies of 7Ga-PCH and 24Ga-PCH samples were investigated by SEM as shown in Fig. 6. The small solid particles were observed on the surface of both catalysts. The increases of gallium contents were promoted the cluster formation and also the surface of the catalyst was converted into less wrinkled structures and the rough formation and following the result of N2 adsorption-desorption such as low surface area and pore volume as shown in Table 2. It can be observed from the SEM image of the 24Ga-PCH catalyst has a loose formation and does not have any regular structure. The distribution of particles was also uneven in the 24Ga-PCH catalyst but the 7Ga-PCH catalyst held a better structure and their distribution of pore size was even better than the 24Ga-PCH catalyst sample. The SEM observation revealed with the results of BET and XRD characterizations and it is concluded with the results of XRD, BET, and SEM, that the high concentration of Ga2O3 could block the pores of PCH support, affect the structural integrity of PCHs, and could produce the highly amorphous structures.

4.4. XPS
Fig. 7(a,b) shows the XPS O 1s scan of 7Ga-PCH and 24Ga-PCH catalyst samples. The XPS spectra was fitted into 2 group bands in the analysis of recorded data deconvolution of both catalysts. The one peak showed at ∼529.2–529.7 eV (Oα), which was attributed to the bonding of Ga-O2- and another peak at ∼532.5–533.3 eV (Oβ) was belonged to adsorbed species of the hydroxyl group (OH) or C/O or defect oxide on the surface of catalyst [[58], [59], [60]]. It is reported that O2 is surely beneficial for catalytic oxidation of NO due to higher mobility [52,58,61]. Zhong et al. [45] reported that the LaNi0.7 Co0.3 catalyst showed better NO oxidation among all the catalysts because of the appropriate amount of O2 adsorbed. The surface oxygen Oβ could adsorb and activate gaseous O2 to form active oxygen species and promote the oxidation of NO to NO2 at low temperature as well as increase the SCR activity. In addition, the lattice oxygen O2-species are also able to adsorb NO to form nitrates. An et al. [62] studied that the selective catalytic oxidation of NO was increased of MnOx/TiO2(P) catalyst due to chemisorbed O2 species. In summary, it is proposed that the selective catalytic oxidation is directly related to the presence of Oα on the catalyst surface [63].

Fig. 7 (c) shows the Ga2p XPS spectra of the 24Ga-PCH catalyst and the two main peaks were corresponded to Ga 2p1/2 at 1145.06 eV and Ga 2p3/2 at 1118.18 eV respectively. A comparison of these energy values with previous literature [64,65], was corresponding to the single and bulk volume of Ga2O3. The two peaks separation distance was about ∼28.8 eV.
Fig. 7 (d) shows the Ga 3d XPS spectra of the 24Ga-PCH catalyst sample and the three peaks were observed at ∼24.80 eV (Peak I), ∼21.7 eV (Peak II) and peak III at ∼20.70 eV. The peak I (24.80 eV) was assigned to the O2s band, peak II (21.7 eV) was attributed to Ga3d band (pure β-Ga2O3) and the binding energy (20.70 eV) peak III was ascribed to Gaδ+ species similar to the previous studies [11,31,43].
4.5. Py-FTIR
The acidic site concentration in the catalyst plays a vital role in catalytic reaction at low temperatures. So, the amount of the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites are important parameter that must be considered to calculate in the NO oxidation and SCR of NO catalysts. Fig. 8 illustrates the Py-FTIR analysis of catalysts at temperatures 40 °C and 300 °C. It can be seen in Fig. 8 that the three high adsorption peaks of pyridine at 40 °C mainly appeared at ∼1595cm-1, ∼1489 cm-1, and ∼1442 cm-1 and the three pyridine adsorption peaks at ∼1594 cm-1, ∼1491 cm-1, ∼ 1455 cm-1 observed at 300 °C. The adsorption peaks at ∼1594-1595 were corresponded to Brønsted acid sites, the Lewis and Brønsted acid sites co-contribution were presented pyridine adsorption peak at ∼1489−1491 cm-1. At ∼ 1442 cm-1-1455 cm-1 pyridine adsorption peak was presented the Lewis acid site. It is reported in the previous study that the integration of highly dispersed Ga2O3 species to ZSM-5 could increase the concentration of the Lewis acid site [[66], [67], [68]].

The concentration amount of Brønsted & Lewis acid sites and their B/L ratio are presented in Table 3. It is observed from Table 3 that the 24Ga-PCH catalyst contained a high concentration amount of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites than the 7Ga-PCH catalyst at 40 °C and 300 °C pyridine adsorption results and as well as B/L ratio. It is reported that the Brønsted acid site was found due to group bonding structure of ≡ Si−OH-Al ≡ and it is related with the octahedral layer of Al and sheet of tetrahedral silica layer of parent montmorillonite clay and the acid site of Lewis amount was formed because of Al3+octahedral layer of porous clay heterestructures (PCH) [26]. It is noticed from Fig. 9 that acidic site was increased with the loading of gallium, which showed that the addition of the gallium oxide produces the high concentration of the Lewis acid sites. It has been pointed out in previous literature that gallium ions surely are one of the sources of the Lewis acid site and the Ga2O3 is the highly active catalyst due to it produce the high amount of acidic site [33]. Li et al. [69] reported that the Lewis acid site was increased the selective catalytic oxidation of NO and while activates the hydrocarbons at low temperatures. Therefore high efficiency of oxidation of NO to NO2, it is indicated that the Lewis acidity was one of the main dominant factors in the catalytic reaction. On the other hand, Strom et al. [70] found that the In/Al2O3 catalyst showed high NOx conversion with DME due to a high amount of acidic sites. Additionally, Wang et al. [71] studied that the Lewis acid sites were one of the active sites for NO adsorption. Furthermore, It is also reported that the addition of gallium oxide into alumina support was increased the concentration of Lewis acidic sites in the Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalyst [72].

4.6. O2 –TPD and NO- TPD
The O2-TPD tests were performed to study the oxygen species on the 7Ga-PCH and 24Ga-PCH catalysts as shown in Fig. 9a. It can be seen that the main three peaks were observed in the O2-TPD profile of both catalysts. The desorption peak at low temperature (∼160 °C) was related to the adsorbed oxygen, the second peak at medium temperature (∼250 °C) was attributed to the surface lattice oxygen and the 3rd desorption high-intensity peak at high temperature (∼325 °C) was related to the bulk lattice oxygen [54,73]. Although, the 24Ga-PCH catalyst sample was presented high intensity and large O2 desorption peak area as compared to the 7Ga-PCH catalyst. These results are correlated to BET, SEM and O1 s XPS characterizations.
Fig. 9b shows the TPD profile of NO adsorption on the 7Ga-PCH and 24Ga-PCH catalyst samples. As can be seen that the NO desorption was detected on both catalyst samples when the temperature increases from 35 to 350 °C. The main two peaks were observed on two different sites at temperature ranges from 100 to 300 °C for NO desorption. The NO desorption concentration demonstrated that the adsorption ability over 24Ga-PCH catalyst sample was higher as well as the area of NO adsorbed species than the 7Ga-PCH catalyst sample and also NO adsorption was not stable. It is suggested that the high gallium content and high dispersion of Ga2O3 on the surface of the catalyst, which could be responsible for higher catalytic oxidation of NO and concentration of NOx adsorption. The high NO desorption at very low temperature, it is indicated that the O2 and Ga2O3 could be had a lower bond capacity, which released the NO or NO2 oxidation product. The low-temperature desorption (150 C) was attributed to decomposition nitrite species. However, the slightly lower to a higher temperature (200–300 °C) desorption peak was ascribed to bidentate and bridge nitrate species [74].
Haneda et al. [18] observed the two NO adsorption peaks at ̴ 455 and ̴ 691 K over Ga2O3-Al2O3 catalyst in the NO-TPD study and the peak 691 K was corresponded to the (NO3‾) nitrates species and NO desorption peak at 455 K was assigned to (NO2‾) nitrite species. It is also suggested that the NO adsorption amount could be increased with increasing of Ga2O3 content in the catalyst and the concentration of NO adsorption can be varied by the catalyst weight as well as physical properties of catalyst. The NO oxidation reaction mechanism, it depends on the (1) adsorption behavior of reactants, (2) reaction pathways at active phases and (3) the desorption of product. The adsorption and gaseous behaviors on the catalyst surface is a play significant role in the catalytic reaction. Xu et al. [75] reported the possible reaction mechanism for the oxidation of NO over the Mn-Co/TiO2 catalyst. During the reaction, they found the formation of different nitrates such as bridge and bidentate on the surface of catalyst sample and the following equations were proposed the reaction mechanism:
(1)
O2 + e‾ → O2‾
(2)
NO + O2‾ → NO3‾
(3)
NO3‾ + NO → 2NO2‾ + e‾
The adsorbed nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was generated very fast than the nitrate species. However, the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) generated might be easily desorbed from the surface of the catalyst sample.
Furthermore, the NO was oxidized to NO2 due to adsorbed oxygen by the possible way of reaction. On the other hand, the NO formation and bidentate nitrite on the catalyst surface were proposed that the NO could be formed bidentate nitrite as the following equations.
(4)
NO + Oads‾ → NO2‾
(5)
NO2‾ + NO2‾ → (NO2)22−
(6)
(NO2)22− ⇋ 2NO2
(7)
(NO2)22− + O2 → 2NO3 ‾
(8)
2NO + Oads‾ → NO2 + NO ‾
(9)
NO2 + Oads‾ → NO3‾
5. Conclusion
The Ga-PCH catalyst has been found as a highly efficient and most active catalyst in the excess of oxygen for catalytic oxidation of NO. The 24Ga-PCH catalyst showed 100 % NO conversion to NO2 at 150 °C. We observed that the catalytic efficiency of Ga catalyst was directly related to the catalyst support, gallium concentration and acidic sites amount of the catalyst. The XRD and SEM results demonstrated that the addition of gallium oxides was produced more amorphous structures as well as chemisorbed oxygen. The high activity over the 24Ga-PCH catalyst was because of the high concentration amount of acidic sites in the catalyst due to gallium loading. We all know that NO2 formation is the variance link between fast SCR. During the fast SCR reaction, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) acts as a highly active oxidizing module than NO. Furthermore, the Ga-PCH catalyst can be used for the NOx elimination from the fossil fuel combustion plant and diesel engine.
