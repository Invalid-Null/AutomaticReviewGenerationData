Abstract
Propane dehydrogenation is commonly operated at temperatures exceeding 600 °C due to thermodynamic requirements. However, high temperature accelerates the deactivation of catalysts because of the coke deposition. Therefore, it is quite necessary to develop catalysts with high catalytic activity and improved anti-coking ability. To this end, an Al-doped Cr2O3 catalyst derived from MIL-101(Cr/Al) is prepared in this work. The preparation conditions, including the carbonization temperature of MIL-101 and the proportion of Cr/Al, are optimized via experimental studies. Meanwhile, the adsorption and dehydrogenation behaviors of propane on the catalyst are investigated using Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. Findings indicate that the optimum carbonization temperature and Cr/Al proportion are 900 °C and 6:4, respectively. Under the reaction condition of P = 0.1 MPa, T = 580 °C and GHSV = 800 h−1, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity on the Cr6/Al4 catalyst are 19.5% and 92.0%, respectively. The activity stability of the Al-doped Cr2O3 is elongated significantly due to the lower desorption energy of propene and higher energy barrier for the coke formation on the catalyst. In sum, the present work completed via experiments and DFT calculations will lead to a better understanding of the Al-doped Cr2O3 catalyst and guide the rational design of anti-coking catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the basic raw materials to produce plastics. The global demand for propylene has been increasing to 1.23×108 tons in 2021. Conventional petroleum or coal routes for propylene production include steam cracking (SC), fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), and coal/methane-to-olefin (CTO/MTO) processes [1,2]. However, since the high yield of by-products and resources consumption in these conventional routes, a more efficient and on-purpose technique, namely the propane dehydrogenation (PDH), has been driven into the global market [3]. Currently, nearly 20% of propylene is produced via the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane or propane-butane mixtures in China [4]. Catofin is one of the most common commercial PDH technologies, where the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst is utilized due to its high activity and low cost [5], [6], [7]. However, since high temperature (i.e., 600∼650 °C) is required for the reaction of propane dehydrogenation (i.e., C-H bond cleavage), thermal cracking and coke formation reactions (i.e., C-C bond cleavage and C=C bond polymerization) are inevitably aggravated at elevated temperatures. Consequently, the Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst deactivates very fast [8,9]. Regarding Catofin, dehydrogenation and regeneration steps are normally carried out simultaneously every ten minutes to avoid serious coking [10,11]. It is therefore a key issue to develop novel Cr-based catalysts with simultaneously high catalytic activity and strong anti-coking ability.
Conventional supported Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are prepared by impregnation or kneading methods, where Al2O3 is the commonly used carrier [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. The anti-coking ability of Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts strongly depends on the acidity and specific surface area of the carriers [18,19]. Hitherto, a great many kinds of Al2O3 carriers have been explored for light alkanes dehydrogenation in literature [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. However, alumina has various phase structures and it is too complex to control precisely the synthesis of a specific alumina. As an alternative, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have several advantages, such as the ultra-high surface area, tunable pore size, and adjustable metal center and functional group [25,26]. With such merits, researchers prepared MOF-derived catalysts with large surface area via carbonization treatment. Torad et al. synthesized a Co-based catalyst for efficient water treatment by one-step carbonization of zeolitic imidazolate framework-67 (ZIF-67). The catalyst showed a high surface area and Co nanoparticles were well dispersed in the carbon matrix [27]. Li et al. prepared a CaO/ZrO2 catalyst carbonized from the UiO-66(Zr) for biodiesel production [28]. Zhao et al. prepared a mesoporous Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst for the dehydrogenation of isobutane. The catalyst was synthesized by using MIL-101(Cr) as the chromium precursor, aluminum isopropoxide as the aluminum precursor [29]. Different from Zhao et al.’s work, a new approach to prepare Al-doped Cr2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is developed herein based on the one-step carbonization of MIL-101(Cr/Al).
Density Functional Theory (DFT) has been widely used to study heterogeneous catalysts [30,31]. With DFT calculations, great efforts have been spent to gain better understandings of the structure activity relationship of Cr-based catalysts for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes [32,33]. For instance, Huš et al. investigated the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene on a chromium oxide catalyst and built a kinetic model from the reaction network pathway [34]. Sun et al. compared various oxygen groups produced on the Cr2O3 catalyst in the propane dehydrogenation process and stated that the hydroxyl has similar performance with terminal or bridge oxygens [35]. Kopač et al. studied the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and butane over variously doped (Na, Li, K, Mg, Ca, or Cs) chromium oxide using first principles [36]. Zhang et al. studied the catalytic performance of transition metal-doped Cr2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation by combined microkinetic modeling with periodic DFT+U calculations. They indicated that, from the perspective of theoretical calculations, most of the single atoms concerned can be stably located on the Cr2O3 surface [37]. However, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the effects of the doping of aluminum into the Cr2O3 catalyst have not been paid much attention yet.
The primary aim of the present work is to develop an approach to fabricate the Al-doped Cr2O3 catalyst, which is derived from MIL-101(Cr/Al), overcoming the fast deactivation of the catalyst for PDH. In Section 2, the preparation, characterization, and evaluation of the MIL-101(Cr) and MIL-101(Cr/Al) derived Cr2O3 catalysts are presented. In Section 3, the effects of the carbonization temperature and the Cr/Al proportion on the performances of the prepared catalysts are investigated via experiments; the adsorption and dehydrogenation of propane and intermediates on the pure Cr2O3 and Al-doped Cr2O3 catalysts are compared via DFT calculations. In Section 4, conclusions on the preparation of the Al-doped Cr2O3 catalyst and the influences of aluminum doping on the catalysts are drawn.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and catalyst preparation
1,4-Benzene dicarboxylic acid (H2BDC, C8H6O4, ≥98.0%) was purchased from Aladdin. Chromium nitrate nonahydrate (Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, ≥98.0%), aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O, ≥98.0%), hydrofluoric acid (HF, ≥48.0%), and absolute ethanol (C2H5OH, ≥99.0%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. All the above materials were used as received.
MIL-101(Cr) was synthesized by the microwave-hydrothermal method according to Ref. [38] with the consumption of 2.0 g Cr(NO3)3·9H2O, 0.823 g H2BDC and 5 mmol HF. To remove the guest molecules, the as-synthesized MIL-101 was washed with C2H5OH for three times and degassed under the reduced pressure at 150 °C for 12 h. Afterwards, the MIL-101(Cr) was calcinated at 900 °C in nitrogen for 4 h with a heating rate of 10 °C/min to obtain the Cr2O3 catalyst. In order to investigate the effects of the carbonization temperature of MIL-101 on the catalytic activity and selectivity for the propane dehydrogenation, various Cr2O3[T] catalysts were fabricated by adjusting the calcination temperature, namely, 600 °C, 700 °C, 800 °C, 900 °C, 1000 °C and 1100 °C.
MIL-101(Cr/Al) was synthesized using the same microwave-hydrothermal method with the exception that the consumptions of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and Al(NO3)3·9H2O were 1.2 g and 0.75 g, respectively. The as-synthesized MIL-101(Cr/Al) was carbonized at 900 °C in N2 for 4 h to obtain the Al-doped Cr2O3 catalyst, denoted as Cr6/Al4 (the subscripts stand for the proportions of chromium and aluminum in the catalyst). To investigate the effects of the proportions of Cr/Al on the catalytic activity and selectivity for PDH, various Crx/Aly catalysts were fabricated by controlling the consumptions of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O and Al(NO3)3·9H2O in the preparation of MIL-101(Cr/Al).
2.2. Catalyst characterization and evaluation
A series of the prepared Cr2O3[T] and Crx/Aly catalysts were characterized or evaluated using combined techniques, including XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, FT-IR, TG and a fixed-bed reactor. Details are shown in Supporting Information.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. MIL-101(Cr) derived Cr2O3 catalyst
3.1.1. XRD patterns
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized MIL-101(Cr) and the Cr2O3 catalysts derived from the MOF at various carbonization temperatures. It can be seen from Fig. 1a that the characteristic peaks are in accordance with the reference pattern for MIL-101(Cr) [39,40], indicating that the MIL-101(Cr) was well-crystallized. By contrast, as observed from Fig. 1b, the Cr2O3 catalyst derived from the MIL-101(Cr) at the carbonization temperature of 600 °C hardly shows any crystal structure, which can be ascibed to the collapse of the original MOF structure [41]. However, when the carbonization temperature exceeds 700 °C, the occurrence of a new crystal structure can be observed. As shown in Fig. 1b, the characteristic peaks at 2θ = 24.5°, 33.6°, 36.2°, 41.5°, 50.2°, 54.9°, 63.4°, and 65.1° of the generated crystal are in very good agreement with the reference pattern for α-Cr2O3 in the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) database (PDF No.38-1479). As the carbonization temperature increases, the intensity of these characteristic peaks increases, indicating that the crystallinity of the prepared Cr2O3 catalyst is promoted.

3.1.2. TG analysis
Fig. 2a gives the thermal gravimetric (TG) analysis on MIL-101(Cr) in N2. As can be seen from the figure, the carbonization process can be divided into three stages: (i) at the preheating stage (< 200 °C), the adsorbed water is vaporized from MIL-101(Cr); (ii) at the pyrolysis stage (200 ∼ 600 °C), most of the organic ligands are pyrolyzed or gasified; (iii) at the carbonization stage (> 600 °C), the MOF structure is collapsed and the carbon is retained.

To determine the carbon contents in the MIL-101(Cr) derived Cr2O3 catalysts prepared at various carbonization temperatures, TG analyses are carried out in air, as presented in Fig. 2b. It can be seen from the figure that, as the carbonation temperature increases, the weight loss of the prepared catalyst decreases due to higher carbon contents. According to Fig. 2b, the calculated carbon contents in the Cr2O3 catalysts are 16.73%, 15.91%, 15.08%, 10.28%, 1.06%, and 0.49%, respectively, as the carbonization temperature increases from 600 °C to 1100 °C. It is noted that the carbon contents in the Cr2O3[600] and Cr2O3[700] catalysts include the amount of the organic ligands that are not pyrolyzed and retained during the carbonization process. By contrast, there is little weight loss for the catalysts prepared at the carbonization temperature above 1000 °C since the original MIL-101(Cr) structure has been collapsed almost completely, which can be further observed from the SEM images and BET analysis on the catalysts.
3.1.3. SEM images
Fig. 3 illustrates the microtopography of MIL-101(Cr) and the Cr2O3 catalysts fabricated at various carbonization temperatures. As can be seen vividly from Fig. 3a, the octahedral structure of MIL-101(Cr) is intact and the size of an octahedral crystal is about 120 nm. However, when the carbonization temperature is 700 °C, the octahedral structure is damaged significantly as shown in Fig. 3b, so that it is hardly detected by XRD as discussed in Section 3.1.1. Regarding the carbonization temperatures of 800 °C or 900 °C, the octahedral structure of the MIL-101(Cr) are damaged more seriously as observed from Fig. 3c and d. When the carbonization temperature increases to 1000 °C or 1100 °C, obvious sintering phenomena can be found on the catalyst surface, as shown in Fig. 3e and f, resulting in the serious block of catalyst pores and the sharp reduction of the surface area as presented in the subsequent section.

3.1.4. Textural analysis
The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distributions for the MIL-101(Cr) derived Cr2O3 catalysts are displayed in Fig. 4. It can be seen from the figure that the N2 adsorption desorption isotherm of the Cr2O3 catalysts fabricated at carbonization temperature less than 900 °C belong to type IV, while the N2 adsorption desorption isotherm of the catalysts prepared at above 1000 °C belong to type I. When the relative pressure (P/P0) is less than 0.05, N2 adsorption capacity increases as the relative pressure becomes larger. For P/P0 = 0.05∼0.95, the amount of N2 adsorption changes little with the increase of relative pressure, implying that the prepared catalysts have many micropores. For P/P0 > 0.95, the N2 adsorption capacity increases significantly with the increase of the relative pressure and there exists a hysteretic loop, indicating that the catalyst contains mesoporous structures as well. That is, the MIL-101(Cr) derived Cr2O3 catalysts have both micropores and mesopores which are generated from the pyrolysis of organic ligands and the collapse of MOF structure at high carbonization temperatures [29].

Table 1 summarizes the textural data of the MIL-101(Cr) derived Cr2O3 catalysts. As can be seen from the table, the catalyst pore structures are significantly influenced by the carbonization temperature. As the carbonization temperature increases, both the specific surface area and pore volume of the catalyst decrease. The reason can be ascribed to the collapse of the MIL-101(Cr) structure during the carbonization process. The findings are also in accordance with the observations from SEM images as discussed in the above section.

3.1.5. XPS spectra
Fig. 5 presents the XPS spectra of C 1s, O 1s, and Cr 2p3/2 orbitals on the prepared Cr2O3 catalyst surface. As can be seen from Fig. 5a, with the increase of carbonization temperature, the contents of C-C and C-O bonds remain almost unchanged, while the content of C=O decreases significantly. The latter is caused by the enhanced pyrolysis and release of the MIL-101(Cr) organic ligands at high carbonization temperatures. As can be seen from Fig. 5b, with the increase of carbonization temperature, the content of O-Cr bond increases while the content of O=C bond decreases, resulting in the higher exposure of Cr species on the catalyst surface. From Fig. 5c, it can be seen that the binding energies in the range of 576.0–570.0 eV and 578.0–579.1 eV are for Cr3+ and Cr6+, respectively.

Table 2 summarizes the surface concentration and mole ratio of Cr3+ to Cr6+ (Cr3+/Cr6+) for the tested catalysts. As expected, the amount of surface Cr3+ and Cr6+ increases from 1.20% to 3.15% and from 1.11% to 3.22%, respectively, as the carbonization temperature increases from 600 °C to 1100 °C. The value of Cr3+/Cr6+ increases from 1.08 to 1.59 as the carbonization temperature increases from 600 °C to 900 °C. Afterwards, the Cr3+/Cr6+ decreases to 0.98 on the Cr2O3 [1100] catalyst. That is, the amount of surface Cr3+, which is commonly regarded as the active species for PDH [42], is the highest on the Cr2O3 [900] catalyst.

3.1.6. Catalytic performances
Under the reaction condition of P = 0.1 MPa, T = 580 °C and GHSV = 800 h−1, the catalytic performances of the MIL-101(Cr) derived Cr2O3 catalysts prepared at various carbonization temperatures are evaluated by using a fixed-bed reactor. Fig. 6 plots the effects of the carbonization temperature of MIL-101(Cr) on the propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and propylene yield on the Cr2O3 catalysts. The by-products of propane dehydrogenation on the catalyst are similar to those on conventional Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalysts, i.e., methane, ethane, ethylene, hydrogen, and coke. As can be seen from Fig. 6, the conversion of propane on the Cr2O3[600] catalyst is the highest, while the lowest conversion is observed on the Cr2O3[1100] catalyst, which is mainly due to the specific area of the latter is much smaller than that of the former, as discussed in Section 3.1.4. Since Cr3+ is the main active center for Cr-containing catalysts [43,44], the highest selectivity of propylene occurs on the Cr2O3[900] catalyst because of the largest ratio of Cr3+ to Cr6+ compared to other Cr2O3 catalysts, as illustrated in Fig. 6b. Meanwhile, the catalyst presents a satisfactory conversion of propane as shown in Fig. 6a. From Fig. 6c, it can be found that although the yield of propylene on the Cr2O3[600] catalyst reaches the highest, the selectivity of propylene on the catalyst is too low in comparison to other catalysts as observed from Fig. 6b. Therefore, taking both the propane conversion and propylene selectivity into considerations, the carbonization temperature of 900 °C shall be the most appropriate for the preparation of MIL-101(Cr) derived Cr2O3 catalysts.

3.2. MIL-101(Cr/Al) derived Cr2O3 catalyst
3.2.1. Characterizations of Al-doped Cr2O3 catalysts
Fig. 7 shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared MIL-101(Cr/Al) and the Al-doped Cr2O3 catalysts derived from the MIL-101(Cr/Al) with various proportions of Cr/Al. It can be seen from Fig. 7a that the characteristic peaks of all MIL-101(Cr/Al) are in accordance with the reference pattern for MIL-101(Cr/Al) [45], indicating that the MOFs are well-crystallized. As can be seen from Fig. 7b, the original MIL-101 structure is replaced by the α-Cr2O3 phase structure after being carbonized at 900 °C. It can also be seen from Fig. 6b that, as the amount of doped aluminum increases, the intensity of the characteristic peaks for α-Cr2O3 phase decreases. This is reasonable because more and more Cr atoms are replaced by the Al atom and the introduction of Al may improve the dispersion of Cr active components. Nevertheless, the Al2O3 phase was not detected by XRD. One possible explanation is that aluminum may be doped into the α-Cr2O3 phase. The existence of aluminum in the MIL-101(Cr/Al) derived catalysts can be proved by the TEM and EDS mapping, FT-IR and XPS analyses on the prepared catalysts.

Fig. 8 presents the TEM images and EDS mapping of the Cr6/Al4 catalysts prepared from MIL-101(Cr6/Al4). It can be seen from the figure that, Al was indeed dispersed well on the catalyst surface, together with Cr and O elements. However, the amount of Al is smaller than those of Cr and O elements. It can also be seen from the figure that the distance of the lattice fringes is d = 0.226 nm, which is quite close to the spacing of Cr2O3(0006) crystal planes (0.227 nm). Since the crystal structure of α-Cr2O3 is hexagonal and atoms are piled up in the form of Hexagonal Closest Packed (HCP), the surface energy and exposed atoms on (0006) and (0001) surfaces should be the same. Moreover, Cr2O3(0001) has been used by many researchers in DFT calculations for Cr2O3 catalysts [46,47]. Therefore, in Section 3.3, theoretical studies on the Cr2O3(0001) surfaces are performed.

The two absorption peaks at 422 cm−1 and 448 cm−1 shall be assigned to the vibration of the Al-O bond [49,50], indicating the existence of aluminum in the prepared Cr2O3 catalysts derived from the MIL-101(Cr/Al).

The XPS spectra of Cr 2p3/2 and Al 2p orbitals on the MIL-101(Cr/Al) derived Cr2O3 catalysts fabricated with various proportions of Cr/Al are plotted in Fig. 10. It can be seen from Fig. 10a that the binding energies of the Al-O bond are in the range of 72.0–77.3 eV, indicating the existence of aluminum in the prepared catalysts. As expected, it can also be seen from the figure that, with the decrease of the Cr/Al proportion, the content of Al in the catalyst increases. From Fig. 10b, it can be seen that, as the Cr/Al proportion increases, the surface content of Cr3+ is enhanced while the amount of surface Cr6+ decreases for the prepared catalysts. The reason can be ascribed to the doping of aluminum into the catalysts. Specifically, since the electronegativity of aluminum (i.e., 1.61) is a bit lower than that of chromium (i.e., 1.66), surface Cr6+ on the Al-doped catalyst is more readily reduced to Cr3+ than the case without the doping of aluminum (i.e., pure Cr2O3 catalyst). Moreover, higher content of Cr3+ in the catalyst would further enhance its catalytic activity for PDH.

3.2.2. Propane dehydrogenation over Al-doped Cr2O3 catalysts
Fig. 11 plots the evolutions of propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and propylene yield as a function of time over the Cr2O3[900] and Al-doped Cr2O3 catalysts. It can be seen from Fig. 11a that the catalytic activity decreases initially with the increase of the Cr/Al proportion. After 75 min, the Cr6/Al4 catalyst presents the highest conversion of propane. From Fig. 11b and c, the highest selectivity and yield of propylene are observed over the Cr6/Al4 catalyst after 120 min and 75 min, respectively. That is, the Cr6/Al4 catalyst shows the best catalytic performances for propane dehydrogenation. It can also be seen from Fig. 11a–c that, compared to the Cr2O3[900] catalyst, all Al-doped Cr2O3 catalysts present better catalytic performances for PDH. Additionally, for almost all Cr2O3 catalysts, no matter whether the aluminum is doped or not, the catalytic activity decreases over the reaction time due to the deactivation of catalysts caused by the coke deposition. Fig. 11d displays the amount of coke deposited on the catalysts which are calculated based on the TG analyses on the fresh and spent catalysts. It can be seen vividly from the figure that the doping of aluminum into the catalysts decreases the amount of coke deposited on the catalysts during the propane dehydrogenation process. The reason can be disclosed via DFT calculations on the Cr2O3 catalysts with and without the doping of aluminum in Section 3.3. Besides, it is noted that, compared to the conventional Cr2O3/Al2O3 or Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts on which two kinds of coke (i.e., coke on the metal and support, respectively) are always formed during the PDH process [4,51], only one type of coke is generated on the developed Al-doped Cr2O3 catalyst which can be proved via TG analyses on the spent catalysts.

3.3.2. Adsorption of reactants and intermediates
The adsorption of C3Hx (x = 4-8) species on the pure Cr2O3(0001) and Al-doped Cr2O3(0001) surfaces are investigated. As reported in our previous study [4], in the adsorption stage of light alkanes on the Cr-containing catalysts, C atoms of propane tend to be adsorbed by Cr atoms on the (0001) surface, while H atoms of propane prefer to approach O atoms. Fig. 12 shows the most stable adsorption configurations of C3Hx species on the two catalytic surfaces. As can be observed from the figure, the adsorption configurations of C3Hx on the pure and Al-doped Cr2O3 (0001) surfaces are almost the same except for the different distances between the C atom of C3Hx species and the Cr atom on the catalytic surface because of the influences of the doped Al atoms. As can be seen from Fig. 12, the most stable adsorption configuration of propane is parallel to the Cr2O3 (0001) surface, but no Cr-C bond or O-H bond is formed, indicating that propane undergoes physical adsorption on both (0001) surfaces. It can also be seen from the figure that, for both surfaces, propyl and propenyl are apt to adsorb onto the Cr site of the surface via a Cr-C bond, while propene and propyne adsorb onto the Cr site via two Cr-C bonds. However, the absorption abilities of propyl (i.e., -3.02 eV and -2.95 eV) and propenyl (i.e., -3.26 eV and -3.19 eV) on both (0001) surfaces are much stronger than those of propene (i.e., -1.51 eV and -1.33 eV) and propyne (i.e., -1.71 eV and -1.59 eV), as plotted in Fig. 13. This may be due to the different absorption mechanisms for these C3Hx species. Regarding propyl and propenyl, the interactions of them with the Cr2O3 (0001) surface is by the σ bond, while propene and propyne are interacted with the surface by the π bond [44].

Additionally, it can be seen from Fig. 13 that the absorption abilities of C3Hx species on the pure Cr2O3(0001) surface is higher than those on the Al-doped Cr2O3(0001) surface, indicating that although the dehydrogenation reactant (i.e., propane) is easier to absorb onto the former surface, meanwhile the dehydrogenation products and intermediates (i.e., propyl and propene) are difficult to desorb from the former surface, which more likely results in deep dehydrogenation of C3Hx and coke formation on the pure Cr2O3(0001) than that on the Al-doped Cr2O3(0001) surface.
3.3.3. Propane dehydrogenation and coke formation
As long as the steady adsorption conformations are determined, the elementary reactions for propane dehydrogenation and coke formation are investigated via DFT calculations. Fig. 14 provides the configurations of the initial state (IS), transition state (TS), and final state (FS) of four elementary steps for the propane dehydrogenation on the pure Cr2O3(0001) surface. The corresponding energy barriers from DFT calculations are presented in Fig. 15. As can be seen from Fig. 14, the initial dehydrogenation of propane generates propyl adsorbed on the Cr site of the Cr2O3(0001) surface, in which the transition state also adsorbs on the Cr atom. The energy barrier is 1.79 eV and the reaction energy is 0.44 eV. The detached hydrogen atom from propane adsorbs on the O site of the Cr2O3(0001) surface in the final state. In order to exclude the influences of the co-adsorbed hydrogen on subsequent dehydrogenation reactions, the detached hydrogen atom can be considered to diffuses far away enough from the adsorbed C3Hx species [52]. Since the adsorption of propyl on the catalyst Cr site is very stable as shown in Fig. 13a, propene can be readily generated by the further dehydrogenation of propyl with an energy barrier as low as 1.60 eV and an endothermic reaction energy of 0.90 eV. In the final state of the elementary step, propene gets adsorbed on the surface Cr site and the detached H atom is adsorbed on the O site. In the elementary reaction r3, propene starts with the cleavage of the C-H bond with an energy barrier of 3.42 eV and a reaction energy of 1.21 eV to form propenyl. Subsequently, in the elementary reaction r4, the C-H bond of propenyl is broken via overcoming an energy barrier of 1.78 eV for the generation of propyne. The reaction energy is 0.90 eV.

Fig. 15. Energy profiles for propane dehydrogenation and coke formation on the Cr2O3(0001) and Al-doped Cr2O3(0001) surfaces.
Additionally, the configurations of the initial state, transition state, and final state of the elementary step r5 for the coke formation via the C-C cleavage on the Cr2O3(0001) surface is also presented in Fig. 14. As can be seen from the figure, the C-C scission of the adsorbed propyne leads to the formation of coke (C2H*) and methyl (CH3*). Many researchers claimed that the molecular formula of coke deposited on the catalyst for propane dehydrogenation can be expressed as CH0.5 [51,53], which is equivalent to the coke formula in the DFT calculations. As presented in Fig. 15, the energy barrier for the C-C bond scission of propyne on the Cr2O3(0001) surface is 3.48 eV, which is higher than all energy barriers for dehydrogenation.
By comparing to the desorption energy of the intermediate, the possibility of further dehydrogenation can be determined [52]. For instance, propene got desorbed from the pure Cr2O3(0001) surface must overcome the energy barrier of 1.81 eV to form gaseous propylene, which is lower than that of the propene dehydrogenation (3.60 eV) to generate propenyl. Therefore, the desorption of propene is more likely to happen in comparison to further dehydrogenation on the Cr2O3(0001) surface.
Fig. S2 shows the configurations of the initial state, transition state, and final state of the five elementary steps for propane dehydrogenation and coke formation on the Al-doped Cr2O3(0001) surface, which are similar to those on the pure Cr2O3(0001) surface. The corresponding energy profiles for propane dehydrogenation and coke formation on the Al-doped Cr2O3(0001) surface are also summarized in Fig. 15 for comparison. The energy barriers to overcome in elementary reactions for propane dehydrogenation (i.e., r1-r4) and coke formation (r5) on the Al-doped Cr2O3(0001) surface are 1.99 eV, 1.35 eV, 3.60 eV, 1.64 eV, and 3.81 eV, respectively. That is, the energy barriers of elementary steps r3 and r5 for the dehydrogenation of propene and the formation of coke on the Al-doped Cr2O3(0001) surface are higher than those on the pure Cr2O3(0001) surface. Consequently, the coke formation is effectively hindered and the catalytic stabilities of the Al-doped Cr2O3 catalysts were elongated as discussed in Section 3.2.2. Besides, the energies required for the desorption and dehydrogenation of propene on the Al-doped Cr2O3(0001) are 1.51 eV and 3.62 eV, respectively. Therefore, the desorption of propene on the Al-doped Cr2O3(0001) is more readily taken place while the deep dehydrogenation of propene to generate coke is more difficult in comparison to the Cr2O3(0001) without the doping of aluminum.
4. Conclusion
An approach to fabricating the anti-coking Al-doped Cr2O3 catalyst which is derived from MIL-101(Cr/Al) is developed. The carbonization temperature of MIL-101 and the proportion of Cr/Al for the fabrication of the catalyst are optimized experimentally. The adsorption and dehydrogenation of propane and intermediates on the pure and Al-doped Cr2O3 catalysts are investigated using DFT methods. Findings indicate that the optimum carbonization temperature of MIL-101 is 900 °C and the appropriate proportion of Cr/Al is 6:4 to fabricate the Al-doped Cr2O3 catalysts. Under the condition of P = 0.1 MPa, T = 580 °C and GHSV = 800 h−1, the conversion of propane and selectivity of propylene on the Cr6/Al4 catalyst are 19.5% and 92.0%, respectively. Compared to the pure Cr2O3 catalyst derived from MIL-101(Cr), the catalytic stability of the Al-doped Cr2O3 catalyst derived from MIL-101(Cr/Al) is elongated considerably. According to DFT calculations, the better performance of the Al-doped Cr2O3 catalyst is due to the lower desorption energy for propene and the higher energy barrier for the coke formation. As expected, the present work completed via experiments and DFT calculations will lead to a better understanding of the Al-doped Cr2O3 catalyst and the adsorption and dehydrogenation behaviors of propane on the anti-coking catalyst.
