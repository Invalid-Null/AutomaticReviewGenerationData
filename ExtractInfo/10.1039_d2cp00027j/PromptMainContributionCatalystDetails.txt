A critical evaluation of the catalytic role of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation catalyzed by chromium oxide from a DFT-based microkinetic simulation†
Propane dehydrogenation under CO2 is an important catalytic route to obtain propene with a good balance between selectivity and stability. However, a precise description of the catalytic role of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation is still absent. In this work, we focus on the elucidation of the role of CO2 by using DFT-based microkinetic simulation. The influence of CO2 is categorized as direct and indirect effects. It was found that the chemisorbed CO2 can directly abstract hydrogen from propane and propyl with a comparable barrier to the counterpart at the surface oxygen site. On the other hand, the dissociation of CO2 yields active surface species of CO* and O* which are actively involved in the removal of surface hydroxyls. It is found that the TOFs of both propane conversion and propene formation are significantly increased with the presence of CO2, which is explained by the reduced apparent activation energy. The primary hydrogen abstraction is identified to be the most influential step from the DRC analysis. The main effects of CO2 are concluded to be removing hydrogen and restoring oxygen vacancies from reaction pathway analysis.
1. Introduction
Propylene is the raw material for the synthesis of acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, acetone, etc.1,2 It is also one of the common indexes to evaluate the capacity of the chemical industry. Recently, there has been a so-called “propene gap,” which signaled the imbalance between propene demands and supplies.3 This is an indication that propene production is strained worldwide. The conventional propene production technology is catalytic petroleum refineries with steam or fluid cracking.1 It is an energy-intensive process with low selectivity of propene. Conversely, on-purpose catalytic propane dehydrogenation has the advantage of delivering a decent selectivity with substantial economic revenue.4–6 There are two major routes for catalytic propane dehydrogenation, which are direct and oxidative dehydrogenation, respectively.7 Whether an oxidant such as oxygen is in use or not is the distinction between these two routes. Direct dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic reaction, and the yields are limited by thermodynamics.8 Moreover, the quick coke deposition is the major bottleneck for direct dehydrogenation, which seriously undermines the stability and life of the catalyst.9 The introduction of oxidants alleviates these issues to some extent, particularly for coke formation. However, the side effect of oxidants like oxygen is that deep reactions are induced due to the strong oxidation ability, which severely decreased the selectivity. Therefore, the key issue is how to keep a balance between stability and selectivity for catalytic propane dehydrogenation.
To tackle this issue, soft oxidants including CO2, N2O, SO210 and halogens are investigated for catalytic propane dehydrogenation. It is suggested that soft oxidants could lessen the deep dehydrogenation while inhibiting coke formation and maintaining the catalyst stability. These soft oxidants have their own pros and cons, respectively. Sulfur compounds, such as SO2, are a common contaminant in natural gas. It was found that there is a significant decrease in the catalytic activity of propane dehydrogenation at low temperatures in the presence of SO2. Moreover, the reaction is highly endothermic. With N2O as an oxidant, the reaction has a strong temperature dependence and a lower TOF when compared with other soft oxidants such as CO2.11 For halogens, the main issue is the corrosive nature that needs special protection for the equipment. Among soft oxidants, CO2 is the most widely examined one.10,12–14 The use of CO2 as an oxidant not only improves the catalytic performance but also reduces the greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, it is a win–win solution. Both the C–H bond in propane and the C–O bond in CO2 are extremely stable, which requires a highly efficient catalyst. The conventional catalytic propane dehydrogenation catalysts include platinum,15,16 chromium oxide,17,18 vanadium oxide,1,19,20etc. In particular, chromium oxide has demonstrated excellent performance in propane dehydrogenation with the presence of CO2 (PDH-CO2) due to its unique geometry and good redox properties.
The experimental observations from Michorzyk et al.3 clearly verified the positive role of CO2, which significantly increases the yields of propene. They concluded that the increased activities were partly attributed to the reverse water-gas shift reaction that reduces the partial pressure of hydrogen and pushes the equilibrium towards propene formation. The active chromium species involved in the reaction were proposed to be Cr6+/Cr2/3+.13,21 The enhancement of CO2 also seemed to be related to the support. Shishido et al.22 compared propane dehydrogenation on chromium oxide supported on silica and alumina, respectively, in PDH-CO2. They found that the latter case did not show improvements over the counterpart without CO2. Moreover, they suggested that the active center is Cr3+/Cr4+. They concluded that the role of CO2 is to reoxidize Cr3+ and provide an alternative oxidative dehydrogenation pathway. The negative effects of CO2 for Cr2O3/Al2O3 might be caused by the competitive adsorption between CO2 and C3H8. Wang et al.23 performed a careful examination of the catalytic role of Cr6+ species either in isolation or polymerization in PDH-CO2. They found that polymeric Cr6+ is more active for C3H8 conversion but less selective for propene formation compared with its isolated counterpart. Moreover, the coke exhibited Janus characters which decrease C3H8 conversion but facilitate propene desorption, which is also consistent with our previous work.16 Overall, the catalytic performance and reaction mechanism of chromium oxide in PDH-CO2 are quite complicated and are influenced by several factors including metal loading, valence state, support, and synthesis method.24,25
On the other hand, the participation of CO2 brought another variable to be considered for PDH-CO2. However, clarifying the role of CO2 in PDH-CO2 is not trivial. The difficulties associated with that are several parallel or continuous catalytic routes involved in CO2 in PDH-CO2 including reverse water-gas shift reaction, oxidative dehydrogenation, reverse Boudouard reaction, dry reforming of propane, etc. Moreover, CO2 can also restore the valence of active Cr species and fill the surface oxygen vacancy. Perhaps due to this complexity of CO2, the majority of previous studies focus on the nature of the Cr active site and its relation with performance. The available discussions of CO2 are also showing contradictions.5,12,19,26 The absence of a deep understanding of CO2 catalytic capabilities has significantly hindered the resolution of the reaction mechanism and rational optimization.
To address this issue, DFT-based microkinetic simulations are performed to reveal the role of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation catalyzed by chromium oxide in the current study. Not only propane dehydrogenation but also all possible pathways involved in CO2 are investigated at the same footing. The influence of CO2 on the adsorption of propane and propene is examined. The reaction pathways without and with CO2 are explored and compared, which provides direct evidence of CO2 effects. Moreover, the thermal and kinetic parameters of elementary steps including dehydrogenation, CO2 activation, reverse water-gas shift, and the surface redox process are obtained from DFT and transition state theory. Based on the microkinetic simulation, the effects induced by CO2 are elaborated for the reaction rate and mechanism. The current work lays out a solid basis for further developments of CO2 as a soft oxidant in light alkane dehydrogenation.
2. Computational details
The calculations have been carried out using periodic density functional theory with the VASP package.27,28 The interactions between valence electrons and ion cores were treated by the projector-augmented wave method.29,30 The PBE exchange–correlation functional was employed in the calculations.31 The energy cut-off was set to be 450 eV. The d electrons of Cr were treated with the GGA+U method to account for on-site Coulomb interactions,32 and the value of U was set to be 4 eV.17 Moreover, the DFT-D3 correction method of Grimme et al. was used to include the van der Waals correction.33 The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack mesh.34 The lattice constant of chromium oxide was obtained from the Birch–Murnaghan equation (a0 = b0 = 4.99 Å and c0 = 13.62 Å) as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). A 2 × 3 supercell containing 90 atoms was used to model the (001) surface as shown in Fig. 1. The atoms in the top three layers were allowed to relax during optimization. The convergence of energy and force was set to be 10−5 eV and 0.03 eV Å−1, respectively.

The transition state was obtained from CI-NEB calculations.35 There is one and only one imaginary frequency associated with each transition state. The reaction energy barrier equals the difference in the energy of the initial and transition states with the correction of zero-point energy.
The microkinetic simulation was performed by using MKMCXX software.36 In the process of catalytic reaction, all elementary reactions were carried out on the surface of the catalyst, which includes the processes of adsorption, desorption and surface reaction.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Adsorption and dissociation of reactants
3.1.1 Adsorption of propane and propene Propane is one of the saturated hydrocarbons and is quite chemically inert, which leads to weak adsorption on most catalyst surfaces. A similar phenomenon is also observed in the current work. Five different configurations of propane adsorption are obtained as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) with the largest adsorption of −0.33 eV. The adsorption of propene often has two modes which are di-σ and π adsorption, respectively.38 The calculations indicated that propene is taking π adsorption on the chromium oxide surface as shown in Fig. S2(f) (ESI†) with an adsorption energy of −0.97 eV. The missing di-σ adsorption is due to the large separation between two Cr sites that prevents the effective bonding. On the other hand, the entropy has a remarkable influence on the adsorption, particularly for propene as listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The adsorption energy of propene is significantly reduced at elevated temperatures. It is clearly indicated that the adsorption of propene is bigger than propane. This is an indication that the product is more reactive than the reactant in propane dehydrogenation which easily induces a deep reaction under dehydrogenation conditions. 3.1.2 CO2 adsorption and activation Similarly, the adsorption of CO2 can be classified as physisorption and chemisorption, respectively, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The configurations of CO2 physisorption are shown in Fig. S3(a) and (b) (ESI†), which is either perpendicular or parallel to the surface. The distance between CO2 and the surface Cr site is 3.22 and 3.42 Å, and the adsorption energy is −0.19 and −0.23 eV, respectively, which is slightly higher than propane. The configuration of CO2 chemisorption is shown in Fig. S3(c) (ESI†). The geometry of adsorbed CO2 is significantly distorted from linear in the gas phase with a bond angle of 142.9°. Moreover, the adsorption energy is considerably increased to be −0.47 eV with a much reduced distance of 2.2 Å. The conversion between physisorption and chemisorption is quite facile with a barrier of 0.30 eV as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†).
The dissociation of CO2 is also explored as shown in Fig. 2. Two different pathways are examined for the formation of CO* and O*. The first pathway (blue) is the direct breaking of the C–O bond via a single transition state from physisorption, which has a barrier of 1.14 eV. On the second pathway (red), the dissociation started from chemisorbed CO2, and the barrier was calculated to be 0.77 eV. The large barrier associated with the first pathway probably is related to the bigger separation of binding sites for the dissociated fragments, which required more energy.39

3.2 Dehydrogenation of propane
3.2.1 Dehydrogenation without CO2 Two hydrogen atoms need to be abstracted from propane in order to form propene. There are two different hydrogens in propane, which are primary and secondary hydrogen, respectively. Therefore, two different pathways for dehydrogenation are explored which start with either primary or secondary hydrogen abstraction as shown in Fig. 3. The barriers of first and second hydrogen abstraction are calculated to be 1.15, 1.23 eV and 1.18, 1.34 eV on pathway primary–secondary and secondary–primary hydrogen abstraction as shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b), respectively. The barriers of first and second hydrogen abstraction were quite close to each other. It is identified that surface oxygen is the active site to abstract hydrogen. By direct comparison of the barriers, chromium oxide is less active than a platinum catalyst. During C–H bond activation, propane molecules proceed via a heterolytic dissociation to form H+ and C3H7− as revealed from charge analysis. The hydrogen atoms generated in the process of propane dehydrogenation to propylene can be directly combined to form a hydrogen molecule as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†).
Fig. 3 Upper panel: the reaction pathway of propane dehydrogenation without or with CO2, and the barrier is indicated in eV: (a) primary–secondary hydrogen abstraction; (b) secondary–primary hydrogen abstraction. Lower panel: the key structures along a pathway of propane dehydrogenation without CO2. The structures of propane dehydrogenation with CO2 are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†).
3.2.2 Dehydrogenation with the presence of CO2 The most intriguing question regarding CO2 in propane dehydrogenation is in which way CO2 participated in hydrogen abstraction. To resolve this issue, the propane dehydrogenation pathway was investigated with the CO2 molecule either in physisorption or in chemisorption as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S6 (ESI†). The CO2 in different adsorption modes has distinct effects on hydrogen abstraction. For CO2 physisorption, the hydrogen abstraction barrier is similar to or even bigger than the counterparts without CO2. However, the CO2 chemisorption brought a decreased barrier particularly for the second hydrogen abstraction on a secondary–primary pathway which has a barrier of 1.21 eV. The counterpart is 1.34 eV without CO2.
On the other hand, there are also possibilities that CO2 can directly abstract hydrogen from C3H8 and C3H7 as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). In this scenario, two cases are under consideration. Firstly, CO2 in chemisorption is examined as the active species to break the C–H bond. For both C3H8 and C3H7, CO2 becomes an adsorbed carboxyl group after hydrogen abstraction. The calculated barrier of hydrogen abstraction from C3H8 and C3H7 is 1.27 and 1.07 eV, respectively. This is comparable with the counterparts at the surface oxygen site as shown in Fig. 3. Hence, CO2 in chemisorption indeed has the potential to be an active site for hydrogen abstraction. Moreover, the oxygen atom resulting from CO2 dissociation is tested for hydrogen abstraction too as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). Unfortunately, the calculated barriers are significantly bigger, which are 2.55 and 1.77 eV, respectively, for C3H8 and C3H7. Obviously, it cannot be a candidate for an active site for hydrogen abstraction.
3.3 Indirect role of CO2 in dehydrogenation
Besides the assistance of hydrogen abstraction, the other surface catalytic processes assisted by CO2 are also investigated. During dehydrogenation, the hydrogens abstracted from propane become surface hydroxyls. It is very important to remove hydroxyls to maintain the activity and stability of the catalysts. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†), both adsorbed CO2 and the dissociated CO2 (O* and CO*) are actively involved in this process. These species interact with surface hydroxyls and become hydrogenated to form COOH*, OH*, and COH* on the surface with a barrier of 0.93, 0.87, and 0.53 eV, respectively. Moreover, CO2 can interact with adsorbed hydrogen at the Cr site, which directly forms HCOO* without a barrier as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). However, it is noted that the diffusion barrier of hydrogen from the O site to the Cr site is calculated to be 1.03 eV. The removal of hydrogen shifted the equilibrium toward the products and increased the yield of propene.
Moreover, the feasibility of the reverse Boudouard reaction is explored as shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). It has been proposed that CO2 can help to remove coke via the reverse Boudouard reaction. In this reaction, CO2 reacted with carbon to form two CO molecules with a barrier of 2.01 eV. Therefore, it seems that CO2 does not contribute to coke removal in this way.
Another important aspect of CO2 is to refill the oxygen vacancy, which was created after water desorption. The re-oxidizing catalyst is a necessary step to maintain the catalytic cycle. As shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†), the insertion of CO2 is quite easy as expected. One of the oxygens in CO2 filled in the vacancy site, which also caused the breaking of the C–O bond with a barrier of 0.54 eV. The CO fragment from the C–O bond breaking binds at the neighboring Cr site around a vacancy. It is noted that this barrier is significantly lower than the barrier of water desorption from a surface, which is 1.53 eV, as shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†).
The above calculations indicated that CO2 does improve the catalytic capabilities of catalysts, particularly regarding the C–H bond activation. On the other hand, the deep dehydrogenation of propene is one of the major side reactions which lead to the decrease in selectivity. The reaction pathways of propene dehydrogenation with/without CO2 are explored as shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†). The calculations indicated that the barriers of hydrogen abstraction from propene are 1.77 and 1.70 eV, respectively, under CO2 or not. Therefore, deep dehydrogenation is inhibited by the presence of CO2.
3.4 Microkinetic modeling
To further reveal the mechanism and the influence of CO2 on the catalytic performance, microkinetic simulations based on DFT calculations are carried out. All kinetic parameters of relevant elementary steps were obtained from the DFT calculations as listed in Table 1. First of all, the TOF of propane consumption and propene formation is shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). For propane conversion, the TOF with CO2 present is always bigger than the counterpart without CO2 for the whole investigated temperature range (800–1200 K). The rise with CO2 present is more significant with increasing temperature. Interestingly, this positive correlation with temperature was also independently found in a previous experimental study.40 Similar to propane conversion, propene formation is also increased with CO2 as shown in Fig. 4(b), which is also experimentally validated.41–43 The increased reactivity with the inclusion of CO2 can be partly attributed to the reduced apparent activation energy as shown in Fig. 4(c). The activation energy is continuously decreased with increasing temperature, which is consistent with the TOF trend.

The most important catalytic step in the reaction was analyzed by DRC44 as shown in Fig. 5(a). For propane dehydrogenation without CO2, the DRC values of the primary and secondary hydrogen abstraction are 0.5 and 0.3, respectively, and the combinations of these two steps yield the majority influence on the reactivity of the reaction, which is understandable. On the other hand, hydrogen molecule desorption and hydrogen abstraction from C3H7 are much less, namely 0.07 and 0.13, respectively. The situation is changed with CO2 present. Still, the most influential steps are primary and secondary hydrogen abstraction. However, their DRC values are increased to be 0.72 and 0.27, respectively. Although CO2 does not change the critical steps, it influenced the reactivity of the catalyst. Therefore, the primary hydrogen abstraction is the rate-limiting step without/with CO2 dehydrogenation.

The partial pressure of propane and CO2 has an apparent influence on the reactivities. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the partial pressure ratio between propane and CO2 was continuously varied to indicate the influence. Before reaching factor 4, the TOF was sharply increased with the growing ratio. It continued with a very smooth change and reached a plateau. The increased ratios directly influence the coverage of species on the surface as shown in Table S2 (ESI†). It was found that the coverage of C3H8 and C3H7* is significantly enhanced with the increasing ratio, which explained the observed TOF variations. Moreover, the increase in propane partial pressure could push the reaction to products according to Le Chatelier's principle.
The reactant flow and main pathway are indicated in Fig. 6. The reactant flow analysis confirmed that the primary hydrogen abstraction has more weight than the secondary hydrogen abstraction. The propane molecule mainly follows the primary and secondary hydrogen abstraction route to form propene. Significant surface hydroxyls appeared during dehydrogenation as shown in Fig. 6. On the other hand, half of the adsorbed CO2 molecules participated in the removal of surface hydroxyls, which seems to be the most important pathway. O* species dissociated from CO2 are very active to react with surface hydroxyls to form OH*. The facile elimination of surface hydroxyls guarantees the active site recovery and pushes the equilibrium towards the product.

4. Conclusions
The current work provided a quantitative description of the role of CO2 in propane dehydrogenation on chromium oxide from a combined DFT and microkinetic simulation. The direct comparisons between dehydrogenation pathways with and without CO2 give an unbiased explanation of the positive role of CO2 in assisting hydrogen abstraction. Besides dehydrogenation, indirect involvements of CO2 in the reaction are also well discussed, which push the equilibrium towards the product side. Microkinetic modeling further elucidates the enhancement induced by CO2. The reactant flux analyses clearly indicated the major pathway that CO2 contributes to the reaction. It was noted that the outcome from the computational simulation is partly supported by experimental observation. The main findings from the current work are summarized as follows.
(1) The calculations indicated that CO2 being present is helpful to the C–H bond activation in propane. It was found that the chemisorbed CO2 reduces the barrier of hydrogen abstraction. Moreover, CO2 can also directly behave as the active site to abstract hydrogen and have a similar performance to the surface oxygen site, which has not been explored before.
(2) Besides hydrogen abstraction, the contribution from CO2 is also found in the removal of surface hydroxyls. O* and CO* from CO2 dissociation are identified to very effectively interact with H* which facilitates its desorption. Compared with conventional hydrogen or water formation routes, the pathway of CO2 assistance to eliminate hydroxyls is more favorable with a lower barrier. On the other hand, CO2 is unlikely involved in the reverse Boudouard reaction to remove coke considering the significant barrier found in the calculations.
(3) The most clear evidence of CO2 promotion effects is the increase of TOF in both propane conversion and propene formation as indicated from the microkinetic simulation. The increase is consistent with the decrease of the apparent activation energy. DRC analysis identified that the first hydrogen abstraction is the most critical step regardless of the CO2 presence. However, the presence of CO2 altered the DRC coefficients, which is another indication of the CO2 influence. Moreover, reactant flux analyses demonstrated that the majority of CO2 participated in the removal of surface hydroxyls in the reaction.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
