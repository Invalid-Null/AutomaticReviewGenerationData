Cobalt on dealuminated-Siβ as a catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
The present work aims at investigating the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) catalytic properties of Co species supported on a Siβ zeolitic support. The Co2+ species incorporated in the silanol nests created by dealumination of a HAlSiβ pristine support (Co-Siβ) appeared to be about 4 times more active (3.1 × 10-3 s-1) compared with that in exchange position of HAlSiβ (0.9 ×10-3 s-1) for the formation of propene at 400 °C. The turn over frequency of the Co-Siβ samples are found to be greater than or equal to those reported in most of the earlier studies performed with Co-containing materials to date and to be about 7 times greater than that of V-Siβ materials (0.4 ×10-3 s-1) from an earlier study, which illustrates the superiority of Co-Siβ over V-Siβ for the ODHP reaction. Maximum incorporable content of Co as Co-Siβ is dictated by the amount of removable Al.
1. Introduction
Propene (C3H6) is known as an essential platform chemical molecule for the production of polypropylene (60 %), acrylonitrile (9 %), oxo alcohol (8 %), propylene oxide (7 %), cumene (6 %) and acrylic acid (4 %) [1]. The industrial production of propene is essentially achieved by steam reforming and fluid catalytic cracking of oil fractions [2], [3], [4], [5]. The production of propene via the latter processes does not meet the market demand, however, which is known as the so-called propylene gap [5], [6]. The shale gas resources, comprising substantial amounts of ethane and propane, and the propylene gap renewed the interest in the valorization of propane to propylene. To meet the ever-increasing propene demand, about 110 million metric tons in 2018 [3], [7], the propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) process has been industrialized [8]. Such a process obviously produces propene with the highest selectivity [7] and needs to be operated at relatively high temperatures, however, due the endothermicity of the dehydrogenation reaction [9], which makes it relatively energy intensive [8]. Another major drawback of the PDH process is related to the deactivation of the catalysts at such elevated temperatures with the deposition of carbonaceous species [8], which remediation requires periodic calcination of these deposits at high temperatures before a reduction step to regenerate the PtSn alloys [10].
Alternative processes are therefore sought for the production of propene in a more sustainable way, such as that of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) [1], [2], [3], [4]. This non-thermodynamically restricted exothermic process is favorably operated at lower temperatures and should be less sensitive to coke deposition because of the presence of oxygen in the reacting feed compared with the PDH process [1], [2], [3], [4]. One major drawback of ODHP lies in the lower selectivity in propene compared to PDH due to overoxidation of propane and/or propene by oxygen by side reactions, which severely limits the industrial application of ODHP [2], [8].
Many efforts have been devoted to the study of ODHP catalysts for which metal-oxide based materials have been reported to be most active [4] before boron-containing materials showed promising properties rather recently [11], [12]. Over metal-oxide catalysts, ODHP has been shown to proceed via a Mars and van Krevelen mechanism [13] in which lattice oxygen species of the catalyst is involved in the oxidation process of the propane molecule, with the oxygen vacancies created by water release being replenished by molecular oxygen. The nature of the reacting oxygen species has been suggested to be of prime importance in this reaction for the selectivity in propene. The nucleophilic oxygen species were thus suggested to be much more selective for partial oxidation of propane compared with the electrophilic counterparts that lead to undesired combustion of propane/propene to COx (CO + CO2) [3], [4], [14]. For metal-oxide based catalysts, those including vanadium [15], [16] have been shown to be among the most active in the ODHP reaction [14]. The nature of the supporting oxide [1] and the dispersion of V [3] have been shown to exhibit a drastic influence on the ODHP catalytic performance. Not only the nature of environment of the transition metal is important for ODHP but also the nature of the transition metal in itself. Several studies have reported on the promising properties of Co catalysts for the ODHP reaction indeed [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30].
Following the pioneering works of Saxton et al. [31], Kim et al. [32] and Kraushaar and Van Hooff [33], Dzwigaj et al. [34] have shown that incorporation of V could be done in the silanol nests [35] created by dealumination of an HAlSiβ pristine support. Later, it was shown that such V-Siβ catalysts exhibited similar ODHP performance as that reported for vanadium supported on various SiO2 supports [36]. Cobalt could also be inserted successfully in the silanol nests by Dzwigaj and co-workers [37], [38], [39], [40] to be applied in NO selective catalytic reduction by ethanol [41] and ammonia [42], [43], [44], N2O decomposition [42], dehydrochlorination [45] and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis [46], [47]. As far as we know, the performance of Co-Siβ samples has not been reported in the ODHP reaction. The present work therefore aims at investigating the catalytic properties of Co species located in various environments of a β zeolitic support and to compare the performance of such species with earlier literature data reported on Co-based catalysts. In particular, the influence of the pH of the impregnating aqueous solutions was studied on the incorporation of Co2+ species in Siβ.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The synthesis of the Cox-Siβ series of samples, which is schematically described in Ref. [40], was done via a slightly modified two-step post-synthesis method developed earlier for the preparation of V-Siβ materials [34], [48].
2.1.1. Preparation of the HAlSiβ and Siβ supports
Briefly, the tetraethyl-ammonium β pristine zeolite (TEAβ, SINOPEC-RIPP, China, Si/Al ∼ 14) was firstly calcined in a muffle furnace at 550 °C for 15 h to remove the TEA template and to produce the protonic form of the zeolite material (HAlSiβ). HAlSiβ (12 g) was then dealuminated in a nitric-acid solution (1 040 mL of concentrated HNO3 (Aldrich, 68 wt. % HNO3) with 160 mL of distilled water resulting in a nitric acid concentration of 13 mol/L) at 80 °C for 4 h. The suspension was then cooled to RT and the solid was filtered before being washed with distilled water. Finally, the dealuminated material (Siβ, Si/Al ∼ 400) was dried at 80 °C overnight in a laboratory oven.
2.1.2. Deposition of Co on Siβ
Deposition of Co was carried out by contacting 2 g of Siβ with 200 mL of Co(NO3)2 (Aldrich) aqueous solutions (from about 1.6–17.4 ×10-3 mol Co/L), either at pH 2.5 or 9.0, for 24 h under continuous stirring. The pH of these solutions was adjusted by adding drops of either concentrated nitric acid or ammonia solutions (Aldrich). Such a procedure led to Co loadings ranging from about 1–9 wt. %. It must be stressed that the addition of the Siβ support in the Co(NO3)2 aqueous solutions at pH 9.0 resulted in a rapid decrease in the pH of the suspensions to about pH 3.0. In that case, the pH of the suspensions was then adjusted to pH 9.0 by addition of concentrated ammonia. The suspensions were then transferred in a rotary evaporator and water was evaporated under vacuum at 70 °C for about 2 h. As the ODHP reaction was performed up to 500 °C (Section 2.3.), the samples were calcined in a muffle furnace at 500 °C (100 °C/h) for 3 h. These series of samples will be referred to as Cox-Siβ-pH-2.5 and Cox-Siβ-pH-9.0, respectively, where x represents the Co loading (wt. %).
2.1.3. Deposition of Co on HAlSiβ
For comparison, a sample including about 1.8 wt. % Co was also prepared by wet impregnation of the HSiAlβ support (Co1.8-HAlSiβ) by an aqueous solution of Co(NO3)2 following the same procedure as that described for the two previous series of samples but at pH 3.0.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
ICP-OES, XPS and H2-TPR investigations were performed on the samples submitted to NO-TPD non-destructive experiments.
The chemical composition of the samples was ascertained by ICP-OES (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy) using a 5100 SVDV spectrometer (Agilent) at the Plateforme ALIPP6 Laboratoire d’Analyse Géochimie Elémentaire (Sorbonne Université). The samples (50 mg) were firstly digested in a mixture of 1 mL of concentrated HF (Normatom, 47 wt. %) and 1 mL of concentrated HNO3 (68 wt. %) at 80 °C for 2 h. Excess HF was then “neutralized” by 50 mL of an aqueous solution of H3BO3 (20 g/L) by complexation of the fluorides. The obtained solution was finally diluted with a diluted HNO3 aqueous solution if necessary. Appropriate calibration mixtures were also used.
XP spectra were collected on an Omicron Scienta (Argus) X-ray photoelectron spectrometer using a monochromated Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) radiation source having a 280 W electron beam power. Charge compensation was carried out using an electron beam having an energy of 1 eV and an emission current of 5 µA. The emission of photoelectrons from the sample was analyzed at a takeoff angle of 45 ° under ultrahigh vacuum conditions (1 × 10-7 Pa). XP spectra were collected at a pass energy of 20 eV for C 1s, O 1s, Si 2p, Al 2p and Co 2p core XPS levels. After data collection, because of the known difficulties in referencing the binding energies (BEs) to the C 1s line [49], the BEs were calibrated with respect to the BE of the Si 2p peak (FWHM ∼ 1.8 eV) at 103.3 eV [44], [50], [51]. All of the BEs reported in this work were measured within an accuracy of ± 0.2 eV. The peak areas were determined after subtraction of a Tougaard background. The atomic ratio calculations were performed after normalization using Scofield factors [52]. Spectrum processing was carried out using the Casa XPS software package and Origin 7.1 (Origin Lab Corporation). The Co3.0Siβ-pH-2.5 and Co3.1Siβ-pH-9.0 samples were also analyzed by XPS after ODHP reaction.
Temperature-Programmed Reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR) experiments were performed by using a Micromeretics 2920 equipment. 40–50 mg of the sample was introduced in the U-type reactor on a plug of quartz wool and submitted to oxidation under 25 mL/min O2(5 %)/He from RT to 500 °C (10 °C/min) and maintained at 500 °C for 1 h. It was found that the samples did not exhibit any oxidation contribution (Fig. S1), indicating that previous NO-TPD experiments did not lead to the reduction of the Co species. The samples were then cooled to RT under the O2(5%)/He flow. After purging by Ar (25 mL/min), the samples were submitted to H2-TPR under 25 mL/min H2(5 %)/He from RT to 900 °C (10 °C/min) and left at this temperature for 2 h. Water release in H2-TPR experiments was trapped with an isopropanol-liquid N2 mixture prior to the TCD detector.
NO Temperature-Programmed Desorption (NO-TPD) experiments were carried out in a U-shape quartz reactor (10 mm i.d.). The samples (about 0.12 g) were held on a plug of quartz wool and the temperature was controlled by a Eurotherm 2408 temperature controller using a K-type thermocouple. Reactant gases (Air Liquide) were used as received and fed from independent gas cylinders by means of mass flow controllers (Brooks 5850TR) with a total flow rate of 230 mLNTP/min. The reactor outlet was continuously monitored by chemiluminescence NOx analyzers (Thermo Environmental Instruments 42C-HL or Eco Physics CLD 700 AL) that allowed the simultaneous detection of NO and NO2 (NOx = NO + NO2). Prior to the NO-TPD experiments, the samples were annealed in situ in He or Ar at 500 °C (3 °C/min) for 2 h under a flow rate of 100 mLNTP/min. Following the in-situ annealing treatment, the samples were exposed to the adsorption mixture that consisted of 400 ppm NO diluted in He or Ar. The samples were exposed to the adsorption mixture at RT for about 2 h until the outlet NOx readout was equivalent to the inlet NOx readout. The latter parameter was set to ensure that each sample was saturated under the present experimental conditions. Before the NO-TPD step, the samples were flushed in He or Ar at RT for about 1 h to remove weakly chemisorbed species until the NO and NO2 concentrations detected at the outlet of the reactor were found to be negligible. NO-TPD experiments were carried out from RT to about 500 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C/min under a flow of 230 mLNTP/min of He or Ar. It was checked on two aliquots of Co1.0Siβ-pH-2.5 that both NOx analyzers provided similar NOx-TPD profiles (Fig. 1) and NOx uptakes (105 and 102 µmol/g). It must be noted that only traces of NO2 were detected over the Cox-Siβ-pH-2.5 and Cox-Siβ-pH-9.0 series, whereas significant quantities of NO2 were recorded over HAlSiβ and Co1.8-HAlSiβ, the origin of which may be attributed to NO disproportionation (3 NO = N2O + NO2) [53].

2.3. ODHP catalytic experiments
Prior to the catalytic runs, the Cox-Siβ-pH-2.5, Cox-Siβ-pH-9.0 and Co1.8-HAlSiβ samples (∼ 20 µmol of Co) diluted in 0.6 g of α-Al2O3 (125–200 µm, Aldrich) were calcined in O2 (2.2 %)–He (65.1 mLNTP/min) at 500 °C (2 °C/min) for 3 h unless specified otherwise. The temperature was then decreased to 400 °C. The ODHP experiments were carried out in a U-type quartz reactor (10 mm i.d.). The samples were held on a plug of quartz wool, and the temperature was controlled by a Eurotherm 2408 temperature controller using a K type thermocouple. Reactant gases (Air Liquide, used as received) were fed from independent mass flow controllers (Brooks 5850TR and Bronkhorst F-201CV-200-RAD-11-V). Typically, the composition of the C3H8-O2-He (4.3–1.0–47.3) reaction mixture was: 8.2 % C3H8 and 1.9 % O2 in He with a total gas flow of 74.1 mLNTP/min. The catalyst was contacted with the reaction mixture at 400 °C and the temperature was increased by steps of 25 °C (5 °C/min) up to 500 °C for about 1 h 30 at each reaction step at atmospheric pressure. After reaction at 500 °C for 1 h 30, the catalyst was cooled to 400 °C under the reaction mixture. Analysis of the composition of the reactor outflow was performed on-line with a μ-GC (Varian, CP4900) using three different columns running in parallel. The 5 A molecular sieve column (80 oC, 150 kPa He, 200 ms injection time, 30 s backflush time) was used to separate H2, O2, CH4 and CO. The poraplot Q column (100 °C, 150 kPa He, 50 ms injection time, 6 s backflush time), was used to separate CO2, C2H4, C2H6, H2O, C3H6 and C3H8. The CP-SIL5 column (45 °C, 150 kPa He, 50 ms injection time) was used to separate C3H6O compounds (acetone + propenal) from C3H4O (acrolein).
The conversion of C3H8 (X C3H8) and the product selectivities (S Ai) were calculated as follows:
X C3H8 (%) = (Σni [Ai] / (3 x [C3H8]inlet)) x 100
S Ai (%) = (ni [Ai] / Σni [Ai]) x 100
where ni, [Ai] and [C3H8]inlet are the number of carbon atoms in the Ai products, the concentrations of the Ai products, and the inlet concentration of propane, respectively.
For comparison with earlier literature data, the formation of C3H6 in the ODHP catalytic reaction was calculated as turnover frequencies (TOFs) [54] normalized by the total number of Co atoms such as:
TOF (s-1) = (([C3H6] x F) / (100 x Vm)) / (sw x %Co) / (100 x MCobalt)),
Where [C3H6], F, Vm, sw, %Co and MCobalt are the concentration in C3H6 at the outlet of the reactor (%), the total flow rate (mL s-1) at 0 °C and 101 325 Pa, the molar volume (22 414 mL mol-1) at 0 °C and 101 325 Pa, the sample weight (g), the Co content (wt. %) and the atomic weight of Co (58.933 g mol-1), respectively.
Under the present experimental conditions, it was checked that the reactor loaded with 0.6 g of α-Al2O3 did not contribute to the transformation of C3H8 to a significant extent at 400 °C (Fig. S2) and that both C3H8 and O2 conversions measured at 400 °C varied proportionally to the amount of sample loaded in the reactor, indicating the absence of external limitations. The carbon and oxygen balances were found to be above 98 % and 90 %, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Speciation of Co in the impregnating solutions
The speciation of Co in the aqueous medium was computed [55] as a function of the pH of the aqueous medium (by addition of HNO3 or NH3) for the lowest (Fig. 2a) and the greatest (Fig. 2b) Co concentrations used for the preparation of the materials. As illustrated in Fig. 2a, Co remains as Co(H2O)62+ species up to pH 8.0. At higher pH, the precipitation of Co(OH)2 occurs in agreement with an earlier literature report [56]. Co(OH)2 appears to be the dominant species up to about pH 11 before the appearance of various Co amine complexes at higher pH. A comparable trend is observed for the highest Co concentration (Fig. 2b) with a shift of the Co(OH)2 precipitation frontier to lower pH, however. Overall, it can be deduced from Fig. 2 that Co should be essentially present as Co(H2O)62+ at pH 2.5, whereas it should precipitate to Co(OH)2 at pH 9.0 for all of the Co concentrations used in the present work for the preparation of the materials.

3.2. Characterization of the samples
XRD, 1H, 27Al and 29Si MAS NMR, FTIR and DR-UV–vis complementary data recorded on selected samples can be found in an another article [40]. Briefly, it was found that dealumination of the HAlSiβ pristine support led to a contraction of the zeolite structure (XRD), a significant decrease in the intensity of the 27Al NMR signals and an increase in that of the 1H NMR signals, and an increase in the intensity of the OH IR contributions in agreement with earlier studies [34], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47]. These data corroborated the extraction of the framework Al species under strongly acidic conditions and the corresponding formation of silanol nests in the dealuminated Siβ support. The addition of Co to the dealuminated Siβ support led to an expansion of the zeolite structure (XRD) [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47] and a pronounced decrease in the intensity of the 1H NMR signals [47] and the OH IR contributions [37], [38], [39], [40], [42], [47], attesting for the incorporation of Co2+ ions into the Siβ framework and the formation of various Co species as indicated by DR-UV–vis spectroscopy [37], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [57].
3.2.1. Chemical composition ascertained by ICP-OES
The chemical composition of the samples deduced from ICP-OES analyses (Table 1) shows that the amount of Co deposited agrees reasonably with that targeted. The Si/Al ratio of the pristine support HAlSiβ was found to be about 14 in agreement with the expected value (Section 2.1.), whereas those of the dealuminated Siβ and Cox-Siβ samples increased to 380 and 500 ± 40, respectively. The lower Si/Al ratio of the Siβ support (380) compared to those of the Cox-Siβ materials (500 ± 40) may be attributed to further dealumination of the Siβ support in the course of the deposition step of Co that was performed at low and high pH for 24 h (Section 2.1.). Dealumination of the pristine HAlSiβ support has been reported to result in the creation of silanol nests in the Siβ structure [34], [36], [37], [38], [39].

The binding energies (BEs) of the O 1s, C 1s, Al 2p and Co 2p3/2 core levels of the samples are summarized in Table 2. The narrow peak (FWHM ∼ 1.7 eV) of the O 1s core level with a fairly constant BE (∼ 532.5 eV) can be attributed to O2- species from the Siβ crystalline network [51], [58], [59].

Absence of Al 2p signal measurable under the conditions used.
The presence of adventitious carbon was also detected on all samples at 283.8–284.9 eV (13 ± 1 at. %). The fact that the BE of C 1s core level varied by about 1 eV may be attributed to imperfect compensation of the local charging of the non-conductive materials despite the use of a flood gun, which provides support for using the Si 2p (Fig. S3) as a reference rather than adventitious carbon [49].
Al 2p peaks (74.5 eV, FWHM ∼ 2.2 eV) attributed to Al3+ species [51], [59] could only be observed on the non-dealuminated HAlSiβ and Co1.8-HAlSiβ samples in agreement with other XPS measurements [40]. The surface Si/Al at. ratio of the non-dealuminated samples (Table 2) was found to be in good agreement with the bulk Si/Al ratio determined by ICP-OES (Table 1), indicating that Al was homogeneously distributed in the HAlSiβ pristine material. Given that residual amounts of Al could be measured by ICP-OES on the dealuminated Siβ samples (Table 1), the absence of Al 2p signal on these samples may be assigned to the presence of residual Al atoms in the core of the dealuminated Siβ grains whose Al 2p core level signal would be screened by the silicon atoms of the outer layers. This suggests that dealumination of the pristine HAlSiβ support was easier to achieve on the outer layers of the zeolite grains rather than in their cores. The presence of residual Al found by ICP-OES in the dealuminated Siβ samples appears to be consistent with the presence of an 27Al MAS NMR peak at 51–54 ppm [40], [47] characteristic of tetrahedrally coordinated Al3+ species in the Siβ zeolite framework.
The Co 2p core level showed essentially the characteristic spin-orbit doublet (Co 2p1/2 at ca. 797 eV and Co 2p3/2 at ca. 781 eV, Table 2) with shake-up satellites at about 803 and 786 eV (Fig. S3), indicating the presence of Co2+ species in the prepared samples. Whereas the BE of the Co 2p3/2 signal remained essentially constant and close to 781.3 eV on the Cox-Siβ series prepared at pH 2.5 and 9.0 (Table 2), it is of interest to notice that the BE of the Co 2p3/2 signal of Co1.8-HAlSiβ appeared to be recorded at a substantially higher BE (782.5 eV, Table 2). In agreement with the earlier study of Boix and Fierro, performed over various zeolitic matrixes [60], such an elevated BE is consistent with the presence of Co2+ species acting as charge compensation cations on the non-dealuminated pristine support. The Co 2p3/2/Si 2p surface at. ratios are plotted as a function of the bulk Co/Si at. ratios deduced from ICP-OES in Fig. 3. This figure firstly shows that the Co 2p3/2/Si 2p surface at. ratios are much smaller than the bulk ones over all of the investigated samples in line with an earlier study [44]. Such a discrepancy may be accounted for by a screening effect of the Co signal by the Si atoms from the β zeolite network. In addition, it can be seen that the Co 2p3/2/Si 2p surface at. ratio varies reasonably linearly with respect to the bulk one over the whole range of compositions of the investigated samples, which indicates that the dispersion state of the Co atoms remained essentially comparable over the various series of samples from an XPS viewpoint.

3.2.3. H2-TPR
The H2-TPR profiles on both series of samples are shown in Fig. 4. The Cox-Siβ-pH-2.5 samples showed essentially a reduction peak at high temperature at about 800 °C (Fig. 4a). A shoulder also appeared at about 730 °C for Co5.6-Siβ-pH-2.5 (arrow in Fig. 4a) and the reduction of the samples including a Co loading greater than or equal to 1.9 wt. % was found to begin at lower temperature (∼ 700 °C) compared to that of Co1.1-Siβ-pH-2.5 (∼ 770 °C, Fig. 4a). The Cox-Siβ-pH-9.0 samples showed a reduction peak at about 800 °C as well (Fig. 4b). For the most highly loaded samples (Co content greater than or equal to 4.3 wt. %), a reduction peak is also observed at about 330 °C. As also reported in [40], the Co1.8-HAlSiβ sample did not exhibit any H2 reduction feature (Fig. S4), indicating that the Co2+ species on charge compensation sites did not reduce below 900 °C [45], [61], [62], [63]. On the Cox-Siβ series, the high-temperature peak can therefore be assigned to the reduction of framework pseudo-tetrahedral Co(II) species in strong interaction with the Siβ support [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], whereas that at about 330 °C can be assigned to the reduction of Co3O4 crystallites. Yet these Co3O4 crystallites could not be detected by XRD on Co4.3Siβ-pH-9 [40] likely because of being too small and/or in low amount [61]. The consumption of H2 in the H2-TPR experiments amounted to be about 72 ± 21 % of the Co content (Fig. 4), as already reported earlier on similar samples [42]. At the lower contents of Co, the high-temperature reduction peak appears to be incomplete, in other words the signal does not return to baseline, and this may be at the origin of an underestimation of the amount of Co reduced in the H2-TPR experiments.

It must be noted that the H2-TPR profile could not be recorded on Co9.3-Siβ-pH-2.5 because of an experimental issue in the course of the H2-TPR experiment on the last aliquot of the corresponding sample.
3.2.4. NOx-TPD
Earlier studies have reported on the interaction of NO with Co2+ species on various zeolitic materials and the use of temperature-programmed desorption experiments as a tool to characterize these materials [43], [64], [65], [66]. Under the present experimental conditions, it was found that the dealuminated support (Siβ) did not chemisorb NO (Fig. S5) in agreement with previous studies performed on various silica materials [67], [68], [69]. In contrast, the HAlSiβ pristine carrier exhibited two desorption peaks at 100 and 320 °C (Fig. 5a) in agreement with the earlier work of Dzwigaj and co-workers [43]. The greater NO uptake of HAlSiβ (65 µmol/g), determined from the profile shown in Fig. 5a (purple trace), compared to that reported previously (8 µmol/g, [43]) can be attributed to differences in adsorption temperatures [66]. The marked difference in NO uptake between Siβ and HAlSiβ demonstrates that the presence of Al is instrumental in the chemisorption of NO on a Co-free sample and makes more complicated the estimation of the NO uptake by the Co2+ species, and the corresponding NO/Co ratio, for Co1.8HAlSiβ. Fig. 5a shows that the addition of Co to HAlSiβ leads to a significant increase in the amount of NO desorbed (195 µmol/g, gray trace) compared to that of the pristine HAlSiβ support (65 µmol/g, purple trace). This indicates that NO also interacted with the Co2+ exchanged species of Co1.8-HAlSiβ to a significant extent. The chemical composition of Co1.8-HAlSiβ (Table 1) indicates that about 63 % of the protons have been exchanged by the Co2+ species (Co/Al ∼ 0.31) on such sample. Considering this together with (i) the amount of NO desorbed from this sample (195 µmol/g) and that from the pristine HAlSiβ support (65 µmol/g) and (ii) assuming that Co2+-charge-compensated AlO- sites did no longer contribute to NO desorption from the HAlSiβ support, the NO/Co molar ratio can be estimated to be about 0.56 for Co1.8-HAlSiβ.

(d) NO uptakes deduced from the corresponding NO-TPD profiles and (e) NO/Co ratios for Cox-Siβ-pH-2.5 and Cox-Siβ-pH-9.0 samples.
Finally, the NO-TPD profile recorded on Co1.8-HAlSiβ (Fig. 5a, grey trace) does not resemble any of the TPD profiles described in earlier studies [64], [65], [66], [70]. This may be attributed to differences in the TPD experimental conditions and/or to the nature of the studied samples. In addition, small amounts of NO2 were also observed in the course of the NO-TPD experiments performed on HAlSiβ and Co1.8-HAlSiβ at 130 and 220 °C, respectively. The formation of NO2 may be due to NO disproportionation (3 NO = NO2 + N2O), as suggested previously by Addison and Barrer on Na-zeolites [53].
Regarding the Co samples prepared with the dealuminated support (Fig. 5b,c, Cox-Siβ-pH-2.5 and Cox-Siβ-pH-9.0 series), the desorbed species can be attributed exclusively to NO interacting with the Co2+ species, as it was found that the Siβ bare support did not chemisorb NO (Fig. S5). The TPD profiles recorded on both series showed a main NO desorption peak at about 80 °C and two additional contributions of much weaker intensity at about 200 and 330 °C. On a comparable sample (Co(PS)SiBEA), Dzwigaj and co-workers [43] reported only one NO desorption peak at 190 °C, which is not inconsistent with the NO-TPD profiles reported in the present work. Firstly, it must be highlighted that the adsorption step on Co(PS)SiBEA was carried out at 70 °C [43], thus at a temperature close to that for which the main desorption peak was observed in the present study (Fig. 5b,c), which would explain the absence of such contribution in the work of Dzwigaj and co-workers [43]. Secondly, the contribution of weak intensity observed at 200 °C (Fig. 5b,c) is consistent with that observed earlier at 190 °C by Dzwigaj and co-workers [43]. Thirdly, given that the contribution at 330 °C is generally of weaker intensity than that at 200 °C (Fig. 5b,c), such a contribution may have remained below detection limits in the work of Dzwigaj and co-workers [43]. Definitive assignment of the observed NO contributions (Fig. 5b,c) remains uncertain. Earlier studies performed on similar Co-Siβ materials have shown essentially the formation of dinitrosyl complexes with NO adsorption followed by FTIR [38], [43]. In particular, Mihaylova et al. have reported that two different Co2+(NO)2 dinitrosyls were formed on Co-Siβ [38]. Over an exchanged Co-ZSM-5 material, Zhang et al. have showed that the decomposition temperatures of two Co dinitrosyl complexes was strongly dependent on the nature of the dinitrosyl complex [70]. The multiple NO peaks observed in the NO-TPD experiments (Fig. 5b,c) may therefore be attributed to the decomposition of various dinitrosyls, and the potential decomposition of mononitrosyls [38] in the Cox-Siβ materials. Additional work would obviously be needed to ascertain such assumptions.
The NO uptakes deduced from the NO-TPD profiles (Fig. 5b,c) are displayed in Fig. 5d. Overall, it can be seen that the NO uptakes are similar on both series of Cox-Siβ of samples and therefore that the pH at which Co was deposited did not exhibit a significant influence on the dispersion of the Co species for comparable Co loadings. The NO/Co ratios estimated from the amounts of NO desorbed are plotted in Fig. 5e. The NO/Co ratios of the most lowly loaded samples of both series (Co1.1-Siβ-pH-2.5: NO/Co = 0.56 and Co0.9-Siβ-pH-9.0: NO/Co = 0.43), for which the highest dispersion of the Co2+ species may be assumed, are found to be comparable to that found for Co2+ cations on exchanged position of Co1.8-HAlSiβ (NO/Co = 0.56). This suggests that the NO adsorption properties of the Co2+ species supported on the dealuminated Siβ support should not be affected to a significant extent compared to those of the Co2+ cations in exchanged position present in Co1.8-HAlSiβ. The fact that the NO/Co ratios are found to be much lower than that expected with the formation of dinitrosyls [38], which still remains unclear at the present stage, therefore prevents the use of the NO-TPD data for a quantitative determination of the Co dispersion on the samples. Yet these data can be used to compare the dispersion of Co in the studied materials from a qualitative viewpoint. Within each series of samples, namely Cox-Siβ-pH-2.5 or Cox-Siβ-pH-9.0, Fig. 5e shows that the NO/Co ratio decreases as the Co content increases, as also reported by Gutierrez et al. [65] on various Co/mordenite materials. The decrease in NO/Co ratio (Fig. 5e) can be attributed to a decrease in the dispersion of the Co species as the Co content increases with the formation of CoxOy species [65]. Overall, the NO uptakes obtained in the present study are found to be lower than those reported on Co-zeolite materials in previous studies [64], [65], [66], [70]. This probably relies both on differences in the studied materials and the experimental conditions under which the NO-TPD experiments were performed. In these earlier studies, the NO-TPD experiments have been carried out on various zeolite supports such as ZSM5 [64], [70], Y [64], [66], [70], Mordenite [64], [65], [70] and β [66]. Li and Armor have reported that the nature of the zeolite support was decisive for the chemisorption of NO when exchanged by Co2+ ions [64]. In addition, part of the NO uptakes has been recorded on H-zeolite supports [64], [65], [66], whereas it was shown in the present study that the presence of protons in the zeolite support increased the NO uptake to a significant extent (Fig. 5a). Finally, the NO partial pressures used in these earlier studies were much higher (1000–2000 ppm NO) than that used in the present study (400 ppm), and this parameter has been suggested to influence the NO/Co stoichiometry [64].
Overall, the characterization of the Cox-Siβ series of samples performed by H2-TPR (Section 3.2.3.) and NO-TPD (Section 3.2.4.) seems to indicate that Co(II) species (XPS, Section 3.2.2.) may be involved in various environments depending on the Co loading. Yet the quantification of the various Co species has been reported to be extremely challenging in the case of Co2+-exchanged HAlSiβ materials [71].
3.3. ODHP catalytic results
Prior to evaluation of the Co samples, the thermal reaction between C3H8 and O2 was probed in a reactor loaded with 600 mg of α-Al2O3 (Fig. S2). C3H8 conversion, increasing from 0.1 to 1.0 % from 400 to 500 °C, was found to be mainly due to the complete oxidation of propane to carbon oxides (COx = CO + CO2) with a selectivity of about 80 ± 3 % in the latter by-products. Traces of methane, ethane, ethylene, acetone/propenal and acroleine were observed above 450 °C, whereas detectable amounts of H2 were recorded above 475 °C. The formation of C3H6 was also recorded and found to increase from 12 to about 220 ppm from 400 to 500 °C, resulting in a C3H6 selectivity of about 14 ± 2 %. As the thermally assisted formation of C3H6 was found to be limited at 400 °C, comparison of the catalytic performance of the various samples was made at such a temperature. Finally, the conversion of O2 increased from 2 to 22 % as the reaction temperature increased from 400 to 500 °C.
Bian et al. have reported recently that highly dispersed tetrahedrally coordinated Co(II) species, stabilized on a mesoporous silica, efficiently catalyzed the direct dehydrogenation of C3H8 (PDH) at 600 °C [72]. Although PDH has been reported to remain thermodynamically disfavored below about 550 °C [56], Davis and co-workers [73], and Wang et al. [74] showed that such a reaction could be catalyzed at 500 and 550 °C by Co(II) single-sites supported on N-doped carbon and ordered SiO2 channels, respectively. By removing O2 from the ODHP reacting feed at 400 °C, it was verified that PDH did not contribute to the production of C3H6 to a significant extent under our conditions on Co3.0-Siβ-pH-2.5 and Co3.1-Siβ-pH-9.0 (Fig. S6), however.
O2, COx and C3H6 concentrations, and C3H8 conversion are displayed in Fig. 6 as a function of time on stream and reaction temperature for the catalysts loaded with about 2 wt. % Co. As expected, C3H8 conversion, COx and C3H6 concentrations increased, whereas O2 concentration decreased as the reaction temperature increased for all of the samples. Fig. 6 shows that the catalyst prepared from the HAlSiβ pristine support (Co1.8-HAlSiβ, Fig. 6c) appeared to be the least active sample among the samples containing about 2 wt. % Co. By comparing the initial C3H8 conversion at 400 °C with that recorded at 400 °C after reaction at 500 °C, Co1.9-Siβ-pH-2.5 (Fig. 6a) and Co1.8-HAlSiβ (Fig. 6c) appeared to have suffered from deactivation after reaction at 500 °C by about 22 % and 25 %, respectively (Table 3). Deactivation of theses samples could be observed from 400 to 475 °C and from 475 to 500 °C for Co1.9-Siβ-pH-2.5 (Fig. 6a) and Co1.8-HAlSiβ (Fig. 6c), respectively. In contrast, Co2.2-Siβ-pH-9.0 was found to be activated (Fig. 6b) by about 13 % after reaction at 500 °C (Table 3). Except Co1.1-Siβ-pH-2.5, which was found be stable, the other samples of the Cox-Siβ-pH-2.5 series were found to deactivate after reaction at 500 °C (Table 3). C3H8 conversion at 400 °C after reaction at 500 °C was found to be close to 3 % with a selectivity in C3H6 of about 50 % for a Co content lower than or equal to 3.0 wt. % in the Cox-Siβ-pH-2.5 series. Above this Co loading, the conversion of C3H8 was found to decrease substantially and the selectivity in C3H6 was found to decrease at the highest Co loading (9.3 wt. %) only. Similar trends were also observed for the Cox-Siβ-pH-9.0 series (Table 3), except that C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity appeared to remain essentially constant up to a higher Co loading (4.3 wt. %) compared to the Cox-Siβ-pH-2.5 series (3.0 wt. %). It can be noticed that C3H6 selectivity increased substantially for catalysts exhibiting a deactivation greater than or equal to 16 % in the Cox-Siβ series (Table 3). This increase in C3H6 selectivity cannot be attributed to a significant increase in the production of C3H6 (Table 4). A close inspection of the evolution of the COx concentration with time on stream for Co1.9-Siβ-pH-2.5 (Fig. 6a) shows that the increase in C3H6 selectivity from 36 % to 47 % (Table 3) was mainly due to a significant decrease in the production of COx after reaction at 500 °C, as the concentration of C3H6 was found to remain essentially constant (Fig. 6a, Table 3). The sintering of part of the Co species could be ruled out as the origin of the decrease in COx production after ODHP reaction at 500 °C since the XPS Co/Si at. ratios of Co3.0Siβ-pH-2.5 (Co/Si = 0.0099) and Co3.1Siβ-pH-9.0 (Co/Si = 0.0118) were found to remain essentially constant after ODHP reaction (0.0107 and 0.0122, respectively). It must also be noticed that increasing amounts of H2, most probably produced via the water-gas shift reaction [75], were recorded with increasing temperatures on all of the samples investigated in the present study, as also reported in earlier studies ([2] and references therein). In the present study, the production of H2 could be recorded even if complete conversion of O2 was not always achieved. In contrast, the production of H2 on V-Siβ catalysts may be attributed to the occurrence of the PDH reaction as H2 could only be observed at temperatures for which full O2 conversion was achieved [36]. More recently, some of us also recorded the production of H2 in the ODHP reaction over V-modified hydroxyapatite catalysts at temperatures for which full conversion of O2 was not achieved [76]. In this latter study, the occurrence of the PDH reaction could be discarded since the removal of O2 from the reacting feed led to almost complete disappearance of C3H6 in the effluent, as is also the case over the Cox-Siβ materials prepared in the present study (Fig. S6). The concentration of H2 at 500 °C was found to be about 0.7 % for the Cox-Siβ-pH-2.5 samples containing from 1.1 to 5.6 wt. % of Co, whereas Co9.3-Siβ-pH-2.5 produced 0.06 % of H2 only. The amounts of H2 produced on the Cox-Siβ-pH-9.0 series were found to be slightly higher than those found on the Cox-Siβ-pH-2.5 series, whereas that produced on Co1.8-HAlSiβ was much lower (0.2 %). These data show that the samples were exposed to hydrogen at relatively high temperatures in the course of the ODHP reaction. The significant increase in C3H6 selectivity observed for samples exhibiting a deactivation greater than or equal to 16 % (Table 3), which is essentially attributed to a significant decrease in COx production after reaction at 500 °C (Fig. 6a), may be attributed to changes in the oxidation state and/or coking of some Co species (probably present in small quantities) under the experimental conditions of the ODHP reaction, such as CoOx species that have been reported to be fairly active in the oxidation of propane [77].

After reaction at 500 °C, the ODHP catalytic activity of Co1.9-Siβ-pH-2.5 was recorded at 400, 375 and 350 °C before being measured once more at 400 °C (Fig. S7). The fact that the catalytic activity recorded at 400 °C after measurements at 375 and 350 °C was found to be identical to that recorded at 400 °C after reaction at 500 °C indicates that the measurements were performed on a stabilized catalytic sample. The apparent activation energies for the production of C3H6 and COx were estimated to be about 87 and 108 kJ/mol, respectively, from the corresponding Arrhenius plots in the 350–400 °C temperature domain (Fig. S8). The fact that the apparent activation energy for the production of C3H6 is consistent with earlier data for this reaction [36] suggests that the rate measurements were performed in a kinetic regime free of diffusion limitation. The turnover frequencies (TOFs), normalized by the total number of Co atoms (Section 2.3.) and determined at 400 °C after reaction at 500 °C, are listed in Table 5. This table shows firstly that Co1.8-HAlSiβ was the least active sample (0.86 x 10-3 s-1) of the investigated catalysts. Moreover, it can be seen that the TOFs remained essentially constant and close to 3.07 ± 0.45 x 10-3 s-1 for samples with Co loadings below 5 wt. % for both Cox-Siβ series, and were found to decrease at Co loadings higher than 3.0 and 4.3 wt. % in the Cox-Siβ-pH-2.5 and Cox-Siβ-pH-9.0 series, respectively. It must be highlighted that the TOF measured in the present work over Co (3.07 x 10-3 s-1) is found to be about 7 times higher than that reported earlier for vanadium in comparable materials (0.44 ×10-3 s-1 [36]). The superiority of Co over V for ODHP is likely responsible for the interest in Co for this reaction [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. The evolution of the TOF measured at 400 °C after ODHP reaction at 500 °C over the Cox-Siβ series (TOF essentially constant below 5 wt. % Co and decreasing at higher Co contents, Table 5) cannot be correlated straightforwardly with the Co speciation deduced from H2-TPR (Section 3.2.3., Fig. 4). This may be attributed to the fact that H2-TPR profiles were recorded on samples in their calcined state, whereas TOFs were estimated at 400 °C after ODHP reaction at 500 °C, which may have affected the Co speciation in the spent catalysts compared to that in the calcined samples. This may also be attributed to the fact that only a limited number of Co species were active in the ODHP reaction, as reported earlier in propane-SCR [71]. More interesting is that the above-mentioned evolution of the TOF in the Cox-Siβ samples can be correlated to the changes in C3H6 production observed at 400 °C before and after ODHP reaction at 500 °C (Table 4). Table 4 shows a slight increase in C3H6 production after ODHP reaction at 500 °C for the Cox-Siβ samples with a Co loading below 5 wt. %, whereas a decrease in C3H6 production can be observed for Co loadings greater than 5 wt. % indeed. The fact that the TOFs were found to remain essentially constant below 5 wt. % of Co in the Cox-Siβ series may be attributed to the maximum content of Co incorporable in the silanol nests created by dealumination of the HAlSiβ pristine support. On a one-to-one Coinserted-to-Alextracted basis, the decrease in Al content from 2.65 to 0.11 wt. % after dealumination of the HAlSiβ support to Siβ (Table 1) would lead to a maximum Co loading of about 5.6 wt. % indeed. Below the maximum content of Co incorporable in the silanol nests on both Cox-Siβ series, it may appear surprising that the C3H6 TOF did not depend on the speciation of Co in the impregnating solutions (pH 2.5 and 9.0). Fig. 2 shows that Co speciation in the aqueous medium remained as Co(H2O)62+ at pH 2.5, whereas the precipitation of Co(OH)2 was deduced to occur at pH 9.0, indeed. Such an unexpected result may be attributed to the transient decrease to pH 3.0 during the addition of the Siβ support to the Co solution at pH 9 (Section 2.1.). Under such acidic conditions, the Co(OH)2 precipitate produced at pH 9.0 (Fig. 2) may be dissolved rapidly to Co(H2O)62+, allowing for the incorporation of Co in the Siβ framework as is the case in the preparation of the Cox-Siβ materials at pH 2.5. As the pH of the suspensions was subsequently adjusted back to pH 9.0 (Section 2.1.), the incorporation of Co in the framework of the Siβ support is assumed to be a rather rapid process, as reported for V incorporation in Siβ, which was shown to be kinetically promoted under acidic conditions [78].

Table 6 lists the C3H6 turnover frequencies (TOFs) on a per atom (Co or V) basis reported in earlier ODHP works at various temperatures. These earlier data are essentially compared to those estimated in the present study over the Co1.9-Siβ-pH-2.5 sample, which was shown to be representative of the most active samples (Table 5). Firstly it can be noted that the TOF value at 400 °C reported by Bulánek et al. (0.75 x 10-3 s-1, Table 6 [19]) compares remarkably well with that obtained for our Co1.8-HAlSiβ sample (Table 5, 0.86 x 10-3 s-1). These samples were (i) evaluated in the ODHP reaction under close experimental conditions, (ii) both synthetized by cationic exchange of the protons of beta zeolites exhibiting close Si/Al ratios (17.6 for Bulánek et al. [19] vs 13.6 in the present study, Table 1) and (iii) exhibited close Co loadings (1.68 wt. % Co for Bulánek et al. [19] vs 1.82 wt. % Co in the present study, Table 1). This remarkable agreement provides support for the reliability of the rates measured in the ODHP reaction in the present study. Overall, Table 6 shows that the TOFs of the Co1.9-Siβ-pH-2.5 sample are found to be greater than or equal to those reported in most of the earlier studies performed with Co-containing materials [17], [18], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. The fact that the TOF of Co1.9-Siβ-pH-2.5 appears to be lower than those reported on Co supported on Zr molecular organic framework (NU1000 [29]) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs [30]), respectively, illustrates the crucial importance of the support in the ODHP reaction. Regarding the earlier studies performed on silica-based materials, the TOF of the Co1.9-Siβ-pH-2.5 sample is found to be much higher than those reported in earlier studies [19], [23], [30] suggesting that the incorporation of the Co species into the framework of Siβ zeolite would be beneficial for the ODHP reaction.
Table 6. Comparison of the turnover frequencies (TOFs, molecule C3H6 s-1 Co or V atom-1) reported in earlier studies with that measured in the present work on Co1.9-Siβ-pH-2.5. These TOF calculated on a per atom basis were either extracted as is from the corresponding studiesa or estimated from the data reported in these earlier worksb.
4. Conclusion
The Cox-Siβ (x being the Co weight loading) samples prepared by incorporation of Co2+ species in the silanol nests (created by dealumination of a HAlSiβ support) appeared to be about 4 times more active in the ODHP reaction on a TOF basis compared to a reference sample for which Co was located in cationic exchange positions of a HAlSiβ support. Despite obvious differences in Co speciation in solution between pH 2.5 and 9.0 (Fig. 2), the change in pH during deposition of the Co2+ species in the silanol nests was found to have hardly any influence on the resulting ODHP catalytic activity below a Co loading of 5 wt. %. This peculiarity was assigned to the transient acidification of the medium to pH 3.0 with the addition of Siβ in the Co solution set originally at pH 9.0, and the rapid dissolution of the Co(OH)2 precipitate and incorporation of the Co species in the Siβ framework. The fact that the TOF was found to remain essentially constant below 5 wt. % of Co in the Cox-Siβ series may be rather attributed to the maximum content of Co incorporable in the silanol nests created by dealumination of the HAlSiβ pristine support. The TOF of a Co1.9-Siβ-pH-2.5 sample is found to be greater than or equal to those reported in most of the earlier studies performed with Co-containing materials and to be about 7 times greater than that of V-Siβ materials [36] under comparable experimental conditions in terms of O2 and C3H8 concentrations in the reacting feed (Table 6). The latter illustrates the superiority of Co over V for the ODHP reaction when incorporated into the silanol nests of a dealuminated Siβ supporting oxide. Finally, this work paves the way for the characterization of the Co2+ species by NO-TPD. NO was found to be weakly chemisorbed on the Co2+ species and to be relatively sensitive to the Co environment as the NO/Co ratio was found to decrease as the loading of Co increased, however, whereas differences in Co dispersion could not be observed by XPS. Additional work is currently under progress on more model materials for the characterization of supported Co2+ species by NO-TPD.
