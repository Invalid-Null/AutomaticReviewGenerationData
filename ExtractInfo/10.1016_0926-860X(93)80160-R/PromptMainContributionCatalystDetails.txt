Isobutane dehydrogenation on chromia/zirconia catalysts
Abstract
Isobutane dehydrogenation was studied on CrOxZrO2 (ZC) catalysts (0.04 to 1.9% chromium by weight) in a flow apparatus at 673–873 K. Up to 823 K, molar selectivity to isobutene was ⩾ 95%, while the only gaseous by-products were propene, methane and traces of propane. No skeletal isomerization occurred up to 873 K. A deactivation was observed due to the formation of coke. The activity decay was considerably delayed by adding a few percent hydrogen to the reactant mixture. In all cases, catalytic activity was completely recovered by treating the catalyst with flowing oxygen at 773 K over 22 reaction regeneration cycles. The catalyst surface was conditioned mainly by the reaction atmosphere, so that sample reduction with carbon monoxide at 623 K before catalysis did not influence the activity above 773 K. The turnover frequency per total surface chromium atom was found to be independent of surface chromium concentration at all given temperatures, which indicated a mononuclear active site. A comparison with chromia/silica and chromia//gg-alumina samples of similar chromium content revealed a higher activity for the zirconia-based catalysts. The overall picture shows close similarities with that of propane dehydrogenation previously studied in our laboratory on the same catalytic system. It is concluded that the site previously proposed for propane dehydrogenation is also responsible for the activity in the dehydrogenation of isobutane; this site involves a mononuclear CrIII species with two coordinative vacancies and, most probably, an adjacent O2− ion of the support.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
