Trends in the Activation of Light Alkanes on Transition-Metal Surfaces
Abstract
The first (oxidative) dehydrogenation step of light alkanes (ethane, propane, and n-butane) on transition-metal (closed-packed and stepped) surfaces is analyzed using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It is shown that the transition-state energies (ΔETS) of the C–H bond activation scale linearly with the corresponding final-state energies (ΔEFS), and all alkanes studied here share the same linear scaling relationships for the nonoxidative, oxygen-assisted, and hydroxyl-assisted reactions. Variations in ΔETS between alkanes can be mainly attributed to differences in dispersion contributions determined by the carbon-chain length. As the carbon chain increases, the ΔETS of the alkane C–H bond activation decreases. In addition, the ΔETS of the first (O)DH step of propane and n-butane is linearly correlated with the ΔETS of the first ethane (O)DH step. We also find that the oxygen and hydroxyl adsorption energies on the transition-metal surfaces (closed-packed and stepped) are dictating the promoting/poisoning effect of the C–H bond activation. Based on our extensive DFT calculations, we find that Pt has the lowest C–H bond transition-state energy for both the nonoxidative and oxidative pathways, and metals such as Au and Ag become active for C–H bond activation of alkanes only when oxygen and hydroxyl species are present on the metal surfaces. Finally, by establishing scaling relationships over a wide range of transition-metal surfaces, we have developed a simple and highly accurate model for the prediction of C–H bond activation barriers for the (oxidative) dehydrogenation of light alkanes.

1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The dehydrogenation (DH) of light alkanes into alkenes has gained more attention recently because of their increased supply from the shale gas boom. (1−3) Light alkenes are mainly used as building blocks for polymers and are typically produced by naphtha steam crackers and from fluid catalytic cracking. (4) Commercially, nonoxidative DH is already providing an alternative route to alkenes using Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts through the so-called Oleflex and Catofin processes. These technologies are used to fill the C3 and C4 olefin demand, while ethane DH is less pursued today because of more unfavorable thermodynamics and an abundance of C2 feeds on the market. The conversion of alkanes in the nonoxidative DH is limited by the production of hydrogen which shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium to the reactant side, and high temperatures are required to reach reasonable reaction rates. (5,6) On the other hand, the oxidative DH (ODH) of alkanes using O2 or CO2 represents an attractive option but is still in the early stages of development with catalyst design and process economics, needing improvement. The use of molecular O2 leads to an overoxidation, a low alkene yield, and a fast deactivation of the catalyst, which is still very poorly understood. However, coupling this reaction with CO2 (as a softer oxidant) which removes hydrogen through the reverse water–gas shift reaction moves the reaction again to the product side, thereby increasing the alkene yield. (4,7−10) The promoting/poisoning effect of the surface O* and OH* intermediates (formed during the ODH of alkanes) play an essential role in C–H bond activation, both in the functionalization of hydrocarbons and their partial oxidation. The first DH step herein has been shown to play a significant role as a rate-determining step. (11−17)
C–H bond activation and the DH process on transition-metal (TM) surfaces have been widely investigated for light alkanes, both experimentally and theoretically. For instance, the activation of methane under moderate conditions was only observed on oxygen-precovered Cu surfaces, and using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it was shown that the activation energy of methane is decreased using promoters such as O*, OH*, O2*, and OCH3. (18−21) Promoters for methane activation have also been evaluated on Pd and Au as well as their alloys. (22,23) Alkane DH has been studied primarily on Pt catalysts for the nonoxidative process, and investigations targeted Ni and Pd for the ODH process. (10,13,24−34) The direct dissociative chemisorption of propane and iso-butane and their fully deuterated isotopes was studied on the Pt(110) surface, where it was found that the difference in activation energies of C–H and C–D bond cleavage can be attributed to differences in zero-point energy stemming from the two isotopes. (35−37)
The combination of explicit DFT calculations and simple modeling methods such as scaling relationships has proven to be an essential tool in the computational search for new and promising catalysts. (38−42) The scaling relationships can be viewed as the correlation between a descriptor and the transition-state (TS) energy of a specific reaction, (43−49) with descriptors typically being the final-state (FS) or adsorption energies of one or a few key intermediates. (41,50,51) For the C–H bond activation and (de)hydrogenation reactions of alkanes, several scaling relationships have been proposed. (11,13,31,45,52−62) One of the first attempts to generalize a set of de(hydrogenation) reactions for several reactants including methane, ethane, and propane over close-packed and stepped surfaces of TMs was proposed by Wang et al. (53) Therein, with a suitable choice of reference systems, the TS scaling relationship was approximated to just one single linear scaling relationship (LSR). LSRs between the FS energies and the corresponding TS energies have been used to understand the effect of coadsorbed species on metal surfaces. For instance, it was found that the X–H bond activation (with X = C, N, O, and S) does not only depend on the binding strength of the X/X–H species but also depend on the H atom being extracted during X–H bond activation. (54−56,58) Based on trends observed for the C–H bond activation of methane on TMs, it has been possible to understand the origin of the promoting/poisoning effect of nonmetals (B, C, N, P, O, S, and Se) and to describe the C–H, N–H, and O–H bond activation across a range of reactions. (57) Other LSR studies include methane activation on single-atom alloys (61) and the C–H bond activation of the nonoxidative DH of ethane and propane on TMs. (11,13,31,62)
For larger alkanes, the effect of coadsorbed species such as oxygen and hydroxyl in the C–H bond activation on TM surfaces has not been investigated in detail yet. In this paper, a systematic study of the first (oxidative) DH step of light alkanes (ethane, propane, and n-butane) over close-packed and stepped TM surfaces (Scheme 1) has been performed using DFT calculations. As these (O)DH reactions can be catalyzed by a vast range of materials including noble metals and TM oxides, herein, the TMs most frequently used have been chosen: Ag, Au, Cu, Ni, Co, Pd, Rh, and Pt.

2. Computational Methods
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) (63,64) and the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) (65) employing the generalized gradient approximation Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals corrections (BEEF-vdW) (66,67) and the projector-augmented wave potentials. (68,69) The choice of the functional is motivated by its performance regarding the description of adsorption energies (70) and TSs (71) on TM surfaces. A similar setup and the reference energy levels for the FSs and the TS of the LSR are defined in a recent work from our group, (28) where the gas-phase molecules (ethane, propane, or n-butane) and the TM surfaces (with or without the preadsorbed oxygen species) were taken as the reference. When specified, single-point calculations were performed using the PBE functional, including Grimme’s dispersion corrections (PBE-D3) using the same parameters. (72,73) The TS searches along the reaction path were systematically performed using the nudged elastic band (74) and DIMER (75) methods at the same theoretical level as those for the reactants and products. A single imaginary frequency along the reaction coordinate confirmed the final TS structures, and the frequencies were calculated with a normal mode analysis using a finite-difference approximation of the Hessian matrix. Further details are given in the Supporting Information.
An analysis for validation of the statistical significance and physical meaning of the parameter estimates was performed, as explained by Toch et al. (76) The significance of every individual parameter was tested employing a t-test, and the 95% confidence intervals, mean absolute error (MAE), and maximum residual error were calculated.
3. Results and Discussion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Previously, we investigated the DH of propane over Pd(111) and Pd(211) surfaces and the effect of promotion with surface oxygen and hydroxyl. (28) It was found that the TS energies (ΔETS) scale linearly with the FS energies (ΔEFS), for both the nonoxidative DH and ODH steps. Herein, this analysis is extended to the first (O)DH step of ethane, propane, and n-butane over a range of TM surfaces.
3.1. Nonoxidative DH of Ethane on TM Surfaces
Figure 1 shows the linear relationship between the ΔETS for the first DH step of ethane following the nonoxidative pathway and the corresponding ΔEFS on several TM(111) and (211) surfaces relative to gas-phase ethane. The calculated ΔETS range from 0.37 eV (Pt) to 2.28 eV (Ag), and the energy barriers to activate the adsorbed molecules (initial state, IS) are in fair agreement with recent reports for Pt, Ni, and Cu surfaces. (30−33,77−79) We observe a weak geometric effect when comparing the (111) to (211) surfaces (with the intercepts being different by app. 0.1 eV), which is in line with other studies on DH reactions (53,80) and also points to the reaction being rather surface-insensitive (see Figure S1a for a more quantitative analysis of scaling relations).

3.2. ODH of Ethane on TM Surfaces
TS scaling relationships (similar to those obtained for nonoxidative DH) are observed for the oxygen- and hydroxyl-assisted DH of ethane, as shown in Figure 2. Overall, the results presented here for the TM(111) surfaces are in line with what has been found previously for methane activation assisted by oxygen and hydroxyl species. (54−58) For the first ODH step of ethane on O- and OH-modified surfaces, the ΔETS is directly correlated with the oxygen/hydroxide adsorption energies (Table S2 and Figure S2). We generally find that metals that adsorb the oxygen and hydroxide species strongly, such as Co, Cu, and Ni, have higher ΔETS. For metals with weak adsorption energies such as Au, Ag, and Pt, we observe a much lower ΔETS compared to the nonoxidative pathway and hence a strong promotional effect of O* and OH* (see also Table S2 and Figure S2 for all metals).
Figure 2
Figure 2. TS energies as a function of the FS energies for the (a) O- and (b) OH-assisted DH of ethane on TM surfaces. Filled and open markers correspond to TM(111) and (211) surfaces, respectively.
Regarding the effect of undercoordinated surface sites such as steps and kinks, as can be seen in Figure S1a, the O-assisted DH on Co and Rh on the (211) surface is more favorable than on the (111) terrace. The same effect is seen for the process with the assistance of coadsorbed OH on Cu, Ni, Rh, and Ag. In this figure, a gray area of ±0.1 eV has been included to indicate energy differences that are below the accuracy of our calculations (70,71,81) (among those are Ni, Cu, Pt, and Pd for O-assisted and Pd, Co, and Au for OH-assisted). For Au(111) and Ag(111), the LSR presented in Figure 2 and the calculated ΔEFS were used to determine the ΔETS, which are around 1.0 eV (Table S4), and the ΔETS for the O-assisted DH of ethane on Ag and Au(211) surfaces, on the other hand, is significantly lower.
The oxygen/hydroxyl species effect on each surface can be illustrated in a similar manner by analyzing the ΔETS difference between the O-/OH-assisted and the nonoxidative DH as a function of the difference in ΔEFS, as shown in Figure S1b. An inspection of Figure S1b reveals that the C–H bond activation of ethane is significantly enhanced on coinage metals (Cu, Ag, and Au) by surface oxygen and hydroxyl species on both surfaces. On Ni, Co, and Rh, the strong oxygen and hydroxide adsorption energies seem to poison the surfaces, increasing the ΔETS and the ΔEFS. For those metals, DH is more favorable in the absence of adsorbed oxygen and hydroxide adsorbed species. This effect has been showed previously by Tsai et al. (57) for methane activation, where the electronic structure of the surface and the bond order of the promoter were found to establish the trends in bond activation. For Pd and Pt, on the other hand, the ΔETS for the O- and OH-assisted DH of ethane is higher than those for the nonoxidative DH, although the ΔEFS is lower and stabilized by surface oxygen and hydroxyl species. In absolute terms, as expected from its use in commercial PDH technologies, Pt is calculated to perform best for the nonoxidative C–H bond activation of ethane, although it has quite favorable energetics for the ODH of ethane (both O- and OH-assisted) as well. From a statistical point of view, so far, there is no strong motivation for the use of two separate LSRs for the (111) and (211) surfaces in each reaction pathway because the combined LSRs for both surfaces are statistically significant (see Table S6). A detailed analysis can be found in the Supporting Information.
3.3. (O)DH of Alkanes on TM Surfaces
Next, we investigate to what extent the (O)DH of propane and n-butane is similar to that of ethane. Figure 3 shows the energy diagram of the first DH step of ethane, propane, and n-butane over the Pt(111) surface. The initial (ΔEIS), transition (ΔETS), and final (ΔEFS) state energies decrease as the chain length of the reactant increases in all reaction pathways; this interesting fact was pointed out before from nonoxidative DH experiments of propane and iso-butane on Pt(110). (35−37) In those experiments, a systematic decrease in activation energy of the DH of alkanes and their fully deuterated isotopes was found.
Figure 3

Table 1 shows the ΔETS of the alkane C–H bond activation and the dispersion interactions between the TS of the alkanes and the Pt(111) surface, as well as their average differences to those of ethane. The vdW forces were obtained through single-point calculations using the PBE-D3 functional and subtracting D3 contributions of surface species from those of gas-phase molecules. These calculations reveal that the D3 contributions of the TS increase as a function of the carbon-chain length, and the differences in these contributions correspond approximately to the ΔETS changes of the corresponding TS.

aDifferences with respect to ethane values.
As the differences in the energies shown in Table 1 can mainly be ascribed to the size of the reacting molecule, one might expect a similar result for all other TM surfaces studied in this work. Indeed, this is observed in Figure 4, where the calculations are extended to propane (O)DH on TM(111) and (211) surfaces, and n-butane (O)DH on Pd, Cu, and Ag(111) surfaces. As shown in Figure 4a–c, the ΔETS of propane and n-butane is linearly correlated with the ΔETS of ethane regardless of the TM surface and promoter present (oxygen or hydroxyl). The resulting intercepts (−0.06 and −0.10 eV) are in line with the average values of the differences in ΔETS between propane–n-butane and ethane being −0.06 and −0.11 eV, respectively (Figure 4b–d). These values compare quite well with the average differences in dispersion contributions (the D3 part, see Supporting Information) between propane–n-butane and ethane, which are −0.07 and −0.19 eV. Therefore, the difference in ΔETS between alkanes is mainly attributed to their differences in dispersion contributions dictated by the carbon-chain length.

Changes in ΔETS and dispersion contributions of the TS between (b) propane–ethane and (d) n-butane–ethane for the nonoxidative, O-assisted, and OH-assisted DH on TM surfaces. The dashed lines represent the intercepts of the equations in (a,c). The ΔETS dispersion energy contributions data for all metals, alkanes, and reaction pathways are presented in Tables S3–S5.
The general correlations found between the ΔETS and ΔEFS for all reactants and metal surfaces studied in the nonoxidative, oxygen-assisted, and hydroxyl-assisted DH are shown in Figure 5. In addition to our calculated data for ethane, propane, and n-butane, the values for the activation of methane on TM(111) surfaces from earlier work (56) are included. These general LSRs for alkanes are very similar to those obtained earlier for only ethane (see Figures 1 and 2), even when a different functional (such as RPBE) (82) was used for the methane data. We rationalize this by a more or less equal shift of ΔETS and ΔEFS by the dispersion contributions resulting in all data points coinciding on the same scaling line. Therefore, conclusions drawn earlier on TM surfaces and surface geometries in ethane (O)DH can be easily extended to methane, propane, and n-butane, showing that the C–H bond activation for each studied alkane is affected in a similar way by surface oxygen/hydroxyl species. Importantly, the slopes of the LSR for nonoxidative DH are slightly lower than 1, while the slopes for the oxygen- and hydroxyl-assisted DH are all in the range of 0.5–0.6. This can be related to simple bond-counting arguments, with the oxygen (and hydroxyl) bond to the TM surface weakened upon abstraction of a hydrogen from the reacting alkane. The scaling relations for all (O)DH pathways were obtained across various TM surfaces and include different reactants and could therefore be considered as predictive models for alkane C–H bond activation on metal surfaces. This is demonstrated in Figure 6 which shows a parity plot between our model based on the scaling relations from Figure 5 and the actual DFT data. Quite remarkably, the model agrees well with the DFT data leading to an MAE of only 0.08 eV. Complementarily, we have performed an in-depth statistical analysis showing the significance of established scaling relations for the full data set. It was found that the use of individual scaling relations per surface provide a better representation of the results obtained (Table S7). A more extended discussion of the statistical analysis can be found in the Supporting Information. We therefore suggest our model for the initial screening of TM surfaces for alkane DH in the presence or absence of oxygen promoters.

The data for all metals, alkanes, and reaction pathways needed to reproduce this figure are presented in Tables S3–S5. Small markers for methane activation were taken from Yoo et al. (56)

4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The first (oxidative) DH step of light alkanes (ethane, propane, and n-butane) on TM closed-packed and stepped surfaces was analyzed using DFT calculations. It was shown that the TS energies (ΔETS) of the C–H bond activation scale linearly with the corresponding FS energies (ΔEFS), and all alkanes studied (including methane) share the same linear relationships (LSR) for the nonoxidative, O-assisted, and OH-assisted reactions. This is because the ΔETS and ΔEFS of the alkanes are equally shifted by the dispersion interactions with the TM surfaces. Variations in ΔETS between alkanes were primarily attributed to differences in dispersion contributions determined by the carbon-chain length. As the carbon chain increases, the ΔETS of the alkane C–H bond activation decreases. As a result, the ΔETS of the first (O)DH steps of propane and n-butane is linearly correlated with the ΔETS of ethane and we expect that this also applies to longer alkanes.
Our analysis also evaluated the impact of oxygen and hydroxyl adsorption on the TM surfaces on promoting (e.g., for Au and Ag) and poisoning (e.g., for Co, Ni, and Rh) the reaction. Finally, we showed that simple models based on the LSRs are able to predict ΔETS with a remarkably small MAE for a wide range of metals, alkane reactants, and DH pathways. We suggest that these LSRs are universal and can therefore pave the way toward the computational design of improved (O)DH catalysts.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
