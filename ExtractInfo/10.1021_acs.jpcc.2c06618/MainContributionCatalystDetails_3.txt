 Unfortunately I could not identify this document as being related to propane dehydrogenation. The abstract mentions studying hydrogen/deuterium exchange between propane-d8 and indium-modified zeolite BEA to elucidate the role of different indium species in propane activation, but does not seem to discuss converting propane to propylene specifically. Since the document does not appear to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation to propylene, I have indicated this in the output.
