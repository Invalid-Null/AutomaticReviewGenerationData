The given document does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation for converting propane to propylene. It discusses the synthesis and characterization of hierarchical nano-ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts for converting methanol to aromatics, specifically benzene, toluene, and xylene (BTX). No mention of propane, propylene, PDH, or ODH processes.
