Tailoring the catalytic performance of single platinum anchored on graphene by vacancy engineering for propane dehydrogenation: a theoretical study†
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is an effective approach to produce propylene. Downsizing the Pt species to single atom catalysts (SACs) has become a hotspot, owing to the maximum utilization and excellent catalytic behavior. However, the agglomeration of SACs is the decisive limitation for high temperature PDH. Herein, single Pt atoms were anchored on graphene with different types of vacancies, and their catalytic performances on PDH were explored based on density functional theory (DFT). As the vacancy size increased, the catalytic activity decreased. It was because the combined site of the detached H atom in propane would transfer from the Pt atom to the C atom around vacancies, thus increasing the migration distance and lowering the activity. However, with the increase of vacancy size, the selectivity to propylene was improved, owing to the enhanced repulsion between C atoms in graphene and propylene. Therefore, instead of stabilizing the single atom, vacancies in carbon materials can also tailor the catalytic performance by geometric disturbance. This fundamental work opens up the possibility for purposeful SAC design in PDH.
1. Introduction
Propylene regarded as the valuable precursor chemical for producing polymers, oxygenates and intermediates has attracted attention worldwide.1 Adopting cheap and abundant propane as a raw material to produce propylene can not only achieve a considerable product yield but also contribute to a more sustainable utilization of natural resources.2 However, two challenges are unavoidable during the PDH catalyst design: (i) the chemical inertness of propane requires a highly active catalyst to break the C–H bond; (ii) the interaction between the catalyst and propylene should be weak, which implies that if propylene binds too strong, the deep dehydrogenation to side products will overweigh the desorption from the surface, thus lowering the catalytic selectivity.3 Therefore, designing appropriate catalysts is indispensable for the in-depth application of PDH.
Noble Pt-based catalysts are commonly used in PDH due to their excellent ability for C–H bond cleavage. However, side reactions (deep C–H dehydrogenation, subsequent cracking and hydrogenolysis) will occur at Pt–Pt ensemble sites.4 Therefore, downsizing Pt nanoparticles to SACs is becoming one of the hotspots to improve the product selectivity.5 The reason for adopting a single Pt atom catalyst in PDH can be explained using the following points: (i) the active site of a single Pt atom is highly exposed, achieving the maximum atomic utilization and reducing the noble metal usage;6 (ii) the catalytic activity can be retained, owing to the structure-insensitivity of C–H bond cleavage;7 and (iii) the adsorption configuration of propylene is tuned to the π model instead of the di-σ model, and thus the concomitant lower adsorption energy is advantageous for side reaction inhibition.8 Gong et al.9 reported a single-site [PtZn4] catalyst by assembling an atomically ordered PtZn intermetallic alloy for PDH. The selectivity to propylene reached more than 95% over the temperature range of 520 °C to 620 °C. Besides, they also synthesized the Al2O3 supported PtCu single-atom alloy for PDH, which showed that the propylene selectivity increased to 90.8% and the catalyst remained stable at 520 °C for 120 h.5 Chen's group10 investigated the size dependence of Pt catalysts used for PDH in terms of activity, selectivity and stability. The results showed that the TOF of the atomically disperse Pt catalyst was more than 3-fold higher than the large size of Pt nanoparticles. These studies prove that SACs possess potential application in the C–H bond activation of alkanes. However, owing to the high operation temperature (above 530 °C) in PDH,11 SACs are prone to agglomerate. The selection of support materials to anchor SACs is paramount for enhancing the catalyst stability.
Various supports can be used to stabilize the SACs, such as carbon materials, zeolites, metallic oxide, etc.12 Among these, carbon materials (graphene, carbon nanotubes, fullerene, etc.) are considered as the competitive supports due to their high surface area, chemical inertness and non-toxicity.13 In particular, intrinsic vacancies in carbon materials have shown decent potential for stabilization. Su's group14 applied the ND@G (a nanodiamond core and a defective graphene nanosheet) to support the Pt nanoparticles for PDH. The results revealed that a strong metal–support interaction (SMSI) existed owing to the electron transfer between defects and Pt nanoparticles. Experiments and theoretical studies also have proved that the vacancies in graphene and CNTs can restrain the agglomeration of metal atoms and clusters.15–19 Therefore, the vacancy engineering in carbon materials is efficacious to prevent the SACs from agglomerating. In addition, different vacancies in carbon materials have unique effects on regulating the catalytic performances of anchored metal atoms. Zhou et al.20 found that the bigger size of vacancies in graphene led to the stronger interaction towards the metal cluster and lower d-band center, thus decreasing the CO adsorption. Okazaki et al.21 introduced the single and double vacancies in graphite to anchor the Pt cluster. The results showed that the Pt–C interaction at the surface was changed in different vacancies, which indirectly controlled the adsorption ability and activity of catalysts. These works demonstrate that the vacancy types in graphene not only possess a different ability for stabilization but also tailor the catalytic performance by geometric and electronic effects. The regulation of vacancy types in graphene to anchor single Pt atoms for PDH still remains undeveloped, which deserved to be further explored from the microscopic perspective and thus contributes to the future catalyst development.
In this work, DFT calculation was performed to explore the effects of single Pt atom anchored on graphene with different sizes (1 to 4 missing C atoms) of vacancies on PDH. Firstly, the binding and formation energies of the graphene vacancies without and with anchoring single Pt atom were both analyzed to initially evaluate the appropriate vacancy types. Then, we analyzed the adsorption energies, activation barriers and reaction energies of the elementary steps involved in PDH, for the purpose of deep understanding of the controlled behaviour of the vacancy types towards catalytic performance in terms of geometric and electronic views. Meanwhile, the regeneration of active sites was also considered to complete the final evaluation of the vacancy types.
2. Computational methods
All the spin-polarized DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP).22,23 Projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials were employed to describe the valence electron–core interaction.24,25 The exchange–correlation effects were considered by the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) formalism.26,27 The plane wave basis with the 400 eV cutoff was used in all calculations. Meanwhile, the van der Waals dispersion correction was involved using the DFT-D3 method28 and a 6 × 6 × 1 Γ-centered k-point mesh was adopted for the Brillouin zone sampling. Graphene was modelled with a 6 × 6 unit cell and separated by the vacuum of 18 Å. During the geometric optimization, all atoms were allowed to relax with the convergence criteria for a residual force of 0.02 eV Å−1 and an energy of 1 × 10−5 eV. The transition states were searched by the climbing image-nudged elastic band (CI-NEB)29 and only one imaginary frequency existed in the structures of transition states.
During the PDH, the adsorption energies were calculated by the following equation:
Eads = E(adsorbates-Pt/Vn) − E(Pt/Vn) − E(adsorbates) (1)
where E(adsorbates − Pt/Vn) was the total energy of the adsorbate adsorbed on the catalyst surface, E(Pt/Vn) was the energy of Pt anchored on graphene with a vacancy, n was the number of missing C atoms in graphene, E(adsorbates) was the energy of the adsorbate. The activation barrier was calculated by the energy difference between transition states and initial states during the CI-NEB calculation. All energies were corrected by the zero-point energies (ZPE). The entropy contributions of propane and propylene adsorption were also considered in the free energy calculations, the details of which are provided in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1 The stability of Pt anchored on graphene with vacancies
3.1.1 The formation of graphene with different vacancies The graphene vacancy plays an essential role in stabilizing the single metal atom, while such capacity is hardly achieved by the pristine graphene.30 The formation energy of graphene with different vacancies is an indispensable factor to analyze the energetic economy and rationality of the anchored supports’ formation. Taking the experimental feasibility into consideration, the vacancies with five or six missing C atoms demanded high kinetic energies (>350 eV), therefore, vacancies in graphene with no more than four missing C atoms were chosen as the supports.31 The geometrical configurations of the graphene with multivacancies (Vn, n = 0–4) were displayed in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Nine types of vacancies were considered to anchor the single Pt atom. V0 was the pristine graphene; V1, V2, V3 and V4 were the graphene with 1 to 4 missing C atoms before relaxation. Pentagons were formed as the result of the reconstruction of vacancies, such as V2 (5-8-5) and V3 (5-10-5), which possessed diverse properties of stabilization.
The formation energies (Ef) of Vn were applied to analyze the energy cost of vacancy formation; the details were calculated as eqn (S1) (ESI†) and were depicted in Fig. 1(a). For V1, V2, V3 and V4, the formation energies increased from 7.97 eV to 14.49 eV with an increase in the vacancy size, which was similar to Hamamoto32 and Skowrons's33 works. The increased trend implied that the formation of graphene with larger vacancies was unfavourable and needed to overcome higher energy barriers. After the reconstructed pentagons formed, the formation energies of vacancies significantly decreased. Among various multivacancies, V1, V2, V2 (5-8-5) and V2 (555-777) showed relatively low energy cost, with formation energies of 7.97 eV, 8.85 eV, 6.63 eV and 6.02 eV, respectively. However, evaluating the vacancy properties only by formation energy is not comprehensive, the correlation of a closely sized vacancy is another effective method to further estimate the stability of the vacancy.34 Therefore, Saito et al.35 assumed that the Vn vacancy could be dissociated into V(n − 1) and V1 vacancies, which was evaluated by the dissociation energy Dn. As displayed in Fig. 1(b), V2, V2 (5-8-5) and V2 (555-777) also possessed high dissociation energies of 7.08 eV, 9.31 eV and 9.92 eV, demonstrating that the three vacancies were hardly dissociated into small closer vacancies. Therefore, based on the energy cost practicability and formation stability, V1, V2, V2 (5-8-5) and V2 (555-777) were relatively appropriate candidates to support the single Pt atom.

3.1.2 Binding of single Pt atoms to graphene vacancies The optimized structures of single Pt atom anchored in different vacancies (Pt/Vn) were displayed in Fig. 2 and the parameters concerning the binding structures were listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2, the geometric configurations of Pt/V2 and Pt/V2 (5-8-5) were identical. However, as for V2 (555-777), a single Pt atom was adsorbed at the bridge site of two C atoms rather than the vacancy hole, differing from that on the V2 and V2 (5-8-5) vacancies. When a Pt atom was anchored on the graphene with 3 or 4 missing C atoms, the optimized structures remained unchanged after the pentagons’ formation in the reconstructed vacancies. As shown in Table 1, it could be seen that with the increased number of missing C atoms, the single Pt atom became closer to the graphene plane, with the height decreased from 2.27 Å to 0.00 Å. Besides, in order to figure out the status of the Pt atom, the electronic ground state of the Pt atom in graphene was also evaluated in Table S1 (ESI†) according to Zhu et al.'s work,36 and the details are discussed in the ESI.†

In order to analyze the stability and formation energy of a single Pt atom anchored on graphene with vacancies, the binding energies (Eb) and formation energies (Ef) of Pt/Vn were also summarized in Table 1; the equations were displayed in the ESI.† The binding energy of the Pt atom anchored on the pristine graphene (Pt/V0) was −1.57 eV, which was similar to previous works.16,37 After the introduction of vacancies, the binding energies increased from −2.27 eV to −10.58 eV, leading to the enhanced stability of the single Pt atom. As for the models of Pt/V1, Pt/V2, Pt/V3 and Pt/V4, with the vacancy size increased, the strong metal–support interaction (SMSI) between the single Pt atom and graphene were improved. However, the anchoring ability of Pt/V4 was weaker than that of Pt/V3, resulting from the excess long distance between the single Pt atom and adjacent C atoms in Pt/V4. Although larger-sized (Pt/V3 and Pt/V4) vacancies could effectively stabilize the single Pt atom, the formation energies (from 2.41 eV to 5.34 eV) were too high to overcome. Therefore, the formation of larger-sized vacancies needed huge energy cost, which was unfavourable in terms of the energetic economy. Comparing the catalyst models of Pt/V0 and Pt/V2 (555-77), the optimal geometric configurations of Pt atoms were both anchored at the bridge site of two C atoms. However, the binding energy of the Pt atom in Pt/V2 (555-77) was 0.70 eV higher than that in Pt/V0, resulting from the vacancy stabilization. Furthermore, Bader charge was calculated to analyze the charge transfer between the Pt atom and the graphene plane. The details about Bader charge were shown in the ESI.† From Table 1, one could see that more electrons transferred from the Pt atom to graphene as the vacancies were introduced, which accounted for the SMSI from the view of electronic effects. These results clearly indicated that the vacancy introduction was an effective approach to stabilize the single Pt atom.
The stability of the Pt atom anchored on graphene depends not only on the binding energies but also on the comparison with the cohesive energy of Pt bulk (Ecoh). Fig. 3 depicted the comparison between the binding energy and the cohesive energy of the Pt atom. Except for Pt/V0, Pt/V2 (555-777) and Pt/V4 (555-9), the binding energies of the remaining catalysts were all higher than the cohesive energy of Pt bulk (5.53 eV). It could be speculated that the Pt atom anchored at the hole formed by vacancies were more stable than those adsorbed at the bridge site between two C atoms. The larger-sized vacancies possessed more effective ability for stabilization. However, taking the formation energies into consideration, Pt/V3, Pt/V3 (5-10-5) and Pt/V4 must overcome a huge energy barrier, which were difficult to form unless there was huge energy sacrifice. Pt/V1, Pt/V2 and Pt/V2 (5-8-5) were appropriate catalysts in terms of stability and formation cost. Based on the similar formation energies and geometric configurations, Pt/V2 was more appropriate than Pt/V2 (5-8-5) owing to the higher binding energy. Therefore, after overall consideration, Pt/V1 and Pt/V2 were chosen to be the promising catalyst models for PDH after the initial screening.

3.2 Adsorption properties of propane and propylene in Pt/Vn
3.2.1 Geometric effects The adsorptions of propane and propylene play a crucial role in determining the activity and selectivity of the catalyst.38 The optimized adsorption structures of propane and propylene in Pt/Vn were shown in Fig. 4 and the corresponding energies were summarized in Table 2. Because Pt/V0, Pt/V2 (555-777) and Pt/V4 (555-9) were unstable under the experimental conditions, these catalyst models were not further considered. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2, the adsorption configurations and energies of Pt/V2 and Pt/V2 (5-8-5) were identical. Based on the same formation energies of Pt/V2 and Pt/V2 (5-8-5), the interaction of Pt/V2 was stronger than that of Pt/V2 (5-8-5). Therefore, in the following discussion, we only took the catalytic properties of Pt/V2 into discussion. Also, the situation was applied for Pt/V3 and Pt/V3 (5-10-5), and Pt/V3 was chosen to be explored in the following evaluation. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2, the distance between the secondary C atom in propane and graphene surface was within the range of 3.39–3.51 Å. Propane physisorbed weakly on the surface with no bond interaction and the adsorption energies were within −0.23 eV. Conversely, propylene interacted more strongly with the graphene surface in chemisorbed modes. For Pt/V1 and Pt/V2, propylene was favourably adsorbed at the Pt atom via the π-mode, resulting in high adsorption energies of −1.21 eV and −0.62 eV, respectively. Moreover, the CC bond length was stretched from 1.34 Å (CC bond length of propylene in vacuum)39 to 1.41 and 1.43 Å. However, with the increase in the size of vacancies, the adsorption of propylene transferred from chemisorption to weak physisorption and the CC bond length remained at 1.34 Å. In order to figure out the change of the adsorption behaviour of propylene, adsorption energy was divided into three parts in Table 2, which was as follows:40
Eads = Edistortion,surf + Edistortion,ads + Ebond (2)
where Edistortion,surf and Edistortion,ads were the distortion energies of the graphene surface and the adsorbates during adsorption, which would have negative effects on the adsorption behaviour; and Ebond was the bonding interaction energy between the adsorbate and catalyst surface.

Table 2 Decomposition of adsorption energies of propane and propylene in Pt/Vn

Propane Edistortion,surf/eV 0.03 0.00 0.03 0.07
Edistortion,ads/eV 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00
Ebond/eV −0.26 −0.20 −0.22 −0.28
Eads/eV −0.23 −0.20 −0.19 −0.21
Propylene Edistortion,surf/eV 0.14 0.91 0.02 0.00
Edistortion,ads/eV 0.35 0.53 0.00 0.01
Ebond/eV −1.70 −2.06 −0.31 −0.38
Eads/eV −1.21 −0.62 −0.29 −0.37
As shown in Table 2, Edistortion,surf and Edistortion,ads of propane adsorbed in Pt/Vn were negligibly small (≤0.07 eV), indicating that the adsorption energies were determined by the direct interaction between propane and the catalyst surface. As for propylene, when it was chemisorbed on the Pt/V1 and Pt/V2 surfaces, Edistortion,surf and Edistortion,ads were highly positive, demonstrating that the propylene and catalyst surface were significantly distorted. These two energies of propylene adsorbed in Pt/V2 were both higher than those in Pt/V1, causing adverse effects on the adsorption. Although the Ebond of propylene in Pt/V2 was 0.36 eV greater than that in Pt/V1, the propylene adsorption must compensate the large distortion of the surface and adsorbates, thus leading to the lower adsorption energies. When it came to the physisorption in Pt/V3 and Pt/V4, the distortions were negligible, representing a weak adsorption interaction. Obviously, the distortion and interaction energies of the surface and propylene in vacancies with smaller size (1 or 2 missing C atoms) were both higher than those of larger-sized vacancies (3 or 4 missing C atoms). The transferred adsorption mode of propylene could be explained by the disturbance of the graphene plane, which would lead to the less interaction of propylene (rich electron species) towards the single Pt atom and the more repulsion towards the adjacent C atoms around vacancies. Therefore, the geometric effects caused by vacancies are of vital significance for the propylene adsorption behaviour in Pt/Vn, which is the key factor to tailor the catalytic selectivity.
3.2.2 Electronic effects To further understand the adsorption behaviour of propylene from the electronic perspectives, charge density differences were inserted in Fig. 5. Obviously, the charge redistribution was concentrated between propylene and Pt/V1 and Pt/V2 surfaces, verifying the strong interaction of chemical adsorption. In comparison, there was barely any charge transfer between propylene and Pt/V3 and Pt/V4 surfaces, owing to the weak interaction of physisorption.
Fig. 5 The relationship between the d-band center of Pt atoms and adsorption energies of polyene in Pt/Vn; charge density differences of propylene adsorbed in Pt/V1, Pt/V2, Pt/V3 and Pt/V4 were inserted. The charge accumulation and depletion are colored red and yellow, with the isosurface value being 0.005 and 0.0005 a.u. for the smaller-sized and larger-sized vacancies, respectively.
In addition, the relationship between the d-band center (εb) and adsorption energies of propylene in Pt/Vn was shown in Fig. 5. The calculation of εb was computed according to Norskov's methods.41 It was acknowledged that with εb closer to the Fermi level, the adsorption strength of the metal atom would be relatively stronger.42–45 However, the correlation between εb of Pt atoms and the adsorption energies of propylene was not in accordance with most circumstances. Instead of the enhanced ability of adsorption, the higher εb resulted in a weaker interaction between propylene and the catalyst surface. The factors influencing the adsorption behaviour were surface geometric effects and electronic effects. The d-band center just explained the propylene adsorption in view of electronic effects, the unexpected trend between propylene adsorption and εb could be traced to the adverse large distortion of the adsorbate and catalyst surface.39,46 For Pt/V1 and Pt/V2, it was reasonable to speculate that the surface distortion was the dominant factor that determined the adsorption behaviour, owing to the high Edistortion in Table 2. For the propylene physisorption in larger vacancies, the reason for the adsorption capacity of Pt/V4 higher than Pt/V3 was because the C atoms around an over-large vacancy in Pt/V4 had less repulsive force towards propylene. These results revealed that the electronic effects did less contribution to control the adsorption behaviour when compared with the geometric effects in the Pt/Vn catalyst system. Tailoring the propylene adsorption behaviour only based on the d-band center theory was not enough. In addition, it was well-accepted that the εb closer to the Fermi level, the stronger the interaction between the TM atoms and the substrate,47 which maybe another descriptor to explain the adsorption behaviour of Pt/Vn. As shown in Fig. S2(a) (ESI†), with εb closer to the Fermi level, the binding energies of the Pt atom anchored on graphene with vacancies (V1, V2, V3 and V4) were increased. There was a linear correlation between εb and binding energies. Meanwhile, as the interaction between the Pt atom and vacancies enhanced, the adsorption energies to the propylene decreased. Therefore, the binding energy of the Pt atom on graphene could also be adopted as a descriptor to the adsorption ability. For Pt/V1, Pt/V2, Pt/V4 and Pt/V3, an enhanced interaction between the Pt atom and the C atom in graphene accompanied a weak adsorption ability to propylene.
3.3 Catalytic properties of Pt/Vn
3.3.1 Reaction mechanism of propane dehydrogenation to propylene The possible elementary reaction steps were summarized in Fig. S3 (ESI†), which was classified into C–H and C–C bond cleavage. We considered nine elementary steps involved in the propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The geometric configurations concerning the key species were depicted in Fig. S4–S7 (ESI†) and the relative energies of Pt/V1 and Pt/V2 were summarized in Table 3. The whole reaction network was classified into three parts: the continuous dehydrogenation of propane to (R1–R7); the C–C bond scission of intermediates to coke precursor (R3, R6) and the deep dehydrogenation of propylene to propenyl (R8, R9). Part one primarily determined the catalytic activity of Pt/Vn and the activation barriers of the elementary steps involved in part two were the good descriptors of the coke-resistance. Meanwhile, the energy difference between the propylene desorption and deep dehydrogenation to propenyl in part three was employed to analyze the selectivity to propylene.48

As shown in Table 3, the activation barrier of to in Pt/V1 (0.94 eV) was lower than the dehydrogenation to (1.00 eV) and the cracking to the group (1.95 eV). Therefore, the formation of was more favourable to take place during the initial activation of propane. Subsequently, three reaction pathways occurred starting from , namely, the continuous hydrogen abstraction to form or , and the C–C bond cleavage to . Nevertheless, the activation barriers of R5 and R6 were 2.37 and 2.77 eV, respectively, which were impossible to happen. As a consequence, the most favourable reaction pathway to generate propylene in Pt/V1 was . Similarly, the most favourable pathways in other vacancy types were the same as in Pt/V1 based on the comparison of activation barriers. The activation barriers and reaction energies of the optimal elementary steps in Pt/V3 and Pt/V4 were listed in Table S3 (ESI†). Clearly, the propane activation in Pt/Vn (n > 2) needed to overcome large activation barriers of 1.79 eV and 1.64 eV, indicating that the first step of propane dehydrogenation was kinetically inhibited. Thus, as for Pt anchored on the graphene with 3 or 4 missing C atoms, we only discussed the optimal reaction pathways in the following part.
3.3.2 Catalytic activity of Pt/Vn The energy profiles of the continuous dehydrogenation steps from propane to propylene in Pt/Vn were depicted in Fig. 6. As discussed above, we only compared the most favourable pathways of propane dehydrogenated to propylene via 2-propyl. It could be seen in Fig. 6 that the activation energies of the first C–H bond cleavage were all higher than that of the continuous second C–H bond cleavage, thus the ability of the first C–H bond breaking was often deemed as the symbol of the catalytic activity. The activation barrier of the first C–H bond cleavage in Pt/V1 was the lowest (0.94 eV) and also lower than that in the extant reported V1/g-C3N4 (1.11 eV),7 which implied the excellent catalytic activity of Pt/V1. Subsequently, the catalytic activity of Pt/V2 was inferior to Pt/V1, with the relatively high activation barrier of 1.50 eV. However, when the vacancy was oversized, it was difficult to activate the propane owing to the excess large activation barrier.
Fig. 6 The potential energy profile for the most favourable pathways of propane dehydrogenation to propylene in Pt/Vn.
To deeply explain the unideal activity of large vacancies, the configurations of the key reaction species during the first C–H bond cleavage in Pt/Vn were summarized in Fig. 7. When the H atom was initially abstracted from the propane in Pt/V1, the C–H bond was stretched to 1.686 Å in the transition state and finally combined with the Pt atom. However, it could be clearly seen that with the increase of the vacancy size, the detached H atom was prone to combining with the C atoms in graphene rather than Pt atom. This was because the larger size of vacancies could lead to the lower height of the Pt atom to the plane, as a consequence, the adjacent C atoms around vacancies could play a more effective role in the H attraction. The C–H bond distance of the transition states in Pt/Vn (n = 2–4) was elongated to 1.697 Å, 2.494 Å and 2.071 Å, respectively. The longer distance of the C–H bond in the transition state could contribute to higher reaction barrier of the first C–H bond cleavage, corresponding to the decrease of catalytic activity. As for Pt/V4, the reason why its catalytic activity was higher than Pt/V3 was because the shorter distance between the C atoms in graphene and propane, caused by the relatively strong propane adsorption ability of Pt/V4. After the above discussion, Pt/V1 was proved as the most active catalyst. The activity of Pt/V2 was needed to be further enhanced. As for the larger-sized vacancy of Pt/V3 and Pt/V4, there was no need to further consider based on the excessive high barrier of the reactant activation. Taking the results in Section 3.1 into consideration, Pt/V1 and Pt/V2 were proved to be the relatively ideal catalyst models.

3.3.3 Coke-resistance and selectivity of Pt/Vn In addition to the C–H bond cleavage, the cracking of the C3 immediate will produce undesired products, which are the precursors of cracking. For the purpose of deeply investigating the catalytic properties of Pt/V1 and Pt/V2, the C–C bond cleavage of the C3 immediate was also considered. As shown in Fig. 8, the C–C bond cleavage of and was chosen as the symbolic cracking reaction.7 Obviously, the activation barriers of to in Pt/V1 and Pt/V2 were 1.95 eV and 2.75 eV, higher than the C–H bond scission. This proved that the propane cracking was not favourable in terms of kinetics. Similarly, the undesired C–C cracking of was also impossible to occur, resulting from the high activation barriers of 2.77 eV and 1.77 eV, respectively. Previous work demonstrated that the C–C bond cleavage would be inhibited kinetically when compared with the C–H bond cleavage until the dehydrogenation proceeded to the propyne formation.48 Therefore, Pt/V1 and Pt/V2 showed excellent coke-resistance and the C-C cracking had a negligible effect on the selectivity to propylene.

The deep C–H bond cleavages of propylene were non-neglected side reactions. Fig. 9 depicted the potential energy profiles of the propylene dehydrogenated deeply to and in Pt/V1 and Pt/V2. The dehydrogenation of propylene to and in Pt/V1 was comparable, with activation barriers of 1.49 eV and 1.47 eV, respectively. As for Pt/V2, the activation barrier of formation was lower than that of production, thus was the primary deep dehydrogenated product. The deep C–H bond cleavage of propylene in Pt/V1 and Pt/V2 was more difficult to occur when compared with the continuous C–H bond cleavage of propane to propylene. This implied that these two catalyst models could effectively inhibit the side reactions. Alternatively, the energy magnitude between the propylene dehydrogenation (Edehy) and the desorption (Edes) was the descriptor of catalytic selectivity.49,50 The higher difference between the two energies (Ediff) demonstrated that propylene was prone to desorb from the catalyst surface rather than dehydrogenate to leading to an enhanced selectivity. As summarized in Table S4 (ESI†), the Ediff of Pt/V1 was 0.26 eV, lower than that of Pt/V2, implying the better selectivity to propylene in Pt/V2. Nevertheless, the first C–H bond cleavage of Pt/V2 was 0.56 eV higher than that of Pt/V1, which resulted in a lower activity. This inverse relationship between activity and selectivity could be explained by the scaling relationship.5 It was acknowledged that the high performance of the catalyst with excellent activity and selectivity was difficult to achieve owing to the scaling relationship.5 The high activity always accompanied the selectivity sacrifice. This was because the more reactive surface was expected to bind all adsorbates (initial, transition and final states) more strongly rather than absorbing only the individual species.51 For example, a more reactive catalyst should be designed to reduce the reaction barrier by binding transition state adsorbates more tightly, however, the final state was also bound more tightly leading to reduced product selectivity. In this work, if the vacancy size of graphene decreased, Pt/Vn was sensitive to the first C–H bond scission in propane, and the binding of transition state was stronger. However, the attraction degree between the propylene and Pt atom would be enhanced simultaneously, thus leading to the weak propylene desorption. Similarly, if the repulsion between the propylene and the Pt/Vn was improved, the detached H atom in propane would overcome long migrate distance and the adsorption of the transition state decreased, and thus, the activity of C–H bond scission was relative weaken. Therefore, in order to break the scaling relationship, catalysts with high performance should bind reactive intermediates with suitable interaction strength: neither too strong that led to low product yield, nor too weak which failed to activate the reactants.

Although the selectivity of Pt/V1 was relatively poor when compared with Pt/V2, the Ediff was still higher than that of the reported highly selective Pt–Nvac catalyst (0.12 eV).52 Therefore, after the compromise between catalytic activity and selectivity, V1 was considered as the optimal support to anchor the single Pt atom among the various vacancies in graphene.
3.4 The regeneration of active sites
In addition to C3H6, H2 was another crucial product during the dehydrogenation of propane. Therefore, the desorption of H2 was also considered to analyze the regeneration of active sites. As shown in Fig. 10, the activation barriers of H2 desorption in Pt/V1 and Pt/V2 were 0.39 and 0.78 eV, respectively. The high energy barriers indicated that the H atoms combined more strongly in Pt/V2, which was detrimental to the active site regeneration. However, the activation barriers of H2 in these two catalyst models were both lower than those in the directly dehydrogenated steps of propane. This demonstrated that the regeneration of active sites was not the bottleneck during the reaction network. Furthermore, the activation barrier of H2 desorbed from Pt/V1 was 1.83 eV lower than that from the CNT catalyst.53 Therefore, Pt/V1 was proved to be a competitive catalyst model for the dehydrogenation of propane in terms of the activity, selectivity and active site regeneration.

3.5 Discussion
Based on the above results, some phenomena deserved to be further discussed. Previous works prove that the Pt atom with more positive charge can improve the C–H bond cleavage ability and combine with the product propylene more strongly.45,52 These observations are obtained in view of electronic perspectives and the geometric configurations of the catalyst models remain relatively stable. In this work, the disturbances of geometric configurations caused by the vacancies are noticeable, thus tailoring the catalytic properties by vacancy engineering in carbon materials only based on the electronic effects is not enough. The geometric effects also play an indispensable role when collaborating with active metal atoms. During the PDH catalyzed by Pt/Vn, the collaborative effects of single Pt atoms and vacancies in graphene are observed. On the one hand, the Pt atom is the initial trigger point for the C–H bond scission, which is an indispensable factor for the initial reactant activation. On the other, the vacancies in graphene can not only stabilize the active site but also control the activity and selectivity by adjusting the configurations. Specifically, with the increase of vacancy size, the Pt atom will be pulled back to the graphene instead of extruding out of the plane, which can change the anchor site of the detached H atom from the Pt atom to the adjacent C atoms around vacancies. This will increase the migration distance of the detached H atom and then decrease the catalytic activity. Meanwhile, the repulsion interaction to propylene caused by C atoms around graphene vacancies may overweigh the attraction by the Pt atom, resulting in an enhanced selectivity. Therefore, the vacancy types in graphene can make contributions to the activity and selectivity by adjusting the geometric configurations, which should not be underestimated and may inspire further investigations of the selective dehydrogenation of propane on the SAC design.
4. Conclusions
The catalytic performance of a single Pt atom anchored on graphene with different vacancies in PDH was revealed by the DFT calculations. After estimating the binding energies and formation energies, it was found that the vacancies in graphene could prevent the single Pt atom from agglomerating and the energy cost was unideal with the size of vacancies increased. Except for the stabilized role, the vacancies in graphene also collaborated with the Pt atom when employed in PDH. As the vacancy size increased, the detached H atom would combine with the planar C atoms around vacancies rather than the Pt atom. This hampered the enhanced catalytic activity. Meanwhile, the repellent degree of propylene and the planar C atoms could be improved, which was advantageous to the propylene selectivity. After comprehensive consideration, Pt anchored on the graphene with one missing C atom was proved to be the optimal model, in which the activation barrier of the first C–H bond cleavage was 0.94 eV and the selectivity descriptor Ediff was 0.26 eV. However, the selectivity of this catalyst model still needed to be enhanced during the future research. Overall, the support engineering by vacancy design could provide a controllable guidance for the future SAC application in PDH.
