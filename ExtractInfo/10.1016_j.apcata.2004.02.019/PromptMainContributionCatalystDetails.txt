Partial oxidation of propane to acrylic acid at a Mo–V–Te–Nb-oxide catalyst
Abstract
The partial oxidation of propane has been investigated at a multicomponent oxidic catalyst in the temperature range
. The kinetic measurements were carried out in an integrally operated fixed bed reactor with distributed local sampling. The oxygen–propane ratio in the feed has been varied in the range 1.5<xO2/xpropane<4 and the water content was increased up to 50 vol.%. The results can be described quantitatively by a network of parallel and consecutive first order reactions.
1. Introduction
Up to now acrylic acid is commercially produced in a two-step process starting from propene. Overall selectivities to acrylic acid based on propene of 85–90% are obtained at conversions above 95% [1]. Using typical oxidic catalysts we determined yields above 85% in the oxidation of propene to acrolein [2] and up to 95% in the sequential oxidation of acrolein to acrylic acid [3].
An alternative route could be the partial oxidation of propane as feed. The economic importance of this possibility and the successful manufacture of maleic anhydride by selective oxidation of n-butane has stimulated various research. However, for a long period all efforts remained futile and the yields reported in the literature, except in a patent from Mitsubishi [24], were desperately low [4], [5]. In the last years the use of multi-component oxidic catalysts based on molybdenum, vanadium, niobium and tellurium seems to lead to a major breakthrough and promising developments. The actual state of the art of the selective oxidation of propane to acrylic acid has been reviewed by Lin [6]. Most of the applications of the catalytic system cited above are mentioned in the patent literature. Some of the results are listed in Table 7 of [6].
So far the open literature is mainly restricted to the study of catalyst preparation, its structure and the comparison with other catalytically active systems [6], [7], [8], [9]. By contrast, the matter of this work was a kinetic study. On the basis of the catalytic measurements a simple reaction network was developed and supported by using the intermediate propene as reactant too. Further, the influence of the temperature, the water content in the feed and of the ratio of propane to oxygen on the partial oxidation of propane was investigated.
With this network and the related rate expressions a quantitative description of the reacting system was possible. As we merely observe the evolution of the gas phase, the investigation is not aimed at the elucidation of mechanistic details but at the derivation of a sufficiently precise representation of the sequence in order to give guide lines for improved engineering measures and future catalyst developments.
Following a note published recently [10] the present article will give a more detailed insight in the results and the approach chosen.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst and kinetic measurements
The oxidic catalyst has the bulk composition MoV0.33Te0.22Nb0.11Ox and was synthesised according to the patent literature [11]. Its preparation has been described in more detail before [10]. It is of the egg-shell type and contains 10 or 20 wt.% active compound on spherical steatite, named S10 and S20 in the following. The mean diameter is equal to 3 mm. The use of both catalysts has given results indicating the absence of inner mass transfer resistances.
The experiments were run in an integrally operated fixed-bed reactor, containing between 215 and 340 g of catalyst, normally diluted with steatite beads in the mass ratio 1:1 (illustrated schematically by the black and white circles on the section of the fixed bed shown in Fig. 1). The gas flow rates varied between 20 and 80 N cm3/s. The reactor consists of a stainless steel tube, 15 mm in diameter and 1500 mm in length. It is divided into nine segments with separate electrical heating to maintain isothermal conditions. As shown schematically in Fig. 1, the reactor is equipped with sampling ports where small side streams were withdrawn by use of heated capillaries. Each side stream selected by use of a multiposition valve entered the analysis section, consisting of non dispersive IR spectrometers for CO and CO2, a magnetomechanic device for O2 and a gas chromatograph with capillary column and FID for the organic compounds. Automatic continuous operation of the unit was possible as all functions are controlled and recorded by computer.

Fig. 1. Experimental set-up.
The feed contains the hydrocarbon, oxygen and water in nitrogen. The gaseous compounds are admitted through thermal mass flow controllers, water is dosed in liquid form, evaporated at 120 °C and fed together with nitrogen in the reactor. The measurements are made at a pressure of 1.5 bar, the temperature being varied in the case of propane in the domain
and in the case of propene between 310 and 360 °C. Under these conditions there is no homogeneous reaction to be considered and the steatite beads remain completely inert.
The reactor is considered as an isothermal plug flow system, the results obtained at the same residence time τm but different flow rates agree accordingly. In addition, the estimation of the Bodenstein number gives values well above the lower limit of 100 where axial dispersion can be neglected.
The experimental set-up thus allows to determine the axial concentration profiles along the reactor. As partial oxidations are normally realised in multitubular reactors, the results of the kinetic measurements should enable a scale-up either by simple “numbering-up” or by the extrapolation via an appropriate model.
2.2. Experimental data and derived quantities
The measurements were carried out in the open system at steady state. Each quantity can be determined at the location of each of the eight analytical ports distributed along the catalyst bed.
The modified residence time is related to the mass mcat,z of the catalytically active compound at port z
(1)
where V̇ designs the volume flow under operational conditions. The gas composition at port z is quantified by use of a normalised dimensionless concentration of carbon-containing species i,
(2)
relating the molar flux of species i to the molar flux of the hydrocarbon, propane or propene, at reactor inlet, εi being the number of carbon atoms of species i.
Mass balancing between the reactor inlet and the sampling port z additionally leads to the conversion of the hydrocarbon

and the integral selectivity of formation of species i at this location

For reaction products the dimensionless concentration yi is equal to the yield Yi which is related to conversion and integral selectivity by

Finally, we obtain the values of the grain selectivity
, a quantity characterising the catalyst independently of the reactor configuration [12], by the extrapolation of the integral selectivity to zero conversion

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Reaction network and rate expressions
The measurements have been made using different egg-shell catalysts, catalyst fillings and dilutions. No significant influence could be observed.
Typical results obtained in the partial oxidation of propane are shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3. Interesting products of the reaction are propene and acrylic acid, only traces of acrolein have been observed. The species “by-products” consists of COx and acetic acid, no acetone could be detected by online gas chromatography. Fig. 2 illustrates the decrease of propane concentration along the fixed bed and the steady increase of the concentrations of acrylic acid and by-products with the residence time in the reactor. The concentration of propene passes through a maximum but the values remain low under the conditions stated. They are even less at higher temperatures.

The corresponding values of the integral selectivities
are plotted against the conversion of propane in Fig. 3. Their extrapolation to zero conversion indicates that the grain selectivity of propene formation (Eq. (6)) should be close to one. This is confirmed by measurements with conversions below 5% which are not represented on the figure. By contrast, the characteristic shapes of the curves for acrylic acid and by-products indicate that those species are formed in consecutive reactions.
We therefore consider propene to be the only primary product of the oxidation of propane under the conditions stated. Acrylic acid and the lumped species are subsequently formed. As one cannot exclude the further oxidation of acrylic acid the simplest reaction scheme based on the experimental results, we do not measure but gas phase concentrations, is given by

Considering the low propene concentration one can conclude that the rate determining step of the network is represented by the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, a fact which is confirmed by the model calculations discussed later.
In order to obtain more detailed information on the reaction of propene, its partial oxidation has been studied at the same catalyst. Typical results are represented in Fig. 4, Fig. 5.

The values shown in Fig. 4 clearly indicate that propene is much more reactive on that catalyst than propane. In spite of the fact that the temperature is 50 °C lower, conversions of more than 70% are obtained at residence times where the propane conversion remained below 50%. However, the conversion of oxygen at reactor outlet remained below 65% under all conditions.
The reaction scheme needs to be more complex in the case of propene oxidation. We now detect acrylic acid, acrolein and by-products, the latter being composed of COx and acetic acid as before in the oxidation of propane. Once more not even traces of acetone were detected. However, the existence of acrolein as an intermediate can no longer be neglected as its concentration attains up to 10% at 310 °C. In addition, the grain selectivities of acrolein, acrylic acid and by-products, obtained by extrapolation to zero conversion are non-zero as can be seen in Fig. 5. This has been confirmed by results obtained at conversions well below 10%. Based on these facts three parallel reactions of propene have to be taken into account as shown below:

Model calculations have shown that it is not necessary to consider the additional path acrolein by-products [10].
Both schemes are exclusively based on the observation of the gas phase. The fact that acrolein is not taken into account in the proposed network of propane oxidation does by no means imply that it does not exist as an essential intermediate. However, as its concentration is negligible it does not interfere in the modelisation of the gas phase composition along the reactor.
Thus, the reaction network is to be considered as a simplified version of the different reaction pathways proposed in the literature for both propane and propene oxidation. There is agreement that the sequence propane–propene–acrolein–acrylic acid is, at least, one of the main paths [6], [8], [9]. Similar networks have been proposed in the case of Mo–V–Sb–Nb mixed oxides [13] where a major side path goes through acetone to acetic acid which can be the preferential one following adequate precalcination conditions [14]. The side paths propene–acetone–acetic acid [8] or propane–acetone (via propanol)–acetic acid [6], [9] have equally been considered on Mo–V–Te–Nb mixed oxides. Besides, the formation of acetic acid through further oxidation of acrylic acid has not been excluded [8], [9] and verified recently [26]. Thus, the observation of acetic acid without detection of acetone in our measurements is not in contradiction with mechanistic considerations. Especially since we measure only the gas phase concentration of the species and we do not see the species on the surface of the catalyst.
At this point it is interesting to note that we did observe the formation of small quantities of acetone and its further oxidation to acetic acid in the partial oxidation of propene at low conversions on a typical acrolein catalyst in the same experimental set-up as used in the present study [15]. Thus, experimental artefacts cannot be incriminated for the failure of acetone detection in the actual investigation as the resolution of the GC is sufficient to discriminate between acrolein and acetone.
In addition to a suitable network appropriate rate expressions are needed in order to describe the evolution of the concentration profiles along the reactor. Different functions have been tested and evaluated by the criteria of both agreement with the experimental data and minimal numbers of adjustable parameters. We had already shown [10] that in the case of propane oxidation first order reactions are sufficient. The rates of the individual reactions can be presented in the form
(7)
where the reaction rate rm,kl in pathway k, l is given in mol/(g s) and the concentration of the organic compound k in mol/cm3. In fact, the curves in Fig. 2 have been calculated after adjustment of four first order rate constants and show satisfying agreement with the experimental results. The calculated curves in Fig. 3 confirm an appropriate modelling of the reacting system. The corresponding numerical values of the kinetic coefficients are included in Table 1.
Table 1. Temperature dependence of the kinetic coefficients in the propane network
T (°C) k01 (cm3/(g s)) k12 (cm3/(g s)) k13 (cm3/(g s)) k23 (cm3/(g s))

385 1.6 26 5.5 1.4
400 1.8 27 6.3 1.6
420 2.3 29 6.6 2.9
Due to the rather low propene concentration the evaluation of the kinetic parameters might be somewhat erroneous because of experimental scatter. Therefore, the attempt was made to improve the precision of the model description by the investigation of the propene oxidation itself using the same catalyst. We have already shown [10] that the activity is much higher. In addition, as pointed out before, the reaction network to be considered is more complex. Nevertheless, the first order approximation is sufficiently precise as illustrated by the good agreement between calculated curves and experimental data in Fig. 4, Fig. 5. The consideration of an additional path acrolein—by-products did not show any improvement.
However, it must be mentioned that the catalyst is evolving if one switches from propane to propene and it needs nearly 72 h to attain a new steady state. Therefore, the propene oxidation scheme may safely be inserted in the simpler propane network but one cannot expect to use the separately determined values of the kinetic coefficients in the latter case.
The evolution of the catalyst performance is represented in Fig. 6. The data have been taken 12 and 72 h after replacement of propane by propene in the feed. One can see that the activity of the catalyst had decreased during this period, e.g. at τm=0.52 g s/cm3 the conversion (1−ypropene) was reduced roughly from 79 to 70%. Simultaneously the reactor selectivity to acrylic acid increased at this point from 67 to 74%. It must be noted that the activity decrease is at least partially irreversible, switching back to propane did not restore the original value even after 3 days on stream.

There is another point which remains somewhat puzzling. At 360 °C the oxidation of both hydrocarbons has been studied and the kinetic coefficients are listed in Table 1, Table 2. The difference between the values of k12, determined in the propane case, and k12+k14, characterising the transformation of propene to higher value products in the propene case, seems too high by comparison with the activity decrease illustrated in Fig. 6.

The difference reduces if the rate is of fractional order in propene, that is
(8)
This form of the rate law has shown to be appropriate in a number of cases where networks of singular reactions were used to describe oxidations of organic compounds in tubular reactors [16]. It should not interfere much in the propane case as c1 remains always very small. By contrast, in the propene case the value of k12 should increase if curve fitting leads to a value of b greater than unity.
We therefore introduced the rate expressions of Eq. (8) and adjusted the whole set of kinetic coefficients simultaneously for both cases. The results are somewhat disappointing. It is possible to describe both reacting systems using the same set of kinetic coefficients if acrolein (species 4) is neglected. However, the agreement between experimental results and modelling remains limited as shown in Fig. 7. Especially the variation of the concentration of acrylic acid formed by oxidation of propane, we are mainly interested in, is not well simulated. The approach is too simple to describe the evolution of the catalyst in interaction with the gas phase.

In conclusion, the partial oxidation of propane to acrylic acid should be described by use of the network proposed in combination with the first order approach of the rate expressions in order to simulate the reactor operation. The dependence of the kinetic coefficients on the different operational parameters will be examined in the following.
3.2. Influence of reaction conditions
3.2.1. Influence of the temperature
The oxidation of propane has been studied in the temperature range
. The kinetic coefficients determined are listed in Table 1. The corresponding activation energies in Table 3. Riekert [12] has shown how to use such kinetic coefficients kkl to derive characteristic parameters of the catalyst, namely the grain selectivity of formation of a compound and its stability as an intermediate. In the present case we are interested in the selectivity of formation of acrylic acid from propene
(9)
and the stabilities of propene
(10)
and acrylic acid
(11)
respectively. The temperature dependence of these parameters is summarised in Table 4.

400 0.81 0.05 16.9
420 0.81 0.06 10.0
The selectivity to acrylic acid is slightly decreasing, its relative constancy depends on the fact that the activation energies of pathways 1, 2 and 1, 3 are rather similar. By contrast, the stability of the target molecule is reduced to half if the temperature is raised from 360 to 420 °C. As the decrease of the reactor selectivity with conversion is governed by the stability parameter, this means that a compromise has to be found in reactor operation between the selective formation of acrylic acid, favoured by low temperatures, and the space time yield, increased by higher temperatures due to the acceleration of propane oxidation.
3.2.2. Influence of the oxygen concentration
The oxygen–propane ratio in the feed has been varied in the range 1.5<xO2/xpropane<4. For all conditions the conversion of oxygen remained in the range 0<XO2<0.5 and thus, oxygen was left over at the reactor outlet. The evolution of the concentrations yi as a function of the residence time and of the reactor selectivities as a function of the propane conversion is represented in Fig. 8, Fig. 9. The results illustrate the weak influence of the oxygen content in the feed compared to experimental scatter. The influence of oxygen has not been studied in the literature so far in the case of Mo–V–Te–Nb mixed oxides. Védrine and co-workers [13] determined a broken order less than one relative to oxygen in the formation of propene from propane arguing that the reoxidation of the catalyst by molecular oxygen appeared to be rate determining. In addition, they report that Graselli et al. [17], [18] postulated the reaction to be zeroth order respective to oxygen in the case of Ni–Mo-oxide catalysts. Thus, one may equally expect a small influence of the oxygen concentration in the present case and it therefore seems tolerable to retain the first order approach with respect to the hydrocarbons and to include the influence of oxygen in the adjusted kinetic coefficients as it has been discussed recently [16] and in more detail in the case of butadiene partial oxidation [19].

In the present investigation, in spite of the experimental scatter the kinetic coefficients (Table 5) and the derived characteristic parameters (Table 6) show some interesting trends if the oxygen content relative to propane is increased. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane remains relatively unaffected. All rate expressions lie in the interval 0.84 ± 0.08 g/cm3 s. This is in agreement with the observations cited above [13], [17], [18]. The grain selectivity to acrylic acid is nearly the same for all propane to oxygen ratios and the stability of the latter (λ2) remains at a high level.

4:1 0.84 0.04 21.7
In conclusion, it seems reasonable to restrict the oxygen content in the feed to the lower values of the range investigated so far.
3.2.3. Influence of the water content
The influence of the concentration of water in the feed is illustrated in Fig. 10, Fig. 11. It is clearly seen that both the activity of the catalyst and the reactor selectivity to acrylic acid are enhanced by the addition of water vapour. This is equally shown by the adjusted kinetic coefficients summarised in Table 7. The rate of propane dehydrogenation is more than doubled by the addition of 20% water vapour and the rate of formation of acrylic acid from propene is increased up to a factor of four at 50 vol.% water. The total oxidation of propene and the further reactions of acrylic acid to COx are less influenced. Even if the results show some scatter there seems to be a relatively large domain between 20 and 40% water vapour where the values of the grain selectivity to and the stability of acrylic acid remain on a constant high level, as can be seen from Table 8.

The beneficial influence of water vapour in partial oxidations of organic compounds is not new. However, the water concentrations used for instance in former investigations of propene [2], i-butene [20] or acrolein [21] oxidation were much lower than in the present case. Védrine and co-workers [22] presented recently a study of the effect of water on the partial oxidation of propene to acrylic and acetic acids on Mo–V–Sb–Nb mixed oxides. They observed the highest rates of formation at 40 vol.% water in the feed, for both acids, and claimed that “water plays a crucial role in preserving the catalyst structure by maintaining the active sites in a partially reduced oxidation state”.
As we restricted ourselves to the observation of the gas phase composition we cannot interpret the beneficial effect of water on the catalysing solid in the present case. Concerning reactor operation we would favour a water content of about 20–30 vol.%.
3.3. Aspects of application
In this work the yield of acrylic acid was calculated relative to the propane content in the feed (, ): Besides this quantity the space time yield is an important parameter in order to evaluate the performance of the catalyst. Different values obtained on Mo–V–Te–Nb mixed oxides are compared in Table 9. Taking into account the different operational conditions the results reported by the different groups are of the same order of magnitude. The phosphor containing catalyst, added in Table 9, shows a space time yield largely above those values and one cannot but agree with the claim of the authors [23] that “while the catalyst reported here is not the most selective, it has exceptional productivity for acrylic acid”. However, further work has to confirm this performance. To our knowledge, no other catalytic system had been reported so far exceeding the values obtained in the case of Mo–V–Te–Nb mixed oxides.

As it is shown exemplarily in Table 9 or summarised by Lin [6] the conversions reported in the patent literature are rather high. Therefore, it is interesting to simulate the evolution at higher values of the residence time by using the model network described in Section 3.1 and the corresponding kinetic coefficients. Typical results of the extrapolation are shown in Fig. 12. It is clear that yields of acrylic acid higher than 30% are possible.

The spacetime yields may reach 65 g acrylic acid per kg catalyst and hour. However, at high conversions of propane the stability of acrylic acid λ2, especially the coefficient k23 become important parameters. Thus, the limited precision in determining the latter incites to some caution and the simulated results have to be validated by additional measurements.
If we look at the reaction networks as a guideline for further developments it appears that the mayor drawback seems to be the rather high selectivity of formation of by-products from propene. As the typical catalyst in the classical two-step process shows a high selectivity from propene to acroleine [25] while being rather inactive in propane oxidation it seems interesting to investigate either a mixed catalyst or a structured catalyst bed for a further increase of the acrylic acid yield in the one step process.
Fig. 13 represents the results of a simulation where the network of the partial oxidation of propene to acroleine [25] is inserted in the network of the propane oxidation, adding acroleine as an active intermediate. The fixed bed is supposed to be composed of 75% of the Mo–V–Te–Nb mixed oxide, investigated in the present study, and of 25% of the propene to acroleine catalyst [25]. In addition, the single rates are superposed using the corresponding rate constant and the residence time related to the total mass of the two active compounds. Fig. 13 illustrates that the selectivity to by-products is indeed reduced but the selectivity to acrylic acid is equally lowered by comparison to the one step catalyst. The reason is simply that in the simulated case the further oxidation of acrolein to acrylic acid represents now a bottle neck. In fact, simulating with a considerably higher rate coefficient for this path leads to a selectivity to acrylic acid of about 75%. In conclusion, it is not sufficient to reduce the formation of by-products from propene but the oxidation of acrolein to acrylic acid has equally to be increased.

The use of two different catalysts in the partial oxidation of propane has equally been proposed in a recent patent [27]. However, this patent describes a different approach as the hydrocarbon is transformed in the absence of molecular oxygen and the catalyst subsequently restored by a mixture of O2/He/Kr/H2O. In the present case the use of a co-catalyst is proposed to remedy the unsatisfactory selectivity in the presence of oxygen as the co-catalyst is known to contain an oxygen donor phase.
4. Conclusions
The present investigation of the Mo–V–Te–Nb mixed oxide has shown that its catalytical performance can rival not only with the results reported in the open literature but also with regard to the claims in different patents.
The attempt to model the kinetics by a reaction network is quite successful. Based on the criteria of simplicity and the minimum of adjustable parameters a system of first order rate expressions with respect to organic compounds allows the description of the reacting system. The influence of the O2 and H2O concentrations is taken into consideration by the values of the different rate coefficients. Due to this simplification those coefficients have to be readjusted after a modification of the initial conditions at the reactor inlet. It has been discussed elsewhere [19] why this procedure is preferable to more complex but generally valid rate expressions.
The combined use of the reaction network and the appropriate rate expressions leads to guidelines for further improvements by both the modifications of the catalyst or its operating conditions. Thus, simulations give an indication how the yield or the space time yield of acrylic acid may be improved. On the other hand, simulations can save experimental validations of possible developments. Thus, one could imagine to use a structured bed of catalyst in order to improve the selective formation of acrylic acid from propene. The calculation has shown that this has no positive effect as long as the addition of a second catalyst does not sufficiently accelerate the further oxidation of the intermediate acroleine. A “better” catalyst should take into account this requirement.
Further investigations will focus on the influence of the simultaneous presence of propene, the stronger oxygen acceptor, and propane as well as on the conditions of the running in of the catalyst. To that purpose parallel kinetic and electrochemical measurements by use of solid electrolyte potentiometry will be made.

If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
