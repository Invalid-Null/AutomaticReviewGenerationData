Organometallic model complexes elucidate the active gallium species in alkane dehydrogenation catalysts based on ligand effects in Ga K-edge XANES†‡
Gallium-modified zeolites are known catalysts for the dehydrogenation of alkanes, reactivity that finds industrial application in the aromatization of light alkanes by Ga-ZSM5. While the role of gallium cations in alkane activation is well known, the oxidation state and coordination environment of gallium under reaction conditions has been the subject of debate. Edge shifts in Ga K-edge XANES spectra acquired under reaction conditions have long been interpreted as evidence for reduction of Ga(III) to Ga(I). However, a change in oxidation state is not the only factor that can give rise to a change in the XANES spectrum. In order to better understand the XANES spectra of working catalysts, we have synthesized a series of molecular model compounds and grafted surface organometallic Ga species and compared their XANES spectra to those of gallium-based catalysts acquired under reducing conditions. We demonstrate that changes in the identity and number of gallium nearest neighbors can give rise to changes in XANES spectra similar to those attributed in literature to changes in oxidation state. Specifically, spectral features previously attributed to Ga(I) may be equally well interpreted as evidence for low-coordinate Ga(III) alkyl or hydride species. These findings apply both to gallium-impregnated zeolite catalysts and to silica-supported single site gallium catalysts, the latter of which is found to be active and selective for dehydrogenation of propane and hydrogenation of propylene.
Introduction
Acidic zeolites containing gallium ions convert light alkanes to aromatics;1–12 such catalysts are used commercially in the UOP Cyclar process. The catalyst is bifunctional: the metal cations are catalytic for dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins, which then oligomerize and subsequently form aromatics over zeolite Brønsted acid sites.1,2,8,9,13–20 The reaction product distribution depends on the ratio of gallium cations to acid sites, and for catalysts containing few acid sites, olefin is the main reaction product.9,21–24
While the activity of gallium cations in alkane dehydrogenation is generally accepted, the structure of the active site(s) under reaction conditions, and therefore the mechanism by which the reaction proceeds, has not been definitively established. For the most heavily studied catalyst, Ga-ZSM-5, a variety of active site structures have been proposed. These include Ga3+ species associated with zeolite [AlO4] anions such as isolated gallyl cations [GaO]+, gallium hydrides [GaH2]+ or [GaH]2+, or a reduced Ga+ species stabilized by the negative charge of the zeolite framework. Alternately, alkane dehydrogenation has been proposed to take place on gallium oxide particles outside of the zeolite pores. Given the long-standing interest in understanding and exploiting mechanisms for selective functionalization of alkanes, it is of significance to establish whether the mechanism of C–H bond activation is redox or non-redox in nature. In particular, the existence of Ga+ under reaction conditions would support the viability of alkane activation via oxidative addition/reductive elimination pathways more commonly observed in homogeneous catalysts involving late transition metals, whereas Ga3+ would be more consistent with a non-oxidative, heterolytic C–H activation mechanism such as that now believed to occur on heterogeneous, single site Cr, Co, and Zn catalysts.25–28
Several groups have attempted to ascertain the oxidation state of gallium under reaction conditions through the use of X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES). The first such experiments were reported by Meitzner et al.7 They report that upon exposure to hydrogen at 510 °C, the XANES edge energy of gallium impregnated into H-ZSM5 decreases rapidly from 10 372.7 eV to 10 368.0 eV. Noting that the edge energy for gallium metal is 10 367.1 eV and that XANES edge energy often shifts systematically with oxidation state, Meitzner et al. proposed that the observed edge shift could be attributable to reduction from Ga3+ to Ga+, though they also suggest that “a hydride form of Ga stabilized by interactions with basic oxygens within ZSM5 channels” which “may represent zeolite-analogs of GaHCl2” may also be responsible for XANES spectra acquired under reducing conditions.
Following Meitzner et al., a number of other investigators have also reported XANES edge shifts as evidence for apparent reduction of gallium upon exposure to hydrogen at high temperature. Wei et al.29 examined the XANES spectra of Ga–H-BEA prepared by impregnation of aqueous gallium nitrate into zeolite beta, and found an edge energy shift from 10 375.0 eV in the dried but fully oxidized catalyst to 10 370.5 eV after treatment in H2 at 550 °C followed by cooling to RT in H2. Hensen and collaborators30 examined chemical vapor deposition of trimethylgallium on H-ZSM5. Upon reaction with Brønsted acid sites in the zeolite, this precursor is expected to form [Ga(CH3)2]+ coordinated to two framework oxygen atoms. Hensen et al. report an edge energy of 10 373.0 eV for this species at room temperature, which decreases to 10 371.5 eV upon heating above 360 °C in hydrogen and increases to 10 374.5 eV upon subsequent exposure to oxygen at 500 °C. Recently, Faro and coworkers31 reported the treatment of Ga–H-ZSM5 in hydrogen or propane at temperatures up to 600 °C. They find that their data can be completely accounted for by two species, which they assign as Ga3+ at 10 372 eV and Ga+ at 10 368 eV. However, they also note that no reference for Ga+ in a zeolite-like environment is available to confirm this assignment aside from H2-treated zeolite catalyst itself. XANES investigation of authentic Ga+ has been reported by Wilkinson,32 who examined GaZr2(PO4)3 and a Ga+-doped modification of β′′-alumina, and confirmed the structures of these materials using X-ray diffraction. His work confirmed that edge positions for Ga+ are shifted to lower energies by ∼5 eV versus octahedral Ga3+ in a ZnGa2O4 reference, though absolute energies are not reported.
The reported appearance of Ga+ under reducing conditions in Ga-zeolite catalysts has led some authors to conclude that Ga+ is an essential species in the catalytic cycle for alkane dehydrogenation, with alkane activation proceeding via an oxidative addition/reductive elimination mechanism.12,33,34 At the same time, a number of computational chemistry studies35–38 on model Ga-zeolite catalysts have found that non-redox mechanisms involving heterolytic cleavage or sigma bond-metathesis-like reactions on Ga3+ cations proceed with much lower barriers than those required for reduction of gallium to Ga+. Recent publications25–28 have shown that for silica-supported Zn, Co, and Cr cations (all of which are more reducible than Ga), alkane dehydrogenation proceeds via non-redox mechanisms. These findings and the rarity of Ga+ compounds outside of a limited number of organometallic complexes purposely designed for the study of gallium in unusual oxidation states39–46 are at odds with repeated observation of shifts in Ga XANES spectra consistent with formation of Ga+ in Ga-zeolite catalysts under reducing conditions. It is therefore of interest to determine whether these XANES shifts provide unambiguous evidence for the existence of reduced gallium, or whether other, non-reductive events could give rise to similar changes in the XANES absorption edge.
We report here the synthesis and XANES characterization of a series of molecular and surface-bound organometallic model compounds designed to provide insight into (non-redox) ligand effects on gallium K edge XANES spectra. In addition, we report the preparation and catalytic performance of single site Ga–SiO2 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation, and the XANES spectra of Ga–SiO2 and Ga–H-BEA catalysts acquired under reducing conditions. The study of alkane dehydrogenation on supports such as silica that lack strong Brønsted acid sites provides a useful complement to study of Ga-zeolite catalysts by enabling the dehydrogenation reaction to be investigated directly without interference from subsequent proton-catalyzed oligomerization and aromatization reactions. Comparison of XANES spectra of molecular models to those of working catalysts, and interpretation of these spectra in terms of molecular orbital theory, highlight the heretofore underappreciated importance of ligand effects in gallium K edge XANES, and the implications of these effects for characterization of catalytically relevant species in gallium-based alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.
Experimental
Synthesis of supported gallium catalysts
Ga–HBEA Incipient wetness impregnation of 5.0 g of the acid form of beta zeolite (silicon to aluminum ratio ∼25) with an aqueous solution of Ga(NO3)3·xH2O (0.917 g in 14 mL H2O) was followed by drying overnight at 50 °C. Final gallium loading by elemental analysis was 3.44% (Galbraith Labs). Ga–SiO2 3.00 g of Ga(NO3)3·xH2O and 3.00 g of citric acid were dissolved in 15 mL of deionized water. The pH was adjusted to 11 with 4 mL of NH4OH. The solution was impregnated onto 20.0 g of SiO2 (Davisil 646). The impregnated precatalyst was dried overnight at 110 °C, then calcined at 550 °C for 3 h in air. Final gallium loading by elemental analysis was 2.64% (Galbraith labs). Synthesis of organogallium(iii) reference compounds The syntheses of organogallium(iii) reference compounds were carried out in a nitrogen-atmosphere glove box. The syntheses of the gallium compounds were done at room temperature unless otherwise stated. Crystalline GaCl3 (99.9%, Sigma) and 0.5 M GaCl3 in pentane (Sigma) were used as received. Solid LiCH2Si(CH3)3 from a 0.5 M pentane solution (Sigma) was recrystallized from hexanes prior to use. Solid t-BuLi from a 1.7 M pentane solution (Sigma) was recrystallized form pentane prior to use. LiOSiPh3,47 GaCl2(CH2Si(CH3)3)48 GaCl(CH2Si(CH3)3)2,48 and Ga(t-Bu)2(OC6H2-2,4,6-t-Bu3)49 were synthesized according to published procedures. Ga(OSiPh3)3 (1) A 20 mL scintillation vial was charged with 30 mg (0.18 mmol) GaCl3, 5 mL THF and a magnetic stir bar. 144 mg (0.51 mmol) LiOSiPh3 was slowly added in small portions to the stirring GaCl3 solution at room temperature over an hour. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The mixture was then filtered over a ceramic filter frit and the solvent was removed in vacuo. The product was then extracted with 2 mL portions of toluene twice. The pooled toluene fractions were then dried under vacuum to obtain a colorless powder (309 mg, 65.4% yield). 1H-NMR (500 MHz, C6D6, 25 °C): δ 7.24–7.16 (m, 27H); 7.84–7.78 (m, 18H). Ga(CH2Si(CH3)3)(OSiPh3)2 (2) A 20 mL scintillation vial was charged with 50 mg (0.22 mmol) GaCl2(CH2Si(CH3)3), 2 mL THF and a magnetic stir bar. To the stirring mixture was added a 3 mL THF solution containing 125 mg (0.44 mmol) LiOSiPh3 over a one-hour period. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The mixture was then filtered over a ceramic filter frit. The filtrate was then dried in vacuo and the product was extracted with 2 mL portions of hexanes twice. The pooled hexanes fractions were then dried under vacuum to obtain a clear, colorless solid (113 mg, 93% yield). 1H-NMR (500 MHz, C6D6, 25 °C): δ 0.13 (s, Si(CH3)3); 7.24–7.16 (m); 7.84–7.78 (m). Ga(CH2Si(CH3)3)2(OSiPh3) (3) A 20 mL scintillation vial was charged with 50 mg (0.18 mmol) GaCl(CH2Si(CH3)3)2, 2.5 mL THF and a magnetic stir bar. To the stirring mixture was slowly added a 2.5 mL THF solution containing 50 mg (0.18 mmol) LiOSiPh3 over a one-hour period. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The mixture was filtered over a ceramic filter frit and the filtrate was dried under vacuum. The product was then extracted with 2 mL portions of hexanes twice. The pooled hexanes fractions were then dried in vacuo to obtain a clear, colorless viscous liquid (52 mg, 56% yield). 1H-NMR (500 MHz, C6D6, 25 °C): δ 0.00 (s, Si(CH3)3); 7.24–7.16 (m); 7.84–7.78 (m). Ga(CH2Si(CH3)3)3 (4) A 20 mL scintillation vial was charged with 2.85 mL of a 0.5 M GaCl3–pentane solution (1.43 mmol Ga) and a magnetic stir bar. 402 mg (4.27 mmol) LiCH2SiMe3 was added in small portions to the stirring GaCl3 solution at room temperature over a 30 minute period. The reaction forms a white precipitate upon stirring at room temperature overnight. The mixture was then filtered over a ceramic filter frit and washed with 5 mL portions of hexanes twice. The pooled organic fractions were then dried under vacuum to obtain a clear, colorless viscous liquid (309 mg, 65.4% yield). 1H-NMR (500 MHz, C6D6, 25 °C): δ 0.13 (s, 27H, Si(CH3)3); 0.90 (m (broad), Ga–CH2–Si, 6H). Ga(CH3SiMe3)3(OP(n-Bu)3)50 (5) A 20 mL scintillation vial was charged with 109 mg of OP(n-Bu)3 (Sigma Aldrich, 99%), 3 mL of pentane, and a magnetic stir bar. Separately, a 20 mL scintillation vial was charged with 165 mg of Ga(CH2SiMe3)3, a magnetic stir bar, 3 mL of pentane. The phosphine oxide solution was then added dropwise to the trialkylgallium solution over the course of 2 min. The mixture was stirred for 30 min, followed by solvent removal under vacuum to obtain a white gel, which was subsequently recrystallized from hexanes. 1H-NMR (500 MHz, C6D6, 25 °C): δ −0.73 (s, CH2Si(CH3)3, 6H); −0.04 (m, Si(CH3), 27H); 0.94 (t, 9H); 1.42 (m, 6H), 1.50 (m, 6H), 1.73 (m, 6H). 31P-NMR (202 MHz, C6D6, 25 °C): δ 58.2. Ga(CH2SiMe3)3–SiO2 (4-1) 1.4 g of silica (Davisil 646) was treated at 700 °C overnight in flowing argon (UHP, Airgas), then transferred into the glovebox using airfree handling techniques. Treated silica was slurried in ∼4 mL of pentane, to which a pentane solution of 0.331 g of (4) was added. After stirring for 2 h, volatiles were removed under vacuum. Ga(CH2SiMe3)3–HBEA (4-2) 0.700 g of H-BEA (silicon to aluminum ratio ∼25) was dried under vacuum at 200 °C, then transferred into the glovebox using airfree handling techniques. A pentane solution (∼4 mL) of (4) was added to a pentane slurry (∼6 mL) of the zeolite. After stirring for 2 h, volatiles were removed under vacuum.
Catalyst testing
Catalytic performance was tested in a vertical, downflow arrangement using a ½′′ quartz tube reactor in a clamshell furnace. A quartz wool plug was placed in the center of the tube, and ∼0.5 g of catalyst loaded above the plug. The catalyst was ramped to the desired temperature under flowing argon (UHP, Airgas). Dehydrogenation was tested using 2.3 vol% propane in argon flowing at 60 mL min−1. Hydrogenation was tested by flowing 99.999% hydrogen at 15 mL min−1 and 2.0% propylene in argon at 30 mL min−1. Total pressure was maintained at 6 psig using a back pressure regulator. Products were analyzed by gas chromatography using an HP 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 50 m GS-Alumina capillary column and a flame ionization detector.
X-ray absorption spectroscopy
X-ray absorption measurements were performed at beamlines 10-BM and 10-ID at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory. Measurements were made in transmission mode. Concurrent collection of a reference spectrum of β-Ga2O3 was used to calibrate X-ray energies: the absorption edge, defined as the position of the lowest energy inflection point in the edge region of the X-ray absorption spectrum, was set to 10 375.1 eV for the β-Ga2O3 reference sample. X-ray absorption data were processed using the Demeter 0.9.21 software suite51 and WinXAS v3.2 software using standard background subtraction and normalization procedures.
Operando reduction was conducted in a continuous flow reactor, which consisted of a quartz tube (1′′ OD, 10′′ length) placed between two Ultra-Torr unions sealed on their obverse ends with Kapton windows. Ball valves welded to the necks of the fittings provided for gas inlet and outlet. A six-well stainless steel sample holder placed inside the quartz tube held self-supporting pressed pellets of sample. The amount of catalyst used to form each pellet was sufficient to produce an edge step (post-edge X-ray absorption minus pre-edge X-ray absorption) of approximately one absorbance unit.
Additional measurements were made on toluene solutions of gallium reference compounds. Glovebox-prepared solutions were filled into J. Young NMR tubes, which were then walked to the beamline and aligned such that the X-ray beam passed diametrically through the center of the NMR tube. Solution concentrations were prepared to produce an edge step of approximately one absorbance unit.
Theoretical calculations
Calculations were performed using the PBE density functional,52 plane-wave basis sets53 with a kinetic energy cut-off of 400 eV, projector augmented-wave cores54 for all atoms, and 3 × 3 × 5 Monkhorst–Pack k point grids. Calculations were performed within VASP 5.3.3.55
The structures of likely catalytic species were optimized within the full crystallographic unit cell of zeolite beta. In these calculations, the positions of atoms in the literature-reported crystal structure56 (AlSi63O128) were re-optimized without changing the volume of the unit cell (12.63 Å × 12.63 Å × 26.19 Å).
In addition, an attempt was made to model zeolite catalytic structures using Al(OSiH3)4 cluster models of the zeolite framework. These calculations were performed using the second order Möller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) and triple-zeta quality basis sets (TZVP)57 available in the D.02 version of Gaussian-09 quantum chemistry software.58
Results
The conventional gallium-based alkane aromatization catalyst is prepared by impregnation of an acidic zeolite with an aqueous solution of gallium nitrate, followed by calcination in air. In the present study, the acid form of zeolite beta (Si : Al ∼25) was chosen, and impregnated with gallium nitrate to produce a catalyst containing 3.4 wt% Ga (confirmed by elemental analysis). XANES spectra of this catalyst were then collected while heating in hydrogen from RT to 500 °C. The results are shown in Fig. 1a. The corresponding ΔXANES, generated by subtraction of the room temperature spectrum, are shown in Fig. 1b.

(Right) Delta-XANES: spectra of Ga–HBEA heated in flowing hydrogen up to 500 °C from which the spectrum of Ga–HBEA at RT has been subtracted. Peaks at 10 372.2 eV and 10 375.0 eV are highlighted with vertical bars.
At room temperature, the XANES absorption edge is at 10 375.2 eV (note that all edge energies in the present work have been calibrated against the 10 375.1 eV edge energy of a β-Ga2O3 reference spectrum collected concurrently with each sample. By convention, the edge energy is defined as the energy of the first inflection point in absorption edge). Above the edge, the prominent absorption maximum at 10 377.4 eV and shoulder near 10 381 eV are characteristic59–61 of tetrahedral Ga3+. This assignment is confirmed by EXAFS, which reveals four first-nearest neighbor oxygen atoms with an average Ga–O distance of 1.81 Å (see ESI‡).
Upon exposure to hydrogen, no change in the spectrum is observed below 140 °C. Above this temperature, a slight increase in absorption below the edge, nearly invisible in the XANES in Fig. 1a, is revealed in the ΔXANES in Fig. 1b as a small peak at 10 375.0 eV. The intensity of this peak grows steadily up to 300 °C. Above 300 °C, the intensity of this peak begins to decrease, while a second feature emerges in both the XANES and ΔXANES at 10 372.2 eV, grows rapidly in intensity with further heating, and reaches maximum intensity at 500 °C. The edge energy shifts systematically from 10 375.2 eV at RT to 10 370.8 eV at 500 °C. Changes in the XANES reported here are consistent with reports from previous researchers,7,29–31 and have previously been interpreted as evidence for the reduction of Ga3+ to Ga+.
In addition to gallium-impregnated zeolite, we also prepared a ‘single site’ gallium on silica catalyst, and examined both its catalytic performance and its XANES spectrum under reducing conditions. As with zeolite supports, silica impregnated with an aqueous solution of gallium nitrate yields silica-supported Ga2O3 particles. A similar result was obtained using gallium acetylacetonate. However, the combination of gallium nitrate with citric acid allowed the preparation of a catalyst containing primarily isolated gallium cations supported on silica, with no evidence for Ga2O3 by EXAFS (see the ESI‡). The use of citric acid in facilitating dispersion and enabling preparation of single site metal cations on silica has ample precedent in the literature. The synthesis and characterization of Ga–SiO2 catalysts is discussed in greater detail in the ESI.‡
The catalytic activity of Ga–SiO2 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation is shown in Fig. 2. At 500 °C, nearly steady rates of propylene production are achieved within the first 30 minutes on stream, and maintained for at least 6 h (the length of the test). The catalyst is 96% selective to propylene and hydrogen, with the remaining 4% accounted for entirely by methane and ethylene. Formation of coke, easily seen as a color transformation of the catalyst bed from white to black, was barely observed after 6 h at 500 °C. Very low rates of coke formation and lack of aromatic products indicate low levels of Brønsted acidity in the catalyst, a finding independently confirmed by pyridine adsorption studies62 (see the ESI‡). As expected, operation at higher temperatures led to greater initial activity, lower selectivity, and substantially greater formation of coke. Ga–SiO2 catalysts produced by alternate synthetic routes leading to lower fractions of isolated, tetrahedral Ga3+ cations were found to be less active (see the ESI‡), suggesting that isolated tetrahedral Ga3+ cations are responsible for selective propane dehydrogenation.
Fig. 2 Turnover frequency (mol propylene produced per mol gallium per h) (left) and selectivity to propylene (right) in propane dehydrogenation over Ga–SiO2 catalysts at 500 °C (blue diamonds), 550 °C (purple squares), and 600 °C (red triangles). Conditions: 2.6 wt% Ga–SiO2, 0.5 g of catalyst, 60 mL min−1 2.3% propane in argon.
In addition to propane dehydrogenation, propylene hydrogenation activity of Ga–SiO2 catalysts was also examined. The results are presented in Fig. 3. Activity for propylene hydrogenation on Ga–SiO2 catalysts in the present study is detected at temperatures as low as 110 °C. At 200 °C, a 72 h trial revealed steady state activity over the length of the trial. Selectivity to propane is 100% within detection limits. Since gallium oxide is known to be a poor hydrogenation catalyst,7 observation of significant activity for propylene hydrogenation provides evidence that the synthetic approach taken here produces a significant population of isolated Ga3+ cations, which are active and stable catalytic sites under olefin hydrogenation conditions.
Fig. 3 Turnover frequency (mol propane produced per mol gallium per hour) for propylene hydrogenation over Ga–SiO2 at 100–200 °C. Conditions: 2.6 wt% Ga–SiO2, 0.5 g of catalyst, 24 mL min−1 3.5% hydrogen in helium and 36 mL min−1 2.0% propylene in argon. Six measurements made over the course of 1 h are shown for each temperature.
In situ XANES spectra of Ga–SiO2 catalysts exposed to hydrogen at RT, 500 °C, and 650 °C are presented in Fig. 4a, with the corresponding ΔXANES shown in Fig. 4b. Upon heating from RT to 500 °C, the XANES edge energy decreases slightly from 10 374.5 eV to 10 374.3 eV, while the ΔXANES reveal two features at 10 371.1 eV and 10 373.5 eV. Upon further heating to 650 °C, a large absorption feature appears in the XANES at 10 370.9 eV, leading to a moderate increase in intensity of the higher energy feature and a large increase in intensity of the lower energy feature in the ΔXANES. The differing evolution of these two peaks with increasing temperature suggests that they arise from two separate species, the lower-energy of which is formed in greater concentration at higher temperatures. The final edge energy at 650 °C is 10 370.4 eV.

Right figure: Delta XANES: spectra of Ga–SiO2 in flowing hydrogen at 500 °C (blue) and 650 °C (gold) from which the RT spectrum has been subtracted. Peaks at 10 371.1 eV and 10 373.5 eV are marked with vertical bars.
Shifts in the XANES during hydrogen treatment for Ga–SiO2 appear at temperatures 200–300 °C higher than those observed for Ga–HBEA. However, the same pattern is observed in the ΔXANES for both catalysts, with a small initial peak at lower temperature being overtaken by a much larger, lower energy peak at higher temperature. These findings suggest that the chemical processes occurring at Ga sites in Ga–SiO2 and Ga–HBEA may be similar, with the differences in temperature (and absolute XANES edge positions) reflecting the difference in the strength and polarization of Ga–O bonds to silica (where Ga–OSi bonds are more covalent) vs. in zeolites (where interaction with Si–O–Al sites has greater ionic character). Importantly, ΔXANES spectra from both catalysts demonstrate that shifts to lower edge energy under reducing conditions arise from sequential formation of (at least) two separate species. This finding, which has not been previously reported in XANES investigation of Ga-derived catalysts, may be attributed to a two-step process in which exposure to reducing conditions drives an A → B → C reaction. The relatively low population of species B is consistent with similar activation barriers for the A → B and B → C reactions.
In order to better understand what species might give rise to the observed XANES spectra, a series of molecular Ga(iii) model compounds with different ligands were synthesized and their XANES spectra examined. Investigation of molecular analogs for reactive centers is a common approach in the X-ray investigation of biological systems.63–67 This approach is much less common in heterogeneous catalysis, in part because many heterogeneous catalysts do not have good molecular analogs (e.g. metal nanoparticles) and in part because the lower thermal stability of organometallic materials may limit comparison of their catalytic performance to heterogeneous systems under relevant reaction conditions. Molecular model compounds have, however, proven useful in assignment of spectroscopic features, particularly for single site heterogeneous catalyst systems68–71 including silica-supported gallium alkyls.72 It is for this purpose that they are employed in the present study.
Dimeric [Ga(OSiPh3)3]2 (1), which contains Ga3+ ions with four Ga–O–Si bonds, provides a well-defined model for the gallium environments in Ga–HBEA and Ga/SiO2 catalysts in their as-prepared states. As shown in Fig. 5, the XANES spectrum of this model compound agrees well with that of the as-prepared Ga/SiO2 catalyst. The XANES spectrum of the as-prepared Ga–HBEA catalyst mirrors that of the Ga/SiO2 catalyst except that all features are shifted to higher energy by ∼0.8 eV (see Fig. S3‡). This shift reflects the greater cationic character of Ga3+ centers in zeolites, which results from the more ionic character of the bonding between Ga and zeolite Si–O–Al sites vs. the more covalent character of Ga–O–Si bonds in the Ga/SiO2 catalyst and the Ga(OSiPh3)3 model compound.

Thin vertical lines denote XANES edge energies, defined as the position of the first inflection point in the edge: 10 374.4 eV for [Ga(OSiPh3)3]2, 10 374.4 eV for Ga–SiO2, and 10 375.2 eV for Ga–HBEA.
Systematic replacement of –OSiPh3 groups by –CH2SiMe3 groups yields dimeric [Ga(OSiPh3)2(CH2SiMe3)]2 (2) and [Ga(OSiPh3)(CH2SiMe3)2]2 (3), and monomeric Ga(CH2SiMe3)3 (4). Species (2) and (3) are four-coordinate around each Ga3+ center, while (4) is three-coordinate. To better separate the effects of coordination number from those of ligand substitution, two additional reference compounds were prepared: the phosphine oxide adduct Ga(CH2SiMe3)3(OP(n-Bu)3)50 (5), which has a four-coordinate GaC3O (3 Ga–C and 1 Ga–O bond) environment around Ga, and Ga(t-Bu)2(OAr) (Ar = (2,4,6-t-Bu)3C6H2)49 (6), which has a three-coordinate GaC2O geometry. Selected XANES spectra of these compounds are presented in Fig. 6; additional spectra are presented in Fig. S4 and S5.‡ Edge energies, as determined by the position of the first inflection point in the absorption edge, are marked in Fig. 6 and compiled in Table 1.

The results in Fig. 6 and Table 1 clearly illustrate that significant changes in XANES edge energy can arise entirely due to changes in the coordination environment around gallium, without a change in formal oxidation state. Both ligand electronic properties and overall coordination number are important. The effect of ligand electronic properties is revealed by comparing (1), (2), (3), and (5), or by comparing (6) and (4). In either sequence, replacement of Ga–O bonds by Ga–C bonds results in a systematic decrease in the XANES edge energy. The effect of coordination number is shown by comparing (5) and (4), or by comparing (3) and (6). A decrease in coordination number via loss of one Ga–O bond results in a 1.4–1.6 eV decrease in the absorption edge energy. Conversely, the increase in coordination number between (1) and Ga(acac)3via (formal) gain of two Ga–O bonds results in a 2.1 eV increase in the XANES edge energy. The importance of ligand effects on XANES edge energy is most dramatically illustrated by comparing (4) and Ga(acac)3, which have edge energies differing by more than 6 eV despite both containing gallium in the +3 oxidation state.
Table 1 also presents the edge energy of an authentic Ga+ ion, as determined from the spectrum of the mixed-valence compound Ga+[GaCl4]− (see the ESI‡ for details). While the edge energy of Ga+ may also depend upon its coordination environment, Table 1 nevertheless clearly shows that the two Ga3+-containing species (4) and (6) have XANES edge energies lower than that of at least one true Ga+ species. From the results of Fig. 6 and Table 1, it is evident that XANES edge energies of low-coordinate Ga3+ alkyls are in the same range as that expected for Ga+, and that edge shifts of 6 eV or more may occur without a change in formal oxidation state. These findings clearly demonstrate that the existence of Ga+cations is not required to explain edge shifts observed for working dehydrogenation catalysts.
In addition to well-defined, molecular model complexes we also grafted Ga(CH2SiMe3)3 directly onto two supports materials: silica calcined at 700 °C (SiO2700) and containing only isolated silanol groups (4-1), and freshly calcined zeolite H-BEA (4-2). In Fig. 7, the spectrum of as-prepared (4-1) is compared to the spectrum of the three-coordinate GaC2O reference material Ga(t-Bu)2(OAr) (6). The edge energies for (6) and (4-1) are 10 370.5 eV and 10 370.6 eV, respectively, and the close agreement between these spectra suggests that on silica containing only isolated silanol groups, grafting of (4) yields the expected three-coordinate Ga(CH2SiMe3)2(O–SiO2700), with a GaC2O geometry around Ga3+. Also shown in Fig. 7 is the spectrum of the 2.6 wt% Ga–SiO2 catalyst upon treatment in hydrogen at 650 °C (edge energy 10 370.4 eV). The similarity in edge energies among hydrogen-treated Ga–SiO2, silica-grafted dialkyl (4-1), and model species (6) are consistent with the hypothesis that hydrogen treatment of Ga–SiO2 at 650 °C gives rise to a three-coordinate Ga3+ dihydride Ga(H)2(O–SiO2) analogous to the three-coordinate Ga3+ dialkyls (4-1) and (6).
Fig. 7 Normalized XANES spectra of GaR3/SiO2700 (red), Ga(t-Bu)2(OAr) (blue), and 2.6 wt% Ga/SiO2 in hydrogen at 650 °C (gold). Also shown are the spectra of 2.6 wt% Ga-SiO2 in hydrogen at RT (gray dashed) and at 500 °C (gray dot-dashed), repeated from Fig. 3.
The spectrum of GaR3 grafted to zeolite H-BEA is compared to that of [Ga(CH2SiMe3)2(OSiPh3)]2 in Fig. S7.‡ As expected, the spectra are nearly identical, with both exhibiting an edge energy of 10 371.9 eV. For comparison, Hensen et al.30 report a XANES edge energy of 10 373.0 eV for the product of trimethylgallium vapor deposition onto H-ZSM5, the likely product of which is GaMe2(OZ)2 (Z = zeolite framework site). Unlike (4-1), however, the spectrum of (4-2) does not match that of Ga–H-BEA treated at 500 °C in H2. A plausible interpretation of the structures giving rise to the spectra of Ga–H-BEA observed during H2 treatment is presented below.
Discussion
The spectra of the molecular model compounds presented in Fig. 6 clearly demonstrate that the edge energy and spectral features in Ga K edge XANES are sensitive both to overall coordination number and to the relative number of Ga–C vs. Ga–O bonds. In order to understand these effects, some discussion of the factors governing XANES edge energies is warranted.
In a K edge X-ray absorption experiment, X-ray absorption near the photoionization threshold is dominated by (dipole-allowed) photoexcitation of 1s electrons into bound or quasi-bound states derived from unfilled molecular orbitals involving the target atom. For gallium, the lowest unoccupied states are derived from Ga 4p atomic orbitals; thus, in the near-edge region, the Ga K edge spectrum is dominated by 1s → 4p photoexcitation, and the experimentally observed edge energy is set by the difference in energy between the 1s and 4p orbitals.
The Ga 1s orbital is highly localized on the atomic core, so its energy is not directly impacted by the bonding configuration around the Ga atom. However, a change in the charge density around Ga will alter the electrostatic potential experienced by its electrons. When a change in bonding configuration reduces the charge density around gallium (i.e. gallium becomes more cationic), the binding energies of both the Ga 1s and Ga 4p states increase. Because the electrostatic potential is steeper nearer to the nucleus, changes to the potential have larger effects on the energy levels of core electrons than on those of valence electrons. Therefore, the increase in binding energy is greater for the core Ga 1s states than for the valence 4p states, resulting in a net increase in the 1s → 4p excitation energy. This is the primary reason that the XANES absorption edge is sensitive to oxidation state (the same effect is also responsible for sensitivity to oxidation state in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy).
In addition to being bound by the electrostatic potential of the gallium atom, the valence Ga 4p orbitals are also directly involved in bonding interactions with the atomic orbitals of neighboring atoms. As a result, the energy levels of the Ga 4p orbitals are sensitive not only to oxidation state, but also to the details of the molecular connectivity around the Ga center. When Ga forms bonds with more electronegative elements the unoccupied antibonding orbitals have a large amount of Ga 4p character. It is these antibonding orbitals that comprise the lowest energy unoccupied states into which Ga 1s electrons are excited in the XANES measurement. The greater the electronegativity of the ligand, the greater the extent to which (anti-)bonding interactions raise the Ga 4p orbital energy; this in turn increases the 1s → 4p transition energy and the XANES absorption edge.
In order to understand the edge shifts shown in Fig. 6, consider first the structure of reference compound (4). As shown in Fig. 8, the geometry around gallium in (4) is trigonal planar, and the Ga 4pz orbital is completely nonbonding. At the same time, while gallium in (4) is formally in the +3 oxidation state, the strongly σ-donating trimethylsilylmethyl groups provide for much greater electron density around Ga than the formal oxidation state implies. Indeed, the charge density on (4) is evidently greater than that of Ga+ in [Ga+][GaCl4−], and since the 4p orbitals in the latter also have almost completely nonbonding character (nearest Ga+–Cl contact at 3.17 Å, cf. 2.18 Å for Ga3+–Cl bonds in GaCl4−), the edge energy for Ga3+ in (4) is actually lower that of Ga+ in Ga2Cl4.
Fig. 8 Lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of reference compounds (4), (6), and (5). In (4), the LUMO is a non-bonding Ga 4pz orbital. In (6), this orbital acquires Ga–O π* character which, combined with the greater electronegativity of O vs. C, increases the XANES edge energy by ∼1 eV relative to (4). In (5), the Ga 4pz orbital acquires Ga–O σ* character, which raises the XANES edge energy by ∼2 eV relative to (4).
Comparing (4) to (6), replacement of strong σ-donor sp3-CH2Si(CH3)3 ligands with similarly strong σ-donor sp3-C(CH3)3 ligands has minimal effects on the overall charge density and no effect on the vacant Ga 4pz orbital. However, replacing a less electronegative carbon ligand with a more electronegative oxygen does reduce the charge density around Ga. At the same time, while sp3-C does not participate in π-bonding, the phenoxide O is a good π-donor, leading to mixing between the O 2pz and Ga 4pz orbitals. Such mixing lowers the energy of the O lone pair, which takes on Ga–O π-bonding character, and increases the energy of the otherwise vacant Ga 4pz, which takes on Ga–O π* character. As the charge density at Ga decreases and the energy of the Ga 4pz orbital increases, the XANES edge energy increases from 10 370.0 eV to 10 370.5 eV.
Next, compare the structure of (4) to that of (5), in which a datively bound phosphine oxide donates electron density into the Ga 4pz orbital. The phosphine oxide is a neutral donor ligand, so despite the high electronegativity of oxygen, Ga–O coordination does not significantly alter the charge density around Ga in (5) relative to (4). However, as compared to (6), where an O 2p orbital acts as a π donor, in (5) an O 2p orbital acts primarily as a σ-donor. As a result, the Ga 4pz orbital which had nonbonding character in (4) and π* character in (6) has σ* character in (5). This increases the energy of the 1s → 4p transition by ∼2 eV vs. (4), resulting in a XANES edge energy for (5) of 10 371.6 eV.
The sequence of ligand substitutions from (5) to (3) to (2) to (1) maintains a pseudo-tetrahedral coordination for Ga(iii). However, sequential replacement of less electronegative, strongly σ-donating, and non-π-donating sp3-C with more electronegative, less strongly σ-donating but more strongly π-donating O serves both to deplete charge density around the Ga(iii) center, lowering the energy of the Ga 1s orbital, and to increase the π* character of the Ga 4p orbitals, increasing their energy. These effects combine to further increase the energy of the 1s → 4p transition, such that the XANES edge energy increases from 10 371.6 eV in (5) to 10 374.4 eV in (1). Altogether, a difference in edge energy of 4.4 eV is observed between model compounds (1) and (4), despite both species containing gallium in the formal +3 oxidation state.
Ligand effects on XANES edge energies observed in Fig. 6 are not unique to substitution of sp3-C by O. As shown in Fig. S5,‡ substitution of sp3-C by Cl produces similar effects. This result is consistent with the similar functions of O and Cl as electronegative, π-donor ligands. At the same time, chlorine is less electronegative and less pi basic than oxygen; as a result, the 4.4 eV difference in edge energies between (4) and (1) decreases to a 3.9 eV difference in edge energies between (4) and [GaCl3]2.
Likewise, the similar electronegativities of hydrogen and carbon and the similar bonding properties of H and sp3-C (strongly σ-donating, non-π-donating) assure that alkyl and hydride ligands also have similar effects on XANES edge energies. An example of this similarity is provided in Fig. S6.‡ Formal replacement of one Ga–Cl bond by a Ga–sp3-C bond, as occurs between [GaCl3]2 and [Ga(CH2SiMe3)Cl2]2, results in a 1.4 eV decrease in XANES edge energy. Similarly, formal replacement of one Ga–Cl bond by a Ga–H bond, as occurs between KGaCl4 and KGaHCl3, results in a nearly equivalent 1.5 eV decrease in XANES edge energy. This similarity supports the interpretation of the results in Fig. 7 presented above.
Sensitivity of the XANES absorption edge to ligand field effects is not unique to gallium. In borate glasses, a change in boron coordination number from 3 to 4 gives rise to a 4 eV shift in XANES edge energy.73 In pentavalent phosphorus, an ∼4.5 eV shift is observed between OP(Et)3 and OP(OPh)3,74 and a similar ∼4 eV shift is observed in the energy of the first XANES feature between tetramethylsilane and tetraethyl orthosilicate.75 Ligand effects on XANES energies are also known for iron,76 copper,77 and chromium.78 In our own work, we have recently observed these effects in zinc79 and cobalt. Yet despite the precedent in the literature, such effects have not been used to interpret changes in the Ga XANES in dehydrogenation catalysts. As a result, previous researchers have concluded with varying degrees of certainty that gallium undergoes reduction to Ga+ during alkane dehydrogenation. This conclusion has led to proposed alkane dehydrogenation mechanisms involving a Ga+/Ga3+ redox cycle, despite the lack of precedent for such a redox cycle in any other known chemistry. In fact, as shown in Fig. 7, XANES data equally well support the conclusion that for Ga–SiO2 catalysts, treatment in hydrogen at high temperatures results in formation of three-coordinate Ga3+ hydrides. Observation of this species under operando conditions is supportive of a non-redox, heterolytic cleavage mechanism for alkane dehydrogenation, consistent with theoretical studies, and with the mechanism operative on related zinc, cobalt, and chromium catalysts.25–28
From the results presented in Fig. 6, it becomes possible to account for the results in Fig. 1 and 4 without invoking the presence of Ga+. A hypothesis involving only Ga3+ species is proposed in Fig. 9. The as-prepared catalyst contains four-coordinate Ga3+, a representative structure for which is shown as A in Fig. 9. This structure persists at ambient temperature in a hydrogen atmosphere, and at temperatures up to at least 650 °C in oxidizing atmospheres (not shown). As Ga–SiO2 is heated above 500 °C in hydrogen, heterolytic cleavage of H2 across at Ga–O bond leads to replacement of a Ga–O bond by a Ga–H bond, forming B. This is the likely first step in hydrogenation of propylene over Ga–SiO2 catalysts, which occurs at temperatures well below those where reduction to Ga+ is feasible. Consistent with the results in Fig. 6, replacement of one O ligand with a less electronegative, non-π-donating H− ligand leads to a decrease in the XANES edge energy, giving rise to the first peak observed in the ΔXANES in Fig. 3b. Further exposure to hydrogen at 650 °C results in replacement of a second Ga–O bond by a Ga–H bond; this substitution gives rise to a further decrease in the XANES edge energy. Changes in the XANES edge energy between RT and 500 °C in Fig. 3 (repeated as dashed and dot-dashed spectra, respectively, in Fig. 7) represent evolution of the catalyst from 100% species A to a distribution of species A, B, and C.
Fig. 9 Scheme for sequential replacement of Ga–O bonds by Ga–H bonds during thermal treatment in hydrogen of Ga–SiO2 (top) and Ga–HBEA (middle), and the molecular model compounds analogous to each species (bottom).
Further heating to 650 °C promotes further formation of C at the expense of A and B. In addition, the reduced Lewis acidity of C relative to A weakens the dative Ga–O(H)Si bond, such that at 650 °C, this bond can break to produce a three-coordinate dihydride species D. The GaH2O environment in species D provides a similar ligand field to the GaC2O environments in models (6) and (4-1), resulting in an edge energy for D at 10 370.4 eV close to the values of 10 370.5–10 370.6 eV observed for (6) and (4-1). Judging by the relative intensities of the maxima at 10 371.5 eV and 10 376.8 eV in the spectrum of Ga–SiO2 at 650 °C, it is likely that this spectrum includes contributions from both species C and D, while additional contributions from A and B cannot be ruled out. Unfortunately, deconvolution of these contributions is precluded by the same challenge faced by Faro et al.,31 in that at no reference spectra of the pure species B, C, or D are available for comparison. The spectra of model structures (6) and especially (4-1) can, however, serve as proxies for the spectrum of D. Although quantitative differences between the spectra of (6), (4-1), and H2-treated Ga/SiO2 (particularly in the continuum region) are large enough that linear combination analysis or principle component analysis treatments were not found to be insightful, simple comparison of the absorption intensity at the first maximum of each spectrum suggests that species D accounts for ∼65% of all gallium in Ga–SiO2 in hydrogen at 650 °C (in Fig. 7, strong absorption near 10 376.5 eV for Ga–SiO2 in hydrogen at 650 °C not observed in the spectra of 6 and 4-1 is attributable to the remaining ∼35% of species A–C).
No molecular reference compound examined in the present study provides as close a match for the XANES spectrum of Ga–H-BEA in hydrogen at 500 °C as the spectra of (6) and (4-1) provide for Ga–SiO2 in hydrogen at 650 °C. However, comparison of Fig. 1b and 3b shows that the ΔXANES spectra of Ga–SiO2 and Ga–H-BEA catalysts exhibit the same features upon treatment in hydrogen, with both the low- and high-temperature spectral features in Ga–H-BEA systematically shifted by +0.8 eV relative to those of Ga–SiO2 (see also Fig. S3‡). The same +0.8 eV shift is visible already in a comparison of the spectra of Ga–SiO2 and Ga–H-BEA prior to hydrogen treatment. The shift is attributable to the lower charge density on Ga in the zeolite catalyst, which contains Ga3+ with greater cationic character as a result of relatively ionic bonding to Si–O–Al framework anion sites, as compared to more covalent bonding to surface silanols in Ga–SiO2. Once this shift is accounted for, spectral changes in the Ga-zeolite catalyst mirror those observed in the Ga–SiO2 catalyst, and it is, therefore, reasonable to hypothesize that the same chemical processes take place in both systems.
A possible sequence consistent with the results shown in Fig. 1 is provided on the second line of Fig. 9. After impregnation and calcination, gallium in zeolite beta exists primarily as (κ2-AlO2)Ga(OH)2 sites (A′). Upon exposure to hydrogen at elevated temperature, these sites undergo sequential hydrogenation to form (κ2-AlO2)Ga(H)(OH) (B′) and (κ2-AlO2)Ga(H)2 (C′). Each replacement of –OH with –H provides an ∼1 eV decrease in XANES edge energy. In addition, there exists an equilibrium reaction (κ2-AlO2)Ga(H)2 ⇔ (κ1-AlO2)Ga(H)2 between species C′ and D′; at 500 °C, this equilibrium lies completely to the right. Loss of coordination yields an empty Ga 4pz orbital, which shifts the XANES edge energy lower by another ∼2 eV and gives rise to the characteristic white line absorption peak at 10 370.0 eV. Species B′ and C′ have also been postulated by Kazansky et al.80 as responsible for Ga–H infrared stretching frequencies observed at 2059 and 2041 cm−1, respectively. Calculations by Gonzales et al.36 suggest that the A′ → B′ and B′ → C′ reactions have similar barriers; kinetics thus dictate that the concentration of species B′ should remain relatively low. We attribute the first, small peak in the ΔXANES to the presence of a small concentration of B′ early in the hydrogen treatment.
Species D′ does not appear to have been considered explicitly in any previous work, and the energetics of the process C′ ⇔ D′ are therefore not known. Preliminary calculations suggest that species D′ is not a minimum energy structure at the MP2 level of theory when an Al(OSiH3)4 T5 cluster model representation of beta zeolite is used, and that the full periodic unit cell must be included in order to obtain D′ as a ground state structure (Fig. 10) (this finding highlights the importance of dispersive forces in stabilizing reactive intermediates in zeolites, and the necessity of including these forces in calculations in order to obtain accurate results). When such calculations are performed, it is found that species D′ is ∼1 eV higher in energy than species C′. Intriguingly, this difference is significantly lower, less than 0.5 eV, when H2 or methane is present in the zeolite pore, as these molecules weakly interact with and stabilize the three-coordinate gallium center in D′. These calculations support the hypothesis that species D′ is energetically accessible at 500 °C, and that its formation accounts for the second, larger peak in the ΔXANES and the emergence of the prominent peak at 10 370.0 eV in the XANES interpreted by previous authors29–31 as evidence for Ga+.
Fig. 10 Depiction of species C′ and D′ in the beta zeolite framework. Several coordination sites inside the BEA framework were considered; coordination to crystallographic site T7 is shown.
While the results in Fig. 3a suggest that the equilibrium between species C′ and D′ is shifted strongly toward D′ at high temperatures, at lower temperatures species C′ is expected to predominate. In fact, evidence for this equilibrium has been observed: several authors7,81 have reported that the decrease in XANES edge energy observed upon heating in H2 is reversed upon cooling to ambient temperature, even when an atmosphere of H2 is maintained. This observation has previously been interpreted as evidence for a temperature-dependent equilibrium between Ga(iii)H2+ and Ga(i)+ + H2, with equilibrium shifted to the left at lower temperature. Careful inspection of these reports reveals that while edge energy does increase upon cooling under an atmosphere of H2, it does not return to the value measured for the initial, fully oxidized catalyst, but remains lower than this by 1–2 eV – consistent with the expected lower edge energy of C′ relative to A′. A similar equilibrium may also have been observed by Hensen et al.30 for the corresponding dimethyl Ga3+ species: the decrease in XANES edge energy from 10 373.0 eV to 10 371.5 eV upon heating above 360 °C in hydrogen attributed in that work to a reduction in gallium oxidation state from +3 to +1 may instead provide evidence for a reduction in gallium coordination number from four to three. By combining the understanding of ligand and coordination effects on XANES edge energy provided in the present work with operando XANES analysis and synthetic strategies employed here and elsewhere,30,72 it is now possible to develop a new, more complete understanding of the relationships between reaction conditions, gallium speciation, and catalytic performance in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.
Conclusions
A series of Ga3+ reference compounds have been prepared, and their XANES spectra compared to those of Ga–SiO2 and Ga–H-BEA catalysts acquired under reducing conditions. The resulting spectra clearly demonstrate that shifts in XANES edge energy cannot automatically be assumed to arise from changes in oxidation state. Changes in ligand identity and coordination number were shown to shift the XANES edge energy of Ga3+ compounds from as low as 10 370.0 eV in Ga(CH2SiMe3)3 to as high as 10 376.5 eV in Ga(acac)3. This range overlaps the edge energy range of known Ga+ compounds, and consequently, XANES edge energy cannot be used to distinguish Ga3+ alkyls or hydrides from Ga+. This finding suggests that previous XANES investigation of Ga-zeolite catalysts do not conclusively demonstrate the existence of Ga+ in Ga-zeolite catalysts. Such results may instead have resulted from formation of Ga3+ alkyl or hydride intermediates.
Comparison of the XANES spectra of Ga–SiO2 and Ga–H-BEA catalysts exposed to hydrogen at high temperature with XANES spectra of molecular reference compounds suggest that these catalysts may contain three-coordinate Ga3+ dihydride species rather than Ga+. Grafting of molecular models to silica and zeolite supports confirms the similarity between spectra of three-coordinate gallium alkyls and in situ spectra of supported gallium catalysts under reducing conditions. These findings agree with observation in the literature of Ga–H bonds under catalytic conditions, suggesting that Ga3+ hydrides may be mechanistically relevant. Finally, catalytic activity of Ga–SiO2 catalysts for olefin hydrogenation – the microscopic reverse of alkane dehydrogenation – can be observed at temperatures as low as 110 °C, and it is chemically unlikely that Ga3+ can be reduced under such mild conditions. Considering these results, we believe it is likely that Ga3+ does not undergo reduction to Ga+ during alkane dehydrogenation, and that C–H bond activation on Ga3+ catalysts instead proceeds via non-redox, heterolytic cleavage or sigma-bond metathesis mechanisms involving Ga3+ alkyl and hydride intermediates.
In closing, we stress that the effects of ligand identity and coordination environment on XANES edge energy are not restricted to gallium. A wider appreciation of the factors that govern XANES edge energy will be of great benefit to the heterogeneous catalysis community, and may allow new insights to be drawn even from existing experimental results.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
