The given document discusses the X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) characterization of gallium species in alkane dehydrogenation catalysts. It does not specifically mention propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The document focuses on using molecular model complexes to interpret XANES spectra of gallium catalysts rather than discussing improvements to catalytic performance. Therefore, this document does not seem directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation to propylene.
