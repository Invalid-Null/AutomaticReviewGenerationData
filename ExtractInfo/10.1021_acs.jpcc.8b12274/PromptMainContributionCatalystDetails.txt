Theoretical Investigation of On-Purpose Propane Dehydrogenation over the Two-Dimensional Ru–Pc Framework
Abstract
The on-purpose dehydrogenation of light alkanes has received considerable interest for producing olefins from abundant and cheap feedstock. The prevalent catalysts have been limited to Pt–Sn/Al2O3 and Cr2O3/Al2O3. In this work, we demonstrate by density functional theory that two-dimensional Ru–phthalocyanine (2D Ru–Pc) is a potential single-atom catalyst for selective alkene production via direct C–H bond activations. By analyzing the reaction pathways and the electronic structures of the transition states, we show that the catalytic origin of 2D Ru–Pc in C–H bond activations is the highly exposed d orbitals of the single Ru atom. The alkene selectivity can be attributed to the weak Ru−π binding interaction between the produced alkene and the 2D Ru–Pc catalyst. The distinct catalytic selectivity of such a 2D Ru–Pc catalyst may inspire further investigations of selective dehydrogenation of light alkanes on single-metal catalysts.

In recent decades, the global trade markets have been registering a rapid growth in demand of light olefins, which are the key feedstock in chemical industries. (1−4) Producing these olefins from abundant and cheap alkanes has been considered as a profitable strategy to close the growing “olefin gap” and has attracted extensive research interests. (5) In this field, the on-purpose synthesis of propylene, also known as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), has become a focus of research due to the fast-growing demand of propylene. (6,7) Mechanistically, the challenges of PDH are two-fold: (i) propane is a chemically unreactive molecule; highly active catalysts are required to break the C–H bond at reasonable temperatures, (ii) on the other hand, the catalysts should not strongly bind to the propylene molecules, so that the desired products can leave the catalysts before being over-dehydrogenated. (8) The first challenge can usually be tackled by using precious metal catalysts, for example, Pt. The second challenge regarding to the propylene selectivity, however, remains a central issue in PDH due to the following reasons: Thermodynamically, the over-dehydrogenation of propylene is feasible, because the weakest C–H bond in propane (4.31 eV) is stronger than that in propylene (3.34 eV). (9) Kinetically, the propylene desorption from metal catalysts is slow due to the strong di-σ interaction between the olefin and metal surfaces, which significantly promotes the over-hydrogenation. (10) For instance, Somorjai et al. have reported that PDHs were observed at the room temperature on the Pt(111) surface, producing both propylene and coke. (11,12) In recent years, alloying Pt with a second metal, for example, Sn and Cu have been widely studied to increase the propylene selectivity by reducing the propylene adsorption on catalysts. (10) Examples are, Gong et al. reported that propylene adsorption on Pt could be inhibited by the Cu–Pt interaction. As a result, the selectivity of propylene was significantly increased to 90.8% when Pt catalysts were alloyed with 0.5 wt % Cu. (13) Yang et al. investigated the commercial Pt–Sn catalysts in PDH with first-principles calculations and reported that the catalytic selectivity on Pt–Sn alloys could be attributed to the weakened propylene adsorption on Pt2Sn/Pt(111), in comparison with that on Pt(111). (14) Despite the successful examples of alloy catalysts, industrial PDH still suffers from the over-hydrogenation of propylene and fast deactivation of Pt–Sn. Mainly because that the selective generation of desired active sites in alloy surfaces is practically very difficult. (15) Inspired by previous studies, we propose that single-transition-metal (TM) atoms may serve as efficient catalysts in PDH because the highly localized d orbitals may not only lower the activation barriers for C–H bond scissions but also inhibit the di-σ binding mode of propylene on the catalysts and thus decrease the adsorption energy. (16,17) Despite that the single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been reported in a wide range of reactions, (18−22) PDH driven by SAC has not yet been addressed. Taking into account that SACs produced on supporting materials, for example, metal oxides, are often very active and easily agglomerated at the operating temperatures of PDH, the calculations in this study have been focused on the two-dimensional TM phthalocyanine (2D TM-Pc) frameworks (M = Fe, Mn, Ni, Cu). (23−26) 2D TM-Pc contains one TM atom per unit cell and provides new candidates for the heterogeneous catalysis due to their stable structures and the uniformly distributed single-atom active sites. (27,28) For instance, Sun et al. and Chen et al. have reported 2D Cr–Pc and 2D Fe–Pc as active SACs toward CO oxidation and the oxygen reduction reaction. (29,30) Recently, Du et al. have successfully synthesized 2D Ni–Pc and explored its outstanding activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction with an overpotential less than 0.25 V. (31) Herein, the catalytic activity and propylene selectivity of 2D TM-Pc frameworks (TM = Ag, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ru) in PDH have been screened with first-principles calculations. 2D Ru–Pc shows the lowest reaction of propylene formation and the weakest binding energy of propylene on the Ru atom, indicating a promising SAC for PDH reactions. Subsequent climbing image-nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) calculations reveal that 2D Ru–Pc exhibits outstanding catalytic activity and selectivity of propylene production via successive dehydrogenations of propane. By analyzing the electronic structures of the transition states in the elementary reactions, we show that the propylene selectivity can be ascribed to (i) the site-selective dehydrogenation at the C2 carbon atom in the formed 1-proxyl group due to the formation of chemically stable Ru−π species, and (ii) the weak propylene adsorption (−0.55 eV) on 2D Ru–Pc comparing to the high activation barriers (1.28 eV) for over-dehydrogenations. Moreover, we show that 2D Ru–Pc is a general SAC catalyst for producing other olefins via selective dehydrogenation of alkanes.
Computational Details and Methods

The spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP), where the projector augmented wave potentials were employed to describe the electron–ion interactions. (32,33) The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof functional of generalized gradient approximation pseudopotentials was used to describe the exchange–correlation interactions. (34) The van der Waals interactions were described with the vdW-D3 method. (35) The cut-off energy of plane wave basis was set as 400 eV. The structures were optimized until the atomic force was less than 0.01 eV per Å. A vacuum layer of 20 Å was adopted to avoid the periodic image interactions. The searches of transition states in PDH were first calculated with the CI-NEB method, in which seven structural images were inserted between the initial and final states. (36−38) The central images of CI-NEB were then used as the input structures of the subsequent dimer calculations. (39,40) The Brillouin zone of reciprocal space was modeled based on the Γ centered Monkhorst–Pack scheme, where a 4 × 4 × 1 grid was adopted in geometry optimizations, searches of the transition states, and calculations of electronic properties. (41) All of the 2D TM-Pc frameworks were modeled with a periodic monolayer of 2 × 2 supercells composed of four primitive cells, each of which is consisted of 20 C atoms, 8 N atoms, 4 H atoms, and 1 TM atom. The thermal stability of the 2D TM-Pc surfaces was studied by ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations at 500 and 1000 K for 2000 fs. In order to assess the effects of the reaction temperature and the pressure, the PDH mechanism was investigated in two scenarios. (42) In the first scenario, the potential energies of the PDH reactions were calculated to investigate the reaction kinetics. (43) In the second scenario, the Gibbs free energies of reactive systems at the reaction temperature were investigated, which were defined according to eq 1

Results and Discussion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The catalytic performance of PDH can be evaluated by propane activations and propylene selectivity. Based on the Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi relationship, the catalytic activity for breaking the C–H bond of propane can be predicted by the potential energies for reactions (ΔE) between the final states and the initial states of the C–H bond activations. (45,46) Experimentally, it has been reported that the dehydrogenations of the linear alkane is initiated from C–H bond activations at the terminal methyl groups, and the reaction energies of this elementary step can be employed as the theoretical descriptor for estimating the catalytic activity of 2D TM-Pc. (47) The reaction energy is calculated according to eq 5

in which EC3H8+TM-Pc is the potential energy of physisorbed propane on 2D TM-Pc monolayers, and EC3H7+H+TM-Pc is the potential energy of the co-adsorption of 1-proxyl radicals and H atoms on 2D TM-Pc. (10,48) As has been reported previously, the propylene adsorption may serve as a vital criterion for estimating the propylene selectivity of PDH, that is, the catalytic selectivity increases as the propylene adsorption energy decreases. (14) In this work, the adsorption energy of propylene on 2D TM-Pc is calculated according to eq 6
(6)
where EC3H6+TM-Pc, ETM-Pc, and EC3H6 are the potential energy of propylene adsorbed on 2D TM-Pc, the clean 2D TM-Pc framework, and an isolated propylene molecule, respectively. The reaction energies of the first C–H bond activations with respect to the adsorption energies of propylene on 2D TM-Pc frameworks are shown in Figure 1. Pt2Sn which has been reported as the active sites for PDH in commercial Pt–Sn catalysts is selected as a reference (reaction energy = 1.22 eV and propene adsorption energy = −0.42 eV) in Figure 1. (14) The detailed adsorption configurations of 1-proxyl radicals and H atoms on 2D TM-Pc and corresponding potential energies are summarized in Figure S1 and Table S1,respectively. Calculations show that 1-proxyl radicals are weakly bonded to 2D Cr–Pc, 2D Ni–Pc, and 2D Ag–Pc, where large metal–carbon distances are observed (3.97, 3.65, and 3.93 Å, respectively). Such large distances indicate that 2D Cr–Pc, 2D Ni–Pc, and 2D Ag–Pc do not exhibit considerable interactions with the C radicals. As a result, the potential energies of the C–H bond activations are relative high. On the other hand, however, the bonding characteristics of Cu and Pt atoms with the C radical lead to strong structural distortions, which results in high potential energies of C–H bond activations. By contrast, 2D Ru–Pc and 2D Rh–Pc frameworks show not only low reaction energies, agreeing well with the activities of the corresponding surface catalysts, (49,50) but also weak propylene adsorption energies. In particular, the 2D Ru–Pc framework exhibits the lowest potential energy of C–H bond activations (1.01 eV) and a comparable propylene adsorption energy (−0.55 eV) with respect to the Pt2Sn catalyst (−0.42 eV). (14) Therefore, subsequent calculations have been focused on 2D Ru–Pc.

The dashed horizontal line (potential energy = 1.22 eV) and the dashed vertical line (propylene adsorption energy = −0.42 eV) are selected to indicate the corresponding values of the Pt2Sn catalyst in ref (14).
The intrinsic electronic structure and the thermal stability of the 2D Ru–Pc framework are investigated before PDH mechanics. As seen in Figure 2a, the 2D Ru–Pc framework possesses a planar structure. The lattice constant of the primitive cell (labeled in dashed red square) is 10.72 Å. Figure 2b shows the spin-polarized density of states (DOS) projected onto d electrons of Ru in 2D Ru–Pc, a Ru atom in the Ru(0001) surface, and an isolated Ru atom in the vacuum. As expected, the localization of d states in 2D Ru–Pc (red line) is in between the discrete atomic orbitals in an isolated Ru atom (blue) and the d bands in metallic Ru surfaces (black). The featured peaks in the energy window from −2.0 to 2.0 eV indicate that 2D Ru–Pc may exhibit a higher catalytic activity than the Ru surfaces. As the typical PDH requires temperatures well above 500 K, AIMD calculations are carried out to evaluate the thermal stability of 2D Ru–Pc. As shown in Figure S2, the maximum root-mean-square deviation is only about 0.40 Å at 1000 K, indicating that 2D Ru–Pc is a very stable structure at high temperatures. (10,51) In addition, the oxidization of Ru–Pc can be excluded by a large increase of Gibbs free energy (ΔG) during the formation of RuO2, which requires an oxygen partial pressure significantly higher than the ambient pressure (Figure S3). Based on the calculations described above, successive dehydrogenation processes are investigated to explore the catalytic activity and selectivity of 2D Ru–Pc as potential PDH catalysts.

Mechanistically, propylene production via PDH consists of two successive and selective dehydrogenation steps, and of great importance, the subsequent fast propylene desorption to avoid over-dehydrogenations. (8)Figure 3 shows possible elementary steps of C–H bond and C–C bond activations in the process of PDH. The detailed energy profiles of these reactions are listed in Table 1.

Before PDH, propane is physisorbed on the 2D Ru–Pc framework, with an adsorption energy of −0.53 eV and a C–Ru distance of 3.35 Å. As shown in step I of Figure 3, the reaction may proceed via three possible reaction paths: dehydrogenation on a terminal methyl group (reaction 1), dehydrogenation on the methylene group (reaction 2), and demethylation (reaction 3). All these reactions result in carbon radicals that are chemically bonded to the Ru atom. The numerical values of reaction energies and C–Ru distances are shown in Figure S4. As listed in Table 1, reaction 1 exhibits the lowest potential energy (1.01 eV) among the reactions 1, 2, and 3 in step I. In addition, the numerical value of the energy barrier for reaction 1 (Ea-1 = 1.08 eV) is lower than the potential energies of reactions 2 (4.13 eV) and 3 (1.59 eV). Therefore, the corresponding energy barriers for reactions 2 and 3 are presumably higher than that of reaction 1. This indicates that PDH will proceed with reaction 1 on 2D Ru–Pc, agreeing well with the previous study. (52) Furthermore, the adsorption energy of the H atom on 2D Ru–Pc (−0.25 eV) indicates that the dissociated H atoms would easily desorb from the Ru active site. Starting from the final state of reaction 1, possible subsequent reaction paths include dehydrogenations and C–C bond activation of methylene groups (reactions 4–6 in Figure 3). DFT calculations show that the C–C bond cleavage of 1-proxyl radicals on 2D Ru–Pc requires a high activation barrier of 3.30 eV, and thus is not likely to occur (Figure S5). Moreover, propylene is only weakly adsorbed on 2D Ru–Pc (−0.55 eV). Thus, the propylene selectivity can be determined by the activation barriers of the dehydrogenations of the 1-proxyl radical (reactions 4 and 5), which results in the over-dehydrogenation and the desired propylene, respectively. As shown in Figure 4, the 1-propylene radical (CHCH2CH3) is generated at the final state of reaction 4, yielding a C–Ru distance of 1.85 Å and an activation barrier of 1.65 eV (Table 1), while the reaction 5 is energetically much more favorable due to the smaller energy barrier (1.02 eV). The selectivity may be interpreted by stable “propylene π” configuration at the transition state of reaction 5 (TS-5), in which the first two C atoms are coordinated to the Ru active site. (53) In addition, our results suggest that the 2D Ru–Pc framework exhibits satisfactory selectivity with the catalysts reported previously (Table S2). (5,14,54,55) However, the deep dehydrogenations (reactions 7–11) need to be inhibited until the propylene molecules desorb from the catalysts. (10) The energy profiles and optimized geometries from propylene to propyne via reactions 7–11 are, therefore, considered (Figure S6). As listed in Table 1, the dehydrogenation barriers of propylene at both the terminal methylene group and the penultimate homomethyl (−CH) group (reactions 7 and 8) are higher than the reaction barrier in the synthesis of propylene (Ea-7 = 1.28 eV > Ea-8 = 1.17 eV > Ea-1 = 1.08 eV). Despite that the reactions 7 and 8 might take place after the synthesis of the propylene due to their relative low activation barriers (0.20 eV higher than that of reaction 1), the inversed reactions of reactions 7 and 8 to regenerate propylene possess much lower activation barriers in comparison with those of losing more hydrogen atoms to produce over-dehydrogenated products (reactions 9–11, Figure S6). Therefore, the inversed reactions of reactions 7 and 8 are kinetically more favorable, so that over-dehydrogenations can be effectively prohibited.

The solid and dashed lines represent potential energies and Gibbs free energies at 623.15 K and 1.01 × 105 Pa, respectively. The inset figures are the corresponding configurations. Hydrogen atoms in the adsorbed molecules are represented with white circles. Carbon atoms are presented with brown circles. The Ru atom and hydrogen atoms adsorbed on the Ru active site are drawn as dark cyan and red circles, respectively.
In addition, the effect of entropy is investigated by Gibbs free energy. Under conditions of T = 623.15 K and ambient pressure, (56) the Gibbs free energy profile (dashed lines in Figure 4) shows that the increase of the temperature would not only promote the catalytic activity but also maintain the propylene selectivity of 2D Ru–Pc. As listed in Table 1, the Gibbs free energy of the transition state for reaction 1 is 0.79 eV, indicating that the catalytic activity is promoted with the increase of the temperature. Moreover, the order of Ga-5 > Ga-1 > Ga-4 in step I and step II remains unchanged at T = 623.15 K, indicating that the increase of temperature will not significantly affect the propylene selectivity. Furthermore, the relationship between barriers of deep dehydrogenations and the synthesis of propylene remains as Ga-7 > Ga-8 > Ga-1 (Figure S6). Therefore, the deep dehydrogenations can be effectively prohibited on 2D Ru–Pc.
In addition to the energy profiles, the propylene selectivity can be further clarified by the bonding analysis of the transition states of reactions 4 and 5, as the activation barriers and stability of transition states are closely dependent on adsorbate–surface interactions. (57−59)Figure 5 shows the spin-polarized DOS of the C and H atoms, and the DOS of Ru active sites projected onto the d orbital of the transition state in reaction 4 (TS-4) and reaction 5 (TS-5), respectively. As seen in Figure 5a, the DOS of C1 strongly overlaps with the Ru active sites at TS-4. By performing the band-decomposed charge density analysis, the bonding orbitals of the C1–Ru bond are observed at an energy window of [−7.00, −4.00] eV, while the antibonding orbitals are located at [1.00, 3.00] eV, referring to the formation of the C1–Ru σ bond. However, an obvious mismatch between the DOS of C2 and the Ru active sites is observed from −7.00 eV to the Fermi level, suggesting that no chemical bonds are formed. Such bonding characteristics can be confirmed by the charge difference density analysis. As illustrated in Figure 5a(3), the electrons accumulate between the C1 atom and the Ru active site, while the charge density near the C2 atom remains unchanged, indicating that only C1 is chemically interacted with the Ru atom. Despite that the same reaction on Ru(0001) results in similar transition configuration, a more detailed analysis shows that TS-4 on 2D Ru–Pc suffers a structural strain as its C1–Ru–C2 angle (139.14°) is significantly different from the relaxed configuration of that (119.28°) on the Ru(0001) surface (Figure S7). (60) Consequently, the TS-4 complex on 2D Ru–Pc is much less stable than on Ru(0001). By contrast, at TS-5 on 2D Ru–Pc, the 4d orbital of the Ru active site overlap with both C1 and C2 atoms, indicating the formation of C1–Ru and C2–Ru bonds. The bonding orbitals of C1–Ru and C2–Ru bonds can be recognized at [−6.00, −4.00] and [−3.50, −2.00] eV, respectively. The antibonding orbitals are in an energy window of [3.00, 5.00] eV. As displayed in Figure 5b(4), the electrons are accumulated in between C1, C2, and Ru atoms, confirming the bonding characteristics discussed above. Note that electron depletion can be observed between C1 and C2 atoms, referring to the characteristic of a π bond. (51) Correspondingly, TS-5 can be stabilized by such Ru−π interactions and therefore exhibits a lower activation barrier.

The Fermi level is set as 0.00 eV. The inset figures in (a) are the band-composed charge densities in the energy range of (1) [−7.00, −4.00], (2) [1.00, 3.00] eV, and (3) charge difference density.

The charge density difference is calculated by Δρ = ρad – ρmol – ρsurf, where ρad, ρmol, and ρsurf are the total charge densities of the propylene adsorbed surface, a transition state complex, and the clean surface. The yellow and blue contours denote electron accumulation and depletion, respectively. The isosurface values are set as ±0.30, ±0.10, ±0.10, and ±0.04 e/Å3. Carbon atoms are presented with brown circles; the hydrogen atoms in the adsorbed molecules are represented with white circles; Ru atom and hydrogen atoms adsorbed on the Ru active site are drawn as dark cyan and red circles, respectively.
Furthermore, the propylene selectivity of PDH catalysts is inversely proportional to the strength of propylene adsorption, in which weak adsorptions result in high selectivity. Several propylene adsorption configurations (e.g., di-σ, propylene π, and propylidyne) have been reported on metal catalysts, in which the di-σ mode is the most stable mode. (53) As shown in Figure 6d, propylene prefers to bind to the Ru(0001) surface with di-σ configuration, similar to that on Pt(111). (10) As seen in Figure 6c, the DOS of C1 and C2 overlap with Ru1 and Ru2 in a wide energy range from −6.00 eV to the Fermi level. Partial charge densities and differential charge densities show that two σ bonds between C and Ru atoms can be recognized at an energy range of [−6.00, −5.00] and [−4.00, −2.00] eV. The corresponding antibonding orbital is observed in an energy window of [0.00, 2.00] eV. As a result, two independent σ bonds (C1–Ru1 and C2–Ru2) are observed after the propylene adsorption on the Ru(0001) surface. Such a bonding nature between propylene and Ru surface atoms leads to strong exothermic adsorption with an adsorption energy of −1.78 eV, which agrees to the previous study. (14) However, such di-σ adsorption configuration is prohibited on 2D Ru–Pc. As seen in Figure 6b, the C1 and C2 atoms are bonded to the same Ru atom of the 2D Ru–Pc framework, with an adsorption energy of −0.55 eV and a Gibbs free energy of −0.44 eV. The C1–Ru and C2–Ru distances are 2.48 and 2.64 Å, respectively. Such configuration agrees very well to the “propylene π” adsorption mode (Figure 6b). (53) The strong overlap of the states of C1 and C2 atoms with the Ru atom in the energy windows of [−5.00, −3.00] and [2.00, 3.00] eV can be assigned as the bonding and antibonding orbitals, respectively (Figure 6a). Moreover, the differential charge density analysis shows a clear charge accumulation between the C═C double bond and the Ru atom, and confirms the “propylene π” interaction. Taking into consideration the energy barriers in PDH higher than 1.00 eV, such mild propylene adsorption energy would effectively prevent the deep dehydrogenations. Thus, the propylene selectivity on 2D Ru–Pc can be assured by (i) the large activation barriers for deep hydrogenations and (ii) the weak propylene adsorption.

(d) Propylene adsorption on the Ru(0001) surface (di-σ configuration). The C, H, and Ru atoms are represented by brown, white, and dark cyan circles, respectively.
In addition, as previous studies have revealed that the length of the alkane chain may possibly affect the selectivity of the C–H bond activations, the dehydrogenation of hexane has also been investigated on 2D Ru–Pc. (61,62) The detailed reaction pathway and the energy profiles can be found in Figure S8 and Table S3, repectively. As shown, 2D Ru–Pc exhibits not only high activity toward the dehydrogenations of the hexane but also distinct 1-hexene selectivity. The first C–H bond activation barrier is 1.46 eV (Ea-S1), which is slightly higher than that of propane. The subsequent dehydrogenation at the penultimate methylene group in the 1-hexyl radical (reaction S5) exhibits a lower energy barrier than that at the terminal methylene group (reaction S4) as well as the C–C bond cleavage of the 1-hexyl radicals (reaction S6). Note that, the activation barriers of the dehydrogenations are: Ea-S4 > Ea-S1 > Ea-S5, indicating that 1-hexene would be selectively generated (Figure S9). Calculations of Gibbs free energies show that such selectivity is maintained under the reaction conditions. Subsequent electronic structure analysis shows that the catalytic origins are similar with those in PDHs. More detailed information can be found in Figure S10. Furthermore, the rate-limiting barrier in the synthesis of 1-hexene is lower than any of over-dehydrogenations (Figure S9b). Taking into account that the 1-hexene adsorption energy is only −0.87 eV, it can be deduced that 1-hexene would desorb from the catalyst in advance of over-dehydrogenations. Such results agree well with the reaction paths in PDH, indicating that the length of the carbon chain would not significantly affect the activity and the selectivity of the 2D Ru–Pc framework.
Conclusions

In summary, DFT calculations have been performed to investigate the catalytic performance of the 2D TM-Pc frameworks in PDH. 2D Ru–Pc is selected as a candidate catalyst as it shows the lowest reaction energy of C–H bond activation and propylene adsorption. Subsequent NEB and dimer calculations show that 2D Ru–Pc exhibits distinct catalytic activity and propylene selectivity. The deep dehydrogenations can be inhibited by not only the high activation barriers but also the weak propylene–catalyst interactions. The analysis of DOS reveal that the enhanced propylene selectivity compared with Ru(0001) can be attributed to the different bonding characteristics between Ru active sites and the key transition-state complexes. On 2D Ru–Pc, 1-proxyl has strong tendency in forming π characteristics (reaction 5), rather than the enhancement of the C–Ru σ bond (reaction 4). Moreover, we show that the chain length of alkanes would not significantly affect the activity and the selectivity, indicating that the 2D Ru–Pc frameworks can be used as a general catalyst for selective dehydrogenation of alkane molecules. We believe that such 2D Ru–Pc would extend the applications of single-atom catalysts to selective dehydrogenation of alkanes, and inspire further catalyst design in future heterogeneous catalysis.
