 Based on the details provided in the document, this does not seem directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The document discusses dehydrogenation of propane to propene over a 2D Ru-Pc framework, but does not provide details on conversion, selectivity, yield, or other performance metrics. Since the core performance characteristics are not included, I cannot comprehensively evaluate the catalyst or process enhancements.
