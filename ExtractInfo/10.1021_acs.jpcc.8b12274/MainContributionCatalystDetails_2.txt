The document discusses theoretical investigations of propane dehydrogenation over a hypothetical 2D Ru-Pc catalyst, rather than experimental results for a specific catalyst. It does not contain details on conversion, selectivity, stability, deactivation rates, propane production rate, propylene yield, feed composition, partial pressure, temperature, flow rate, catalyst loading, etc. that are requested in the prompt. Since the necessary experimental results are not provided, I cannot extract the catalyst details and performance enhancements.
