 Unfortunately the given document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The document discusses propylene epoxidation using hydrogen and oxygen over gold-titanium catalysts, which is not directly related to converting propane to propylene. Since the document is not relevant, I will not extract any details about catalysts, performance enhancements, etc.
