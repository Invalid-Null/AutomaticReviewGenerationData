Abstract
Understanding the nature of Au-Ti bifunctional catalysis is important yet challenging for improving direct propylene epoxidation with H2 and O2 to propylene oxide (PO). Herein, we report a facile strategy to fabricate four different crystal sized TS-1 with the presence of highly active isolated Ti4+ species by adjusting the amount of TPAOH template. The resultant uncalcined zeolite samples, i.e., TS-1-B, are employed to load Au via deposition–precipitation with urea for obtaining similar sized Au immobilized on TS-1-B catalysts and thus excluding the size effects of Au active sites. The zeolite crystal size effects are further probed, and then decreasing the crystal size gives rise to the simultaneous promotion in PO formation rate and selectivity, as well as H2 efficiency. These are attributed to the Au-Ti electronic synergy based on UV–vis and XPS measurements. The insights reported here could benefit the development of high-efficiency Au-Ti bifunctional catalysts for this reaction.
1. Introduction
Direct epoxidation of propylene with H2 and O2, being the dream reaction for propylene oxide (PO) production, has raised wide scientific and industrial interests (Hayashi et al., 1998, Nijhuis et al., 1999, Huang and Haruta, 2012, Lee et al., 2012b). This process proceeds over Au immobilized on Ti-containing materials as the bifunctional catalysts with the Au-Ti dual sites (Haruta et al., 1998, Kalvachev et al., 1999, Uphade et al., 2002, Sinha et al., 2004). The isolated Ti4+ species especially over titanosilicates (e.g., TS-1 and TS-2) has been suggested as the active sites for propylene epoxidation with the resultant hydroperoxide species though the H2 reacting with O2 at the neighboring Au active site (Chowdhury et al., 2006, Bravo-Suárez et al., 2008, Zhang et al., 2020). The presence of micropores within the TS-1 has been revealed to cause severe catalyst deactivation based on our previous studies (Feng et al., 2014a). Along this line, employing the TS-1 samples without calcination (i.e., TS-1-B) for immobilizing Au catalyst has been developed as an effective strategy for improved catalyst stability. As a consecutive effort, an attempt is therefore necessary to further tailor and balance the properties of the Au-Ti dual sites over the Au/TS-1-B catalysts for higher PO formation rate and selectivity as well as H2 efficiency in addition to catalyst stability.
Considering the remarkable structure sensitivity of the Au/TS-1-B bifunctional catalysts (Feng et al., 2014b, Tang et al., 2019), we have combined experimental with theoretical studies to reveal the effects of Au size, in which the Au corner is the active site for the reaction of H2 with O2, and the low-coordinated Au atom combining with Au(111) surface is favorable for H2O2 formation. Notably, it remains an unresolved issue to understand the underlying nature of the zeolite crystal size effects for the Ti active site. For the widely used TS-1-B samples, they exhibited the crystal sizes of ca. 300–500 nm under the typical hydrothermal synthetic conditions (Lee et al., 2012a, Feng et al., 2017, Zhang et al., 2020). If we want to understand the zeolite crystal size effects, there needs to develop a strategy for synthesizing different sized TS-1-B, which would be facilitated by tailoring the amount of TPAOH template according the synthesis mechanism of titanosilicates (van der Pol and van Hooff, 1992, Li et al., 2017a). Additionally, the deposition–precipitation method with urea (DPU) rather than alkali metal-containing precipitants has been recently proposed in our work for immobilization of Au species, which can avoid the interference of the residual alkaline on fundamentally understanding the synergistic Au-Ti catalysis (Zanella et al., 2002, Zanella et al., 2005, Lu et al., 2013).
In this work, four different crystal sized TS-1 were first fabricated by a facile strategy with varied amount of TPAOH template, and the resultant TS-1-B were employed to immobilize Au particles via the DPU method for direct propylene epoxidation with H2 and O2. These catalysts displayed similar Au particle sizes, which provided a chance to investigate the potential nature of the TS-1-B crystal size effects on the catalysts without the effects of Au size. The plausible catalyst structure-performance relationship was constructed depending on multiple techniques, including high angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), Diffuse reflection UV–vis spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), N2 physisorption and Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The Au-Ti electronic synergy was proposed for the simultaneously enhanced PO formation rate, PO selectivity as well as H2 efficiency.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of different crystal sized TS-1-B
Diverse crystal sized TS-1-B samples were synthesized through the modified process referring to the literatures (Khomane et al., 2002, Deng et al., 2013). As a representative synthesis, 21.0 g tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, 99%) was dropwise added into the mixture of 10.6 g tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 25 wt% in water) and 25.0 g ultrapure water (self-produced by ELGA PURELAB Classic, 18.2 MΩ·cm) with stirring, where the molar ratio of TPAOH/Si is 0.13, and then the mixture was heated to 50 °C for hydrolysis to get a clear solution. On the other side, 0.34 g titanium (IV) tetrabutoxide (TBOT, 99%) was dispersed into 10 mL anhydrous isopropanol, followed by adding 4.1 g TPAOH into the solution to stir for half an hour. The obtained Ti-containing solution was slowly dropped into the prepared Si solution and then the mixture was kept at 82 °C for 3 h to evaporate alcohols, in the meantime a little water was supplied to maintain the solution volume. The as-synthesized solution was poured into the Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and then hydrothermally reacted for 24 h at 170 °C under autogenous pressure. Once cooling to the room temperature (RT), the crystalline solid was centrifuged, washed three times, and dried at 120 °C overnight to get the final TS-1-B. For the regulation of crystal sizes, other TPAOH/Si molar ratios of 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20 for the Si dissolution were also adopted to synthesize diverse zeolites. The corresponding samples were signed as TS-1-B(1), TS-1-B(2), TS-1-B(3)and TS-1-B(4) corresponding to the TPAOH/Si ratios of 0.10, 0.13, 0.15 and 0.20, respectively.
2.2. Preparation of Au/TS-1-B catalysts
Deposition-precipitation with urea (i.e., DPU method) was applied for Au/TS-1-B catalysts preparation according to the previous reports (Wang et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2020). Typically, 1.0 g of the as-synthesized TS-1-B sample was dispersed into 39 mL of ultrapure water, then 1 mL of the chloroauric acid aqueous solution (HAuCl4, 4.85 mmol·L−1) and ca. 0.1 g of urea were added in sequence and dissolved in the slurry. The mixture was kept at 90 °C for 6 h with stirring. After reaction, the solid was centrifuged from the slurry, washed once, and then dried under vacuum overnight. The whole process was performed with the avoidance of illumination.
2.3. Characterization
Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) photos were acquired via FEI Nova NanoSEM 450 microscope at 3 kV. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) photos were photographed on JEOL JEM-2100 microscope running at 200 kV. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected by Bruker D8 Advance X-ray polycrystalline diffractometer by the Cu-Kα radiation (1.5418 Å), with the scanning rate of 10°·min−1 among the 2θ angle range of 5° to 50°. Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy (DR UV–vis) was collected by PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer among the wavelength of 190–800 nm. N2 physisorption were carried out on Micromeritics 3Flex instrument operated at liquid nitrogen temperature of −196 °C. Specific surface areas of the zeolite samples were calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) model with the adsorption branch at the relative pressure P/P0 range from 0.05 to 0.30. Elemental compositions (Ti or Au) of samples or catalysts were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometer (ICP-AES, Agilent 725). High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) photos were obtained by a Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin equipped with a digitally processed STEM imaging system. The Au nanoparticle size distributions of catalysts were acquired via counting at least 200 random nanoparticles. Thermogravimetry was carried out via PerkinElmer TGA Pyris 1 through heating samples from room temperature to 800 °C with the rate of 10 °C min−1 in N2 flow. Surface elemental information of catalysts was supplied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with an Al Kα radiation and calibrated based on C 1 s peak of adventitious carbon at 284.8 eV.
2.4. Catalytic testing
The epoxidation reaction was carried out in a quartz tubular fixed-bed reactor with the inner diameter of 6 mm. 0.15 g Au/TS-1-B catalysts sieved with 100 mesh were heated from RT to reaction temperature (200 °C) at the rate of ca. 1 °C min−1 with the mixture gas of H2 and N2 and then kept under atmospheric pressure. The feed gases were inlet at the total flow of 35 mL min−1 containing high-pure C3H6, H2, O2 and N2 with the ratio of volumetric flow as 1/1/1/7. Products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC112A) using FID with Porapak T column) for C3H6, ethanal, and C3-oxygenates (i.e., PO, acrolein, propanal and acetone), and TCD with 5A and Porapak Q column for H2, O2 and CO2, respectively. Catalytic performances were calculated by normalization method defined as follows:
C3H6 conversion = moles of (C3-oxygenates + 2/3 ethanal + CO2/3)/moles of C3H6 in feed.
C3-oxygenate selectivity = moles of C3-oxygenate/moles of (C3-oxygenates + 2/3 ethanal + CO2/3).
Ethanal selectivity = moles of (2/3 ethanal)/moles of (C3-oxygenates + 2/3 ethanal + CO2/3).
CO2 selectivity = moles of CO2/moles of (C3-oxygenates + 2/3 ethanal + CO2/3).
H2 efficiency = moles of PO produced/moles of H2 consumed.
To be sure, this process conducts the main reaction shown as equation (1) and related blank testing has been carried out and proved that no PO is detected under other conditions except the combination of C3H6, H2 and O2.

In addition, H2 efficiency used in our studies is defined as the ratio of the moles of PO produced to those of H2 converted as the above formula shown, and more details on its calculation have been discussed in our previous work (Zhang et al., 2020).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Remarkable crystal size effects of Au/TS-1-B catalysts
As described in Introduction, a facile strategy was proposed to regulate the crystal sizes of TS-1-B by tailoring the amounts and addition mode of TPAOH template. The as-synthesized TS-1-B samples were first photographed via FESEM and HRTEM measurements, and the obtained images are shown in Fig. 1. For commonly used TPAOH amount (i.e., TPAOH/Si ratio of 0.13) for dissolution of Si species, the synthesized TS-1-B displays typical coffin-like morphology based on the above representative FESEM and HRTEM images in Fig. 1b, which is similar to the conventionally synthesized sample as reported in the previous studies. Moreover, the average crystal size of the zeolite is approximate 400 nm, slightly smaller than that of common sample of ca. 500 nm (Zhang et al., 2020), which is probably due to the extra addition of TPAOH from the Ti solution.

Along this line, the reduced amount of TPAOH template than the common value (i.e. TPAOH/Si ratio of 0.10) was also employed in synthesis system, and the synthesized TS-1-B possesses the significantly enlarged crystal size of nearly 900 nm than the conventional one’s as shown in Fig. 1a. On the contrary, when the dosage of TPAOH was increased to TPAOH/Si ratio of 0.18, the resulted zeolite exhibits a smaller crystal size of about 300 nm as presented in Fig. 1c. And when the further added TPAOH dosage was adopted, the synthesized zeolite just have 200 nm in crystal size as shown in Fig. 1d, which is reduced by half compared to the above common zeolite (i.e., TS-1-B(2)). In other words, by tailoring the dosages of TPAOH template, crystal sizes of the synthesized TS-1-B can be remarkably changed. For the hydrothermal synthesis process, the increase in the TPAOH amount is well-known to enhance the solution alkalinity for dissolving Si species and then accelerating the nucleation with the more TPA+ template to form higher supersaturation of nuclei (Thangaraj et al., 1992, van der Pol and van Hooff, 1992, Renzo, 1998, Deng et al., 2013). This tends to produce smaller crystals of TS-1-B, indicating that increasing the TPAOH amount could be an effective way to regulate the smaller crystal sizes of TS-1-B.
XRD was further employed to detect the crystalline structure of the four TS-1-B. As shown in Fig. 2a, all these zeolites display the same diffraction peaks, which are in good accordance with the typical MFI topology (Taramasso et al., 1983, Khomane et al., 2002, Li et al., 2018). The gradually weakened diffraction intensities among these patterns imply the diminishing crystal sizes, corresponding to the aforementioned observations of FESEM and HRTEM. Additionally, the Ti species in these samples were investigated by means of DR UV–vis spectroscopy, and the corresponding spectra are presented in Fig. 2b. Obviously, each TS-1-B shows a dominant absorption band located at ca. 205 nm and a shoulder band around 270 nm. According to previous studies (Vayssilov, 1997, Drago et al., 1998, Zuo et al., 2011, Kim et al., 2018), the bands at 205 nm were ascribed to the isolated tetracoordinated Ti (i.e., Ti (IV)) species substituted within the MFI structure framework. Furthermore, considering that the reserved TPA+ template causes the new band due to the ligand effects between the TPA+ and Ti specie (Geobaldo et al., 1992, Parker and Millini, 2006, Huang et al., 2010), the calcinated zeolites at 550 °C for eliminating TPA+ were also characterized by UV–vis, and the related spectra are also offered in Fig. 2b. Clearly, the shoulder bands around 270 nm disappeared over the calcinated zeolites. These outcomes indicate that the Ti species over the above as-synthesized TS-1-B samples are mainly in the form of isolated Ti (IV), and the four samples exhibit similar Ti species.

The above four different sized TS-1-B possessing the similar Ti species were further applied to immobilize Au nanoparticles for the Au/TS-1-B catalysts preparation through DPU method at the similar Au loadings of ca. 0.09 wt% measured by ICP. The prepared catalysts were comparatively studied for propylene epoxidation with H2 and O2, and their performances are exhibited in Fig. 3. Obviously, these four catalysts display remarkably different catalytic performances relating to their zeolite crystal sizes. As the catalyst with regular crystal size of ca. 400 nm, Au/TS-1-B(2) exhibits relatively stable PO formation rate of 100 gPOh−1kgCat−1, PO selectivity of 83% and H2 efficiency of 30%, respectively, which come up to the common levels reported by our previous work (Zhang et al., 2020). When crystal size of the employed TS-1-B increases to nearly 900 nm, performances of the corresponding catalyst, i.e., Au/TS-1-B(1), are found to be dramatically suppressed, which are just PO formation rate of 66 gPOh−1kgCat−1, PO selectivity of 78% and H2 efficiency of 11%, respectively. Oppositely, with the reduction of crystal size to 300 nm, the corresponding catalyst, that is Au/TS-1-B(3), presents simultaneously enhanced performances. And even the zeolite crystal size is further decreased to about 200 nm for Au/TS-1-B(4), it exhibits the best catalytic performances among these four catalysts, including PO formation rate of 144 gPOh−1kgCat−1, PO selectivity of 91% and H2 efficiency of 40%, respectively. In other words, as the TS-1-B crystal size decreases, the corresponding Au-Ti bifunctional catalyst shows the simultaneous promotion of PO formation rate and selectivity as well as H2 efficiency. These results imply that decreasing the TS-1-B crystal size is an effective way to remarkably enhance the catalytic performance of the bifunctional catalyst for epoxidation of propylene with H2 and O2.

3.2. Catalyst structure–activity relationship
For understanding the above remarkably different catalytic performances, the structural and electronic characters of the four different sized TS-1-B immobilized Au bifunctional catalysts were studied through multiple techniques. HAADF-STEM measurements were first carried out for the prepared Au/TS-1-B catalysts, and the results are displayed in Fig. 4. Clearly, all the catalysts show uniform Au nanoparticles distributions on the surfaces of TS-1-B. The Au particle sizes over the four Au catalysts were counted based on over 200 random particles, which present similar Au particle average sizes of ca. 2.8 nm. Thus, it can be concluded that the distinctions in the catalytic performances of the four catalysts are not caused by the distinctions from their Au particle sizes. That is to say, the Au particle size effects is not the dominant factor for the above results.

To further understand the remarkably different performances over these catalysts, the TOF based on the number of Au corner active site was calculated using the Au corner model established and applied in our previous work (Feng et al., 2014b), which is detailedly explained in Table S1. As shown in Fig. 5, these diverse sized TS-1-B immobilized Au catalysts present the different activities per Au corner site gradually increasing along with the zeolite crystal size decreases, which does not conform to the model setting of that the specified kind of the Au active site has the same activity regardless of the Au particle size. This seems to portend that the change for the electronic properties of the Au-Ti dual active sites over these catalysts.

Therefore, DR UV–vis spectroscopy was firstly adopted to explore the distinctions in the electronic characters of the four Au/TS-1-B catalysts. As Fig. 6a shown, the observed wide bands at around 520 nm in these spectra are assigned to the feature surface plasmon resonance from Au nanoparticles (Chowdhury et al., 2006, Sacaliuc et al., 2007, Lin et al., 2015). The relatively settled positions of these absorption bands indicate similar Au particle sizes of these catalysts (Daniel and Astruc, 2004), which is consistent with the above results of HAADF-STEM observations. Moreover, these Au bands are increasingly strengthened as the TS-1-B crystal size decreases, and the corresponding Ti bands at around 205 nm are gradually weakened. In other words, the smaller sized TS-1-B facilitates the electron transfer between the double active sites of Au and Ti species over these supported catalysts.

In addition, XPS measurements were also performed to probe more details about the surface electronic characters of these Au/TS-1-B catalysts. Fig. 6b and c exhibit the Au 4f and Ti 2p XPS signals of the four Au/TS-1-B catalysts as well as their deconvolution results, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6b, these catalysts present weakening intensities of Au 4f signals along with the diminishing zeolite crystal size, which is most likely due to the decreasing density of the immobilized Au nanoparticles with similar sizes as the TS-1-B crystal size decreases and thus the specific surface area increases. Given that the similar Ti content and species as well as the same crystalline structure of these used TS-1-B zeolite over the Au-Ti catalysts, the decreased Au density leads to the more Ti sites surround the Au nanoparticle, in other words, the increasement of the relative Ti amount at the synergetic microdomain combining the Au with Ti sites. This could be further estimated based on the surface element contents over the catalysts determined by XPS measurement as presented in Table S2. Our previous study has revealed that the higher Ti content over the Au/TS-1-B catalyst could capture more as-generated hydroperoxide species from the nearby Au site, and thus facilitate the epoxidation of propylene with it to produce PO and reduce the its self-decomposition and the over-oxidation of PO. (Feng et al., 2015) This could offer a feasible explanation for the simultaneous promotions of PO formation rate and selectivity as well as H2 efficiency.
The dominated Au singles of these catalysts can be assigned to metallic Au species (Lee et al., 2014, Li et al., 2017b), and their binding energies of Au0 4f7/2 peaks gradually upshift from 83.3 to 83.5 eV with the TS-1-B crystal sizes decrease. Accordingly, the Ti 2p signals of these Au/TS-1-B catalysts show that the binding energies of Ti4+ 2p3/2 peaks downshift from 459.70 to 459.55 eV with the crystal sizes decrease, which could be considered as the more electronegative Ti (IV) species over these catalysts (Stakheev et al., 1993, Hayashi et al., 1998).
By combining the previous experimental and theoretical studies (Stangland et al., 2000, Zwijnenburg et al., 2002, Sivadinarayana et al., 2004, Chen et al., 2013, Sun et al., 2014, Tang et al., 2019), the higher Au binding energy will be conducive to activating hydrogen to generate more hydroperoxide active intermediate, which probably promote the reaction activity. Simultaneously, given that the main product PO could be adsorbed on the surface of catalyst by the interaction with the Ti sites and subsequently converted to byproducts by ring-opening reactions (Mul et al., 2001), the Ti species with the lower binding energy and thus the electron-richer property would be favorable for PO desorption and then promote the selectivity. In view of the above two aspects, it is concluded that synergy between the higher Au and the lower Ti binding energies of the Au and Ti sites would benefit the PO activity and selectivity as well as H2 efficiency, which provides a possible interpretation for the optimal performance over the Au/TS-1-B catalyst with the smallest zeolite crystal size.
As the above discussion, the zeolite crystal sizes of TS-1-B remarkably affect the surface characteristics of the corresponding immobilized Au catalysts and thus their catalytic performances. The plausible schematic diagram of this process is displayed as Fig. 7, indicating that the reaction of H2 and with O2 proceeds on the Au active site to generate the hydroperoxide intermediate, and then the epoxidation of propylene with this intermediate occurs at the nearby Ti active site to product PO. For this structure-sensitive reaction, the zeolite crystal size effects over the Au-Ti catalysts are revealed for the first time, showing the simultaneous promotion of PO activity and selectivity as well as H2 efficiency as the crystal size of the employed TS-1-B zeolite decreases from 900 nm to 200 nm. With the similar Au size and Ti species, the TS-1-B sample with the decreased crystal size could possess the modified surface natures leading to the enhanced electronic synergy between Au and Ti active sites, that is, the higher binding energy of Au site would facilitate the formation of hydroperoxide species, while the lower Ti binding energy could promote the activation of propylene.

3.3. Understanding of TS-1-B crystal size-dependent byproduct selectivity
Besides the PO activity, the byproduct selectivity of the Au/TS-1-B catalyst is another important issue. In the catalytic tests of the four Au/TS-1-B catalysts with different zeolite crystal sizes, the five main byproducts were also studied and the corresponding selectivities are presented in Fig. 8. Obviously, as the crystal sizes decrease, these Au/TS-1-B catalysts exhibit gradually decreasing selectivity of these byproducts. According to our previous studies (Wang et al., 2019), the higher Au binding energy can reduce the acrolein production due to the weakened partial oxidation of the methyl in propylene molecule, which stay consistent with the above Au XPS results and the corresponding acrolein selectivity over the four catalysts. Then, for propanal and acetone, which possibly come from the isomerization of PO on the acid sites over the catalysts, their selectivities also present downward tendency as the crystal sizes decrease.

Considering the tailored dosages of template and subsequent uncalcination treatment for the synthesized zeolites, the residual TPA species probably influence the surface properties of these zeolites and then catalytic performances, which probably plays the role of acid center for the side reactions. By means of thermogravimetry analysis, the amounts of residual TPA over the four TS-1-B were measured as shown in Fig. 9 and present increasing tendency with the crystal sizes decrease, which are in accord with the added amounts during the synthesis. When taking into account of the augmented external surface areas for the smaller crystal-sized TS-1-B, the specific contents of external TPA exhibit remarkable reduction. That is to say that the smaller crystal-sized TS-1-B possess the lower TPA density over the larger external surface, which could weaken the PO isomerization to form propanal and acetone. Moreover, the lower Ti binding energy could improve the interaction between propylene and Ti species, which would benefit the activation of C3H6 to react with hydroperoxide intermediate for PO production, so as to weaken the deep oxidation of C3-species to form ethanol and CO2.

Besides the electronic synergy between the Au and Ti active sites over the bifunctional catalyst, the presence of defect site on the zeolite substrate probably take effects on the catalytic performances. For studying the properties of defects over these TS-1-B samples, 29Si NMR measurements were further carried out and the corresponding spectra are exhibited as Fig. 10. The four samples present two distinct signals at −113 and −104 ppm in the 29Si NMR spectra, which could be assigned to the characteristic [Si(OSi)4] (Q4) and [Si(OSi)3OH] (Q3) structural units, respectively. (Labouriau et al., 1998, Zhuang et al., 2004, Feng et al., 2017) Specially, the Q3 signal in the resonance spectrum is commonly considered as the presence of lattice defects mostly as the form of surface silanol species (Zhuang et al., 2002, Yang et al., 2008). After Gaussian deconvolution of these spectra, the peak area ratios of Q3/Q4 for the four zeolite samples were calculated, which indicates that the smaller sized TS-1-B possesses more defective silanol species. This is likely due to the extra usage of template TPAOH in the process of hydrothermal synthesis for obtaining the smaller crystal sized TS-1-B, in which the higher concentration of TPAOH causes the imperfect condensation of Si species and then the formation of Si vacancies (Zhao et al., 2000, Cundy and Cox, 2005, Wang et al., 2016). Based on this, it is deduced that there are more defective Ti species as the form of Ti(OSi)3OH over the smaller sized TS-1-B sample nearby the defective silanol nest. Some studies from the experimental and theoretical viewpoints have demonstrated that the defective framework Ti site exhibits preferable properties for the activating the reaction between the hydroperoxide intermediate with propylene (Wells et al., 2004, Wells et al., 2006, Taylor et al., 2007, Yuan et al., 2011, Chen et al., 2017, Nie et al., 2017), which could account for the promoted performances over the Au/TS-1-B catalyst with smaller crystal size.

4. Conclusions
In this work, a facile yet effective strategy have been developed to fabricate four different sized TS-1-B samples by tailoring the amount of TPAOH template, and used the DPU method to synthesize the corresponding four Au/TS-1-B catalysts having the similar Au particle sizes for this reaction. This can provide a chance to investigate the potential nature of the TS-1-B crystal size effects under the excluded Au size effects. The varied electronic properties of these difference sized TS-1-B have been correlated with the tailored Au-Ti electronic properties. When decreasing the TS-1-B crystal size, the Au-Ti electronic synergy has been proposed for the simultaneous promotion of PO formation rate and selectively as well as H2 efficiency. These insights could highlight the crucial role of the Au-Ti electronic synergy, which would shed new light on the fabrication and manipulation of high-efficiency Au immobilized on titanosilicates catalyst for direct propylene epoxidation with H2 and O2.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
