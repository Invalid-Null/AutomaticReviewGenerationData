Graphical Abstract
Hydrogen Spillover: Encapsulated metal catalysts not only provide ideal model systems for studying fundamental aspects of hydrogen spillover, but also can be used for designing advanced hydroprocessing catalysts with enhanced activity, distinct chemoselectivity, and improved catalyst durability.
Abstract
Hydrogen spillover has been one of the most debated concepts in the field of heterogeneous catalysis due to limited ways of studying it. The main controversies in hydrogen spillover, especially from the viewpoint of its catalytic functions, can be mainly attributed to the absence of well-defined model catalysts that can provide direct proof of the catalytic functions of hydrogen spillover. In this article, we will provide an overview of the recent progress made with encapsulated metal catalysts, which can act as an ideal model catalyst for proving the existence and catalytic functions of hydrogen spillover. We will also demonstrate unique opportunities of using the encapsulated metal catalysts for designing advanced hydroprocessing catalysts with enhanced activity, distinct chemoselectivity, and increased catalyst durability.
Introduction
Hydrogen spillover can be generally defined as the migration of activated hydrogen atoms from a hydrogen-rich metal cluster to the surface of a catalyst support where H2 dissociation is improbable.1, 2 The first direct experimental evidence for hydrogen spillover was demonstrated by Khoobiar in 1964.3 In this experiment, it was demonstrated that WO3 can be reduced by H2 to blue HxWO3 even at ambient temperature (323 K) when it is in physical contact with Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. Without the presence of physically mixed Pt catalysts, WO3 can only be reduced at above 473 K. This result clearly indicated that activated hydrogen atoms generated from the Pt surface can migrate over relatively long distances via interparticular junctions and react with WO3. Since this first demonstration, hydrogen spillover has attracted the interests of many scientists who have tried not only to explain it, but also to use it in designing advanced hydroprocessing catalysts. Hundreds of papers have been published and five international conferences have been held on this topic. Unfortunately, scientific attentions have gradually faded away because there were a limited number of direct proofs of spillover, a scientific basis for discussion was lacking, and special applications were not discovered. It seems that scientists have too often speculated the presence of hydrogen spillover as a possible explanation for unexpected results, which can actually better be explained by other reasons.1 A very comprehensive review paper was recently written by Prins (2012),1 which provides well-balanced and critical insights on the debates surrounding hydrogen spillover.
The main controversies in hydrogen spillover, especially from the viewpoint of its catalytic functions, can be mainly attributed to the absence of well-defined model catalysts that can provide direct proof of the catalytic functions of hydrogen spillover. In conventional catalysts, metal clusters are located on an open porous support surface and thus organic reactants as well as H2 can freely access the metal surface in the course of the catalytic reaction (Scheme 1 a). This allows the catalytic reactions to occur not only on the surface of the support via hydrogen spillover, but also on the metal surface via conventional reaction pathways, thus leading to difficulty in decoupling the contributions from both pathways. Such ambiguity in catalytic interpretation can be avoided by designing model catalysts where metal clusters are selectively encapsulated in a dense support matrix so that only small H2 (0.29 nm) can access, but larger organic reactants cannot (Scheme 1 b). Because the organic molecules cannot access the encapsulated metal clusters, the whole observed catalytic activities can be attributed to the reaction between the spilt-over hydrogen and organic reactants at the external surface of the supports. Very recently, our group prepared several model catalysts meeting this requirement and used them to obtain a fundamental understanding of hydrogen spillover and also to explore the catalytic functions of spilt-over hydrogen.4, 5 These works not only provided strong evidences of the existence of hydrogen spillover, but also showed the unique possibility of using the encapsulated metal catalysts in the design of chemoselective and highly durable catalysts. By virtue of advanced material chemistry, several other groups have also reported interesting model catalysts and clearly showed a potential use of hydrogen spillover for the design of advanced hydrogenation catalysts.6, 7 In this Concept paper, we will provide an overview of the recent progress made with these unique encapsulated metal catalysts, which can give new insight into designing advanced hydroprocessing catalysts with enhanced chemoselectivity and catalyst lifetime.

Understanding Hydrogen Spillover from a Catalysis Point of View
We need to start our discussion from correctly understanding hydrogen spillover from the viewpoint of catalysis. It is ironic that, in recent years, hydrogen spillover has been more intensively studied in the field of hydrogen storage8–16 rather than in heterogeneous catalysis where the hydrogen spillover concept was first demonstrated. In hydrogen storage, hydrogen spillover was used to enhance the H2 storage capacities of carbon-based materials by using the chemisorption of atomic hydrogen on their surface. To achieve the increased uptake of H2, atomic hydrogen generated on the metal catalyst surface should migrate to the carbon support (or adsorbent) surface to form sufficiently stable CH12–15 and OH (with oxygen functional groups) bonds.16 This means that the carbon supports need to be hydrogenated as a consequence of hydrogen spillover for enhancing the H2 uptake. Of course, the newly formed bonds should not be so strong for the reversible desorption of the chemisorbed hydrogen atoms. Because a large number of recent articles related to hydrogen spillover have been reported from the hydrogen storage community, many scientists often misunderstand hydrogen spillover as the ‘hydrogenation of supports’ (Scheme 2 a). However, it should be noted that hydrogenation of supports is just one of the possible consequences of hydrogen spillover rather than the hydrogen spillover itself. Accurately speaking, hydrogen spillover is the ‘transport phenomena’ of atomic hydrogen from the metal surface to support surface rather than the subsequent ‘reaction’ between the atomic hydrogen and support surface.

Two different consequences of hydrogen spillover. a) hydrogenation of reducible support (adsorbent) by spilt-over hydrogen. b) net migration of hydrogen atom from the metal surface to the organic reactant via hydrogen spillover (‘organic hydrogenation’). If one H atom on the support surface is transferred to the unsaturated organic reactant (blue arrow), while another H atom is simultaneously re-filled from the metal catalyst surface (red arrow), the overall oxidation state of support does not change.
Notably, although the hydrogenation of catalyst supports can provide direct evidence for hydrogen spillover,3, 17–21 as in the case of Khoobiar’s WO3 reduction experiment,3 its absence cannot disprove the presence of hydrogen spillover ‘during catalysis’. From the catalytic viewpoint, hydrogen spillover can be used for various hydrogenation reactions if there is a ‘net migration’ of H atoms from the metal catalyst surface to the organic reactants. The required role of the support is to provide a path through which the activated hydrogen can be transferred from the metal catalyst surface to unsaturated organic reactants. Whether the supports can be stably hydrogenated or not does not matter for the catalytic use of hydrogen spillover. In certain cases, atomic hydrogen can migrate over the support surface without detectable hydrogenation of supports (this is especially the case on non-reducible supports) and can react with organic reactants adsorbed on the support surface (Scheme 2 b). Actually, hydrogen atoms that have reacted too strongly with supports should not participate in the reactions with organic reactants because they have been stabilized by the strong bond formation. This means that the hydrogenated sites on the support surface are not necessarily the active sites where the catalytic reaction takes place.
For hydrogen spillover (i.e., a net migration of atomic hydrogen from metal to support surface) to take place, a thermodynamic driving force is required to compensate the thermodynamic penalty required for breaking the HM bond on the metal catalyst surface (binding energy: 250±20 kJ mol−1 for most metals22). Unless a new bond of comparable energy forms with atomic hydrogen, the migration of atomic hydrogen from metal catalyst to elsewhere would be thermodynamically unlikely because the enthalpy contribution would be more dominant than that of entropy in hydrogen spillover.1 If we aim to use hydrogen spillover to enhance hydrogen storage capacity on supports (adsorbents), such driving force should be found in the strong bond formation between the atomic hydrogen and support surface. In the cases of carbon-based adsorbents, the formation of CH12–15 and OH16 bonds on the carbon surface may provide such thermodynamic driving force. In the cases of semiconducting metal oxides such as WO3,3, 17, 18 MoO3,19 TiO2,20 etc.,21 atomic hydrogen can chemically react with the supports to partially reduce the framework as in the case of Khoobiar’s WO3 experiment.3 After the supports are fully hydrogenated, there would be no remaining thermodynamic driving force and thus hydrogen spillover would not occur any further, i.e., reaching an equilibrium of H2 adsorption capacity in hydrogen storage. If we aim to use hydrogen spillover for catalytic hydrogenation, unsaturated organic molecules must be continuously supplied as a reactant along with H2. Under this condition, the weakly bound hydrogen atoms on the supports can continuously react with organic molecules while regenerating a thermodynamic driving force for hydrogen spillover. Therefore, under the steady-state reaction condition of catalytic hydrogenation, the ultimate thermodynamic driving force for hydrogen spillover is the bond forming reactions between unsaturated organic reactants and atomic hydrogen rather than those between the supports and atomic hydrogen. This means that the reducibility (hydrogenation capability) of the support is important only for hydrogen storage but not for the catalytic applications of hydrogen spillover.
Surfaces of non-reducible metal oxides such as SiO2, γ-Al2O3, and aluminosilicates cannot provide strong binding sites for atomic hydrogen unless they have special defect sites.1 According to valence bond theory, a hydrogen atom does not form a chemical bond with atoms having saturated bonds. Theoretical calculations indicate that H atoms are repulsed by the surfaces of non-reducible solids whose atoms have all electrons in closed shells, such as SiO2,23 and γ-Al2O3.24 This means that, without a supply of organic reactants to continuously react with the atomic hydrogen generated from the metal catalysts, there will be no thermodynamic driving force for hydrogen spillover. Consequently, it is difficult to employ hydrogen spillover as a way of enhancing hydrogen storage capacity on these non-reducible supports (adsorbents). However, with a continuous supply of unsaturated organic reactants for catalytic hydrogenation, the bond forming reaction between the organic reactants and atomic hydrogen can provide a strong thermodynamic driving force for hydrogen spillover as explained above. If the supports can provide a path with a reasonably low activation barrier, or if the reaction temperature is high enough to overcome the activation barrier for the migration of atomic hydrogen, hydrogen spillover may still be able to participate in the catalytic hydrogenation reactions. Very recently, several works with well-defined model catalysts provided strong experimental evidences supporting the catalytic functions of hydrogen spillover in aluminosilicates4 and SiO26, 7 during hydrogenation.
Recent Case Studies on Hydrogen Spillover using Encapsulated Metal Catalysts
Hydrogen spillover in aluminosilicates
Amorphous SiO2-Al2O3 and zeolites (crystalline aluminosilicates) are an important family of non-reducible metal oxides, which have been widely used as solid acid catalysts.25 In many industrially important hydroprocessing reactions, such as reforming, hydrocracking, and hydroisomerization, the aluminosilicate materials are supported with various metal catalysts and used as metal/acid bifunctional catalysts.25, 26 Therefore, understanding the existence and the catalytic role of hydrogen spillover on these aluminosilicate-based materials is highly important.
To study hydrogen spillover in aluminosilicates, metal clusters encapsulated in LTA zeolites (NaA and KA) have often been used as model catalysts27–30 because these zeolites contain very small pore apertures (0.3–0.4 nm)31 that selectively allow the diffusion of H2 (kinetic diameter: 0.29 nm) over various organic molecules. These materials can act as the ideal model catalyst described in Scheme 1 b. Unfortunately, earlier catalytic studies using these materials have not led to a generally agreeable conclusion regarding hydrogen spillover. Pt/NaA was reported to show negligible hydrogenation activities for isobutylene27 and ethylbenzene,28 indicating inappreciable catalytic function of hydrogen spillover. It was also reported that the isobutylene hydrogenation activity of Pt/KA was negligible, but significantly increases when mixed with NaY and H-ZSM-5.29 This was ascribed to hydrogen spillover from the Pt/KA to the NaY or H-ZSM-5 surface where the isobutene was hydrogenated. TEM investigation showed, however, that some of the Pt particles were much larger than the zeolite cages and that part of the zeolite structure was damaged, making the catalytic interpretation rather vague. Similarly, H. Yang et al.30 reported that Pt/KA mixed with HY zeolite can hydrogenate naphthalene. Interestingly, after an additional coating of SiO2 on the Pt/KA, the catalyst showed good resistance to H2S poisoning during naphthalene hydrogenation due to the inaccessibility of H2S to the zeolite encapsulated Pt catalyst.30
The inconsistent conclusions made with earlier experiments with Pt/LTA systems can be explained in part by premature conclusions based on less rigorous characterizations, as well as by the possibility that important parameters governing the spillover phenomena may have been overlooked. Especially, we focused on the possible role of surface hydroxyl groups such as Brønsted acid sites (BAS) on the migration of atomic hydrogen. Earlier theoretical calculations indicated a transfer of hydrogen atom between metal clusters and BAS of zeolite.32–34 It was also demonstrated that BAS of zeolite can be homolytically decomposed, indicating the substantial radical-like characteristics of BAS.35 From an experimental point of view, a different density of surface hydroxyl groups (or BAS) can be unintentionally generated during the reduction of cationic Pt precursors in zeolite36 and also by solid state ion-exchange when Pt/LTA is mixed with acidic diluents before catalytic measurements.28–30 However, none of the earlier works systematically investigated the role of surface hydroxyl groups on hydrogen spillover.
To study the role of surface hydroxyls on hydrogen spillover, we recently revisited the Pt/LTA system.4 In this work, highly selective Pt encapsulation in the micropores of NaA zeolite was attained by using a mercaptosilane-assisted metal encapsulation method.27 Pt/NaA zeolites with varied zeolite crystallite sizes (i.e., external surface areas of zeolite) were synthesized by adding polyethyleneglycol (PEG) during zeolite synthesis,37 to additionally study the effect of support surface area on catalytic activity. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 1 a) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis revealed that the Pt clusters have an average diameter of ≈1 nm in all samples, which corresponds to the diameter of a NaA α-cage (1.1 nm).31 To investigate the effect of surface hydroxyl groups on hydrogen spillover, the Pt/NaA samples were ion-exchanged with controlled amounts of NH4+ and calcined at 673 K. As the degree of NH4+ exchange was increased, the resultant samples possessed reduced amounts of Na+ (i.e., decationized) compared with the pristine Pt/NaA which had a Na+/Al ratio of unity. Two series of decationized samples were prepared to have Na+/Al=≈0.5 (denoted as Pt/NaHA) and Na+/Al≪0.1 (denoted as Pt/HA). The decationization led to a gradual loss of zeolite crystallinity (Figure 1 c) because the NH4+ form of highly aluminous zeolite is unstable and amorphitized upon the release of NH3 during heat treatment.31 29Si and 27Al MAS NMR spectra revealed that a partial dealumination (loss of tetrahedral aluminum) is the reason for the zeolite amorphization. In IR spectra (Figure 1 d), the OH stretching band (3000–3800 cm−1) is almost invisible in Pt/NaA, but becomes gradually pronounced as the degree of decationization increases. The external surface areas of aluminosilicate materials decreased only slightly after the amorphization compared with starting NaA samples (<20 %) because the original zeolite morphology is fully retained after the amorphization. Notably, both TEM (Figure 1 b) and EXAFS revealed that the size of the encapsulated Pt clusters remained the same (≈1.0 nm) upon the zeolite amorphization. H2 and CO chemisorptions at varied temperatures revealed that the pore size of the NaA zeolite gradually decreased with the gradual amorphization (Figure 2). Consequently, both H2 (0.29 nm) and CO (0.38 nm) can freely access to the encapsulated Pt clusters in NaA zeolites, but only small H2 can access to Pt in NaHA samples. In the case of fully decationized HA samples, even the diffusion of H2 was possible only at elevated temperatures.

As all of the zeolite encapsulated Pt catalysts allowed selective access of H2 to encapsulated Pt over various organic reactants, they can be used as ideal model catalysts for studying the catalytic functions of hydrogen spillover. For comparison, conventional Pt catalysts supported on mesoporous silica (Pt/SiO2) were also synthesized to have similar Pt cluster size (≈1 nm). Regardless of the surface area of the aluminosilicates, the Pt/NaA samples exhibited negligible catalytic activities in benzene hydrogenation and cyclohexane dehydrogenation compared with Pt/SiO2 (Figure 3 a and b). The negligible catalytic activities reveal that the catalytic contribution of hydrogen spillover is not appreciable in these materials. Our result is consistent with earlier reports showing that Pt/NaA is not active for the hydrogenation of organic molecules and hence there is no indication of the catalytic contribution of hydrogen spillover.27, 28 In contrast, the decationized samples (Pt/NaHA and Pt/HA) showed remarkably larger catalytic activities than the Pt/NaA samples in both hydrogenation and dehydrogenation (Figure 3 a and b). As proven by the H2 and CO chemisorption (Figure 2), Pt/NaHA and Pt/HA samples have less open pore structures than Pt/NaA and should impose more significant diffusion limitations for H2. Consequently, the plausible explanation for the higher activities of Pt/NaHA and Pt/HA materials than Pt/NaA is the facile migration of activated hydrogen (i.e., hydrogen spillover) to the external surface of the aluminosilicate matrix. The highest activity of Pt/NaHA among the three series of samples having different decationization degrees can be attributed to an optimal compromise between the diffusion rate of gaseous H2 and the surface migration rate of activated hydrogen (the rate of hydrogen spillover) in the aluminosilicate matrix.

Notably, all the TOR values in this work were calculated based on the total number of Pt rather than that of the surface-Pt determined by H2 or CO chemisorption at ambient temperature.

The results strongly indicate that the surface hydroxyls may play a crucial role in the migration of activated hydrogen. Our DFT calculation4 suggested that the activated hydrogen migrates via a proton relaying (similar to the Grotthuss mechanism), while an electron migrates on the zeolite surface via exchanging local bond connectivities (OH and OHO bond) to induce polaron-type conduction; therefore, the hydrogen spillover onto the non-reducible aluminosilicate becomes energetically viable (overall activation energy <1.3 eV) without involving a series of homolytic bond dissociation and formation processes (>5 eV). The calculation also suggested that Lewis acid sites at the external surface of the zeolites can act as binding sites for organic molecules.
The Pt/NaHA and Pt/HA samples showed enhanced benzene hydrogenation activities as the surface area of aluminosilicate matrix increased (Figure 3 a). Dehydrogenation of cyclohexane (Figure 3 b) also showed the same trend. In dehydrogenation, where hydrogen subtraction from organic molecules is involved instead of hydrogen addition, the catalytic activities are attributed to ‘reverse’ spillover, which corresponds to a microscopic reversibility of the hydrogen spillover phenomena.38 In both reactions, the enhanced catalytic activities for the larger surface area can be ascribed to an increased number of active sites on the support surface where spillover hydrogen can be added to or subtracted from the organic molecules.
Notably, even the Pt/NaHA and Pt/HA samples which had abundant hydroxyl groups showed almost switched-off activity for the hydrogenolysis of propane to methane and ethane (Figure 3 c). Pt/SiO2, having an open porous structure, showed markedly higher activity than these samples. As the Pt cluster sizes in the zeolite encapsulated Pt catalysts and Pt/SiO2 are comparable (≈1.0 nm), all the catalysts were expected to show similar hydrogenolysis activity if the reaction occurs on the Pt cluster surface. The present result indicates that the encapsulated Pt catalysts cannot break the CC bonds of the organic reactant. This can be explained by the fact that the encapsulated Pt catalysts do not have accessible Pt-Pt ensembles (adjacent Pt atoms) that are necessary for catalyzing hydrogenolysis reaction.39 From a practical point of view, such a selective hydro-/dehydrogenation function with suppressed hydrogenolysis activity would be highly beneficial in various industrial hydroconversions because hydrogenolysis produces light hydrocarbons of low value (e.g., CH4 and C2H6). For instance, propane dehydrogenation is an important industrial route to produce propylene and it has become more important after the worldwide discovery of wet shale gas.40 In this process, hydrogenolysis of propane is the main side reaction lowering the yield of propylene. We performed propane dehydrogenation with Pt/NaHA and Pt/SiO2 catalysts. At the same propane conversion level of 26 %, Pt/NaHA showed 90 % selectivity to propylene, which is markedly higher than that of Pt/SiO2 (63 %) due to the significantly suppressed hydrogenolysis activity.
Hydrogen spillover in silica
Nishiyama and colleagues7 reported an interesting SiO2-coated Pt nanoparticles (SP) that can act as an ideal model catalyst for studying hydrogen spillover on SiO2 support. In this work, SP was prepared using water-in-oil microemulsion according to the previous literature.41 High temperature calcination was used to densify the SiO2 shell structure and the resultant sample was further treated with aqua regia to remove non-encapsulated Pt particles. The catalysts showed accessibility only to H2 (0.29 nm) (H/Pt=0.10), but not to CO (0.38 nm) (CO/Pt=0.001) according to chemisorption experiments, which means that organic molecules larger than CO cannot access to the Pt surface. Therefore, this catalyst also belongs to an ideal model catalyst described in Scheme 1 b.
The researchers used the model catalysts for chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde that is an α,β-unsaturated aldehyde containing both CC and CO bonds in a single molecule. The selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes and ketones to unsaturated alcohols (i.e., selective CO hydrogenation) is important in the chemical industry, as well as in academia, because the unsaturated alcohols are important intermediates for perfume, pharmaceutical, and various fine chemicals.42 Unfortunately, over the group VIII metal catalysts, the undesirable product butyraldehyde (CC hydrogenation product), is mainly formed without producing crotyl alcohol (CO hydrogenation product) since the hydrogenation of the CC bond is more favorable than that of CO bond.43–45 According to the earlier study, modification of Sn to the group VIII metal catalysts can significantly enhance the selectivity toward unsaturated alcohols because Sn helps the selective adsorption and activation of CO functional groups.46 In this respect, the authors additionally supported SnOx on the surface of SP (Sn/SP) for the chemoselective hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde (Scheme 3). Analysis using EXAFS and XRD showed that Sn exists on the surface of SiO2 as forms of SnOx and does not form a bimetallic alloy with the embedded Pt particles (i.e., Sn and Pt are physically separated). The supported SnOx can be reduced at milder temperature (673 K) under H2 compared with SnOx supported on Pt-free silica (773 K). This result shows that the spilt-over hydrogen generated from the encapsulated Pt catalyst can migrate to the SnOx on the SiO2 external surface and helps Sn reduction.

In the crotonaldehyde hydrogenation reaction, both SP and Sn/SP samples showed significantly decreased catalytic activities compared with conventional Pt/SiO2 and PtSn/SiO2 catalysts (Table 1). Because all the catalysts showed similar hydrogen chemisorption values (number of H2 activation sites), the much lower catalytic activities of SP and Sn/SP samples may indicate that the hydrogen spillover process is the rate determining step in this reaction condition. SP and Pt/SiO2 showed only 0–2.4 % selectivity and even the conventional bimetallic PtSn/SiO2 catalyst showed rather limited selectivity (10 %). The authors explained that exposed Pt domains can still exist in the PtSn/SiO2 catalyst because of the incomplete alloying between Sn and Pt, which resulted in the predominant hydrogenation of the CC bond rather than the CO bond. Considering the limited selectivities of these catalysts, it is highly remarkable that Sn/SP catalyst showed exceptionally high (≈100 %) selectivity toward crotyl alcohol, which indicates the complete absence of exposed Pt surfaces to the crotonaldehyde reactant. The results also support that SnOx physically separated from Pt can selectively activate the CO bond of crotonaldehyde. Consequently, the work demonstrated the possibility of designing a highly chemoselective hydrogenation catalyst by physically separating the active sites for H2 activation (Pt) and sites for the activation of organic reactants (SnOx).

Very recently, Somorjai’s group also reported another interesting model catalyst system based on SiO2 support.6 In this work, monodisperse cobalt (Co, ≈10 nm) and Pt nanoparticles (≈12 nm) were prepared and then embedded within mesoporous SiO2 shells (Scheme 4 a). Co and Pt nanoparticles were separately embedded in the mesoporous SiO2 shells (denoted as Co@SiO2 and Pt@SiO2, respectively), or a physical mixture of Co and Pt were simultaneously embedded in the same SiO2 shell (Pt/Co@SiO2). These model catalysts were tested for CO2 hydrogenation where CO and CH4 are the major products as a result of reverse water gas shift and methanation reactions, respectively. It is notable that the pure Pt catalyst (Pt@SiO2) showed almost zero turnover rate for methanation, indicating very poor activity of Pt for methanation. On the other hand, the pure Co catalyst (Co@SiO2) showed a relatively high turnover rate for methanation (89 mol molmetal−1 h−1). It is notable that the turnover rate for methanation drastically increased up to 270 mol molmetal−1 h−1, when Pt and Co nanoparticles were co-embedded within the same SiO2 shell (Pt/Co@SiO2). The physical mixture of Pt@SiO2 and Co@SiO2 also showed a similarly enhanced turnover rate (264 mol molmetal−1 h−1) in methanation.

Such enhancement in catalytic turnover rate can be ascribed to hydrogen spillover: hydrogen atoms generated on Pt surfaces migrate over the SiO2 surface and can reduce the surface oxide formed on the Co surface generated by the CO2 dissociation step in the reaction (Scheme 4 b). Notably, the same group previously synthesized PtCo bimetallic catalysts and tested them for the same reaction.47 The bimetallic catalysts initially showed homogeneous distribution of Pt and Co within the particles, but Pt underwent surface-segregation in the reducing atmosphere of the reaction condition. The bimetallic catalysts just showed ‘Pt-like’ catalytic behavior, that is, extremely low catalytic activity on methanation. Therefore, instead of showing synergy between Pt and Co elements, the PtCo bimetallic catalysts showed deteriorated catalytic activity even compared with pure Co catalyst. The results show that blocking the intimate alloying of different metal components, while using hydrogen spillover between them is sometimes more useful for achieving better catalytic performance.
Hydrogen spillover in carbon
Our group recently designed chemoselective catalysts for the direct synthesis of H2O2 from H2/O2 mixed gas, which works via hydrogen spillover on a carbon surface.5 The major hurdle for the direct H2O2 synthesis is the existence of diverse competing reactions such as the simultaneous formation of H2O (H2 combustion), and the consecutive decomposition/hydrogenation of the produced H2O2 into H2O (Scheme 5 a). All of these competing reactions are thermodynamically more favorable than H2O2 formation, thus generally resulting in a low H2O2 production selectivity. To achieve a high catalytic selectivity towards H2O2, one clear constraint for catalyst design is that HH bonds in H2 should be activated, while OO bonds in O2 must be preserved in the course of the reaction.48 Dissociation of OO bonds in any reaction steps leads to the formation of H2O (Scheme 5 b). A major dilemma in catalyst design, however, is that the metal catalysts that dissociate HH bonds even prefer the dissociation of OO bonds thermodynamically because the metalO bond energy is stronger than the metalH bond energy.22 The addition of mineral acid with halide poisons49–51 and the alloying of inactive Au with Pd catalysts48, 52 in earlier researches may be understood as a strategy to selectively poison or block energetic active sites, which can kinetically retard OO dissociation. In our recent work,5 a new concept Pt-based catalyst was prepared, which can selectively produce H2O2 in the absence of corrosive poison additives. The key design concept is to coat the Pt/SBA-15 (mesoporous SiO2) catalyst with nanoscale amorphous carbon layers that can selectively allow the diffusion of H2 which has a small kinetic diameter (0.29 nm), over O2, which has a larger kinetic diameter (0.35 nm) (Scheme 5 c). Because H2 can diffuse through the carbon layer, it can be activated on the Pt surface and the activated hydrogen can diffuse to the outer surface of the carbon layers through hydrogen spillover. The spilt-over hydrogen can react with molecular O2 on the carbon surface without OO dissociation to selectively form H2O2.

In this work, two different carbon layers, i.e., pure carbon (C) and nitrogen-doped carbon layers (NC), were coated on the pre-synthesized Pt/SBA-15 catalyst in order to investigate the catalytic effect of hetero-atom doping on the carbon surface. The resultant samples, respectively denoted as ‘C-Pt/SBA-15’ and ‘NC-Pt/SBA-15′, showed unchanged Pt cluster size distributions (1–2 nm) after the coating with carbon layers. Chemisorptions with H2 and O2 revealed that the pristine Pt/SBA-15 showed high H/Pt (0.81) and O/Pt (0.56) values, indicating a highly accessible Pt surface for both gas titrants. After depositing the C and the NC layers, the adsorption amounts for both H2 and O2 significantly decreased. It should be noted, however, that the H/Pt ratio decreased to a still appreciable value (0.10–0.11) while the value of the O/Pt decreased to essentially zero (<0.005). This indicates that the C and NC layers act as a membrane that selectively allows the diffusion of smaller H2 (kinetic diameter: 0.29 nm) to the embedded Pt clusters, but completely blocks the diffusion of larger O2 (0.35 nm). On the basis of the present chemisorption experiments, it could be concluded that Pt/SBA-15 allowed the dissociative adsorption of both H2 and O2 while C-Pt/SBA-15 and NC-Pt/SBA-15 selectively allowed the dissociative adsorption of H2.
Pt/SBA-15 showed the fastest H2 consumption among the catalysts (Figure 4 b), but it did not produce appreciable amounts of H2O2 (Figure 4 a) because of the extremely low H2O2 selectivity (<5 %, Figure 4 c). This result indicated that a bare Pt surface that can easily dissociate OO bond produces H2O almost exclusively instead of producing H2O2. In contrast, C-Pt/SBA-15 and NC-Pt/SBA-15 showed significantly slower H2 consumption than Pt/SBA-15 due to the reduced number of H2 activation sites and also presumably due to the hindered diffusion even for H2 in the presence of the carbon coatings (Figure 4 b). Nevertheless, these two materials exhibited steady increases of H2O2 concentration (Figure 4 a) with reaction time due to the markedly enhanced H2O2 selectivity (Figure 4 c). Because the aforementioned O2 chemisorption revealed that it is impossible for O2 to access the Pt surface through the deposited carbon layers in either the CPt/SBA-15 or the NC-Pt/SBA-15 samples, the observed H2O2 production should be explained by the reaction between spilt-over hydrogen and O2 at the external surface of the carbon layers.

Direct synthesis of H2O2 over different catalysts. a) Concentration of H2O2, b) conversion of H2, and c) H2O2 selectivity. Reaction conditions: 278 K, 5.55 g H2O, 11.1 g methanol, 0.02 g catalyst, 900 rpm magnetic stirring, 3.0 MPa total pressure (H2/O2/CO2=1:10:9 by molar ratio).
NC-Pt/SBA-15 showed an H2O2 production rate superior to that of C-Pt/SBA-15 and the two catalysts exhibit similar H2 consumption rates (Figure 4 b); the difference in the overall H2O2 productivity is mainly attributed to the difference in the H2O2 selectivity (Figure 4 c). NC-Pt/SBA-15 showed a very high H2O2 selectivity of 70–98 %, while C-Pt/SBA-15 showed selectivity in the range of 35–57 %. Because both materials contained carbon layers of similar thickness (≈1.2 nm, 25 wt % carbon) and also exhibited similar H2/O2 chemisorption behaviors, the difference in H2O2 selectivity should be explained by the mechanistic difference in the reaction between the spilt-over hydrogen and O2 on the two different carbon surfaces. The DFT calculation suggested that nitrogen doping on the carbon layer could significantly increase the selectivity towards H2O2 due to the stabilization of the hydroperoxy radical (HOO.) on the carbon surface.5 When chemisorbed on the N-doped carbon surface (NC), the non-hydrogenated oxygen of HOO* can selectively react with second spilt-over hydrogen, leading to the selective production of H2O2 (Figure 5). In contrast, on the pure carbon surface (C) with no specific binding site for HOO., the second spilt-over hydrogen can stochastically react with both the non-hydrogenated oxygen and the hydrogenated oxygen of HOO., owing to the dynamic motions of the non-chemisorbed intermediate species.

Schematic representation that shows the reaction pathways for the hydrogenation of O2 to H2O2 or H2O on the NC surface. After the hydrogenation of O2 by the spilt-over hydrogen atom near the N-doped site, HOO. is adsorbed immediately on the NC surface and is further hydrogenated to produce H2O2 (blue arrow) or H2O and O* (red arrow). The chemical species adsorbed on the NC surface are denoted using an asterisk (*).
Perspectives: New Catalytic Opportunities with Encapsulated Metal Catalysts
In the earlier sections, we have seen recently reported interesting examples of encapsulated metal catalysts that were used not only for fundamental understanding of hydrogen spillover, but also for designing advanced catalysts with distinct properties. Many of the previous works on hydrogen spillover used simple probe hydrogenation reactions using olefins and aromatics as a reactant. The aforementioned examples, however, successfully demonstrated the unique possibilities of exploiting hydrogen spillover for the design of advanced hydroprocessing catalysts showing distinct chemoselectivities and enhanced activities. Based on the discussions in the former sections, the following opportunities can be highlighted for encapsulated metal catalysts if the hydrogen spillover phenomenon can be properly harnessed in the catalytic systems.
1) Generally, supported metal catalysts not only activate (dissociate) H2 during the hydrogenation reaction, but also can dissociate or isomerize other chemical bonds in the target reactant molecules (CC, CO, CN, OO, etc.). By encapsulating metal clusters in the support matrix where the target reactants cannot access them, but H2 can, the main bond arrangement of the reactants can be retained intact during the catalytic reaction. Thus, distinct chemoselectivities can be achieved, which are impossible to get with conventional supported metal catalysts. In “Hydrogen spillover in aluminosilicates” section, we have seen that Pt encapsulated in dense aluminosilicates can catalyze dehydrogenation of propane, while significantly suppressing hydrogenolysis (CC bond cleavage with H addition).4 In “Hydrogen spillover in carbon” section, we saw that the selective activation of H-H while keeping OO bond intact could lead to the selective formation of H2O2 over H2O from an H2/O2 mixture.5
2) If the metals are encapsulated in a dense support matrix that selectively allows the diffusion of H2, the reaction between target reactant and activated hydrogen should take place at the external surface of the support. This means that catalytic properties are mainly determined by the adsorption mode of the target reactants on the ‘support surface’ rather than the ‘metal surface′. Therefore, chemical modification of the support surface can lead to a dramatic change in catalytic properties. One good example is demonstrated in “Hydrogen spillover in silica” section. SnOx-modified silica surface adsorbed crotonaldehyde by using CO functional groups instead of CC, and hence led to the selective hydrogenation of CO.7 In contrast, hydrogen spillover on a pure silica surface dominantly produced products with CC bond hydrogenation. In “Hydrogen spillover in carbon” section, we also saw that N-doped carbon surface showed superior selectivity to H2O2 than pure carbon surface, because the former provides more stable binding sites for hydroperoxy radical (HOO.).5 All these examples stress the catalytic importance of support surface, where spilt-over hydrogen and target reactants react together.
3) Metal-encapsulation can significantly enhance catalyst durability. Physical stabilization by the dense support matrix can significantly increase the resistance of catalysts toward thermal sintering and metal leaching in the case of liquid-phase reactions. For instance, the Pt encapsulated in aluminosilicates discussed in “Hydrogen spillover in aluminosilicates” section (Pt/NaA Pt/NaHA, and Pt/HA) does not sinter (diameter: ≈1.0 nm) even after harsh thermal treatment at 973 K under H2 atmosphere. In contrast, conventional Pt/SiO2 showed significant sintering of Pt clusters from 1.1 to 3.1 nm.4
4) Encapsulated metal catalysts show enhanced resistance against various catalytic poisons, if the support matrix blocks the diffusion of catalyst poisons to the metal surface, while still allowing the diffusion of H2. Unless the poisons severely compete with organic reactant molecules for the active sites on the support surface, improved poison resistance can be expected during the catalytic reactions. For instance, H. Yang et al. reported that Pt encapsulated in SiO2-coated KA zeolite showed improved resistance against H2S during the hydrogenation of naphthalene.30
Although these recent works have experimentally demonstrated the catalytic consequences of hydrogen spillover and their unique applications, fundamental understanding of hydrogen spillover still remains lacking. For instance, we need more profound theoretical explanations on how atomic hydrogen can migrate, and what the nature of binding site is for the target reactants on each different type of support. On the basis of in-depth understanding of individual systems, establishing the ‘if’ and ‘only if’ conditions for enabling hydrogen spillover would be an ultimate quest for experimentalist and theorists, which should be challenged by intensive collaborations. If we are able to answer those questions, the controversy around hydrogen spillover will be gradually weakened and we can also better use the phenomenon in the design of advanced hydroprocessing catalysts.
