Kinetics of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and ethane on VOx/SiO2 pure and with potassium additive
Abstract
Application of Eley–Rideal steady-state model (ER-SSAM) for the description of oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane/propane over vanadia-silica catalyst doped by potassium and undoped, using an extensive set of the experimental data was studied. It has been shown for a broad range of feed mixture, contact time and temperature that the model which take into account the adsorption of water on the surface (ER-SSAM II) of the catalysts describes more adequately (less fitting error) the kinetics of the studied reaction than the model, which neglects this effect. Kinetic constants (activation energies, pre-exponential factors) for both applied models of ODH reaction of ethane/propane on these catalysts, obtained on the bases of steady-state results, are given. Potassium exhibits strong inhibitory effect on the consecutive propene and parallel propane combustion and has lower influence on ethene and ethane combustion. The secondary combustion is the main source of carbon oxides in studied reaction and potassium additive modifies the catalytic properties of these catalysts by blocking active centers on the surface of the catalysts (decreasing pre-exponential factors). The re-oxidation rate constant for doped and undoped catalyst is almost not influenced by potassium addition.
1. Introduction
The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes has been receiving increasing attention because of the potential benefits of using these relatively plentiful and inexpensive raw materials to produce chemicals. The primary advantage of the ODH reaction, as opposed to direct dehydrogenation, is that the deactivation of the catalyst can be avoided because the presence of oxygen prevents the accumulation of carbonaceous deposit on the catalyst surface, and hence necessity of the catalyst regeneration [1], [2], [3]. The ODH reaction permits also to avoid such inconveniences of as low equilibrium constants and the endothermicity of nonoxidative dehydrogenation.
Ethane has received the least attention, principally because of the existence of an attractive route to ethylene by nonoxidative cracking [4]. However, ethane is an abundant component in natural gas and is the primary product of methane conversion by oxidative coupling [5] and its conversion to ethene is important task. In the case of the ODH of propane, the main objective is to replace more expensive propene feedstock from steam cracking and catalytic dehydrogenation.
Much research is concentrated on vanadium-oxide-based catalysts because these they have been found promising for oxidative dehydrogenation, ODH of lower alkanes, in particular of ethane [6], propane [7] and butane [8].
Catalytic properties of oxide catalysts can be improved by introduction of additives. In the review [9], the variety of effect of the additives on structure, physicochemical and catalytic properties of oxide catalysts in selective oxidation reaction was demonstrated.
For the ODH reactions of lower alkanes, alkali metal additives have been found to improve the selectivity to propene in the ODH of propane on V2O5/TiO2, MoO3/TiO2 [10], [11], V2O5/Al2O3 [12] and MoO3/MgO-γ-Al2O3 [13] catalysts, the effect being explained by modification of acid–base properties of the catalysts by alkalis. A limited amount of work has been already reported on kinetics of ODH of ethane [6], [14]. The kinetic model of ODH of ethane on 7% V2O5/SiO2 has been proposed by Oyama et al. [6]. However, this model is based on the experimental data obtained in differential conditions (low conversions of ethane). The kinetic expressions derived on the basis of the proposed reaction sequence do not describe appropriately the dependence of the rate of ethene and acetaldehyde formation on oxygen partial pressure. Moreover, determining the rate constants from proposed kinetic network, the authors neglected the influence of oxygen partial pressure on the rates of the particular product formation. Another model for ODH of ethane on alumina-supported vanadia catalyst was proposed in [14]. In this paper, the authors proposed consecutive–parallel scheme for description of ethane ODH reactions. On the basis of the experimental data, which were obtained for low conversions of ethane (below 2%), they determined temperature and vanadia surface density dependence of the ratio of the sum of the rate constants for consecutive combustion of ethene and parallel combustion of ethane to formation of ethene.
The different aspects of the mechanism and kinetics of the ODH of propane were studied for different mixed oxide systems generally based on vanadium like V2O5/AlPO4 [15], V2O5/ZrO2 [16], V2O5/TiO2 [17], V/γ-Al2O3 [18], Mg-V-Sb-O [19] and V-Mg-O [20]. In ref. [16], the authors showed on the basis of kinetic isotopic effect that the methylene–CH bond is activated in the rate-determining step for the propane dehydrogenation and combustion reaction. The kinetic studies of the ODH of propane on Mg-V-Sb-O [19] catalyst showed that nucleophyllic oxygen of the catalyst is involved in the formation of propene and adsorbed electrophyllic oxygen is responsible for the total oxidation of propane and propene. Bottino et al. [18] studied kinetics of ODH of propane applying two different approaches. In the first one, power law expressions were used to describe the network of reactions involving propane, propene, CO and CO2. In the second approach, the experimental data were fitted with a rate equation obtained by assuming that molecular oxygen re-oxidizes the active site reduced by the surface reaction. Similar studies were done for the V-Mg-O catalyst [20]. The authors tried three different models of the ODH of propane reaction (the power model and the models of Langmuir–Hinshelwood and of Mars van Krevelen). However, the fitting errors for all these models were practically the same (e.g. 7.5%) and it was difficult to distinguish which was the best one. In our opinion, there are two reasons for such results. The first is a small range of the propane conversions and the second is a simplified (only consecutive) kinetic network, used by the authors in their calculations.
In the present work, kinetics of propane and ethane ODH on V2O5/SiO2 pure and with the potassium additive was studied. The model applied here is based on the parallel consecutive kinetic network (1) and the experimental kinetic data cover a broad range of the propane/ethane conversions and selectivities to propene/ethene, CO and CO2.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts
The 1.5 monolayer (mnl.) VOx/SiO2 (VSiO) catalysts containing normally 1.5 mnl. of vanadia was prepared by impregnation with aqueous solution of ammonium metavanadate of a commercial silica support (Aerosil 200), evaporation of water, followed by drying for 12 h at 120 °C and calcinations under a flow of air for 5 h at 500 °C. The vanadium content was such that it corresponded 1.5 monolayer of vanadia phase (1.5 × 1019 V/m2). Before impregnation, the support was pre-treated in water at room temperature and dried at 90 °C for 12h: its specific surface area after such treatment was 175 m2/g. The additive was introduced by adding appropriate amounts of their soluble salt (KNO3) to the metavanadate solution. All the reactants used were of p.p.a. grade. The atomic ratio K/V in the calcined catalyst was 0.1. The K/V ratio of 0.1 was shown in previous studies as optimal for VSiO catalysts [21], the selectivity to propene decreasing slightly at higher K content. For the VSiO catalyst, the specific surface area of the catalysts, was lower (117 m2/g) than that of the pure SiO2 support (175 m2/g). The presence of the potassium led to the further decrease of specific surface area (92 m2/g). For the given specific surface area of SiO2, 1.5 mnl. VSiO and KVSiO catalyst contained 28.4 and 28.0 wt.% of V2O5, respectively.
2.2. Catalytic activity measurements
The kinetic experiments in ODH of ethane/propane were performed in a fixed bed flow apparatus. Details of experimental conditions are presented in Table 1. A stainless steel reactor (120 mm long, i.d. 13 mm) was coupled directly to a series of gas chromatographs. Conversion of ethane/propane and selectivities to the particular products was determined as a function of the temperature, feed mixture composition and contact time. The composition of the reaction mixture was controlled with the mass flowmeters. It has been checked in the preliminary experiments, in which the mass and the grain size of a catalyst sample were varied, that under these conditions, the transport phenomena do not limit the reaction rate. Thiele module estimated for temperature reaction over 700 K was equal 0.1–0.5, what practically exclude diffusion as limiting step for overall reaction. Temperature of the reaction was controlled and measured by Eurotherm Controller 2404 with accuracy ±1°. Two thermocouples were used (one inside and the second at the end the catalyst bed) and as the temperature inside of catalyst bed was taken as the reaction temperature. The temperature difference between these two thermocouples was ≤2 K. Ethene/propene and carbon oxides (CO and CO2) were found to be main reaction products. The amounts of the degradation, C2 products and of oxygenates (aldehydes and acids) were below 1% of the total amount of products. 0.5 ml (for propane) and 1 ml (for ethane) of a catalyst sample of grain size 0.63–1 mm diluted with quartz beads was used. The carbon balance for conversions higher than about 10% was better than 97 ± 2%. At lower conversions, the balance was poorer, and hence the selectivities to different products were calculated from the formula:
, where Ci are concentrations of products i. The total conversion Xp was calculated as:
where
and Cp are the concentrations of propane at the inlet and outlet of the reactor, respectively.

3. Results and discussion
The experimental data used for calculations were obtained for the 1.5 mnl. VSiO and 1.5 mnl. VKSiO catalysts in the integral reactor (0 < Xp < 0.25), which made possible the calculation of the particular rate constants using a broad range of the independent variables (concentrations of alkane (propane/ethane), temperature of the reaction and contact time). The experimental results for ODH of propane/ethane obtained for each catalyst are collected in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5. The data obtained for the 1.5 mnl. VSiO catalysts, pure and promoted with potassium, have shown that the increase in the conversion of alkane with the increasing temperature is accompanied by a considerable decrease in the selectivity to alkene (ethene/propene) Sπ, and at the same time, a parallel increase in the selectivity to CO, SCO and a smaller increase to CO2. Carbon oxides (COx = CO + CO2) are however observed in some amounts also at low conversions. Such a course of changes implies a parallel consecutive network of the formation of carbon oxides from propene, behaviour typical of selective oxidation reactions of hydrocarbons on oxide catalysts.

Fig. 1 exemplifies typical changes of propane/ethane – the conversion and the selectivity to propene/ethene and COx – as a function of contact time for given temperature and feed mixture composition for doped and undoped catalyst. It is also evident from Fig. 1 that the extrapolation for τ = 0, which is equivalent to X = 0, gives the initial selectivity to alkene,
and
. This implies that part of the combustion products is formed directly from alkane according to the scheme (1). As it was shown in [22], the most appropriate model is based on the assumption that the alkane is not adsorbed at the catalyst surface and reacts directly from the gas phase (Eley–Rideal type mechanism). If one assume that the ODH of alkane (propane) proceeds through the following individual steps.

and re-oxidation of the surface of the catalyst by gaseous oxygen can be described by

where Vo and Os denote oxygen vacancy and surface oxygen species on the surface of the catalyst, respectively. It is obvious that none of these reactions is an elementary reaction. Therefore, one must assume the appropriate reaction orders on the experimental basis.

Fig. 1. Conversion and selectivity in the ODH of ethane/propane over VSiO and KVSiO (A and B) for the ODH of propane at 753 and 653 K over the KVSIO and VSiO catalysts, respectively, (C and D) for the ODH of ethane at 753 K over the KVSIO and VSiO catalysts, respectively. Lines, calculated results for the ER-SSAM II model; points, experimental results for propane/ethane: (■) conversion of ethane/propane, (▴) selectivity to ethene/propene and (●) selectivity to COx.
In our first model (ER-SSAM I) presented in [22], which is based on Eley–Rideal mechanism, hydrocarbon reacts directly from the gaseous phase with the surface oxygen of the catalyst and the reaction products desorbs quickly and the surface of the catalysts is not blocked. This assumption is reflected in Eqs. (2)–(4) and all these reactions are assumed to be the first order with respect to the hydrocarbon concentration in the gas phase. As it was argued in ref. [22], the selective pathway of alkane ODH should be favoured by an interaction of alkane molecule oriented perpendicularly to surface with a single oxygen atom Os, whereas alkane (alkene) combustion is favoured by parallel hydrocarbon configuration and concurrent interaction with several oxygen atoms Os. This differences in orientation with respect to the surface imply the first order with respect to the oxygen surface coverage (θs) of the catalyst and higher (the second) for the combustion reactions (3) and (4). As it was shown in ref. [23], the oxygen dissociation is slow and then the rate is proportional to
. In Eq. (5), the opposite reaction, e.g. desorption of oxygen is not taken into consideration, because as it comes out of from our earlier results [24], this process is not occurring in the temperature range of the catalytic reaction. Taking into account, the above conclusion, one can calculate the steady-state oxygen coverage (θs) of the catalyst surface for ODH of propane.
(6)
where
, Cp and Cπ are concentrations of oxygen, propane and propene, respectively, and x is oxygen/carbon ratio. In Eq. (6), the coefficients at the rate constants reflect the reaction stoichiometry. At the steady-state conditions, dθs/dt should be equal zero, which leads to an algebraic equation, which should be solved in relation to θs.
The literature data [6] show that in the case of ODH of ethane on VOx/SiO2 water plays important role. In our second model (ER-SSAM II) presented in this paper, an influence of the adsorbed water was taken into account by assuming that water, which is formed in the reactions (2)–(4) is adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst (θW). At the steady-state conditions adsorbed water desorbs to the gaseous phase (kDW). In the case of ODH of propane, these assumptions leads to the next system of equations:
(7)
(8)
Adsorption of water, θW changes the conversion of propane/ethane and the selectivities to the particular products only by the modification of θs; solutions for θs of Eqs. (7) and (8) are different than Eq. (6).
The set of differential equations describing propane, propene and COx concentrations in the gas phase for both models can be written as:
Concentration of propane
(9)
Concentration of propene
(10)
Concentration of COx
(11)
Similar models can be constructed for ODH of ethane. The reaction steps for ethane ODH will be the same as for propane, but the particular equations will be different, in regard to the different stoichiometry of these reactions.
The integration of differential Eqs. (9)–(11) for above described models (ER-SSAM I and II) using the values of the surface coverages obtained by solution of algebraic Eq. (6) for ER-SSAM I or Eqs. (7) and (8) for ER-SSAM II model and the minimization of the object function defined as a sum of squared differences of experimental and calculated selectivities and conversions, were performed using Runge–Kutta and Marquardt methods in a program written in BASIC.
Table 6, Table 7 give the calculated values of pre-exponential factors and the activation energies for the different reaction steps for ODH of propane and ethane, obtained by the fitting of the above described models to the experimental data for both catalysts. It is evident from these tables that potassium additive leads to the decrease of the pre-exponential factors, but activation energies are practically not changed. The comparison of the results of approximate lack of fit test, which are given in these tables, with the appropriate tabulated F value revealed no lack of fit of both models. The both models described the experimental data in the broad range of temperature and feed mixture composition for doped and undoped VSiO catalyst. The ER-SSAM I and II models, in accordance with the experiments, fulfill the initial conditions, e.g. they expect correctly the values of the initial selectivity for conversion of alkane X > 0, but next discussion on account of the less fitting errors will be carry on the basis of the results of ER-SSAM II model (model ER-SSAM II in Table 6, Table 7).

The kinetic model (ER-SSAM II) in which influence of water on the course of the propane/ethane ODH reaction is taken into consideration describes the experimental results better than model ER-SSAM I. The differences between these two models are rather small, because the calculated water coverage (θW) are small and does not exceed ∼3%. This coverage is higher for propane than for ethane ODH over doped and undoped catalyst. The same is observed for the surface reduction degree, which is proportional to the surface concentration of vacancies (θV). For ODH of ethane, influence of potassium additive is little, while in the case of ODH of propane K addition leads to the increase of the surface reduction degree and to the decrease of the surface coverage by adsorbed water. The experiments, which have been carried out with the using of vacuum microbalance, showed that adsorption of water (at 673 K) on these catalysts is small and experimentally determined water surface coverage is about 2% in relation to BET surface.
The temperature dependence of the catalyst re-oxidation rate constant,
is shown in Fig. 2a. As can be seen from this figure, in the case of ODH of propane and ethane, an addition of potassium to VSiO catalyst decrease a little the re-oxidation of the catalyst. The different picture (Fig. 2b) is observed for the temperature dependence of
/(k1 + k2 + k3) ratio. This ratio reflects the rate of the catalyst re-oxidation to the rate of oxygen consumption in the reactions of alkene formation and parallel and consecutive COx formation and a measure of the reduction degree of the catalyst surface. In the case of ODH of ethane, addition of potassium leads to about two-fold decrease of this ratio, whereas for propane, this ratio is lower and potassium additive practically has no influence on the reduction degree of the catalysts.

In Fig. 2c, the influence of potassium on changes of the ratio of selective reaction (k1, formation of alkene) to the parallel oxidation (k3, combustion of alkane) as a function of temperature is shown. As come out from this figure, in the case of ODH of ethane potassium, additive changes a little k1/k3 ratio, but for propane, this ratio increases about 20 times what can be interpreted as practical elimination of parallel path of propane combustion, and in consequence leads to the high initial selectivity (∼95%). The contribution of parallel and consecutive path (k2/k3 ratio) in total oxidation of propane/ethane is shown in the Fig. 2d. As it comes out from this figure, in the case of ODH of ethane, the contribution of parallel path of ethane combustion is higher than in the case of propane and potassium additive practically does not change this state. On the other hand for propane, potassium strongly decreases contribution of parallel path (combustion of propane) and the formation of COx proceeds mainly as consecutive propene combustion.
It seems understandable because SiO2 support is acidic and introduction of alkali metal to the catalyst leads to the decrease of the interaction of the basic molecule of propene with the catalyst surface. This in turn facilitate its desorption from surface simultaneously increasing selectivity to propene. As it is known, propene is more basic than ethene molecule, because of the hyperconjugation effect (no bond resonance), which increases electron density on π-double bond of propene. For ethene molecule, such effect does not exist and as a consequence, propene is more sensible on the changes of the surface basicity what can be observed as a much stronger influence of potassium additive on selectivity to propene.
4. Conclusions
(1)
The studied models describe correctly the experimental results for ODH of propane/ethane within the broad range of temperature and feed mixture composition for doped and undoped VSiO catalyst, but the model which considers the influence of adsorbed water (ER-SSAM II) describes better the course of propane/ethane ODH reaction.
(2)
Potassium does not change the selectivity to ethene, but has distinct influence on the selectivity to propene.
(3)
In the case of ODH of ethane, potassium additive does not change k1/k3 ratio, which is the measure of the parallel combustion, while in the case of propane, this ratio increases about 20 times and for potassium-doped catalyst parallel path of propane oxidation to COx is practically eliminated.
(4)
Consecutive combustion of propene/ethene is influenced by potassium additive mainly by the decrease of the pre-exponential factor of (k2)—for ethene about 2 times and for propene about 15 times. For ODH of propane, k2/k3 ratio is very high for doped KVSiO catalyst (because of low value of k3) and decrease with K addition, whereas for ethane, this ratio is lower and is practically independent of K addition.
(5)
Addition of potassium to VSiO catalyst has little influence on the re-oxidation rate constant (
) for both studied catalyst and alkanes, but in the case of ODH of ethane potassium, additive increase in some extent surface reduction degree.
