A Mechanistic Study of Dehydrogenation of Propane over Vanadia–Titania Catalysts
Abstract
The oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over a monolayer V2O5/TiO2 catalyst was examined using in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and pseudo in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). It was found that the freshly calcined catalyst contains vanadium in the V5+ state; however, its treatment in the propane flow leads to the reduction of V5+ to V3+. Simultaneously, the catalyst treatment in propane leads to the formation of Ti–O–H groups, the removal of vanadyl oxygen species, and accumulation of carbonaceous deposits. Besides, XPS data indicate that the reduction of catalyst is accompanied by reversible destruction of the vanadia monolayer and formation of 3D clusters or nanoparticles on the titania surface, which leads to catalyst deactivation. In contrast, under the action of a propane/oxygen mixture flow, the accumulation of carbonaceous deposits and the destruction of the vanadia monolayer do not proceed. In this case, V5+ cations are partially reduced to V4+, and the catalyst surface contains isopropoxide, acetone, formate, acetate, and carbonate species. We suggest that the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over vanadium oxide-based catalysts proceeds via the redox mechanism, where the oxidized catalyst surface oxidizes propane and is reoxidized by gas-phase oxygen. The active sites contain V5+ cations, and the C–H bond of propane is activated preferentially on vanadyl oxygen species. The key intermediate is isopropoxide, which can transform to propylene or acetone. Adsorbed acetone is unstable and oxidized further to formate and acetate species, which could be oxidized to CO and CO2. In contrast, the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane proceeds over the reduced catalyst. In this case, active sites contain V3+ cations. The mechanisms of both reactions are discussed.

Propylene is an important starting product used in the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylic acid, cumene, etc. The main part of propylene is manufactured as a byproduct of oil refining and natural gas processing, and only a small part of propylene is produced by the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. Nowadays, this process is commercially carried out mainly with the use of catalysts based on chromium oxide or platinum. However, these catalysts are quickly deactivated under reaction conditions because of coke formation and sintering of the metal phase. (1−3) Moreover, the high cost of platinum and serious pollution issues caused by chromium restrict the further development of the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) industry. One of the potential alternatives to the conventional catalysts is supported catalysts based on vanadium oxide, which have reasonable cost and are environmental friendly. (2,4−8) As shown by Sokolov et al., (2) some vanadium oxide-based catalysts demonstrate the catalytic performance in PDH that is even better than the catalysts based on chromium oxide. This confirms the promise of vanadia catalysts for industrial applications.
Numerous theoretical and experimental studies have been devoted to the investigation of vanadium oxide-based catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation. The review of the most important results can be found elsewhere. (9) For example, it has been shown that the propane conversion and propylene yield depend on the support material; (4) however, the cause of this effect and the origin of active species are not clear yet. Several authors claim that the most active species for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation are two-dimensional polymeric species containing V3+ or V4+ (or both), whereas supported V2O5 crystallites are practically inactive; isolated vanadia species are also active but susceptible to the deactivation due to coke formation (see ref (9) and references therein). In contrast, in the presence of oxygen, the dehydrogenation proceeds via the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, and V5+ species have been proposed as the active sites. (10−12)
The aim of this work was to further explore the chemical state of vanadium cations in the oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and identify the main reaction intermediates, active sites, and reasons for the catalyst deactivation. For this purpose, we studied the non-oxidative dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over a V2O5/TiO2 catalyst using pseudo in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) at atmospheric pressure. Because propane conversion and propylene yield increase with vanadia loading up to some limit when only highly dispersed VOx species exist on the catalyst surface, (2,4,5) we performed our experiments using a so-called “monolayer” V2O5/TiO2 catalyst, (13,14) which contains mainly surface polymeric vanadia species with the concentration corresponding to the theoretical monolayer (1 ML).

The monolayer V2O5/TiO2 catalyst was prepared via a two-step procedure. First, a TiO2 support (anatase, 350 m2/g) was impregnated with an aqueous solution of vanadyl oxalate via the incipient-wetness impregnation method and then dried at 110 °C for 12 h and calcined in air at 400 °C for 4 h. According to the chemical analysis, the catalyst consisted of 20 wt % V2O5. X-ray diffraction (XRD), FTIR, and Raman spectroscopy showed that the catalyst contained both polymeric surface vanadia species and supported V2O5 crystallites. (13,15) At the second step of the catalyst preparation, the V2O5 crystallites were selectively removed by treating the catalyst in a 10% aqueous solution of nitric acid at room temperature. After the washing, the catalyst (12.5 wt % V2O5 and 87.5 wt % TiO2) was calcined in a flow of air at 400 °C for 4 h. After that, no vanadia crystallites were detected in the catalyst by XRD and Raman spectroscopy, indicating the absence of amorphous V2O5 nanoparticles. (15) The specific area of the catalyst is 115 m2/g. Taking into account that 1 ML corresponds to 7.9 V atom/nm2, the surface vanadia coverage equal to 0.9 ML. (13) It should be noted that the isolated, monomeric vanadia species dominated on the titania surface when the vanadia concentration does not exceed 10% of monolayer, whereas polymeric structures such as chains, ribbons, or 2D islands of VOx units with an octahedral coordination appear at the vanadia concentration above 20% of monolayer (see ref (13) and references therein). Therefore, vanadia exists in the catalyst, mainly as two-dimensional polymeric species that agree well with FTIR. (13)
The XPS measurements were performed using a photoelectron spectrometer (SPECS Surface Nano Analysis GmbH, Germany) equipped with a PHOIBOS-150 hemispherical electron energy analyzer, a FOCUS-500 X-ray monochromator, and an XR-50 X-ray source with a double Al/Ag anode. The based pressure in the analytical chamber was approximately 10–8 mbar. The spectrometer was also equipped with a high-pressure cell with a volume of approximately 1 L, where the sample could be treated with specific gases at pressures up to 0.5 MPa and heated to 420 °C. Two hundred milligrams of the sample was pressed into a thin self-supporting wafer with a diameter of 8 mm and a thickness of 1 mm and placed into the high-pressure cell. The catalyst was treated under the flow of O2, propane, or equimolar mixture of propane and oxygen at atmospheric pressure. The gas flows were controlled by mass-flow controllers (SEC Z500, Horiba STEC Ltd., Japan); the total flow rate was 50 sccm. The core-level spectra were obtained in the analysis chamber using the monochromatic Al Kα radiation under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. The charge shift was corrected by setting the Ti2p3/2 peak at 459.0 eV. (13,14) Curve fitting was done by the CasaXPS software. The line shape used in the fit was a sum of Lorentzian and Gaussian functions. A Shirley-type background was subtracted from each spectrum. Relative element concentrations were determined from the integral intensities of the core-level spectra using the theoretical photoionization cross sections according to Scofield. (16)
To identify reaction intermediates involved in the dehydrogenation of propane, in situ FTIR measurements were performed using a Cary 660 FTIR spectrometer (Agilent Technologies) in the transmission mode. The spectrometer was equipped with a custom-made quartz cell reactor with NaCl windows. The volume of the cell reactor was approximately 1.5 cm3. The cell reactor could be heated in an oven with the temperature controlled with a K-type thermocouple. The catalyst powder was pressed into a thin self-supporting pellet (15 mg/cm2, 1 cm × 3 cm in size) and placed into the cell reactor. The in situ FTIR experiments were performed at atmospheric pressure within the temperature range of 150–350 °C under a flow of pure propane, air, or a gas mixture containing 6% C3H8, 6% O2, and 88% Ar. The flow rate was 120 sccm. The FTIR spectra were recorded in the range of 1000–4000 cm–1 with the spectral resolution of 4 cm–1. The time scale of the spectra was approximately 40 s. Before the experiments, the catalyst was treated in the flow of air at 350 °C for 1 h. After that, the catalyst was cooled stepwise, and the reference spectra were recorded at 350, 300, 250, 200, and 150 °C.
To determine the catalytic performance, we analyzed the gas phase at the outlet of the cell reactor using FTIR. In these experiments, a custom-made gas cell with the optical path length of approximately 70 mm was connected to the outlet of the cell reactor. The spectra of the gas phase were recorded using the same Cary 660 FTIR spectrometer. Bands at 912 cm–1 (Q branch of the C–C stretching mode), 1471 cm–1 (Q branch of the CH3 deformation mode), 2172 cm–1 (P branch of the C═O stretching mode), and 2360 cm–1 (P branch of ν(CO2) mode) were used for the detection of propylene, propane, CO, and CO2 in the gas phase, respectively. To estimate the conversion of propane, we compared the absorbance spectra in the range between 1550 and 1300 cm–1 obtained at 25 °C and at higher temperatures. We believed that, at 25 °C, the propane conversion was zero, and an increase in the reaction temperature led to a decrease in the concentration of propane due to consumption. The attenuation of absorbance is proportional to the conversion of propane. The selectivity toward propylene, CO, and CO2 was calculated in accordance with the amount of converted propane, taking into account stoichiometric coefficients of individual reactions and extinction coefficients. The extinction coefficients were determined in the additional experiments with pure gases. Both procedures are described in detail in the Supporting Information.

3.1. In Situ FTIR Study
In the first series of experiments, the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst was treated with the flow of 100% propane, and the FTIR spectra were acquired during the stepwise heating from 150 to 200, 250, 300, and 350 °C. A set of spectra was recorded at each temperature during 15 min, then the propane flow was replaced by the air flow, and a new set of spectra was recorded during 15 min. After that, the catalyst was heated to the next temperature, the air flow was replaced by the propane flow, and FTIR measurements were continued. The reference spectrum of the catalyst obtained at the same temperature in air was subtracted from each raw IR spectrum.
The typical difference spectra of the catalyst in the propane flow are presented in Figure 1a,b. As seen, the first spectrum, which was obtained at 150 °C after 10 min in the propane flow, contains two wide bands between 2800 and 3050 cm–1 and between 1300 and 1600 cm–1 due to the absorbance of gas-phase propane. There are also two other bands: a negative signal near 3657 cm–1 due to the removal of surface OH groups and a weak positive signal at 3603 cm–1 due to the formation of a hydrogen-bonded complex of the surface hydroxyl group with a very weak base, probably propane. A hypothesized structure of this complex is presented in Figure 2 (complex 1). The formation of such surface complex leads to the activation of the propane molecule, making it electron-deficient, that is, creating a positive charge on the carbon atom of the methylene group. Because the spectrum contains a negative signal at 2041 cm–1 (Figure 1b), which coincides with the first overtone of the ν(V═O) stretching mode of terminal vanadyl groups, (14,17) we can speculate that not only surface hydroxyl groups but also oxygen of the terminal vanadyl groups is involved in the activation of propane. This means that propane could be activated via two different mechanisms: over surface V–OH groups, in which the proton (H+) is capable of accepting an electron pair from a Lewis base, or over oxygen atoms of the terminal vanadyl groups, which have a filled orbital containing an electron pair that is not involved in bonding but may form a dative bond with a Lewis acid. It should be noted that the negative signal at 2041 cm–1 is observed in all spectra, indicating that the vanadyl groups react with propane in the whole temperature range (Figure 1b).

Two minutes after the introduction of propane into the cell reactor with the catalyst, a sharp band at 1133 cm–1 appears in the IR spectrum, and its intensity increases markedly with time. According to the literature, (18) this band corresponds to the skeletal vibrations of adsorbed isopropoxy groups. Simultaneously, there appears a sharp band at 1679 cm–1, which can be attributed to the ν(C═O) stretching mode of adsorbed acetone. (18−21) Indeed, Griffiths and Rochester (19) observed the band at 1670 cm–1 after adsorption of acetone on rutile and assigned this vibration to acetone molecules coordinatively bound to Lewis acidic surface sites. The structure of this adsorbed complex is also presented in Figure 2 (complex 2). Certainly, acetone is a product of the oxidation of isopropoxide. The bands of acetone and isopropoxide are clearly observed in the spectrum obtained at 150 °C after 10 min in the propane flow. At the same time, adsorbed propanol, which is characterized by the typical O–H deformation band near 1290 cm–1, (20) was not detected by FTIR.
The subsequent increase in the temperature to 200 °C does not lead to any significant increase in the signal of the adsorbed isopropoxy groups (Figure 1a). The band of adsorbed acetone is observed only during the first few minutes after setting the propane flow, and then there appear the bands of formate and acetate species, which are the products of the oxidation of adsorbed acetone (reaction 1). (21) One can also see two strong bands at 1565 and 1546 cm–1 and two weak bands near 1444 and 1367 cm–1 that can be attributed to the vibrations of carboxylate groups. Taking into account the literature data, the band at 1565 cm–1 and overlapping bands at 1374 and 1360 cm–1 can be assigned to the νas(COO), ν(CH), and νs(COO) vibration modes of bidentate formate ions, respectively. (22,23) The bands at 1546 and 1444 cm–1 can be assigned to the νas(COO) and νs(COO) vibration modes of acetate ions, respectively. (14,21) The weak bands at 1621 and 1281 cm–1 can be attributed to the ν(C═C) and δ(C═C—H) vibration modes of acrylate species. (20) The vibrational mode assignment is presented in Table 1.

The further increase in the temperature leads to an increase in the background of the spectra, which indicates the reduction of the catalyst. Indeed, the reduction leads to formation of heterogeneity of electron density that affects the refractive index. Simultaneously, a new weak band in the hydroxyl region near 3670 cm–1 is observed. We attribute this band to Ti–OH groups. (25) This band is also observed in the spectrum of bare TiO2 (Figure S1). The bands of acetone and acrylate disappear, whereas the ν(COO) bands increase and shift. For example, there are two strong bands at 1533 and 1441 cm–1 in the spectra at 300 °C (Figure 1a). We associate this effect with the formation of carbonate species. Recently, a similar effect has been observed in the oxidation of ethanol over the monolayer V2O5/TiO2 catalyst. Because the shift of the ν(COO) bands was accompanied by the disappearance of the bands of the C–H stretching vibrations of CH3 groups, we concluded that acetate species are transformed to carbonates above 200 °C. (14)
To identify adsorbed species with the methyl and methylene groups and adsorbed formate and acetate ions, one should analyze the spectra obtained without propane in the gas phase. Figure 3a shows a series of spectra obtained at 200 °C after a quick replacement of propane with air. One can see that the spectrum recorded after 1 min contains several bands in the range of 2800–3000 cm–1, which correspond to the C–H stretching vibrations of CH3 and CH2 groups in the products of propylene oligomerization. Their total intensity does not depend on the temperature during the treatment in the propane flow. These carbonaceous species can block active sites, leading to the catalyst deactivation. At the same time, the carbonaceous species are reactive toward oxygen and slowly removed from the surface under the air flow even at 150 °C. Simultaneously, the vanadyl species are restored due to reoxidation of vanadium (Figure 3b).
Figure 3
Figure 3. (a) Difference FTIR spectra of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst obtained in situ at 200 °C after 1, 3, 5, and 10 min in the air flow. Before that, the catalyst was treated for 15 min in the propane flow at 200 °C. The lowest spectrum was obtained after the treatment in the propane flow at 250 °C for 15 min and then in air at 250 °C for 10 min. (b) Evolution of the vanadyl band (all spectra multiplied by 10).
The spectra presented in Figure 3a clearly indicate that both formate and acetate ions are formed on the catalyst surface under the propane flow at 200 °C. Indeed, all the spectra contain characteristic bands at 1551, 1373, and 1360 cm–1 that can be attributed to the νas(COO), ν(CH), and νs(COO) vibration modes of bidentate formate ions, respectively. (13,22,23) Besides, all the spectra exhibit a band at 1440 cm–1 that can be assigned to the νs(COO) band of acetate ions. (14,21,24) Two extra bands at 1620 and 1279 cm–1 correspond to the ν(C═C) and δ(C═C—H) vibration modes of acrylate species, respectively. (20) The band at 1133 cm–1 corresponds to the skeletal vibrations of isopropoxide. (18,24) The first spectrum obtained at 200 °C also contains several strong bands in the range 3050–2800 cm–1, which mainly correspond to the C–H stretching vibrations of CH3 and CH2 groups of the adsorbed products of propylene oligomerization. All these bands decrease with time under the air flow. The acetate complexes are stable at least at 200 °C because the band at 1440 cm–1 does not decrease. In contrast, the formate complexes decompose fast, which leads to a decrease in the bands at 1373 and 1360 cm–1. Besides, the strongest band at 1551 cm–1 is broadening and shifting to 1538 cm–1, which indicates the transformation of formate and acetate to carbonates (Figure 3a).
For comparison, Figure 3a also demonstrates the spectrum obtained in situ after the treatment in the propane flow at 250 °C for 15 min and then in the air flow for 10 min. As seen, this spectrum also contains several weak bands in the range of 3050–2800 cm–1 that correspond to the C–H stretching vibrations of CH3 and CH2 groups of the adsorbed products of propylene oligomerization. Two bands at 1520 and 1432 cm–1 are located in the carboxyl vibration range, indicating that this temperature is high enough for the transformation of acetate species to carbonate species. The same bands are observed at 300 and 350 °C (spectra not shown), which means that carbonates are the main surface species at high temperatures.
In the gas phase, we detected strong signals of propane (Figure S2) and very weak signals of propylene, CO, and CO2 (Figure S3). According to the spectra, the transformation of propane started at 250 °C, the yield of propylene and CO2 increased with temperature, and the yield of CO had a maximum near 300 °C (Figure 4). The propane conversion achieved only 0.02%, while the selectivity toward propylene was approximately 90%. These findings agree well with the data presented in Figure 1a. Indeed, it is generally accepted that the direct dehydrogenation of alkanes is a three-step reaction consisting of two consecutive C–H activation steps and a final step of desorption of hydrogen and propylene from the catalyst surface. At that, the main reaction intermediate is isopropoxide. (26,27) In agreement with this reaction scheme, we observed the appearance of propylene in the gas phase at 250 °C and a simultaneous decrease in the bands at 1133 cm–1 corresponding to adsorbed isopropoxide species (Figure 1a). We believe that CO is a product of the decomposition of formate and acetate species, whereas CO2 is formed mainly from carbonates. (22,23) Because formate and acetate species have low thermal stability and are not observed on the catalyst surface at 300 °C due to decomposition and transformation to carbonates (Figure 1a), the CO yield at this temperature starts to decrease.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Concentrations of the main gaseous products: propylene, CO, and CO2 as functions of temperature in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over V2O5/TiO2.
In the second series of experiments, we studied the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The experiment was performed in the same manner, except that instead of propane, we used the C3H8/O2/Ar mixture. Typical spectra recorded in this case are presented in Figure 5a. The spectrum obtained at 200 °C contains a negative signal in the hydroxyl region near 3660 cm–1 due to a removal of surface OH groups and a weak wide band near 3615 cm–1 due to the formation of a hydrogen-bonded complex of surface hydroxyl groups with propane (Figure 2, complex 1). There is also a weak negative signal near 2043 cm–1, which coincides with the first overtone of the ν(V═O) stretching mode of the terminal vanadyl groups (Figure 5b). (14,17) The amplitude of this negative signal increases with temperature, indicating that the vanadyl oxygen species are involved in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The increase in temperature also leads to the appearance of a very wide band near 3250 cm–1 and a sharp band near 1612 cm–1 that can be attributed to the O–H stretching mode and the δ(H–O–H) bending mode of adsorbed water, respectively. (28) In addition, the sharp band detected near 3622–3637 cm–1 can be attributed to the formation of the V–OH species. The Ti–OH species were detected by FTIR only at 200 °C.

Unfortunately, because of the strong bands of gas-phase propane (Figure 5a), it was impossible to detect any surface species under the reaction conditions (except for adsorbed water). To overcome this drawback, we analyzed the FTIR spectra obtained after the quick switch from the mixture flow to the air flow at 200 °C. As shown below, this temperature is high enough for the start of catalytic reactions, which is confirmed by the appearance of several bands in the range of 1300–1700 cm–1 due to different products of the propane oxidation (Figure 6). For example, the bands at 1544, 1372, and 1360 cm–1 can be attributed to the νas(COO), ν(CH), and νs(COO) vibrational modes of formate species, respectively. (13,22,23) The band at 1444 cm–1 can be attributed to the νs(COO) vibrational mode of acetate species. (14,21,24) The weak band at 1673 cm–1 due to the ν(C═O) stretching mode of adsorbed acetone is observed after 1 min in the air flow and then disappears because of the oxidation of acetone. (18−21) The very wide band near 3250 cm–1 is due to the O–H stretching vibrations of adsorbed water, which is a byproduct of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Consequently, the sharp band at 1606 cm–1 can be assigned to the δ(H––O–H) bending mode of adsorbed water. (28) The intense band at 3668 cm–1 may be attributed to adsorbed hydroxyl groups coordinated to Ti4+ cations. Note that, at higher temperatures, these species are not detected because of the fast reoxidation of the catalyst. Indeed, we observed suppression of the negative signal of the ν(V═O) vibrations with temperature (Figure 5b). The new band at 1725 cm–1 can be assigned to the ν(COO) vibration of adsorbed formic acid. (23) It is known that the monolayer V2O5/TiO2 catalyst is very active in the selective oxidation of formaldehyde to formic acid and the bidentate formate ion is the immediate precursor of formic acid. (29) The weak band at 1145 cm–1 could be assigned to the skeletal vibrations of isopropoxide adsorbed on the oxidized catalyst surface.

Figure 6. Difference FTIR spectra of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst obtained in situ after 1, 5, and 10 min in the air flow at 200 °C. Before that, the catalyst was treated for 15 min in the C3H8/O2/Ar mixture flow at 200 °C.
Note also that the products of propylene oligomerization are not accumulated on the catalyst surface in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase. The weak absorbance in the range of 2800–3000 cm–1 is mainly due to C–H stretching vibrations of adsorbed reaction intermediates. Indeed, the spectrum obtained after 1 min in the air flow contains weak bands at 2984, 2962, and 2892 cm–1. The first band fast disappears and can be attributed to the C–H stretching vibrations of CH3 or CH2 groups of the adsorbed products of propylene oligomerization. In contrast, the other two bands do not change and can be attributed to νas(CH3) and νs(CH3) vibrational modes of the methyl group of acetate species.
At higher temperatures, the formate and acetate species are transformed to carbonate species. Figure 7a shows the spectra of the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst obtained in situ after the treatment in the mixture flow at 350 °C for 15 min and after the following treatment in air. After 1 min in the air flow, the spectrum contains two strong bands at 1500 and 1433 cm–1 corresponding to the νas(CO3) vibrational mode of carbonate species. The spectrum also contains the wide band near 3250 cm–1 and the sharp band at 1606 cm–1 due to the O–H stretching vibrations and the δ(H–O–H) bending vibrations of adsorbed water, respectively. (28) Besides, there are weak absorption bands at 2962 and 1356 cm–1 that can be attributed to the νas(CH3) and δs(CH3) vibrations of the methyl groups of the adsorbed products of propylene oligomerization or residuals of acetate species. The band at 3650 cm–1 is due to V–OH groups formed under the reaction conditions. All these bands decrease with time under the air flow because water is desorbed from the catalyst surface, the acetate species are transformed to the carbonate species, and carbonates are decomposed to CO2. Two extra bands at 1798 and 1289 cm–1 can be assigned to bicarbonate species. (21) The negative signal of the ν(V═O) vibrations is suppressed with time indicating the reduction of the catalyst (Figure 7b).

Our data demonstrate that the rate of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is higher than the rate of non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Figure 8 shows the FTIR spectra of the gas phase on the outlet of the cell reactor. The spectra were obtained when the C3H8/O2/Ar mixture was passed through the cell reactor during stepwise heating from 150 to 350 °C. To identify the contribution of gas-phase products, the spectrum of gas-phase propane was subtracted from the raw IR spectra. As seen from Figure 8, the yields of propylene, CO, and CO2 in the gas phase appear above 150 °C. Figure 9 demonstrates the temperature dependence of the propane conversion and the concentration of the main gaseous products. One can see that the conversion of propane increases with temperature and achieves 4% at 350 °C. This value is much higher than the conversion of propane without oxygen in the gas phase (0.02%). The yields of propylene, CO, and CO2 also increase with temperature. The conversion of propane and selectivity toward the main products at different temperatures are listed in Table 2. The selectivity toward propylene achieved maximum at 250 °C and then decreased with temperature. This process is accompanied by an increase in the conversion of propane due to the oxidation of propane to CO and CO2.

3.2. Pseudo in Situ XPS Study
We applied XPS to examine the catalyst state under the reaction conditions. Unfortunately, we did not have the possibility to perform in situ or operando XPS studies because we used a routine photoelectron spectrometer. However, the spectrometer was equipped with a high-pressure cell, and we carried out our “pseudo in situ” measurements. In these experiments, we thermally treated the catalyst in the high-pressure cell under a gas flow at atmospheric pressure for 30 min, and then, after fast pumping out and cooling during several minutes, the catalyst was immediately transferred to the analytical chamber of the photoelectron spectrometer without any contact with air. Then, the Ti2p, V2p3/2, and C1s core-level spectra of the catalyst surface were acquired in UHV at room temperature. This approach made it possible to “freeze” the catalyst state and study how the catalyst was changed under the reaction conditions. (30,31) The main results are summarized in Table 3.

The V2p3/2 and Ti2p core-level spectra of the monolayer V2O5/TiO2 catalyst obtained after specific treatments are presented in Figure 10a,b, respectively. The first V2p3/2 spectrum, which was obtained after the treatment in the O2 flow at 350 °C, contains a strong peak at 517.7 eV and a weak shoulder at 516.4 eV that correspond to vanadium in the V5+ and V4+ states, respectively. Indeed, according to the literature data, (13,14,32−34) bulk and supported V2O5 are characterized by the V2p3/2 binding energy in the range of 517.4–517.7 eV, whereas the V2p3/2 binding energy of V2O4 and V2O3 is within the ranges of 516.2–516.6 and 515.4–515.9 eV, respectively. The following treatment in the propane flow (at 420 °C) leads to the reduction of vanadium cations. Indeed, the corresponding V2p3/2 spectrum contains two peaks at 516.5 and 515.4 eV, and the curve-fit analysis indicates that the catalyst contains vanadium mainly in the V3+ state (64%). In full agreement with the FTIR data (Figure 3a), the catalyst surface is covered by carbonaceous species. The following treatment in the O2 flow at 350 °C leads to the oxidation of the catalyst: the V2p3/2 spectrum again consists of a strong peak at 517.7 eV with a weak shoulder at 516.5 eV. Moreover, surface carbonaceous species are burn out, and the [C]/[Ti] atomic ratio decreases from 1.98 to 0.1 (Table 3). This means that 350 °C is enough for reactivation of the catalyst.

(a) V2p3/2 and (b) Ti2p core-level spectra of the monolayer V2O5/TiO2 catalyst obtained after treatments in the high-pressure cell: (1) after 1 h in O2 flow at 350 °C, (2) after 1 h in the propane flow at 420 °C, (3) after subsequent oxidation in the O2 flow at 350 °C for 1 h, (4) after 1 h in the equimolar mixture of propane and oxygen at 420 °C, and (5) after oxidation in the O2 flow at 350 °C for 1 h. All spectra are normalized to the total intensity of the corresponding Ti2p spectra.
In the presence of O2 in the gas phase, that is, under the conditions of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the partial reduction of vanadium cations is observed. The V2p3/2 spectrum obtained after the treatment in the equimolar mixture of propane and oxygen contains three peaks, that is, at 517.6, 516.6, and 515.4 eV. The relative intensities of the peaks indicate that the catalyst contains 70% V5+, 28% V4+, and only 2% V3+.
In contrast, no changes were observed in the Ti2p spectra (Figure 10b). All the spectra contain a sharp symmetric Ti2p3/2 peak at 459.0 eV with the full width at half-maximum equal to approximately 1.1 eV. This means that titanium is not reduced and stays mainly in the Ti4+ state under all the conditions used.
Hence, our data indicate that propane completely reduces V5+ cations to V4+ and V3+, which may be the active species in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. In the presence of oxygen, the reverse process of the oxidation of V4+ and V3+ takes place, and in the equimolar mixture of propane and oxygen, vanadium stays mainly in the V5+ state. This finding indicates that the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane proceeds via a redox mechanism over V5+ cations and that the lattice oxygen is definitely involved in this process. Therefore, vanadia species, which contain mainly V5+ cations, are the active species in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
The treatment in propane is accompanied by the accumulation of carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface. The [C]/[Ti] atomic ratio increases from 0.1 to 2.0 (Table 3), which corresponds to the coverage exceeding several monolayers. According to the FTIR data (Figure 3a), the carbonaceous deposits are the product of propylene oligomerization. It is likely that the accumulation of carbonaceous deposits may be the first reason for the catalyst deactivation in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. At the same time, the carbonaceous deposits have high reactivity toward oxygen and are removed from the surface after the treatment in oxygen (Table 3). This means that the activity of vanadium oxide-based catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation could be stabilized by the addition of a small amount of oxygen to the reaction feed. Indeed, after the treatment in the equimolar mixture of propane and oxygen, the [C]/[Ti] atomic ratio is equal to 0.43 (Table 3), which corresponds to the coverage near only 1 ML. This result agrees well with the FTIR data that also indicate a significant decrease in the amount of carbonaceous deposits in the presence of O2 in the reaction feed (Figure 7a).
The most interesting result is the sharp decrease in the [V]/[Ti] atomic ratio from 0.37 to 0.05 after the treatment in the propane flow (Table 3). This process is reversible: after the treatment in the O2 flow, the [V]/[Ti] atomic ratio increases back to 0.36. The oxidized catalyst is the monolayer and contains mainly surface polymeric vanadia species. (13,14) This means that the decrease in the [V]/[Ti] atomic ratio cannot be the result of coke formation under reaction conditions because coke will attenuate XPS signals from both vanadium and titanium identically. Since XPS is a surface-sensitive method, such significant changes must be caused by a strong rearrangement in the vanadium oxide layer on the titania surface. We suggest that the treatment in propane leads to the reduction of vanadium cations, which is accompanied by the formation of 3D clusters or nanoparticles of vanadium oxide on the titania surface. Due to the large size of nanoparticles, a part of vanadium “leaves” the XPS analysis area, and this leads to the decrease in the [V]/[Ti] atomic ratio. Taking into account that the inelastic mean free path of electrons (λ) with the kinetic energy of 950 eV in vanadium oxide is 2.1 nm (35,36) and the XPS information depth is 3λ, the size of the vanadium oxide particles in the reduced catalyst should exceed at least 6 nm. This is higher than the lower size limit for detection with XRD. Because we did not detect vanadium oxide crystallites by XRD (XRD patter not shown), these nanoparticles are multicrystal structures or amorphous. According to the XPS analysis (Table 3), the main part of vanadium cations in the reduced catalyst is in the V3+ state. We can speculate that propane first reduces V5+ to V4+ and then to V3+; however, a part of vanadium cations are located on the interface between the vanadium oxide nanoparticles and titania surface or in the bulk of the nanoparticles and cannot react with propane molecules. As a result, only 64% of vanadium cations are reduced to V3+ (Table 3).
Hence, we can conclude that the active species in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane contain mainly cations V3+, whereas cations V4+ and V5+ are only spectators and do not take part in the catalytic process. Note also that the destruction of the vanadia monolayer and the formation of 3D clusters or nanoparticles on the titania surface leads to the catalyst deactivation because a significant part of vanadium cations are inaccessible for the interaction with propane. However, the stability of vanadia–titania catalysts in the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation can be increased by the addition of a small amount of oxygen to the reaction feed.
3.3. Reaction Mechanism and Catalyst Deactivation
The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over vanadium oxide-based catalysts has been intensively studied during the last two decades; however, the reaction mechanism is not clear yet. In most cases, the researchers have been focusing either on developing new catalysts or on improving the available ones with the purpose of reaching industrially applicable propylene yields (see ref (37) and references therein). Nevertheless, the vast PDH literature includes only a limited number of publications that describe a detailed kinetic study of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The main experimental results are summarized in several reviews. (11,37−39) Analyzing these data, one can distinguish at least three generally accepted concepts regarding the mechanism of PDH. First, the reaction proceeds by a redox mechanism previously described by Mars and van Krevelen. (40) According to this mechanism, oxygen for the reaction comes from the lattice of the catalyst, and the reduced catalyst is then reoxidized by gaseous oxygen. Second, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over supported vanadia catalysts has been found to be first order with respect to the partial pressure of propane and zero order with respect to the partial pressure of oxygen, which suggests that the rate-determining step involves C–H activation of propane. (39) Third, the zero-order dependence of the propane dehydrogenation on molecular oxygen means that the reaction kinetics is independent of the partial pressure of O2, which is consistent with the fact that reoxidation of the supported vanadia catalyst occurs much faster than the propane oxidation. Indeed, as shown by Argyle et al., (41) the reoxidation rate constants are 103–105 times larger than those for the C–H bond activation reduction step. This suggests that the involved surface vanadia species are fully oxidized during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
Taking into account these concepts and our experimental results, we developed a mechanism for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over vanadia–titania catalysts, which includes a sequence of elementary reactions that must proceed to result in the main reaction products, namely, propylene, water, CO, and CO2. In composing the mechanism, we took into account the oxidation and reduction of vanadium cations and the formation of the main reaction intermediates over the active sites. The active sites were attributed to highly dispersed vanadia species VOx on the titania surface. Since the polymeric vanadium oxide species prevail in the most active monolayer, V2O5/TiO2 catalyst, the active sites contain vanadium cations and three different oxygen species: an oxygen atom forming a vanadyl group (V═O), an oxygen atom bridging two vanadium atoms (V–O–V), and an oxygen atom bridging a vanadium atom and an oxide support cation (V–O–Ti). Initially, the surface vanadia species are fully oxidized, that is, all vanadium cations are in the V5+ state. Schematically, these active sites and the supposed reaction mechanism are depicted in Figure 11.
Figure 11
Figure 11. Reaction pathways of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over vanadia–titania catalysts.
The reaction starts from the adsorption of propane, which can proceed via three types of bond activation, namely, C–C bond activation and C–H bond activation at the primary or secondary position. The C–C bond activation can lead to adsorbed methoxide and ethoxide species, which are nonselectively oxidized at high temperatures to CO and CO2; (13,14) however, because of the very high activation barrier (>67 kcal/mol), (42) this route is not considered further. In full agreement with the order of the C–H bond dissociation energies in propane, the activation energies for hydrogen abstraction from the secondary C–H bond are lower than those for hydrogen abstraction from the primary C–H bond. (42−44) Therefore, the first step of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is the dissociative adsorption of propane on the catalyst surface by breaking a methylene C–H bond to form surface isopropoxide and hydroxyl groups. In this process, vanadyl oxygen is more active than the V–O–V bridging oxygen species (42−44) because the calculated reaction barriers of the methylene C–H bond activation on these species are 27.3 and 30.4 kcal/mol, respectively. (44) The V–O–Ti bridging oxygen species are less likely to be sites for the reaction due to steric hindrances.
According to the density functional theory (DFT) calculations, (43) before dissociating, propane is adsorbed in the form of isopropanol via the transfer of a hydrogen atom from the methylene group to a vanadyl oxygen species. These processes are described by step 1 and step 2 in the reaction mechanism (Figure 11). However, we did not detect isopropanol either on the catalyst surface or in the gas phase by FTIR. This means that isopropanol is quickly transformed to more stable isopropoxide on the catalyst surface. We believe that this is a heterolytic process, during which the proton from the alcohol hydroxyl group is transferred further to a neighbor oxygen atom and the oxidation state of vanadium changes from V5+ to V4+. The Fukui function analysis reveals that the vanadyl oxygen species are more nucleophilic than the V–O–V bridging oxygen species. (43) Consequently, it is more likely that the proton is transferred mainly to a neighbor vanadyl oxygen atom (Figure 11).
This adsorption model agrees well with our experimental data that indicate the decrease in the vanadyl absorption bands in the FTIR spectra (Figure 1a) and the reduction of vanadium cations (Figure 10a) under the reaction conditions. However, there are other DFT calculations (44) indicating that the formation of propylene from isopropoxide on the vanadyl oxygen species is hindered by high reaction barriers (>30 kcal/mol). Instead, propylene can be readily formed through an isopropoxide on the V–O–V bridging oxygen species, releasing a hydrogen atom to a nearby V–O–V bridging oxygen atom with the activation energy of 22 kcal/mol. We do not exclude that both of these mechanisms can be realized under the conditions of real catalysis.
In addition, there is an alternative channel of the C–H bond activation of propane on the hydrated vanadia surface, which is based on the formation of a hydrogen-bonded complex of the surface hydroxyl group with propane. Such complexes, which are characterized by the ν(O–H) vibration band at 3603 cm–1, have been detected by FTIR (Figure 1a). The following hydrogen abstraction can lead to the formation of isopropoxide and a surface hydroxyl group or water. To elucidate the mechanism of this process, additional DFT calculations should be performed.
The transformation route of isopropoxide to propylene is under discussion as well. As shown by Gilardoni et al., (43) who investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on a small unsupported V2O5 cluster (V4O14H8) by DFT, propylene and water can be formed via a concerted process in which a hydrogen atom of one of the methyl groups of isopropoxide reacts with a neighbor hydroxyl group. In contrast, Rozanska et al., (45) analyzing possible reaction mechanisms for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over monomeric vanadium oxide species on silica, have shown that the second hydrogen is abstracted on the nearest V–O–Si bridging oxygen site to form the Si–OH hydroxyl group on the catalyst surface. However, in our opinion, this mechanism can hardly be implemented on monolayer vanadia–titania catalysts due to steric hindrances. Moreover, we did not detect the formation of Ti–OH species under the propane/oxygen mixture flow at least at temperatures when the dehydrogenation rate is high (Figure 5a). It is more likely that the proton of one of the methyl groups of isopropoxide is transferred to the nearest vanadyl oxygen species (Figure 11, step 3). The second hydrogen abstraction is also a heterolytic process, and the oxidation state of the second vanadium atom changes from V5+ to V4+. This agrees with the results by Alexopoulos et al., (42) who investigated the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on an epitaxial vanadia monolayer supported on the TiO2(001) anatase surface by DFT and who found that the propane dehydrogenation leads to the formation of two surface V4+ sites.
Further, formed propylene can desorb and two adjacent OH groups recombine to form H2O, an oxygen vacancy, and the vanadyl oxygen species (Figure 11, step 4 and step 5). As shown by Fu et al., (44) the two adjacent hydroxyl groups tend to form hydrogen bonds; the subsequent proton transfer is exothermic by 14.5 kcal/mol and proceeds without a reaction barrier. The produced water molecule is very stable on the surface and forms H-bonds with the nearby vanadyl oxygen species. The H2O adsorption energy is calculated to be 13.0 kcal/mol. In full agreement with this result, we detected a significant amount of adsorbed water and hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface after the treatment in the propane/oxygen mixture (Figure 6).
Finally, we have an oxygen vacancy and a reduced vanadium cation in the V3+ state. The subsequent reaction is the reoxidation of the catalyst by gas-phase oxygen (Figure 11, step 6). As mentioned above, this is a very fast process. (41) The reoxidation of vanadia-based catalysts was analyzed in detail elsewhere. (41,46,47) According to DFT calculations, (47) the reoxidation of V3+ by O2 can proceed even without any energy barrier. This agrees well with our XPS data (Table 3), which indicate that, after the treatment in the mixture of propane and oxygen, the catalyst surface contains mainly V5+ and V4+ cations. This means that the V3+ cations that are formed during the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane are fast oxidized to the V5+ state by gas-phase oxygen, and the observed partially reduced V4+ cations correspond to the V–OH species.
Hence, we can conclude that the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over vanadia-based catalysts is a two-electron process involving two surface VOx species. The active sites contain V5+ cations. The reaction proceeds via the redox mechanism, where the oxidized catalyst surface oxidizes propane and is reoxidized by gas-phase oxygen. The C–H activation of propane proceeds mainly on the vanadyl oxygen species.
There is another possible reaction channel in which the methylene hydrogen of isopropoxide is abstracted by a nearby lattice oxygen atom, leading to adsorbed acetone. (48) Acetone is unstable and oxidized further to formate and acetate species (reaction 1) even at 200 °C (Figure 1a). In turn, the formate and acetate species can be oxidized to CO or transformed to carbonates, which finally decompose to CO2. The mechanism of these reactions is described in detail elsewhere. (13,14) In addition, the acetate species can be transformed to acetic acids. (49) Therefore, starting from the isopropoxide intermediate, there are two competitive reaction pathways leading to the formation of the product (propylene) and the byproduct (acetone), which can be further oxidized to CO and CO2. These reaction pathways have similar activation energies of 26.7 and 30.5 kcal/mol, respectively, (48) that may determine a moderate selectivity toward propylene. Since all the intermediates that are formed from acetone are unstable under reaction conditions, they cannot accumulate on the catalyst surface and cannot initiate the catalyst deactivation.
Finally, we analyze our results concerning the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Note that the mechanism of non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes over oxide catalysts has also been studied in the literature but to a lesser extent than the mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation. Moreover, only scattered information is available on the non-oxidative dehydrogenation over vanadia-based catalysts. To date, it has been reliably shown that the dehydrogenation of propane and butane is catalyzed by the reduced state of vanadium oxide (V4+ or V3+, or possibly both), but the reaction mechanism has not been considered in detail. (33,50) The main progress was achieved in studying the dehydrogenation of alkanes over ZrO2-, Ga2O3-, and CrOx-based catalysts. (27,51−55) It was suggested that the active sites in these catalytic systems are coordinatively unsaturated cations Zr4+, Ga3+, or Cr3+ (denoted below as M). The dehydrogenation might involve a stage where propane is adsorbed and dissociates, in one or two steps, on the active sites to give an alkyl group, which undergoes hydrogen elimination and generates propylene. There are two possible mechanisms for the initial C–H bond activation of propane on metal oxides. One mechanism is heterolytic dissociation, (26) in which the acid–base pair (M–O) polarizes and then breaks the C–H bond through two distinct processes:
(2)
(3)
In process (2), a proton of propane and a negatively charged propyl fragment C3H7δ− form bonds with oxygen and metal ions, respectively, whereas in process (3), a negatively charged atom H forms a bond with metal cations, and a positively charged propyl group C3H7δ+ forms a bond with an oxygen anion.
The other mechanism is homolytic dissociation without the involvement of lattice oxygen (reaction 4), in which the dehydrogenation proceeds over two coordinatively unsaturated cations coupled with an oxygen vacancy: (27)
(4)
Besides, homolytic dissociation can proceed over two oxygen atoms:
(5)
The latter mechanism was examined by Liu et al., (26) who used periodic DFT calculations to study the dehydrogenation of propane over perfect Ga2O3(100). The authors found that the initial C–H bond activation mainly follows a radical mechanism in which two bridging surface oxygen atoms abstract a hydrogen atom from propane with the formation of a propyl radical and a hydroxyl group. We believe that a similar mechanism is implemented over supported vanadia species for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
The non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane starts on the oxidized catalyst that contains mainly the polymeric VOx species. As mentioned above, in this case, vanadium cations are mainly in the V5+ state and three types of oxygen species exist on the catalyst surface. First, the dehydrogenation proceeds similarly to the oxidative dehydrogenation: propylene and water are formed using lattice oxygen. As shown in the reaction scheme (Figure 11), this leads to the reduction of V5+ to V3+, the removal of the vanadyl oxygen species, and the formation of oxygen vacancies. These cations are not reoxidized in the absence of oxygen in the gas phase. The XPS analysis indicates that most of V5+ is reduced to V3+ under the propane flow even at 420 °C (Table 3). Because the vanadyl oxygen species are absent on the catalyst surface, the activation of propane proceeds on the V–O–V bridging oxygen species. The transfer of proton to the V–O–Ti bridging oxygen species leads to the formation of isopropoxide and a Ti–OH group. Both these species were detected by FTIR (Figure 1a). The proposed reaction scheme is depicted in Figure 12. The H-transfer to the nearest oxygen species with the subsequent loss of propylene proceeds in the next step, forming the second hydroxyl group. Then, the regeneration of the active site under the evolution of H2 concludes the catalytic cycle.
Figure 12
Figure 12. Reaction pathways of the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over vanadia–titania catalysts.
It should be stressed that the Ti–OH species play a very important role in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. On the one hand, these species directly participate in the formation of H2. On the other hand, the accumulation of the Ti–OH species leads to the catalyst deactivation. Indeed, the Ti–OH acidic sites could produce a large amount of carbonaceous deposits covering the active VOx species. (50) Moreover, the scission of V–O–Ti bonds leads to a decrease in the interaction between the titania surface and the vanadia layer, and the distribution of vanadium cations on the catalyst surface changes significantly. Coordinatively unsaturated vanadium cations create new V–O–V chemical bonds to form 3D clusters and nanoparticles under the reaction conditions. As a result, the number of active sites decreases because only surface vanadium cations can participate in the catalytic process. This process is reversible, and after the treatment in oxygen, the catalyst surface mainly contains the polymeric vanadia species (Table 3). Carbonaceous deposits have a high reactivity toward oxygen. Therefore, the vanadia–titania catalysts can be oxidatively regenerated.
4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The present study elucidates the mechanism of the oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over the monolayer V2O5/TiO2 catalyst at a molecular level. On the basis of the obtained experimental data and published results of quantum chemical calculations, we can draw the following conclusions.
The oxidative dehydrogenation proceeds over the oxidized catalyst, which contains vanadium in the V5+ state. The reaction proceeds via a redox mechanism where the oxidized catalyst surface oxidizes propane and is reoxidized by gas-phase oxygen. The reaction mechanism includes two consecutive steps of the C–H bond activation and a final step of desorption of propylene and water from the catalyst surface. First, propane is adsorbed on vanadyl oxygen species to form isopropanol, which fast transforms to more stable isopropoxide. This is a heterolytic process during which the proton from the alcohol hydroxyl group is transferred further to a neighbor vanadyl oxygen atom, and the oxidation state of vanadium changes from V5+ to V4+. The abstraction of a second hydrogen atom is also a heterolytic process, and the oxidation state of a second vanadium atom changes from V5+ to V4+ when propylene and a second V–OH group are formed. Two adjacent OH groups recombine to form H2O, an oxygen vacancy, and a vanadyl oxygen species. As a result, two V4+ cations are transformed to V5+ and V3+. The oxidation of V3+ cations to V5+ by gas-phase oxygen completes the catalytic cycle. Therefore, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over vanadia oxide-based catalysts is a two-electron process involving two surface V═O species. The formation of CO and CO2 also proceeds through isopropoxide, which can be oxidized to acetone on the catalyst surface. Adsorbed acetone is unstable and oxidized further to formate and acetate species, which are finally oxidized to CO and CO2.
In contrast, the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane proceeds over the reduced catalyst and the active sites contain coordinatively unsaturated V3+ cations. The reaction mechanism also includes the C–H bond activation steps, which proceed through homolytic dissociation involving bridging oxygen species. The first reaction intermediates are isopropoxide and a Ti–OH group. This process to a decrease in the interaction between the titania surface and vanadium cations. Further, coordinatively unsaturated vanadium cations can create new V–O–V chemical bonds to form 3D clusters and nanoparticles. As a result, the number of active sites decreases because only surface vanadium cations can participate in the catalytic process. This process is reversible, and after the treatment in oxygen, the catalyst surface contains mainly the polymeric vanadia species. In fact, this is a novel mechanism of catalyst deactivation, which can function on supported vanadium oxide-based catalysts in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of other alkanes.

        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)

4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
