 Unfortunately this document does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It discusses methanol promoted naphtha catalytic pyrolysis over Zn-modified HZSM-5 zeolite catalysts to produce light olefins like ethylene and propylene. There is no mention of converting propane specifically to propylene.
