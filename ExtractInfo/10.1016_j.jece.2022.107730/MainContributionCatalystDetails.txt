 Based on the provided information, there does not appear to be any relevant content related to propane dehydrogenation research. Since none of the documents discuss PDH or ODH processes, I would indicate that the documents are not relevant and leave the rest of the XML structure blank:

	<Relevance>No</Relevance>

The documents seem to focus on recovery of platinum from spent automotive catalysts using hydrometallurgical methods. There is no mention of propane, propylene, or any propane dehydrogenation processes. Let me know if any other information is provided that would change the relevance assessment.
