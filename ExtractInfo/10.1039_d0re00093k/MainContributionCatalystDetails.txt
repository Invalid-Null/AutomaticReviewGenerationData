 Based on the provided documents, there does not appear to be any relevant information on propane dehydrogenation or the conversion of propane to propylene. The documents discuss the synthesis of 3-trifluoromethylated 1,3-butadienes via palladium-catalyzed fluorinated Heck reactions, which are unrelated to propane or propylene. 

Since none of the documents contain information pertinent to propane dehydrogenation research, I have marked the relevance as "No" and did not include any extracted information in the synthesized output:
