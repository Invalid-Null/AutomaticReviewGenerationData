The given document discusses the kinetics of non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation on Cr2O3 catalyst, which is not directly related to improving the performance of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) catalysts. While it provides some useful insights into the reaction mechanism, it does not focus on enhancing selectivity, conversion or stability of PDH or ODH catalysts.
