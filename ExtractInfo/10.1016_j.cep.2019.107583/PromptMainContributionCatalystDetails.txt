1. Introduction
Isobutylene is an important intermediate for synthetic rubber, plastics, and various chemical and petrochemical products such as methyl tert-butyl ether, alkylate gasoline, and butyl rubber [1]. The most popular industrial technique to synthesize isobutylene is catalytic dehydrogenation of isobutane [2]. A dehydrogenation reaction requires relatively high operating temperature for achieving high yield in a conventional reactor. Rigorous operating conditions results in inevitable catalyst deactivation because of coke formation [[3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]]. However, in packed bed membrane reactors (PBMR), the membrane assists in moving equilibrium towards the forward reaction due to selective H2 removal across the membrane (Eq. 1). For this reason, the PBMR is capable of exceeding the equilibrium limitations, which would not be possible without the addition of H2-selective membrane.

In recent years, isobutane dehydrogenation (IBDH) has received plenty of attention as an industrial process due to versatile use of isobutylene [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13]]. Takeshi et al. [14] used a palladium membrane reactor (MR) to conduct IBDH reaction with Pt-Al2O3 and Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst. Pt-Al2O3 catalyst exhibited lower isobutylene yield in comparison to Cr2O3-Al2O3 catalyst, but in both cases isobutylene yield was higher than the thermodynamic limit. Johan et al. [15] studied IBDH in a DD3R zeolite MR at 439 °C and 489 °C. Isobutane was used as the incoming feed stream with nitrogen as sweep gas. At 500 °C, the DD3R zeolite membrane exhibited an exceptional H2/isobutane permselectivity of 520 as well as a moderate H2 permeance of approximately 4.5 × 10−8 mol m-2 s-1  Pa-1. The isobutylene yield in a MR was 41%, where the equilibrium yield was 28% at 489 °C. The increased performance can be attributed to the removal of almost 85% of H2 from the reaction side at lower space velocity. Removing H2 increased coke formation, suppressed hydrogenolysis reaction, and decreased the catalyst activity [[16], [17], [18]]. Ciavarella et al. [19] researched IBDH reaction in a MR, integrated with a bimetallic Pt-In-zeolite fixed catalyst bed with a microporous MFI zeolite tubular membrane. The effect sweep gas flow rate had on membrane performance was investigated with both counter-current and co-current mode. Isobutylene yield of PBMR was four times larger than that of the packed bed reactor (PBR). Weiqiang et al. [20] studied IBDH both experimentally and by modelling for a PBMR and PBR using a Pt/alumina catalyst. Comparative tests showed that a PBMR had higher isobutylene yield and higher selectivity. The simulations showed good agreement with experimental results but slightly over predicted values. Casanave et al. [21] studied IBDH in a zeolite PBMR in combination with Pt-In catalyst. Increased isobutylene yield was achieved in a PBMR by separation of H2 from the reaction side. Both counter and co-current methods were operated and it was found that H2 selectivity and reaction performance was higher in counter-current mode.
Van dyk et al. [22] investigated both Pd and MFI catalytic membrane reactors (CMRs). Both CMRs included Pt catalyst with the membranes for IBDH and showed higher isobutylene yield than PBR. Although both membranes showed different separation properties, the two CMRs showed similar isobutylene yield of 24%. This can be attributed to the fact that the whole process was kinetically limited and thus any increase in separation properties could not increase isobutylene yield. Loannides et al. [23] studied IBDH using a commercial chromia-alumina catalyst for both PBR and PBMR using a dense silica membrane. Impact of temperature and feed composition on reactor performance was studied. A decrease in catalyst activity was observed in the initial 2–3 h and this lessening of catalyst activity escalated with temperature but was reduced by H2 addition in the feed. Membrane permeance was found to be 8.1 × 10−7 mol m-2 s-1  Pa-1 and the H2/hydrocarbon permselectivity was 80 - 300. At all operating conditions, a PBMR showed better isobutylene yield and selectivity than a PBR. Farsi et al. [2] studied modeling for IBDH reaction in PBRs that operated in radial flow. It was simulated heterogeneously based upon the laws of energy and mass conservation. In the model, IBDH was treated as the main reaction and propane dehydrogenation, coke formation, and hydrogenolysis were considered as side reactions. The isobutylene yield and conversion of isobutane at optimum conditions were 91% and 40%, respectively. Kobayashi et al. [1] studied the impact iron oxide had on IBDH over a Pt/Fe2O3-Al2O3 catalyst and found that catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability were greatly improved after a small amount of Fe2O3 was incorporated to the catalyst. Analysis of the adsorbed carbon monoxide by FT-IR revealed that the electron density of the Pt was enhanced by the formation of bimetallic particles.
The MFI-zeolite membranes have been reported to be one of the promising candidates for high temperature reaction and separation [[24], [25], [26], [27], [28]]. However, there are very few reports on high temperature IBDH PBMR. We used MFI-type zeolite membranes in order to investigate the impact of operating conditions on the IBDH reaction at 500–650 °C. For further investigation of the zeolite PBMR, a one dimensional (1D) model of a plug flow reactor (PFR) was built and utilized to check for accuracy as well as to study the effect of operating conditions upon the performance of IBDH PBMR.
2. Experimental
2.1. Membrane synthesis
Secondary growth method was used to synthesize the MFI zeolite membrane on the surface of a seeded α-alumina disk [25]. To prepare the membrane, macroporous α-alumina disks with a thickness of 1 mm, porosity of 25%, and diameter of 1 inch (Coorstek) were used as the supporting structures. In order for proper membrane growth to occur, it was necessary for the surface of the α-alumina disks to be smooth therefore a sandpaper polishing device was used to polish disks [24,29]. After the discs were polished, they were dip-coated with silicalite seeds, dried, and calcined [24,28]. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 98%, Acros), deionized water, and tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 1 M, Sigma–Aldrich.) were combined to prepare the hydrothermal synthesis solution. The molar composition of the gel was 0.095 TPAOH: 35.42 H2O: TEOS. [28,30]

2.2. IBDH reaction
In Fig. 1, the IBDH membrane reactor system used for experiment is illustratively shown. In order to support the disc membrane, graphite gaskets (Mercer Gasket & Shim) were used in order to seal a stainless steel cell from its surroundings. As catalyst, 1% Pt/Al2O3 (Sigma Aldrich) was used in the PBR and PBMR and expressed here as ‘Pt/Al2O3’ catalyst. On top of the membrane surface, the catalyst (550 mg) was evenly dispersed and formed a catalyst bed followed by a carbon cloth sheet and a quatz wool pad to cover the surface. For all experiments, Ar was used as a sweep gas (20 cm3/min at atmospheric pressure), except for the cases which investigate the effect of FAr. Mass flow controllers were utilized to precisely control the gas flow rates (MFC, Aalborg).

Exiting flow rates from the reactor were constantly measured by a flow meter utilizing a soap film. An online GC device (Shimadzu GC2014) was used to examine retentate and permeate gases. For the thermal conductivity detector (TCD), GC was also paired with a molecular sieve 13X column. An alumina plot column was used to separate hydrocarbons in the both streams before being sent to the flammable ionization detector (FID). When switching reaction temperature, a rate of 0.5 °C/min was used for both heating and cooling. The i-C4H8 product, unreacted i-C4H10, H2, as well as the byproducts (propylene, ethylene, ethane, methane, and propane) from side reactions (catalytic and thermal cracking) were measured to check the effect that operating conditions had on reaction performance. Minor byproducts such as aromatics (benzene, toluene, and xylene), higher alkanes, and higher olefins (pentene and hexene) were found to be much less than 1% and excluded from further calculation. Therefore, a basis was used that the total i-C4H10 feed entering the reactor left by either retentate or permeate stream. From this, the i-C4H10 conversion was calculated as seen below:

The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) is determined by:
(10)
where mcat is the mass of catalyst, and
is the volumetric rate of i-C4H10 in the feed stream taken at standard temperature and pressure (STP). When PBR mode was operated, the sweep gas entering was removed from the system and replaced by connecting the exit of the reaction side to the entrance from which the sweep gas originally entered. By this method, the gas exiting from the reaction side went into the permeate chamber thereby exiting the permeate stream. For PBR mode, an impermeable α-alumina disc was inserted in place of the membrane. Key operating conditions used for the IBDH reactions can be found in Table 1.

2.3. Reaction modeling
The main purpose in modeling is to analyze the effects of membrane properties as well as reaction conditions on i-C4H10 conversion and optimize the reactor operating conditions. Control experiments were conducted to evaluate the reaction rate parameters for the IBDH modeling. Rate expression used for the modelling is shown in Eqs. (11), (12), (13). Rate constant (k) and equilibrium constant (Keq) were evaluated by IBDH reaction in the PBR mode. The gas mixture of i-C4H10, i-C4H8, and H2 was introduced in the feed. At each temperature, control experiments were conducted with varying i-C4H10 flow rate while keeping the flow rate of the other two gases constant. The two compositions used in feed at each temperature were (33.3%, 33.3%, 33.3%) and (50%, 25%, 25%) for isobutane, isobutylene and H2 mixture. Using the composition of effluent gases after steady state was achieved, partial pressures for each gas and rate of reaction was evaluated for different flow rate at each temperature. Then the two linear equations were solved at each temperature to evaluate k and Keq at that temperature. The rate constant and equilibrium constant evaluated at different temperatures were used to fit Eqs. 12 and 13.

(12)
(13)
With R being denoted as the universal gas constant, Keq (atm) is the equilibrium constant, E (J mol−1) is the activation energy, and k (mol s−1 gcatalyst−1 Pa−1) is the rate constant.
There are assumptions in the modeling of the reactor: (i) negligible mass-transfer resistance in the thin catalyst layer, (ii) pressure-independent permeance and ideal gas behavior, (iii) isothermal steady state operation, and (iv) negligible side reactions. The model was compared with experimental results, validated, and used to calculate PBMR performance above experimental specifications. In this study, a 1D PFR model was applied under considering plug flow conditions in the reactor modeling. In a differential section of the reactor, the following equations were used for the mass balance equation. The equations for a 1D PFR model were utilized:

(15)
(16)
where ni is the rate of material generation by reaction (mol s−1), mc (g) is the catalyst weight, Qi (mol s−1) is the gas flow rate across the membrane, Pm,i (mol m-2 s-1  Pa-1) is the permeance of component i, Fi (mol s−1) is the feed molar flow rate, vi is the stoichiometric coefficient of species i and ΔPi (Pa) is the pressure difference for component i across the membrane. Differential equations were solved by dividing the membrane into 150 equally sized sections of area. By setting Qi = 0, the PFR model is described by Eq. 14.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Membrane separation properties
In Fig. 2, SEM images revealed that the MFI-type zeolite membrane is ˜12 μm thick. Fig. 3 shows the binary gas permeation characteristics for H2/i-C4H10 and H2/i-C4H8 mixture from room temperature to 600 °C. At room temperature, membrane was more selective to i-C4H10 and i-C4H8 as the separation was adsorption dominant and H2/i-C4H10 separation factor was less than 1. On increasing the temperature, separation becomes diffusion dominant and H2 being smaller molecule diffuses faster and therefor H2 permeance increases faster than i-C4H10 and i-C4H8. Upon increasing to 550 °C, a H2 permeance of 8.1 × 10−8 mol m−2 s-1  Pa-1 as well as a H2/i-C4H10 permselectivity of 8.3 was measured. This is higher than the Knudsen factor of 5.4, revealing that the membrane possessed only minor defects for nonselective viscous flow. Table 2 shows the gas permeation data which was evaluated for the MFI membrane right immediately following ˜215 h of operations at >500 °C. This involved ∼65 h under dry gas permeation and ∼150 h during IBDH reaction conditions. The permeation values were obtained from the data of H2/i-C4H8 and H2/i-C4H10 binary mixtures, and analyzed with pressure of 1 atm (both feed and permeate side) at 23–600 °C.

3.2. Reaction rates evaluation
The IBDH reaction parameters in rate expression were evaluated by varying the feed flow rates during the control experiments at 500–650 °C. Fig. 4 gives the procedure used in determining the constants k0, E, A and B in Eqs. 12 and 13 with each temperature point being used. Eq. 17 presents the final power law rate equation for the dehydrogenation reaction occurring in the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. In these conditions, Eq. 17 was obtained as a combined rate equation only capable of being used to study the specific flow conditions and reactor structure of this study.

3.3. Model validation
For high temperature IBDH reactions, the MFI zeolite PBMR was tested at 500–650 °C with only pure i-C4H10 in the feed, WHSV of 1.37 h−1, and Ar was used as sweep gas with a flow rate (FAr) of 20 cm3/min. As shown in Fig. 5, i-C4H10 conversion in the PBMR increased from 12% at 500 °C to 26% at 650 °C. This can be explained by the reaction’s endothermic nature which causes more products to form at higher temperature. Because of timely H2 removal, IBDH reaction in the PBMR moved towards the product side, leading to a larger i-C4H10 conversion than that obtained by the PBR and the equilibrium limit. Moreover, at higher temperature, the faster reaction rate caused the higher i-C4H8 selectivity and yield. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the calculated values were very close to the experimental values. For PBR, experimental conversion values were little higher than the modelling results. This can be explained by the fact that there were many side reactions in the experiment, which not only lead to the formation of many side products such as propylene, ethylene, ethane, methane, and propane but these side reactions also contribute to the conversion, while in the model only IBDH reaction is considered. For PBMR, the model predicted slightly higher values than experiment probably because permeance values of i-C4H10, i-C4H8 and H2 were assumed constant for the model but permeance values for the experiment slightly decreased as reaction proceeded. The reduction in permeance values for i-C4H10, i-C4H8 and H2 was due to accumulation of the coke in the membrane pores as the reaction proceeds. Highest isobutylene selectivity and isobutylene yield was 97% and 26% for PBMR, which is considerably higher than 90% and 10%, respectively, for PBR at 650 °C. As shown in Fig. 5(c), yH2,P increased with temperature, which can be attributed to higher H2 permeance value at the elevated temperature. As H2 permeation increased in the permeate side with temperature, H2 flux across the membrane increased, which enhanced RH2.

Fig. 6 show the molar concentrations of species in the reactors. The permeate stream of the PBMR in Fig. 6(b) has a larger H2 molar concentration than both the PBMR retentate in Fig. 6(a) stream and the single PBR exit stream in Fig. 6(c). In the PBMR retentate stream, H2 and i-C4H10 molar concentration are lower than the single PBR exit stream. This indicates that H2 permeation across the membrane improves i-C4H10 conversion in PBMR higher than PBR and thus lower molar concentration of H2 and i-C4H10 for PBMR retentate than single PBR exit stream. The H2 molar concentration in the PBMR permeate stream is considerably larger than that of the retentate stream. This is also because of H2 removal across the membrane.

Fig. 7 presents the IBDH reaction results in PBMR at WHSV of 0.82 - 2.74 h−1, FAr of 20 cm3/min, and 600 °C. The highest i-C4H10 conversion of 22% was observed at the lowest WHSV of 0.82 h−1 due to longer residence time of the reactant. In contrast, the reactant in the reactor spends less time at higher WHSV, which causes a decrease in both i-C4H8 selectivity, i-C4H8 yield, and H2 production. With less H2 forming in the reaction, the amount of H2 permeated to the product side also decreases, which reduces the flux of H2 across the membrane. The reduced H2 flux across the membranes causes yH2,P and RH2 to decrease with increase in WHSV as presented in Fig. 7(c). In Fig. 7(a), modeling results are shown along with experimental results for i-C4H10 conversion values. The modeling values agreed well with the experimental values. For increase in WHSV, the model correctly predicted the trend. As in the case of increase in temperature, model slightly under predicted i-C4H10 conversion values for PBR and over predicted for PBMR for the reasons described in the previous section.

In order to increase the driving force for H2 removal from the feed side, the use of sweeping gas on the membrane permeate side is essential, which eventually assists in allowing equilibrium to shift towards the product side. As shown in Fig. 8, i-C4H10 conversion, i-C4H8 selectivity, and i-C4H8 yield of the PBMRs strongly changes with FAr. The partial pressure of H2 in the permeate was decreased with increasing FAr, which enhanced the H2 permeation driving force and membrane flux, therefore increasing the i-C4H10 conversion. Moreover, the corresponding values of i-C4H8 selectivity and i-C4H8 yield were also increased with increasing FAr. Thus, at a large FAr, H2 is removed more efficiently which in turn shifts the IBDH reaction toward the product side and a larger RH2 is achieved within the permeate stream as seen in Fig. 8(c). However, due to H2 depletion, the increased H2 removal lead to a diminished value of (yH2/yi-C4H10)feed in the reaction side. Therefore, based upon Eq. 4, minimizing (yH2/yi-C4H10)feed reduces the value of (yH2/yi-C4H10)permeate (=αH2/i-C4H10(yH2/yi-C4H10)feed), which provides understanding to the decreasing trend of yH2,p and increasing trend of RH2 under larger FAr.

3.4. Model calculation
The model was used to predict the i-C4H10 conversion for two reasons: 1) to obtain conversion values at reasonable experimental conditions without conducting experiments, and 2) to investigate the possibility of achieving near-complete i-C4H10 conversion under practically possible conditions. The PBMR performance was simulated by a 1D PFR model to study operations within and outside of the operating conditions utilized in this report. The effect of WHSV, temperature, and FAr on i-C4H10 conversion were studied. Reaction conditions were kept constant unless those were changed to study their effect: feed side pressure (pfeed) of 1 atm, WHSV of 0.45 h−1, temperature of 600 °C, and FAr of 20 cm3/min. Fig. 9 presents simulated i-C4H10 conversions in MFI zeolite membrane reactors versus operating conditions. Fig. 9(a) shows that both raising pfeed as well as temperature increase the PBMR i-C4H10 conversion. [31] Above a certain pressure and temperature, the i-C4H10 conversion tended to plateau. The highest i-C4H10 conversion in zeolite PBMR (91%) was achieved at pfeed > 6.5 atm and T > 750 °C, which are practically operational outside of a laboratory setup. The effect of WHSV and temperature on i-C4H10 conversion is shown in Fig. 9(b). Because less time is spent by the reactant in the reactor, increasing WHSV decreased i-C4H10 conversion. The maximum i-C4H10 conversion in the PBMR significantly varies with operating conditions. From these results, although zeolite membranes with only a moderate H2 selectivity and permeance is used, it was found that i-C4H10 conversion can be improved by the selection of proper operating conditions in the PBMR.

Fig. 10 shows that i-C4H10 conversion has been measured by use of the 1D PFR model along the reactor length. Competition between H2 permeation and the consumption of i-C4H10 caused the maximum i-C4H10 conversion to be found along the membrane length. For the PBR, gradual enhancement of i-C4H10 conversion was observed along the reactor length due to a continuous decrease in the i-C4H10 partial pressure in the reaction side. For PBR in Fig. 10(d), an increase in pressure reduces the i-C4H10 conversion slightly because the reaction tends to shift to the reactant side with increased pressure. For PBMR, i-C4H10 conversion rapidly increased in the beginning part of the reactor, which is due to the combination effect of H2 permeation and generation. The consumption of i-C4H10, H2 generation, and H2 permeation are increased at high temperatures and pressures, which further lead to the greater enhancement of i-C4H10 conversion. With increasing the pressure to 2 atm, the i-C4H10 conversion further increased for PBMR, as shown in Fig. 10(c). This is due to enhanced H2 transport through the membrane which further causes the equilibrium to shift towards the product side, and results in enhanced i-C4H10 conversion.

4. Conclusions
Isobutane dehydrogenation (IBDH) reaction was performed by experiments and by modeling calculation with microporous MFI-type zeolite membranes. It was found that packed bed membrane reactors (PBMR) successfully exceeded the equilibrium limit and enhanced the i-C4H10 conversion due to H2 permeation across the membrane. The IBDH PBMR exhibited higher conversion, selectivity, and yield than the packed bed reactor (PBR). The impact of operating specifications upon H2 recovery (RH2) was studied and RH2 as high as 52% was obtained in PBMR. For the lab-scale PBMR, the one-dimensional PFR model was satisfactorily performed for the simulation of the IBDH membrane reaction. The zeolite PBMR could accomplish i-C4H10 conversion of > 90% at FAr of ∼ 20 cm3/min, temperature > 600 °C, and ∼ 6.5 atm for the membrane with moderate H2 selectivity (αH2/i-C4H10 ∼ 9.9, and αH2/i-C4H8 ∼ 8.1) and permeance (Pm,H2 < 10−7 mol m−2 s-1  Pa-1). With an exceptional chemical resistance and hydrothermal stability, the MFI-type zeolite membranes are highly likely to be useful for creating PBMRs in high-temperature IBDH reaction.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
