 Unfortunately, the provided extracts do not seem to contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation research. The extracts focus on the ammoxidation of ethane to acetonitrile and ethylene, and do not discuss propane conversion at all. Since there is no pertinent information provided in the extracts, I cannot synthesize a meaningful summary. The output would indicate that the extracts are not relevant:
