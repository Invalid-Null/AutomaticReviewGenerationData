The given document discusses kinetic and mechanistic aspects of propane aromatization on Co/H-ZSM5 catalysts, but does not contain details related to propane dehydrogenation to propylene specifically. The document focuses on understanding the reaction pathways and kinetics for converting propane to aromatics, not propylene. Since the catalyst is not utilized for propane dehydrogenation to propylene, the requested information on catalyst composition, performance metrics, and process conditions for that reaction is not present.
