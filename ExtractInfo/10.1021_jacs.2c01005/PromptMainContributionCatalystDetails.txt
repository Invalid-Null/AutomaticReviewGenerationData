Direct Detection of Reactive Gallium-Hydride Species on the Ga2O3 Surface via Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy

Abstract
Surface metal hydrides (M–H) are ubiquitous in heterogeneous catalytic reactions, while the detailed characterizations are frequently hindered by their high reactivity/low concentration, and the complicated surface structures of the host solids, especially in terms of practical solid catalysts. Herein, combining instant quenching capture and advanced solid-state NMR methodology, we report the first direct and unambiguous NMR evidence on the highly reactive surface gallium hydrides (Ga–H) over a practical Ga2O3 catalyst during direct H2 activation. The spectroscopic effects of 69Ga and 71Ga isotopes on the 1H NMR signal are clearly differentiated and clarified, allowing a concrete discrimination of the Ga–H signal from the hydroxyl crowd. Accompanied with quantitative and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopical methods, as well as density functional theory calculations, information on the site specification, structural configuration, and formation mechanism of the Ga–H species has been revealed, along with the H2 dissociation mechanism. More importantly, the successful spectroscopic identification and isolation of the surface Ga–H allow us to clearly reveal the critical but ubiquitous intermediate role of this species in catalytic reactions, such as propane dehydrogenation and CO2 hydrogenation reactions. The analytic approach presented in this work can be extended to other M–H analysis, and the insights will benefit the design of more efficient Ga-based catalysts.

Metal hydrides (M–H) are a special class of species with extensive studies that can be traced back to a century ago. (1) Formed by hydrogen atoms directly bonded to metal atoms, M–H are generally highly reactive and possess unique chemical natures. Depending on the coordination sphere and/or the electronegativity of the attached metal, they may catalyze reactions by acting as hydrides (H–), hydrogen atoms (H•), or protons (H+). (2) In the past few decades, M–H on solid surfaces have drawn widespread interest in the field of heterogeneous catalysis as they were generally suggested as critical but ubiquitous intermediates in a broad variety of catalytic reactions, for example, hydrocarbon-centered (de)hydrogenation, hydrogenolysis, metathesis, and so forth. (3−5) However, the comprehensive characterization and understanding have always been challenging, (2,6) given the inherent high reactivity, as well as the well-known surface complexity of practical solid catalysts, nano oxides for instances.
As a classical main group metal hydride, gallium hydrides (Ga–H) should be among the most constantly studied M–H species due to the potential intermediate roles in many catalytic systems. (7−10) For instances, gallium-based catalysts such as pure Ga2O3, (11−13) supported and mixed gallium oxides, (14−18) Ga-modified zeolites, (19−25) and surface-grafted single-site Ga catalysts, (26−29) for the direct alkane dehydrogenation to produce value-added chemicals have featured an overwhelming amount of literatures over the past few decades. Meanwhile, gallium-based oxides and supported gallium catalysts have been used for the selective hydrogenation of CO and CO2 to methanol (30−39) and for water-gas shift reactions, (40)etc. In most of the above cases, Ga–H are suggested and theoretically estimated as critical intermediates, yet, poorly experimentally investigated due to spectroscopical challenges. So far, among the commonly used spectroscopical methods, characteristic signals for surface Ga–H were only observed by infrared (IR) spectroscopy in limited literatures. (41−44) A deeper understanding of these unique species would highly necessitate further concrete and comprehensive spectroscopic characterizations.
Solid-state NMR (ssNMR) has been proven as a powerful tool for exploring the surface site/species on solids by offering atomic-level local structural information with high accuracy. (45) For surface M–H analysis, it would have been a suitable approach, owing to the high signal sensitivity afforded by 1H nucleus and the inherent sensitive nature of NMR toward short-range ordered structures. However, in fact, 1H NMR characterization has only been successful in limited cases, where delicate surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC) was required for producing stable surface M–H on well-defined single-site catalysts. (46,47) The observation of M–H on practical solid catalysts during catalytical reactions remains extremely challenging, and to the best of our knowledge, direct NMR evidence of surface Ga–H has never been reported so far.
Herein, we report the first ssNMR evidence of surface Ga–H species generated on a practical nano Ga2O3 oxide catalyst during direct H2 activation and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactions. We show the highly reactive Ga–H species can be efficiently captured by instant liquid quenching and further identified by ssNMR. The complex 1H NMR signature of Ga–H species, resulting from strong couplings (J and dipolar/quadrupolar couplings), was untangled with the help of advanced NMR techniques and numerical simulations. The complementary NMR and density functional theory (DFT) analysis have revealed the comprehensive information on structural configuration, formation mechanism of this special M–H species. Moreover, the intermediate roles of the surface Ga–H in actual catalytic reactions, that is, PDH and CO2 hydrogenation reactions, were revealed.

1H ssNMR Signature of Surface Ga–H
The nano-sized α-Ga2O3 particles were synthesized via the precipitation method (42) (Section S1.1 and Figure S1 in Supporting Information). The Ga2O3 samples were pre-activated in He flow at 773 K, then switched to pure hydrogen at different temperatures with the aim to investigate hydrogen dissociation on the surface. A specially designed liquid nitrogen quenching device (Figure S2) was used to instantly stop the reaction process, thus to facilitate the capture of the potentially generated active species. As depicted in Figure 1a, the freshly activated Ga2O3 (red lines) generally reveal five overlapping peaks, ranging from 0.2 to 5.4 ppm. According to previous literatures, (48,49) the assignments can be readily made as 0.2 ppm to terminal hydroxyl groups (μ1-OH), while 1.3, 1.9, 3.2, and 5.4 ppm to doubly bridging (μ2-OH) and triply bridging hydroxyl groups (μ3-OH), respectively, with different Ga configurations. Note that the existence of these three types of −OH groups on the surface of Ga2O3 was also previously confirmed by IR spectra. (50)
Figure 1
Figure 1. 1H MAS NMR spectra of (a) Ga2O3 samples before (red lines) and after (black lines) H2 activation at 293–673 K, recorded at 18.8 T and MAS rate of 20 kHz and (b) Ga2O3 (H2, 673 K), recorded at different B0 fields (# denotes H impurity somehow introduced during the experiments).
Exposing the pre-activated Ga2O3 to pure hydrogen (black lines) at 293 K did not show evident impact on the spectrum. While further elevating the H2 activation temperature to 393 K leads to evident increase in peaks in the Ga–OH region, along with the emergence of a new peak at 8.8 ppm, note that its intensity grows and becomes evident with the activation temperature raising from 393 to 673 K. Generally, 1H NMR peaks of 8.8 ppm still falls into the typical hydroxyl region, and we found that its observation can be largely compromised by the presence of trace amount of water in the commercial H2 (Figure S3). More interestingly, 1H magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectra of the same Ga2O3 sample (H2, 673 K) acquired at different static magnetic fields (B0) reveal another unusual feature, that is, the 8.8 ppm signal moves to higher chemical shifts as the B0 decreases from 18.8 to 9.4 T (Figure 1b).
Considering 1H as a spin-1/2 nucleus, the dependency of 1H chemical shift respective to the B0 field should typically result from strong couplings between spins, in this case, the possible couplings between 1H and Ga (69Ga/71Ga) nuclei. Assuming the formation of a Ga–H bond, the 1H isotropic NMR signal of Ga–H would subject to a combining modulative effect of scalar 1J (1H–69Ga/71Ga) coupling and second-order coupling arising from the strong dipolar/quadrupolar cross terms between 1H and 69Ga/71Ga nuclei (Figure 2a). Briefly, the scalar 1J (1H–69Ga or 1H–71Ga) splitting of the an isotropic 1H NMR signal will produce four uniformly distributed lines (2S + 1 multiplets, S = 3/2 for 69Ga and 71Ga) with a span of 3 × 1J Hz. On the other hand, additional modulation from the 1H–69Ga/71Ga dipolar couplings, which contain non-vanishing parts under MAS condition due to sizable 69Ga/71Ga quadrupolar interactions, further turned the J-splitting into non-uniform quartet distribution (Figure 2a). Note that the magnitudes of the non-vanishing 1H–69Ga/71Ga dipolar couplings depend on the relative size of the 69Ga/71Ga Zeeman and quadrupolar interactions, changing the external B0 filed, that is, changing the 69Ga/71Ga Zeeman interactions, will ultimately influence the dipole/quadrupole-perturbed shift (d, Figure 2a) on the 1H peaks. (51−53) Similar phenomena were previously reported on systems involving coupling between spin-1/2 and quadrupolar nuclei, for example, 1H–27Al, (47)13C–14N, (54) and so forth. (55−58) It should be noted that there is a more complex situation for Ga–H bonds since gallium has two NMR active isotopes, that is, 69Ga and 71Ga, with natural abundance of 60.11% and 39.89%, respectively. The sizes of the quadrupolar interactions for 69Ga and 71Ga, as well as J couplings of 1H–69Ga and 1H–71Ga, are markedly different. Thus, for Ga–H in single chemical situation, the single 1H isotropic signal would ultimately split into eight non-uniformly distributed lines. Theoretically, each resonant frequency of the lines can be directly determined by the 1H–69Ga/71Ga spin–spin coupling constant JIS and the 69Ga/71Ga quadrupolar coupling constant (see Section S1.5 in Supporting Information). (51,52)

The absolute frequency span (Hz) of a 1H–Ga quartet is 3 × 1J, and is independent of the external B0 field, indicating that the chemical shift span (ppm) is inversely proportional to the B0 field (Figure S4). A higher B0 field would thus result in the shift of the outer lines of quartet toward isotropic chemical shift, considering both the inverse relationships of the J-splitting chemical shift span and second-order coupling shift toward the B0 field. This explains the evident shift of the 1H NMR signal to lower chemical shifts on higher field spectra (14.2 ppm → 10.5 ppm → 8.8 ppm, Figure 1b), suggesting the observation of Ga–H NMR signature.
Furthermore, two-dimensional (2D) 1H {71Ga/69Ga} J-resolved MAS NMR (59) spectra of the Ga2O3 sample (H2, 673 K) were acquired with either 69Ga or 71Ga rotor-asynchronized multiple-pulse (RA-MP) (60) decoupling (Figure 2b). The Fourier transformation of the J-modulated evolutions in the indirect dimension produce a pair of J-splitting signals (blue and red for 1J1H–71Ga and 1J1H–69Ga, respectively) on the isotropic chemical shift (F2 dimension), revealing the direct Ga–H bond with 1H NMR isotropic chemical shift (δiso) of 4.4 ppm (Figure 2b), which is evidently higher than that observed on organometallic molecules. (61) Note that only a small portion of protons contribute to the isotropic chemical shift due to the lack of efficient excitation of decoupling radio frequency (RF) pulses on 69Ga and 71Ga, both of which have extremely large CQ values (vide infra). Nonetheless, these characteristic doublets explicitly and directly give 1J1H–71Ga and 1J1H–69Ga values of 1839 ± 46 and 1443 ± 36 Hz (uncertainties due to subjective errors in measuring), respectively, as demonstrated by the extracted slices along the frequency domain (red and blue insets, as shown in Figure 2b). The rationality of the experimental 1J1H–71Ga and 1J1H–69Ga values was justified by a comparison between gyromagnetic ratios (γ) of the two Ga nuclei (1J1H–71Ga/1J1H–69Ga = γ71Ga/γ69Ga = 1.27). Such large 1J coupling constants confirm the strong chemical bonding between H and Ga atoms, that is, Ga–H. Note that these parameters of Ga–H, δiso, 1J1H–71Ga, and 1J1H–69Ga, can be alternatively obtained via 1D 1H NMR spectra with RA-MP decoupling selectively applied on 69Ga or 71Ga (Figure S5). Though much less accurate compared to 2D J-resolved spectrum, the obtained information agrees with that extracted from the 2D spectrum.
Based on the experimental parameters of δiso, 1J1H–71Ga and 1J1H–69Ga, simulations of the NMR spectra were carried out using SIMPSON software, (62) as shown in Figure 2c. The simulations of 1H–69Ga/1H–71Ga spin pairs were performed at three different B0 fields (9.4, 14.4, and 18.8 T), producing eight overlapping 1H resonant signals (a combination of 1H–69Ga and 1H–71Ga quartets) with their distributions strongly dependent on the external B0 field applied. These simulations are in consistence with our experimental observations (Figure 1b) and supportive of the combined modulation of J-coupling and dipolar/quadrupolar second-order shift on the single 1H NMR signal (Figure 2a). A careful fitting of the Ga–H multiplets in the spectra (Figure 2c) allows us to extract the concrete CQ values of the Ga nuclei in Ga–H entities, which is 71 ± 12 and 44 ± 7 MHz for 69Ga and 71Ga, respectively. The uncertainty in the CQ constants was introduced by combined effects of errors induced by line widths of the peaks in the experimental spectra during numerical simulations and the deviations of values from simulating the spectra acquired at different magnetic fields. These CQ values, which are much larger than that of previously reported for Ga in the bulk phase of Ga2O3, (63) directly reflect the large electric field gradient existing around Ga of the Ga–H units, in other words, a high local asymmetry chemical environment around the Ga atoms. This could explain the failure in our attempt to effectively decouple 69Ga/71Ga during 1D 1H MAS NMR experiments (Figure 2b), nor the acquisition of 2D 69Ga/71Ga–1H correlation spectrum.
Configuration of Surface Ga–H
The obtained multiple critical parameters, that is, δiso and CQ values, of Ga–H can reveal a more concrete structural configuration of these surface species with the aid of DFT calculations. Accordingly, we have investigated the formation of Ga–H on the oxide surface in different representative configurations using periodic models (Figures S6 and S7) with corresponding δiso and CQ values extracted (Table S1). It is found that CQ decreases evidently with the increased coordination numbers of Ga. An asymmetric tetra-coordinated [HGaO3] configuration (Figure 2d) exhibits that CQ values are 64 and 40 MHz for 69Ga and 71Ga, which are close to the measured ones from our NMR experiments and SIMPSON simulations. Also, the calculated δiso(H) of Ga–H and Ga–OH is also consistent with the relative values observed by NMR experiments (Table S1). The high consistency of the values indicates the tendency of the observed Ga–H species existing in [HGaO3] configurations on the actual nano oxide surface, with Figure 2d as a representative model. Note that the [HGaO3] configuration is interesting; since Ga atoms on α-Ga2O3 crystal are in hexagonal coordination, [HGaO3] indicates the preferred formation of Ga–H on lower-coordinated Ga atoms, which is generally associated with defective surface sites at specific surface area or formed via surface reconstruction. In addition, the existence of trace amount of tert-coordinated Ga on the α-Ga2O3 was confirmed by 71Ga MAS NMR (Figure S8).
Formation Mechanism of Ga–H via H2 Dissociation
To gain further information on the formation mechanism of Ga–H on the Ga2O3 surface, we continued to quantitatively analyze the formation of surface hydrogen species on Ga2O3 during H2 activation. The difference spectra of the 1H MAS NMR spectra acquired before and after H2 activation were thus extracted and carefully fitted (Figures 3a and S9). The concentrations of newly formed Ga–H and Ga–OH species by H2 dissociation at different temperatures are summarized in Figure 3b. As shown, both the formation of Ga–OH and Ga–H increased with increasing temperatures, while the ratio of Ga–OH/Ga–H (OH/H) was initially 3.8 at 393 K and gradually decreased to ca. 3.2 at 673 K. Previous IR studies indicate that H2 dissociates on the Ga2O3 surface via both homolytic cleavage to two nearby Ga–OH groups and heterolytic dissociation to a pair of Ga–H and Ga–OH groups. (41−43,64) Our quantitative NMR results are highly supportive of such perspective, and more importantly, the ratio of Ga–OH and Ga–H formation close to 3:1 (especially at higher temperatures) indicates the probability of an equal contribution of homolytic and heterolytic dissociation processes in the current study.

Figure 3. (a) Difference spectra extracted from 1H MAS NMR spectra of Ga2O3 acquired before and after H2 activation at different temperatures and (b) evolution of the increase amounts of Ga–OH/Ga–H species and ratios vs. temperatures.
Furthermore, deeper insights into the formed Ga–H and Ga–OH pair can be obtained by 2D 1H–1H homonuclear correlation NMR spectroscopy as the spatial intimacy of nearby Ga–H and Ga–OH can be efficiently extracted. (65) The 2D 1H–1H spin-diffusion (PSD) correlation spectra were thus acquired on Ga2O3 samples activated in H2 at both 673 and 293 K (Figure 4). It is found that compared to the latter without Ga–H on the surface (Figure 4a), additional correlation signals, that is, 8.8–1.3, 8.8–1.9, 8.8–3.2, 8.8–5.4, were found for Ga2O3 under H2 activation at 673 K (Figure 4b), revealing the readily formation of pairs with Ga–H and bridged Ga–OH groups (μ2 and μ3-OH) by heterolytic H2 dissociation. Meanwhile, no correlation was observed between Ga–H and the terminal Ga–OH groups (0.2 ppm). This observation, together with DFT calculations, suggests that Ga–H is formed along with bridged Ga–OH groups on the surface of Ga2O3via H2 dissociated heterolytically and exists in a tetra-coordinated [HGaO3] structure.

Surface Ga–H in the Propane Dehydrogenation Reaction
The unambiguous identification of the Ga–H NMR signature encouraged us to further explore their existence/intermediacy in actual catalytic processes. Ga2O3 is known as a PDH catalyst (11,12,14,66) (Figure S10), during which Ga–H was frequently suggested as a critical intermediate; however, the direct observation remains challenging. (12,21,22,67,68) Thus, NMR analysis of this critical species was carried out using a similar instant quenching-capture method during the PDH reaction on Ga2O3 at different temperatures, and the 1H MAS NMR spectra recorded at 18.8 T (Figure 5a) of the catalysts reveal the existence of the characteristic surface Ga–H signal with a unique chemical shift of 8.8 ppm in the 1H NMR signal crowd, along with surface-adsorbed propene molecules (5.0 and 5.8 ppm). This observation thus supports the long proposed intermediate role of Ga–H in the PDH reaction. Furthermore, a more intriguing role of Ga–H was further demonstrated via a comparative study of the PDH reaction over Ga2O3 with and without surface Ga–H. As demonstrated by the temperature-programed surface reaction (TPSR) results shown in Figure 5b, Ga2O3 with pre-grafted Ga–H species exhibits observable PDH reactivity (though limited) at relatively lower temperatures, evidenced by the simultaneous generation of propene and H2 starting from ∼373 K, whereas the sample without Ga–H exhibits completely no reactivity, this somehow reflects the potential promotion effects of Ga–H toward C–H bond activation; however, the actual mechanistic insights remain elusive. (21,22)

Surface Ga–H in the CO2 Hydrogenation Reaction
Finally, the successful preparation of stable surface Ga–H during H2 treatment would allow us to further dig into their role in hydrogenation reactions. Ga-based oxides were reported as excellent catalysts for the widely interested CO2-to-methanol hydrogenation reaction. (32,69,70) However, conflicts remain for the initial CO2 activation and the detailed mechanistic route toward the methanol product. (31) Our catalytic results show that the current α-Ga2O3 can also catalyze the hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol/dimethyl ether with high selectivity (Figure S11). Herein, we set out to explore the reaction mechanism on this system, with the aim to achieve a clear understanding on possible intermediate roles of the observed Ga–H species. The reactivity of Ga–H was probed by CO2 reduction via a comparative study by introducing 13CO2 on H2 and He pre-activated Ga2O3, respectively (with and without surface Ga–H). As depicted in Figure 6a,c, the exposure to 13CO2 of the H2-treated Ga2O3 at 573 K leads to disappearance of the Ga–H characteristic signal (∼8.8 ppm/1H) along with the emergence of the characteristic signals of surface formate species (HCOO–, a proposed intermediate for methanol synthesis), (32,34,69−74) that is, 13C (170 ppm)/1H (7.8 ppm). On the contrast, these signals are not observed on the He-treated sample (Figure 6b,d), suggesting the selective formation of surface formate intermediates from the Ga–H/CO2 reaction. Note that this nucleophilic reaction between surface hydride and CO2 molecules is facile as we also show that this reaction can take place even at room temperature (293 K, Figure S12), which was further proved with the IR study using D2 for isotopic tracing (Figure S13). Meanwhile, bicarbonate species with the characteristic signal at 13C (162 ppm)/1H (5–6 ppm) are observed on both Ga2O3 samples, which resulted from the CO2 reaction with surface hydroxyl groups, (49,50,75,76) and may easily decompose at elevated temperatures. We show that a mild vacuum of the sample at 393 K leads to the complete elimination of those species, resulting in the Ga2O3 sample with only formate species grafted on the surface (Figure S14).

(c,d) 1H → 13C CP MAS NMR spectra of different 13CO2-reacted catalysts, where the catalysts are the same as that for the black spectra in a and b, respectively.
Further experimental results show that the formate species are present as critical precursors toward the formation of methanol, evidenced by hydrogenation of the surface formate under pure H2 and D2 atmospheres. As shown in Figures 7a–c and S15, when the Ga2O3 with surface formate species is exposed to pure H2 at 573 K, methoxy species (50 ppm) are formed on the surface, accompanied with the evident consumption of surface formate species. D2 treatment leads to the formation of similar amounts of methoxy groups, as evidenced by similar intensities of the peaks in the 13C single-pulse (SP) MAS NMR spectra of both samples (Figure S15); meanwhile, the dramatic intensity decrease in the methoxy peak on 1D 1H → 13C cross polarization (CP) MAS NMR and 2D 1H–13C heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectra indicates the evident incorporation of D atoms into the methoxy groups (Figure 7c) as deuterium atoms are “silent” in 1H and 1H–13C CP NMR. Analysis of the detailed H/D isotopic composition in the methoxy groups was performed by hydroxylating the methoxy groups with D2O, followed by solution NMR characterization. (71) Specifically, a doublet split by 141 Hz, centered at 3.29 ppm, was observed in the 1H NMR spectrum of the extracted solution, as indicated in Figure 7d, which arise from J-coupling induced from directly bonded 13C atoms, denoted 1J (13C–1H) = 141 Hz. In each of the split peak, there consists of a secondary pentet, corresponding to J-coupling splittings induced by two nearby D atoms bonded to the 13C atom, denoted 2J (2H–1H) = 1.7 Hz. These J-splittings together clearly indicate, importantly, the formation of 13CHD2OD molecules. Such specific type of partially deuterated methoxy (−O13CHD2) unambiguously suggests that the HCOO* species are the active intermediate for the further hydrogenation by D2 molecules, as illustrated in the scheme in Figure 7e, in agreement with other reports. (69,71,73) It is worth mentioning that in addition to 13CHD2OD, fully deuterated methanol, that is, 13CD3OD, was also detected, by 2H NMR, as shown in Figure S16. The formation of 13CD3OD could be attributed to the direct H/D exchange of formate and methoxy species by the high-pressure/temperature (5 bar/573 K) D2 gas environment, which is experimentally supported by comparing H2 and D2 treatments (Figure 7b,c) of the HCOO*-formed catalyst (Figure 7a), where the formate species at 170 ppm totally disappear in the 1H → 13C CP MAS NMR spectrum (Figure 7c) of the D2-treated sample, due to the complete exchange of H by D atoms. For clarification, the full deuteration cycles are illustrated in the scheme in Figure S17.

(d) 1H NMR spectrum of the D2O solution obtained by D2O extraction of the D2-treated Ga2O3 sample. (e) Proposed mechanism for the surface formate formation and evolution under D2 treatment.
In addition, the CO2-to-methanol reaction on Ga2O3 at variable temperatures was further monitored by 1H → 13C CP MAS NMR spectra. As shown in Figure S18, at relatively low temperatures of 393 K, formate (170 ppm) species starts to appear, which is consistent with the temperature for Ga–H generation via H2 heterolytic dissociation (Figure 1). While at 473 K, the surface methoxy signal starts to emerge and continues to increase at higher temperatures, that is, 523 and 573 K, accompanied with the decrease in the formate signal. Such a phenomenon clearly reveals that formate species are a stable precursor, and an inevitable intermediate prior to the formation of methoxy species, at least for the current Ga2O3 system. (69,71,73) Taken the above results together, it is quite straightforward to conclude that the currently observed Ga–H is a critical intermediate in the CO2-to-methanol reaction. The initial heterolytic dissociation of H2 leads to the formation of surface Ga–H, which triggers the initial activation of CO2 molecules via a nucleophilic reaction, that is, a direct insertion of CO2 to the Ga–H species to form the important formate species as a precursor, both of which possess low activation barriers compared to the consequent formate–methoxy conversion, as indicated by their required temperatures.
Conclusions

In summary, we have provided the first NMR evidence on Ga–H moieties formed on the surface of Ga2O3 during direct H2 activation. The observed NMR parameters (δiso, 1J, CQ) of Ga–H helped to establish the concrete surface configuration of the Ga–H, [HGaO3], with the aid of DFT calculations. The formation mechanism of Ga–H by H2 dissociation on the Ga2O3 surface was revealed by a combination of quantitative and multi-dimensional correlation MAS NMR. Furthermore, the intermediate role of Ga–H in catalysis was demonstrated via PDH and CO2 hydrogenation reactions. Our current study has laid a foundation for the study of surface Ga–H species and encourages further exploration of this intriguing species on other systems, such as mixed oxides and even more interesting supported systems, over which the formation of more different kinds of Ga–H species are expected. In particular, surface-supported Ga catalysts may be more suitable systems for the further in-depth spectroscopic investigation of surface Ga–H species due to their highly dispersed and ordered Ga sites, compared to current bulk Ga2O3. In fact, well-defined surface-grafted Ga catalysts were developed recently using the SOMC method and exhibited high PDH reactivity. (26−28) Our current analytical method can be further extended to study other surface M–H species. Moreover, the insights will benefit the mechanistic study of a wide range of surface/interface catalysis and the design of more efficient heterogeneous catalysts.

Ga2O3 Preparation
A gallium nitrate aqueous solution was prepared by dissolving 3 g of gallium nitrate hydrate (Aladdin 99.99%) in 50 mL of deionized water. Then, aqueous ammonia diluted in water (1/1: volume ratio) was slowly added into the solution under continuous stirring at room temperature until the pH reached 8. The resulting gel was filtered, thoroughly washed with distilled water, and vacuum dried in an oven. The xerogel thus obtained was further calcined in a muffle furnace at 773 K for 4 h to obtain the metal oxide.
H2 Activation
The experimental setup used is depicted in Figure S2. The Ga2O3 samples were first activated in flowing He (10 mL/min) at 773 K for 1 h, with a heating ramp of 4 K/min from room temperature to 773 K. The samples were then allowed to cool to different predetermined activation temperatures (293, 393, 473, 573, and 673 K) in the He flow. Afterward, the flow gas was switched to H2 (10 mL/min) at the corresponding temperature and maintained for 1 h, it is noteworthy that typically the commercial H2 was routed to a home-made liquid nitrogen-cooled trap to eliminate the trace amount of water in the gas prior to feeding to the catalyst. The samples were then quenched with liquid nitrogen, and the reactor was sealed and transferred into an Ar-filled glovebox for further NMR sample packing.
C3H8 Reaction on the Ga2O3
The Ga2O3 samples were first activated in flowing He (10 mL/min) at 773 K for 1 h, with a heating ramp of 4 K/min from room temperature to 773 K. The samples were then allowed to cool to different predetermined activation temperatures (573, 673, and 773 K) in the He flow. Afterward, the flow gas was switched to pure C3H8 (10 mL/min) at the corresponding temperature and maintained for 3 min, and then, the samples were quenched with liquid nitrogen, and the reactor was sealed and transferred into an Ar-filled glovebox for further NMR sample packing.
13CO2 Reaction on Pre-activated Ga2O3
The pre-activation processes of the Ga2O3 samples were similar to the above H2 activation process, except for the He-activated sample (Figure 6b,d: 573 K, He; Figure S12b: 393 K, He), only He flow was used throughout the pre-activated process, in order to compare with that of H2-activated samples. For all the sample that was quenched by liquid nitrogen, the gas flow was switched to He (10 mL/min) and maintained for 30 min to purge the H2 molecules in the system. After that, 0.5 MPa of 13CO2 (99% 13C, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) was introduced into the reactor and maintained at 293 K for 20 min or 573 K for 10 min. Next, the sample (393 K, H2, 13CO2) was further processed: evacuating the sample at 393 K for 10 min and then heating under 0.5 MPa of pure H2 at 573 K for 10 min. The reactor containing the Ga2O3 catalyst was then sealed and transferred into an Ar-filled glovebox for further NMR sample packing.
13CO2/H2 Reaction on Ga2O3
The Ga2O3 samples were first activated in flowing He (10 mL/min) at 773 K for 1 h, with a heating ramp of 4 K/min from room temperature to 773 K. The samples were then allowed to cool to 393, 433, 473, 523, and 573 K in the He flow. After that, 2 MPa of 13CO2/H2 (v/v = 1:3, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) was introduced into the reactor and maintained at 393, 433, 473, 523, and 573 K for 5 min, and then, the samples were quenched with liquid nitrogen, and the reactor was sealed and transferred into an Ar-filled glovebox for further NMR sample packing. Next, the sample prepared at 433 K was further processed: evacuating the sample at 293 K for 10 min to purge the 13CO2 and H2 molecules in the system and then heating under 0.5 MPa of pure H2 or D2 at 573 K for 10 min. The reactor containing the Ga2O3 catalyst was then sealed and transferred into an Ar-filled glovebox for further NMR sample packing. After that, the sample (200 mg) treated by D2 was extracted with D2O (1 mL) and sonicated for 1 h. The supernatant was used for further liquid-state NMR.
Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy
The one-dimensional SP 71Ga solid-state MAS NMR spectra were acquired on a NMR spectrometer with a standard-bore Bruker Avance NEO 800 MHz spectrometer (18.8 T). The spectra were collected on 1.3 mm MAS probes, with MAS rate set to 60 kHz. Generally, the RF field strength of excitation pulse was set to 20 kHz, and a recycle delay of 1 s was used.
The one-dimensional SP 1H solid-state MAS NMR spectra were acquired on three NMR spectrometers with different B0 fields for comparison, that is, a standard-bore Bruker Avance NEO 800 MHz spectrometer (18.8 T), a wide-bore Bruker Avance III 600 MHz spectrometer (14.1 T), and a wide-bore Bruker Avance III 400 MHz spectrometer (9.4 T). The spectra were collected on 3.2 mm MAS probes, with MAS rate set to 20 kHz. Generally, the RF field strength of excitation pulse was set to 74 kHz with a pulse length of 3.4 μs (90° pulse excitation) and a recycle delay of 2 s.
1H MAS NMR spectra with 69Ga or 71Ga decoupling were acquired at 18.8 T following the same experimental parameters as described above, except a RA-MP was applied during the acquisition period. The RA-MP decoupling scheme contains pulses of 9 μs and RF field strength of 68 kHz for 69Ga and pulses of 6 μs and RF field strength of 63 kHz for 71Ga, respectively, both with interleaved delay of 50 μs. 2D 1H{69/71Ga} J-resolved MAS NMR spectra were acquired at 18.8 T using the same 3.2 mm probe with a MAS rate of 20 kHz. The t1 increasement was 200 μs, and 128 and 256 t1 points were used for recording 2D data sets of 1H–69Ga and 1H–71Ga J-resolved NMR spectra, respectively.
2D PSD MAS NMR spectra were acquired at 18.8 T using the 3.2 mm probe with a MAS frequency of 20 kHz. The RF field strength of the 90° pulses was 74 kHz (3.4 μs), and the mixing time was set to 100 ms.
The 1H → 13C CP MAS NMR spectra were acquired on the same spectrometer as described above. The initial 1H 90° pulse strength was set at 74 kHz (3.4 μs). A ramped CP condition (optimized with glycine) with a contact time of 4 ms was used, and a 1H high power decoupling of 74 kHz using SPINAL-64 scheme was applied during the 13C NMR signal acquisition period. The same CP conditions were used for acquiring 2D 1H–13C HETCOR spectra. The 1D 13C SP with 1H decoupling (78 kHz) experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance III WB 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The spectra were collected using a 3.2 mm MAS probe at a sample spinning rate of 20 kHz with recycle delay of 10 s. The chemical shifts of 1H and 13C NMR signals were calibrated using adamantane as an external secondary reference, that is, 1.74 ppm for 1H NMR signal and 38.5 ppm for the 13C NMR signal of −CH2 groups.
Liquid-State NMR Spectroscopy
The 1H and 2H NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker 400 MHz AVANCE II spectrometer with a 5 mm probe. The chemical shifts were referenced to the residual H2O (4.74 ppm) and D2O (4.74 ppm) in the solvent.

    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
