Single and combined effects of Bottom Cracking (BCA) and Propylene Booster (PBA) separate particles additives addition to a Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) catalyst on the FCC product distribution and quality
Abstract
In the present work, we have investigated how the single and combined addition of commercial separate particle additives, such as Bottom Cracking additive (BCA) and Propylene Booster additive (ZSM-5 based-PBA), to a FCC USY catalyst can influence the product distribution and quality during FCC processing. Due to the relatively low catalytic activity of the BCA additive, the increasing single addition of BCA implies a higher ratio of thermal to catalytic cracking, leading in particular to higher dry-gases and coke selectivities and a lower gasoline pool quality. The Bottom Cracking ability of the BCA additive is feed dependent and starts to be representative for high addition levels of about 50–60 wt%, allowing the increase of the LCO pool selectivity and quality. The single and low addition level (i.e. 10 wt%) of ZSM-5 based additive allows to drastically improve the light alkenes selectivity at the expense of the gasoline selectivity, improving, due to concentration effects, the quality of the FCC gasoline pool, but generally limiting the LCO selectivity and quality while the coke selectivity is little increased. The combined use of both additives looks like an interesting upgrading strategy considering that it is possible to keep a high catalytic activity, to fully take advantage of the beneficial effects of the ZSM-5 and BCA additives, and to mitigate at the same time the increase of the coke and dry gases selectivities.

Highlights
► BCA addition improves the LCO quality and limits the gasoline pool quality. ► BCA addition increases the thermal to catalytic cracking ratio. ► ZSM-5 efficiency is dependent of the feed/Ecat pair ability to yield C5+ aliphatics. ► LCO selectivity and quality is negatively affected by ZSM-5 additive. ► Beneficial effects of both additives can be simultaneously obtained.
1. Introduction
Light alkenes and, in particular, propylene are traditional building blocks for the chemical and petrochemical industries [1], [2]. The main process for propylene production is today the steam cracking, in which the propylene is not the main product (i.e. ethylene) but an important by-product. Nevertheless, the C2=/C3= ratio in steam cracking process cannot be tuned over a wide range to supply more propylene, and as today propylene worldwide demand grows faster than the ethylene one, other propylene sources are needed to fill the gap between propylene demand and supply [3]. Alternative routes for direct production of propylene, such as propane dehydrogenation [4], methanol-to-olefins [5] and olefin conversion, including metathesis and olefin cracking processes [6], are available. However, even if each one of these routes can offer competitive economics, it is not expected that these technologies will be able to completely make up the shortfall of propylene supply.
The second largest source of propylene is from Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) process, and FCC units are expected to play a fundamental role for propylene production [7]. Conventional propylene yields achieved in FCC units are 4–7 wt%. However, adapted FCC processes, such as Deep Catalytic Cracking (DCC) and PetroFCC processes may be able to increase the propylene yield up to 15–20 wt% [8]. Another possibility to increase the FCC propylene production, as proposed by various authors [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], is to recycle to the FCC unit the high sulfur and olefin content light naphtha from catalytic cracking. On the other hand, it is well known that using optimized conditions (i.e. high severity) and shape-selective catalyst additives (i.e. Propylene Booster additives – PBA), it is possible to directly improve the yield of propylene and other light olefins in the conventional FCC process, at the expense mainly of gasoline and distillate products [15], [16]. Taking them together, these modifications can result in propylene yield up to 8–12 wt%.
Propylene Booster additives are zeolitic materials based on ZSM-5 zeolite (Nan·AlnSi96n·O192·16H2O with 0 < n < 27) which gives, thanks to its intermediate pore size distribution, a preferential cracking selectivity to light olefins (C2–C5) in general and to propylene in particular at the expenses mainly of linear and low octane compounds of the gasoline pool. ZSM-5 based additives were commercially introduced into the FCC process in the 1980s to improve gasoline octane numbers. Nevertheless, today, the additive is principally used with the purpose of increasing C3–C5 olefins yields. It is generally well accepted in the literature [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23] that the light olefins increase which occurs when using hydrothermally deactivated ZSM-5 combined with USY catalysts, is mainly due to the cracking of gasoline pool olefins previously produced by the USY catalyst. Skeletal isomerization is energetically favored with respect to cracking for lower carbon number carbenium ions, while higher carbon number carbenium ions are preferably cracked to C2–C5 olefins. C5 olefins are simultaneously formed and consumed by ZSM-5 additives [24], [25].
Concerning diesel, FCC process is an important diesel contributor with the Light Cycle Oil (LCO) fraction. As, at least in Europe, the demand for middle distillates is strongly increasing, it is necessary to optimize the cracking conditions to also favor diesel selectivity and quality in FCC units. Indeed, the LCO fraction obtained in the FCC process has, generally, a high content of aromatic and sulfur compounds and has, consequently, a relatively low cetane index. This implies that post-treatments, such as hydrotreatment, are always necessary before blending this fraction into the final diesel pool. A high quality diesel involves to minimize the production of multi-cyclic hydrocarbons and to maximize the proportion of linear compounds or/and one-ring systems with alkyl chains. The difficulty is that high molecular weight linear hydrocarbons and alkyl-substituted mono-aromatics crack very fast and, consequently, the selectivity to this kind of components during FCC processing, using usual operating conditions and catalyst technology, is very weak. Nevertheless, process variables as well as the nature of the catalyst have a huge and direct influence on the selectivity and quality of the FCC produced LCO. For instance, it is well accepted that a decrease of the reaction temperature, catalyst-to-oil ratio or residence time decreases the content of polynuclear aromatics (PNAs) in the LCO fraction and thus implies a higher FCC diesel quality. Nevertheless, those particular conditions can have a negative impact on bottoms conversion.
FCC upgrading of heavy oils with the help of specialized catalyst additives could be another interesting option to enhance the yield and quality of the LCO. The use of specialized additives, having a balanced acidity, such as aluminas and silica-aluminas based catalysts (i.e. Bottom Cracking additives – BCA), should help to achieve higher bottoms conversion, with good selectivities to diesel and kerosene. Indeed, using short contact time conditions to avoid hydrogen transfer and secondary reactions that are at the origin of coke formation and LCO recracking, together with the use of BCA additives for the upgrading of heavy oils should be able to yield a representative amount of compounds in the diesel boiling range having a relatively low ring number. Additives containing a very active matrix, such as Bottom Cracking additives, were developed in the principle of the 1990s and have been successfully used in numerous units worldwide since then. Bottom Cracking additives are non-zeolitic materials based on an active alumina or even on a silica-alumina-Mg [26] structure having an optimized pore distribution making easier the accessibility of heavy molecules of the feedstock to the acid sites. Consequently, such additives should have a great impact on the cracking mechanism kinetics and allow to enhance the catalytic cracking kinetic of heavy molecules, limiting the HCO selectivity and improving LCO and gasoline selectivities, without perceivably increases of gases and coke. The Bottom Cracking ability of the additive is clearly a function of the aluminium oxide content (Al2O3) and the mesoporous surface area, even if several other factors, such as for example the global pore size distribution and the proportion of Brönsted acid sites, must also be considered.
The present paper focuses on the single and combined use of commercial Propylene Booster (PBA-ZSM-5 based additive) and Bottom Cracking (BCA) to separately or simultaneously maximize light olefins and diesel yields during FCC process operations. In a first part of the work, the influence of the single use of BCA additive technology on product distribution and quality will be presented. The possibility to use the BCA additive as base catalyst of the FCC process was first investigated. Later, the combined action of BCA and an USY based equilibrium catalyst (Ecat) with different ratios Ecat/BCA has been studied. In a second part, the impact on the product distribution and quality of the single 10 wt% addition of a Propylene Booster additive to an equilibrium FCC catalyst when reacting different feedstocks has been explored. Finally, the synergic effects of the combined addition of Propylene Booster and Bottom Cracking in the form of separate particle additives together with an equilibrium FCC catalyst has been studied and discussed.

2.2. Catalysts and additives pre-treatment
All equilibrium catalyst batches and additives were previously hydrothermally stabilized in order to work always in the same and constant conditions of thermal deactivation, close to the equilibrium state, ensuring constant catalytic properties of catalysts and additives during the different catalytic tests. The hydrothermal stabilization was carried out at high temperature (i.e. 750 °C) under a water saturated atmosphere during 5 h.
2.3. Cracking experiments and product analysis
A transported bed Micro-Downer (MD) and a fixed bed Micro-activity test (MAT) reactor were used to simulate and determinate the FCC process performances of the different catalysts blends and crude oil feeds tested. Hardware and detailed operation of the MD unit have been described previously [27], [28]. Main features of the MD unit comprise: a catalyst preheater where the catalyst is stored before the test, a once-through tubular downer reactor where the feed and the preheated catalyst are continuously contacted at a short residence time (i.e. from 0.3 to 2 s), and a separator in which the catalyst is separated from hydrocarbon products before regeneration. The unit runs at a steady-state regime during the reaction step. The catalyst, separated from the reaction products, is continuously stripped during the reaction and 60 s more after the end of the reaction step. Products are recovered by well known methods (i.e. cold traps for liquids and water displacement burette for gases) and catalyst is regenerated after the test with a controlled air flow of 500 ml/min at 600 °C during 3 h. Nitrogen is injected for catalyst smooth transport and appropriate feed dispersion.
The MAT reactor is a fixed bed unit which is computer controlled and can perform in a continuous way up to eight cycles, i.e. stripping-reaction-regeneration, without personal assistance. The reaction zone and product recovery systems have been designed in accordance with ASTM D-3907 standard; details are given elsewhere [29], [30], [31]. Before each test, the system is purged with a 50 ml/min nitrogen flow during 30 min at reaction temperature. After reaction, stripping of the catalyst is carried out for 15 min using a nitrogen flow of 50 ml/min. During reaction and stripping steps, liquid products are collected in the corresponding glass receiver, located at the exit of the reactor and kept at 20 °C by means of a cold bath, while gaseous products are collected in a burette by water displacement. After stripping, the catalyst is regenerated in situ at 600 °C for 3 h using a 100 ml/min stream of air.
In both units, gaseous products are analyzed using a Varian 3800-GC chromatograph equipped with three detectors; two thermal conductivity detectors (TCD) for H2 and N2 analysis respectively separated in a 1.8 m MS 5A and a 0.8 m MS 13X molecular sieves; and a flame ionization detector (FID) for C1–C6 hydrocarbons which are separated in a 50 m plot/Al2O3 column. Simulated distillation of liquid products is carried out using a Varian 3800-GC chromatograph according to the ASTM-2887-D86 procedure. Dry gases (H2, C1–C2), LPG (C3–C4), light gasoline (C5 < bp < 151 °C), heavy gasoline (151 °C < bp < 216 °C), light cycle oil (LCO) (216 °C < bp < 359 °C) and heavy cycle oil (HCO) (bp > 359 °C) yields are calculated from GC analyses. Coke yield is measured by measuring the CO2 produced during the catalyst regeneration step (complete coke oxidation) using a BINOS 100 infrared analyzer. Mass balances are considered acceptable when comprised in the limits 95–105 wt% of the injected feed. Conversion is defined as the sum of liquid products boiling below 216 °C, gases and coke, while total conversion is defined as the sum of liquid products boiling below 359 °C, gases and coke. Crackability or second order conversion, which allows to determine the cracking activity of FCC catalysts, is expressed as shown in Eq. (1).

Second order conversion is a more linear measure of reaction severity than conventional conversion for a reaction such as catalytic cracking, since apparent second-order kinetics describes the gasoil conversion [32].
2.4. Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC)
The overall cracking product distribution of the liquid phase, i.e. gasoline, LCO and bottom fraction, based on the boiling point distribution gives little information on the chemical composition. To get a better picture of the chemical composition of the products and, in particular, of the gasoline and LCO (diesel pool), a more detailed analysis was performed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC). They were carried out using an Agilent 7890A GC equipped with a capillary flow technology GC × GC flow modulator (Agilent Technologies), a split injector at 250 °C (250/1) (1.0 μl) and a flame ionization detection (FID) system (300 °C, 200 Hz). High purity hydrogen was used as a carrier gas at constant flow rate. The column sets consisted of a combination of a non-polar column (HP-5 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.5 μm, Agilent technologies) and a polar column (HP-INNOWax 5 m × 0.25 mm × 0.15 μm, Agilent technologies), placed in the same oven. The system was operated at constant flow of 0.5 ml/min for the first column and 30 ml/min for the second one, and at programmed temperatures, going from 50 °C (1 min) to 260 °C (79 min) at 3 °C/min. Modulation period was set to 2.8 s and data were processed using the GC image™ v2.1 software developed by GC Image™, LLC. Fig. 1 gives an example of analysis result obtained for a Micro-Downer FCC liquid effluent using GC × GC technology. Liquid products are classified into the following families: Saturates (i.e. aliphatics), mono-aromatics and naphthenic-mono-aromatics for the gasoline pool and saturates, mono-, bi and tri-aromatics and naphthenic-mono- bi- and tri-aromatics for the LCO pool.

3.1. Influence of the single Bottom Cracking separate particle additive addition
3.1.1. Bottom Cracking additive as FCC base catalyst
It is generally well accepted that Bottom Cracking additives usually have a moderate catalytic cracking activity due to their relatively low density of acid sites. Therefore, with the purpose to use this kind of additive as base catalyst of the FCC process for the processing of heavy feedstock, it is then necessary to check the conversion level. Thus, we have first explored if the BCA technology can be used in a satisfactory manner as standalone cracking catalyst or if some standard equilibrium FCC catalyst has to be blended with to achieve the required conversion. With the aim to compare the catalytic behavior of the BCA catalyst with that of a classical equilibrium FCC catalyst (see Table 1), several cracking experiments have been carried out with both materials using the Micro-Downer reactor. The experimental conditions for the runs were as follows: reaction temperature of 530 °C, catalyst residence time of about 2 s, stripper temperature of 500 °C and feed preheating temperature of 250 °C. Activity data obtained with the pure Bottom Cracking additive and the pure equilibrium FCC catalyst after interpolation at 12 g/g catalyst-to-oil ratio and cracking three different feedstocks (see characteristics in Table 2) are summarized in Table 3. Additionally, Fig. 2 compares the Micro-Downer product selectivity of the catalysts with the different feedstocks.

Fig. 2. Micro-Downer product yields in function of the second order conversion for the pure equilibrium FCC catalyst and the pure BCA additive and three different processed feedstocks.
According to results presented in Table 3 and Fig. 2A, and as it was expected, independently of the nature of the feedstock, a huge catalytic activity loss at iso-process severity is observed when using the pure BCA additive instead of a classical equilibrium FCC catalyst. Indeed, a decrease of about 20 wt% of conversion at 12 g/g−1 catalyst-to-oil ratio is observed and the second order conversion reached with the pure BCA additive is more than twice lower than in the case of the equilibrium FCC catalyst. This important fall of conversion is principally due to the decrease of gases (mainly the LPG pool) and gasoline (mainly the light gasoline fraction) yields, while LCO and HCO yields increase with BCA. On the other hand, according to Fig. 2, the use of the BCA additive instead of a classical equilibrium FCC catalyst implies an increase of gases, LCO and coke at the expense of gasoline and HCO selectivities. It appears that the BCA additive plays well its role of Bottom Cracking promoter, but, due to its very low catalytic activity, a higher degree of thermal cracking occurs; leading to representative changes in product selectivities. In all cases, the limited catalytic activity of the BCA additive makes unrealistic the use of this material as FCC base catalyst for the processing of heavy feedstocks. If one would like to use BCA as main catalyst, the use of very extreme severe operation conditions and probably some recycling operations would be necessary in order to keep the FCC process economically sustainable.
3.1.2. BCA as additive of an equilibrium FCC catalyst
3.1.2.1. Optimum BCA/Ecat ratio
To estimate the influence of the rate of addition of the Bottom Cracking Additive to an equilibrium FCC catalyst on activity, selectivity and product quality, various Micro-activity tests (MAT), using the same reference feedstock (i.e. feedstock C – see Table 2), have been carried out. Reaction conditions were as follows: reaction temperature of 530 °C, time-on-stream (TOS) of 30 s, catalyst-to-oil ratios from 1.0 to 4.0 g/g and feed preheating temperature of 80 °C. For each test, the quantity of catalyst (i.e. BCA + USY Ecat) is unchanged (3.0 g) and the catalyst-to-oil ratio parameter is changed by varying the amount of injected feedstock. Five catalytic systems with increasing content of BCA additive have been prepared by physical blend, varying the BCA-to-USY Ecat ratio from 0 to 100 wt% (i.e. 0 wt% (Pure USY Ecat), 25 wt%, 50 wt%, 75 wt% and 100 wt% (Pure BCA)). Fig. 3 shows the effect of the high-level addition of Bottom Cracking additive to a FCC USY catalyst on the second order MAT conversion. Nevertheless, before going further, it is important to notice that even if due to the intrinsic differences between MD and MAT reactors (i.e. transported versus fixed catalytic bed, low versus high contact time, …), MD and MAT catalyst activity and selectivity under iso-severity operative conditions are quite different, the observed trends in both units must be similar.

Fig. 3. MAT activity (measured by crackability) as a function of catalyst-to-oil ratio for the base USY Ecat and the different Bottom Cracking additive blends.
As one can see from Fig. 3, increasing BCA addition to an equilibrium FCC catalyst has a detrimental impact on the catalytic activity at iso-severity conditions, though the decrease is relatively small for the 25 wt% addition level. For instance, taking the results at 4 g/g catalyst-to-oil ratio, one can observe a relative decrease of about 7% of the crackability of the feed when incorporating 25 wt% of additive, while at 50–75 wt% of additive level and for the pure BCA additive, the crackability penalty reaches respectively 17, 22 and 29%. The negative effect of BCA addition on the catalytic activity is very likely due to a catalyst dilution effect, having its origins in the previously observed very low density of active sites of the BCA. Concerning product selectivity, Table 4 shows the typical MAT product distribution of the reference equilibrium catalyst and the BCA/Ecat mixtures at constant conversion of 60 wt%. It is interesting to notice that the effects of the BCA addition on the product distribution observed when using a MAT reactor, are more notorious than when a Micro-Downer transported bed unit was used for reaction. In all cases, the use of high contents of BCA additive appears to favors gases (mainly dry gases) and LCO selectivities, while gasoline and HCO selectivities are negatively affected. Moreover, the rate of dehydrogenation is also favored by the BCA additive addition (i.e. higher hydrogen production) and consequently the coke selectivity is representatively increased when increasing the additive content. The observed increase of dry gases and coke selectivity is consistent with the fact that the addition of a relatively low catalytically active additive would give a higher ratio of thermal to catalytic cracking than with the most active Ecat, leading to a product distribution different of the typical acid-catalyzed cracking. In addition, it is well established that the zeolite-to-matrix activity ratio plays a key role in the performance of FCC catalytic systems, and, at constant catalyst activity, a decrease in zeolite-to-matrix activity ratio results in an increase in LCO, coke and dry gases yields, and a decrease in gasoline and bottoms yields [33]. Knowing that the addition of BCA additive implies a lower zeolite-to-matrix activity ratio of the resulting catalytic system, the observed selectivity trends can thus partially be explained by the influence of the zeolite-to-matrix activity ratio parameter. Globally, a higher zeolite-to-matrix activity ratio (i.e. a lower BCA additive addition level) of the catalytic system implies a lower catalyst coke selectivity, but at the same time reduces the ability of the catalytic system to crack heavy oil molecules. The optimum BCA additive addition level for the cracking of resid feedstock will be thus directly dependent on the overall zeolite-to-matrix activity ratio of the composed catalytic system and will be different according to the equilibrium catalyst properties, feedstock composition, process parameters and desired product distribution.

On the other hand, the higher dehydrogenation activity of the Bottom Cracking additive is accompanied by a significant enhancement of the Hydrogen Transfer Index (HTI – defined as the isobutene-to-isobutane ratio). Since a high HTI is an indication of low hydrogen transfer activity, the proportion of unsaturated molecules, and particularly light olefins, will increase due to the addition of Bottom Cracking additive. The lower hydrogen transfer activity of the catalytic systems incorporating BCA additive could be related to the difference in nature of acid sites and the lack in the matrix of micropores and cavities present in the zeolite that favor bimolecular reactions, such as hydrogen transfer reactions. In addition, it is well accepted that the bimolecular hydrogen transfer mechanism implies that an adsorbed carbenium ion takes a hydride ion from a nearby donor molecule to desorb as saturated molecule, while the donor is further adsorbed as a carbenium ion and may either desorb as a dehydrogenated product, giving-back the proton to the catalyst, or suffer a β-cracking process to yield an unsaturated molecule and a smaller carbenium ion [34]. This is why it is thought that the density of paired acid sites [35] and the catalyst affinity for olefin adsorption [36] are important governing parameters for the bimolecular hydrogen transfer mechanism. Knowing that the BCA additive has a much lower acid site density than USY catalysts, it is possible that the addition of BCA additive to an USY catalyst decreases the overall contribution of the catalytic system to hydrogen transfer reaction. Following the same reasoning, the lower rate of isomerization, expressed as the ratio of i-C4 to n-C4 or i-C5 to n-C5, observed for the BCA containing catalytic systems could be explained by the fact that branched compounds in FCC process are mainly produced via carbenium ion cracking mechanism involving a tertiary carbenium ion, and by consequence, the decrease of the overall acid site density of the catalytic system due to the incorporation of the BCA additive would very likely limit the kinetics of the carbenium ion cracking mechanism, leading to a lower proportion of branched compounds of the products. However, the results could also be explained by assuming that most of the cracking occurring on BCA will be thermal (radical type cracking) that produces larger amounts of olefins and lineal products than catalytic cracking.
The GC × GC technique was used to explore in more detail the gasoline and LCO pool product and molecular weight distribution at 60 wt% conversion. All the compounds are grouped in the following families: aliphatics, mono-aromatics and naphthenic-mono-aromatics for the gasoline pool and aliphatics, mono-, bi and tri-aromatics and naphthenic-mono- bi- and tri-aromatics for the LCO pool. According to results (see Fig. 4A), a slight and continuous increase of the proportion of aliphatic compounds in the gasoline fraction occurs when increasing the BCA content, mainly at the expense of the aromatics proportion, while the naphthenic-mono-aromatic hydrocarbons proportion is little influenced by the BCA content. On the other hand, the incorporation of the BCA additive also has an impact on the relative molecular weight distribution of the hydrocarbons in the gasoline fraction (see Fig. 4B). Indeed, as one can see, the increase of the BCA additive content in the catalytic system causes an increase of the mean molecular weight of the hydrocarbons in the gasoline fraction, improving the proportion of C8–C11 compounds and lowering the amount of the C5–C7 hydrocarbons. Nevertheless, according to the previously observed impact of the BCA additive addition on the isomerization rate (i.e. lower isomerization rate when increasing the BCA content of the catalytic system), one can think that the higher mean molecular weight of the gasoline pool is principally due to low octane number linear aliphatic hydrocarbons. Summarizing all the information gathered on the influence of the BCA additive incorporation, one can say that the BCA incorporation very likely has a negative impact on the quality of the gasoline produced during the catalytic cracking process, limiting the production of C5–C11 high octane number hydrocarbons such as aromatics and branched linear molecules.

Fig. 4. Effect of different addition levels of BCA additive on gasoline and LCO pool composition at constant MAT conversion of 60 wt% (interpolated values).
Concerning LCO pool composition (see Fig. 4C), it is observed that the high level addition of BCA additive causes a significant increase in the proportion of aliphatic, mono-aromatic and naphthenic-mono-aromatic compounds, at the expense mainly of the bi-aromatic hydrocarbons and to a lesser extent of the tri-aromatics. The molecular weight distribution (see Fig. 4D) is also affected by the BCA additive incorporation and, as observed for the gasoline fraction, the addition of BCA additive to an equilibrium catalyst increases the overall proportion of high molecular weight hydrocarbons in the LCO fraction.
Globally, the lower proportion of polycyclic aromatics and the higher proportion of aliphatic and high molecular weight molecules seem to suggest that the addition of BCA additive could allow to representatively improve the cetane number and consequently the quality of the LCO pool produced from the FCC process. Nevertheless, it is important to notice that all the previously highlighted effects of the BCA addition on the gasoline and LCO fraction overall composition, only start to be really significant for a BCA content higher than 50 wt% and would be consistent with the already mentioned impact of the BCA additive incorporation which implies a higher proportion of thermal cracking (i.e. free radical mechanism) versus acid catalyzed cracking (i.e. carbenium ion mechanism), and therefore a lower production of branched hydrocarbons, aromatics and polycyclic aromatics. The previously observed effects can also be explained by the particular porous structure (i.e. mesoporous structure) of the BCA additive which allows an easy and quick desorption of the primary cracking products, limiting consequently the occurrence of secondary cracking reactions which are generally at the origin of the formation of lower molecular weight and aromatic hydrocarbons.
3.1.2.2. Optimal way of incorporation of the BCA additive
Conceptually, as shown in Fig. 5, two different possible ways of incorporation of the BCA additive can be imagined when working with a fixed-bed reactor unit. Configuration 1 corresponds to a classical physical blend of BCA additive and FCC Ecat catalyst (as seen previously), and configuration 2 corresponds to a biphasic catalytic system where the catalytic bed of BCA additive is separated from the bed of equilibrium USY catalyst. The main idea of the latter is to have two specialized and separated catalytic zones, where the first one allows the precracking of high molecular weight molecules which can be afterward cracked more easily in the second conventional catalytic zone. At the industrial scale, this kind of strategy could be assimilated to a two-stage catalytic cracking process, involving the BCA additive as precracking catalyst in the first stage, and a classical FCC catalyst in the second one.

Fig. 5. Different possible ways of incorporation of the BCA additive in a fixed-bed reactor FCC unit.
In order to estimate the advantages of the use of this kind of biphasic catalytic system in comparison with the classical physical blending strategy, some MAT tests have been carried out, using a reference feedstock (i.e. feedstock C, see Table 2) and similar operating conditions than the ones used for the determination of the optimum addition level of BCA additive (see Section 3.1.2.1). Fig. 6 compares, at different catalyst-to-oil ratios, the catalytic activity of the base USY FCC Ecat catalyst and the different BCA/Ecat blends in the two ways of incorporation of the BCA additive. According to the results shown in Fig. 6, the use of a BCA/Ecat biphasic catalytic system does not seem to be a particularly interesting strategy because the dilution effect, at the origin of a lower catalytic activity of the catalytic system, looks like a bit more predominant than in the case of the BCA/Ecat physical blending. Moreover, the product distribution comparison at constant MAT conversion (see Table 5) shows that the gases and especially the coke selectivities are higher when using the biphasic catalytic system, showing that the ratio of free radical mechanism versus carbenium ion mechanism is a bit more favored in the case of the biphasic catalytic system. At the same time, the higher selectivities to dry gases and coke induce a lower selectivity to gasoline, while LCO pool selectivity is little improved.

In addition, it appears that the hydrogen transfer index is significantly lower in the case of the biphasic system and by consequence the bimolecular hydrogen transfer activity of the biphasic system is higher than the one of the physical blend, and the FCC products will be less olefinic. It is also observed that the isomerization rate seems to be less affected by the BCA additive addition in the case of the biphasic than in the case of the physical blending and therefore the proportion of high branched compounds will be higher. Concerning gasoline and LCO composition, the comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography analysis shows that, at constant MAT conversion of 60 wt%, both incorporation ways implies the same already observed trends with a similar order of magnitude (results not shown). Indeed, the BCA addition induces the production of a lower quality gasoline having a higher content of aliphatic compounds and an overall higher proportion of high molecular weight hydrocarbons. On the contrary, the LCO pool quality is very likely improved by the BCA addition, increasing the proportion of aliphatic and mono-aromatic compounds and limiting the proportion of polycyclic hydrocarbons.
3.2. Influence of the single Propylene Booster separate particle additive addition
In this part of the investigation, the single addition of 10 wt% of a commercially available Propylene Booster additive (see characteristics in Table 1) has been studied in order to estimate the efficiency and dilution effect when cracking various feedstocks having different properties. The used ZSM-5 additive has a crystal content of 25 wt% and the prepared catalytic system has therefore a ZSM-5 crystal content of 2.5 wt%. Fig. 7 shows the effect of the physical blend addition of 10 wt% of Propylene Booster additive to an USY equilibrium FCC catalyst on the catalytic activity of the catalytic system determined in a Micro-Downer reactor processing different feedstocks (see characteristics in Table 2). Experimental conditions were as follows: 530 °C reaction temperature, 2 s catalyst residence time, 500 °C stripper temperature, 250 °C feed preheating temperature and catalyst-to-oil ratio range from 4 to 17 g/g (varying the amount of injected catalyst and keeping constant the flow of injected feedstock (i.e. 3.0 g/min)).

Fig. 7. Comparison of the Micro-Downer activity (measured by crackability) as a function of the catalyst-to-oil ratio for the pure reference equilibrium USY catalyst and the USY/ZSM-5 blend when processing different feedstocks.
As one can see, independently of the nature of the processed feedstock, the incorporation of 10 wt% of ZSM-5 based additive to an equilibrium USY catalyst does not cause important dilution effects and the USY/ZSM-5 blend is at least as active as the pure equilibrium catalyst. Yields at constant conversion of 60 wt% are shown in Table 6. According to the results, and as observed by various authors [2], [17], [20], the use of ZSM-5 additive, independently of the processed feedstock, allows to significantly increase the coke and gases (specially LPG) selectivities, at the expense mainly of gasoline (above all light gasoline) and to a lesser extent of LCO. Nevertheless, the nature of the feedstock can have some impact on the product selectivity observed when using an Ecat/ZSM-5 blend as catalyst. For instance, contrary to what it is observed when processing heavy feedstocks (i.e. B and C), it appears that ZSM-5 additive incorporation when processing the light feedstock A also improves, in a surprising way, the Bottom Cracking ability of the catalytic system. Concerning coke selectivity, the amplitude of the coke selectivity increase observed when using ZSM-5 additive looks like also rather dependent on the nature of the processed feedstock. Thus, processing the feedstocks which have the higher aromatic character (i.e. A and C), the coke selectivity increases up to 10% on relative bases due to the ZSM-5 additive incorporation, while when processing the more paraffinic feedstock (i.e. B), the coke selectivity increase is representatively higher and reaches close to 20%.

Values relative to Base USY.
In addition, the propylene-to-i-butene ratio (see Table 6), representative of how deeply ZSM-5 cracks into the available gasoline pool olefin mixture previously produced by the USY catalyst [20], suggests that the Propylene Booster additive plays well its role as promoter for the formation of light alkenes. Moreover, the representative increase of the Hydrogen Transfer Index (HTI) indicates a lower hydrogen transfer activity of the catalytic system which includes the ZSM-5 additive, and consequently the proportion of unsaturated molecules is clearly favored by the ZSM-5 addition. This is confirmed by the detailed study of the C2–C5 hydrocarbons (see Fig. 8) which shows that, in all cases, the yield of C2 to C4 alkenes and the olefin to paraffin ratio in each of those hydrocarbon fractions, increase at constant conversion level when using ZSM-5 additive. On the other hand, C5 alkenes yield does not seem greatly influenced by the incorporation of the additive. These observations would be in accordance with the already mentioned kinetic mechanism by which the hydrothermally deactivated ZSM-5 combined with USY catalysts works [24], [25], and which states that skeletal isomerization is energetically favored by ZSM-5 additive for lower carbon number carbenium ions, while higher carbon number carbenium ions formed from the gasoline pool olefins previously produced by the USY equilibrium catalyst are preferably cracked to C2–C4 olefins and that C5 olefins are simultaneously formed and consumed by the ZSM-5 additive.

Nevertheless, even if the observed effects caused by the incorporation of ZSM-5 additive to an equilibrium FCC catalyst on the C2–C5 fractions olefins content have the same trends for all the tested feedstocks, the amplitude of those effects seems very dependent of the nature of the processed feedstock. Indeed, if for the light paraffinic VGO (feedstock A), a relative increase of the yields of ethylene, propylene, butenes and pentenes of respectively 158, 183, 62 and 10% is observed at constant conversion of 60 wt%, the heavy paraffinic VGO (feedstock B) seems to favor a bit more the production of the higher carbon number olefins with an increase of 71, 146, 69 and 29% respectively. Concerning feedstock C (paraffinic atmospheric residue), the ethylene, propylene, butenes and pentenes yields relative increase reaches 107, 140, 45 and −7% respectively. In general, it can be noticed that paraffinic feeds have a higher potential for producing short chain olefins than aromatic feeds and, consequently, an optimum ZSM-5 addition rate level exists in function of the chemical composition of each one of the processed feedstocks. In other words and as stated by Adewuyi et al. [18], paraffinic feedstocks very likely need higher ZSM-5 additive levels than aromatic feedstocks to fully maximize the C6–C7 to C3–C4 alkenes shift.
By means of two-dimensional gas chromatography technique, the gasoline and LCO pool product and molecular weight distribution have been obtained for the cracked products on the equilibrium USY based catalyst (Ecat) and the Ecat/ZSM-5 blend, and the results are compared in Fig. 9, Fig. 10. The results shown in Fig. 9 illustrate the typical effects of the addition of 10 wt% of ZSM-5 additive to the tested equilibrium USY catalyst on the composition and distribution of hydrocarbons in gasoline. The same trends are observed independently of the nature of the processed feedstock, even if the amplitude of the effect is more marked when the processed feedstock is lighter. As expected, ZSM-5 additive has a huge impact on the gasoline composition (Fig. 9A, C and E) and hydrocarbons distribution (Fig. 9B, D and F). As one can see, ZSM-5 addition strongly limits the proportion of aliphatic compounds, and in particular of C5+ olefins, promoting the proportion of aromatic hydrocarbons and to a lesser extent of naphthenic-aromatic molecules. The increase in aromatics (on gasoline basis) is principally due to concentration effects [2]. This effect implies that due to the fact that ZSM-5 additive consumes preferentially the low molecular weight gasoline olefins (i.e. C6–C7) for the production of lighter LPG pool olefins, the proportion of high molecular weight (i.e. C9–C11) and aromatic molecules is favored in the gasoline pool and the overall gasoline selectivity is negatively affected. Thus, the results clearly confirm the octane number promoter role of the ZSM-5 additive, improving from that point of view the quality of the produced FCC gasoline.

Fig. 10. Effects of the addition of 10 wt% of ZSM-5 additive to an equilibrium USY catalyst on the LCO pool composition at constant conversion level of 60 wt% for different processed feedstocks.
Concerning LCO pool composition, one can appreciate in Fig. 10A, C and E that the impact of the ZSM-5 additive incorporation on the overall LCO pool product distribution is feed dependent. Indeed, if for the light paraffinic VGO (feedstock A) almost no changes of the LCO pool composition are observed when introducing the ZSM-5 additive, changes of the LCO pool composition due to the ZSM-5 additive can be appreciated when processing the heavy paraffinic VGO (feedstock B) and the paraffinic atmospheric residue (feedstock C). The main impact of the additive corresponds to the increase of the bi-aromatic hydrocarbons content at the expenses of aliphatic compounds. In addition, the molecular weight distribution of the LCO pool does not seem to be greatly affected by the ZSM-5 additive (see Fig. 10B, D and F). Thus, in general, it can be concluded that the incorporation of ZSM-5 additive to an equilibrium USY catalyst should have, in the best case scenario, a neutral impact and, more probably, a negative impact on the quality of the LCO formed.
3.3. Influence of the combined addition of Bottom Cracking and Propylene Booster in the form of separate particle additives
The effect of the combined addition of Bottom Cracking and ZSM-5 additives to an USY Ecat during FCC operation has been studied here using the same equilibrium FCC catalyst and additives than before. According to the results previously obtained and in order to keep an acceptable catalytic activity and to optimize the efficiency of the different added additives, it was decided to prepare a catalytic system by physically blending a basic proportion of 30/60/10 wt% of Ecat/BCA/ZSM-5 respectively. The influence of the composition of blend on the catalytic activity performance was tested in a Micro-Downer reactor processing different feedstocks (see characteristics in Table 2). Table 7 summarizes the different catalysts prepared by physical blend. The reaction conditions were as follows: 530 °C reaction temperature, 2 s catalyst residence time, 500 °C stripper temperature, 250 °C feed preheating temperature and catalyst-to-oil ratio range from 4 to 17 g/g (generated by varying the amount of injected catalyst and keeping constant the flow of injected feedstock (i.e. 3.0 g/min)).

CS-4 40 wt% 0 wt% 60 wt% Single addition of BCA additive to an Ecat catalyst.
CS-5 0 wt% 0 wt% 100 wt% Pure Bottom Cracking additive.
As shown in Fig. 11, the influence of the simultaneous addition of both additives to an equilibrium FCC catalyst, in the basic proportions (i.e. 30/60/10 wt% of Ecat/BCA/ZSM-5 respectively), on the catalytic activity of the catalytic system is feed dependent. Indeed, while in the particular case of the light paraffinic VGO (feedstock A – see Fig. 11A), a representative decrease of the catalytic activity, likely due to dilution effects, is observed, the processing of the heavy paraffinic VGO and paraffinic atmospheric residue (feedstocks B and C – see Fig. 11B and C) does not show any significant catalytic activity penalty compared to the pure USY Ecat. Nevertheless, as previously observed, we know that independently of the nature of the processed feedstock, the single addition of a high level of Bottom Cracking additive to an equilibrium catalyst limits greatly the overall FCC catalytic activity of the catalytic system. Thus, in the case of the heavy feedstocks B and C, we can suspect that a synergic effect induced by the simultaneous presence of both additives occurs and the deleterious effect of the BCA additive is almost completely compensated by the beneficial effect of the ZSM-5 additive.

Concerning selectivities, Table 8 compares the product yields, at constant conversion, between the equilibrium USY catalyst and the composite catalytic system when processing three different feedstocks (see characteristics in Table 2). According to results, the efficiency of the ZSM-5 additive does not look particularly affected by the simultaneous presence of the Bottom Cracking additive in the catalytic system and, compared to the pure equilibrium USY catalyst, the yield of gases (mainly the LPG yield), propylene-to-i-butene ratio, and products olefinity (see Hydrogen Transfer Index), at constant conversion level, are in all cases highly improved at the expense of the gasoline yield (mainly light gasoline). The changes in trend and magnitude of gases when using the composite catalytic system are very similar to the ones observed in the case of the single addition of ZSM-5 additive (see CS-3 in Table 8), even if the Bottom Cracking additive is also very likely involved in the little but representative increase of the dry gases yield, due to the enhancement of the thermal cracking contribution when using high addition level of BCA additive. This is also confirmed by the detailed comparison of the yields of light gases at constant conversion level (see Fig. 12). It can be see there that the selectivity and olefinity of each fraction (i.e. from C2 to C5) obtained with the Ecat/BCA/ZSM-5 blend is very similar to the one obtained with the Ecat/ZSM-5 catalytic system.

Two-dimensional gas chromatography analysis of liquid effluents shows that the composition and molecular weight distribution (see Fig. 13) of the gasoline pool produced when using the composite catalytic system are qualitatively and quantitatively identical than the ones previously observed for the Ecat/ZSM-5 blend. That is to say that due to the preferential consumption by the ZSM-5 additive of the previously produced C5–C7 gasoline pool olefins to form lighter olefins and in particular propylene, concentration effects occur and the gasoline pool produced has a higher mean molecular weight and a representative higher proportion of aromatic compounds. We can then conclude that the quality improvement of the gasoline pool and the C5–C7 to C3–C4 alkenes shift induced by the use of the ZSM-5 additive are practically the same regardless of the incorporation or not of the Bottom Cracking additive.

The Bottom Cracking additive which is present in the composite catalytic system looks able to representatively increase the bottom conversion, favoring the LCO selectivity and limiting the bottom fraction selectivity, even if the amplitude of the observed effects is feed dependent (see Table 8). Moreover, according to the two-dimensional gas chromatography analysis (see Fig. 14), we can say that the previously observed negative impact of the ZSM-5 based additive on the LCO pool quality (i.e. lower proportion of aliphatic compounds and higher proportion of bi-aromatic hydrocarbons) is partially or even completely compensated by the Bottom Cracking influence and the proportion of high molecular weight hydrocarbons (i.e. > C15) in the LCO pool is slightly improved when using the composite catalytic system. Finally, dehydrogenation reactions which are at the origin of the coke production, is logically increased by the presence of the additives, even if the increase amplitude stays relatively limited and feed dependent (Table 8). In this case, the observed effect seems to correspond at the sum of the individual effects of each additive, BCA additive being the main responsible of the increase in coke selectivity observed.

4. Conclusions
This study has assessed the effects of the single and combined addition of different amounts of Bottom Cracking and ZSM-5 based additives to an USY equilibrium catalyst in a FCC unit. It was shown that BCA additive has a very low catalytic activity and can hardly be used as standalone FCC catalyst. It is then necessary to use this one as separate particle additive of a conventional FCC USY catalyst in order to keep an economically acceptable conversion. It appears that the single addition of the BCA additive to an equilibrium USY catalyst starts to representatively improve the Bottom Cracking ability of the catalytic system for BCA contents higher than 50 wt%, even if the observed effects are very feed dependent. Nevertheless, and due to the less catalytically active BCA, the higher bottom conversion is accompanied by an increase of the thermal cracking versus catalytic cracking ratio, leading to a higher selectivity of dry gases and coke, while gasoline selectivity is negatively affected. In addition, due to the low density of active sites of the BCA additive, high addition levels limits the hydrogen transfer activity of the catalytic system and the carbenium ion cracking mechanism involving in particular tertiary carbenium ions, implying respectively a higher proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbons and a lower proportion of branched compounds in the FCC products. Detailed comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography analysis of liquid effluents suggests that the use of BCA additive has a negative impact on the gasoline quality, limiting the proportion of aromatics hydrocarbons and of branched linear hydrocarbons. On the contrary, BCA additive seems to significantly improve the LCO quality, limiting the proportion of low cetane number hydrocarbons such as bi-aromatics, in favor of aliphatic and mono-aromatic compounds.
On the other hand, the use of ZSM-5 in USY catalyst/ZSM-5 additive combinations has shown to be very efficient for light alkenes make, even if the amplitude of the effects is quite dependent of the ability of the feedstock/equilibrium USY catalyst pair to produce C5+ gasoline boiling range aliphatics and an optimum additive content very likely exists in function of the nature of the used USY catalyst and processed feed. Due to the preferential consumption of the low octane number C5+ aliphatics compounds by the ZSM-5 based additive, the gasoline pool selectivity is representatively negatively affected and concentration effects imply a higher proportion of aromatic hydrocarbons in the gasoline pool and consequently the overall gasoline pool quality is drastically improved (well known octane booster role). In addition, the Bottom Cracking ability of the catalytic system is generally lower when using ZSM-5 additive, and the LCO selectivity and quality are generally negatively affected because of the higher proportion of aromatic compounds (particularly bi-aromatics) in the diesel boiling range. These changes should be due to the fact that ZSM-5 additive could representatively affect the ring-opening mechanism kinetic of the catalytic system. Dry gases and coke selectivities are also increased, even if the order of magnitude of the observed increase is relatively limited.
Finally, the combined use of BCA and ZSM-5 additives allows to take advantage of the individual beneficial effects of each one of the additives without penalized too much the overall catalytic activity. It is then possible to use a composite catalytic system in the FCC unit which allows to greatly optimize at the same time the production of light alkenes and good quality diesel pool, producing less gasoline but with an improved quality, without increasing too much the dry gases and coke selectivities. As, at least in Europe, the demand for middle distillates is strongly increasing at the expense of the gasoline, this possibility seems a good opportunity in order to try to better fit the FCC production with the current market demand. It is nevertheless important to notice that further investigations are necessary in order to estimate, in particular, if the proposed catalytic blend keeps its efficiency in presence of metal contaminants and to see if this one is able to reasonably limit the higher coke and dry gases selectivities induced by the metal deposition.

    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
