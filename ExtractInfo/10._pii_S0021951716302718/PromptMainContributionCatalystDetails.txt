Abstract
The propane dehydrogenation (PDH) behavior of gallosilicate MFI catalysts synthesized in the presence of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) is investigated. MPS addition to the zeolite synthesis gel results in gallosilicate molecular sieves with reduced Brønsted acidity and enhanced Lewis acidity, as shown by combined NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), isopropylamine (IPA) TPD and IR analysis of pyridine-loaded catalysts. In particular, the gallosilicate MFI catalysts prepared using MPS provide a significant concentration of strong Lewis acid sites, which are important in controlling the selectivity of PDH. Enhanced PDH performance with higher propane conversion rates and improved propylene selectivity with limited cracking and aromatization products are obtained from the catalysts synthesized with MPS. The gallosilicate MFI materials prepared using MPS are compared with a benchmark chromia-alumina catalyst, and the gallosilicate materials have a lower rate of deactivation (>50% lower) but slightly inferior propylene selectivity (Ga-MFI: 75%; Chromia-Alumina: 85%).

1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important feedstocks for the production of valuable polymers such as poly(propylene) and chemicals such as acrylonitrile and 2-propanol. The production of propylene from catalytic dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) is carried out commercially by the Catofin process from CB&I Lummus [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] and the Oleflex process from UOP [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. The Catofin process uses a Cr-based catalyst in multiple parallel fixed bed reactors, while the Oleflex process uses a Pt-based catalyst in a fluidized bed reactor [14], [15]. Both processes inevitably undergo rapid catalyst deactivation. PDH processes have received renewed attention in recent years, especially in North America and the Middle East, due to abundant supplies of propane, and there are renewed efforts aimed at discovering new PDH catalysts or improving the stability, activity, and selectivity of known PDH catalysts. Propane feedstocks can be also applied in propane aromatization processes to produce benzene, toluene, and xylene. Ga-modified MFI zeolite catalysts have been widely used in the UOP/BP Cyclar dehydrocyclization process [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Ga-containing zeolites synthesized by impregnation or ion-exchange into aluminosilicate H-ZSM-5 have been extensively studied [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. Gallosilicate MFI can also be obtained by isomorphous substitution of Ga in the MFI zeolite framework [32], [33], since Ga can be easily incorporated in the MFI framework.
In an early report, Bayense et al. reported that the specific synthesis method used for Ga incorporation into HZSM-5 did not have much effect on the propane conversion, but incorporation of Ga increased the aromatic selectivity in all cases [24]. They also suggested that Ga-loaded H-ZSM-5 was better than the pure gallosilicate for propane aromatization. However, other studies have reported that H-gallosilicate showed higher propane aromatization selectivities than Ga ion-exchanged/impregnated H-ZSM-5 [34], [35], [36]. A reaction mechanism of propane aromatization using Ga loaded HZSM-5 was suggested by Giannetto et al. [37]. In this pathway, propane is first protonated on Brønsted acid sites where it undergoes either a dehydrogenation or a cracking step. A carbenium ion intermediate formed by the dehydrogenation pathway is then converted into propylene, followed by oligomerization and cyclization to aromatics at the Brønsted acid sites. In propane aromatization, PDH is a primary step, as discussed in detail by Meriaudeau and Naccache [23], [38]. They proposed a bifunctional mechanism during the PDH step when both Ga oxide species (Ga2O3) and Brønsted acid sites in the MFI pores are present. The strength of the Brønsted acid sites depends on the types of heteroatoms in the framework, and it is known that bridged framework Ga provides lower acidity than Al [39]. It has been suggested that the Lewis acid sites are related to positively charged oxide clusters in zeolite pore structures, normally extra-framework species [39]. During the synthesis of gallosilicate molecular sieves, the trivalent Ga3+ species not incorporated in the framework remain in the zeolite channels as highly dispersed oxide species [40]. Extra-framework Ga species can also be formed by degalliation of framework Ga, and the role of these species on PDH has been discussed [33], [37], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Choudhary et al. reported the formation of extra-framework Ga by heat treatment and suggested that extra-framework Ga should be the main active site for PDH whereas framework Ga species were much less active [42], [43]. The relation between propane conversion and propylene/aromatic selectivity was studied by Guisnet et al. where high propylene selectivities (>70%) were observed at low conversion levels (<5%). At high conversions (>20%), there was more than 50% selectivity to aromatics [44]. Although the aforementioned studies assumed that the extra-framework Ga species were present in the zeolite pores, Ga oxide domains have also been found on the outer surface of zeolites upon calcination, with the oxide clusters being 3–10 nm in size [45].
Although extra-framework Ga species are considered to be the main active sites for PDH [37], [42], [43], [46], direct characterization of these sites can be challenging. For instance, it is difficult to detect small amounts of extra-framework Ga species by Ga-NMR due to strong quadrupolar effects since the sites are mainly in low-symmetry environments [40], [47], [48], [49]. There have been several attempts to investigate the presence of extra-framework Ga species by temperature programmed desorption techniques, which confirmed their strong Lewis acidic properties [22], [31], [50], [51]. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) has also been used for characterization of acid sites in Ga-MFI [27], [31], [32], [48], [52], [53], [54]. Otero Areán et al. studied the Brønsted acid IR band associated with framework Ga in the hydroxyl stretching region and showed its decreased intensity with increased preheating temperature [52]. Rodrigues et al. reported the presence of strong Lewis acid sites in Ga/H-ZSM-5 as demonstrated by adsorbed pyridine that remained even at high temperatures (673 K) [31]. The authors suggested that the highly dispersed Ga species would be related to the strong Lewis acid sites.
From the above discussion, it is evident that most of the previous work on propane conversion in Ga-containing MFI catalysts has focused on maximizing aromatic selectivity. Several reports have discussed the initial PDH step in the propane aromatization sequence, but only at low propane conversions. For instance, Meriaudeau et al. carried out propane dehydrogenation at low conversions (<1%) using HZSM-5 and gallosilicate [40]. Hart et al. focused on preparation of selective dehydrogenation catalysts by Ga and in addition to H-ZSM-5 with few or no zeolite protonic sites [55]. Ga-modified MFI catalysts have not been widely studied for PDH due to the low propylene selectivities observed at high conversions. Here, we report a synthesis method that creates Ga Lewis acid sites in aluminum-free, gallosilicate MFI without post-treatments such as Ga impregnation, ion-exchange or heat treatment. Specifically, 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane (MPS) was used as a functional silane during the gallosilicate MFI zeolite synthesis. Previously, MPS has been used to incorporate metal and metal sulfide clusters such as Pt, Rh, Ag, and CdS in MFI, SOD, GIS and LTA zeolite channels [56], [57], [58]. It was proposed that the Si species in MPS are incorporated into the zeolite framework after hydrolysis of the trimethoxy groups while preserving the Si-mercaptopropyl linkage. At the same time, the thiol group on the 3-mercaptopropyl moiety interacts with metallic ions (such as Pt2+ or Cd2+) in the zeolite synthesis solution (or gel), thereby facilitating their occlusion in the zeolite pores during crystallization. We report a detailed structural and catalytic (PDH) characterization of Ga-MFI catalysts prepared by this technique, based upon the hypothesis that the altered mechanisms of Ga incorporation induced by the addition of MPS would lead to a different acid site profiles and catalytic behavior. In this regard, the new gallosilicate MFI catalysts prepared by MPS addition are shown (via FTIR characterization of pyridine adsorption as well as temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia and isopropylamine) to possess lower Brønsted acid site concentrations and enhanced Lewis acid site concentrations compared to the catalyst prepared in the conventional way, without MPS addition. These catalysts prepared in the presence of MPS give higher propylene selectivities and enhanced propane conversion rates at a fixed propylene conversion level.

2.1. Catalyst preparation
The catalysts prepared and used in this study are listed in Table 1. All samples were calcined at 823 K for 10 h prior to use as catalysts. Details of their preparation are described below.

MG11 MPS-Gallosilicate TPA-Gallosilicate 1.1 None

GS Ga/pure-silica MFI TPA-silica MFI No MPS addition Ga impregnation
Gallosilicate MFI with MPS (MG05, MG11, MG16): MPS-Ga MFI was prepared based on a typical hydrothermal zeolite MFI synthesis with the additions of 3-mercaptopropyl-trimethoxysilane precursor (MPS, 95%, Sigma–Aldrich) and Ga nitrate as a metal source. First, 10.2 g of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, 98% reagent grade, Sigma–Aldrich) was added to 16 g of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 1 M Sigma–Aldrich) solution with 27 g of DI water, followed by stirring overnight. Then, MPS was added to the solution and stirred for 3 h. Subsequently, 0.5 g Ga nitrate (Ga(NO3)3·xH2O, 99.9%, Sigma–Aldrich) was added and the mixture was kept stirring for an additional 3 h. The final molar composition was 1 SiO2:0.32 TPAOH:45.4 DI water, with the MPS amount adjusted to achieve different MPS/Ga ratios. Three gallosilicates were synthesized, namely MG05, MG11, and MG16 for which MPS/Ga ratios in the synthesis gel were 0.54, 1.1 and 1.6 respectively. The solution was heated at 423 K for 4 days in a Teflon-lined autoclave. The obtained zeolite crystals were washed with DI water, recovered by centrifugation, and dried overnight at 343 K, followed by calcination at 823 K for 10 h under static air conditions with a heating rate of 1.5 K/min.
Gallosilicate MFI without MPS (MG0): For a comparison, another type of gallosilicate MFI with no addition of MPS (MG0) was also prepared by the same method as MPS-Ga MFI but without the MPS addition step.
Ga impregnated pure-silica MFI (Ga/pure-silica MFI, GS): Ga impregnated into the pure-silica MFI zeolite was also prepared. Pure-silica MFI was synthesized with the same synthesis method as MPS-gallosilicate MFI without addition of Ga nitrate and MPS. Then Ga impregnated pure-silica MFI was prepared by wet impregnation of Ga nitrate in ethanol solution followed by drying in a rotary evaporator and calcination under the conditions noted above.
Chromia-alumina: For a comparison with Cr catalyst similar to those applied commercially, a Na-doped chromia-on-alumina catalyst was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with a composition of 20 wt.% Cr and 1 wt.% Na. A solution of Cr (III) oxide (Cr2O3, ⩾98%, Sigma–Aldrich) was dropped onto an alumina (Al2O3, 98%, Sasol) support, followed by drying overnight at 383 K and calcination at 773 K for 30 h. Prior to loading the Cr onto the support, a Na nitrate (NaNO3, ⩾99.0%, Sigma–Aldrich) solution was added dropwise to the alumina support and dried.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out with a PANalytical XPert PRO diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with a scan step size of 0.0167° in a 2θ range of 5–50°. The shape and size of the particles were characterized with a Hitachi SU8010 cold field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). The surface area, micro- and meso-pore volumes were obtained from N2-physisorption measurements at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. The samples were degassed at 473 K for 12 h and free space analysis was performed using He prior to N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm measurements for more accurate micropore analysis. The samples were again degassed at 473 K to remove entrapped He before micropore analysis. The strength and concentration of the acid sites were determined by temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) in an U-shaped fixed bed reactor using a Micromeritics Autochem II. The sample (about 0.11 g, 212–400 μm pellet size) was preheated at 773 K for 1 h followed by NH3 injection at 373 K and holding for 1 h. Helium was used as the carrier gas at 25 mL STP/min. The temperature was then elevated to 873 K at a ramping rate of 10 K/min and the desorbed NH3 was detected by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The TCD was pre-calibrated with known concentrations of NH3. The concentration of Brønsted acid sites was also measured by temperature-programmed desorption of isopropylamine (IPA-TPD) [59], [60], [61]. A sample (0.1 g) was loaded in a fixed bed and activated at 773 K for 3 h with 100 mL/min of N2 flow to remove remaining water. After cooling to 373 K, 50 μL of IPA was introduced into the N2 carrier gas flow followed by overnight continuous N2 flow to remove physisorbed IPA. Then, the TPD measurements were carried out at a heating rate of 10 K/min and the concentration of desorbed propylene resulting from decomposed from IPA on the Brønsted acid sites was recorded using Pfeiffer Vacuum mass spectrometer (MS), which was also pre-calibrated with known concentrations of propylene. Elemental analysis for Ga and Si content was carried out by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ALS Environmental, AZ) to ascertain the composition of each catalyst sample. For the materials synthesized in the presence of MPS, analysis for S was also completed by combustion at 1573 K followed by infrared spectroscopy detection (ALS Environmental, AZ). Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of 29Si and 71Ga were obtained on a Bruker Avance III 400 spectrometer at a sample spinning speed 10 kHz. The 29Si NMR spectra were referenced with respect to 3-(trimethylsilyl)-1-propanesulfonic acid at 0 ppm. For the 71Ga NMR spectra, aqueous Ga(NO3)3 solution at 0 ppm was used for calibration. UV–Vis spectra were measured using a Cary 5000 UV–Vis–NIR spectrometer (Agilent Technologies). Powder zeolite samples were added to the sample holder after grinding using a mortar and pestle. The UV–vis absorption spectra were measured in the wavelength range between 200 and 800 nm, with a resolution of 1 nm.
The concentrations and ratios of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites were estimated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) of samples containing adsorbed pyridine on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet 8700 spectrometer. The catalysts were activated at 773 K under vacuum for 6 h. A background spectrum was measured after cooling down to 423 K and then pyridine was admitted to the catalyst at the same temperature. The FT-IR spectra of hydroxyl stretching region were also obtained before dosing of pyridine. The pyridine was adsorbed for 1 h to allow equilibration, and the physisorbed pyridine was removed under vacuum at 10−6 mbar overnight. The FT-IR spectra of the pyridine adsorbed samples were measured at 423 K after evacuation at different temperatures, specifically 423, 523, 623, and 723 K.
2.4. Catalytic measurements
Catalytic PDH was performed at 873 K under atmospheric pressure. The catalyst (212–400 μm pellet size) was placed in an U-shaped quartz tube fixed bed reactor (3 mm inner diameter) and heated under N2 (UHP grade, Airgas) flow to the reaction temperature in a fluidized sand bath furnace (Techne FB-08). The concentration of C3H8 in the feed was 5% with the balance N2. The catalyst bed was fixed between two pieces of quartz wool and the amounts of each catalyst sample were adjusted for similar conversion level (∼7%). Hence the lengths of catalyst bed were varied from 0.3 to 1 cm. The total feed flow rate was 20 mL STP/min. Since all the catalyst samples were pelletized and sieved, a similar level of external mass transfer resistance, if any, is expected at the same gas flow velocity. Also effects of internal mass transfer are not suggested to be significant using the employed experimental conditions (Supplementary Material). During the PDH reaction, the product stream was analyzed by an on-line GC (Shimadzu GC2014) using a flame ionization detector (FID) for hydrocarbon products and thermal conductivity detector (TCD) for H2. The propane conversion, product selectivities and product yield were calculated based on the feed conditions and the concentration of the products as follows:
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physical properties
The MFI structure was confirmed by XRD for all the zeolite catalysts used in this study. Comparing the pure-silica and gallosilicate MFI samples, the intensities of the diffraction peaks decreased with Ga incorporation (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). All the gallosilicate MFI samples showed similar crystallinity, although MPS addition slightly decreased peak intensities (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2). Most of the gallosilicate MFI catalysts showed small spherical crystallite shapes (Fig. 1), which has also been observed in past studies [36], [51], [62]. The GS material formed particles with very similar shape to our pure-silica MFI (Fig. 1). The particle sizes were mostly ca. 200 nm for all the materials, with no significant difference caused by different amounts of MPS added. The physical properties of the catalysts are summarized in Table 2. No significant qualitative trend was observed in micropore volume and surface area of the MG materials. A slightly different range of pore volume and surface area was observed for the GS and pure-silica MFI samples compared with the MG materials, which is probably due to the different preparation methods employed. The Si/Ga ratio was obtained by ICP-OES analysis, and all the catalysts showed similar total Ga content.

3.2. Acid site measurements
The NH3-TPD profiles of the gallosilicate MFI materials (MG) synthesized with and without MPS addition were compared. In Fig. 2, both low temperature (l-peak at 450 K) and high temperature (h-peak at 580 K) features were observed for all the profiles except the GS sample. The l-peak is attributed to sites where ammonia is physisorbed and weakly held [45], [51]. The h-peak corresponds to Brønsted acid sites generated after TPA ion removal during calcination.

Furthermore, additional peak shoulders at higher temperatures (ca. 700 K) were observed. These features were also reported in past studies and were assigned to strong Lewis acid Ga species [31], [51]. Miyamoto et al. observed a similar peak shoulder at 700–900 K in NH3-TPD profiles of materials with increased Ga content, and also found an additional h-peak when Ga was impregnated into the gallosilicate. Rodrigues et al. confirmed the presence of strong Lewis acid sites in Ga impregnated H-ZSM-5 in which a significant TCD signal in the NH3-TPD experiment still remained at temperatures of more than 800 K, whereas the signal returned to the baseline in the case of H-ZSM-5. In both the above studies, Ga impregnated into pure-silica MFI did not yield a material with strong Lewis acidity, indicating that the presence of Brønsted acid sites was necessary to generate the strong Lewis acid sites during Ga incorporation. Rodrigues et al. suggested from their EXAFS spectra of Ga/H-ZSM-5 that atomically dispersed oxidic Ga species in ion-exchange positions should be ascribed to the strong Lewis acid sites, whose concentration increased with the number of framework Al sites. From the TPD profiles of the MG materials in this study, the intensity of the high-temperature shoulder increased with the amount of MPS added in the synthesis gel. This suggests that the thiol group in the MPS ligand interacts with Ga in the zeolite synthesis gel, thereby influencing the speciation of Ga in the final material. Specifically, MPS-induced formation of extra-framework Ga sites is hypothesized. Based on the fact that the TPD peak intensities at 550 K showed almost no difference with and without MPS addition, it appears that the MPS ligand had little effect on the formation of framework Ga Brønsted sites. This is consistent with the proposed mechanism of metal incorporation via MPS, which is expected to result in enhanced incorporation in the pores rather than in the framework. Considering the proposed bifunctional reaction mechanism of PDH requiring both Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, where Lewis acid sites play a crucial role, the MG materials in this study were thought to be good candidates for PDH, since they provide a greater number of strong Lewis acid sites even without post-synthesis impregnation or heat treatment steps.
Ammonia TPD analysis does not provide any information distinguishing Lewis versus Brønsted acid sites in the absence of supporting data from other techniques. To this end, the acid site distribution of an MG catalyst (MG11) containing adsorbed pyridine was analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy alongside the spectrum of the catalyst made without MPS addition (MG0). The FT-IR spectra of the materials before pyridine dosing are displayed in Fig. 3. In the hydroxyl stretching region from 3000 to 3750 cm−1, a peak at 3617 cm−1 was observed for all catalysts, indicating that they have bridged Brønsted acid sites due to framework Ga [32], [40], [52]. The higher frequency of these Brønsted acid sites than typical Al bridged protonic sites has for decades been used to suggest a less acidic character of the Ga bridged sites [32], although more recently it has been suggested that the deprotonation energies of hetero-atom bridged sites do not correlate with the OH frequency [63]. Nonetheless, considering the higher deprotonation energy of Ga bridged acid sites than Al sites reported in a related study [64], one may still conclude that the strength of the Brønsted acid sites of gallosilicate MFI is lower than Al-MFI type zeolites. For all the MG samples shown in Fig. 3, there is a broad band between 3000 and 3600 cm−1 corresponding to hydrogen bonded silanol groups in hydroxyl nests in defect sites associated with missing T atoms [52]. It should be noted that in Fig. 3 the broad bands shift right for the sample without MPS addition (e.g., MG0). Similar peak shifts have previously been observed in the literature [65], where the peak position of the broad band (3000–3600 cm−1) moved to lower frequencies with more framework Al sites. Hence, this shift might be interpreted that samples made with added MPS have less framework Brønsted acid sites, which can be replaced by defect sites for charge balancing the organic structure-directing agent during synthesis. Another peak previously assigned to hydroxyl groups attached to extra-framework Ga at 3660–3670 cm−1 was also observed [31], [48], [52], [53], but the peak overlapped with isolated and terminal silanol groups at 3720 and 3740 cm−1 [31], [52].

FT-IR spectra of the catalysts containing adsorbed pyridine were also measured after evacuation at temperatures of 423, 523, 623, and 723 K. The peak at ca. 1540 cm−1 corresponds to the pyridinium ion, PyH+, formed after pyridine interacts with Brønsted acid sites. Pyridine adsorbed on Lewis acid sites gives a characteristic band at ca. 1450 cm−1 [31], [51]. The band at ca. 1445 cm−1 has been assigned to hydrogen bonded pyridine [51]. As shown in Fig. 4, significant intensity of the 1458 cm−1 band associated with Lewis acid sites still remained after evacuation at high temperatures up to 723 K, indicating the presence of some very strong Lewis acid sites, which is consistent with the profiles (Fig. 2) from NH3-TPD. Similar results were previously observed when Ga was impregnated into HZSM-5 and the strong Lewis acid sites were assigned to highly dispersed Ga species [31], [51]. The above findings clearly confirm key differences in the acid site distribution between the gallosilicate MFI materials prepared with and without MPS addition. The ratio of the concentrations of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites (B/L) was obtained for each material by using integrated molar extinction coefficients for MFI zeolites from the literature [66]. Fig. 5 quantifies the difference in B/L ratio among the gallosilicate MFI materials. MPS addition led to a greater number of strong Lewis acid sites, thus decreasing the B/L ratio.

Temperature-programmed desorption of isopropylamine (IPA-TPD) was also carried out to assess the concentration of Brønsted acid sites present at low and moderate desorption temperatures, independent of the Lewis acid sites (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3). In the IPA-TPD profiles of MG samples, the main peak in the temperature range 600–700 K is assigned to propylene from adsorbed IPA on the Brønsted acid sites [59], [60], [61], while the peak below 600 K is assigned to propylene from weakly held IPA adsorbed on internal or external silanol groups [67]. In MG samples, there was an additional peak shoulder at high temperature, above 700 K, where the peak intensities increase in samples prepared with greater MPS addition. Similar peak trends were also observed for the ammonia signal (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3b) along with simultaneous propylene detection, which means that the peak shoulder at high temperature is likely associated with decomposed IPA. A similar peak at high temperature was also previously reported for the reduced form of Ga impregnated H-ZSM-5 [68], [69]. According to Ausavasukhi et al. the new peak at high temperature was observed after reduction of Ga/H-ZSM-5 in H2 while no peak was seen in the same temperature range without H2 treatment. The authors suggested that the peak is associated with hydroxyl groups on extra-framework Ga-OH sites. Considering that the peak shoulder intensities of the MG materials increased with MPS content in the synthesis gel, the MG materials may have such extra-framework Ga-OH species interacting with IPA.
The acid site measurements are summarized in Table 3. The acid site concentrations were determined by a combination of IPA-TPD-MS, pyridine IR, and NH3-TPD, as mentioned above. The concentration of Brønsted acid sites was measured by IPA-TPD-MS by calibrating the propylene concentrations in the MS. Similarly the total acid site concentrations were also quantified from NH3-TPD by NH3 calibration in the TCD after deconvolution of the main peak at 550 K and high temperature peak shoulder. The two acid sites are suggested to be associated with adsorbed NH3 on the Brønsted acid sites (low temperature) and the strong Lewis acidic Ga sites (high temperature), using information gleaned from the IPA-TPD-MS experiments. It should be noted that the quantification of NH3-TPD may not reflect the entire concentration of the acid sites, considering that the TCD signals do not return to the baseline at high temperature (850 K), as shown in Fig. 2. As a result, the concentration of high temperature Lewis acid sites may be underestimated, leading to overestimated B/L ratios in Table 3 using this technique. The concentration of each type of acid site can be also quantitatively estimated from pyridine FT-IR using the integrated molar extinction coefficient [66]. However, the absolute concentrations measured by pyridine IR are less than half of those from IPA-TPD. This is probably due to the size of pyridine (ca. 5.5 Å) and its steric limitations, and hence it may not be able to access all the acid sites in the gallosilicate MFI pores [70]. Despite the perceived underestimation of Lewis sites by TPD and inaccessibility of pyridine to all acid sites, the data in Table 3 show that the relative concentrations of the acid sites were qualitatively well matched, supporting the supposition that increased MPS silane in zeolite synthesis gels results in enhanced concentrations of Lewis acid sites and decreased amounts of Brønsted acid sites. It is worth mentioning that every Ga atom does not correspond to an acid site, which means that some Ga species are inactive or inaccessible.

B indicates concentration of Brønsted acid sites, and L is the concentration of Lewis acid.
c
The extinction coefficients of pyridine adsorbed on Brønsted and Lewis acid sites are subject to debate in literature. If one used the coefficients published by Datka et al. [82] the concentrations of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites are higher by a factor of 2.29 and 2.00, respectively.

The deviation is likely due to underestimation of Lewis acid sites by NH3-TPD as discussed in the main text.
The Si and Ga species present in the catalysts were analyzed by NMR measurements. Fig. 6 shows the 29Si NMR spectra of the four MG materials. The peak at ca. −113 ppm is assigned to framework Si(0 Ga) species, while the signal at −105 ppm is from framework Si(1Ga) atoms, indicating the presence of framework Ga in the gallosilicate MFI materials [20], [36], [71]. The MG materials showed almost the same relative intensities of these two peaks, suggesting that the MG materials have similar levels of framework Ga. Additionally, in the NMR spectrum of the as-synthesized MG11 material, there was an additional peak at ca. −70 ppm, which was not observed in MG0 (Supplementary Material, Fig. S4). This peak can be assigned to T3 species [R–Si–(OSi)3], which was also reported by Wong et al. for materials synthesized in the presence of MPS [57], [72], [73], [74]. This confirms the condensation of the methoxysilane groups in MPS with the oxide framework during the synthesis. This T3 species then disappeared after calcination. UV–vis measurements were also carried out to probe for evidence of interactions between Ga and thiol groups associated with MPS (Supplementary Material). Specifically, the comparison of UV–Vis spectra of as-synthesized Ga-MFI (MPS/Ga = 0, MG0) and a Ga-MFI sample synthesized with MPS (MPS/Ga = 0.16, MG16) is given in Fig. S5. Upon addition of MPS to the hydrothermal synthesis, the characteristic peak of framework Ga at 210 nm was shifted to a lower wavelength, representing a higher bandgap energy [75], [76]. This may be due to the presence of mercaptopropyl groups in the MFI pores, causing interaction with framework Ga. Also, an extra peak at 270 nm was observed, representing the formation of extra-framework Ga [77], [78], the extent to which is suggested to be influenced by Ga-thiol interactions.

The presence of framework Ga was also confirmed by the large peak at ca. +150 ppm in the 71Ga NMR spectra (Fig. 7), representing Ga species in tetrahedral coordination [43], [79], [80], [81]. For the gallosilicate MFI materials used in this study, the peaks associated with extra-framework Ga were not routinely observed. Indeed, small concentrations of extra-framework Ga are difficult to be detected by 71Ga NMR, especially if they are not symmetric species, as previously discussed. However, for the MG16 material, which has the largest amount of Lewis acidic Ga sites based on acidity analysis, a small peak at ca. 0 ppm was observed. This confirms the presence of extra-framework Ga in this material, with the amount likely just above the threshold of detection in the NMR measurements. The NMR and pyridine FT-IR results indicate that although the MPS itself was likely cross-linked into the oxide framework during the synthesis, it did not significantly affect the incorporation of Ga in tetrahedral framework sites but instead it generated additional Lewis acidic Ga sites.

3.3. PDH performance
The catalytic PDH performance of the gallosilicate MFI catalysts was first compared at a common low conversion level of ca. 10%. The catalytic measurements were performed at 873 K and atmospheric pressure in a continuous quartz tube reactor connected to an online GC. The W/F values (W: weight of catalyst in g, and F: feed flow rate in mL/s) were adjusted for each catalyst to compare activity and selectivity at similar propane conversions. The time onstream data for propane conversion and the propylene selectivities for each catalyst were recorded for 5.5 h. As shown in Fig. 8a, a common propane conversion range of 9–13% was maintained for all the catalysts. The slightly higher rate of initial deactivation of MG16 shown in Fig. 8a is likely due to its higher concentration of acid sites. The onstream propylene selectivities are shown in Fig. 8b, whereas the time-averaged propylene selectivities and dehydrogenation-to-cracking ratios (D/C) from the measurements are compared in Fig. 9. It is clear that there is significantly increased propylene selectivity and lower cracking in the MPS-gallosilicate MFI materials compared to the catalyst made without MPS addition. Furthermore, the propylene selectivity increased with increasing MPS content in the catalyst synthesis gel. The initial propane conversion rates (expressed as TOFs) also increased from MG0 to MG16 (Fig. 10) wherein the MG16 catalyst showed more than a threefold increase in activity compared to the MG0 catalyst. The propane conversion rates (TOFs) were calculated based on Brønsted acid site (Fig. 10a) or the total acid site concentrations. The Brønsted acid site densities were measured by IPA-TPD and the total acid sites was estimated by combination of IPA-TPD and B/L ratios from pyridine-IR experiments (Fig. 10b). In Fig. 10a, different propane conversion rates were observed for the MG catalysts, with MG16 showing the highest activity per Brønsted acid site, a finding which may be attributed to its large number of strong Lewis acid sites. These data suggest that the presence of lower Brønsted acid site concentrations coupled with the presence of strong Lewis acid sites (associated with the high temperature TPD shoulder) leads to both increased propane conversion rate and propylene selectivity. This supports previous hypotheses that strong Lewis acid sites are key active sites for PDH. When the propane conversion rates were normalized by total acid sites, as shown in Fig. 10b, the catalysts made using MPS still showed clear enhancements compared to MG0, suggesting that there may exist a bifunctional mechanism between Brønsted and Lewis acid sites leading to promotion of the PDH reaction. There was almost no activity detected for both the pure-silica MFI and Ga impregnated pure-silica MFI (GS) control catalysts. This was expected, since they did not show significant acidity during the NH3-TPD measurements.

The best performing gallosilicate MFI made with MPS addition (MG11) was also compared with a prototypical chromia-alumina catalyst. The catalytic measurements were done at 873 K and atmospheric pressure for 12 h at two higher conversion levels (ca. 25% and 40%). In Fig. 11, when the initial propane conversion level was about 25%, which corresponds to the initial conversion rate of about 6.5 mmol/gcat/h, the MG11 showed lower propylene selectivity (ca. 75%) than the Cr catalyst (ca. 85%). However, it showed less deactivation over 12 h of reaction compared to the Cr catalyst (∼3.5 mmol/gcat/h decrease from the initial conversion rate for the Cr catalyst vs. ∼2.0 mmol/gcat/h decrease from the initial conversion rate for MG11). Similarly, the PDH performance was compared at an even higher conversion level in Fig. 12, where lower propylene selectivities (10–20%) would be expected for conventional Ga catalysts based on the literature reports discussed earlier [36], [44]. Although the Ga-containing catalysts gave lower propylene selectivity (ca. 60%) than the Cr catalyst (75%) under these conditions (Fig. 12), it is clear that MG11 still retained a high level of propylene selectivity even in this elevated conversion range. By comparison, in Choudhary et al. [36], the propylene selectivity was estimated to be about 15% at this conversion level. The improved performance in these Ga-MFI samples prepared with MPS addition is likely due to the lower concentration of Brønsted acid sites, as exemplified in MG11, since it is believed that Brønsted acid sites are active in the oligomerization and cyclization steps of alkane aromatization [31]. At both elevated conversion levels, the MG11 catalyst showed slower deactivation compared to the Cr catalyst and hence the MG11 provided higher propylene yield for a given reaction time, as shown in Fig. 13. Comparing the two catalysts, the chromia-alumina catalyst provided higher propylene selectivity, but this catalyst also showed more deactivation than MG11, even with a slightly lower initial conversion. This suggests that the MPS-gallosilicate MFI catalyst offers better resistance to coke formation than this benchmark Cr2O3 catalyst under the conditions studied.

4. Conclusions
Gallosilicate MFI zeolite catalysts with perturbed acidities were prepared via the addition of MPS to the zeolite synthesis gel, with the MPS removed after synthesis by calcination. The resulting gallosilicate MFI materials had reduced concentrations of Brønsted acid sites and more Lewis acid sites, with significant concentrations of strong Lewis acid sites, as confirmed by NH3-TPD, IPA-TPD and pyridine IR. These strong Lewis acid sites were achieved without post-synthesis impregnation of extra-framework Ga or high temperature heat treatments. The concentration of strong Lewis acid sites can be controlled by adjusting the amount of MPS added, with more MPS generating more strong Lewis acid sites. The PDH selectivity of gallosilicate molecular sieves is known to be strongly affected by the concentration of strong Lewis acid sites, with the most effective catalysts having a small concentration of Brønsted acid sites coupled with strong Lewis acidity. Decreasing the B/L ratio leads to better performance in PDH with higher activity and propylene selectivity. Therefore, the new gallosilicates prepared by MPS addition have acidities that are well-aligned with selective PDH catalysis. The reactivity of the catalysts prepared in the presence of MPS demonstrates that these catalysts are more effective for PDH than gallosilicate catalysts prepared without the MPS functional silane, having good propane conversion rates and higher selectivity to propylene. Also, the new family of catalysts prepared here have reduced cracking and aromatization selectivity. Compared with a benchmark chromia-alumina catalyst, a gallosilicate MFI catalyst prepared using MPS showed lower rate of deactivation than the benchmark catalyst. Though it had a slightly reduced propylene selectivity, it offered enhanced propylene yield compared to the chromia-alumina catalyst. Overall this work demonstrates that creation of zeolite based catalysts with improved PDH performance may be achieved by tuning the reactivity via use of functional silane additives added during the crystallization of the molecular sieve.
