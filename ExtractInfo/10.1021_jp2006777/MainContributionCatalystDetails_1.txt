 Unfortunately the given paper does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The paper discusses photocatalytic hydrogen production using WS2/CdS catalysts under visible light irradiation. It does not mention propane dehydrogenation specifically. Since the content does not pertain to converting propane to propylene, I cannot extract the requested information about propane dehydrogenation catalysts and process conditions.
