 Unfortunately, the provided information does not contain relevant details about propane dehydrogenation research. The documents focus on oxidative dehydrogenation of 1-butene to 1,3-butadiene over zinc ferrite catalysts, rather than propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propylene. As such, I cannot provide a meaningful summary in the requested XML structure. Please provide documents that actually pertain to propane dehydrogenation research in order to synthesize a useful summary.
