Nature of the Active Sites of VOx/Al2O3 Catalysts for Propane Dehydrogenation

Abstract
Supported VOx catalysts are promising for use in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) because of the relatively superior activity and stable performance upon regeneration. However, the nature of the active sites and reaction mechanism during PDH over VOx-based catalysts remains elusive. We examined active species by attaining various fractions of V5+, V4+, and V3+ ions by adjusting the surface vanadium density on an alumina support. The results reveal a close relationship between TOF and the fraction of V3+ ion, indicating that V3+ was more active for PDH. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy showed the same strong adsorbed species during both propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation. The results indicated that such an intermediate may correspond to V species containing a C═C bond, i.e., V–C3H5, and a reaction mechanism was proposed accordingly.

1 Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propylene serves as a key basic feedstock for the manufacture of various products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, and acrylonitrile. Because of the growing demand for propylene and the vast amount of propane in shale gas deposits, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes increasingly important as a propylene on-purpose production technology. (1) Supported CrOx and Pt catalysts are two major commercial catalytic systems for PDH, but their activities decay gradually after successive regenerations. (2, 3) Moreover, the high cost of Pt as well as serious pollution issues caused by Cr restrict the further development of the PDH industry.
Alternatively, supported vanadium oxide catalysts have shown promise for PDH. (3, 4) The public literature includes numerous studies of vanadium-based catalysts, although most of them focused on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, propane, or butane. (5-9) However, a low olefin yield is the major issue during the oxidative dehydrogenation process because alkene can be easily overoxidized to COx. Meanwhile, the operating safety and catalyst lifetime are also concerned. High olefin selectivity can be achieved via an economical direct dehydrogenation process, and vanadium oxides can be used as the catalyst. In particular, vanadium oxides supported on Al2O3 exhibited superior performance in terms of nonoxidative butane dehydrogenation. (10-15) Additionally, Sokolov et al. compared the catalytic performance of PDH over the VOx, CrOx, and PtSn catalysts and concluded that VOx-based catalysts had superior propylene selectivity and stability after several regeneration cycles. (3)
The mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane catalyzed by VOx has been extensively studied, which was proposed to be related to V5+/V4+ or V5+/V3+ redox cycles. (7, 16) However, a limited number of studies have dealt with the propane direct dehydrogenation mechanism over the promising family of vanadium-based catalysts. Prior to the dehydrogenation reaction, pentavalent vanadium is mainly present in the catalysts, while the catalyst would be reduced by hydrocarbons or hydrogen to some extent during the reaction, resulting in the formation of V4+ and V3+. (17-19) However, the nature of active vanadium ion during PDH remains elusive. Harlin et al. obtained a higher initial activity by pretreating vanadium oxide with H2, CO, or CH4 during butane dehydrogenation, and V4+ and V3+ ions were reported to be more active. (14) A similar situation has been reported for CrOx-based catalysts in which only Cr3+ and Cr2+ are active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction among a number of identified surface species, including Cr6+, Cr5+, Cr3+, and Cr2+. (20, 21)
To elucidate the origin of vanadium ion, it is crucial to develop tailor-made catalysts, which contain different fractions of V5+, V4+, and V3+ ions. Many studies have suggested that three types of VOx species, i.e., monovanadate, polyvanadate, and V2O5 crystallite, existed on the surface of Al2O3, generally depending on the ratio of support surface area and metal loading. (22, 23) Because of the various molecular structures, the vanadium species exhibited different reducibilities. It has been proven that V–O–V and V═O bonds were more easily reduced than the V–O-support. (24) Thus, it is possible that a different valence state distribution would be obtained on the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts upon reduction under the same condition.
Detecting the intermediates formed during reaction is crucial to understanding the reaction mechanism, and in situ infrared spectroscopy (IR) serves as a powerful tool. Various intermediates have been identified during propane dehydrogenation. On a Zn/H-MFI catalyst, zinc propyl species generated by dissociative adsorption of propane were detected by IR spectroscopic techniques. (25) Meanwhile, the formation of acetates/carboxylates was evidenced during propane dehydrogenation over CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts. (26) The authors proposed that the acetates/carboxylates originated from isopropoxide species, which were formed via the abstraction of hydrogen from propane. Ethyl, grafted on metal ions (Ga3+ and Zn2+), zinc hydrides, and gallium hydrides, was also detected by IR after the adsorption of ethane on Ga2O3 and ZnZSM-5, respectively. (27, 28) To the best of our knowledge, the IR data of propane dehydrogenation over vanadium-based catalysts is unavailable so far.
This paper describes the exploration of the nature of the active valence state and mechanistic aspects of PDH over the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts. We obtained a different valence state distribution by tuning the surface VOx density on Al2O3, and then PDH activity was tested on the prepared catalysts. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electron spin resonance spectroscopy (EPR), etc. Catalytic tests were then conducted to evaluate the effects of valence state on PDH performance. Aiming to understand the mechanism of PDH over VOx/Al2O3 catalysts, we investigated propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation using in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS).

2.1 Catalyst Preparation
All VOx/γ-Al2O3 samples were prepared via incipient wetness impregnation with γ-Al2O3 (Adamas; 99.99%; SBET = 180 m2/g) as the support. The precursor used was NH4VO3 (99.0%, Tianjin Guangfu Technology Development Co. Ltd.) dissolved in an aqueous solution of oxalic acid (99.0%, Aladdin Industrial Corp.). The γ-Al2O3 supports were impregnated in the NH4VO3 solution at room temperature for 12 h. After impregnation, the catalysts were dried at 90 °C overnight and then calcined at 500 °C for 2 h. The prepared catalysts were named xV/Al, where x is the V/γ-Al2O3 weight ratio.
2.2 Characterization
XRD measurements were performed with 2θ values between 10° and 90° by using a Rigaku C/mx-2500 diffractometer employing graphite-filtered Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). Raman spectra were recorded under ambient conditions using a Renishaw inVia reflex Raman spectrometer with a 325 and 532 nm Ar ion laser beam. Before measurements, the samples were dried at 80 °C for 2 h. The EPR spectra were recorded with a Bruker A300 spectrometer at 130 K. Selected EPR spectra were simulated with the SIMPOW program, which generated a powder spectrum calculated to second order. TEM was conducted to characterize the morphology of spent catalysts using a Tecnai G2 F20 transmission electron microscope at 200 kV. TGA (STA449F3 NETZSCH Corp.) was used to investigate the carbon deposition of spent catalysts. The samples were preheated at 80 °C for 0.5 h in N2 (50 mL/min) and then heated to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min in air (100 mL/min). UV–vis spectra in the range of 200–800 nm were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrophotometer, using BaSO4 as a reference. All the samples were dried at 80 °C for 2 h before measurements were taken.
H2-TPR experiments were conducted with a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 apparatus. Prior to the TPR experiments, a 100 mg sample was pretreated at 300 °C for 1 h under an Ar stream (20 mL/min). After the sample had cooled to 50 °C, H2-TPR was performed in 10 vol % H2/Ar (30 mL/min) with a heating rate of 10 °C/min (sample heated to 800 °C), and the profile was registered with a thermal conductivity detector.
XPS measurements were taken on a PHI 1600 ESCA instrument (PE Company) equipped with an Al Kα X-ray radiation source (hν = 1486.6 eV). Before measurements, all the samples were reduced under a flow of H2 at 600 °C for 1 h. The binding energies were calibrated using the C 1s peak at 284.5 eV as a reference.
In situ DRIFTS experiments were conducted on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet IS50 spectrometer, equipped with a Harrick Scientific DRIFT cell and a mercury–cadmium–telluride (MCT) detector cooled by liquid N2. Two major experiments were conducted with propane and propylene as the feed gas. All the samples were pretreated at 550 °C under a 10% H2/Ar flow (50 mL/min) for 0.5 h and cooled to the desired temperature to obtain a background spectrum, and this spectrum was then subtracted from the sample spectra for each measurement. For propane adsorption, the experiment included the following steps: (1) directing 4% C3H8/He to the sample cell at 30 °C and holding for 30 min, (2) increasing the temperature to 300 °C and holding it there for 60 min, and (3) shutting down the C3H8 and decreasing the temperature to 30 °C and holding it there for 30 min. With regard to propylene adsorption, the procedure included the following steps: (1) conducting adsorption of propylene at a flow of 4% C3H6/He for 30 min, followed by evacuation for 30 min at 30 °C, (2) subjecting the sample to a 10% H2/Ar or He flow (50 mL/min), heating it to 200 °C, and holding it there for 30 min, and (3) evacuating the resulting sample at 30 °C. The IR spectra of the spent catalyst were recorded after pretreatment at 300 °C under He for 30 min, using KBr for the background spectrum. For the spectra of chemisorbed formic acid and acetone, 20 mg catalysts were loaded into the in situ cell equipped with ZnSe windows after compression and then preheated at 550 °C under H2/Ar. After the sample had cooled to 50 °C, 6 μL of formic acid or acetone was injected and the sample held for 30 min. The spectrum was recorded under vacuum at 50, 200, and 300 °C.
2.3 Catalytic Tests
Catalytic tests were conducted at atmospheric pressure and 600 °C in a quartz fixed-bed reactor with an 8 mm inner diameter and a 24 cm length; 0.25 g of catalyst with a 20–40 mesh size distribution was loaded in the quartz tubular reactor. The catalyst was first heated to 600 °C under H2/N2 and held for 0.5 h; afterward, H2/N2 was replaced with the PDH reaction mixture of C3H8 (28 vol %) and H2 (28 vol %) in N2 at a total flow of 25 mL/min. The weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane was 3 h–1. The product gas was analyzed with an online gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (Chromosorb 102 column) and a thermal conductivity detector (Al2O3 plot column). The conversion of propane and selectivity to propylene were determined from eqs 1 and 2 respectively:

where i represents the hydrocarbon products in the effluent gas, ni is the number of carbon atoms of component i, and Fi is the corresponding flow rate.
The apparent activation energy (Ea) was obtained using Arrhenius plots, measuring at a series of temperatures under 10% propane conversion by adjusting the mass of catalysts.

3.1 Structural Analysis of VOx/Al2O3 Catalysts
A series of catalyst materials, including 1V/Al, 6V/Al, 12V/Al, and 20V/Al, were prepared, and the XRD patterns of these catalysts are shown in Figure 1. For lower metal loading (1–12%), only diffraction lines of γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS Card 10-0425) were detected, suggesting that the vanadium oxide species were well dispersed on the surface of the support. However, for the 20V/Al catalyst, additional reflection peaks at 2θ = 15.3°, 20.2°, 21.7°, 26.1°, 31.0°, 34.2°, 47.3°, 51.3°, 55.5°, 62.1°, and 72.5° were detected, which can be assigned to the characteristic peaks of the V2O5 crystal, indicating the formation of crystalline V2O5 over the catalyst. In addition, UV–vis spectroscopy was employed to evaluate the degree of polymerization of VOx species on VOx/Al2O3 catalysts. The spectra as well as the calculated edge energy are shown in Figure S1. As expected, with an increase in metal loading, the edge energy decreased from 3.9 to 2.5 eV, indicating the increase in the degree of polymerization and the growth in the domain size of vanadium oxides. (29-31) Previous studies have suggested that monovanadates, polyvanadate, and V2O5 formed at different vanadium densities: isolated VOx was the predominant species at a surface density of <1.2 V/nm2. Polymerized VOx coexisted with monovanadates at surface densities of 1.2–4.4 V/nm2. V2O5 formed at a surface VOx density of >4.4 V/nm2. V2O5 nanoparticles participated to a large extent after VOx density above vanadia monolayer coverage (8–9 V/nm2). (24, 32) In the work presented here, the vanadia densities of catalysts are 0.7, 3.9, 7.9, and 13.1 V/nm2 for 1V/Al, 6V/Al, 12V/Al, and 20V/Al, respectively, implying that different VOx species are present on the synthesized catalysts.
Figure 1
Figure 1. XRD patterns of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts.
To verify the surface configuration of VOx species on the Al2O3 surface, both UV and visible Raman spectroscopies were employed. This technique has been successfully used to distinguish the VOx species in supported vanadium systems. Specifically, UV Raman is more sensitive in monitoring the isolated and polymerized VOx species, while visible Raman is more appropriate for the detection of crystalline V2O5. (23, 24) Panels a and b of Figure 2 present the visible (532 nm) and UV (325 nm) Raman spectra of VOx/Al2O3 samples, respectively, where several sets of Raman bands were observed: broad bands in the range of 500–700 cm–1 and at 910 cm–1, intense ones at 994 cm–1, and sharp bands at ∼1021 cm–1. According to previous studies, the band around 994 cm–1 was assigned to crystalline V2O5, while the other three were attributed to V–O–V (500–700 cm–1), V–O–Al (910 cm–1), and V═O (1021 cm–1) modes. (24, 33) Specifically, only the Raman features at 910 cm–1 (V–O–Al) and 1021 cm–1 (V═O) in UV Raman spectra were observed on the 1V/Al catalyst, whereas no features were identified by the visible Raman technique because of the weak signal. Because no V–O–V and crystalline V2O5 modes were detected, we could deduce that the isolated VO4 species were present on 1V/Al. On the other hand, the 6V/Al catalyst and 12V/Al catalyst exhibited similar UV Raman features: in addition to the Raman bands at 910 and 1021 cm–1, a broad band in the range of 500–700 cm–1 (V–O–V) was detected. Moreover, in the case of visible-excited Raman spectra, an additional band at 994 cm–1 (crystalline V2O5) was observed for the 12V/Al sample. This implies that polyvanadate species exist at the surfaces of both 6V/Al and 12V/Al catalysts; meanwhile, a small amount of V2O5 crystalline also forms on the latter. With regard to the 20V/Al catalyst, a sharp band at 994 cm–1 (crystalline V2O5) appeared in both UV and visible Raman spectra, and V2O5 has also been detected by XRD, suggesting that V2O5 crystals are predominant on this catalyst.

Therefore, a possible scheme can be drawn on the basis of the analysis given above: the 1V/Al catalyst possesses mainly isolated VOx species, while monovanadates and polyvanadate coexist on the surface of the 6V/Al catalyst. Moreover, the vanadium density of the 12V/Al sample approximates monolayer coverage, as both polymerized VOx and a small V2O5 crystal are presented. For the 20V/Al catalyst, a large amount of V2O5 nanoparticles forms above the monolayer coverage. The surface mode of the studied catalysts is depicted in Scheme 1.

3.2 Distribution of Valence States
Each sample was analyzed by H2-TPR, and the reduction profiles are illustrated in Figure 3. Only one peak at ∼500 °C was observed for all the samples, which is associated with the reduction of VOx species. (34, 35) The number of H atoms consumed per V atom was then calculated (Table 1), corresponding to 1.0, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.9 for the 1V/Al, 6V/Al, 12V/Al, and 20V/Al catalysts, respectively. The results demonstrate that the catalyst with a higher surface VOx density has a higher reducibility. Such a trend has also been reported in previous studies, the reason for which was considered to be the difference in the reducibility of V═O, V–O–Al, and V–O–V bonds and the V2O5 nanoparticle. (24, 36) Additionally, similar phenomena have also been observed in the chromium oxide system. (37, 38)

XPS measurements have been taken to acquire the quantitative information about the valence distribution of vanadium on the catalyst surface. The binding energies at around 517.6, 516.6, and 515.7 eV were assigned to V5+, V4+, and V3+ ion, respectively, and the fraction of each oxidation valence was obtained by peak deconvolution. (13, 14, 39) Note that the difference on the obtained Vx+ fraction between XPS and H2-TPR may be caused by the deconvolution error and hydrogen correction factor, respectively. As shown in Figure 4 and Table 2, the V oxidation state was a mixture of 5+, 4+, and 3+ states after reduction, which is consistent with earlier reports. (13, 14) Specifically, except for the 1V/Al sample, less pentavalent vanadium was observed over the reduced catalyst with a higher metal loading, suggesting that more VOx species was reduced, in agreement with the TPR results. Note that the result for the 1V/Al catalyst is not presented here because of the relatively low signal intensity. As discussed above, mainly isolated VOx species was present on the surface of the 1V/Al catalyst, and the monomeric vanadium oxide should possess only one oxidation state upon complete reduction. The average state calculated from the H2-TPR profile was 4+, and abundant V4+ ion was also observed by EPR (Figure S2). (23, 40) Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that almost 100% V ions exist in the V4+ form over the 1V/Al sample. In addition, the V valence state does not change under reaction conditions, which was confirmed by additional XPS analysis of the 6V/Al sample after reaction for 1 h (Figure S6). In summary, different fractions of V5+, V4+, and V3+ ion were achieved by reducing different vanadium species, which were obtained by adjusting the vanadium density over the catalyst surface.

3.3 Catalytic Performance
The VOx/Al2O3 catalysts with different VOx densities were tested for propane dehydrogenation at 600 °C. The activity and selectivity are illustrated in Figure 5. All the catalysts showed high selectivity toward propylene (>87%), which could remain constant during the whole reaction, indicating that VOx has superior C–H activation ability. (3, 4, 29) As can be clearly seen, the initial propane conversion increased as a function of V loading up to 12% and then declined on the 20V/Al catalyst. Moreover, a dramatic decrease in activity was found, which is mainly caused by the formation of coke throughout the reaction. (4, 29) In Figure 6a, carbonaceous material was observed covering the 12V/Al catalyst after a 4 h PDH reaction, and the amount of coke deposition (i.e., 0.054 g/gcat) was measured by TGA (Figure 6b).

To elucidate the origin of active sites, we calculated the initial TOFperV at 600 °C based on all the vanadium atoms. Because all the V atoms were exposed to reactants and served as the active site for isolated and polymerized VOx species, the calculated TOFperV value will be the same as TOFpersite, which is defined on a per active site basis. However, for the catalysts with crystalline V2O5, TOFperV would be smaller than TOFpersite because only surface V atoms of V2O5 served as active sites. To improve our understanding, additional TOFs on the 3V/Al and 9V/Al catalysts were also measured, and all the results are listed in Table 3. Apparently, the initial TOFperV grew along with V loading up to the 9V/Al sample and then declined on the 12V/Al and 20V/Al catalysts. Because crystalline V2O5 started to form when V loading was >12%, the actual TOFpersite on the 12V/Al and 20V/Al systems would be higher than the calculated TOFperV, while those on the catalysts with a lower vanadium loading (<9%) would be close to the calculated one. Nevertheless, instead of a constant TOFperV value, the variation of TOFperV at low V loadings (<9%) indicates that multiple active sites exist, and the ratio between these sites changes along with metal loading, consistent with XPS results discussed in section 3.2.

Additionally, in the case of 1V/Al, 6V/Al, 12V/Al, and 20V/Al catalysts, the apparent activation energy declines continuously from 244 to 165 kJ/mol (Table 3), which further suggests the change in active sites over the sample with different vanadium loadings. (41) Note that the mass transfer limitation has been excluded as shown in section S7 of the Supporting Information. Moreover, the increasing TOFperV indicates that the fraction of active sites with higher activity increases along with an increase in VOx density. As noted, the catalyst with a higher VOx surface density suffers from deeper reduction and thus possesses many more V3+ ions. The fractions of V3+ ions on the surface of 1V/Al, 6V/Al, 12V/Al, and 20V/Al catalysts are 0, 19, 28, and 60%, respectively (see section 3.2). Therefore, we propose that the VOx species (V5+, V4+, and V3+ ions) on the catalysts exhibit different activity for propane dehydrogenation, and the V3+ ions are more active than V5+ and V4+ ions. In addition, the oxidation state of vanadium determines the catalytic activity, while the degree of polymerization, tuned by vanadium loading, also affects the distribution of vanadium oxidation states, which has an indirect influence on catalyst activity.
Along with incremental VOx density, the fraction of exposed V atoms increases first and then declines (due to the formation of three-dimensional V2O5), while the ratio of more active V3+ increases continuously. Given these two factors, the PDH activity over the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a volcanic trend and reaches its maximum over the 12V/Al catalyst with an optimal balance between catalyst dispersion and activity of active site, (42) as shown in Figure 5.
3.4 DRIFTS Studies
The DRIFTS experiments were performed over the 12V/Al catalyst to explore the reaction mechanism during PDH. Figure 7 shows the IR spectra obtained after adsorption of propane at 30 °C (spectrum 1), and after reaction at 300 °C for 60 min (spectrum 2) and then evacuation at 30 °C (spectrum 3) on the 12V/Al catalyst. In the initial spectra, the bands at 2967, 1460, and 1370 cm–1, assigned to propane, were detected. Surprisingly, when the sample was heated to 300 °C, a new strong band at 1555 cm–1 emerged, suggesting that propane was involved in reaction over the catalyst. After evacuation at 30 °C, the bands at 1555 and 1460 cm–1 remain unchanged, while the band at 2967 cm–1 disappeared because propane could barely be chemisorbed on the catalyst surface (Figure S3). These results indicate that the obvious bands at 1555 and 1460 cm–1 must correspond to some strongly adsorbed species generated by propane at elevated temperatures.
Figure 7

The IR spectra recorded after adsorption of propylene at 30 °C and subsequent evacuation (Figure 8, spectrum 1) give the bands at 2978, 2876, 1625, 1460, and 1381 cm–1, which are the characteristic adsorption bands of propylene. After subsequent adsorption of hydrogen at 30 °C, no significant changes were found (not shown here). However, after the temperature had increased to 200 °C, the bands at 2978 and 2876 cm–1 became negligible, while a new broad band at 1555 cm–1 appeared. These bands remained unchanged after evacuation at 30 °C (Figure 9, spectra 2 and 3). Note that, in contrast to that under hydrogen, heating the sample under a helium atmosphere to the same temperature led only to the disappearance of all bands, suggesting the desorption of propylene under 200 °C (Figure 9, spectrum 4). In summary, strong bands at 1555 and 1460 cm–1 were observed during PDH. Meanwhile, bands at 1555 and 1460 cm–1 (overlapping with that at 1555 cm–1) were also detected during propylene hydrogenation, which is the microscopic reverse of dehydrogenation. The results of IR spectra clearly verify that the bands at 1555 and 1460 cm–1 are related to the intermediates during propane dehydrogenation. The band at 1460 cm–1 is very likely due to the C–H vibration, while the new peak at 1555 cm–1 is possibly initiated by the vibration of the C═C bond considering the IR band of familiar functional groups. (43, 44) In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculation showed that η-vinyl over the Pt(111), which preserves the double bond nature, exhibited C═C vibration at 1547 cm–1, quite close to our experimental result, further supporting our proposal. (45)

Although the first step of propane dehydrogenation over a metal oxide catalyst is commonly considered to be the dissociative adsorption of propane, forming metal alkyl and bridging hydroxyl, (28, 46-49) saturated alkyl (such as propyl) would not lead to an IR vibration as high as 1555 cm–1. (50) Therefore, we propose that vanadium propyl would form during the first step of PDH, which instantly transforms to propenyl-vanadium due to instability, containing one C═C bond and five H atoms. DFT calculations on a V-doped α-Al2O3 indicate two bands from propenyl-vanadium, which are very close to experimental observations: the C═C stretching at 1566 cm–1 and the C–H bending mode at 1427 cm–1 (see the Supporting Information).
At elevated temperatures, propylene deposition and coke deposition were initiated from the propenyl-vanadium, and vanadium propyl might also directly lead to their generation. This hypothesis was proven by the MS signal of H2 (Figure 9), which is generated via the dehydrogenation of propane to propenyl, in the temperature range without detection of propylene by both MS and DRIFTS (Figure 8, spectrum 2) during C3H8 TPSR. With regard to propylene hydrogenation, it was considered the microscopic reverse of propane dehydrogenation and shared the reverse mechanism. (51, 52) Heating the catalyst with strongly adsorbed propylene to 200 °C under a hydrogen atmosphere produced the same intermediate as propane dehydrogenation, but only propylene desorption was observed under a helium atmosphere. In the hydrogen atmosphere, propylene is first partially hydrogenated to vanadium propyl species, which then transforms to propenyl-vanadium. However, propylene cannot be hydrogenated to vanadium propyl without the coexistence of hydrogen, and it can desorb only at elevated temperatures.
Because heavy coke deposition occurs during propane dehydrogenation (also demonstrated in Figure 7) and carbonaceous species typically contain a C═C bond, we checked whether the peak at 1555 cm–1 is due to the carbon species. A previous study verified that coke species mainly formed from the alkenes rather than the alkanes with a relatively high temperature. (26) However, no propylene was detected by IR at 300 °C during propane dehydrogenation. Besides, the IR spectra of the spent catalyst with coke deposition showed a strong band at 1585 cm–1 (Figure S4), which is a feature of unsaturated or aromatic hydrocarbons, consistent with earlier studies. (26, 53) Moreover, if the 1555 cm–1 peak belongs to carbon deposition, it is barely possible that it only appears by propylene with hydrogen instead of propylene with helium. Hence, the bands at 1555 and 1460 cm–1 are not attributed to coke deposition, which occurs mainly after propylene formation.
Previous studies of chromium/alumina during propane dehydrogenation reported a band at 1555 cm–1, similar to our results, and the authors assigned this band to the formates νas (COO). (26) However, in our vanadium-based system, the intermediate is unlikely to be the species with a C═O bond. IR spectra of both adsorbed acetone and formic acid (Figure S5) showed the band at 1589 cm–1 over 50, 200, or 300 °C, which was related to the C═O vibration. Moreover, the sample was completely reduced before experiments, and the oxygen was typically coordinated with an Al atom or a V atom; thus, no excessive O can form the C═O bond. All of these results illustrate the fact that the bands at 1555 and 1460 cm–1 may not be assigned to the species with a C═O bond. Consequently, we speculate that the intermediate formed during both propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation is vanadium propenal (V–C3H5), and the proposed reaction mechanism for propane dehydrogenation over the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts is depicted in Scheme 2.

In conclusion, this study constitutes an in-depth attempt to explore the nature of active sites and the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation over promising VOx/Al2O3 catalysts. Different fractions of V5+, V4+, and V3+ ion on the catalyst surface were obtained by altering the vanadium density on the catalyst. Specifically, the catalyst with a higher VOx density is more prone to reduction, leading to a higher proportion of V3+ ions on the surface. TOFpersite over the catalyst (V loading at most 9%) increases constantly. Therefore, we propose that multiple active sites exist over the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst, and V3+ is more active for propane dehydrogenation than the other V sites with different oxidation states.
In situ DRIFTS was employed for the investigation of the reaction mechanism. Same intermediates were detected during both propane dehydrogenation and propylene hydrogenation, indicating that they share a reverse reaction mechanism. In combination with previous studies, a new intermediate, i.e., propenyl-vanadium (V–C3H5), was proposed, instead of carbonyl compound or carbonaceous species. Propane activation over the catalyst surface involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom, and then the formed vanadium propyl was rapidly transformed to propenyl-vanadium because of instability, as observed by an IR spectroscopic technique. At elevated temperatures, propylene formed from propenyl-vanadium or propyl-vanadium and then desorbed from the catalyst surface, and coke deposition occurred at the same time, leading to catalyst deactivation.
The conclusions reported in this paper will improve our in-depth understanding of the reaction mechanism and further improve catalytic performance. Maximizing the exposure of vanadium atom and the fraction of V3+ ion could enhance propane conversion.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
