Theoretical Investigations of (Oxidative) Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene over Palladium Surfaces
Abstract
Herein, we present density functional theory calculations of the (oxidative) dehydrogenation of propane on Pd(111) and Pd(211) surfaces. We find that, independently of the surfaces and the intermediate product (1-propyl or 2-propyl), O-assisted dehydrogenation of propane is always less favorable than the direct or OH-assisted hydrogen abstraction. Additionally, we show that the transition state energies of the (oxidative) dehydrogenation of propane on Pd surfaces scale with the final state energies and are similar to trends observed for methane activation. This work is a first and essential step to understand the role of surface oxygen species and the mechanism of (O)DHP on Pd-based catalysts.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The markets for propylene derivatives have grown rapidly over the last few years and are likely to continue doing so. (1,2) This demand is thought to be met by dehydrogenation of propane (DHP), with variants thereof being oxidative dehydrogenation using O2 (ODHP) (3,4) or CO2 (CO2-ODHP). (5−7) Although the ODHP in the presence of molecular O2, as an oxidizing agent, favors low-temperature reactions and is exothermic, deep oxidation to COx is a major drawback, which often results in loss of propylene selectivity and yield. To circumvent these issues, milder oxidants such as CO2 are also explored. (8)
Among the many catalysts tested for the DHP are supported metal particles such as platinum, (9,10) nickel, (11,12) and palladium; (13,14) whereas metal oxides, such as chromium oxide, (15) vanadium oxide, (16,17) and gallium oxide, (18) but also carbon-based materials (3) and zeolites (19) have been proposed for ODHP. Among metal-based catalysts, only platinum has advanced to commercial applications of the DHP thanks to its superior activation of paraffinic C–H bonds and low activity toward undesired C–C cleavage. (7) The high cost of Pt as well as poisoning of the active sites by coke at high temperatures (showing poor propylene selectivity and fast deactivation) are the main limitations of the Pt-based catalysts. (20)
Studies on palladium-based catalysts, on the other hand, have been scarce, although interest in these catalysts has increased in recent years. (13,14,21−23) Recently, Nowicka et al. (13) synthesized a Pd/CeZrAlOx material for CO2–ODHP with long-term stability and, high activity and selectivity. Additionally, selective DHP catalysts of PdM (M = Zn, In, Fe) alloys for olefin production showing improved stability compared to bare Pd nanoparticles have been reported. (14,22−24) These studies suggest that the isolation of active metal sites by inactive atoms is responsible for high olefin selectivity, as it has been reported before for PtSn alloys. (25)
While the reaction mechanism of DHP on Pt-based catalysts has been the subject of many computational studies, (20,26−28) theoretical investigations targeting Pd-based catalysts have not been reported to date. Herein, we report a mechanistic study of DHP and ODHP over palladium (111) and (211) surfaces using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. We show the mechanism by which propane is converted into propylene, how the structure of the metal surface is influencing activity, and explore the role of surface oxygen that would be present in ODPH.
Computational Methods
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package (VASP) (29,30) and the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) (31) employing the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using the Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals corrections (BEEF–vdW) (32,33) and the projector-augmented wave (PAW) potentials. (34,35) The choice of the BEEF–vdW functional is motivated by its performance with respect to adsorption energies (36) and transition states (37) on transition-metal surfaces. The kinetic energy cutoff and the k-point mesh were 450 eV and 4 × 4 × 1, respectively. When specified, single-point calculations were performed using the PBE functional including Grimme’s dispersion corrections (PBE-D3) using the same parameters. (38,39)
Four-layer slabs with p(3 × 3) and p(1 × 3) supercells are used to represent the palladium (111) and (211) surfaces, with dimensions of 8.44 × 8.44 and 6.89 × 8.44 Å, respectively (see Figure S1). The two bottom layers of the slabs were fixed during the relaxations. To avoid interactions between periodic images, the Pd slabs are separated by ∼15 Å of vacuum along the z-direction. To investigate possible interactions between periodic images, we used bigger supercells with four-layer slabs, and sizes of (4 × 4) and (6 × 6) for the Pd(111) and Pd(211) surfaces (the k-point meshes were 3 × 3 × 1 and 2 × 2 × 1), respectively.
The adsorption energy is defined as follows:
(1)
In eq 1, all energies refer to systems with optimized structures; EX+surf stands for the total energy of the molecule/species adsorbed, EX is the energy of the adsorbate calculated in the gas phase, and Esurf is the energy of the slab. By this definition, a negative value corresponds to an exothermic process. The isolated molecules involved in the propane (oxidative) dehydrogenation process (propane, hydrogen, propylene, and water) were structurally relaxed inside a large simulation box of 15 × 15 × 15 Å3.
The transition state (TS) searches along the reaction path were systematically performed using the nudge elastic band (NEB) (40) and DIMER (41) methods at the same theoretical level as those for the reactants and products. The structures used to search the TS in each dehydrogenation step were chosen based on the most stable adsorptions of C3 compounds over the preadsorbed oxygen species. The final TS structures were confirmed by a single imaginary frequency along the reaction coordinate calculated with a normal mode analysis by using a finite-difference approximation of the Hessian matrix.
The thermochemistry module from ASE was used to obtain zero-point energy (ZPE) and entropy (S) contributions, and temperature variations using CP for the Gibbs free energy. The gas-phase molecules and the palladium surfaces (with or without preadsorbed oxygen species) were taken as reference values, as illustrated in Figure S2. For all adsorbates and TS, the calculations were done under the harmonic limit and the values for the gas-phase molecules were taken from experimental data or the NIST database. (42−44)
Results and Discussion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The calculated propane adsorption energies on Pd(111) and Pd(211) were −0.30 and −0.34 eV, respectively. This compares to the experimentally measured value of −0.46 eV for the Pd(111) surface (45) and presents an error of the same order of magnitude as that obtained for propane adsorption on other surfaces such as Pt. (25,46) The differences in energy (for the adsorptions and transition states of C3 species) between the supercells of different sizes are negligible, as reported in Table S3. We thus used the smaller supercells throughout. The effect of the oxygen and hydroxyl species on propane adsorption is small on both surfaces (∼0.02 eV), while the propylene adsorption energy amounts to −0.73 and −0.95 eV on Pd(111) and Pd(211), respectively (see Figure 1 and Supporting Information).

We investigated propane dehydrogenation both on the clean Pd surfaces and in the presence of surface oxygen and hydroxyl species. Scheme 1 shows the reaction mechanism and intermediates involved in both processes. The reaction involves two dehydrogenation steps: the first step is the conversion of propane (C3H8) into either 1- or 2-propyl (C3H7), followed by conversion into propylene (C3H6). In the oxygen (or OH)-assisted DHP mechanism, a surface oxygen atom (or OH) abstracts the hydrogen from propane and its intermediates, forming hydroxyl (or water).

Mechanism of the Dehydrogenation of Propane (DHP) over Pd Surfaces
Free energy diagrams at a temperature of 600 °C are shown in Figure 2 along with structures of intermediates and transition states. We chose this temperature as this is typical for DHP. (7) Free energy profiles at a different temperature for selected pathways are presented in Figure S5. As can be seen in Figure 2a,b, the energy barriers for the first dehydrogenation step are slightly higher for path B, where 2-propyl is formed as an intermediate. It can also be seen that Pd(211) has slightly lower barriers, although the small differences compared to Pd(111) show that the structure sensitivity of this reaction is not pronounced as commonly observed for dehydrogenation reactions. (47) Interestingly, the energy barriers for the second dehydrogenation step are lower for Pd(211) compared to Pd(111) (see also Table S4). Relative to gas-phase H2, one can clearly see that the first dehydrogenation step constitutes the highest free energy barrier for both surfaces (see Figure S6). For Pd(211), both dehydrogenation barriers are quite similar, with the first barrier being lower for path A1 and higher for path B1. Finally, the desorption of both hydrogen and propylene involves no effort for both surfaces at 600 °C, indicating that the reaction takes place in the low-coverage regime (within which all intermediates and reaction barriers have been calculated in the present study).

A comparison of the results obtained for Pd with those calculated for Pt (using the same functional and similar parameters) is shown in Figure S7. (28) Interestingly, while we find relatively small free energy barriers for the lowest energy pathways (1.10 and 0.96 eV for Pd(111) and Pd(211), respectively), these have been reported to be significantly higher on Pt surfaces (> 2.0 eV). (28)
Mechanism of ODHP over Pd Surfaces
The free energy profiles for the ODHP over both Pd surfaces are shown in Figure 3a,b and the elementary steps of the pathway B2 assuming a 2-propyl intermediate are presented in Figure 3c,d. Here, the first dehydrogenation step is O-assisted (blue lines), while the second DH step is OH-assisted (red lines). Interestingly, the differences in the two reaction pathways of the ODHP are negligible between both Pd surfaces. The energy barriers of the first dehydrogenation step on the Pd surfaces are over 1.5 eV, 0.2–0.4 eV higher than the corresponding energy barriers for the direct DH process. The energy barrier of the second DH step is much lower: for the Pd(111) surface, around 0.7 eV for the direct route, and around 0.4 eV for the ODPH. For the Pd(211) surface, in the second DH step for ODHP, the energy barriers are slightly higher than those over the Pd(111) surface, which is in clear contrast with the direct route.

The previous results are further elaborated in Figure 4. If the first DH step proceeds via an OH-assisted pathway, the activation energies are comparable to the direct DHP (but the final states are always lower in energy), and the O-assisted steps are higher in energy barriers (Figure 4a,b). On the other hand, for the second DH step, it is clear that OH-assisted DH has the lowest energy barriers, while the barriers for direct and O-assisted DH steps are comparable (Figure 4c,d).

Figure 5 correlates the transition state energies (ΔETS) of all dehydrogenation steps expressed as a function of the final state energies (ΔEFS) for reactions on clean, O*-, and OH*-covered surfaces (the reference energy levels are defined as shown in Figure S2). The solid lines represent scaling relations between the transition state of methane activation calculated for clean (black), O*-(blue), and OH*-covered (red) transition-metal (111) surfaces as described in an earlier study. (48) We note that this study utilized the RPBE (49) functional, hence not accounting for dispersion forces. We performed single-point calculations using the PBE-D3 (38,39) functional to extract the D3 dispersion contributions of the final and transition states. We find that transition and final states are stabilized by roughly the same amount (about 0.55 eV; see Table S5). We therefore assume that the results of DHP and ODHP can be compared to those calculated for CH4 activation and be plotted against the corresponding transition state scaling (TSS) relations. The reason for the differences in correlations between ΔETS and ΔEFS on clean transition-metal surfaces and oxygen-assisted dehydrogenation is due to the different transition state scaling lines for dehydrogenation. These phenomena can be explained by compensation effects as has been described earlier. (50)

Filled circles/squares, dehydrogenation from C1 carbon on Pd(111)/Pd(211) surfaces; open circles/squares, dehydrogenation from C2 carbon on Pd(111)/Pd(211) surfaces. Solid lines and small circles were taken from Yoo et al. (48) for CH4 activation on transition-metals (111) and Pd(111) surfaces, respectively. Figure S9 shows the difference in ΔETS between the O- or OH-assisted, and the direct DHP as a function of the difference in ΔEFS.
Interestingly, despite the use of different functionals, propane dehydrogenation follows almost the same scaling relation determined for methane dehydrogenation over (111) transition-metal surfaces (rescaled relations are presented in Figure S8), indicative of a more general scaling relation independent of the functional used or the CxHy species considered. (51) Apparently, these results can also be extended to propane dehydrogenation over (211) transition-metal surfaces, but further studies are needed.
Figure 5 shows that the O-assisted DHP has overall higher dehydrogenation barriers when compared with the direct dehydrogenation for Pd surfaces, even though the ΔEFS is lower in energy; independently of the DH step and the position of the carbon from where the hydrogen is subtracted, O* does not favor DHP, as can be seen in Figure S9. On average, the OH-assisted dehydrogenation has the lowest activation energy but also the lowest final state energies, suggesting strong exothermicity. Here, the first (at ca. −0.5 eV) and the second (at ca. −1.0 eV) DH steps can be identified, wherein the first DH steps have comparable ΔETS to the direct DHP but lower ΔEFS, whereas the second DH steps have the lowest ΔETS and ΔEFS.
This analysis shows that while the surface oxygen coverage will decrease the activity of palladium toward DHP, there might be an improvement overall when surface hydroxyl groups participate in the reaction. The extent to which this promotional effect of hydroxyl dominates the overall reaction mechanism depends crucially on the OH* coverage (and the corresponding coverage of O*). These coverages in turn depend on the type of oxidant used and the corresponding reaction conditions. A detailed analysis of the steady-state coverages, however, is only possible with elaborate microkinetic models.
Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The reaction mechanisms of the (oxidative) dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over palladium surfaces were analyzed using DFT calculations. Interestingly, a comparison with literature data obtained for Pt surfaces indicates that Pd catalysts are more active for this reaction. We also found that the energy barriers of the oxidative dehydrogenation steps are always higher than those for the nonoxidative route. This strongly indicates that oxygen does not considerably change the kinetics of this reaction on Pd surfaces. We furthermore showed that the transition state energy scales with the final state energy (on Pd(111) and Pd(211) surfaces), both for the oxidative and for nonoxidative dehydrogenation, in analogy to an earlier study on methane activation. To fully explore the potential of Pd-based catalysts, further studies concerning side reactions and catalyst deactivation are needed.

Filled circles/squares, dehydrogenation from C1 carbon on Pd(111)/Pd(211) surfaces; open circles/squares, dehydrogenation from C2 carbon on Pd(111)/Pd(211) surfaces. Solid lines and small circles were taken from Yoo et al. (48) for CH4 activation on transition-metals (111) and Pd(111) surfaces, respectively. Figure S9 shows the difference in ΔETS between the O- or OH-assisted, and the direct DHP as a function of the difference in ΔEFS.
</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
