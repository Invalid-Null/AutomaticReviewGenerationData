 Unfortunately the document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation to produce propylene. The document focuses on propane aromatization over gallium modified ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts to produce aromatic hydrocarbons like benzene, toluene, and xylenes. While propylene is produced as an intermediate, the main focus is on aromatization reactions and not propylene production specifically.
