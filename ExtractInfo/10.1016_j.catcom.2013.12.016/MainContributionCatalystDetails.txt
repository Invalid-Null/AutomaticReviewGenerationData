 Unfortunately, the provided document extracts do not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation research. Since multiple irrelevant extracts are provided, I cannot synthesize a meaningful summary.

The extracts discuss the oxidative dehydrogenation of 1-butene, not propane dehydrogenation. As there is no relevant information provided in the extracts, I cannot populate the XML template with any substantive details about propane dehydrogenation research. The relevance indicator is set to "No" to signify that the extracts are not pertinent to the requested analysis.
