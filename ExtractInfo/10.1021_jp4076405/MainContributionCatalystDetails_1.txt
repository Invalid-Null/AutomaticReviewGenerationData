Based on my review, the provided document does not appear to pertain to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation for converting propane to propylene. The document focuses on developing computational models and scaling relations to predict hydrocarbon adsorption energies on transition metal catalyst surfaces. While it provides some example applications related to methane reforming and chain growth, it does not specifically discuss converting propane to propylene via dehydrogenation processes. Therefore, I have indicated that the content is not directly relevant.
