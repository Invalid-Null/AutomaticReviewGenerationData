 Unfortunately the given document does not seem to be relevant, as it does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The document focuses on membrane assisted propane dehydrogenation in general. Since it does not provide details on a specific catalyst or comparisons of catalyst performance, I am unable to extract the requested information.
