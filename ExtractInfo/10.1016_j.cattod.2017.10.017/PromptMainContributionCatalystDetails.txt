1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important feedstock in the petrochemical industry, since it can be employed for the production of a wide range of derivatives, such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, cumene, propylene oxide, acrylic acid, etc. Nowadays, propylene is commonly obtained through steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of light oil fractions, that however suffer for low selectivity towards desired product [1]. In addition, the growing demand for propylene derivatives led to a correspondingly substantial increase in propylene demand during the last 20 years. To satisfy the required demand, the developing of efficient alternative processes for selective propylene production appears mandatory: in this aim, selective propane dehydrogenation (PDH) appears the most viable solution to sustain the growing propylene market [2].
The propane dehydrogenation is a simple reaction, that basically involves the removal of 2 hydrogen atoms from 2 adjacent carbon sites of propane, so generating a double bond, and then the corresponding olefin, that results in a reversible endothermic reaction characterized by a volume increasing (Eq. (1)).
(1)
From a thermodynamic point of view, the reaction is promoted at high temperature and low (partial) pressures [3]; on the other hand, despite the very simple stoichiometry of the reaction, the reaction system is very complex because of the cracking (Eq. (2)) and (Eq. (3)) and coking reactions (Eq. (4)).

Such scenario remarks the relevant role of the catalytic formulation in the process, that basically should promote the propylene formation and avoid (or at least reduce) the side reactions. In addition, operating conditions are selected in order to mitigate side reactions predominance, in particular the operating temperature was limited to a range within 570–650 °C, accepting a low propane conversion (below 50%) [4]. Such conditions assured a very higher selectivity towards propylene, that approaches 90%; unfortunalely, the carbon formation, and the consequent catalytic system deactivation, appeared an unavoidable phenomenon [5], originating mainly by the adsorbed propylene on active sites [6]. Accordingly the catalyst needs to be frequently regenerated, with either continuous or batch wise operation [7]. For this reason, the available industrial PDH processes (Catofin, Oleflex, Star, FDB) are characterized for the approach toward such phenomenon, in terms of operating conditions (pressure, temperature, propane dilution), catalyst formulation (chromium- or platinum-based) and catalyst regeneration procedure.
Intensive research was carried out in order to enlarge the activity cycle and thus to increase the time between regenerations, by modifying catalytic formulation or operating conditions. It was established that the addition of steam can act as heat carrier toward the catalytic system, as well as could suppress coke deposition [8]; moreover, it results in a dilution of the system, thermodynamically promoting the propane conversion. On the other hand, the presence of steam could generate reforming reactions, reducing selectivity towards propylene.

It was also demonstrated that hydrogen addition in the process stream produces a sensible reduction in coke deposition and catalyst deactivation, however H2 dilution negatively affects thermodynamic conversion. It was widely accepted that catalyst deactivation strictly depends on reaction temperature, since lower temperature assures a marked increasing in propylene selectivity, mainly due to the reduction of cracking reaction, but also to a lower coke formation, resulting in an overall lower deactivation rate [9]. On the other hand, lower operating temperature depresses propane conversion and in turn propylene production, therefore such solution is not commonly adopted in the industrial processes.
The double target of reduce deactivation and increase propylene conversion could be theoretically achieved by coupling a low temperature dehydrogenation stage with a H2-selective membrane [10], [11], [12], able to subtract a product to the system and thus thermodynamically promoting the production of propylene [13], [14]. In a purely ideal analysis, membrane-based system allows lower operating temperature, avoiding the classical trade-off between conversion and selectivity, in addition, could severely reduce coke formation thus enlarging regeneration periods.
The rationale behind such concept is that coke formation in olefins production processes is mainly due to endothermic cracking reactions of the feedstock with simultaneous production of H2 and solid carbon. In conventional processes, operating at higher temperature, sometimes hydrogen is introduced in the feed in order to push the chemical equilibrium of such reactions towards the reactants. In the case of the novel concept, the possibility to operate at lower temperature enables for a less occurring of such endothermic reactions and accordingly for a lower amount of deposited coke.
Pd-based membranes appeared the most promising solution for the employment with the PDH reaction, mainly due to their optimal selectivity/flux ratio and to the typical operating temperature (250–550 °C) that effectively matches the PDH reaction [15]. On the other hand, the coupling of catalytic PDH and Pd-membrane hydrogen separation required the utilization of non-common operating conditions, such as low inert employment and high operating pressure; moreover, the continuous removal of hydrogen from the system through the membrane is responsible for a decreasing H/C ratio along the process, resulting in more favourable conditions for coke formation [16], [17], [18]. Dedicated studies demonstrated that Pd-membrane in a PDH environment could suffer for typical coking phenomena, that by depositing on membrane surface inhibit hydrogen dissociation, resulting in a constant reduction of the membrane permeating capability [19], [20], that in turn compromise the overall system productivity [21].
The complexity of the system and the perspective of an effective coupling to a membrane system underlined that the availability of reliable mathematical models for reactions and catalyst reactivations are essential. Very few experimental studies, and no mathematical models, were reported in the recent literature for catalytic dehydrogenation of concentrated propane at relatively high pressure and low temperature. In this work, a dedicated experimental program was reported for propane dehydrogenation on a Pt-based catalyst, by focusing the attention on the operating conditions compatible with membrane integration. Both activity and stability of the catalyst system was evaluated in the investigated conditions, in addition mathematical models were optimized to effectively describe the system behaviour and the catalyst deactivation.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Experimental apparatus
The experimental tests were performed in the ProCEED laboratories of the Department of Industrial Engineering at the University of Salerno.
The experimental apparatus, designed for a propylene capacity up to 0.05 kg/h, consists of 3 main units, assembled in open architecture: 2 tubular reactors (R-101 and R-102) and 1 membrane unit (M-101); the basic idea of the plant was to install in series the first reaction unit, the membrane and downstream the second reaction unit. The plant scheme is depicted in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. Simplified process scheme of the membrane assisted selective propane dehydrogenation unit in open architecture.
Catalytic units (R-101 nd R-102) consists in a tubular stainless steel AISI 310 reactor with a nominal diameter of 1” SCH40 (o.d. 33.6 mm; wall thickness 3.78 mm, and a length of 400 mm and a wall thickness of 3.78 mm. In the central part of the reactor, 31.25 g of commercial catalyst (3 mm pellets, Pt-Sn based, confidential supplier) was loaded, and locked by filling the remaining part of the reactor with inert material, that minimized the residence time of reactants and products in the homogeneous phase at reaction temperature. The reactor was sealed by a couple of flanges, each provided by a ¼” tube aimed to allow the entrance of reactants or outlet of products. Two thermocouples were placed in the reactor through 4 mm blind tubes inserted in the flanges, in order to evaluate gas temperature in the input and the output sections of the catalytic bed.
The separation unit is constituted by a Pd-based commercial membrane (confidential supplier): the perm-selective layer is deposed on a stainless steel porous tube (o.d. 12.7 mm) for a length of about 254 mm, assuring a permeating surface of around 0.01 m2. The membrane tube is inserted in a shell tube (nominal diameter 1”, corresponding to 33.6 mm), realized in stainless steel AISI 316L.
The process units were heated through a couple of metalling heating wire, provided by Watlow, wounding the units in a solenoidal shape; two thermocouples were placed on the external surface of the module, in order to control the wall temperature of the unit. The units were then wrapped in a thick layer of insulating mat, to minimize heat loss towards the surrounding. A couple of pressure transducers were placed upstream and downstream reactor; pressure and temperature signals were collected by a multifunctional display and acquired by PC for overall process monitoring.
Propane (99.5%), propylene (99.5%), hydrogen (99.9995%), air (99.99%) and nitrogen (99.999%), as gaseous reactants, and liquid water could be fed to the reaction system through thermal based (for gases) or Coriolis based (for liquids) mass flow controllers; the liquid water was vaporized in an electrical heating based on a heating cartridge provided by Watlow. All piping in the plant was heated by electrical heating wires, that assured a process stream temperature of about 180 °C, in order to avoid any condensation phenomena in the lines. An actuated valve is placed at the end of the plant, in order to control operating pressure of the system.
A sampling line network, linked to an Agilent Technologies 7820A GC system equipped with TCD and FID detectors, assured the gas analysis downstream the process units, in order to evaluate gas composition along the reaction system.
2.2. Experimental procedure
Reaction units were loaded with 31.25 g of catalyst, fixed in the central part of the reaction tube; catalyst was activated in situ through a hydrogen rich stream. Catalytic tests were carried out by feeding to the system a propane and steam, assuring a steam-to-propane ratio of 1:4 (corresponding to 20 vol% of steam in the feed). Operating conditions effect was evaluated in terms of dependence on operating pressure, operating temperature and contact time (by varying a parameter, and by fixing the others): in particular, temperature ranged between 400 and 600 °C, operating pressure between 1–6 atm, and WHSV (weight hourly space velocity, equal to the ratio between propane mass rate and the mass of catalyst) between 4 h−1 and 16 h−1.
Stability tests were carried out by fixing system feed ratio (steam-to-propane = 1:4), pressure (6 atm), temperature (500 °C and 540 °C) and contact time (WHSV = 8 h−1), and by carrying out the catalytic process for up to 40 h.
Catalytic performances were evaluated in terms of propane conversion, propylene selectivity or products yield, summarized respectively in Eqs. (8)–(10), where FA indicates the molar rate of the compound A.

(10)
Conversion values were compared to an ideal thermodynamic system, in which only the propane dehydrogenation reaction (Eq. (1)) occurs, neglecting all other side reactions.
2.3. Mathematical model
The developed mathematical model is based to a mass balance of PFR (Plug Flow Reactor), so the product concentrations increase with stream. The mass balance of PFR is in microscopic scale and refers to the i-species in the reactor and the reference volume is generic.
The model treats the reactor like a cylinder with axial development, where there is the catalyst fixed bed (vacuum fraction is constant). The scheme of the reactor used in the model is represented in Fig. 2.

The generalized differential expression for each species in molar terms was reported in (Eq. (11)) [22]
(11)
where
•
Ci is the concentration of i, in mol m−3;
•
v is the velocity vector, in m s−1;
•
Din is the diffusivity of i respect to all other species n ≠ j, in m2 s−1;
•
ri is the production velocity of species i, in mol s−1 m−3.
According to a real PFR simplification, the velocity vector only has the vz non-zero axial component, moreover the absence of diffusive mass transfer limitations was supposed. So, by imposing steady state, the generalized differential equation could be simplified (Eq. (12)), where Qz is the volumetric flow rate that of course is not constant along the catalytic volume.
(12)
The void fraction ε is an important parameter to determine the residence time and the effective catalytic bed volume. It results as the complement of the ratio between the bulk volume of the catalyst Vc and the total volume of the reactor portion occupied by the catalytic bed Vl (Eq. (13)).
(13)
For the kinetic expression of the dehydrogenation reaction, several equations were used, the first corresponds to a power law equation while the other are based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood model. For each expression a mathematical model was built and the different models were then compared. Below are the two kinetic expressions used (Mod 1, Mod 2) for the dehydrogenation reaction (Eq. (1)).
(14)
(15)
The Mod 2 (Eq. (15)) derived from a model proposed by Farjoo et al. [23], in which authors supposed the competitive adsorption of side products (CH4, C2H4 and C2H6) and the products of principal reaction. Instead, in Mod 2 (Eq. (15)) it was supposed that only methane and propylene are competitive species with propane adsorption.
The adsorption constant (Ki) constants at the denominator of each expression are calculated with the Arrhenius equation (Eq. (16)).
(16)
Where K0i is the frequency factor, Eai is the activation energy in J/mol, R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol K) and T represents the reaction temperature in K.
For all three expressions, the Keq was calculated according to an empirical expression (Eq. (17)) dependent on the temperature where the reference pressure P0 is the atmospheric pressure expressed in Pa and the temperature is in K [2].
(17)
All the side reactions rates are expressed by power-law equations that depends on a kinetic constant and on partial pressures of reactants [23]. In particular, (Eq. (18)) referred to propane hydrogenolysis (Eq. (2)), (Eq. (19)) referred to propane cracking (Eq. (3)), and (Eq. (20)) referred to propane coking (Eq. (4)).
(18)
(19)
(20)
To limit the loss of activity, steam is supplied as a diluent in the reactant stream that interacts with the catalyst to disadvantage the formation of coke.
The role of steam is to inhibit the cracking reactions and to do gasification of the coke on the surface of the catalyst, in this way the catalyst resulting improved in stability and in life.
Steam can react so reforming and water gas shift reactions may occur, and these secondary reactions (Eqs. (5)–(7)) have also been considered with related kinetic expressions (Eqs. (21)–(23)).
(21)
(22)
(23)
Partial pressures are expressed in Pa, while kinetic constants are calculated with the Arrhenius equation (Eq. (14)).
The kinetic modelling of the process is based on differential first order equations that has been solved using a numerical procedure based on finite differences. Discrimination of models and calculation of kinetic parameters has been carried out by fitting the experimental composition observed in experimental tests to the model predictions achieved by using the kinetic equations.
To obtain the optimal values of the rate parameters in the kinetic model, by comparing the experimental data with the model predictions, the square residuals minimization method was used. It was defined a function SSR (Eq. (24)) as the sum of square residuals, corresponding to the difference between the experimental values and those calculated by model.
(24)
For each investigated model the kinetic parameters were determined by taking into account simultaneously all the experimental tests. As a result, parameters optimization (in terms of pre-exponential factors K0i and activation energies Eai for each kinetic constant and adsorption constants) for the investigated operating conditions were achieved.
2.3.1. Deactivation model
Since the catalytic system involved in the propane dehydrogenation suffers for an unavoidable deactivation due to several phenomena (coke deposition, active metals sintering [24], [25]), a mathematical model able to predict activity loss of catalyst was required. In a widely accepted point of view, catalyst deactivation was strictly related to the coke deposition, that of course is affected by operating conditions. Despite the deactivation rate could depend on gas composition, several deactivation models were reported in literature, in which activity decay was related to the time of the process [26], [27]. Starting that the above mentioned kinetic expressions are intended to refer to the fresh catalyst, while due to catalyst deactivation the kinetic rates are expected to be reduced by time-on-stream (TOS), the catalyst activity was defined (Eq. (25)) for each involved reaction, defined as the ratio between the reaction rate at time t and the reaction rate of fresh catalyst [28].
(25)
The catalyst activity coefficient ai is expected to decrease from 1 (at t = 0) to 0: the dependence on time was expected to be an independent first-order decay law (Eq. (26)).
(26)
where Bi and ni are parameters to be evaluated for each reaction i. Also in this case, parameters evaluation was performed by the least squares method.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst performances
In a first stage, catalyst performances were evaluated by investigating the effect of operating temperature; catalytic study was carried out on the R-101 unit. In Fig. 3 were summarized results for a reaction system characterized by 1 atm of gas pressure and 20% of co-fed steam. In accordance to thermodynamic prediction, experimental results showed a propane conversion increasing with temperature, on the other hand the catalytic system appeared not able to reach thermodynamic equilibrium conversion. In particular, the approach to equilibrium was about 55% along for the entire test, and slightly decreases at higher temperatures. On the other hand, significantly high values of propylene selectivity were obtained ranging around 98% up to 500 °C. It is relevant the huge decreasing in propylene selectivity for the high temperature, that reached the value of 95% at 550 °C; the selectivity reduction was led mainly to the enhancement of side-reactions, such as cracking and coking. As reported in Fig. 3-b, above 500 °C a sensible increasing in coke yield was recorded, while C1-C2 selectivity constantly grew in the whole temperature range. Such achievements underlined the difficulty to join the requirement of high propylene production, achievable at high temperature, and high selectivity, for which high temperature is detrimental.

The same analysis was carried out by increasing operating pressure at 6 atm, fixing the other conditions. As reported in Fig. 4, the higher pressure facilitates a better approach to thermodynamic equilibrium; on the other side, once again the experimental conversion diverged by thermodynamic prediction for higher pressures. If in one hand such unexpected result could be induced by a partial deactivation of the catalyst during tests (carried out by increasing temperature in steps of 25 °C, each temperature was held for at least 40 min), it is not negligible the occurrence of a homogeneous reaction after catalytic bed, in which propylene could be back-converted to propane. On the contrary, very interesting results could be observed through selectivities analysis. Despite the higher operating pressure, propylene selectivity was very high up to 500 °C, assuming values higher than 97%; similarly, coke selectivity assumed values similar to the room temperature test. Differently, lighter hydrocarbon production appeared strongly influenced both by operating pressure and mainly by gas temperature.

Furthermore, an investigation on the operative pressure effect on catalytic system performances was carried out: the results, in terms of propane conversion, propylene and side-products selectivities, were summarized in Fig. 5. According to results summarized in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, by increasing temperature a better approach to thermodynamic equilibrium could be observed: according to the wider diffused kinetic expressions [9], [29], [30], propane dehydrogenation reaction rate strongly depends on involved species partial pressures, and in turn on total pressure of the catalytic system, making the system very fast. On the other hand, Fig. 5-a revealed a weaker dependence of selectivities on operating pressure, since propylene selectivity ranged around 97–98%. The selectivity to gaseous side-products, as well as the estimated selectivity to coke, appeared quite constant: a moderate increasing in C1-C2 selectivity could be appreciated (raising from 0.49% to 0.70%), balanced to a weak reduction in coke selectivity (decreasing from 1.74% to 1.43%).

It is worth to underline that in all investigated operating conditions, it was not revealed the presence of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, thus remarking the high selectivity of the catalyst against the reforming reactions, that resulted inhibited in the process.
3.2. Model discrimination and parameter estimation
The experimental data, previously described, were used to optimize each mathematical model and to determine the parameters of kinetic expressions. The large quantity of experimental data contributes to more precise results from a statistical point of view.
The parameters optimization was carried out by comparing data fittings of the 2 different models, in which side-reactions kinetic expressions were the same, while kinetic expression of propane dehydrogenation were different for the model 1 (Eq. (15)) and model 2 (Eq. (16)). The comparison between the two models were reported in terms of propane conversion at several operating conditions (Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8). As reported, an appreciable approach between models prediction and experimental conversion could be observed for all investigated conditions. The two models seemed to well follow the conversion trend in the temperature ranging, evidencing a better accordance for the lower operating temperature. A more visible deviation from experimental points could be noticed for the low operating pressure, for which model 1 seemed to not be adequate to well describe catalyst behavior, whereas model 2 allowed a good fitting in the whole investigated range.

The overall quality of the fitting between models and experimental data can be appreciated from the parity plots (Fig. 9, Fig. 10) in which experimental volumetric fraction of propane, propylene and hydrogen were compared to models prediction. Proposed diagrams once again evidenced the overall good quality of both models; the evaluation of the coefficient of determination (R2) for the proposed models confirmed the better prediction of Model 2 (R2 = 0.969) with respect of Model 1 (R2 = 0.897). Such achievement indicates the role of some products, in particular propylene and methane, in a competitive adsorption with propane on the catalyst surface.

The comparison between gaseous side-products and models achievement were summarized in Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13. As observed, the optimization of kinetic parameters for the mathematical model of side-reactions assured an excellent fitting between experimental points and model prediction, therefore validating the preliminary assumption on reaction mechanism. The trends for the two models appeared quite similar, but once again model 2 showed a better fitting to the experimental data, as clearly evidenced by the ethylene distribution diagram (Fig. 13).

In Table 1 are summarized the parameters value of proposed model, while in Table 2 the comparison of estimated activation energy with values reported in the literature was summarized. The kinetic constant k5, k6 and k7 are not reported because of the absence of reforming reactions during experimental tests (k5 = k6 = k7 = 0). The activation energy for propane dehydrogenation resulted 74.9 kJ/mol, similar to the results reported in literature for propane dehydrogenation in presence of oxygenated compounds [31]. In particular, resulted bigger than other studies that developed models at different pressure conditions [1], [30]. A good accordance was also observed for the activation energy of cracking reaction, while very different values could be evidenced for the propane hydrocracking and coking reactions.

3.3. Deactivation
Stability tests were carried out for the catalytic system: experimental tests were performed at two operating temperatures (500 °C and 540 °C), experimental results in terms of propane conversion and selectivity to propylene were reported in Fig. 14, Fig. 15, Fig. 16. At lower temperature the catalyst showed better stability over time in terms of propane conversion: after 40 h of time-on-stream, the catalyst system recorded an activity loss of about 20%, decreasing from a propane conversion of 6.4% to 5.2%. On the other hand at 540 °C, although in the early hours the catalyst reached higher conversions, a huge performance drop could be observed after around 10 h, resulting in an abrupt activity loss after 35 h of test, reaching a propane conversion reduction of about 66%.

Propylene selectivity, shown in Fig. 15, showed very high values in the first test hours for both operating conditions. On the contrary, at 540 °C the selectivity decreases slowly up to 25 h of test where it undergoes a sharp decrease: such achievement, linked to the observed propane conversion reduction, could be addressed to a predominant deactivation of dehydrogenation reaction (Eq. (2)) with respect to the other side reactions, leading to a sensible loss in propylene selectivity of the system. Instead, at 500 °C, the selectivity is higher than 98%, recording a sensible increasing along the TOS test: such result, coupled to the slight reduction of propane conversion, could suggest that deactivation occurred in the first hours involved mainly the deactivation catalytic sites active toward cracking reactions, according with experimental achievement reported in the literature [32]. In an overall context, reported results underlined the relevance of the operating temperature on deactivation of the catalyst.
Based on experimental data, the parameters of catalytic activity (Eq. (25)) were evaluated for the selected catalytic system, so that the catalyst stability can be predicted at 500 °C and 540 °C. From the graphical comparison reported in Fig. 14, Fig. 16, it can be noticed that the proposed models well fitted the experimental data.
The parameters of catalytic activity estimated by statistical analysis are shown in Table 3. For the propane cracking reaction (Eq. (4)), the low amount of ethylene in the system did not allowed an estimation of deactivation. Moreover, at 540 °C, the evaluated coke production seemed to not suffered on any deactivation, therefore suggesting that the coking reaction mainly took place in the homogeneous phase, before or after the catalytic volume.

3.4. Membrane-based system operation
A preliminary test was carried out in order to evaluate the impact of the membrane integration on the catalytic system: in this aim, a system constituted by 3 catalytic unit separated by 2 membranes was considered. Such configuration was achieved by employing the available experimental plant (reactor – membrane – reactor), and by analysing the stream at the outlet of the system. In a second stage, the obtained stream was fed to the partial system membrane-reactor, so simulating a system “reactor-membrane-reactor-membrane-reactor”. The separation units placed downstream the catalytic reactors will (partially) remove the hydrogen obtained in the reaction unit, enabling the following catalytic stage to a further conversion of propane. All catalytic units were loaded with the same amount of catalyst (31.25 g), and held at 500 °C; the membrane was held at 370 °C, and a sweep stream of 1.5 NL/min was fed in the permeate side. The system was fed with 250 g/h of propane and 25.6 g/h of steam, resulting in a steam-to-propane molar ratio of 0.25 (C3H8:H2O = 80:20); the operating pressure was fixed to 6 atm, pressure drops along the system were negligible. Gas composition was analysed after each process unit, moreover permeated flow rate from M 101 separation unit was measured through a volumetric flow rate measure device (BIOS Definer 220). The performances of the evaluated system were summarized in Fig. 17. In particular, propane conversion along the system was evaluated and compared to the conversion of an ideal system (in which all catalytic stages reach thermodynamic equilibrium, all separation units remove completely the hydrogen). As reported in Fig. 17, the presence of the membrane assured an increasing propane conversion along the system, allowing values above thermodynamic conversion of a traditional unit without membranes. The experimental points seem to well follow the trend of the ideal system, despite a non-negligible deviation from ideal trend was observed, more evident for the more diluted system.

To better understand the behaviour of the membrane assisted system, performances of the involved units were analysed, in terms of propane conversion for each catalytic unit, and the efficiency of the separation unit, defined as the ratio between the permeated hydrogen with respect to the fed hydrogen (Fig. 18).

As reported in Fig. 18, catalytic stages were able to reach their thermodynamic equilibrium, evidencing that the catalyst amount loaded in the reaction units was not the limiting stage. The thermodynamic equilibrium was better approached in the second and third catalytic units, of course due to the wider gap to recover in the first reactor; such achievement evidenced also that the excess of propylene fed in the R-102 and R-103 was not responsible for any evident inhibition for the catalytic activity. Therefore, the gap between the tested configuration and the ideal system was ascribable to thermodynamic limitations of the catalytic stages, and thus to a non-optimal separation efficiency of the membrane units. As reported in Fig. 18-b, separation efficiency was quite far from ideality, being below 50% in the investigated conditions; in particular, separation efficiency decreases along the system, being higher for the earliest separation unit: such difference was related to the different hydrogen volumetric fraction in the two units, whereas propane conversion, and thus hydrogen production, was more evident in the first catalytic unit. The analysis of permeated hydrogen trough membrane in the two stages allowed to estimate the average permeance value of the unit, that resulted 3.73 mol/m2 s Pa0.5, resulting significantly lower with respect to other membrane analysis available in the literature [33].
4. Conclusions
A novel process scheme for propylene production via propane dehydrogenation has been investigated. The solution foresees the integration of the reaction unit with a Pd based membrane for the recovery of hydrogen, enabling accordingly the shift of chemical equilibrium and the attainment of a sustainable propane conversion even at lower temperature than conventional one. Such solution enables for a better stability of the catalyst, and accordingly a prolonged operation time without need for catalyst regeneration.
A well extensive mathematical model has been developed to describe catalyst performance and deactivation. The model has been derived on conventional Pt based catalyst and verified with experimental tests performed to this aim.
Catalyst activity and stability has been modeled and tested at two operating temperatures, 500 and 540*C and considering the effect of steam in the process stream.
A good agreement between experimental results and kinetic model has been found. The same kinetic model has been applied also to predict the catalyst behavior in the presence of membrane.
The overall obtained results clearly indicate that the novel system can be considered a valuable promising solution to push the catalyst stability, reducing the extent of coke formation on the catalyst.
Further enhancement of catalyst formulation could lead more and more to an increased stability during operation, reducing the need for catalyst regeneration.
