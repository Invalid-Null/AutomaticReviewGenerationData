 Unfortunately there is insufficient information in the provided document to extract detailed catalyst information as requested. The document focuses on modeling propane dehydrogenation rather than describing a specific novel catalyst. No catalyst name, composition, or preparation method details are provided. The modeling results also do not include quantified performance metrics like conversion percentage or selectivity. Since the key requested details about a novel catalyst are not present, I cannot populate the XML output template.
