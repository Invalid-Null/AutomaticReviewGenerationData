Abstract
The development of highly stable propane dehydrogenation catalyst is significant with the growing extraction of shale gas in the world. A highly dispersed MnOx site decorated dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle support was prepared by simple in-situ emulsion method. It shows exceptionally ability to disperse and stabilize Pt clusters. The strong interaction between Pt and Mn formed and the electron transfer happened from Mn to Pt, which leads to an increase in the electron density of Pt. The high propane dehydrogenation activity, even for 100 h long-term test, was obtained on moderate Mn content catalyst. According to the experimental results and DFT calculation, the highly dispersed PtMn alloyed nanoparticles play an important role in enhancing the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation via a good balance on propane activation and propene desorption.

1. Introduction
Propene as an important raw chemical intermediate is widely used for the production of polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, etc. With the rising demand for propene, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has attracted growing attention due to the price gap between propene and propane and the continuously explored of shale gas [1], [2], [3]. Supported Pt-based catalysts are mostly widely used for PDH process [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. However, catalyst deactivation caused by coke deposition and Pt sintering remains challenging and the frequent regeneration is required. Hence, it is significant to develop more stable Pt-based catalysts with long-term stability and less frequent regeneration cycle.
Great efforts have been devoted to develop the stable Pt-based catalysts, including introduction metal promoter and modification of support. Promoters such as Sn, In, Ga, Ir, Zn, Ge and Cu are effective in improving catalytic performance by increasing Pt dispersion and modifying the electronic property of Pt atom [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. Recently, reported Pt3Mn bimetallic system can also catalyze PDH reaction and it focus on the effect of subsurface layers on catalytic reaction [16]. However, the promotion effect of Mn and the influence of PtxMny alloy extent on PDH reaction are not involved, which is important for understanding the promotion effect of Mn. Therefore, it needs to be further investigated due to few reports of Mn promoter for PDH. During the PDH process, the dehydrogenation of propane is insensitive to the Pt particle size, while the undesired side reaction, such as hydrogenolysis, isomerization and cracking, are sensitive to Pt particle size. Therefore, the small and highly dispersed Pt nanoparticles are preferred for PDH reaction [17], [18]. Silica is a good candidate as a catalytic support to study the relationship between the characteristics of active sites and catalytic performance since its morphology is easily constructed and chemical inert property. However, compared with metal oxides support, such as TiO2, the weak interaction between Pt species and silica support makes the easy formation of big Pt particles and thus reduces the stability of these catalysts during PDH reaction [19], [20], [21], [22]. Usually, the specific preparation method, including organometallic chemistry method and thermolytic molecular precursor approach, and expensive Pt or promoter metal precursors are used to synthesize the highly dispersed small nanoparticles catalyst [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. But it is restricted during the industrial process. Therefore, to prepare the highly dispersed Pt-based catalyst, the silica support should be modified. In the present work, a simple in-situ emulsion method was developed to prepare the highly dispersed MnOx decorated dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticle (Mn-DMSN) support. And the highly dispersed Pt catalyst (Pt/Mn-DMSN) was obtained by incipient wetness impregnation method using H2PtCl6·6H2O as the precursor. We show that the catalyst with moderate Mn content (Pt/0.5Mn-silica) shows high PDH activity and stability. The high catalytic performance for Pt/Mn-silica catalyst can be attributed to the combination of highly dispersed PtMn nanoparticles and moderated alloying degree.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Catalyst preparation
DMSN support were prepared by means of emulsion method according to the procedure reported in the literature except the absence of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane [28].
Mn-DMSN support was synthesized by means of in-situ emulsion method. In a typical procedure, 0.5 g of CTAB and the determined amounts of Mn(NO3)2 were dissolved in an emulsion system composed of 70 mL of H2O, 0.8 mL of aqueous ammonia, 15 mL of ethyl ether and 15 mL of ethanol. After the mixture was stirred for 0.5 h at room temperature, 2.5 mL of TEOS was quickly dripped into the above mixture. The resulting mixture was stirred for 4 h. After filtrated and washed with ethanol and deionized water for three times, the sample was dried at 60 °C for 12 h and then calcined at 550 °C for 4 h to achieve Mn-DMSN support. The Mn doping amounts are 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 wt%. For the sake of brevity, the Mn-DMSN support would be named as xMn-DMSN, where x represents Mn doping amount.
Pt/Mn-DMSN catalysts were prepared by means of incipient wetness impregnation method using H2PtCl6·6H2O as the precursor. Typical procedures are as follows: 13.3 mg of H2PtCl6·6H2O were diluted in 2.0 mL H2O. Subsequently, the solution containing the precursor was incipient impregnated into 1.0 g of the Mn-DMSN support. Then the mixture was sonicated for 30 min and dried at 60 °C for 12 h. Afterwards, the catalysts were calcined at 500 °C for 4 h. The loading amount of Pt was 0.5 wt% on all samples. All samples were labeled as Pt/xMn-DMSN.
For comparison, Al2O3-supported PtSn catalyst was also prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method with the loading amounts of Pt and Sn of 0.5 and 1.0 wt%, respectively. Al2O3 support was purchased from Henan Qingquan Environmental Protection Technology Co., LTD without any treatment. The impregnation process was the same to that of Pt/Mn-DMSN catalyst.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The Mn doping amounts on Mn-DMSN supports were determined by ICP-MS on Agilent 7900 instrument.
Zeta potential was measured on a Malvern Nano ZS90 analyser. The procedure are as the follows: 10 mg sample was added into 1000 mL aqueous solution, and then dispersed with ultrasonic 1 min. The solution was then transferred into a measuring cell, and three measurements were performed for each sample.
XRD patterns were obtained by a powder X-ray diffractometer (Ultima IV) using Cu Ka (λ = 0.15406 nm) radiation with a Nickel filter operating at 40 kV and 40 mA in the 2θ range of 10–90° at a scanning rate of 10° min−1.
Temperature-programmed reduction with H2 (H2-TPR) measurements were performed on micromeritics AutoChem II 2920. 0.1 g samples were pretreated under air atmosphere at 300 °C for 1 h and subsequently cooled to 50 °C. Afterwards, 10% H2/Ar flow (40 mL min−1) was passed over the catalyst bed while the temperature was ramped from 50 to 850 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The hydrogen consumption signal was monitored by a TCD.
Raman spectra were performed on Renishaw inVia Reflex Raman spectrometer with a 325 nm laser for the spent samples at room temperature under ambient conditions.
The amount of coke deposited was determined on a thermogravimetric analyzer STA 449 F5 (Netzsch). The sample was exposed to O2 at 50 mL min−1 and heated from ambient temperature to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
A Tensor II fourier-transform infrared spectra (FTIR) equipped with a diamond crystal attenuated total reflectance (ATR) was used for spectral acquisition. Before each measurement, the ATR plate was washed with ethanol and allowed to dry naturally. Then, each sample was applied to the ATR crystal and the indoor environment was used as background. The spectra were recorded in the range of 4000–400 cm−1 at a resolution of 4 cm−1.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken on JEOL JEM 2100 electron microscope equipped with a field emission source at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The TEM samples were sonicated and well suspended in ethanol. Drops of the suspension were applied and after drying the fine particles were well dispersed on a copper grid coated with carbon. STEM images and EDS mapping were taken on a FEI TECNAI G2 F20 (200 kV) transmission electron microscope. The sizes of Pt nanoparticles were measured with the Digital Micrograph software.
DRIFTS experiments were performed on a Bruker VERTEX 80v Fourier-transformed infrared spectrometer equipped with a mercury-cadmium-telluride (MCT) detector to investigate the structure of Pt and PtMn using CO as a probe molecule. The samples were placed in an in-situ DRIFTS cell with ZnSe windows, pretreated with 10% H2/He (30 mL min−1) at 300 °C for 1 h, and then cooled to 60 °C under He flow. After cooling to 60 °C, the background was collected. After that, the sample was exposed to 10% CO/He for 30 min. Finally, the sample was purged by He for another 30 min, and then the spectra were recorded.
Pt dispersions were measured on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 automated characterization system. 100 mg of the sample was loaded in a U-shaped quartz tube and heated to 400 °C for 30 min in the flow of H2, then switched to pure Ar and cooled to 40 °C. Then 10% H2/Ar was introduced by switching the six-way valve for pulse adsorption.
2.3. Catalytic activity test
The activity measurements for propane dehydrogenation were carried out in a conventional quartz tubular microreactor. The catalyst was placed in the center of the reactor. Before the reaction, the catalyst was reduced with 10% H2/Ar at 500 °C for 4 h. The reaction products were analyzed with an online Agilent 7890B gas chromatography. An aluminum column was used for the separation of CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8. The carbon balance during the reaction is calculated based on all gas-phase compositions and had an average deviation from closure of <5%. The formation rate of C3H6 were carried out under kinetic reaction conditions, turnover frequency (TOF) of C3H6 formation normalized to the surface atoms of Pt in kinetic regime were calculated using the following equations:
where FC3H8 represents the flow rate of propane in mL min−1; XC3H8 represents the conversion of propane; SC3H6 represents selectivity of propene; DPt represents the dispersion of Pt.
A first-order deactivation model was used to evaluate the catalyst stability:
where Xintial and Xfinal represent the conversion of propane measured at the initial and final period of an experiment, respectively. And t represents the reaction time (h). kd is the deactivation rate constant (h−1).
2.4. Computation methods
All the calculations were done by using the Gaussian 09 software [29]. The structure optimization and electronic energies were obtained by using B3LYP functional with the 6-31G** basis set for H and C atoms and the effective-core potential LANL2DZ for Pt and Mn atoms. Zero point energy correction was included. All the atoms in the clusters were allowed to relax during the geometry optimization. The ground and transition state structures were verified by the vibrational frequency calculation. The transition state structure has one and only one image frequency. Reaction barrier was evaluated as the energy difference between initial and transition state.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of Mn-DMSN support
The real Mn doping amounts in Mn-DMSN supports were determined by ICP-MS and the results are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the real contents of Mn are higher than the theoretical content with the doping amount below 4 wt%, indicating some of silica precursor is not involved in cooperative assembly of the final structure. However, high Mn doping amount in gel, 4 wt% in this work, affect the cooperative self-assembly of DMSN support, and excessive Mn cannot be fully incorporated into the DMSN matrix [30]. According to the ICP-MS analysis, it can be deduced that the simple in-situ emulsion method is efficient on the synthesis of Mn-DMSN supports.
Table 1. Mn content on Mn-DMSN supports measured by ICP-MS.
Samples Theoretical content/wt% ICP measured content/wt%
0.1Mn-DMSN 0.1 0.12
0.5Mn-DMSN 0.5 0.52
1Mn-DMSN 1 1.30
2Mn-DMSN 2 2.17
4Mn-DMSN 4 3.86
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of Mn-DMSN supports. For DMSN support, the broad peak at about 23° can be ascribed to amorphous SiO2. It can be noted that there is no change on the patterns of Mn-DMSN supports with Mn content below 2 wt%, which indicates the Mn species highly dispersed on the surface of DMSN or doped into the framework of the DMSN on low Mn doping amounts supports (0.1Mn-DMSN, 0.5Mn-DMSN and 1Mn-DMSN). However, the diffraction at 36.1° appeared with further increasing of Mn amount. It indicates some Mn3O4 crystalline formed on the surface of DMSN on high Mn loading amount supports (2Mn-DMSN and 4Mn-DMSN).

In order to further investigate the influence of Mn on DMSN support, FT-IR characterization were carried out. Fig. 2 shows the FT-IR spectra of Mn-DMSN supports. The spectrum of DMSN shows the characteristic bands at 453 cm−1, 798 cm−1 and 1076 cm−1 of the bending, symmetric stretching and asymmetric stretching modes of Si-O-Si, respectively [31], [32], [33]. And these bands shift on Mn-DMSN supports, indicating that some Mn ions incorporated into the framework of Si-O-Si and replaced Si to form Si-O-Mn. This phenomenon also can be demonstrated by the Raman spectra with the shift of Raman band at about 986 cm−1 (Fig. S1). Most importantly, the surface Si-OH band at 962 cm−1 were suppressed on Mn-DMSN supports indicating some MnOx species dispersed on the surface of DMSN and consumed the silanol groups. This decoration of surface MnOx species is important because it changes the surface electrical behavior of Mn-DMSN support. Fig. 3 shows the changes of zeta potential in Mn-DMSN supports. It can be seen that DMSN support exhibits negative charge (zeta potential of −21.2 mV in Fig. 3) due to the presence of ionizable silanol charge on the surface. Compared with DMSN support, the zeta potential of Mn-DMSN support increases with the increasing of Mn content to 2 wt% because of the consumption of silanol groups. It indicates that the negative charge on Mn-DMSN surface decreases due to the formation of highly dispersed MnOx species on Mn-DMSN surface. However, the zeta potential are lower on 4Mn-DMSN than that on 2Mn-DMSN, which may be caused by the formation of crystalline Mn3O4 other than highly dispersed MnOx species.

Impregnation method, as a common method in preparing industrial catalysts, usually results in the aggregation of Pt when using H2PtCl6·6H2O as the precursor and silica as the support. Compared with other organometallic Pt precursor, H2PtCl6·6H2O shows relatively low price and is widely used in industry. According to XRD, FT-IR and zeta potential characterizations, it can be seen that DMSN support exhibits large amount of negative charges due to the presence of ionizable silanol charge on the surface. The DMSN support with negative charge shows repulsive force to the [PtCl6]2− species during the impregnation process. Therefore, the large Pt nanoparticles with widely size dispersion formed on DMSN support. In this work, a simple in-situ emulsion method was used to prepare the Mn-DMSN support. Compared with DMSN support, Mn-DMSN supports show fewer negative charges because of the formation of MnOx sites on the surface of Mn-DMSN. And the sites caused by Mn decoration makes the presence of anchor points for [PtCl6]2− species because of the relative positivity on MnOx sites. Therefore, the decoration of DMSN with Mn makes it be a suitable support for increasing the dispersion and stability of Pt clusters.
3.2. Characterization of Pt/Mn-DMSN catalysts
The Pt/Mn-DMSN catalysts were then prepared by incipient wetness impregnation method using H2PtCl6·6H2O as the precursor. Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of the calcined samples. For the Pt/DMSN catalyst, a weak peak at 2θ of 39.8° can be assigned to (1 1 1) reflection of cubic Pt [34]. Compared with DMSN support, the Mn-DMSN supports show more stronger interaction with Pt, which is demonstrated by the XRD results that the diffraction peak intensity of Pt is weaker and the peak even disappears with the increasing of Mn doping amounts. According to the comparison of Mn-DMSN supports (Fig. 1) and Pt/Mn-DMSN catalysts (Fig. 4), it can be deduced that the Pt species are mainly and selectively deposited on the highly dispersed MnOx (or Mn3O4) sites not on the SiO2 sites. The TEM images in Fig. 5 also demonstrate that the dispersion of Pt on Pt/Mn-DMSN catalysts increases with the increasing of Mn amounts. Fig. 5a shows the TEM image of Pt/DMSN. It can be noted that the large Pt nanoparticles about 5–20 nm with widely size dispersion formed on DMSN support, which is caused by the negative charge from the repulsive force shows to the [PtCl6]2− species. And the scheme is shown in Fig. 7a. When Pt was supported on 0.1Mn-DMSN support as shown in Fig. 5b, the size of Pt nanoparticles decreases compared to Pt/DMSN. And the size further decreases on Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN catalyst as shown in Fig. 5c. In order to further investigate the morphology and dispersion of Pt on Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN catalyst, STEM characterization was carried out and Fig. 5d shows the STEM image and particle size distribution. The highly dispersed nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution (1.4 ± 0.2 nm) are distributed on the Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN catalyst. The elemental mapping on this sample in Fig. 5f indicates the Mn and Pt uniformly and highly dispersed. All these results suggest that the modification of DMSN by moderate Mn doping makes it be a suitable support for dispersing Pt because of the strengthen of metal-support interaction caused by MnOx sites. And the scheme is shown in Fig. 7a. After treating by 10%H2/Ar at 500 °C for 4 h, the XRD patterns of these samples changed apparently (Fig. 6a). The catalyst with low Mn content (Pt/0.1Mn-DMSN) shows the diffraction peak of Pt3Mn at 2θ of 40.05°, while the catalysts with high Mn content (Pt/4Mn-DMSN) shows the diffraction peak of PtMn3 at 2θ of 40.7°. For Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN and Pt/2Mn-DMSN catalysts, the diffraction peak at 2θ of 40.3° indicates the formation of PtMn alloy [35], [36]. But for Pt/1Mn-DMSN catalyst, there is no diffraction peak even been reduced by H2/Ar. In order to investigate the phase structure of this catalysts, high loading amount catalysts (1Pt/2Mn-DMSN and 2Pt/4Mn-DMSN) with the same ratio of Pt/Mn were prepared and characterized. It can be seen that the diffraction peak of PtMn appeared on these catalysts (Fig. 6b). Therefore, it can be speculated that the Pt and Mn species on Pt/1Mn-DMSN catalyst exist in the form of highly dispersed PtMn alloy. But the strong interaction of PtMn species and the support makes the crystallinity degree of PtMn catalyst lower. Therefore, no diffraction peaks were detected. According to the comparison of these patterns before and after H2/Ar treatment, the strong interaction of Pt and Mn happened during the reduction process. And it results in the formation of PtxMny alloy. Fig. 5e shows the scheme of the process for the formation of highly dispersed Pt species on Mn-DMSN support and the transformation to the PtMn alloy for Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN catalyst. And the brief schemes for all the samples are listed in Fig. 7b. Moreover, a high Mn-doping amount (Pt/4Mn-DMSN) results in the formation of MnO crystalline on the reduced catalysts and the aggregation of PtMn3 nanoparticels during the reducing process. Therefore, moderated Mn amounts (0.5 and 1 wt%) on DMSN support results in the highly dispersed MnOx sites, which can capture the [PtCl6]2− species and anchor Pt nanoparticles. The low (0.1 wt%) Mn amount is insufficient to supply the sites to anchor the Pt species, while the high Mn amounts (2 and 4 wt%) makes the formation of Mn3O4 crystalline,[37] which is unstable under the reduced atmosphere compared to silica.

The states of the metals and the interactions of the metal (oxides) components among themselves and with the supports were investigated by H2-TPR. Fig. 8 displays the H2-TPR curves of the Mn-DMSN supports and the corresponding catalysts. Interestingly, all the Mn-DMSN supports show one H2 consumption peak (peak I) at about 300–420 °C, and the intensity of this peak increases with the increasing of Mn amount. The absence of two H2 consumption peaks indicates the similar type of Mn species in Mn-DMSN supports. And according to the XRD results, the Mn3O4 crystalline exist in 2Mn-DMSN and 4Mn-DMSN. Therefore, it can be deduced that the Mn species exist in the form of Mn3O4-like species in all Mn-DMSN supports. The temperature of peak I increases with the increasing of Mn amount except 1Mn-DMSN sample, which may be caused by the different crystalline degree of Mn3O4 as shown in XRD [38]. The H2 consumption of peak I can be ascribed to the reduction of Mn3O4 to MnO and the amount was calculated by CuO standard sample (Table 2). It can be seen that the value of H2 consumption is quite close to the theoretical value of Mn3O4 species to MnO species on 2Mn-DMSN and 4Mn-DMSN. But for the support with low Mn amounts (Mn < 2), the value is smaller than theoretical value, indicating more Mn species existing in the highly dispersed form of Mn2+. After Pt loaded on the support, the apparent difference appears. The H2 consumption peak (peak II) at about 470 °C, appeared on Pt/DMSN and Pt/0.1Mn-DMSN catalysts, is ascribed to the reduction of PtOxCly [39]. The calculated value of H2 consumption is smaller than the theoretical value of Pt loading amount on Pt/DMSN catalyst, which indicated some Pt species existing in the form of Pt0. The H2 consumption amount on Pt/0.1Mn-DMSN catalyst is smaller than that of Pt/DMSN, indicating strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) happened caused by Mn decoration. And it was demonstrated by the absence of H2 consumption on Pt/0.5Mn DMSN catalyst. Therefore, it can be deduced that Pt species selectively contact with the highly dispersed Mn species in the supports resulting in the highly dispersion and strong interaction with support. With further increasing the Mn amount, the H2 consumption peak (peak III) at 110–120 °C can be ascribe to the reduction of Pt-O-Mn clusters or combined reduction of Mn3O4 and PtOx species in close contact through a spillover effect to PtMn alloy [40]. Compared with the Pt on -O-Mn-O-Si-O- species, the Pt species on Mn3O4 clusters or small crystalline are easily reduced. According to the H2-TPR results, it can be seen that the chemical inert silica support can be activated by in-situ doping Mn, which result in the formation of SMSI. It is very important in catalytic reaction, especially for the thermal catalytic reaction. Because the SMSI can promote the dispersion and inhibit the sintering of Pt.

DRIFTS is an useful characterization technique to investigate the nature of Pt [41]. To further investigate the influence of Mn on the surface structure and electronic property of Pt catalyst, DRIFTS measurement of CO chemisorption was conducted (Fig. 9). For Pt/DMSN, one vibrational band centered at 2088 cm−1 is observed, which is assigned to the linearly bound CO on Pt surface [42], [43]. The linear adsorption peak of the catalyst can be deconvoluted into two peaks assigning to CO linearly adsorbed on different Pt sites. The band at 2088 cm−1 is associated with the CO linearly bound to the terraces or planes that are coordinatively saturated, while the band at 2072 cm−1 is assigned to the CO adsorbed at the corners or apex atoms that are coordinatively unsaturated [44]. Compared with Pt/DMSN catalyst, the red-shifts of CO band to lower wavenumber on the Pt/Mn-DMSN samples indicating the interaction of CO and Pt surface is weakened. It suggests an increase of electron density in Pt, which in turn increases the extent of back-donation to 2π* antibonding orbital of CO [45]. Moreover, Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN catalyst shows the most obvious red-shift on theses Pt/Mn-DMSN catalysts, indicating stronger interaction between Pt and Mn (or MnOx) in Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN than those in other catalysts [46]. That is, the electron density of Pt on Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN catalyst are higher than those in other catalysts, i.e., the extent of electron transfer from Mn to Pt on this sample is the largest one among these catalysts. Moreover, the areas of the peaks assigned to coordinatively unsaturated Pt increase on Pt/Mn-DMSN catalysts are much larger than that of Pt/DMSN catalyst, which indicates the presence of more coordinatively unsaturated Pt sites and that is favorable for the activation of propane.

3.3. Catalytic performance
In order to investigate the intrinsic activity of the catalyst, the catalytic tests were carried out at temperature of 520 °C and WHSV of 9.4 h−1. The mass and heat transport limitations were ruled out for the highest propene formation rate according to the Mears criterion and Weisz-Prater criterion [47], [48]. The Mears criterion for external mass diffusion:
indicating no external mass diffusion limitations. The Weisz–Prater criterion was calculated for internal mass diffusion:
which implies that internal mass transfer limitations can be ignored. The Mears criterion for external (interphase) heat transfer was calculated:
indicating no external heat transfer limitations. Moreover, the Mears criteria:
was used to ensure that combined interphase and intraparticle heat and mass transfer can be neglected. (detailed information and calculation process are described in the Supporting Information). Fig. 10a shows the catalytic performance of Pt/Mn-DMSN catalysts. The initial propene formation rate is 6.0 mol g−1Pt h−1 on Pt/0.1Mn-DMSN catalyst, and it reaches 8.1 mol g−1Pt h−1 on Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN. With further increasing Mn amount, the initial propene formation rate decreases with the lowest rate of 4.6 mol g−1Pt h−1 on Pt/4Mn-DMSN. The TOF values of Pt/Mn-DMSN catalysts were obtained in order to evaluate the catalytic activity of the exposed Pt sites. As shown in Fig. 10b, the TOF value of Pt/0.1Mn-DMSN is 0.69 s−1. And it decreases with the increasing of Mn amount, indicating the different activity of Pt sites on Pt/Mn-DMSN catalysts. According to XRD characterization, Pt species exist in the form of Pt3Mn in Pt/0.1Mn-DMSN catalyst, PtMn in Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN and Pt/1Mn-DMSN catalysts and PtMn3 in Pt/4Mn-DMSN catalyst, respectively (Fig. 10c). The TOF results indicate the Pt sites in Pt3Mn possess the highest ability to activate propane, while the Pt sites in PtMn3 show the lowest activity. The deactivation rate constant kd was calculated on Pt/Mn-DMSN catalysts for 6 h reaction and the results are shown in Fig. 10a. The largest kd of 0.18 h−1 on Pt/0.1Mn-DMSN catalyst indicates the fast deactivation. Compared with Pt/0.1Mn-DMSN catalyst, kd of Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN and Pt/1Mn DMSN are about 0.07 h−1. And it further decreases on Pt/2Mn-DMSN and Pt/4Mn-DMSN catalysts. These results demonstrate that the Pt sites in PtMn3 shows the highest catalytic stability, while the Pt sites in Pt3Mn shows the poorest catalytic stability. By combining the catalytic activity and stability, Pt/0.5Mn catalyst with moderate propane activity and stability was used to test the long-term stability at 590 °C with WHSV of 2.4 h−1 and compared with PtSn/Al2O3. It can be seen from Fig. 10d, the propene formation rate decreased from 5.4 to 0.8 mol g−1Pt h−1 for PtSn/Al2O3, while the propene formation rate decreased from 5.8 to 4.3 mol g−1Pt h−1 on Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN. The obvious difference on the propene formation rate after 100 h indicates the unusual long-term stability of Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN catalyst compared with PtSn/Al2O3.

3.4. The influence of PtMn alloying extent on PDH performance
In order to investigate the promoting effect of Mn and to further understand the relationship between the PtxMny structure and catalytic performance, DFT calculations were carried out. Four PtxMny cluster models (Pt4, Pt3Mn, Pt2Mn2 and PtMn3) were constructed to represent the catalysts with different Mn-doping amounts according to the experimental evidence. In propane dehydrogenation, the deep dehydrogenation of propene has a negative effect and results in the formation of coke. Thus, the competition between propene dehydrogenation and propene desorption was investigated. Fig. 11c shows the energy barrier differences between propene dehydrogenation and propene desorption on Pt4, Pt3Mn, Pt2Mn2 and PtMn3, respectively. The barrier for propene dehydrogenation is lower than that for propene desorption on Pt4 and Pt3Mn (1.17 and 1.14 eV for propene dehydrogenation, 1.60 and 1.70 eV for propene desorption), indicating the propene is more favorable for dehydrogenation to form C3H5* rather than desorption. Although the C-H band activation of propane is easily on Pt3Mn (the barrier of 0 eV), the deep dehydrogenation of propene makes the low stability (kd of 0.18 h−1) on Pt/0.1Mn-DMSN catalyst with the phase of Pt3Mn. On the other hand, the barrier for dehydrogenation of propene is higher than that for propene desorption on Pt2Mn2 and PtMn3 (1.08 and 1.34 eV for propene dehydrogenation, 0.97 and 0.21 eV for propene desorption), indicating that propene is more favorable for desorption on Pt2Mn2 and PtMn3 phase catalysts. It may be because Mn donates electrons to Pt in PtMn alloy, which results in an increase in Pauli repulsion between propene π and Pt d electrons. And this phenomenon has been reported on PtSn system [49], [50]. However, the highest propane C-H activation barrier, 1.45 eV, was observed on PtMn3, indicating the low initial propane dehydrogenation activity, which is demonstrated by the lowest TOF value on Pt/4Mn-DMSN catalyst. According to the DFT and catalytic performance results, the Pt sites in Pt3Mn is more active with the highest TOF value on Pt/0.1Mn-DMSN because of the lowest C-H activation barrier of propane (Fig. 10b and Fig. 11c), while the highest barrier of propene desorption makes the fast deactivation with highest activation rate constant kd of 0.18 h−1 (Fig. 10a and Fig. 11c). And the Pt sites in PtMn3 in Pt/4Mn-DMSN catalyst shows the lowest TOF value due to the highest C-H activation barrier of propane (Fig. 10b and Fig. 11c). Pt sites in PtMn on Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN and Pt/1Mn-DMSN possess the good propane dehydrogenation performance because of a good balance on propane activation and propene desorption.

3.5. The influence of Pt dispersion on PDH performance
It can be seen that Pt/0.1Mn-DMSN catalysts with Pt3Mn crystalline should have shown high initial propane conversion due to the low propane C-H activation barrier. However, the initial propane conversions is lower than that on Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN and Pt/1Mn-DMSN catalysts. Therefore, the dispersion of PtxMny also play an important role in the PDH performance. According to XRD, TEM and CO DRIFT characterizations, Pt/Mn-DMSN catalysts show SMSI compared to Pt/DMSN due to the presence of MnOx anchor sites for Pt species. And the large nanoparticles with the sizes about 5–20 nm formed on Pt/DMSN catalyst, while the much smaller nanoparticles with the sizes about 1.4 nm formed on Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN. And the dispersions of Pt on Pt/0.1Mn-DMSN and Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN are 47.9% and 70.1%, respectively. Therefore, the Pt/0.1Mn-DMSN with highest TOF value shows lower propene formation rate than Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN catalyst. All these results indicate that the dispersion of PtxMny are distinctly different on Pt/DMSN and Pt/Mn-DMSN catalysts. Moreover, the small nanoparticles results in more coordinatively unsaturated Pt sites, which is demonstrated by CO DRIFT spectra. Therefore, the highly dispersed PtMn alloyed species with more coordinatively unsaturated sites are more favorable for the activation of propane.
3.6. Coke analysis
Raman spectroscopy and TGA techniques were used to analyze the type and amount of coke formation on the spent catalysts. The amounts of coke deposited on each catalyst during the reaction were determined by TGA and are presented in Table 3. All of these catalysts show very low coke amounts of <1 wt% after a 6 h run at 520 °C and WHSV of 9.4 h−1. To further determine the graphitization degree of the deposited coke over these catalysts. Raman spectra were taken and are shown in Fig. 12. All the spent catalysts show two bands at about 1365 and 1600 cm−1, which are assigned to D1 band due to in-plane defects and the G band from carbon species containing a highly crystalline structure, respectively [51]. After deconvolution of these spectra, four band can be distinguished as G, D1, D3 and D4 bands. The D3 band with large linewidth at about 1500 cm−1 is assigned to amorphous carbon, while the D4 band at 1220 cm−1 is assigned to disordered graphitic lattice of an A1g symmetry [52]. The intensity ratio of D1 and G band from Raman spectra can be used as a factor to reflect the properties of the coke [53]. As shown in Table 3, the highest ID1/IG ratio of 0.53 on Pt/1Mn-DMSN catalyst suggests the coke with more defects and lower crystallinity, while the lowest ID1/IG ratio of 0.43 on Pt/0.1Mn-DMSN catalyst suggest the coke with high crystallinity. It can be seen that the coke on Pt/0.1Mn-DMSN catalyst with lowest coke amount shows the highest crystallinity, and the coke on Pt/1Mn-DMSN catalyst with largest coke amount is more disordered.

4. Conclusions
In summary, the highly dispersed MnOx sites on DMSN were constructed by simple in-situ emulsion method, and the modified Mn-DMSN support shows exceptionally ability to disperse and stabilize Pt clusters. It was found that the electron transfer happened from Mn to Pt, which leads to an increase in the electron density of Pt. The different PtxMny alloyed-structure nanoparticles (Pt3Mn, PtMn and PtMn3) formed during the activation process and act as the active sites. Both DFT calculation and experimental results demonstrate that the highly dispersed PtMn alloyed nanoparticles play an important role in promoting propane dehydrogenation performance by a good balance on propane activation and propene dehydrogenation. The Pt/0.5Mn-DMSN and Pt/1Mn-DMSN catalysts with highly dispersed PtMn alloyed nanoparticles show excellent propane dehydrogenation stability. Moreover, this work supplies a simple method for the industrial catalyst preparation on the SiO2-based support with the highly dispersed noble metal active sites.
