Emergency shutdowns of propylene production plants: Root cause analysis and availability modeling
Abstract
Unplanned shutdown events in chemical process plants cause revenue losses due to production curtailments, repair costs, and harmful environmental and safety effects on plant personnel and the surrounding community. Several recent studies have used news articles and databases to perform statistical analyses and modeling of the causes and consequences of chemical process accidents, but these studies do not analyze the operating deviations that led to shutdowns. This work structures narratives about unplanned shutdown events into data, analyzes the causes of those events, and uses the collected data to model the failure probability of process plants. A case study comparing two propylene production technologies, steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation is developed. We use a set of 118 shutdown events reported in four sources across a five-year span for 7 propylene production plants. Using this data, the three leading causes for unplanned shutdowns in both propylene production technologies were determined to be: equipment trips/shutdowns, utility supply interruptions, and weather-related events. A power law process (PLP) for data from multiple repairable systems is used to model the failure behavior for both technologies. For the data collected, this procedure indicated an increasing failure intensity function for both technologies, with propane dehydrogenation increasing more significantly. In addition, both maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) and confidence intervals for the PLP parameters are presented. Since these are repairable systems, an estimated inherent availability is determined for both technologies. Finally, recommendations that address how to reduce the occurrence of these events and mitigate their consequences are discussed.
1. Introduction
In recent decades, the complexity and length of industrial supply chains have grown and evolved as companies expand their global footprints in pursuit of higher profit margins. Production networks are designed on the basis of critical factors such as efficiency, cost, and proximity to markets. However, disruptive events have become increasingly regular, with disruptions lasting one month or longer occurring approximately an average of once every 3.7 years per industry across all industries (Lund et al., 2020). These events can take a major financial toll on a company or enterprise, and impact its competitiveness in the global market. They can also cause imbalances in supply or demand, thereby increasing the cost of products and materials.
In the chemical process and refining industry, operating deviations can occur leading to abnormal operation and potentially also hazardous events. These deviations can be of operating limits such as pressure, temperature, level, and flow. There are also major deviations including normal start-up and shutdowns, emergency shutdowns due to trips or equipment failures, and maintenance/inspections (Wells, 1980). Other reasons for shutdowns can be related to unforeseen events such as global pandemics, as is the case with the Covid-19 emergency, and business downturns due to recessions. A suggested classification scheme of shutdown events and their causes is presented in Fig. 1.

Unplanned outages or shutdowns of process plants can have hourly costs of tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars, causing interruptions to production and at times impacting commodity prices. These losses come from product flaring, lost revenue due to the shutdown duration, and repair costs. This is in addition to negative environmental impacts of greenhouse gases emissions resulting from flaring of chemicals, as well as health and safety concerns for plant personnel and the surrounding community. These issues create negative publicity for the plant, company, and technology in question, possibly resulting in increased government fines and regulations which can negatively impact the industry's growth. It is therefore essential to understand the causes and effects of these events. Accordingly, the objectives of this research are to: (1) structure narrative reports about unplanned propylene plant shutdowns into data, (2) analyze the primary causes of these events, (3) use the data to model the unplanned shutdown event probability for these process plants, and (4) assess the impact of these events and associated downtime durations on process economic performance indicators.
2. Literature Review
In the chemical process industry, analysis of accident information and databases can help reduce the occurrence or recurrence of accidents and unplanned shutdowns. This systematic analysis aids in extracting lessons learned from accidents and failures and disseminating these insights on a wider basis, with the ultimate goal of enhancing awareness of process safety and reliability issues both in the design and operational phases of a plant's life cycle (Amyotte et al., 2016).
Within the last ten years, researchers have examined several chemical process accident databases to examine accident causes and draw lessons learned from them. Kidam and Hurme (2013a; 2013b) presented a method for identifying the most accident-prone equipment and main contributing factors to those accidents throughout a process life cycle. Using the Japanese Failure Knowledge Database (FKD) (Hatamura Institute for the Advancement of Technology, 2003), the top three accident-prone equipment were identified to be: piping, reactors and storage tanks, and process vessels; while human/organizational contributors were also determined to be more prevalent in those accidents. Another study used a web-based approach to construct a database of 96 accidents between October 2014 to October 2015 in the upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry (Kannan et al., 2016). The authors determined that 33% and 27% of the accidents were due to either “under investigation” or “unknown” causes, further highlighting the challenges of sharing lessons learned due to the lack of public information. Fyffe et al. (2016) conducted an analysis of 60 incidents from the Chemical Safety Board (CSB) reports database to determine key thematic issues that can be used to enhance the understanding of chemical accidents and potentially prevent, or reduce the impact of, future accidents. These thematic issues were: design and engineering, standards, process hazard analysis, emergency planning and response, and maintenance. Another set of 64 accidents was analyzed by Baybutt (2016) and determined the following issues to be the top contributors to accidents: design, safeguards, operating procedures, and preventive maintenance. Wang et al. (2021) found similar results in an analysis of 79 CSB incident reports that were specific to chemical manufacturing companies. Since chemical process plants have a high degree of technological and organizational complexity, multiple and independent safety barriers must be deployed and their performance can be impacted by inadequate levels of maintenance. To address that gap, maintenance-related accidents from CSB have been investigated using a Work and Accident Process classification scheme to identify accident origins and manifestations (Okoh and Haugen, 2013, 2014). These studies identified releases/emissions to be the primary type of accident and “deficient design, organization and resource management” and “deficient planning/scheduling/fault diagnosis” as the most frequent causes of those accidents.
The problem of investigating and modeling various aspects related to chemical process plant reliability and availability has been examined in a number of studies. Earlier studies used the exponential and Weibull distributions to estimate system availability through reliability block diagrams (RBD) modelling (Khan and Kabir, 1995; Goel et al., 2002). Accident precursor data and Bayesian analysis have been utilized in a dynamic risk assessment approach to estimate the failure probabilities of the safety systems of an exothermic reactor and a storage tank containing hazardous materials (Meel and Seider, 2006; Kalantarnia et al., 2009). The dynamic failure assessment approach demonstrated in these studies highlighted the significant deviations in system failure frequency throughout a process unit lifetime compared to a conventional constant failure assumption. Curcurù et al. (2013) proposed an imprecise fault tree analysis (FTA) methodology which characterizes the top event by the rate of occurrence of failure (ROCOF) rather than the classic metric of probability of occurrence. They applied the methodology to a generic compression and separation process where the top event is liquid entry to a compressor. Sano et al. (2020) used FTA to identify and rank risks in an acrylonitrile plant in terms of probability and severity using a combination of generic and plant-specific failure data. This was supplemented by a feasibility analysis to determine safety investments allocation to reduce potential economic losses from the identified risks. Recent studies explored the integration of equipment failure data in the estimation of expected process economics metrics, such as annual net profit and return on investment (ROI), during the preliminary stages of process design (Al-Douri et al. 2020, 2021; Gordon and Pistikopoulos, 2022). This approach would allow the identification of critical process units in terms of failure probability and repair or restoration duration and propose design modifications with the objective of identifying an economically-optimal alternative to the base case design.
In addition to risk assessment methods based on major accident data, several studies explored the importance of reporting abnormal events and near misses by examining alarm databases (Jones et al., 1999; Pariyani et al., 2010). Further work has been performed using alarm databases to model abnormal events (Lv et al., 2014) and near-misses (Chen et al., 2020) using Bayesian theory with the goal of updating the probability of different consequences such as manual or automatic shutdowns. Hameed and Khan (2014) developed a three-step approach for risk-based shutdown interval modeling for non-emergency planned shutdowns, starting with the selection of a critical set of equipment that may result in a functional failure of a unit or system. The approach was applied to a mixed-refrigerant (MR) cycle in a natural gas liquefaction plant using failure and repair data from the OREDA database (SINTEF, 2015) and qualified plant personnel.
Whereas a significant body of literature exists on the analysis and modeling of chemical accidents using a variety of databases and web resources, there is a need to conduct similar studies with regards to unplanned shutdown events in the process industry. These events are attributed to major equipment reliability issues, weather-related events, electrical power failures, and accidents. Shutdowns can be costly to an operating company because of lost revenue from production outages, repair costs, and product losses due to flaring. There are hazards encountered during the shutdown process itself including the potential formation of explosive mixtures, high pressure and temperature, and contact with toxic substances (Speegle, 2015). This is in addition to potential environmental and safety implications to the wider surrounding community, which ultimately impacts reputation. All of the aforementioned impacts of shutdown events emphasize the need to obtain a greater understanding of their frequency and causes. Leveraging data collection and modeling tools and methods, our understanding of the failure behavior and causes of unplanned process plant shutdowns can be enhanced leading to reductions in their frequency. In turn, this would improve plant reliability and safety, reduce harmful environmental emissions, and increase profit margins.
3. Data and Methods
3.1. Approach
This work proposes a multi-step approach, shown in Fig. 2, to evaluate and compare the reliability characteristics of process technology alternatives by the following steps: (1) identify a commodity chemical product and its relevant technologies, (2) identify a set of candidate process plants for each technology with relevant information (e.g. operator, nameplate capacity, location), (3) use publicly-available resources to track reported shutdown events over an observation period T for each of the candidate process plants identified, (4) determine the leading causes of shutdowns events for each production technology, (5) develop a power-law process model describing the failure (shutdown) behavior of each production technology. This approach can be used to synthesize and inform recommendations with the goal of reducing shutdown events, improving plant reliability and profitability. The approach is to evaluate two propylene production technologies: (1) steam cracking of hydrocarbons, and (2) propane dehydrogenation.

3.2. Data Sources
Relevant information on the set of candidate process plants is publicly available in trade magazines, operating company webpages, and market intelligence studies. However, to ensure anonymity, the operating company names and production capacities of those plants are not included in the results. Instead, plants are identified according to alphabetical letters.
Significant effort is required to collect the data needed for shutdown events. For this work, four publicly-available resources were used to track events in the propylene plants. These resources are as follows:
(1)
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ): This commission is tasked with protecting the public health and natural resources of the state of Texas. By law, industrial plants are required to report any emissions events that occur in their premises through the State of Texas Environmental Electronic Reporting System (STEERS). These reports are available publicly in the Air Emission Event Report Database (Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, 2022), and can be searched by incident number, event start or end date ranges, entity name, county, and event type. For each event, a narrative description of the causes of the emissions event and corrective actions taken is included. This helped in isolating shutdown events from non-shutdowns and identifying the cause(s).
(2)
ICIS Global Plant Status Update: The Independent Commodity Intelligence Source (ICIS) is a market intelligence source which provides key news in the chemicals industry, commodity price assessments, supply/demand trends, and a review of plant construction and shutdowns (Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, 2022). In this work, we use the weekly Global Plant Status Update Worksheet, published in ICIS Chemical Business magazine between October 2018 and October 2020, to collect unplanned shutdown events for the selected process plants. This database includes the plant name, capacity, commodity, and whether the shutdown was scheduled or unscheduled. A narrative description of the event, including causes and subsequent maintenance actions taken, is available only to paid subscribers of the database.
(3)
OPIS Petrochem Wire News: This source provides information focused on the ethylene and propylene markets, including daily and calendar average prices and news on steam cracker outages, startups, and force majeure motions. The data extracted from this source were limited to the years 2020 and 2021 (Oil Price Information Service, 2022).
(4)
Reuters: Three Reuters news articles were found that provided reports of shutdowns at major refineries. These articles were mainly used to find the causes of the shutdown events from the ICIS Global Plant Status Update database.
3.3. Data Analysis of Multiple Repairable Systems
Since this work is concerned with shutdown events in large process plants, the reliability analysis methods for repairable systems are appropriate since these plants are repaired and operations are restarted afterwards. Repairable systems reliability uses different random (stochastic) point processes which are mathematical models describing the occurrence of failure or repair events in time (Modarres et al., 2017). These methods include homogeneous Poisson process (HPP), renewal process (RP), nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP), and the general renewal process (GRP). The occurrence in time is the failure, in this case a shutdown event, of a propylene production plant.
The objective in this work is to develop stochastic point process models for a set of propylene production plants that use two different technologies: steam cracking (SC), and propane dehydrogenation (PDH). While individual plants operating the same technology can have variations, it can be assumed that the plants operating that technology are similar enough to be considered identical systems. This assumption indicates that the failure patterns for those identical systems can be modeled by the same power law process. As a result, a power law process model for each technology will be obtained and the equality of parameters from those systems can tested.
The procedure to develop a power law process (PLP) for identical systems is described in detail by (Rigdon and Basu, 2000). In this work, the plants under each propylene production technology will be assumed as identical, and that the failure patterns are modeled by the same power law process, with parameters $\theta$ and $\beta$. This assumption can be tested as will be shown later in this section. A PLP is a special case of the nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP) with an intensity function in the form of:
(1)
The likelihood function for a PLP of k systems is represented as follows:
(2)
where
is the number of observed failures for system i, Ti is the total time of observation for system i, and tij denotes the time of the jth failure for system i. By taking the logarithm of the likelihood function, the log-likelihood function, l(θ, β) = log L(θ, β), is obtained. Differentiating the log-likelihood function with respect to θ and with respect to β gives expressions for both parameters of the power law process:
(3)
and
(4)
where N is the total number of observed failures N=n1+n2+ … +nk. The resulting equations can be solved explicitly for
and
unless all k systems are time truncated at the same operational time T. Under that condition, Equations (3) and (4) become:
(5)
and
(6)
A conditional likelihood function can be obtained by conditioning on the time of the nth failure (failure truncated case) or on the number of observed failures (time truncated case). Using the conditional likelihood, conditional maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) for
(
and
(
) can be determined as follows:
(7)
and
(8)
where
(9)
and
(10)
where M is the total number of observed failures N=m1+m2+ … +mk. In addition to the MLEs for both parameters, a
confidence interval for
can be determined as follows:
(11)
The assumption that the systems being examined are identical should be justified by testing the equality of the
parameter values. For this procedure, the null hypothesis is that the
parameters of the k systems are equal.
(12)
against the alternative that at least two of the $\beta$'s are different leads to the following likelihood ratio:

4. Propylene Production Analysis
4.1. Propylene Production Technologies Overview
Propylene is a major chemical building block that is used to produce a variety of chemicals vital to several economic sectors. The main derivatives are polypropylene plastics for injection molding and fibers, and propylene oxide, the major building block in polyurethane plastics production. Propylene oxide is also processed further to produce propylene glycol which is used for de-icing aircraft and runways at airports, where harsh winters result in increased demand. Other important downstream products in the propylene value chain are: acrylonitrile, phenol, oxo alcohols, and isopropyl alcohol (Al-Douri et al., 2017).
Until 2012, about 90% of propylene was produced as a byproduct of ethylene from steam cracking of naphtha and as a byproduct of gasoline from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) processes. In both cases, propylene is a secondary product, which causes its supply to be coupled to the ethylene and gasoline markets, instead of propylene demand. Recently, there has been a shift in steam cracker feed from naphtha to ethane due to the availability of shale gas which contains more natural gas liquids (NGLs) than conventional gas (Boswell, 2012). This shift has increased ethylene capacity and tightened propylene supplies, leading to the rise of on-purpose propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH), methanol-to-olefins (MTO), and olefin metathesis. With global propylene demand expected to increase from 133 million metric tons per annum (MMTPA) in 2020 to 199 million metric tons in 2030, on-purpose propylene production will be needed to satisfy rising demand. A recent study showed that propylene production from PDH plants increased from 2.1 MMTPA (3% of total) in 2005 to 13.6 MMTPA (12%) in 2019 with the construction of three plants in the United States and several more in China (Rabenhorst, 2019). Recent studies have implemented process integration and intensification techniques to improve the design of PDH plants and achieve reductions in carbon dioxide emissions (Agarwal et al., 2018). The two technologies examined in this article are steam cracking and propane dehydrogenation and Fig. 3 shows their block flow diagrams (BFDs).

4.2. Shutdown Event Data
In this study, shutdown events for a total of seven plants were tracked, three use propane dehydrogenation and four use steam cracking technology. The plant names were anonymized and hence are referred to by alphabetical letters. Using the sources described in Section 3, a database was constructed containing a total of 119 unplanned shutdown events across the time span of January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2021, of which 54 were for propane dehydrogenation plants and 65 were in steam cracking plants. This data was extracted from a larger set of approximately 750 entries covering emissions reports, unscheduled shutdown events, and scheduled shutdown events for the plants being tracked. For each event, relevant data included the start date and time, any attributed causes, process sections or equipment involved, and the end date and time. An annual breakdown of the number of events per plant is shown in Table 1. Overall, 2019 was the year with the most unplanned shutdown events and plant B had the most events relative to other plants. The average number of events per plant-year is very similar between the two technologies with a propane dehydrogenation plant experiencing 3.6 events/plant-year and a steam cracking plant experiencing 3.25 events/plant-year.

4.3. Shutdown Event Causes
The collected database was then analyzed to determine the causes attributed to these unplanned shutdown events. This was accomplished by examining the narrative descriptions of the event to extract a primary cause for the event from the contributing factors that were mentioned. This was complicated by the varying levels of details available depending on the reporting entity and source. For the 119 shutdown events in this database, a set of 8 primary cause categories were identified as follows: equipment leaks, equipment leaks and fire, equipment trips/shutdowns, utility supply interruptions (steam and electric power), weather-related, maintenance errors, process upsets, and unknown factors. Table 2 shows a detailed breakdown of the contributing factors for each plant and as a total for both production technologies. The first two categories included leakage of both process and utility mediums from equipment such as piping, centrifugal compressors, furnaces, and separation equipment. Notably, there were no equipment leaks and fires over the tracking period in propane dehydrogenation facilities. The most prevalent category was equipment trips/shutdowns, with the equipment being divided into four main classes: compressors/turbines, heat transfer equipment, separation equipment, and other equipment which included reactors, pumps, and process piping. Trips/shutdowns of compressors or turbines were the most frequently-occurring category for both technologies, indicating the importance of rotating machinery integrity and reliability avoiding costly shutdown events in propylene plants. Other significant shutdown events categories were utility supply interruptions and weather events. A percentage breakdown of the eight categories of primary causes of unplanned shutdown events is illustrated in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4. Causes of unplanned shutdown events in propylene production plants.
Previous works have identified sets of contributing factors in process safety incidents (Wang et al., 2021; Bhusari et al., 2021). Of the 18 contributing factors identified in the literature, eight were directly relevant to the causes identified from the shutdown event descriptions. However, it should be emphasized that each event can be attributed to multiple factors and a full investigation the causal chains of these events is out of the scope of this work. The following important factors are highlighted: (1) asset integrity and reliability, (2) safeguards, controls and layers of protection, and (3) extreme weather events.
Based on the previous analysis of primary causes, it can be seen that asset integrity and reliability was a contributing factor to 65% and 51% of shutdown events in PDH and steam cracking plants, respectively. This factor is of particular importance to the following primary cause categories: equipment leaks, equipment leaks with fires, and equipment trips/shutdowns. Thus, there is a critical need for quantitative data collection on the failure and maintenance aspects of the subsystems and components involved is critical to generating failure rates that aid in determining proper maintenance activities and schedules. Examples of this data includes failure times, failure modes, effects, and criticality, and repair duration. Analysis and processing of failure data can result in determining failure rates, and establishing relative weights, for specific failure modes and severity classes. These quantitative results will guide the design of process equipment integrity programs and allocation of inspection/testing and maintenance resources to help avoid costly shutdown events.
Safeguards, controls, and layers of protection was also identified as a contributing factor to 77% and 66% of shutdown events in PDH and steam cracking plants, respectively. This factor is of particular importance to the following primary cause categories: equipment leaks with fires, equipment trips/shutdowns, utility supply interruptions, and process upsets. This emphasizes the need for an understanding of the operation and failure probability/mechanism of the different barriers designed to address potential failures. These barriers include: process instrumentation, control systems, rupture discs, pressure relief valves, back-up power generators among others (Ogle and Morrison, 2011; Morrison et al., 2012).
A third factor that has become more important recently is extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, and winter storms or cold waves. Several studies that examined European industrial accident databases, such as ARIA and MARS, found about 2–5% of those accidents were triggered by natural hazards (Krausmann et al. 2011, 2019; Necci et al., 2013). According to the U.S. Office of Coastal Management, there were 20-billion-dollar weather events in the U.S. in the year 2021, compared to an average of 17.2 over the period of 2017–2021 (Office of Coastal Management, 2022). According to their estimates, these events have become more costly too, with the cost over the last five years being one-third of the total cost since 1980 ($742 billion compared to $2.155 trillion). An especially vulnerable area is the U.S. Gulf Coast where 47\% of the nation's refining capacity and 51\% of natural gas processing capacity is located. This study found that 11–17% of unplanned shutdown events in propylene production facilities were due to extreme weather events, specifically Hurricanes Harvey in 2017, Nicholas (2021), and Winter Storm Uri (2021). As these events become more frequent and costlier to the process industries, it will become increasingly necessary to address the resilience of chemical plants at the design stage because it is less costly to modify designs prior to construction and start-up than after commencement of operations. Reniers et al. (2018) identified four focus domains denoted by the acronym EPIC (Education, learning and training; Proactive risk minimization and safety innovation; Intensified informed inspection and analysis; and Cooperation and transparency) which can enhance industrial systems safety from natural events. A recent perspectives study by El-Halwagi et al. (2020) identified 12 principle strategies for developing disaster-resilient designs of manufacturing facilities and outlined six critical research needs and directions necessary to address this problem. One of the areas identified was resilience metrics for process facilities, and a recent work by Suarez-Paba and Cruz (2022) developed Natech-RateME, an area-wide risk management and rating system framework which evaluates industrial parks' performance in natural hazard-triggered technological accidents. Building on these perspectives for process plant resilience, the challenges and potential research thrusts for multi-scale supply chain resilience were identified in a study by Chrisandina et al. (2022). In addition to these studies, DeRosa et al. (2019) has examined disruptions to the ethylene supply chain in the United States as a result of Hurricane Harvey using a linear programming approach and estimated disruptions of $19.3 million tonnes of capacity disruptions.
5. Propylene Production Plant Availability Models
Using the equations described in Section 3.3, unique power law process models describing the failure behavior of both the propane dehydrogenation and steam cracking facilities can be generated. As indicated previously, failure in this work is defined as the occurrence of an unplanned shutdown event in the plant. The number of plants, number of failures for each system under both technologies was detailed in Section 4.2. This analysis is time-truncated as it uses the same observation time, five years or 43,800 h, for all systems involved. As a result, parameter maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) and conditional MLEs are equal. Using the parameter MLEs for both technologies, intensity functions and 95% confidence intervals for the
parameters are reported.
From the results shown in Table 3, it can be seen that both the propane dehydrogenation and steam cracking technologies have an increasing failure intensity function as the
parameter estimates are both greater than 1. However, propane dehydrogenation had a slightly higher
value, indicating that the intensity of unplanned shutdown events is increasing more rapidly with time over the observation period. This is clearly illustrated in the intensity function graph in Fig. 4 comparing both technologies. The PDH curve surpasses the steam cracking curve around 3300 h and the gap between them expands over remainder of the observation period.

The validity of the assumption that the plants tracked belonging to the same technology are identical systems should be tested using the procedure described in Equations (12), (13), (14), (15), (16)) in Section 3.3. The values obtained using the procedure are shown in Table 4. For each technology, the test statistic value (0.992 for PDH and 1.205 for steam cracking) was less than the Chi-squared distribution values, indicating that we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This allows us to conclude that the identical systems assumption holds and that there is no evidence that the $\beta$ values for the three PDH plants differ from each other. Likewise, the analyst can conclude that the four steam cracking plants are identical to each other. With different data sets, this assumption needs to always be tested to ensure the validity of the parameter estimation results.

6. Comparative Assessment of Economic Performance
In the previous sections, important insights into the primary causes and statistical modelling of shutdown events in propylene production via PDH and steam cracking technologies were presented. The data and models can be further harnessed to obtain two parameters useful in estimating process economic performance, mean time between failures (MTBF), and mean time to repair (MTTR). For the MTBF metric, the intensity functions shown in Section 5 are used to estimate a mean value and a 95% confidence interval. To do so, the intensity functions are evaluated at t = T, which in this case is 43,800 h. For the MTTR metric, an average of the shutdown durations reported for each plant can be used to calculate an overall average value, which can be further developed in future work. Using these two metrics, a maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and 95% confidence interval values can be determined for inherent availability, which provides a measure of the proportion of system unavailability that can be attributed to failures, as follows:

Using the inherent availability estimates, annual revenue losses, in millions of dollars per year, due to production interruptions can be determined as follows:
(18)
where Ai is the inherent availability determined in Equation (17), C is the annual plant production capacity in tonnes/year, and commodity price is in $/tonne.
A comparison is made here between two large-scale propylene production facilities: one operating the PDH technology, and another operating the steam cracking technology. Both plants are assumed to have the same annual production capacity of 750,000 tonnes/year. Commodity prices have varied over the years and are subject to market disruptions such as geopolitical events, pandemics, and extreme weather. For this comparison, the price of polymer grade propylene (PGP) used was the May 2022 futures prices given by CME group of $0.565/lb, which is $1265/tonne (CME Group, 2022). The MTBF, MTTR, and availability values determined from the intensity functions and data previously presented are shown in Table 5. The results indicate that the MLE MTBF value of a PDH plant is approximately 14% lower than its steam cracking counterpart, meaning that it is more likely to face unplanned shutdown events. As for the MTTR values determined, a PDH plant had an approximate outage duration 28% longer (256 h) compared to 185 h for a steam cracking plant. Using the inherent availability formula, these results combined to cause the MLE availability value of a PDH plant to be about 5% lower than a steam cracking plant (88.3% compared to 92.4%). Compared to Al-Douri et al. (2021) where generic reliability data from OREDA (SINTEF, 2015) was used, the MLE availability obtained in this work is 4.5% higher (88.3% compared to 84.5%). This comparison validates the approach adopted and emphasizes the enhancements in plant availability estimation that can be achieved with plant-specific reliability data. Also, these findings indicate that propane dehydrogenation facilities may be more prone to longer periods of downtime, and thus greater production interruptions, than steam cracking facilities.

For annual revenue calculations, a base case availability of 95\% was used to establish a benchmark with which to compare both types of production technologies, resulting in an annual revenue estimate of 901 \$MM/year. This value is often used as an estimate during the process design phase when comparing alternative technologies for a proposed chemical plant. Using the MLE availability and confidence interval values, availability-weighted annual revenues are estimated to be 794–872 $MM/year and 850–898 $MM/year for a PDH and steam cracking plants, respectively. Compared to the base case assumption, this result indicates that plant unavailability causes 72.5–146 $MM/year (PDH) and a 48–93.5 $MM/year (steam cracking) in annual revenue losses. This is in addition to repair costs, possible environmental cleanup fees, and reputation damage which may impact the operating entity later. These results are illustrated in Fig. 5, showing the annual revenue reductions as a percent of the base case value.

7. Conclusions and Recommendations
This paper introduced a method to study unplanned shutdown events and a preliminary database that is used to study the primary causes of these events and to model their inherent availability characteristics. The value of such a procedure is that it can be used to study the effects of plant unavailability and downtime on process economic performance indicators such as annual expected revenue and net profit. This is directly linked to the ability of the operating company to avoid costly repairs, meet its contractual obligations to customers, and stay competitive in a global market.
The database constructed in this work involved a total of seven propylene production facilities using two technologies: propane dehydrogenation and steam cracking. These plants, located on the Texas Gulf Coast, were tracked using government and industrial sources across five years from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2021. A total of 119 unplanned shutdown events were identified along with relevant information such as the start and end dates and narrative descriptions. After careful examination of these narratives, a representative set of eight primary causes for the unplanned shutdown events in propylene production facilities was developed. These causes were: equipment leaks, equipment leaks with fire, equipment trips/shutdowns, utility supply interruptions, weather events, maintenance errors, process upsets, and unknown causes. For both technologies, the main causes that emerged were equipment trips/shutdowns, utility supply interruptions, and weather events. However, several main differences were identified regarding the contribution of those causes to the shutdown events collected. First, equipment trips/shutdowns was a much larger contributor (59% of events) for propane dehydrogenation plants than for steam cracking (31%). This may be partly explained by that operational experience with PDH plants is more limited than steam cracking plants, and rigorous maintenance and inspection activities are less established in those facilities. Second, utility supply interruptions and weather events represented a greater share of the causes in steam cracking plants compared to their propane dehydrogenation counterparts. Third, equipment leaks and equipment leaks with fire were a more significant contributor for steam cracking plants (20%) compared to propane dehydrogenation (6%).
Several important insights and recommendations can be generated from the analysis of the causes of these unplanned shutdown events. These are summarized as follows:
(1)
The primacy of equipment trips/shutdowns as the leading cause of shutdowns in both technologies highlights the critical importance of asset integrity and reliability to the safe and continuous operation of process plants. A very important part of improving equipment reliability is quantitative data collection on the failure and maintenance aspects of process equipment which in turn enables plant engineers to calculate failure rates that can be used to determine proper scheduled maintenance and/or replacement intervals for critical equipment.
(2)
Utility supply interruptions, including both process steam and on-site and offsite electric power, highlight the importance of developing a safeguard strategy to mitigate potential consequences. This includes conducting a process hazard analysis (PHA) or QRA to identify and rank process units that pose the most serious threat for explosions, fires, or hazardous materials releases and determine a safe state for them. Layers of protection should be identified and their role in bringing the critical unit(s) to a safe state specified. Also, critical equipment, such as emergency pumps and alarms, that may be needed to ensure the safe state of process units should be installed.
(3)
The frequency of disruptive weather events, such as lightning, hurricanes, and freezing weather, sheds light on the growing importance of resilience in the process industries. Mitigation measures for this include establishment of emergency response plans that cover required actions before, during, and after the occurrence of these events. Also, as the frequency and damage from these events increases, integrating resiliency considerations in the design of process plants is the most cost-optimal path to mitigating the consequences of extreme weather events.
Using an established procedure, the failure behavior of propane dehydrogenation and steam cracking plants was modeled with a power law process (PLP). Since the observation period was the same for all the plants involved, all systems were time-truncated at the same time which enabled the model parameters to be estimated analytically. The PDH technology had a higher $\beta$ parameter value, indicating that the intensity of unplanned shutdown events increased more rapidly over the observation period. The assumption that each set of plants representing both technologies were identical systems and thus could be represented by one PLP model for the technology type was tested and found to be correct. Using MTBF values generated from the PLP models and MTTR data from the constructed database, steam cracking plants were found to have an inherent availability of approximately 5% higher than PDH plants. This higher availability is reflected in higher expected annual revenues for steam cracking facilities. An illustrative example of a large-scale plant for each technology showed that the lower availability of PDH plants can reduce annual revenues by 8–16.2% compared to 5–10.4% for steam cracking plants. Due to the significant contribution of equipment trips/shutdowns, addressing equipment reliability in propane dehydrogenation plants through higher quality equipment and proper inspection and maintenance will be a key factor in avoiding unplanned shutdown events and ultimately improving annual revenues and profits. This will help improve the safety of this technology, expand its adoption as it is needed to satisfy the world's growing demand for plastics, and achieve enhanced economic returns for industrial operators.
