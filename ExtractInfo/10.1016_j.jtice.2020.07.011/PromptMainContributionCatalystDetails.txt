•
Glycerol hydrogenolysis by copper supported dolomite was explored.

Abstract
A series of Cu/dolomite catalysts were synthesized using the impregnation technique, characterized using NH3–TPD, FTIR-Pyridine, XRD, H2-TPR, BET, BJH, FESEM-EDX, and XPS techniques and evaluated in glycerol hydrogenolysis into 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO). Remarkably, dolomite support exhibited high acidity, which is, to our knowledge the first acid characteristic revealed among the reported literatures. By doping copper on dolomite support, the acid amount and strength of the catalyst increased. N2O chemisorption analysis suggests that the metallic copper species were well dispersed on dolomite support while the copper surface area increased with copper loading. The formation of metallic copper on dolomite support agreed well with findings derived from XRD and XPS analysis. According to the results of XPS and H2-TPR, metallic copper species were enriched on the grain surfaces of dolomite and not in the bulk. The addition of copper to dolomite ameliorates the redox properties of the catalysts, owing to the reduction at a lower temperature than that of pure CuO and dolomite support. From the catalytic results, 20 wt% Cu/dolomite was the most active catalyst by giving 100% glycerol conversion and 92% selectivity toward 1,2-PDO at 180 ºC, 2 MPa H2 in 6 h reaction time.
1. Introduction
The evolution of alternative fuels from plant-derived oils in particular sunflower, palm oil, rapeseed, algal oil, and their derivatives have boosted the expeditious production of biodiesel as a substitute for fossil fuel. However, the expeditious development of biodiesel production in the past decade has made large quantities of glycerol available as a by-product (1 kg glycerol/9 kg biodiesel) [1]. Due to the future consequences of oversupply of glycerol, effort is on the increase to transform it to high-value chemical products, including 1,2-propanediol, glycerol carbonate, glyceric acid, glycerol esters, glycerol ethers and acrolein/acrylic acid which can be obtained through various chemical route of selective oxidation, dehydration, hydrogenolysis, etherification, esterification, and ammoxidation.
Above all, the innovative route to 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PDO) production, also called propylene glycol (PG), is of research interest due to its high demand. The 1,2-PDO is an important commodity chemical used as a coolant, airplane de-icing agent, in the production of pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, solvent in food, and raw material for polyester resins [[2], [3], [4]]. The 1,2-PDO is globally produced at about 1.4 million tons yearly with 4% of annual growth rate [5]. The current process of 1,2-PDO production is derived from petroleum through hydration of hazardous propylene oxide either by chlorohydrin or hydroperoxide process [6], [7], [8], [9]. However, the petroleum resources are predicted to last about 40 years [10], therefore the depleting of petroleum resources in addition to environmental contamination is of serious concern in the production of 1,2-PDO from petroleum. Correspondingly, it is timely and desirable for the current production process to switch from petroleum-based to renewable sources. The production of 1,2-PDO via the catalytic hydrogenolysis of glycerol can be an ideal solution to its abundance with higher sustainability than the petroleum-based sources [11]. Hydrogenolysis is a process of reduction reaction that involved simultaneous chemical bond dissociation of an organic molecule and the insertion of hydrogen into generated fragments [11]. During the glycerol hydrogenolysis to 1,2-PDO, the cleavage of CO bond and simultaneous H2 addition occurs without attacking CC bond of glycerol molecules [12].
Many heterogeneous catalysts, via their mechanisms, have been reported in literatures to play an active role in glycerol hydrogenolysis, yielding different product compositions. Alkaline metal such as magnesium and calcium has been defined as a powerful reducing agent in electrochemical series. They interact with almost any form of metal oxide (e.g., copper, boron, chromium, rare earth, and uranium dioxide) at high temperatures to form the corresponding metal very fast [13]. The combination of the materials in a catalyst system is therefore greatly enhanced the redox properties of the metal-based oxide. The utilization of noble metal-based catalysts such as Pd [3], Pt [4], Rh [7], Ru [8], Ir [9], and Os [14] have been reported with high selectivity to 1,2-PDO and high conversion of glycerol. The excellent performance of these metals has been attributed to their high dispersion ability and the ease of reduction at a much lower temperature. On the other hand, the utilization of the non-noble metal-based catalysts, for instance, Fe, Cu, Co, Ni, and Cr as an alternative to the expensive noble metal, has also been reported with high catalytic activity. Among the transition metals tested, Cu-based catalysts are preferred in view of their high efficiency towards CO bond cleavage in contrast to CC bond cleavage [[15], [16], [17], [18]]. The lower price of copper in comparison to noble metals can be an added advantage in their utilization in glycerol hydrogenolysis.
Even so, there are concerns about the use of copper metal as catalysts in glycerol hydrogenolysis. The extensive and rapid deactivation due to fast leaching, serious sintering, and catalyst coking has been reported [12]. Thus, to ameliorate these challenges is to employ the use of support materials to allocate sufficient surface area for the deposition of the active phase and obstruct its sintering thereby significantly raise the activity and stability of the catalyst [8]. Similarly, the presence of support could behave like a reservoir of spillover hydrogen that helps to hydrogenate surface species in which the hydrogen from the support can pass towards copper particles and generate additional interfacial active sites of metal-support which promote higher activity.
In view of the fact that the copper metal active sites have been identified to work for the activation of the glycerol molecule enabling H2 dissociation, chemisorption and subsequent hydrogenation due to its low reduction temperature (close to the reaction temperature of glycerol hydrogenolysis, 180–250 ºC) [19], mobilizing it on good support will no doubt improve its efficiency in glycerol hydrogenolysis. In this study, dolomite with a mixture of mainly calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and magnesium carbonate (MgCO3) (calcium magnesium carbonate CaMg(CO3)2) [20,21] with several appreciable amounts of SiO2, Fe2O3, Al2O3 at (<5%) is used as support for copper catalyst. This support material has gained wide attention in various other reactions due to its low-priced, environmental friendliness [22] and most importantly, its acidic characteristics but has not been deploy in glycerol hydrogenolysis. The presence of both metals in dolomite, as good reducing agents, may react with copper to form reduced metal which could enhance higher hydrogenolysis of glycerol into 1,2-PDO. Incidentally, dolomite is abundantly available in Perlis, northern part of Malaysia and therefore, can easily be accessible.
Based on previous reaction mechanisms proposed by literatures, the evolution of 1,2-PDO from glycerol hydrogenolysis reaction was described to proceed by dehydration reaction of glycerol to form acetol on the acid catalyst and consecutive acetol hydrogenation to 1,2-PDO (on metal site) [23] [24,25] (Scheme 1). Therefore, the enhancement in acidity properties between copper-based catalyst and support material are the key factors for high reaction performance in the hydrogenolysis reaction. Thus, a bifunctional catalyst comprising of acid and metal sites was deployed in the reaction. To this end and for the first time, dolomite which is abundantly available in Perlis, the northern part of Malaysia, is been employed as a novel support for copper-based catalysts in glycerol hydrogenolysis reaction.

The focus of this work is to attain deeper knowledge into the causes of selectivity and activity trends in the glycerol hydrogenolysis to 1,2-PDO. Usually, the metallic copper surface area has been deployed as a descriptor of catalytic activity. We presume that for a deeper understanding of the reaction, copper particle sizes would be preferable descriptors since these are correlated to the morphology of copper and the active sites. Thus, this research is focused on the study of the dependency of the performance reaction with the size of copper particles. In the present work, a series of copper doped dolomite catalysts are prepared by wet impregnation method. This preparation technique was chosen because it has been proposed that Cu particle size can be easily controlled which is more complicated in the case of a co-precipitation route [19]. The physicochemical properties of the synthesized catalysts are determined using several analytical techniques and thus tested for the glycerol hydrogenolysis reaction. The optimization of the catalytic reaction study on the effect of copper loading, reaction temperature, reaction time, and reaction pressure was studied in detail. The reaction on catalyst stability and regeneration is further discussed in this present study. Significant emphasis has been paid to correlate the catalytic activity results with the characterization result.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
Mineral dolomite used as support in this experimental work was supplied by quarries in Chuping, Malaysia Perlis Dolomite Industries. Copper nitrate hexahydrate (Cu(NO3)2·6H2O) (≥ 99%) was obtained from R&M Chemical Company. Glycerol (≥ 99.5%) as reaction feedstock was acquired from Sigma-Aldrich. All the chemicals were free of any modification and used directly.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
The metal oxide catalysts supported on dolomite were synthesized by the impregnation method. In a typical synthesis, 1.9 g, 3.8 g and 5.7 g of copper nitrate hexahydrate precursor was separately liquefied in 10 ml distilled water and each was poured into 4.5 g, 4 g, and 3.5 g dolomite powder respectively to form 10 wt%, 20 wt% and 30 wt% copper load and denoted as x%/Dol (x = Cu wt%). The mixture was then stirred at 300–400 rpm and left to dry for 3 h with heating at 90°C. The resultant mixture was further aged in the oven for 24 h at 120°C. The synthesized catalyst was then calcined at 500°C for 3 h with ramping of 10 ºC/min in static air. The calcined catalysts were then reduced at 600 ºC for 3 h at a heating rate of 2 ºC/min in 5% H2/Ar.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
The catalyst acidic strength was studied by temperature programmed desorption using ammonia as probe gas (NH3-TPD). The catalyst sample was treated in the flow of ammonia at room temperature for 1 h. The desorption of ammonia from the treated sample was detected using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) in helium gas flow (30 cm3/min) from 50 ºC to 950 ºC. The acid amount of the catalyst was induced using the peak area of NH3 desorption. The FTIR spectra of adsorbed pyridine were recorded to ascertain the relative Bronsted and/or Lewis acidity of the catalyst. Initially, the samples were first purged in a helium flow at 150 ºC for 0.5 h. Subsequently, the samples were treated with just about 2 mbar of pyridine and then degassed at 150 ºC, 250 ºC, and 350 ºC to remove the physisorbed pyridine. The reduction characteristic of the catalysts was examined using temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR). Typically, the sample with approximately 0.05 g was pre-treated using N2 gas at a rate of 20 cm3/min for 0.5 h at 120 ºC in order to take off the moisture in the sample. After the pretreatment process, the H2 chemisorption analysis was performed from 50 ºC to 950 ºC at a rate of 10 ºC/min under 5% H2. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed in order to reveal the catalyst phase structure and crystallite size using the XRD-6000 Shimadzu diffractometer model with CuKα (λ = 0.15406 nm) at an angle of 2θ = 10–80º. The crystallite size calculation (nm) of catalyst particle was calculated using Debye-Scherrer equation corresponding to the full width of half maximum (FWHM) of the respective peak.
N2O chemisorption analysis was conducted in order to obtain a specific value of surface metallic copper which are copper dispersion, particle diameter, and surface area which cannot be determined using XRD and N2-physisorption. XRD can measure the size of particle in bulk catalyst not on the catalyst surface while the BET surface area was calculated for a whole surface area of catalyst not surface area of a specific metal. Accordingly, the N2O analysis was performed using the procedure described by Van Der Grift et al. [77]. Catalysts were firstly reduced in the procedure described in the above TPR experiment in 10% H2/N2 mixture (30 mL/min) until 350 ºC using Thermo-Finnigan TPD/R/O 1100 SERIES. The amount of hydrogen consumption in the first TPR was denoted as X. And then, the treated sample was flushed with He flow and cooled to 50 ºC to remove excess H2/N2 in the catalyst bed. After that, the treated sample was purged with 20% N2O/N2 (30 mL/min) to oxidize surface copper atoms to Cu2O at 50°C for 0.5 h. Finally, the treated sample was flushed with He again to remove the oxidant (excess N2O) and cooled to 50 ºC. Finally, another reduction experiment (TPR run) was performed in 10% H2/N2 at a flow rate of 30 mL/min. Hydrogen consumption in the second TPR run was denoted as Y. The dispersion of surface Cu and the exposed Cu surface area was calculated according to the following equation:
Reduction of all copper atoms in the first TPR:
CuO + H2→ Cu + H2O, hydrogen consumption =X.
Reduction of surface copper atoms that were oxidized to Cu2O by N2O:
Cu2O+H2 → 2Cu + H2O, hydrogen consumption in second TPR = Y.
And the dispersion of the surface Cu and exposed Cu surface area were calculated as:
where Nav = Avogadro's constant, MCu = relative atomic mass of copper (63.456 g/mol), 1.4 × 1019 comes from that an equal abundance of an average copper surface atom area of 0.0711 nm2 (equivalent to 1.4 × 1019 copper atoms per square meter).
For XPS analysis, it was conducted using Kratos instrument XSAM HS surface analysis spectrometer with MgKα as a source of X-ray. The scale of carbon binding energy (C 1 s peak) was corrected for the charging effect due to the surface contamination obtained from the subjected sample. The deconvolution results for all elements were conducted using CASA software. The catalyst surface area was calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method with N2 adsorption/desorption analyzer using the Gemini apparatus (Micromeritics 2010 Instrument Corporation). Prior to analysis, the catalyst was degassed at 150 ºC for 24 h to take off all the moisture and foreign gases on catalyst surfaces. Next, the adsorption and desorption processes of N2 of the catalyst surfaces were analyzed in a vacuum chamber at −196 ºC. The morphological features of the catalysts were acquired using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM using Rayny EDX-720). The FESEM images were spotted through LEO 1455 VP electron microscope in a high-vacuum condition at 20 kV. Finally, the measurement of coke deposition on the spent catalysts was perceived using thermogravimetric TGA equipment (Mettler Toledo) by measuring the weight change in the catalyst sample up to 1000 ºC analysis temperature in 20% O2/N2 mixture flow.
2.4. Activity test
The reaction of glycerol hydrogenolysis was conducted in a custom-designed autoclave reactor. The autoclave was filled with reactant solution containing 20wt% of aqueous glycerol solution and 1 g synthesized catalyst. The reactor was pressurized with H2 and preheated to the required temperature (ACL01-150). For preliminary reaction, the reactor was set at maximum pressure, temperature, and time of 4 MPa H2, 200°C, and 10 h, respectively. For all the reactions, the reactor was left stirred at 400 rpm. The reaction starting time was established once the temperature reached the desired reaction temperature of all experiments. Once the reaction is completed, the reaction liquid was left cooled to room temperature and was then being separated from the catalyst mixture by centrifugation process at 3000 rpm for about 15 min. A blank reaction was also performed at similar reaction parameters. The experimental set up for glycerol hydrogenolysis reaction is shown by the schematic diagram in Fig. 1.

2.5. Product analysis
The liquid product was analyzed using gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) provided with HP-5 capillary column (length: 30 m ✗ inner diameter: 0.32 mm ✗ film thickness: 0.25 µm) operating at 300 ºC with splitless inlet mode. Prior to analysis, the liquid product collected from the autoclave reactor was separated via centrifugation. The resultant liquid product was then extracted using ethyl acetate in a 1:1 ratio. The extraction was carried out three times. Next, the product solution was dried in the oven at 70–80 ºC for 15 min in order to concentrate the solution. Lastly, the derivatization process was used to prepare the sample for GC analysis. Typically, NO-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluroacetamide (BSTFA) as the silyl agent was mixed with pyridine (C5H5N) is a binding solvent in ratio 1:1 and left dried in the oven at 60–70 ºC for 20 mins to allow for complete bonding of the silylation process. 1 µL amount of the dried product was directly injected to GC. The temperature for injection was set at 250 ºC. The GC oven initial temperature was determined at 40 ºC and held for 6 min with the rate of heating at 7 ºC/min to reach up to 270 ºC. The glycerol conversion and selectivity of the products were acquired by comparing the retention time of standard with the obtained experimental-based products on GC chromatogram peak. The conversion of glycerol and product selectivity of 1,2-PDO was calculated using Eq. (1.1) and Eq. (1.2), respectively.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) analysis
In catalysis field, it is inevitably necessary to determine the actual active sites because the catalytic activity is partly guided by the accessibility of the reagents to those sites and is a crucial property in the hydrogenolysis reaction [23, 26–28]. The results of NH3-TPD are shown in Fig. 2 and the amount of ammonia uptakes are given in Table 1. As stated by the literature [29], the behavior of the ammonia desorbed at low temperatures could be assigned to the adsorbed NH3 by physically, whereas that desorbed NH3 at higher temperatures was referred to the chemisorbed NH3. Generally, the acidic strength can be categorized into three types of ammonia desorption temperature. The weak acid site appears at temperature <250°C, medium acid site appears in the range of 250–500°C and the strong acid site appears above 500°C [30,31].

NH3 desorption peak for all catalysts.
Results in Fig. 2 indicate that all the synthesized catalysts exhibited strong acid sites at different thermal stability of NH3 adsorbed species. The content of carbonate species in dolomite is believed to be responsible for its acidic property. And this statement could be correlated by Silvester's research that highlighted the acid sites of apatite sample (Hap) after the addition of CaCO3 species, of which it possessed a relatively high strength of acid due to the carbonate-rich species [32]. Dolomite shows two desorption peaks at 805 ºC and 874 ºC. After adding Cu to dolomite, the desorption temperature shifts to low temperature from 805°C (dolomite) to ∼740°C (Cu/Dol) and the second peak shifts to high temperature from 874°C (dolomite) to ∼960°C (Cu/Dol) at the same time the total ammonia amount of the Cu/Dol increased. These desorption peaks of Cu/Dol coincide very well with the desorption profile of copper. Thus, it indicates the strong influence of copper on the surface acidic strength and a sign that copper is well dispersed over the dolomite surface. However, the copper additives induce the amount of ammonia desorption peak to decrease in 10%Cu/Dol sample which suggests that Cu additives decreased the acid value amount (Table 1). This could be attributed to the low CuO particles which do not show acidic properties. It is due to the presence of acid sites by Cu2+ ions on the support pores that obstructed ammonia from accessible to the acid sites of the doped catalyst. As also indicated by literature, the lower acidity of doped catalysts at low copper loading was due to the coverage of support surface by copper species [18].
Interestingly, when the amount of copper additives was increased (20%Cu/Dol and 30%Cu/Dol), the acid amount increased, however, an additional broader desorption peak at higher temperature was generated. Similar behavior was observed by the addition of nickel species on Mn/TiO2 catalyst as reported by Thirupathi et al. [33]. The authors indicated improved and broadened acid site distribution. Based on this study, it is suggested that the impregnation of Cu ions tie-up the acid protons in dolomite thus providing more sites for species molecules to be bonded with NH3 gas [24,26].
Table 1 lists the acid amounts of all samples and is in the order 30%Cu/Dol > 20%Cu/Dol > 10%Cu/Dol > dolomite > copper. The observed trend of acid sites amount was correlated with the content of Cu particles in the supported catalysts which is also consistent with XRD patterns for the calcined sample shown in Fig. 4(A). As can be seen, the intensity of CuO peaks observed at 2θ = 35.65º and 38.89º became higher with the increase of copper content in the supported catalyst. Lin et al. [44] and Dou et al. [45] have recently proposed that the acid site of catalyst is accountable for the alkoxide adsorption while the metallic Cu sites associated with the presence of Cu clusters is for the hydride attack. And so the increased acidity with increased Cu content improved catalytic reaction to a higher level as shown in the reaction results (Table 5). From the foregoing, this study shows that dolomite has high acid character. This character has never been reported and could be one of the factors contributing to high glycerol hydrogenolysis.
It was established in literature that the peak area of pyridine coordinated to Lewis acid sites is increased with the addition of metal oxide into support catalyst [33]. However, to further ascertain the above assertion, IR-pyridine was conducted in order to distinguish the acid sites (see Fig. 3).

3.2. FTIR-pyridine
It was stated that the Lewis acid site played the main role in the dehydration mechanism rather than the Bronsted acid site [28,29]. To obtain more detailed information about the nature of acid sites present from the interaction of pyridine molecules with the surface of dolomite and 20%Cu/Dol sample, the infrared spectra of adsorbed pyridine was monitored at different desorption temperatures (150 ºC, 250 ºC, and 350 ºC) and the result is shown in Fig. 3. According to the reported literatures, Lewis acid sites acquire a pair of electrons from the metal atom to assume a coordinated structure while a Bronsted acid site acquires the presence of H-sites corresponding to proton from metal [25,[35], [36], [37], [38]]. Meanwhile, it was established that the integrated peak intensities at 1450 cm−1 correspond to the coordinated pyridine adsorbed on the Lewis acid site, while the peak at 1540 cm−1 is attributed to pyridine ion formed by interaction with Bronsted acid sites [28,29].
As displayed in Fig. 3, the presence of a peak around 1445–1470 cm−1 corresponding to Lewis acid sites was observed for dolomite samples at different desorption temperatures. However, as copper was added to dolomite, both Lewis and Bronsted acid sites are observed at around 1445–1470 cm−1 and 1515–1540 cm−1, respectively which indicated the effect of copper-dolomite interaction on the catalyst acid sites. It was proposed that the Bronsted acid site is derived from copper sites. Interestingly, the peak of the Lewis acid site in Fig. 3(b) is more profound as the sample was evacuated from 150 ºC to 350 ºC, while the peak corresponding to the Bronsted acid site slowly decreased. The changes could be correlated to the increase in pyridine surface coverage (due to the high electron energy of pyridinium ions). At high adsorption temperature, the partial cleavage of the pyridine rings was induced thus easier to be assumed a coordinated structure. The highlighted peaks are identical to the ones reported in literature [28,29]. The evolution of the two acid sites is agreeing with the findings observed for the zeolite material reported by Wang et al. [39].
This study indicates that the presence of Bronsted acid sites in Cu/Dol is relatively weak compared to the Lewis acid site, indicating the successful electron coordination by Cu ions in the dolomite sample. The presence of significant Lewis acid site is also in line with findings reported by Heracleous et al. [40], the authors indicate that the Lewis acid of copper was attributed to the formation of coordinative sites from the Cu ions. In addition, the results of glycerol hydrogenolysis over Cu/Dol catalyst conducted at 200 ºC as shown in Table 5 increased when compared to pure dolomite. This finding coincides with the increase in the number of Lewis acid sites due to the inclusion of Cu. This highly recommends that the Lewis acid sites play a vital role in glycerol hydrogenolysis reaction at the temperature range of 150–200 ºC. In consideration of the foregoing, the Bronsted acid sites may not be directly involved in the glycerol hydrogenolysis reaction.
The catalytic activity results are in good agreement with the results achieved from acidity measurements via IR pyridine method. From Table 5, it was established that the conversion of glycerol increased from 10.6 to 78.54% for dolomite and copper doped dolomite, respectively.
3.3. XRD analysis
The existence of metallic copper (Cu0) on the catalysts surface before reduction (calcined) and after reduction, can be gathered from the XRD as shown in Fig. 4(A) and (B), respectively. With regard to dolomite support, mixed crystalline phases were observed. Peaks at 2θ =18.01º, 28.36º, and 33.10º are assigned to CaMg2 (JCPDS; 01–1070). While the peaks at 2θ = 29.33º and 71.75º are attributed to CaCO3 (JCPDS; 01-1032). The peaks at 2θ = 37.51º, 50.76º, and 62.20º are due to dolomite (JCPDS; 02-0767). The two peaks at 2θ = 44.20º and 47.44º are referred to MgCO3 phase ((JCPDS; 02-0871). The peak for CaO is observed at 2θ = 54.35º and 64.21º (JCPDS; 01-1160) while the less intense peak for MgAl2O4 phase is detected at 2θ = 78.78º (JCPDS; 03-1160).

Fig. 4. XRD diffractograms of a calcined (A) and reduced samples (B) for (a) Dolomite, (b) 10%Cu/Dol, (c) 20%Cu/Dol and (d) 30%Cu/Dol.
XRD patterns in Fig. 4(A) displayed that both CuO and Cu2MgO3 phases were indicated in the calcined catalysts when copper was added to dolomite support with the diffraction peak at 2θ = (35.65º and 38.89º) and 48º, respectively. The intensity of CuO peak became higher with the increase in copper content from 10 wt% to 30 wt%, indicating the transformation of CuO clusters from small particles to bigger ones that dispersed over dolomite surface. According to Putrakumar et al. [18], the formation of bulk crystalline CuO phase was due to the agglomeration of Cu species in the catalyst. Nonetheless, the samples containing lower amounts of copper present only low intense diffraction peaks attributed to CuO. For this catalyst, copper appears to be well dispersed on the surface of dolomite forming small size of particles.
Meanwhile, it has been revealed that metal oxide catalyst is prone to generate spinel oxide when it was supported with clay or limestone material containing Mg [41]. Tanasoi et al. [42] indicate that the calcined catalyst of Cu formed mixed oxide phase with Mg–Al by periclase-like structure as such Chmielarz et al. [43] reported that copper species can be reduced at a temperature greater than 300 ºC due to stable Cu species in the catalyst structure hence in this study, copper supported on dolomite catalysts were preliminarily reduced at 600 ºC. Diversely, the XRD pattern of the reduced catalysts shown in Fig. 4(B) indicates that the diffraction peak of metallic copper (Cu0) emerges. Apparently, no characteristic peak of any CuO and Cu2O phase is observed instead that of Cu2MgO3 crystals phase was seen at broad peak 2θ = 35.25º, 37.53º, 38.19º and 48º (JCPDS; 21–0291), thereby confirming the formation of Cu particles in spinel.
The formation of metallic copper is as a result of the segregated form of Cu cluster (metallic crystallites) on the catalyst surface as also indicated by Lin et al. [44]. The intensity of metallic copper was found to be more visible with an increment of copper loading with sharp diffraction peaks observed at 2θ = 43.81º (111), 50.84º (200), and 74.76º (220) (JCPDS; 85-1326) due to the larger size of metallic crystallites. Duo et al. [45] also observed the formation of oxide cluster of CuCe4-Zeolite catalyst due to the extra-framework of cerium which was prone to agglomerate into cerium oxides clusters as cerium content was increased. The presence of Cu0 in the reduced sample is in agreement with XPS results shown in Fig. 8. The findings in this study show that metallic copper was successfully formed upon reduction at 600 ºC.
According to Zhao et al. [46], the size, dispersion value, and copper surface area are key factors in determining the catalytic activity of copper-based catalysts. Thus, in this study, the crystallite size of metallic copper was calculated using Debye–Scherrer equation corresponding to the full width of half maximum (FWHM) of the respective peak while the copper dispersion, average copper particle diameter and surface area of metallic copper were determined by dissociative N2O chemisorption and the results are summarized in Table 2. The results show that with increased copper content from 10 wt% to 20 wt% and 30 wt%, the crystallite size of copper shows a continuous increase from 19.49 to 31.06 and 84.91 nm, which is in line with the trend of Cu particle diameter from 2.09 to 4.45 and 4.90 nm, respectively. Consequently, the copper surface area also increased in the same order of 24.1, 37.6, and 58.6 m2/g. This shows that the copper metal may exist in the form of bigger Cu clusters which are dispersed on the surface of dolomite. The above findings suggest that the coverage of dolomite surface by Cu is proportional to the amount of copper loading.

The data were estimated according to the Scherrer equation using the FWHM of the Cu peak (220) at 2θ = 74.09. bThe data were calculated by N2O adsorption analysis.
Although the Cu dispersion of catalysts declined from 30.88 to 21.42 and 19.47% with increased copper loading nevertheless, it was not attributed to an incomplete reduction of the copper surface. In fact, the XRD results displayed that bulk metallic copper is formed on these catalysts after reduction treatment (Fig. 4(B)). Thus, it can be said that if the bulk of copper particles can be successfully reduced, then the surface should be so. Consequently, it could be suggested that the low dispersion obtained by N2O chemisorption is due to the formation of very large Cu particles and not due to an incomplete reduction of copper since no characteristic peak of CuO and Cu2O phase is detected [19]. Whereas, the morphology of Cu/Dol catalyst determined by FESEM (Fig. 7) shows agglomeration behavior by increasing copper loading, which is accordant with the increased value of Cu particle size and decrease in copper dispersion obtained in this study while the data obtained by H2-TPR profile shown in Fig. 5 could interpret the reducibility characteristic of the calcined samples.

Notably, the particle size of the catalysts may affect directly the absorption and desorption of hydrogenation (H2 splitting). Soares et al. [16], indicates that the lower amount of surface metal is given by bigger catalyst particles due to the low H2 consumption, therefore reduced the Cu dispersion. On the contrary, the glycerol hydrogenolysis performance (Table 5) in this study was enhanced with the increase of copper particle size. As indicated in Table 3, the increase of copper loading shows an increase in total hydrogen consumption. According to Karolevic and Ruiz [19], it was indicated that the performance hydrogenation of CO2 for methanol was independent by copper particle size since higher product selectivity to methanol was particular over catalysts possessing larger copper clusters nanoparticles compared to catalysts with lower copper loading. Accordingly, it was proposed that the catalyst with large copper particles due to strong sintering of copper nanoparticles form new active sites that ultimately led to the raise of methanol selectivity. Thus it was proposed that the sintering of Cu particles alter the structure of copper thus stimulate the hydrogenation rate in methanol synthesis which agrees well with the findings in this study since the performance of glycerol hydrogenolysis also increased with higher copper loading (Table 2). Similar finding was also reported by Tsai et al. [47].

3.4. H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR)
H2-TPR is frequently deployed to study the reducibility and the mobility of lattice oxygen species in the metal oxide material. The H2-TPR profile of dolomite, CuO, and Cu/Dol samples is depicted in Fig. 5 and the corresponding hydrogen consumption data is given in Table 3. As presented in Fig. 5, copper doped dolomite catalyst showed a lower reduction temperature with respect to pure CuO species that reduces at 338 ºC with a shoulder at 428 ºC. All the Cu/Dol catalysts exhibit roughly and almost symmetrical reduction peaks centered at around ∼290, ∼470, and ∼630 ºC.
According to Zhao et al. [48], the reduction of dispersed copper oxide species to Cu0 was effective at <300 ºC. At higher temperature, reduction of copper in the spinel phase or the formation of metal-support compound interaction takes place. In a similar study by Vargas-Hernandez et al. [49], it was reported that the reduction of Cu species which strongly interacted with support requires a temperature above 400 ºC. Besides, Li et al. [50] indicate a shift of TPR peak to a higher temperature for the Cu–Mg–Al sample which was calcined at 800 or 900 ºC, probably attributed to the very slow diffusion of hydrogen in a strongly sintered sample. Therefore, in this study, the first two reduction profiles of Cu/Dol are assigned to the reduction of dispersed CuO species to metallic Cu which provides the central active sites for hydrogenolysis of glycerol. The first peak at about ∼290 ºC corresponds to reduction peak of small and big clusters of CuO to metallic copper (Cu0) while the second TPR peak is attributed to the reduction of copper oxide in interstitial or substitutional defects in dolomite crystalline phase since Cu2MgO3 phase is previously detected by XRD peak in Fig. 4. And the peak maximum at ∼630 ºC is ascribed to the reduction of the dolomite support since the signal is close to that of bulk dolomite (639 ºC).
The TPR profile shows that the catalyst reduction peak of Cu/Dol is shifted towards lower reduction temperature than pure CuO. The shift in the reduction temperature of the supported copper species is possibly attributed to the synergistic effect interaction between CuO and dolomite support. In other words, dolomite could enhance the reducibility of copper via their mutual interaction. Similar findings were reported by Galvagno et al. [51], where, the addition of Cu to Ru/Al2O3 create another TPR peak which lowered the reduction temperature peak of the catalyst which was attributed to the interaction of the support and the copper. Based on literature, it was reported that in a reducing atmosphere, CuO favors to produce a defect of Cu+ ions and oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surface. By contributing electron to the support ions, the unstable surface of Cu+ ions is being converted to metallic Cu0 [52].
Notably, the peaks of Cu/Dol (∼290 and ∼470 ºC) emerge broader and higher with a continuous increase in the copper content. It indicates more amount of copper oxide species would undergo reduction due to the high composition of copper oxide in the catalyst. Moreover, the broader and higher peak intensity of TPR could also be due to the cluster formation of the catalyst and a higher amount of spinel phase [50]. Similar behavior was outlined by Soares et al. [16], the authors indicate the broader range for reduction after addition of Cu on Ru–Cu/ZrO2 is related to the cluster formation of Ru and Cu mixtures, instead, its homogeneous alloys thus cause interphase hydrogen adsorption of metals. Besides, Tanasoi et al. [42] assigned the broad TPR profiles of Cu-containing mixed oxides in the high-temperature region at 400–750 ºC was ascribed to copper involved in aluminate spinel phases (CuAl2O4) and probably also due to more complex CuxMgxAl2O4 phases. Chmielarz et al. [43] found that the higher reduction of copper species above 600 ºC was probably accredited to the reduction of surface CuAl2O4 (Cu2+) to CuAlO2 (Cu+) when Cu was introduced into hydrotalcite matrix. It was also found that the reduction peaks of copper oxide (at about ∼290 and ∼470 ºC) were shifted towards slightly higher temperature with increasing copper loading. This confirms that copper ions are incorporated in the dolomite support lattice, which generates lattice defects in the doped catalyst and created an increase in oxygen mobility in the lattice. In this way, the formation of metallic copper is altered by the oxygen vacancy defects in the copper oxide.
The relative H2 consumptions of the Cu/Dol samples were obviously higher than that of pure dolomite sample and CuO sample as seen in Table 3. Similar findings were observed by Zhao et al. [53], the total amount of H2 consumed is far exceeded than that necessary for the complete reduction of pure CuO from Cu2+ to Cu0 over CuO/CeO2 catalyst, specifying that some ceria would be involved during the reduction process. Thus, it is a preferable method to compare the reducibility of catalysts in terms of the H2 consumption of reducible metal (Cu), whereby higher hydrogen consumption is needed for Cu/Dol samples (9074–44,211 µmol/g) than the amount necessary needed for the complete reduction of copper oxide (110 µmol/g). Apparently, the H2 consumption rose in the order of CuO > 10%Cu/Dol > 20%Cu/Dol > 30%Cu/Dol, corresponding with the sequence of their catalytic performance (shown in Table 5). From these findings, it is suggested that the doping of copper on dolomite has enhanced the amount of CuO species dispersed over the dolomite surface besides some dolomite reduction could also occur at a lower temperature (< 600 ºC), thus improve catalyst reducibility due to higher species exposure area. In accordance with previous reports [24,25] when support is promoted by reducible oxides, the availability of hydrogen was enhanced and thus resulted in a strongly enhanced catalytic hydrogenation of alcohol. This was committed in our study, where the addition of copper (10%Cu/Dol–30%Cu/Dol) enhanced the intensity of the hydrogen evolution peak, suggesting that the availability of hydrogen consumption was enhanced.
This reduction behavior of dolomite species could be correlated to the findings by Zaluska et al. [54] where the study reported that the presence of Mg-oxide at the interface between magnesium and palladium can boost the rate of hydrogen uptake. It was stated that magnesium has a large ratio of surface-to-volume therefore it would enhance the availability of hydrogen by hydrogen physisorption diffusion and dissociation on the metal surface for forming hydride layer on the surface. The hydrogenation that occurs on the surface allows the hydrogen to diffuse into magnesium. Wilasinee Wisaijorn et al. [55] reported on the reducibility of zirconia supported copper catalysts on addition of calcium oxide. Accordingly, the higher reducibility was possibly accredited to the reduction of calcium oxide species consuming more hydrogen content since calcium is an excellent reducing agent, as it interacts with almost any form of metal oxide to form the corresponding metal [13]. In this way, the addition of calcium oxide into copper-based catalysts gave a pronounced effect on the catalyst reduction behavior.
Since the reduction of the Cu/Dol catalyst might lead to the emergence of mixed-oxides and alloys at different structure compositions, other phases such as CaO, MgAl2O4, CaCO3 and MgCO3 need to be taken into consideration. They may contribute to the hydrogen uptake. Consequently, the H2-TPR profile shows that copper doped dolomite catalyst is active and stable during the catalytic activity conducted.
3.5. Textural properties
The BET surface area, pore volume, and average pore size of the catalysts are shown in Table 2. It indicates that the BET surface area tends to decrease when copper was added. From 13.3 m2/g for pure support, the surface area decreased to 10.7 m2/g in the case of 30%Cu/Dol catalyst. Pore volume shows a similar trend, decreasing from 0.276 cm3/g for pure dolomite to only 0.094 cm3/g in the case of 30%Cu/Dol catalyst. This is an indication that Cu is agglomerated forming particles on the surface of dolomite. Therefore the addition of copper to dolomite support is expected to cover the pores of the doped catalyst surface and that of dolomite hence reduces the surface area [56]. A similar finding was reported by Thirupathi et al. [33]. The reduction in the surface area of Mn–Ni(0.4)/TiO2 was due to the blocking effect of the support material upon the loading of nickel oxide. In another finding, He et al. [57] suggest that the addition of boric oxide to Cu–SiO2 catalyst was presumed to cover the catalyst surface and thus plug the pores, causing a decrease of surface area and accessible pore volumes, therefore, reduce the pores volume.
The reduction of the BET surface area is in line with the increase in particle size. This behavior has been correlated with crystallite size calculation from XRD results and particle size diameter estimated by N2O analysis (Table 2) which shows that the catalysts with higher copper loading promote an increase in Cu particle size [19,29]. Similarly, the catalyst agglomeration stage became greater with an increase in copper loading thus resulting to interparticle porosity reduction in the catalyst which is consistent with the FESEM morphology (see Fig. 7) obtained in this study.
Besides, the loading of copper has a substantial impact on the catalyst average pore size. It dropped from 152.02 to 19.00 Å with an increase in copper loading. This is expected due to the high decomposition of the loaded copper precursor compounds leading to the collapse of some of the porous walls thereby partially blocking some of the surface pore channels (structure destruction). Apart from that, the reduction of pore size may not be surprising due to the occurrence of cluster copper species that formed new active sites (new pore) in the loaded catalyst. A similar observation has been reported in the literature by Zhao et al. [46] and was attributed to the partial blockage and destruction of the support structure.
Nevertheless, the decrease in pore diameter and pore volume could enhance the catalytic performance as observed in this study (Table 5) due to the availability of more active sites for the reaction. This may be based on the fact that catalytic reaction happens first on the surface of metal active sites before moving into the active sites inside the pore. Thereby effecting the stronger adsorption-desorption process. The presence of active metal inside the small pore diameter is assumed to help the reusability and stability of the catalyst for the next catalytic reaction.
N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distribution (insert graph) of all the catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 6 and they all depict type III isotherm with type 3 hysteresis (H3) in line with the IUPAC classification [58]. The type III isotherm of the catalyst indicates the adsorbed molecules are typically clustered, in other words, the amount of gas (adsorbed uptake) on the catalyst surface increases without limit with increasing pressure/concentration and its relative saturation approaches unity. The behavior is referred to as the weak multilayer interactions between the adsorbed molecules and this is the typical form of isotherm assigned by a non-porous adsorbate of solid catalyst as seen in this study. Meanwhile, the pore size distribution of all the catalysts indicates mesopores characteristic (ranging from 2 to 10 nm). The occurrence of hysteresis loops at higher relative pressure p/p0 = 0.8 is evidence of the existence of mesopores. The small BET surface area of the catalysts reflects essentially the nonporous nature of the material and corroborated by the obtained morphology shown in Fig 7.

3.6. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM-EDX)
The illustration of FESEM images for dolomite support and doped catalysts are presented in Fig. 7. As for dolomite sample, the individual grains segregation can be clearly identified. While for all the copper doped dolomite catalysts, the segregated grains become increasingly invisible. The catalysts displayed a more agglomerated structure with an increase in copper loading. Obviously, it can be seen that the introduction of Cu on dolomite alters the dolomite morphology. As evidence of that, the crystallite size of the catalysts (Table 2) increased with increased copper loading implying the growth of catalyst crystal. A similar observation was reported when copper was added to Ni-Zn nano ferrite by Dantas et al. [29]. Besides, the addition of copper to dolomite in this study is suggested to preferentially situated at the external surface of support as the behavior of the catalyst features is much related to its textural properties shown in Fig. 6. This finding was also agreed with Duo et al. [45]. Furthermore, the increase in copper content in the catalysts was confirmed with the EDX results (insert graph) shown in Fig. 7. In addition to the presence of Cu, other elements namely C, O, Ca, and Mg were also detected confirming the carbonate characteristic of the dolomite support.
3.7. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
For a deeper understanding, 20%Cu/Dol catalyst was selected for high-resolution XPS analysis to identify the chemical states of the surface species (oxidation states of the elements) present on the catalyst surface in terms of Cu, Mg, Ca and O. Fig. 8a displays the XPS convolution spectra of wide scan elements. The binding energy (BE) of O 1 s, Ca 2p, Mg 2p and Cu 2p spectra have been referred to the calibrated C 1s (BE = 284.5 eV). The XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 8b–e while Table 4 summarizes the corresponding qualitative analysis of BE for each metal species with a comparison with XPS NIST database. From the XPS spectra Fig. 8b, O 1s is observed at BE of 528.2 eV, 528.8 eV, and 530.5 eV. The BE of a deconvoluted peak at 530.5 eV is ascribed to the oxygen from the carbonate of dolomite catalyst which corresponds to CaCO3 [21] while 528.2 eV and 528. 8 eV are attributed to the oxygen from Cu2MgO3 and CaO, respectively [21]. The high resolution spectra depicted in Fig. 8c shows the deconvoluted peak of Ca 2p at BE of 347.6 eV and 347.4 eV. The Ca 2p level shows the spin-orbit doublet Ca 2p3/2 and Ca 2p1/2 at BE of (347.6 eV, 344.2 eV) and (347.4 eV, 350.9 eV) which represents CaO and CaCO3 species [21,59], respectively. It is clear that the outermost surface layer of Ca solid is extensively presented by oxide group. The multiplet splitting between 2p3/2, and 2p1/2, over Ca 2p is attributed as ∼3.5 eV [21]. The analysis of XPS spectra of Cu 2p region in Fig. 8d reveals the exclusive presence of Cu0 and Cu2+ species on the catalyst surface at BE of 932.20 eV and 941.5 eV, respectively which agreed well with the literatures [15,60]. The spin-orbit doublet of Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 is attributed to BE of (932.2 eV, 952.0 eV) and (941.5 eV, 961.5 eV), respectively. It is confirmed that the outermost surface layer of Cu consists of Cu (Cu0) and Cu2MgO3 (Cu2+) [60] while the BE and spin-orbital splitting between Cu2p3/2 and Cu2p1/2 is well-matched with the reported values of ∼19.9 eV [21]. This result indicates the extensive development of Cu0 and Cu2+species which dominate the catalyst layer. The formation of Cu0 might be due to the reduction of CuO during reduction treatment by H2 at 600°C. It is also seen that the Cu 2p envelope contains residual of Cu2+on the surface which is assigned to the spinel oxide formation of Cu2MgO3 [34]. Overall, it is reasonable to conclude that Cu species detected (metallic Cu0 and Cu2+) are consistent with XRD analysis. Table 4 also collects the Cu0/Cu2+ surface atomic ratio of Cu2p3/2 obtained from XPS data. It is worth noting that the metallic Cu0 atomic ratio of 20%Cu/Dol catalyst are much higher than Cu2+ ratio (1.65 in Table 4), indicating that metallic species are predominant on the catalyst surface than the oxide species. The Mg 2p spectrum in Fig. 8e was recorded at BE of 49 eV and 46.8 eV and was assigned to Mg0 and KLL (satellite peak), respectively [21]. This shows the coexistence of reduced state of Mg0 on the catalyst surface while Mg+ and Mg2+ species are not recorded in the XPS analysis. This indicates that some oxide species of Mg in the bulk has been reduced to Mg0 on the outermost surface layer of the catalyst, which agrees with its high presence in dolomite support. It is also suggested that oxide atoms of Mg are far from the catalyst surface therefore hard to be detected by XPS measurements. Nonetheless, it is important to note that the XPS technique detects surface and sub-surface species not bulk species [61] therefore the XPS results illustrates the existence of Mg0 on the catalysts surface only contrary to XRD measurement that confirm the presence of MgCO3 (Mg2+) species. This suggests that Mg0 is better dispersed on surface than its oxide form. All detected components in XPS spectra are recognized as the active species for catalytic reaction since most reaction happened on the surface of the catalyst.

3.8. Catalytic hydrogenolysis of copper supported on dolomite
Table 5 shows the activity of the synthesized catalysts in glycerol hydrogenolysis to 1,2-PDO. Metallic copper and dolomite support were also deployed in the hydrogenolysis reaction for comparison purposes. A blank reaction was also conducted. The results of all catalysts were evaluated in terms of glycerol conversion and selectivity to 1,2-PDO. The presence of propanol, ethylene glycol, and ethanol as side products in this reaction were not identified contrary to some earlier studies [12,23,26,62], however, acetol and methanol were identified. Results in this study indicate very low glycerol conversion (8.73%) for the blank experiment. With the presence of catalysts in the reaction, higher glycerol conversion was observed. The reaction catalyzed by dolomite and copper metal results in 10.6% and 22.62% glycerol conversion with no selectivity to the desired product (1,2-PDO). The introduction of Cu/dolomite catalysts influences the reaction. Catalysts with 20%Cu and 30%Cu loading show better 1,2-PDO selectivity (79%, 77.77%) than 10%Cu (57.55%) as shown in Table 5. The higher TOF value of 20%Cu/Dol and 30%Cu/Dol reflect the high catalytic activity of the catalysts in glycerol hydrogenolysis.

The high catalytic activity of copper doped dolomite catalysts could be attributed to several improved physicochemical properties of the catalyst, such as stronger acidity (more acid sites amount), high reducibility properties (reduced at a lower temperature) and moderate copper dispersion of the catalyst. The glycerol hydrogenolysis is known to initially proceed by adsorption of glycerol on the acid sites during dehydration reaction of glycerol to give acetol and consequently to yield 1,2-PDO (Scheme 1). According to that, higher acidity provides a greater number of active sites, hence a greater number of glycerol molecules can be adsorbed on the catalyst surface (Cu/Dol) compared with that of pure CuO and dolomite sample. The improved acidity of catalysts on the addition of Cu to dolomite sample can be seen in the TPD profile (Fig. 2 and Table 1) which agrees with the reaction results. This is consistent with similar earlier studies that reported the acid site is a greater influencing factor in hydrogenolysis reaction [18,27]. Next, the metallic site of catalyst is very important for the glycerol hydrogenation reaction. In this study, the metallic copper on dolomite surface facilitates the catalytic reaction by dissociation of hydrogen gas into hydride, therefore, helping in the hydrogenation of acetol intermediate to give 1,2-PDO (Scheme 1). The formation of metallic copper in Cu/Dol catalyst is closely related to its reduction behavior. H2-TPR profile as illustrated in Fig. 5 shows that copper species of Cu/Dol catalyst was essentially reduced at lower reduction temperature than pure CuO species. It is good that dolomite could alter the reduction properties for copper oxide species. It is an indication that the oxygen vacancy defects took part in the reduction process. Therefore, the catalytic reaction was conducted in the reduction region where the catalyst remained in its reduced state (metallic) to provide active sites for hydrogenation reaction to occur. The reaction performance in this study conducted at 200 ºC agrees with the reduction temperature for copper species (≥ 200 ºC). This may be the reason why copper is of research interest in glycerol hydrogenolysis. The role of the reaction temperature in glycerol hydrogenolysis performance is indicated in Table 7. The performance at low reaction temperature (< 170 ºC) is poor. This is attributed to the inability of copper species to play its role in dissociating hydrogen gas into hydride during hydrogenation reaction of acetol to 1,2-PDO, since the reaction temperature is far from copper reduction region (∼200 ºC), that is to say, the catalyst could not be in the form of metallic state and/or in the form of metal oxide.
In addition to the above, the impact of particle size on the catalyst activity was also observed. According to Table 5, the most active catalyst for 1,2-PDO selectivity is the one having moderately lower copper dispersion (21.42% and 19.47%) which include 20%Cu/Dol and 30%Cu/Dol catalyst compared to 10%Cu/Dol. Similarly, these catalysts present Cu larger cluster sizes (31.06 and 84.91 nm) and particle sizes (4.45 and 4.90 nm) than 10%Cu/Dol catalyst (Table 2). It could be proposed that with larger catalyst particles the structure of Cu is crucially modified, creating larger Cu surface area (Table 2) which important for reaction site. Therefore, much higher glycerol conversion and 1,2-PDO selectivity were observed for 20%Cu/Dol and 30%Cu/Dol catalysts than 10%Cu/Dol.
The high catalytic activity over large particle size in this study is proposed to be related with the capability of hydrogen to be activated. According to Karelovic and Ruiz [19], a large copper particle of Cu/ZnO catalyst lead to greater catalytic activity due to the hydrogen could be activated particularly (enhanced hydrogen adsorption) over larger copper particle. A similar observation has been reported for cobalt-based catalysts [63]. It was suggested that the determining factor in H2 adsorption is the accessibility of larger Co atoms on the surface of the catalyst particles. In glycerol hydrogenolysis to 1,2-PDO, several authors have suggested that the hydrogenation reaction of some intermediates e.g. acetol or glyceraldehyde species is the rate-determining step, therefore the rate of hydrogen supply could have a substantial effect on the overall reaction activity [8,64,65].
Thus, the capability of H2 (activation) with a large size of catalyst particle is found to be closely related. Literature found that over larger catalyst particle, different types of catalyst exposed plane or defect was generated. This in return would contribute to H2 activation and so the catalytic performance [19]. It has been proposed that the existence of particular Cu defects on the surface of copper particles using well-defined copper facets (Cu (100), Cu (110), or Cu (111)) correlates well with a good reaction activity. The defect is associated with the confined crystallization of copper particles by a strong interfacial contact with the support component thus driving to a kinetically trapped form of copper facets which leads to the creation of active sites [19]. In this study, the existence of copper structure appears with Cu facets of Cu (111), Cu (200), and Cu (220). Therefore, from the foregoing, it can be suggested that different structures of copper particles are advantaged and strengthened the hydrogenating property of the catalysts and so the catalytic performance. Meanwhile, the linear relationships between catalytic activity and copper surface area has been earlier published for copper-based catalysts [66]. It has been suggested that larger Cu surface area defines higher catalytic activity.
Consequently, all the results of Physico-chemical properties (acid site, metallic copper, copper particle size, copper surface area, copper structure, copper dispersion) of Cu/Dol catalyst provide evidence on the nature of the active sites involved in the reaction thereby reinforcing the reason for their performance in glycerol hydrogenolysis to 1,2-PDO. In addition, when the activity of 20%Cu/Dol catalyst was compared with the reported catalysts from other literature as shown in Table 6, the catalyst in this study exhibited good glycerol conversion and 1,2-PDO selectivity within reasonable reaction temperature, pressure and time. Our findings have also been compared with the findings resulting from the used of fixed-bed reactor [1,76]. It showed that higher glycerol conversion (100%, 71%) and 1,2-PDO selectivity (61.5% and 87%) are obtained at low hydrogen pressure (0.75 MPa) (Cu/γ-Al2O3) and short reaction time (2 h) (Cu/Al2O3,). The high performance of glycerol hydrogenolysis from fixed-bed reactor is due to the reaction system are performed in vapor phase condition therefore this would faster the catalytic reactivity within short reaction time and low hydrogen pressure. The glycerol hydrogenolysis of 20%Cu/Dol in this study was further optimized by several reaction parameters and the result as shown in Section 3.8.

3.9. Optimization study
The optimization study namely the effect of reaction temperature, reaction pressure, and reaction time on glycerol hydrogenolysis activity were studied and the results are hereby reported.
3.9.1. Effect of reaction temperature
The effect of the reaction temperature is shown in Table 7. It shows an increased in glycerol conversion and 1,2-PDO selectivity with increased temperature from 110 ºC to 180 ºC. As the reaction temperature exceeds 180 ºC, the selectivity toward 1,2-PDO remained almost constant, irrespective of the glycerol conversion. The increased catalytic reaction with an increase in temperature is attributed to effective mass transfer of reactant and product facilitated by high hydrogen molecule produced at high reaction energy. A similar observation was reported in literature [24,72] and it was proposed that the acceleration of the chemical reaction activity at high reaction temperature is kinetically controlled by the catalyst activation energy. At high temperature, the catalyst particles will move faster and collide more frequently thereby increasing the average kinetic energy (collision) of the particles which later created lower activation energy. In this study, the interfacial synergistic catalysis of Cu/Dol changes the reaction pathway which decreased the activation energy thereby increasing the performance of glycerol hydrogenolysis. In this study, glycerol conversion and 1,2-PDO selectivity become stable once reaction temperature reached 180 ºC, indicating that temperature is close to catalyst reduction temperature whereby it is active to dissociate hydrogen molecules into hydride on metallic copper site. Therefore 180 ºC is adequate for the metallic copper to dissociate hydrogen molecules on its metallic sites, thus it was set as a benchmark for the reaction temperature in this study. For all catalytic reactions, the produced methanol was reflected in the occurrence of CC bond breaking of the intermediate products during reaction performance.

Reaction conditions: 20 ml of aqueous glycerol (20wt%); H2 pressure 4 MPa; catalyst dosage 1 g; reaction time 10 h.
3.9.2. Effect of hydrogen pressure
The results of glycerol hydrogenolysis at different hydrogen pressures as indicated in Table 8 shows the increase in glycerol conversion and 1,2-PDO selectivity from 68.54% to 80.53% and 59% to 80.82%, respectively as the pressure was elevated from 1 MPa to 2 MPa. A similar result was reported by Gao et al. [69], where ∼80.82% selectivity of 1,2-PDO was also achieved at 2 MPa. At lower H2 pressure (1 MPa), the selectivity of acetol was found to be higher when compared with higher reaction pressures, indicating low hydrogen pressure is incapable of hydrogenating acetol into 1,2-PDO. The selectivity of acetol decreased from 30.91% to ∼18% when the hydrogen pressure increased from 2 MPa to 4 MPa, while the selectivity of 1,2-PDO increased from 59% to ∼79%. This observation indicates that the hydrogenation of acetol to 1,2-PDO is much dependent on the hydrogen pressure. As the hydrogen pressure increases more hydrides will be generated on metallic copper sites from hydrogen therefore help the breaking of CO bond of acetol to form 1,2-PDO [73]. A similar observation was reported by Mallesham et al. [24] which indicates that high hydrogen pressure gives rise to high 1,2-PDO in hydrogenolysis of glycerol and was due to the availability of more hydrogen species on metal sites. The addition of higher H2 pressure exceeding 2 MPa however showed little changes in both the glycerol conversion and the 1,2-PDO selectivity, indicating a strong chemisorption bonding of adsorbed intermediate product on the catalyst surface, hence no further improvement. The trend of 1,2-PDO selectivity follows the order of 2 MPa (81%) > 3 MPa (80%) > 4 MPa (79%) > 1 MPa (59%). It is therefore concluded that the 2 MPa hydrogen pressure was optimum for the hydrogenation of acetol to 1,2-PDO in the hydrogenolysis of glycerol.

3.9.3. Effect of reaction time
Glycerol hydrogenolysis performance was affected by the time of the reaction as indicated in Table 9. The glycerol conversion and 1,2-PDO selectivity increased significantly from 87.82% to 100% and 77.04% to 92.21% with an increase in reaction time from 2 h to 6 h respectively. The increased reaction time allows good contact time (mass transfer process) for the intermediate molecules to adsorb on the catalyst surface to form the final product. Therefore, 6 h of reaction time was found to be highly efficient for hydrogenolysis activity. Based on the optimization study, the overall best result was found at a reaction temperature of 180 ºC, reaction pressure of 2 MPa and a reaction time of 6 h.

3.9.4. Study of stability, reusability, and regeneration of the spent catalyst
20%Cu/Dol catalyst was examined for its recoverability and stability in hydrogenolysis reaction and the result is as shown in Fig. 9. Prior to reusability study, firstly the used catalyst was isolated from the reaction solution by centrifugation, dried in an oven overnight at 80 ºC then crushed into a fine powder and finally reused. The reusability test was conducted at the following conditions: 180 ºC of reaction temperature, 2 MPa of H2 pressure, 20 wt% aqueous glycerol solution, 1 g of reduced catalyst, stirring speed of 400 rpm, and 6 h or reaction time. After each test, the catalyst was isolated from the reaction mixture and then, the catalyst was washed with distilled water and dried at 100 ºC for 12 h. Results in Fig. 9 indicates a general decline in both the glycerol conversion and the selectivity to 1,2-PDO from 100% to 59% and 92.21% to 60.58%, respectively. However, the acetol product increased after each reaction cycle. This suggests that the reduction of 1,2-PDO selectivity was caused by the inability of the acetol to hydrogenate into 1,2-PDO which can be attributed to possible catalyst deactivation.

Investigation to figure out the responsible factors for the deactivation of the catalyst after the reusability test was carried out using several characterization analyses. The XRD analysis of fresh, spent, and regenerated catalyst is shown in Fig. 10. As noticed from Fig. 10 the diffraction peak at 2θ = 18.07º, 29.60º, 36.13º, 38.45º, 43.49º, and 50.56º of spent catalyst possessed lower crystallinity compared to fresh catalyst. This was attributed to crystallinity deterioration behavior due to the formation of carbonaceous residue deposited on the catalyst surface. The XRD patterns revealed low-intensive peaks at 2θ = 59º due to copper oxide. The arise of copper oxide peaks in spent catalysts is due to re-oxidation or in-situ oxidation of Cu/Dol catalyst during the process of washing the catalyst after each usage. Therefore, it was confirmed that the gradual decrease in hydrogenolysis reaction over five consecutive cycles was caused by the deposition of progressive coke on the catalyst surface and oxidation of Cu phase.

In addition to the above analysis, the coke formation on the spent catalyst (after fifth time) was also studied using temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), field emission spectroscopy emission morphology-elemental dispersive X-ray (FESEM-EDX), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and results shown in Figs. 11–13. The TPO analysis detects coke converted to CO2 only. Therefore, coke which has been converted to volatile hydrocarbons or CO will not be detected. It was noticed that the peak of spent catalyst is different from the fresh catalyst. Three new peaks appeared at 220 ºC, 373 ºC and 449 ºC for spent catalyst. As suggested by Li et al. peak at <300°C indicates the oxidation of coke occurred on or near the metal sites while peak at higher temperature is attributed to the formation of coke on catalyst support [74]. Therefore, the presence of peak at >600 ºC for spent catalyst suggest the presence of carbon residue arising from the support since dolomite is a source of carbonate [21]. The peak for dolomite support was also observed in the fresh catalyst due to oxidation of carbonate in CaMg(CO3)2. Insert table in Fig. 11 showed the O2 desorption data for fresh and spent catalysts. It implied that the spent catalyst rendered higher O2 desorption amount compared to fresh catalyst which may be due to the deposition of more carbonaceous deposits after reusability reaction. The observation suggests that the coke deposit might have arisen from both the metal and the support.

The SEM morphologies of fresh and spent catalysts as displayed in Fig. 12 showed coke formation on the spent catalyst which is represented by carbon thread which is quite different from the morphology of the fresh catalyst. The insert graph showed the EDX results of the catalysts which show that the carbon content increased from 9.77% (fresh) to 43.28% (spent) due to formation of carbon residue throughout reaction cycles.
In the thermogravimetric analysis in Fig. 13, the profile of the spent catalyst presents a significant weight loss compared to fresh catalyst. The first weight loss at temperature range 50–150 ºC corresponds to the loss of water (∼2%). The second and third weight loss at about 200–450 ºC and 450–700 ºC are assigned to oxidation of carbonaceous species [75]. Apparently, the total weight loss of spent catalyst (∼25%) appeared much higher than fresh catalyst (∼13%). The formation of carbonaceous deposits resulting from consecutive reaction accounts for the observed activity loss. This carbon deposits may be formed due to low solubility of organic compounds (reactant/product) species bonded over acidic catalyst surface sites [5].
The leaching of the active metals content was expected to be among the factors contributing to low reusability activity. Catalyst leaching of five consecutive reaction cycles was analyzed by AAS. As indicated in Fig. 14, the concentration of Cu2+ and Mg2+ from 20%Cu/Dol catalyst gradually increased from 2.17 ppm to 19.17 ppm and 0.08 ppm to 0.11 ppm, respectively, while that of Ca2+ decreased from 106.08 ppm to 25.60 ppm throughout the five reaction cycles. The reduction of hydrogenolysis activity was attributed to the leached metal species. The main factor for metal leaching may be due to the reaction process which was conducted in aqueous medium. Based on these results, it can be stated that the variation in the physicochemical properties of spent 20%Cu/Dol catalyst is clear evidence of the catalyst deactivation.

Regeneration study of the 20%Cu/Dol catalyst was performed in order to overcome the limitation of spent catalyst. In order to regenerate the catalyst after the fifth cycle, the spent catalyst was recalcined under oxidative atmosphere at 500 ºC for 3 h in order to remove all deposited carbon content followed by reduction in 5%H2 flow at 600 ºC for 3 h to reactivate the metal species. The regenerated catalyst was also tested in the glycerol hydrogenolysis under similar reaction conditions and the result was compared with that of fresh and spent catalysts as shown in Fig. 15. The result revealed that the regenerated catalyst is capable of exhibiting very good hydrogenolysis performance as fresh catalyst, giving 95% glycerol conversion and 84% 1,2-PDO selectivity obtained. XRD analysis (Fig. 10) shows that the regenerated catalyst possessed almost similar and higher crystallinity peaks at 2θ = 43.49º, 50.56º and 74.24º, assigning to metallic Cu phase as fresh catalyst. Therefore, the result suggests that the spent catalyst was potentially stable after reactivation process, suggesting that the catalyst can be regenerated via calcination and reduction process to give high glycerol conversion and 1,2-PDO selectivity as fresh catalyst.
4. Conclusion
In this work, Cu supported on dolomite was found to be an effective catalyst for the hydrogenolysis of glycerol. Several operating parameters greatly influenced the product selectivity and glycerol conversion. The results revealed that the glycerol conversion increased with increasing metallic copper loading, reaction temperature, reaction time and reaction pressure. 20%Cu/Dol catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance with maximum glycerol conversion of 100% and selectivity of 92.21% 1,2-PDO at 180 ºC of reaction temperature, 2 MPa of reaction pressure and 6 h of reaction time.
Based on available literature, this is the first time dolomite is been reported as a support of copper catalyst for glycerol hydrogenolysis and its presence correlated with the catalytic properties and catalytic activity. The catalytic property has suggested that the successful reduction of copper on the dolomite surface together with a strong acid site was the key factors that influence the reaction. Apart from that other physico-chemical properties (copper surface area, copper facet structure, copper dispersion) of Cu/Dol catalyst were responsible for high glycerol conversion and 1,2-PDO selectivity. A regeneration study after five reaction cycles indicated that 20%Cu/Dol was highly stable with 95% of glycerol conversion and 84% 1,2-PDO selectivity recovered, suggesting that the spent catalyst was free of coke. To conclude, 20%Cu/Dol, in view of its availability, low cost, environmental friendliness, easy regeneration and ability to operate at moderate reaction conditions shows promising features for commercialization as catalyst for glycerol hydrogenolysis to 1,2-PDO.
