Exploiting the multifunctionality of a designed vanadium-doped ZnO hybrid for selective catalytic reduction of NOx and electrochemical applications
This study concerns the fabrication of zinc oxide enriched with vanadium, and evaluation of its performance in SCR process and as an electrode component for electrochemical applications. The material’s preparation was optimized in terms of the concentration (10–25 wt%) and type of the vanadium precursor (NaVO3 or NH4VO3). The effectiveness of ZnO/V synthesis was proved by the results of EDS and XRF analysis, which confirmed the expected percentage contribution of zinc, vanadium and oxygen, as well as FTIR spectra, which contained bands corresponding to vibrations of Zn–O, VO and V–O–V bonds. Increasing the concentration of vanadium up to 10 wt% resulted in an increase in the material’s surface area, which reached a maximum value of 75 m2/g for ZnO/V 9:1. Irrespective of the amount and type of vanadium precursor used, all samples exhibited a crystalline hexagonal wurtzite structure similar to pristine zinc oxide. Moreover, the incorporation of vanadium into the ZnO structure caused a significant reduction in the zeta potential at particular pH values for all tested samples. The material’s multifunctionality was verified in SCR catalysis and in electrochemical tests. In the catalytic tests, ZnO/V with a ZnO:V ratio of 3:1 attained the highest nitrogen oxides conversion rate, which reached 67% at 450 °C. In turn, cyclic voltammetry tests not only showed the presence of peaks corresponding to the vanadium oxide, but also indicated the possibility of using the obtained hybrid as a feed material in a lithium-ion cell.
1. Introduction
Zinc oxide is an inexpensive, nontoxic, and chemically stable material that for many years has attracted a high degree of interest in many branches of science and industry [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Due to the extraordinary properties of ZnO, which include a porous micro/nanostructure with relatively high surface area, abundance, biocompatibility, high electron mobility [7], [8], as well as an exciton binding energy of ∼60 meV [9], attempts are still being made to design new materials based on this compound. Zinc oxide is a semiconductor characterized by a wide band gap of 3.37 eV (a parameter which affects the basic electrical properties of a material and determines whether it is a conductor, semiconductor, or insulator). Its advantages also include low cost, relatively easy preparation and processing, diverse morphology, and high chemical stability. However, its poor electrical conductivity and large changes in volume during the operation of the cell significantly limit its practical capacity, which makes its application difficult. To improve the efficiency and service life of the material, nanostructures are implemented and composites are created with metals, metal oxides, carbon and graphene [10].
Many of the properties of zinc oxide can be enhanced and strengthened by doping. Selective element doping is used to adjust the electrical, optical, and magnetic properties of ZnO [8]. Zinc oxide has previously been doped with elements such as Cu [11], Al [12], Ce [13], Br [14], Ge [15], [16], Sn [17], Mn [18], Ni [19], Ga [20], and V [21]. The enrichment of oxide materials, especially with vanadium, may significantly improve their properties, leading to expansion of their range of applications, among others, in porous lithium-ion battery electrodes, in the production of supercapacitors, and in catalysis or photocatalysis [22].
One of the major areas of application of metal oxides (MO, where M denotes Ni, Cu, Fe, Co or Ti), pristine as well as doped, is electrochemistry [23]. Combining the properties of these metal oxides with the versatility of vanadium structures allows the use of various vanadium-based electrode materials, or those consisting of metal oxide doped with vanadium, in lithium-ion and metal-ion batteries. Alkali and transition metal vanadates, among others, have recently attracted a great deal of interest as LIB anode candidates, due to their high theoretical capacity, low and safe working potential, and low cost [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. The most commonly used is Li3VO4, which demonstrates remarkable performance and cyclic stability in the voltage range from 3.0 to 0.01 V, compared with Li/Li+. The specific and permanent behavior of the V2O5 anode in the lithiation process has been considered in detail in the literature, and is a valuable inspiration for elucidating the mechanism of reaction of other anode materials containing vanadium oxide (e.g. zinc oxide) in the storage of lithium ions [29], [30], [31], [32].
Moreover, the incorporation of vanadium into oxide materials structure leads to an improvement in their catalytic or photocatalytic activity, by reducing their band gap [33], [34]. Vanadium is the most important metal used in metal oxide catalysts, which is why vanadium oxides have been extensively studied for over twenty years. Vanadium-based catalysts are widely used in the chemical industry, mostly for the oxidation of sulfur oxides in the process of sulfuric(VI) acid production. Based on this fact, and taking into account its functionality, its catalytic properties in other areas are still of great interest. Materials based on vanadium compounds may also be used in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) process, which is probably the best-known means of strictly regulating the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the environment [35]. The main challenge for the SCR process is to obtain a proven catalyst with satisfactory performance and sulfur resistance at low temperatures [36]. Of the many catalysts available for the NH3-SCR reaction, vanadium(V) oxide or vanadium-supported metal oxides are often chosen, due to their high activity at low temperatures (100–400 °C), high selectivity to N2, and resistance to poisoning by sulfur oxides [36], [37], [38], [39]. With increasing vanadium loading the catalytic performance improves; however, after a critical percentage value is exceeded, it starts to decrease again [38]. For this reason, the load of vanadium in commercial metal oxide-based catalysts is usually in the range 0.5–1.5 wt% [40], [41]. The performance of the active component for NH3-SCR also depends on the support’s properties, and hence its design and the incorporation of an active catalytic mass are of great importance [35], [39]. In view of the aforementioned properties of zinc oxide, investigation of its potential for application as a support for vanadium seems to be a promising and justified approach.
This article introduces a previously unreported line of research, focused on obtaining zinc oxide enriched with vanadium, which is expected to be more universal and to find a wider range of applications in the fields of NH3-SCR catalysis and electrochemistry. A major goal was to determine the effect of the vanadium content (using ZnO:V molar ratios of 9:1, 17:3, 4:1 and 3:1) and the precursor type (NaVO3 or NH4VO3) on the physicochemical and functional properties of the resulting materials. Novel aspects of the study included a modification of the typical sol-gel process, whereby the vanadium precursor was incorporated in situ into the reaction system before the dosing of the hydrolysis promoter. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method of synthesis and the ability of the synthesized materials to perform well in electrochemical as well as catalytic systems, the zinc oxide/vanadium hybrids underwent detailed characterization. Another key element of the research was the testing of the materials to verify their performance in catalytic and electrochemical systems. Doping of ZnO with vanadium was expected to result in an improvement of its catalytic and electrochemical performance, leading to promising materials that may find applications in selective catalytic reduction, electrochemistry, and other related fields.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Reagents and materials
Zinc acetate dehydrate (≥97%), used as a zinc oxide precursor, ammonia (25% solution), used as a hydrolysis promoter, and propan-2-ol (≥99.0%), used as the synthesis medium, were obtained from Chempur. The vanadium precursors, sodium metavanadate (≥98.0%) and ammonium metavanadate (≥99.0%), were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Potassium bromide (FTIR grade, ≥99%), from Sigma-Aldrich, was used in the preparation of tablets for FTIR analysis.
2.2. Sol-gel synthesis and physicochemical characterization of obtained materials
Oxide materials were synthesized with the use of a modified sol-gel technique (cf. Fig. 1). The ZnO-based materials were synthesized as follows: 100 cm3 of 15 wt% solution of zinc acetate was dosed using a peristaltic pump into a reaction vessel containing the appropriate volume of propan-2-ol, under constant stirring. Then, 100 cm3 of a vanadium precursor (NaVO3 or NH4VO3) at the appropriate concentration (to obtain samples with ZnO:V molar ratios of 9:1, 17:3, 4:1 and 3:1) was introduced into all systems except for the reference sample. Next, the hydrolysis promoter – ammonia solution – was introduced. The whole system was stirred for one hour, then poured into a crystallizer and left for gelation for approximately 48 h. Then the samples were rinsed fivefold with deionized water, vacuum-filtered, and dried at 120 °C in a drying oven in an atmosphere of air. All experiments were carried out at ambient temperature (21 °C) and in an open atmosphere.

The prepared samples underwent comprehensive physicochemical analysis. Electron microscope photographs were taken using an EVO 40 scanning electron microscope (Zeiss, Germany). The porous structure parameters – BET surface area, average pore size, and pore volume – were determined by the BET method and the BJH algorithm, applying low-temperature (−196 °C) sorption of nitrogen (ASAP 2020, Micromeritic Instruments Co., USA). The non-invasive back scattering (NIBS) technique (Zetasizer Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments Ltd., UK) was used to evaluate particle sizes and their tendency to aggregate (polydispersity index – PdI). X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained with a D2 PHASER powder diffractometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA) using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.54184 Å) in the 2θ range 10–80° with a step of 0.02° and a counting time of 1 s per step. The average crystallite size was estimated using the Scherrer equation, based on analysis of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (100), (101), and (102) diffraction peaks of tested samples. Energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDS; PTG Prism Si(Li), Princeton Gamma Tech., USA) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF; Epsilon 4, Malvern Panalytical, UK) were applied to determine the chemical composition of the materials. FTIR spectral analysis (Vertex 70, Bruker, USA) was performed to confirm the presence of functional groups characteristic for vanadium and zinc species. To determine the electrokinetic (zeta) potential, the method of electrophoretic light scattering (ELS; Zetaziser Nano ZS, Malvern Instruments Ltd., USA, equipped with an MPT-2 autotitration device), was applied.
2.3. Verification of application potential – electrochemical and catalytic tests
Applications tests in electrochemistry and catalysis were carried out for selected samples. The potential of the materials for use in electrochemistry was examined using cyclic voltammetry (CV). Anode electrode pastes were created with poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVdF), carbon black (CB), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), and the synthesized materials. All measurements were made at scan rates of 0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0 mV s−1. The anode material was prepared using ZnO/V as an active material. To produce the electrodes, a slurry mixture of active material (70 wt%), carbon black (15 wt%) and PVdF (15 wt%) dissolved in NMP was spread onto copper foil and dried under vacuum for 12 h at 120 °C. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation: GTM750 Potentiostat/Galvanostat/Zero Resistance Ammeter (ZRA) (Gamry Instruments, USA).
Samples of the synthesized materials were additionally tested as catalysts in the selective catalytic reduction of NOx with ammonia, in a fixed-bed flow microreactor under atmospheric pressure. Catalytic runs were carried out at temperatures from 150° to 450°C. The mass of catalyst used was 200 mg. In a typical run, the reaction mixture (800 ppm of NO, 800 ppm of NH3, in He with 3% (v/v) addition of O2) was introduced into the catalytic microreactor through mass flow controllers maintaining a total flow rate of 100 cm3·min−1. The catalytic unit downstream of the reactor was used to decompose any NO2 that might be formed to NO. Next, the concentrations of residual NO and N2O (a by-product of the reaction) in the product stream were measured every 65 s using an NDIR (nondispersive infrared) sensor from Hartmann and Braun. NO conversion was calculated according to the formula:
(1)
NOconversion = (NOin – NOout)/NOin
where NOin is the inlet concentration of NO and NOout is the outlet concentration of NO.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Physicochemical characterization of ZnO and ZnO/V samples
The SEM images of the obtained ZnO and all vanadium-doped samples (cf. Fig. 2) revealed an irregular structure with various grain sizes and a tendency to agglomerate, similar to the cases of zinc oxide doped with cobalt and manganese described by Sundaram et al. [19] and Rekha et al. [42]. However, there is a clear difference in the morphology of the materials enriched with vanadium and pure zinc oxide – the doped samples visibly have a more wrinkled and irregular surface than pure ZnO. In the case of doped samples synthesized at ZnO:V molar ratios of 9:1 and 17:3, no significant differences in morphology are observed. However, in samples with higher vanadium content (ZnO:V molar ratios 4:1 and 3:1), depending on the vanadium precursor used, a reduction (when NaVO3 was used) or an increase (when NH4VO3 was used) in the size of the particle agglomerates was observed.

The parameters of the porous structure of the synthesized materials were determined with the use of low-temperature nitrogen sorption. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms for ZnO and the ZnO/V materials (cf. Fig. 2) enabled determination of their porous structure parameters (Table 1). Analysis of the shape of the isotherms, in particular their course for low values of relative pressure and the absence of hysteresis loops, allows their identification as type II isotherms according to the IUPAC guidelines [43]. This type of isotherm is characteristic of non-porous or macroporous materials, where unrestricted single- or multi-layer adsorption is possible. Among the doped samples, the highest value of surface area was observed for the samples synthesized with the lowest concentration of vanadium (ZnO:V ratio 9:1). With an increase in the concentration of vanadium in the samples, a decrease in their surface area was observed, reaching a minimum value for the ZnO/V 3:1 samples. The same trends were observed for both vanadium precursors, NaVO3 and NH4VO3: a large increase in the surface area was observed for a sample with 10 wt% vanadium admixture, and then a gradual decrease with increasing vanadium content in the sample. The results for surface area are quite similar to those presented by Ramimoghadam et al. [44], who synthesized zinc oxide by a hydrothermal method.

The particle size distribution data obtained for ZnO and hybrids synthesized using NaVO3 as vanadium precursor are shown in Table 1. All samples have a fairly even distribution of particle sizes, not exceeding 1 µm. In the sample with the highest content of vanadium, a significant reduction in homogeneity (PdI = 0.48) and an increase in particle size are observed, from which it can be concluded that a higher content of vanadium leads to a higher tendency of particles to form agglomerates. Comparing the NIBS data with the previously analyzed results of low-temperature nitrogen sorption, it can be concluded that the values of pore size and volume probably result from free spaces between primary nanoparticles, especially since no hysteresis loop is observed on the BET isotherms. The use of NH4VO3 as a vanadium precursor results in an increase in both, particle sizes and their tendency to agglomerate. The homogeneity of samples obtained with the use of NH4VO3 is slightly lower than that of samples with the same molar ratios, synthesized with NaVO3. The results of NIBS analysis prove that the obtained materials consist of almost spherical particles that have a considerable tendency to agglomerate. The materials obtained with NaVO3 as the vanadium precursor have a lower polydispersity index than those synthesized with the use of NH4VO3, which confirms the conclusion drawn from the analysis of SEM images, that the use of NH4VO3 as the vanadium precursor increases the tendency toward agglomeration.
The XRD patterns of vanadium-doped ZnO powders are presented in Fig. 3. The observed diffraction peaks are associated with the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), and (112) plane orientations, confirming that all of the samples have a typical hexagonal wurtzite structure (JCPDS database, card number 36–1451), which is in accordance with previously published findings [19], [42], [44], [45]. All samples, irrespective of the amount and type of vanadium precursor used, have crystalline structures similar to pristine zinc oxide, indicating that the vanadium doping of ZnO has no influence on its crystalline structure. No diffraction peaks from any other chemical species are detectable in the diffraction patterns.

Vanadium doping causes a distortion in the ZnO crystalline structure. This phenomenon is attributed to a change in the ionic radius of the doping atom: V2+ (0.79 Å) is the only vanadium cation which has a radius slightly higher than that of Zn2+ (0.74 Å), and vanadium cations are therefore able to be substituted for zinc cations, due to the matching charges [46], [47]. Factors such as non-uniform distribution of dopants and deviation of vanadium from the divalent state may also cause a decrease in values of the lattice parameter [46]. The Scherer formula (D = 0.89 λ/β cos θ, where D is crystallite size, β is FWHM, and λ is the X-ray wavelength) was used to calculate the average crystallite size. The crystallite sizes are similar for all analyzed samples, ranging from 170 to 175 nm (Table 1).
EDS analysis enabled the identification of the elemental composition of the synthesized materials. The numerical data obtained are given in Table 2. Fig. S1 (supplementary materials) shows the spectra of pristine ZnO and ZnO/V materials synthesized using both vanadium precursors.

The synthesized materials are composed mainly of zinc, oxygen, and in the case of the doped samples, vanadium. This fact provides indirect confirmation of the effectiveness of the synthesis of zinc oxide and incorporation of vanadium. Compared with the pristine ZnO, in all modified samples there is a visible decrease in the zinc content in favor of vanadium. The increase in the oxygen content may result from the formation of V2O5 species besides ZnO. In general, an increase in vanadium concentration leads to an increase in its content in the sample. The empirically obtained ZnO:V ratios are similar to the calculated ratios, but slightly higher vanadium content is observed. The surface mapping images reveal the even distribution of all elements on the material’s surface, which confirms that the proposed synthesis method leads to a material with a homogeneous structure. The presence of traces of sodium and nitrogen in the sample structure probably results from the incorporation of atoms of these elements from the vanadium precursor (NaVO3 or NH4VO3) during the synthesis.
X-ray fluorescence analysis was carried out to determine the oxide composition of the obtained materials. XRF results (cf. Fig. 4a–b) confirmed that the synthesized materials are composed mainly of zinc, vanadium, and oxygen (as was indicated on the EDS spectra and surface mapping) in the forms of ZnO and V2O5 species. Strong signals with peaks at 8.63 and 9.57 keV, which prove the presence of zinc, were observed for all samples. For all doped samples, the efficiency of V incorporation was confirmed by the presence of peaks at 4.95 and 5.43 keV, characteristic for vanadium. The increase of vanadium content in the samples generated a visible increase in the intensity of the peaks corresponding to vanadium on the XRF spectra. However, it can be seen that the systems are close to vanadium saturation. A much smaller difference in the content of vanadium pentoxide is observed between the ZnO/V (4:1) and ZnO/V (3:1) samples than between the ZnO/V (9:1) and ZnO/V (17:3) samples, regardless of the type of vanadium precursor. At the stage of optimization of the synthesis process, an attempt was made to obtain ZnO/V (7:3) materials, but the material gelled prematurely during the stirring process, which suggests that the concentration of the vanadium precursor was already too high relative to the zinc content. In Fig. 4c–d the EDS surface mapping of vanadium for the ZnO/V samples is shown. The increased intensity of signals from vanadium in samples with a higher concentration of V precursor indirectly confirms the effectiveness of the synthesis – with increasing precursor concentration, the amount of vanadium in the sample increases.

FTIR analysis was performed to determine the characteristic functional groups present on the surface of the obtained materials. Spectra obtained for pure zinc oxide and vanadium-doped ZnO synthesized with the use of NaVO3 and NH4VO3 as vanadium precursors are shown in Fig. S2 in the supplementary materials. Bands corresponding to the vibrations of O–H hydroxyl groups occur in similar wave ranges for all tested samples, around wavenumbers of 3400 and 1400 cm−1. Signals from CO vibrations are visible around wavenumber 1600 cm−1. The band with a maximum around 3400 cm−1 is derived from the vibrations of N–H bonds, the presence of which may be due to unwashed and unreacted residues of the hydrolysis promoter, and also the NH4VO3 vanadium precursor. A band resulting from the vibrations of Zn–O bonds is clearly visible for all samples, with its maximum in the wavenumber range 523–558 cm−1 [43], [44], [45]. The presence of this band indirectly confirms the effectiveness of the synthesis of zinc oxide. The most important difference between the materials doped with vanadium and the reference material is the presence of bands with maxima at 1010 cm−1 and 790 cm−1, which are characteristic for the vibrations of VO and V–O–V bonds, respectively [48]. This fact also indirectly confirms the effectiveness of the incorporation of vanadium into the structure of zinc oxide.
The value of the electrokinetic potential is extremely important when assessing the effectiveness of the adsorption process, which is essential for applications of the obtained materials in catalysis. The positive surface charge causes the strongest electrostatic attraction to occur in the case of low cationic material particles. The presence of a positive charge on the surface of the material is related to the protonization of OH groups. Fig. 5 shows the dependence of the electrokinetic potential vs. pH of the solution for the tested materials. The graphs show that the zeta potential is positive only for pure ZnO in a solution with a pH of about 2. As the pH of the solution increases, the zeta potential for pure ZnO decreases, reaching the lowest value of approximately −22.5 mV at pH 9.5. An isoelectric point was observed only for the pristine ZnO sample. Charge compensation on the ZnO surface occurs at a zeta potential value of zero. Materials synthesized using NaVO3 as a precursor of vanadium, have a negative zeta potential in the entire tested pH range. Its maximum value is −5 mV for all vanadium concentrations, and the minimum value ranges from –46 to −52 mV. In turn, materials synthesized using NH4VO3 as a vanadium precursor give zeta potential values that are almost identical for all samples. The maximum value of the zeta potential is −5 mV and the minimum is −45 mV, regardless of the vanadium concentration used. However, there is a strong reduction in the potential at particular pH values for samples modified with vanadium species, regardless of the type of vanadium precursor applied. This is in agreement with the findings of Chan et al., who reported a drop in the zeta potential value of zinc oxide doped with iron and silver [49].

3.2. Electrochemical tests
Electrochemical tests were carried out using cyclic voltammetry analysis. The symbols used in this section are explained in Table S1. The results for pure zinc oxide are reported in the supplementary materials in Fig. S3a, while Fig. 6a shows the voltamperogram for Z1V10 at a scan rate of 0.5 mV·s−1. The first cycle recorded deviates from the following two cycles in the cathode peak height at about 0.97 V, due to side reactions taking place on the electrode surface and the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer due to electrolyte decomposition. The aforementioned main cathode peak is attributed to the insertion of lithium ions into the Z1V10 structure, related to the reduction of V5+ to V3+. The main anode peak located at around 1.03 V corresponds to the reverse deinsertion reaction of lithium ions and the oxidation reaction of V3+ to V5+. The precise overlapping of the anode peaks indicates high reversibility and good cyclic efficiency [50]. On a voltamperogram of the same material, at a higher scanning speed (Fig. S3b), two extended anode peaks can be distinguished, at approximately 1.20 and 1.9 V, related to lithium ion deinsertion [50], [51].

The doping of vanadium into ZnO results in a reduction in the band gap width. In contrast to other transition metals, vanadium is substituted in the + 5 and + 3 oxidation states, which causes deterioration in the hexagonal structure of ZnO. ZnO particles with substituted transition metals have ferromagnetic properties at room temperature, while those with substituted vanadium exhibit loss of these properties. The loss of these properties is proportional to the concentration of the vanadium. The reason for these changes is the decentralized position occupied by the V2+ ion, which has a greater ionic size than Zn2+. As the V–O bond is more polarized than Zn–O, the decentralized V–O bond present in the vanadium-substituted zinc oxide causes the presence of a permanent dipole, which aligns itself by emitting a magnetic field [52]. The disappearance of the peaks after the first cycle can be seen at the higher scanning speed (cf. Fig. S3b). The polarity [35] was then immediately switched to + 0.5 V to initiate lithium deintercalation, recording the change in current. Compared with the mesoporous vanadium oxide, the control sample (non-porous electrode) showed a very slow decay of current, indicating that the charge characteristic of the non-porous vanadium oxide is much slower in cationic deintercalation. Vanadium oxide in the lamellar phase differs from the control sample in terms of loading capacity. In the case of the mesoporous V2O5 film, the initial increase in current was much greater than in the case of non-porous vanadium oxide, which was also confirmed by the voltamperogram. These improved properties can be explained by the larger surface area, which facilitated charge transport in the mesoporous vanadium oxide.
Cyclic voltammetry measurements for Z1V20 were performed at two scanning speeds. The voltamperograms shown in Fig. 6b and S3c were obtained at speeds of 0.5 mV·s−1 and 1 mV·s−1, respectively. In Fig. 6b, during the first cycle, two distinct cathode peaks appear at approx. 0.45 V and 0.80 V. The changes in the size and location of cathode peaks between the first cycle and the others are related to side reactions on the electrode surface, as well as degradation of the electrolyte and the formation of a film layer on its surface [53]. In the anode process, a flattened peak appeared repeatedly at approximately 1.05 V, confirming the Li+ ion deinsertion process [54]. Fig. S3c shows a voltamperogram for the same material at a faster scan speed. During the first cycle, at the beginning of the reduction process, there is a high single peak corresponding to a potential of approximately 0.38 V. It is much larger than the peaks in subsequent cycles at the same potential value, which is related to the formation of an SEI passivation film layer during the first cycle. During the anode reaction, at 1.20 V there is a peak corresponding to vanadium reduction and the deinsertion process of Li+ ions [55]. The anode peaks coincide in the first two cycles, while in the last tested cycle the peak is significantly flattened and slightly marked. Anode peaks at potentials of approx. 0.23, 0.45 and 0.49 V may be associated with the multistage process of decomposition of lithium–zinc alloys and decomposition of the passivating film layer [56]. It should be noted that in the CV curves a stable stage was reached after the first cycle of cathode construction – this is confirmed by the overlapping profiles observed in the anode processes [57]. In addition, redox peaks centered at 0–1 V emerge between 0.01 and 3.0 V in the first cycle, suggesting potential multiple phase transitions in redox processes [58]. Note that the last two redox couples are highly reversible and remain in all of the cycles, indicating the irreversible phase transition endpoint which appeared in the voltage range of 0.5–0.8 V versus Li/Li+ during the first reduction process. By analyzing the integral range of the CV curves, capacity loss may be observed in the second reduction process; this can be attributed to the irreversible phase transition rather than SEI layer formation. Another possibility is that the position of the reduction peak observed in the first cycle is influenced by the reduction of the electrolyte.
The Z2V10 voltamperogram shown in Fig. 6c has a greatly extended cathode peak located at about 1.2 V, related to the gradual process of Li+ insertion [59]. The shape of the voltamperogram resembles the shape of the graph for pure zinc oxide more than in the case of any of the other tested materials, which may indicate that the enriching with vanadium compound participates poorly in the electrode reaction. Advantages related to the VO structure include an increase in the electrode/electrolyte interface, a shortening of the diffusion distance for Li+, and an increase in electron transport [60]. Additionally, easy adaptation to the induced deformation was observed, as well as suppression of agglomeration and improved cycle stability [61], [62]. A final advantage is the promotion of cell packing density, especially in the case of hollow V2O5 microspheres with a thicker coating [63]. Very often with systems of this type, mass phenomena (relating to the appearance of bulk resistance) are mentioned, which arise as a result of the electronic conductivity of the active material and the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte filling the pores of composite electrodes, and also occur as a result of structural changes during the cycles.
Fig. 6c and S3d show similar oxidation and reduction peaks at about 0.8 V and 1.0 V. In addition, Fig. S3d shows that a new peak appears and then disappears, in contrast to Fig. 6c (anodic), and the cathode peaks on the left side are not present at the top, which may indicate the presence of vanadium (reducing). The anode is slightly choked; a new peak appears and disappears in the third cycle. Note that cycle 1 always involves system stabilization.
In Fig. 6d, a smaller drop in capacitance was observed – the peak did not disappear. Overpotentials were noted, because they are shifted; here we have a slight anode peak at 0.2 V (there is none at 0.8 mV·s−1). The anode peaks are present everywhere, in the same place on almost every CV. The effect of the presence of vanadium can be seen best in Fig. S3e. The oxidation peak always remains, and a distinctly different reduction mechanism is noticeable, always with the same oxidation. On further analysis (Fig. S3f), a large drop in capacitance after the first cycle is observed, supported by the disappearance of the peak at 0.7 V. In view of the large voltage range used for evaluating the electrochemical performance of V2O5 as an anode material, it is necessary to find a favorable configuration of V2O5 for coping with the negative effects induced by deep charge/discharging and ensuring the integrity and reproducibility of the electrochemical response.
From the above results, it can be concluded that the cycling stability of the Z2V20 anode benefits from its unique structural advantages: enlargement of the real area for electrochemical reaction, enhanced transport of both Li+ and electrons, buffering of induced stress and strain, and suppression of agglomeration. The rate at which lithium ions diffuse in both directions, i.e. into and out of the material, is very important [64]. Moreover, reducing the grains of the material, leading to an increase in the ratio of the exposed surface to their volume, increases the speed of this process, shortening the diffusion path [65], [66]. The conductivity can also be increased by controlling the microstructure and morphology of the crystallites. Particularly for layered materials, certain grain shapes minimize the diffusion path [67]. It was observed that the mesoporous nature of the materials facilitates the penetration of the electrolyte, thus ensuring good electrical contact with the electrode and accelerating the diffusion kinetics.

Information may be found in the literature about the large loss of capacity in the first cycle, which is responsible for the irreversible formation of SEI during discharge. Due to the large volume changes, the electrodes contribute to an unstable SEI and irreversible power losses beyond the first cycle, which may also explain the unexpectedly high second discharge capacity. The addition of vanadium is intended to prevent this process.
3.3. Catalytic tests
The catalytic performance of the ZnO/V catalysts was studied using ammonia-induced selective catalytic reduction of NOx in the temperature range 150–450 °C. The results of NH3-SCR catalytic tests obtained for all synthesized ZnO/V materials are presented in Fig. 8.

Fig. 8. Results of catalytic tests, including (a, c) NOx conversion and (b, d) N2O production.
In the case of all tested samples, an increase in the reaction temperature accelerated NOx conversion (cf. Fig. 8a and c). All samples reached maximum NOx conversion at the highest applied temperature. The data show that the type of vanadium promoter used during synthesis had a very significant impact on the catalytic performance of the obtained materials. Samples synthesized with ammonium metavanadate produced higher NOx conversion rates than those synthesized with the use of NaVO3. This may be related to the presence of impurities in the materials’ structures originating from the promoter of the vanadium compounds used in the synthesis. As mentioned in the section on physicochemical characteristics, traces of sodium and nitrogen are present in the analyzed materials. Sodium is commonly known as a catalyst poison [68], [69]; thus even low levels of this element may significantly reduce catalytic performance, while the presence of nitrogen in the form of NH4+ may strengthen the catalytic activity of the materials.
The materials with lower vanadium content (ZnO:V molar ratios of 9:1, 17:3 and 4:1), regardless of the vanadium precursor used, do not display significant catalytic properties – in the low-temperature SRC range (150–300 °C) conversion of NOx is practically non-existent. The samples with the highest vanadium content enabled to obtain the highest NOx conversion rates, but the sample synthesized with the use of NH4VO3 as vanadium precursor achieved much better catalytic performance. The ZnO/V 3:1 (NH4VO3) sample allowed to obtain the highest nitrogen oxides conversion rate, which reached 67% at 450 °C. The results suggest that ZnO has significant potential to serve as an advantageous support in novel NH3-SCR catalysts.
In comparison with the commonly used TiO2, zinc oxide reveals similar favorable properties for application as a support for catalysts: an approximate band gap of 3.0–3.3 eV, high thermal stability, and easy preparation of nanostructures with diverse morphologies [70], [71], [72]. Moreover, Lewis and Brønsted acid sites can exist simultaneously on the surface of ZnO [73], indicating that ZnO might be able to promote the de-NOx activity of a catalyst at low temperature [74]. In tests carried out over molybdenum-based catalysts, a catalyst impregnated onto ZnO nanorod arrays exhibited improved activities at 100–250 °C compared with its analogue fabricated from TiO2 nanorod arrays [74]. Cerium catalysts were also embedded on a ZnO support, achieving improved performance in the C3H6-SCR process [75]. Therefore, the combination of an active support with a vanadium catalytic mass results in improved catalytic performance when the components are present in a suitable ratio. Comparison with data available in the literature is shown in Table 3.

The obtained material exhibits better conversion of nitrogen oxides than pure zinc oxide, although compared to other modified oxide materials it is not so spectacular. Further modifications of the synthesized material could significantly contribute to the improvement of their catalytic properties as more complex systems seem to act better in SCR process. On the basis of such observations, it should be concluded that modification with vanadium compounds contributes to the improvement of catalytic properties of pure zinc oxide which additionally justifies the study undertaken.
During the experiments the by-product concentration was constantly measured; the results of these measurements are presented in Fig. 8b and d. The amount of N2O in the case of samples with lower vanadium content remained constant in a temperature range of 150–300 °C, and above this range increased slightly – mostly not exceeding 50 ppm. Only for the ZnO/V 3:1 (NH4VO3) sample, higher N2O production was observed, reaching almost 80 ppm at 450 °C. In comparison with samples obtained with the use of NaVO3 as vanadium precursor, NH4VO3 samples exhibited better catalytic performance, but also produced more of the by-product. Based on the results, a mechanism for the catalytic performance of ZnO/V materials was proposed (cf. Fig. 9).

4. Conclusions
The focus of this study was the synthesis of vanadium-doped ZnO and investigation of its electrochemical and catalytic performance. The effectiveness of ZnO/V synthesis was proved by the results of EDS and XRF analyzes, which confirmed the expected percentage contribution of zinc, vanadium and oxygen, as well as FTIR spectra, which contained bands corresponding to vibrations of Zn–O bonds (in the wavenumber range 523–558 cm−1) and VO and V–O–V bonds (maxima at 1010 cm−1 and 790 cm−1). Increasing the concentration of vanadium up to 10 wt% resulted in an increase in the material’s surface area, which reached a maximum value of 75 m2/g for ZnO/V 9:1, followed by a gradual decrease to a minimum value of 22 m2/g for the ZnO/V 3:1 samples. The fabricated samples exhibited a narrow range of pore size distribution and satisfactory pore volume – this may result from free spaces between primary nanoparticles, especially since no hysteresis loop was observed on the BET isotherms. Irrespective of the amount and type of vanadium precursor used, all samples had a crystalline hexagonal wurtzite structure similar to pristine zinc oxide. The incorporation of vanadium into the ZnO structure also caused a significant reduction in the zeta potential at particular pH values for all tested samples – the maximum value of the zeta potential was −5 mV and the minimum was −52 mV, regardless of the vanadium concentration used.
The verification of the proposed methodology for the synthesis of ZnO/V included electrochemical and catalytic tests. Cyclic voltammetry tests not only showed the presence of peaks corresponding to vanadium oxide, but also indicated the possibility of using the obtained hybrid as a feed material in a lithium-ion cell. It can be concluded that the cycling stability of the anode made with the designed ZnO/V material benefits from its unique structural advantages: enlargement of the real area available for electrochemical reaction, enhanced transport of both Li+ and electrons, buffering of induced stress and strain, and suppression of agglomeration. The proposed material provides short lithium-ion paths and high electron and ion conductivity, and the space between the ions can accommodate large volume changes. It was observed that the mesoporous nature of the materials facilitates the penetration of the electrolyte, thus ensuring good electrical contact with the electrode and accelerating the diffusion kinetics.
The catalytic performance of the tested samples was related to the type of vanadium precursor used in the synthesis – materials synthesized with NH4VO3 enabled to obtain higher NOx conversion rates than those in which NaVO3 was used. Among the tested samples, ZnO/V 3:1 (NH4VO3) achieved the best SCR catalytic performance, reaching a nitrogen oxides conversion rate of 67% at a temperature of 450 °C, which may be considered as a promising result. This study has shown that ZnO doping with vanadium leads to the systems with improved electrochemical properties and higher catalytic activity, making them promising hybrid materials that may find broad applications in electrochemistry, SCR catalysis, and other related fields.
