Investigation of vanadia–alumina catalysts with solid-state NMR spectroscopy and DFT
In this work, isolated surface sites of vanadium oxide on the alumina surface were modeled and compared to experimental data obtained with 51V Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy. The geometry of the centers on the (100), (110), and (111) planes of the spinel structure and (010) monoclinic alumina was modeled using density functional theory (DFT); their 51V NMR parameters were calculated using the Gauge-Including Projector Augmented Wave (GIPAW) method. The comparison of the simulated theoretical spectra with the experimental ones made it possible to find the sites that are likely present on the surface of real catalysts. The minimum energy pathways of propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene were calculated for the dioxovanadium site in order to estimate its activity.
Introduction
Supported vanadia catalysts are a very important group of catalysts used in industry in the reactions of selective oxidation and ammoxidation of hydrocarbon into other organic substrates.1,2 In particular, vanadium oxides deposited on alumina show activity and selectivity in the reactions of dehydrogenation of butane,3–8 and exhibit the best performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of short-chain alkanes in the coverage of half of the monolayer.9 These catalysts are also active in the reactions of reduction of nitrogen oxides with ammonia.10,11
Supported vanadia on alumina can be used in the reactions of propane dehydrogenation (PDH).12,13 Currently, supported CrOx and platinum catalysts are industrially used in the processes of non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane; they require the use of higher temperatures (the propane conversion is thermodynamically limited) and they are deactivated due to the coke formation.14 Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODH) to propylene seems to be very promising due to its thermodynamic advantage.14 Currently, vanadium-based catalysts are widely studied for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane;14–24 vanadia on γ-Al2O3 support was found to be beneficial to propylene selectivity.25 The increasing demand for propylene, the high cost of platinum, the toxicity of chromium compounds are likely to force industry to switch to oxidative dehydrogenation with cheaper and more durable supported VOx, Ga2O3 or MoO3.26
The wide usage of vanadium catalysts in industry is explained by formation of a great variety of surface sites, while the catalytic properties of supported vanadium oxide strongly depend on the method of preparation, the nature of support and promotor. Raman and NMR spectroscopy are usually used to investigate the surface sites of these catalysts. Though Raman spectroscopy can provide fundamental information about bonds, such as terminal VO, bridging V–O–V and bonded to the surface V–O–Support, there is a lack of quantitative analysis and coordination.27 The most versatile technique to investigate the surface sites of vanadia catalysts is 51V SSNMR; since natural abundance of vanadium-51 is 99.8%, it has high NMR receptivity and although it is a quadrupolar nucleus with spin I = 7/2, it has a small quadrupolar moment.28–3051V NMR is widely used to characterize vanadium chemical environment and coordination geometry; employing quantum chemical calculations, one can link experimental NMR observables to electronic and structural properties.31–33
According to the literature, under dehydrated conditions at low vanadia content, less than monolayer coverage (i.e. <8–9 V atoms nm−2),14 a few vanadium species are formed on the surface of aluminum oxide: VOx sites having VO bond, 2 or 3 pods (bonds to the surface, V–O–Support). 51V NMR allows for differentiating these sites into strongly and weakly bonded to the surface.29,34,35 The relative content of different species depends on the type of alumina, content of surface vanadia, preparation procedure and other experimental conditions (hydrated/dehydrated). An increase of vanadia content results in the appearance of AlVO4 and V2O5 phases.30
AlVO4 and V2O5 are less active than the surface VOx sites that demonstrate high activity and selectivity in various processes including oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Obviously, such a scarce characteristic about the structure of VOx/Al2O3 centers (coordination number, the presence of a short VO bond, pods with the surface, and coordination number) is insufficient to reveal the specifics of the structure of VOx sites that are most active in certain processes; further the detailing of the structure of VOx species and their reactivity is required.
The purpose of this work is to determine the details of the structure of VOx sites on the surface of aluminum oxide, depending on the surface topology and to establish the reactivity of these sites. For these purposes, a combination of 51V SSNMR with quantum chemical calculations was used, and the calculations were carried out to establish the structure of VOx sites on the surface and to reveal their reactivity. VOx/Al2O3 catalysts differing in the surface topology of aluminum oxide were chosen as the object of study: γ-Al2O3, η-Al2O3, θ-Al2O3, and χ-Al2O3. Clearly, the structure of VOx centers in these samples will be determined by the structure of the predominant Al2O3 facet, but the contribution of VOx centers on other facets cannot be excluded; therefore, in the 51V NMR spectra of these samples, a superposition of spectra from VOx centers on different planes will be observed with the predominance of the contribution from the main facet. The “pure” contribution of VOx centers of individual facets to 51V NMR spectra can be obtained only in theoretical 51V NMR spectra using quantum chemical calculations. The comparison of experimental 51V NMR spectra with theoretical ones will reveal fine details of the structure of VOx centers on different facets and estimate their reactivity.
Calculations allow us to model a site on the surface and investigate its properties. Recently quantum chemical methods in periodic systems quite advanced in accuracy. Perhaps, the first theoretical vanadium-aluminum system was investigated in ref. 36 where the authors used DFT to model the film of V2O5 on the surface of aluminum oxide, calculating not only the bond length, but also its vibrational frequencies. The geometry, vibrational and other properties of vanadium oxide on the surface of aluminum oxide were investigated in ref. 37, 38, and the reaction of dehydrogenation of propane on the surface of VOx/γ-Al2O3 was investigated in ref. 39.
Successful application of the quantum chemical method of GIPAW on oxide vanadium systems was made by L. Truflandier et al.;40 they computed NMR parameters of AlVO4 and found out that the GIPAW method gives accurate results for 51V, which was confirmed later in ref. 41, where they calculated molecules and periodic inorganic systems of vanadium.
A PDH reaction was investigated theoretically over monomer and dimer vanadium oxide sites on γ-Al2O3 (100), and V2O5 (001) slab.42 The authors investigated an only plane of pure γ-Al2O3, while the support may greatly influence the catalytic properties of surface sites.
In this work, the supported vanadium–aluminum catalysts at low vanadium content are investigated with the combined approach of the theoretical methods (DFT and GIPAW) and solid-state 51V NMR spectroscopy. The single sites are modeled with quantum chemical methods from first principles on the planes of (100), (110) and (111) spinel structure of alumina and (010) monoclinic aluminum oxide; the NMR parameters are computed with the GIPAW method and then their spectra are compared with the experimental NMR spectra. The reaction of oxidative propane dehydrogenation is theoretically investigated on one of the sites to estimate its activity.
Synthesis details
The support of aluminum oxide was prepared from aluminum hydroxide with calcination at different temperatures; γ-Al2O3 was prepared with calcination of boehmite at 600 °C, η-Al2O3 – of bayerite at 600 °C, χ-Al2O3 – of gibbsite at 600 °C, and θ-Al2O3 – from η-Al2O3 at 900 °C for 12 hours. The χ phase has an impurity of γ phase.
The catalysts V2O5/Al2O3 were prepared with impregnation of the support by an aqueous solution of ammonium metavanadate (pH 7) with subsequent drying in air at 110 °C and calcination at 500 °C for 4 hours. The vanadium loading in impregnating solutions and supported samples was estimated by photocolorimetry with hydrogen peroxide.43 The vanadium content on γ-Al2O3 is 1.4 wt% (0.4 V atom nm−2), for η-Al2O3 – 1.5 wt% (0.2 V nm−2), for θ-Al2O3 – 1.4 wt% (0.7 V nm−2), and for χ-Al2O3 – 1.8 wt% (0.3 V nm−2).
NMR experiment
The 51V NMR spectra of the catalysts were recorded with a Bruker MSL-400 at a field of 9.4 T at a frequency of 105.8 MHz. One-pulse spectra were acquired by employing a nonselective π/8 pulse width of 1–2 μs with an RF-field amplitude of 62.5 kHz, and a recycle delay of 1 s was used. Before measuring, samples were evacuated in 40 mm long quartz ampules with a diameter of 10 mm at 200 °C. Then, they were additionally oxidized at 500 °C to exclude the effect of paramagnetic centers in specimens, cooled to room temperature, evacuated and sealed. The spectra were recorded without opening the ampules. The external standard was VOCl3.
NMR conventions
In this work, chemical shift parameters are presented in accordance with Häberlen-Mehring-Spiess convention.44–46 The orientation of the EFG tensor relative to the shielding tensor principal axis system is described by the Euler angles {α, β, γ} within the Rose convention.47 Due to existence of the sixteen equivalent sets of Euler angles leading to identical NMR (MAS and static) spectra for powder samples,48 the intervals for Euler angles were narrowed to 0 ≤ α ≤ π, 0 ≤ β ≤ π/2, 0 ≤ γ ≤ π/2 as described in ref. 49.
Computation details
All calculations were performed by the CASTEP program.50 The interactions between the core ions and the valence electrons were described using the projector augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials.51 The calculations of geometry and reaction path were performed at the Γ point with the exchange–correlation functional PW91.52 A plane wave basis set cut-off energy of 517 eV with a self-consistent field threshold of 10−7 eV was used. The geometry calculations utilized the BFGS (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno) algorithm.53
The 51V NMR parameters were computed with the GIPAW method54 at the same energy cut-off with the PBE (Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof) functional.55 The functionals chosen were found to provide accurate geometry and theoretical NMR data.56 The ultrasoft pseudopotentials57 used are supplied with CASTEP.
To mimic the flat surface, a layer of alumina was created from the spinel structure with the lattice parameter a of 8.08534 Å. The planes (111), (110), and (100) of the spinel structure and (010) of monoclinic alumina were cut so they were thick ≈5 Å, keeping a vacuum layer of 6 Å between them to prevent periodic interaction. The clusters were calculated in a cell of 20 × 20 × 20 Å. The structure of θ-alumina was taken from ref. 58. During the optimization and the reaction path search, the lowermost layer was fixed while other atoms were allowed to relax until the maximum force became less than 0.02 eV·Å−1. For the plane of (111) the charge was compensated with addition of protons to the lowest layer.
The reaction path employed a 19 Å-thick vacuum region to prevent periodic interaction; the transition state search method was as described in ref. 59; transition states were verified via vibrational frequency calculation, and also the nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations as described in ref. 60 were used to confirm the transition states.
Results and discussion
Experimental 51V NMR spectra of VOx/Al2O3 (when Al2O3 represents γ-, η-, θ- and χ-transition aluminas) of dehydrated catalysts are shown in Fig. 1A. It can be seen that all spectra are quite close to each other and represent a superposition of several lines. In accordance with the literature29,30 we can distinguish weakly bound tetrahedral sites with an isotropic value of chemical shift in the range from −540 to −580 ppm, from those strongly associated with the surface which are shifted into the high field and usually demonstrate wider lines with an isotropic value of around −750 ppm.29 Distorted octahedral or pyramidal type of species have δ⊥ from −310 to −350 ppm. The value of δ⊥ can be estimated as δ⊥ ∼ ½ (δ1 + δ2), where δi represents the components of the chemical shift tensor. The differences in the spectra are due to the slightly different ratio between these lines and the line widths.

The uppermost spectra are the experimental spectra of evacuated 1.4% V/θ-Al2O3, 1.8% V/χ-Al2O3, 1.5% V/η-Al2O3, and 1.4% V/γ-Al2O3 obtained with the impregnation method, fused solid V2O5. (B) Static 51V NMR spectra simulated for the theoretical sites on the planes (110) and (100) at 9.4 T; the uppermost spectrum is an experimental spectrum of evacuated 1.4% V/γ-Al2O3 obtained with the impregnation method. On the left VO bond length is given, black denotes the simulated spectra of sites having one or two pods (bonds to the surface), and blue—three. Names of centers are given on the right to each spectrum.
The coverage of vanadium in the specimens is less than monolayer; therefore, as one can see in the experimental 51V NMR spectra, particles must be present, both weakly and strongly associated with the surface (Fig. 1A), while V10O286− should be absent due to evacuation and subsequent calcination. The axial signal with δ⊥ from at −350 ppm corresponds to vanadium oxide species with a distorted octahedral environment, the signal with an isotropic value of chemical shift in the range from −520 to −590 ppm corresponds to isolated sites of vanadia in a nearly perfect tetrahedral environment, while the signal with the maximum at −700 ppm corresponds to vanadium oxide in a distorted tetrahedral environment.
A solid V2O5 phase can be present only at θ-Al2O3, since it has the lowest support surface area (S = 70 m2 g−1).61 V2O5 has vanadium in a pyramidal environment, giving a signal with large anisotropy of chemical shift and δ‖ = −1250 ppm. This signal is absent in χ + γ-Al2O3 (S = 180 m2 g−1), η-Al2O3 (S = 240 m2 g−1), and γ-Al2O3 (S = 130 m2 g−1) (Fig. 1A).61 We modeled vanadium clusters with a tetrahedral environment, their computed 51V NMR parameters are given in Table 1, and the corresponding simulated spectra are given in Fig. 1.

Comparison of the simulated spectra of the clusters shows that the clusters under investigation can be present on the surface. The geometry of the clusters is shown in Fig. 2. 1al shares one oxygen atom with an aluminum tetrahedron, 2al has two with two aluminum tetrahedra, and 3al has three (Fig. 2). Dimer is a molecule of vanadia; each site is bound to the Al2O3 clusters with two bonds and shares an oxygen with each other. Its sites have an almost identical geometry, and consequently, close 51V NMR parameters; however, its isotropic chemical shift is shifted into a strong field in comparison with the other clusters and V2O5 (Fig. 1A).
Fig. 2 The clusters of tetrahedral vanadia species modeled in this article. Vanadium is green, oxygen is red, and hydrogen (small balls) and aluminum atoms are given in grey.
1al represents a weakly bound site, while 2al and 3al can be considered as strongly bound vanadium clusters. The dimer was created for comparison as an example of associated sites. Its spectrum (Fig. 1A) indicates that associated surface sites are almost absent in the catalysts under investigation. They could be present on θ-Al2O3, since it is a phase of low surface area and the impregnation of the support took place in aqueous solution.
The simulated spectra indicate that the modeled centers can be present in the real catalysts, because the geometry of clusters is not correlated to surface features. The clusters are less constrained than surface sites, so they represent an averaged version of surface tetrahedral sites. We have to model vanadium sites on the surface to discover how surface features constrain the geometry of surface particles.
It is common knowledge that metastable aluminas (γ-, χ-, η-Al2O3) are described as being made of the same building blocks of the defect spinel structure.62 The difference between them is still under investigation, but we can be sure that the surface of γ-Al2O3 is dominated by the (110) facet.62 The neutron diffraction analysis shows that 83% of its surface is (110), while the rest is mostly (100).63 According to electron microscopy, the (110) facet is the most abundant (70%), while the ratio between (111) and (001) differs for different types of γ-Al2O3 (needle-like, platelet-like and “standard” γ-Al2O3).64 A DFT study shows that the (110) surface pre-dominates with 74% of the total area, followed by the (100) surface (16%) and the (111) surface (10%) for γ-Al2O3.65
For χ-Al2O3 and η-Al2O3 the most developed plane is (111);62 our previous study shows that χ-Al2O3 has (111) and (110) exposed, while η-alumina has only (111).66
A number of studies show that the (110) facet of the oxygen sublattice is preferentially exposed for transition aluminas with high surface area.63,64,67,68 The (110) plane of the spinel structure corresponds to (010) of the monoclinic unit cell of θ-Al2O3; therefore, the (010) plane was modeled for θ-alumina in this work.
Having been theoretically modeled on the aforementioned planes, the sites were compared with the experimental 51V NMR parameters to determine which surface vanadia species dominate in each case. It was found that the lower the concentration of vanadium oxide, the higher the selectivity in the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.69 For this reason, we investigated isolated surface sites, since they are predominant at low vanadium content.14,17,70
There were created from three to five vanadium centers with short VO bonds on each plane by deposition of VOx molecules to the surface and further relaxation of the cell. We tried to keep the coordination as high as possible, with the lowest atom layer of alumina being fixed and the charge of the cell being compensated by OH groups on the surface.
Most of the species formed are tetrahedral, and some are pyramidal. There were created many more sites; however, some centers on the plane (110) and the majority of the surface species on (111) had the same geometry and the same 51V NMR parameters; therefore, they were excluded from consideration. If the vanadium atom was not V5+ or did not have a VO bond, it was excluded as well.
In addition, the introduction of vanadium was modeled by the replacement of the aluminum atom with the vanadium one at the surface layer. The sites were created for comparison of parameters with the surface sites; we do not suppose the deposition of the vanadium atom into the depth of aluminum oxide at so low vanadium content. The sites were expected to have the same parameters as AlVO4; however, it is not the case (Table 2).

The theoretical 51V NMR parameters are given in Table 2. The simulated spectra are given in the figures above and below (Fig. 1 and 2). “sp” corresponds to the spinel structure, and “m”—to monoclinic, three numerals refer to the plane, and cipher after dash is the site number. The sites modeled are on the surface, so their quadrupolar coupling constants are expected to be significantly averaged due to the surface mobility; therefore, the spectra were simulated without nuclear quadrupole interaction. The comparison between the experimental 51V NMR and the simulated spectra should be carried out only with chemical shift tensor parameters.
51V NMR spectra simulated with theoretical values are in good agreement with the experimental 51V NMR spectra; all the sites created for γ-Al2O3 can be present on the surface, with sp110-1 and sp110-2 giving the closest spectrum to γ-Al2O3. The peaks of weakly bound sites in the range from −540 to −580 ppm correspond to the peaks of sp001-3, sp001-4, sp001-5, sp110-2 and sp110-4 (Fig. 1B).
By contrast, only the three sites can be present on the (111) plane, sp111-2, sp111-3 and sp111-4 (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, sp111-3 has two oxygen atoms that do not have protons. The Mulliken population analysis shows that the charges of the atoms are close (−0.54 and −0.61) (see Fig. S1); therefore, they are almost equivalent. During relaxation many surface particles gave the same geometry of the modeled sites; consequently, we could obtain an only type of surface centers visible in the experimental 51V NMR spectra for this plane. sp111-2 and sp111-4 are the sp111-3 site with a proton attached to one of the bonds.

The χ-Al2O3 phase contains an impurity of γ-Al2O3. (B) Static 51V NMR spectra simulated for the theoretical sites on the (010) plane of θ-Al2O3 at 9.4 T, the uppermost—experimental spectra of the evacuated 1.4% V/θ-Al2O3 obtained with the impregnation method. On the left VO bond length is given, black denotes the simulated spectra of sites having two pods, blue—three pods, and green—four.
51V NMR spectra simulated for m010-2 and m010-3 are close to the experimental 51V NMR spectrum of θ-Al2O3 (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the two sites (m010-1 and m010-4) possess negative anisotropy, like some sites created on the surface of the spinel structure.
As earlier discussed, the simulations of the 51V NMR spectra were carried out without nuclear quadrupolar interaction due to thermal averaging, taking place in the surface sites. Hydroxy groups are always present on the surface; it is impossible to get rid of them in experiment. In calculations we left them for electroneutrality of the cell. In the real system, the 51V NMR spectrum at room temperature is influenced by averaging of quadrupole interaction, caused by change of bond length, proton hopping, etc.
The sites are given in the figures below (Fig. 4 and 5).
Fig. 4 The structure and the bond lengths of the sites at the planes (110) and (100) that can be present in real catalysts. Vanadium is green, oxygen is red, and hydrogen (small balls) and aluminum atoms are given in grey.
Fig. 5 The structure and the bond lengths of the sites at the (111) and the (010) planes that can be present in real catalysts. Vanadium is green, oxygen is red, and hydrogen and aluminum atoms are given in grey.
All the sites have bond lengths typical for vanadium oxide.71 Interestingly, some of the sites have two terminal double bonds VO. The seven sites have bridging oxygen (V–O–Al) protonated; this should affect their catalytic activity. Sites 001-4 and 001-5 differ only in one hydrogen atom attached to V–O–Al oxygen, which influences the V–O bond length and 51V NMR parameters.
Some of the sites have very high quadrupolar coupling constants (such as sp111-1). If the quadrupolar constant is not averaged, the sites are expected be 51V NMR-invisible, while actually be present on the surface.
To conclude, all surface species modeled for the (001) and (110) planes may be present on the surface of alumina; their coordination, geometry and 51V NMR parameters vary greatly; while most of the surface sites modeled for the (010) and (111) planes have a similar geometry and the same NMR parameters, only a few are observed with solid-state 51V NMR spectroscopy.
ODH reaction on sp111-3
A few surface centers modeled have two short VO bonds. Having two terminal oxygen bonds is not uncommon for V/Al2O3 catalysts; it was observed with EXAFS and ESCA.72,73 The terminal VO bond has long been proposed to be active during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions over supported vanadia catalysts, though reactions require involvement of the support.74,75 Recent data suggest that the VO bond does not affect the reactivity of supported vanadia catalysts during hydrocarbon oxidation reactions,76,77 yet its role cannot be ruled out completely.75 Some works show that VO is highly active in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.78,79 Liu et al. reported that the V3+ in VOx/Al2O3 catalysts was the most probable active site in PDH.12 However, still the nature of the active sites is not understood completely. We calculated the reaction of propane dehydrogenation over sp111-3 (Fig. 6) to estimate the site's activity in this reaction. The reaction path proposed is simple—C–H bonds break, forming first 1-propyl, and then propylene. The interesting fact is that the reaction takes place over an isolated surface site.
Fig. 6 Reaction energy profile of propane dehydrogenation calculated for the site sp111-3. 0-1 – physical adsorption of propane, 1-2 – propane dehydrogenation, 2-3 – 1-propyl dehydrogenation and propylene desorption, 3-4 – proton hopping, and 4-5 – coordinated water desorption.
At the first stage, the propane molecule is physisorbed, at the second stage, the C–H bond breaks, forming 1-propyl, at the third stage, another C–H bond breaks, and the site takes another hydrogen atom, forming propylene (Fig. 6). The energy barrier between the first transition state (1-TS) and the second stage is low—7 kJ mol−1 (0.07 eV), while the activation energy for the propane dehydrogenation is calculated to be 69 kJ mol−1 (0.71 eV). The activation energy for the 1-propyl dehydrogenation (2-TS) is high—51 kJ mol−1 (0.53 eV). At the third stage, the propylene molecule is desorbed and the site acquires an additional pod, becoming 5-coordinated. The transition states 1-TS and 2-TS are given in the figure below (Fig. 7).
Fig. 7 The transition states of the reaction path calculated, (A) 1-TS and (B) 2-TS. Vanadium is green, oxygen is red, and hydrogen and carbon atoms are given in grey.
After the propylene formation, the hydrogen transfer takes place toward the vanadyl oxygen atom, forming a water molecule that moves away. The proton hopping to its adjacent O atom, as anticipated, has a low energy barrier, 37 kJ mol−1 (0.38 eV).80 The stage between OV–H2O and OV has no energy barrier; that is, OV–H2O is an intermediate step in which the water molecule is weakly bonded to the vanadium atom with a V–O distance of 2.236 Å. NEB calculations for the transition from 3 to 4 cannot be carried out, since they can be applied only to global minima. Water elimination produces a fourfold coordinated vanadium site. When a terminal oxygen is gone, the chemical environment of vanadium changes. The terminal oxygen atom of the site at the final stage has low Mulliken charge (Fig. S1), and hence becomes inactive in this reaction; consequently, the reaction can take place on the site involving V–O–M.76,77,81 The reaction mechanism taking place on V–O–Al or V–O–V could be different from that calculated in this article.
The reaction path calculated can be further refined; nevertheless, it can serve as a preliminary test for activity of the site. Energy barriers are typical for this kind of reaction.14,82 A comprehensive review on the kinetics for ODH of propane reports higher activation energies, though most of the researchers investigated generally higher surface vanadia coverage.14 In ref. 42 the authors Xiong et al., calculating propane ODH over VO, V–O–Al and V–O–V on γ-Al2O3(100) and V2O5(001) slabs at different levels of theory, obtained generally higher energy barriers. Avdeev et al., considering the same reaction for oxygen radicals on the VOx/TiO2 surface, calculated lower energy barriers (54 and 47 kJ mol−1 (0.56 and 0.49 eV), respectively, for the first and the second TS).83
The reaction calculated demonstrates that the ODH reaction can take place on a singular vanadium site, involving the terminal VO bond. The reaction supposed has three transition states; the second stage may go before the first, forming 2-propyl, since the second energy barrier is lower than the first. A thorough DFT study of propane dehydrogenation on Pt catalysts shows that there is no preference for activation of C–H;84 therefore, the reaction may start with the second carbon atom. Both short VO bonds of the original site have almost equal Mulliken charge (Fig. S1), so the reaction can start on any of them.
The reaction calculated shows feasibility of a reaction of propane dehydrogenation over an isolated vanadium site. A catalytic cycle over the site is shown in Fig. 8. The cycle is in agreement with one proposed in ref. 83, where the reaction of propane ODH was theoretically investigated over VOx/TiO2 catalyst. A propane molecule loses a hydrogen atom, forming 1-propyl, then another one, forming propylene, and leaves. A proton on vanadium sites jumps to form a water molecule that desorbs. The subsequent vanadia reoxygenation was not investigated in this work, since it is not a rate-determining step of propane ODH. The system is assumed to return to the initial state under a high-vacuum condition, since OVO cannot coexist with water or neighboring hydroxy groups.
Fig. 8 A catalytic cycle for propane ODH proposed over the site sp111-3. Numbers in circles are the stages of the reaction.
Water is the ODH reaction product, while hydrogen is the PDH reaction product. Our calculations carried out showed a high energy barrier for H2 production, 206 kJ mol−1 (2.14 eV), therefore being considered unrealistic, and this was not included in the reaction path.
It is widely accepted that the absolute magnitude of the atomic charges yielded by population analysis has little physical meaning, since they display a high degree of sensitivity to the basis set with which they were calculated.85 However, their relative values can provide useful information. Calculations at the same level of theory for 0 and 5 stages show that the vanadium atom stays at the same oxidation level, close to that it has in V2O5 (Fig. S1). We know for Mulliken population analysis that hydrogen atoms that are close to large atoms tend to have diminished electronic population and increased charge;86 therefore, the aforementioned population analysis is insufficiently accurate to make conclusions, though it may serve as a reliable assumption. Projected density of states (PDOS) with adaptive broadening87 calculated at the same level of theory shows that the third and the fifth stages are similar, while being different from the initial stage.
Conclusion
Using quantum chemical methods, we investigated the isolated surface sites of vanadium oxide on the surface of aluminum oxide, on the planes of (100), (110) and (111) of the spinel structure and (010) of monoclinic alumina. The comparison of the simulated static 51V NMR spectra of the theoretical sites with the experimental ones allowed for proposing the structure of the surface sites of vanadium-aluminum catalysts at low vanadium content.
The surface vanadium oxide sites modeled are four- and five-coordinated; they have one or two VO bonds. The vanadium centers corresponding to weakly associated with surface particles are bound with one or two bonds, and the sites corresponding to strongly associated are bound with three or more bonds. Some of the bridge oxygen atoms have protons. The (100) and (110) planes have a variety of sites, while the (111) facet of the spinel structure and the (010) plane of monoclinic alumina have fewer types of surface sites.
A reaction of propane dehydrogenation has been calculated on a site with two short oxygen bonds to estimate its activity; a catalytic cycle was proposed for this reaction. Our calculations show that VO bonds formed on VOx/Al2O3 are capable of acting as active sites at elevated temperatures. A further comprehensive investigation of the reaction mechanism with the emphasis on possible participation of such sites on other sites seems to be very valuable.
