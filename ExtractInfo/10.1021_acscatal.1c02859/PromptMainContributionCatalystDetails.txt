Atomically Dispersed Tin-Modified γ-alumina for Selective Propane Dehydrogenation under H2S Co-feed

Abstract
Developing an earth-abundant catalyst that is sulfur-tolerant, active, and highly selective is of great interest for valorizing natural gas streams containing sour gas. A tin-modified alumina catalyst is reported that is stable and selective for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of percent quantities of H2S in the feed. In particular, Sn/Al2O3–S catalysts with 1.5–5% Sn content exhibit 98% selectivity with up to 16% conversion at 560 °C during the fourth cycle. Experimental and computational characterization shows that the active sites are the defect tricoordinated Al atoms. H2S pretreatment further modifies a portion of these sites via exchanging a neighboring oxygen atom with sulfur, thereby rendering them more active and selective. At low loadings, Sn is atomically dispersed and selectively binds to hydroxyl groups or oxygen atoms on Al2O3. This prevents the formation of original (unmodified) defect sites on Al2O3 and improves overall selectivity. The activity and selectivity of the catalyst are heavily dependent on the chemical potential of sulfur and hydrogen because they influence both the relative concentration of the two types of sites and the overall reaction mechanism. Finally, the catalyst can be regenerated fully under a pure H2S stream, thereby precluding treatment under oxygen, which can lead to sintering.

1. Introduction

Platinum and platinum-group metals (PGMs) are often employed as catalysts for the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation of hydrocarbons, including upgrading of shale gas-derived alkanes to olefins. (1,2) These catalysts are severely poisoned by sulfur-containing compounds, (3,4) present in varying amounts in natural gas and shale gas reservoirs, (5,6) thus necessitating energy-intensive pretreatment steps such as gas sweetening to remove hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbon dioxide (CO2) before conversion. (7) Alternative earth-abundant catalysts, such as metal oxides, are active and selective catalysts for alkane activation; (8−17) however, the exact influence of H2S on these catalysts is poorly understood, and they are likely unstable and get potentially converted into the respective sulfides. (18) In this context, developing earth-abundant, sulfur-tolerant catalysts for shale gas upgrading to produce valuable liquid products can preclude extensive pretreatment. (19) As a first step toward this, inexpensive, regenerable catalysts are sought that can dehydrogenate light alkanes selectively to the corresponding olefins, which are important precursors in the chemical industry.
It has been shown that H2S co-feed improved alkene selectivity over certain non-PGM metals, such as Pb, W, Mn, Co, Mo Cu, Fe, and Ni, supported on Al2O3 (or SiO2). (20−24) However, the lack of in situ information, difficult to obtain under operating conditions of H2S-containing hydrocarbon streams, has meant that the roles of H2S in modulating the catalyst surface, the composition and the nature of the active site, and its involvement in the reaction mechanism are not well established. (18) This has prevented the systematic development of such catalysts. Previously, the authors showed that pretreatment of bulk γ-alumina with H2S followed by co-feeding H2S along with propane, representative of a sour gas feed, improved the rate of propane dehydrogenation (PDH) from 2.8 to 3.34 μmol g–1 s–1 and selectivity from 75 to 94%. (25) Kinetic analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations pointed to the likelihood of two types of sites, the original defect sites identified by Wischert et al. (26) (identified as an AlIII–OII site pair) and a plausible new site formed by exchanging at least one oxygen atom neighboring the AlIII site by sulfur, wherein the latter site is more active and selective for PDH. The catalytic effect of modulating the defect sites on some high-surface area metal oxides has been previously explored via (i) controlling the crystallite size and phase, (ii) heteroatom doping, and (iii) addition of a second metal to the surface. (27−31)
In the present work, it is shown that highly dispersed Sn on γ-alumina results in active and highly selective sites for PDH. In particular, sulfided Sn supported on γ-Al2O3 (Sn/Al2O3–S) with H2S co-feeding achieves a selectivity of propylene of up to 98% for PDH at up to 16% conversion. To understand the origin of this high selectivity and the influence of H2S, the catalyst structure–reactivity relationship is systematically studied through combined experimental and computational approaches. Specifically, we employed (i) X-ray diffraction (XRD), aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-STEM), in situ infrared spectroscopy (DRIFTS), temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) (NH3), and DFT to determine the structure of the catalyst, (ii) a fixed-bed reactor for in situ sulfidation and kinetic studies to probe the effect of H2S and H2 on activity and selectivity, and (iii) DFT to rationalize the potential energy surface of PDH on plausible sites of the Sn-modified γ-alumina catalyst.

2.1. Materials and Reagents
Reactant gases including 10% H2 with balance N2, 10% C3H8 with balance N2, and 1% H2S with balance N2 were purchased from Airgas. Gas chromatography calibration gas cylinders were used that contained CS2, (CH3)2S, CH3SH, and COS; and 1% CO2, 0.1% CO, 0.5% H2, 0.05% CH4, 1% C2H6, 0.2% C2H4, 1% C3H8, 0.2% C3H6, 1% n-C4H10, and 0.05% 1-C4H8 with balance N2 were also used. γ-Al2O3 (Sasol, Catalox SBA-150) was received from Sasol. The particle size was determined to be around 40–100 μm. The typical impurities reported for commercial Catalox alumina are expected to be Na2O (20 ppm), Fe2O3 (50–100 ppm), and SiO2 (50–120 ppm). Additionally, bulk Fe2O3 and SiO2 were determined to be inactive for reaction during the test study.
2.2. Catalyst Synthesis
The γ-Al2O3 was calcined in the presence of air flow at 600 °C for 4 h before impregnation. Al2O3 was also used as a catalyst after calcination. Tin(II) chloride dihydrate was dissolved in 0.5 M HCl solution in DI water. The Sn/Al2O3 catalyst samples were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of an aqueous solution of SnCl2·2H2O onto a calcined γ-Al2O3 support. The impregnation step was performed under ambient conditions, and the impregnated mixture was stirred for ∼30 min to maximize SnOx dispersion. The sample was then dried overnight under ambient conditions. Later, the sample was dried using flowing air (1 L/min) at 120 °C for 4 h and calcined at 600 °C for 4 h under air flow using a 1.33 °C/min ramp rate in a programmable box furnace. The final synthesized catalysts are denoted as xSn/Al2O3, where x is the weight percent of Sn impregnated on the support. The air-calcined samples are referred to as Al2O3 (10Sn/Al2O3), whereas H2S-pretreated samples are referred to as Al2O3–S (10Sn/Al2O3–S). Subsequently, if samples are characterized after one PDH cycle (TOS = 10 h), samples are referred to as Al2O3–S1 (10Sn/Al2O3–S1). Similarly, if samples are characterized after four PDH cycles, samples are referred to as Al2O3–S4 (10Sn/Al2O3–S4).
2.3. Steady-State Catalytic Reactivity Testing
The steady-state kinetic measurement was performed as described in the recent work. (25) A quartz tube reactor (6.8 mm I.D) was used, utilizing 200 mg of catalyst and operating at 1 atm with negligible measured pressure drop across the reactor. Quartz wool was utilized in the tube to support the catalyst powder. The temperature was increased at 20 °C/min to 600 °C. Unless otherwise noted, the catalyst was prepared by reacting it in a stream of H2S (PH2S = 0.01 atm with the balance N2) for 4 h at 600 °C. This catalyst is referred to as Al2O3–S. For catalysts labeled as Sn/Al2O3–H2, the catalytic performance was evaluated using 1% H2 pretreatment to determine the respective oxide phase performance.
Gas flows were supplied and adjusted using Brooks mass flow controllers. The reactor effluent stream was directed into an SRI 8610C gas chromatograph using N2 as the carrier gas. Typically, effluent gas was sampled by gas chromatograph every thirty (30) minutes. The gas chromatograph was equipped with a flame ionization detector fitted with a methanizer (FIDM), thermal conductivity detector (TCD), and a combined flame photometric detector and flame ionization detector (FPD/FID). Gases into the FPD/FID detector were separated using an MXT-1 column for sulfur compounds, including H2S, COS, CS2, CH3SH, and (CH3)2S. Small gas molecules, such as CO, CH4, and H2, were separated using an MS5A column and measured using a combination of TCD and FIDM detectors. A Hayesep D column was used to separate higher hydrocarbons, CO, CO2, that were measured using TCD and FIDM detectors. The end of the reactor tube served as a cold trap to capture any elemental sulfur removed from the catalyst. The effluent gases were passed through a NaOH scrubber. Of note, the formation of sulfur-based byproducts in the reactor effluent was not observed at measurable concentrations.
The typical flow rate used was 50 mL/min, with the feed gas of 1.1% C3H8, 1% H2, and 0.1% H2S in balance N2. The rate was based on C3H8 conversion per second per unit area (m2) of the catalyst, while selectivity was based on C3H6 and calculated according to eqs 1 through (4)

The carbon balance for the reaction was close to 100%. If the amount of coke generated is converted and compared to the reacted C3H8 moles, the contribution of coke is minor and can be ignored for the evaluation of catalytic performances in this work (Table 1). Typically, dehydrogenation experiments reported in the literature are carried out between 450 and 650 °C with C3H8 concentration in the feed varying widely from 1.5 to 20 mol %. (2) A reaction temperature of 560 °C was used in this study. A total of 1.1 mol % C3H8 was used to conduct experiments safely while maintaining the necessary C3H8/H2S (1:0.1) ratio. (25,32) The first data points were collected after 5 min TOS time on stream. Experiments reproduced reaction rates within ±12%, while selectivity was reproduced within ±3%. Since reactions were performed using N2 dilution (1.1% C3H8, 97.8% inert (N2), 1% H2, and 0.1% H2S), the mole change during the reaction was ignored and assumed to be constant. The rates were determined by extrapolation to TOS at time t = 0 min to determine the apparent reaction order. The rate was corrected by periodically measuring reaction rates under reference conditions (1.1% C3H8, 1% H2, and 0.1% H2S). Standard calculations of the Weisz–Prater modulus showed that it was <1. (33) Similarly, the Mears criterion for external diffusion limitation was determined to be ≪0.15. Therefore, it can be concluded that the kinetic results were unaffected by internal and external mass transfer effects. After the reaction, the spent catalyst was purged and cooled to room temperature under N2, removed from the reactor, and stored in a glass vial for any ex situ additional characterization. Typically, one PDH cycle lasted for 10 h. The selectivity toward C3H6 and C3H8 conversion are denoted by S and X, respectively, at TOS = 5 min. The relative deactivation (F/I) was calculated for different reaction conditions using eq 5

2.4. Catalyst Characterization
2.4.1. N2 Physisorption Studies
The BET surface area was measured via a nitrogen physisorption method using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. Approximately, 0.15 g of catalyst was used. The specific surface area was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Prior to the measurement, the catalyst was evacuated at 300 °C until a degassing rate of <7 × 10–3 mmHg/min was measured. The change in the catalyst surface area determined before and after reaction is shown in Table S1.
2.4.2. Powder XRD
To determine the crystalline properties of the catalysts, powder XRD (pXRD) analysis using an Empyrean PANalytical B.V. was used. (34) The instrument current was 40 mA, while the applied voltage was 45 kV. The XRD measurements were taken under ambient conditions for all catalysts.
2.4.3. NH3 Temperature-Programmed Desorption (NH3-TPD)
An AMI-200 Altamira instrument coupled with a mass spectrometer (OmniStar, GSC-301-O2, Pfeiffer Vacuum) was used to perform NH3-TPD. Approximately, 40 mg of catalyst sample was loaded into the u-tube and exposed to 30 mL/min Ar at 600 °C for 2 h using a 10 °C/min ramping rate. Afterward, it was cooled down to 100 °C. Then, 2% NH3 in He was used at 30 mL/min for 1 h following 30 mL/min Ar for 2 h to remove any weakly adsorbed NH3. Finally, the temperature was ramped to 600 °C using 10 °C/min under Ar flow and maintained at 600 °C for 30 min.
2.4.4. Dehydrated Catalyst DRIFTS Experiments
DRIFTS was used to investigate the surface hydroxyl groups and adsorption/desorption behavior of NH3 and CO2 molecules on Sn/Al2O3–S catalysts. A Thermo Nicolet iS50 infrared spectrometer equipped with a highly sensitive mercury–cadmium–tellurium (MCT-A) detector cooled with liquid nitrogen was used with a Harrick Praying Mantis diffuse reflection accessory and ZnSe windows for determination of the acid–base sites. The collection of the initial IR gas-phase background was performed by placing a reflective mirror in the laser path while using the Harrick Praying Mantis attachment. The instrument was placed in a well-ventilated fume hood with the gas detectors for safety issues related to H2S. The Harrick cell was modified with Kalrez O-rings. The outlet gas exhaust was cleaned using a NaOH stripping solution.
2.4.5. Evaluation of the Hydroxyl Region for the H2S-Pretreated Catalyst
Catalysts were initially dehydrated by heating to 600 °C (heating rate of 20 °C/min) and holding at 600 °C for 2 h under H2S flow (1% H2S; 30 mL/min). Subsequently, H2S was flushed, and spectra were collected while cooling down at 120 °C in N2.
2.4.6. CO2 and NH3 Adsorption DRIFTS Experiments
The CO2 adsorption was performed at 120 °C. N2 was replaced with a flow of 20% CO2/N2 (30 mL/min; 30 min). Physisorbed CO2 was removed by flowing N2 (30 mL/min; 30 min). Spectra were then continuously recorded every minute (with a resolution of 4 cm–1 and an accumulation of 96 scans) during the temperature programming until 300 °C (heating rate of 10 °C/min) under 30 mL/min N2 flow. The band at 1655 cm–1 is tracked to determine peak areas for bicarbonate species as an Sn loading function.
The NH3 adsorption was performed at 120 °C. N2 was replaced with a flow of 1% NH3/N2 (30 mL/min; 30 min). Physisorbed NH3 was removed by flowing N2 (30 mL/min; 30 min). Spectra were then continuously recorded every minute (with a resolution of 4 cm–1 and an accumulation of 96 scans) during the temperature programming until 500 °C (heating rate of 10 °C/min) under 30 mL/min N2 flow. The bands at 1467 and 1610 cm–1 are tracked to determine peak areas for Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, respectively, concerning temperature. The intensity ratio was calculated from the peak areas at different temperatures divided by the corresponding peak area obtained at 120 °C for the respective catalyst.
2.4.7. Electron Microscopy
AC-STEM was carried out using a 200 kV AC JEOL ARM200F with a cold field emission source. The spatial resolution is ∼0.8 Å. The high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) detection angle is 90–270 mrad to give Z contrast images. Low-angle annular dark field detection ranges between 40 and 120 mrad. HAADF images were acquired with a JEOL 2010F instrument, and elemental analysis [energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS)] was performed using an Oxford AZTEC system.
2.4.8. Coke Analysis via Temperature-Programmed Oxidation
An AMI-200 Altamira coupled with a mass spectrometer (OmniStar, GSC-301-O2, Pfeiffer Vacuum) was used in all O2 temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) measurements. Typically, ∼40 mg of sample was loaded into the u-tube reactor and pretreated for 2 h at 120 °C using a 10 °C/min ramp and 30 mL/min of Ar. After cooling down to 100 °C, 2% O2 in He was used at 30 mL/min for 1 h. Afterward, the sample was flushed using 30 mL/min Ar for 2 h to remove any weakly adsorbed gas molecules. Next, the temperature was increased to 600 °C at 10 °C/min under Ar flow and maintained at 600 °C for 30 min. Calibrated pulses of O2 (m/z = 32) and CO2 (m/z = 44) gases were used to quantify oxygen consumption and coke formation, respectively.
2.4.9. X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
A ULVAC-PHI VersaProbe III was used for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis equipped with a monochromated Al Kα X-ray source (1486.6 eV). The pass energy of the analyzer used was 55.5 eV with the acquisition area of 100 μm in diameter using the step size of 0.1 eV.
2.5. Quantum Chemical Calculations
All DFT calculations were carried out using methods desribed earlier. (25) In particular, the 110 facet of γ-Al2O was used in calculations, as it is predominantly exposed with the other available 100 facet comprising a small fraction. (35,36) A periodic model utilized a 8.036 × 8.354 Å2p 1 × 1 supercell of six layers with the bottom two layers fixed. The supercell utilized 10 Å vacuum in the direction normal to the slab. The Al2O3 (110) surface possesses low-coordinated AlIII and AlIV sites, which contain acceptor orbitals of low energy due to the truncation of four-coordinated Al atoms specific to the γ-Al2O3 structure. (37) AlIV is due to the aluminum atoms formed using bulk octahedral aluminum atoms after truncation, while AlIII is derived from bulk tetrahedral aluminum atoms. (36) After surface relaxation, AlIV posesses pseudo-tetrahedral coordination, whereas AlIII possesses pseudo-planar coordination. The topmost surface oxygen atoms are of two μ2-O and three μ3-O coordination to Al atoms.
All calculations were performed using ab initio plane wave pseudopotentials as implemented in VASP. (38,39) The PBE exchange–correlation functional (40) combined with the Grimme D3 (41) correction to treat long dispersion forces was used. The valence electrons were explicitly treated, and their interactions with the ionic cores were described using a projector augmented wave (42) with a plane wave energy cutoff of 500 eV; the cutoff for the representation of the augmentation charges was 700 eV. The Brillouin zone was sampled using a 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack (43)K-point set and verified using convergence tests of C3H8 and C3H6 binding energy. Gaussian smearing was used with a width of 0.2 eV, and all energies reported were extrapolated to 0 K. All structure relaxations were carried out with a convergence criterion of all forces less than 0.02 eV/A, while electronic convergence for the self-consistent calculations was set to 10–4 eV. Several gas molecule adsorption configurations were explored for each intermediate to explore the minimum-energy structures. All gas-phase calculations were carried out using the same level of theory, except with a Gaussian smearing width of 0.05 eV and only the Gamma point within a box of 10 Å of vacuum in all directions.

3.1. Catalytic Evaluation of Sn/Al2O3–S Catalysts in the Presence of H2S: Steady-State Performance and Regeneration Patterns
Steady-state flow reactor studies were used to measure PDH activity. The catalytic performance of Al2O3 after H2S pretreatment (Al2O3–S), 1.5Sn/Al2O3–S, and 5Sn/Al2O3–S is shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1
Figure 1. Steady-state C3H8 dehydrogenation at 560 °C of Al2O3–S, 1.5Sn/Al2O3–S, and 5Sn/Al2O3–S. The feed contained 1.1% C3H8, 1% H2, and 0.1% H2S with the balance N2. After each PDH cycle, the catalyst was regenerated with H2S (1 mol % H2S in N2) at 600 °C, for a total of four dehydrogenation–regeneration cycles. One PDH cycle lasted 10 h.
During the PDH at 560 °C, the C3H6 selectivity improved significantly from ∼75% (on an untreated bulk alumina, not shown) to ∼94% after H2S pretreatment of alumina (Al2O3–S). (25) The addition of Sn decreased the initial rate of C3H8 consumption from 2.35 to ∼1.5 × 10–9 mol m2 s–1; however, the selectivity was improved to ∼97% for 1.5Sn/Al2O3–S and ∼98% for 5Sn/Al2O3–S. At the end of each cycle, the catalysts were regenerated with H2S (1% H2S in N2) at 600 °C, simulating the pretreatment conditions. The selectivity to C3H6 largely remained stable during subsequent cycles for all catalysts; the rates, however, showed interesting variations. Subsequent PDH cycles resulted in a reduction in the reaction rate attained over Al2O3–S, potentially due to irreversible adsorption of products. (44) In contrast, the rates for Sn-containing catalysts not only gradually improved after each regeneration cycle but also reached the initial Al2O3–S activity level at the time on stream (TOS) = 5 min during the third cycle for 1.5Sn/Al2O3–S. In cycle 4, 1.5Sn/Al2O3–S exhibited stable performance similar to that in cycle 3.
To further determine the role of Sn in the chemistry, Sn/Al2O3–S at different loadings, that is, 1.5, 5, and 10 wt % Sn, was evaluated. If Sn was indeed active, a higher loading of Sn should have resulted in higher activity, and going from 0 to 1.5 wt % should not have resulted in a drop in the activity as was observed. Increasing the Sn content on the catalyst up to 10% did not further improve selectivity or improve the reaction rate; see Figure S1. In Figure S1, the corresponding conversion and selectivity were reported of the catalyst shown in Figure 1. The 1.5 and 5Sn/Al2O3–S leading to similar rates during the first cycle underlines the point that dispersed Sn atoms are not likely to be active. Furthermore, the 10Sn/Al2O3–S catalyst has SnS nanoparticles (as inferred from XRD); however, the rate of 10Sn/Al2O3–S is similar to that of 1.5 and 5Sn/Al2O3–S (Figure S1). This indicates that SnS is not an active component of the catalyst.
Coking is a typical cause of deactivation. Therefore, the amount of coke deposited on the catalysts was measured using TPO. The TPO results after the first (S1) complete dehydrogenation cycle revealed a low amount of coke deposition over all four catalysts (<1 mg per g of catalyst, Table 1). The amount of coke generated after one PDH cycle was small compared to the amount of reaction product (C3H6) formed, suggesting its low effect on the overall selectivity.
3.2. Structural Characterization of Catalyst Evolution
Steady-state conversion–selectivity results suggest that the improvement in the selectivity of Sn-containing catalysts is not due to the decreased rate of conversion but rather due to the changes in the chemical structure of Al2O3–S. The structure of the catalyst was addressed using AC-STEM images to determine the overall dispersion of Sn species after the reaction. Figure 2a,b shows a high-magnification image of a 1.5Sn/Al2O3–S1 sample that has been pretreated in H2S and reacted at 560 °C for 10 h. Single Sn atoms can be distinguished from Al atoms due to differences in the Z-contrast and are shown as bright spots marked by arrows. After one reaction cycle, the Sn species are fully dispersed in 1.5Sn/Al2O3–S1. On the other hand, 10Sn/Al2O3–S1 is composed of a combination of single Sn atoms and 1–2 nm nanoparticles, as shown in Figure 2c,d. EDS analysis shows that even in the region void of any Sn atom agglomerates or nanoparticles, Sn and S elements are detected (Figure S2) in 1.5Sn/Al2O3–S1 and 10Sn/Al2O3–S1. Since some of the particles are bound into larger aggregates, as confirmed via XRD (vide infra) in 10Sn/Al2O3–S1, a delayed improvement in the reaction rate is observed, as shown in Figure S1. The AC-STEM and TEM results show that at the highest Sn loading, Sn is present in a bimodal distribution, that is, Sn single atoms and SnS nanoparticles.
Figure 2
Figure 2. (a,b) AC-STEM images of 1.5Sn/Al2O3–S1 show an isolated bright spot that represents single atoms of Sn on the alumina. (c,d) AC-STEM images of 10Sn/Al2O3–S1 show a higher concentration of isolated bright dots that represent single atoms of Sn on the alumina. S1 represents the catalysts after one complete PDH cycle.
To further understand the mobility of Sn species on the surface, Sn wt % loading was measured before and after consecutive dehydrogenation cycles using atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), as Sn is known to evaporate/redisperse at high temperatures. (45,46) Data, shown in Figure S3 and quantified in Table S2, suggest that up to 30% of Sn can be lost after four PDH cycles. The surface composition of the as-prepared, sulfided, and after one cycle of the PDH, obtained via XPS shown in Table S3, presents S/Sn ratios of ∼1 regardless of the initial composition, with also a slight decrease in the Sn amount, consistent with bulk AAS measurements. The gradual improvement in activity for Sn/Al2O3–S can be associated with the evaporation of Sn on alumina during the subsequent cycles. We posit that there are two potential reasons for the observed increase in the reaction rate over the Sn/Al2O3–S catalyst. First, the loss of Sn (as per AAS and XPS results) with time on stream may lead to the freeing up of some sites initially blocked by Sn atoms. Second, it is plausible that more defect sites are formed due to successive regeneration steps under H2S pretreatment.
To understand the evolution of the physical and chemical structure of the catalyst under operating conditions, a combination of ex situ XRD, in situ IR, and TPD experiments was used, and the results are shown in Figure 3. Only the diffraction lines due to γ-alumina were observed in the XRD patterns of the catalysts for Al2O3–S, 1.5Sn/Al2O3–S, and 5Sn/Al2O3–S after H2S pretreatment, suggesting that Sn species are either highly dispersed or smaller than 3 nm (Figure 3a). For 10Sn/Al2O3–S, however, diffraction lines corresponding to SnS nanoparticles were observed. The same behavior was observed even after four 10 h cycles with only 10Sn/Al2O3–S exhibiting SnS nanoparticles, while 1.5Sn/Al2O3–S and 5Sn/Al2O3–S show only dispersed surface sites, as shown in Figure S4.

The AlIV/AlV/AlVI indicates a 5/6-coordinated Al atom, and μ1/μ2/μ3 indicates that the OH is bonded to one/two/three Alx atoms. (c) NH3-TPD; to quantify the total number of acid sites. (d,e) Surface Brønsted (NH4+) and Lewis acid (NH3) sites as a function of Sn wt % loading on Al2O3 at different temperatures indicated in the figure after NH3 exposure. The bands at 1467 and 1610 cm–1 are tracked to determine peak areas for Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, respectively (Figure S5a). The intensity ratio was calculated from the peak areas at different temperatures divided by the corresponding peak area obtained at 120 °C for the respective catalyst. (f) Surface bicarbonate species adsorbed as a function of Sn wt % loading on Al2O3 (Sn wt %) after CO2 exposure at 120 °C. The band at 1655 cm–1 is tracked to determine peak areas for bicarbonate species as an Sn loading function (Figure S5b). The normalized peak area is calculated from the relative peak area normalized concerning the IR peak areas obtained from Al2O3–S at 120 °C. The catalysts were pretreated in a 1 mol % H2S stream at 600 °C. The line is to guide the eye.
The in situ IR spectra of the surface hydroxyl region of the dehydrated supported Sn/Al2O3–S catalysts as a function of Sn loading are presented in Figure 3b. The γ-Al2O3 employed in the present study contains five types of distinct surface hydroxyls, and their coordination to the different surface alumina sites is given in the figure. (35,36,47) At low surface Sn coverage (1.5Sn/Al2O3–S), mainly, the μ1-AlIV, μ1-AlVI, and μ1-AlV surface hydroxyls at 3790, 3767, and 3728 cm–1, respectively, are consumed due to anchoring of the surface Sn species on alumina. As the Sn loading is increased to intermediate coverage (5 and 10Sn/Al2O3–S), the Al2O3–S band at 3728 cm–1, corresponding to surface hydroxyls, is reduced by anchoring of the surface tin. At the highest Sn loading (10Sn/Al2O3–S), the bands at 3790 and 3767 cm–1 are completely consumed, whereas other hydroxyl groups at 3670 and 3694 cm–1 are partially consumed. These observations show that different surface hydroxyls on alumina are employed in anchoring the surface Sn species on the alumina support. The incomplete consumption of the hydroxyl group at higher loadings suggests that the Sn species cannot completely cover the alumina surface. The XRD results indicate that at a higher loading, that is, 10 wt % Sn, there is a propensity to form SnS nanoparticles under the H2S pretreatment at 600 °C.
The total acid site concentration (in μmol g–1) was calculated from the calibrated NH3-TPD experiments (Table S4). In particular, two major peaks were observed at 186 and 268 °C in the corresponding NH3-TPD profiles shown in Figure 3c, wherein the latter peak slightly shifted to 256 °C for 1.5Sn Al2O3–S. The loss of the NH3 desorption peak at 260 °C with increasing Sn loading is consistent with the coverage of the surface alumina site with SnS nanoparticles. Furthermore, the thermal stability of acid sites on Sn/Al2O3–S catalysts is assessed by IR spectroscopy using NH3 as a chemical probe. The in situ IR spectra of chemisorbed NH3 on the Sn/Al2O3–S catalysts exhibit both Lewis (NH3 species bands at 1610 and 1240 cm–1) and Brønsted bands (NH4+ species at 1690, 1467, and 1395 cm–1), as shown in Figure S5a. (48−50) The thermal stability of the surface Brønsted and Lewis acid sites decreased at high Sn loadings. This indicates that the anchoring of Sn and surface SnS nanoparticles partially covers/perturbs the exposed alumina site. This observation is consistent with the loss of the peak at 260 °C during NH3-TPD. The NH3-TPD and IR results indicate that the surface contains only weak- and medium-strength acid sites.
Adsorption of CO2 at 120 °C on γ-Al2O3 resulted in three peaks at 1655, 1442, and 1230 cm–1 that are attributed to the surface bicarbonate species, as shown in Figure S5. (50,51) The 1.5, 5, and 10Sn/Al2O3–S catalysts all exhibit the same bands albeit with a decrease in intensity with the increase in Sn loadings (Figure 3f). These observations show that the addition of Sn loading leads to a decrease in both acid–base sites, indicative of modification of the nature of active sites on Al2O3–S.
3.3. DFT Calculations of Sn Species Stability on the 110-γ-Al2O3 Surface
Inspired by spectroscopy and microscopy results, we performed DFT calculations to provide insights into the thermochemistry of dispersion of single Sn atoms on alumina. Also, the lower activity of 1.5–5Sn/Al2O3–S than that of Al2O3–S indicates that potentially active sites are over γ-Al2O3. Furthermore, it was determined that the Sn/Al2O3–H2 catalyst possesses very low conversion (<0.2%), indicating that Sn potentially blocks the AlIII site. A single Sn atom can bind on several locations of the partially hydrated alumina surface in keeping with the studies of Wischert et al. (26) and Dixit et al. (52) We focused on the (110) surface primarily because it is considered to be more reactive than the other common facets, namely, the (100) surface.
Figure 4a shows the top view of a partially hydrated 110-γ-Al2O3 surface, purported to be the active surface for C–H activation, with an Sn atom in its most stable energy configuration. Figure 4b shows the analogous structure for the S-exchanged alumina surface that has been proposed to correspond to new sites formed upon sulfidation. (25) In both cases, Sn binds to multiple oxygen atoms and, in particular, to an adsorbed OH group. Interestingly, this OH group resides in the same location as the defect site proposed by Wischert et al., (26) which is formed at high temperatures (as is the case in our experiments). The Al atom to which the OH is bonded is shown in orange. This Al atom is three-coordinated on a fully dehydrated 110 surface and henceforth called as the AlIII site for simplicity, although it is four-coordinated in the structure in Figure 4a. It should be noted that this OH is μ1-AlIV hydroxyl as per Digne’s nomenclature. (36)Figure 4c shows the structure of the defect site with the AlIII–OII site pair in the presence of Sn, purported to activate C–H bonds in alkanes. (52) The defect site is formed upon a substantial surface rearrangement of surface oxygens and the Sn atom, whereby the Al atom is again three-coordinated, and the OH located here originally migrates to a neighboring Al–Al bridge position to form the μ2-AlV hydroxyl. This defect site is about 0.24 eV less stable than the structure shown in Figure 4a. On the partially hydrated 110-γ-Al2O3 surface and in the absence of Sn, the formation of the defect requires 0.19 eV, indicating that Sn can mildly affect the energetics for forming the active sites on alumina. In addition, there are alternative structural arrangements, including the one presented in Figure 4d which is about 0.19 eV less stable than the surface in Figure 4a. However, Sn atoms where found to block the defect sites in such cases. These results indicate that defect sites are less likely to form on Sn/Al2O3 than on undoped Al2O3.

The extent to which Sn is atomically dispersed on the surface of alumina as observed in Figure 2 is likely dependent on the chemical potential of sulfur and hydrogen. To study this in detail, we computed the ab initio free energy change of the reaction Sn/Al2O3 + H2S(g) → SnSnp + Al2O3 + H2(g). Herein, SnSnp is an SnS nanocluster, which was approximated as a ∼1 nm SnS bilayer shown in Figure S6. The choice of the cluster size is based on nanoclusters seen in Figure 2; in principle, any SnS representative structure can be used, and the results would be qualitatively similar (see the Supporting Information for a discussion on using bulk SnS instead of nanoparticles). Using this estimate, the fraction of Sn atoms on the surface as a function of the ratio of the partial pressure of H2S/H2 were computed, which is a descriptor of the sulfur chemical potential in the gas phase. Figure 4e shows the fraction of OH-μ1-AlIV that is bonded to Sn as a function of this partial pressure ratio for both unsulfided and sulfided surfaces (i.e., via reactions Sn/Al2O3 + H2S → Al2O3 + SnS + H2 and Sn/Al2O3–S + H2S → Al2O3–S + SnS + H2; the thermochemistry is given in Table S5). This fraction is tracked because the formation of defect sites requires the migration of this OH group along with the Sn atom to, thereby, open up the AlIII site. There is about 1 order of magnitude difference in the fraction on unsulfided and S-exchanged sites and Sn relatively prefers to bind to the OH group on the original (unsulfided) site compared to the S-exchanged site. Furthermore, it can be noted that as the chemical potential of S increases, there is a greater tendency for Sn to form SnS (resulting in a lower OH–Sn coverage). Similarly, it can also be expected that an increased Sn loading would result in a greater amount of SnS on the surface, consistent with microscopy, XRD, and XPS results.
The potential energy diagram of the catalytic cycle corresponding to PDH on Sn–Al2O3 is shown in Figure 4f. For Al2O3 and Al2O3–S (shown in the Supporting Information in Figure S7), the concerted C–H activation is the step with the highest transition state energy, consistent with the results of Dixit et al. (52) As discussed previously, the Al2O3–S surface with some proportion of the S-exchanged sites is more active than the original sites on Al2O3 likely because the relative energetics of the C–H scission step on the former sites is about 0.07 eV lower than that for the latter. (25) Furthermore, a two-site model fit to experimental data showed that one of the sites (which is assigned to the S-exchanged site) carries more flux and is more selective than the other (which are assumed to be the original sites on Al2O3). (25) For Sn–Al2O3 (Figure 4f), the subsequent H2 formation step has the highest energy transition state and is about 0.08 eV higher than the C–H activation step for Al2O3, indicating that the presence of Sn can diminish the activity of the original site further. Since Sn prefers the OH-μ1-AlIV site on the Al2O3 surface compared to the sulfided one (Figure 4e), it can be argued that Sn only affects the original (unsulfided) sites and leaves the S-exchanged sites unaffected (resulting in increased selectivity). This is further rationalized by steady-state experiments of unsulfided 10Sn/Al2O3–H2 (in the absence of H2S), where it was found that the catalyst has a much lower rate than 10Sn/Al2O3–S (shown in Figure S8). The lack of activity of 10Sn/Al2O3–H2 is likely due to Sn binding to the original sites of Al2O3 thereby reducing the concentration of defects. Additionally, the 10Sn/SiO2–S catalyst was synthesized and exposed to identical reaction conditions for PDH. However, the conversion and selectivity were determined to be similar to those in the gas phase (see Figure S9). These results indicate that Sn, by itself, is not active for this catalyst, and if anything detrimental to the overall activity; however, it improves the selectivity by preferentially blocking Al2O3 sites that have not exchanged sulfur.
3.4. Reaction Kinetic Evaluation
DFT results suggest that the rate and selectivity of PDH on Sn/Al2O3–S catalysts depend on the partial pressure of H2S because this determines the extent of dispersion of Sn and, thereby, the number of original sites available for catalysis. To further verify this, reaction kinetic experiments were carried out. Figure 5 shows the reaction rate and selectivity as a function of time on stream for various catalysts. In these experiments, the concentration of H2S co-feed was systematically varied while keeping the concentration of H2 and C3H8 fixed to evaluate the effect of changing the sulfur chemical potential. Increasing the concentration of H2S resulted in a reduction in the rate and a concurrent increase in selectivity for Al2O3–S (Figure 5a). By contrast, the opposite yet reversible trend was observed for Sn/Al2O3–S catalysts (Figure 5b–d), that is, the rate increases, while the selectivity decreases with increasing H2S co-feed. Such an effect on the rate was more pronounced for 5 and 10Sn/Al2O3–S.
Figure 5
Figure 5. Rate of C3H8 consumption and C3H6 selectivity for (a) Al2O3–S (triangles), (b) 1.5Sn/Al2O3–S (circles), (c) 5Sn/Al2O3–S (barverts), and (d) 10Sn/Al2O3–S (rectangles) with time on stream with varying H2S in the feed. The reference feed contained 1.1% C3H8, H2 (1%), and H2S (0.1%) with the balance N2, T = 560 °C, total flow rate = 50 mL min–1 (color-coded─black). The partial pressure of H2S (0.1–0.4%) was varied, while keeping other reaction conditions constant. The catalyst was pretreated in 1% H2S at 600 °C for 4 h. Solid triangles represent the reaction rate, while empty triangles represent C3H6 selectivity. In all the panels, the rate of C3H8 consumption and selectivity to C3H6 are presented.
In particular, the apparent reaction order concerning H2S is −0.1 for Al2O3–S, while this increases progressively to ∼0.05, 0.22, and 0.26 for 1.5, 5, and 10Sn/Al2O3–S, respectively (Figure S10). These results are consistent with our arguments about the nature of the catalytically active sites. H2S can molecularly or dissociatively adsorb on the unmodified defect sites of Al2O3. As there exist such unmodified sites on Al2O3–S even after sulfidation, these sites are further blocked upon increasing H2S co-feed, resulting in a drop in the activity. Since the modified (S-exchanged) sites are relatively less prone to H2S poisoning, the bulk of the flux is now carried through these sites, and hence, the overall selectivity increases. On Sn/Al2O3–S catalysts, on the other hand, it can be argued that increasing H2S co-feed leads to the aggregation of Sn as SnS, thereby allowing for the creation of more unmodified defect sites, which compensates for any sites being blocked by H2S. This increase in the concentration of unmodified sites results in a greater activity but lower overall selectivity.
Next, the effect of altering H2S partial pressure but keeping fixed H2S/H2 (0.1:1) was examined, as shown in Figure S11. Since the Sn fraction is dependent on the sulfur potential (Figure 4e), that is, the rate would be fixed and independent of either H2S or H2 concentration if a fixed H2S/H2 ratio is maintained. However, rate and selectivity decreased with increasing H2S/H2 concentrations. This discrepancy is possibly due to the effect of H2 and H2S on the chemistry in addition to modifying the relative concentration of sites. This was explored further by varying the partial pressure of H2 while keeping other reactants fixed, as shown in Figure S12. In particular, it was observed that the reaction order concerning H2 was −0.05 for Al2O3–S; the apparent reaction order decreased progressively to ∼−0.22, −0.62, and −0.69 for 1.5, 5, and 10Sn/Al2O3–S, respectively, shown in Figure S13. It shows that the effect of H2 is more severe for 5 and 10Sn/Al2O3–S. These results corroborate the fact that the partial pressures of H2S and H2 affect the reaction, although their exact roles in modulating the kinetics require full-fledged DFT-based multisite microkinetic models. Furthermore, the effect of higher propane concentration in the feed and WHSV (h–1) was explored, and results are presented in Figures S14 and S15, respectively. The experimental results show that high selectivity can be maintained over the Sn/Al2O3–S catalyst at higher propane partial pressure. Also, the selectivity was greater than 95% at high-conversion (or low-WHSV) experiments, indicating the potential of selective PDH chemistry over novel sulfur-tolerant catalysts.
4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The work here elucidates the role of defect sites on the γ-Al2O3 surface in efficient C–H bond activation in alkanes. These defect sites can be modified upon sulfur exposure. Owing to the presence of such defects over γ-Al2O3, Sn/Al2O3–S showed high selectivity in the nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene in the presence of H2S. Our DFT calculations predict that a single Sn atom can bind to the defect site of unmodified alumina, resulting in lower activity but improved selectivity. Furthermore, using a combination of reaction kinetic studies and DFT studies, it was found that defect sites of the resulting Sn/Al2O3–S catalyst can be modulated using H2S and H2. Overall, Sn/Al2O3–S can provide high selectivity for PDH for extended 10 h cycles between regenerations in the presence of H2S, thereby proving its sulfur tolerance. The same Sn/Al2O3–S catalyst performance was obtained with a higher C3H8 feed concentration of up to 8% (Figure S14). Importantly, as reported in Table S4, bulk SnS nanoparticles are not active for PDH, providing an important distinction between the bulk SnS crystalline phase and atomically dispersed tin site reactivity. Interestingly, the catalyst can be regenerated via H2S treatment without the need for coke removal under oxidizing (or oxychlorination in the case of the Pt-based catalyst) conditions followed by H2 reduction to reactivate the catalysts. (53,54) The results obtained here provide a highly efficient catalytic system for PDH and molecular insights into modifying the defect site using molecules such as H2S and H2. Future efforts should be geared toward maintaining C3H6 yields under conditions that are of direct industrial significance.

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. Steady-state C3H8 dehydrogenation at 560 °C of Al2O3–S, 1.5Sn/Al2O3–S, and 5Sn/Al2O3–S. The feed contained 1.1% C3H8, 1% H2, and 0.1% H2S with the balance N2. After each PDH cycle, the catalyst was regenerated with H2S (1 mol % H2S in N2) at 600 °C, for a total of four dehydrogenation–regeneration cycles. One PDH cycle lasted 10 h.
Figure 2
Figure 2. (a,b) AC-STEM images of 1.5Sn/Al2O3–S1 show an isolated bright spot that represents single atoms of Sn on the alumina. (c,d) AC-STEM images of 10Sn/Al2O3–S1 show a higher concentration of isolated bright dots that represent single atoms of Sn on the alumina. S1 represents the catalysts after one complete PDH cycle.
Figure 3
Figure 3. (a) Ex situ XRD after H2S pretreatment. (b) In situ IR spectra of the hydroxyl region under N2 at 120 °C after H2S pretreatment of supported alumina with different Sn loadings (i.e., 1.5, 5, and 10 wt %), showing the consumption of Al2O3 hydroxyl groups with increasing Sn loading. The AlIV/AlV/AlVI indicates a 5/6-coordinated Al atom, and μ1/μ2/μ3 indicates that the OH is bonded to one/two/three Alx atoms. (c) NH3-TPD; to quantify the total number of acid sites. (d,e) Surface Brønsted (NH4+) and Lewis acid (NH3) sites as a function of Sn wt % loading on Al2O3 at different temperatures indicated in the figure after NH3 exposure. The bands at 1467 and 1610 cm–1 are tracked to determine peak areas for Brønsted and Lewis acid sites, respectively (Figure S5a). The intensity ratio was calculated from the peak areas at different temperatures divided by the corresponding peak area obtained at 120 °C for the respective catalyst. (f) Surface bicarbonate species adsorbed as a function of Sn wt % loading on Al2O3 (Sn wt %) after CO2 exposure at 120 °C. The band at 1655 cm–1 is tracked to determine peak areas for bicarbonate species as an Sn loading function (Figure S5b). The normalized peak area is calculated from the relative peak area normalized concerning the IR peak areas obtained from Al2O3–S at 120 °C. The catalysts were pretreated in a 1 mol % H2S stream at 600 °C. The line is to guide the eye.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Top view of (a) partially hydrated (6 OH/nm2) 110 surface of γ-Al2O3 with an Sn atom (Sn/Al2O3), (b) partially hydrated (6 OH/nm2) 110 surface of S-incorporated γ-Al2O3 with an Sn atom (which is likely found in Sn–Al2O3–S), (c) Sn/Al2O3 defect site (zoomed in) akin to that proposed by Wischert et al. (26) on the 110 surface of γ-alumina, and (d) defect site in (c) occupied now by Sn. In (a,b), the unit cell boundary is shown in black. In (a–d), Al atoms are shown in blue, Sn atoms are shown in purple, O atoms are shown in red, S atoms are shown in yellow, and H atoms are shown in white. The Al atom corresponding to the defect site, referred to as AlIII for simplicity, is shown in orange in (a–d). The location of the defect site is marked by a solid (open defect site) or dashed (defect occupied by Sn) black oval. (e) Variation of the fraction of μ1-AlIV hydroxyl interacting with an Sn atom in Sn/Al2O3 and Sn/Al2O3–S. The experimentally probed region is marked by a yellow box for visual guidance. (f) Potential energy diagram of C3H8 dehydrogenation on the 110 facet of the Al2O3 catalyst with a single Sn atom per unit cell. The highest transition state (TS) is 2.28 eV corresponding to the H–H recombination (the second step in the cycle). The symbol “|” represents infinite separation. “*” refers to the adsorbed species. The “defect” here refers to a Wischert-like structure exposing AlIII–OII sites. (26) Sn atoms are shown in purple, Al atoms are shown in blue, oxygen atoms are shown in red, carbon atoms are shown in brown, and hydrogen atoms are shown in white.

Figure 5. Rate of C3H8 consumption and C3H6 selectivity for (a) Al2O3–S (triangles), (b) 1.5Sn/Al2O3–S (circles), (c) 5Sn/Al2O3–S (barverts), and (d) 10Sn/Al2O3–S (rectangles) with time on stream with varying H2S in the feed. The reference feed contained 1.1% C3H8, H2 (1%), and H2S (0.1%) with the balance N2, T = 560 °C, total flow rate = 50 mL min–1 (color-coded─black). The partial pressure of H2S (0.1–0.4%) was varied, while keeping other reaction conditions constant. The catalyst was pretreated in 1% H2S at 600 °C for 4 h. Solid triangles represent the reaction rate, while empty triangles represent C3H6 selectivity. In all the panels, the rate of C3H8 consumption and selectivity to C3H6 are presented.
