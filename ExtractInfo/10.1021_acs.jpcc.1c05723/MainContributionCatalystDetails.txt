Based on the provided documents, there does not appear to be any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation catalysts, mechanisms, or process improvements. The documents focus on the characterization of muoniated cyclohexadienyl radicals formed from the interaction of muonium atoms with benzene and gold nanoparticles on silica supports. This work does not seem directly related to converting propane to propylene via oxidative or non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation. Since the documents do not contain pertinent details, I have indicated "No" relevance in the XML output.
