Hydrothermal synthesis of core-shell ZSM-5/SAPO-34 composite zeolites and catalytic performance in methanol-to-aromatics reaction
A series of core-shell ZSM-5/SAPO-34 composite catalysts with different molar ratios were synthesized using hydrothermal method, and their catalytic performance was tested for the conversion of methanol-to-aromatics. The catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, SEM, NH3-TPD and N2 adsorption-desorption analysis. The results showed that pristine SAPO-34 showed much lower selectivity to aromatics due to its narrow cage structure and lower acid sites. However, with increasing ZSM-5/SAPO-34M ratio, composite zeolite showed higher selectivity to aromatics. As the molar ratio was up to two, the selectivity to aromatics was even higher than that of pristine ZSM-5, indicating that core-shell composite zeolites with hierarchical structure and moderate acid sites were favored for methanol to aromatics. Meanwhile the optimum reaction condition for high yield of aromatics is determined to be 450 °C and 1.5 h−1(WHSV).
1. Introduction
Aromatics like benzene, toluene, and xylene (abbreviated as BTX) are important raw materials in chemical industry, and are widely used in polyester bers, medicines, and dyes. In the past two decades, the route of converting methanol to aromatics (MTA) has received intensive attention considering that methanol is easily available from wide resources such as coal, natural gas and biomasses [1], [2].
ZSM-5 zeolite, as a shape selective catalyst, has been extensively applied in the fields of MTA process. It exhibits both higher catalytic activity and remarkable selectivity to aromatics. However, the catalytic performance is usually alleviated significantly by the rapid deactivation of catalysts due to the diffusion limitation of the intermediate products with a large size in zeolite channels [3]. In addition, the formation of coking associated with carbon deposition, which may lead to the covering of active sites on the external surface [4]. Therefore, considerable effort has been devoted to develop suitable catalysts with moderate acidic strength and good mechanical stability to combine both advantages and to avoid both disadvantages of micro and nanocrystals. Recent progress has been demonstrated that the fabrication of composite zeolites has been paid particular attention in the fields of catalysis due to the acidic properties of external surface of zeolites, and that diffusion efficiency on the pore channel can be altered in a desired way. The composite zeolite with binary structure could not only combine the advantages of the two individual zeolites but also create the special catalytic properties e.g., nanoarchitectures, alterable compositions and crystal sizes in catalytic reactions [5], [6], [7], [8]. Besides, it is noteworthy that composite zeolites have desirable acidity, which is favorable to enhance the synergism between Bronsted and Lewis acids. Some composite zeolites have been developed as the catalysts for fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [9] and methanol to olefin (MTO) [10] and so forth. The preparation of these composite zeolites significantly affected their catalytic performance. Duan et al. [11] prepared HZSM-5/SAPO-34 composites using hydrothermal synthesis and the catalysts showed higher selectivity to propylene, due to their moderate concentration and strength distribution of acid sites. ZSM-5/SAPO-5 composite zeolites synthesized by overgrowing SAPO-5 on the crystal surface of ZSM-5 have shown a higher propylene yield and conversion of heavy oil, and a striking decrease in the number of surface active sites [12]. Fan et al. [13] found that the composite catalyst ZSM-5/SAPO-11 yielded improved gasoline octane number, high liquid yield, good desulfurization activity and lower coke amount due to the synergetic effect between Bronsted and Lewis acids.
Compared with ZSM-5, SAPO-34 exhibits higher performance in methanol-to-olefin reactions owing to its characteristic chabazite (CHA) topology and small 8-ring pore opening, as well as mild acidity. In addition, the creation of micro-mesoporous SAPO-34 is an effective approach to design high performance of zeolitic molecular sieve material with a CHA framework structure [14], which has been intensively investigated on the separation of CO2/CH4 [15] or CO2/N2 [16] and as a catalyst for MTO reaction [17], [18], [19]. High selectivity to ethene and propene has been achieved due to its moderate acid strength and relatively small pore opening [20].
All these research works encourage us to investigate the catalytic performance of composite zeolites for methanol to aromatics. In this work, the preparation of ZSM-5/SAPO-34 composites was based on the fact that SAPO-34 was firstly selected as the shell to precatalyze the reactant methanol to dimethyl ether, the intermediate, and then transfer through ZSM-5 phase to produce aromatics with high selectivity. Additionally, the physicochemical properties of these catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), N2 isothermal adsorption-desorption, temperature-programmed and desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD).
2. Experimental
2.1. Samples Preparation
ZSM-5 was prepared as follows: first, 2.7 g of NaOH was dissolved in 25 ml of tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (25%), together with water and aluminum isopropoxide, 52 ml of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) were added to this solution. The preparation of ZSM-5 material resulted in a molar ratio of Al2O3:SiO2: TPAOH: Na2O:H2O = 1:50:10:7.11:2500. The suspension obtained was maintained under mechanical agitation for 2 h at room temperature. Then the mixture was heated at 120 °C and kept for 72 h in hydrothermal vessel. The solid obtained by centrifugation was washed with deionized water and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The sample was then calcined at 550 °C for 5 h. Ion exchange was performed using 1 M solution of NH4NO3 at 80 °C for 4 h by two consecutive similar processes. After the ion exchange, the zeolite was filtered and washed with enough de-ionized water and after that dried in oven at 100 °C overnight, the NH3-ZSM-5 was calcined in the static air at 450 °C for 3 h to obtain H-ZSM-5.
SAPO-34 was prepared as follows: first, 14.8 g of triethanolamine (TEA) was dissolved in 42 ml of water. 20 g of iso-Al(OC3H7)3 and 11 g of H3PO4 was added to this solution. Then TEOS were added to this solution. The preparation of SAPO-34 material resulted in a molar ratio of P2O5: Al2O3: SiO2: TEA: H2O = 1:1:0.6:2:100 (molar ratio). The suspension obtained was maintained under mechanical agitation for 2 h at room temperature. Then the mixture was heated at 120 °C and kept for 72 h in hydrothermal vessel. The solid obtained by centrifugation was washed with deionized water and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The sample was then calcined at 550 °C for 5 h to obtain SAPO-34.
For synthesis of series ZSM-5/SAPO-34 composite, ZSM-5 was first synthesized from synthetic gel composition Al2O3: SiO2: TPAOH: Na2O: H2O= 1:50:10: 7.11: 2500 (molar ratio). Hydrothermal crystallization of the synthetic gel was carried out at 100 °C and kept for 72 h. The solid obtained by centrifugation was washed with deionized water and then dried at 60 °C for 12 h. The sample was then calcined at 550 °C for 5 h to obtain Na-ZSM-5. Meanwhile SAPO-34 gels with molar composition P2O5:Al2O3:SiO2: TEA: H2O = 1:1:0.6:2:100 (molar ratio) were also prepared. Then the synthesized ZSM-5 powder and SAPO-34 gels with molar composition in the same autoclave. The second crystallization of the mixture of ZSM-5 powder and SAPO-34 synthetic gel with different molar ratio of ZSM-5/SAPO-34 (0.5, 1, 2) was carried out at 120 °C and kept for 72 h, respectively. After crystallization, as-synthesized samples were obtained by filtration, washing and drying at 110 °C for 10 h. Finally, calcination was carried out at 550 °C for 5 h to remove organic template.
2.2. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a Bruker B5005 diffractometer using Cu Ka radiation.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on Hitachi S-4800 microscope. Samples were coated with a layer of gold using an Edwards S150A sputter coater, to make them conductive prior to imaging.
The textural properties of supports and catalysts were determined by nitrogen adsorption, carried out at − 204 °C, in a Micromeritics equipment. The surface area was calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The pore size distribution and micropore volume were determined by Density functional theory (DFT) method. The mesopore volume was calculated using Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method.
Si/Al ratio of zeolite was measured by Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) (Spectro Ciros CCD ICP optical emission spectrometer with axial plasma viewing).
Temperature programmed desorption of ammonia was performed with a Chem TPD instrument (Quantachrome). Approximately 80 mg catalyst was activated for 1 h at 500 °C heating with a ramp of 10 °C/min. After cooling to 200 °C, pure ammonia (99.98%) was passed through the sample. The desorption of the ammonia was accomplished by purging helium (99.999%) with a flow of 20 ml/min and raising the temperature to 800 °C. Total acidity of the catalyst which may correspond to Brønsted and Lewis sites was measured by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
For MTA process, gas-phase methanol conversion was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor. Typically, 0.1 g catalyst in the center of a quartz reactor was activated under a 100 cm3 min−1 N2 flow at 550 °C for 2 h. Methanol vapor diluted in a 45 cm3 min−1 N2 flow was fed into the reactor at temperatures ranging from 673 °C to 500 °C under atmospheric pressure. Weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was kept at 1.5 h−1. The reactor was equipped with an online Shimadzu GC-14B gas chromatograph (GC) where hydrocarbons were separated in a HP-PLOT Q column and analyzed by a flame ionization detector (FID). First analysis of the products was performed 10 min after the start of the reaction. Later on, reaction products were analyzed every 30 min. Methanol conversion was defined as the amount consumed divided by the amount fed to the reactor. Selectivity was calculated on the carbon mass basis of the effluent from the reactor, and the values are expressed as carbon percent.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of composite catalysts
Fig. 1 showed XRD patterns of ZSM-5/SAPO-34 catalysts, SAPO-34 and ZSM-5 as references were also showed. Diffraction peaks of ZSM-5 (2θ° =7.8, 8.7, 22.9, 23.8, 24.2°) and SAPO-34 (2θ° = 9.6, 16.5, 20.7, 25.9, 31.5°) were found over ZSM-5/SAPO-34 catalysts suggesting that the binary structure of ZSM-5/SAPO-34 catalysts could be prepared by hydrothermal method. With increasing molar ratio of ZSM-5 precursor versus SAPO-34 gels, the intensity of diffraction peak for CHA over ZSM-5/SAPO-34 composites was relatively weaker than that of pristine SAPO-34 crystal, while the intensity of MFI gradually increased. Additionally, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 27° belonging to ɑ-SiO2 over ZS-0.5 catalyst and ZS-2 catalyst were presented probably due to Si extraction from the core of ZSM-5 crystal nucleus leading to the aggregation of silica species in alkaline solutions.

Fig. 2 shows SEM images of zeolites prepared with different ZSM-5/SAPO-34M ratios. In case of SAPO-34 (Fig. 2a), a morphology with cubic crystals of 2–3 µm with typical CHA structure was dominantly observed. Cubic or hexagonal columnar crystals with MFI structure were observed over ZSM-5 (Fig. 2b). All of them exhibited regular morphology. With increasing molar ratio of ZSM-5/SAPO-34 in the preparation procedure, the morphologies of zeolites became less homogeneous. Some complete SAPO-34 crystals still kept over ZS-0.5 sample while there were no typical crystal morphology of ZSM-5 being observed (Fig. 2c), which was suggested that a shell of SAPO-34 formation began to appear on the surface of ZSM-5, and ZSM-5 further grew into core phase until it was entirely covered by SAPO-34 shell. As the molar ratio of ZSM-5/SAPO-34 was 1 over ZS-1 (Fig. 2d), new core-shell structure was observed resulting from the formation of petal-like morphology of SAPO-34. With the molar ratio of ZSM-5/SAPO-34 increased to 2 (Fig. 2e), the amount of petal-like SAPO-34 particles increased continuously and the particles wrapped on the core of ZSM-5. This suggested that SAPO-34 precursors were gradually formed on the surface of ZSM-5 and core-shell structures were subsequently fabricated. On the basis of SEM images, the possible formation mechanism for these composites is proposed. The incompatibility of the core and the shell with different structures can be circumvented by partially dissolution of ZSM-5 cores for the growth of SAPO-34 in the shell [21]. As the synthesized ZSM-5 powder and SAPO-34 gels were mixed, the second crystallization proceeded. The aluminosilicate surface of ZSM-5 crystals might be attacked and decomposed or even disordered aluminosilicate species in alkaline solutions. The low stability of the ZSM-5 framework can provide nutrients for the growth of SAPO-34. Besides such nucleation center on the surface of ZSM-5 crystals, the other nucleation center for the growth of SAPO-34 crystals is SAPO-34 gels. Both of them are responsible for the formation of ZSM-5/SAPO-34 composites [22]. Considering the formation of SAPO-34 shell, the tiny nucleated particles comprising SAPO-34 firstly adsorb and deposit on the external surface of ZSM-5 crystals. Secondly, the nucleated particles begin growing because of the interaction between aluminum species in the solution and silicon species, resulting in the formation of SAPO-34 crystalline shell around ZSM-5 particles [23].

N2 physisorption isotherms of all zeolites showed in Fig. 3. The adsorption-desorption isotherms of ZSM-5 and SAPO-34 without hysteresis loop were a typically type-I isotherm, elucidating the presence of micropores. However, for composite zeolites, different isotherms were showed, indicating that the composite zeolites possessed distinct pore structure compared with ZSM-5 and SAPO-34. The filling of micropores was finished to p/p° = 0.4, indicating the existence of micropores. The second sharp increased in the N2 adsorption isotherm at near p/p° = 0.4–0.95 indicated the capillary condensation due to the presence of mesopores. The mesoporosity of composites might be induced by interspaces among different crystals, especially, the seed composite might have a lot of interspaces, which gave rise to large hysteresis loop in N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm. Meanwhile, mesopores in composite zeolites could also be produced by the extraction of silicon and aluminum species from ZSM-5 zeolite cores [23], [24], [25]. Fig. 4 displayed the pore size distribution of samples. We can note that hierarchical zeolites showed a bimodal distribution with narrow micropores and mesopores around 0.4–0.9 nm and 3–4 nm, respectively. With increasing ZSM-5/SAPO-34M ratio, mesopore size increased. However, pristine ZSM-5 or pristine SAPO-34 did not show mesopore size distributions and the corresponding micropore size distributions were present in Fig. 4. The results of textural properties of catalysts were shown in Table 1. The specific BET surface area and micropore volume of ZSM-5 were 412 m2/g and 0.26 cm3/g, respectively, with lower contribution to mesopores from intrinsic ZSM-5, only 0.09 cm3/g, respectively. In contrast, ZSM-5/SAPO-34 composites possessed lower micropore volumes but more mesopores. An increase on the surface areas and mesopores were observed with the increase of ZSM-5M ratios over composite zeolites. As a consequence, the highest surface area and the largest mesopore volume were found over ZS-2 catalyst. The decrease of micropore area and volume in ZSM-5/SAPO-34 composites resulted from the dissolution and partial amorphization of the starting zeolite framework [24], [25]. The dissolution of ZSM-5 resulted in the breakdown of some micropores. The presence of mesopores would effectively interconnect the micropores to offer additional diffusional paths which were of great benefit for catalysis as a whole. These cavities might be served as transport paths for bulky compounds such as intermediate carbocations to alleviate the limitations in catalytic reactions.

The surface acidic properties of the catalysts were investigated. The curves of NH3-TPD for samples were showed in Fig. 5. Two NH3 desorption peaks were observed for all samples. The lower-temperature peak centered at 170–300 °C could be assigned to the adsorption of ammonia on weak acid sites [26]. A broad higher-temperature peak centered at 330–500 °C, which could be attributed to the adsorption of ammonia on the strong acid sites, was observed. In case of composite zeolites, adjustable acids were observed because of the tunable ratios of ZSM-5/SAPO-34. With increasing ZSM-5/SAPO-34M ratio, the peaks corresponding to whether the strong acid or the weak acid shifted toward higher temperature. The number of acid sites expressed as mmol NH3/g with respect to only weak and strong acidic sites was showed in Table 1. Apparently, SAPO-34 has the lowest acid sites, in particular the strong acid sites, while ZSM-5 has the highest acid sites. The area of NH3 desorption peaks for strong acidic sites was observed to be higher than that for weak acidic sites. It is reported that weak acid sites in zeolites favored the production of light olefins while surface methoxy-groups formed via transferring hydrogen protons (H+) released from Brønsted acid to methanol, which was favored to rearrange to aromatics [27]. Moreover, their areas for strong acidic sites decreased in the following order: SAPO-34<ZS-0.5<ZS-1<ZS-2<ZSM-5. Strong acid sites were preferentially transformed and/or neutralized during the synthesis procedure owing to the formation of the interface after the incorporation of SAPO-34 to the ZSM-5 structure. Therefore, with decreasing ZSM-5/SAPO-34M ratio, strong acidic sites decreased.

3.2. Catalytic performance of composite catalysts
Catalytic performance of all prepared samples were carried out in a micro-reactor for methanol to aromatic. The results of methanol conversion over different catalysts at the temperature of 450 °C and WHSV of 1.5 h−1 in the time range of 3–24 h are presented in Fig. 6. Nearly 100% methanol conversion was observed over these catalysts containing ZSM-5 structures in the initial stage. Similar results were confirmed by other researchers. Wang et al. [28] observed that ZSM-5 /SAPO-34 composites exhibited a high methanol conversion (>97%) at the initial stage. Meanwhile, the catalytic stability of the SAPO-34/ZSM-5 composites was remarkable enhanced. Wang et al. [29] synthesized core-shell ZSM-5@meso-SAPO-34 composites. Methanol conversion approached 100% at the initial and decreased after the reaction of 15 h. Cao et al. [30] found that SAPO-34/ZSM-5 composites exhibited shorter induction period (0.5 h). The initial methanol conversion could reach 96.6% and showed a decline within 26 h of testing time. In case of SAPO-34, it exhibited relatively low methanol conversion and the shortest lifetime (less than 4 h), and methanol conversion rapidly decreased with time on stream, probably owing to the deposition of coke species in smaller cavities. While ZSM-5 showed higher methanol conversion and the highest stability. This result should be related to the two-dimensional channel structure of ZSM-5 (MFI) with the channel intersections providing enough volume which minimized the diffusion restrictions. Especially, all composites performed better than SAPO-34. It is acknowledged that acidity pattern, topology and pore structure of zeolites significantly affect subsequent catalytic performance. Composite zeolites showed better catalytic activity and stability than SAPO-34 attributing to the great effects of combined MFI and CHA frameworks and proper micro and mesopores ratio in distinct pore structure. With increasing ZSM-5/SAPO-34M ratio, composite catalysts showed better stability, indicating that hierarchical structure played an important role. Nevertheless, the activities of all the composite catalysts decreased rapidly within 12 h. The reasons might be attributed to two aspects. One is that the acid sites was necessary to convert methanol to aromatics, but much strong acidity might lead to coke deposition and fast deactivation of the catalyst. Therefore, in order to gain the high catalytic stability, it is appropriate that the catalyst had the moderate concentration and strength distribution of acid sites [31]. The other is that hierarchical porous structure of composite zeolites in the reaction condition might collapse due to an effect of water vapor produced. The water deactivated the catalyst by dealumination resulting in lower hydrothermal stability [32], [33]. In order to further study the catalytic properties of these composite zeolites, the catalysts were reused. Before reuse, the regeneration of used catalysts was carried out at 550 °C in flowing air for 5 h to remove species on the surface. The catalytic performance was then tested. It was observed that ZSM-5 recovered its activity and selectivity after being regenerated while composite zeolites did not maintain their activity and selectivity when re-used indicating that the stability of these catalysts should be further improved. Meanwhile the textural properties of the fresh and the used ZS-2 catalyst were compared. It was found that specific surface area dropped considerably after the reaction. The loss of specific surface area came from the blockage of micropores and mesopores resulting in the deterioration of pore properties.

Fig. 6. Methanol conversion of time on stream over the synthesized composite zeolites, ZSM-5 and SAPO-34.
The product distributions of methanol conversion over these zeolites are shown in Table 2. SAPO-34 showed an extremely low selectivity for aromatics due to its narrow cage structure (CHA) to favorably convert methanol to olefins. While ZSM-5 exhibited a greatly higher selectivity of 30.0 wt% to BTX, indicating that the structure of MFI can be favorable for cyclization reactions and intermolecular hydride transfer reactions by which a mixture of olefins can be converted into alkanes and aromatics. Therefore it was reasonable that the selectivity of aromatics was obviously enhanced with the increase of ZSM-5/SAPO-34M ratio. However, it should be mentioned that the selectivity to BTX over ZS-2 catalyst reached 34.3 wt% and was the highest among those catalysts. This result should be related to the presence of suitable amounts of SAPO-34 in core-shell structure which was beneficial for the formation of aromatics. The direct connection between cores and shells over ZSM-5/SAPO-34 composite zeolites led to the fabrication of hierarchical porous structure and such channel intersections played a significant role in circumventing the inherent diffusion limitation and hindering the formation of C9+ hydrocarbons, thus the formation of aromatics were promoted.

In order to further study the products of aromatics evolution in MTA process, the experiments were carried out in different temperatures and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV). The effect of WHSV (1.5 h−1, 4 h−1, 6 h−1) on the formation of BTX was investigated (Fig. 7). The selectivity of BTX was observed to decrease gradually with increasing WHSV for each catalyst. At higher WHSV, the contact time of catalysts with gaseous reactants or intermediates was shortened. There was not enough time for light olefins, such as ethene, propene, to form aromatics in a consecutive reaction. As a result, the reaction process was shortened for those intermediate species resulting in the products containing more olefins. While methanol stayed on the catalyst bed for a longer time at lower WHSV, methylation reactions occurred, and thus the selectivity of the products such as C5+ hydrocarbons containing aromatics increased. Based on the results, 1.5 h−1 was therefore chosen as an optimum WHSV for high selectivity to BTX. Moreover, the same trend of BTX selectivity over all these catalysts was observed. The highest selectivity to BTX was obtained over ZS-2 catalyst at WHSV = 1.5 h−1.

The effect of the temperatures (400 °C, 420 °C, 450 °C, 470 °C, 500 °C) on BTX selectivity was also tested at WHSV = 1.5 h−1 (Fig. 8). As we observed that product distributions at different temperatures displayed distinct behaviors. The selectivity to BTX slightly increased in the initial stage, and then decreased at higher temperature. This volcano-type trend with the temperature suggested that the reaction pathways might be diverse. When the temperature was lower, the selectivity to BTX was lower. This was because the low temperature was not fully adequate for methanol conversion but only dehydration to dimethyl ether (DME) [34]. Then DME formed light olefins. Increasing temperature gradually promoted the hydride transfer reaction to produce more paraffins or aromatics as products, and subsequently resulting in an increase of BTX [35]. As the temperature was further increased to 500 °C, the selectivity to C5+ molecules decreased. At elevated temperatures, cracking of heavier hydrocarbons was induced. Hence, high temperature provided appropriate conditions for obtaining optimum light olefin selectivity and hindering the formation of heavy hydrocarbons such as aromatics [36]. Therefore, 450 °C was determined to be the optimum temperature for BTX production.

4. Conclusions
A set of composite zeolites were prepared with different ZSM-5/SAPO-34 M ratios and their applications were investigated in the MTA reaction at various reaction conditions. It was found that BTX selectivity depended on ZSM-5/SAPO-34M ratios. pristine SAPO-34 showed much lower selectivity to aromatics due to its CHA structure and lower acid sites. The highest selectivity of BTX was obtained over core-shell ZSM-5/SAPO-34 catalyst with molar ratio of 2 due to hierarchical structure and moderate acid sites. With increasing the temperature, the catalysts exhibited volcano-type trend of selectivity to BTX, indicating that the relative rate between oligomerization and cracking of higher hydrocarbons could be adjusted to obtain the highest aromatics at suitable reaction conditions. Moreover, combination composite catalysts with low space velocity (1.5 h−1) of methanol was effective to get high yield of aromatics under the temperature of 450 °C.

Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
