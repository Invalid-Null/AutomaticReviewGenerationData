 Based on the provided documents, it appears none of them are relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation research. Each document focuses on the conversion of methanol to aromatics using composite zeolite catalysts, with no mention of propane or propylene production.

Since the documents do not pertain to propane dehydrogenation, I have indicated "No" for relevance in the XML output:
