The document discusses propane dehydrogenation and the conversion of propane to propylene. However, it does not provide sufficient details on the catalyst performance to extract the requested information. The document focuses on the method of ultrafast encapsulation to synthesize the Pt/Sn-ZSM-5 catalyst rather than evaluating its catalytic performance. While some catalytic testing results are presented, details such as propane conversion, propylene selectivity, stability, deactivation rates, propane production rate, propylene yield, and other key metrics are not reported. Therefore, I cannot provide the requested information per the instructions.
