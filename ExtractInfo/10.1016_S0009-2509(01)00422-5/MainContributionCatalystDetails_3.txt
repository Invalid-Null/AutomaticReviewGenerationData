 Based on the provided document, this does not seem directly related to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) to convert propane to propylene. The document discusses a novel reverse flow reactor concept for highly endothermic gas phase reactions coupled with exothermic reactions, using propane dehydrogenation and methane combustion as an example reaction system. However, it does not go into details about a specific catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The focus seems to be more on reactor design and modeling rather than catalyst advancements for PDH or ODH.
