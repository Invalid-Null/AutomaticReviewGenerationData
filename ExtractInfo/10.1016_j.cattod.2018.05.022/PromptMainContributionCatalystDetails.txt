1. Introduction
The issue of propylene shortage is gradually emerging, probably due to the shifting of the raw materials for steam cracking toward ethane and other natural gas liquid feedstocks. Propane dehydrogenation has been proposed as a promising technology for addressing the propylene shortage [1,2]. The shale gas revolution in North America has already transformed natural gas market, leading to a significant drop in natural gas prices. Thus, propane recovery from liquefied natural gas can serve as a source of propane with high added value. Numerous olefin producers are considerably interested in developing propane dehydrogenation through propylene routes. Several propane dehydrogenation processes, such as Oleflex and Catofin, have been successfully commercialized. There are two types of catalysts developed and patented for this reaction, including chromia-based catalysts and, more recently, supported platinum catalysts [[3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]]. Supported platinum catalysts are widely used in catalytic dehydrogenation for their high selectivity and stability [[8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]]. Chlorinated platinum precursors have been conventionally used for the preparation of these catalysts, according to the previously acquired knowledge in the preparation of hydrogenation and reforming catalysts. Supported Pt-Sn catalysts are often prepared from Cl-containing precursors, such as SnCl2 or SnCl4. Paulis et al. [14] found that the mobility of chlorine is responsible for altered reaction stability of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts by systematically studying the effect of chlorine on the properties of these catalysts. Arteaga et al. [15] investigated the catalyst regeneration over Pt/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/Al2O3 with and without chlorine in detail and concluded that the presence of both Sn and Cl exerts additional effects on reduced catalysts. Despite the wide availability of studies discuss the effects of chlorine, however, these effects have rarely been reported in nonoxidative reaction, particularly in the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. The use of chlorinated platinum precursors for dehydrogenation reaction has raised several issues because of residual chlorine [[16], [17], [18], [19], [20]]. Catalytic characteristics, including structural information, acidity, and available active sites, are also influenced by the residual chlorine; thus, chlorine elimination from propane dehydrogenation catalysts is a significant endeavor. However, as far as the authors are concerned, the effect of chlorine elimination from the catalyst on the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has not been reported. Chlorine features on Pt-based catalysts produced by the different treatments may result in variant behaviors that may significantly affect catalytic performance.
While chlorine deposited on alumina is removed fairly readily under gas stream, temperatures greater than 500 °C may be required for chlorine removal because of the formation of relatively stable MOxCly species with platinum, especially Pt-Sn catalyst for dehydrogenation reaction. In the present work, in order to select an optimum treatment condition, relatively severe dechlorinated procedures were carried out, and Pt-Sn-K/Al2O3 catalysts prepared mainly by changing the catalyst treatment temperature. The properties of catalysts investigated via several techniques, including nitrogen adsorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and temperature-programmed reduction (TPR). Changes in Pt active phases in the Pt-Sn-K/Al2O3 catalyst as a function of temperature were studied, and the results were correlated with a corresponding catalytic reaction and coking rate. A strong correlation between the structure of Pt active phase and the behavior of hydrocarbon reconstruction in propane dehydrogenation was demonstrated. The new model of the influence of chlorine elimination on interactions between Pt and SnOx was described. The results of this work can help future researchers select appropriate conditions for chlorine elimination from Pt-Sn-K/Al2O3 catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Pt-Sn-K catalyst preparation
Pt-Sn/Al2O3 samples were prepared by co-impregnation method. Before the impregnation step, the 88.30 g of commercial γ-Al2O3 support (Sasol Germany GmbH) was calcined in air at 680 °C for 4 h. Subsequently, the support was impregnated using a hydrochloric acid solution of 2.10 g of H2PtCl6·6H2O (Shenyang Chemical Co) and 1.67 g of SnCl2·2H2O (Tianjin Chemical Co). The nominal compositions of the catalyst were 0.7 wt% Pt and 1.0 wt% Sn. After impregnation, the samples were dried at 120 °C for 4 h, calcined in air for 4 h at 540 °C, and then dechlorinated in steam at different temperature. Thereafter, the samples by routine chlorine elimination treatment was added to a water solution of 2.10 g of KNO3 (Tianjin Chemical Co). Finally, Pt-Sn-K/Al2O3 catalysts were obtained by calcination of the as-impregnated Pt-Sn/Al2O3 chlorine elimination samples in air for 4 h at 540 °C.
2.2. Chlorine elimination treatment
Chlorine elimination from the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 samples was performed in a constructed reactor. The samples were heated up to 520, 540, 560, 580 and 600 °C,respectively, under an air-steam mixture flow with a flow rate of 60 mL/min. The samples were kept at the designated temperature for 6 h and then cooled to ambient temperature prior to reaction. Finally, the samples were dried at 120 °C for 4 h. The different chlorine elimination samples at 520, 540, 560, 580 and 600 °C used in the Pt-Sn-K/Al2O3 catalysts were denoted as D520, D540, D560, D580 and D600, respectively. The fresh sample used in Pt-Sn-K/Al2O3 catalyst was labeled as F.
2.3. Characterization
The properties of catalysts were characterized by several techniques. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the different samples were collected on a D/max-2500 X-ray diffractometer using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 80 mA over an angular 2θ ranging from 10° to 70°. Nitrogen physisorption data were obtained on an ASAP 2420 instrument at 77 K to examine the porous properties of each sample. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were performed on a JEOL 2010 F microscope operated at 200 kV. NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) was carried out using 120 mg of samples and with Ar flowing at a rate of 40 ml/min (STP) as the carrier gas. Thermoconductivity was recorded as the response to NH3. Particles of 60- to 80- mesh were calcined at 550 °C for 2 h in situ, cooled to 120 °C, and then saturated with ammonia for 30 min. NH3-TPD curves were obtained from 120 °C to 600 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Elemental content was obtained by XRF measurements on a ZSX100e XRF system. Hydrogen chemisorption experiments were performed using a Micromeritics TPR/TPD 2900 system. Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was determined using H2/Ar (10%) flowing at a rate of 50 mL/min (STP) as the reducing gas. The heating rate in the TPR experiment was 10 °C/min up to 700 °C. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts were obtained on a AXIS ULTRADLD using Al Kα radiation. Binding energies (BE) were calibrated using the C1s level at 284.8 eV as an internal standard. Coking was determined using an element measurement instrument. Raman spectral curves were obtained on a Renishaw in Via Reflex instrument. The composition of the catalysts in the reactor was monitored by an Agilent 7890 N GC with a HP-PONA methyl siloxane capillary column and a flame ionization detector.
2.4. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation reaction
Propane dehydrogenation was carried out in a conventional quartz tubular microreactor with the reaction temperature of 620 °C at 0.1 MPa. H2/C3 molar ratio was 0.5, and propane weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) was 4.0 h−1. The reaction products were analyzed by an online GC system (Agilent 7890 A). Propane conversion and alkenes selectivity were defined as follows:
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the samples
XRD patterns of different catalysts samples are showed in Fig. 1. As can be observed from the figure, there are three typical peaks of pure Al2O3, the fresh catalyst, at around 37.5°, 46.0° and 67.5°, respectively. Catalysts that had been dechlorinated at different temperatures presented structures similar to that of the fresh catalyst, which suggests that the original structure of the catalyst was retained during chlorine elimination. After chlorine elimination at different temperatures, changes in the corresponding peak widths are observed which implies the increase of Al2O3 crystal particle size. That is, Pt particles located on the external surface of the Al2O3 catalyst are highly likely to change during chlorine elimination. Meanwhile, the XRD patterns also confirm that Pt and Sn contents in all the samples were very small and bulky Pt and Sn species were not present.

BET surface areas and pore volumes of different catalysts samples are presented in Table 1. It is apparent that F sample possessed the largest BET surface area compared with the samples after chlorine elimination. Meantime, BET surface area kept on decreasing with the increase of treatment temperature. The surface area of D600 decreased by approximately 21.7% compared with that of F sample. Changes in BET surface areas are believed to be related to the physicochemical properties modification of Al2O3 through chlorine elimination. As the chlorine elimination temperature ascended, the total pore volume also declined slightly; however, the pore diameters of the samples showed a rising tendency. These findings indicate that chlorine elimination can also evidently affect the porous properties of the catalyst.

Elemental contents were obtained by XRF measurement, and the corresponding chlorine contents of different catalysts are shown in Table 2. The XRF data demonstrate that the chlorine contents evidently decreased with the increase of chlorine elimination temperature. However, there was no apparent change in chlorine content when the temperature reached 560 °C. This result shows that the skeleton Cl contents remained constant after the chlorine elimination temperature was increased to 580 °C. The relatively more stable MOxCly species with platinum were difficult to be eliminated.

Catalyst acidity may be significantly affected by variations in chlorine elimination temperature. NH3–TPD and NH3 uptake results of the different catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table 3, respectively. An ammonia desorption peak assigned to weak acid sites may be observed in F at low temperature. Virtually no ammonia desorption was observed at high temperature, which suggests that the addition of promoter preferentially neutralize the strong acid sites [21]. After chlorine elimination, all of the samples exhibited similar TPD profiles. With the increasing chlorine elimination temperature, the acidity of the samples obviously decreased (Table 3) and the acid intensities of the weak acid center weakened, as evidenced by the ammonia desorption temperature moving toward the lower range. When the chlorine elimination temperature was increased to 560 °C, a slight decrease in the acidity of the samples showed up. Arteaga et al. also found that the presence of chlorine could increase the acidity of the support [15]. The data in Table 3 provide the evidence that supports this viewpoint. Introduction of chlorine is an essential approach to acidify the support surface and promote Pt dispersion in many industrial reforming catalysts [22,23]. Sachtler [23] also assumed the formation of a surface complex from a promoter, support, and Cl that could alter the acidic function of the catalyst. Therefore, chlorine elimination treatment in reverse also significantly affects multiple characterisics of the catalysts, the type of Pt active phases, even the behavior of hydrocarbon reconstruction.

Chlorine elimination can exert evident impacts on the characteristics of Pt active sites. H2 uptake rates of the different samples are presented in Table 4. The amount of adsorbed H2 dropped down as the chlorine elimination temperature increased. This tendency became more evident at higher chlorine elimination temperature range, which suggests that certain interactions occur between Pt and SnOx. Lin et al. [24] reported that Pt could be located on SnOx modified carrier surfaces to form new active sites with a “sandwich structure,” which favors the dehydronation reaction. In the present case, interactions between Pt and SnOx slightly weakened, and the surface characteristics of active sites changed. These findings demonstrate that chlorine elimination can significantly alter the characteristics of Pt active sites and induce a significant degree of Pt particle sintering. The results have been further confirmed by H2-TPR experiment.

Fig. 3 shows the H2-TPR profiles of the different samples. The samples present two peaks at about 200 °C and 400 °C, respectively. These peaks may be conventionally ascribed to PtO2 reduction, which suggests that tow Pt species exist on the external surface of the catalyst. These Pt species may be produced by different interactions between Pt and SnOx. The reduction temperature of Pt species apparently shifted toward the higher values with the increase of chlorine elimination temperature, which is most likely due to the strong interactions between several Pt particles and the support. Interestingly, the area of higher temperature peaks sharply decreased after chlorine elimination, which indicates that chlorine elimination evidently impacts on the reduction behaviors of Pt and Sn species. This trend became more distinct with the increase of chlorine elimination temperature. Sn loss was inevitable during the chlorine elimination process, which suggests that interactions between Pt and SnOx species were destroyed. The results have been further verified by XPS experiment.

XPS spectra of the Sn 3d level of the samples of the chlorine elimination were measured and are presented in Fig. 4. More interestingly, the peaks area of the Sn2+ and Sn4+ of Sn 3d5/2 showed pronounced differences among the F, D560 and D600 samples. The peak area of the Sn2+ becomes smaller with the increase of chlorine elimination temperature, until it is disappeared in D600. This observation implies that Pt and Sn species are evidently impacted on by chlorine elimination. In other words, the strong PtO2-SnOx-support interaction are destroyed. This findings is consistent with the H2-TPR data discussed above.

Besides, Chlorine elimination further showed evident effects on the Pt particle size, that is Pt active phases. Fig. 5 shows the Pt particle sizes and their size distributions of all chlorine elimination samples. The size distributions were obtained by the Nano Measurer 1.2. That is to say, the average sizes of Pt particles were calculated about 100 randomly distributed particles by several TEM images in each sample. The results indicate that the particles of F and D520 were well distributed and with an average size of ∼2.0 nm; by contrast, the Pt particle sizes obtained were relatively large with an average size of ∼3.0 nm at chlorine elimination temperature of 540 °C. As the chlorine elimination temperature increased, the average sizes of Pt particles grew to ∼5.0 nm and ∼7.0 nm. These suggest that chlorine elimination impacts the dispersive status of Pt particles on the external surface of the catalyst and that chlorine elimination at high temperatures promotes the sintering of Pt particles. Traxel et al [25] found that addition of chlorine results in doubling of Pt dispersion. These explain from one side of the problem why chlorine elimination made a difference to the dispersive status of Pt particles.

3.2. The analysis of the behavior of hydrocarbon reconstruction
3.2.1. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation performance
The catalytic properties of different catalysts for propane dehydrogenation at 620 °C are shown in Fig. 6. Initial C3H8 conversion values correspond to the analysis of reaction products after 5 min on stream. As shown in Fig. 6, F exhibited the highest initial C3H8 conversion. The sequence of the initial C3H8 conversion rates was F > D520 > D540 > D560 > D580 > D600. Although the initial activity of F and D520 was high, their reaction stability was poor. After reacting for 6 h, their propane conversion dropped from 44.87% and 36.3% to 26.32% and 26.85% respectively. The reaction stability with poor performance on D580 and D600 due to changes of the Pt active phases. By contrast, the initial selectivity to C3H6 showed an increasing trend with the growth of chlorine elimination temperature. This change trend became insignificant at a chlorine elimination temperature of 580 °C. Initial selectivity of the catalysts toward C3H6 followed the sequence D600 > D580 > D560 > D540 > D520 > F. D540 (34.35% activity, 90.3% selectivity) and D560 (33.96% activity, 90.94% selectivity) showed the better yields compared with the others samples. The maximum yield (about 31.01%) was obtained from D540. Thus, the optimum chlorine elimination temperature is 540 °C. These findings suggest that D540 achieved a good coordination between Pt particles size in the catalyst of D540 and the behavior of hydrocarbon reconstruction.

Different sizes of Pt particles in catalysts can result in the variations of the surface site heterogeneity of Pt atoms. When the size of Pt particles is small, their surface site heterogeneity varies greatly. The surface of smaller particles is mostly terminated by steps and edges, where Pt atoms are highly coordinately unsaturated. Conversely, the surface of larger particles is mainly terminated by terraces and planes, where Pt atoms are relatively less coordinately unsaturated [[26], [27], [28]]. On the basis of DFT calculations, that smaller Pt particles containing more step sites are much more active but less selective than larger particles in propane dehydrogenation. For large particles, the activity of the catalyst is dominated by the Pt(100) and Pt(111) surfaces. The Pt(100) and Pt(111) surfaces show lower activity to propane dehydrogenation and higher selectivity towards propylene than the small particles, but the Pt(100) surfaces show higher conversion of propane and higher production of cracking products than the Pt(111) surfaces[29]. Therefore, the activity and selectivity of the samples varied according to Pt particles size, which is influenced by the chlorine elimination temperature.
Generally speaking, the decrease in initial C3H6 selectivity on small Pt particles may be explained by the rearrangement or modification of Pt sites in the catalysts as well as the changes in catalyst acidity. Changes in catalytic acidity may influence catalytic performance. F and D520 which have relatively high Cl contents are highly acidic and therefore capable of higher conversion. Increased acidity, could also promote side reactions, which reduce the selectivity of the catalyst toward propene. In this case, the coke produced may cover active sites, resulting in rapid deactivation.
The data of the acid amount in Table 3 are similar as to D540, D560, D580 and D600 samples, which indicates the effects of the acid amount were excluded. The activity to propane dehydrogenation and selectivity towards propylene were affected by the Pt particles size. That is, the chlorine elimination significantly affects the type of Pt active phases, thereby the behavior of hydrocarbon reconstruction.
3.2.2. Coke analysis of the different catalysts
Table 5 lists the coke contents and the coking rate obtained from D540, D560, D580 and D600 at 620 °C after 24 h on stream. It is found that the hydrogen-deficient of the coke over catalysts at 620 °C was more apparent with decreasing chlorine elimination temperature as in Table 5. Fig. 7 also displays the Raman profiles of these catalysts. The catalysts showed equally weak acidity; thus, the effect of acidity on the coke formation could safely be excluded. As the chlorine elimination temperature went up, the carbon contents and the coking rate gradually decreased, which means chlorine elimination favors the improved action of coke. Afonso et al. [30] reported that olefins are primary precursors of the coke formation mechanism. According to this mechanism, the type of Pt active phases has a significant influences on coke formation. As shown in Fig.7, the catalysts displayed two distinct peaks indexed as D and G; these peaks characterize the degree of the graphitization of coke. The intensity ratio of the D and G peaks (ID/IG) has been employed as an effective method for determining the degree of graphitization of coke [31,32]. As ID/IG increased, the degree of coke graphitization over catalysts became lower. What is more, it was lowered with increasing chlorine elimination temperature as in Fig. 7. That is to say, the degree of coke graphitization approximates the type of Pt active phases.

The smaller size of Pt particles may induce the higher degree of coke graphitization. These results indicate that small Pt particles promote CC bond activation, whereas relatively large Pt particles are more selective for C–H bond activation [33]. The most significant effect of the Pt active phase is the action of coke during the reaction, including selectivity, the ratio of H and C in the coke, the degree of coke graphitization, and so on. These findings provide a rational interpretation of the recent experimental observations that smaller Pt particles containing more step sites are much more active but less selective than larger particles in propane dehydrogenation.
3.3. Model describing the influence of chlorine elimination on interactions between Pt and SnOx
According to the results discussed above, a new model describing the influence of chlorine elimination on interactions between Pt and SnOx is proposed and illustrated

Fig. 8. Model describing for the influence of the chlorine elimination from catalysts on the interactions between Pt and SnOx.
In F, Pt particles are highly dispersed on the surface of SnOx and external surface of Al2O3. Some Sn is deposited over the external surface of Al2O3 and some Pt particles directly anchor to the Al2O3 surface. These anchored particles contribute to side reactions such as hydroisomerization and cracking, among others. Other Pt particles anchor on the surface of SnOx, which is highly active C–H bonding and the main active site for the propane dehydrogenation [26,33]. After chlorine elimination, the Pt particles aggregate and grow in size, which implies that the interactions between Pt and SnOx become weak at higher treatment temperature. After severe chlorine elimination, certain amounts of Sn species detach from secondary sites, destroy the sandwich structure, and form directly anchored Pt sites. Relatively severe treatment temperatures can also significantly change the surface characteristic of Pt active sites. In other words, chlorine elimination destroys interactions between Pt and SnOx, which is unfavorable for the dehydrogenation reaction.
4. Conclusions
Chlorine elimination from Pt-Sn catalyst is a crucial process to consider when designing a rational catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Chlorine elimination had evident impacts on the multiple characteristics of the catalysts, such as acidity, specific surface area, pore volume, the type of Pt active phases, etc. Chlorine elimination also influenced the behavior of hydrocarbon reconstruction in propane dehydrogenation and demonstrated a crucial function in determining selectivity as evidenced by coking experiments. It is an optimum progress that the chlorine elimination conditions of the Pt active phases centered on the Pt(100) surfaces and the PtSnK/Al2O3 exhibited the best catalytic performance and a low coking rate. Finally, a new model was established to describe the influence of chlorine elimination on the interactions between Pt and SnOx.
