 Unfortunately the provided documents do not seem to contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation research. The documents focus on the hydrogenation of propyne to propene and do not discuss converting propane to propylene via propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. Since there are no relevant extractions, I am unable to provide an integrated summary.
