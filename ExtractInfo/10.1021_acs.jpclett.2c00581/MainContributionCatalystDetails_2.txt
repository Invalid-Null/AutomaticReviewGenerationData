The abstract discusses using encapsulated Pt-Sn intermetallic nanoparticles to catalyze the hydrogenation of propyne to propene with high pairwise selectivity for parahydrogen enhanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). It does not mention propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation to convert propane to propylene. Therefore, this document does not seem directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation.
