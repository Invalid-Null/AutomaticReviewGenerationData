Direct transformation of butenes or ethylene into propylene by cascade catalytic reactions
This perspective focuses on the production of propylene from n-butenes or ethylene only in catalytic cascade reactions. The studies reviewed here demonstrated that in a single reactor, two or more of these reactions, including at least one metathesis step, can be activated by multifunctional catalytic systems. Special attention has been paid to heterogeneous catalysts able to work without activators or co-catalysts and to their behaviour in these processes.

1. Introduction
With an annual worldwide capacity of about 100 million tons, propylene is one of the most important chemical intermediates for producing polymers and other end-use chemicals. In addition to ethylene and butenes, propylene is currently produced from fossil sources, principally by steam cracking of saturated hydrocarbons and catalytic cracking of oil fractions.1,2 Although the ratios between C2, C3 and C4 olefins can somewhat be controlled by cracking severity, this control is rarely adequate to accommodate the demands of the marketplace. As a result, processes involving olefin interchangeability are commonly operated in the petrochemical industry. However, owing to the strong demand for polypropylene during the last few years (an average annual demand growth of 4.5%), there is concern that the supply of propylene from its traditional sources will not be sufficient to keep pace with the demand. Therefore, there is increasing interest and need to find or develop alternative routes to propylene, based on accessible raw materials and technologies.3–6 Among the alternative methods devoted to the production of propylene, the most relevant on the industrial scale seem to be: (i) propane dehydrogenation, (ii) methanol conversion and (iii) ethylene–butene metathesis.
Commercial propane dehydrogenation processes have been available for several decades but they have been of less interest because of the large amount of cheap propylene produced by catalytic cracking. The high growth rate in the demand for propylene and improvements in catalysis have motivated their re-examination.7–9 The propane dehydrogenation process is offered by UOP, ABB Lummus, Linde/BASF, Snamprogetti/Yarsintez, and Krupp Uhde.2
The conversion of methanol (produced via syngas from non-oil resources such as natural gas, coal and biomass) over zeolite/zeotype catalysts is one of the most promising applications able to produce light olefins.10 Methanol to olefins (MTO) and methanol to propylene (MTP) processes have been developed by Exxon Mobil, UOP/Hydro, Lurgi and Sinopec.2,11 The Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics has developed an MTO technology that led to the successful construction and operation of the world's first coal to olefin plant in 2010.12
Metathesis is a reversible reaction developed in the 1970s as Olefin Conversion Technology (OCT®) licensed by ABB Lumnus to produce propylene from ethylene and butenes over a supported W catalyst. Since then, a number of technologies based on OCT® and W, Re and Mo-based catalysts have been developed by other companies, such as BASF & Atofina, Mitsui Chemicals, BP Chemical, Sinopec & Shanghai Petrochemical Processes.13–16
Most of these alternative technologies use non-renewable fossil sources for propylene production. These sources will inevitably face the problem of their reserves becoming less and less, and their final depletion is predictable. Additionally, the growing awareness of the detrimental environmental effects related to the use of fossil resources has stimulated interest in alternative routes for the production of light olefins based on renewable resources.
Various methods for converting renewable feedstocks into light olefins via both (thermo)chemical and biochemical routes have been developed in the past decades. The most promising results were obtained in the production of ethylene and n-butenes from bioethanol and biobutanol, respectively.
Bioethanol is efficiently produced in mature technologies from various bio-resources, and today, most of the ethanol on the market is biomass-derived.17,18 According to the IEA (International Energy Agency), ethanol production could reach 145 billion liters in 2023.
Biobutanol can be produced through various methods, including the direct transformation of bioethanol through the Guerbet process19 and the fermentation of lignocellulosic, starchy and microalgal biomass.20–25 Genetic engineering techniques are used to modify organisms to increase the yield of butanol.
Concerning (bio)propylene, it can be obtained from bio-chemically produced 1-propanol or 2-propanol via fermentation processes.26 Some results have been obtained, but these applications are not yet mature technologies. To circumvent this problem, propylene could be produced from bio-based ethylene and butenes. A valuable process could be based on the metathesis reaction of an equimolar mixture of ethylene and 2-butene. The metathesis of light olefins is a well-known application and it was extensively examined in previous studies and reviews.13–16
Over the last decade, new and simplified routes for converting ethylene or butenes into propylene have been investigated. The approach is to produce propylene using ethylene or n-butene as a single reagent in catalytic cascade one-pot processes (Fig. 1).
Fig. 1 Routes for converting ethylene or n-butenes into propylene.
This review focuses on the production of propylene from ethylene or n-butenes without addition of other hydrocarbons. The multifunctional heterogeneous catalysts able to work without activators or co-catalysts in catalytic cascade processes have been mainly taken into account.
2. Catalytic cascade reactions
Nowadays, catalysis represents an available and effective tool for achieving sustainable chemical processes through process intensification. For example, using appropriate catalysts, chemical processes that involve several reaction steps with intermediate product separation and purification can be replaced by cascade-type processes. These chemical transformations are known as tandem, domino, or cascade reactions27,28 and have become an important research topic in organic chemistry and petrochemistry.29–34 For developing such applications, various multisite heterogeneous catalysts have been proposed.
Based on literature data, we demonstrate here that it is possible to design complex heterogeneous catalytic systems, able to activate in a single reactor two or more reactions, including at least one metathesis step. Such chemical pathways are shown in Fig. 1. They consist of two or three cascade reactions, catalyzed by a multifunctional catalyst or by two catalysts, as schematically shown in Fig. 2a and b, respectively. Typically, in a single flow reactor and under identical conditions, substrate A is transformed over the first catalyst (or site) into substrate B, which then reacts with the excess of substrate A over the second catalyst (site) to obtain the main product. According to Fogg and dos Santos, this is a typical “orthogonal-tandem catalysis”.27

Representative literature data on catalytic systems and their behavior in cascade processes including ethylene to propylene (ETP), 1-butene to propylene (1-BTP) and 2-butene to propylene (2-BTP) are examined below.
3. Ethylene to propylene
The conversion of ethylene to propylene without any addition of other hydrocarbons can be achieved in two main ways: ethylene conversion by dimerization/isomerization/metathesis and ethylene conversion by oligomerization/cracking steps (Fig. 3). Typically, process (a) is promoted by transition metal-based catalysts, while process (b) is catalyzed by acidic catalysts, like zeolites and SAPOs.
Fig. 3 Routes for converting ethylene into propylene over transition metal-based catalysts (a) and acidic catalysts (b).
3.1. Ethylene to propylene with transition metal-based catalysts
This process consists of three consecutive steps: (i) dimerization of ethylene to 1-butene, (ii) isomerization of 1-butene to 2-butene and (iii) metathesis reaction of 2-butene with unreacted ethylene to propylene. Propylene is also produced in the butene cross-metathesis reaction.

The ETP process can be schematized as shown in Fig. 4. Each step requires a specific catalytic site and proceeds according to a different mechanism.
Fig. 4 Conversion of ethylene to propylene in catalytic cascade processes.
Several catalytic systems and strategies were proposed for propylene production using only ethylene as a raw material. The first ones used at least a homogeneous catalyst. Lyondell Petrochemical Co. developed in the 1980s a two-step process for the production of propylene, using ethylene from ethane-cracking technology. In the presence of a homogeneous nickel catalyst, some ethylene is dimerized to 2-butene, which is reacted in a second step with the rest of the ethylene over a W/SiO2 catalyst to produce propylene.13 Pillai et al.35 produced propylene from ethylene in a batch reactor by sequential use of homogeneous catalysts, Ni(acac)2–Et3Al2Cl3 as a dimerization–isomerization catalyst and WCl6–Et3Al2Cl3 as a metathesis catalyst.
During the last decade, a number of research groups have studied the direct conversion of ethylene to propylene in continuous processes, using multisite heterogeneous catalysts.
3.1.1. Multifunctional Ni-mesoporous catalysts Iwamoto and co-workers studied the ETP process using Ni-template-ion exchanged (TIE) mesoporous silica MCM-41 as catalysts.36 Initially, they considered that the three reactions described in Fig. 4 are catalyzed by Ni ions, acidic sites and Ni3+ carbene, respectively. Working at very low reactant feed rates (0.1–0.2 LC2H4 h−1 gcatal−1), ethylene was converted into propylene, but only at temperatures higher than 350 °C. The yield of propylene was lower than 30%. Using EXAFS, FT-IR and TPR techniques, the authors found that the local structures of the nickel species supported on the TIE samples were very similar to that of 2 : 1 nickel phyllosilicate. These structures were suggested to be the active species for the metathesis step.37–40
The unprecedented behaviour of Ni-based materials as “metathesis” catalysts reported by Iwamoto has attracted the interest of other research laboratories. The Seidel-Morgenstern and Hinrichsen groups reported that Ni–MCM-41 and Ni–MCM-48 catalysts prepared by TIE, equilibrium adsorption or wetness impregnation catalyzed the conversion of ethylene to propylene.41–43 The catalytic activity increased when aluminium was incorporated into the mesoporous matrix. The Ni phyllosilicate layered structure was supposed to be the catalytically active phase for the dimerization and metathesis steps of the reaction.44
However, further experimental investigations performed by the Seidel-Morgenstern group on the metathesis of ethylene and cis-/trans-butene over Ni/MCM-41 showed that Ni species are not able to activate the metathesis reactions.45 In consequence, they proposed a new description of the reactions and catalytic sites involved in the ETP process over these materials. At low and intermediate temperatures, the main reaction product is a mixture of butene isomers produced by the dimerization of ethene and the isomerization of 1-butene. At high temperatures, a conjunct polymerization takes place instead of the metathesis of ethylene and 2-butene. This type of polymerization yields a product that is a complex mixture of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons. The complex mixture might consist of the reaction products observed in the ETP reaction, including propylene.
A similar analysis was done by Stoyanova et al.46 They prepared a series of catalysts by incipient wetness impregnation with Ni species of silica–alumina with variable Si/Al ratio. The catalytic behavior of these materials in the ETP process was investigated and compared with that of the Ni–(Al)MCM-41 catalyst. In contrast to the latter catalyst that contains Ni embedded in a layered phyllosilicate structure, the Ni–SiAlOx catalysts contain NiOx particles and highly dispersed NiOx on their surface. Despite the different Ni phases, the catalysts give similar catalytic results. All these results suggest that the Ni species are involved in ethylene oligomerization to form long chain oligomers which are then cracked to lower hydrocarbons, including propylene, by an acid catalyzed process. For this reason, temperatures higher than 350 °C are required for this reaction.
3.1.2. Trifunctional W(H)3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst Basset and co-workers reported the direct transformation of ethylene into propylene over tungsten hydride supported on γ-alumina (W(H)3/Al2O3).47 This system has been considered as a trifunctional single-site catalyst able to catalyze ethylene dimerization, 1-butene isomerization, and ethylene/2-butene cross-metathesis. A sequential mechanism of the global process is proposed in this study (Fig. 5). First, the catalytic tungsten–ethyl–ethylidene species are formed in two elementary steps, displayed in eqn (1).
Fig. 5 Elementary steps in ethylene conversion over the (W(H)3/Al2O3) catalyst.
The formed catalytic species {W}(CH2CH3)(CHCH3) can insert ethylene into the ethyl moiety to form 1-butene as the main product (eqn (2)). 2-Butenes are formed after reinsertion of 1-butene and β-H elimination (eqn (3)). Propylene is formed subsequently, in a simple metathesis process involving the newly formed carbene-type complex (eqn (4)).
At 150 °C and at a VHSV of 260 h−1, the selectivity to propylene was higher than 95%, but the ethylene conversion dropped rapidly from 40% to 10%. The initial conversion rate was 0.68 molC2H2 molW−1 min−1, before reaching a pseudo-plateau of 0.1 molC2H2 molW−1 min−1, with an overall TON of 1120 after 120 h on stream.
3.1.3. Bimetallic multifunctional NiSO4/Re2O7/γ-Al2O3 catalyst NiSO4/γ-Al2O3 is known to be an effective catalyst for ethylene dimerization,48,49 while Re2O7 is a well-known metathesis catalyst.50,51 Li et al. combined these catalytic abilities in a single bimetallic supported catalyst, NiSO4/Re2O7/γ-Al2O3.52 This multifunctional material catalyzed the direct conversion of ethylene to propylene under mild reaction conditions (50 °C, 1 bar, GHSV of 2682 h−1). Most probably, the catalyst functions worked independently for dimerization/isomerization (NiSO4) and metathesis (Re2O7). The yield of propylene was lower than 30%, and the catalytic system rapidly deactivated. Analogous multicomponent catalysts (MeO/Re2O7/B2O3–Al2O3, MePd or Ni) for the one-stage ETP process were described later by Buluchevskii et al.53 Working at 80 °C and 0.1–1 MPa, the experimental yield of propylene reached more than 80% of the theoretical one. More recently, Ghashghaee and Farzaneh proposed a nanostructured Ru–Ba–K–MgO–Al2O3 catalyst, able to convert ethylene into propylene and butenes at 70 °C and 1 atm. The initial ethylene conversion and propylene selectivity were 87% and 65%, respectively. The deactivation of the catalyst was very pronounced even after 20 minutes on stream.54 In summary, using a single catalyst having different chemical species together is an interesting concept, but it is very difficult to efficiently balance the catalytic functions involved in the ETP process. 3.1.4. ETP over two catalysts in a single reactor Andrei et al. reported an original method based on two robust, stable in air, and highly active heterogeneous catalysts.55,56 In a single flow reactor and under identical conditions, ethylene was selectively dimerized/isomerized over the Ni–AlSBA-15 or Ni–AlSiO2 catalyst to form 2-butenes, which then reacted with the excess of ethylene over MoO3–SiO2–Al2O3 to produce propylene (according to Fig. 4). The dimerization/isomerization of the Ni–AlSBA-15 catalyst was carried out according to a multi-step original procedure, schematically described in Fig. 6.57
Fig. 6 General protocol for preparing the Ni–AlSBA-15 catalyst.57
At 80 °C and 3 MPa, the average conversion of ethylene was 40% leading to specific activities up to 48 mmol of propylene per gram of catalyst per hour, with a selectivity of 90% for propylene and butenes, but with a majority of 2-butenes (20% for 1-C4 and 80% for 2-C4).55
Recently, the same group proposed a new and more efficient heterogeneous catalytic system including Ni–AlKIT-6 and ReOx/γ-Al2O3.58 KIT-6 is an ideal support combining a high surface area and large interconnected mesopores with a homogeneous mesopore size distribution, which is a key parameter for high mass transfer properties.59 ReOx/γ-Al2O3 is a metathesis catalyst able to work at low temperature.50,51
Under identical mild conditions (60 °C, 3 MPa), in a single continuous flow reactor, without the use of a co-catalyst, ethylene was very selectively converted into propylene and 1-butene. The initial ethylene conversion was 73% and stabilized at 35% after 4 h on stream, with around 45% selectivity to propylene and 42% selectivity to 1-butene. The selectivity for 1-butene was 97.4% in the C4 fraction (Fig. 7).
Fig. 7 Typical chromatogram for ethylene conversion over Ni–AlKIT-6 + ReOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts; all products are unsaturated hydrocarbons.58
For this process, it was suggested that two ethylene molecules coordinated to a nickel ion on Ni–AlKIT-6 react to form 1-butene; some of them migrate to acid sites to isomerize into cis/trans-2-butene. Over the second catalyst, ReOx/γ-Al2O3, the cross-metathesis between the excess of ethylene and butenes occurs (according to Fig. 8). The couple ethylene/(cis/trans-2-butene) gives propylene (eqn (5)), while ethylene/1-butene undergoes a symmetrical reaction leading to 1-butene and ethylene (eqn (6)). Propylene is also formed in the metathesis reaction between 1- and 2-butenes (eqn (7)).
Fig. 8 Metathesis reaction pathways.58
Based on their own experimental results and those in the literature, the authors proposed a general mechanism for the ETP process (Fig. 9).55
Fig. 9 Possible mechanism for the conversion of ethylene to propylene in a catalytic cascade process (OSO2− surface oxide ions).55
Two molecules of ethylene coordinated to a nickel ion react by oxidative coupling to form a metallacyclopentane intermediate, which then forms 1-butene by β-hydride transfer. When the desorbed 1-butene migrates to an acid site, it is easily converted to an internal double-bond olefin. The cross-metathesis of ethylene and 2-butenes over the MoO3–SiO2–Al2O3 catalyst most likely involved the initial formation of carbene species (MoCHR, RH or alkyl)50 followed by the formation of metallacyclobutane intermediates, as proposed in Chauvin's reaction mechanism.60,61
To compare the catalytic systems used in the ETP processes described above, Table 1 shows the representative results, such as ethylene conversion and specific activity in propylene and 1-butene formation.

Coupling distinct ethylene oligomerization catalysts with metathesis catalysts seems to be the best strategy. These catalysts work under mild conditions, with very good propylene yields.
3.2. Ethylene to propylene with acidic catalysts
Ethylene can be also directly converted into propylene over solid acidic catalysts. Typically, the reactions occur at temperatures higher than 400 °C. Although most microporous and mesoporous materials (zeolites, SAPOs, and MCM-41) showed interesting properties in this process,2,5,6,62–65 the best catalysts are microporous molecular sieves, in particular those with CHA and MFI topologies.62,66–68
All the steps involved in the ETP process are acid catalyzed reactions and besides propylene, light hydrocarbons and aromatics also form in significant quantities. As shown in the simplified reaction pathways in Fig. 10,66 initially oligomers are formed from ethylene involving a carbenium ion mechanism. The second step is the fission of a carbon–carbon bond in the β-position of the hexyl carbenium ion (2) and/or the 4-methyl-2-pentyl carbenium ion (4). The secondary carbenium ion (4) is formed in the latter reaction involving the tertiary carbenium ion of (3).
Fig. 10 Simplified mechanism of the acid catalyzed ETP process.4
In a more elaborated study, Dai et al.67 investigated the mechanism of the ETP process using a H-SSZ-13 acid catalyst (an aluminosilicate analogue of SAPO-34). In situ FT-IR, UV/Vis, GC-MS, TGA and 1H MAS NMR measurements showed that ethylene was rapidly oligomerized and converted into naphthalene-based carbenium ions. These species played a significant role in the ETP reaction. However, the accumulation of these species leads to the formation of polycyclic aromatics, which are responsible for a total blocking of H-SSZ-13 pores.
The reaction mechanism described below justifies why the formation rate of propylene, as well as the deactivation rate of the catalyst crucially depends on the acid strength and the pore size of catalysts.68,69Table 2 summarizes representative catalytic results in the ETP process with acidic catalysts.

ZSM-5 zeolite, having strong acid sites and medium pore size (0.55 nm), exhibited high catalytic activity, but only moderate selectivity to propylene.62,67,69 In contrast, SAPO-34, with chabazite cages connected via 8-ring windows (0.38 nm) and moderate strength of acidic protons, showed higher selectivity to propylene.62,64,67,68 The high selectivity is attributed to the shape selectivity effect of the small pores.
Ghashghaee and Shirvani studied the ETP process in the presence of an original Ca-containing composite.70 The catalytic performances were superior to those exhibited by the benchmark samples HSAPO-5 and HZSM-5. Thus, a propylene yield of 34.6% was obtained at 500 °C. This excellent behavior was attributed to a good compromise between the strength and the amount of acidic sites and the appropriate porosity of the composite material.
Lee et al.65 reported that H-UZM-35, a large-pore zeolite, shows much better deactivation stability than H-SSZ-13. The key to this behavior is the presence of large cylindrical cages (0.64 × 0.65 × 1.18 nm) in H-UZM-35 that allow the easy formation of alkylnaphthalene-based reaction centers for ETP catalysis, while being relatively resistant to coke formation.
In a more detailed study, Sarazen et al.71 investigated the effects of the channel connectivity, void environment, and acid strength on the relative rates of oligomerization, β-scission, and isomerization reactions during light olefin conversion, including ethylene, propylene, and isobutene. A number of microporous (TON, MFI, MOR, BEA, and FAU) and mesoporous (amorphous silica–alumina, MCM-41, and Keggin POMs) Brønsted acids with a broad range of confining voids and acid strength were examined. The experimental findings indicated that oligomerization selectivities are dependent on the size, shape, and connectivity of the framework, because of how such structural features influence the diffusion of the largest products that can form within the local confining environment.
In order to improve the catalyst behavior, particularly the catalyst lifetime, some research groups doped the zeolites with K, P, and B,62,64 or steamed them at high temperature.72
To conclude, the acid catalysed ETP may be considered as a promising process mainly because it is based on zeolite-type catalysts, which are robust and commercial materials. However, compared to the transition metal-based catalysts described above, the acid catalysts show some weaknesses. They are efficient only at high temperatures (400–550 °C) and suffer from rapid deactivation by coking. The selectivity to propylene is not so high, and thus large amounts of C1–C4 hydrocarbons are formed as by-products.
3.3. Overview on the ETP catalytic systems

4. Butenes to propylene (BTP)
The conversion of 1- or 2-butene through tandem reactions mediated by multifunctional catalysts is another promising way to produce propylene. These processes have been recently investigated by several research groups. Two successive reactions are involved in the process: n-butene isomerization and cross-metathesis (Fig. 11). In all studies, only one bi-functional supported catalyst was used.
Fig. 11 Catalytic steps for the conversion of n-butenes into propylene.
Besides the reactions described in Fig. 11, other reactions (isomerization, metathesis, and oligomerization), involving reagents and products, occur (Fig. 12). The selectivity/yield of propylene is strongly impacted by these reactions, which can be controlled by the catalyst and the reaction conditions.
Fig. 12 Parallel/consecutive reactions involved in the n-butene metathesis process.
As shown in Table 4, a number of catalytic systems were designed for propylene production using only n-butenes as raw-materials. Representative results obtained under the most favorable conditions are summarized in this table. Details about the catalysts and processes will be given below.

4.1. 1-Butene to propylene
Most of the catalysts used in 1-BTP processes contained W-species and an acidic porous support.
4.1.1. 1-BTP over a tungsten hydride catalyst (W–H/Al2O3) As described above, the Taoufik–Basset group developed a tungsten hydride catalyst, (W(H)3/Al2O3), which was able to convert ethylene into propylene.47 This multifunctional catalyst has been also evaluated for n-butene conversion into propylene and pentene.73
The authors suggested that two active moieties (CH2 = W–H) were initially generated in situ at the initiation steps by insertion of 1-butene on the tungsten hydride precursor W–H/Al2O3, followed by α-H and β-H abstraction. The formed catalyst operated through 1-butene isomerization on W–hydride and 1-butene/2-butene cross-metathesis on W-carbene (Fig. 13).73

1-Butene can undergo self-metathesis to produce ethylene and 3-hexene and ethylene may undergo cross metathesis with 2-butene. The process has been carried out in a continuous flow reactor at 150 °C and different pressures. Over W–H/Al2O3 (5.5 wt% W), the selectivity to propylene varied from 55% to 45% during 22 h on stream. The other products were n-pentenes, n-hexenes and ethylene, with 32, 14 and 9% selectivity, respectively. The productivity varied from 64.8 mmolC3H6 gcata−1 h−1 to 27.7 mmolC3H6 gcata−1 h−1 in time and the overall turnover number was 5450 after 22 h on stream.
4.1.2. 1-BTP over WO3-based catalysts One of the earlier studies on the BTP process was reported by Wang et al.74 They prepared by impregnation a series of tungsten oxides supported on silica, WO3/SiO2. It was found that the activity of these materials in 1-butene metathesis was dependent on the states of tungsten oxide species. Thus, the tetrahedrally coordinated tungsten oxide species were suggested to be the active sites. Over the best catalyst, the 1-butene conversion was higher than 90%, the metathesis selectivity reached 64 mol% and the propylene yield was 32.6%.
Superior behavior in terms of activity and metathesis selectivity has been reported by the same group with a W-substituted mesoporous SBA-15 catalyst, synthesized by a one-step co-condensation sol–gel method.75,76 Working at 350 °C, 0.5 MPa and WHSV = 0.72 h−1, with pure 1-butene, no significant change of the catalytic results was observed during 40 h on stream. The high dispersibility of tungsten oxide species, strong interaction between tungsten oxide species and silica and the mesoporous structure of the catalyst have been defined as critical factors leading to the excellent catalytic behavior.
Recently, Chen et al. prepared a series of SBA-15-supported WO3 catalysts by impregnating silicotungstic acid on SBA-15 (HSiW-SBA-15) and subsequently calcining at different temperatures.77 These catalytic materials showed higher activity and stability than the physical mixtures of SBA-15 and WO3 in the self-metathesis of 1-butene to propylene. The best results in terms of activity, selectivity and stability were shown by the catalyst sample calcined at 700 °C. Within 72 h on stream, at 350 °C, the 1-butene conversion slightly decreased from 60% to 54%, while the propylene selectivity and 2-butene/1-butene ratio remained about 60% and 1.7, respectively. The Si–O–W–OH Brønsted acid sites seemed to play a decisive role in the formation of W-carbene species, responsible for the metathesis reaction.
Liu et al. also reported that the metathesis activity is influenced both by the Brønsted acidity of the catalytic support and the state of tungsten oxide species.78 They prepared original WO3/Al2O3–HY (10% W) catalysts with different HY contents, which were tested in 1-butene conversion into propylene and pentene. At 180 °C, 0.1 MPa, WHSV = 1.5 h−1 and 5 h on stream, the propylene yield varied from 9.8 to 24.5% when the HY content increased from 10 to 70 wt% in the mixture with γ-Al2O3. The 1-butene conversion was higher than 93% for all the catalyst samples. The deactivation rate of the catalysts was low only during the first 10 h on stream. The authors suggested that the incorporation of the HY zeolite in the catalyst support affected the Brønsted acidity of the catalyst, the metal–support interaction and tungsten active sites, which are responsible for the metathesis activity and catalyst stability.
Harmse et al. studied 1-butene metathesis at 450 °C over 8 wt% tungsten catalysts supported on silica, silica–alumina and γ-Al2O3.79 Low conversion (<18%) and olefin selectivity were obtained with the WO3/Al2O3 catalyst. In contrast, WO3/SiO2 and WO3/SiO2–Al2O3 exhibited excellent behavior: butene conversion of 68–69% and propylene selectivity of about 30% (Table 4). Surprisingly, relatively large selectivities to iso-butene and C7+ hydrocarbons were observed, especially over the WO3/Al2O3 catalyst.
Tungsten oxide is a very efficient catalyst, frequently used in metathesis processes involving light olefins, as described here above. Molybdenum oxide is also a well-known catalyst for such reactions. Huang et al. studied the 1-BTP process in the presence of MoO3/mordenite–alumina catalysts.80 Typically, in metathesis reactions, MoO3 works at lower temperature than WO3, but the deactivation rate is higher for MoO3. To improve the catalyst stability, MoO3/HM–Al2O3 was treated by nitric acid leaching at room temperature. Structural transformations were observed due to the extraction of Al2(MoO4)3 species, which were suggested to be responsible for coke species formation. The best results for 1-butene metathesis were obtained with the catalytic material treated for 24 h with nitric acid. At 150 °C, 0.1 MPa, WHSV = 1.5 h−1 and TOS = 1 h, the yield of propylene was 24.4%, while that of pentenes, hexenes and ethylene was 18.5, 6.8 and 2.5, respectively. After an initial plateau, the propylene yield continuously decreased over time, reaching 14% at 50 h on stream.
4.2. 2-Butene to propylene
Mazoyer et al. reported an efficient heterogeneous catalytic system to produce propylene from trans-2-butene.81 This reaction is catalyzed by a “bifunctional single site” WH3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and proceeds in two steps: (i) trans-2-butene isomerization to 1-butene by a tungsten hydride moiety and (ii) cross-metathesis between 1-butene and 2-butenes on the tungsten carbene site to form propylene and 2-pentene. The global process can be described in catalytic cycles analogous to those described in Fig. 13 for 1-butene conversion into propylene. In a continuous flow reactor, using trans-2-butene as a reagent, at 150 °C, 0.1 MPa and VHSV = 5200 h−1, the conversion rate was 4.9 molC4H8 molW−1 min−1 at the start of the reaction before reaching a pseudo plateau of 2.2 molC4H8 molW−1 min−1. The overall turnover number was 14 500 after 90 h on stream. The productivity of propylene was 50.5 mmolC3H6 gcata−1 h−1 after 1 h on stream and 28.2 mmolC3H6 gcata−1 h−1 after 20 h on stream. The product selectivity did not significantly change during 90 h on stream and it remained 52% for propylene, 36.5% for n-pentenes, 9.5% for n-hexenes and 1.5% for ethylene.
Hua et al. studied the conversion of 2-butene into propylene and pentene in the presence of WO3 supported on MTS-9, an ordered mesoporous titanium silicate.82,83 Samples with various WO3 amounts were prepared and thermally reduced with hydrogen at different temperatures. The best results (2-butene conversion of 41.8% and propylene yield of 26.1%) were obtained at 320 °C, with the 12% WO3/MTS-9 catalyst, thermally treated at 400 °C. The catalyst exhibited a constant activity during 45 h on stream.82 More recently, the same group prepared a series of WO3-based catalysts using MCM-48, MCM-41 and SiO2 as supports.84 The 2-butene conversion, measured at 300 °C, 0.8 MPa and WHSV = 6.4 h−1, increased as follows: WO3/SiO2 (29%) < WO3/MCM-41 (45%) < WO3/MCM-48 (48%). The catalytic activity was related to the WO3 dispersity and the acidity of the catalyst/support, which were highest for MCM-48. The highest yield of propylene (23.7%) was also obtained in the presence of 16 wt% WO3/MCM-48.
A systematic study on 2-butene conversion over WO3 incorporated in the framework of mesoporous MCM-41 and SBA-15 silica has been carried out by Bhuiyan et al.85 These catalysts showed higher performance compared to the catalytic materials prepared by the impregnation of the same supports with WO3 (Table 2). Propylene yields up to 39% were obtained with both WO3–MCM-41 and WO3–SBA-15. This performance was linked to the moderate acidity of supports, as well as to the presence of a high number of tetrahedrally coordinated tungsten oxide species in the materials.
5. Conclusions and outlook
Based on recent research results, this short review shows that sustainable catalytic routes for producing propylene from ethylene or n-butenes only are feasible. A variety of solid multifunctional catalysts able to operate in different cascade processes have been designed. Although factual results have been obtained for each process, they are still in the early stages. An important further research effort is needed in order to obtain the knowledge necessary to implement effective catalysts and processes.
First, it is necessary to accumulate in-depth knowledge on the mechanism of the reactions involved in order to rationalize the active sites required and to design the solid catalyst able to achieve selective multistep processes. For most of the catalysts described in the reviewed references, it is crucial to optimize the balance between the catalytic functions involved in the process. Research on the catalyst life-time and particularly on its regeneration capacity is also essential.
Catalysts based on transition metals other than those described here could open new opportunities. For example, metathesis catalysts containing Mo or Re deserve to be explored.
Studies on the most suitable reactor able to achieve the maximum yield of the catalytic system for the multistep reactions are necessary.
The encouraging results obtained in the catalytic conversion of ethylene into propylene could create the basis for new research projects, where ethylene will be replaced by ethanol. Indeed, ethanol conversion into propylene is an exciting challenge for further research.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
