 Based on the details provided in the abstract and document, this work does not seem directly related to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses the dehydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol, not propane. As such, I cannot extract the requested information about improvements to propane dehydrogenation catalysts, process conditions, etc.
