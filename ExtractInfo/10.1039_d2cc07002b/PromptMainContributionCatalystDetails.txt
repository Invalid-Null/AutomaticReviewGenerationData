Highly efficient Bi-promoted ZrO2-based materials for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation†
Surface or bulk promotion of ZrO2-based catalysts with Bi2O3 facilitates the removal of lattice oxygen from ZrO2 under reductive conditions resulting in the formation of coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations. The catalysts demonstrated an industrially relevant propene yield at 600 °C. The results highlight the importance of the usage of suitable promoters for controlling catalyst performance.
Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the industrial methods for the on-purpose production of propene.1–4 Commercial catalysts applied for this reaction contain either Pt or CrOx active species. Although they demonstrate high activity, propene selectivity and durability, they have severe drawbacks related to the high price of Pt and environmental issues caused by Cr(vi) compounds or the necessity to use Cl2/Cl-containing compounds for the regeneration of the Pt-containing catalysts. Therefore, both academia and industry are motivated to develop alternative catalysts free of such limitations.
In 2015, our group introduced ZrO2-based catalysts, which perform similar to an analogue of commercial K-CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst.5 The dehydrogenation activity of such catalysts was related to the presence of coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ (Zrcus) sites located near to oxygen vacancies.6 The presence and the kind of dopant (Li+,7 Ca2+,7 Mg2+,7 La3+,7,8 Y3+,7,8 Sm3+,7 Cr3+,8,9 Al3+,8 In3+,8 Ga3+,8 Cu2+,10 V3+,11) in the lattice of ZrO2 were demonstrated to strongly influence both catalyst activity and product selectivity. The dopant effect was explained by the formation of oxygen vacancies in ZrO2 and/or ZrO2 lattice distortion. On the one hand, the promoters with oxidation state lower than 4+ cause the formation of structural oxygen vacancies, and therefore “structural” Zrcus sites, due to the charge compensation. On the other hand, lattice distortion and the presence of oxygen vacancies increase the ionic conductivity of ZrO2-based materials facilitating their ability to release lattice oxygen and to create additional “generated” Zrcus sites under reductive conditions. In this regard, bismuth oxide may be an attractive promoter because it enhances the ionic conductivity of the accordingly promoted ZrO2-based solid electrolytes at intermediate (600–800 °C) temperatures.12–14 Substitution of Zr4+ sites by Bi3+ leads to the creation of “structural” oxygen vacancies due to the charge compensation. Moreover, the high polarizability of Bi3+ cations with 6s2 lone pair electrons additionally increases the mobility of lattice oxygen in the lattice of ZrO2, which is important for the formation of “generated” Zrcus sites.
Against the above background, we prepared a family of ZrO2-based catalysts through co-precipitation or impregnation methods to ensure bulk or surface promotion with bismuth oxide. The corresponding catalysts are denoted as ZrBiOx or Bi2O3/LaZrOx. The purpose was to understand how the kind of promotion affects the formation of catalytically active Zrcus sites and product selectivity in the PDH reaction. The actual content of Bi determined in selected samples by ICP does not strongly differ from the theoretical one (Table S1, ESI†). Both tetragonal (t-ZrO2) and monoclinic (m-ZrO2) phases were detected in bare ZrO2 and mixed ZrBiOx (Fig. S1(a), ESI†). The fraction of t-ZrO2 increases with an increase in Bi content due to a stabilizing effect of the dopant. No diffraction reflexes related to separate BiOx-based phase(-s) are present in the patterns of these materials owing to the homogeneous dissolution of bismuth ions within the lattice of ZrO2.15 Independently of the amount of bismuth, the diffractograms of the Bi2O3/LaZrOx samples possess only reflexes related to t-ZrO2, which is also the only phase in bare LaZrOx (Fig. S1(b), ESI†). The absence of the reflexes corresponding to the BiOx phase(-s) is probably due to the low quantity of this promoter and accordingly its high dispersion.
Selected samples were analyzed by XPS to determine the surface concentration and the oxidation state of Bi. For Zr95Bi5Ox and 0.5Bi2O3/LaZrOx, the surface concentration of Bi was 2.6 at% and 0.1 at%, respectively. The XP spectra of the catalysts (Fig. S2, ESI†) exhibit two characteristic peaks at 159.3 and 164.5 eV, corresponding to the core lines of Bi 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 of Bi3+ and two small peaks at lower binding energies (∼157.5 and ∼163 eV), which can be assigned to the lower valence state of Bi due to the existence of oxygen vacancies.16
The specific surface area (SBET) of the ZrBiOx catalysts is in the range of 64–68 m2 g−1, while the SBET value of bare ZrO2 is only 38 m2 g−1 (Table S1, ESI†). Surface promotion of LaZrOx with Bi2O3 also results in an increase in SBET from 83 m2 g−1 to 112–125 m2 g−1. A similar effect was observed for Cr2O3/LaZrOx catalysts investigated in ref. 9 The promoters should hinder the sintering of ZrO2 or LaZrOx crystallites during catalyst precursor calcination.
Bi2O3 also affects the ability of the ZrBiOx and Bi2O3/LaZrOx catalysts to release their lattice oxygen under reductive conditions as proven by temperature-programmed reduction tests with H2 (H2-TPR). Bare ZrO2 demonstrated only small hydrogen consumption above 600 °C (Fig. 1(a)). This is due to hydrogen reaction with the lattice oxygen of zirconia.17 Hydrogen consumption over ZrBiOx samples proceeds at lower temperatures, with the maximal rate being determined at 358 °C. A relatively small consumption also takes place above 420 °C. These reduction processes become more pronounced and the high-temperature H2 consumption shifts to lower temperatures with rising Bi2O3 content due to the enhancement of lattice oxygen mobility in the lattice of ZrO2.
Fig. 1 The H2-TPR profiles of (a) bare ZrO2 and ZrBiOx samples as well as (b) bare LaZrOx and Bi2O3/LaZrOx samples.
The H2-TPR profiles of bare LaZrOx and Bi2O3/LaZrOx are characterized by either one (LaZrOx, 0.1Bi2O3/LaZrOx, and 0.2Bi2O3/LaZrOx,) or two (0.5Bi2O3/LaZrOx, 0.7Bi2O3/LaZrOx, 1Bi2O3/LaZrOx, and 5Bi2O3/LaZrOx) maxima of hydrogen consumption (Fig. 1(b)). The high-temperature catalyst reduction peak at about 737 °C can be ascribed to hydrogen reaction with lattice oxygen of LaZrOx. When Bi2O3 is present on the surface of LaZrOx, the highest rate of H2 consumption shifts to around 520 °C. Another low-temperature consumption peak centred at around 350 °C is present in the H2-TPR profiles of Bi2O3/LaZrOx with Bi loading higher than 0.2 wt%. This can be assigned to the reduction of surface BiOx species.
Prior to PDH tests at 550 °C, the developed catalysts were either oxidized in air flow at 550 °C for 1 hour or oxidized and then reduced in a flow of 57 vol% H2 in N2 at 550, 575, 600, 625 or 650 °C for 1 hour. All oxidized ZrBiOx catalysts demonstrated a lower rate of propene formation (measured after 190 s on stream) in comparison with bare ZrO2 (Fig. 2(a)). For the oxidized Bi2O3/LaZrOx samples, the presence of Bi2O3 on the surface of LaZrOx up to 0.5 wt% only slightly increased the activity, which, however, decreased with a further increase in Bi2O3 content (Fig. 2(b)). Noticeably, all catalysts demonstrated much higher activity after the reductive treatment. The higher the reduction temperature was, the higher the rate of propene formation at 550 °C was. Such behaviour can be explained by the creation of catalytically active Zrcus sites through the removal of oxygen by H2 from the lattice of ZrO2. The positive effect of treatment temperature on the rate of propene formation is more pronounced for Bi-containing catalysts than for bare ZrO2 or LaZrOx. Such results are in good agreement with the H2-TPR data (Fig. 1), which demonstrated higher ability of Bi-containing samples to release lattice oxygen, and therefore to create Zrcus sites, than their Bi-free counterparts.
Fig. 2 Initial rate of propene formation at 550 °C over differently treated (a) ZrO2 and ZrBiOx catalysts as well as (b) bare LaZrOx and Bi2O3/LaZrOx catalysts. For comparison, the rate of propene formation over the most promising pre-reduced bulk catalysts (La8Zr92Ox, Y9Zr91Ox, and Sm10Zr90Ox) introduced in ref. 7 is shown in (a).
Among ZrBiOx and Bi2O3/LaZrOx samples, Zr95Bi5Ox and 0.5Bi2O3/LaZrOx demonstrated the highest activity after reductive treatment at 650 °C. The rate of propene formation over these catalysts was more than 6 times and about 77% higher than those determined for bare ZrO2 and LaZrOx tested under the same conditions, respectively. It is worth mentioning that all pre-reduced Bi-containing ZrO2-based catalysts outperform the most promising bulk ZrO2-based catalysts (La8Zr92Ox, Y9Zr91Ox, and Sm10Zr90Ox) introduced in ref. 7 in terms of the rate of propene formation (Fig. 2(a)). Noticeably, a reference 0.5Bi2O3/SiO2 material did not demonstrate any dehydrogenation activity (Fig. 2(b)) implying that Bi2O3 itself unlikely catalyses the dehydrogenation reaction. Accordingly, the enhanced rate of propene formation over pre-reduced Bi-containing materials compared to bare ZrO2 or ZrO2 modified by other promoters can be related to the superior oxide-ion conductivity of Bi-modified ZrO2,14 which seems to be required to facilitate the formation of active Zrcus sites under reductive conditions through the removal of lattice oxygen.
To check whether and how the Bi promoter affects primary and secondary reaction pathways in the course of propane dehydrogenation, catalytic tests were performed with the most promising Zr95Bi5Ox and 0.5Bi2O3/LaZrOx catalysts at 550 °C and different degrees of propane conversion. The catalysts were pre-reduced at either 550 °C or 600 °C. Fig. 3 shows the obtained selectivity-conversion profiles for propene, cracking products (CH4, C2H6 and C2H4), and coke. For comparative purposes, the respective data for an analogue of industrial K-CrOx/Al2O3 investigated in ref. 9 are also presented. For all catalysts, the selectivity to propene (Fig. 3(a)) decreases with increasing propane conversion, implying the presence of sequential stage(s) involving this olefin. At similar degrees of propane conversion, 0.5Bi2O3/LaZrOx demonstrated higher propene selectivity than Zr95Bi5Ox pre-treated in the same way. For the Zr95Bi5Ox and 0.5Bi2O3/LaZrOx catalysts pre-reduced at 550 °C, the extrapolation of propene selectivity to a zero-conversion degree gives a value of about 90% indicating that not only propene but also other side products are formed directly from propane. Noticeably, for the same catalysts pre-reduced at 600 °C, the extrapolated propene selectivity curves are shifted towards higher values close to the value achieved over the industrial analogue. For 0.5Bi2O3/LaZrOx pre-reduced at 600 °C, the extrapolation gives a near to 96% propene selectivity.
Fig. 3 Dependence of selectivity to (a) propene, (b) cracking products (CH4, C2H4, C2H6), and (c) coke on propane conversion determined at 550 °C over Zr95Bi5Ox and 0.5Bi2O3/LaZrOx pre-reduced at 550 °C (black symbols) or 600 °C (grey symbols). For comparison, the data from ref. 9 related to an industrial K-CrOx/Al2O3 analogue pre-reduced at 550 °C are shown with open symbols.
The selectivity-conversion curves for cracking products (Fig. 3(b)) look similar for all samples, i.e., the selectivity starts from a near-to-zero value at zero propane conversion and increases with increasing conversion. Such behaviour implies that cracking reactions occur as a sequential stage involving propene. Noticeably, the selectivity to cracking products at the same propane conversion degree is lower for the catalysts pre-reduced at 600 °C compared to that for their counterparts pre-reduced at 550 °C.
The selectivity to coke (Fig. 3(c)) formed over 0.5Bi2O3/LaZrOx pre-reduced at 600 °C and for K-CrOx/Al2O3 increases starting from a near-to-zero value. For other catalysts, this selectivity starts from about 7–12% and further increases with propane conversion. Such dependence indicates that coke can be formed directly from propane as well as from propene. Based on the above discussion, we suggest a reaction network of product formation in the course of propane dehydrogenation over Bi-containing catalysts (Fig. 4).
Fig. 4 Proposed scheme of propane dehydrogenation at 550 °C over Bi-containing ZrO2-based catalysts. Pre-reduction of the 0.5Bi2O3/LaZrOx catalyst at 600 °C suppresses the pathway shown by the dashed arrow.
The selectivity-conversion dependences were also obtained from PDH tests carried out at 600 °C with selected Bi-containing catalysts also pre-reduced at this temperature (Fig. S3, ESI†). Noticeably, increasing the reaction temperature resulted in an increase in propene selectivity at high conversion degrees (higher than 20%) compared to the corresponding values obtained at 550 °C (Fig. S3(a) (ESI†) versusFig. 3(a)). Such observation can be explained by suppressing side reactions (cracking (Fig. S3(b), ESI†) and coke formation (Fig. S3(c), ESI†)) probably due to faster desorption of propene from the catalyst surface at higher temperature. Since adsorbed propene is the main precursor for cracking products and coke, decreasing its residence time on the catalyst surface by increasing the temperature would decrease its probability to be converted into such side products. It is however worth mentioning that for Pt-based catalysts, the increase in the reaction temperature generally results in a decrease in propene selectivity, mainly due to the increasing coke formation rate.18 Contrarily, the performance of Bi-containing ZrO2-based catalysts is improved with increasing reaction temperature in terms of both activity and propene selectivity. For benchmarking purposes, the selectivity-conversion values obtained at 600 °C for 0.5Bi2O3/LaZrOx and for the most promising metal oxide catalysts reported in a recent review article1 are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). It is clearly seen that 0.5Bi2O3/LaZrOx showed industrially relevant propene production demonstrating its application potential.
The catalyst durability of the most promising Zr95Bi5Ox and 0.5Bi2O3/LaZrOx catalysts was checked in a series of 10 PDH/regeneration cycles performed at 550 °C (5 cycles) and 600 °C (5 cycles). The obtained time-on-stream profiles of propene space time yield in each catalytic cycle for each catalyst are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The samples gradually lost their activity with rising time on stream within one cycle. Both catalysts showed good durability from cycle to cycle at 550 °C. The initial activity could be restored after catalyst regeneration. This suggests that catalyst deactivation within one PDH cycle should be mostly caused by the blockage of catalytically active sites by carbon-containing deposits and no irreversible deactivation occurred. However, when the reaction temperature was increased to 600 °C, both catalysts slightly lost their activity from cycle to cycle implying that some irreversible changes in the structure/morphology of the catalysts might happen under alternating dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles.
In summary, we demonstrated, for the first time, that bulk or surface promotion of ZrO2 or LaZrOx with Bi2O3 results in active and particularly selective catalysts for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propene. Supported Bi2O3/LaZrOx catalysts revealed higher propene selectivity than binary ZrBiOx catalysts at the same degrees of propane conversion probably due to the presence of additional La2O3 promoter in the lattice of ZrO2. The developed catalysts do not obviously differ from an industrially relevant K-CrOx/Al2O3 in terms of propene-selectivity-conversion profiles. They also outperform the most promising bulk ZrO2-based catalysts introduced elsewhere. The presence of Bi in the lattice or on the surface of the ZrO2-based material significantly increases the ability of the latter to release its lattice oxygen, and accordingly to form catalytically active Zrcus sites, under reductive conditions.
