Steam reforming of n-decane for H2 production over Ni modified La-Al2O3 catalysts: Effects of the active component Ni content
Abstract
This study involves a new series granulate Ni modified La-Al2O3 (NLA) catalysts with high temperature resistant and large specific surface area for n-decane steam reforming. NLA catalysts were prepared by using a specially designed co-precipitation technique in combination with incipient wetness impregnation. Physicochemical characteristics of as-prepared catalysts were detected by using automatic adsorption instrument, X-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (IR), temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR), temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), and scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS). Significantly, the results of characterizations showed that the series NLA catalysts presented a typical mesoporous structure with a large surface area of ∼150.0 m2/g, and metal Ni was strongly interacted with Al2O3 to generate nickel aluminate spinel structures, and the addition of La improved the thermal stability of catalysts. Based on these data, the catalytic activities over NLA catalysts were evidently heightened compared with the corresponding La-Al2O3 catalyst, moreover, the 9.0 wt% NLA catalyst exhibited higher H2 yield and showed 100% n-decane conversion at 800 °C. The valuable information indicated in this work is that based on the special characters of NLA, bimetal particles can be supported on Al2O3 with different way, which should be an effective approach to maintain both catalytic activities and thermal stability.
1. Introduction
“Thermal barrier” on the surface of an engine is becoming currently the greatest challenge associated with hypersonic flight. The large amount of heat generated dramatically by air friction when the aircraft is in flight at the speed of supersonic or hypersonic regimes. It would cause the temperature of the fuselage and power equipment to rise sharply, potentially leading to significant damage [1], [2]. In recent years, new endothermic hydrocarbon fuels not only represent excellent high-performance fuels for propulsion in hypersonic flight, but also simultaneously working as good coolants for the vehicles by the heat absorption to remove aerodynamic heat from aircraft regimes [3], [4], [5]. Furthermore, the heat absorption composed by both significant physical sensible heat and heat-adsorbing of chemical reactions. Nowadays many researchers have been concentrated on studying to improve the heat absorption capability by chemical process of hydrocarbon fuels, which is an effective way to realize the engine regenerative cooling design [5], [6].
Catalytic dehydrogenation reactions [7], chemical cracking reactions (including both thermal cracking and catalytic cracking) [8], [9] and water steam reforming reactions [10], [11], which can generate a larger chemical heat sink by endothermic reactions of hydrocarbon fuel are considered to be feasible. Although the reactions rate of catalytic dehydrogenation and chemical cracking have obvious increased and generation of much heat-absorbents (such as hydrogen and low-carbon alkenes) by the introduction of catalysts, providing good heat absorption capability [12], [13]. However, they still cannot provide sufficient heat absorption to realize the engine regenerative cooling design, and easy to deactivation by carbon deposition. So, further development is needed to enhance the heat absorption capability of hydrocarbon fuels while to mitigate the carbon deposition from cracking reaction.
The water steam reforming of hydrocarbon fuel as a strong endothermic reaction can not only transform hydrocarbons and water into H2 and CO, absorbing aerodynamic heat, but also achieve high levels of H2 production and decrease carbon deposition at the same time [14], [15]. Korabelnikov et al. [11], [16], [17] studied the heat absorption of water steam reforming for methane, heptane, and decane, and measured the amount of carbon deposition. It can be easily seen that the water reforming reaction of n-decane under X catalyst could provide a larger heat sink (>4.6 MJ/kg) and lead to a catalyst having a longer working life. But they did not open the preparation method and the composition of X catalyst. Hou et al. [5], [10] investigated the heat sink and conversion of water steam reforming reaction of RP-3 jet fuel. The results showed that the steam reforming reaction of RP-3 over catalysts can not only significantly improve the total heat sink and fuel conversion, but also reduce the carbon deposition arising from the cracking process. The chemical heat sink of catalytic reforming reaction is higher than that of thermal cracking, especially in the high-temperature range.
A great deal of studies have been made on the investigation of hydrocarbon fuel steam reforming over precious metals such as Ru, Rh, Pt-based catalysts [18], [19] and transition metals Ni, Fe and Co-based catalysts [20], [21], [22]. In which of them, Ni-based catalysts represented comparable performance as precious metal catalysts with the cost efficiency and availability. Alumina supported Ni series catalysts have particularly received considerable attention because of their practical applications for a variety of reforming reactions [23], [24], [25]. Nevertheless, despite exhibiting excellent catalytic properties, alumina lacks an adequate thermal stability which provokes the sintering of supported metals; furthermore, using alumina as support has the drawback of rapid deactivation of the catalyst due to carbon deposition on its active acid centers [26], [27]. For these reasons, the interest of recent investigations has been focused on improve the thermal stability of alumina, thus minimizing the negative effect of its acid character. In this sense, some alkali and alkali earth metals were used as chemical promoters, and the effect of these promoters on the activity and stability of Ni/alumina catalysts had been extensively investigated. Typically these additives help to avoid carbon deposition and enhance their stability but at the expense of a reduction of their activity due to the blocking of the more reactive Ni sites [28], [29].
Lanthanum oxide as an effective promoter has been investigated as a Ni/alumina catalysts stabilizer [30], [31]. It shows great potential for improving the dispersion of the active phase which is one of the important concerns for developing excellent catalyst with high activity and stability, and inhibiting the carbon formation [32], [33], [34]. Moreover, La2O3 has been used as a promoter of Ni/Al2O3 catalysts for steam reforming of biomass and hydrocarbon fuel [23], [24], [35], [36].
Although many works have been reported that the addition of lanthanum species can effectively improve the catalytic activity and stability of Ni-based catalysts, the way of adding lanthanum species and the content of modified metals (Lanthanum, Nickel) have a great effect on the activity, stability and anti-carbon ability. Moreover, the controlled amount of basic Ni reduces the acidity and enhances the CO2 adsorption capacity of Al2O3 resulting in lower coke formation on the catalyst surface [37], [38], [39], [40]. Therefore, it is very necessary to study the influence of the way of adding lanthanum and the content of Ni on steam reforming reaction of hydrocarbons.
The work involves a new series granulate Ni modified La-Al2O3 catalyst with different content active component Ni, and the catalysts are prepared using a specially designed co-precipitation technique in combination with incipient wetness impregnation. The objective of this work is to investigate the influence of Ni loaded La-Al2O3 catalysts on steam reforming of hydrocarbons (n-decane) under high temperature. The catalysts prepared by the way of this work, the structure and surface morphology of these catalysts could be tuned, along with their reduction performance and thermal stability, so as high temperature resistant and large specific surface area for hydrocarbon fuel steam reforming. This work provided some fundamental suggestions for the catalytic reforming mechanism of hydrocarbons under high temperature, and catalyst screening for the catalytic heat exchangers for the advanced aircrafts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of La-Al2O3 composite oxides and Ni-loaded catalysts
La-Al2O3 composite oxides (containing 3.0 wt% La) was prepared by co-precipitation method. La(NO3)3·6H2O and Al(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in deionized water with a desired mass ratio and precipitation was induced by the addition of a pH 8.5 buffer solution composed of NH3·H2O and (NH4)2CO3. The as-prepared precipitate was aged, dried for 2 h at 120 °C and calcined for 3 h in air at 1000 °C, denoting as LA support.
Ni(NO3)2·6H2O as the Ni precursor has been supported on the La-Al2O3 composite oxide by an incipient-wetness impregnation method. The as-prepared LA support was divided into five lots, numbered 1#, 2#, 3#, 4#, 5#. Thereinto, 2#, 3#, 4#, 5# samples were impregnated and the Ni content is 3.0%, 6.0%, 9.0%, 12.0%, respectively, and then the impregnated catalysts were calcined at 800 °C for 2 h. The catalysts were subsequently made into columnar particles (3 mm diameter, 5 mm length) with a certain amount of water, dried at 120 °C. The Ni (3.0%, 6.0%, 9.0%, 12.0%)/La-Al2O3 catalysts obtained were denoted by Cat2, Cat3, Cat4Cat5, and the other one was denoted by Cat1. The catalysts dosage were all 3.0 ± 0.05 g.
2.2. Catalytic activity evaluation
Experiments were performed in a tubular reactor, which has been described in detail as shown in Fig. 1. The unit consisted of a liquid reactants feeding unit equipped with two feed pumps, flowmeters, temperature-control device, a packed-bed constructed with a stainless-steel tube reactor (12 mm i.d.), condenser, and an analysis system. Temperatures in the preheating furnace and catalytic bed were measured with four 3 mm o.d. K-type thermocouples. The first thermocouple measured the temperature of preheating furnace and the second, third and the fourth measured the temperature at the inlet of the bed, the half the bed, and the outlet to the bed, separately. For each experiment, the differences in temperature between these three measurements never exceeded 5.0 °C. Therefore, the catalytic bed was considered to operate isothermally and the average temperature of the bed was used as the temperature of the catalyst. Water and n-decane were separately pumped into the preheater at room temperature with constant flow pump at the flow rate of 2.5 mL/min to get a mixture of n-decane and water vapors, and then fed in the reactor loaded with 3.0 g catalyst admixed with an equal amount of inert alumina pellets of similar size. The temperature of the preheating section were both controlled at 350 °C, and the temperature of reaction section was set at 600, 650, 700 °C, 750 °C or 800 °C controlled by programmed temperature-control devices for evaluating catalytic performance. The reaction was quenched by dropping temperature through a water condenser and was separated by a gas–liquid separator. The volume of the gaseous products was quantified by wet gas flow meter and the liquid residues were collected with a conical flask and weighed. Conversion and H2 yield of several temperature spots were evaluated in the experiment.

The composition of the gaseous products which came from the gas-liquid separator were pulsed into the gas chromatograph (GC-2010, SHIMADZU Co., Ltd.), equipped with a HP-Al/S separation capillary column (Agilent technologies Co., Ltd., 50 m × 0.53 mm) and FID detector for analyzing small hydrocarbons. The content of H2, CO and CO2 were analyzed with external standard method, 2 m packed-bed column (stationary phase, TDX-01) and TCD detector. Carbon deposited on the used catalyst was analyzed by temperature programmed oxidation coupled with IR detector (TPO-IR) in a 1050E on-line CO2 Gas Determinator. The used catalysts were heated to 700 °C (8 °C/min) in a flow of 5% O2 in N2. The evolution of CO and CO2 was monitored by the on-line CO2 gas analyzer and the amount of carbon was determined by integration of these signals. The IR intensity as related to the amount of CO2 (the carbon amount) was calibrated daily by running TPO-IR using standard carbon material.
The error of mass balance was less than 3.0% between feeds and products involving gas, liquid products, and carbon. Moreover, the repetitive experiments of each group catalysts were carried out, and the experimental results showed that the repeatability were good, the error of the repetitive experiments were less than 2.5% in each temperature spots. As a result, the fuel supply can be delivered in a stable and uniform way to the subsequent heating and sampling sections.
2.3. Catalysts characterization
BET surface areas were calculated from the nitrogen adsorption isotherms at 77 K using ASAP 2000 surface analyzer (Micromeritics Instruments, USA). Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the catalysts were obtained with a DX-2500 X-ray diffractometer (China Dandong Fangyuan Instrument Co., Ltd.) using nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation. The patterns were recorded over a range of 2 theta range of 10–80° at a step rate of 1.8°/min, and compared to the X-ray powder references to confirm phase identities. IR spectroscopy was also applied to study the chemical structure of catalysts. The infrared spectra of the samples were obtained at wavelengths ranging from 400 to 4000 cm−1. Furthermore, temperature-programmed reduction (TPR-H2) profiles of fresh catalysts under H2-blanket were carried out using a TP-5076 TPR instrument. In a typical TPR experiment, ∼100 mg of sample is loaded in a quartz flow microreactor and heated to 920 °C at 8 °C/min under 5% H2/Ar with a total flow of 25 cm3/min. Prior to TPR profiles acquisition, all samples were pretreated at 400 °C for 45 min in a flow of Ar and cooled to room temperature under the same atmosphere. The surface acidity of each catalyst was measured by NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) using a TP-5076 TPD instrument. During these measurements, a sample of 100 mg was heated to 400 °C at a rate of 8 °C/min in a flow of N2, held at 400 °C for 45 min and then cooled to room temperature. The gas was then switched to 2% NH3 in N2 (20 cm3/min) for absorption for 60 min and then over the temperature was increased from ambient to 700 °C at a heating rate of 8 °C/min, employing a thermal conductivity detector. In addition, Morphological characterization was examined by Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) using a Quanta 600FEG Field emission scanning electron microscope (FEI, USA) and coupled with Oxford-IE-250 energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) for local elemental composition determination.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic activities
3.1.1. H2 selectivity and n-decane conversions
The water steam reforming of n-decane over LA and series of NLA catalysts were performed, respectively. The observed n-decane conversions, and H2, CO, CO2 selectivity were defined as the formula ((1) and (2)) and compared the results as shown in Fig. 2(a–e).

Fig. 2. Fuel conversions and H2 selectivity over series Ni/La-Al2O3 catalysts.
Cat1–La-Al2O3; Cat2–3% Ni/La-Al2O3; Cat3–6% Ni/La-Al2O3; Cat4–9% Ni/La-Al2O3; Cat5–12% Ni/La-Al2O3.
Compared to the results in Fig. 2, the H2 selectivity over the NLA catalysts are higher than LA catalyst at the range of 650–800 °C, and the numerical value increased with the temperature. The H2 selectivity over the series catalysts is increased by the following order: Cat1(None) < Cat2(3%) < Cat5(12%) < Cat3(6%) < Cat4(9%), appears to increase first and then decrease with the increasing levels of Ni, and reaches the best associated with Ni content of 9%. Furthermore, the results over 9% NLA catalyst are increased by 4.7, 2.9, 2.5, 2.3 and 1.4 folds at the range of 600–800 °C compared with the results over LA catalyst, and achieve the greatest H2 concentration of 75.1% at 800 °C. It also can be seen that the n-decane conversions over NLA catalysts have a slight change compared with the LA catalyst at the same condition, and the numerical value increased with the temperature. It’s interesting that the percentage composition of COx (CO and CO2) over NLA catalysts (Ni content ≤ 9%) increases progressively with the temperature. However, the value over 12% NLA increases first and then decreases with the temperature, and the value is obviously less than others above 750 °C. In addition, on the premise of almost the same conversion, the content of COx over LA catalyst is much lower than NLA catalysts at the range of 600–50 °C, and is moving closer to the NLA at 800 °C, showing that the reforming reaction over the LA catalyst is violent occurred at 800 °C and the addition of Ni species is helpful for the reforming reaction.
The introduction of moderate Ni metal into LA can enhance the activities of steam reforming reaction obviously, accelerate the reaction rate and yield of all sorts of small molecule, improve the conversion of n-decane. Shao et al. [41] and Dou et al. [42] found that CC and CH are easy to break in the surface of Ni active sites, which is helpful for improving the rate of reforming reaction and the rate of generating hydrogen. However, the decrease of the activity over 12% NLA may cause by the carbon deposition or/and the sintering of nickel particles.
3.1.2. Carbon deposition
The amount of carbon deposition results over the NLA catalysts are shown in Table 1. The results manifested that the amount of carbon deposition were varied with the different Ni content, and followed by such order: Cat1(None)> Cat5(12%)> Cat4(9%)> Cat3(6%)> Cat2(3%). It clearly indicated that the introduction of Ni can reduce the amount of carbon deposition from LA catalyst, but the amount of carbon deposition increases progressively with the Ni content. On the whole, moderate Ni modified LA catalyst can reduce the side effects of reforming reaction (cracking, reaction, isomerization, hydrogen transfer reaction, etc.), and decrease the carbon deposition generation, but the excess Ni in the catalysts has an adverse influence on decreasing the amount of carbon deposition. Studies [43], [44] have shown that the rate of generating carbon deposition at high temperature has a great relationship with the loading metal on catalyst. Stefan et al. [45] found that the Ni loading played an important role on stability of the catalyst and affected the amount of carbon deposition.

Reports [26], [27], [46], [47], [48], [49] have stated that the larger acidity is contribute to promote the cracking reaction effectively, and is responsible for carbon deposition via hydrocarbon cracking. One of the superior performances of alumina supports which often lead to better catalytic performance was greater surface acidity. Therefore, the cracking reaction of hydrocarbon fuel is easier to occur over LA catalyst, so the amount of carbon deposition over LA is larger than others.
3.1.3. Thermal stability and regeneration
The thermal stability of 9% NLA catalyst was performed on the steam reforming of n-decane at 750 °C and 800 °C for lasting 120 min in Fig. 3(a), respectively. It could be seen that the 9%NLA catalyst has good stability at higher temperature in hydrogen production (∼65% at 750 °C, ∼75% at 800 °C) and n-decane conversion (∼92.6% at 750 °C, 100% at 800 °C) within 120 min. Carbon deposition on used 9%NLA catalyst was removed by oxygen enriched calcination, and the performance of the regenerated catalyst was assessed again in the reaction vessel. From the above results in Fig. 3(b), it was found that the n-decane conversions and H2 selectivity obtained with the reused catalysts were quite close to the results of fresh at each temperature spots, respectively. The catalyst is therefore capable of regeneration.

In order to clarify the reasons why the catalyst of 9% NLA catalyst had the better activity than others, the fresh and used catalysts were characterized by using BET, XRD, IR, H2-TPR, SEM-EDS apparatus, respectively.
3.2. Textural properties of Ni/La-Al2O3 catalysts
Table 1 also lists the data obtained from the textural characteristics analysis of the as-prepared NLA catalysts with different Ni content as determined by the BET method. The LA catalyst still has a larger surface area after 1000 °C calcination for 3 h (∼150.0 m2/g). The introduction of lanthanum into alumina can improve thermal stability of LA catalyst. The specific surface areas of the NLA catalysts have a slightly decrease with the addition of Ni, and the value gradually decrease along with the increasing of Ni content. This difference probably resulted from the corresponding proportion of NiAl2O4 formed in each NLA samples, which will be discussed in the XRD, H2-TPR sections. A similar observation in line with the decrease of specific surface area by the modification process was previously reported in various works dealing with Ni/Al2O3 catalysts and multiple explanations have been given to describe its origin [50], [51]. For instance, Bartholomew et al. [51] reported that the phase transformations and/or dispersed nickel can accelerate the loss of alumina surface area in Ni/Al2O3 catalysts. Even so, all the samples kept a larger total surface area (>140.0 m2/g) after calcination at high temperature. A larger surface area of reforming catalysts under higher temperature (>800 °C) is the basis of better activity and thermal stability. It is beneficial for promoting the active component Ni uniform dispersion and thus playing a positive role to prevent active sites from agglomerating during sintering [52]. As noted above, the larger surface area of NLA catalysts correlates with its superior catalytic activity.
Fig. 4(a) shows that the pore size of each catalyst is concentrated in the region 2–20 nm, and the most probable pore size exhibited one maximum at 4 nm in the low mesoporous range. Fig. 4(b) shows that the adsorption isotherms were characteristic of mesoporous material of type IV (as per the IUPAC classification). In the case of the LA and series NLA catalysts the nitrogen desorption gave rise to a hysteresis loop, H2 type, which were characteristic of disordered porous materials [53].

3.3. XRD results
XRD technique is employed for the fresh catalysts to determine its crystallite phase. The powder XRD patterns of fresh LA and series NLA catalysts (Fig. 5) revealed that diffraction lines at 2θ value of recorded at 32.3°, 45.7°, 60.5° 66.8° are synonymous with γ-Al2O3 crystallite (PDF card No. 50–0741) by Bragg’s refections [3], [10]. The diffraction peak at 2θ value of 37.3° observed form the patterns of LA is attributed to γ-Al2O3 [3], however, there is an overlap on the diffraction peaks of γ-Al2O3 and NiAl2O4 (PDF card No. 10–0339) [54], [55], [56] at 2θ value of recorded at 37.3° observed form the patterns of NLA samples. Moreover, the intensity of the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 37.3° over series NLA samples are stronger than LA caused by the appearance of NiAl2O4.

Fig. 5. XRD diffraction spectrum of series Ni/La-Al2O3 catalysts.
The XRD patterns of the fresh NLA catalysts presented the broad and diffuse peaks, showing that the crystallinity of all catalysts are smaller after calcining at 800 °C. Crystallization of the catalysts will decrease the surface area with concurrent lessening of the catalytic activity. The results of BET surface combined with XRD patterns demonstrated that the high temperature stability of the catalysts was excellent. Moreover, the special peaks of Ni and NiO species had a poor degree of crystallinity and were not easy to detectable by XRD pattern. Most likely it is due to the well dispersion on catalysts. This indicated that nickel species were strongly interacted with support through the formation of nickel aluminate phase,[57], [58] in good agreement with XRD result. In addition, no peaks of La species such as La2O3 or LaAlO3 were detected in all the catalysts, which implied that the bulk La2O3 species were incorporated within the vacancies of the γ-Al2O3 structure or had a poor degree of crystallinity to be detected by XRD [59]. Pure γ-Al2O3 inevitably transforms into θ-Al2O3 or α-Al2O3 after being calcined at 1000 °C [60]. However, the La2O3 modified Al2O3 support are stable and La2O3 can restrain the phase transition of γ-Al2O3 at high temperature [61]. It has been reported that the additives based on rare-earth and/or alkaline-earth elements help stabilizing Al2O3 by preventing phase transformation at high temperature [62], [63]. The addition of La has been studied extensively as an effective promoter, [62], [63], [64] its presence has some beneficial effects on the catalyst performance, such as improving the dispersion of the active phase, and the thermal stability of Al2O3 by preventing phase transformation. Prior to nickel loading Al2O3 was modified with La in order to achieve thermal stability of the support, which is an effective approach to maintain both catalytic activities and thermal stability.
3.4. IR results
IR analysis is used to examine the surface chemical bonding of the NLA catalysts and the spectrum is shown in Fig. 6. Clearly, there is a shoulder peaks centered at around 3400 cm−1 for each of the catalysts, indicating that the interaction between hydroxyls groups and/or chemisorbed water on the LA support via hydrogen bonding [65]. This band describes the flexing vibration of the OH stretch. It is worth noting that it can be observed that the intensity of the OH band has some correlation with the specific surface area of catalysts, i.e., OH intensity for the LA support (158.9 m2/g) is higher than the 12%NLA catalyst (141.8 m2/g). This view may be related to the changes in hydration degree of change/metal induced hydrophilic surface of the catalyst. In addition, two bands are visible in the low frequency and weak peaks centered 1637 cm−1 at 1384 cm−1 for all prepared catalysts and the peak intensity decreased with the addition of Ni. This shows that these bands can be assigned to the LA support and more specifically to the AlO flexing vibration band [66].

3.5. H2-TPR analysis
In order to elucidate the modified metal Ni reducible species presented in the NLA catalysts with different Ni loadings, the H2-TPR experiment was executed. In addition, this technique can help in identifying the nickel phases present in each catalyst. The H2-TPR profiles included in Fig. 7 suggested the full reduction of the Ni based La-Al2O3 catalysts with an overall H2 uptake. It was observed the thermogram of the NLA samples showed typical reduction spectrum of a mixture of two Ni species consisting of free NiOx (peak at 240 and 400 ∘C) and nickel aluminates structures (peak at ∼800 ∘C) [56], [67]. Low temperature peaks were attributed to NiOx species having no and/or weak interaction with the support. The former small peak can be associated with Ni2O3 species, and the later peak is corresponded to free NiO species [67]. The high temperature peaks with a maximum at about 800 °C, which is ascribed to the stable nickel aluminate phase with a spinel structure due to the reduction of Ni2+ ions incorporated in the nickel aluminate structure, characterized by its high stability [68], [69].

In principle, a higher reduction temperature would be expected for highly stabilized nickel species. The NiAl2O4 species have become dominant on catalysts and increase with the amount of Ni content, implying that a significant amount of Ni content is strongly interacted to alumina and generated some nickel aluminate spinel structures. The reduction peak intensity of NiAl2O4 species in 12%NLA catalyst is obvious reinforcing and the reduction temperature is moving to lower temperature. Therefore, it may be one of the reasons accounting for the decline of catalytic activity over 12%NLA catalyst.
It is known that lanthanum generally exist as a form of La2O3 on the alumina support, because it is difficult for La3+ ions to diffuse into the vacant sites of alumina due to their large ionic radius [70]. It was worth noting that diffraction peaks of La2O3 were not detected in all the Ni/LA catalysts, indicating that La2O3 was highly dispersed on the surface of these catalysts. This indicates that finely dispersed La2O3 caused fine dispersion of nickel aluminate phase, in good agreement with the previous results [62], [70]. It can be inferred that lanthanum added to alumina catalyst was responsible for fine dispersion of nickel aluminate phase of the catalyst by serving as a structural promoter. According to Berkó et al. [71] Al2O3 was not easily reduced due to its high stability; hence its inert characteristic.
3.6. NH3-TPD analysis
NH3-TPD techniques were used to study the acidities of the catalysts, such as total amount, nature, and distributions, and to find the possible explanations for the above experimental results. Adsorbed NH3 was continuously stripped from the catalysts surfaces, showing that the surface acidic sites of these catalysts have a homogeneous, continuous distribution and that there is large surface acidity [72]. It can be seen that all of the samples have two/three strong desorption peaks in the temperature region of 100–500 °C, interpreting as the desorption peak of the weak and medium acid, and the desorption peaks area of LA sample is the largest in this region. In Fig. 8, it also summarizes the total amount of acid over LA and series NLA catalysts, which is evolving by the following order: Cat1(None)> Cat2(3%) ≈ Cat3(6%) ≈ Cat4(9%)> Cat5(12%), and the LA has the greatest total amount of acid (0.296 mmol/g). Reports [26], [27] have stated that larger acidity and active acid centers have the drawback of rapid deactivation of the catalyst due to carbon deposition. It is worth noting that the amount of acid decrease gradually with the increasing levels of Ni. Therefore, the addition of Ni reduced the acidity of LA, which is helpful to reduce the carbon deposition over catalysts and prolong the work life of catalysts.

3.7. SEM-EDS results
The micro-morphology of fresh NLA catalysts and carbon deposition on the used catalyst can be determined from SEM images. Fig. 9(a–d) represents the SEM images of fresh NLA (Ni content 3.0%, 6.0%, 9.0%, 12.0%) catalysts. The micrographs of the four samples showed no significant differences in morphology. It was observed that the catalysts were uniform and densification with spherical particles, and the particle sizes were about 6–8 μm. The images of used 9% NLA catalyst subjected to carbon deposition during the reforming reaction of n-decane at 750 °C were shown in Fig. 9(e and f). It can be seen that the carbon deposition covers the catalyst and presents the filamentous. The sizes of the filamentous carbon are about 100 nm. These results are in good agreement with the mechanisms proposed in the literature for filamentous carbon growth [62]. EDS analysis results listed in Table 2 were achieved three different locations of the each sample to determine the average actual loading of Ni and La. The results present that the Ni actual loading of the fresh NLA catalysts (Cat2, Cat3, Cat4, Cat5) are ∼3.50, ∼5.59, ∼8.40, ∼11.73 wt%, which are approximately equal to the intended recipe during the impregnation, and the values of La are all less than 3.0 wt% in each NLA catalysts. Scanning the used catalyst after carbon deposition showed that the carbon content of the catalyst after reforming reaction was 91.3%. What is more, a small amount of Ni metal was found in the carbon nanofibers. This can demonstrate that active metals had removed from the surface of catalysts with the generation of coking. Altin et al. [44] think Ni metal surface easily catalytic hydrocarbon CC and CH bond rupture, C is easily scattered in the metal surface by crystallization displacement, eventually deposited on metal surface. As noted, this level of carbon deposition on the surface of the catalyst blocks the catalyst pores and hinders contact between the catalyst and reactant, thus slowing the rate of the reforming reaction. Carbon deposition is one of the primary causes of reforming catalyst deactivation.

4. Conclusions
Catalytic reforming of n-decane (a kind of model fuel) was examined over a series of NLA catalysts with different Ni content under high temperature. It was obvious that the hydrogen yield over the NLA catalysts were evidently heightened compared with the LA, and obtained an optimum over 9% NLA catalyst, which was in well accordance with the synergy between Ni and La-Al2O3, and the larger surface area. Adding a small amount of La2O3 can increase the thermal stability of the NLA catalysts, is helpful to improve the dispersion of the active phase, and promote the NLA catalysts to exhibit better activity and carbon deposition resistance.
Although this work involves a new series Ni modified La-Al2O3 catalysts, which are prepared using a specially designed co-precipitation technique in combination with incipient wetness impregnation. And the characterization results for the NLA catalysts are mainly discussed in this paper. Nevertheless, how to inhibit carbon deposition should be further studied. Now studies are still on the way in our lab to further optimize the Ni/La-Al2O3 catalyst by the way of adding additives, so that the growth of the carbon deposition can be restrained and the catalyst can be used for a longer time at high temperature.
