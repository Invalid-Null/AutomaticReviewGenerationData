1. Introduction
Propene is the basic raw material for the production of a large range of chemicals like propylene oxide, polypropene, acrolein and acrylonitrilec [1,2]. Stimulated by the increasing global propene supply-demand gap and advances in shale-gas exploitation, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as an on-purpose propene production technique has drawn great attentions in recent years [[1], [2], [3]]. Because of the endothermicity and thermodynamic limitations, high temperatures generally above 550 °C are required to obtain industrial interest propene yield. The harsh operational condition leads to severe catalyst deactivation due to coking or sintering of active sites. And thus, high activity, coking-resistance property and structural stability are crucial for PDH catalysts [4,5]. In commercialized PDH processes, PtSn/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts are developed and utilized on account of their high temperature stability and propene productivity [1,2,5]. Endeavors are devoted to further enhancing the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts through electronic and structural manipulation [6,7]. Owing to the high cost of platinum and toxic nature of chromium, other earth-abundant metal oxides such as VOx, GaOx, ZnO and FeOx have been explored for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation [4,[8], [9], [10]].
Among these oxide-based catalysts, vanadium oxides are promising candidates because of low cost and low toxicity [1,8,11]. The performance of VOx-based catalysts is influenced by several factors including the chemical states of vanadium, the coordination environments of central V cations and the nature of supports [[12], [13], [14], [15], [16]]. The identity of supports has been extensively studied and proved to influence the redox properties of VO bonds and their propane oxidative dehydrogenation (OPDH) activities significantly through VOx-support interactions [[17], [18], [19], [20]]. The primary difference between OPDH and PDH is whether the lattice oxygens in VO bonds are consumed or not. Support effects were also observed for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation over VOx-based catalysts-higher PDH activity were observed over SiO2-Al2O3 or ZrO2 supported VOx catalysts than that of siliceous or alumina supported ones [8,21]. Although the structure-performance relationship of supported VOx catalysts is still unclear because of the ambiguity in VOx structure under reduction atmosphere [19,22]. It has been reported by several authors that the VO bonds in partly reduced V3+/V4+ species are active sites to catalyze propane C–H bond activation to form hydrogen and propene [15,23,24]. Therefore, it is possible to tune the intrinsic activity of VO bonds through altering the V-O-support interactions like that in oxidation reactions.
Transition aluminas are widely used in chemical industry as catalysts or supports, including commercial PDH processes on account of their high surface area, hydrothermal stability and adjustable physicochemical properties [[25], [26], [27]]. It was found in several studies that the polymorphs of alumina have profound influences on the structure and catalytic performance of active phases [[27], [28], [29], [30]]. Li et al. [29] reported that high-energy Pd(100) facets could be stabilized by dense hydroxyl groups on γ-Al2O3(111) surface. Lin et al. [27] illustrated that, for the Ru-Ba/Al2O3 catalysts, the size distribution, metal-to-oxide ratio, the N2 desorption behavior and ammonia synthesis rates were significantly influenced by the calcination temperature of aluminas. Laurenti et al. [31] found that the CoMo dispersion and interactions with support and the resulting 4,6-DMDBT hydrodesulfurization activity were influenced by alumina phases. Since propane activation proceeds over metal-oxygen bonds and the chemical states of which can be significantly influenced by the nature of support matrix, the polymorphs of transition aluminas might also renders structural or performance differences on VOx-based catalysts.
Herein, four kinds of transition alumina γ-Al2O3, δ-Al2O3, θ-Al2O3 and θ,α-Al2O3 were firstly obtained by calcinating boehmite at certain temperatures. Then, VOx/Al2O3 catalysts with the same V surface density were prepared over these transition aluminas. The effects of alumina phases on VOx dispersion, VOx molecular structure, VOx-support interactions, V chemical states were studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD), ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), Raman and UV–vis spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The intrinsic activity and coking behavior of these VOx/Al2O3 catalysts were evaluated and correlated with structural properties.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Preparation of transition aluminas and catalysts
Commercial boehmite (HC-01, Shandong Xingdu Petrochemical Technology Co. Ltd.) was calcinated at 600, 800, 1050 and 1150 °C respectively to obtain different transition aluminas. All VOx/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared with incipient wetness impregnation method [17]. In a typical process, certain concentration of ammonium metavanadate solution (99.95 %, Macklin) with NH4VO3 to oxalic acid (99.8 %, Aladdin) ratio of 0.5 was added dropwise to pre-dried alumina. The resulted solid was firstly dried overnight at room temperature and then transferred to an oven kept at 120 °C for another 3 h. The dried solid was crushed and then heated at a rate of 2 °C/min. and calcinated at 550 °C in air for 3 h.
2.2. Catalysts characterization
The XRD patterns were collected on an X'Pert PRO MPD diffractometer using Cu (Kα) radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA in a speed of 10°/min from 10°-80°. The samples were evacuated at 200 °C for 2 h before N2 adsorption-desorption on a Builder Kubo X1000 apparatus. The specific surface area was calculated with BET method, the pore volume and pore size distributions were calculated by BJH method. Raman spectroscopy of freshly calcinated catalysts were measured on a Bruker senterra II spectrometer equipped with a 532 nm laser source. Diffuse-reflectance UV–vis spectroscopy of calcinated samples were collected on a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer in the region 200−800 nm using BaSO4 as reference. The Reflectivity data were converted to absorption spectra using the Kubelka-Munk function: F(R)=(1-R)2/2R. Where R is the reflection factor. The edge energy (Eg) was determined from the UV–vis spectra by calculating the intercept of the straight line of the plot of [F(R) hν]2 against hν, where hν is the incident photon energy. The XPS data were acquired on a Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi equipped with an Al Kα radiation. All catalysts were pre-reduced by 40 % H2/N2 at 550 °C for 90 min before test. The binding energy of C1s level at 284.8 eV was taken as internal reference.
Temperature-programmed experiments were conducted on a Builder PCA-1200 equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For ammonia temperature programmed desorption, about 100 mg sample was pre-treated at 400 °C in He for 1 h, then the sample was cooled to 100 °C for ammonia adsorption, after that the sample was treated in He flow (50 mL/min.) for 1 h to remove physically adsorbed ammonia. The desorption process was carried out from 100 to 600 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min. For temperature programmed reduction, 8% H2 in Ar was used. The calcinated and dried sample (about 100 mg) was pretreated in Ar flow at 100 °C for 2 h, and then the H2 signal was recorded from 100 to 800 °C. For temperature programmed oxidation, 8% O2 in Ar was used, the spent sample (from 500 to 100 mg) was pretreated in Ar flow at 100 °C for 2 h, the O2 signal was recorded from 100 to 600 °C. The coke content was measured through TG analysis on a Shimadzu DTG-60H thermogravimetric analyzer.
2.3. Catalytic test
Propane dehydrogenation reactions were performed at 550 °C in a fixed-bed quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 8 mm. The temperature of this reactor can be maintained within ±0.5 °C of set point. The calcinated catalyst was packed inside the central thermostatic region of the quartz reactor with a thermocouple located in the catalyst bed. Kinetic measurements were conducted at WHSV =6.48 h−1 at propane partial pressure of 18 kPa (30 mL/min. of 18 vol.% C3H8/Ar mixture). For the dehydrogenation-regeneration reaction, the reactor was purged with argon after each dehydrogenation cycle, after that 20 mL/min. air was introduced to burn off cokes for 30 min, the reactor was purged with argon again before starting a new dehydrogenation cycle. The products of PDH was analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (FULI 9790II) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector. Propane conversion and propene selectivity were calculated based on a carbon-atom balance method from the following equations:

where FC3H8, FC3H6, FC2H6, FC2H4 and FCH4, were the molar flow rate of reactants or products in the reactor outlet, the carbon balance was in the range of 98–100 % for all test conditions. The average propane turnover frequency (TOFpropane) was calculated based on total V atoms (NVOx) using the following method:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of transition aluminas and As-synthesized catalysts
The structure of alumina obtained through treatment of the same kind of boehmite at different temperatures were characterized by the X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 1, the XRD patterns of samples treated at 600, 800, and 1050 °C show typical diffraction peaks of γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS No. 75-0921), δ-Al2O3 (JCPDS No. 88-1609) and θ-Al2O3 (JCPDS No. 79-1559), respectively. A mixed phase of transition alumina was obtained for the sample treated at 1150 °C as indicated by the coexistence of characteristic diffraction lines of θ and α alumina phase. The alumina phases obtained in the present study by altering boehmite calcination temperatures corresponded well with previous studies [32,33].

Fig. 2 provides the basic textural properties of catalysts determined by N2 adsorption-desorption experiments, the BET surface area, average pore size, pore volume before and after vanadium oxide loading were profiled in Table 1. The isotherms of these transition aluminas show type IV sorption behavior, and the hysteresis loops can be assigned to H-3 according to the IUPAC classification [34], suggesting that they have parallel plate shape mesoporous structures [29,35]. The BET surface area decreases with increasing alumina calcination temperature, while he pore-size distribution maxima increase with increasing annealing temperature (Table 1), indicating the formation of broader porous channels during alumina transformation at higher temperatures [36,37].

To probe the effects of alumina phases on the structure and intrinsic activity of VOx species, the V surface density calculated based on BET surface area was controlled at similar level of around 2.5 V/nm2, which is far below the theoretical monolayer coverage of VOx (7−8 V/nm2) to avoid the formation of three-dimensional vanadium structure [38]. After vanadium deposition, a decrease in both BET surface areas and pore volumes was observed, implying that the VOx species were mainly introduced into the channels of these transition aluminas. As shown in Fig. 1, no crystal V2O5 diffraction lines could be identified on the XRD patterns of VOx loaded catalysts, suggesting the absence of large V2O5 crystals on the surface of these transition aluminas.
The acidity of transition aluminas and as-synthesized catalysts were measured with NH3-TPD. As shown in Fig. 3, all transition aluminas exhibit two broad peaks on the NH3-TPD profiles. The relatively lower temperature desorption region (120−260 °C) represents weak to medium acid sites and the higher temperature region (260−480 °C) are medium to strong acidic sites on these supports [29,39,40]. The peaks were then deconvoluted into three regions using the Gaussian method to represent the weak, medium and strong acid sites, respectively. It was found that the peak intensities and corresponding total acid sites decrease with increasing alumina calcination temperature (Fig. 3 and Table 2), in agreement with previous study [27,35]. In addition, the strong acid sites disappear for aluminas calcinated at temperatures higher than 1050 °C and the proportion of medium acid sites also decrease with increasing calcination temperature, indicating the depletion of surface hydroxyl groups on these aluminas [27,41,42]. After the introduction of VOx, the weak to medium acid sites are enhanced while the relatively strong acid sites decrease dramatically compared to their alumina counterparts for all catalysts, which suggests that these VOx species preferentially interact with relatively strong acid sites of aluminas and thus the VOx-support interactions might be weak on transition aluminas calcinated at higher temperatures because of the lack of sufficient medium to strong acid sites.

The XRD technique cannot detect crystals smaller than 3 nm, the dispersion and molecular structure of VOx were further characterized by Raman spectra, which is sensitive to the crystalline V2O5 and the molecular structure of dispersed VOx species [43]. As shown in Fig. 4, no sharp band at 995 cm−1 characteristic of crystalline V2O5 can be identified, indicating the absence of V2O5 crystals on the surface of these transition aluminas. The VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst produced two main broad band at around 820 cm-1 and 938 cm−1, the former broad band can be assigned to the V-O-Al interface or VOV modes in polyvanadate domains [8,43,44]. Similar Raman spectra of VOx supported on alumina with high dispersion were reported previously [8,22,43,45], Stair and colleagues [43] found that the band at around 930 cm-1 was readily shifted to 1030 cm−1 assigning to monovanadates under dehydrated conditions. Therefore, the band at 938 cm−1 can be tentatively ascribed to the vibration of hydrated terminal vanadyl bonds in dispersed VOx species [43]. The VOx/δ-Al2O3 and VOx/θ-Al2O3 catalysts produced similar Raman spectra in the range of 700−1050 cm−1. The band at 900 cm−1 becomes distinguishable and the two bands (820 cm−1 and 900 cm−1) representative of polymeric vanadia become dominant. The band ascribing to symmetric VO stretching modes on the two samples appears at higher vibration frequency of 989 cm−1, and further shifts to 1010 cm−1 on VOx/θ, α-Al2O3 catalyst. The blue shift trend of this band is similar to the situation with increasing VOx loading observed by Wachs and colleagues [46], which indicates the increase of VOx domain size.

Further structural information was provided by UV–vis spectroscopy collected in the region 200−800 nm. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the d-d adsorption bands in the region 1.55–2.07 eV (600−800 nm) indicative the presence of V4+ [47] are absence on all samples, thus all vanadium on these supports were fully oxidized to V5+ after calcination. The adsorption band caused by ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) transitions of V5+ shows extensive adsorption band in the region 200−540 nm (2.30–6.20 eV). In general, a shift of LMCT band to higher wavelength is observed for dispersed VOx with increasing coordination numbers of central vanadium cation [47,48]. The γ-Al2O3 supported VOx shows an adsorption band centered at 310 nm, the VOx/δ-Al2O3 and VOx/θ-Al2O3 display similar LMCT band features with increased adsorption intensity at around 420 nm and a very broad adsorption band summitted at 380 nm can be observe on VOx/θ,α-Al2O3. These results indicate that higher coordinated vanadium atoms are presented on the surface of transition aluminas prepared under higher annealing temperatures.

The coordination environment of VOx can be estimated from the UV–vis edge energies (Eg) of catalysts based on Kubelka-Munk function. The edge energy of the LMCT transitions of V5+ was shown previously to correlate with the covalent VOV bonds number in the coordination of central V5+ cation (CVB), and thus to represent the degree of polymerization of VOx species [38,44,49,50]. The edge energy of these samples was shown in Fig. 5(b), the CVB number and the corresponding structure assignments were compiled in Table 3. For VOx/γ-Al2O3, the edge energy is 3.22 eV and the corresponding CVB number-calculated from the empirical equation CVB = 14.03−3.95Eg established by Wachs et al. [38].-is 1.31, which indicates the presence of both polymerized and isolated VO4 species in tetrahedral coordinates, in accordance with the results obtained by Raman spectra. The CVB number for δ-Al2O3 and θ-Al2O3 supported VOx are at around 3.20, suggesting the coexistence of polymerized VO4 species in tetrahedral coordinates and polymerized VO5/VO6 species in square-pyramidal coordinates. The edge energy for VOx/θ,α-Al2O3 is 2.58 eV with a CVB number of 3.84, thus the polymerized VO5/VO6 species dominant on θ,α-Al2O3 surface. The trend of increase in the VOx polymerization degree corresponds well with the Raman spectra. The relatively well dispersion of VOx over γ-Al2O3 compared to δ-Al2O3 was also observed by Stair and colleages [43]. As is known that the surface VOx species are formed by reacting with hydroxyl groups on supports, and thus the density and reactivity of surface hydroxyl influence the molecular structure of surface species. The reactivity of hydroxyl groups was found in the order of γ-Al2O3 > δ-Al2O3 > θ-Al2O3 > α-Al2O3 [32,33,42,51]. This explains the different dispersion and coordination environment of VOx species over these transition aluminas.

3.2. PDH performances and structure-activity relationships
Propane dehydrogenation was conducted over these transition aluminas supported VOx catalysts. The intrinsic activity of VOx/Al2O3 was evaluated by the average propane turnover frequencies (TOFpropane), and thus the reaction condition was controlled to limit the conversion of propane below 10 % for all samples. The initial TOFpropane was collected after reacting 10 minutes to exclude the influence of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane by reactive oxygen in VOx species since which can be depleted within the first several minutes [15,24]. As shown in Fig. 6(a), propane dehydrogenation activity increases significantly with increasing aluminas calcination temperature. In particular, the TOFpropane of VOx/θ-Al2O3 and VOx/θ,α-Al2O3 are comparable and are nearly two times higher than that of VOx/γ-Al2O3. The selectivity to propene is over 92 % for all catalysts (Figure S1), similar to results reported by other researches for alumina supported VOx catalysts [13,15,16].

It has been reported that the partly reduced V3+/V4+ species are active sites for non-oxidative dehydrogenation [13,15,50], and thus the chemical state and reduction extent of V would influence the activity of catalysts. As shown in Table 4, The amount of hydrogen consumption for VOx/γ-Al2O3 is 0.44 mmol H2/g, which is less than the theoretical amount needed for the fully reduction of V5+ to V3+. The average oxidation state (AOS) of vanadium estimated based on hydrogen consumption is 4.11 (Table 4), implying the coexistence of V4+ and V3+ species on the surface of catalyst after reduction, in agreements with previous studies [8,52]. It was found that the AOS of VOx decreased with increasing alumina calcination temperature from 4.11 for VOx/γ-Al2O3 to 3.90 for VOx/θ,α-Al2O3 (Table 4). The chemical states of VOx species after H2 reduction were further revealed by XPS analysis. According to the deconvolution results shown in Fig. 6(c) and Table S1, the vanadium oxidation state of all samples after reduction is a mixture of V3+, V4+ and V5+, in consistent with previously reported results [8,52]. The fraction of unreduced V5+ for VOx/γ-Al2O3 is 28.55 %, which is similar to the value obtained on alumina supported VOx by other researchers [52]. The average vanadium oxidation states (AOS) estimated based on deconvolution results show a declining trend with increasing alumina calcination temperature, in accordance with that estimated from H2-TPR. Higher reduction extent of VOx would contribute to more active sites and the increase of TOFpropane. But this factor alone cannot explain the significant enhancement of TOFpropane since the extent of reduction was only slightly increased. The degree of polymerization of VOx species was reported another factor influencing the activity of catalysts, as to dehydrogenation reaction, controversial results were obtained [39,50,53]. In our cases, as shown in Figure S2, the TOFpropane of both VOx/γ-Al2O3 and VOx/θ-Al2O3 follow a decrease trend with increasing V surface density (the degree of polymerization generally increases with V density), in agreement with the observation of Rodemerck et al. [50]. Therefore, the different degree of polymerization of VOx species would not account for the activity enhancements.

As shown in Fig. 6(b), all samples present a single reduction peak in the range of 370−620 °C. It was found that the reduction peak maximum (Tmax) tends to decrease consecutively from 548 °C for VOx/γ-Al2O3 to 536 °C for VOx/δ-Al2O3 and further to 527 °C for VOx/θ-Al2O3, and then shift back slightly to 528 °C for VOx/θ, α-Al2O3. The reducibility of supported VOx species are mainly affected by the VOx-support interactions [8,19,54] and the dispersion of VOx [50,55,56]. It has been shown that higher electron density of V-O-Support bonds correspond to lower electronegativity of support cations, which results in weaker VOx-support interaction and higher reducibility of surface VOx [[57], [58], [59]]. In addition to the nature of cations, the coordination environments of cations also influence their electronegativity [60]. The weaker VOx-support interactions found in alumina calcinated at higher temperature might be caused by the change of coordination environment of Al3+ cations in different transition aluminas-the proportion of tetrahedral/octahedral decreases with increasing alumina calcination temperature [27,32,42,61], which results in the loss of medium to strong acid sites as illustrated by NH3-TPD profiles. As to the effects of VOx dispersion on their reducibility, Kondratenko et al. [50,62]and Guo et al. [14] reported that the isolated V species on silica-based supports were easier to be reduced than more aggregated ones present at higher V loadings. Similar trends were observed for polymerized VOx species supported on alumina, except for the isolated VOx dominated samples because of the strong interaction between isolated VOx and alumina supports [23,63]. Therefore, the increase in reducibility of VOx/Al2O3 is mainly caused by the weakening of VOx-alumina interactions, and the shift of Tmax back to slightly higher values is the consequence of aggregation of VOx species on θ, α-Al2O3 support as illustrated by Raman and UV–vis spectra.
Particularly, as shown in Fig. 6(d), the intrinsic activity of VOx/Al2O3 (TOFpropane) correlates well with their reduction temperature maximums, suggesting that the interactions between VOx-support should be the primary reason for activity enhancements. As discussed above, the coordinative unsaturated VO bonds are active sites for propane activation [1,2], and thus factors influencing the chemical micro-environment of VO bonds would affect their intrinsic activities. Since the proportion of VOV bonds increases with increasing VOx polymerization degree, the lower intrinsic activity of highly polymerized VOx species suggested that the V-O-support bond tends to be more active than VOV bonds in activating propane [50]. As the chemical states of V-O-support bond can be influenced significantly by the nature of supports [8,57], the support can serve as ligands to tune the activity of VO bonds. In our cases, the weakening of VOx-support interactions was achieved by increasing the alumina calcination temperature, which would induce higher polarization of bridge oxygen ions to promote the activation of propane.
For all catalysts, the activity decreases with times on stream because of coke deposition (Figure S1). The stability of VOx/Al2O3 indicated by the remaining activity after reacting three hours firstly decreases and then increases with increasing alumina calcination temperature (Fig. 7(a)), suggesting the different coking behavior of these catalysts. As the coke content of spent catalysts decreases consecutively with alumina calcination temperature (Table S2) and correlates well with their total surface acid sites (Fig. 7(c)), the deviation between catalysts’ stability and coke content might be ether caused by active sites transformation or coke deposition positions. The former factor can be reasonably excluded since the VOx/θ-Al2O3 catalysts exhibits no apparent initial activity loss after four consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles (Fig. 8). Further coking behavior information was provided by TPO experiments, as shown in Fig. 7(b), all samples show two coke burning peaks in TPO profiles. Since cokes around active phases tend to be burned more easily because of catalytic oxidation reactions [64], the lower temperature peak summited at around 380 °C (T1) can be assigned to cokes deposited on or adjacent VOx sites, the higher temperature peak summitted at around 470 °C (T2) can be ascribed to cokes on support. Based on such assignments, the proportion of cokes on different positions were profiled in Table S2, the relationship between the surface specific coke content-cokes on active sites and the edge energy (Eg) of catalysts indicative the population and coordination environment of VOx species was established (Fig. 7(d)). It was found that the fraction of coke on active sites increases with increasing alumina calcination temperature (Table S2), and the surface specific coke content of cokes on active sites increase with decreasing Eg of catalysts, suggesting that more cokes were formed on the surface of VOx sites with higher degree of polymerization (lower edge energies), in agreement with the findings of Rodemerck and Sokolov [16,50] that coking rates increased with the degree of polymerization of VOx species. And thus, the relatively high VOx aggregation degree together with high total acid sites caused the faster deactivation of VOx/δ-Al2O3 catalyst. Therefore, compared with other form of alumina, the θ-Al2O3 with relatively high surface area, weak VOx-support interaction and moderate surface acid sites can serve as potential support for VOx as propane dehydrogenation catalyst.

4. Conclusions
The phase of alumina clearly has an influence the structure and performance of VOx-based catalysts. Four transition aluminas with phases of γ-Al2O3, δ-Al2O3, θ-Al2O3 and θ,α-Al2O3 can be obtained by altering the calcination temperature of boehmite. It was found that the formation of surface VOx species preferentially consumed these medium to strong acid sites of alumina supports. Both the strength and amount of these acid sites decrease with increasing alumina calcination temperature. As a result, the interactions between VOx and support are weakened and the VOx species become more reducible. The relatively weak VOx-support interactions contribute to higher VOx catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation-the intrinsic activity of VOx/θ-Al2O3 is nearly two times that of γ-Al2O3 supported ones. On the other hand, higher degree of polymerization of VOx species was observed on alumina calcinated at higher temperature due to the lower reactivity of surface hydroxyl groups. The coking behavior of VOx species in the present study was found to depend both on total acid sites of fresh catalysts and the aggregation degree of VOx species. Higher calcination temperature of alumina contributes to lower total acid sites but also leads to highly polymerized VOx species favoring coking reaction. Therefore, the VOx-support interactions and the ability to disperse VOx species are critical factors for high performance PDH catalysts, which can be tuned by controlling the calcination temperatures of alumina.
