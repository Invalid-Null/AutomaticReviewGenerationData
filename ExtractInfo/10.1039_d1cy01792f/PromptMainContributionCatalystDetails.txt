Efficient metal borate catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane†
Boron-based catalysts have attracted attention in recent years, due to their high selectivity for light olefins in the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). But they still face drawbacks such as low activity at mild reaction temperature and more or less boron leaching from the catalyst surface during the reaction. Hence, it is necessary to exploit more efficient boron-based catalysts with higher stability. In this study, metal borate catalysts (CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6) were prepared by a co-precipitation method and evaluated for the ODHP. Reaction tests showed that both metal borates could catalyze propane dehydrogenation efficiently at 450–540 °C with high selectivity and stability. In particular, the CoB4O7 catalyst, after activation at 490 °C for 70 h, exhibited rather high stability with propane conversion of 17.6% and an appreciable selectivity for light olefins of 91.4% during the subsequent reaction run. The structural stability and active sites of the metal borate catalysts were investigated by SEM, TEM, XRD, FTIR, ICP-MS and XPS. The results showed that the morphology and crystal structure of the catalysts as well as the composition of bulk and surface elements changed little after reaction, showing excellent structural stability. Besides, the M–B–O (M = Co, Ni) and B–OH species on the catalysts surface were considered to be the active sites, which gradually increased and reached an abundant content without boron leaching during the induction period of the catalysts, affording the high catalytic activity and selectivity for light olefins.
1. Introduction
Propene, one of the most important raw materials in the chemical industry, is widely used as a building block for a vast array of acrylonitrile, polypropene, acrolein, acrylic acid and other fine chemicals.1–4 During recent years, the industrial demand for propene has continued to grow, and is expected to reach 130 million tonnes in 2023.5 But conventional production methods for propene like steam cracking or fluid catalytic cracking need to be conducted under energy-intensive conditions with limited production capacity, which cannot satisfy the expanding demand for propene in the chemical industry. One preferred choice is to increase propene production by the dehydrogenation of propane from abundant and reliable shale gas resources. Normally, the dehydrogenation of propane can be classified into two different methods: direct propane dehydrogenation and oxidative propane dehydrogenation in the presence of oxidants. The direct dehydrogenation of propane is a strongly endothermic process, limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. It requires a much higher reaction temperature to achieve respectable conversion, which is detrimental to propene selectivity and causes rapid deactivation of the catalyst by coking.6,7 Compared with direct propane dehydrogenation, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is an exothermic reaction, which is not limited by thermodynamic equilibrium and exhibits good coking resistance.6,8,9 However, one major obstacle for the industrialization of ODHP is the deep oxidation of propane or the produced propene on the catalyst surface, leading to low propene selectivity with the emission of enormous amounts of carbon dioxide. In the past decade, a large number of catalysts concentrating on metal oxide catalysts like Mo–V–O, VOx/SBA-15, NiO-SPP, have been reported for ODHP.4,6,10 However, the propene selectivity rarely exceeds 50% over the reported metal oxide catalysts due to the over-oxidation of propene to COx. Therefore, researchers have to date made numerous attempts to prepare a highly selective catalyst with low COx by-products for ODHP.
In 2016,11 Hermans and co-workers found that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) exhibited excellent antioxidant performance in the ODHP process. At 14% propane conversion, the light olefin (C2−3) selectivity reached 91% (for propene: 79%, for ethene: 12%), which provided a promising direction for the development of ODHP catalysts. Further research reported that the initial ODHP activity of BN was low and required an activation period to reach a stable performance, and that during the functionalization of the initial BN, nitrogen was gradually substituted by oxygen to form boron oxide species on the surface of the material.12,13 Due to the inert nature of pure h-BN, the formed nascent functional groups (B–O–B and B–OH groups) at the edge were proposed to contribute to the catalytic performance in the ODHP reaction.14,15 The molecular structures of the oxygen-functionalized phases appearing in hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT) after performing ODHP catalytic tests were characterized by spectroscopy.16 The pristine BN material was found to be readily oxidized and hydrolyzed under ODH reaction conditions, producing a phase consisting of triple-liganded boron sites with varying numbers of hydroxyl groups and bridging oxide groups (B2(OH)2xO3−x (x = 0–3)), significant for catalytic activity.17,18 Lu et al. marked the OH formed on the NB surface by isotope labeling, which proved that the B–OH formed on the NB edge was involved in the ODH reaction.19 Venegas et al. observed that the catalyst bed height could be adjusted by mixing SiC into h-BN,20 suggesting that the catalytic activity may originate from the gas-phase oxidation chemistry triggered by catalytic surface reactions. To test this hypothesis, Kraus et al. confirmed that gas-phase chemistry was the main driver of catalytic performance by modeling the microkinetics of h-BN catalytic systems.21
Lately, different types of nitrogen-free boron-based materials, such as B4C, TiB2, NiB, B2O3/SiO2 and BPO4,8,9,14,22–24 have been successively reported to exhibit similar surface species, kinetic behaviour, and product distribution to h-BN due to the presence of an active oxidized boron layer in the ODHP reaction, which further confirms that the active center of ODHP in boron-based materials comes from the “BO” component.24 Therefore, boron-rich oxides may have potential for the preparation of efficient catalysts used in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Supported boron oxide catalysts can provide abundant “BO” sites on the surface, and exhibit high activity in ODHP.17,18,25 It has been reported that B2O3 impregnation on conventional three-dimensional porous supports,9,26,27 such as TiO2, SiO2 and Al2O3, could enhance the abundance of “BO” sites on the catalyst surface for the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. However, under the higher reaction temperature (mostly >450 °C) normally used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, the above catalysts may suffer from insufficient stability due to the low melting point of boron oxide (∼450 °C),12,22 easily causing its liquefaction on the catalyst surface, weakening the interaction force between boron oxide and the carrier and even leading to the loss of boron.23,26,27 So, it is still necessary to develop more stable boron-containing catalysts with excellent olefin selectivity.
With this consideration in mind, we prepared metal borate oxides, with an emphasis on CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6 using a facile co-precipitation calcination method, which were firstly evaluated in a fixed-bed reactor for ODHP. The results showed that these metal borate oxides exhibited excellent low-temperature catalytic activity with high olefin selectivity, especially the CoB4O7 catalyst, which could achieve 11.5% conversion of propane with 94.0% total olefin selectivity (propene: 82.4%, ethene: 11.6%) at 490 °C. In addition, the structure–performance relationship of the catalysts was further discussed using various techniques. The FTIR and XPS results indicated that the B–OH and M–B–O (M = Co, Ni) species in metal borate oxides may serve as the active sites for ODHP, which favours effective propane conversion to propene with good stability under mild reaction conditions.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals
The cobalt(ii) nitrate hexahydrate and nickel(ii) nitrate hexahydrate used in this work were of analytical grade. The ammonium hydrogen borate trihydrate was chemically pure. All chemicals used in this work were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.
2.2. Synthesis of CoB4O7
CoB4O7 was synthesized by co-precipitation.28,29 First, 10.8 g of cobalt(ii) nitrate hexahydrate and 17.1 g of ammonium hydrogen borate trihydrate were mixed and dissolved in 150 mL of deionized water, and then vigorously stirred at room temperature for 6 hours to obtain a precipitate. The precipitate was centrifuged, washed, dried, and finally calcined at 550 °C in air for 4 h to obtain the final material, which is denoted CoB4O7.
2.3. Synthesis of Ni3B2O6
Ni3B2O6 was synthesized by co-precipitation.30 First, 19.5 g of nickel(ii) nitrate hexahydrate and 15.3 g of ammonium hydrogen borate trihydrate were mixed and dissolved in 150 mL of deionized water, and then vigorously stirred at room temperature for 6 hours to obtain a precipitate. The precipitate was centrifuged, washed, dried, and finally calcined at 650 °C in air for 4 h to obtain the final material, which is denoted Ni3B2O6.
2.4. Catalytic tests
The catalysts were tested in a quartz tube fixed bed reactor (8 mm inner diameter) with a heating length of 20 cm at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst (200 mg, 80 mesh) and inert quartz (400 mg, 80 mesh) were fully mixed and loaded into the center of the reactor. Inert quartz (600 mg, 80 mesh) was used as a blank contrast in the experiment. The catalyst bed was 1.5 cm in height, with a porosity of 0.4 and a tortuosity of 4, supported by a quartz cotton layer with height of 4 cm. The temperature of the catalyst bed (range 450–540 °C) was controlled by a thermocouple that was inserted into the centre. The feed gas consisted of C3H8/O2/N2 (volume ratio of 5/2/8) with a fixed flow rate of 30 mL min−1 (WHSV was 5.9 gC3H8 gcat−1 h−1). The inlet feed gas temperature was room temperature and the outlet tail gas was at 0 °C. The tail gas composition was analysed with a gas chromatograph (Haixin, GC 950) fitted with TCD and FID detectors. Porapak Q and 5A molecular sieve columns, connected to the TCD, were used for the analysis of O2, N2, CH4, C3H6, CO, and CO2. A Porapak Q column linked to the FID was used for the analysis of C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, and CH4. The sampling analysis was performed after the reaction run for about 30 min. The C3H8 conversion (X) and product selectivity (S) were calculated by a standard normalization method based on carbon atom balance, as defined below.

2.5. Characterization
The morphology, structure and surface element distribution of the samples were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-7001F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (JW-BK200) were combined with the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model to compute specific surface area and pore size distribution. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were carried out on a D8 Advance Bruker instrument (40 kV, 40 mA) to analyse the crystallinity. The scanning range was 10–90° with a scanning step of 0.3°. Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS, Thermo ICAP PRO) was applied to measure the elemental content. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, VERTEX 70) was applied to characterize the functional groups on the surface of the samples in the wave number range from 4000 cm−1 to 500 cm−1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was conducted on an ESCALAB 250Xi photoelectron spectrometer. The binding of the elements was calibrated with the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. 11B MAS-NMR spectra were measured using a Bruker Avance III 600 MHz spectrometer with a 14.1 T magnet. The spectra were obtained by employing a 4 mm MAS-NMR probe with a rotation rate of 10 kHz. The H2-TPR test was executed on a Builder PCA-1200. A 30 mg sample was packed into a quartz reactor and purged at room temperature with 5% H2/N2 (flow rate 30 mL min−1) until a stable baseline was reached, followed by a rise in temperature from 25 °C to 900 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1, and the exhaust gas was detected by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The zeta potential was measured with a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS90. The temperature-programmed desorption of O2 (O2-TPD) was conducted in a quartz reactor. Tail gas chemistry was measured by an on-line mass spectrometer (MS, InProcess Instruments GMA 200). The catalyst (600 mg) was loaded into the reactor with pure O2 with 30 mL min−1 flow for 1 h at 100 °C, and then physisorbed O2 molecules were eliminated through argon flowing for 1 h. Subsequently, the measurement was carried out from 100 to 800 °C with a heating ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 under argon flow of 40 mL min−1. Finally, the tail gas signals were traced and recorded with a mass spectrometer (O2, m/z = 32). C3H8/C3H6-pulse oxidative dehydrogenation (C3H8/C3H6-pulse) used the same instruments as O2-TPD. The catalyst (200 mg) was loaded into the reactor and a fixed flow rate of nitrogen–oxygen mixture (O2 20%, N2 80%, 30 mL min−1) was introduced at 540 °C until baseline stabilization. Then, C3H8 or C3H6 (3 mL) was injected into the reactor at 10 min intervals. Finally, the tail gas signals were traced and recorded with a mass spectrometer. The m/z signals of 44, 15, 25, 16 represent C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, CO, respectively.
3. Results and discussions
3.1. Structural characterization of the catalysts
The crystalline structures of the CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6 samples were characterized by XRD (see Fig. 1). For the CoB4O7 sample, the characteristic diffraction peaks were observed at 2θ = 16.3°, 16.9°, 21.6°, 21.9°, 24.2°, 28.4°, 30.5°, and 31.2°, assigned to the CoB4O7 crystal.28,31,32 As for the Ni3B2O6 sample, the diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 22.6°, 25.9°, 28.0°, 33.1°, 33.8°, 38.9°, and 39.9° are attributed to Ni3B2O6 (JCPDS# 22-0745) crystals.33 No obvious diffraction peaks of B2O3, Co3O2 or NiO were detected over the two catalysts. By further analyzing the XRD patterns of the CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6 samples using the Rietveld method with GSAS fitting software34 and the crystal model file from the Crystallography Open Database, we obtained the fitting results for CoB4O7: Rwp = 6.3%, Rp = 4.8%, χ2 = 1.6 and for Ni3B2O6: Rwp = 8.1%, Rp = 6.1%, χ2 = 3.9 (see Fig. S1†). This indicates that the two catalysts were successfully synthesized with high degrees of crystallinity and purity.
Fig. 1 XRD spectra of the catalysts.
The morphology and composition of the catalysts were determined via SEM, TEM and EDS mapping. From the SEM images (see Fig. 2), it could be seen that the as-prepared CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6 samples exhibited an irregular porous foam structure and a flake morphology, respectively. The TEM images (see Fig. 3(a) and (b)) further displayed that the CoB4O7 sample possessed a honeycomb-shaped structure with pore sizes ranging from 50 to 200 nm, while the Ni3B2O6 sample presented nano-disk-shaped particles with a size of ∼5 μm. The distinct lattice fringes of the samples could also be observed from the magnification of the TEM images in Fig. 3(b) and (e), indicating the high crystallinity of the synthesized CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6 samples. This coincided well with the above XRD results. From the EDS mapping (Fig. 3(c) and (f)), the B, O, Co or Ni elements were uniformly distributed over the CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6 samples.

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and the textural properties of the catalysts are shown in Fig. S2† and summarized in Table 1. The synthesized CoB4O7 sample exhibited a much higher specific surface area of 18.21 m2 g−1 than the Ni3B2O6 catalyst (3.56 m2 g−1), probably related to the discrepancy in microstructures of the catalysts. From the isotherms of the two borates (Fig. S2†), the CoB4O7 sample exhibited a type-II adsorption isotherm pattern with an H3 type hysteresis loop at relative pressures ranging from 0.8 to 1.0 and a small H2 hysteresis loop in the range of 0.2 to 0.8. The former marked the formation of large pores in the material, and the latter indicated the presence of mesopores in the CoB4O7 skeleton.35 The pore sizes were predominantly distributed in the range of 50–200 nm and only a few pore distributions were in the range of 2–10 nm (see Fig. S2(a)†). Similarly, the isotherms of the Ni3B2O6 catalyst exhibited a type-II adsorption curve (Fig. S2(b)†), but with small H3 and H2 hysteresis loops in the relative pressure range of 0.2 to 1.0, indicating a minimal number of pores, which is consistent with the TEM results.

3.2. Catalytic performance
The catalytic performances of CoB4O7, Ni3B2O6 and pure quartz in the ODHP reaction were evaluated and are depicted in Fig. 4(a) and S3.† Pure quartz showed negligible C3H8 conversion (0.3%) and high CO2 selectivity (18.0%) at 540 °C. The low reactivity of pure quartz indicated that it was inert towards the ODHP reaction. When CoB4O7 or Ni3B2O6 catalysts were mixed in quartz, the performances were significantly improved in the reaction temperature range (450–540 °C). In particular, the CoB4O7 catalyst showed a remarkable catalytic performance with 2.6% propane conversion at low temperature (450 °C). Upon increasing the temperature to 520 °C, the propane conversion could reach 21.8%. Compared with the CoB4O7 catalyst, the catalytic activity of the Ni3B2O6 catalyst was lower at the same reaction temperature. One possible reason for this result is that the CoB4O7 catalyst has a larger specific surface area than the Ni3B2O6 catalyst, which facilitates the exposure of more active centres. The reaction products include C3H6, C2H4, CH4, CO, and a very small amount of CO2 (<1%) over the catalysts. Among them, the selectivity for light olefins (C2−3) decreased slightly with increasing propane conversion, but still remained above 85% on both borate catalysts (Fig. 4(b)). By comparing the two catalysts, it can be observed that the selectivity for light olefins at the same propane conversion is higher over the CoB4O7 catalyst than over the Ni3B2O6 catalyst (Fig. 4(b)). Specifically, the selectivity for light olefins was 94.0% (propene: 82.4%, ethene: 11.6%) at 11.5% propane conversion over the former catalyst, in comparison with that of 91.3% (propene: 74.7%, ethene: 16.8%) at a similar propane conversion over the latter one (Fig. 4(c)). This was due to the fact that the CoB4O7 catalyst has a larger pore structures that improves the mass transfer efficiency during the reaction, reducing the settling time of propane on the active sites as well as promoting the rapid desorption of olefin products. Consequently, the deep oxidation of the olefins by oxygen or cracking propane to produce more C1 (CO, CO2 and CH4,) could be avoided.

Further, the stability of the CoB4O7 catalyst was tested at a constant reaction temperature of 490 °C for 200 h (Fig. 5(a)). It could be seen that the propane conversion gradually increased from 9.6% to 17.6% during the first 70 h of the reaction run, and then retained a stable value (∼17.6%) in the subsequent measurement. However, the olefin selectivity became fixed at ∼91.4% and changed little during the whole evaluation process. A similar phenomenon was also observed in the stability test of the Ni3B2O6 catalyst, where the propane conversion increased from 6.8% to 13.5% during the first 140 h run and then remained at ∼13.5% under continuous operation (Fig. 5(b)), while the olefin selectivity remained at ∼91.5%. Thus, it could be inferred that the CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6 catalysts showed excellent stability. These results indicated that both borate catalysts require a long activation period to fully develop their catalytic activity, during which the catalyst might interact with the generated water to produce the active B–OH sites on the surface to enhance the catalyst activity.19 Compared with several representative catalysts reported in the literature (Table S1†), the product distribution on the CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6 catalysts was similar to that of reported boron-based catalysts, but our metal borate catalysts possessed higher activity at significantly lower reaction temperature, probably due to the more abundant BOx component in metal borate and the synergistic effect between metal and boron.

3.3. Structural stability and active sites of the catalysts
The structural stability of the catalysts was characterized using various techniques, including TEM, XRD, FTIR, NMR, ICP-MS, H2-TPR and XPS. From the TEM images (Fig. S4(a)–(d)†), both the spent CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6 catalysts still maintained the same framework structure and morphology as the fresh ones after 10 h of reaction, implying the excellent structural thermal stability of the samples. Furthermore, the characteristic crystal peaks in the XRD pattern of the spent CoB4O7 (Fig. S5(a)†) were identical to those of the fresh counterpart, indicating that the crystal structure of the macroporous CoB4O7 changed little during ODHP. Unlike the CoB4O7 catalyst, the spent Ni3B2O6 catalyst exhibited diffraction peaks attributable to B2O3 crystals at 2θ = 23.7°, 26.0° and 53.5° while keeping the original Ni3B2O6 crystal phase peaks (Fig. S5(b)†). Besides, no diffraction peak of NiO was observed over the catalyst. This result implied that trace amounts of amorphous B2O3 species might be present on the Ni3B2O6 surface, which liquefied and migrated during the reaction. When the reaction temperature reduced below 450 °C, the molten liquefied boron oxide droplets would gather and solidify to form a crystalline phase. This might be the cause of B2O3 particles agglomerating, as detected by XRD for the spent catalyst. The above results indicated that the CoB4O7 sample has superior crystal stability in comparison with the Ni3B2O6 catalyst.
Previous literature on boron oxide materials also showed that the boron element, especially at relatively high concentrations, would be leached during high-temperature treatment.23,27 Since CoB4O7 has superior crystal stability, we compared the boron and cobalt contents of fresh and spent CoB4O7 samples (after 10 h of reaction) by ICP-MS (Fig. 6). It could be seen that the boron and cobalt contents of the CoB4O7 catalyst hardly changed after 10 h of catalytic test. This connoted the presence of a strong binding ability between cobalt and boron, which suppressed the leaching of boron from the catalyst surface.
Fig. 6 Summary of ICP-MS elemental analysis results for fresh and spent CoB4O7 catalysts.
The FTIR spectra of both CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6 samples are displayed in Fig. 7. The absorption peaks between 1100 and 800 cm−1 are the typical tetrahedral borate BO4-groups.36–38 Strong absorption bands were observed between 1450 and 1200 cm−1 and below 800 cm−1, characteristic of triangular BO3-groups.32,36 The bands at 647, 659 and 831 cm−1 were ascribed to OB3. In addition, the small peaks around 1186 and 3227 cm−1 are attributed to B–OH.23,39 Such B–O and B–OH species could be considered as active species in the ODHP reaction, as reported previously.9,39
Fig. 7 FTIR spectra of the catalysts.
To further investigate the effect of different types and contents of boron species in the ODHP reaction, 11B MAS-NMR experiments were carried out on the synthesized catalyst in Fig. 7. The 11B 1D MAS-NMR spectra were fitted by using DMfit software to classify and quantify the boron species into tri- and tetra-coordinated ([3]B and [4]B) forms,40–43 where the B species were mainly dispersed on the surface as [3]B (Table S2†). Previous reports suggested the catalytic activity of boron-based catalysts in the ODHP reaction was mainly related to the [3]B species.9,44 The [3]B peak could be further decomposed into two peaks at ∼14 and ∼18 ppm chemical shifts (Fig. 8), assigned to the [3]B non-ring and [3]B boroxol-ring species,40,45–47 respectively. Typically the [3]B boroxol ring is correlated with the number of boron hydroxyl groups, which is generally considered to be the terminal boron species (–OB–OH) produced by condensation of B(OH)3 species during high-temperature calcination.44[3]B non-ring sites were associated with the framework structure and the peak at around 0 ppm was accordingly assigned to the BO4 tetrahedral framework.9,44 From the 11B NMR results, it can be observed that the types of B species in both borates are similar, which is consistent with the results obtained by FTIR. But the content of each B species in the two catalysts was obviously different. Specifically, the content of [3]B boroxol ring over the fresh CoB4O7 catalyst was higher than that over the fresh Ni3B2O6 catalyst. Furthermore, the content of [3]B boroxol ring species increased and the [3]B non-ring species decreased over the CoB4O7 catalyst after 10 h of reaction (see Fig. S6†). Considering that the propane conversion increased during the initial reaction time, as shown in the stability test of the catalyst (Fig. 5(a)), it can be inferred that the increasing amount of [3]B boroxol ring species may also enhance the catalyst activity in the ODHP reaction. This result further confirmed the correlation between the [3]B boroxol ring species and propane conversion, as reported previously.9,44

H2 programmed temperature reduction (H2-TPR) was used to investigate the interaction between metal and boron in borates compared to their corresponding metal oxides like Co2O3 and NiO (see Fig. 9). For pure Co2O3 and NiO samples, the two hydrogen consumption peaks were observed in the 250–550 °C temperature range, which correspond to the Co3+ → Co2+ (or Ni3+ → Ni2+) and Co2+ → Co0 (or Ni2+ → Ni0) reduction peaks,48,49 respectively. Notably, the reduction temperatures of the metal borates (CoB4O7, Ni3B2O6) sharply shifted to higher temperatures (700–800 °C) compared to the corresponding metal oxides due to the relatively strong interaction between metal and boron. This made the metal borate catalysts more resistant to hydrogen reduction compared to their oxide counterparts, which inhibited the ability to shift lattice oxygen in the catalyst from the bulk phase to the surface, avoiding the involvement of lattice oxygen in the ODHP reaction and thus weakening the over-oxidation process.3 In addition, the strong interaction between metal and boron also guaranteed the relative stability of the structure and crystalline phase of the borate catalyst during the ODHP reaction.
Fig. 9 H2-TPR profiles of CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6 catalyst.
To further determine the active site, the chemical states of the borate catalyst before and after the reaction were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The surface concentrations of boron, oxygen and cobalt (or nickel) of the fresh CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6 catalysts were 41.6%, 53.4% and 5.0% (or 42.1%, 53.6% and 4.3%), respectively. And it is noteworthy that the surface elemental composition of the spent catalysts, especially the CoB4O7 catalysts, showed no obvious change compared to the fresh counterpart (Table S3†), indicating that the borate catalysts can effectively inhibit the loss of surface boron. The Co 2p3/2 spectra of the CoB4O7 catalyst exhibit two-characteristic peaks located at 782.0 and 780.5 eV (Fig. 10(a)), corresponding to Co2+ and Co3+,50 respectively. As shown in the Ni 2p3/2 region of the Ni3B2O6 catalyst (Fig. 10(b)), two peaks located at 854.7 and 855.8 eV were observed, assigned to Ni2+ and Ni3+,3 respectively. The high valence state of Co or Ni ions in metal borates implied that the metal atoms could provide electrons to the adjacent B-atoms. Furthermore, it could be noted that the peaks of the samples corresponding to Co2+, Co3+ and Ni 2p were upshifted by 0.3–0.4 eV after 10 h of ODHP reaction, indicating that the interaction of metal ions with boron was further enhanced during the reaction.10

The O 1s spectra of the CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6 catalysts in Fig. 10(d) can be fitted into three peaks at 530.5, 531.5 and 532.4 eV, associated with the metal oxygen (M–O), substituted hydroxyl species (OH) and boron oxygen (B–O).51,52 From Table S4,† the proportion of metal oxygen over the CoB4O7 catalyst shows no observable change after the reaction. Unlike CoB4O7, the proportion of metal oxygen on the Ni3B2O6 catalyst increased significantly after 10 h of operation. Considering that the content of Ni on the surface of the sample increased after the reaction, it is speculated that this is probably due to Ni3B2O6 decomposition producing highly dispersed NiO on the surface, leading to an increase in the proportion of lattice oxygen on the surface of the Ni3B2O6 catalyst. However, the ratios of OH and B–O on the surfaces of both borates changed markedly, exhibiting an increased proportion of OH and a decreased proportion of B–O. In previous reports on boron-based catalysts it was mentioned that during the ODHP reaction B–O interacts with the product water to produce B–OH,9,19 which was supposed to correspond to the catalytic activity of boron-based catalysts, and our experimental results are consistent with these findings.
The XPS spectra of the B 1s region of the CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6 catalysts are shown in Fig. 10(c). The B atom contents on the catalyst surface were calculated to be about 41.6% and 42.1% (Table S3†), respectively. The B 1s spectra can be decomposed into two peaks at 191.5 and 192.5 eV, attributed to M–B–O (M = Co, Ni) and B–O species,52 respectively. The M–B–O site has a higher electron density than the B–O site, because boron can extract electrons from the adjacent metal. The presence of excess electron density could be predicted to interfere with the binding strength of B 1s electrons and transfer the binding energy to a lower value.8 Previous reports indicated that negative surface charge was conducive to the adsorption of O2 and further promoted the activation of O2 (surface charge density, and O2 adsorption capacity are discussed next).1,53 The contents of M–B–O surface boron species were 70.3% in CoB4O7 and 60.1% in Ni3B2O6, which increased to 73.1% and 70.7% in the spent counterparts (Table S4†). Since the elemental boron content on the surface of the borate catalyst did not change before and after the reaction (Table S3†), the increase in the M–B–O component content after the reaction might be caused by the transformation of the B–O to the M–B–O component during the reaction. Combined with the results of the gradually increasing propane conversion during the induction period of CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6 catalysts (Fig. 5(a) and (b)), we presumed that propane conversion is related to the transformation of the B–O to the M–B–O component on the surface of both borate catalysts during the reaction.
In order to further investigate the metal–boron interaction and its binding ability to oxygen, we performed zeta potential and O2-TPD measurements for the CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6 catalysts. The zeta potential results of CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6 (in Fig. S9†) were 6.31 mV and 9.65 mV, respectively. After 10 h of ODHP reaction, the zeta potential of the CoB4O7 material decreased to −1.26 mV, and that of the Ni3B2O6 material decreased to 5.90 mV. Meanwhile, we observed a marked increase in propane conversion after 20 h. This result may indicate that the enhanced interaction between metal and boron on the material surface promotes the activity of the catalyst during the reaction.
The O2-TPD results are shown in Fig. 11. Both CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6 detected O2 desorption signals in the range of 600–800 °C, indicating that there was a strong interaction between the two materials and O2. However, the adsorption strength and adsorption capacity of the former were stronger than those of the latter, indicating that the negative charge could promote the adsorption and binding ability of borate to O2. Based on previous reports,18,54 the dissociative adsorption of O2 on the sample readily formed highly reactive BO* on the surface, and then rapidly interacted with propane to generate propyl radicals, and further dehydrogenation to propene. By comparing the performance of the two catalysts, it could be clearly observed that the conversion of propane on CoB4O7 was higher than that on Ni3B2O6 at the same temperature. This result implied that the negative surface charge facilitated the adsorption and further activation of O2, which can effectively enhance the ODHP reaction performance.

C3H8/C3H6-pulse oxidative dehydrogenation was carried out to investigate the oxidative capacity of the CoB4O7 catalyst for propene. In the presence of oxygen, C3H8 pulses were fed into the reactor and contacted with the catalyst at 520 °C, when the signals of C3H6, C2H4 and CO were immediately detected (Fig. 12(a)). When C3H6 pulses were fed into the reactor, only signals of C3H6 were observed and no obvious signals of C2H4 and CO were observed (Fig. 12(b)), indicating that the CoB4O7 catalyst has favourable oxidative dehydrogenation performance for propane, while oxidation of propene was inhibited. Lin's team performed temperature-programmed oxidation of propene over a supported boron oxide catalyst and showed that under high-temperature conditions C3H6 and O2 can coexist.55 From this, it could be considered that the over-oxidation of propene on the CoB4O7 catalyst was negligible, so it is inferred that the over-oxidation probably occurred during the transition from propane to propene. Furthermore, it was observed that the carbon molar ratio of C2/C1 (C2 represents ethene, C1 includes CH4, CO, and CO2) products was about 2 in the product distribution of the two catalysts, suggesting that the radical was produced from propane cracking and further oxidized by O2 to produce COx during the reaction. Inhibition of the over-oxidation of propene may be the key factor for the high olefin selectivity that can be obtained by the borate catalyst in the ODPH process.

Conclusions
In summary, two novel metal borate catalysts (CoB4O7 and Ni3B2O6) were synthesized by a co-precipitation method. The catalysts showed high catalytic activity, olefin selectivity and stability in the temperature range of 450–540 °C for propane oxidative dehydrogenation. In particular, the CoB4O7 catalyst displayed 17.6% propane conversion and 91.4% selectivity for light olefin at 490 °C and no deactivation occurred during a long-term test of 200 h for propane oxidative dehydrogenation. Structural characterization revealed that both catalysts (notably CoB4O7) exhibited remarkable structural stability, which can effectively inhibit boron leaching compared with a supported boron-based catalyst.23,26,27 Moreover, the M–B–O and B–OH surface species incorporated in the framework were responsible for catalyzing the ODHP and inhibiting the excessive oxidation of olefins, which brought about the high olefin selectivity. Combining the synergetic effect of the metal and born components, this study offers a new strategic approach for the design of novel boron-based catalysts for use in propane oxidative dehydrogenation.
