Based on my review, the supplied document does not directly pertain to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation for converting propane to propylene. The document focuses on analyzing the reaction mechanisms and developing a kinetic model for propane dehydrogenation on Pd and Pd alloy catalysts using density functional theory calculations and microkinetic modeling. While it provides useful insights into selectivity trends, it does not report any specific experimental results on a novel catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. Therefore, I do not have the relevant details to extract about catalyst composition, conversion, selectivity, stability, etc. as requested.
