The supplied document does not appear to be relevant, as it does not discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically for the conversion of propane to propylene. The document focuses on density functional theory (DFT) calculations and microkinetic modeling to analyze propane dehydrogenation reaction mechanisms and selectivity trends on Pd-In alloy surfaces. While it provides useful computational insights, the document does not present experimental results for a specific PDH/ODH catalyst.
