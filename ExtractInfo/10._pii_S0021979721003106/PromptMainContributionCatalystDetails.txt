AbstractAbstract
The “active site isolation” strategy has been proved to be efficient for enhancing the catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation (PDH). Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere. This catalyst possesses exceptional catalytic performance for PDH with the propane conversion of 40% and the propene selectivity of >97%, and no apparent deactivation is observed after 10 h PDH reaction at 600 °C. With intensive characterizations and experiments, it is indicated that the real active sites of CoOx@NC/S-1 are isolated CoO sites during the PDH process. In situ FT-IR spectroscopy shows the same intermediate product (Co-C3H7) during both propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation, indicating that they have a reverse reaction process, and a reaction mechanism for PDH is proposed accordingly.

1. Introduction
Propene is a vital commodity chemical for producing a wide range of products such as propylene oxide, polypropylene and acrylonitrile [1], [2], [3], [4]. The growing demand for propene and the increasing reserve of propane from shale-gas deposits are drawing attention to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Commercial PDH processes operate at temperatures above 500 °C and are generally based on the Catofin process with Cr/Al2O3 catalyst and the Oleflex process with PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst [1], [2]. However, the severe toxicity of Cr and the high price of Pt greatly restrict the further development of the PDH industry, and the demand for new catalysts is increasingly urgent.
Cobalt-based catalysts have been shown to be promising for PDH, and the earth abundance of element Co bodes well for long-term utility [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. In recent years, Co species supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 have been reported to be active for propane dehydrogenation, but the selectivity of propene is not optimistic [16], [17], [18]. Li et al. reported that the “surface Co spinel” formed by the tetracoordinated Co(II) sites on Al2O3 support under reaction condition was accounted for catalyzing PDH reaction, while large metallic Co particles formed by the reduction of Co3O4 crystallites during PDH were conducive to cracking reaction [19]. Apparently, these catalysts contain multiple active sites, which are not necessarily the ideal active sites for PDH process, especially when the valence state of these nanoclusters changes during the catalytic reaction. Besides, the catalyst containing multiple active centers can easily catalyze structure-sensitive side reactions, including deep dehydrogenation and cracking [13].
The “active site isolation” strategy has been proved to be effective to tackle this challenge, and a variety of strategies for site isolation have been developed [20], [21], [22]. Hu et al. synthesized tetrahedral Co2+ supported on silica by grafting CoIII(NH3)6Cl3 from ammonium hydroxide solution, which was highly selective toward propene [23]. Copéret et al. prepared isolated cobalt oxide on a silica surface by surface organometallic chemistry method, which also showed high selectivity for propene [24]. However, the propane conversion was severely decreased due to the high surface free energy of the isolated Co sites [23], [24]. Since the thermodynamically isolated cobalt oxides are unstable, they would grow during the catalytic reactions (especially at high temperatures). Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new method that can isolate metal species and protect the isolated metal species to prevent their aggregation effectively.
Recently, confining the isolated metal sites in N-doped carbon materials has been widely utilized to enhance the stability of metal species in heterogeneous catalysis [25], [26], [27], [28]. As is well-known, zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIFs), a subclass of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), are composed of metal-containing nodes and organic linkers, which have been considered as suitable precursors for the synthesis of metal sites confined in N-doped carbon by pyrolysis [29], [30], [31], [32]. In addition, if we can introduce the secondary metal atoms to the ZIFs, the spatial distance between the metal sites can be adjusted due to the coordination environment provided by the organic linker. Subsequently, the secondary metals are selectively removed in situ, and isolated metal sites confined in N-doped carbon materials can be synthesized during the pyrolysis process [33], [34], [35], [36]. Nevertheless, there is no report on the N-doped carbon materials encaged isolated metal sites catalyst applied for PDH with excellent propene selectivity and catalytic stability, not mention to the study of the active sites and reaction mechanism of Co species for PDH reaction.
Herein, spatially isolated cobalt oxide sites within nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) layers supported on silicalite-1 zeolite (S-1, MFI zeotype) were synthesized by a two-step process consisting of the pyrolysis of bimetallic Zn/Co zeolitic imidazole frameworks loaded on silicalite-1 (ZnCo-ZIF/S-1) under N2 and the subsequent calcination in air atmosphere. The resultant CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst shows a propane conversion of 40% with the propene selectivity of 97%, and the propane conversion does not decrease significantly after a 10 h PDH reaction at 600 °C. The active sites of CoOx@NC/S-1 for PDH were verified by a series of techniques of H2 temperature-programmed reduction, Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet–visible spectra and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In order to understand the mechanism of PDH on the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst, propane dehydrogenation and its microscopic reverse process (propene hydrogenation) were investigated using in situ FT-IR.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Material synthesis
All chemicals and materials were received from commercial sources and used without further purification. Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), tetrapropylammonium hydroxide solution (TPAOH, 25 wt%), Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and 2-methylimidazole were purchased from Beijing Inno Chem. Co. Al2O3 and SiO2 were obtained from Tianjin Shenneng Sci-Tech Co., Ltd.
Silicalite-1 zeolite was prepared according to the reported procedure [37], [38]. ZnCo-ZIF/S-1 sample was prepared by introducing the metal precursor onto the silicalite-1 using the wet impregnation method. Typically, 0.5 g of silicalite-1 was dispersed in 25 mL methanol under agitating and ultrasound conditions to form a milk-white suspension. Then the methanol solution of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (50 mL, 0.084 M) and methanol solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (50 mL, 0.336 M) were added into the above milk-white mixture under agitating at 25 °C for 1 h. Afterwards, the methanol solution of 2-methylimidazole (125 mL, 0.16 M) was added to the above solution and stirred at 25 °C for 24 h. The resultant mixture was centrifuged, washed three times with deionized water and ethanol, and then dried at 100 °C for 12 h, which was labeled as ZnCo-ZIF/S-1. For reference, ZnCo-ZIF sample was synthesized as similar to the above process without the addition of silicalite-1.
CoOx@NC/S-1(4) (4 represents the molar ratio of Zn and Co) was fabricated through the carbonization process of ZnCo-ZIF/S-1 in N2 atmosphere at 850 °C for 2 h with a 5 °C min−1 heating rate, and the subsequent calcination in air at 300 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1. A series of CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts with different Zn/Co molar ratios were also synthesized by the same synthetic strategy. Moreover, Co/S-1 sample was prepared by the incipient wetness co-impregnation method, as shown in the Supporting Information. For comparison, bulk Co3O4, Co/SiO2 and Co/Al2O3 samples were also synthesized by the similar preparation method as Co/S-1 sample.
2.2. Catalysts characterization
X-ray diffraction patterns (XRD) were obtained on a Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray excitation source. All the spectra were calibrated against the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV. Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet–visible (DR UV–vis) spectra of the selected samples were obtained on a Shimadzu UV2450 spectrometer. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy were carried out on a Jeol JEM-2800 microscope at 200 kV.
H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were conducted on a Quantachrome CHEMBET3000 analyzer. Before the TPR experiments, the sample was degassed at 400 °C for 1 h under a He stream (20 mL min−1). After the sample was cooled to 50 °C, the sample was purged with 10% H2/Ar (20 mL min−1) and subsequently heated to 700 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The profile was recorded using the thermal conductivity detector.
Temperature-programmed desorption of propene (C3H6-TPD) experiments were also conducted on the Quantachrome CHEMBET3000 analyzer. 150 mg of the sample was degassed in He stream (20 mL min−1) at 400 °C for 2 h. Subsequently, the catalyst was cooled to 80 °C and the gas flow was switched to 20 mL/min of propene (99.99%) for 30 min. The physically adsorbed propene was removed by purging 20 mL/min of He for 30 min. The sample was heated to 700 °C with a rate of 10 °C min−1, and the profile of desorbed propene was recorded.
In situ Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were conducted using KBr for the background spectrum on a BRUKER TENSOR II. Two main experiments were carried out with propane and propene as raw materials. All samples were degassed at 500 °C for 0.5 h under a 10% H2/Ar flow (20 mL min−1) and cooled to 30 °C to obtain the background spectrum, which was then subtracted from each measured sample spectrum. For propane adsorption, the procedure contained the following steps: (1) guiding the 5% C3H8/He to the sample cell and keeping it at 30 °C for 30 min; (2) raising the temperature to 300 °C and keeping it for 60 min; (3) closing the C3H8/He and lowering the temperature to 30 °C, and keeping it for 30 min. For propene adsorption, the procedure contained the following steps: (1) adsorbing 5% C3H6/He for 30 min; (2) heating the sample to 300° C under 10% H2/Ar, and maintaining it for 30 min; (3) evacuating the sample and lowering the temperature to 30 °C, and keeping it for 30 min.
2.3. Catalytic PDH evaluation
All the PDH tests were carried out on a quartz fixed-bed microreactor (5 mm i.d.). Before the experiment, all samples were ground and sieved to particle sizes of 0.2–0.4 mm. Then, 0.1–0.2 g of sample was loaded into the quartz microreactor. The reaction gas mixture was passed through the fixed-bed microreactor. Finally, the outlet reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (GC, SP-6890) equipped with a GDX-01 column and a flame ionization detector (FID). The propane conversion, propene selectivity and propene formation rate were calculated according to the carbon atom balance method. The carbon balance of all experiments is above 95%.

The turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated based on all the Co atoms when the conversion rate of propane is lower than 15%. This calculation method has been widely applied in many other works [39], [40]. The apparent activation energy (Ea) was measured at a series of temperatures below 10% propane conversion by using the Arrhenius curve.

The effects of mass and heat transports on the reactions were checked in Fig. S1. The results show that the influences of external mass and heat transport can be eliminated, and the experiments are carried out in the proper kinetically-controlled regime.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Material construction and characterization
Given the zinc ions (Zn2+) and cobalt ions (Co2+) have the same coordination geometry with 2-methylimidazole for the formation of Zn/Co bimetallic ZIF (ZnCo-ZIF), a series of ZnCo-ZIF materials with different Zn/Co molar ratios were prepared. The intentional addition of Zn2+ can occupy the position of Co2+ and serve as a “fence” to further expand the adjacent distances of Co atoms. The schematic diagram of the synthesis process of CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst is presented in Scheme 1. During the whole synthesis process, Zn2+ and Co2+ were first grafted on the silanols of S-1 zeolite. Subsequently, ZnCo-ZIF/S-1 was formed by coordination of the above metal species with 2-methylimidazole. As shown in Fig. 1, the diffraction patterns of ZnCo-ZIF are consistent with that of ZIF-67 reported in literatures [27], [28], illustrating that the addition of Zn2+ does not affect the crystallization of ZIF-67. For ZnCo-ZIF/S-1, the characteristic peak of ZnCo-ZIF at 7.3° (2θ) is observed, confirming that the ZnCo-ZIF is successfully loaded on S-1 zeolite [41]. In the FTIR spectra of the ZnCo-ZIF/S-1, the band intensity of isolated silanol groups at 3775 cm−1 is significantly reduced when compared to S-1 zeolite, indicating the interaction between ZnCo-ZIF and these hydroxyl groups of S-1 zeolites (Fig. S2) [42], [43].

Fig. 1. XRD patterns of S-1, ZnCo-ZIF, ZnCo-ZIF/S-1, Co@NC/S-1and CoOx@NC/S-1 samples.
After pyrolysis, the organic linker was carbonized into NC layer, and the low-boiling Zn species were evaporated at such a high temperature, while the reduced Co species remained and were encapsulated into the NC layer. After the subsequent oxidation process, the isolated cobalt oxide sites within NC layers supported on S-1 zeolite (CoOx@NC/S-1) were synthesized. The XRD pattern of CoOx@NC/S-1 maintains the typical MFI topological structure with good crystallinity [37], [41]. No characteristic peaks for Co species are observed, demonstrating no large metal particles in the CoOx@NC/S-1 samples (Fig. 1).
To verify the impact of zinc dopant content in bimetallic ZnCo-ZIF precursors on the size and dispersion of CoOx species, TEM and EDX elemental mapping images were tested. Fig. 2a–c shows the TEM image of CoOx@NC/S-1(0), in which the sheet-like morphology of NC layers are homogeneously supported on S-1 zeolite, and the metal particles are confined by the NC layers. The high-resolution TEM image of these particles has clear lattice fringes of 0.26 nm, corresponding to the (3 1 1) plane of Co3O4 (Fig. 2b) [28]. After the addition of Zn (Zn/Co = 2), small particles can be observed in Fig. 2d–f. When the mole ratio of Zn and Co increases to 4, no particles can be seen in Fig. 2g and h. The corresponding EDX spectrum shows that the Co species are highly dispersed in the NC layer with the nanoscale. According to EDX spectra analysis, the mass percent of the Co species are 2.6, 1.7 and 1.1 wt% for CoOx@NC/S-1(0), CoOx@NC/S-1(2), and CoOx@NC/S-1(4), respectively. Simultaneously, no metal Zn species are detected (Fig. S3), indicating that Zn species almost completely evaporated during the high-temperature pyrolysis process. These results collectively prove that the Zn species act as a “fence” and increase the distance between the adjacent Co atoms in space, thus realizing the spatial isolation of cobalt oxide species with nanoscale.

Based on the above analysis, a possible preparation process can be concluded in Scheme 1. Tuning the molar ratio of Zn/Co in the ZIFs, Co species can be spatially separated to a varied isolation degree during pyrolysis, with the lowest degree of isolation for nanoparticles (Zn/Co = 0), a moderate value for small particles (Zn/Co = 2), and the highest isolation degree for isolated metal sites (Zn/Co = 4). The unique structure of the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalyst is expected to show good catalytic performance, and is beneficial to explore the active sites and reaction mechanism for propane dehydrogenation.
3.2. Catalytic performance
The catalytic performance over Co-based catalysts on different supports is shown in Fig. S4. It is indicated that S-1 zeolite is the optimal support for the Co species. Fig. 3a shows the catalytic performances of Co catalysts supported on S-1 zeolite. It can be seen that the CoOx@NC catalyst exhibits little catalytic activity, while the Co/S-1 and CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts exhibit improved activity than that of the CoOx@NC catalyst, further suggesting that the S-1 support can be beneficial for enhancing catalytic performance. Notably, the CoOx@NC/S-1(2) and CoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalysts show excellent catalytic performance with high selectivity to propene (>97%) and high propane conversion (>11%) under the WHSVpropane of 3 h−1 (Fig. 3a). The TOF value of CoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalyst attains 48.5 h−1, which is higher than that of Co/S-1 (10.6 h−1), CoOx@NC/S-1(0) (16.7 h−1) and CoOx@NC/S-1(2) (30.2 h−1) catalysts (Fig. 3b). These results illustrate that the high dispersion of small cobalt oxide sites can guarantee the maximum availability of Co species during propane dehydrogenation process. The thermodynamic equilibrium limitation and experimental propane conversions over CoOx@NC/S-1(4) as a function of reaction temperatures are shown in Fig. 3c. The conversion of propane increases significantly with the increase of reaction temperatures, and the propane conversions are always close to the equilibrium conversions, thus confirming the high activity of CoOx@NC/S-1(4). In addition, the apparent activation energies of Co/S-1, CoOx@NC/S-1(0), CoOx@NC/S-1(2) and CoOx@NC/S-1(4) are 79.1, 69.5, 67.9 and 64.3 kJ/mol, respectively (Fig. 3d). The much lower apparent activation energy obtained on CoOx@NC/S-1(4) further explains the high catalytic activity of these small cobalt oxide sites prepared by spatial isolation strategy. In order to test the durability of the CoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalyst, the reaction temperature was increased to 600 °C (Fig. S5). After 40 h time on stream, the propane conversion decreases from 41.3% to 21.6%, which may be due to the aggregation of CoO sites at such a high temperature [11], [12], [17], [18].

(d) Apparent activation energies of Co-based catalysts under different temperatures. Reaction conditions: atmospheric pressure, 100 mg catalysts, WHSVpropane = 3 h−1 and C3H8:N2 = 5:19 with flow rate of 24 mL min−1.
Considering that in situ dynamic transformations of cobalt species can occur under the reaction conditions, the real active species in the PDH reaction may not be any of the starting metal species. To clarify the correlation of activity with the structure of the catalysts, the catalytic performances of fresh CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts and pretreated CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts (ReCoOx@NC/S-1) were performed and then discussed. Fig. 4 shows the catalytic performances of the CoOx@NC/S-1 and ReCoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts. The initial propane conversions of CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts are low, reaching the maximum propane conversions within 30 min. In contrast, the ReCoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts have higher initial propane conversions, reaching the maximum propane conversions with a shorter induction period of 10 min. Among these catalysts, CoOx@NC/S-1(4) and ReCoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalysts exhibit higher propane conversions (>40%) and propene selectivities (>97%), and the propane conversions only decrease a little after 10 h PDH reaction at 600 °C. Overall, the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts have similar propane conversions with those of the ReCoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts, while the induction period of the latter is more considerable. These results suggest the change in the valence state of the active centers over the catalysts during propane dehydrogenation reaction.

Reaction conditions: 200 mg of sample, 600 °C, atmospheric pressure, WHSVpropane = 1.5 h−1, C3H8:N2 = 5:19 with flow rate of 24 mL min−1.
3.3. Structure investigation
The chemical coordination of Co species in Co-based catalysts was revealed by the DR UV–vis spectroscopy shown in Fig. S6. All the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts display a broad peak at 715 nm and a weak peak at 458 nm, corresponding to the ligand–metal charge-transfer of O2–→Co2+ and O2–→Co3+ in crystallite Co3O4, respectively [44], [45]. Similar peaks are observed for Co/S-1 as well. Thus, it can be inferred that the cobalt species mainly exists as the Co3O4 component in all Co-based catalysts.
The structural information on the Co species of CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts is then characterized by XPS. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, all the CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts show two peaks at 780 and 788 eV, ascribed to the characteristic Co 2p3/2 and weak Co(II) satellite. The deconvolution peaks of Co 2p3/2 at 779 and 781 eV are attributed to Co3+ and Co2+, respectively [17], [28]. The above results are consistent with the DR UV–vis results (Fig. S6). The XPS spectrum of N 1 s shows that the main nitrogen species after pyrolysis are graphitic-N and pyridinic-N (Fig. S7), which are anchor points for Co species [29], [46], [47].

Fig. 5. (a) Co 2p3/2 spectra of the fresh CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts, (b) Co 2p3/2 spectra of the spent CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts after 2 h of reaction.
In order to further elucidate the changes in the structure of CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts during PDH, the spent CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts after 2 h time on stream were also examined using XPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 5b, the binding energy of the Co 2p3/2 core level of all the spent CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts shift to higher energy (~782 eV) than that of fresh CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts (~780 eV), which signifies a transition of the original Co3+ states to lower reduction states during the PDH process [48]. For the spent CoOx@NC/S-1(0) and CoOx@NC/S-1(2) catalysts, a new peak appears at about 777 eV, which is ascribed to the metallic Co formed by the reduction of Co3O4 crystallites during PDH reaction [27]. However, no metallic Co peak is observed in the spent CoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalyst, and Co species mainly exist as Co2+ state after 2 h time on stream.
In addition, the desired active sites for PDH can also be indicated by H2-TPR. The reduction of cobalt-based catalysts occurs in two-step: Co3+→Co2+→Co0 [16], [17]. As shown in Fig. 6, Co/S-1 catalyst shows two reduction peaks at 223 and 540 °C, which can be assigned to the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ and the reduction of Co2+ to metallic Co, respectively. For CoOx@NC/S-1(0) and CoOx@NC/S-1(2), the main reduction peaks shift toward higher temperatures, suggesting the metal-support interaction becomes stronger by the confinement of the NC layer. When the mole ratio of Zn and Co increases to 4, the reduction peak of Co3+ to Co2+ increases to 488 °C, while the reduction peak of Co2+ to metallic Co disappears. This result confirms that the Co2+ species in CoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalyst are stable at the reaction temperature of 600 °C, and cannot be further reduced into metallic Co species.

Fig. 6. H2-TPR curves of fresh Co-based catalysts.
Combining the results of the catalytic performances of fresh CoOx@NC/S-1 and ReCoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts, H2-TPR and XPS spectra of Co-based catalysts, the reaction route for PDH in CoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts are illustrated in Scheme 2. For CoOx@NC/S-1(0) and CoOx@NC/S-1(2), metallic Co may form lighter hydrocarbons through CC cracking, while only CoO nanoclusters are responsible for dehydrogenation [19], [49]. For CoOx@NC/S-1(4), the isolated CoO sites are especially accountable for propane dehydrogenation. On the other hand, the formation of hydrogenolysis and coke are sensitive to the surface structure, the high isolation degree of CoOx@NC/S-1(4) can significantly reduce the generation rate of by-products and coke [50], [51]. Therefore, high propene selectivity can be achieved on CoOx@NC/S-1(4), as compared to CoOx@NC/S-1(2) and CoOx@NC/S-1(0) (Fig. 4). Moreover, the catalytic performance of the CoOx@NC/S-1(4) is superior to the reported Co-based catalysts (Fig. S8).

To better understand the structure of CoOx@NC/S-1, the CoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalyst was re-oxidized in air at 550 °C for 1 h. Then, the resultant CoOx/S-1(4) catalyst is tested in PDH. As shown in Fig. S9, the propane conversion over CoOx/S-1(4) was decreased seriously after 3 h on stream. (Fig. S9). Since the NC layers are oxidized after calcination, the isolated cobalt oxides on the surface are easily reduced and aggregated to form large metallic Co particles during the PDH reaction [13], [15]. The large metallic Co particles in CoOx/S-1(4) can easily generate by-products and coke, which can cover the active sites, and thereby reducing catalytic activity for PDH (Fig. S10). This further illustrates that the isolated CoO nanoclusters confined in NC layers are responsible for propane dehydrogenation.
3.4. Mechanism investigation
It has been demonstrated that catalysts with isolated sites are more conducive to studying fundamental mechanisms of catalytic processes [52], [53]. Moreover, this research is based on the level of molecule and atom, so we can understand the catalytic reaction process and mechanism from the level of the molecule or even atom. Hence, the in situ FTIR experiments were carried out on the CoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalyst to explore the reaction mechanism of PDH. Fig. 7a exhibits the FTIR spectra of propane recorded on the CoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalyst after adsorption of propane at 30 °C (spectrum I), reaction at 300 °C for 60 min (spectrum II) and subsequent evacuation at 30 °C (spectrum III). In spectrum I, the bands assigned to propane are detected at 2964, 1467, and 1381 cm−1 [54]. Surprisingly, a new strong band appears at 1445 cm−1 when the sample is heated to 300 °C, indicating that propane has participated in the reaction on this catalyst (spectrum II). After evacuating at 30 °C, all the bands disappear (spectrum III). These results suggest that the band at 1445 cm−1 may correspond to some weakly adsorbed species generated by propane and can be easily desorbed, and thereby releasing the active sites to activate CH bond of propane in PDH. This result is well consistent with the results of C3H6-TPD measurement (Fig. S11)

The FTIR spectrum obtained after adsorption of propene at 30 °C shows the bands at 3090, 2967, 1833, 1650 and 1459 cm−1 (spectrum I), which are the characteristic absorption bands of propene [54]. After consequent adsorption of H2 at 300 °C, the bands of propene become negligible, while a new band appears at 1445 cm−1 (spectrum II), and disappears after evacuating at 30 °C (spectrum III).
Based on the above results, we find that the band at 1445 cm−1 is detected during PDH and the microscopic reverse process of PDH (propene hydrogenation). It is clearly confirmed that this band probably caused by the CH vibration is related to the intermediate product during PDH. We can infer that the intermediate product of both propane dehydrogenation and propene hydrogenation is cobalt propyl (Co-C3H7), and the proposed reaction mechanism for PDH on the CoOx@NC/S-1(4) catalyst is described in Scheme 2b. The first step of PDH should be the formation of the cobalt propyl. Subsequently, the formed propyl radical tends to crack, forming propene and hydrogen by β-H cleavage. These results were supported by DFT calculation reported in the other work [24].
4. Conclusions
The catalyst of isolated cobalt oxide sites was prepared and exhibited exceptional catalytic performance with a 40% propane conversion and a > 97% selectivity to propene at 600 °C. The catalytic performances of fresh CoOx@NC/S-1 and ReCoOx@NC/S-1 catalysts, H2-TPR and XPS spectra of Co-based catalysts revealed that the active sites for CoOx@NC/S-1(4) were isolated CoO sites. In situ FT-IR spectra were performed to investigate the reaction mechanism. Firstly, propane was activated on the isolated CoO surface and formed cobalt propyl. Subsequently, the formed propyl radical tended to crack, forming propene and hydrogen by β-H cleavage. This research will help deepen the understanding of the reaction mechanism and further enhance the catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation.

    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
