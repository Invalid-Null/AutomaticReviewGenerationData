Seeds induced Beta zeolite synthesis with low SDA for n-heptane catalytic cracking reaction
Due to higher thermal and hydrothermal stability, suitable acidity properties, Beta zeolite is considered as promising catalyst for naphtha catalytic cracking process. However, high cost and environmental pollution issue limit its industrial application by using high content of N-containing organic structural directing agent (SDA). In this paper, different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios of Beta zeolites were prepared assisting by seeds induced method with low SDA and cheap industrial silica sol as the silicon source. Physical and chemical properties of as-prepared Beta zeolites were characterized by XRD, N2 adsorption-desorption, NH3-TPD, Py-FTIR and SEM. N-Heptane was used as model compound for catalytic cracking performance evaluation. The results showed that Beta zeolite with high SAR was successfully synthesized, which had well defined crystallinity, proper specific surface area and pore structure, high B/L ratio and strong acid site. n-Heptane catalytic cracking performance showed high yield of low-carbon olefins with relative low activity on hydrogen transfer reaction and coke formation.
1. Introduction
Low-carbon olefins, especially propylene, are very important basic chemical raw materials. Due to its wide application in various industries, the demand for propylene has become higher in recent years. At present, the existing propylene production processes in the industry include catalytic cracking, steam cracking[1], propane dehydrogenation[2], methanol-to-olefin[3]and so on. Traditionally, the main source of propylene is still the steam cracking process, which has the disadvantages of high cracking temperature (usually higher than 800 °C), high energy consumption and low propylene/ethylene (the yield of propylene is lower than 13%)[4], [5]. Compared with the steam cracking process, the newly developed catalytic cracking process has the advantages of low energy consumption, low cracking temperature, flexible the adjustment of propylene/ethylene ratio, and the carbon dioxide emissions are reduced.
Light alkanes such as pentane, hexane, heptane and octane are used as model compounds for catalytic cracking of naphtha, and have been used to evaluate the catalytic cracking performance of various zeolite catalysts and the reaction mechanism of the catalyst[6], [7], [8]. Higher propylene yield could be obtained by catalytic cracking of alkanes on acidic zeolite catalysts, which mainly occurs by carbenium ion/β-scission mechanism. Yoshimura et al.[9] used H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al=100) zeolite by adding hydrazine (10 wt%) as an active component for catalytic cracking of light naphtha, resulting in conversion of light alkanes up to 61%, the olefin content of the products is significantly increased. However, as typical 8-membered ring cross-channel zeolite, the inherent small pore of ZSM-5 limits its application on long chain hydrocarbon diffusion performance. MCM-68 has multi-dimensional 10-MR and 12-MR channels system, Inagaki et al.[10] dealuminized the MCM-68 zeolite catalyst to reduce acid density, which showed selectivity to propylene as high as 45–50%. A dealuminated H-MCM-22 by using ammonium hexafluorosilicate (AHFS) was reported by Wang Yong et al.[11], which showed an increase in catalytic lifetime and propylene selectivity at higher n-hexane conversion. This is mainly a reduction in the amount of Lewis acid sites, which reduces hydrogen transfer reactions and coke formation.
Beta zeolite is a unique high silica zeolite with three-dimensional twelve-membered ring cross-channel system with linear channel of 0.66 × 0.67 nm and nonlinear channel of 0.56 × 0.56 nm. Combined with the unique pore structure and suitable surface acid properties, Beta zeolite is considered as the preferred catalyst. Beta zeolite is widely used in cracking[12], [13], isomerization[14], aromatic alkylation[15], esterification[16], etherification[17]and other catalytic applications. In particular, Beta zeolite exhibits outstanding performance as a catalytic cracking additive in catalytic cracking[13]. However, Beta zeolite has problems such as long crystallization time[18] and large amount of templating agent[19] in the synthesis process, which makes it costly and greatly limits its application in the industrial field.
At present, hydrothermal synthesis method is still the major method for Beta zeolite synthesis, which has the advantages of simple operation and high crystallization. In general, when conventional hydrothermal method is used to synthesize Beta zeolite, large amount of structural directing agent (SDA, TEAOH/SiO2 = 0.25–0.50) is required, which also causes environmental pollution issue during the calcination of SDA [20]. Perez-Pariente et al.[21] hydrothermally synthesized a well-crystallized Beta zeolite using TEOS as a silicon source and TEAOH as a template with a high TEAOH/SiO2 ratio of 0.5 for an extremely long crystallization time of 6 days. Jon et al.[22] reported that the synthesis of pure phase Beta zeolite required a crystallization time of up to 6 days. Manrique et al.[23] hydrothermally synthesized Beta zeolite with TEAOH/SiO2 ratio of 0.499 under gradient temperature condition for total 4 days. Möller et al.[24] reported that as high as TEAOH/SiO2 ratio of 0.425 with 3-day crystallization time was afforded for the synthesis of mesoporous Beta by using mesoporous silica as the silicon source. Yao et al.[25] hydrothermally synthesized heteroatom Beta zeolite with a TEAOH/SiO2 ratio of 0.4 and a crystallization time of 12 days longer. Although these literatures have the excellent catalytic performances on specific applications, long crystallization time and large amount of templating agent were required.
Researchers also reported various methods to synthesize Beta zeolite by adding calcined or uncalcined Beta as seeds in the starting gel in the absence of any organic structural directing agent[26], [27]. Only Beta with low Si/Al ratio, low yield or large crystal size (> 500 nm) could be obtained[27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. However, It was found that H-beta with lower SiO2/Al2O3 ratio (SAR) showed a low propylene selectivity and rapid deactivation in the cracking of n-hexane[32].
So far, it is still necessary to synthesize high SAR Beta zeolite with high crystallinity in the presence of SDA. It is known that the synthesis of Beta zeolite is induced by adding seed crystals could reduce the amount of templating agent and shorten the crystallization time. However, few researches have reported on the investigation of seeds induced crystallization on synthesizing high silica Beta zeolites under the low structural directing agent. Moreover, as another significant contribution of production cost, silicon source should be carefully selected based on the consideration of cost and performances. alkaline silica sol shows superior advantages when being used as silicon source, which exhibits much more stable status and relative lower cost. Moreover, the morphology and structure of silica nanoparticles is much matchable to transfer into crystal structure with relative minor transformation.
In present work, we used cheap alkaline silica sol as silicon source, sodium aluminate as aluminum source and sodium hydroxide as alkali source, and introduced seed crystal to induce the synthesis of Beta zeolites with different Si/Al ratio to reduce the amount of structural directing agent and shorten the crystallization time. Catalytic performances of synthesized Beta catalysts with different Si/Al ratios were investigated for the catalytic cracking of n-heptane as a model reaction of naphtha cracking to produce propylene.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals
The chemicals reagents, such as alkaline silica sol (30 wt% as SiO2, industrial-grade, Qingdao Haiyang Chemical Co., Ltd.), Tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH, 25% aqueous solution, AR, Aladdin Biochemical Technology Inc., China), Sodium aluminate (NaAlO2, 41% as Al2O3, CP, Sinopharm Chemical Regent, China), Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, AR, Xilong Chemical Industry Incorporated Co. Ltd, China), Ammonium nitrate (NH4Cl, AR, Yantai Shuanshuang Chemical Co., Ltd.) were used as received without further purification.
2.2. Preparation
The process of Beta zeolite synthesis by traditional hydrothermal method was performed as follows: TEAOH and NaOH were dispersed into proper amount of distilled water under vigorously stirring. After stirring few minutes, NaAlO2 was added and stirred for 1 h. Then alkaline silica sol was slowly added to the above solution by drop and continued stirring for another 1 h to form uniform gel. The gel was then transferred into a stainless-steel autoclave lined with polytetrafluorethylene, and the product synthesized under 433 K for 3 days with a gel ratio of SiO2: 1/30Al2O3: 0.3TEAOH: 0.05NaOH: 17.6 H2O had the highest relative crystallinity. Finally, the as-prepared Na-Beta zeolites were washed, dried at 373 K for 12 h. The sample was named Beta-C as seed.
Seeds induced Beta zeolites with different Si/Al ratio were synthesized by adding homemade Beta-C seeds. TEAOH and NaOH were dispersed into proper amount of distilled water under vigorously stirring. After stirring a few minute, different NaAlO2 was added and stirred for 1 h. Then the alkaline silica sol was slowly added to the above solution by drop and continued stirring for another 1 h to form uniform gel with ratio of SiO2: x = 1/15, 1/30, 1/60 and 1/90 Al2O3: 0.2TEAOH: 0.18NaOH: 12.7 H2O. Then, 10 wt% Beta-C seeds to SiO2 were added and continued stirring for 1 h. The gel was then transferred into a stainless-steel autoclave lined with polytetrafluorethylene, and the products were hydrothermally synthesized under 433 K for 48 h. Finally, the as-prepared Na-Beta zeolites were washed, dried at 373 K for 12 h and calcined at 823 K for 6 h to remove the template. The samples were named as Beta-15, Beta-30, Beta-60 and Beta-90, respectively.
The synthesized Na-Beta zeolites were mixed with 1.0 mol/L Ammonium chloride solution according to the weight ratio of 1:20 and stirred at 85 °C for 4 h. After three consecutive ion exchanges, the materials were filtered, washed, dried, and calcined at 823 K for 6 h to obtain H-Beta zeolites.
2.3. Characterization
The crystallinity of the prepared Beta zeolite was analyzed by XRD, which was carried out on X′Pert PRO MPD (Netherlands, Cu target, Kα radiation λ = 0.1542 nm, 35 kV, 40 mA), scan angle of 5°-60°. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were recorded at 77 K with a Micromeritics TriStar 3020 instrument. Before measurements, the samples were pretreated at 573 K under vacuum for 4–6 h. The total specific surface areas of the samples were calculated on the pressure range of 0.05–0.35 by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method. The specific surface area of micropore was calculated by t-Plot method. The morphologies of the materials were examined by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) using a HITACHI S-4800. Pyridine-adsorbed infrared (Py-IR) was used to determine the acid type of samples on a Nicolet-6700 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Company) in scanning range of 1400–1600 cm−1 with a resolution of 4 cm−1. To characterize the acidity concentration and strength, temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was carried out on Micrometrics ASAP 2920. Prior to NH3 adsorption at 343 K for 0.5 h, the sample was pretreated in helium flow at 823 K for 0.5 h to remove the impurities. After that, the physically adsorbed NH3 was removed in a flow of helium for 0.5 h at 343 K, followed by heated to 873 K with a rate of 10 K min−1. The signals were recorded by monitoring the desorption of ammonia with a TCD detector. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) was performed using a Perkine-Elmer TGA analyzer with a heating rate of 10 °C/min under air flow.
2.4. Catalytic tests
The catalytic cracking of n-heptane was carried out in a fixed-bed pulse reactor under atmospheric pressure as showed in Fig. 1. Typically, 1.0 g of catalyst (80–180 mesh) was loaded into a tubular reactor (6 mm in i. d.) and activated in an air flow of 20 ml/min−1 at 773 K for 30 min. After the reactor temperature was adjusted to the reaction temperature of 600 ºC, n-heptane (Wako Pure Chemicals Ind.) was pushed into the helical gasification section of reactor by nitrogen, which had been preloaded in a sample loop with 1 g n-heptane capacity equipped in six-way valve. After 1–2 s of reactant injection, the products were purged out by steady 20 ml/min of nitrogen for 10 min. The gas product was collected by a gas collecting bottle, while the liquid product was collected by a liquid collection bottle condensed by ice water mixture. The reaction products were analyzed with an off-line gas chromatograph (Agilent, GC-456 and GC-450) with an TCD and FID detector. Further, the catalyst after the reaction was subjected to thermogravimetric analysis to measure the coke formation. The coke amount of used catalyst was calculated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) by the weight loss from 300 °C to 800 °C. Carbon balance of catalytic cracking of n-heptane was triply verified up to 90%.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Textural properties of as-prepared Beta zeolite
As shown in Fig. 2, traditional hydrothermally synthesized Beta-C zeolite exhibited typical X-ray diffraction patterns located at 2θ of 7.8° and 22.4°. Moreover, XRD patterns of samples prepared by seeds induced method with different SAR also showed characteristic peaks of Beta zeolites. However, Beta-15 sample with low SAR of 15 showed not only a characteristic peak of the Beta zeolite, but also a characteristic diffraction peak of a strong analcime crystal at 2θ of 15.9° and 26.1°, indicating that heterocrystal zeolite could be formed at low SAR condition. When the SAR was increased, pure phase of the Beta zeolite could be achieved with very high crystallinity, further indicating that seeds induced Beta zeolite synthesis process favored relatively high SiO2/Al2O3 ratio.

Textural properties of samples prepared with different SAR as well as Beta-C were characterized by the N2 adsorption-desorption analysis at − 196 °C. The isotherms and pore-size distributions of the samples are displayed in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 3a, all the isotherms of Beta-C and seeds induced Beta samples with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratio showed typical type IV isotherms with close to the H-3 type hysteresis loops, indicating that slit mesoporous structures were obtained. Traditional hydrothermally synthesized Beta-C zeolite exhibited typical microporous material isotherm for N2 adsorption-desorption analysis with total specific surface area and microporous specific surface area of 505 m2·g−1 and 378 m2·g−1, respectively. As for samples prepared by seeds induced method, N2 adsorption amount of Beta zeolites below relative pressure of 0.01 representing the microporous specific surface area increased by increasing SAR, which demonstrated that crystallization was effectively enhanced. As listed in Table 1, the microporous specific surface areas increased from 255 m2·g−1 to 395 m2·g−1 with increasing SAR from 15 to 60, respectively. It should be noticed that Beta-15 showed much lower microporous specific surface area as well as total specific surface area, which indicated poor crystallization and was consistent with XRD result. Fig. 3b illustrated pore size distributions of Beta-C and Beta zeolites with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios by BJH method, which showed no obvious centralized mesopore distribution. It should be noticed that Beta-C prepared by traditional hydrothermal method presenting kind of mesopore distribution around 8 nm, which is slit mesoporous structures. However, when seeds induced method was used for Beta synthesis, the as-prepared Beta zeolite showed well-crystalizing tendency. Beta with higher SAR showed mesoporous trend which might be caused by small crystal size generation, which could be confirmed by broad pore distribution on mesoporous range for Beta-90.

3.2. Acidity and chemical compositions of as-prepared Beta zeolite
Temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was carried out to evaluate the acid strength and concentration of the samples prepared with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratio as well as Beta-C. According to the results as shown in Fig. 4, the NH3-TPD curves of each sample were similar in shape, which representing two kinds of acid sites. The peak below 250 °C is considered as weak acid site, while the peak above 250 °C is considered as strong acid site. The amounts of weak acid, strong acid and total acid concentration of the sample are calculated from the integral of the NH3-TPD curves, and are listed in the Table 2. The results demonstrated that besides the sample Beta-15 having overlapping peak and relatively small amount of acid, the total acid amounts of other samples decreased with increasing SAR for seeds induced Beta zeolite, and the corresponding weak acid and strong acid also decreased with the same trends. Moreover, the ratio of strong acid/weak acid (S/W) of the samples were increased from 0.72 to 0.77 with increasing SAR from 30 to 90. It is interesting to notice that all samples prepared by seeds induced method showed relatively lower acid strength but higher S/W than parent Beta-C samples, which is more favorable for the catalytic cracking of n-heptane to prepare low-carbon olefins.

b, S/W is strength ratio of strong acid sites to weak acid sites determined by NH3-TPD.
c, B/L is strength ratio of strong acid sites to weak acid sites determined by Py-FTIR.
The acid type of samples was analyzed by pyridine adsorbed FTIR (Py-FTIR, Fig. 5). The samples had been exchanged into H-beta before the test. As can be seen from the figure, all Beta samples had characteristic absorption peaks near 1450 cm−1 and 1540 cm−1, which corresponded to Lewis acid sites (L acids) and Brønsted acid sites (B acids) respectively. The B acids to L acids ratio (B/L) values from the integrated two peak areas were calculated and listed in Table 2 as well. In general, B acid is generated by tetracoordinated framework aluminum as active center for catalytic cracking, while L acid is mainly derived from a six-coordinated non-framework aluminum as active center for coke generating. The ratio of B/L varied from 0.34 to 0.58 when the ratio of SiO2/Al2O3 increases from 15 to 90, which indicated that Beta zeolite with higher SiO2/Al2O3 ratio generated more B acid sites, which was beneficial to the preparation of low-carbon olefins by catalytic cracking of n-heptane.

The SEM images of samples (Fig. 6) showed that the samples prepared with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratio were all irregular aggregates of small particles, mostly spherical or ellipsoid, with a particle size of less than 100 nm. Basically, no aggregation of amorphous substances was observed except for Beta-15, which was consistent with XRD patterns. It clearly saw that Beta-15 sample showed amorphous species along with Beta crystal, which was again confirmed poor crystallization with low SAR.

The thermal analysis results of Beta-C and samples with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratio are presented in Fig. 7. Almost all the samples showed three-step weight losses, and the weight losses of each step were listed in Table 3. The first weight loss between below 200 °C was assigned to physically adsorbed water by the Beta zeolite. The weight loss ranging from 200 °C to 550 °C was mainly caused by the thermal decomposition of organic SDA in the synthesis of Beta zeolite. With the increase of SAR, the weight loss of the Beta zeolite increased sequentially. It could be explained that as the aluminum decreased with increasing SAR, the increasing acid strength of acid site enhanced the attraction to TEA+, resulting in more template agent TEAOH filling into the Beta zeolite, which also confirmed that moderate amount of SDA was necessary for Beta synthesis with high SAR; The third weight loss between 550 °C and 800 °C was mainly caused by coke formed from TEAOH remaining in the Beta zeolite, which was not easily removed during the thermal decomposition process, and gradually roasted out as the temperature rising.

3.3. Catalytic performance of as-prepared Beta zeolite for n-heptane cracking
Fig. 8 showed the conversion and gas yield of Beta zeolites with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratio as an active component for catalytic cracking of n-heptane. As can be seen from the figure, gas products gradually increased from 38.8% to 46.2% over seeds induced Beta catalysts with increasing SAR from 15 to 9, while the conversion of n-heptane firstly increase to maximum of 61.8% then gradually decreased. Catalytic performance of Parent Beta-C was also tested, which showed nearly the same result to Beta-30, which prepared from the same initial SAR. Theoretically, the total amount of acid in the corresponding Beta zeolite decreased with increasing SAR, resulting in a decrease on n-heptane conversion. The lower conversion of Beta-15 might due to the poor crystallization and lacked of enough acid sites, especially strong acid sites, for cracking reaction, which was confirmed by NH3-TPD.

Table 4 showed gas products distribution of Beta zeolites with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratio as well as parent Beta-C. As SAR of seeds induced Beta increased from 30 to 90, dry gas yield decreased gradually, which might because of that the low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of the Beta zeolite has a higher acid content, which easily produced atypical pentacoordinatehe carbenium ions for generating dry gas components. In addition, C3 and C4 alkanes produced by higher hydrogen transfer reactions, which showed the same trend on aromatic products (BTX). Therefore, as the ratio of SiO2/Al2O3 increased from 30 to 90, corresponding to the influence of the acid amount in the Beta zeolite, the yield of each component of the dry gas was reduced.

As the main products from catalytic cracking reaction, it can be seen from the products distribution in Table 4 and Fig. 9 that as the SiO2/Al2O3 increased, the yield of corresponding C3= and C4= increased, which might due to the decreasing total acid amount of the corresponding Beta zeolite with the increasing SAR resulting in reduced n-heptane conversion rate. However, the increasing strong acid along with increasing B/L ratio and higher crystallinity of Beta zeolite with increasing SAR, which might be easy to cracking reactants by the carbenium ion/β-scission mechanism and restrain the following hydrogen transfer reaction and other secondary reaction of the olefins to some extent. Fig. 9 showed coke removal curves determined by TG under air flow, the coke amount in spent catalyst was also presented in figure, which calculated by weight loss between 300 °C and 800 °C. From the coke calculation results, it clearly to be seen that gradually decrease on coke amount was achieved over catalysts with increasing SAR. The reduced amount of coke formation could also be explained by above mentioned mechanism.

4. Conclusions
In the paper, Beta zeolites were successfully synthesized by employing seeds induced method under condition of reduced structural directing agent and short the crystallization time. Beta zeolite with different of Si/Al ratio could be flexibly adjusted with high crystallinity with lower SDA usage and relative short crystallization period. Textural properties of samples demonstrated that the microporous specific surface area increased from 255 m2·g−1 and 395 m2·g−1 by increasing SAR from 15 to 90, which confirmed high crystallization by XRD patterns. Acidity of as-prepared samples were also conducted, which revealed that increasing B/L ratio from 0.44 to 0.58 and high S/W ratio of 0.72–0.77 with increasing SAR from 30 to 90. Consequently, the as-prepared Beta zeolite exhibited excellent catalytic performance on n-heptane catalytic cracking, which howed high yield of low-carbon olefins with relative low activity on hydrogen transfer reaction and coke formation.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
