Atomic layer deposition of Ga2O3 on γ-Al2O3 catalysts with higher interactions and improved activity and propylene selectivity in CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
We synthesized Ga2O3 on γ-Al2O3 support with atomic layer deposition method (ALD) for the CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). The Ga loading from 1 to 2.9 wt% was controlled by the number of ALD cycles from 1 to 3. For the comparison purposes, the equivalent catalysts were prepared with incipient wetness impregnation method. The catalysts were characterized by a variety of methods including temperature programmed desoprtion of NH3 (NH3-TPD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy mapping (EDS-Mapping). We identified the ALD catalysts more active and selective in CO2-ODHP reaction due to the higher surface total moderate acidity, Ga-O-Al linkages and Ga2O3 dispersion. The ALD-3C, with 2.9% Ga as the catalyst with the highest performance, gave 38% conversion and 82% selectivity to propylene after 120 min of CO2-ODHP reaction at 600 °C which was equal to 96% improvement in the propylene yield.
1. Introduction
The growing market demand for propylene as one of the most utilized building blocks of petrochemical and polymer industries with the ever widening gap between industrial production and the existing demand, have attracted the attention of academia and industries to the direct production of propylene from propane [1], [2], [3]. In this regard, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2, as a mild oxidant, by the tandem target of CO2 emission mitigation and propylene production advancement started to be an interesting field of research [4], [5]. The reaction of CO2 and propane over metal oxide catalysts is reported to proceed through either oxidative or non-oxidative pathways depending on the nature, composition and reducibility of the catalyst [6]. For the oxidative pathway, mostly chromium and vanadium based catalysts supported on various metal oxides have been studied. The related literature report shows the study of typically supported gallium oxide, zinc oxide and indium oxides based catalysts in the non-oxidative case. Further, isolated chromium, vanadium and cobalt oxide sites, have also gained the attention of the researchers in the CO2-ODHP studies [4], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10].
Gallium oxide is known as an active catalytic phase for the light alkane dehydrogenation either in presence or in the absence of oxidizing agents including CO2 [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Gallium oxide-based catalysts are mostly believed to take part in the CO2-ODHP reaction through a non-redox mechanism in which the C-H bond activation occurs by the heterolytic dissociation of propane [18]. Generally speaking, the role of CO2 in this mechanism is reported to be the consumption of the produced H2 in the first step with the reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction [6]. However, the CO2-assisted re-oxidation of the partially reduced Gaδ+ (δ < 2) has been also investigated in the recent studies [19].
For the dehydrogenation of propane over Ga-based catalysts, Castro-Fernández et al. [11] reported the importance of the coordination environment and the acidity of various silica supported gallium polymorphs. For CO2-ODHP reaction, it has also been reported that the catalyst with weaker acid strength resulted in enhanced performance in terms of conversion and selectivity [20].
Regarding coordination number and local environment, Getsoian et al. [21] have worked on the XANES spectra of a variety of Ga3+ reference compounds and compared them with those resulted from Ga-SiO2 and Ga-H-BEA catalysts under reducing conditions. Their results demonstrated that the coordination number and the environment could shift the edge energy of Ga3+ and effectively change the performance of the catalysts in PDH reactions. The importance of the changing the local environment of the Ga2O3-based catalysts before the reaction is also reported in other reports. For example, Searles et al. [22], have reported high PDH performance of an isolated Ga site on SiO2 by utilization of a molecular complex Ga precursor in a two-step catalyst preparation method. This way the isolated Ga site on the non-reducible silica support represented a long-term stability over 20 h. As a kind of counterexample, Szeto et al. [23], have reported that, in comparison to Ga-O-Si, the presence of Ga-O-Al bond is required to activate C-H bond of propane through the heterolytic dissociation reactions.
To achieve the Ga-O-Al linkage with the aim of promoting the performance of the catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation reactions with or without CO2, researchers have focused on the incorporation of Ga into Al2O3 surface structure [24], [25], [26]. Batchu et al. [26], have worked on the Ga modification of the γ-Al2O3 (110) as a model catalyst with either doping or grafting of Ga. The results of their experimental and density-functional theory (DFT) studies demonstrated about 5 times higher activity of Ga-doped catalysts compared to the pristine γ-Al2O3 due to the synergy between neighboring AlIII and GaIV sites. In contrast, the grafted Ga sites were almost inactive in the dehydrogenation of ethane. Castro-Fernández et al. [24], have worked on the colloidal synthesis of spinel-type gallia-alumina catalysts to improve the PDH reaction performance. Their results show that catalyst surface with Ga-O-Al linkages are responsible for the propane activation and propene selectivity with the surface rich in Al. Due to the higher ratio of weak/mild Lewis acid sites (LAS), these catalysts showed less coke formation in PDH. In contrast, the Ga rich samples, show the higher fraction of Ga-O-Ga linkages which deactivate faster by coke due to the presence of stronger Ga-based LAS.
In summary, the synthesis method has significant impacts on the production of sufficient active site-support linkage and the satisfactory incorporation of the target atom into the support structure. For example, Xiao et al. [8] have indicated the higher surface exposure of Ga species in hydrothermal and co-precipitation methods compared with grind-mixture synthesis. As reported elsewhere [11], [27], [28], in common synthesis methods and techniques there are substantial concerns about the uniformity of the deposited species. In these methods, agglomeration and the lack of atomic control on the resulting catalysts are their downsides.
One of the recently developed methods with the goal of designing and obtaining catalysts with much better control on the deposition of the active site with atomic scale compared with the conventional techniques is the gas-phase sequential and self-limiting atomic layer deposition (ALD) method [28]. This method is proved as an impressive tool for the minimum consumption of catalysts by both maintaining the precision in the dispersion of catalysts and preventing the agglomeration of them [29]. In the ALD method, precursors are alternatively exposed to the support surface from the gas phase, which results in the deposition of surface species dominated by adsorption and surface reactions kinetics. Therefore, the surface sub-nanometer control over the deposited material with remarkable uniformity and conformality can be achieved by this layer-by-layer (LBL) synthesis method [30], [31], [32].
Herein, the atomic layer deposition of Ga2O3 on γ-alumina support was studied with the aim of promoting the catalytic performance of CO2-ODHP reaction by increasing the number of surface Ga-O-Al linkages and doping Ga into the surface structure of γ-Al2O3. The surface features of catalysts using various characterization methods showed the privilege of ALD over the common incipient wetness impregnation method in improving the interaction between gallia and γ-alumina.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation by atomic layer deposition (ALD) method
The ALD reaction was implemented in a two zone ALD reactor similar to what was reported by Najafabadi et al. [33] and comprises of reactive chemisorption, purging, oxidizing and another purging steps. The schematic of ALD procedure is shown in Fig. 1. To synthesized the γ-alumina supported Ga2O3 with ALD method, appropriate amounts of Ga(acac)3 and γ-alumina were used as the ALD precursor and support respectively. Prior to the first step of ALD reaction, the support was heated to 230 ºC and kept at this temperature for ½ h under flowing Ar with a flow rate of 120 sccm. The purge time with Ar was also ½ h after both the Ga(acac)3 reactive chemisorption and the oxidation steps. The sublimation zone was set at 145 ºC based on the TGA-DTA results (See Section 3.1) and the ALD temperature window was searched by changing the support temperature from 160 to 400 ºC with a heating rate of 10 ºC/min. The mixed O3/O2/N2 stream with an ozone concentration of 78 gr/Nm3 and a flow rate of 120 sccm was used as the oxidizing agent. The oxidation reaction was performed at the selected ALD reactive chemisorption temperature for 1 h followed by increasing the temperature to 350 ºC and continuing the oxidation for an additional 1 ½ h. By FTIR monitoring of the ALD reactor outlet during the oxidation step, after the disappearance of CO and CO2 peaks as the products of oxidation reaction, we made sure that all remaining acac ligands were oxidized. Subsequently, the last purging step at 350 ºC and then the cooling to about 50 ºC under Ar stream was performed. To prepare the whole series of ALD catalysts with the increased loading of Ga, we have repeated the ALD cycle up to 3 times. The final catalysts were denoted as ALD-iC where i refers to the number of ALD cycles like ALD-3C that is the ALD catalyst synthesized with 3 ALD cycles. The final Ga loading of catalysts where measured with inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) method. For more details of the ALD synthesis method see S1–2 section of the Supplementary Information (SI).

Left axis shows the flow rate of each gas from t0 to t6. The right axis shows the temperature of the γ-Al2O3.
2.2. Catalyst synthesis by incipient wetness impregnation method
For the preparation of catalysts with the common incipient wetness impregnation method, appropriate amount of gallium nitrate was dissolved in deionized water with a volume equal to the pore volume of the γ-alumina support (See S1–2 section of the SI). The resulting solution was added drop wisely to the alumina support and mixed mechanically. The impregnated powder was dried in an oven at 60 ºC for 18 h and calcined at 600 ºC for 3 h with a heating rate of 10 ºC/min. Similar to ALD catalysts, the final impregnation catalysts were denoted as Imp-Eq.iC. This notation means the impregnation-synthesized catalyst with a Ga loading that is equal to that of in the ALD-iC catalyst.
2.3. Characterizations
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) data were used for the study of the thermal behavior of the ALD precursor and determination of suitable sublimation temperature for the ALD synthesis without facing undesirable incidents like enormous evaporation. Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was performed to determine the Ga loading of the synthesized samples where needed. Temperature programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) were conducted to measure the acidity of the catalysts and also to compare the dispersion of catalysts. To study the surface composition of the ALD and impregnation synthesized catalysts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) under was performed. UV–Vis DRS data were collected to define the effect of Ga2O3 deposition with ALD and impregnation method on the surface Al2O3 crystal. To determine the textural parameters of catalysts including specific surface area, pore size distribution, and pore volume, the adsorption-desorption isotherm data were collected. The High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), High-angle annular dark-field (HAADF)-STEM images and their related energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) data were used to find the quality of Ga dispersion and the local surface crystallinity of catalyst. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected to see if any bulk changes have happened to the samples with the deposition of Ga2O3.
For the details of characterizations methods and their related instruments see S1–3 section of the SI.
2.4. Activity measurements
The performance of catalysts in CO2-ODHP reaction were evaluated at 600 °C. The feed mixture was consisted of 5% propane and 25% CO2 balanced with Ar. This mixture fed to the reactor with a flow rate of 15 sccm. The effluent gas consisted of products and unreacted feed were analysed by an on-line gas chromatography. Control experiment with Al2O3 in absence of gallium oxide was executed with the same procedure. Conversion (X) and Selectivity (S) were calculated using the following equations ((1), (2)) [34], [35]. Worth noting that traces amounts of oxygenated hydrocarbon molecules were observed during all experiments which were not quantifiable. The details of activity measurement are provided in the S-1–4 section of SI.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. ALD reactions and temperature window for the catalysts synthesis
TGA, DTA and DTG data of Ga(acac)3, Ga2O3 precursor, were collected and presented in Fig. 2. As shown, there is a sharp weight loss in the TGA graph at around 189 °C with sharp peaks in the DTA and DTG curves which is related to the concurrent sublimation [36] and melting of Ga(acac)3. Using these data, Antoine Equation [37] (Eq. (S.3)) and doing several trial and errors, an evaporation temperature of 145 °C for Ga(acac)3 was selected to yield sufficient partial pressure for the ALD process. This temperature has enough margin of safety from melting and decomposition.

Fig. 2. TGA, DTG and DTA of Ga(acac)3 under flowing N2 with a heating rate of 10 °C min-1.
For the investigation of support temperature effect on the ALD process, the temperature of support zone was increased from 160° to 400°C with a heating rate of 10 °C.min-1. The gas-phase products of reaction between Ga(acac)3 and surface functional groups of γ-Al2O3 were detected with an online FTIR. The resulted FTIR spectra for stretching vibrations of C–H, CO of CO2 and carbonyl groups at various temperatures are presented in Fig. 3(a-c) respectively. In Fig. 3(d), the FTIR peak area of stretching C–H for hydrocarbon molecules and stretching CO of CO2 is plotted as a function of temperature. As shown in Fig. 3(a-d), at low temperatures only acetone and Hacac were observed in the spectra. With the increase of temperature, CO2 and hydrocarbon molecules containing carbonyl groups other than Hacac and acetone (from 250 °C) were detected. As investigated by other researchers using DRIFT and solid state NMR [38], [39], Hacac adsorbs on alumina, reacts with it and forms Al-acac and Al-acetate surface species. Further, there exist diverse surface OH-groups on γ-Al2O3 including terminal, bridged and tribridged bounded on various coordinated Al atoms [40]. Therefore, the presence of acetone with Hacac at lower temperatures may result from the side reactions between Hacac and various functional groups of the γ-Al2O3 support. However, evolution of CO2 and other molecules containing carbonyl groups from 250 to 400 °C in parallel to Hacac and acetone, indicate the decomposition of acac ligands on the alumina surface. Thus, based on these observations, the temperature range of 160–240 °C is high enough to prevent the condensation of precursor and sufficiently low to avoid the precursor desorption and/or decomposition, is considered as the proper ALD temperature window.

The support temperature of 230 °C was selected for the subsequent experiments. In the third ALD step, a flow of O3/air was exposed to the Ga(acac)x-deposited γ-Al2O3. In this step, CO2, CO, acetone and some trace amount of the other oxygenated hydrocarbon molecules were monitored by FTIR showing the presence of remaining acac ligands and hydrocarbon that were oxidized with ozone.
Fig. 4(a), presents the ALD reactor effluent at 230 °C with time. As is evident, after 5 hr of Ga(acac)3 exposure, the formation of Hacac and acetone reaches a plateau. This time is called saturation time, indicating saturation of the γ-Al2O3 surface and thus, almost termination of the surface reactions. The right axis of Fig. 4(a) shows the cumulative peak areas of Hacac and acetone.

The Ga loading of several Ga2O3/γ-Al2O3 samples with various Ga(acac)3 chemisorption time were examined using ICP method. These results, Fig. 4(b), verified the Ga(acac)3 saturation time to be about 5 hr in line with what is presented in Fig. 4(a-right and left axes).
The whole ALD cycle was repeated to make catalysts with different loading. The ICP-measurement, Fig. 4(c), shows that the Ga loading increases linearly from 1 to 3 cycles.
3.2. Structural and textural characterizations
Fig. 5(a) shows the surface acidity of ALD-3C and Imp-Eq.3C catalysts measured using NH3-TPD. As shown, a broad NH3 desorption peak was found for ALD-3C, Imp-Eq.3C and γ-Al2O3 with weaker and higher amount of total acidity in line with what was reported by Abdelgaid et al. [41]. As reported by others [41], [42], it can be stated that the interaction of Ga with the γ-Al2O3 support turns the maximum NH3 desorption toward the lower temperatures due to higher electronegativity of Ga compared to Al. Fig. 5(b) shows the larger amount of total moderate acidity of ALD-3C catalyst, as compared to its equivalent impregnation one. As reported by Xin et al. [42], the largest total acidity of ALD catalysts indicates an increase in the acid sites and hence higher dispersion of Ga2O3 over γ-Al2O3 in ALD catalysts.

Fig. 6. The XPS spectra for ALD-3C and Imp-Eq.3C catalysts: (a) the wide scan spectra and (b) Narrow scan spectra for Al 2p peak.
Fig. 6(a) shows the wide scan spectra recorded for ALD-3C and Imp-Eq.3C. As is shown, the characteristic peaks of O 2 s, Ga 3d, Al 2p, Al 2 s, C1s, O1s and O KLL (Auger peaks) are present in both samples. The C1s might have been originating from the adsorption of adventitious carbon contaminant on the surface of catalysts [43].
The narrow scans of all main peaks were collected separately (not shown here). The narrow spectra of O 1 s peak was the first one that was studied due to the important information which it might have been able to give about the surface. However, determining the exact shift in the BE of O 1 s is not fully reliable. As reported by other research groups [44], [45], the O 1 s region is crowded with signals originating from the large amount of bulk oxygen, the lattice oxygen, hydroxyl groups, water molecules and also organic contaminants having oxygen atom in their structures. The presence of adsorbed oxygen of OH surface species from the atmosphere, the adsorbed H2O at the surface of oxygen vacancy sites, and the adsorbed HCO3 and HCO2 were reported to show O 1 s BE peaking in the range of 531.7–534.6 eV [46], [47], [48], [49]. These peaks overlap with O 1 s of Ga-O-Ga linkages in gallia and Al-O-Al in alumina to some extent. Although, it has been reported that the O 1 s spectrum of Ga2O3 loaded on γ- Al2O3 support is appeared at binding energies of 530.7 and 530.9 eV [49], however, we cannot rigorously deconvolute the O 1 s peak and assign the exact position of O 1 s of Al-O-Al, Ga-O-Ga and Ga-O-Al linkages to a specific part of the obtained ex-situ XPS spectra. The same has occurred for Ga 3d that is expected to peak at around 20.5 eV in the oxide form [36], [50]. In this region, O 2 s of Ga-O-Ga, Al-O-Al and Ga-O-Al linkages overlaps with each other and also with O 2 s of the adsorbed water and oxygen containing organic contaminants peaking respectively at around 22.8, 23.57 eV [49], [51] and higher BEs.
Based on the above explanation and based on the spectra presented in Fig. 6(a), the last resort is to investigate the Al 2p spectrum in more details. Fig. 6(b) indicates the narrow scan of Al 2p. As shown, the Al 2p of ALD catalyst compared with its impregnation counterpart has large shift toward lower binding energies. Castro-Fernández et al. [24], also reported similar observation for (Ga,Al)2O3 with various Ga:Al molar ratio including 0:1, 1:6, 1:3. The reason of such Al 2p peak shift to lower binding energies with the increase of Ga content is that Ga is more ionic cation with higher electronegativity compared to Al in (AlxGa1−x)2O3, and therefore the charge transfer contribution changes with the increase of Ga-O-Al bonds [24], [52]. Zhang et al. [53], have stated the observation of the Al 2p XPS peak increase to the lower binding energies by increasing the linkages of Zn-O-Al and decreasing this shift with the partial segregation of the ZnOx from the solid solution. Worthy to note that similar to Ga, Zn also has higher electronegativity compared to Al. Therefore, we can conclude that the larger peak shift of ALD catalysts to lower binding energies is a results of higher content of Ga-O-Al linkages in comparison the impregnation ones.
To investigate the other aspects of the incorporation of Ga into the γ-Al2O3 support, we have studied the catalysts with UV–Vis DRS. The UV–Vis DRS data of Al2O3 and Ga2O3/Al2O3 catalysts are presented in Fig. 7(a-c). As shown, Al2O3 has a band around 220 nm, part of it is below the UV range, with lower energy residuals. In accordance with what was reported by Escribano et al. [54], this band is attributed to O2-→Al3+ charge transfer transition. Based on the reports in literature [54], [55], the formation of Ga-O-Al linkages results in distortion of the surface Al2O3 crystal and shifts the Al2O3 maximum UV–Vis DRS peak and its residuals to lower energies with the slight increase of the absorption of the residuals. Further, it has been reported that pure Ga2O3 has a broad absorption band around 270 nm [54], [55]. Using the UV–Vis DRS data, similar to the study of the XPS results, it is realized that higher amount of Ga-O-Al bonds was formed over γ-Al2O3 structure in ALD catalysts on the contrary to the large Ga2O3 particles present in Imp-Eq. catalysts.

The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm, BET surface area and the corresponding pore size distribution were investigated for ALD and impregnation catalysts to realize that after the incorporation of Ga into the γ-Al2O3 support, how the pore structure changes compared to the samples that have surface amorphous particles with larger size.
The results for ALD and Imp-Eq. catalysts are shown in Figs. 8(a-c) and 9(a-b) respectively. As shown, pure γ-Al2O3 has the type of ink-bottle pores (H2b). However, as the two adsorption and desorption branches are nearly vertical, the ink-bottle pores are very similar to the cylindrical channels with H1 hysteresis loop as reported in literature [56], [57], [58]. The deposition of Ga2O3 with ALD method did not change the pore structure, the shape of the hysteresis and pore size distribution but reduced the nitrogen uptake and therefore the surface area and the pore volume. In contrast, the deposition of Ga2O3 with impregnation method resulted in the structural alteration of the shape of the hysteresis loop from nearly vertical branches to nearly horizontal ones with H4 hysteresis loop (i.e. from ink-bottle cylindrical like pores to ink-bottle narrow slit like) [56], [57], [58]. This structural change has also resulted in the reduction of the pore volume and surface area. Such characteristics of impregnation catalysts are due to formation of less dispersed and large Ga2O3 particles which causes remarkable pore blocking. Regarding to the ALD catalysts, the Ga2O3 particles are highly dispersed as revealed by total acidity measured by NH3-TPD and the surface area. For the Imp-Eq.3C catalyst, the slight increase of surface area may be considered to the additional porosity of the larger Ga2O3 particles which probably have less interaction with the Al2O3 support as suggested by Shimizu et al. [59].

Figs. 10(e) and 11(e) indicate that there are some surface particles on both ALD and impregnation catalysts. As was explained for UV–Vis DRS, it was concluded that these surface particles are mostly Ga2O3. However, comparing Figs. 10(e) and 11(e) it is obvious that these surface particles on ALD catalysts are more dispersed, i.e. they have smaller size in agreement with the total acidity measured by the NH3-TPD.

Looking at the HRTEM images with smaller scale, in Figs. 10(f), 11(f) and their IFFT represented in Figs. 10(g, h) and 11(g, h), it is inferred that small crystalline islands have been formed on the surface of γ-alumina. The observed average d-spacing values are measured to be 2.04, 2.05, 2.41, 2.51, 2.81 and 2.85 A° for ALD-3C catalyst. According to X'Pert HighScore library, 00–022–0615, these d-spacing values correspond to the gallia-alumina solid solution facets with (2 0 6), (1 0 10), (2 0 0), (1 1 4), (1 1 0) and (0 0 8) miller indices, respectively. The lattice with d-spacing of 2.41 A° of ALD-3C catalyst can be seen in Fig. 10(g, h). For the Imp-Eq.3C catalyst, the average measured d-spacing values are 2.04, 2.05, 2.31, 2.37 and 2.41 A° that are attributed to the gallia-alumina solid solution planes with miller indices of (2 0 6), (1 0 10), (2 0 3), (2 0 2) and (2 0 0). The lattice with the d-spacing value of 2.37 A° of Imp-Eq.3C can be seen in Fig. 11(g, h).
XRD was employed to study the structural transformation that occurs to the γ-Al2O3 support following deposition of Ga2O3 with either ALD or impregnation techniques (See Fig. 12). As shown, all diffraction lines of Al2O3 and Ga2O3/Al2O3 are broad representing the low crystallinity of the γ-type polymorph of alumina probably due to the high surface area of this support, 207 m2.gr-1, in line with what was reported in literature [25]. The patterns show a shift in the position of the diffraction peak of (4 4 0) plane of γ-Al2O3 (2θ = 69.94°) to lower angles. As reported in the literature [24], [25], [26], [60], the observed shift is most likely due to incorporation of Ga3+ with larger ionic radius (0.62 Å) as compared to that of Al3+ ion (0.53 Å) into the γ-Al2O3 structure.

Looking at Fig. 13, it is realized that the catalysts drastically deactivate for the first 45-minute time on stream (TOS). The activity decline for γ-Al2O3 is less pronounced. This deactivation step of Ga2O3-based catalysts may have been originated from the larger content of acidic sites which results in considerable affinity to coke formation under alkane dehydrogenation reactions as reported by other research groups [12], [25], [61]. It has also reported that the incorporated Ga sites can migrate to the surface under the propane dehydrogenation reaction conditions [23]. This migration results in surface reconstruction by the formation of less active surface Ga2O3 particles with lower interaction with the support. The same was reported for the deactivation of Fe doped CeO2 under CO2-ODHP reaction [62].

Fig. 13. Propane conversion as a function of (a-1) TOS and (a-2) Ga loading at TOS of 120 min; Propylene selectivity as a function of (b-1) TOS and (b-2) Ga loading at TOS of 120 min.
Figs. 13(a, b) and S.6(a, b) shows that the presence of Ga has increased the selectivity of propane and decreased the selectivity of the by-products in both ALD and Imp.Eq catalysts compared with the pure γ-Al2O3. As it is presented in Fig. 13(a-1, b-1), the ALD catalysts show most higher propane conversion and higher propylene selectivity. It is evident in Fig. 13(a-2) that the propane conversion has increased from 17% on γ-Al2O3 to 38% for the ALD-3C catalyst and to 20% for the Imp-Eq.3C at TOS of 120 min. The selectivity of propylene, shown in Fig. 13(b-2), has been also changed from 50% on γ-Al2O3 to 82% for the ALD-3C catalyst and to 79% for the Imp-Eq.3C at the same TOS value.
In Table S2, we have compared the results of ALD-3C with literature. As is represented in this table, it can be found that the ALD catalysts have the conversion and selectivity in the highest range of the reported values of other literature.
At the beginning of the CO2-ODHP reaction, Ga2O3/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are partially reducible and after reaching the steady state reaction conditions, due to the small loadings of Ga2O3 on γ-Al2O3, they become non-reducible. Therefore, it has been reported that CO2-ODHP reaction, Eq. (3), at the steady-state conditions proceeds through the non-redox heterolytic dissociation of propane (Eq. (4)) followed by reverse water gas shift reaction (Eq. (5)) [6], [12], [63], [64]. The reaction scheme is provided in Fig. 14.

CO2 also prevents the catalyst deactivation by eliminating the formation of Ga-hydride as asserted by Liu et al. [61] using in-situ DRIFT for the study of CO2 ODHP. Removing the deposited carbon through reverse Boudouard reaction (Eq. (6)) may also be considered as another role of CO2 over these catalysts [12], [63], [64].

Finding the reason behind the improved performance of Ga-modified γ-Al2O3 catalysts compared with γ-Al2O3, Batchu et al. [65] did DFT and experimental studies on modification of γ-Al2O3 surface with either doping or grafting of Ga for alkane dehydrogenation reaction. Their investigations demonstrated that the dehydrogenation proceeded with the stepwise reaction involved the formation of a surface proton and a metal carbanion intermediate which faces β-hydride elimination. They reported that Ga-doped- γ-Al2O3 exhibit 5 times catalytic activity improvement as compared to the pristine γ-Al2O3, due to the synergy between GaIV and AlIII neighboring sites. As reported by Abdelgaid et al. [41], in the stepwise heterolytic dissociation of propane, the Ga-doping into the γ-Al2O3 surface structure decreased the energy barrier for the activation of the first C–H bond of propane.
Regarding the higher activity and selectivity of ALD catalysts compared to the impregnations ones, it can be stated that ALD method of synthesis provides the opportunity of depositing Ga2O3 on γ-Al2O3 with higher dispersion (smaller particle size). The higher dispersion of Ga2O3 particles in ALD catalysts results in their stronger interaction with the support and the formation of Ga-O-Al linkages to a larger extent. The presence of higher density of Ga-O-Al linkages in ALD catalysts, is identical to the existence of more favorable sites for the propane conversion through the heterolytic dissociation pathway. In contrast, the large domain size of Ga2O3 in impregnation catalysts resulted in the higher fraction of Ga-O-Ga bonds that are less active in the propane dehydrogenation. Similar results were observed by Yang et al. [66] for the ALD of VOx on γ-Al2O3.
4. Conclusions
To conclude, the ALD method was used to synthesize γ-Al2O3 supported Ga2O3 catalysts to improve the CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. The Ga loading was precisely controlled by changing the ALD number of cycles. Compared to the impregnation catalysts, the ALD samples resulted in higher dispersion of Ga2O3 and larger interaction with γ-Al2O3 to form higher number of Ga-O-Al linkages and higher acidity. In the contrary, the impregnation method resulted in the formation of less dispersed and large Ga2O3 particles with lower interaction with the support and less acidity. The impregnation formed Ga2O3 particles decreased the surface area of the support by blocking some of γ-Al2O3 pores. The CO2-ODHP reaction over the ALD synthesized catalysts had higher propylene selectivity and up to 51% higher propane conversion. In fact, the larger portion of Ga-O-Al linkages in the ALD-made catalysts, doping of more Ga into the surface of γ-Al2O3, and higher content of acid sites, that are known to decrease the energy barrier for the C–H bond activation, facilitated the conversion of propane. The role of CO2 in this process was the consumption of H2 in reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction and shifting the equilibrium toward more propylene production. Generally, this study paves the way to consider the ALD as an appropriate method for the incorporation of the target species in a desired structure when a strong interaction between the active phase and the support is desired.
