Safety analysis of switching between reductive and oxidative conditions in a reaction coupling reverse flow reactor
Abstract
A new reverse flow reactor is developed where endothermic reactants (propane dehydrogenation) and exothermic reactants (fuel combustion) are fed sequentially to a monolithic catalyst, while periodically alternating the inlet and outlet positions. Upon switching from reductive to oxidative conditions hydrocarbons come into contact with air. Due to mixing in the monolith channels and in the inlet sections, combustible gas mixtures can be formed. In this work the effects during reaction phase switching are studied by detailed numerical simulations and some qualitative experiments. Due to the reverse flow concept and the use of a monolithic catalyst switching between oxidative and reductive conditions can be carried out without intermediate flushing with inert gases, if proper precautions are taken.
1. Introduction
A new reactor concept is developed for the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propylene and hydrogen over a platinum based monolithic catalyst. The strongly endothermic propane dehydrogenation is carried out at high temperatures (550–650°C) because of thermodynamic constraints on the propane conversion. However, at these temperatures carbonaceous side-products, collectively termed coke, are formed at the catalyst surface, necessitating catalyst regeneration.
The reactor concept is based on, firstly, the indirect coupling between energy necessary for endothermic reactions and energy released by exothermic reactions, using a fixed catalyst as an energy repository. During the endothermic propane dehydrogenation reaction phase, energy is withdrawn from the catalyst cooling down the catalyst and simultaneously coke is deposited on the catalyst surface. During a consecutive exothermic fuel combustion reaction phase the catalyst is reheated and concurrently regenerated by burning off the coke. Secondly, recuperative heat exchange is integrated inside the reactor using the concept of reverse flow, i.e. periodic alternation of the gas flow direction while feeding the endothermic and exothermic reactants without any preheating. In this novel multifunctional reactor, called the reaction coupling reverse flow reactor (RCRFR), the propane dehydrogenation reaction, energy supply at high temperatures, catalyst regeneration and recuperative heat exchange are all integrated in one apparatus.
Upon switching between the endothermic propane dehydrogenation reaction phase to the exothermic fuel combustion reaction phase and vice versa hydrocarbons and hydrogen come into contact with oxygen, at least for a short time. Thus, due to mixing a combustible gas mixture might be formed, possibly causing a temperature runaway (hot spot) or even an explosion. The effects resulting from switching between reductive and oxidative conditions in a monolithic catalyst have not been reported before in literature.
Mixing of oxygen and hydrocarbons can occur because of dispersion inside the monolith channels or mixing in the feed sections (present at both reactor sides because of the reverse flow concept), including the piping, valves and gas distribution sections.
Even if mixing induces an explosive gas mixture, heterogeneous deflagration or detonation is excluded in the monolith channels, if the channel diameter is smaller than the quenching diameter. Minimal quenching distances have been determined from spark ignition between parallel plates for propane, propylene and hydrogen combustion in air at 2.0, 1.5 and
, respectively (Lewis & von Elbe, 1961). The quenching diameter is somewhat larger for tubes (Turns, 1996) and minimal at a fuel/air equivalence ratio of slightly larger than 1 and strongly increases for smaller or larger equivalence ratios (Kroschwitz & Howe-Grant, 1993). Depending on the operating conditions and reactor design of the RCRFR, the duration of explosive gas mixtures entering the monolith is very short. Hence, in a monolithic catalyst with a channel diameter of 1 mm or smaller deflagrations can be excluded.
Because of the reverse flow concept the temperatures in the inlet section will — under normal operation — always be well below the auto-ignition temperatures for propane, propylene and hydrogen combustion, 723, 733 and 823–
, respectively (Lewis & von Elbe, 1961; Zabetakis, 1965), so that the danger of a homogeneous explosion in the inlet section is negligible. However, if due to mixing a hot spot is created at the monolith entrance, an explosive gas mixture in the inlet section might be ignited. These gas-phase back-deflagrations to the gas inlet can occur if the monolith inlet temperature exceeds about 1000°C (Lewis & von Elbe, 1961; Minkoff & Tipper, 1962).
Potential hazards can obviously be avoided by flushing the reactor with inert gases like nitrogen prior to reaction phase switching. However, if a flushing cycle could be prevented this would greatly enhance the feasibility of the RCRFR by avoiding additional complexity of a flushing cycle on the already very complex dynamic reactor behaviour, and by avoiding extra energy losses and nitrogen costs.
The aim of this work is the study of the phenomena occurring during reaction phase switching in a RCRFR by detailed numerical simulations and some qualitative experiments. Having identified gas-phase back-deflagration as the most dangerous hazard, this work focuses on the increase of the monolith entrance temperature in time due to combustion reactions in the monolith channels, where combustible gas mixtures are formed because of mixing in the monolith channels and the inlet section.
Firstly, effects occurring during reaction phase switching have been investigated by simulating three different scenarios. Before taking all mixing processes into account, two limiting cases are studied. In the first limiting case all pre-mixing effects are neglected and only dispersion in the monolith is taken into account. Upon reaction phase switching a step change in the inlet concentrations is assumed. In the second limiting case, it is assumed that mixing in the inlet section is complete and lasts for an infinitely long time, resulting in a continuous feed of an explosive gas mixture. Finally, the case is simulated where explosive mixtures arise from premixing in an inlet section, resulting in time-dependent boundary conditions for the monolith inlet concentrations. The inlet section is represented as an ideally stirred vessel to consider a worst case scenario. Secondly, qualitative effects discerned from the simulations are checked by some qualitative experiments.
Since more heat is released during propane combustion compared to propylene and hydrogen combustion under comparable operating conditions, only switching between propane and air feed and vice versa has been studied. Effects of additional coke combustion were ignored, since coke is only deposited in the centre of the reactor due to the low inlet and outlet temperatures in a RCRFR.
2. Modelling
The phenomena occurring in an adiabatic RCRFR upon reaction phase switching have been modelled with mass an energy balances for the gas and catalyst phase, using a one-dimensional plug flow model with superimposed axial dispersion. The model equations are summarised in Table 1. In Appendix A, the validity of this model is indicated. Concluding from the theory for generalised Taylor dispersion for reactive systems, the effects of axial mixing due to a radial velocity profile arising from laminar flow are slightly overestimated when using Taylor's equation for the effective axial dispersion. By implementing Taylor's equation a worst case of axial mixing in the monolith channels is considered.

        Gas-phase overall continuity equation:

:

:
  Furthermore, because of the very small pressure drop over a monolithic catalyst and since only relatively small catalyst lengths are considered in this work (
), the gas phase momentum balance could be ignored.
The gas-phase physical properties have been modelled following Reid, Prausnitz and Poling (1988), using pure component properties as described by Dauber and Danner (1985). The solid phase is a cordierite monolith with rectangular channels having a hydraulic channel diameter of 0.96 mm and a gas-phase porosity of 0.69, where 1 wt% Pt has been dispersed in the γ-Al2O3 washcoat. The catalyst phase was considered as an impermeable pseudo-homogeneous phase with constant physical properties (Eigenberger & Nieken, 1988).
Multi-component mass transfer between the gas bulk and the catalyst surface was described with the Maxwell–Stefan theory. For the mass and heat transfer coefficients, the relation of Grigull and Tratz (1965) for circular tubes was implemented, because of the rounding of the channel due to the non-uniform distribution of the washcoat in the square support (Groppi & Tronconi, 1997). By solving the mass balances in the mass average reference frame, flux correction factors for the transport coefficients can be ignored (Bird, Stewart & Lightfoot, 1960).
Both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions are included using simple one-step kinetics. The homogeneous propane combustion reaction kinetics was taken from Westbrook and Dryer (1981), despite the fact that this often used relation has been derived for (catalytic) afterburners where the propane concentration is very low and oxygen is present in large excess. The reaction kinetics for the heterogeneously catalysed propane combustion was taken from Bruno et al. (1983). However, this reaction rate expression does not take the influence of the oxygen concentration into account. Therefore, the reaction kinetics by Bruno et al. was adjusted to include a first-order dependency on the oxygen concentration. Furthermore, internal diffusion limitations were neglected compared to the external mass transfer limitations. Finally, radiative heat losses to the inlet section have been neglected to consider a worst case situation for the monolith entrance temperature.
Uniform initial profiles for gas and catalyst phase temperature and gas-phase concentration profiles were taken (unless stated otherwise) and the usual Danckwerts-type boundary conditions were implemented. In case of flushing out propane with air including premixing in the inlet section, the propane mass fraction at the monolith entrance is given by
where τinlet represents the gas residence time in the inlet section.
The model equations were solved with a fully implicit finite difference technique using Barton's second order discretisation scheme for the convective terms (see e.g. Centrella & Wilson, 1984). A moving grid was implemented via updating of a transformation function for the axial coordinate. Superimposed on an equidistant grid, additional grid points were located at axial positions where the second order derivatives were largest, while keeping the total number of grid points constant. In the determination of a new grid spacing the minimum cell length was set by the Courant criterion in order to avoid numerical problems of overshoot and undershoot. Natural splines were used to interpolate the variable values from the old grid positions to the new grid positions. Furthermore, by extending the grid refinement zones slightly in the direction of the gas velocity the updating of the transformation function was decreased to only once every 10 time steps. With this moving grid technique the required calculation time for negligible numerical diffusion compared to axial dispersion was strongly reduced (at least a factor of 10). In the calculations 100 equidistant grid points and 100 additional grid refinement points and a time step of
were used for a monolith of
length.
3. Simulation results
3.1. No premixing
Firstly, the situation has been studied where propane is superseded by air in the monolith, assuming a step change in the inlet concentrations when switching from propane to air as gas feed. Typical axial mass fraction and temperature profiles are shown in Fig. 1.

).
The propane combustion reaction products accumulate between the propane and oxygen reactants, thus creating a diffusive barrier. Already after very short times the propane combustion rate becomes limited by axial dispersion of propane and oxygen. In this case of very low concentrations of the reactants at the reaction front a Fickian description of the mass transfer from the gas bulk to the catalyst surface would have sufficed.
Although most of the propane combustion takes place at the catalyst surface, the gas-phase temperature increases more than the catalyst temperature, due to the much smaller volumetric heat capacity of the gas phase. The influence of several important process parameters on the maximum temperature rise has been studied. The maximum temperature rise in the gas phase strongly increases with increasing rate of axial dispersion and increasing ratio of propane conversion by homogeneous reactions compared to heterogeneous reactions. Thus, the maximum temperature rise strongly increases for a monolith with a larger channel diameter (see Fig. 2), due to the strongly increased axial dispersion and the increased ratio of the homogeneous to heterogeneous reaction rate, mainly because of the decrease in specific catalyst surface area. At higher gas inlet temperatures, the ratio of the homogeneous to heterogeneous reaction rate strongly increases, resulting in higher maximum temperature rises. Finally, the inlet gas velocity hardly effects the maximum temperature rise, because the increase in axial dispersion is counterbalanced by the increase in reaction zone length and relative overall conversion by heterogeneous combustion reactions.

).
When feeding a premixed gas mixture to a fully active monolith almost all propane conversion takes place at the catalyst surface very close to the monolith entrance, creating a hot spot in only a few seconds. When feeding the same mixture to a much less active monolith, the temperature initially increases much further inside the monolith to a very high temperature. Subsequently, the temperature front moves back towards the monolith entrance opposite to the gas flow direction, creating a hot spot after a few minutes. Remarkably, the entrance temperature increases fastest for a propane/air mixture with an equivalence ratio of about 2, regardless of the catalyst activity. Although the largest adiabatic temperature rise is generated for a stoichiometric mixture, the homogeneous reaction rate, dominant at these high temperatures, is largest for a mixture with an equivalence ratio of 3.3 (corresponding to 18 wt% propane in air).
3.3. Premixing in the inlet section
Finally, the effects of premixing in the inlet section have been simulated. The influence of premixing of propane and air in the gas-inlet section has been modelled by assuming an ideally stirred gas inlet section of equal cross-sectional area as the monolith (worst case scenario), so that the length of the inlet section (Linlet) represents a characteristic length for the premixed volume. The influence of premixing on the maximum temperature rise is very strong, as depicted in Fig. 5.

, Linlet and vz,g,in indicated).
Fig. 5 also shows that the influence of premixing on the entrance temperature is less severe for a higher inlet gas velocity (because of a larger reaction zone in the monolith) and for the reverse case of air being replaced by propane (because of the reaction stoichiometry). An initial axial temperature profile with a low entrance temperature, as common in a reverse flow reactor, strongly decreases the maximum temperature rise. Due to the temperature profile the propane combustion takes place over a longer part of the monolith.
4. Experimental
To qualitatively verify the simulation results experiments were carried out in a cylindrical quartz tube with an internal diameter of 19 mm placed in a tube oven (see Fig. 6). In the ‘open-ended’ quartz tube a cylindrical shaped monolith piece, of equal diameter and 76 mm in length, was placed at a distance from a gas distribution plate to simulate premixing. The porous plate also acts as a flame quencher. In the experiments two different types of cordierite monoliths were used (supplied by Engelhard), one with 1 wt% Pt dispersed in the γ-Al2O3 washcoat and one without platinum, referred to as the active and inert monolith, respectively. The hydraulic diameter of the square channels of both monoliths was
. The gas-phase temperature was measured just in front of and just behind the monolith. Using a pneumatic four-way valve the feed was switched from a propane/air mixture to air or vice versa.

5. Experimental results
5.1. Premixed feed
Typical experimental results for the case of a premixed propane/air feed to the inert monolith are given in Fig. 7. The gas temperature (T1) just in front of the monolith initially decreases somewhat because of insufficient gas heating. The temperature of the gas (T2) flowing out of the monolith initially increases slowly due to heterogeneous reactions in the monolith. Suddenly, the temperature at the outlet rises very rapidly due to homogeneous combustion reactions, which could also well be observed visually as a bright yellow radiation. Subsequently, this temperature front travels through the monolith in opposite direction relative to the gas flow direction. When the temperature front reaches the monolith inlet, the gas phase in front of the monolith is ignited, observed as an instantaneous temperature increase of about 500°C. It was found that the flashback-time decreases strongly with increasing initial and inlet temperatures (e.g. ca.
at 700°C and
at 550°C) and was minimal for an equivalence ratio of about 2 (see Fig. 8). These experimental observations correspond very well with the simulations.

No temperature fronts were observed when feeding a premixed propane/air mixture to the active monolith. However, the entrance temperature increased quickly to approximately 500–600°C within 5 to
at 350 and 200°C, respectively. Again, the fastest temperature rise was found for a propane/air ratio equal to twice the stoichiometric ratio.
5.2. Switching between pure propane and air as feed
In the experimental set-up no gas-phase back-deflagrations were observed when switching from pure propane to air as feed or vice versa, not even if the active monolith was heated up to 1000°C and placed almost at the end of the quartz tube. Presumably, the extent of mixing in the ‘inlet-section’ is much less severe than the ideal mixing assumed in the simulations.
6. Conclusions
Simulations have shown that flushing with inert gases is not necessary for monoliths with a small channel diameter, if premixing in the gas inlet section is minimised and if the gas inlet and outlet temperatures are relatively low. The latter condition also excludes gas-phase back-deflagrations. Due to the reverse flow concept and the high overall efficiency of the indirect energy transfer, inlet and outlet temperatures are low. The axial temperature profile further diminishes the temperature rise during reaction phase switching. To assure operation at low inlet and outlet temperatures, the monolith inlet and outlet temperatures should be measured continuously as a safety measure. The gas distribution plate acts as a flame-arresting device.
In order to use the whole monolith effectively and obtain maximum conversion, the Damköler numbers of the endothermic and exothermic reaction phases need to be matched. Because the combustion reaction rate is much larger compared to the dehydrogenation reaction rate, the gas velocity during the fuel combustion cycle is relatively high, even further decreasing possible effects when switching from propane to air as gas feed. Temperature effects of switching from air to propane feed are less severe because of the reaction stoichiometry. Furthermore, switching from endothermic to exothermic reactants or vice versa could be carried out asynchronously with switching the gas flow direction. In this switching scheme the switching between the reaction phases is always carried out when the temperature front has moved somewhat further into the monolith, assuring a cold monolith inlet at a temperature equal to the gas inlet temperature (room temperature).
In a small set-up consisting of an open-ended quartz-tube containing a monolith and placed in a tube-oven, it has been experimentally confirmed that gas-phase back-deflagrations do not occur during reaction phase switching, even with high initial uniform axial temperature profiles. Taking proper precautions, switching between oxidative and reductive conditions can be carried out without intermediate flushing with inert gases. Without flushing, the heat released by propane combustion during reaction phase switching can actually be used to reheat the catalyst.

Appendix A. Validity of the one-dimensional plug-flow model with superimposed axial dispersion
The unsteady convective dispersion of a solute in fully developed isothermal laminar flow in a straight circular tube with an impermeable wall, where an irreversible first-order heterogeneously catalysed reaction takes place, was studied by Sankasubramanian and Gill (1973), and later more rigorously by Shapiro and Brenner (1986), extending the generalised Taylor dispersion phenomena to reactive systems. They showed that the mean reaction rate is independent of the flow rate and that the mean solute velocity and dispersivity depend on the rate of interphase transport.
The mean global-space reactant velocity
