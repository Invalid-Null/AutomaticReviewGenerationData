Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane on Boron Phosphate: A Computational Mechanistic Study
Abstract
Boron-based oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is emerging as a promising protocol because of its efficient conversion to propene, while the correlation between the structures of boron-containing materials and their catalytic activity remains unclear. In this work, by means of density functional theory calculations, the mechanism of ODHP on the surface of boron phosphate (BPO4) was studied. Three types of surface sites, the tri- (>B-OH, 3coord-B) and tetra- (≡BOH, 4coord-B) coordinated oxygenated boron sites and the phosphate site (≡POH, 4coord-P), were considered; the calculations indicated that under ODH conditions, all of them can display reactivity, and it is marginally harder to dehydrogenate the >BOH site (62.0 kcal/mol) compared to the ≡BOH (4coord-B, 57.8 kcal/mol) and ≡POH (61.1 kcal/mol) sites, while the nascent >B–O• is more active than the ≡B–O• and ≡P–O• species in the subsequent dehydrogenation of propane (ΔG≠ = 17.5 (17.3), 19.2 (16.3), 28.7 (17.6) kcal/mol, respectively). Similar to that on boron oxide (B2O3), the reaction on the catalyst surface proceeds in a stepwise manner, but with a higher free energy barrier to the rate-determining step on BPO4, implicating a lower reactivity of BPO4 than that of B2O3. By imposing various surface geometric constraints, which introduce a mechanical force on the active site and modulate its ability to construct a hydrogen bond network with the neighboring polar groups, the free energy barrier to the dehydrogenation of the active site decreases, indicating that the mechanical forces in the local environment favor the triggering of the reaction. This work enriches our understanding of boron-based ODHP systems and benefits the rational design and optimization of boron-based catalysts.

Propene is an important chemical feedstock. (1) Currently, the main protocol to produce propene from propane is the direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH), which is energy demanding and limited by thermodynamic equilibrium. (2) As an alternative, the protocol of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) has the benefits of a relatively lower reaction temperature and being free of the limit of thermodynamic equilibrium. However, since ODH reactions proceed in an oxidative atmosphere, deep oxidation of alkane can be a problem because it causes substantial carbon emission. This calls for the development of novel catalytic systems with improved olefin selectivity. (3)
The discovery of the remarkable catalytic performance of h-BN in ODHP process broke the dilemma (4,5) and has attracted growing research interest. The established knowledge on the key role of boron has extended the study of ODHP to other metal-free boron-containing materials. (6−9) In these studies, the surface-oxygenated boron species are identified as the key responsible species in boron-containing catalysts because of their catalytic activity in the ODHP reactions. In addition, the excellent thermal conductivity of boron-containing materials is proposed to benefit the remarkable olefin selectivity in the ODH reactions according to a recent CFD simulation study. (10)
Boron phosphate (BPO4) is a ternary boron-containing material that consists of corner-sharing PO4 and BO4 tetrahedral units and adopts a space group of I-4 (Figure 1). (11) It has a high melting point of 1400 °C (12) and a good thermal conductivity (κa = 62.4 W–1· m–1· K–1, κc = 51.5 W–1· m–1· K–1). (13) These properties endow it the potential to be used in heterogeneous catalysis, which has been evaluated in, e.g., the decomposition of Freon, (14) the Beckman rearrangement reaction, (15) and the oxidation of propylene glycol or ethane. (16,17)

The application of BPO4 in the ODHP process was also reported. (16,17) A higher temperature is needed for BPO4 (500 °C) to exhibit ODHP activity compared to B2O3 (405 °C). (8) At their optimal temperatures, i.e., 515 °C for BPO4 and 450 °C for B2O3 catalysts, a propane conversion of 14.3% was obtained with a propene selectivity of 82.5%, and on the B2O3 catalyst, a propane conversion of 14.8% was obtained with a propene selectivity of 73.3%. These data indicate a lower reactivity of BPO4 than B2O3 in propane ODH. It is unclear whether this corresponds to a distinct mechanism owing to the presence of P elements in the vicinity of B and the close-packed structure. This motivated the present study, in which the mechanism of ODHP reaction catalyzed by BPO4 was investigated by means of density functional theory. This work extends the study of boron-based ODH systems and enriches our understanding of the boron-containing material-catalyzed propane oxidative dehydrogenation, which is expected to benefit the rational design and optimization of the boron-based catalysts.

Method
All stationary points were fully optimized by Gaussian 09 program (18) using the M06-2X functional (19) with the 6-311g(d,p) (20) basis set. Dispersion correction was included using the DFT-D3 method. (21) The nature of each stationary point was verified to be a minimum or a transition state by vibrational frequency analysis, from which the zero-point energy and entropic corrections were obtained. Every transition state and the two minima it connected were confirmed to be along the same reaction pathway by intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations. (22,23) Reduced density gradient (RDG) (24) analysis was performed by Multiwfn. (25) The natural population analysis was carried out by NBO 3.1. (26)
Models
Experimentally, both boron hydroxyl groups and phosphate hydroxyl have been identified on the surface of BPO4, (27) indicating the co-exposure of oxygenated boron species and oxygenated phosphor species on the surface. In some catalytic reactions, BPO4 behaves as Brønsted acid, which is attributed to the surface phosphate groups, to participate in the reactions. (16,28) This indicates that when studying the surface of BPO4, it is necessary to take into account both oxygenated boron and phosphate sites. In the recent experimental study of BPO4-catalyzed ODHP, both tri- and tetra-coordinated boron species were identified, and their populations on the surface experienced changes during the ODHP reaction, with the former increased and the latter decreased. (9) This shows the complexity of the surface active sites of BPO4 catalyst; the local topology of these boron species is hard to characterize experimentally and remains unclear. Therefore, in order to evaluate the reactivity of BPO4 in ODHP, three types of models with exposed boron hydroxyl sites (tri- and tetra-coordinated, denoted as 3coord-B and 4coord-B, respectively) and phosphate sites (denoted as 4coord-P) were prepared (Figure 2). In these models, the >B-OH (3coord-B) (Figure 2a), ≡BOH (4coord-B) (Figure 2b), and ≡POH (4coord-P) (Figure 2c) sites are considered as the active sites.
Figure 2
Figure 2. Three types of active site models: (a) 3coord-B (tri-coordinated boron hydroxyl group). (b) 4coord-B (tetra-coordinated boron hydroxyl group). (c) 4coord-P (tetra-coordinated phosphate hydroxyl group).
The 3coord-B model represents a defect on the surface, differing from the other two in that it breaks the crystal lattice in its vicinity. The tri-coordinated boron site can be in principle anchored in a rigid (concave site, embraced by crystal lattice; lateral groups can hardly respond to the evolution of the active site, Figure 3a) or a flexible (convex site; lateral groups can reorientate to adapt to the evolution of the active site, Figure 3c) microenvironment, and thus feels less balanced forces exerted by atoms in its vicinity in the former than in the latter. Such unbalanced forces can improve the activity of the active site. To mimic the specific microenvironment of the 3coord-B model, four models were prepared with different restraining schemes (Figure 3). In these models, models A, B, and C have the same active sites and differ from each other in the sizes of the restrained regions, which decrease from A to C. Model D was prepared to mimic the active site at the edge and adopted the same restrained region as in Model C.

Tri-Coordinated Boron Sites (3coord-B)
Microenvironment of Surface Tri-Coordinated B Sites
Concerning the complexity of the surface, four types of microenvironments that accommodate tri-coordinated B species are considered. As shown in Figure 3, the active site is embraced by the crystal matrix with only one face exposed in Model A (Figure 3a), and in Model B, its microenvironment is partially restrained by the crystal matrix (Figure 3b). In Model C, the active site and its vicinity are fully exposed and free to relax (Figure 3c). In Model D, the active site is restrained in the same manner as in Model C, but located at the edge of the surfaces (Figure 3d). These models allow us to evaluate the influence of the surrounding environment during the reactions. According to fragmental analysis (Section S1), compared to that in Model C, the microenvironments in Models A and B caused a deformation energy of the active site of about 1 kcal/mol. Correspondingly, the P–O–B bridge that linked the active sites and the BPO4 bulk was strengthened, which resulted in a lower energy demand to break the >BO–H bond.
In previous studies of boron-containing material-catalyzed ODHP reactions, the surface boron hydroxyl groups have been reported to be responsible for their catalytic activity. (8,29−31) The boron hydroxyl group can form hydrogen bonds with adjacent hydroxyl groups. The reduced restraint from the vicinity of the boron hydroxyl site allows them to more easily relax themselves to adapt to each other during the reactions, which builds more and stronger hydrogen bonds between them. The enhanced hydrogen bond results in a more crowded vicinity of the >B–OH sites, which brings significant steric hindrance to impede the approach of gaseous substrates.
To verify the difference of the hydrogen bond in different models, the hydrogen bond interactions in models A–D were analyzed by the RDG method. (24) As seen in Figure 4, with less restraint from the crystal matrix, there are more hydrogen bonds formed.

Energetics of the Reactions at the Surface B Sites
The dehydrogenation of the surface >B–OH sites by dioxygen and the subsequent dehydrogenation of propane at its primary and secondary C sites are schematically shown in Scheme 1. The corresponding reaction steps are named as B3-1, B3-2a, and B3-2b, respectively. The calculated free energy barriers of the three reaction steps in A–D model systems are plotted in Figure 5. The structures of the stationary point in model A are given in Table 1, and those in models B–D are shown in Tables S1–S3.

In the reaction B3-1 step, the >B–OH was dehydrogenated by a dioxygen molecule. In general, for the heterogeneous reactions, the presence of steric effect does not favor a gaseous substrate to access the reaction sites on the surface and, thus, is detrimental to the reaction. Concerning the small size of the dioxygen molecule and the B3-1 reaction step proceeds at the exposed boron sites convexly on the BPO4 surface, it is reasonable to consider the easy access of dioxygen to the surface and the steric effect is negligible.
The dehydrogenation of the hydroxyl group breaks the hydrogen bonds between >B–OH and the neighboring H-bond acceptors, which costs energy. It is conceivable that with less restraint, it is easier for the neighboring H-bond acceptors to adjust themselves to detain the leaving H atom of the >B–OH group, resulting in a higher energy demand to break the >BO–H bond. Thus, the reaction’s free energy barrier to the B3-1 step increases with the decrease of the restricted degree of models, i.e., A (62.0 kcal/mol) < B (65.7 kcal/mol) < C (79.6 kcal/mol). For model D, the >B–OH active site is located at the edge of the model (Figure 3d) and is less hydrogen-bonded than in Model C. Accordingly, the free energy barrier to the B3-1 step is calculated to be 72.8 kcal/mol in model D, which is lower than that in model C (79.6 kcal/mol).
The subsequent B3-2a/2b reaction steps replenish the >B–OH group and rebuild the hydrogen bond interaction with the surrounding hydroxyl groups. This stabilizes the intermediate, which offers kinetic and thermodynamic driving forces and facilitates the B3-2a/2b reactions. In the meantime, owing to its larger molecule size, propane suffers from a more significant steric effect than dioxygen, which is detrimental for reaction steps B3-2a/2b. This shows that multiple factors, which may impose opposite impacts, can influence the catalytic reactions and stresses the importance of understanding the correlation between the microenvironment and the energetics. According to calculations, for the B3-2a and B3-2b reaction steps, there is only a marginal difference between the barriers in the four model systems (5.3, 3.4, 4.7, and 4.4 kcal/mol for the B3-2a step in models A, B, C, and D, respectively, and 3.5, 3.4, 4.4, and 1.4 kcal/mol for the B3-2b step, respectively).
The nascent propyl radical diffuses away from the catalyst surface and can react with gaseous oxidants, e.g., dioxygen, to detach another H atom to produce propene. The low free energy barrier (15.0 kcal/mol) and the exergonicity (−13.0 kcal/mol) of the formation of propene indicate can proceed facilely. Except for dioxygen, •OH, •OOH, and >BO• radicals can also detach another H atom to produce propene. These results have been reported in previous work (32) and were not studied here to avoid repetition.
Tetra-Coordinated Boron Sites (4coord-B)
In BPO4 crystal, the boron element exists in tetra-coordinated form (BO4), which is electron-rich in its surrounding and thus has properties different from those of the tri-coordinated boron in B2O3 and h-BN. The presence of ≡BOH functional groups on the surface of BPO4 has been identified. (9,33) The signal of surface tetra-coordinated boron species was also observed in the study of the ODHP process catalyzed by boron phosphate. (27) In addition, in the study of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene catalyzed by BPO4, the surface tetra-coordinated boron species was proposed to be the possible active site. (33) Thus, concerning the rich distribution of ≡BOH sites on the surface, it deserves to investigate their roles in the ODHP reaction.
Activation of the Surface B Site
The free energy profiles for the activation of the surface ≡B-OH sites are shown in Figure 6, and the corresponding structures are shown in Table S4.
Figure 6
Figure 6. Gibbs free energy profiles of the optimal reaction pathway at the surface ≡B–OH site on 4coord-B model calculated at 298.15 K and 1 atm.
The B4-1 reaction step converts the ≡B-OH site to the ≡B–O• species, which is reactive in dehydrogenating a propane molecule. The free energy barrier to the B4-1 reaction step at the ≡B–OH site is slightly lower than that at the >BOH site (B3-1), which is attributed to the higher nucleophilicity of the H atom of ≡BO–H than that of >BO–H (atomic charge 0.48e vs 0.49–0.54e).
Dehydrogenation of Propane at the Surface ≡B–O• Site
The release of the nascent •OOH radical and the access of propane to the ≡B–O• site is an endergonic process with an energy of about 10 kcal/mol (Figure 6). The active ≡B–O• site can then grab one hydrogen atom of the propane molecule at its primary-C (B4-2a) or secondary C (B4-2b) sites (Table S4). The free energy barrier to the abstraction of the secondary hydrogen atoms (2°-H, 6.5 kcal/mol) is lower than that to the abstraction of the primary hydrogen atoms (1°-H, 9.6 kcal/mol) owing to the weaker bond strength of the former than the latter in alkane. These values also indicate that the ≡B–O• site has lower activity to dehydrogenate propane.
Other Pathways at the ≡B–OH Site
In previous studies, the >BOH groups in B2O3 and h-BN were reported to be involved in the elimination of the alkoxyl radical, (34) which is an important intermediate leading to the deep oxidation of alkanes. This shows that oxygenated boron sites are inherently able to block the deep oxidation and offer high olefin selectivity. Here we extend this study and evaluate the possibility of the elimination of the propoxy radical at the ≡B-OH site to examine whether the tetra-coordinated boron species maintain the ability. The calculated free energy profile is shown in Figure 7.
Figure 7
Figure 7. Gibbs free energy profiles of the capture of propoxy radical at the tetra-coordinated B site (reaction step B4-propoxy-1) and its subsequent conversion to propene (reaction steps B4-propoxy-2 and B4-propoxy-3) on the 4coord-B model calculated at 298.15 K and 1 atm.
Capture of Propoxy Radical at the ≡B–OH Site
The reaction of propoxy radical with ≡B-OH is a two-step process. The two sequential elementary reactions were named as reactions B4-propoxy-1 and B4-propoxy-2, respectively (Figure 7). During the B4-propoxy-1 step, the propoxy radical accesses the ≡B–OH site and attaches onto the boron atom to form a B–O–R (R = C3H7O•) group on the surface (B4-propoxy-1). At the same time, a B–O bond of the B–O–P bridge is broken, forming a tetra-coordinated boron intermediate and a P═O site (see Table 2, RC in the B4-propoxy-1 step). Then, an •OH radical detaches from the tetra-coordinated intermediate to replenish the broken B–O–P bridge (B4-propoxy-2). This shows that during the reaction, via an SN2 mechanism, the boron on the BPO4 surface maintains its tetra-coordinated conformation when capturing the propoxy radicals in its vicinity. The total reaction process is equivalent to the substitution of a propoxy radical for the hydroxyl group.
Table 2. Key Stationary Points and Relative Free Energies (ΔG≠ and ΔG, in kcal/mol) in the Reactions of Propoxy on the 4coord-B Model and 4coord-B-H Model
aThese two reactions happen on the 4coord-B-H model (see Figure S5 for the 4coord-B-H model).
The free energy barrier to the addition of the propoxy radical is 31.7 kcal/mol (B4-propoxy-1 in Figure 7), which is higher than the value of 12.3 kcal/mol in B2O3. This is conceivable considering that the capture of the propoxy radical at the ≡B–OH sites requires energy to overcome the steric hindrance and to break the B–O bond in the B–O–P bridge. The reaction barrier to the subsequent step to release a hydroxyl radical (13.2 kcal/mol) is also marginally higher on BPO4 than that reported on B2O3 (10.6 kcal/mol).
The results indicate that under ODH conditions, similar to the tri-coordinated >B–OH site, the ≡B–OH site can also eliminate the alkoxyl radicals that diffuse to its vicinity following a mechanism similar to that at the >BOH sites in B2O3 or edge-hydroxylated h-BN.
Promotion Effect of Water Molecule on the Evolution of >B–O–R
The conversion of the nascent surface ≡B–O–C3H7 species to produce ≡BOH and propene is energy demanding, with a free energy barrier of 67.2 kcal/mol (B4-propoxy-3 in Figure 7), which is higher than that for the reported B–O–R decomposition on B2O3 (60.1 kcal/mol). (32) This high free energy barrier indicates that it is difficult to recover the surface boron hydroxyl sites from the B–O–R species via its direct decomposition. We note that in earlier studies of ODHP catalyzed by boron-containing catalysts, the deposit of carbon on the surface is negligible. (35) This suggests two possibilities: (1) under ODH conditions, the opportunities for alkoxyl radicals to collide onto the tetra-coordinated boron sites to substitute for the hydroxyl groups are low; (2) there are other more accessible pathways responsible for the conversion of the B–O–C3H7 species to restore the boron hydroxyl site on the surface.
In earlier studies, the cofeeding of water was reported to be able to accelerate the reaction rate of ODHP catalyzed by boron-containing catalysts, (36) while the underlying mechanism remains under debate. Here we examined whether it is possible for the water molecule to assist in the conversion of the propoxy group on the boron site (B–O–C3H7) to the olefin product.
We first evaluated the reaction at the tri-coordinated B site. By using a cluster model with a propoxy group bound on a tri-coordinated B site (RC in Figure 8a), the intramolecular hydrogen transfer was studied both in the absence and in the presence of a water molecule (Figure 8). The participation of water in the reaction resulted in a lower free energy barrier to the reaction (60.3 kcal/mol vs 68.1 kcal/mol). As there are no other atoms intervening with the hydrogen transfer from the alkyl group to the >B–O site, the water molecule did not introduce a new hydrogen bond with the sites other than the pair that donate and accept the hydrogen atom. The decrease in the free energy barrier is therefore attributed to the water molecule that bridges the migrating H atom and the >B–O site (Figure S4).
Figure 8
Figure 8. Key stationary points in the decomposition of the >BO-C3H7 group on the B2O3 model: (a) direct decomposition, (b) decomposition assisted by a water molecule.
We then examined the conversion of ≡B–OC3H7 to produce propene assisted by a water molecule on the 4coord-B model (Table 2, B4-propoxy-3w). The calculations reveal no significant gain in view of the free energy barrier (67.8 kcal/mol, B4-propoxy-3w in Table 2) compared to that of the direct decomposition (67.2 kcal/mol, B4-propoxy-3 in Table 2).
A careful examination of the active site shows that in the reactant complex ≡B–OC3H7 + H2O, there is an H-bond donated from the neighboring phosphate group to anchor the water molecule (Figure 9c), and the hydrogen transfer mediated by the water molecule requires the breakage of this H-bond to free the water molecule, which costs energy. In the transition state (Figure 9g), the liberated hydroxyl group of the phosphate rotates itself to donate the H-bond to the ≡B–O site.

For reaction with water, (c, g) for the 4coord-B-H model is (d, h). Only the active sites are shown for simplicity, and the full view of the models is shown in Figure S6.
To evaluate the effect of the hydrogen bond, the hydroxyl group that forms the hydrogen bond with the water molecule in 4coord-B model was replaced by a hydrogen atom. The modified model is named as 4coord-B-H (Figure S5). NBO charge analysis implies that the replacement of −OH by an H atom does not change the electrostatic properties of the atoms in the region of the active site (Table S5). RDG analysis shows that the hydrogen bond interaction formed with the participation of water molecules disappeared after the hydroxyl groups in the surrounding part were replaced by H atom (Figure 9c vs Figure 9d). The elimination of the H bond results in a lower free energy barrier for the ≡BO–R breakage assisted by a water molecule (59.6 kcal/mol, B4-propoxy-3w′ in Table 2) on the 4coord-B-H model than that for the direct bond breakage (68.8 kcal/mol, B4-propoxy-3′ in Table 2). This result shows that the involvement of water molecules can indeed facilitate the dissociation of the ≡BO–R bond.
Activation of the Surface B Site by •OH Radical
The in situ-generated •OH radical in reaction B4-propoxy-2 (Table 2) can then participate in the catalytic reactions by being involved in either gas phase channels, if diffused away from the surface, or surface channels, if detained in the vicinity of the surface boron sites. Owing to its high reactivity, it can easily activate the surface ≡B–OH sites of BPO4 with a free energy barrier of 12.2 kcal/mol and an exergonicity of 7.2 kcal/mol (Table 3, B4–OH). The low free energy barrier indicates that this reaction can help breed more active surface species and contribute to the rapid increase of reactivity observed in the experiment after the induction period. (35) The corresponding structures are shown in Table 3, B4–OH item.
Table 3. Key Stationary Points and Relative Free Energies (ΔG≠ and ΔG, in kcal/mol) in the reactions of the OH radical at ≡B–OH and Concerted Activation Reaction B4-3 on the 4coord-B Model
Concerted activation of propane and oxygen molecules
The mechanism of the concerted activation of propane and oxygen molecules co-present around the ≡B–OH site is also considered (Table 3, B4-3). The free energy barrier (66.6 kcal/mol) is moderately higher than those for the B4-1 (57.8 kcal/mol) and B3-1 (62.0 kcal/mol) reaction steps. This suggests that propane can also be activated following the concerted mechanism but is kinetically less favorable than following the stepwise mechanism. We note that, though both the concerted (B4-3) and the stepwise (B4-1 and B3-1) mechanisms are endergonic, the former has lower endergonicity (42.3 kcal/mol) than the latter two (57.4 and 53.6 kcal/mol), which shows that the concerted pathway has a gain thermodynamically than the stepwise ones.
Phosphate Sites (4coord-P)
ODH at the ≡PO• Site and Comparison with the ≡BO• Site
Activation of ≡P–OH and Its Ability to Dehydrogenate Propane
The activation of the surface ≡P–OH groups is also studied and compared to that of the surface ≡B–OH groups. The calculations show that it is moderately more difficult to activate the ≡P–OH groups (reaction step P-1, 61.1 kcal/mol, Figure 10. Structures of stationary points in Table S6) by dioxygen than to activate the ≡BOH site (57.8 kcal/mol to B4-1 step, Figure 6), while marginally easier than to activate the >BOH site (62.0 kcal/mol, B3-1 step, Table 1). This implies that the activation of all of the three types of surface hydroxyl groups (≡P–OH, ≡B–OH and >B–OH) of BPO4 by the oxygen molecule can happen under ODH conditions. The dehydrogenation of propane by the nascent ≡PO• species can proceed facilely in view of their free energy barriers (3.3 and 1.8 kcal/mol for the reactions P-2a/2b, respectively, Figure 10. Stationary points in Table S6).

Capture of Propoxy Radical at the ≡POH Site
The free energy profiles show that the reaction of the ≡POH site with propoxy radicals (Table 4, reaction P-3) is significantly different from that of ≡BOH. The reaction of the ≡BOH site with the propoxy radical is a two-step process, in which the ≡BOH site first forms an intermediate with the propoxy radical, then the intermediate is decomposed to release the •OH radical and the ≡B–O–P bond is reformed. At the ≡POH site, in contrast, no intermediate was located during the reaction of the ≡POH site with the propoxy radical. Structurally, the propoxy radical insertion was accompanied by the formation of a five-coordinated conformation (Table 4, reaction P-3, RC and TS) without the need to break the B–O–P bridge at the ≡POH site as in the case of the ≡BOH site.
Table 4. Key Stationary Points and Relative Free Energies (ΔG≠ and ΔG, in kcal/mol) in Reaction P-3–5 on the 4coord-B Model
Energetically, the free energy barrier to the capture of the propoxy radical by the ≡POH group (52.1 kcal/mol) is significantly higher than that by the ≡BOH group (31.7 kcal/mol). Therefore, the ability to eliminate propoxy radicals in the ODH catalytic systems can be considered as a unique ability of boron hydroxyl groups.
Activation of ≡POH Site by the •OH Radical
The free energy barrier for the activation of the ≡POH site by the •OH radical is 16.3 kcal/mol (Table 4, P-4), which is slightly higher than that for the ≡BOH site (12.2 kcal/mol). These results indicate that the •OH radical can easily activate both the surface ≡POH and ≡BOH groups, with the ≡POH site being moderately more difficult to be activated than the ≡BOH site.
Activation of ≡BOH Site by ≡PO• Site Via Intramolecular Hydrogen Transfer
In the present study, it was found that the ≡PO• site can activate the adjacent ≡BOH site by abstracting its hydrogen atom to form the active ≡BO• species (Table 4, P-5). The free energy barrier to this reaction is 15.5 kcal/mol, indicating that the ≡PO• site formed on the surface of BPO4 can breed the ≡BO• species should the ≡BOH capable of donating the H-bond to it is available.
Comparison of the Three Surface Sites
The above results indicate that the three types of surface sites of BPO4, i.e., ≡B–OH, ≡P–OH, and >B–OH, show moderately different dehydrogenation reactivities by dioxygen (free energy barrier of 57.8, 61.1, and 62.0 kcal/mol to the B4-1, P-1, and B3-1 step, respectively). All of their dehydrogenated counterparts can easily activate propane (9.6/6.5 kcal/mol at ≡B–O•, 3.3/1.8 kcal/mol at ≡P–O•, and 5.3/3.5 kcal/mol at >B–O• to dehydrogenate 1°-H/2°-H), while the access of propane to the nascent surface radical sites is endergonic and requires an energy input of 9.6/9.8, 25.4/15.8, and 20.2/1.3 kcal/mol at these sites, respectively, for the 1°-H/2°-H of propane. These data indicate that the tri-coordinated boron site shows superior reactivity to dehydrogenate the 2°-H of propane, and the tetra-coordinated B site can contribute to the dehydrogenation of both 1°-H and 2°-H of propane. The ≡P–O• is considered to contribute much less than the two types of boron site owing to the difficulty of propane in diffusing to its vicinity to build orbital interaction.
In order to understand their different behaviors in the ODH of propane, the electronic structures of their active sites were analyzed in terms of the projected density of states (PDOS). As seen in Figure 11, in their native states, the PDOS of O 2p shows a sharper and narrower distribution on the surface of 3coord-B and 4coord-B models than on the surface of the 4coord-P model, and there is a more significant overlap between the O 2p and P 2p than that between the O 2p and the B 2p. This suggests that the electrons in the ≡POH group are more confined in the P–O bond region, while those in the ≡B–OH and >B–OH groups have a higher propensity to delocalize in the whole group, implicating that the ≡POH group favors to be deprotonated rather than to be dehydrogenated. This is consistent with the larger endergonicity for the formation of the ≡PO• species (59.2 kcal/mol, Figure 10) than that of the ≡B–O• (57.4 kcal/mol, Figure 6) and >B–O• (53.6 kcal/mol, Figure 5) species, i.e., thermodynamically it requires more energy to detach an electron from the ≡POH group. Meanwhile, in the frontier region, there is less orbital overlap between the O and the leaving H atom in the ≡POH and the ≡B–OH groups than in the >B–OH group, indicating a weaker covalency of the ≡PO–H and the ≡BO–H bond, which is consistent with the marginally lower free energy to dehydrogenate the two sites.

Upon dehydrogenation, at all of the three sites, the PDOS distribution becomes narrower, and different from that of the ≡PO• species; both ≡B–O• and >B–O• sites show decreased overlap between O 2p and B 2p, suggesting that the unpaired electron is mainly confined in the O 2p orbitals. This explains the higher affinity of the two oxygenated boron sites for propane to activate the C–H bond. For the ≡PO• species, since it has a higher ability to delocalize the electron density, it displays a relatively lower propensity to interact with propane. Under ODH conditions, the ≡PO• species may contribute to the reaction by dehydrogenating the ≡B–OH group that donates the H-bond to it, thus breeding more ≡B–O• active sites.

A mechanistic study of BPO4-catalyzed ODHP reaction by means of density function theory calculations is reported. Three types of models with exposed boron hydroxyl sites (tri- and tetra-coordinated, denoted as 3coord-B and 4coord-B, respectively) and phosphate sites (denoted as 4coord-P) were prepared to evaluate the reactivity of BPO4 in ODHP (Figure 2). In these models, the >B–OH (3coord-B) (Figure 2a), ≡BOH (4coord-B) (Figure 2b), and ≡POH (4coord-P) (Figure 2c) sites are considered as the active sites. The calculations show that all of the three types of sites are active under ODH conditions.
The effect of surface morphology on the catalytic reaction was discussed. The 3coord-B model represents a defect on the surface with/without hydrogen bond donor/acceptors to restrain its vibration and differs from the other two in that it breaks the crystal lattice in its vicinity. To mimic the specific microenvironment of the 3coord-B model, four models were prepared with different restraining schemes that influence the ability of >B–OH to build hydrogen-bonding interactions with accessible hydrogen bond acceptors (Figure 3). Minimizing the hydrogen bonds by imposing more structure restraints favors the activation of the >B–OH sites.
The ODHP reaction at the >BOH, ≡BOH, and ≡POH sites proceeds similarly in a stepwise manner with the dehydrogenation of these sites by dioxygen followed by the activation of propane. The release of the nascent peroxy radical and the access of propane to the dehydrogenated surface sites (>B–O•, ≡B–O•, and ≡P–O•) is an endergonic process, which is lesser at the restrained >B–O• site than at the ≡B–O• and ≡P–O• sites. This results in the rate-determining step being the first step at the former site and being the second step at the latter two sites, suggesting that, different from BP, the presence of P element in BPO4 not only provides native ≡P–O• sites that can participate in the ODH reaction but also affects the rate-determining step of ODH at their neighboring ≡B–O• sites. At the surface >B–O• sites that are bridged with P by lattice O atoms, the P element reduces the activity compared to that in B2O3, but does not change the mechanism of dehydrogenation of the secondary H of propane. In addition, concerning the closely packed mode of BO4 and PO4 units in BPO4, the ≡PO• species were found to be able to activate the neighboring ≡BOH groups that donate the H-bond to it, thus offering an alternative manner to make use of gaseous dioxygen to breed active ≡PO• and ≡BO• sites.
In summary, this study shows that both surface-oxygenated boron and phosphate sites of BPO4 display reactivity toward the activation of propane under ODH conditions. Compared to B2O3, the alternatively assembled BO4 and PO4 units change the rate-determining step of ODHP by reducing the activity of the active sites. This knowledge enriches our understanding of the boron-based ODH systems and is expected to contribute to the development of catalysts with improved performance.
