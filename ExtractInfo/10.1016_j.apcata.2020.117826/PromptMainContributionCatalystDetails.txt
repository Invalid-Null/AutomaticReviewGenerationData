1. Introduction
The shale gas revolution in North America has produced an abundance of cheap propane [1], and the market demand for propylene has steadily increased because propylene is an important chemical building block [2]. The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) is an attractive process for directly converting propane to more valuable propylene [[3], [4], [5], [6], [7]]. Honeywell UOP (Oleflex) has commercialized this process using an alumina-supported Pt catalyst operated on a moving bed reactor [3]. Despite high initial propylene yields, these supported Pt catalysts are prone to deactivation and often have short lifetimes [3,4]; therefore, it is important to develop highly stable catalysts with long-term activities for PDH, which requires a fundamental understanding of the causes of catalyst deactivation.
Many studies have attributed catalyst deactivation to coke formation [[8], [9], [10], [11]]. Propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction that requires high temperatures (>500 °C) to obtain high propylene yields. Under these operating conditions, C3 species such as propylene are dehydrogenated to C1 and C2 species, which may serve as coke precursors. Through side reactions such as hydrogenolysis, cracking, oligomerization, cyclization, and aromatization, coke can form and block the active sites of catalysts, which impedes the catalytic activity and eventually deactivating the catalysts. Weckhuysen [10] carried out propane dehydrogenation at 590 ℃ for 6 h using Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, and thermogravimetric analysis showed that about 8.2 % coke was deposited on the spent catalyst. The addition of Sn inhibited coke formation by alloying with Pt. Relevant studies explained that Sn facilitates the desorption of the propylene product and increases the propylene selectivity [12,13]. Besides modifying Pt, the support also greatly influences the stability of Pt-Sn catalysts [14]. The supports with strong acidic sites such as γ-Al2O3 can catalyze side reactions such as isomerization, cracking, and polymerization, which enhance coke formation [11,15]. The stability of ZSM-5 zeolite-supported Pt-Sn was also unsatisfactory due to ZSM-5′s high acidity, which induced coke accumulation [16]. Thus, doping alkali (earth) metals such as Na [16], K [17], and Ca [18] or rare-earth metal La [19] in γ-Al2O3 or ZSM-5 has been studied to improve the catalyst stability by decreasing the catalyst acidity.
The addition of Sn and the use of a support with fewer/weaker acid sites can inhibit coke formation, so we prepared SiO2 or SBA-15-supported Pt-Sn alloy catalysts for lower alkane dehydrogenation in previous studies [[20], [21], [22], [23]]. Due to the inertness of SiO2 and the formation of a Pt3Sn alloy, the catalyst showed high resistance to coke formation; however, the initial high activity of the catalyst gradually deactivated over time [20,21,24]. Coked catalysts can be regenerated to restore their activity, and regeneration treatments typically involve exposing a coked catalyst to air at high temperatures to burn off coke deposits, followed by a reduction step that reactivates the catalyst (i.e., Pt-Sn alloys). Weckhuysen [10] found that after one regeneration process, Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst possessed a different activity and coke formation in subsequent dehydrogenation cycles. These observations suggest that coke formation is not the only reason for the deactivation of Pt-Sn catalyst during propane dehydrogenation. Besides coke, the structural and electronic properties of the active species on Pt-Sn/SiO2 during reactions and regeneration should be considered.
Bimetallic catalysts have complex structures that often differ depending on the reaction atmosphere (oxidizing, reductive, inert), temperature, and so on [[25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]]. Flexible and tunable structural changes of Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts also occurred under certain conditions. Uemura [31,32] treated a Pt-Sn bimetallic catalyst in oxygen at high temperatures, followed by a reduction step, and investigated the structure with in situ X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS). Pt3Sn alloy nanoparticles on Al2O3 transformed into metallic Pt and SnO2 during oxidation and then returned to Pt3Sn alloy in reduction by H2. Weckhuysen [10] also used XAFS to reveal a gradual Sn enrichment on the alloy surface after various dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.
Although the aforementioned works provide valuable knowledge about coke formation and the structural properties of Pt-Sn bimetallic systems during PDH, there is still no comprehensive understanding of the catalyst deactivation mechanism. Particularly, no studies have reported conclusive information regarding the basic principles of catalyst deactivation and regeneration of supported Pt-Sn catalysts for the dehydrogenation of lower alkanes. To comprehensively analyze catalyst deactivation, there is a need to establish an analysis procedure that integrates coke characterization with the behavior of active species on Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts during the dehydrogenation of propane and regeneration.
Therefore, this work systemically investigates Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts during their use and regenerations using a combination of TG-DTA, TEM, XRD, XAFS, and XPS. Based on these results, the causes of Pt-Sn/SiO2 deactivation are discussed. We hope these findings will be helpful to rationally design active Pt-based catalysts with high stabilities for propane dehydrogenation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
SiO2 (JRC-SIO-9, 334 m2 g−1) was used to support Pt-Sn active species. Before impregnation, SiO2 was calcined at 773 K for 3 h in air. Pt/SiO2 with 3 wt% Pt was prepared by impregnating SiO2 support with an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6･6H2O (Wako, 99.9 %) at 353 K for 3 h and dried at 353 K for 20 h. The obtained precipitate was noted as Pt/SiO2 precursor. A bimetallic Pt-Sn/SiO2 precursor with a 1.0 M ratio of Sn: Pt was prepared by impregnating the Pt/SiO2 precursor with an acetone solution of SnCl2･2H2O (Wako, 97 %) at 353 K for 3 h and drying at 353 K for 20 h.
2.2. Dehydrogenation of propane
Before the reaction, the catalyst precursor (50 mg) was loaded in a quartz reactor (i.d. 10 mm) and reduced in situ by 20 vol% H2 diluted with N2 (total flow rate: 50 mL min−1) at 1073 K for 1 h to obtain the initial Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst. The temperature was then decreased to 773 K in N2 (100 mL min−1). After reduction, a gas mixture of C3H8 and N2 (20/80, 100 mL min-1) was introduced to the reactor. The reaction then proceeded at 773 K for 7 h with 20,000 h-1 of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV). The catalyst after the catalytic reaction was noted as “reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2”. A gas mixture of C3H8/H2/N2 (20/5/75) was used as the feed gas. The catalyst after the catalytic reaction was noted as “reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 with H2”. The gas composition was analyzed with an on-line gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A, Japan) equipped with TCD (Molecular Sieve 5A column) and methanizer FID (Porapak-Q column) detectors.
2.3. Catalyst regeneration processes
(1)
Regeneration with reduction
After 7 h of propane dehydrogenation, the sample was regenerated at 1073 K in a mixture of H2 (10 mL min−1) and N2 (40 mL min−1) for 1 h. Then, the catalyst was cooled to 773 K in N2 (100 mL min−1). The catalyst regenerated using the reduction method was noted as “Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R)”.
(2)
Regeneration with oxidation-reduction
After the propane dehydrogenation proceeded for 7 h, the sample was regenerated at 773 K in a gas mixture of O2 (10 mL min−1) and N2 (40 mL min−1) for 1 h, followed by reduction at 1073 K in a mixture of H2 (10 mL min−1) and N2 (40 mL min−1) for another 1 h. The obtained catalyst was cooled to 773 K in N2 (100 mL min−1). This regenerated catalyst with oxidation-reduction was noted as “Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR)”.
2.4. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a RINT-TTR III powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) with Cu Kα radiation (λ=1.5405 Å, 50 kV, 300 mA). Samples were scanned from 2θ = 38° to 46° at a scanning resolution of 0.01°.
High angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscope (HADDF-STEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-3200FS transmission electron microscope. Samples were prepared by depositing drops of ethanol suspensions containing small amounts of the powders onto carbon-coated copper grids (Okenshoji Co., Ltd.), followed by evaporation of ethanol in the air.
X-ray absorption experiments were carried out at the BL01B1 at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). The ring energy was 8 GeV, and the stored current was 99.5 mA. The Pt L3-edge (11.56 keV) X-ray absorption spectra were recorded using a Si (111) monochromator in transmission mode in the air at room temperature. Sn K-edge (29.19 keV) X-ray absorption spectra were recorded using a Si (311) monochromator in fluorescence mode in the air at room temperature. Data processing was performed using REX2000 Ver.2.5.9 (Rigaku) and FEFF8.40 programs. Pt foil and Sn foil were purchased from Nilaco Corp., and SnO2 (98 %) was purchased from Wako Corp.
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were acquired using an ULVAC PHI 5500 M T with Mg Kα radiation (15 kV, 400 W) in a chamber with a base pressure of ∼10−7 Pa. All spectra were calibrated using Si 2p (103.5 eV) as the reference. Peak fitting was performed for Sn 3d5/2 using XPSPeak 4.1 software (UK Surface Analysis Forum). The Shirley function was used for background subtraction.
The amount of coke formed over the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst after the reaction for 7 h at 773 K was measured by thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA, Shimadzu DTG-60H, Japan) in air.
3. Results
3.1. Propane dehydrogenation
Fig. 1 shows the propane conversion over Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst in the first run. In the absence of hydrogen in the feed gas, the initial propane conversion was 23.7 %, which decreased to 15.5 % after 7 h. The amount of coke on the reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst was estimated to be ca. 2.8 wt% by TG-DTA (Table 1). This was smaller than the 7.3 wt% on Pt-Sn/Al2O3 (after 6 h of reaction at 590 ℃) reported by Weckhuysen [10], and 4.9 wt% on Pt-Sn/ZnAl2O4 (after 4 h of reaction and 600 ℃) reported by Vu [9]. This lower value was probably due to the lower reaction temperature (500 ℃) and the amorphous SiO2 support used in this study. The acid strength of SiO2 is weaker than Al2O3 and ZnAl2O4; thus, it inhibited propylene dehydrogenation or intermediate adsorption (coke precursors) on SiO2-supported catalysts. In the presence of hydrogen, the initial propane conversion was 23.4 %, which was very similar to the case without hydrogen; however, it slightly decreased throughout the reaction and was 19.1 % after 7 h, suggesting a lower catalyst deactivation rate when a small amount of hydrogen was added to the feed gas. The amount of coke on reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 was very small (ca. 0.7 %), which shows that adding hydrogen to the feed gas inhibited coke formation and improved the stability of Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst.

Catalyst Coke amount (wt%)
Pt-Sn/SiO2 0.0
reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 without H2 2.8
reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 with H2 0.7
Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R) 0.7
reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R) 0.1
Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR) 0.0
reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR) 0.6
The Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst after the first reaction run without H2 co-feeding was regenerated with H2 at 1073 K for 1 h (Reduction method, denoted as Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R)) or with O2 at 773 K for 1 h and subsequent H2 reduction at 1073 K for 1 h (oxidation-reduction method, denoted as Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR)). Table 1 shows that both regeneration methods eliminated the coke formed on the reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst. The amount of coke remaining on Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R) was only 0.7 %, and no coke remained on Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR). The catalytic activities of the regenerated catalysts (the second reaction run) are shown in Fig. 1. Using the Reduction method, the activity of the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst slightly recovered (16.5 %). In contrast, it was remarkably recovered using the oxidation-reduction method, and the initial propane conversion of Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR) was 20.2 %.
In the second run, however, the activities of regenerated Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts via the two regeneration methods gradually decreased without H2 co-feeding. The propane conversion using Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R) decreased to 9.9 % after 7 h, and the conversion using Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR) decreased from 20.2%–13.0% after 7 h. Moreover, the amount of coke formed during the second run was different from that in the first run, and only 0.1 % coke was formed on the reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R), while 0.6 % was formed on the reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR).
3.2. Coke deposition on catalysts
Figure S1 shows the TG/DTA curves of the catalysts, which shows that little coke was deposited on these catalysts (Table 1). When we carried out propane dehydrogenation at 500 ℃ for 7 h with SiO2-supported Pt-Sn catalysts, only about 2.8 % coke was deposited on the spent catalysts. When H2 was co-fed in the reaction gas, only 0.7 % coke was detected. Although both regeneration methods eliminated coke, the efficiency of hydrogen in the “reduction” method was lower than that of oxygen in the “oxidation-reduction” method, which completely burned the coke off. In the second reaction cycle, very little coke was deposited on reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R) and Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR).
3.3. XRD patterns of the catalysts
Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts. As the reference, the Pt/SiO2 catalyst contains two diffraction peaks at 2θ = 39.8° and 46.3°, corresponding to the (111) and (200) of face-centered cubic (FCC) Pt [33,34]. Before the reaction, the Pt-Sn/SiO2 pattern contained diffraction peaks attributed to Pt3Sn alloy (ICSD 105,796) and PtSn alloy (ICSD 105,796) [34]. These peaks were detailedly assigned to Pt3Sn(111) (2Ө = 38.96°), PtSn(102) (2Ө = 41.73°), PtSn(110) (2Ө = 44.08°), and Pt3Sn(200) (2Ө = 45.28°) [35]. A small peak appeared near 2Ө = 39.6°, which was assigned to Pt0.94Sn0.06 alloy (ICSD 105,798). Its crystal structure was FCC, similar to Pt metal and Pt3Sn (Fig. S2). No diffraction peaks of Sn compounds, such as Sn metal or Sn oxides (SnO and SnO2), were observed.

The XRD patterns of reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts (Fig. 2c and d) were similar to that of the fresh catalyst, which indicated that the crystal structure of Pt species did not significantly change throughout the reaction with or without co-fed H2. Although no significant changes were observed in the patterns of the regenerated catalysts (Fig. 2e and f), the intensity of the diffraction peaks of PtSn alloy over Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R) was slightly stronger than that of Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR), while the diffraction peak intensity of Pt3Sn alloy remained unchanged. This suggests that the “oxidation-reduction” regeneration method favors the formation of Pt3Sn alloy. After the second reaction run of the regenerated catalysts, Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R) (Fig. 2e) and reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R) (Fig. 2e’) exhibited similar patterns. In contrast, the intensity of the Pt3Sn and PtSn alloy diffraction peaks over Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR) increased slightly.
3.4. HADDF-STEM images of Pt-Sn/SiO2
An increase in the metal nanoparticle size in heterogeneous catalysis is referred to as sintering [36], which is often regarded as an important reason for the loss of catalyst activity because it decreases the number of active sites. Fig. 3 shows the HAADF-STEM images of Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts before and after the reaction. According to the particle size distribution, the average size of Pt-Sn alloy nanoparticles on the fresh catalyst was 1.7 ± 0.7 nm. After propane dehydrogenation, the average particle size was 1.2 ± 0.5 nm on the reacted catalyst with H2 co-feeding, and 1.2 ± 0.6 nm without H2 co-feeding. No Pt-Sn alloy nanoparticle sintering was observed after 7 h of reaction.

Fig. S3 also shows HAADF-STEM images of Pt-Sn/SiO2(R), Pt-Sn/SiO2(OR), reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2(R), and reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2(OR). Their average particle sizes were similar to each other and were only slightly different during regeneration and the second reaction run.
3.5. XAFS analysis
3.5.1. Pt L3-edge XAFS
The Pt L3-edge X-ray absorption white lines correspond to electronic transitions of 2p3/2 core-level states and indicate the final vacant d states of both the 5d3/2 and 5d5/2 levels of platinum [37,38]. Lytle et al. [37] reported that the intensity of the Pt L3 X-ray absorption spectra is concerned to the d-electron valences and the chemical environments of Pt atoms. Fig. 4 shows the Pt L3-edge XANES spectra of Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts and Pt foil. The white line intensity at the Pt L3-edge of the initial catalyst (Pt-Sn/SiO2 reduced at 1073 K) was slightly lower than that of Pt foil, which indicated electron donation from Sn to Pt due to alloying between Pt and Sn. Uemura et al. [31,32] reported a lower white line intensity of Pt in Pt-Sn/Al2O3 than in Pt foil. Kim et al. [39] also reported that the intensity of the white line at the Pt L3-edge was lower in Pt-Sn/C catalysts than Pt/C catalysts. They attributed this decreased intensity to the formation of a Pt-Sn alloy since the d-electron density of Pt atoms increased when alloyed with Sn atoms, which are less electronegative than Pt. The k3-weighted EXAFS oscillation at the Pt L3-edge of Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts and Pt foil is displayed in Fig. S4, which also confirmed the alloy nature of Pt-Sn species.

Fig. 4 shows that the white line intensities at Pt L3-edge of reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts were quite similar to the initial catalyst (Fig. 4(B)), which indicated that Pt has a similar d-electron density before and after the reaction. Compared with reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 without H2, the peak positions at the Pt L3-edge of regenerated Pt-Sn/SiO2 (Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R) and Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR)) shifted to higher energies with similar white line intensities, as shown in Fig. 4(C). This implied that the fraction of Pt-Sn alloys changed during regeneration.
3.5.2. Sn K-edge XANES spectra
Fig. 5 shows the Sn K-edge XANES spectra of Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts and reference samples (Sn foil and SnO2). The absorption band intensity of the initial catalyst was higher than that of Sn foil, but lower than that of SnO2. The absorption band intensity of reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 ((b) and (c)) was nearly the same as the initial one. Moreover, the absorption band intensities of regenerated Pt-Sn/SiO2 were also similar to those of reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2, regardless of the regeneration method. These results suggest that a mixture of Sn(0) and Sn cations (Sn(II) and Sn(IV)) were present on the fresh, reacted, and regenerated Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts.

3.6. XPS analysis of Pt-Sn/SiO2
Both XRD and XAFS, which penetrate the entire sample, are bulk characterization techniques, but XPS is a surface-sensitive technique whose signals arise within a few nanometers of the outermost layers of a sample. Thus, XPS can be used to reflect the chemical environment of the catalyst surface that contacts gases or liquids during heterogeneous catalysis. The Pt 4f and Sn 3d XPS data in Fig. 6a and Table 2 show that the binding energies of Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 peaks in the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst were 71.3 and 74.6 eV. The state of Pt0 on the catalyst was indicated. After 7 h of reaction with or without H2, the intensity of the Pt 4f7/2, 4f5/2 peak in the reacted catalyst (spectrum (b) or (c)) greatly decreased. Similarly, the intensities of the Sn peak decreased in the reacted catalysts, especially for reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 without H2 because coke deposition may have attenuated the surface Pt and Sn signals. The reacted catalyst with H2 co-feeding possessed slightly stronger Pt and Sn signals than in the absence of H2, and the amount of coke formed on the previous one is consistently smaller than that on the latter.

reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR) 71.4 486.4 1.9 3.1*10−3 5.9*10−3 9.0*10−3
More importantly, the position of the Pt 4f7/2, 4f5/2 peaks in the catalyst reacted without H2 co-feeding shifted to a higher binding energy, which indicated that the chemical states of surface Pt atoms in the Pt-Sn alloy changed during the reaction. Coincidentally, the binding energy of the Sn 3d5/2 peak over the reacted catalyst without H2 was also higher than those of the initial catalyst and the reacted catalyst with H2, suggesting a weakening of Pt-Sn interactions in alloys. The deconvoluted Sn 3d5/2 XPS spectra (Fig. S5 (A)) revealed that the surface ratio of Sn0/SnIV on the fresh catalyst was 33:67. After 7 h of reaction in the absence of H2, the surface ratio of Sn0/SnIV was remarkably lower (Fig. S5 (C)). It seems that surface SnIV enrichment in Pt-Sn alloys occurred during the reaction, especially in the absence of H2 in the feed gas. The geometric arrangement Pt and Sn atoms in Pt-Sn alloys may have changed, which was also verified by the different Sn/Pt ratios over the initial and reacted catalysts (Table 2). The Sn/Pt ratio was 1 in the initial (unreacted) catalyst, which is consistent with the added amount of Sn and Pt during catalyst preparation; however, this ratio increased to 1.6 in the reacted catalyst in the absence of co-fed H2, which suggests Sn segregation from Pt-Sn alloys during the reaction. Fortunately, the small amount of co-fed H2 inhibited such Sn enrichment on the catalyst surface, and an Sn/Pt ratio of 1.1 preserved the high activity of Pt-Sn alloys. The Sn/Pt ratios of reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R) (Sn/Pt = 1.8) and Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR) (Sn/Pt = 1.9) after the second reaction cycle continuously increased without co-fed H2.
After regenerating the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst reacted without H2, the Pt 4f7/2, 4f5/2 peaks of Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R) and Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR) catalysts (spectrum (d) and (e) in Fig. 6(A)) shifted towards lower binding energy, and showed the similar position to the initial Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst. The Sn 3d5/2 peaks of Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R) and Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR) catalysts (spectrum (d) and (e) in Fig. 6(B)) slightly shifted to lower binding energies than the reacted catalyst without H2. However, neither the “Reduction” treatment nor “Oxidation-Reduction” regeneration methods completely recovered the surface properties of the reacted catalyst compared with the initial catalyst (spectrum (a) in Fig. 6). The intensities of the Pt and Sn XPS signals of Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR) and Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R) catalysts were lower. Fig. S6 shows the XRD patterns of Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR), Pt L3-edge XANES spectra, and Sn K-edge XANES spectra of oxidized reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 in the air at 773 K for 1 h, and Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR). The oxidation of reacted catalysts in the air at 773 K for 1 h formed Pt and SnO2, and subsequent reduction in H2 resulted in Pt-Sn alloying.
Moreover, no obvious peak shifts over the regenerated catalysts were observed in the second reaction run (spectrum (f) and (g) in Fig. 6), probably due to the weak peak intensity. After the second reaction run, the reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R) and reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 (DR) showed similar Pt and Sn XPS signals to Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R) and Pt-Sn/SiO2 (DR).
4. Discussion
Coke formation is often the principal cause of deactivation in the petrochemical industry due to high operation temperatures [40]. For the supported-metal catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation, coke is normally deposited on both the metal and the acid support [11]. On the metal, a coke precursor will be generated if propane is deeply dehydrogenated or polymerized. This coke can migrate to acid sites on the supports, and undergo polymerization/oligomerization, condensation, cyclization, and hydride transfer, resulting in the formation of additional coke [8,15]; therefore, coke accommodate over highly acidic supports such as Al2O3 [17,19] and ZSM-5 [18], resulting in poor stabilities.
In this work, SiO2 was used as the support. Due to its surface inertness (low acidity) [14], coke formation on the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst prepared by the direct reduction method (H2 atmosphere, 1073 K, 1 h) was significantly decreased. The highest coke amount was only about 2.8 % on the spent catalyst in the absence of H2 in the feed gas. XPS analysis of this catalyst shows that coke formation on the catalyst surface weakened the XPS signals of both Pt and Sn. During the regeneration stage, both “reduction” and “oxidation-reduction” methods eliminated coke formed on the reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst without H2, even though hydrogen was less efficient in the “reduction” method than oxygen in the “oxidation-reduction” method. Only 0.7 % coke remained on Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R), and no coke remained on Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR). More interestingly, less coke formed during the second reaction run, with only 0.6 % on reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR), and the coke on the reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R) decreased from 0.7 % to 0.1 %; however, the activities of both Pt-Sn/SiO2 (R) and Pt-Sn/SiO2 (OR) decreased with the reaction time, indicating poor stabilities. These results indicated that besides coke formation, other factors were responsible for catalyst deactivation during the second reaction run.
TEM images showed no obvious metal particle aggregation after reaction and regenerations. XRD analysis and XAFS spectra confirmed the formation of Pt-Sn alloys over these catalysts, but the fraction of bulk Pt-Sn alloy phases changed slightly during the reactions and regenerations, and the atomic environments of Pt and Sn were also slightly different, as reflected by the XAFS spectra.
The Sn 3d5/2 peak of reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst without H2 in the first reaction run shifted towards a higher binding energy than the peaks over the initial catalyst and the reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst with H2. This suggested that more surface Sn oxides were present on the reacted Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst without H2. Virnovskaia [41] once found that when pure PtSn2 alloy going form reduction to reaction conditions, the amount of reduced Sn decreased to <10 %. In the case of propane dehydrogenation, alloyed Sn (Sn°) may separate from Pt-Sn alloys when the reaction atmosphere is a mixture of propane and nitrogen. The addition of small amounts of H2 to the feed gas (5%) appears to help retain Pt-Sn alloys. The separation of alloyed Sn was inhibited, and the catalyst stability during 7 h of reaction was greatly improved. H2 addition in the feed gas also inhibited coke formation by reducing the formation of coke precursor by inhibiting deep propane dehydrogenation over metal sites. The amount of coke formed on the spent catalyst with H2 was only about 0.7 %.
Therefore, besides coke formation, the separation of alloyed Sn and weakened Pt-Sn interactions also contributed to catalyst deactivation. The surface fraction of Pt-Sn alloys, their morphologies, or their detailed surface atomic arrangements on Pt-Sn/SiO2 likely changed after propane dehydrogenation and regeneration (Scheme 1).

5. Conclusions
The catalytic deactivation and regeneration over Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst during propane dehydrogenation were investigated by catalytic tests and characterization techniques. It was found that:
(1)
About 2.8 wt% coke deposited on the reacted catalyst after 7 h of reaction without H2 feed. A small amount of H2 in the feed gas effectively decreased the coke amount and improved the catalyst stability, and only 0.7 wt% coke formed on the reacted catalyst in the presence of H2. The subsequent “Reduction” or “Oxidation-Reduction” regeneration methods resulted in the partial or complete elimination of coke deposited on the reacted catalyst. A trace amount of coke formed during the second reaction run.
(2)
The HAADF-STEM images showed that dispersed Pt was stable before and after propane dehydrogenation for 7 h. The particle sizes remained in the range of ca. 1.2–1.7 nm, suggesting that no particle sintering occurred.
(3)
The surface composition of Pt-Sn alloys and their morphologies probably redistributed during the reactions and regeneration. The addition of H2 in the feed gas appeared to help retain the surface states of active species on fresh Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts during the reaction. The “reduction” regeneration method partially regenerated the active Pt-Sn alloy phases. With respect to oxidation-reduction regeneration, Sn segregated from the Pt-Sn alloy during the calcination step and then re-alloyed with Pt under reduction conditions. This phenomenon led to strong interactions between Pt and Sn, which resulted in a greater recovery in the catalytic activity over the reacted catalyst.
