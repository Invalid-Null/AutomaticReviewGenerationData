Dealing with a local heating effect when measuring catalytic solids in a reactor with Raman spectroscopy
In continuation of our previous work on the applicability of the G(R∞) correction factor for the quantification of Raman spectra of coke during propane dehydrogenation experiments (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2005, 7, 211), research has been carried out on the potential of this correction factor for the quantification of supported metal oxides during reduction experiments. For this purpose, supported chromium oxide catalysts have been studied by combined in situ Raman and UV-Vis spectroscopy during temperature programmed reduction experiments with hydrogen as reducing agent. The goal was to quantify on-line the amount of Cr6+ in a reactor based on the measured in situ Raman spectra. During these experiments, a significant temperature effect was observed, which has been investigated in more detail with a thermal imaging technique. The results revealed a temperature ‘on the spot’ that can exceed 100 °C. It implies that Raman spectroscopy can have a considerable effect on the local reaction conditions and explains observed inconsistencies between the in situ UV-Vis and Raman data. In order to minimize this heating effect, reduction of the laser power, mathematical matching of the spectroscopic data, a different cell design and a change in reaction conditions has been evaluated. It is demonstrated that increasing the reactor temperature is the most feasible method to solve the heating problem. Next, it allows the application of in situ Raman spectroscopy in a reliable quantitative way without the need of an internal standard.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
