The given document does not directly pertain to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation for conversion of propane to propylene. Though it mentions propane oxidation, the focus is on complete combustion to CO2 rather than selective dehydrogenation to propylene. No propylene yield or selectivity is reported. Therefore, I have indicated that the document is not relevant to the target application.
