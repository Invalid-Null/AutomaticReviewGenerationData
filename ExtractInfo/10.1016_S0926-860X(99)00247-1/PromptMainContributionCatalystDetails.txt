Structure and catalytic combustion activity of atomically dispersed Pt species at MgO surface
Abstract
We have investigated the structure of Pt(A)/MgO and PtMo6/MgO catalysts which were prepared from Pt(C5H7O2)2 and [PtMo6O24]8− followed by calcination, respectively, and their catalytic activities for the propane + O2 reaction. The Pt(A)/MgO and PtMo6/MgO catalysts with atomically dispersed Pt ions were found to be as active as metallic Pt particles supported on MgO for propane combustion. A distorted spinel-like structure around Pt ion embedded at the MgO surface was proposed for the active Pt species by means of EXAFS. The atomically dispersed Pt structure was reduced with propane at 623 K to form Pt6 clusters with Pt–O bonding to the MgO support. The Pt cluster chemically attached to the MgO surface was selective for the propane dehydrogenation. Restructuring of the Pt clusters to the atomically dispersed Pt structure was observed by oxidation with O2 at 623 K.
1. Introduction
Magnesium oxide which has a rock salt type structure has been used as a support material for metal catalysts. [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17] The (1 0 0) plane is regarded as the most stable surface of MgO, which is a neutral plane composed of stoichiometric Mg2+ cations and O2− anions. [18] Mg–O bond has an ionic character and Mg2+ ions can be cation-exchanged by additive cations. For instance, when MgO is impregnated with aqueous solutions of Ni and Co nitrates and heated to 773 K, Ni and Co ions substitute Mg ions to make solid solutions. [3], [5], [19] When Fe3+ is incorporated to MgO lattice, Fe2MgO4 spine-like clusters are formed and distributed in the lattice [3].
It has been demonstrated that a MgO-supported Pt–Mo catalyst (PtMo6/MgO) prepared by using an inorganic cluster [PtMo6O24]8− as a precursor showed much higher activities for the dehydrogenation reactions of propane, butane and isobutane to the corresponding alkenes than conventional Pt/MgO and Pt–Mo/MgO catalysts prepared by an impregnation method using aqueous solutions of H2PtCl6 and H2PtCl6 + (NH4)6[Mo7O24], respectively [9], [10]. Moreover, the PtMo6/MgO catalyst showed high resistance to catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. [9], [10] Such performance of PtMo6/MgO is attributed to a unique structure of Pt atoms embedded at the MgO surface lattice and to formation of an effective ensemble of Pt–Mo at the surface [9], [10].
A similar but less ordered structure of Pt sites can also be formed by using Pt(C5H7O2)2 as a precursor. In the catalytic reaction conditions the atomically embedded Pt atoms are clusterized probably to a Pt6 structure which strongly interacts with the MgO surface through Pt–Mg and Pt–O bonds and the Pt clusters behave as active sites for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The clusters are stable upto 723 K and transformed to 1.0 nm Pt particles without direct bonding with the MgO surface at 773 K. The performance of the metallic Pt particles becomes close to that of the conventional Pt catalysts.
The performance of PtMo6/MgO is thermodynamically restricted. To achieve high conversion of the dehydrogenation reactions, high temperature operation is required, which causes rapid deactivation of catalysts due to coking and destruction of the active Pt ensemble to less active, large Pt particles. On the other hand, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes overcomes the thermodynamical problem and the presence of oxygen can also reduce carbon deposition on the catalyst. It is also the aim of this study to examine the possibility that the gas phase oxygen may promote the stability and behavior of surface Pt sites to prevent the Pt clusters from growing to particles.
In this paper we investigated the catalytic properties and structures of Pt/MgO derived from Pt(acac)2 and Pt Mo6/MgO derived from [PtMo6O24]8− in the oxidation of propane with O2 as a test reaction. It was found that the catalysts with a monomeric Pt structure dispersed at the MgO surface lattice the catalysts were active for combustion of propane at low reaction temperatures, where no Pt particles were observed by EXAFS. It was also found that the atomically dispersed Pt structure was reversibly restructured with Pt6 clusters on the MgO surface at 623 K, depending on the atmosphere. This unique feature of the present catalysts may provide the potential application to other total and selective oxidation systems.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
A MgO support was prepared by calcination of Mg(OH)2 (Soekawa Chemicals; 99.9%) at 773 K for 2 h in air. Pt ions were supported on the MgO by an impregnation method using an acetone solution of Pt(C5H7O2)2 (Pt(acac)2) followed by evaporation at 318 K and drying at 378 K for 24 h. The resultant sample was calcined at 773 K for 2 h in a flow of O2 + He. The catalyst thus obtained is denoted as Pt(A)/MgO. A heteropolyanion with plane structure (NH4)4[H4PtMo6O24]·2H2O was prepared in a similar way to that reported previously [9], [10], [20], [21]. The PtMo6/MgO catalyst was prepared by impregnating MgO with an aqueous solution of (NH4)4[H4PtMo6O24]·2H2O followed by evacuation at 353 K to remove the solvent at room temperature. The obtained sample was calcined at 773 K for 2 h in a flow of O2 + He. The loadings of Pt were 1 wt.% for both Pt(A)/MgO and PtMo6/MgO catalysts. The BET surface areas of Pt(A)/MgO and PtMo6/MgO were 100 and 90 m2/g, respectively. Pt(Cl)/MgO and Pt-Mo(Cl)/MgO were obtained by an impregnation method using H2PtCl6 and H2PtCl6 + (NH4)6Mo7O24 as described previously. [9], [10]
2.2. Catalytic reactions
The catalytic performance of the samples for propane combustion was examined in a fixed-bed flow reactor, which was composed of mass flow controllers, a Pyrex-glass reactor and an on-line gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A). Reactor temperature was controlled by a PID temperature controller using a K-type thermocouple placed between the reactor and a furnace. Reaction temperature was independently measured by another K-type thermocouple in a Pyrex capillary which was inserted in the catalyst bed. A typical weight of catalysts employed in this study was 0.1 g. The sample was pretreated at 773 K for 2 h in a flow of O2 and He (1 : 1) in situ before using as catalyst. The products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph with a 2 m Porapak Q column.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) measurements were carried out at BL10B of Photon Factory in Institute for Material Structure Science (PF-IMSS) (proposal No. 94G202). Synchrotron radiation emitted from a 2.5 GeV storage ring was monochromatized by a Si (3 1 1) channel cut monochromator. The incident and transmitted X-rays were monitored by ionization chambers filled with N2 and Ar/N2 (1 : 4) gases, respectively. Sample thickness was regulated for total X-ray absorbance to be less than 3. Choice of the detection gases, adjustment of the appropriate sample thickness and the low ring energy made the effect of higher harmonics negligible. EXAFS analysis was carried out by using a commercially available program package (‘REX’) which involves preedge extrapolation, background removal using a cubic smoothing, Fourier transformation and curve fitting on the inversely Fourier transformed data in k-space. [22] The typical Fourier transformation range was 30–130 nm−1. The curve fitting analysis was carried out using the following EXAFS formula;

The amplitude and phase shift functions (F(k) and σ(k)) for Pt–O, Pt–Mg and Pt–Pt were derived from the FEFE6 code. [23], [24], [25] The amplitude reduction factors (S) for O and Pt were calculated from Pt–O of (NH4)4[H4PtMo6O24]·2H2O and Pt foil, respectively. The S value for Pt–Mg was set to 0.9 because the S values for Pt–Pt and Pt–O were 0.86 and 0.92.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation was performed on JEM-4000 (JEOL) operated at 400 keV. We counted more than 500 particles in 10 TEM pictures (magnification: ×500 000).
3. Results
3.1. Activities of Pt(A)/MgO and PtMo6/MgO for propane oxidation
Fig. 1 shows the catalytic activities of Pt(A)/MgO and PtMo6/MgO for C3H8 oxidation as a function of reaction temperature. Flow rates of O2 and C3H8 were 2 and 8 ml min−1, respectively, diluted with 90 ml min−1 He at atmospheric pressure (total flow rate = 100 ml min−1). CO2 yield was calculated based on propane conversion and CO2 selectivity. The broken line in Fig. 1 is a maximum value for the propane combustion under the excess propane condition. The oxidation of propane with O2 on Pt(A)/MgO to CO2 started at 473 K and all the O2 was consumed at 540 K. The combustion started at the lower temperature by about 100 K than that for the dehydrogenation reaction of C3H8 to C3H6 on Pt(A)/MgO. [10] The PtMo6/MgO catalyst showed a similar activity to that of Pt(A)/MgO as shown in Fig. 1(b). Thus the effect of Mo around Pt on the activity towards combustion is small. No products other than CO2 could be found in these reaction conditions.

Broken line indicates a maximum value for the combustion under the condition; Flow rates of O2 and C3H8 were 2 and 8 ml min−1, respectively, diluted by 90 ml min−1 He (total flow rate = 100 ml min−1), at atmospheric pressure.
When the composition of reaction gases was changed to the excess O2 conditions, i.e. typically O2/C3H8 = 9.8 : 0.2 balanced with He (total flow rate : 100 ml min−1), the reaction started at 500 K and reached the 100% conversion at 730 K as shown in Fig. 2 (a) for Pt(A)/MgO and Fig. 2(b) for PtMo6/MgO. When PtMo6/MgO is exposed to propane in the absence of oxygen at 573–723 K, Pt clusters active for the C3H8 dehydrogenation to C3H6 + H2 are formed [9], [10]. The active Pt clusters are further aggregated to much less active, larger Pt particles at 773 K [9], [10]. Fig. 3 shows the propane combustion reactions against the reaction temperature on the Pt clusters in PtMo6/MgO produced by the reduction of the catalyst with C3H8 at 573 K and on the Pt particles produced by the reduction with C3H8 at 773 K. The Pt clusters (Fig. 3(a)) were much more active than the Pt particles (Fig. 3(b)) and unreduced PtMo6/MgO (Fig. 1(b)). The performance of Pt(A)/MgO reduced with propane at 623 and 773 K is shown in Fig. 4. The combustion on the Pt(A)/ MgO catalyst reduced at 623 K started at 420 K and the CO2 yield at 500 K was 3%, while the combustion on the Pt(A)/MgO catalyst reduced with propane at 773 K stored at 450 K and the CO2 yield at 500 K was as small as 1.2%.

If active Pt clusters were formed during the propane combustion under the excess propane conditions and increasing reaction temperatures, a hysterisis between the first and second performances as a function of reaction temperature would be observed because of a large difference in the activities of Pt clusters in the reduced catalyst and Pt monomers in the oxidized catalyst. However, the reaction started almost at the same temperature and showed almost the same profile in the first and second ramping processes.
3.2. EXAFS analysis
Fig. 6 shows the k3-weighted EXAFS oscillations of Pt(A)/MgO and PtMo6/MgO together with EXAFS oscillations of other samples. The oscillations for Pt(A)/MgO and PtMo6/MgO are similar to each other, but long range order structure is weaker for Pt(A)/MgO than for PtMo6/MgO. Fig. 6(c) depicts the EXAFS oscillation for Pt/MgO prepared from PtCl2, where in our previous model lots of Pt atoms were located in the bulk of MgO [10], [20]. Fig. 6(d) shows Ni K-edge EXAFS oscillation for Ni/MgO in which Ni atoms form a solid solution with MgO [3], [19]. As the EXAFS spectra for Pt and Ni were measured at L3 and K edges, respectively, the oscillations are different by π radian with each other. Thus the Ni K-edge EXAFS oscillation in Fig. 6(d) was the oscillation multiplied by −1. The EXAFS oscillation at Ni K-edge is quite different from that at Pt L3-edge, indicating the local structure around Pt atoms is different from that around Ni atoms. We reported the local structure of Fe3+ in a Fe-doped MgO (Fe/MgO) by means of EXAFS [3]. The EXAFS oscillation at Fe K-edge in Fe/MgO is reproduced in Fig. 6(e), also taking π-radian difference into account. It is similar to those for Pt atoms in MgO. In our previous paper, we had the best fitting results for the EXAFS data based on Fe2MgO4 spinel structure, where half of Fe3+ ions are located at the Mg sites, resulting in lack of some Mg2+ ions to compenstate the charge balance. The Mg2+ defects come together to create tetrahedral sites where another half of Fe3+ ions occupy [26], [27]. It is likely from the similarity of the EXAFS oscillations of Fe3+ and Pt4+ in MgO that the local structure of Pt is spinel-like. PtMg2O4 is a candidate, which has a spinel structure with a lattice constant a = 0.8521 nm which is almost twice as large as the lattice constant of MgO (a = 0.42112 nm) [28], [29]. In PtMg2O4 all Pt4+ ions are located at octahedral sites, while Mg2+ ions are located at both octahedral and tetrahedral positions. There are Pt–O bonds at 0.205 nm and Pt (octahedral)–Mg (octahedral) bonds at 0.302 nm and Pt (octahedral)–Mg (tetrahedral) bonds at 0.353 nm. Based on this structure model we have obtained the best fit results as shown in Table 1and Fig. 7. The Pt–X bond distances are 0.203, 0.300, 0.344 nm for Pt–O, Pt–Mg (oct) and Pt–Mg (tetra), respectively. No Pt–Pt bonding was detected. The Pt–Mg (tetra) distance is shorter than 0.353 nm for PtMg2O4 probably because the local structure is largely distorted from the ideal spinel. The coordination number for Pt–Mg (oct) in Pt(A)/MgO was smaller than that in PtMo6/MgO, whereas the coordination number for Pt–Mo (tetra) in Pt(A)/MgO was almost the same as that in PtMo6/MgO as shown in Table 1.

Fig. 8 shows the Pt L3-edge EXAFS oscillations and Fourier transformations for Pt(A)/MgO before and after the propane combustion under the excess propane condition (He/O2/C3H8 = 90/2/8 (ml min−1)) at 523 K and under the excess O2 condition (He/O2/C3H8 = 90/9.8/0.2 (ml min−1)) at 673 K. The intensity of Pt–O peak decreased a little, but Pt–Mg packs were still observed in the Fourier transforms. The results of curve fitting analysis are shown in Table 2. Any Pt–Pt was not observed in the EXAFS analysis. Thus the atomically dispersed Pt structure is maintained after the catalytic reactions at 523–673 K.

To examine whether the Pt clusters interacting with the MgO surface through Pt–O bonding in the Pt(A)/MgO catalyst reduced at 623 K can be converted again to the original atomically dispersed Pt by oxidation with O2, we have measured EXAFS spectra for the Pt(A)/MgO sample reduced with propane at 623 K and then oxidized with O2 at 623 K. Fig. 9(c) and (f) show the EXAFS oscillation and Fourier transform for the obtained sample, respectively. The Pt–Pt- bonding at 0.274 nm disappeared, while the Pt–O, Pt–Mg (oct) and Pt–Mg (tetra) bonds were observed again as shown in Table 3. The similar restructuring was also observed in the local structure of Pt in PtMo6/MgO. In contrast, the Pt particles with 2.2 nm in diameter were not converted to the dispersed Pt ions by O2 treatment.
4. Discussion
4.1. Local structure of Pt in Pt(A)/MgO
It has been demonstrated in our previous report that Pt4+ substitutes Mg2+ of the toplayer of MgO lattice without a large reconstruction of the lattice [9], [10], [20]. In this study we reproduced the previous EXAFS oscillations very well. However, direct comparison between the EXAFS oscillations for Pt(A)/MgO and PtMo6/MgO and the EXAFS oscillation for Ni/MgO indicates that the local structures of Ni and Pt are different (Fig. 6). In Ni/MgO Ni2+ substitutes Mg2+ in the MgO lattice to form a solid solution by calcination of the sample at 773 K [3], [19]. Thus these results attempt us to reconsider the previous model for the local structure around Pt atoms in PtMo6/MgO and Pt(A)/MgO. It seems that the EXAFS oscillations for Pt(A)/MgO and PtMo6/MgO in Fig. 6 can not be explained by a simple substitution of Mg2+ by Pt4+, even though this substitution creates cation defects in MgO. A new model proposed here is based on the similarity in the EXAFS oscillations for Pt(A)/MgO, PtMo6/MgO, and Fe/MgO. The local structure of Fe is a Fe2MgO4-like spinel structure where Fe3+ ions occupy the octahedral and tetrahedral positions in the spinel structure [27]. A spinel structure is also known for a PtMg binary oxide PtMg2O4 [28], [29]. In the X-ray analysis, Pt ion is located at an octahedral position and Mg ions are located at octahedral and tetrahedral sites in a 1 : 1 ratio. The EXAFS analysis for the Pt catalysts based on the PtMg2O4 spinel structure revealed the best fitting results when the three contributions of Pt–O + Pt–Mg (oct) + Pt–Mg (tetra) are taken into account as shown in Table 1. However, the R factor based on the previous model (0.2%) is smaller than the present one (3%). It may indicate that the previous substitution model is more plausible. However, the fact that the EXAFS oscillations between Pt(A)/MgO or PtMo6/MgO and Fe/MgO are quite similar in a sense of peak positions (Fig. 6) can be explained by the spinel model rather than the simple substitution model. Further PtMg2O4 is a thermodynamically stable compound. However, there are problems also in the spinel model. The location of Pt4+ ions is different from Fe3+ ions. Although there should be Pt–Pt bonding at 0.302 nm in PtMg2O4 bulk, the EXAFS analysis showed no direct Pt–Pt bond in Pt(A)/MgO and PtMo6/MgO. Moreover the coordination number of Pt–Mg (oct) in Pt(A)/MgO was much smaller than that for PtMo6/MgO. Thus, we can not present the detail of three-dimensional structure for the Pt local structure at moment, but it is most likely that the local structure around a Pt4+ ion which substituted a Mg2+ ion of the toplayer of MgO lattice is distorted from a rock-salt structure to a spinel-like structure, where several Mg2+ and O2− ions around a Pt4+ ion should be involved in the restructuring at the surface layer. Anyhow it is obvious that Pt ions are atomically dispersed without Pt–Pt interaction in Pt(A)/MgO and PtMo6/MgO in their oxidized form.
4.2. Catalytic performance
The Pt(A)/MgO and PtMo6/MgO catalysts are active for the dehydrogenation reactions of light hydrocarbons at 573–773 K [9], [10]. On conventional Pt particle catalysts, the performance in the presence of oxygen leads to combustion. We first expected that the Pt/MgO and PtMo6/MgO catalysts with atomically dispersed Pt sites are feasible for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes to the corresponding alkenes suppressing the combustion. However, the combustion activity of Pt/MgO and PtMo6/MgO were unexpectedly as high as that of Pt particles supported on MgO as shown in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4. The EXAFS analysis indicated that the monomeric structure of Pt was maintained during the propane + O2 reaction under both excess oxygen and hydrocarbon conditions. No hysterisis in the two successive runs in Fig. 5 suggests no formation of the Pt clusters. Thus the monomeric Pt structure is probably regarded as the active structure for the propane combustion on the Pt(A)/MgO and PtMo6/MgO catalysts. It is to be noted that the atomically dispersed Pt ions were as active as metallic Pt particles on the MgO support. The property of the catalysts may depend on the kind of hydrocarbons. In the case of butane oxidation, the butene and butadiene formation with ca. 50% selectivity was observed in addition to the total oxidation [30].

Fig. 5. The combustion activities (CO2 yield) of Pt(A)/MgO in the two sequential reaction processes as a function of reaction temperature; solid line: first run; dotted line: second run. The CO2 yields at the steady state were recorded during the course of step-by-step increasing reaction temperature. Broken line indicates a maximum value for the propane combustion. Flow rates of O2 and C3H8 were 2 and 8 ml min−1, respectively, diluted by 90 ml min−1 He (total flow rate = 100 ml min−1), at atmospheric pressure.
The Pt–O coordination number decreased by 1 after the catalytic combustion reaction as shown in Table 2. It seems that the oxygen atom coordinated to Pt atom contributes to the combustion reaction. Vacancy on the Pt site is created through the reaction between the Pt–O lattice oxygen and propane, and works as the active site for the steady-state combustion process. Similar active vacancy was observed in CO + NO reaction on PtMo6/MgO where one oxygen atom was removed from Pt site with the reaction with CO [20]. It has also been reported that the reactivity of the lattice oxygen atoms in Pt(A)/MgO was enhanced by the presence of H2O vapor. [14] The O2-lattice oxygen exchange proceeded 10 times more rapidly in the presence of H2O vapor than without H2O vapor. The promoting effect of H2O vapor was not observed with the Pt particle catalyst. [14] Under the catalytic combustion conditions, there would be H2O vapor in the system, leading to promote the activity of the monomeric Pt site.
When the Pt(A)/MgO catalyst was reduced with propane at 623 K, Pt clusters with chemical bonding strong interaction (Pt–O) to the MgO support were formed as shown in Fig. 9 and Table 3. The Pt clusters were reversibly transformed to the highly dispersed Pt structure on MgO by the oxygen treatment at 623 K. If such a reversible structure transformation rapidly takes place and the atomically dispersed Pt structure is more favorable in the catalytic reaction conditions, we can not detect Pt clusters as a major species on the catalyst. In fact no Pt–Pt bonding was observed with the oxidized catalysts under the catalytic reaction conditions.
5. Conclusions
1.
The local structure of Pt in PtMo6/MgO and Pt(A)/MgO was reinvestigated, and a distorted spinel-like local structure around Pt atom which substituted Mg atom of the toplayer lattice of MgO was proposed by EXAFS analysis.
2.
The atomically dispersed Pt species in the catalysts was as active as metallic Pt particles for the propane combustion.
3.
Pt clusters interacting with the MgO surface through Pt–O bonds were more active than the isolated Pt species.
4.
The Pt clusters and the atomically dispersed Pt species were reversibly transformed to each other by reduction with propane or by oxidation with O2 at 623 K, whereas the Pt particles of 2.2 nm size were converted to neither Pt clusters nor Pt monomers.
5.
The characteristic feature of the PtMo6/MgO and Pt(A)/MgO may provide the potential application to other total and selective oxidation systems with unique performance, possibly assisted by coexisting or added H2O in the catalytic processes.
