Ethane Oxidative Dehydrogenation Pathways on Vanadium Oxide Catalysts
Abstract
Kinetic and isotopic tracer and exchange measurements were used to determine the identity and reversibility of elementary steps involved in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) on VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/ZrO2. C2H6−C2D6−O2 and C2H6−D2O−O2 react to form alkenes and COx without concurrent formation of C2H6-xDx or C2H4-xDx isotopomers, suggesting that C−H bond cleavage in ethane and ethene is an irreversible and kinetically relevant step in ODH and combustion reactions. Primary ethane ODH reactions show normal kinetic isotopic effects (kC-H/kC-D = 2.4); similar values were measured for ethane and ethene combustion (1.9 and 2.8, respectively). 16O2−18O2−C2H6 reactions on supported V16Ox domains led to the initial appearance of 16O from the lattice in H2O, CO, and CO2, consistent with the involvement of lattice oxygen in C−H bond activation steps. Isotopic contents are similar in H2O, CO, and CO2, suggesting that ODH and combustion reactions use similar lattice oxygen sites. No 16O18O isotopomers were detected during reactions of 16O2−18O2−C2H6 mixtures, as expected if dissociative O2 chemisorption steps were irreversible. The alkyl species formed in these steps desorb irreversibly as ethene and the resulting O−H groups recombine to form H2O and reduced V centers in reversible desorption steps. These reduced V centers reoxidize by irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2. A pseudo-steady state analysis of these elementary steps together with these reversibility assumptions led to a rate expression that accurately describes the observed inhibition of ODH rates by water and the measured kinetic dependence of ODH rates on C2H6 and O2 pressures. This kinetic analysis suggests that surface oxygen, OH groups, and oxygen vacancies are the most abundant reactive intermediates during ethane ODH on active VOx domains.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) provides an exothermic and thermodynamically favored route to ethene using ethane as the reactant. The formation of water overcomes the thermodynamic hurdles and the high temperatures involved in non-oxidative thermal or catalytic routes to ethene. Many previous studies have examined several metal oxides as catalysts 1-11 and VOx-based materials are among the most active and selective catalysts for ethane ODH. Ethane ODH reactions occur in parallel with ethane combustion and with combustion of the ethene formed in primary ODH steps (Scheme 1). These pathways lead to the observed effects of reactor residence time on reaction rate and selectivity.11 In Scheme 1, k1, k2, and k3 represent pseudo-first-order rate constants for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, ethane combustion, and ethene combustion, respectively. Several other reaction schemes and mechanisms have been proposed for ethane ODH on vanadia and other active oxides.1-9 Previous studies on VOx-SiO2 have provided the most detailed mechanistic picture for ethane reactions,6-9 but for catalysts leading to more complex reaction products, including acetone and acetaldehyde.
Previous reports have based their mechanistic conclusions on the kinetic dependence of these reactions on C2H6 and O2, without independent evidence from isotopic tracer or exchange studies for the role of lattice oxygen and for the reversibility or kinetic relevance of specific elementary steps. Such details have been recently reported for propane ODH reactions on supported VOx, MoOx, and WOx. 12-14 Both primary and secondary reactions were shown to proceed via Mars-van Krevelen 15 pathways involving lattice oxygen atoms, which are removed and restored during each catalytic turnover.
Scheme 1:  Primary and Secondary Reaction Pathways in Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane
Here, we report isotopic tracer and exchange studies of ethane dehydrogenation and combustion pathways VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/ZrO2 catalysts. A sequence of elementary steps consistent with ethane ODH kinetic data was confirmed by isotopic tracer and exchange measurements and by kinetic isotope effects obtained from relative rate constants measured for each of the three rate constants in Scheme 1 using C2H6−O2 and C2D6−O2 mixtures (knH/knD). The rate expression derived from the proposed catalytic sequence accurately describes ethane ODH rates on VOx/Al2O3, VOx/ZrO2, and unsupported V2O5 catalysts.

VOx/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of γ-alumina (Degussa, AG, 100 m2/g) with aqueous solutions of ammonium metavanadate containing also oxalic acid. The impregnated samples were dried, crushed, treated in dry air at 773 K, and sieved to retain 180−355 μm particles. Catalyst synthesis and structural characterization procedures and the results were reported previously.11 VOx/ZrO2 catalysts were prepared similarly using Zr oxyhydroxide powders as supports. 16,17 Table 1 shows surface areas and nominal vanadia surface densities for the catalysts.

The effects of reactant and product concentrations on reaction rates and rate constants were measured using a packed-bed flow reactor with plug-flow hydrodynamics. VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/ZrO2 catalysts (0.01−0.3 g, 180−355 μm) and V2O5 powders (Johnson Matthey, 99.9%, 0.49−0.78 g, <355 μm) were diluted with quartz granules (180−355 μm, 0.01−0.3 g) in order to prevent temperature gradients and to ensure plug-flow hydrodynamics. No products were detected on Al2O3, ZrO2, quartz chips, or an empty reactor at the conditions of this study. Reaction rates were measured on VOx/ZrO2 (3.9 V/nm2) at ethane pressures of 2−15 kPa and O2 pressures of 1−4 kPa. Kinetic inhibition by products was probed by adding up to 10 kPa H2O and 1 kPa COx (CO2:  Liquid Carbonic, 50.3%, balance N2; CO:  Praxair, 2%, balance He) to the feed. H2O was introduced by flowing H2 (Airgas, 99.99%) over a CuO bed (100 g, 13 wt % CuO/Al2O3) at 623 K in order to convert all the H2 to H2O. All transfer lines after H2O introduction were kept at ∼400 K. Kinetic measurements were also carried out on three VOx/Al2O3 samples with surface densities of 1.4, 8.0, and 34 V/nm2. In these measurements, the C2H6 pressure was kept at 14 kPa and O2 partial pressures were varied (1.7−6.8 kPa) in order to achieve C2H6/O2 ratios of 2−8. The C2H6 pressure was changed to 3.4 kPa and then to 6.8 kPa, while keeping the O2 pressure at 1.7 kPa. C2H6 (Scott Specialty Gases, research grade, >99.999%) and O2 (Praxair, research grade, chemical purity >99.999%) were used without further purification in all experiments. Helium (Airgas, research grade >99.9999%) was used as an inert diluent.
Typical C2H6 and O2 conversions were 1−2% and 10−20%, respectively. A Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with packed (Supelco Carboxen 1004) and capillary (HP-1, 50 m, 320 μm) columns and thermal conductivity and flame ionization detectors was used to measure reactant and product concentrations in the effluent stream. The reaction temperature was varied between 663 and 743 K and reactor residence times were adjusted by varying ethane molar flow rates between 0.017 and 0.17 mol/s g-atom V. Reaction rate data as a function of residence time were used in order to calculate initial rates for primary dehydrogenation and combustion reactions and each of the rate constants in Scheme 1.11
Isotopic studies were conducted using a gradientless recirculating batch reactor with catalyst samples (∼0.1 g) held in a shallow bed at 663 K. 18 Gradientless operation was ensured by keeping C2H6 and O2 conversions below 1% per pass. Reactants were introduced into the recirculating volume (400 cm3) after evacuation to <0.1 Pa. A graphite gear pump was used to circulate reactor contents at 1.67 cm3 s-1. The chemical and isotopic compositions of reactants and products were measured by injecting gas samples into a gas chromatograph equipped with a mass selective detector (Hewlett-Packard 5872). The ion yields were analyzed using deconvolution methods that account for natural 13C abundance and fragmentation patterns 19 in order to obtain the 13C, 2H, and 18O isotopomer distributions in each reactant or product. C2H6 (Scott Specialty Gases, research grade, >99.999%), C2D6 (Isotec, chemical purity >99%, isotopic purity >99%), 13C2H4 (Isotec, chemical purity >99.9%, isotopic purity >99%), 16O2 (Praxair, research grade, chemical purity >99.999%, isotopic purity 99.92%), 18O2 (Isotec, chemical purity >99%, isotopic purity >99%), and 2H2O (Isotec, chemical purity 100%, isotopic purity 99.9%), were used without further purification. Helium (Airgas, research grade >99.9999%) was used as an inert diluent.

Effects of Reactant and Product Concentrations on Reaction Rates. Figures 1, 2, and 3 show primary ethane ODH rates (from residence time data extrapolated to zero conversion) as a function of reactant and product concentrations on 10 wt % V2O5/ZrO2 (3.9 V/nm2). Dehydrogenation rates were nearly first-order in C2H6 (Figure 1) and almost zero order in O2 (Figure 2). The addition of water decreased primary C2H6 dehydrogenation rates (Figure 3). These inhibition effects weakened with increasing H2O concentration, as also reported previously on VOx/SiO2.10 Neither CO nor CO2 influenced primary ODH rates on VOx/ZrO2. Similar conclusions were reached on the other VOx/Al2O3 catalysts studied, indicating that ethane ODH reaction orders on VOx domains are not influenced by the support or by any changes in domain size or structure caused by changes in the support or in the VOx surface density. Detailed kinetic measurements on VOx/ZrO2 and VOx/Al2O3 were consistent with ethane orders slightly smaller than one and with small positive orders in O2 concentration. This kinetic dependence reflects some subtle mechanistic details illustrated by the elementary steps in Scheme 2; it is significantly more complex than the zero and first-order respective O2 and C2H6 dependences widely reported for alkane ODH reactions.1-4

Scheme 2:  Sequence of Elementary Steps and Derived Rate Equation for Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane on VOx Catalysts
Scheme 2 shows a set of elementary steps consistent with this kinetic dependence and with the isotopic experiments reported below. O* represents a lattice oxygen (OV, V−O−V, or V−O−M, where M is the oxide support). C2H5O* is an ethoxide species attached to a V-cation (C2H5−O−V); OH* denotes a hydroxyl group bound to V or M, and * is a reduced V center, consisting of an oxygen vacancy at a single V3+ or shared between two V4+. Step 1 represents the quasi-equilibrated weak molecular adsorption of ethane. In this Scheme, Step 2 becomes the only kinetically relevant step when O* is the most abundant reactive intermediate (mari). This step involves the activation of one of the six equivalent C−H bonds in ethane using lattice oxygens to form an adsorbed ethoxide species and a OH group. These ethoxide species then form ethene in Step 3, via the elimination of an H atom to form a second OH group. Step 4 involves the quasi-equilibrated recombination of two vicinal OH groups to form water, leaving behind an oxygen vacancy. The irreversible dissociative chemisorption of O2 (Step 5) then reoxidizes the reduced V centers to form the stoichiometric V5+ oxide domains required for a new catalytic cycle. This Mars-van Krevelen mechanism resembles those shown to account for propane ODH on VOx12 and MoOx14 catalysts.
The elementary steps shown in Scheme 2 lead to the rate equation shown in eq 6 (Scheme 2). This rate equation follows from Scheme 2 via the straightforward application of the pseudosteady-state hypothesis (PSSH) for each surface species together with the quasi-equilibrium assumption for steps 1 and 4, and the assumption of O*, OH*, and * as the most abundant reactive intermediates (mari). This equation accurately describes the experimental rate data, including the apparent deviations of the C2H6 and O2 orders from 1 and 0, respectively, as shown by the comparison between the predictions from these equations and the measured reaction rates included in Figure 4. Thus, the mechanism shown in Scheme 2 is consistent with experimental rate measurements. Ethane ODH rates per V on both 2 wt % V2O5/Al2O3 and unsupported V2O5 (squares and stars visible in the Figure 4 inset) are very low, and they lead to less accurate flow and conversion measurements and to more scatter for these rate measurements than for those on 10 wt % and 30 wt % V2O5/Al2O3 catalysts.
Figure 4 Predicted versus actual rates of ethane ODH on VOx/Al2O3 and V2O5 using the rate equation in Scheme 2; squares:  2 wt % V2O5/Al2O3 (1.4 V/nm2); diamonds:  10 wt % V2O5/Al2O3 (8.0 V/nm2); circles:  30 wt % V2O5/Al2O3 (34 V/nm2); stars:  unsupported V2O5; [3.4−14 kPa C2H6, 1.7−6.8 kPa O2, 663−743 K].
The values of the parameters used in the ethane ODH rate equation (eq 6) for 10 wt % V2O5/Al2O3 (Figure 4) are given in Table 2. The ethane adsorption equilibrium constant, K1, and the initial C−H bond activation rate constant, k‘2, appear as an effective rate constant (keff) in the numerator of eq 6. The values of keff follow the expected Arrhenius-type magnitude increase with increasing reaction temperature. Its apparent activation energy is 110 (±15) kJ/mol, in agreement with previous measurements on this catalyst.11 The three terms in the denominator of eq 6 reflect the relative contributions of O*, OH*, and * in the order in which they appear. Table 2 contains α and β, which are the collected equilibrium and rate parameters preceding the OH* and * terms, (K10.25k‘20.25K4-0.52k5-0.25 and K10.5k‘20.52k5-0.5, respectively). The values of α and β, when multiplied by typical reactant and product concentrations, are small relative to the 1 in this denominator, suggesting that the concentrations of OH* and * are small compared to that of O*. The calculated values for OH* and * are qualitatively consistent with our recent in situ measurements of the number reduced vanadia centers using UV−vis spectroscopy, which suggest that <∼5% of the vanadium atoms are reduced during steady-state alkane ODH reactions. 20 At low reaction temperatures, the value of α leads to OH* surface coverage estimates of ∼8%, which are consistent with the mild inhibition effects of water observed on ethane ODH rates (Figure 3). These inhibition effects weaken with increasing temperature because of the exothermic nature of the water adsorption step, which titrates vacancy sites (*) with OH* and decreases the number of lattice oxygen atoms (O*) available for kinetically relevant C−H bond activation steps.

Isotopic Tracer Studies and Kinetic Isotopic Effects. The kinetic significance and reversibility of the elementary steps shown in Scheme 2 and the role of lattice oxygen atoms in C−H bond activation were probed using reactants and products labeled with 2H, 13C, or 18O. Kinetic isotope effects were measured from separate reactions of C2H6−O2 and C2D6−O2 reactant mixtures (14 kPa ethane; 1.7 kPa O2) on 10 wt % V2O5/Al2O3. Several of these experiments were repeated on 10 wt % V2O5/ZrO2, with similar conclusions.
Figure 5 shows ethene formation rates from C2H6−O2 and C2D6−O2 mixtures at 663 K as a function of reactor residence time. The primary C2H6 dehydrogenation rate constant (k1H) obtained from these data is 2.4 times larger than the rate constant for C2D6 dehydrogenation (k1D). This normal kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is consistent with kinetically relevant C−H bond activation steps (Step 2 in Scheme 2), as assumed in most previous studies.1-5,8,12 The KIE for each of the reactions in Scheme 1 is discussed in greater detail below. At <3% ethane conversion, the rates of ethene formation presented in Figure 5 decreased with increasing contact time to an extent much greater than expected from the slight depletion of the ethane reactants. This decrease in the net rate of ethene formation reflects the combustion (via Reaction 3 in Scheme 1) of some of the ethene formed in primary ODH steps, as well as a weak inhibition of ethane ODH rates by the water formed in ODH and combustion steps (Figure 3).
Figure 5 Ethene formation rate as a function of time during ethane ODH with C2H6 and with C2D6 reactants on 10 wt % V2O5/Al2O3 (8.0 V/nm2) [14 kPa C2H6 or C2D6, 1.7 kPa O2, 663 K].
A C2H6−C2D6−O2 (6.8−6.8−1.7 kPa) mixture was used in order to examine the reversibility of C−H bond activation steps (Step 2). C2H6-xDx isotopomers would be expected to form if this step were reversible. Figure 6a shows that equimolar C2H6− C2D6 reactant mixtures did not lead to detectable amounts of mixed C2H6-xDx isotopomers, consistent with irreversible C−H bond activation steps. Mathematical instabilities in the matrix inversion procedures used to calculate isotopomer distributions and weak secondary kinetic isotope effects in mass fragmentation patterns lead to the observed scatter in isotopomer concentrations (around zero) and to slightly negative values for some of the mixed isotopomers. No mixed isotopomers of ethene (C2H4-xDx) were detected (Figure 6b), indicating that hydrogen abstraction steps in ethoxide groups (to form ethene) are also irreversible and that the reversible readsorption of ethene on OH*, via the microscopic reverse of ethene formation from ethoxide species, is slow relative to ethane ODH turnovers. It appears that the readsorption of ethene on O* sites and the concomitant C−H bond activation required for secondary ethene reactions to form COx are also irreversible and that the cleavage of the first C−H bond in ethene leads to rapid cascade reactions leading to the ultimate desorption of CO and CO2. The amount of C2H4 formed is larger than that of C2D4 for equimolar C2H6−C2D6 reactant mixtures because normal kinetic isotope effects favor ODH reactions of C2H6 over those of C2D6 (by a factor of 2.4).

A C2H6−O2−D2O (13.5−1.7−0.5 kPa) reactant mixture was used in order to confirm the irreversibility of Steps 2 and 3 and to determine the extent to which OH* recombination steps leading to H2O desorption (Step 4) are reversible. Neither C2H6-xDx nor C2H4-xDx were detected (Figure 7a and 7b), consistent with irreversible C−H bond activation steps in both ethane and ethene molecules. A binomial distribution of H2O, HDO, and D2O isotopomers indicates that quasi-equilibrium between OH* and H2O(g) is achieved during ethane ODH reactions. Previous studies using C3H8−O2−D2O mixtures have also concluded that water desorption steps are reversible,12 but rapid isotopic exchange unrelated to propane dehydrogenation steps prevented a definite assessment of the extent of reversibility. OH recombination steps must be reversible for H2O to be able to inhibit ODH rates, as observed for propane12-14 and ethane (Figure 3) reactions. Irreversible H2O desorption steps would prevent gas-phase H2O molecules from influencing the surface concentration of any adsorbed intermediates or the rate of any surface reactions.
Figure 8a shows the 18O isotopic content in the water formed from C2H6−18O2−16O2 reactant mixtures on a VOx/Al2O3 (10 wt % V2O5, 8.0 V/nm2) sample containing only 16O. The initial H2O products formed contained predominately 16O from the VOx lattice and only trace amounts of 18O from the 18O2−16O2 equimolar reactant mixture. This suggests that lattice oxygen is involved in the activation of C−H bonds in ethane and in the primary formation of water via Step 4 (in Scheme 2). As catalytic turnovers occur, lattice 16O is gradually removed as H216O and replaced with equimolar amounts of 18O and 16O from O2 via the filling of vacancies in Step 5 (Scheme 2). As a result, the H216O/H218O ratio increases with reaction time and approaches the value of unity expected from the equimolar amounts of 18O and 16O atoms in the reactant stream (Figure 8a). These conclusions, however, are not unequivocal, because the reversibility of water formation steps (Step 4) can lead to rapid isotopic exchange of any H2O formed with the pool of lattice 16O pool via the reverse of Step 4.

The time evolution of the 18O/16O content of all combustion products from the reaction of ethane and a mixture of 16O2−18O2 on 10 wt % V216O5/Al216O3 [14 kPa C2H6, 0.85 kPa 16O2, 0.85 kPa 18O2, 663 K, recirculating batch reactor].
No 18O16O isotopomers were detected in the reactor effluent at any conversion or contact time (Figure 8a) during reactions of C2H6−18O2−16O2 reactant mixtures. Reversible O2 dissociation steps (Step 5) would lead to mixed dioxygen isotopomers, as the recombination of lattice oxygen species occurs more rapidly than ODH turnovers. Thus, as also shown for propane ODH reactions on VOx12,13 and MoOx,13 O2 dissociation steps are irreversible during ethane ODH on VOx-based catalysts.
Figure 8b shows the 18O/16O isotopic ratio in the H2O, CO, and CO2 formed from the C2H6−18O2−16O2 reactant mixture. CO and CO2 also contain only 16O during the initial stages of the reaction, confirming that lattice oxygen is also involved in primary and secondary combustion reactions. The distribution of 18O in the CO2 is binomial, indicating that statistical sampling of lattice oxygen atoms occurs during CO2 formation. The 18O contents in H2O, CO, and CO2 are similar and increase concurrently with increasing reaction time as the lattice reaches equilibrium with the equimolar 16O2−18O2 reactant mixture and ultimately provides lattice 18O and 16O atoms with equal probability for both primary and secondary products. ODH and combustion reactions appear to sample the same lattice oxygen pool, suggesting that similar sites are involved in ODH and combustion reactions.
A reactant mixture consisting of C2H6 (14 kPa), 13C2H4 (0.5 kPa), and O2 (1.7 kPa) was used in order to measure the relative rates of primary and secondary reactions and the reversibility of the overall ethane dehydrogenation reaction at 663 K on VOx/Al2O3 (10 wt %, 8.0 V/nm2). These competitive reactions of C2H6 and 13C2H4 showed that CO and CO2 form via direct ethane combustion and secondary ethene combustion reactions. The CO and CO2 formed from C2H6−13C2H4−O2 mixtures showed similar 13C contents at all contact times (Figure 9), suggesting that CO and CO2 form from both C2H6 and 13C2H4. The initial concentration of 12C2H6 is 27 times greater than that of 13C2H4, but the initial 13C fraction in COx combustion products, which form from essentially unscrambled reactants, is 0.47, indicating that rate constants of C2H4 combustion (k3 in Scheme 1) are significantly larger than for C2H6 combustion (k2 in Scheme 1) (k3/k2 = 14). The 13C content in COx decreases with increasing contact time because unlabeled ethene formed from 12C2H6 dilutes the isotopically pure 13C2H4 reactants initially present. A kinetic analysis of these data shows that k3 is 5.8 times greater than the rate constant of ethene formation (k1 in Scheme 1). The k2/k1 ratio is 0.36, indicating a primary C2H4 selectivity of 74%. Both ratios agree with values of these rate constants obtained from the effects of reactor residence time on reaction rate and product selectivity in a flow reactor.11 The value of k3/k2 obtained from the latter measurements was 16 (11), in excellent agreement with the value of 14 reported here from isotopic tracer studies. Figure 9 shows that no 13C is detected in ethane even at ethane conversions of 4.4%, confirming the irreversible nature of C−H bond activation steps, also shown from C2H6−C2D6−O2 (Figure 6) and C2H6−O2−D2O (Figure 7) experiments.

H−D Kinetic Isotope Effects for Primary and Secondary Reactions. Kinetic isotope effects (KIE) measured from reactions of C2H6−O2 and C2D6−O2 mixtures are shown in Table 3 for each reaction step in Scheme 1. Primary dehydrogenation (k1), primary combustion (k2), and secondary combustion (k3) rate constants were extracted from these rate data as a function of reaction time on 10 wt % V2O5/Al2O3 at 663 K. As noted earlier (Figure 5), the kinetic isotope effect for ethane conversion to ethene (k1H/k1D) is 2.4, as expected for kinetically relevant steps involving C−H bond cleavage. The corresponding kinetic isotope effects are 1.9 for ethane combustion to CO and CO2 (k2H/k2D) and 2.8 for ethene combustion (k3D/k3H). These normal KIE are similar for all three steps, suggesting that C−H bond activation is a common requirement and a kinetically relevant step for all three reactions. These conclusions are reasonable in view of the similar site requirements exhibited by these primary and secondary pathways.1-4,11

The KIE values reported here for ethane and ethene reactions resemble those reported recently for propane and propene reactions on VOx/ZrO2.12,14 For propane and propene reactions, KIE values were 2.5−2.8 for k1H/k1D, 1.7−1.9 for k2H/k2D, and 2.2−2.6 for k3D/k3H, all of which resemble the values reported here for C2 reactions.
The different KIE values measured for alkane ODH, alkane combustion, and alkene combustion (for both C2 and C3) reflect the different extent to which the C−H bond is cleaved and the O−H and O−C bonds are formed in the transition state required for the C−H activation steps involved in each reaction. In the absence of concerted formation of O−H and O−C bonds using lattice oxygen atoms, KIE values would approach ∼6 for ethane at 663 K.14 KIE values decrease when concerted formation of O−H or O−D bonds compensates in part for the higher bond energy of C−D bonds relative to C−H bonds. It appears that the involvement of lattice oxygen in the formation of transition states for alkane combustion is more extensive than for alkane ODH or alkene combustion, suggesting the involvement of specific lattice oxygen atoms with a somewhat higher affinity and reactivity for the formation of O−H bonds during C−H bond activation.
Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane on VOx/Al2O3 and VOx/ZrO2 occurs via parallel and sequential reactions, with ethene as the most abundant primary product. The assumption that surface oxygen, OH groups, and vacancies are the most abundant reactive intermediates leads to a rate equation that accurately describes measured ethane ODH reaction rates. The dependencies of these rates on C2H6, O2, and H2O concentrations are identical on supported VOx and V2O5 powders, suggesting that similar active centers are present on both surfaces. C2H6−C2D6 and C2H6−D2O reactants undergo ODH reactions without forming C2H6-xDx or C2H4-xDx mixed isotopomers, suggesting that C−H bond activation steps are irreversible. The absence of C2H4-xDx mixed isotopomers suggests that activation of ethene C−H bonds leads only to combustion products. The normal kinetic isotopic effects measured for primary oxidative dehydrogenation reactions and for ethane and ethene combustion steps support the kinetic relevance of C−H bond activation. Competitive reactions of 16O2−18O2−C2H6 mixtures on supported V16Ox lead to the preferential initial appearance of lattice 16O atoms in the product water, as expected if lattice oxygens were required for the activation of C−H bonds, but this conclusion is not unequivocal because water formation steps are reversible and can lead to isotopic scrambling between water and lattice oxygens. The labeled oxygen content is identical for H2O, CO, and CO2, suggesting that the same lattice oxygen pool and active sites are involved in the kinetically relevant C−H activation steps involved in ODH and combustion reactions.

    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
