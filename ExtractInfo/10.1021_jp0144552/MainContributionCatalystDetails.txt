 Unfortunately, the provided documents do not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. All the documents focus on oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, rather than propane. Since there is no pertinent information provided, I will indicate this in the XML output:

The documents do not discuss propane dehydrogenation, so I cannot provide any details about catalysts, performance enhancements, or other scientific contributions related to propane dehydrogenation. The lack of relevance has been indicated. Please let me know if you would like me to attempt summarizing any other documents that may contain relevant information.
