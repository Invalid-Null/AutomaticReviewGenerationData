Low-temperature catalytic alkylation of benzene by propane
Abstract
Interaction of benzene with propane (C6H6:C3H8=1:9) was studied at 453–623 K in the presence of acidic HY-zeolite Pt, Re/Al2O3 bimetal alumina catalysts (APRC), and mixed (50% APRC+50%HY) catalyst (mixed catalyst, MC) systems with Pt and Re content 0.3 and 0.5%, respectively. Unlike inactive separate components, MC activates benzene dehydroalkylation (DHA) by propane even at 453 K to form isopropylbenzene (IPB) and hydrogen. Increased temperatures lead to the formation of additional products, such as propene (at 523 K) and other alkylbenzenes (at 573 K). Activation of benzene–propane mixture is characterized by an induction period prior to the formation of conversion products. MC treatment by ammonia at 423 K leads to increase of selectivity of IPB formation.
The mechanism of low-temperature DHA of benzene over MC has been proposed.
1. Introduction
Use of C1–C3 alkanes in one-step synthetic processes is a problem of high industrial importance. One of the possible solutions is alkylation of benzene with C2H6, C3H8, and C4H10 on metal-containing zeolite catalysts, such as MI-HZSM-5 and MI, MIIOx-HZSM-5 (where MI=Pt, Zn, Ga; MIIOx=CeO2), at 573–873 K and atmospheric pressure [1], [2], [3], [4], [5].
We have previously studied dehydrocyclohexamerization of methane to form benzene on unreduced catalysts MI, MIIOx-Al2O3 (where MI=Ni, Pt, Co; MII=Re, Cu and Ni) at 897–997 K, atmospheric pressure and GHSV 1450 h−1 [6], [7], [8], [9], and proposed the mechanism of methane activation on these catalysts. The established principles of methane activation can also be applied to activation of other low-molecular weight alkanes, such as propane. This proposition can be supported by the fact that some later studied methane aromatization catalysts, such as TMIOx-HZSM-5 (TMI=Mo or K, Mo, Fe, V, W and Cr) [10], [11], [12], [13], are close in their functional properties to the catalysts used in [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. At the same time, characteristics of benzene (and other aromatic hydrocarbons) formation on these catalysts are similar to those obtained by us [6], [7], [8], [9]. Taking into consideration that formation of an intermediate fragment with carbocation properties is possible on metallic centers [9], it would be of interest to utilize such a fragment as an alkylating agent.
At the same time, it is well known that alkylation processes involve participation of acidic sites [14]. Therefore, it should be possible to create an optimal catalyst for a required hydrocarbon transformation by combination of the necessary properties of metallic centers and support acidity spectrum. However, the process of combination of acidic support properties and the state of supported metals depend on conditions of catalyst synthesis. It is often difficult to fix the metal at the necessary state and at the same time keep the required distribution of the acidic centers. Therefore, when studying catalytic reactions it is sometimes convenient to use a catalyst model made of a mixture containing individual components performing separately metallic or acidic functions.
The present paper presents the results of study of propane and benzene interaction on physical mixture of bimetal-containing alumina catalyst with H-form of Y-zeolite.
2. Experimental
The investigations were carried out on platinum-rhenium-alumina catalyst (PRAC) prepared by the method described in [6], [7], [8], [9], H-form of Y-zeolite, and on mixed catalyst (MC).
Spherical γ-Al2O3 precalcined in air at 1023 K for 5 h was used for PRAC synthesis. The catalyst was prepared by adsorptive impregnation of H2PtCl6 and NH4ReO4 from aqueous solutions. The sample was filtered and dried at 353 and 393 K, and then calcined at 1023 K for 3 h. Platinum and rhenium content in the catalyst prepared that way were 0.3 and 0.5 wt.%, respectively.
The Y-zeolite H-form has been prepared from the initial Na-form of the commercial Y-zeolite. The fully exchanged HY was obtained by ionic exchange of the initial zeolite with aqueous ammonium chloride at 353 K for 6 h, followed by drying at 363 K for 12 h and calcination at 823 K for 5 h. The zeolite obtained was shaped with the alumogel binder (20 wt.% Al2O3).
The initial reagents propane and benzene were of >99% purity (GC).
The conversion of propane, benzene, and propane–benzene mixture (1:9 molar ratio) was studied in a flow reactor at 423–873 K, atmospheric pressure, and GHSV 500 h−1.
The catalysts were treated with air at 673 K for 1 h before the experiments.
The state of supported metals was characterized by diffuse reflection IR spectroscopy described in [15]. Diffuse reflection IR spectra of adsorbed CO, used as the test molecule, were recorded in 1700–2300 cm−1 region at room temperature using “Perkin-Elmer 580 B” spectrophotometer. Pre-reduction of samples with hydrogen was carried out “in situ” in IR-cell at 295–823 K for 1 h under steady-state conditions (PH2=7×103 Pa). The samples were then evacuated for 1 h at reduction temperatures.
The role of acidic centers in the reaction was studied by selective poisoning of catalyst with ammonia. To do this, the catalyst was treated with ammonia (NH3:He=1:9) at 423 K for 1 h. Thermodesorption of the ammonia presorbed by the sample was carried out in He flow, and the amount was measured chromatographically.
3. Results
3.1. Catalytic activity
The propane conversion on PRAC proceeds at temperatures above 673 K. Propane dehydrogenation is the main reaction at temperatures up to 873 K. The further temperature increase leads to the formation of propane dehydrocyclooligomerization products and decomposition of propane.
Under the same conditions no conversion of propane or mixture of benzene with propane has been observed on zeolite catalyst.
The propane conversion on MC even at 573 K leads to detection of C2H4 and C4H8, as well as hydrogen, in the contact gas. As is seen from Table 1, temperature increase from 573 to 673 K leads to slight increase of catalyst activity, and does not influence the selectivity of propane conversion.

The results of study of C6H6:C3H8 mixture (1:9 molar ratio) conversion on MC are shown in Table 2. In contrast to metallic APRC and acidic HY components, MC exhibits activity at temperatures as low as 473 K. The major products of the C6H6:C3H8 mixture conversion are isopropylbenzene (IPB) and hydrogen. Thus, MC promotes alkylation of benzene with propane.

Comparing product yields and MC compositions one can see that: (i) increase of APRC component content in MC from 25 to 50% leads to sharp increase of its activity. IPB yield increases 2.4 times; (ii) further increase of the APRC content in MC to 75% exerts slight influence on its activity; (iii) the HY component content in MC over 50% leads to IPB yield decrease. Taking into account the fact that basic characteristics of C6H6:C3H8 mixture conversion depend insignificantly on MC composition, herein are presented the results of studies performed only on MC containing 50 wt.% APRC and 50 wt.% HY.
Data on temperature dependance of C6H6:C3H8 mixture conversion over MC are shown in Table 3. It should be noted that introduction of 10 mol% of benzene into the reaction leads to sharp changes in propane conversion.

Thus, formation of considerable amount of propylene is observed at 573–593 K. At the same time, formation of aromatic hydrocarbons is detected. Temperature decrease from 593 to 453 K leads to the decrease of propane conversion. However, formation of hydrogen and IPB is still observed even at 453 K, IPB being the only hydrocarbon product of conversion of C6H6:C3H8 mixture at 453–473 K.
3.2. Effect of catalyst pretreatment
The activity of MC in C6H6:C3H8 mixture conversion depends on catalyst pretreatment. Fig. 1 shows a typical curve of IPB yield dependence on experiment time using air pretreated MC. These data demonstrate that activation period is characteristic for C6H6:C3H8 mixture conversion on air pretreated MC. No IPB formation or benzene conversion was detected during the first 5 min on stream, and the major products were CO2 and H2O. After 5–7 min reaction time, benzene conversion and IPB yield started increasing, while CO2 and H2O formation decreased continuously as the reaction proceeded.

It should be noted that all experiments using propane and PRAC showed CO2 and H2O formation within the time period corresponding to the catalyst activation, followed by the decline in the yields of formation of these products practically to zero within 15–20 min. Moreover, pretreatment of MC by propane leads to the disappearance of the activation period at subsequent C6H6:C3H8 mixture conversion. Thus, catalytically inactive materials can be made active by pretreating MC with propane. This observation suggests that propane treatment is necessary to reduce the metallic component of MC to catalytically active state. Use of CO for the same purpose at the reaction temperature did not give positive results. It is possible that in this case the PRA component of MC was reduced more than necessary, since catalyst activity could be completely restored after treatment with air for a few minutes.
Additional information on the role of HY and APRC components in benzene–propane mixture conversion is obtained by treatment of MC with ammonia and hydrogen. The effect of ammonia on MC activity was studied both by catalyst pretreatment and by continuous addition into the reaction mixture. As one can see from the data presented in Table 4, IPB is formed at temperatures 473 K and higher. Moreover, IPB is the only aromatic hydrocarbon at 473–573 K. It should be noted that if the catalyst is treated with an inert gas (N2 or He) at, for example, 523 K and then used further for the experiment at 453 K, selective formation of IPB could still be observed. Therefore, partial deactivation of the catalyst by ammonia is of reversible nature.

The observed dependence is also reproduced at continuous feed of ammonia to the reaction zone. However, under these conditions the catalyst activity is approximately two times lower compared to the data shown in Table 4, and propylene formation is observed only at 623 K. This is confirmed by the results of the presorbed ammonia thermodesorption of MC presented in Table 5.

Sharp decrease of MC activity can also be caused by prereduction of sample in hydrogen flow at experiment temperatures. In this case complete deactivation of the catalyst is observed that is caused by the change of the state of metallic centers.
3.3. Examination of PRAC
Preliminary study of rhenium state of 0.5 wt.% Re-Al2O3 sample by IR spectroscopy showed that only after the treatment of the sample by hydrogen at 823 K, the absorbance bands at 1960 and 2060 cm−1 appeared, which correspond to partially reduced rhenium [16].
Similar studies of platinum state on alumina surface were carried out on 0.5 wt.% Pt-Al2O3. Results of these studies are shown in Table 6. Absorbance bands can be seen in 2000–2100 cm−1 spectral region, differing both in appearance conditions and the spectroscopic behavior of adsorbed CO. These bands may be attributed to CO linearly bound with metallic platinum. Therefore, one can assume that three different types of metallic platinum form on the surface of alumina depending on the temperature of reduction.

The reduction of rhenium oxide in the sample of 0.5 wt.% of Pt, 0.5 wt.% Re-Al2O3 at 373 K leads to the appearance of the above-mentioned absorbance bands. Thus, platinum significantly facilitates reduction of rhenium. Such decrease of the reduction temperature of supported rhenium oxide due to platinum could have been caused by the spillover effect [17]. At the same time, there are no absorbance bands corresponding to any form of platinum on PRAC. Considering that platinum is readily reduced to the metallic state [18] under the experiment conditions, one can propose that it effectively coordinates with partially reduced form of rhenium oxide. This is confirmed by studies of a sample that was preliminarily treated with CO and H2. It was found that it is only after hydrogen treatment that absorbance band at 2105 cm−1 corresponding to CO coordinated with metallic platinum (see Table 6) can be seen in IR spectra.
Taking into account that: (i) supported rhenium and platinum oxides are not active separately in the studied reaction; (ii) the catalyst is irreversibly deactivated after its pretreatment by H2; (iii) the catalyst is reversibly deactivated after its pretreatment by CO and regenerated easily by air, one can propose that species of the type
containing bridged oxygen form in this case.
Analysis of the results shows that partially reduced rhenium can be oxidized by hydroxyl groups, similarly to what is shown in [19]. This oxidation is the reason for absence of absorbance bands of CO coordinated by rhenium at its repeated adsorption on PRAC.
4. Discussion
The results of the studies of propane activation on different catalysts showed that propane dehydrogenation and other transformations of propane take place only on PRAC at temperatures above 673 K. The contact of propane with the mechanical mixture of PRAC and zeolite HY (MC) at temperatures 573–673 K leads to the formation of the small amounts of C2H4, C4H8 and hydrogen (Table 1). Such hydrocarbon products correspond to propylene metathesis products, while the presence of hydrogen indicates propane dehydrogenation on MC as an intermediate process even at 573 K.
Introduction of benzene into the reaction increases the dehydrogenating function of the catalyst, but completely suppresses the formation of propylene metathesis products. As one can see from Table 3, considerable amount of propylene formation is observed at 573–593 K. At the same time, aromatic hydrocarbons, mainly IPB, can be found among the reaction products. Decrease of the temperature to 523 K and below leads to IPB becoming the only hydrocarbon product of the conversion of C6H6:C3H8 mixture (Table 2, Table 3). Hence, IPB and hydrogen are the initial products of C6H6:C3H8 mixture conversion. Thus, use of MC allows for a one-step reaction of propane dehydrogenation and benzene alkylation, which may also be referred to as dehydroalkylation (DHA) reaction. Such a transformation is unusual at low-temperatures (
⪡
).
The yield of IPB depends significantly on component ratios of MC, reaction conditions (Fig. 1), and catalyst pretreatment. For example, catalyst treatment with hydrogen at experiment temperatures leads to its deactivation. Pretreatment by ammonia at temperatures below 453 K (Table 4) also deactivates the catalyst.
Unlike the treatment with hydrogen, deactivation with ammonia is reversible. MC does show activity and high selectivity in DHA of benzene with propane after increasing the temperature to 523 K. IPB is the only aromatic hydrocarbon formed on ammonia-treated MC at the studied temperatures. Propylene formation occurs at higher temperatures than in the case of MC not treated with NH3.
According to the data in Table 5, poisoning of MC acidic sites has a reversible nature. Treatment of the catalyst in He or N2 flow at elevated temperatures favors the restoration of the initial properties of the sample. Comparison of the data in Table 3, Table 4 shows that IPB formation rate depends on the amount of ammonia blocking acidic sites of the zeolite. Hence, benzene conversion rate depends on the total concentration of acidic sites. Yields of the products of conversion of C6H6:C3H8 mixture depends on distribution of these sites by their acidic strength.
5. Mechanism of IPB formation on MC
Benzene alkylation by alkanes was studied both on Pt-modified zeolite-containing catalysts and on MCs consisting of individual components of these catalysts [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. While in [1], [2], [3] alkylation was carried out at 823–923 K, in [4], [5] alkylation was observed even at 623 K. Unlike the cases described in [4], [5], DHA studied in present research proceeds at still lower temperatures corresponding to usual benzene alkylation by propylene. This points to the difference between mechanisms of reactions on MC and catalyst studied in [5]. In addition, DHA differs from the usual alkylation of benzene on acidic catalysts, the difference being the absence of formation of benzene polyalkylation products [14].
The data obtained show that IPB formation takes place with participation of metallic and acidic centers. However, in mechanical mixtures of catalysts those centers are considerably removed from each other as they are located on different particles of the support, i.e. they are space-divided centers. Therefore, formation of mobile intermediates capable to overcome the distance between these centers is necessary for DHA.
Comparison of the data in Table 1, Table 3 allows to assume that significant activation of propane after introduction of benzene into the reaction may be caused by the formation of aromatic intermediates. Such an intermediate may be an aromatic carbocation. Its formation possibly takes place with participation of Brönsted acidic sites of the zeolite:
(1)
It was proposed [5] that propane activation over acidic sites with the C3H carbocation formation precedes benzene alkylation. This can possibly explain the formation of disproportionation products (Table 1). However, considering complete absence of these products in the presence of benzene the conclusion may be drawn that the propane activation is possible only on metallic centers. Both the absence of propane interaction with HY at all studied temperatures and propane dehydrogenation on PRAC at temperatures above 673 K, as well as the formation of propane conversion products on MC at 573 K, support this conclusion. It is also confirmed by the IR spectroscopy data mentioned above as well as the data on oxygen removal from PRAC during its contact with hydrocarbon [7], [8]. These data explain the catalyst induction period shown in Fig. 1.
Initial interaction of propane with metallic sites may be presented as a scheme similar to that described for methane catalytic activation [7], [8], [9]:
(2)
Further, due to the protons transfer by benzene from acidic to metallic sites with dissociatively sorbed propane, the reduction of the latter sites occurs resulting in the formation of water and transfer of positive charge to the propyl group to form isopropyl carbocations. The formed carbocations perform rapid electrophilic interaction with benzene molecules:
(3)
The subsequent IPB formation and catalyst regeneration most likely proceed as follows. [C3H7⊕·C6H6], being stable enough carbocation, desorbs and interacts with
sites regenerating Brönsted acidic centers:
(4)
or interacts with benzene molecules.
(4′)
As the temperature increases, there is a growing probability for a second direction of [C3H7⊕·C6H6] σ-complex conversion leading to the formation of C3H6 and benzene.
The inactivated center [Pt·2Re=Ox] is regenerated (oxidized) by H2O molecules formed as shown in Eq. (3), or hydroxyl groups of the support, resulting in hydrogen evolution:
(5)
This conclusion is supported by the IR data described above.
The realization of reactions (2)–(4) explains the high selectivity of monoalkylated benzene formation in the presence of apparent excess of alkylating component of reaction.
Schemes (1), (3) and (5) explain the observed dependence of IPB formation on the experiment duration (Fig. 1). During the reaction some of the formed water molecules leave reaction zone together with the effluent. According to [7], [8] this process occurs more intensively at the beginning of the reaction. As a result, surface concentrations of
and reduced metallic sites responsible for MC activity change.
The benzene DHA by propane studied both by us at relatively low-temperatures and in [4], [5] at higher temperatures, is a thermodynamically hindered process. The stages of benzene DHA by propane described in schemes (2)–(4) may not be attributed to the hindered processes. At the same time reactions (1)–(4) include a closed cycle of proton transfer from zeolite component to metallic one and back assisted by the reaction intermediate. Obviously, the proton transfer in reaction (1) is the hindered one and proceeds due to reaction (3) of non-closed nature and accompanied by formation of water molecules. It is known that such reactions between two substances can be induced by the reaction with the third substance in the system [20], [21]. It can be naturally assumed that metal-containing component of MC responsible for alternating red ox processes described in schemes (2) and (5), plays a role of an inductor in DHA. Thus, the used catalytic system combines the properties of catalyst and reagent. Based on these considerations one can refer to the studied catalytic process of benzene DHA by propane as an “induced catalysis”.
It should be noted that, together with the requirements for the synthesis of the metallic component of MC [7], [8], [9], the results of these studies may lay a foundation for obtaining efficient catalysts for one of the most important commercial processes—production of alkylaromatic hydrocarbons using inexpensive lower alkanes.
6. Conclusion
(i)
It was found that the presence of benzene causes relatively low-temperature (above 453 K) activation of propane on the mixture of catalysts consisting of Pt, Re/Al2O3 and zeolite HY. After the initial catalyst activation, formation of isopropyl benzene, hydrogen and propylene is observed.
(ii)
Catalyst activation is related to partial reduction of Pt, ReOx component of MC with propane.
(iii)
Benzene conversion depends on the overall acidity of the zeolite component, while yields of the products depend on distribution of acidic centers by their strength.
(iv)
Possible mechanism of the low-temperature propane activation in benzene DHA on MC is proposed.
