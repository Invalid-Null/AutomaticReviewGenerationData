Effect of cobalt complex precursors on reactivity of cationic cobalt catalysts: Cyclohexane dehydrogenation




1. Introduction
Dehydrogenation of alkane is a key process for the production of olefin feedstock for valuable industrial chemicals. The reaction is generally undertaken at relatively high temperature; hence, the thermal CC cracking additionally yields various uncontrollable products and coke deposits. Accordingly, a selective catalytic dehydrogenation is more favorable. Early generation of the dehydrogenation catalysts are investigated by Taylor et al. [1], in 1941 including CeO2, V2O5, and ThO2. These catalysts required temperature of at least 500 °C with relatively low conversion and selectivity. Later a new class of Noble metals - Pd, Pt, Mo - on various supports, such as, SiO2, Al2O3, and carbon had been introduced [[2], [3], [4]]. These catalysts worked with the good yield (30–100%) at lower temperature (250–400 °C). Over these noble metals, the dehydrogenation competes with the cracking/hydrogenolysis at high conversion, giving low value methane and other light hydrocarbons [4]. While crucial drawback for more economical metal catalysts, such as Ni and Co, is the formation of coke deposit that severely deactivates the catalysts [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. This is because the bulk metal and metal oxide can readily promote coupling of adjacent alkylidene species on the surface, leading to formation of high molecular weight hydrocarbon species, i.e. the coke precursors.
With respect to this view, recent studies show that highly dispersed cationic metal oxide, such as, cobalt [10,11], zinc [12], and iron [13] is highly reactive and selective to CH activation with relatively higher stability, as compared to the metal catalysts. Among these, the highly dispersed cationic cobalt species shows high activity, and can be easily prepared by strong electrostatic adsorption of cobalt complex on silica support [10]. After calcination, the active cationic metal oxide could exist in various coordination on the silica surface, such as highly dispersed cationic clusters, polymeric and monomeric (i.e. single-site) species [[14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]]. These would depend on concentration and types of surface silanols and, in particular, types of cobalt complexes used as precursors. The difference in charge density and steric constrain (from the ligand) of the complex would result in different hydrophilic-hydrophobic natures and different adsorption sites. This hence clearly affects the cobalt loading, dispersion and also the final active Co species after calcination. Such variation would also modify the oxidation state of the cationic metal center, their Lewis character and hence reactivity.
We, therefore, reason to study the effect of cobalt precursors towards reactivity of the cationic cobalt species formed on silica support for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane, a model compound. A highly dispersed cationic cobalt catalyst can be obtained by strong electrostatic adsorption of various cobalt complexes. In addition to the higher olefin selectivity, an improved stability, as compared to typical metal catalysts is expected. Effect of reaction temperature, pretreatment procedure and the presence of hydrogen were investigated.
2. Experimental methods
Hexaamminecobalt(III) chloride ([Co(NH3)6]Cl3), pentaamminechlorocobalt(III) chloride ([Co(NH3)5Cl]Cl2), trans-dichloro-bis-(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III) chloride ([Co(en)2Cl2]Cl), tris-(bipyridine)cobalt(II) nitrate ([Co(bipy)3](NO3)2) were prepared according to procedures described in literature [23,24]. Silica was purchased from CARLO ERBA (99.00%, BET surface area ~300 m2/g) and was calcined in a muffle oven at 600 °C for 1 h with the heating rate of 5 °C/min prior use. Cationic Co/SiO2 were prepared by strong electrostatic adsorption method (SEA). 10 g of silica were primarily suspended in ~100 mL of deionized water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 11 using concentrated ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH). In a separate flask, calculated amount of each cobalt complex composing of 10 mmol of cobalt was dissolved in 25.00 mL of deionized water. The pH of the solution was then adjusted to 11. The cobalt complex solution was added to the silica suspension, stirred for 10 min at room temperature and allowed to settle for 5 min. The resulting solid was vacuum-filtered, rinsed several times with deionized water, and left at room temperature for 8 h, followed by drying in the air at 125 °C for 8 h. After that, the catalysts were calcined in muffle furnace at 600 °C for 1 h with the heating rate of 5 °C/min. The catalysts, prepared using [Co(NH3)6]Cl3, [Co(NH3)5Cl]Cl2, [Co(en)2Cl2]Cl and [Co(bipy)3](NO3)2 as precursors, are referred to in this work as N6, N5Cl, EN2Cl2, and BP3, respectively. For 5%wt Co/SiO2, 10 g of the calcined SiO2 was impregnated by cobalt solution prepared by dissolving ~2.6 g of cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2.6H2O) in 20 mL deionized water. The solid was then dried in an oven at 125 °C for 8 h, and calcined in a muffle furnace at 600 °C for 1 h with the heating rate 5 °C/min. This catalyst is designated as IM for further discussion.
Co loading on the catalysts was determined by ICP-MS (Thermo Scientific iCAP Qc ICP-MS). The reducibility of the catalysts was measured by temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) using thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) was also conducted using the same apparatus. Co K-edge (7709.0 eV) X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS) were collected in the transmission mode on self-supporting sample wafers using gas-filled ionization chambers as detectors at Synchrotron Light Research Institute (SLRI) using a Ge (220) double crystal monochromator. For X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), Co foil, CoO and [Co(NH3)6]Cl3 were used as references for metallic Co, Co2+ and Co3+, respectively.
A steady state conversion of cyclohexane was investigated at atmospheric pressure in a continuous fixed-bed micro-reactor made with glass tube (8.0 mm O.D.). The flow rate of a carrier gas was controlled by the mass flow controller and checked by bubble flow meter. Before testing, the catalyst was activated by heating at 5 °C/min to 600 °C and hold at that temperature for 1 h under the stream of N2 (30 mL/min). Cyclohexane was fed by syringe pump (0.6 mL/h) and carried by the flow of N2 (60 mL/min) through the catalyst bed. The reaction was tested for 6 h on stream at 450–600 °C. The gaseous product mixture was passed through a gas sampling loop of an online gas chromatograph, equipped with HP-5 column (30 m length, 0.32 mm internal diameter, 0.25 μm film thickness) and flame ionized detectors (FID). The following temperature program was used for the analysis: holding at 35 °C for 9 min, followed by ramping to 100 °C at the rate of 15 °C/min and hold for 30 s, then ramping to 220 °C at the rate of 15 °C/min. N2 gas was used as a carrier gas with a linear velocity of 30 cm/s.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization
The %Co loadings on the catalysts prepared by strong electronic adsorption (SEA) of various cobalt precursors are approximately 1–2%wt, following [Co(NH3)6]Cl3 > [Co(NH3)5Cl]Cl2 > [Co(bipy)3](NO3)2, as shown in Table S1 (Supplementary materials). This is presumably because, at pH 11, silica surface possesses negatively charge that could electronically interact with the positive cobalt complexes. According to the “Hard & Soft-Acid & Base” principle, [Co(NH3)6]Cl3 could interact with the “hard” silica surface more effectively, as compared to the others [25]. This is because charge density of the complexes is in the order of [Co(NH3)6]Cl3 > [Co(NH3)5Cl]Cl2 > [Co(bipy)3](NO3)2 > trans-[Co(en)2Cl2]Cl. However, trans-[Co(en)2Cl2]Cl is an exception as this complex contains active chloride ligand. For this reason, the complex is relatively reactive and could be hydrolyzed or react with hydroxide or O– on silica surfaces. Hence, the adsorption of trans-[Co(en)2Cl2]Cl is governed by reactivity of the complex, not the charge density as expected. Accordingly, a higher cobalt content is obtained with the sample using trans-[Co(en)2Cl2]Cl as a precursor (EN2Cl2), despites its relatively low charge density. It is worth noting that surface area of all catalysts prepared by SEA is similar to that of the parent silica support (280–290 m2/g).
A controlled sample prepared by wetness impregnation contains cobalt as much as 4.85%wt. Bulk Co oxide would be formed in this sample after calcination. In line with this view, H2-TPR profiles of the Co/SiO2 prepared by wetness impregnation (IM) (Fig. 1) shows two main reduction peaks at ~330 °C and ~440 °C, corresponding to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO and CoO to metallic Co, respectively. A small reduction peak observed at ~785 °C, indicates the presence of some cobalt species strongly interacted with the silica surface [26].

TPR profile Co on SiO2 prepared by using various precursors (10% H2/Ar, ramping at 10 °C/min) (BP3 is Co/SiO2 prepared by [Co(bipy)3](NO3)2, N6 is Co/SiO2 prepared by [Co(NH3)6]Cl3, EN2CL2 is Co/SiO2 prepared by trans-[Co(en)2Cl2]Cl, IM is Co/SiO2 prepared by wetness impregnation using Co(NO3)2.6H2O).
In sharp contrast, all Co/SiO2 catalysts prepared by SEA exhibit only high-temperature peak at ~650–850 °C, representing the reduction of Co2+ species that strongly interact with the silica surface, i.e. surface cobalt silicate [26]. It is also noted that hydrogen consumption from the H2-TPR profile (Table 1) corresponds to the observed cobalt loadings. Together with relatively low cobalt loading, the high reduction temperature of the cobalt catalysts prepared by SEA could indicate a high dispersion of the cobalt species on silica. In line with this view, NH3-TPD experiment has revealed that NH3/cobalt (mol/mol) of ~3 is obtained for BP; while, the IM shows only 0.1 NH3/cobalt (mol/mol). This implies a higher extent of exposed cationic cobalt in the catalysts prepared by SEA, as compared to the impregnated one. In a support manner, TEM of the reduced BP3 (Fig. S1 in supplementary materials) shows extremely small cobalt particle (<1 nm); while, the average size of cobalt from the reduced impregnated-catalyst is ~16 nm.

3.2. Catalytic testing
Cyclohexane conversions over calcined Co/SiO2 prepared by SEA technique are depicted in Fig. 2. All catalysts provide relatively high stability over 6 h on stream. The activity, as of moles of cyclohexane converted over total mole of cobalt in the catalyst bed per hour (apparent turnover frequency, apparent-TOF), is in the order of BP3 > > N5Cl > N6 > EN2Cl2 (Table 1). This result clearly indicates that use of different cobalt complexes as precursors, leads to the cationic cobalt species with different activity, particularly for the BP3. This catalyst exhibits significantly higher activity, as compared to others; XANES has revealed that Co2+ (7718.0 eV) is virtually present in this sample (Fig. S2 and Table S2 in the supplementary materials). While the edge energy of the cobalt species is increased towards that of Co3+, i.e. from BP3 (7718.0 eV), N6 (7718.4 eV) to EN2Cl2 (7719.6 eV), the dehydrogenation activity is comparably decreased. In line with this observation, the typical bulk cobalt(III) oxide on silica (IM), exhibiting an edge energy (7720.56 eV) closed to that of Co3+ standard (7721.01 eV), gives a notably low activity (Table 2).

The above results indicate that the dehydrogenation activity could be attributed mainly from the cationic Co2+species. Hence, the different activity, observed for these catalysts, could be governed by (i) the composition (Co2+/Co3+) and (ii) dispersion of the cationic cobalt species formed after calcination. As the charge interaction plays significant role in SEA [[27], [28], [29], [30]], cobalt precursors with different hydrophilic-hydrophobic natures may well interact to particular silanol region on the surface, presumably with different negatively charge density. One may presume that the hydrophobic [Co(bipy)3](NO3)2 precursor could interact more preferably with the less condense silanol region (i.e. isolated or vicinal silanol), as compared with the hydrophilic [Co(NH3)6]Cl3. Accordingly, the cationic cobalt species obtained in BP3 would be highly dispersed as Co2+ species with less amount of Co3+ aggregates, when compared to that in N6. While trans-[Co(en)2Cl2]Cl may prone to be hydrolyzed easier than other complex precursors; relatively more Co3+ aggregates could be expected in EN2Cl2 after calcination. With this hypothesis, EN2Cl2 would possess relatively lower fraction of highly dispersed Co2+ species (higher edge energy ~7719.6 eV, Table S2) and give relatively lower activity, as compared to BP3 and N6. In other words, the difference in the observed activity could be derived from the different types and hence, particle size of the cationic cobalt species.
A higher selectivity to benzene is also observed for the catalyst with higher Co2+ characteristic, i.e. lower edge energy (BP3). This is presumably because benzene is a secondary product for cyclohexane dehydrogenation. Therefore, the increase in benzene yield can be expected at higher conversion. In other words, the higher the activity of the catalyst, the higher the benzene yields. This is deduced from the observed product distribution at low conversion (initial rate), as shown in Fig. 3. It can be clearly seen that, upon increasing contact time (W/F, 36–144 g.h/mol), the conversion of cyclohexane is rising from 3.0% to 7.2%. Cyclohexene is initially increased then reaches a plateau at 3.2%, while benzene is gradually raised at higher contact time. This indicates that CH bond of cyclohexane can be readily activated over cationic cobalt species, presumably in a manner similar to that observed for propane dehydrogenation over single-site Co2+/SiO2 [10], Zn2+/SiO2 [12], and Fe2+/SiO2 [13]. The dehydrogenation of alkane is proposed to follow (i) the CH dissociation of the alkane with the formation of surface cobalt-alkyl species and a corresponding silanol, and (ii) β-H elimination of the cobalt-alkyl species [19]. Unlike dehydrogenation of light alkane widely reported in literature [[31], [32], [33], [34], [35]], benzene is observed, in a small fraction at initial then proportionally increased with the contact time in this study. Such exponential increase in benzene with an unchanging yield of cyclohexene indicates that the produced cyclohexene can be subsequently dehydrogenated to benzene in a consecutive reaction pathway. This is because adsorption of the cyclohexene produced on the cationic cobalt species, would be stronger than that of the cyclohexane feed. Hence, the subsequent dehydrogenation of cyclohexene to benzene would be promoted at a higher conversion. Therefore, it is not surprise that the catalyst with higher activity (i.e. BP3) would give higher selectivity of benzene vice versa for that of cyclohexene (Table 1). In line with this view, Fig. 4 shows a linear relationship between benzene selectivity and conversion, regardless of either contact time or type of catalysts.

Fig. 4. Benzene selectivity vs conversion of cyclohexane over BP3 (●), N5Cl (▲), N6 with various contact time (♦), EN2Cl2 (X) and N6 under hydrogen (◊).
One could expect that metallic Co may well be responsible for the observed high selectivity to benzene. This assumption is ruled out from the reaction over this cationic cobalt species since the lower activity of reduced catalyst is observed, as compared to the non-reduced one, as shown in Table 2 (Entry 1–3). With the increase of the reduction temperature of N6 (550 to 650 °C), the conversions were exceedingly dropped. This again indicates that the Co2+ is an active species for cyclohexane dehydrogenation (Noted from Fig. 1 that the Co2+ species can be reduced at >600 °C). It also seems that metallic Co is much less active under the reaction conditions investigated. This is concluded from the observed similar selectivity towards each product over non-reduced and reduced catalysts at the same conversion (Table 2, Entry 4 and 5). In other words, the active sites in the reduced catalyst (Entry 5) would be the Co2+ species retained from the reduction to metallic Co at 550 °C, i.e. the same active site as in the non-reduced catalyst (Entry 4), but with a relatively less quantity.
Although the metallic Co seems to be inactive, the reaction under H2, in turn shows activity, roughly three times higher than that under N2 (Table 2, Entry 1 and 6). Moreover, under H2 atmosphere, benzene becomes a main product with some additional cracking products. This suggests that, without reduction to metallic Co, an active species has been virtually modified, into “cobalt hydride intermediate” under H2 flow. It was proposed in literatures [10,[36], [37], [38]] that the dissociation of hydrogen could take place on the surface cobalt silicate, forming a cobalt hydride intermediate and a corresponding silanol. Such intermediate may well facilitate the CH dissociation of cyclohexane to form cobalt-alkyl species, without dissociation of CoO bond as depicted in Fig. S3 in supplementary materials. Hence, a higher activity under H2 could be expected, as compared to the Co2+ species (formed under N2). Accordingly, the higher selectivity of benzene would be obtained under H2 as a function of conversion discussed earlier (Fig. 4). The presence of H2 can also facilitate desorption of the product, recovering the cobalt active site. In addition the removal of surface carbonaceous deposits by means of hydrogen shall be considered for the observed enhanced activity.
The formation of the cobalt hydride could be reversible since the reaction of cobalt hydride and the adjacent silanol would readily promoted in the absence of hydrogen. In line with this view, the observed activity is indeed declined upon replacing flow of H2 by N2, and the process is repeatedly recovered as shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that, as the carrier gas is switched to H2, the activity is gradually enhanced, together with an increased yield of benzene (TOS ~100–175 min). Upon replacing H2 with N2, the activity and selectivity return to the initial stage, presumably due to the decomposition of cobalt hydride intermediate to Co2+ species under inert atmosphere (TOS ~175–250 min). The following experiment repeatedly emphasizes that the process is reversible, i.e. the cobalt hydride intermediate is recovered providing again a higher activity and selectivity to benzene (TOS ~250–325 min). Interestingly, both activity and product selectivity maintain the same (for each carrier gas) after switching H2 and N2. This indicates that the active Co2+ site is not reduced into metallic Co under this condition. If the metallic Co is formed, the activity would be permanently dropped as observed in the reduced samples (Table 3, Entry 2 and 3).

Fig. 5. Conversion of cyclohexane and yield of products at alternating N2 and H2 atmospheres using N6 as a catalyst; conversion (♦), cyclohexene (ж), benzene (▲), ethylene (■), methane (●). Reaction condition; Temperature: 550 °C, Pressure: 1 atm, Contact time: 36 g.h/mol, Flow rate of N2 carrier gas 60 mL/min.
Upon increasing the reaction temperature (450–600 °C), the cyclohexane conversion over N6 is enhanced from 0% (450 °C), 1.4% (500 °C), 3.0% (550 °C) to 9.1% (600 °C) as shown in Table 3 (Entry 6, 7, 1, 8, respectively). This indicates that the CH activation of cyclohexane requires the temperature above 450 °C yielding cyclohexene and benzene as main products. The selectivity of benzene keeps rising along with the reaction temperature; while, the selectivity of cyclohexene is in the opposite trend. Again the change in selectivity would be a result of an increase in conversion as discussed previously. Furthermore, at 600 °C, ethylene, ethane, and 1,3-butadiene were observed, presumably due to cracking of the cyclohexane or cyclohexene. Although the exact nature of the highly dispersed Co2+ species cannot be elucidated at this stage, the catalytic behaviors observed in this study (particularly for BP3 and N6) are somewhat similar to those reported for single-site cationic metal oxides [10,12,13]. Accordingly, the cyclohexane dehydrogenation over cationic cobalt catalyst may well be proposed as shown in Fig. S3a (supplementary materials).
4. Conclusions
The cationic cobalt catalysts, prepared by strong electrostatic adsorption of [Co(bipy)3](NO3)2 (BP3), [Co(NH3)5Cl]Cl2 (N5Cl), [Co(NH3)6]Cl3 (N6) and trans-[Co(en)2Cl2]Cl (EN2Cl2) on SiO2, can promote cyclohexane dehydrogenation with high stability. According to XANES, the highly dispersed Co2+ species, together with some Co3+ oxides, can be obtained after calcination despites that initial oxidation state of the cobalt complex precursors is either Co(II) or Co(III). Depending on the charge density of the Co complex precursors, the final catalyst with greater fraction of highly dispersed Co2+ species (i.e. BP3) shows relatively higher activity, as compared to others (i.e. N5Cl, N6 or EN2Cl2). The active Co2+ species (presumably “cobalt hydride intermediate”) provides significantly higher activity under flow of hydrogen. However, this active intermediate can be decomposed under inert leading to a decline activity. Nevertheless, the highly dispersed Co2+/cobalt hydride inter-conversion is readily reversible depending on the presence of hydrogen.
