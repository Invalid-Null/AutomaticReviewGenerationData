Improved propylene selectivity and superior catalytic performance of Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction
In recent years, Ga-based catalysts attract much attention in propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction due to environmental friendliness and low cost. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to obtain high selectivity of propylene under harsh reaction conditions. In this work, the supported catalysts (Ga-xMg/ZSM-5) were prepared with the sequential impregnation method and applied in the PDH reaction. The results show that MgO as an additive reduces the acidity of the catalysts, promotes the dispersion of Ga2O3 and improves the selectivity of propylene. As a result, the average particle size of the Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst is larger (4.5 nm), and the initial propylene selectivity is only 71.0 %. In contrast, the optimal Ga-0.7Mg/ZSM-5 catalyst shows the smallest particle size (2.4 nm) and the highest propylene selectivity of 90.8 %. In comparison with the previous GaOx catalysts in literatures, the Ga-0.7Mg/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits a superior production rate of propylene (
) based on either catalyst weight or Ga2O3 weight.
1. Introduction
In recent years, due to the rapid increase in the demand for propylene, the actual output from the traditional steam cracking method is increased slowly, and there has been an increasing production gap [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Further, because the traditional preparation method has low selectivity to propylene, more effective methods are needed for propylene production [10], [11], [12], [13]. With the massive exploitation of shale gas, the use of efficient and eco-friendly catalytic technology to convert propane to propylene has become a research hotspot [14], [15], [16], [17]. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technology consists of direct dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation with oxidizing agents (CO2 or O2) [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. Among them, the research of propane direct dehydrogenation catalytic technology focuses on the improvement of the activation ability of the C-H bond in the catalytic reaction, and prevents the undesirable C-C cleavage process, so that the catalyst isn’t easily deactivated [25].
At present, direct dehydrogenation of low-carbon hydrocarbons has been applied in industry, and its proportion in alkene production would continue to increase in the future [18], [19], [26]. The most commonly used catalysts in the industrial production of PDH are platinum-based and chromium-based ones [2], [25], [27], [28]. However, the high cost of platinum-based and the toxicity of chromium-based catalysts still impact their development despite of their good dehydrogenation activity. For the above-mentioned problems, researchers intend to explore other alternative catalysts [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]. Among them, supported GaOx catalysts have received extensive attention due to environmental friendliness and low cost [35].
ZSM-5 is a popular support for many catalytic reactions including PDH reaction because of its unique pore structure and high thermal stability [3], [36], [37]. Although the proper surface acidity of catalyst is conducive to the progress of PDH reaction, the excessive acidity of ZSM-5 generally leads to lower propylene selectivity [5], [38], [39], [40], [41]. For example, Shao et al. [42] reported that 5Ga2O3/ZSM-5 catalyst had poor stability and low propylene selectivity. Shen et al. [6] demonstrated that the stability and selectivity of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 catalyst in PDH reaction were enhanced by increasing the Si/Al ratio of HZSM-5 support. Therefore, the surface acidity of catalyst is an important influencing factor for PDH reaction. Researchers usually weak the surface acidity of zeolites through dealumination or adding additives to improve the propylene selectivity and catalytic stability in PDH reaction. Among them, the alkaline earth metal Mg is widely used as an auxiliary agent in various catalytic reactions. Wu et al. [43] introduced MgO additive into the VOx/Al2O3 system, and improved the stability of the catalyst by neutralizing the surface acidity of support and enhancing the dispersion of VOx. However, there are few works about the interaction between MgO and Ga2O3 on the performance of PDH reaction. MgO also can improve the thermal stability of other oxide catalysts for PDH reaction. To solve loss of the active component of ZnO catalyst, Zhao et al. [44] cleverly introduced MgO to combine ZnO species and improved the stability of ZnO catalysts for PDH reaction.
In this study, a series of Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 catalysts with different MgO loadings were prepared by the impregnation method, and the catalytic performance was tested for PDH reaction. The effect of Mg content on the acidic density and Ga2O3 dispersion on ZSM-5 zeolite was investigated, and the interaction between MgO and Ga2O3 on the catalytic activity was elucidated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of the catalysts
The raw ZSM-5 with the SiO2/Al2O3 = 470 was used as catalyst carrier. The supported Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by sequentially loading MgO and Ga2O3 on the ZSM-5 by the stepwise impregnation method. In brief, a certain amount of Mg(NO3)2.6H2O (obtained from Aladdin Industrial Corporation) was dissolved in 10.0 mL of deionized water to obtain solution A. Then, 1.0 g of ZSM-5 powder was added to the solution A, and stirred at room temperature for 24 h (cover with plastic wrap). The above mixture was dried overnight at 120 °C and calcined in air at 600 °C for 4 h to obtain xMg/ZSM-5. Then, a desired amount of Ga(NO3)3·xH2O (obtained from Aladdin Industrial Corporation) was dissolved in 10.0 mL of deionized water to obtain solution B. Then, the above obtained xMg/ZSM-5 powder was added to solution B and stirred at room temperature for 24 h. Finally, it was dried overnight at 120 °C and calcined in air at 600 °C for 4 h to obtain Ga-xMg/ZSM-5, where x was the mass fraction of Mg, and the Ga content was fixed at 5.0 wt%. For the control, the samples containing single MgO (Mg content was 0.7 wt%) or Ga2O3 (Ga content was 5.0 wt%) are also prepared with the same method, and named as 0.7Mg/ZSM-5 and Ga/ZSM-5, respectively.
2.2. Catalyst characterizations
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 catalysts were obtained at the Rigaku D/Max-2000 instrument (Cu Kα, λ = 1.5418 Å). The samples were scanned from the 2 θ value of 5° to 65° with a scan speed of 5°/min. Textural properties of catalysts were measured by N2 adsorption-desorption with NOVA 4000 (Quanta chrome, USA). The samples were degassed in vacuum at 300 °C for 3 h before nitrogen adsorption. The specific surface areas were calculated by the multipoint BET method. Total pore volumes were obtained from nitrogen adsorption at maximum relative pressure (P/P0). The pore size distributions of the catalysts were obtained by the Density-Functional-Theory (DFT) method. The morphologies of samples and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) images were detected by a field emission scanning electron microscopy equipped with a pendant EDX detector at 5.0 kV (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800, Japan). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of catalysts were captured at 200 kV using a JEM-2010. The particle sizes and distributions were measured upon TEM images with Nano Measurer software. UV–vis spectra of catalysts were analysed using the Shimadzu MPC-3100 spectrophotometer from 200 to 800 nm with BaSO4 as the reference. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of catalysts were obtained on a Perkin-Elmer PHI 5000 C ESCA instrument. Samples were calibrated with internal standard C1s (binding energy of 284.8 eV). In the temperature programmed desorption (TPD) tests of NH3, C3H6 and C3H8, 0.1 g catalyst was pre-treated at 400 °C for 30 min in the presence of helium flow. Then, the sample was cooled to 120 °C and purged with the adsorption gas (NH3, C3H6, or C3H8) for 30 min. Then, the desorption was carried out in the temperature range of 120–800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C·min−1. The desorped gas was measured by a TCD detector. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) of the spent catalysts was measured in air atmosphere on a NETZSCH STA 449F5 thermogravimetric analyzer. The measurements were conducted from 30 °C to 800 °C with a rising rate of 20 °C/min.
2.3. Catalytic activity measurements
The PDH reactions were carried out at atmospheric pressure in a quartz fixed-bed reactor with an inner diameter of 6 mm. 0.2 g of catalyst powder was placed in the reactor, and the bed temperature was detected by a thermocouple. Before PDH reaction, the catalyst was heated to 600 °C in Ar atmosphere with the heat rate of 10 °C/min. After the reaction bed achieved 600 °C, the feed flow containing C3H8 and Ar mixed gas (C3H8/Ar molar ratio = 1:4, total inlet flow = 40 mL/min, WHSVC3H8 = 4.7 h−1) was fed into the reactor. The products were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC, SP-6890) equipped with a AT-PLOT PORA-Q capillary column and a FID detector. The carbon balance (98.6–99.7 %) was calculated by the following formula (1),

In the NH3-TPD process, the exhaust gas flow containing NH3 was absorbed by an HCl aqueous solution with a specific concentration. And then, the residual HCl was titrated by a NaOH solution with a specific concentration. The total acid content acidity (mmol/g) was calculated with the following formula (10):

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterizations of the catalysts
The wide-angle XRD patterns of ZSM-5, 0.7Mg/ZSM-5, Ga/ZSM-5, and Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 samples are shown in Fig. 1. All the catalysts show the MFI-type framework structure [45], [46], indicating that with the introduction of MgO and Ga2O3, the crystal structure of ZSM-5 carrier isn’t destroyed. For 0.7Mg/ZSM-5, Ga/ZSM-5, and Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 samples, no diffraction peaks of metal oxides (MgO and Ga2O3) or alloys could be found due to the low loadings and high dispersion of species on the support.

The SEM images of Ga-0.7Mg/ZSM-5 sample are shown in Fig. 3. A coffin plate with a thickness of about 0.4 µm could be observed. It can be confirmed that the loading of metal oxides don’t change the morphology of the support. The mapping images of the Ga-0.7Mg/ZSM-5 sample show that each elemental species is uniformly distributed on the surface of the catalyst.

Fig. 4 shows the TEM images of Ga/ZSM-5 and Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 samples. There are obvious Ga2O3 clusters on the surface of Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst with an average particle size of 4.5 nm. With the increase of MgO additive, the size of Ga2O3 clusters gradually decreases, and the dispersion degree becomes higher. Ga-0.7Mg/ZSM-5 catalyst shows the smallest average particle size (2.4 nm) and the highest Ga2O3 dispersion. However, larger clusters appear on the Ga-0.9Mg/ZSM-5 catalyst surface again because excessive MgO is agglomerated on the catalyst surface. It suggests that the addition of an appropriate amount of MgO can neutralize the strong acidic sites of the support surface and reduce the accumulation of Ga2O3 clusters, which would increase the dispersion of loaded Ga2O3.

The UV–vis spectra of ZSM-5, 0.7Mg/ZSM-5, Ga/ZSM-5, and Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 catalysts are shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that Ga/ZSM-5 and all Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 samples exhibit the characteristic peaks of isolated gallium oxide at 210 nm [47]. When MgO is added, the peak value decreases and a red shift occurs, illustrating that the dispersibility of Ga2O3 is increased, which is well consistent to the TEM images in Fig. 4.

The chemical states of Ga in the Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 catalysts were detected by XPS technique and the results are shown in Fig. 6. The Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 catalysts mainly have two peaks at 1118.5 eV and 1145.4 eV, corresponding to the Ga3+ band [48]. It is generally accepted that the existence of Lewis acid sites is related to the tetrahedral sites of Ga3+ species, which is beneficial to the PDH reaction, but it is also the deposition sites of coke [49]. Through semi-quantitative analysis, Ga3+ accounts for a relatively large proportion in the Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 catalysts, implying that it would have good PDH activity. After introducing the additive MgO, the proportion of Ga3+ doesn’t change much. The analysis shows that the addition of MgO doesn’t affect the formation of Ga3+. The Ga2p binding energy of all Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 samples is higher than that of pure gallium oxide of 1117.9 eV [50], which can be explained that the gallium species are combined with the framework Si on the support surface to form a Ga-O-Si bond. Because of the low electronegativity of Ga, the binding energy of Ga element on the surface of Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 catalyst increases. It also shows the strong interaction between the Ga active sites and the carrier. Comparing 0.7Mg/ZSM-5 and Ga-0.7Mg/ZSM-5 catalysts, after adding gallium species, the binding energy of Mg element drops from 51.10 eV to 50.65 eV (Fig. S4). It shows that the surface magnesium species of the Ga-0.7Mg/ZSM-5 catalyst promote the transfer of electrons in gallium to magnesium and prevent the agglomeration of gallium species on the surface of the catalyst, which is beneficial to improve the dispersion of gallium species and reduce the particle size of gallium species. It is consistent to the results of TEM images in Fig. 4.

Proper surface acidity of catalyst is conducive to the progress for PDH reaction because acidic sites can extract hydrogen atoms from propane [51]. The NH3-TPD spectra of ZSM-5, 0.7Mg/ZSM-5, Ga/ZSM-5 and Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 catalysts are shown in Fig. S2 and Fig. S3. The peaks of ZSM-5 zeolite are centered at 164 °C, 340–472 °C and 597–679 °C, which can be attributed to weak acid site, medium strong acid site and strong acid site of ZSM-5 from the acid sites of Si−O(H)−Al specie, respectively [52]. By quantitative calculation (Table S2 and Table 2), ZSM-5 zeolite has a larger total acid content of 0.89 mmol/g, and the proportion of strong acidic site is 74.4 %. Too much strong acidic sites would promote side reactions such as cracking and reduce the selectivity of propylene. When MgO is added, the total acid content is reduced, the proportion of strong acidic sites is significantly reduced, and the proportion of weak acidic sites is increased, thereby reducing the occurrence of side reactions such as cracking.

Ga-0.3Mg/ZSM-5 76.5 23.5 0.55
Ga-0.5Mg/ZSM-5 82.1 17.9 0.54
Ga-0.7Mg/ZSM-5 80.6 19.4 0.45
Ga-0.9Mg/ZSM-5 82.6 17.4 0.44
The C3H8-TPD measurement was carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that all the samples mainly exhibit two desorption peaks: one at about 200 °C and the other at about 650 °C. The former should be attributed to the desorption of propane and its reaction products on weak and medium acid sites, and the latter should be attributed to the desorption of propane and its reaction products on strong acid sites. ZSM-5 support and Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst have strong desorption peaks for propane and its reaction products at higher temperature, implying the high intensity of strong acidic sites. When MgO is added, the intensity of the high temperature desorption peaks is significantly reduced for the Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 samples due to the neutralization of MgO [53], [54]. The low-temperature desorption peak center of Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 catalyst changed with the increase of Mg content. It is also seen that the peak centers of Ga-0.1Mg/ZSM-5, Ga-0.3Mg/ZSM-5, Ga-0.5Mg/ZSM-5, Ga-0.7Mg/ZSM-5 and Ga-0.9Mg/ZSM-5 are 156, 164, 171, 183 and 175 °C, respectively. Among them, Ga-0.9Mg/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits the highest low-temperature desorption peak center. It shows that Mg content affects the interaction between propane/products and Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 catalyst. Studies have shown that propane can be adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites of zeolites, which are crucial for the PDH reaction [55].

C3H6-TPD measurements were also carried out and the results are shown in Fig. S5. The high temperature desorption peaks of propylene on ZSM-5 support and Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst are 663 °C and 685 °C, respectively. Similar to the results of C3H8-TPD in Fig. 7, the high temperature desorption peaks for the samples were obviously reduced, even undetectable with the addition of MgO. It shows that the addition of an appropriate amount of MgO is favorable to the desorption of propylene and releases more active sites [56]. Thus, it can greatly reduce the occurrence of coke and other side reactions, and thereby greatly improve the catalytic stability for PDH reaction.
3.2. Catalytic performances of Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 catalysts
The influence of Mg content on Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 catalysts was explored, and the control experiments of ZSM-5 and 0.7Mg/ZSM-5 catalysts with no gallium oxide were also carried out. Fig. 8a shows the propane conversions of the Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 catalysts with time on stream. Among them, Ga/ZSM-5 exhibits the highest propane conversion accompanied with the lowest propylene selectivity (Fig. 8b). For PDH reaction, strong acidic sites of catalyst surface generally result in side reactions such as cracking etc., and thus a high propane conversion and low propylene selectivity. Here, Ga/ZSM-5 has the highest amount of strong acidic sites among all the samples (Table S2 and Fig. S3). This causes to the highest propane conversion and the lowest propylene selectivity for Ga/ZSM-5. With the addition of MgO, the propane conversion gradually declines due to the neutralization effect of strong acidic site by MgO modifier.

Fig. 8b shows the propylene selectivity of the Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 catalysts with time on stream. Fig. 8c shows the effect of Mg content on product partitioning under the same reaction time. The propylene selectivity of the Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst is low with an initial value of 71.0 %. Relationship between propylene selectivity and strong acid content is plotted and shown in Fig. S6. It shows that the propylene selectivity evidently decreases with the increase of strong acid content on the catalyst surface, which is consistent with the results of NH3-TPD (Fig. S2, Table 2). This indicates that with the addition of MgO, the strong acidic sites of ZSM-5 zeolite surface were neutralized, and the weak acid and the medium strong acid were regulated. For the Ga/ZSM-5 and Ga-0.1Mg/ZSM-5 catalysts, the strong acid contents are greater than 40.0 %, and thus they exhibit lower propylene selectivity (71.0%−75.0%). For the Ga-0.3Mg/ZSM-5 catalyst, the amount of strong acid of the catalyst is reduced to 23.5%, which promotes the propylene selectivity (80.0%). The NH3-TPD (Fig. S2, Table 2) results show a lower strong acid content (17.0%−19.0%) for Ga-0.5Mg/ZSM-5, Ga-0.7Mg/ZSM-5 and Ga-0.9Mg/ZSM-5 samples, which corresponding propylene selectivity is higher than 89.0%. From Fig.8b, an evident ascent in propylene selectivity is found for the samples with no or lower MgO loading (Ga/ZSM-5, Ga-0.1Mg/ZSM-5 and Ga-0.3Mg/ZSM-5). This may be attributed to the higher content of strong acidic sites of the samples, which causes to deep dehydrogenation, cracking and coking reactions, and thus lower propylene selectivity. However, with the procedure of PDH, the formed coke covered the strong acidic sites, reduced side reactions, and thus the ascent in propylene selectivity is found. This obvious upward trend in propylene selectivity for the samples of Ga/ZSM-5, Ga-0.1Mg/ZSM-5 and Ga-0.3Mg/ZSM-5 also corresponds to the high temperature desorption of C3H6-TPD (Fig. S5). Because of the adsorption of propylene on the strongly acidic sites, further dehydrogenation occurs on the surface of the catalyst, which reduces the selectivity of propylene. Fig. 8d shows that the propylene selectivity well matches with the variation of particle size of Ga2O3. With the addition of MgO, the particle size of Ga2O3 decreases, and meanwhile the propylene selectivity increases until the Mg content achieves 0.7 wt% in the catalyst. As the Mg content achieves to 0.9 wt%, the particle size increases, and meantime the propylene selectivity slightly declines for Ga-0.9Mg/ZSM-5 catalyst.
The calcination temperature of Ga-0.7Mg/ZSM-5 catalyst was also optimalized. Fig. S7 indicates that the sample calcinated at 600 °C exhibits the best catalytic performance both in propane coversion and propylene selectivity.
The comparison results of control samples of ZSM-5 and 0.7Mg/ZSM-5 are shown in Fig. S8. Under the same reaction conditions, the raw support ZSM-5 and 0.7Mg/ZSM-5 catalyst have a low propane conversion (about 2.0 %), and the catalytic activity is negligible. Also, the previous literatures showed that Ga2O3/MgO had no PDH activity [57]. Thus, the catalytic roles of carrier and MgO in the PDH reaction can be excluded. Ga2O3 is the main active species for the PDH reaction.
In addition, the influence of the loading amount of Ga on the PDH reaction was also studied, and the results are shown in Fig. S9. The results show that the initial propane conversion increases with increasing Ga content, while the initial propylene selectivity varies differently. Ga-0.7Mg/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits the highest propylene selectivity. However, 7Ga-0.7Mg/ZSM-5 shows the lowest propylene selectivity, which should be attributed to the agglomeration of Ga2O3 species at high loading amount.
To eliminate the influence of internal and external diffusion on the performance of the catalyst, the mass transfer of the superior Ga-0.7Mg/ZSM-5 catalyst were investigated, and the results are shown in Fig. 9. From Fig. 9a, it can be seen under the same W/F value, the reaction rate of propane (rC3H8) remains stable with different flow rates, implying the effect of external diffusing is excluded. On this basis, rC3H8 value also remains stable for the catalysts with different particle sizes, implying the effect of internal mass diffusion for the reaction is also excluded.

Coke deposition is an important factor leading to catalyst deactivation in the process of PDH reaction [58]. In order to explore the amount of carbon deposits, the TG analysis of the spent catalysts was performed, as shown in Fig. 10. It can be seen that the coke contents of the spent catalysts decreases with the increase of magnesium content. Among them, the coke content of the Ga-0.1Mg/ZSM-5 catalyst (4.65 %) is similar to that of Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst (4.40 %), and the coke content of the Ga-0.7Mg/ZSM-5 catalyst is the lowest one (2.76 %). The coke content of Ga-0.9Mg/ZSM-5 catalyst is increased (3.63 %) with the further increase of the magnesium content, which may be due to its lower propylene selectivity. The Ga-0.7Mg/ZSM-5 catalyst has a lower coke content, indicating that the addition of MgO obviously inhibits the formation of coke deposition due to the low surface acidity and the small particle size of Ga2O3 of the catalyst. The Ga-0.7Mg/ZSM-5 catalyst shows the lowest coke selectivity (about 3.9 %) among all the samples (Fig. S10).

4. Conclusion
A series of Ga-xMg/ZSM-5 catalysts with different Mg contents for PDH reaction were prepared by the sequential impregnation method. Appropriate amount of MgO can neutralize the strong acidic sites and regulates the acid distribution of ZSM-5 carrier. The addition of MgO changes the particle size and dispersion of Ga2O3, so that Ga2O3 is more uniformly dispersed on the surfaces of the catalysts. Upon introducing MgO additive, the deep dehydrogenation of propylene is suppressed and the propylene selectivity is improved. It demonstrates that MgO is one mild and effective alkaline auxiliary agent, which can optimize the PDH performance of Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst and exhibits good application prospects. In comparsion with the reported Ga-based catalysts, the optimized Ga-0.7Mg/ZSM-5 catalyst shows a superior production rate of propylene (rC3H6) based on either catalyst weight or Ga2O3 weight.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
