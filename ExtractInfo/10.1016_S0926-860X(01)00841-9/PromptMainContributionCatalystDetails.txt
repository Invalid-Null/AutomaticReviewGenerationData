Novel zeolite catalysis to create value from surplus aromatics: preparation of C2+-n-alkanes, a high-quality synthetic steamcracker feedstock
Abstract
With the advent of the second stage of the European Auto Oil Programme in the year 2005, the aromatics content of gasoline has to be reduced significantly which could lead to an oversupply of aromatics. The sources for aromatic hydrocarbons and their petrochemical use are briefly reviewed. Options for avoiding a surplus of aromatics in the years to come are discussed, i.e. diminishing their production and intensifying their conversion into valuable products. A novel catalytic route for hydrogenative ring opening of aromatics, which has been recently discovered in this laboratory, is described in some detail. It allows the conversion of pyrolysis gasoline from naphtha steamcrackers into a high-quality synthetic steamcracker feedstock composed of ethane, propane and n-butane, referred to as C2+-n-alkanes. It is shown that there are two process variants, namely, (i) a direct route utilizing bifunctional zeolite catalysts and (ii) a two-stage route comprising ring hydrogenation on conventional catalysts followed by ring opening of the resulting cycloalkanes on monofunctional, i.e. acidic zeolite catalysts. It is demonstrated that, in the direct route, the nature of the aromatic feed hydrocarbon may have a significant influence on the yield of the desired light alkanes. The second, i.e. ring opening stage of the two-stage route is discussed in detail with emphasis on (i) the zeolite pore architecture, (ii) its aluminum content and (iii) the presence of metal promoters. With both process variants, excellent catalytic results can be achieved, viz. (i) a complete ring opening of the aromatic or naphthenic feed hydrocarbon, (ii) high yields of the desired C2+-n-alkanes in the order of 70–80% or even higher, (iii) very low yields (<5%) of the undesired methane, and (iv) no measurable catalyst deactivation within 10 h. Key parameters to ensure such desirable results are (i) the use of a shape-selective zeolite catalyst, such as ZSM-5 or ZSM-11, (ii) the application of relatively high reaction temperatures in the vicinity of 400 °C, and (iii) elevated hydrogen pressures around 6 MPa.
1. Introduction
Aromatization of alkanes (especially of small n-alkanes) has been a topic in catalysis research for decades. High yields of aromatics are, e.g. obtained on gallium-containing zeolites in the Cyclar process [1]. However, with the advent of the new ecology-driven legislation, the opposite reaction, i.e. the hydrogenation and ring opening of aromatics may become a more and more attractive process option: with the objective to reduce the emissions of air pollutants from motor vehicles by 60–70% between 1996 and 2010, the European Union launched the so-called Auto Oil Programme. In order to reach its ambitious goal, a whole bundle of measures has to be taken, such as improved combustion processes, new end-of-pipe technologies and, last but not least, cleaner fuels. Novel fuel specifications for the years 2000 and 2005 were stipulated in the EU Directive 98/70/EC [2] (updated by EU Directive 2000/71/EC [3], cf. Table 1), which forces Western European refiners to reduce the aromatics content of gasoline from about 45 vol.% (average value in 1999 [4]) to 42 and 35 vol.% in 2000 and 2005, respectively [2]. Similar or even more severe legislation exists in other parts of the world, e.g. in California only 22 vol.% of aromatics are permitted in gasoline [5]. While the year 2000 specifications could be met with acceptable expenditures, fulfillment of the 2005 requirements is generally considered to be a great challenge. Within 5 years, the aromatics content of gasoline has to be reduced by a total of 10%. Thus, on the one hand, large amounts of other octane boosters such as alkylate, isomerizate and/or oxygenates will have to be added to gasoline. On the other hand, the production of about 14 Mt per year of aromatics (10 vol.% of the Western European gasoline demand of 120 Mt per year; aromatics have a considerably higher density than the other gasoline components) has to be stopped, or a new outlet for these aromatics has to be found. Considering that the chemical demand of BTX aromatics amounts to about 12 Mt per year (2000) only in Western Europe [6], it becomes obvious that the threat of surplus aromatics is an issue which ought to be dealt with timely.

For a deeper understanding of the aromatics markets, the situation in Western Europe will be analyzed in the first part of this review (Section 2). Possibilities to reduce aromatics production and to convert BTX aromatics into valuable products will be discussed. In the second part (Section 3), a novel catalytic route will be addressed in some detail which allows to convert surplus aromatics with hydrogen into a mixture of ethane, propane and n-butane which is a high-quality feedstock for the manufacture of ethene and propene in steamcrackers [7].
2. Aromatics in the past, present and future
2.1. Sources for aromatics
Altogether, in the year 1999 6.9 Mt of benzene, 2.3 Mt of toluene and 1.9 Mt of xylenes were produced in Western Europe [8]. The three most important sources for aromatics were (cf. Fig. 1): (1) reformate, the product of catalytic reforming of heavy gasoline, (2) pyrolysis gasoline, a by-product of naphtha steamcracking for the manufacture of ethene and propene and (3) by-products of coal carbonization, i.e. coke-oven gas, coal tar and coke-oven water (aqueous solution of oxygen- and nitrogen-containing aromatics) [9], [10]. Since the demand for toluene is significantly lower than that for benzene and xylenes, a small proportion of benzene and xylenes is, furthermore, produced from toluene via hydrodealkylation, disproportionation or transalkylation with C9-aromatics. Up till now, a large part of the aromatics mixtures obtained from these processes has not been separated into the pure components, but has been added as such to the gasoline pool for the purpose of octane enhancement. This option will be strongly restricted after 2005 (cf. Section 1). These mixtures of aromatics are difficult to specify and are neither included in Fig. 1 nor in the following paragraphs and sections.

Fig. 1. Production of BTX aromatics (excluding aromatics in gasoline fractions) in Western Europe from various sources (white: from catalytic reforming, gray: from steamcracking, black: from toluene or coal), after [6].
The dominant source of toluene and xylenes is reformate (cf. Fig. 1) which consists mainly of benzene (ca. 10 wt.%), toluene (ca. 20 wt.%), C8-aromatics (ca. 20 wt.%) and C9-aromatics (ca. 10 wt.%). A by-product of catalytic reforming with ever increasing importance is hydrogen. Its significance in modern petroleum refining will further increase in the years ahead, since the future sulfur specifications for gasoline (see Table 1), diesel fuel and heating oil will continue to become more stringent and the ever deeper hydrodesulphurization (HDS) will consume increasing amounts of hydrogen. Reformer capacities can, hence, only be reduced, if other processes for hydrogen production are implemented on a large scale. From today’s point of view, the only viable choices are steam reforming of natural gas, LPG or light gasoline and partial oxidation of distillation residues, combined with a consecutive shift reaction of carbon monoxide [11], [12]. While these processes for hydrogen production are commercially available, their implementation would be unduly expensive and has, up till now, been restricted to special cases (e.g. presence of a catalytic hydrocracker). Thus, a considerable reduction of the reformer capacities is very unlikely in the near future.
In Western Europe and Japan, by far the most important source of benzene is pyrolysis gasoline, because in these regions naphtha (straight-run light gasoline, the C5- and C6-cut from crude-oil distillation) is the predominant feedstock for steamcrackers and, therefore, besides ethene (ca. 33 wt.%) and propene (ca. 17 wt.%) about 21 wt.% of pyrolysis gasoline (consisting of 60–70 wt.% aromatics) are formed [13]. Since high annual growth rates of the demand of ethene and propene of 2.3 and 3.1%, respectively (compared to 1.5% for benzene and xylenes and 0.4% for toluene) are forecasted for the next 10 years in Western Europe (cf. Fig. 2) [6] and the global growth rates can even be expected to be slightly higher [14], a significantly increasing production of pyrolysis gasoline has to be anticipated. There are three possibilities to reduce the yield of pyrolysis gasoline [13]: (i) at higher temperatures of steamcracking and, therefore, higher cracking severities (accessible by new materials resistant to high temperatures), higher yields of ethene and lower yields of pyrolysis gasoline can be achieved. (ii) By replacing the long tubes with relatively large diameters normally installed in steamcracker furnaces by a larger number of shorter tubes with lower diameters, the residence time can be lowered considerably and, concomitantly, the yield of pyrolysis gasoline decreases in favor of the ethene yield. (iii) The nature of the steamcracker feedstock exerts an even stronger influence on the product composition: by using ethane instead of naphtha, the yield of ethene increases from 33 to 82 wt.%, while the yield of pyrolysis gasoline decreases drastically from 21 to 1 wt.%. However, at the same time the yield of propene drops from 17 to 1 wt.% as well. Given the significantly higher growth rates of propene compared to ethene, such a change from naphtha to ethane as a steamcracker feed would only be conceivable, if the demand for propene were met by other processes, such as the direct propane dehydrogenation, oxidative propane dehydrogenation, catalytic (FCC) or deep catalytic cracking (DCC) of vacuum gas oil (VGO) or olefin metathesis (conversion of 2-butene and ethene to propene) [15]. However, compared to 1990, for the year 2010 only a slight increase of the percentage of propene produced from refinery gas (from 22 to 23 wt.%, mainly FCC and DCC) and propane dehydrogenation (from 0 to 5 wt.%) is predicted [6]. Furthermore, because ethane is not traded internationally, it can only be fed at places where it is locally available (e.g. in the USA or the Middle East) [6]. Thus, for the foreseeable future, an increasing [4], [13] or at least constant [6] use of naphtha as steamcracker feedstock is to be expected in Western Europe (1999: 86 wt.%), and it appears very unlikely that an increasing production of pyrolysis gasoline can be avoided.

The importance of coal-derived products for the production of BTX aromatics has steadily decreased in the last decades. However, coke-oven water and coal tar continue to be very important sources for oxygen- and nitrogen-containing and polynuclear aromatics, and metallurgical coke, the main product of coal carbonization, is still a necessary raw material for the ferrous metallurgical industry. Therefore, the potential for a further reduction of the capacities for coal carbonization is limited. It must moreover be borne in mind that the amount of aromatics produced as by-products in coal carbonization is very limited (cf. Fig. 1).
In conclusion, a significant diminution of aromatics production is unlikely in the future, mainly because in the three aromatics-producing processes important by-products are formed (i.e. hydrogen in catalytic reforming, ethene and propene in steamcracking and metallurgical coke in coal carbonization) which tend to be decisive for the production capacities.
2.2. The role of aromatics in petrochemistry
The amounts of BTX aromatics produced in Western Europe and their chemical use are schematically shown in Fig. 3 [8]. No polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons are dealt with in this review, because they are much less important than the BTX aromatics (for example, the production figure for naphthalene, the most prominent polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon, is 0.24 Mt per year (Western Europe, 1996) [10]).

Fig. 3. Use of BTX aromatics in petrochemistry. All figures in parentheses denote annual productions in Mt per year in Western Europe by 1999 [8] (PS: polystyrene, SBR: styrene-butadiene rubber, ABS: acrylonitrile-butadiene styrene, PMMA: polymethyl methacrylate, MDI: methanediphenyl diisocyanate, HMD: hexamethylene diamine, LABS: linear alkyl benzene sulphonates, PVC: polyvinyl chloride, PET: polyethylene terephthalate).
With a production of 6.9 Mt per year, benzene is by far the most important aromatic hydrocarbon [8]. Its demand is currently increasing by about 3% per year in Western Europe [4] and by 4.5% per year worldwide [14], but this increase has been forecasted to slow down to 1.6% per year in the decade to come (cf. Fig. 2) [6]. More than half of the benzene produced is converted to ethylbenzene and styrene (used, in turn, for the production of polystyrene (PS), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR) and acrylonitrile-butadiene styrene (ABS) [10]), a product which is expected to have annual growth rates similar to those of benzene. In addition, new alternative production routes to styrene (e.g. from butadiene, another surplus compound [10], [16], [17]) are emerging. In this situation it is unlikely that use can be made of surplus benzene for additional styrene production [18]. The second important outlet for benzene is the Hock synthesis of phenol and acetone via cumene. The strongly increasing demand for phenol is mainly due to the fast growing polycarbonate market (synthetic resins and thermoplastics via bisphenol A). Other important products from phenol are phenolic resins and nylon-6. Acetone is mainly converted to polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Due to the strongly growing polyurethane market, the production of aniline, which is synthesized from benzene via nitrobenzene, increased strongly [8], and a comparable development can be expected in the next few years. In contrast, the growth potential of the nylon market (production from benzene via cyclohexane and ε-caprolactame, hexa-methylene diamine (HMD) and adipic acid or via phenol) is considered to be rather low [19]. Furthermore, competitive synthesis variants arise for the classical benzene-based process: by now, established methods exist for the synthesis of adipic acid and adipodinitrile from butadiene [10], [20], and novel processes make a combined synthesis of HMD and ε-caprolactame from adipodinitrile and of ε-caprolactame from butadiene and carbon monoxide possible [19], [20]. The demand for the two other benzene-based products, viz. linear alkylbenzenes and chlorobenzenes (chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzenes) is stagnant or even decreases [8]; maleic anhydride (the basis for polyester resins) will not be produced from benzene any more [10].
The second most important aromatic hydrocarbon is p-xylene (production in Western Europe 1.4 Mt per year). This is the aromatic hydrocarbon with by far the highest predicted annual growth rates till 2005 (4.9% in Western Europe [6] and 6.0% worldwide [14]). Via terephthalic acid and dimethyl terephthalate, it serves for the production of polyester fibers and films (especially polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a material widely used for plastic bottles), a very fast growing market. In contrast, the market for o-xylene is significantly smaller (about 0.5 Mt per year [8]) and stagnates or even decreases [4], [6]. The m-xylene is hardly used at all. Therefore, the importance of isomerization processes for the production of p-xylene from its isomers (mobil high activity isomerization (MHAI) process or Isomar process (UOP) [9]) will further increase.
About one half of the toluene produced is converted to benzene and xylenes [9]. This can be accomplished either by thermal or catalytic hydrodealkylation to benzene and methane or via acid-catalyzed disproportionation to benzene and xylenes, e.g. by the mobile selective toluene disproportionation process (MSTD, selectivities to benzene and p-xylene of up to 95% [21]) or by the Tatoray process [9]. In view of the general aromatics oversupply, the attractiveness of such processes could decrease, and the relatively expensive thermal hydrodealkylation will first have to face a shut-down [4]. The second most important outlet for toluene is its slightly decreasing [22] use as solvent (0.46 Mt per year by 1995 [9]). The most important chemical produced from toluene is toluene diisocyanate (TDI, 0.25 Mt per year by 1995) for the polyurethane industry [9]. Due to an increasing competition with aniline-based methanediphenyl diisocyanate (MDI), only relatively low growth rates are expected for the TDI demand. Growing outlets could be products such as phenol or ε-caprolactame, which are also accessible from toluene via benzoic acid (production from toluene: 0.13 and 0.02 Mt per year by 1995, respectively [9]). A new process which could gain importance is the shape-selective alkylation of toluene with ethene and the consecutive dehydrogenation to p-methylstyrene followed by its polymerization to poly-p-methylstyrene, a material which, due to its higher polymer quality, could partially replace conventional polystyrene [23], [24]. However, as for o- and especially for m-xylene, a significant oversupply is forecasted for toluene.
In conclusion, no chemical use is in sight for the surplus aromatics which are likely to appear on the market from 2005 on due to their partial phase-out from gasoline. Nor can the emerging oversupply problem be solved by a mere interconversion of aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. the selective disproportionation of toluene into benzene and p-xylene. The next logical step is, therefore, to look for innovative catalytic processes by which valuable non-aromatics are produced as an outlet for surplus aromatics. One such route is hydrogenative ring opening to produce, in a selective manner, aliphatic hydrocarbons with a sufficient demand and value. In the subsequent section, the various options for hydrogenative ring opening of aromatics are briefly discussed.
2.3. Principal possibilities of aromatics ring opening
Ring opening of BTX aromatics can be performed with two completely different objectives: (1) the production of high-octane components for the gasoline pool and (2) the conversion into a high-quality synthetic steamcracker feedstock. In the first case, iso-alkanes with the same carbon number as the feed hydrocarbon and, desirably, more than one branching are the most attractive products, because they are considered as ecologically acceptable, but still have relatively high octane numbers. Indeed, numerous patents have been filed which claim the conversion of fractions containing cycloalkanes (which can easily be obtained from the respective aromatics fractions by hydrogenation on conventional metal catalysts) into products rich in iso-alkanes: in an excess of hydrogen, the naphthenic rings are opened mostly at 3–5 MPa and 260–400 °C by hydrogenolysis on noble-metal catalysts on non-acidic or weakly acidic carriers (e.g. 0.9Ir/ECR-32 (a high-silica zeolite containing 0.9% iridium referenced to the mass of the dry catalyst, Exxon) [25], 1Pt/
-Al2O3 (Shell) [26], 2Rh/Al2O3 (Haldor Topsoe) [27], 0.9Pt, 0.8K/γ-Al2O3 (UOP) [28] or 0.5Pt/β (Mobil Oil Corp.) [29]). On platinum catalysts with high noble-metal contents and low dispersion and on iridium- or rhodium-containing ones, ring opening occurs selectively between two secondary carbon atoms [30] and, therefore, iso-alkanes are formed from branched cycloalkanes [27]. To achieve even higher yields of iso-alkanes, the hydrogenolytic ring opening is often combined with consecutive isomerization on acidic catalysts [28], [29]. The efficiency of the ring opening reaction can be enhanced by using a weakly acidic co-catalyst as carrier, which renders the isomerization of cycloalkanes with six-rings into five-ring isomers possible, and with the latter, hydrogenolysis proceeds much faster [25].
A completely different objective is the conversion of surplus aromatics into a synthetic steamcracker feed [7], [31], [32]. In this case, n-alkanes with two or more carbon atoms (C2+-n-alkanes) are the most desired products. In the steamcracker, iso-alkanes produce less ethene and propene, but more methane, and they are, therefore, less suitable as a steamcracker feed. Cycloalkanes give mainly aromatics; methane and aromatics are virtually inert in the steamcracker [9], [13]. Consequently, when preparing a synthetic steamcracker feed, the formation of cycloalkanes, aromatics and methane should be avoided. Converting aromatics from pyrolysis gasoline into a synthetic steamcracker feed consisting mainly of ethane, propane and n-butane enables a direct recycling of steamcracker by-products. However, low-value aromatic fractions (fractions rich in m-xylene or toluene, cf. Section 2.2) from other sources can also be used. In both cases, considerable amounts of naphtha, which has to be imported to Western Europe on a large scale (12 Mt per year as of 2000) and the availability of which is expected to decrease [4], [6], could be saved (cf. Section 3.1). In Section 3, the novel catalytic route for the manufacture of C2+-n-alkanes by hydrogenative ring opening of aromatics or cycloalkanes will be portrayed in some detail.
3. Production of a synthetic steamcracker feedstock from aromatics
3.1. Two process options
The two process options for converting aromatics into a high-quality synthetic steamcracker feed have been disclosed recently [7]. As sketched in Fig. 4, aromatics or an aromatics-rich hydrocarbon mixture can be directly converted with hydrogen on shape-selective zeolites in their bifunctional form [32], e.g. on Pd/H-ZSM-5 (see Section 3.2). An alternative is the two-stage route comprising ring hydrogenation of the aromatics to cycloalkanes on conventional hydrogenation catalysts and consecutive ring opening on shape-selective zeolites in their monofunctional acidic form [31], e.g. on H-ZSM-5 (see Section 3.3). Obviously, the main advantage of the direct route is that a single reactor suffices to achieve the desired catalytic conversion. Conversely, advantageous features of the two-stage route are (i) an easier removal of the heat generated in the two exothermic steps and (ii) the possibility to optimize the reaction conditions of ring hydrogenation and ring opening, in particular the nature of the catalyst and the process temperature, independently from each other.

In Fig. 5, a simplified mass and energy balance is given for a naphtha steamcracker of typical size (100 t/h, i.e. ca. 0.8 Mt per year) with conversion of the pyrolysis gasoline through the two-stage variant and recycling of the synthetic steamcracker feed [18]. It is based on recently published yields of the ring opening of methylcyclohexane (M-CHX) on zeolite H-ZSM-5 [31], typical yields of a naphtha steamcracker [13] and thermodynamic data from [33], [34]. It is obvious from the mass balance, that (i) about one quarter of the naphtha can be saved and (ii) that the hydrogen required for both ring hydrogenation and ring opening is produced in sufficient amounts in the steamcracker, i.e. no net import of hydrogen is required. From the energy balance, it can be deduced that the heat of combustion of the methane formed as a by-product (−715 GJ/h or −199 MW) would suffice to provide both (i) the heat required for vaporization of the steamcracker feed and the water co-fed (
) plus the heat required to bring the combined feed stream to the reaction temperature (total of 440 GJ/h or 122 MW) and (ii) the endothermic reaction enthalpy of the steamcracker (224 GJ/h or 62 MW). Additionally, smaller amounts of heat will be liberated during ring hydrogenation and ring opening (cf. Fig. 5).

3.2. C2+-n-alkanes from aromatics via the direct route
If an aromatic hydrocarbon is converted on a shape-selective zeolite catalyst in its bifunctional form, such as Pd/H-ZSM-5, under sufficiently high hydrogen pressure, a broad variety of products can be formed, and their distribution depends, in a pronounced manner, on the reaction severity, in particular on the temperature [32], [35].
A typical example is shown in Fig. 6. Toluene was converted under hydrogen pressure of 6 MPa in a fixed-bed reactor on a 0.2Pd/H-ZSM-5 catalyst (zeolite ZSM-5 with an nSi/nAl ratio of 20 in its Brønsted acid form, loaded with 0.2 wt.% palladium referenced to the mass of dry catalyst). While the conversion of toluene is 100% in the whole temperature range studied (200–400 °C), the types of reaction occurring and, consequently, the product yields, vary drastically: while ring hydrogenation to methylcyclohexane and skeletal isomerization of the latter into ethylcyclopentane and dimethylcyclopentanes are by far the dominant reactions up to ca. 250 °C, ring opening becomes more and more important upon increasing the temperature further. Compared to hydrocracking of aliphatic model compounds, which typically occurs on bifunctional zeolites around 250 °C, the temperatures required for cleavage of the naphthenic ring are relatively high, and this reluctance of alicyclic carbenium ions to undergo endocyclic β-scission has been interpreted in terms of an unfavorable orbital orientation in carbenium ions in which the positively charged carbon atom forms part of a naphthenic ring [36], [37], [38]. It is a direct consequence of these high temperatures of cationic ring opening that, once it occurs, it tends to be accompanied by secondary and, if the carbon number and the severity are sufficiently high, even by tertiary cracking reactions leading to cracked products with low carbon numbers [35]. In this way, high yields of C2+-n-alkanes, i.e. the desired synthetic steamcracker feed, amounting to 73% can be achieved from toluene at 400 °C (see Fig. 6). Interestingly, under these same conditions, the yield of the undesirable product methane can be kept very low (Ymethane=3–4%), and no cycloalkanes or aromatics at all are observed in the product [32], [35]. Fig. 6 also shows that, at 400 °C on Pd/H-ZSM-5, the only major by-products of the C2+-n-alkanes are iso-alkanes (especially iso-butane) with a yield of 24%. As a whole, the product spectrum formed on Pd/H-ZSM-5 at 400 °C represents an excellent synthetic steamcracker feed.

Information concerning the catalytic conversion of a broader variety of aromatics, which all occur in pyrolysis gasoline, on the same Pd/H-ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst is given in Table 2. It is again evident that ring hydrogenation is by far the predominant reaction at 250 °C. The relatively low reactivity of 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene is probably due to diffusion limitations for this relatively bulky molecule. The most interesting result is the pronounced dependence of the yields of individual products on the nature of the feed hydrocarbon at 400 °C, i.e. under conditions which are so favorable for the manufacture of synthetic steamcracker feed (cf. Fig. 6). For instance, much more propane (62.8%) is formed from benzene than from any other feed hydrocarbon. From toluene, by contrast, the yield of iso-alkanes (mostly iso-butane) is unusually high (23.9%). Still another pattern results, if ethylbenzene is converted. Here, an unusually high yield of ethane (30.6%) is observed, which is readily accounted for by an acid-catalyzed de-ethylation followed by hydrogenation of ethene. It is also evident from Table 2 that, among the aromatic hydrocarbons studied, toluene gives by far the lowest yields of C2+-n-alkanes, hence, with a real pyrolysis gasoline, yield values of 80% or higher can reasonably be expected.

To rationalize the different product compositions during hydrocracking of various aromatics with 6–9 carbon atoms, the different possibilities of cracking reactions have to be considered (Fig. 7): on the one hand, cycloalkanes (formed by hydrogenation of aromatics on the metal sites) or alkanes (from ring opening) can be directly protonated forming non-classical carbonium ions with three-center, two-electron bonds in the transition state (mechanism C) in Fig. 7, referred to as Haag–Dessau cracking [41], [42]). After secondary and tertiary cracking steps, light n-alkanes (including methane and ethane) are the dominant products, if this mechanism is operative, because Haag–Dessau cracking preferentially occurs at the most highly branched carbon atom [41]. Another salient feature of Haag–Dessau cracking is its relatively high activation energy, hence, it is getting more and more favored upon increasing the temperature [41]. On the other hand, hydrocracking on bifunctional catalysts can occur via the classical bifunctional mechanism (mechanism A) in Fig. 7) [37], [43]: unsaturated species (e.g. methylcyclohexenes) are formed on the metal sites and then adsorbed and protonated to carbenium ions on the acidic sites. After a usually occurring skeletal isomerization into highly branched isomers, classical β-scission can proceed. Finally, the dienes (or the two alkenes yielded, if acyclic hydrocarbons are fed) formed are hydrogenated on the metal sites. According to the degree of branching of the carbenium ions involved, classical β-scission has been classified into different types, viz. type A to type E, see Fig. 8 [44], [45], which each require a minimum of carbon atoms (nc): at least eight carbon atoms are necessary for type A β-scissions which start from and lead to tertiary carbenium ions, while type D β-scissions, which start from secondary cations and lead to primary ones, can proceed with as few as five carbon atoms. An important difference between the various types of β-scissions concerns their rates: these rates strongly decrease in the order type A to type E and D [44], [45]. Note that both fragments of a type A β-scission are branched (Fig. 8), and this is the mechanistic reason for the high content of iso-alkanes in the cracked products, if there are no space limitations. In a shape-selective zeolite, however, such as ZSM-5, the spatial constraints do not allow the bulky precursors of type A β-scissions to form, hence, type B to type E and D β-scissions have to be considered only [44].

Fig. 8. Classification of cationic β-scissions according to the degree of branching of the parent carbenium ions involved after Weitkamp et al. [44] (the term “type E2 β-scission” was coined later by Buchanan et al. [45]). The minimum number of carbon atoms (nc) necessary for each type of β-scission is given in parentheses.
On the basis of these mechanistic concepts, the product compositions found for different aromatic feeds (Table 2, T=400 °C) can be interpreted as follows [35]: the very large propane yields (62.8%) observed during the conversion of benzene are mainly due to classical type C β-scissions (nc=6, see Fig. 8), while the simultaneous formation of methane (Y=3.7%), ethane (Y=14.4%) and n-butane (Y=11.9%) is believed to be mainly due to Haag–Dessau cracking. An alternative explanation invoking type D β-scissions appears less likely, because, if they proceeded, more iso-butane (Yiso-butane=3.5%) would be expected to form via the faster type E2 β-scission than n-butane via type D β-scission. The assumption that Haag–Dessau cracking is involved to a significant extent in benzene conversion over Pd/H-ZSM-5 at 400 °C is additionally supported by the extremely low yield of cracked products (including ring opening products) at 250 °C (0.52% compared to 13.4% with toluene, cf. Table 2, this is a well known feature of bifunctional benzene cracking [46]), i.e. at a temperature where Haag–Dessau cracking is not yet operative at all. During cracking of aromatics with seven and more carbon atoms, classical β-scission becomes more important, because the considerably faster type B β-scissions can now proceed. This way, the unusually high yields of iso-alkanes (see Table 2, Yiso-alkanes=23.9%, mainly iso-butane) from toluene can readily be understood: both type B1 and type B2 β-scissions of heptyl cations lead to iso-butane (cf. Fig. 8).
It is worth mentioning that no deactivation was ever observed within 10 h time-on-stream during the conversion of any aromatic hydrocarbon on Pd/H-ZSM-5 at a hydrogen pressure of 6 MPa and a temperature of 400 °C. In contrast, a slight deactivation did occur at lower reaction temperatures (between 200 and 350 °C). Interestingly, when toluene was converted on 0.2Pd/H-ZSM-5 at 200 °C, hydrogenated dimers (e.g. 1-(cyclohexylmethyl)-4-methylcyclohexane) were found in small amounts in the product stream [35]. If toluene was then again converted on the same catalyst batch at 400 °C, significantly enhanced yields of the desired C2+-n-alkanes (80.4% instead of 72.8%, cf. Table 2) were observed [32]. This was interpreted in terms of the well known effect of coke selectivation, i.e. small amounts of coke must have deposited in the zeolite pores during the low-temperature experiments, and this brought about a subtle narrowing of the pores with a beneficial effect on the product yields [35].
Increasing the palladium content of Pd/H-ZSM-5 from 0.2 to 0.5 and 1.0 wt.% did not result in any change of the catalytic activity or selectivity in the conversion of toluene at 400 °C [32]. From this it has been concluded that the small amounts of methane formed (3.3%, see Table 2) are not due to hydrogenolysis on the noble metal. If, however, the palladium content was reduced to as little as 100 wt. ppm (which gave an excellent catalyst for the conversion of cycloalkanes, vide infra, Section 3.3.4), the toluene conversion under the standard conditions given in the heading of Table 2 dropped from 100 to 38.2% at 400 °C, and the dominant products were other aromatics [35], i.e. the zeolite had lost its bifunctional character. Indeed, the results obtained in the conversion of toluene on H-ZSM-5 modified with 100 wt. ppm Pd resembled those reported in the literature for aromatics conversion on metal-free, acidic zeolites, such as H-Y, H-mordenite and H-β [47] or H-ZSM-5 [48].
3.3. C2+-n-alkanes by ring opening of cycloalkanes
3.3.1. Conversion on zeolite H-ZSM-5
In the hydroconversion of methylcyclohexane (M-CHX, a model component for hydrogenated pyrolysis gasoline) at 400 °C on acidic zeolite H-ZSM-5 (nSi/nAl=20 unless otherwise specified), yields of C2+-n-alkanes comparable to those during the direct conversion of toluene on Pd/H-ZSM-5 are obtained (ca. 72% [31], [49]); no changes in the conversion or yields are observed within 10 h time-on-stream. Again, such good catalytic results can only be achieved, if suitable conditions are applied: (1) a high excess of hydrogen (e.g. pH2/pM-CHx≈100, (2) a high total pressure (e.g. 6 MPa), (3) a relatively high temperature (e.g. 400 °C) and (4) a shape-selective catalyst (e.g. ZSM-5). By contrast, it has been reported in the literature that, if methylcyclohexane is converted at about 450 to 500 °C and 0.1 MPa in nitrogen, light n-alkanes and alkenes such as ethene, propene and butenes are obtained, but even on the shape-selective zeolite H-ZSM-5 considerable amounts of higher hydrocarbons (mainly aromatics) are formed, giving rise to fast deactivation [50], [51]. In this case, a continuous regeneration as it is employed in catalytic cracking (FCC, DCC) would be necessary. At low temperatures (<300 °C) and, therefore, low conversion, but high hydrogen pressure, isomerization of methylcyclohexane into ethylcyclopentane and dimethylcyclopentanes are the dominant reactions. With increasing temperature, ring opening and consecutive secondary and tertiary cracking reactions become more important, and the contribution of non-classical Haag–Dessau cracking (see Section 3.2) increases drastically. Therefore, the yields of cycloalkanes and iso-alkanes pass through maxima at 300 and 350 °C, respectively, while the yield of the desired C2+-n-alkanes increases monotonously (see Fig. 9) [31], [49]. However, the yield of the very undesired methane increases as well with increasing temperature, which restricts the applicable temperature window at the upper end.

3.3.2. Influence of the zeolite pore structure
With increasing geometrical constraints, i.e. decreasing pore width in the order H-Y, H-β, H-ZSM-11, H-ZSM-5, H-ZSM-22 and H-ZSM-35, three important effects occur during the reaction of methylcyclohexane: (1) whereas the large-pore zeolites H-Y and H-β deactivate due to the spatially demanding formation of polynuclear aromatics [49], [50], no significant decrease in the yields of C2+-n-alkanes is observed during 7 h time-on-stream on the medium-pore zeolites H-ZSM-11, H-ZSM-5, H-ZSM-22 and H-ZSM-35 [49]. (2) The conversion decreases drastically from, e.g. 100% at 400 °C on H-ZSM-5 to 28.4% on H-ZSM-22 and to as little as 13.3% on H-ZSM-35. In-line with adsorption data, this is attributed to the hindered diffusion of methylcyclohexane in these zeolites [7], [49]. (3) A strong increase in the selectivity to C2+-n-alkanes is observed (see Fig. 10) [7], [49]: on the zeolites with the narrowest pores, viz. H-ZSM-35 and H-ZSM-22, even at a relatively low conversion of about 15% high selectivities to C2+-n-alkanes of 41 and 64%, respectively, are achieved. Selectivities of 28 and 18% only are obtained at this low conversion on the other medium-pore zeolites, i.e. ZSM-5 and ZSM-11, and no C2+-n-alkanes at all are formed on the large-pore zeolites H-β and H-Y. These increasing selectivities to C2+-n-alkanes with increasing spatial constraints in the pores correlate well with the modified constraint index (CI∗, cf. Fig. 11), which is probably a transition-state controlled catalytic measure for the spatial constraints inside zeolite pores [52]. Similar selectivity trends have been observed during the conversion of methylcyclohexane in nitrogen at 0.1 MPa [50], [51], [53] and can be accounted for by a higher contribution of non-classical Haag–Dessau cracking because on acidic zeolites classical cracking requires a spatially demanding bimolecular hydride transfer besides the classical β-scission (see Fig. 7B). As a measure of the contributions of monomolecular Haag–Dessau cracking (cf. Section 3.2) via non-classical carbonium ions versus classical cracking via carbenium ions, Wielers et al. [54] introduced the so-called cracking mechanism ratio
(cf. Table 3). In addition, the selectivities to C2+-n-alkanes can be further increased, if pre-isomerization of methylcyclohexane and heptane (formed as an intermediate by ring opening) into branched isomers is suppressed by geometrical constraints in the medium-pore zeolites [49], [51], favoring the formation of n-alkanes via classical bimolecular cracking.

Due to the different dependencies of the conversion and the selectivities on the geometrical constraints, by far the highest yields of the desired C2+-n-alkanes with 71–72% are observed on H-ZSM-11 and H-ZSM-5, two zeolites with intermediate pore size (see Table 3).
3.3.3. Influence of the aluminum content of zeolite H-ZSM-5
As during the conversion of n-alkanes [54], [55], [56], the conversion of methylcyclohexane increases strongly with increasing aluminum content, i.e. increasing concentration of Brønsted acid sites. This is especially pronounced up to a medium aluminum content (nAl/(nAl+nSi)=2.7%; nSi/nAl=35); a further increase has only minor effects on the catalytic activities (cf. Fig. 12) [57]. However, the selectivity to C2+-n-alkanes is hardly affected by the aluminum content (see Fig. 13): at moderate temperatures (up to 350 °C), due to decreasing selectivities to cycloalkanes, a slight increase is observed with increasing aluminum content. Because this effect is less pronounced at 400 °C (very low selectivities to cycloalkanes), slightly lower selectivities to C2+-n-alkanes are obtained here at higher aluminum contents. This is attributed to an increasing contribution of classical bimolecular cracking [51], [57]. Because at 400 °C opposite dependencies on the aluminum content are observed for the conversion of methylcyclohexane and the selectivity to C2+-n-alkanes, the maximal yield of the desired C2+-n-alkanes of 78.0% is achieved on zeolite H-ZSM-5 with a medium aluminum content of 2.7% (nSi/nAl=35, cf. Table 4) [57].

3.3.4. Influence of hydrogenation/dehydrogenation components
During the conversion of methylcyclohexane, significantly higher yields of C2+-n-alkanes (>78%) can be achieved on zeolite H-ZSM-5 containing very small amounts of palladium (10–100 wt. ppm) than on the metal-free catalyst (72%). In contrast, on typically bifunctional catalysts such as 0.2 or 1.0Pd/H-ZSM-5 between 67 and 64% of C2+-n-alkanes are only obtained (see Table 5 and Fig. 14) [7], [39], [40]. These different effects are attributed to different contributions of classical cracking and Haag–Dessau cracking (see Section 3.2) [39], [40]: on typically bifunctional catalysts, dehydrogenation of, e.g. methylcyclohexane to unsaturated hydrocarbons such as methylcyclohexenes is efficiently catalyzed on the metal sites [37], [43]. Because these unsaturated compounds are much more strongly adsorbed on the acidic sites forming classical carbenium ions (see Fig. 7A) than the saturated ones forming non-classical carbonium ions (see Fig. 7C), classical bifunctional cracking (cf. Fig. 7A) clearly dominates in this case. Classical cracking can also take place on monofunctional acidic catalysts. However, here the carbenium ions have to be formed in a sterically demanding, bimolecular hydride transfer (see Fig. 7B). Therefore, especially on medium-pore zeolites, bimolecular classical cracking is accompanied by non-classical Haag–Dessau cracking (cf. Section 3.3.2). While classical cracking can, thus, proceed on bifunctional and monofunctional acidic catalysts in its bifunctional (cf. Fig. 7A) or bimolecular (cf. Fig. 7B) variant, respectively, on catalysts with very small amounts of palladium a lack of an efficient formation mechanism for carbenium ions can hinder classical cracking and favor Haag–Dessau cracking [39], [40]: on the one hand, there are not enough metal sites to dehydrogenate methylcyclohexane at a sufficiently high rate for the bifunctional mechanism to proceed. On the other hand, these few metal sites suffice for a reasonably fast hydrogenation of the reaction products and, thus, hinder the bimolecular hydride transfer [39], [40], [58]. In line with this interpretation, the term Haag–Dessau catalysts has been coined for such catalysts with ultra-low amounts of noble metals [39], [40]. This explanation is obviously supported by the temperature dependency of the CMR (cf. Section 3.3.2) shown in Fig. 15. The increase of the CMR and, hence, of the contribution of non-classical Haag–Dessau cracking versus classical cracking with increasing temperature observed on all catalysts is much more pronounced on acidic (CMR400°C=0.9) and especially on Haag–Dessau catalysts (CMR400°C≈1.5) than on typically bifunctional ones (CMR400°C≈0.3).

The alternative explanation for the formation of methane and ethane by hydrogenolysis on the metal sites [58] seems very unlikely, under the conditions applied here, because if it were operative, the yields of methane and ethane would be expected to increase with increasing palladium content, which is obviously not the case (cf. Fig. 14). Further and independent support comes from the finding that on 0.4Pt/H-ZSM-5 (0.4 wt.% Pt correspond to about the same amount of metal as 0.2 wt.% Pd) yields comparable to those on 0.2Pd/H-ZSM-5 are observed. It appears, hence, safe to conclude that hydrogenolysis on the noble metal does not play any significant role under the reaction conditions of this study [39], [40].
Similarly enhanced yields of C2+-n-alkanes (75–78%, see Table 5) are also observed, if gallium is incorporated into zeolites H-ZSM-5 in concentrations typical for bifunctional catalysts (0.14–4.9 wt.%). This indicates, that relatively high contents of metals with a low hydrogenation/dehydrogenation activity such as gallium have an effect similar to that of ultra-low contents of metals with a high hydrogenation/dehydrogenation activity such as palladium or platinum [59]. However, major drawbacks of Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts lie in the relatively large yields of methane (7.0–11.5%, see Table 5) and the decrease of the yield of C2+-n-alkanes from, for example, 77.6 to 67.8% within 500 min time-on-stream with a simultaneous increase of the yield of iso-alkanes from 10.9 to 25.2% (and a decrease of the methane yield from 11.5 to 6.8%) for zeolite 4.9Ga/H-ZSM-5. This is neither observed on the metal-free H-ZSM-5 zeolite [31] nor on Pd/H-ZSM-5 [39], [40] or 0.14Ga/H-ZSM-5 [59]. We tentatively attribute this undesirable time-on-stream behavior of 4.9Ga/H-ZSM-5 to sintering of the gallium species [59], in principal agreement with prior observations by Chang and Lee [60].
4. Conclusions and outlook
New ecology-driven legislation in Western Europe and other highly industrialized areas in the world calls for a significant diminution of the content of aromatics in motor gasoline, and no reasonable chemical outlet for the surplus BTX aromatics to be expected is in sight. Novel catalytic processes are, hence, needed which enable the conversion of surplus aromatics into valuable non-aromatic products. One example is the hydrogenative conversion of pyrolysis gasoline, an aromatics-rich by-product of naphtha steamcrackers, into a high-quality synthetic steamcracker feed consisting of ethane, propane and n-butane. Material balances unambiguously indicate that the hydrogen formed as another by-product in a naphtha steamcracker suffices to satisfy the demand of hydrogen of the new process.
The mixture of ethane, propane and n-butane, referred to as C2+-n-alkanes, can be produced from aromatics via two alternative routes (sketched in Fig. 4): (i) in the direct route, pyrolysis gasoline is converted on a shape-selective zeolite in a bifunctional form. An example for a good catalyst of this type is Pd/H-ZSM-5. (ii) in the two-stage route, the aromatics in pyrolysis gasoline are first hydrogenated by commercially available technology into the corresponding cycloalkanes. These can be hydroconverted on monofunctional, acidic zeolites into C2+-n-alkanes with high yields. Both routes were discovered in our laboratory. The knowledge accumulated so far on the catalytic chemistry of hydrogenative ring opening in aromatics and naphthenes has been collected in this review. Studies with model compounds indicate that, under appropriate reaction conditions, the yield of C2+-n-alkanes from either BTX aromatics or their cycloalkane derivatives are as high as 70% to over 90%. For a real pyrolysis gasoline, a yield around 80% is, hence, realistic. The yield of methane, which is a very undesired product since its formation consumes large amounts of hydrogen and it does not contribute to the production of ethene and propene in the steamcracker, can be kept very low (typically 3–4%). It is shown in this review that the window for achieving such favorable results is narrow: key parameters are a reaction temperature around 400 °C, a zeolite catalyst with the appropriate pore width (ZSM-5 or ZSM-11) and a hydrogen pressure in the vicinity of 6 MPa. No catalyst deactivation takes place within 10 h under these conditions. Large-pore zeolites, such as β or Y, deactivate rapidly. Conversely, on zeolites with too narrow pores, such as ZSM-35 or ZSM-22, no high ring opening conversion can be achieved, probably because of a hindered diffusion of the feed hydrocarbons. Expectedly, the aluminum content of zeolite H-ZSM-5 affects its activity, but it has very little influence on the selectivity. Surprisingly selective catalysts result, if zeolite H-ZSM-5 is doped with ultra-low amounts of palladium in the range of ca. 10–100 wt. ppm. The incorporation of gallium into H-ZSM-5 has a beneficial effect on the yield of C2+-n-alkanes, at the same time, however, gallium-doped H-ZSM-5 tends to give too high yields of methane. Mechanistically, all results point to a significant contribution of non-classical Haag–Dessau cracking.
In the future, there is still room for an enhancement of the yield of C2+-n-alkanes, e.g. by coke selectivation of the catalyst. The economic viability of the new process will depend, in the first place, on the price for pyrolysis gasoline once the Auto Oil Programme becomes fully effective, i.e. beyond 2004. Should the process go commercial, it is difficult to judge from today’s point of view, whether the direct or the two-stage route will win. An added benefit of the new process in a steamcracker complex is an increased overall yield of propene which has currently higher growth rates than ethane.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
