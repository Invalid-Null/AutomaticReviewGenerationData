Based on the provided documents, none of them discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) research. All documents focus on the conversion of aromatic compounds present in pyrolysis gasoline into alkane mixtures, not on PDH or ODH to produce propylene. Since the documents are not relevant to PDH or ODH advancements, a cohesive summary of scientific contributions cannot be provided. The output indicates that the documents are not relevant.
