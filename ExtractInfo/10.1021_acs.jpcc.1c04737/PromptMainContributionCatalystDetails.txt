Fabrication of Isolated VOx Sites on Alumina for Highly Active and Stable Non-Oxidative Dehydrogenation
Abstract
The vanadium catalyst is a promising alternative to the Pt–Sn catalyst for non-oxidative dehydrogenation, but developing a highly active and stable vanadium catalyst remains a huge challenge. Herein, we report a single-site vanadium catalyst with isolated VOx species on commercial Al2O3 (0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen) prepared with the salen–V complex as a precursor with the subsequential alkali washing process, showing unexpectedly high catalytic stability for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation to propylene compared to the polyvanadium catalyst in the absence of H2 in the feed, while this process over metal catalysts is often carried out in the presence of H2 gas to mitigate catalyst deactivation. It can be found that the isolated dispersed VOx species is responsible for the surprising catalytic stability owing to its unexpectedly high coke resistance. Furthermore, through alkali washing of the supported monolayer VOx prepared by the traditional oxalic acid (OA)-assisted method, the isolated 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–OA can also be achieved. However, the 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst prepared by a salen-assisted method shows 4.0 times the turnover frequency value compared to 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–OA prepared by the OA-assisted method, ascribed to the readily reduced V5+ to low-valance V3+ and V4+ by carbon species. This work not only generates a unique single-site vanadium catalyst for propane non-oxidative dehydrogenation to propylene but also opens a new avenue for designing other promising catalysts.

Light olefin is the critical chemical intermediate for production of alcohols, amines, alkyleneoxide, acetone, polymers, etc. (1) Transforming light alkanes to alkenes has attracted great attention in both chemical industrial and academic fields. (1,2) Propylene is one of the most critical feedstock for manufacturing various chemicals such as propylene oxide, polypropene, acrolein, acetone, and polyacrylonitrile. (3,4) Economically and environment-friendly dehydrogenation of propane shows an alternative route for propylene production compared to thermal and catalytic cracking of naphtha, which is energy-intensive and limited by deposits of fossil energy. (1,5) Generally, there are two major dehydrogenation techniques for propylene production: O2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation. The oxidative dehydrogenation is exothermic with no thermodynamic limitations; however, it is sensitive to specific oxidants like O2, and the deep oxidation of propane and propylene to COx easily occurs simultaneously with the formation of propylene, resulting in various byproducts in the product gas and the loss of propylene selectivity and yield. (6,7) Compared to oxidative dehydrogenation, the non-oxidative dehydrogenation, also called direct dehydrogenation, has emerged as a great promising method for propylene production. (2,3,8) Supported Pt- and CrOx-based materials are major catalysts for industrial production of propylene through non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. However, Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts suffer from the depressed catalytic stability owing to carbon deposition. (9−11) Although great efforts, such as H2-assisted direct dehydrogenation, element doping, and support modification, have been made to improve the on-stream catalyst stability, (12−16) the industrial Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are restricted by their high cost and highly toxic characteristic, respectively. The discovery of highly efficient, economical, and stable catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation is of immense economic and academic importance. The vanadium catalyst is a promising alternative to precious metals catalyst for non-oxidative dehydrogenation owing to the comparable activity to the Pt-based catalyst, considerable propylene selectivity, low price, and fine regeneration properties. (17) However, the VOx catalyst suffers from serious coke deposition and aggregation, resulting in severe deactivation during the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. (18−20) The research concerning active species of VOx/Al2O3 for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane reveals that V3+ is the dominating active site because of the close relationship between propane activation and the fraction of V3+. (20) However, further study gives the finding that the V3+ species is also the origin of coke formation and suggests that the V–OH group produced by H2 prereduction can lead to better stability by suppressing the coke deposition. (18) Alternatively, MgO addition is also applied to lower the deactivation rate of VOx/Al2O3 for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, but the result is still unsatisfactory. (21) Moreover, phosphine (PH3) surface modification of the VOx/Al2O3 catalyst leads to substantial improvement of its stability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. (22) However, the propylene selectivity is lower than 90%. In view of these, the development of a highly active and stable vanadium-based catalyst remains a huge challenge.
The interaction between the supported active component and support, which is affected by the size of supported particles, usually plays a great role in the modulation of catalytic properties of supported metallic catalysts. Isolated dispersed metallic catalysts, as an emerging frontier in catalysis science, have attracted extensive interest owing to the unexpected catalytic performance derived from their unique local atomic structures and the maximized interaction between the active component and support. (23−25) So far, the metallic catalysts with isolated sites give either low propylene selectivity or poor stability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. (26−29) A recent report by density functional theory (DFT) calculations concerning propane dehydrogenation (PDH) by a series of single metal atoms supported on g-C3N4 demonstrates that V1/g-C3N4 is a cost-effective and highly selective catalyst for PDH. (30) Monomeric VOx sites derived from the SiO2 support vanadium organometallic complex [VO(Mes)3] show enhanced propane conversion and propylene selectivity compared with crystal V2O5, but the stability shows disadvantages. (31) Vanadium-doped zirconium oxide catalysts are reported to be high active and selective for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. However, the catalysts show severe deactivation in a short time on stream (TOS) with or without H2 in the feed gas. (32,33) Commercial Al2O3 is a widely available support for the preparation of industrial catalysts due to its easy production and variable surface acidity. Polymerized VOx supported on Al2O3 can achieve comparable activity to the Pt-based catalyst for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, but the propylene selectivity and reaction stability still show disadvantages owing to the severe coke deposition and aggregation. In this regard, it is necessary and an emergency to construct the vanadium catalyst by a new strategy and explore its catalytic performance for non-oxidative dehydrogenation. The type of supported VOx species is determined by the surface V density (V atoms per nm2, V/nm2). (20,34,35) Typically, monovanadates, polyvanadate, and V2O5 formed at different vanadium densities: isolated VOx was the predominant species at a surface density of <1.2 V/nm2. Polymerized VOx coexisted with monovanadates at surface densities of 1.2–4.4 V/nm2. V2O5 formed at a surface VOx density of >4.4 V/nm2. V2O5 nanoparticles participated to a large extent after the VOx density above vanadia monolayer coverage (8–9 V/nm2). Compared to crystal V2O5 nanoparticles, isolated VOx and polyvanadate species show high metal utilization owing to the total exposure of V atoms, possessing great potential for investigation. We used the salen–V complex for the preparation of isolated VOx sites supported on commercially available Al2O3 for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane without introduction of extra H2, and we envisage that the promising catalytic results for non-oxidative dehydrogenation could be achieved.
Schiff base ligands are able to coordinate many different metals (V, Ti, Zr, Fe, Mn, Ni, Cu, Co, Zn, Al, Sm, etc.) to stabilize them, which are easily prepared by the condensation between aldehydes and imines. These properties enable the use of Schiff base metal complexes for a large variety of useful catalytic transformations. Salen, synthesized from ethylenediamine and salicylaldehyde, was used for the coordination with V species, and the formed salen–V complex was used as a V precursor. When the sample was annealed under a N2 atmosphere, the in situ formed carbons from the salen–V complex ensure high dispersion of vanadium species by restraining vanadate from polymerizing under high temperature, and the carbon species can reduce some V5+ to a lower valence.
In this work, an isolated VOx single-site catalyst supported on commercially available Al2O3 (0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen) with a large percentage of low-valence V species (V3+ and V4+) has been successfully prepared with the salen–V complex as a precursor. The catalyst was characterized by aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM), Raman spectra, and other characterization technologies. The isolated VOx sites were confirmed by the atomically dispersed V atoms in the HAADF-STEM image and the absence of the V–O–V signal in the Raman spectrum. Non-oxidative catalytic dehydrogenation over metal catalysts is often carried out in the presence of H2 gas to mitigate deactivation. The developed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen shows unexpectedly high catalytic stability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene with no deactivation after 11 h of TOS in the absence of H2. In comparison, the reference polyvanadate VOx-poly/Al2O3 catalyst showed rapid deactivation by 86.6% in terms of propane conversion (from 29.1 to 3.9%) and a 7.2% decrease in propylene selectivity (from 96.3 to 89.4%) after a 11 h TOS. The superior stability of the 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst is attributed to the unexpected coke resistance, and the stable V chemical state derives from its unique isolated VOx sites. Moreover, the developed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst exhibits 4.0 times the turnover frequency (TOF) with higher initial propylene selectivity compared to the traditional oxalic acid (OA)-assisted synthesized isolated 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–OA catalyst. This work presents a novel vanadium catalyst with isolated VOx sites differing from the polymerized V–O–V species and shows a great potential alternative to the Pt–Sn catalyst for practical applications in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

Ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3, 99.0%, AR, Bodi Chemical Co., Ltd.), anhydrous ethylenediamine (C2H8N2, 99.0%, AR, Damao Chemical Reagent Factory), salicylaldehyde (HOC6H4CHO, 99.5%, AR, Damao Chemical Reagent Factory), ethanol (C2H5OH, 99.7%, AR, Tianda Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), γ-Al2O3 (Tianjin Guangfu Fine Chemical Research Institute), ammonium hydroxide (NH3·H2O, 25–28%, AR, Xilong Chemical Co.), OA (H2C2O4, 99.5%, AR, Tianda Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.), argon (Ar, 99.999%, Dalian GuangMing Special Gas Products Co., Ltd.), nitrogen (N2, 99.999%, Dalian GuangMing Special Gas Products Co., Ltd.), hydrogen (H2, 99.999%, Dalian GuangMing Special Gas Products Co., Ltd.), propane (C3H8, 99.999%, Dalian GuangMing Special Gas Products Co., Ltd.) were purchased. All the reagents were used directly without further purification.
Synthesis of the Salen Ligand
In a typical synthesis, 2.2 mL of ethylenediamine was dissolved in ethanol at 80 °C for 10 min. Then, 7.2 mL of salicylaldehyde was added dropwise, and the solution was refluxed at 80 °C for 30 min. After reaction, the system was cooled down to room temperature and the yellow lamellar crystal was separated. For further purification, the crystal was recrystallized two times. The yellow crystal was filtered and dried at 60 °C. The salen ligand was finally obtained.
Salen-Assisted Synthesis of 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–Salen
In a typical procedure, a certain amount of the salen ligand and NH4VO3 (the mole ratio is 2:1) were dissolved in ethanol and the solution was kept stirring for 2 h at 80 °C. The luminous yellow solution gradually turned to deep burnt burgundy. Then, γ-Al2O3 powder was added, and the suspension was stirred. Subsequently, the suspension was rotary-dried, and a greenish-yellow solid was obtained. To make sure the high dispersion of vanadium species on the Al2O3 support, the solid was first carbonized for 3 h. Then, the carbon species was removed by calcination at 600 °C for 2 h with a ramping rate of 2 °C min–1 under an air atmosphere, and 1.5VOx-poly/Al2O3–salen was obtained [1.5 wt % V loading determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP)]. Finally, 1.5VOx-poly/Al2O3–salen was washed with diluted ammonia hydroxide at room temperature for 4 h. Followed by washing with DI water and ethanol and drying overnight, the isolated dispersed vanadium catalyst was obtained (0.5 wt % V loading determined by ICP), and the sample was denoted as 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen.
OA-Assisted Synthesis of 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–OA
For comparison, salen was replaced with OA to prepare the reference samples. Typically, a certain amount of NH4VO3 and OA were dissolved in ethanol solution (the mass ratio of OA to NH4VO3 was 5:3), and the solution was kept stirring for 2 h. Then, γ-Al2O3 powder was added, and the suspension was stirred. Subsequently, the suspension was rotary-dried and carbonized for 3 h at 600 °C. Then, the sample was calcined at 600 °C for 2 h with a ramping rate of 2 °C min–1. According to the V loading detected by ICP, the samples were denoted as 0.5VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA, 1.5VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA, and 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA. Furthermore, 1.5VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA was washed with diluted ammonia hydroxide at room temperature for 4 h. Followed by washing with DI water and ethanol and drying overnight, the isolated dispersed vanadium catalyst was obtained (0.5 wt % V loading determined by ICP), and the sample was denoted as 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–OA.
Characterization
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on a Thermo VG ESCALAB 250 instrument with Al Kα radiation. The samples were prereduced in a 20% H2/Ar atmosphere for 1 h and sealed in stainless tubes before the test. The binding energy was calibrated with the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV as an internal standard, and the deconvolution of spectra was performed using the program of XPS PEAK 41 with Gaussian functions after subtraction of the Shirley background. N2 physical adsorption–desorption isotherm curves were obtained on a Beishide apparatus with a 3H-2000 PSI system at 77 K. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method was applied for analyzing porosity of as-prepared samples. Mesopore size distribution curves were obtained with the BJH method from the adsorption branch. Samples were degassed at 423 K for 10 h before the test. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on Rigaku Corporation SmartLab 9 X-ray diffractometer equipment with Cu Kα radiation. Raman spectra were recorded on an inVia Qontor reflex Raman spectrometer equipped with 532 or 325 nm Ar-ion laser beams under ambient conditions. The solid samples were dehydrated at 300 °C for 2 h. The content of V in the catalyst was detected on a PerkinElmer OPTIMA 2000DV inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer. Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TGA/SDTA851e thermal gravimetric analyzer under an air atmosphere with 4 mg of samples. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) analysis was conducted on a Builder PCA-1200 apparatus with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) analysis was carried out on a Builder PCA-1200 apparatus with TCD. Typically, 50 mg of the sample was loaded in a quartz tube and pretreated in an Ar atmosphere at 600 °C for 1 h with a ramping rate of 10 °C min–1. Then, the sample was saturated with NH3 at 50 °C. Subsequently, the sample was treated with Ar at 120 °C for 30 min to purge physically adsorbed NH3. Finally, NH3 desorption was performed under an Ar atmosphere by heating the tube from 50 to 600 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C min–1. Pyridine Fourier transform infrared (pyridine FTIR) spectra were recorded on an EQUINOX-55 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker). The pyridine saturated sample was degassed in vacuum for 30 min at 150, 300, and 450 °C. FTIR analysis was performed at room temperature once the degassing process was done at each temperature. The fresh catalyst degassed at 150 °C for 30 min in vacuum was chosen as the background. HAADF-STEM images were obtained on a JEOL-ARM200F FETEM with an electron acceleration energy of 200 kV.
Catalytic Performance Evaluation
Direct PDH was conducted in a fixed-bed reactor equipped with a quartz tube (4 mm inner diameter, 33 cm length) under atmospheric pressure at 600 °C. 200 mg of the catalyst with a particle size of 20 to 40 meshes was loaded inside the quartz tube (bed height: 34 mm). Before reaction, the catalyst was prereduced with 20% H2 in an inert gas (35 mL min–1) at 600 °C for 1 h. Then, 20% propane with 31% N2 as an internal standard in Ar was fed at a gas rate of 35 mL min–1, and the weight hourly space velocity was 3.8 h–1. The products were analyzed using an online gas chromatography system (GC 9790II) equipped with a PPQ column with a 5 Å molecule column and a TCD. The propane conversion and propylene selectivity were calculated using the following formulas

i: the different hydrocarbon products in the production gas; ni: the number of carbon atoms of each component i; Fi: the corresponding flow rate.
Carbon balance was calculated using the following formula:
(3)
i: the different hydrocarbon products in the production gas; ni: the number of carbon atoms of each component i; Fi: the corresponding flow rate.
The TOF was tested at a propane conversion below 10%. To get a lower propane conversion, the amount of the catalyst was reduced. For 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen, 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–OA, and 0.5VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA, 0.1 g of the sample with a corresponding bed height of 17 mm was used. For the reference sample, 0.02 g of 1.5VOx-poly/Al2O3–salen or 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA diluted with quartz sand to get a bed height of 17 mm was used. In this way, the volumetric space velocity over two samples is the same. After the sample was pretreated with 20% H2 in the inert gas at 600 °C for 1 h, the test was performed under the following conditions: 20% C3H8 (35 mL min–1) and 600 °C for 0.5 h. Also, the TOF was calculated using the following formula:
(4)
Conv. (%): conversion of propane, %; [FC3H8]in: the inlet flow rate of propane per second, L/s; nV: the amount of V atoms on the catalyst, mol.
Kinetic Study
The kinetic study of PDH was carried out in a fixed-bed reactor equipped with a quartz tube under atmospheric pressure at 600 °C. The effect of internal and external diffusion was eliminated under reaction conditions. First, 100 mg of 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen (bed height: 17 mm) or 20 mg of 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA (diluted with quartz sand, bed height: 17 mm) with a particle size of 20 to 40 meshes was loaded and prereduced at 600 °C for 1 h with 20% H2 in Ar. Then, the mixture gas with 20% propane in Ar and N2 (internal standard) was fed at a rate of 35 mL min–1. After the reaction was performed for 0.5 h at 600 °C, the propane conversion was detected by GC (no more than 10%). The reaction rate (r) was molecules of conversed propane per vanadium atoms per second. The Arrhenius plot was obtained by plotting ln r as a function of 1/T. The pre-exponential factor (A) and apparent activation barrier (Ea) for PDH were achieved with the slope and intercept of the Arrhenius plot.
Recycle Test
The spent catalyst was first regenerated at 600 °C with a ramping rate of 2 °C min–1 under an air atmosphere for 2 h. Then, the regenerated sample was evaluated as the procedure in the catalytic performance evaluation section.
Results and Discussion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The preparation procedure of the samples is briefly illustrated in Figure 1a. For the salen-assisted synthesized isolated dispersed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst, the precursor salen–V complex was mixed with the powdered Al2O3 in ethanol solution. Then, the powder was recovered by rotary evaporation and carbonized under a N2 atmosphere. The in situ formed carbons from the salen–V complex ensure high dispersion of vanadium species by restraining the polymerization of vanadate under pyrolysis conditions. The carbon is subsequently removed by calcination under an air atmosphere. To ensure the isolated dispersion of VOx sites supported on Al2O3, the obtained sample was subjected to alkali leaching to eliminate the dimer or polyvanadate species. Finally, the vanadium catalyst with isolated VOx sites on the Al2O3 support was obtained and denoted as 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen (0.5 wt % V, ICP). The HAADF-STEM and Raman results demonstrate the efficiency of alkali leaching for the preparation of single VOx sites. For comparison, according to former research, (20) OA was used in the place of salen for the preparation of reference samples. The procedure is the same as that for 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen except that salen was replaced with OA (as shown in Figure 1a). The obtained isolated VOx catalyst was denoted as 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–OA, while the polyvanadate samples were denoted as 0.5VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA and 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA, according to the V loading determined by ICP.

To investigate the chemical and textural properties, the as-prepared samples were characterized in detail. N2 adsorption–desorption tests show indistinctive difference between the Al2O3 support and the as-prepared V/Al2O3 samples (Figure S1 and Table S1). The slight change concerning the pore volume (Vtotal and VBJH) of vanadium-supported samples compared to parent Al2O3 may due to second calcination at high temperature. XRD patterns (Figure S2) display only the characteristic diffraction peaks of γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS card 10-0425) without crystalline V2O5, suggesting that the vanadium oxide species were well dispersed on the surface of the support. Raman spectroscopy is a powerful technology for the characterization of vanadium species. Figure 1b displays the visible (532 nm) Raman spectra of the developed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen and the reference catalysts. The spectra display no signal assigned to crystalline V2O5 at 994 cm–1, suggesting the absence of crystalline V2O5. This is consistent with the XRD results, further highlighting the well-dispersed vanadium species on the support surface. Moreover, the UV (325 nm) Raman spectra (Figure 1c) of 1.5VOx-poly/Al2O3–salen, 0.5VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA, and 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA feature the V–O–V characterization band located at 500 cm–1, undoubtedly demonstrating the polyvanadate (V–O–V) on these samples. (20) In contrast, the developed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen prepared with the V–salen precursor and the alkali-leached 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–OA display no V–O–V signal, and only the band at 900 cm–1 assigned to V–O–Al is observed, (20) indicating the isolated dispersion of VOx species on the Al2O3 surface. The aforementioned results demonstrate that alkali leaching is efficient for the preparation of isolated VOx species on the Al2O3 support.
HAADF-STEM images (Figures 2a,b and S3) show no vanadium aggregates on the developed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst. The element mapping also shows the uniform distribution of V atoms on the Al2O3 support surface (Figure 2a). The V content in the imaged region is 0.64 wt % (the EDS spectrum is provided in Figure S4), which is similar to the ICP results of 0.5 wt %. The similar data further prove the uniform distribution of V atoms on Al2O3. The survey XPS spectrum of 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen displays that only V, Al, O, and C elements exist on the catalyst (Figure S5). To prove the existence of atomically dispersed V sites, the atomically scaled HAADF-STEM images show the isolated vanadium atoms identified as bright spots (highlighted by green circles, Figure 2b). In contrast, the polyvanadate sample 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA catalyst presents a high surface density observed by elemental mapping (Figure 2c), and the vanadium species are in the form of aggregates (Figure 2d, marked with yellow circles, Figure S3b). The V content from the EDS spectrum is 4.56 wt % (Figure S4b), in accord with the ICP results. The UV Raman spectrum (Figure 1c) has proved the polyvanadate on the 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA catalyst. Meanwhile, the surface vanadium density of 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA is 2.5 V atom nm–2, corresponding to the polyvanadate species (1.2–4.4 V atom nm–2) shown in the previous report. (20,34,35) For the developed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst, the UV Raman spectrum (Figure 1b) shows the absence of V–O–V bonds (500 cm–1). Only a signal located at 900 cm–1 assigned to V–O–Al bonds can be detected, indicating the isolated VOx species on the 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst.

(d) HAADF-STEM image of the polyvanadate 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA catalyst.
To investigate the electronic states of V species in the as-prepared catalysts, XPS analyses were conducted (Figure 3). The binding energies of 517.6, 516.6, and 515.7 eV were assigned to V5+, V4+, and V3+ species, respectively, and the fraction of each oxidation valence can be obtained by peak deconvolution of the high-resolution V2p XPS spectrum. The results (Figure 3 and Table S2) demonstrate a mixture of the V oxidation state on the catalysts, which is consistent with earlier reports. (36,37) Specifically, for the fresh samples without H2 reduction, the samples prepared with OA assistance only possess V4+ and V5+ species (Figure 3a–c, entries 1–3 in Table S2), while the synthesized 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen by a salen-assisted method possesses a high fraction of V3+ species (Figure 3d, entry 4 in Table S2), indicating that the salen-assisted synthesized 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen sample is much different from the traditional OA-assisted synthesized samples. During the fabrication of 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen, the in situ formed carbon species from V–salen may play the role of a reductant in the calcination process, while OA is easy to evaporate. Thus, the V5+ species are much more readily reduced to a lower valence (V3+ and V4+).

Non-oxidative catalytic dehydrogenation of propane over metal catalysts is often carried out with additional H2 in the feed gas to mitigate catalyst deactivation. The development of a highly stable catalyst for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane without H2 in the feed gas is of great significance but remains a challenge. A recent report proposed a favorable pathway concerning non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene over single-site V atoms by DFT calculations. (30) It figured out that propylene is the most favorable product over the single-site V catalyst. According to the former studies, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is probably initially activated by the path of CH3CH2CH3* → CH3CHCH3* + H* and then undergoes the CH3CHCH3* + H* → CH3CH═CH2* + H2 path, and propylene can be finally formed by desorption. Thus, our developed isolated dispersed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst was applied in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with 20% C3H8/Ar at 600 °C.
The catalytic results are presented in Figure 4, and the carbon balance and H2/propylene ratio are shown in Figure S6. Owing to the trace coke formation per unit time on the sample, the carbon balance calculation did not include the coke species. Moreover, no COx species are detected in our system. For a logical comparison, the Al2O3 support was first evaluated in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Unsurprisingly, the Al2O3 support shows poor performance (Figure S8). Further, the catalytic stability of as-prepared catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane was evaluated, and the results are shown in Figure 4a. As shown, the developed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen with isolated VOx sites exhibits unexpectedly high catalytic stability with no apparent deactivation, while the 1.5VOx-poly/Al2O3–salen catalyst shows very rapid deactivation in propane conversion from 23.1 to 13.2% after 11 h of TOS. The surprising catalytic stability is also superior to that reported for the Pt–Sn bimetallic catalyst for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in a H2 atmosphere (Table S3). (38−40) Moreover, the OA-assisted synthesized 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA shows more deteriorative stability, in which the propane conversion decreased from 29.1 to 3.9% after 11 h of TOS. Meanwhile, 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen and 1.5VOx-poly/Al2O3–salen show very stable propylene selectivity (Figures 4a and S7a), while 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA shows a decrease in propylene selectivity (96.3 to 89.4%) with the formation of C2 species as a function of TOS (Figures 4a and S7b). Furthermore, samples with low V loading prepared by the OA-assisted method, 0.5VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA and 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–OA, were also applied in propane non-oxidative dehydrogenation. It gives stable propane conversion and propylene selectivity; however, the activity is very poor. The catalytic evaluation results indicate that the stability is not only dependent on the VOx species but also effected by the V loading. A low V loading is good for the improvement of PDH stability approximately owing to the decrease in active site density. Regeneration evaluations (Figure 4b) demonstrate the fine regenerability of as-prepared catalysts. However, the stability of 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA is still poor. In contrast, the isolated 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst exhibits high catalytic stability in four cycles, demonstrating its excellent durability for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Moreover, by adjusting the reaction conditions, higher propane conversion with high propylene selectivity and catalytic stability can be obtained (Figure S9). This result further confirms the great potential for industrial applications.

(c) Comparison of initial TOF and selectivity over the as-prepared catalysts. (d) Arrhenius plot of as-prepared catalysts. (d) Recyclability of as-prepared catalysts for direct PDH.
The initial TOFs of as-prepared samples were calculated for comparison (Figure 4c). Referring to a former report, the V atoms are deemed to be fully exposed to reactants and serve as active sites. (20) As shown in Figure 4c, the 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen prepared by the salen-assisted method shows the highest TOF value, which is 4.0 times that of the 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–OA catalyst under the same conditions at a similar propane conversion level, ascribed to the readily reduced V5+ to low-valance V3+ and V4+.
The developed single-site 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst also shows a much higher TOF than the previously reported single-site metallic catalyst for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (Table S3), demonstrating high activity of the newly developed isolated 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst for propylene production from non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Furthermore, the TOF value of 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–OA is lower than those of 0.5VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA and 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA, which is consistent with the former report. (20) However, the developed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen prepared with salen is much higher than 1.5VOx-poly/Al2O3–salen. This different trend concerning TOF variation demonstrates that the intrinsic properties of the salen-assisted synthesized sample are different from those of the OA-assisted synthesized sample. Owing to the higher TOF value of 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA than the other two samples prepared by the OA-assisted method, it was chosen as the reference sample for comparison to investigate the intrinsic properties.
To clarify the origin of the unexpected high intrinsic activity over isolated dispersed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen, the apparent reaction order (α) and apparent activation energy (Ea) were measured at a low conversion (less than 20%, Figure 4d, Table S4, and Figure S9). It should be mentioned that the mass-transfer limitation has been excluded (Table S5). The α over 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen and 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA are similar (0.6 vs 0.6). However, the Ea over 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen is much lower than that over 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA (140 kJ mol–1 vs 198 kJ mol–1) for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. An early report claimed a lower TOF with a higher Ea for monovanadate compared with polyvanadate species because of the ultralow fraction of V3+ species, which have been considered to be the dominating active sites for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. (20) In contrast, our 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst with isolated VOx sites in this work features a lower Ea for direct PDH than 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA, indicating the unique intrinsic properties of our 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst.
The H2-reduced 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen and 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA samples were characterized by XPS, and the results are shown in Figure 5a,b and Table S2. The results show that the fraction of V5+ species decreased after H2 reduced. For the developed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen, the fraction of V5+ decreased from 44 to 24%. However, for 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA, the fraction of V5+ species shows a less decrease (from 67 to 52%). The aforementioned comparison implies the more ready reducibility of 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen, which is also proved by H2-TPR profiles (Figure 5c). Moreover, the H2-reduced 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen possesses a larger fraction of V3+ and V4+ species than the H2-reduced 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA. As V3+ and V4+ species are deemed as the active species for dehydrogenation reactions, a larger content of these species endues 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen good catalytic performance.

V3+ species are reported to be the active sites not only for propane non-oxidative dehydrogenation but also for coke formation. (20) To further explore the coke-resistance ability of our developed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst, we replaced H2 with propane in the prereduction process as Vδ+ species can be deeply reduced to V3+ by propane. (18) Typically, the reaction gas (20% C3H8/Ar) was introduced to the sample tube at the beginning. After the catalyst was reduced by propane at 600 °C for 1 h, the product gas was analyzed (Figure S11). The reference polyvanadate 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA catalyst with V–O–V bonds shows a deteriorative decrease in propane conversion in a short period of reaction time, which is consistent with an early report. (18,20) In contrast, the developed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst in this work undoubtedly features fine catalytic stability. This result further shows excellent coke resistance of our developed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst, and the isolated surface VOx sites of the 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst are also unambiguously different from the reported monomeric VOx catalyst prepared by the OA-assisted method. (20)
Further characterization was performed to shed light on the correlation between the catalyst property and the performance for the isolated dispersed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane without H2. Coke deposition is a major cause of catalyst deactivation for non-oxidative dehydrogenation. Hence, the amount, type, and location of the coke formed on catalysts were investigated. TGA and derivative thermogravimetry (DTG) (Figures 5d and S12a) curves demonstrate less coke deposition on the isolated dispersed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen-spent than on the reference 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA-spent (36 vs 156 mg gcat–1). Visible Raman spectra (Figure S12b) depict that the intensity ratios of D/G bands of the developed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen-spent sample are smaller than those of 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA-spent (ID/IG = 0.65 vs 0.86), suggesting that the coke on the former is much more amorphous. (41,42) As the coke formation is affected by the surface acid properties of catalysts, (43) NH3-TPD and pyridine FTIR were conducted (Figure S13 and Table S6). The results clearly show that the fresh polyvanadate 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA features the highest surface acid content (Figure S13a) and Brönsted acid sites compared with fresh isolated dispersed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen and the Al2O3 support (Figure S13b–d). Obviously, the heavy coke deposition could occur on polyvanadate 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA due to the large amount of strong B acidic sites. Concerning spent catalysts, the surface acid content on spent 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA-spent is only 32% of the fresh catalyst (NH3 uptake: 24 vs 76 mmol gcat–1) (Table S6 and Figure S13a). Interestingly, the total surface acidity on the isolated dispersed catalyst shows almost no change after reaction (Table S6 and Figure S13a). This observation implies that the active sites on isolated 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen are still exposed after reaction, although there is slight coke deposition (3.6%), while the active sites on 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA are covered by the large amount of deposited coke (15.6%). The aforementioned results demonstrate the strong coke resistance of isolated dispersed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen, which accounts for its unexpected experimental performance that there is almost no deactivation during 11 h non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, whereas a rapid deactivation was observed for the polyvanadate 4.8VOx-poly/Al2O3–OA catalyst.
Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In summary, we have presented a salen-assisted strategy for the preparation of the unique single-site 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst featuring the isolated VOx species on commercially available Al2O3. The isolated VOx sites are confirmed by HAADF-STEM and Raman spectra. Interestingly, the isolated 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst is more readily reduced to low-valance V3+ and V4+ than the traditional supported VOx catalyst prepared with OA and thus displays the highest TOF value for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane among the as-prepared samples. Moreover, the developed 0.5VOx-iso/Al2O3–salen catalyst is more stable than the polymerized V–O–V sample for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (without extra introduction of H2) owing to its high coke-resistance ability. This work not only presents a great potential alternative to noble metal catalysts for practical applications in propylene production from non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane but also presents some guidance for designing other highly efficient catalysts.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
