Kinetic study of propane dehydrogenation and catalyst deactivation over Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095495613600960

AbstractAbstract
The kinetics of propane dehydrogenation and catalyst deactivation over Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst were studied. Performance test runs were carried out in a fixed-bed integral reactor. Using a power-law rate expression for the surface reaction kinetics and independent law for deactivation kinetics, the experimental data were analyzed both by integral and a novel differential method of analysis and the results were compared. To avoid fluctuation of time-derivatives of conversion required for differential analysis, the conversion-time data were first fitted with appropriate functions. While the time-zero and rate constant of reaction were largely insensitive to the function employed, the rate constant of deactivation was much more sensitive to the function form. The advantage of the proposed differential method, however, is that the integration of the rate expression is not necessary which otherwise could be complicated or impossible. It was also found that the reaction is not limited by external and internal mass transfer limitations, implying that the employed kinetics could be considered as intrinsic ones.

1. Introduction
Propylene is the building block for many important petrochemicals such as polypropylene and acrylonitrile. Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is much sought as a complementary supply to the conventional processes such as steam cracking or FCC units to satisfy the growing demand [1]:
(1)
The reaction is reversible, endothermic and accompanied by volume expansion. Therefore, higher temperatures and lower pressures shift it to completion. Higher temperatures, on the other hand, promote side reactions, coke formation and catalyst deactivation.
Commercially, chromia and platinum-based catalysts are used for dehydrogenation of light alkanes [2, 3, 4, 5]. Platinum exhibits a good activity in the dehydrogenation of paraffins, but the olefin yield is poor because the platinum particles catalyze C–C bond rupture as well. Platinum-based catalysts are often promoted with tin and alkali metals (mostly potassium) to increase the selectivity and lifetime. Incorporation of tin into platinum-based catalysts has a positive effect on the selectivity toward dehydrogenation, at the expense of the hydrogenolysis reactions [6, 7, 8]. The acidity of the support is suppressed by the addition of an alkaline metal [7,8].
Due to thermodynamic limitations, dehydrogenation of light alkanes is operated at temperatures around 600 °C to achieve reasonable commercial yields. Under these conditions, catalyst deactivation is rapid and frequent catalyst regeneration is necessary [9]. Some technologies operate under vacuum or in the presence of diluents such as steam or even hydrogen to lower alkane partial pressure and to shift the reaction to olefin formation. The utilization of a coke removing diluent inhibits coke formation and catalyst deactivation as well [10,11]. The UOP Oleflex process [12], for example, employs Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst in 3 to 4 adiabatic moving-bed reactors in series. Hydrogen is used as the diluent and the catalyst is continuously regenerated by coke burning followed by Pt re-dispersion.
Consequently, despite the simple chemistry, dehydrogenation processes are very complicated. The availability of reliable kinetic models for the reactions and catalyst deactivation are, therefore, essential. First-order power-law kinetic models for the main reaction [13, 14, 15] and independent decay laws for catalyst deactivation [14,16] have been commonly proposed. Other kinetics can be approximated by power-law kinetics at high temperatures and low pressures [17], which are typical of dehydrogenation reactions.
In this work, the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation and that of catalyst deactivation over Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst are studied. The kinetics associated with propane dehydrogenation and catalyst deactivation are then examined and analyzed. A novel method based on differential analysis of integral reactor data is introduced and the results are also compared with those of the integral method of analysis. The influence of external and internal mass transfer limitations was also studied.
2. Experimental
Commercial Pt-Sn/Al2O3 dehydrogenation catalyst was provided by a European company, the characteristics of which are reported elsewhere [18]. The catalyst performance tests were carried out in a fixed-bed quartz reactor (ID = 15 mm) using a mixture of propane and hydrogen as the feed under atmospheric pressure. For each run, 1.5 g of the catalyst was loaded. The reactor effluent was analyzed for C1–C3 hydrocarbons by an online gas chromatograph (RGA Agilent 6890N), with TCD and FID detectors using 3 ft HayeSep Q 80/100, 8 ft HayeSep N 80/100 and 10 ft molecular sieve 13×45/60 columns for permanent gases, 4 foot HayeSep Q+10 ft molecular sieve 13×45/60 columns for hydrogen and a 50 m, 0.53 mm, 15 μm alumina/Na2SO4 PLOT column for hydrocarbons. Test conditions were specified according to typical conditions of commercial plants, as given in Table 1. A long-term test run was also conducted to study deactivation kinetics.

Higher level 620 1.0 2.2
3. Kinetic modeling and analysis
Dehydrogenation reaction is practiced at relatively high temperatures and low pressures due to thermodynamic and kinetic considerations. Under such conditions, the site coverage is low and power-law expressions could be used for the forward and reverse reactions [17]. As a consequence, the following rate expression can be used for the rate of dehydrogenation reaction [13, 14, 15]:
(2)
where, A and B represent the paraffin and olefin, respectively. −r′A is the rate of reaction per unit mass of catalyst, k1 is the rate constant, Keq is the equilibrium constant and C is the concentration. The time-dependent catalyst activity, a, is defined as [17]:
(3)
For an independent first-order decay law:
(4)
where, kd is the deactivation rate constant. Equation 2 can be written in terms of propane conversion, XA, as:
(5)
ɛ
in which
(6)
(7)
ɛ
ɛ
where, H is hydrogen/propane molar ratio in the feed, XAe is the equilibrium conversion and ɛA is the volume expansion factor. The function f stands for the functionality of the rate on reacting species concentrations. From a propane mole balance on the axial element within the reactor bed:
(8)
where, FA0 is the molar flow rate of propane in the feed and W is the mass of catalyst. Integration of Equation 8, using Equation 5 for the rate, following algebraic manipulations gives [14]:
(9)
ɛ
ɛ
ɛ
where, XA,out is propane conversion at reactor effluent; τ′, the ratio of catalyst weight per volumetric feed flow rate, is the weight-time. Equation 9 provides a basis for integral analysis of reactor data, a plot of which (right-hand-side, RHS, versus time-on-stream) should result in a straight line with the intercept giving k1 and the slope giving kd.
Alternatively, upon integrating Equation 8, one obtains
(10)
For a catalyst deactivating with time-on-stream, combining (4), (10) results in:
(11)
Differentiating with respect to time, using the chain rule, and taking logarithm of both sides yields:
(12)
A plot of Equation 12 should result in straight lines with the intercept and slope giving rate constants of the main reaction and deactivation, respectively. The interested reader can verify Equation 12 by differentiating the integral form (Equation 9) with respect to time.
Implicit in the above derivations is isothermal reactor assumption, which is well approximated in lab-scale microreactors, and also pseudo-steady state assumption for a reactor operating with a deactivating catalyst, which is the case in sufficiently slow catalyst deactivation.
The occurrence of mass transfer limitation depends on the relative rates of transport around and within catalyst particles to that of surface kinetics, as reflected in the Mears (CM) and Weisz-Prater (CWP) numbers for external and internal limitations, respectively [17]:
(13)
(14)
where, ρb is the bulk density of catalyst bed, ρb = (1–ϕb)ρc, (ϕb: bed porosity), ρc is density of catalyst pellet, dp is catalyst particle diameter, n is reaction order, kc is mass transfer coefficient, De is effective diffusivity and CAb and CAs are the bulk and surface concentrations, respectively. Internal mass transfer effects can be characterized by Thiele modulus and effectiveness factor as well [17].
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Performance test results
Figure 1 shows the effect of operating temperature on propane conversion, as well as propylene selectivity and yield. The propane conversion is close to and parallel to the equilibrium conversion. As the reaction is highly endothermic, an increase in temperature enhances the conversion of propane due to both kinetic and thermodynamic factors. However, higher temperatures could promote noncatalytic gas-phase reactions which enhance side reactions such as propane cracking and coke formation.

Figure 2 illustrates the influence of H2/HC molar ratio in the feed on the performance of the catalyst. The propane conversion decreased with increasing H2/HC ratio. An increase in partial pressure of hydrogen would not only decrease the thermodynamic driving force of the reaction, but also kinetically reduce the rate of dehydrogenation reaction due to the competition of hydrogen with propane for platinum active sites [4]. Furthermore, higher hydrogen concentrations in the feed enhance the hydrogenolysis side reaction, as reflected by the decreasing of propylene selectivity with increasing hydrogen concentration. However, too low levels of H2/HC ratios are not desirable due to accelerating catalyst deactivation by coke formation.

Figure 3 shows the effect of space velocity on propane conversion and propylene selectivity. The conversion of propane remains rather unaffected, which could be attributed to thermodynamic limitation of the reaction. Therefore, these data, though representative of commercial plants, are of little application for kinetic study as the kinetics is masked by equilibrium. However, upon catalyst deactivation, the reaction shifts from a thermodynamic controlled regime to a kinetic controlled one. The rate of conversion decline by deactivation can be used to find the deactivation rate constant as outlined in the previous section.

Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 also illustrate that the catalyst exhibits high propylene selectivities (⩾ 85%) over the rather wide range of operating conditions tested. As a consequence, the rate and conversion of propane to propylene are well approximated by those of overall reactions.
Figure 4 shows the effect of time-on-stream on propane conversion. The observed rapid catalyst deactivation mainly caused by coke deposition is typical for dehydrogenation catalysts. The fluctuation of data point can cause large errors in numerical time-derivative calculations required for differential analysis. This can be reduced using an appropriate fitting function. When differentiation of successive experimental data point is under consideration, to avoid fluctuation effects, they are first fitted and then the differentials are evaluated from the fitted curve [19]. For the case of the present experimental data, an exponential function showed satisfactory fit (Figure 4). The resulting time-zero conversion of 0.496 is close to the equilibrium conversion of propane, implying a thermodynamically controlled regime on the fresh catalyst.

Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show plots of (9), (12), respectively, both of which are reasonably straight lines, confirming the applicability of the kinetic expressions employed for the main reaction and catalyst decay. Figure 5(b) is constructed based on the exponential function fit derivatives. The fluctuations of the original experimental data are smoothened as derivative values were evaluated indirectly from the fitting function.

Figure 6 shows the parity plots for propane conversion using the kinetic parameters obtained by integral method and those by differential method using the exponential fit. As it can be seen, the difference between experimental results and model estimations is predominantly within 20%, which confirms the accuracy of the results. The results of the integral method are closer to experimental data, especially for longer times on-stream. The differential method results approach to those of integral method as the time approaches zero which can be explained by thermodynamic limitation of the system on fresh catalyst as noted above. However, differential method results in under-estimation of conversion after long times on-stream which is attributed to the larger resulting deactivation rate constant (Table 2). Nevertheless, even the elementary exponential function gives fair results which can be improved by using more appropriate fitting functions.

Differential (linear) 46.1 7.6 0.015
Differential (quadratic) 49.6 7.8 0.028

For the sake of comparison, other fitting functions such as linear and quadratic equations were also evaluated. Table 2 shows the kinetic parameters obtained from integral analysis and differential analysis using different fitting functions. The tabulated values are reasonably close and consistent. One surprisingly observes that the linear fit gave the best and closest results to the integral method, although it is obviously not a fair fit for long-term conversion versus time data.
It is noteworthy that the accuracy of the differential method results depends on the fitting function, which should fit both propane conversion and its time-derivative with time-on-stream accurately. The fitting functions, however, are often designed to serve only for the former. As a consequence, the time-zero conversion and rate constant of the reaction are not very sensitive to the fitting function as can be seen in Table 2. The magnitude of these parameters is largely governed by early time-on-stream conversion levels which depend on the goodness of the fitting of conversion data points. In contrast, the rate constant of deactivation is much more strongly dependent on the fitting function type. This could be explained by the fact that this parameter depends on the long-term trend of time-derivatives of conversion data with time, which might not be necessarily well fitted by the derivative of a particular function optimized for fitting data points themselves. In the case of the aforementioned system, it could be concluded that a fitting function with low upward curvature should give the best results.
The pseudo-steady assumption could be verified by noting that deactivation rate was sufficiently slow to allow near-steady state conditions at any instant of time. The characteristic time for catalyst stability (say, 1/0.017 h−1 ≈ 2×105 s), for example, was much longer than the residence time within the reactor (∼1 s).
4.3. Mass transfer limitations
The observed order and the magnitude of parameters of the kinetic models could be influenced by mass transfer limitation effects [17,19]. Consequently, analysis of mass transfer limitations is critical in kinetic modeling of heterogonous catalyst systems. Mass transfer analyses are commonly performed prior to kinetic study, especially when intrinsic kinetics is sought, by changing parameters affecting mass transfer such as pellet size and flow rate, and observing the effect on conversion [20]. Alternatively, it can be performed after preliminary kinetic study by an iterative procedure using quantitative criteria. The later approach allows more precise analysis in the light of estimated kinetic data.
Equation 2 can be re-written as
(15)
where, η is the approach to equilibrium. As the reactor products are close to equilibrium in the case of fresh catalyst (that is, η ∼ 1), the highest reaction rate, and mass transfer limitation, is to be found in the reactor inlet where η is close to zero and the rate expression reduces to a first-order irreversible one.
The transport parameters can be estimated from the appropriate correlations in the literature under the operating conditions [21]. The diffusion coefficient, for example, can be obtained from the kinetic theory and Lennard-Jones expressions for intermolecular forces [22]. The external mass transfer coefficient can be estimated by appropriate correlation for packed-beds [21]:

in which u is the superficial velocity, ν kinematic viscosity and DAF is the diffusivity of propane in feed mixture. The latter was approximated by molar-average of diffusivity of propane in propane and that of propane in hydrogen, which is reasonable for a gaseous mixture. Table 3 shows typical data employed to calculate the mass transfer parameters under reactor inlet conditions of Figure 4.

Table 4 shows the calculated parameters. From the tabulated results one obtains CM<0.15 and CWP<<1, showing that both external and internal mass transfer limitations were not significant. Because of low external mass transfer limitation, CAs is nearly the same as CAb, and the latter was used for calculating CWP by Equation 14. Alternatively, the Thiele modulus and effectiveness factor were 0.12 and 0.992, respectively, confirming that internal diffusion limitation was virtually absent. Similar results have been obtained by other workers under different operating conditions [23]. As a consequence, the kinetic model and associated kinetic parameters obtained in this work could be considered as intrinsic ones.

Higher temperatures can induce mass transfer limitations due to rapid increase of surface reaction rates. However, 620 °C used in this study is close to the upper temperature limit of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 type catalysts applicability. Higher temperatures increase side reactions, accelerate Pt sintering and support phase-transformation, and therefore, are unlikely to be encountered in practice.
5. Conclusions
The performance data of an integral reactor can be used to study the kinetics and to obtain the kinetic parameters using differential method of analysis. This method was used for propane dehydrogenation and it was found that a power law-based rate expression for the surface reaction kinetics and independent deactivation kinetics result in fair fits both for this method and conventional integral method of analysis. Both methods were used to obtain the rate constants. The advantage of the method introduced in this work is that it by pass the integration of the rate expression for integral method of analysis which could be very time-consuming or impossible for complex rate expressions. Similar advantage is offered compared to the alternative non-linear regression method which needs parameter estimation and solving the model equations.
The analysis of mass transfer effects showed that the reaction is not limited by external and internal transfer limitations, and consequently the kinetic models and their corresponding parameters could be considered as intrinsic ones.
