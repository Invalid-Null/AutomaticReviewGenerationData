 Based on the supplied document, it does not appear to discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The document focuses on thermal and catalytic cracking of crude oils to produce light olefins like ethylene and propylene. It does not mention conversion of propane to propylene. Therefore, I cannot extract the requested information about any catalyst utilized for propane dehydrogenation.
