1. Introduction
Many petroleum refiners worldwide are focusing into revamping their operations to co-produce petrochemical feedstocks (light olefins and aromatics) due to the anticipated decline in the demand for refined products (mainly transportation fuels). The conversion of whole crude oil directly to petrochemicals or the integration of petrochemical plants and refinery consistently showed a greater profitability than the corresponding stand-alone refineries [1,2]. The direct crude oil conversion requires extensive investment in catalytic cracking and hydrocracking operations to increase the production of light olefins and BTX aromatics. During the last two decades, the global demand for refined products has increased by 1.3% annually compared with about 3.5% for basic petrochemicals [2]. Petrochemicals are fastest-growing source of global crude oil demand growth. In 2018, the production of basic petrochemicals accounted for 14.0 million barrels per day (bpd) of global crude oil demand and is forecasted to increase to 20.0 million bpd by 2050 or about 50% of the expected oil demand growth [3].
Light olefins (mainly ethylene and propylene) and aromatics (benzene and paraxylene) are the largest-volume basic petrochemicals used in the production of polymers and other packaging materials such as ethylbenzene (for styrene), acrylonitrile, oxides of ethylene and propylene, ethylene dichloride, cumene, acrylic acid, butyraldedyde and many others. The global demand estimate for ethylene and propylene is forecasted to reach 385 million tons in 2030 increasing from 270 million tons in 2018 [4]. Ethylene is mainly produced by naphtha steam cracking (SC) in addition to other feedstocks such as ethane, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and gas oils. Propylene is co-produced from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), naphtha steam cracking, naphtha steam catalytic cracking, methanol conversion to olefins, butenes metathesis, and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [[5], [6], [7]]. Enhanced production of propylene from FCC units has been achieved by modifications in operating conditions, new types of FCC catalysts and additives, process configuration, and recycling of naphtha [8,9]. The addition of modified ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst enhanced propylene production via the selective cracking of naphtha-range olefins [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14]]. In FCC-like processes that operate at high severity, the propylene yield has been enhanced to 20 wt.% compared with 3–6 wt.% in the conventional FCC process [15].
Converting whole crude directly and shale oils to petrochemical feedstocks has advantages in reducing the production cost of light olefins, as well as lowering energy consumption and carbon emissions [16,17]. Some oil and chemical companies have patented different configurations for the conversion of crude oil to petrochemicals, mainly olefins and aromatics [[18], [19], [20], [21]]. In 2014, ExxonMobil announced the first commercial steam cracking plant for light crude oil conversion to light olefins at its Singapore complex [17]. A huge crude-oil-to-chemicals project with a crude oil processing capacity of 20 million tpy was announced by SABIC and Saudi Aramco with startup in 2025. Corma et al. reviewed and investigated the crackability of crude oil to light olefins [1]. It was reported that thermal cracking of heavy fraction of AXL crude oil within the range of 560–640 °C was easier to crack than naphtha and middle distillate fractions [22].
Recently, we have explored catalytic and thermal cracking of several kinds of crude oils using Advanced Cracking Evaluation (ACE) unit, micro-activity test (MAT) unit, and CREC riser simulator reactor [[23], [24], [25], [26], [27]]. Investigations included the cracking of light crude oils with emphasis on Arabian Extra Light (AXL) and Arabian Super Light (ASL) crude oils [[23], [24], [25]]. While these studies have demonstrated the crackability of light crude oils, a more detailed investigation is required on the direct conversion (thermal and catalytic) of light crude oils to light olefins and naphtha at higher severity. The purpose of the present study is to investigate and compare the variances between catalytic and thermal cracking of three types of crude oils in terms of C2-C4 yields and naphtha composition using a microactivity test (MAT) unit. The tests were conducted at high severity with temperatures between 600 and 650 °C and catalyst-to-oil (C/O) ratios between 2–6. Catalytic cracking tests were conducted using a mixture of 70% equilibrium FCC catalyst (E-Cat) and 30% commercial ZSM-5 (MFI) additive at 650 °C and three C/O ratios of 2, 4, and 6. The product distribution, especially ethylene, propylene and naphtha, exhibited an excellent potential for the direct conversion of whole crude oils to high-value basic chemicals without the need for expensive distillation operations.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
E-Cat (equilibrium catalyst) and commercial ZSM-5 additive were acquired from a regional FCC unit. The calcination of E-Cat was conducted at 540 °C in air for 4 h to obtain a free-coke sample according to ASTM test method D-3907. Fresh ZSM-5 additive was steamed for 6 h at 810 °C. E-Cat containing additive was prepared by blending 70 wt. % of E-Cat and 30 wt. % of ZSM-5 additive [27]. The content of ZSM-5 in the blended E-Cat/ZSM-5 catalyst was based on the total weight percent of ZSM-5 additive and not the ZSM-5 zeolite content. Crude oil samples, Arabian Light (AL), Extra Light (AXL), and Super Light (ASL), were obtained from a domestic refinery.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Silica-to-alumina ratio of catalyst samples was measured by ICP (Inductive Coupled Plasma) spectrometer acquired from Horiba Scientific. Surface area and textural properties of catalyst samples were characterized via Micromeritics ASAP 2020 Plus adsorption analyzer. Degasification was performed to catalyst samples prior to nitrogen adsorption process. Adsorption data for samples of 100 mg of catalysts were used to measure the specific surface area. N2 cross-sectional area was used as 0.164 nm2 and the relative pressure (P/Po) was ranged from 0.06 to 0.3.
Ammonia temperature programmed desorption was applied using Micromeritics Chemisorb 2750-MS. Catalysts were preheated under flow of helium for 2 h at a temperature of 300 °C. Next, ammonia was adsorbed on samples at 100 °C for a time of 30 min. After that, a flow of helium was used to purge samples for 2 h at 120 °C to remove the physiosorbed NH3. The quantity of desorbed ammonia was measured by thermal conductivity detector (TCD) while catalyst samples were heated from 120 °C up to 700 °C under the flow of helium.
Shimadzu powder diffraction system with Cukα radiation (35 mA, 45Kv and λKα1 = 1.54051 Å) was used to record the XRD patterns of catalysts. The static scanning mode was used to record the XRD patterns from 5–60° (2θ) with step size of 0.02° and a 0.01°/s angular speed of the detector [28]. Scherrer’s equation was used to calculate the average size of crystallites (Eq. (1)):
(1)
Where Bc (2θ) is the peak width at the half of the height used after correction (by Warrens’s equation) of the experimental broadening:
(2)
Where Br and Be corresponds to the peak width at half the high for the silicon (standard material) and the analysed sample, respectively.
2.3. Cracking tests
Cracking tests of crude oils were conducted in a fixed-bed MAT unit which was constructed in Japan based on ASTM D-3907 method [27]. Catalytic cracking was assessed at two temperature levels, 600, and 650 °C, and thermal cracking tests were done at three temperature levels 600, 625, and 650 °C, with a 30 s time on stream. After feed injection, the liquid product and catalyst were stripped under flow of nitrogen for 11 min. The C/O ratio was varied between 2.0 and 6.0 by fixing feed’s quantity (1.0 g) and varying the catalyst amount (2, 4, and 6 g).
Agilent 3000A Micro-GC was used to analyze the gaseous product using four TCDs. Light hydrocarbons, nitrogen and hydrogen were quantified in one injection to the GC. Shimadzu GC 2010-plus with FID was used to analyze liquid product which comprised three different cuts, namely, heavy cycle oil (343+ ºC), light cycle oil (221–343 °C), and naphtha (C5-221 °C). A carbon-sulfur analyzer from Horiba was utilized to measure the amount of coke that is on spent catalyst. Based on gaseous and liquid analyses, a detailed distribution of product yields and conversion were calculated.
In this investigation, conversion was calculated as the combined yield of produced gases and coke. Several cracking performance indicators were applied such as hydrogen transfer coefficient (HTC) that is calculated as the ratio of butanes yield to butenes [29,30]. Another parameter was the ratio of dry gas divided by isobutane which is defined as cracking mechanism ratio. Also, the ratio of propylene to ethylene was calculated.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Feed and catalyst characterization
Distillation and physical properties of used crude oils are given in Table 1. Among the three crude oils, ASL has the lowest sulfur content (0.1 wt.%) followed by AXL (1.3 wt.%), and AL (1.7 wt.%). The API gravities were 51°, 39°, and 34° for ASL, AXL, and AL, respectively. The simulated distillation results showed that ASL had the highest naphtha content at 50 wt.% followed by AXL at 38 wt.% and AL at 35 wt.%. The paraffins, iso-paraffins, olefins, naphthenes and aromatics (PIONA) content of the naphtha fraction was : 46/18/0/9/27 wt.% for AL, 34/31/0/8/27 wt.% for AXL and 34/32/0/19/15 wt.% for ASL. ASL has the highest ratio of 343-°C/343+°C cuts at 3.8 and AL has the lowest ratio of 1.5. All three crude oils were of paraffinic nature that was proofed due to the K-Factor at 11.8, 12.0, and 12.6, for AL, AXL, and ASL, respectively.

Table 2 lists physical and chemical properties of E-Cat and ZSM-5. Pore diameter, pore volume, and surface area of E-Cat were higher than ZSM-5. Pore volume of ZSM-5 was calculated to be half of E-Cat. The SiO2/Al2O3 ratio for E-Cat was measured as 3.3 and for ZSM-5 was 5.6. The surface area for E-Cat and ZSM-5 were 157 and 126 m2/g, respectively.

The acidity of catalysts was studied by NH3-TPD. As shown in Table 2 the acidity of ZSM-5 was found to be 0.49 mmol/g and the acidity of E-Cat was nearly five times lower (0.09 mmol/g), but most of the acidity of ZSM-5 was in the weak to moderate region (below 450 °C) as illustrated in Fig. 1(B). The strong acidity of E-Cat and ZSM-5 was similar. Those differences in properties of catalysts will play a significant role in catalytic cracking of the crude oil.

Fig. 1 (A) presents the XRD patterns for E-Cat and ZSM-5 catalysts. In case of ZSM-5, a peak with high intensity at 21-24° (2 θ) with some other peaks at 6–10° showed ZSM-5 characteristic peaks. For E-Cat, the peak with the highest intensity was at 6.0° that is attributed to the existence of (1,1,1) crystal plane, other peaks at 27.2°, 23.7°, 20.3°, 18.6°, 15.5°, 11.8°, and 10.0° that are corresponding to (642), (533), (440), (333), (331), (311), and (220) crystal planes, respectively. These peaks for E-Cat show a typical XRD pattern for Y-zeolite reported in the literature [31].
3.2. Thermal cracking
The thermal cracking of AL, AXL, and ASL crude oils was studied at three temperatures, 600, 625, and 650 °C. Conversion was strongly influenced by reaction temperature (process severity). As shown in Fig. 2, the relationship between conversion and temperature is linear. At 600 °C, all crude oils (AL, AXL, ASL) had nearly similar conversion at 14.2, 14.0 and 14.5 wt.%, respectively. Above 600 °C, ASL and AXL had the same conversion, whereas AL had a higher conversion. At 650 °C, the corresponding conversions for ASL, AXL, and AL were: 27.6, 27.0, and 32.8 wt.%, respectively.

3.2.1. LPG and light olefins yields
C3-C4 paraffins and olefins (LPG) are mainly produced from the cracking of the reactive compounds in the crude oil that are within the naphtha-range hydrocarbons [32]. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the yields of LPG, propylene and ethylene, have linear relationship with temperature. The yield of propylene for ASL and AXL at all temperatures was similar. At 650 °C, LPG yields were 15.1 wt.% for ASL and 13.5 wt.% for AXL. AL crude oil exhibited a higher slope than ASL and AXL. At 600 °C, LPG yield for AL was 7.6 wt.% and at 650 °C, the yield sharply increased, in comparison to ASL and AXL, to 17.1 wt.%. The LPG olefinicity (LPG olefins/ LPG paraffins) for all crude oils increased with increasing temperature. Furthermore, as shown in Table 3, AXL crude oil showed the highest LPG olefinicity at all temperature levels.

From Table 3, the yields of ethylene at 600 °C increased in the order: ASL (2.6 wt.%) < AL (2.8 wt.%) < AXL (3.1 wt.%). However, increasing the temperature to 650 °C, the order changed as follows: ASL (6.1 wt.%) < AXL (6.5 wt.%) < AL (7.6 wt.%). Ethylene was formed by the free radical and beta-scission mechanisms. In more details, due to the high temperature, the cleavage of carbon-carbon bond uncharged molecules “free radicals” with an unpaired of electron are formed. Those free radicals are very reactive. They undergo beta-scission to produce primary free radicals and ethylene. More ethylene is produced since those newly formed primary free radicals will undergo beta-scission [10,24,33].
Propylene yields exhibited a similar trend to ethylene. The highest yield of propylene was achieved in the cracking of AL crude oil at 650 °C (8.6 wt.%) followed by almost a similar yield of ASL (6.8 wt.%) and AXL (6.9 wt.%). The yield of butenes increased at higher temperature with a trend similar to LPG yield. In all cases, butene-1 had the highest yield of butenes between 30–40% of total butenes.
The yields of ethylene/ethane (C2=/C2) and propylene/propane (C3=/C3) are shown in Table 3. For both ratios and for all crude oils, as the temperature increased, the selectivity towards olefins in comparison to paraffins increased. ASL crude oil exhibited the highest yield ratios of C2=/C2 and C3=/C3. At 650 °C, the C2=/C2 and C3=/C3 were 2.8 and 12.7, respectively. AL showed the lowest ratios at 650 °C with C2=/C2 at 2.4 and C3=/C3 at 9.7. In addition, the ratio of propylene/ethylene (P/E) was almost constant at 1.1.
3.2.2. Naphtha, LCO, and HCO yields
From Table 1, the content of naphtha in ASL, AXL, and AL feeds were 50, 38, 34 wt.%, respectively. The yields of product naphtha for the three crude oils are presented in Table 3 and plotted in Fig. 3. For all crude oils, naphtha yields increased to maxima 625 °C. This behaviour is explained since naphtha is considered as a reactant that cracks to light hydrocarbons and as product that is formed from the cracking of heavier cuts in the feed. At all temperatures, the yield of naphtha for ASL was the highest and for AL was the lowest due to the original amount of naphtha in the crude oil. At 650 °C, the yields of naphtha for ASL, AXL, and AL were 48, 38.1, and 34.4 wt.%, respectively.
ASL crude oil has the largest amount of LCO (29 wt.%) followed by AXL (27 wt.%) and AL at 26 wt.% as shown in Table 1. Fig. 3 shows how the increment in temperature resulted in decreasing LCO yields. From 600 to 625 °C, the drop in LCO was very sharp. Above 625 °C, the LCO yield was less steep for AL and nearly flat for ASL and AXL. The decrease in LCO yields was associated with an enrichment in yields of naphtha and light olefins. The largest drop in LCO compared with the feed was observed for thermal cracking of ASL crude oil which decreased from 29 to 16.9 wt.% at 650 °C.
The fractions boiling within HCO range in AL, AXL, and ASL feeds are presented Table 1 (39, 35, and 21 wt.%, respectively). Thermal cracking of all crude oils showed that the amount of HCO in the liquid product decreased with the increasing temperature due to over-cracking of heavy cuts into light hydrocarbons and coke. ASL crude oil cracking resulted in the lowest yield of HCO since the quantity in the feed was the lowest among all feeds. The unconverted HCO in the products at 650 °C was 14.7 wt.% for AL, 15.7 wt.% for AXL, and 7.5 wt.% for ASL. Fig. 4 shows feed composition and product distribution for thermal cracking for all crude oils at 650 °C.

3.2.3. Dry gas and coke yields
For the three crude oils, yields of dry gas (H2, C1-C2) maintained a linear relationship against temperature as illustrated in Fig. 3 with AL having the largest amount of dry gas at all temperatures (15.8 wt.% at 650 °C). In all experiments, about 50% of the dry gas yield was ethylene. Methane yield also increased with increase in temperature. Methane is produced by free radicals and alpha-scission mechanisms. The methyl radical is produced by the alpha-scission. This radical extract a hydrogen atom from any adjacent hydrocarbon which produce methane and another free radical. Alpha-scission occurred even though it is not thermodynamically favoured compared with beta-scission. That’s way the yield of ethylene is much higher than the yield of methane [27].
The CMR is the yield of dry gas divided by the yield of isobutane. The CMR increased by increasing temperature for all crude oils. The CMR for AL crude oil at 600, 625 and 650 °C were, 57.4, 95.0, and 103.4, respectively (Table 3). The increase in CMR over the increase in temperature indicates the influence of protolytic cracking compared with beta-scission and carbenium ion mechanisms [10,34].
Coke was produced because of the over-cracking of heavy hydrocarbons. As the percentage of heavy cuts increases, type of crude, or the severity (temperature) of the process increases the possibly of producing more coke increases which is illustrated in Fig. 3. AL crude oil, which contains a high amount of HCO compared with AXL and ASL, resulted in more coke formation followed by AXL and ASL crude oil.
3.3. Catalytic cracking
Catalytic cracking of crude oils was inspected at various C/O ratios (2–6) and temperatures (600 and 650 °C) over E-Cat/30% ZSM-5. Fig. 5 shows the effect of C/O ratio on conversion. Table 4, Table 5 present the products distribution of yields.

As shown in Fig. 5, the effect of C/O ratio on conversion is plotted. Generally, for the three crude oils conversion was enhanced as C/O ratio increased. In the C/O ratio range 2 to 4 the relationship between conversion and C/O ratio was nearly linear. The further rise in C/O ratio showed a slight increment in conversion. This performance is a standard one for catalytic cracking via the MAT unit that is described by higher impact on conversion at lower C/O ratios and it was confirmed by our previous research [23,27,35]. The difference in conversion for all crude oils at the same C/O ratio and temperature was not that significant. At C/O ratio of 4 and 600 °C, conversion for AL, AXL and ASL was 47.6, 44.9, and 45.6 wt.%, respectively. In addition, the temperature is a major contributor to the conversion. The conversion of AXL crude oil was enhanced from 35.8 wt.% at 600 °C up to 46.3 wt.% at the same C/O ratio of 2 as presented in Table 4, Table 5. The uppermost conversions were 59.9, 58.9, and 60.8 wt.% for AL, AXL, and ASL, respectively, achieved at 650 °C and over a C/O ratio of 6.
3.3.1. LPG and light olefins yields
As the conversion increased with the increase in temperature, yields of LPG increased for all crude oils, at 600 and 650 °C. At 600 °C, LPG yields for all crude oils were nearly the same, as shown in Table 4. The LPG yields at 600 °C and C/O ratio of 2 for AL, AXL, and ASL were 26.9, 26.5, and 27.8 wt.%, respectively. At 650 °C, there was much variation in LPG yield between the three crude oils. The LPG yield at C/O ratio of 6 and 650 °C increased in order: AL (33.5 wt.%) < AXL (35.9 wt.%) < and ASL (40.8 wt.%). The increase in LPG yield is credited to the cracking activity of the catalyst. Naphthenes and olefins (formed via primary reactions) are consumed by HT reactions to produce aromatics and paraffins [34]. From Table 4, Table 5, the increase in C/O ratio at the same temperature led to an increase in the HTC. However, the rise in temperature at the same C/O ratio decreased the HTC results. ASL crude oil showed the highest HTC for all experiments. For all crude oils, the LPG olefinicity decreased by increasing the conversion. ASL crude oil showed the lowest LPG olefinicity of 2.0 at C/O ratio of 6 and 600 °C (Table 5). At higher temperature (650 °C) the same behavior was observed, however, the LPG olefinicity was higher. At C/O ratio of 6, the LPG olefinicity of AXL crude oil at 600 and 650 °C was 2.7, and 5.1, respectively. The increase in LPG olefinicity is ascribed to the selectivity of catalytic cracking to produce higher yields of olefins compared with paraffins at high C/O ratios.
The yield of ethylene versus conversion is plotted in Fig. 6 at 650 °C. For all crude oils, ethylene yield increased by increasing both C/O ratio and temperature. To a lower extent, AL crude oil produced more ethylene than other crude oils. ASL crude oil yielded a lower amount of ethylene. As shown in Table 4, the yields of ethylene at 600 °C at a C/O of 4 for AL, AXL, and ASL were 6.6, 6.1 6.1 wt.%, respectively. Due to high severity and more cracking, the yield of ethylene exhibited an increase at high temperature. The yield of ethylene from AL crude oil cracking was enhanced from 7.2 wt.% at 600 °C up to 10.7 wt.%. Ethylene is not favored in catalytic cracking due to the relatively unstable primary intermediate carbenium ions. Instead, carbenium ions are formed due to branching isomerization reactions that undergo beta-scission to form ions of propyl carbenium which deprotonate to produce propylene [36].

Fig. 6. Product yields versus conversion for catalytic cracking of (●) AL, () AXL and () ASL crude oils at 650 °C over E-Cat/ZSM-5.
Fig. 6 shows the conversion effect on propylene yield. As expected, the conversion showed a positive impact on the propylene yield. High-level propylene yield for all crude oils is related to hydrogen transfer suppression which produce paraffins from olefins [37]. Bulky bimolecular reaction intermediates cannot be accommodated by the small pores of ZSM-5. FCC catalysts which contain ZSM-5 have high shape selectivity towards propylene production [30,37,38]. At 600 °C for the whole range of conversion, the yield of propylene decreased in order, AL, AXL, and ASL. The yield of propylene at highest conversion was 16.8 wt.% for AL, 16.5 wt.% for AXL, and 16.5 wt.% for ASL. In contrast, at 650 °C the order reversed. ASL at C/O ratio of 6 resulted in the largest yield of propylene of 21.6 wt.% while AL crude oil produced the lowest yield of 19.2 wt.%.
At 600 °C, the P/E ratio for all crude oils at C/O ratio of 2, 4, 6 was: 2.7, 2.5, and 2.3, (Table 4) respectively. At 650 °C, the P/E ratio was nearly constant with a value of 2.0 ± 0.1 for all crude oils at different C/O ratios which agrees with literature [6]. Furthermore, the ratio of C2=/C2 for all crude oils was elevated as C/O ratio having higher values. For ASL, the C2=/C2 ratios at 600 °C and C/O ratio of 2, 4, and 6 were: 3.4, 3.9, and 4.1, respectively. In addition, the values of C2=/C2 at a constant C/O ratio decreased in order: ASL > AXL > AL. The C3=/C3 ratio decreased with the increase in C/O ratio. At 650 °C, the C3=/C3 ratio decreased from 12.3 at C/O ratio of 2 to 5.9 at C/O ratio of 6.
3.3.2. Naphtha, LCO, and HCO yields
Naphtha is produced by the cracking of LCO and HCO, at the same time, naphtha is cracked to produce light products mainly light olefins [30]. The yield of naphtha was reduced by increasing the severity of the reaction (temperature and C/O ratio). Naphtha yields for ASL at 600 °C and C/O ratios of 2, 4, and 6 were, 49.4, 44.2, and 41.3 wt.%, respectively. The rise in temperature from 600 to 650 °C decreased the yield of naphtha of AXL from 34.8 to 27.7 wt.% (Table 4, Table 5) at C/O of 6. At both temperatures 600 and 650 °C the order of yield of naphtha increased in order: AL, AXL, and ASL. The yields of naphtha at 600 °C and 6 C/O ratio for AL, AXL, and ASL were, 28.3, 33.2, and 41.3 wt.%, respectively. The decrease in naphtha yield is connected with an improvement in light olefins yields.
The yields of HCO and LCO are plotted versus conversion in Fig. 6 for the three crude oils at 650 °C. As shown in Table 4, Table 5, the amount of remining LCO and HCO was decreased as the catalyst to oil ratio was increased due to further cracking. For the cracking of AXL at 600 °C, the increment from 2 to 6 in C/O ratio resulted in lowering the yields of LCO and HCO from 17.6 and 9.2 wt.% to 12.2 and 4.6 wt.%, respectively. In addition, the temperature plays an important role in cracking the heavy cuts (LCO and HCO). As shown in Table 4, Table 5, the cracking of AXL at C/O ratio of 4, LCO and HCO yields decreased from 13.2 and 7.1 wt.% to 11.5 and 6.1 wt.%, respectively, upon increasing temperature from 600 to 650 °C. At the same conditions of C/O ratio and temperature, the yields of LCO and HCO decreased in order: AL < AXL < ASL. At C/O ratio of 6 and a temperature of 650 °C and the yields of HCO and LCO for AL were 6.2 and 10.9 wt.%, for AXL were 3.8 and 9.9 wt.%, and for ASL were 1.3 and 6.3 wt.%, respectively. Fig. 7 presents the products distribution versus feed composition for catalytic cracking of the AL, AXL, and ASL at C/O of 6 and 650 °C. Differences in yields of naphtha, HCO, and LCO between the crude oils are caused by the initial amount of these fractions in the feeds.

3.3.3. Dry gas and coke yields
Fig. 6 presents yields of dry gas versus conversion at 650 °C for the three crude oils. The cracking of ASL produced the lowest dry gas yield followed by AXL and after that AL. As presented in Table 4, dry gas yields at 600 °C and C/O ratio of 4 for ASL, AXL, and AL were 9.6, 9.9, and 11.2 wt.%, respectively. Moreover, the increase in the C/O ratio improved the produced dry gas for all crude oils. The dry gas yields for AXL at 650 °C and C/O ratios of 2, 4, and 6 were 15.2, 17.0, and 19.8 wt.%, respectively. Furthermore, the rise in temperature further boosted yield of dry gas. An example of the temperature effect is the increase in the produced dry gas for cracking of ASL crude at C/O ratio of 2 from 7.6 wt.% at 600 °C up-to 14.0 wt.% at 650 °C. The main reason of the increment in dry gas yield is the further enhancement in ethylene yield.
The CMR values that are presented in Table 4, Table 5 at 600 and 650 °C, respectively, compare the variations in yields of dry gas. AL showed the highest CMR at all conditions followed by AXL and then ASL. The rise in reaction temperature showed an increase in CMR due to the influence of protolytic cracking compared with beta-scission and carbenium ion mechanisms [34]. The cracking of ASL at C/O ratio of 2 showed an increase CMR ratio from 4.1 at 600 °C to 18.0 at 650 °C. In addition, as the C/O increased, a reduction in the CMR took place, which is caused by the further enhancement in the yield of isobutane more than the increase in the yield of dry gas. An illustration of the C/O ratio effect on the CMR is the reduction in CMR of AXL at 650 °C from 33.1 at C/O ratio of 2 down to 15.8 at C/O ratio of 6 (Table 5).
Fig. 6 shows coke formation versus conversion for AL, AXL, and ASL at 650 °C. The yield of coke depends on C/O ratio, feed composition, particularly percentage of heavy cuts, and temperature. As the feed gets heavier, the produced coke that deposited on the catalyst gets higher. At all conditions, the order of coke yield followed the same order of the density of the crude oils which is in a decreasing order: AL, AXL, and ASL. At C/O ratio of 6.0 and 650 °C, the coke yields for AL, AXL, and ASL were 5.3, 3.1, and 1.4 wt.%, respectively. The rise in temperature resulted in increasing amount of coke produced. As presented in Table 4, Table 5 the coke yields at 600 and 650 °C for the AL cracking were 3.2 and 5.1 wt.%, respectively.
3.4. Catalytic versus thermal cracking
Fig. 8 illustrates the differences between thermal and catalytic cracking (constant C/O ratio of 6) in terms of light olefins and naphtha yields for AL, AXL, and ASL. Catalytic cracking showed a higher selectivity towards producing light olefins for all crude oils. For ASL, light olefins yield was enhanced from 18.8 wt.% for thermal cracking up-to nearly 43 wt.% for catalytic cracking. AL and AXL crude oils showed similar behavior. This rise in light olefins yield is attributed to two main reasons: (i) significant cracking of heavy molecules (HCO and LCO) over E-Cat which produced light olefins and enhanced naphtha yield. (ii) selective cracking over ZSM-5 of naphtha range molecules that are available in the crude oil and the naphtha produced from LCO and HCO cracking. The enhancement in light olefins yield for catalytic cracking resulted in lowering naphtha yield as illustrated in Fig. 8. On the other hand, produced naphtha was higher for thermal. For example, naphtha yield for catalytic cracking of ASL crude oil was 32 wt.% and for thermal cracking was 48 wt.%. Similarly, AXL and AL crude oils showed the same trend. The difference in yields between the three crude oils is attributed to the different composition of each crude oil.

Fig. 8. Comparison of catalytic () and thermal () cracking: light olefins and naphtha yields for crude oils at C/O = 6 and 650 °C.
The PIONA analysis of naphtha fraction for thermal and catalytic cracking is shown in Fig. 9. In thermal cracking, naphtha range olefins (12–15 wt.%) were mostly produced for all crude oils from paraffins cracking by free radical’s mechanism compared with about 1% olefins in catalytic cracking. The low content of naphtha range olefins in catalytic cracking is attributed to their cracking and aromatization to C2-C4 olefins and BTX aromatics. The increase in aromatics content in catalytic cracking was as follows: AL (74 wt.%) > AXL (73 wt.%) > ASL (58 wt.%). The cracking of paraffins reduced n-paraffins for ASL crude oil from 34 wt.% to 24 wt.% in thermal cracking compared with 10 wt.% in catalytic cracking. The efficient catalytic cracking of paraffins is attributed to acidity of E-Cat/ZSM-5 yielding more LPG and light olefins. The PIONA results showed a slight increase in naphthenes content for thermal cracking compared with a significant drop in catalytic cracking. For AL crude oil, naphthenes content increased from 9 to 15 wt.% in thermal cracking compared with a drop to 4 wt.% in catalytic cracking due to availability of large pores in E-Cat.

Fig. 9. Naphtha composition (PIONA) of catalytic and thermal cracking versus feeds at C/O = 6 and 650 °C.
The catalytic cracking of the three crude oils showed a higher yield of C2-C4 light olefins, compared to thermal cracking. While naphtha produced by thermal cracking was higher in yield, the PIONA composition showed higher aromatics content in catalytic cracking case. The increase in severity (temperature and C/O ratio) resulted in enrichment in yields of light olefins, dry gas, coke and LPG associated with a consistent reduction in HCO, LCO, and naphtha. Crude oils with lower API densities produced more light olefins compared to heavier crudes. Y-zeolite E-Cat cracked large hydrocarbons to produce naphtha and ZSM-5 (with narrower pores) allowed diffusion of naphtha range molecules to produce more light olefins in addition to its higher acidity.
4. Conclusions
This investigation has shown that the catalytic and thermal crackability of three different types of crude oils (with API gravity above 34°) to naphtha and light olefins. Using a fixed-bed MAT unit, catalytic and thermal cracking of crude oils were assessed at high reaction temperature between 600 to 650 °C. In thermal cracking, the yield of ethylene and propylene at 650 °C for the three crude oils was as follows: AL (16.2 wt.%) > AXL (13.4 wt.%) > ASL (12.9 wt.%) associated with naphtha yields of 34.4, 38.1 and 48.0 wt.%, respectively. Catalytic cracking showed that blending E-Cat with ZSM-5 enhanced conversion and improved yields of light olefins at the expense of LCO and HCO. For all crude oils, increasing C/O ratio from 2.0 to 6.0 g/g enhanced the yields of C2-C4 olefins, LPG, coke, and dry gas and decreased the yields of naphtha, LCO, and HCO. At 650 °C, we were able to achieve a total yield of ethylene and propylene of 32.2, 31.2, and 29.9 wt.% for ASL, AXL, and AL, respectively. Compared with thermal cracking, catalytic cracking of light crude oils over E-Cat/ZSM-5 at 650 °C and C/O of 6.0 has more than doubled the yields of C2-C4 olefins and increased aromatics content in naphtha fraction. Contrary to thermal cracking, the yields of C2-C4 olefins in catalytic cracking were as follows: ASL (42.9 wt.%) > AXL (41 wt.%) > AL (39.1 wt.%) associated with naphtha yields of 31.7, 27.5, and 23.0 wt.%, respectively. The results of this study showed that there is a potential route to produce basic petrochemical directly from whole crude oil cost-effectively with less energy consumption and reduced carbon emissions.
