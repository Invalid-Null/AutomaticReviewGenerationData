Mesoporous Silica Supported Highly Dispersed GaN Catalysts Synthesized by Thermal Atomic Layer Deposition for Propane Dehydrogenation
Graphical Abstract
Highly dispersed GaN catalysts supported on mesoporous silica were synthesized using thermal atomic layer deposition, which demonstrated excellent activity and selectivity in propane dehydrogenation. The specific activity of amorphous GaN turned out to be better than crystalline GaN. Density function theory calculation revealed that GaN was active in the cleavage of C−H bond in propane.
Abstract
As a typical wide band gap semiconductor material, gallium nitride (GaN) has found extensive applications in electronic related fields. This material could also make a promising catalyst. However, due to the difficulty of synthesizing high surface area GaN, its applications in catalysis have been greatly constrained. In this work, we report a novel method of synthesizing high surface area GaN catalysts supported on mesoporous silica (MCM-41) using thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD). Trimethyl gallium and ammonia were alternately dosed in the temperature range between 400–500 °C to generate nanoparticles of GaN on the support. Formation of highly dispersed GaN nanoparticles was confirmed and their structural and physiochemical properties were investigated. Structural characterization results reveal that amorphous GaN could be deposited on MCM-41 at 400 °C while crystalline GaN could only be formed at temperatures≥500 °C and with multiple cycles of ALD. In propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction the ALD GaN/MCM-41 catalysts demonstrated excellent activity and selectivity. The specific activity of amorphous GaN turned out to be better than crystalline GaN, probably due to the larger fraction of active species exposed on the surface. Density function theory calculation was used to analyze the catalytic process and mechanism of PDH on supported GaN. It was revealed that GaN was active in the cleavage of C−H bond in propane. Amorphous GaN facilitates the adsorption of propane, which could also contribute to the enhanced activity of amorphous GaN.
Introduction
Metal nitrides are a class of novel functional materials with many special physical and chemical characteristics, these materials have attracted great attention and have been used in various fields including electronics and optics.1-4 Thereinto, gallium nitride (GaN) is a most popular third-generation semiconductor material along with silicon carbide (SiC), aluminum nitride (AlN), and zinc oxide (ZnO).5-7 Due to its unique properties such as wide band gap (3.4 eV), high thermal conductivity, and low dielectric constant, GaN has found extensive applications in light emitting diodes, lithium-ion batteries, power transistors, etc.8-10
Notably, catalytic activity of GaN has been discovered for some chemical reactions.11 In 2006, Kida et al. investigated photocatalytic activity of a commercial GaN powder in decomposing water into H2 without noble metals and they found that the reaction yields largely depended on the electron donors used.12 Li et al. reported high conversion of methane into benzene and molecular hydrogen on Si-doped GaN nanowires through C−H bond activation.13 The same group also studied the catalytic activity of GaN in non-oxidative aromatization of light alkanes.14 In addition to aromatization, several works on coupling or dehydrogenation reactions from alkanes to olefins promoted by GaN were recently reported in which amazing catalytic activities were obtained.15-19 For instance, Chaudhari et al. studied the reaction mechanism of methane coupling to ethylene on GaN((100) surface through experiments and density functional theory. It was confirmed that CH4 can be activated on the m-plane of GaN with a relative low activation energy and the rate limiting step was found to be cleavage of C−H bond in CH3* species adsorbed on Ga top site.15 In 2019, Xing et al. discovered the superior reactivity and stability of GaN catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane for the first time, suggesting that O species in O2 and C−H bond in alkanes can be activated on the surface of GaN catalysts.18 Besides butane, GaN-based catalysts were also utilized as efficient catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 as the oxidant and Si−O−GaN species were believed to be the active sites.19, 20 Despite the promising catalytic activity, in most previous works very low conversion or catalytic efficiency was achieved, which is mainly due to the difficulty of synthesizing high quality GaN catalysts. For instance, in the work of Li et al., a commercial GaN powder with a very limited surface area (6.73 m2/g) was directly used as the catalyst. Normally, surface area plays a pivotal role in enhancing the catalytic efficiency in that only surface species can participate in the catalytic reactions.14 Besides, micro scale structural properties of catalyst particles, such as the size, shape, crystal phase and facet planes, may significantly affect the catalytic performance. Therefore, precise fabrication of high quality GaN catalyst is highly desirable for both enhancing the catalytic efficiency and deepening the understanding on reaction mechanisms.
For most heterogeneous catalytic reactions, ultra-fine catalyst particles supported on a large surface area substrate is much more advantageous than unsupported bulk catalyst in terms of utilization of catalytic species. To make supported GaN catalysts, wet chemistry techniques, such as impregnation, are the most frequently employed methods.16-22 With these methods the size and shape of GaN particles are largely dependent on the nitridating conditions including the temperature, reaction time, and ammonia concentration; generally, it is very difficult to precisely control the micro structure of the catalytic phase. Lousy controllability and reproducibility has retarded the development of supported GaN catalysts. Except for solution techniques, gas phase deposition techniques, such as metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), are commonly applied for the preparation of bulk GaN or GaN films.23-31 However, very high temperature and lattice matched crystal substrate are indispensible for MOCVD or epitaxial growth, which are very unfriendly requests for of catalyst synthesis. Besides, these conventional gas phase deposition techniques can hardly be effectively applied to high surface area substrates.
Recently, thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) was utilized to fabricate GaN films at relatively low temperatures without the assistance of plasma.32, 33 These results have paved way to synthesize supported GaN catalysts with precisely controlled structure. Herein, for the first time we report a facile method of synthesizing nanoscale GaN particles on a high surface area mesoporous silica support (MCM-41) through thermal atomic layer deposition. In this approach, trimethyl gallium (TMGa) and ammonia (NH3) were used as the precursors and the surface reaction was carried out at temperatures not higher than 773 K. No pre- or post-treatments of the support material was required. The as-prepared ALD GaN/MCM-41 catalysts exhibited good catalytic performances in conversion of propane to propylene. The effects of preparation and reaction conditions on the catalytic performances were studied, and the possible reaction mechanism was analyzed.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of ALD GaN/MCM-41 catalysts
The first half-reaction of GaN ALD is the surface reaction between the metal precursor, TMGa, and functional groups on the substrate (MCM-41), in which the methyl groups on TMGa are partially replaced by Ga−O bonds connected to the support. Subsequently, excessive reactant TMGa and the reaction byproduct CH4 were moved out of the reactor by N2 purge. During the second half-reaction, ammonia (NH3) is introduced to replace the remaining methyl groups connected to Ga and Ga−N bonds are formed. Due to the high bond energy of N−H bond in NH3 (450.1 kJ/mol), it is the second half reaction of GaN ALD that requires the high deposition temperature.34-36 Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the methyl groups in TMGa remain attached to Ga atom until about 550 °C, at which point the Ga−C bond will begin to cleave.37, 38 Increasing the deposition temperature can not only facilitate the cleavage of N−H bond but also promote the thermal decomposition of TMGa, which will lead to higher carbon contamination and formation of GaCN species.33 Therefore the proper thermal ALD reaction temperature window of GaN, within which self-limiting surface reaction can be achieved, is restricted to a range of 400 to 500 °C. Besides, for catalyst support materials with complex porous structures and large surface areas, a long precursor exposure is necessary to achieve saturation of the ALD surface reaction. Furthermore, in the earlier publications by S. Banerjee et al., the growth rate of ALD GaN with varied NH3 pulse duration was investigated.32 With longer exposure of NH3 an increasing trend of growth-per-cycle could be observed, which indicates that the second half reaction of GaN ALD is rather slow. A higher partial pressure and/or a longer exposure of NH3 than that of TMGa could provide more NH3 for occupying available active sites and sufficient reaction time to facilitate the formation of a reversible adduct (TMGa:NH3) at relatively lower temperatures.32, 33 Therefore the pulse durations for TMGa and NH3 are 200 s and 800 s respectively. Structural and physiochemical properties of the as-prepared ALD GaN/MCM-41 catalysts are analyzed in detail.
Catalyst characterization
Textural properties of the catalyst samples are investigated using physical adsorption technique. Figure 1 presents the N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms (Figure 1a) and pore size distribution curves (Figure 1b) measured on the MCM-41 support and on ALD GaN/MCM-41 catalyst samples. The corresponding experiment data, including the BET surface area, average pore size, and pore volume, are listed in Table 1. Based on the IUPAC classification, adsorption-desorption isotherms shown in Figure 1a belong to the standard type-IV isotherm.39 In the adsorption-desorption curves of all catalyst samples, sudden increments of slopes and hysteresis loops at the relative pressure range of 0.3 to 0.5 can be observed, which are caused by capillary condensation in mesopores of the molecular sieve. These results indicate that the highly ordered porous structure of MCM-41 is well-preserved after the deposition of GaN.40, 41 Compared with the original MCM-41 support, position of the capillary condensation step shifts to lower relative pressure after ALD of GaN, indicating the decreased pore volume as a result of the GaN deposition on the internal surface of the mesopores. In Figure 1b the peak of the pore size distribution curve shifts to a lower value after ALD of GaN and the pore volume becomes smaller with the increasing number of ALD cycle. These results are consistent with the information revealed by the isotherms. The accurate loading of GaN on the catalyst samples measured by ICP-AES technique are listed in Table 1. The average surface densities of Ga atom calculated based on the specific surface area of the support are also presented to help the readers get impressions on the distributions of the catalysts. A fairly high catalyst loading can be achieved even with only 1 cycle of GaN ALD, which is a result of the saturated ALD surface reaction in which all available reactive sites participate in the anchoring of Ga species during the first half-reaction. The loading of GaN and surface density of Ga atom gradually increase with the number of ALD cycle, while the increments are not proportional to the number of deposition cycle, which is probably a reflection of the different reaction possibility on oxygen and nitrogen terminated surfaces. The loading of GaN is also relevant to the reaction temperature and a higher loading can be achieved at 500 °C. It appears that a higher reaction temperature could significantly facilitate the efficiency of the ALD surface reaction. Due to the incorporation of GaN, the surface area of the original support has been reduced to some extent. However compared to GaN powders these ALD GaN/MCM-41 catalysts still have much larger surface areas which can provide sufficient active sites for catalytic reactions. In addition, the well-preserved mesoporous structure could facilitate diffusion of reactants and products through the channels of catalyst particles.

X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD) technique is used to characterize crystal structures of the catalyst samples. XRD patterns of the catalyst samples are displayed in Figure 2. In the XRD pattern of MCM-41, the weak and broad diffraction band between 2θ=15–35° is assigned to the hexagonal structure of the SiO2 zeolite.42, 43 Compared to the original MCM-41 support, no additional diffraction peak could be identified in the diffraction patterns of 400-1c-GaN/MCM-41, 400-3c-GaN/MCM-41, and 500-1c-GaN/MCM-41. However, on the catalyst sample prepared with 3 cycles of GaN ALD carried out at 500 °C, diffraction peaks at 2θ=31.2, 34.6, 36.9, 57.8, 63.4 and 69.1° can be clearly observed, which correspond to the (101), (002), (101), (110), (103) and (112) crystal planes of GaN (PDF card number 50-0792). These results suggest that no crystalline GaN phase could be detected at a deposition temperature as low as 400 °C or with only one cycle of ALD. That is to say, at these conditions either the crystalline phase couldn't be formed or the size and amount of crystalline GaN is too small or too low to be detected by XRD. At a reaction temperature sufficiently high and with multiple ALD cycles, more GaN is loaded on the support and small crystals of GaN become detectable. Notably, on sample 500-3c-GaN/MCM-41 the characteristic diffraction peaks of GaN are much wider than those of the GaN powder, indicating the formation of relatively small GaN crystals on the support,44 which could be attributed to the layer by layer film growth pattern and the space confinement effect from the channels on MCM-41.

Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping analysis was performed to check the existence and distribution of GaN species on the catalyst samples and the results are presented in Figure 3. On both catalyst samples (400-3c-GaN/MCM-41 and 500-3c-GaN/MCM-41) homogeneous distributions of Ga throughout the support can be clearly observed, which is a solid proof of the formation of well dispersed GaN species on the MCM-41 support. As for N element, generally the distribution is also uniform however the signal is weaker than that for Ga (Figure 3c and 3 f). This discrepancy is principally caused by the low resolution of the semiconductor detector for light elements.45

Detailed structural and morphological properties of the catalyst samples are studied using transmission electron microscopy technique. Figure 4 shows TEM micrographs of a representative catalyst sample (500-3c-GaN/MCM-41) at different magnifications. In Figure 4a the mesoporous structure of the MCM-41 support can be clearly observed under a low magnification of the microscope. GaN nanoparticles can be identified as the dark spots dispersed in the meso pores. At a higher magnification the GaN particles incorporated in the support become more prominent in that the lattice fringes can be observed in the dark region of the micrograph (Figure 4b). Since the GaN particles are mostly dispersed on the internal surface of the support, the average size of the GaN particles is less than 4 nm. High-resolution TEM images of the same catalyst sample are displayed in Figure 4c and Figure 4d. In these images lattice fringes with inter planar spacing of 0.26 nm can be clearly identified, which corresponds to the (200) crystal plane of GaN. The microstructures of other catalyst samples (400-1c-GaN/MCM-41, 400–3c-GaN/MCM-41, 500-1c-GaN/MCM-41) were also studied using TEM (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). However, on those samples no obvious feature of GaN crystals could be observed, demonstrating that no crystalline GaN particles are formed at a lower deposition temperature (400 °C) or with only 1 ALD cycle of GaN. Generally, the results of electron microscopy characterization are in good agreement with those of XRD.

Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy can be used to analyze the defects in GaN crystals. In this work, PL spectra were obtained to confirm the formation of GaN crystal structure and to analyze the possible defects and impurities in GaN crystals. Figure 5 presents the emission spectra of the original MCM-41 support and the series of ALD GaN/MCM-41 catalysts. Among the catalyst and support materials tested, only the spectrum of 500-3c-GaN/MCM-41 show a distinct broad emission band, which is an indication of the crystallized GaN with special optical properties. It turns out that formation crystallized GaN is strongly dependent on the reaction temperature as well as the number of ALD cycle; it can only be realized at a high enough reaction temperature and with multiple cycles of ALD. This result is consistent with those of XRD and TEM characterizations. To further analyze the possible impurity and / or defects in the GaN structure, the PL spectrum of 500-3c-GaN/MCM-41 is de-convoluted into three parts. An intense near-band-edge luminescence peak centered at 2.98 eV is caused by dissociation of excitons bounded to natural donors.46 The blue luminescence band observed at 2.65 eV is resulted from dislocation edges due to Ga and N vacancies.47 A broad yellow luminescence band with the maximum at 2.40 eV can also be observed, which can be attributed to Ga vacancy or C atom substituted Ga sites, or a complex involving carbon.48, 49 Formation of these defect sites may be related to incomplete decomposition of TMGa or generation of GaCN composite during GaN ALD carried out at 500 °C.32, 33

The chemical nature of GaN species supported on MCM-41 is investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Both signals of Ga and N can be detected on ALD GaN/MCM-41 catalysts. XPS spectra of the catalyst samples are shown in Figure 6, in which the Ga 2p3/2 and N 1s regions are presented in Figure 6a and Figure 6b respectively. In all GaN/MCM-41 catalysts, peaks corresponding to Ga−N bond, which centered at a binding energy of 1118.4 eV in the Ga 2p3/2 spectra (Figure 6a) and at 398.6 eV in the N 1s spectra (Figure 6b) respectively, can be detected. Positions of these peaks are close to the reported values for GaN.50, 51 Meanwhile, with the increasing loading of GaN, intensities of both Ga 2p and N 1s peaks become stronger. In order to investigate the impact of deposition temperature and number of ALD cycle on the chemical property of synthesized GaN, the Ga 2p3/2 and N 1s bands are de-convoluted and the corresponding spectra are shown in Figure 3(c-d). The characteristic peaks of Ga attributed to Ga−Ga or Ga−O (at nearly 1116.9 eV) and Ga−N bond (at 1118.4 eV) can been seen in the Ga 2p3/2 spectra.51, 52 The presence of Ga−N bond became more evident with higher deposition temperature as well as longer total time of TMGa exposure, suggesting that high temperature facilitates the formation of Ga−N bond and promote the deep decomposition of TMGa. Meantime, intensities of peaks corresponding to Ga−N bond (at 397.4 eV in N 1s) and N−H bond (at 398.1 eV) in catalysts with 3 cycles of GaN ALD are much stronger than those with only 1 cycle of GaN ALD regardless of the deposition temperature. While the peak observed at 401.5 eV, which is assigned to the excessive NH3 adsorbed on sample surface, becomes smaller with the increasing number of ALD cycle.53 It appears that the adsorption of NH3 becomes weaker as the surface of the support is changed from oxygen terminated to nitrogen terminated state.

Acid sites are import active sites for dehydrogenation reactions. The type and strength of acid sites on the series of ALD GaN/MCM-41 catalysts are tested by NH3-TPD technique. The obtained TPD curves are presented in Figure 7. The original MCM-41 support shows no obvious peak except for a gentle baseline drift, indicating that few acid sites exist on MCM-41. Acid sites are generated with the introduction of GaN through ALD. In the TPD curves of all ALD GaN/MCM-41 catalysts peaks at around 200 °C and 380 °C are observed, which respectively correspond to weak and medium strength acid sites.54, 55 Moreover, for sample 500-3c-GaN/MCM-41 an extra desorption peak at around 450 °C is observed, which suggests the existence of medium to strong acid sites.56 Comparing the characterization results of TPD and PL spectroscopy, it is speculated that the medium to strong acid sites in 500-3c-GaN/MCM-41 catalyst may arise from defect sites in the crystal structure of GaN.57

Catalytic Performance
Catalysis experiments were first performed with a weight-hour-space-velocity of 1.0 h−1 to evaluate the activities of these ALD GaN catalysts. In each experiment 50 mg of supported GaN/MCM-41 catalyst was charged to the micro reactor. The possible effect of mass transfer has been eliminated under our reaction conditions. Detailed experiment procedures to exclude the possible influences of mass transfer are described in the Supporting Information. Figure 8a presents the propane conversion vs reaction temperature plots for different GaN/MCM-41 catalysts (400-1c-GaN/MCM-41, 400-3c-GaN/MCM-41, 500-1c-GaN/MCM-41, and 500-3c-GaN/MCM-41) and the bare MCM-41 support. Negligible conversion was obtained with the MCM-41 support, suggesting that the activity was almost entirely contributed from supported GaN species. For GaN/MCM-41 catalysts the propane conversion increased from ∼5 to ∼20 % as the temperature rose, and the highest conversion, 22.62 %, was achieved on 500-3c-GaN/MCM-41 at a reaction temperature of 550 °C. Propane dehydrogenation is a highly endothermic reaction with a rather small equilibrium constant (T=800 K, Kp=6.34×10−4).58 Thus, the conversion was enhanced when the temperature increased from 400 to 550 °C. Catalysts fabricated by 3 ALD cycles of GaN outperformed those with only 1 cycle GaN ALD, suggesting that the enhanced conversion of propane is probably due to the increased number of active sites, which is closely related to the GaN loading. In addition, GaN/MCM-41 catalysts synthesized at 500 °C showed higher conversion compared to their counterparts prepared at 400 °C using the same ALD sequence. Since the ALD reaction of GaN is more efficient at 500 °C, more GaN species were loaded on the support, therefore higher conversion was obtained. These results demonstrate that the catalytic performances of these GaN/MCM-41 catalysts can be adjusted by tuning the loading of GaN, which can be conveniently achieved by changing the reaction parameters of ALD.

Figure 8b and 8c present the selectivity and yields of propylene with ALD GaN/MCM-41 catalysts at different reaction temperatures. Generally, for all these GaN/MCM-41 catalysts propylene was the dominant product from 450 to 550 °C and the excellent selectivity was maintained with the rising propane conversion. Aromatics were barely detected under all tested reaction temperatures. The cleavage of C−C bond, which results in cracking reactions (ΔHΘ298=98.9 kJ/mol), is the main competitive route for propane dehydrogenation (ΔHΘ298=124.3 kJ/mol).59 The rates of both reactions will be accelerated with the increased reaction temperature. However, desorption of propylene, which is considered the selectivity descriptor, can be greatly facilitated by increasing the reaction temperature. Consequently, propylene selectivity is enhanced with the increasing reaction temperature. On the other hand, C−C cleavage and deep dehydrogenation reactions are also promoted at higher temperatures, therefore the selectivity to propylene stopped to grow and even slightly dropped at 550 °C.
Figure 8d and 8e present the results of stability tests for ALD GaN/MCM-41 catalysts carried out at 550 °C. With increasing time-on-stream (TOS), relatively gentle declines of conversion occurred to 1c-GaN/MCM-41 catalysts (from ∼11.83 % to ∼10.20 % for 400-1c-GaN/MCM-41 and from ∼12.29 % to ∼9.59 % for 500–1c-GaN/MCM-41), whilst much more obvious deactivation was observed on 3c-GaN/MCM-41 catalysts (from ∼20.40 % to ∼14.95 % for 400-3c-GaN/MCM-41 and from ∼22.62 % to ∼11.62 % for 500-3c-GaN/MCM-41). Cokes, which are composed of undesirable carbonaceous materials formed in the pores or on the external surface of catalysts, are considered the main reason for deactivation of catalysts in PDH reaction. With the formation of cokes the interaction between propane molecules and active sites is severely hindered. The number and nature of acid sites on the catalyst plays an important role in coke formation.60 The presence of strong acid sites on the surface can readily promote surface coking and thereby block the pores and/or cover the active GaN species. The distinct band representing strong acid sites in the NH3-TPD plot of 500–3c-GaN/MCM-41 has predicted its rapid deactivation in PDH reaction. It is noteworthy that after the first 8 hrs of fast deactivation, the catalyst has reached a steady conversion of about 13 %, which is contributed from the stable active sites remained on the surface. Figure 8f presents the long-term stability of 500-3c-GaN/MCM-41 tested at 450 °C, and a much better stability was achieved. Apparently, coke formation and deactivation of catalysts could be mitigated at a lower reaction temperature.
To better understand the nature of GaN active sites, catalytic experiments were also performed using exactly the same amount of GaN species. In these experiments the total mass of different catalysts were adjusted based on the GaN loading to make sure that a same amount of GaN was used in each test. Figure 9a and 9b show the dependence of propane conversion and propylene selectivity on the reaction temperature obtained from different catalysts. Very similar conversions were obtained on 400-1c-GaN/MCM-41, 400-3c-GaN/MCM-41 and 500-1c-GaN/MCM-41. The GaN species in these three catalyst samples are all in the amorphous state. Interestingly, the 500-3c-GaN/MCM-41 catalyst with crystalline GaN particles showed a much lower specific activity, especially at higher reaction temperatures. It has been proposed that propane is prone to adsorb on Ga3+ and N3− of GaN which can polarize C−H bond electrostatically and activate light hydrocarbons at relatively low temperatures.13-15 The inferior conversion of 500-3c-GaN/MCM-41 catalyst sample suggests that the activity of supported GaN catalyst in PDH reaction is closely related to the number of exposed Ga−N bonds which directly influences the probability of propane adsorption and propylene desorption on GaN. Compared to crystallized GaN, almost all Ga−N structures in the highly dispersed amorphous state are exposed on the surface and are accessible to the reactant, therefore similarly high conversion was obtained on the catalysts with amorphous GaN structures. Among different amorphous GaN catalysts supported on MCM-41, the 400-3c-GaN/MCM-41 sample exhibits the best performance in that it has the highest utilization rate of the support (the highest GaN loading) so that a similar propane conversion could be obtained with less catalyst. Besides, this catalyst shows satisfactory stability in PDH reaction over a long period of time (Figure 8d).

In selectivity vs temperature plots (Figure 9b–d), trends similar to those in Fig 8b can be observed in that the propylene selectivity was enhanced with the increasing reaction temperature form 400 °C to 500 °C and a slight decrease could be observed at 550 °C. Generally, selectivities to cracking products are quite low (less than 3 %) at most tested reaction temperatures. Compared to other industrialized metal-based catalysts for PDH reaction, these GaN/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit comparable propylene selectivity (up to 85.3 % at 550 °C vs 89.0 % at 550 °C for Oleflex Pt-based catalyst or 84.0 % at 540 °C for FED Cr-based catalyst) with little hydrocarbon byproducts (methane, ethane, and ethylene) produced.58, 61 Under our reaction conditions (550 °C, 1 atm), the calculated equilibrium conversion of PDH reaction is 66.7 %. (Detailed calculation procedures are presented in the Supporting Information.) Since the the equilibrium conversion has not been reached, these PDH catalysts still have room for improvement.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculation
DFT calculation was first applied to reveal possible reasons for the better catalytic performance of amorphous GaN. Models of supported amorphous (1c-GaN/MCM-41) and crystalline (3c-GaN/MCM-41) GaN catalysts which consist of Ga and N atoms in equal numbers linked to the surface of silica (MCM-41) were built (Figure 10). Then a propane molecular was positioned close to the supported GaN/MCM-41 catalysts at different possible sites. The adsorption energy, *E (ads), was estimated by DFT calculation using the following equation:

While on 3c-GaN/MCM-41, adsorption is more difficult to occur (Figure 10b) and the near edge site is more favorable for propane adsorption (*E(ads)=−0.752 eV) compared with the other two sites (*E(ads)=−0.597 and −0.436 eV respectively). During the adsorption of propane molecule, the oxygen atom on the surface of MCM-41 framework plays a positive role by attracting the hydrogen atom in propane closer to the nitrogen atom in GaN and thus facilitating the formation of relatively stable adsorption configuration. However, on the surface of crystalline GaN, adsorption of propane is much less favorable due to the absence of neighboring oxygen atom. Therefore, it can be inferred that the weaker interaction between propane molecule and crystalline GaN may also lead to the inferior catalytic activity of 500–3c-GaN/MCM-41.
From previous studies, it has been reported that C−H bond activation of hydrocarbons by GaN is closely correlated with Ga3+ and N3− atoms on the m-plane of GaN.13, 14 As shown in Figure 11a, a model for propane molecule and supported GaN/MCM-41 catalyst was built to investigate the mechanism of PDH at the molecular level. It is generally accepted that direct dehydrogenation of an alkane molecule contains 3 steps, including two consecutive steps for C−H activation and hydrogen desorption in the final step.62 On the basis of bond energy, the C−H bond linked with the secondary carbon atom (EC2-H4=98.1 kJ/mol) will break prior to the one with the primary carbon atom (EC1-H1=100.9 kJ/mol).63, 64 Calculations for potential reaction path and transition states (TS) search were performed and the results are depicted in Figure 11b. The calculated lengths of different bonds through the catalytic cycle are listed in Table 2. In the catalytic reaction, the H4 atom linked to the secondary carbon C2 is attracted by N13− through electrostatic force, and C2 is located close to adjacent Ga13+ in supported GaN. Specifically, the activated C2-H4 bond is stretched from 1.104 to 1.867 Å and the distance between Ga1 and C2 is decreased to 2.669 Å, resulting in the formation of ‘Ga1…C2-H4…N1’ transient structure shown as TS-1 in Figure 11b. Then heterolytic cleavage of C−H bond takes place and the first hydrogen is detached from propane molecular (FS-1). Subsequently, the primary carbon in propane is brought close to nearby Ga23+ (with a distance of 2.66 Å) and another intermediate ‘Ga2…C1-H1…N2’ (TS-2) is formed. Then the second H atom is subtracted from C1 by N23− (FS-2). After cleavages of the two C−H bonds, the catalytic cycle is completed through release of propylene with an energy barrier of 3.22 eV. Through the calculations, activation and cleavage of C−H bonds are found to be relevant to the electrostatic force and formation of the ‘Ga…C-H…N’ intermediate. These calculation results provide a rational interpretation on the mechanism of PDH reaction with GaN catalysts from the microscopic perspective.

Conclusion
Thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to synthesize supported GaN catalysts on a large surface area mesoporous silica support (MCM-41). Highly dispersed GaN species were uniformly distributed on the MCM-41 support, which could be directly used as catalytic materials without post-treatment. Characterization results of STEM, HRTEM, XPS, XRD, NH3-TPD and PL spectroscopy demonstrate that structural and chemical properties of the GaN/MCM-41 catalysts were closely related to the ALD reaction parameters. Specifically, amorphous GaN could be deposited on MCM-41 at 400 °C while crystalline GaN could only be formed at temperatures≥500 °C and with multiple cycles of ALD. In PDH reaction the ALD GaN/MCM-41 catalysts exhibited excellent activity and selectivity. The catalysts with amorphous GaN showed higher specific activity compared to the one with crystalline GaN. The yields of propylene with supported amorphous GaN were close to the thermodynamic equilibrium conversion. Using DFT calculation the reaction process was studied at the molecular level, and GaN was found to be active in the cleavage of C−H bond in propane. The higher activity of amorphous GaN may be due to the larger fraction of active species exposed on the surface. Besides, it was discovered that amorphous GaN facilitates the adsorption of propane, which could also contribute to the enhanced activity. This work significantly advances the novel application of GaN as an effective alternative to costly noble metal catalysts for PDH reaction.
Experimental Section
Synthesis of GaN/MCM-41 catalysts
A commercial mesoporous silica molecular sieve (MCM-41, Xian Feng NANO, China) with a surface area of 1007 m2/g was used as the catalyst support. Gallium nitride (GaN) catalysts were prepared using thermal atomic layer deposition (ALD) method. ALD of GaN was carried out in a MCRI FH-2-HT ALD system (Xi'an Modern Chemistry Research Institute) equipped with a quartz reactor. Specifically, nearly 0.2 g of the original MCM-41 support was weighed and evenly spread in a quartz boat and the container was inserted to the center of the quartz reactor. The chamber was kept at 400 to 500 °C. The gallium precursor, trimethyl gallium (TMGa, 99 %, Ai Mou Yuan Scientific Equipment Co., Ltd., China) was kept in a stainless steel container cooled down to −25 °C. 10 % NH3/He gas (Dalian Special Gases Co., LTD, China) supplied through a corrosion resistant mass flow controller was used as the nitrogen source. Ultrahigh purity nitrogen (99.999 %, Xi'an Weiguang Gas Co., China) was used as the carrier gas. ALD of GaN was carried out by alternating exposures to TMGa and NH3 using a pulse sequence of 200-200-800-200 s in which a TMGa dose of 200 s, a NH3 dose of 800 s, and a purge time of 200 s was applied. Reaction parameters such as the deposition temperature and the number of ALD cycle were varied to obtain GaN particles with different loading and structure. The synthesized catalyst samples are represented as x-y-GaN/MCM-41 where x corresponds to the temperature (in °C) of ALD reaction and y refers to the number of GaN ALD cycles performed. For instance, catalyst 400–3c-GaN/MCM-41 represents the sample synthesized by performing 3 ALD cycles of GaN on MCM-41 at 400 °C.
Catalyst characterization
Textural properties of the catalysts were revealed by nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms measured with a Micrometritics ASPS 2010 instrument. Prior to N2 adsorption measurements, the samples were degassed at 350 °C for 6 h. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization was performed to identify the crystal structure and particle size of catalyst samples using a Rigaku D/Max 2400 X-ray diffractometer with Cu−Kα radiation. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were conducted on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha instrument with Al Kα radiation (1468.68 eV). XPS peaks were calibrated using the binding energy of C1s peak at 284.6 eV. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the catalyst samples were taken with a Hitachi F-7000 fluorescence spectrophotometer to examine the possible defects of GaN crystals. Morphological properties of GaN particles supported on MCM-41 were investigated using a JEOL JEM-2100 F high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM). Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis was carried out to examine the distribution of GaN on the support. The exact contents of Ga in the catalyst samples were determined by Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) using a Thermo Scientific iCAP 7000 equipment. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD)of NH3 was used to analyze the acid sites of the catalyst samples using a Micromeritics Auto Chem 2950 HP automated catalyst characterization system.
Catalyst evaluation
Catalytic properties of the as-synthesized GaN/MCM-41 catalysts were tested for dehydrogenation of propane (PDH) in a fixed-bed continuous-flow reactor. The reaction was carried out in a 4 mm i.d. quartz tube at ambient pressure. 50–60 mg of the catalyst was charged for each test. A thermocouple was inserted into the catalyst bed to measure the reaction temperature. Prior to catalysis tests, the catalyst samples were kept at 350 °C for 1 h in a high purity N2 flow before reaching the target reaction temperature (400–550 °C). The flow rate of C3H8 reactant (5 % C3H8/N2, Dalian Special Gases Co., LTD, China) was adjusted to 9.5 sccm. Experiment data were collected 30 minutes after the reaction temperature had stabilized. The effluent products were analyzed online by an Agilent 7820 gas chromatographer (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Gaseous products were separated using an Agilent AL/KCL capillary column.
Density functional theory computation
Theoretical calculations based on finite molecular models were carried out using the DMol3 package of Materials Studio software. The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerh (PBE) of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was employed to relax all molecular structures. Double numeric plus polarization (DNP) basis set was used for all calculations. The convergence tolerance of the energy was set to 10−5 hartree (1 hartree=27.21 eV). Other thresholds of the convergence criteria included 0.005 Å for maximal allowed displacement and 0.004 hartree/Å for maximal force. The orbital cutoff is set to fine (4.8 Å). To study the interaction between propane and GaN on silica at the quantum mechanical level, silica containing 91 atoms was extracted from the surface of MCM-41. To saturate the slab, hydrogen atoms were added to the extremities of the severed bonds.65-67
