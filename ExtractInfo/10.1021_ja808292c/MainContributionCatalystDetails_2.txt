The provided document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. It examines the effects of zeolite structure and acid site location on the monomolecular cracking and dehydrogenation of propane and n-butane. While it provides insights into catalyst design strategies that can improve selectivity, conversion and stability of acid catalyzed reactions in general, it does not focus on enhancements for propane dehydrogenation to propylene specifically.
