 Unfortunately, the provided extracts do not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation catalysts. The extracts all indicate that the documents discuss the dehydrogenation of isobutane, not propane. Since no pertinent details are provided, I am unable to synthesize a cohesive summary. The output will simply indicate that the documents are not relevant:
