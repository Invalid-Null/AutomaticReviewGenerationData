 the supplied document does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses general approaches for sustainable process design and optimization, using a case study of on-purpose propylene production, but does not go into details about specific catalysts or reactor systems for propane dehydrogenation. The document mentions propane dehydrogenation briefly as one potential route for propylene production, but does not provide any scientific contributions in that area.
