The provided document discusses a methodology for analyzing sustainability of processes using a sustainability weighted return on investment metric with a case study for on-purpose propylene production. It does not contain details about a specific catalyst for propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. Since the document does not pertain to propane dehydrogenation catalysts, I have indicated "No" for relevance in the output.
