 Unfortunately, the provided document extracts do not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation research. The documents focus on the conversion of ethane to ethylene and aromatics using cobalt-exchanged HZSM-5 zeolite catalysts, with no discussion of propane dehydrogenation to produce propylene. Since there are no relevant details provided in the documents, I cannot synthesize a meaningful summary. The output would reflect that these documents are not relevant:
