Stable co-production of olefins and aromatics from ethane over Co2+-exchanged HZSM-5 zeolite†
Catalytic conversion of ethane into olefins and aromatics is an effective approach for the utilization of low-cost light paraffins. In this study, with the ion-exchange method, Co-exchanged HZSM-5 catalysts were prepared in which Co2+ ions were stably anchored at exchangeable sites, i.e., the Brønsted acid sites (–AlF–O(H)–SiF–), to form isolated extra-framework Co(II) species (–AlF–O–Co(II)–O–AlF–) in the zeolite. In comparison to the CoOx clusters mainly formed in an impregnated catalyst, the isolated Co(II) species can withstand the reduction by H2 even at a high temperature, and are only active for C–H bond dissociation but almost inactive for the C–C bond scission, ensuring a high selectivity to the primary ethylene product without serious coke and CH4 formation. Further with appropriate acidity and right pore size of the employed HZSM-5 zeolite, the formed olefins can be partly converted into aromatics with a total selectivity to olefins and aromatics up to 83% under reaction conditions of 600 °C, 0.1 MPa, 3000 mL g−1 h−1 and 90%C2H6/10%N2. Fortunately, at a moderate temperature, the Co(II) species did not suffer a significant de-anchoring from the zeolite framework to form sintered Co0 clusters, ensuring good catalyst stability.
1. Introduction
Both light olefins (ethylene and propylene) and aromatics (benzene, toluene, xylene, etc.) are significant value-added chemicals for the production of bulk commodities such as plastics, solvents and pesticides.1–3 They are produced in industry mainly from the catalytic cracking and reforming of naphtha,1,4–6 using petroleum as the raw material. In recent years, various non-oil-based processes with coal-derived syngas (CO/CO2/H2),7–13 synthesized methanol14,15 and light alkanes (CH4, C2H6 and C3H8)16–21 have been developed for producing olefins and aromatics, meeting their increasing market demand. In comparison to the reactions with methane as a feedstock, such as non-oxidative methane dehydroaromatization (MDA)18,22,23 and oxidative coupling of methane (OCM),16,17 conversion of ethane and propane into olefins or/and aromatics that can take place at mild reaction temperatures (400–650 °C) has attracted more attention and interest,19–21 especially considering that a large portion of these low-cost hydrocarbons existed in shale gas.
For the production of aromatics from various light n-paraffins, zeolites that have appropriate acidity and a ten-membered-ring channel structure such as HZSM-5 are essential for efficient aromatization catalysts, in addition to the also necessary components capable of dehydrogenation of alkanes. However, the reported catalyst systems are mainly limited to the Mo-, Zn- and Ga-based zeolite catalysts,24–27 while the components like Pt or PtSn,28–30 V (ref. 31 and 32) and Cr (ref. 33 and 34) that are also active and selective for alkane dehydrogenation were little considered. This may be due to the fact that these metals (Mo, Zn and Ga) easily move to the Brønsted acid sites (BAS) in zeolite channels in the catalyst preparation process, including the impregnation step in a solution (for Zn) or calcination step in air (for Mo),35 and in the zeolite synthesis process (for Ga). In comparison, high-valence metal ions or their precursors with a large size have difficulty entering zeolite channels in a solution, resulting in their locations being on the zeolite external surface and leading to low selectivity to aromatics.
For Fe, Co and Ni, they are generally active for alkane decomposition into carbon materials and H2 as M0 clusters are formed in catalysts by a traditional impregnation or precipitation method.36,37 The zero-valence metal clusters could promote both C–H and C–C bond cleavage probably due to their rich electrons that can be easily transferred to the adsorbed bonds over them. However, interestingly, as their atoms had a strong interaction with a support to form a –M–O– structure without being reduced, the cleavage of the C–C bond could be well suppressed, favoring the formation of olefins with high selectivity.38 Recently, more efforts including ours have been made to construct Fe- and, especially, Co-based catalysts using various preparation methods, and they all showed good catalytic performance in ethane and propane dehydrogenation.19,20,38–46 Therefore, it can be seen that if stable Co–O species can be constructed in acidic HZSM-5 zeolite channels, aromatics can be synthesized from light paraffins via the synergetic catalysis of Co and BAS, and Co/HZSM-5 catalysts will be a new member of the catalyst family for alkane aromatization.
Previously, by the ion-exchange method we have prepared Co2+-exchanged HZSM-5 catalysts for the MDA reaction for the first time.47 Different from Co oxides that are easily reduced by H2 below 500 °C, the exchanged Co sites that anchor the zeolite framework to form the –AlF–OF–Co–OF–AlF– structure are quite stable and difficult to reduce by H2 even at a high temperature. This may be due to the difficulty in removing their neighboring O atoms that belong to the zeolite framework. The –Co–O– active sites can appropriately activate the C–H bond without deep dehydrogenation of CH4 into coke, resulting in high selectivity to aromatics up to 80%. However, because of the high reaction temperature of 700–800 °C, these anchored Co2+ species would be gradually de-anchored from the exchanged sites with the reaction proceeding, resulting in irreversible catalyst deactivation. Recently, a Co-exchanged SAPO-34 catalyst was then prepared by us for ethane dehydrogenation at 600 °C. It was confirmed that Co2+ was isolated at the exchangeable BAS sites using EXAFS and only facilitated the C–H bond cleavage but suppressed the C–C bond scission, leading to high selectivity to ethylene (>98%) in ethane dehydrogenation at 600 °C;38 moreover, the Co(ii) species were stable without obvious de-anchoring and sintering. The de-anchoring of the exchanged metal ions can be greatly alleviated at lower reaction temperatures, such as below 600 °C.
However, the formation of aromatics is suppressed over the SAPO-34 zeolite, because SAPO-34 has a smaller channel size (0.34 nm) than the kinetic diameters of aromatics. For producing aromatics, HZSM-5 zeolite that has a suitable pore size (∼0.55 nm) is commonly used. With these considerations, it can be highly expected that the ethylene that formed in the Co-catalyzed ethane dehydrogenation can be easily transformed into aromatics as acidic HZSM-5 zeolite is applied, driving the conversion of ethane. In this study, various Co/HZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by the ion-exchange method that allows isolated Co active sites anchoring at exchangeable sites in the zeolite, and tested for the ethane reaction at 600 °C. Different from the MDA reaction at 700–800 °C (ref. 47) in which the Co-exchanged HZSM-5 zeolites deactivated rapidly, it was observed that the Co species stably catalyzed the ethane reaction for the co-production of olefins and aromatics with a total selectivity higher than 80%. This study can provide a potential strategy for constructing a Co-based HZSM-5 catalyst for the monetization of low-cost hydrocarbon feedstocks.
2. Experimental
2.1 Catalyst preparation
HZSM-5-supported Co catalysts were prepared by ion-exchanging of HZSM-5 with Co2+ ions. In detail, 5 g of HZSM-5 zeolite (Si/Al = 12.5, 18, 25 and 40, purchased from NanKai University Catalyst Co., Ltd., China) was added into a 25 ml aqueous solution of 2 mol L−1 Co(NO3)2, and then the mixture was stirred at 90 °C for 10 h. After that, the mixture was filtered under vacuum and washed with deionized water slowly and repeatedly. The resulting sample was dried at 120 °C for 12 h and calcined at 550 °C for 5 h in static air. The obtained catalysts were denoted as Co/HZSM-5-IE (x) where IE and x represent the ion-exchange method and the Si/Al ratio of the zeolite used, respectively. The catalyst powder was tableted, crushed and sieved into particles with a size range of 250–425 μm for use.
For comparison, two 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5 (12.5) and 1 wt% Co/SiO2 catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) method, and the resulting catalysts were named as 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5-IWI (12.5) and 1 wt% Co/SiO2-IWI, respectively.
2.2 Catalyst characterization
XRD patterns of samples were obtained on a D2 Phaser instrument (Bruker) using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1540598 nm) at 40 kV and 40 mA. FT-IR spectra of samples were collected on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer from Thermo Fisher Scientific Corporation. UV-vis DR spectra of dried catalyst samples were obtained over a UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-3000 plus) with a diffuse reflectance attachment of integrating sphere. The reflectance of BaSO4 was referenced as the baseline for samples. The HAADF-STEM images and the corresponding elemental mapping were obtained on a FEI TalosF200x instrument with a Super-X EDS apparatus. The surface area and microporosity of the sample was analyzed by N2 adsorption and desorption at 87 K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 system. Prior to adsorption measurement, vacuum degassing pretreatment was conducted at 673 K for 4 h. TG measurement was used to determine the coke amount in the spent catalyst sample on a thermogravimetric analyzer (Mettler-Toledo TGA-1100SF). The coke amount was estimated by the weight loss between 660 K and 873 K.
NH3-TPD, H2-TPR and O2-TPO experiments were conducted on an automatic chemical adsorption setup (BelCAT-II, Japan). In a NH3-TPD test, 0.100 g of a dried sample was loaded in a quartz tube and pretreated in a Ar stream (99.99%) at 500 °C for 30 min, and cooled down to 100 °C for the adsorption of NH3 in a 10%NH3/He stream for 30 min. Then, the physically adsorbed NH3 molecules on the sample were blown away in a He stream at the same temperature (100 °C) for 30 min and, at the same time, a stable TCD baseline was obtained. Finally, the NH3-adsorbed sample was heated to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 in the same He stream to record the TCD signal. For the H2-TPR, an Ar-pretreated sample at 500 °C was reduced from 100 to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 in a 10%H2/Ar stream and the TCD signal was recorded. For the O2-TPO, an Ar-pretreated coked sample was oxidized by a 10%O2/He stream from 100 to 800 °C and the mass signals of CO (m/z 28) and CO2 (m/z 44) were recorded.
2.3 Catalytic test
Catalytic tests of ethane conversion were conducted in a U-shaped quartz-tube reactor (inner diameter: 8 mm). In each test, 0.3 g of a dried catalyst was charged into the reactor. Prior to the reaction, the catalyst bed was heated to 600 °C in an Ar stream from room temperature at a rate of 10 °C min−1 and kept for 10 min. After that, a 90%C2H6/N2 feed of 15 mL min−1 was switched to flow into the reactor for starting the reaction. The effluent out of the reactor was sampled within two loops attached with one 10-port valve, and then analyzed on-line at a fixed interval using a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with one TCD and two FIDs. The packed column of PQ (5 m) is used for separation of N2, CH4, C2H4, and C2H6, while the capillary columns of Al2O3 and PEG are used for separation of hydrocarbons and aromatics, respectively. The pipelines and valve between the reactor and GC were heated and held at 180 °C for avoiding the condensation of aromatics. The N2 in the feed is used as an internal standard substance for the calculation of flow rate (eqn (1)) and ethane conversion (eqn (2)). The selectivity to each hydrocarbon product (eqn (3)) was obtained by the external standard method and the selectivity to coke was calculated by eqn (4). Together with measuring the coke content in spent catalysts, the carbon balance was confirmed to be 95–105%.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the Co/HZSM-5 catalysts
3.1.1 Textural properties of the Co/HZSM-5 catalysts The Co content in each Co/HZSM-5 catalyst was analyzed by ICP-AES and listed in Table 1. For an ion-exchanged catalyst, the Co content depends on the number of exchangeable sites in a zeolite, i.e., the number of Al pairs (–Al–(O–Si)n=1,2–O–Al–), under the ion-exchange rule that one divalent Co2+ ion exchanges two Brønsted acid sites (–AlF–O(H)–SiF–) for charge compensation. The number of Al pairs, however, depends on the content and distribution of framework Al in a zeolite which varies with zeolite synthesis conditions.48–50 As expected, the Co content in the Co/HZSM-5-IE catalyst decreased from 1.42 wt% to only 0.04 wt%, as the Si/Al ratio increased from 12.5 to 40. Nevertheless, the Co contents in these catalysts were all lower than the theoretical ones which should be 3.5%, 2.5%, 1.9% and 1.2% for the zeolites with Si/Al ratios of 12.5, 18, 25 and 40, respectively, if all BASs were exchanged. This suggests a large amount of single Al sites (–Al– (O–Si)n>2–O–Al–) in the present HZSM-5 zeolite. Co2+ ions are generally used as a probe to determine the fraction of Al pairs in a zeolite.51,52 For the HZSM-5 (12.5) zeolite, the fraction of Al pairs was about 40–44.2%, because the Co content in the zeolite increased from 1.42 wt% to only 1.57 wt% as the exchange time extended from 10 h to 20 h.47 With the same manner, the fractions of Al pairs in the other three zeolites were calculated to be 26.8% for Si/Al = 18, 9.7% for 25 and only 3.4% for 40, respectively.

Table 1 also lists the BET surface areas and micropore volumes of HZSM-5 (12.5) zeolite, Co/HZSM-5-IE (12.5) and 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5-IWI (12.5) catalysts. Decreases in both the BET surface area and micropore volume were observed as Co species were introduced into the zeolite. This is due to partial blocking of zeolite channels with either exchanged Co ions or supported Co oxide clusters, reducing the N2 physisorption capacity of the zeolite.53
3.1.2 Location and chemical state of Co species in the IE Co/HZSM-5 catalysts The relatively low Co contents in these Co/HZSM-5-IE catalysts lead to little information about the Co species by XRD and FT-IR. As shown in Fig. 1, the Co/HZSM-5-IE (12.5) and 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5-IWI (12.5) catalysts having the highest Co contents showed similar XRD patterns and FTIR spectra with the parent HZSM-5 without any hint of Co species, possibly suggesting a high dispersion of Co species in both catalysts. Therefore, more characterizations are needed to probe the location and chemical state of Co species in the prepared Co/HZSM-5 catalysts.

Fig. 2 compares the HAADF-STEM images and the corresponding elemental mapping of Co/HZSM-5-IE (12.5) and 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5-IWI (12.5) catalysts. Clearly, Co species were highly dispersed on the IE-prepared Co/HZSM-5 catalyst but aggregated in clusters with an average particle size of 2.6 nm (Fig. 2(b)) on the IWI-prepared catalyst. The distribution of the Co element in the Co/HZSM-5-IE (12.5) was uniform as same as those of the Al, Si and O elements in the zeolite, which may suggest that negligible Co oxide clusters existed. These well-dispersed Co species should anchor at the exchange sites in the zeolite, in accord with the characteristic of most metal-exchanged zeolite catalysts.38,47,54,55

Fig. 3 shows the NH3-TPD profiles of all HZSM-5 zeolites and corresponding IE-prepared Co/HZSM-5 catalysts. Two main and typical peaks centered at about 220 and 450 °C were observed, which are ascribed to the NH3 desorption at weak and strong acid sites,56–62 respectively. For the employed HZSM-5 zeolite, previous studies including ours have demonstrated that the strong acid sites in the zeolite are well related with the Brønsted acid sites (BASs) in the form of bridge hydroxyl groups,57,58,60,61,63i.e., the –Al–O(H)–Si– structure, by a comparison between NH3-TPD and pyridine FT-IR characterization. The terminal hydroxyl groups like –Si–OH and, especially–Al–OH may exhibit weak acidity. It can be seen (Fig. S1†) that with the increase of the Si/Al ratio in the HZSM-5 from 12.5 to 40, corresponding to the Al content decreasing from 3.4 wt% to 1.1 wt%, the strong acidity decreased almost linearly. This plotting well strengthens the mapping between the strong acid sites and BASs.

With the introduction of Co ions into the HZSM-5 zeolites by the ion-exchange method, the acidity, especially for the strong acid sites, decreased in different degrees depending on the Si/Al ratio in the zeolite. About 32.9% of total strong acid sites (330–800 °C) in the HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 12.5) was reduced by 1.42 wt% of Co, suggesting that the introduced Co species ought to exchange the BASs in the zeolite. For the other three Co-exchanged catalysts, the degrees in the reduction were 23.9%, 16.2% and 0.1% for the HZSM-5s with Si/Al ratios of 18, 25 and 40, respectively. The inconsistent decreases in the fraction of the occupied acid sites in each Co/HZSM-5-IE catalyst suggest that the fractions of paired Al sites were not identical and obviously decreased with decreasing content of Al sites in the zeolite. As a result, the exchanged Co contents were not linear with the number of Al sites in the zeolite, but almost linear with the reductions in the strong acid sites (Fig. S2†). In addition to anchoring Co ions for activation of ethane into ethylene, the BASs also play a role in the aromatization process as well as coking for catalyst deactivation.
UV-vis spectrometer is a useful tool for identifying the coordination geometry of Co species in a catalyst.49,52,64Fig. 4 shows the UV-vis spectra of all Co/HZSM-5 catalysts. The band ranging from 16 500 to 24 000 cm−1 is attributed to bare Co(ii) ions in the zeolite. However, the existence of the band below 16 500 cm−1 that is related with the d–d transition band of Co2+/Co3+ species suggests the formation of Co3O4 in a sample. The band over 25 000 cm−1 is characteristic of zeolites.65 Therefore, it is clear that the IWI method inevitably leads to metal oxide clusters, while the IE method does not, because the excess metal ions on the zeolite surface were fully washed away in the catalyst preparation stage. With the increase of the Si/Al ratio in the HZSM-5, the adsorption intensity of the band (16 500–24 000 cm−1) for the bare Co(ii) species weakened obviously, certainly due to the decrease in Co content in catalysts.
Fig. 4 UV-vis spectra of all Co/HZSM-5-IE and 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5-IWI (12.5) catalysts.
Interestingly, Co2+ ions have been regarded as a reliable probe for characterizing the number and the location of Al pairs in a zeolite according to the obtained UV-vis spectrum, because it is believed that Co2+ can be singly anchored at the Al pair with a sequence of –Al–O–Co–O–Al–.48,49 Further, deconvolution of the band between 16 500 and 24 000 cm−1 for the Co/HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 12.5) catalyst (Fig. S3†) could suggest that about 73% of Al pairs were located in the intersection of the straight and sinusoidal channels of the HZSM-5 zeolite, while the others were at straight (2%) and sinusoidal (24.5%) channels, respectively.
3.1.3 Reducibility of the exchanged Co species A typical characteristic of the metal-exchanged zeolite catalysts is that the metal ions are difficult to reduce by H2 even at high temperatures, suggesting the extra-framework Co2+ ions in the ion exchange sites with a –AlF–OF–Co(ii)–OF–AlF– structure (Fig. S4†) would be very stable in the reaction. This may be due to the difficult removal of the O atoms from the stable zeolite framework by H2. Thus, the H2-TPR experiment can be a practical tool for further confirming the chemical states of Co species in catalysts.
As shown in Fig. 5, little H2 was consumed by the IE-prepared Co/HZSM-5 catalysts in the temperature range of 200–800 °C. By comparison, the IWI-prepared 1 wt% Co/SiO2 and 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5 catalysts consumed a great amount of H2, suggesting that reducible Co species, i.e., CoOx clusters, existed in the catalyst. Noting that the Co contents (1.4–1.6 wt%) were similar in the Co/HZSM-5-IE (12.5) and Co/HZSM-5-IWI catalysts (Table 1), the unreducible property of the Co/HZSM-5-IE catalyst suggests that the Co species should not be in the form of oxide clusters, but disperse atomically in the form of –AlF–OF–Co–OF–AlF– at ion exchange sites. In comparison to the reduction processes of a synthesized Co3O4 compound (Fig. S5) and the SiO2-supported Co catalyst (Fig. 5, black line), the H2 reduction of the CoOx clusters in the 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5-IWI catalyst was very difficult with three H2-consumption peaks in a very high temperature zone (400–800 °C). This may indicate that the CoOx clusters had a strong interaction with the zeolite after catalyst calcination. The peak at 715 °C can be attributed to the reduction of Co oxides located in the inner of zeolite channels.
Fig. 5 H2-TPR profiles of all Co/HZSM-5-IE, 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5-IWI (12.5) and 1 wt% Co/SiO2-IWI catalysts.
As the 1 wt% Co/SiO2-IWI and 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5-IWI (12.5) catalysts were reduced by H2 at 600 °C for 30 min, the reduced samples were then easily attracted by a magnet, suggesting a possible formation of metallic Co species. With XPS characterization, a certain amount of Co0 species was indeed detected in the reduced 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5-IWI (Si/Al = 12.5) sample. However, probably due to the low Co content (1 wt%) in the 1 wt% Co/SiO2 catalyst and that most of the Co species located at the inner pore of SiO2, little information was gained from the XPS spectrum of the catalyst. As the Co content was increased up to 15 wt% in the Co/SiO2 catalyst with the same reduction treatment, metallic Co was then identified. The formation of Co0 clusters would not be beneficial to the production of olefins from paraffins, because they could promote both C–C and C–H bond cleavage in the reaction.38
3.2 Catalytic performance of the co-exchanged HZSM-5 for ethane dehydrogenation and aromatization
Fig. 6 shows the catalytic results of ethane conversion over Co-based catalysts, including four IE-prepared Co/HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 12.5∼40) catalysts, one IWI-prepared 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 12.5) catalyst and one IWI-prepared 1 wt% Co/SiO2 catalyst, at 600 °C, 0.1 MPa and 3000 mL g−1 h−1 (90% of ethane content in the feed). As HZSM-5 zeolite was applied, it can be seen that aromatic hydrocarbons, including benzene, toluene and naphthalene, were also produced with considerable selectivity, in addition to olefins and paraffins. This is a reasonable observation for an acidic HZSM-5 zeolite and, hence, the selectivity to aromatics cannot be ignored in the alkane dehydrogenation over a HZSM-5-supported metal catalyst.24–26,28,41,53,66–68 Here, the selectivities to olefins and aromatics are given (Fig. 6) and those to other alkanes as well as coke for carbon balance are shown in Fig. S7 and Table S1.†
Fig. 6 (a) The C2H6 conversion and (b–d) the selectivity to aromatics, olefins and total for all Co-based catalysts. Reaction conditions: 0.3 g of catalysts, 90%C2H6/N2, 15 mL min−1, 600 °C, pressure at 0.1 MPa.
As shown in Fig. 6(a), the ethane conversion depends on not only the Co content but also the chemical state of Co species in the catalyst. Over 50% of ethane conversion was obtained at 10 min of time-on-stream for the 1 wt% Co/SiO2-IWI catalyst, but CH4 and coke were the dominant products (Fig. S7(b)†) while olefins were almost not produced. The conversion should be higher during the initial 10 min of reaction over the Co/SiO2 catalyst. However, it deactivated rapidly and lost all activity just at the second point (40 min). This deactivation is certainly ascribed to the serious coke deposition over the formed Co0 clusters (Fig. S6†) that favors both C–C and C–H bond scissions.38 It should be noted that the Co content in the Co/SiO2 catalyst was only 1 wt%, less than those in the Co/HZSM-5-IE (12.5) and 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5-IWI catalysts. However, when these Co species were rightly placed into the HZSM-5 zeolite channels with special chemical structures (Fig. S4†), coke formation could be greatly suppressed, especially for the IE-prepared catalysts. With the same reason, the 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5-IWI catalyst showed a higher ethane conversion (Fig. 6(a)) and lower selectivities to olefins and aromatics (Fig. 6(d)) in the initial 10 min of reaction than the Co/HZSM-5-IE (12.5) catalyst, because it also contained a certain amount of Co0 clusters (Fig. S6†). However, as the Co0 clusters were covered by coke deposition, the ethane feed could be stably dehydrogenated into olefins rather than coke or/and CH4 at the remaining effective Co sites that may have similar chemical structures to those in the IE-prepared Co/HZSM-5 catalyst. After all, for the IWI-prepared catalysts, some Co2+ ions also exchanged with BASs in the impregnation process. Without or with a little amount of BASs in the zeolite, like HZSM-5 (40), Co species were mainly located on the external surface of the zeolite in the form of Co oxide clusters for an IWI-prepared 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5-IWI (40) catalyst, boosting ethane cracking into coke and CH4 (Fig. S8†).
Olefins (ethylene and propylene) and aromatics (benzene, toluene, xylene, naphthalene and methyl-naphthalene) were co-produced with a total selectivity of about 83% (Fig. 6(d) and Table S1†) in the ethane conversion over both IE- and IWI-prepared Co/HZSM-5 catalysts. Due to the extremely low Co content (0.04 wt%) in the Co/HZSM-5-IE (40) catalyst, almost none of ethane was converted, resulting in a difficult detection of hydrocarbons other than ethane in gas chromatography. For the IE-prepared Co/HZSM-5 catalyst, the Co content highly depends on the number of exchangeable sites in the zeolite, i.e., the Brønsted acid sites (or framework Al sites, especially the paired Al sites). More BASs, corresponding to the HZSM-5 zeolite with a lower Si/Al ratio, led to a higher Co content accompanied by higher ethane conversion. It can be seen that the average ethane conversions obtained over the IE-prepared Co/HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 12.5–25) catalysts were almost linear with the Co content (Fig. S9†), which were 21.8% (1.42 wt% of Co content), 12.4% (0.68 wt%), and 4.6% (0.18 wt%), respectively. The TOF value (s−1, mol of converted ethane per mol of Co active sites per second) was calculated to be 0.03–0.05 s−1.
The distribution of olefins and aromatics was very different among the IE-prepared Co/HZSM-5 catalysts (Fig. 6(b) and (c)), and a clear teeterboard effect occurred for them – the higher selectivity to aromatics, the lower to olefins (Fig. 7). The Co/HZSM-5-IE (12.5) showed the highest selectivity (>0%) to aromatics while the Co/HZSM-5-IE (25) showed the lowest one (∼17%). However, this situation was reversed completely for olefins. Formation of aromatics highly depends on BASs in HZSM-5, but its selectivity is also connected with the ethane conversion level (or say the Co content). HZSM-5 zeolite with a high Si/Al ratio would lead to 1) a low Co content in an IE-prepared catalyst and 2) a low BAS density. As seen in Fig. 6(a), the low Co content resulted in an also low conversion of ethane to ethylene, a precursor for aromatics. Thus, the low concentration of ethylene together with the low BAS density would be bound to reduce the driving force for conversion of olefins to aromatics, because one aromatic molecule needs more than three ethylene molecules.
Fig. 7 The effect of Co content (or ethane conversion level) on the selectivities to olefins and aromatics for ethane dehydrogenation over the Co/HZSM-5-IE catalyst at 600 °C.
Noting the higher BAS density in the HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 12.5) zeolite, polycondensation of olefins or/and aromatics into coke would be enhanced, and the coke could cover BASs and gradually narrow the zeolite channels, leading to a decrease in the selectivity to aromatics over both Co/HZSM-5-IE (12.5) and 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5-IWI catalysts with time-on-stream. Instead, the selectivity to olefins increased. With coke deposition narrowing the zeolite channels, aromatics that have similar dynamic diameters with the pore size of the HZSM-5 were restrained to diffuse out the channel, and products had to shift to the precursor of aromatics, i.e., the olefins that have smaller dynamic diameters. Because of the coke formation as well as the very low equilibrium conversion of ethane for the ethane dehydrogenation compared to that for ethane aromatization, the ethane conversion was observed to decrease over the two catalysts.
In contrast, the formation of both olefins and aromatics were very stable in the whole reaction over the Co/HZSM-5-IE (18) and Co/HZSM-5-IE (25) catalysts. The former one yielded 30–34% of the selectivity to aromatics, 41–44% of that to ethylene and 8–11% of that to propylene at an ethane conversion of 12.4%, showing good suppression in coke formation probably due to the appropriate BAS density in the zeolite. However, elevating the reaction temperature from 600 °C to 650 °C would promote the deactivation of the Co/HZSM-5-IE (18) catalyst, although the initial ethane conversion and the selectivity to aromatics both increased (Fig. S10†). On the other hand, increasing the space velocity up to 6000 mL g−1 h−1 at 600 °C, the selectivity to aromatics decreased while that to olefins increased, again suggesting that olefins were the precursors of aromatics (Fig. S11†).
With these catalytic results (Fig. 6), the roles of metallic Co0 clusters, exchanged Co sites and BASs in the ethane dehydrogenation have been clearly demonstrated. Co0 clusters boost both C–H and C–C bond scissions, leading to the formation of coke and CH4, while the Co species in the form of –AlF–O–Co(ii) –O–AlF– species are mainly responsible for C–H bond scission, leading to the formation of ethylene. Previously, we also performed DFT calculations on the dissociation energies of C–H and C–C bonds over Co0 clusters and isolated Co(ii) sites in SAPO-34 zeolite,38 giving identical conclusions. By means of the BASs and the appropriate zeolite channel, some ethylene is converted into aromatics. Over the Co-exchanged HZSM-5 catalyst, aromatics and olefins could be stably co-produced with a total selectivity of 83% as the BAS density is not larger in the unit cell of HZSM-5 crystals.
3.3 Catalyst deactivation modes
3.3.1 Coke deposition Coke deposition and accumulation is the major cause for catalyst deactivation by covering active sites and blocking zeolite channels. Fig. 8 shows the coke contents in the spent Co-based catalysts. Clearly, the coke content in the IWI-prepared 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 12.5), being 14.0 wt%, was greatly higher than those in the IE-prepared ones (0.2–4.0 wt%). In particular, the content reached up to 37 wt% in the spent 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5-IWI (Si/Al = 40), which is certainly caused by initial serious ethane cracking over the Co0 clusters. For the IE-prepared catalysts, it is confirmed that the spent Co/HZSM-5-IE (18) and Co/HZSM-5-IE (25) that have lower BAS density in the zeolite unit cell showed very low coke contents, being only 0.2 and 0.7 wt%, respectively, compared to the spent Co/HZSM-5-IE (12.5). This observation is well in line with the result of activity evaluation (Fig. 6). The coke in the spent Co/HZSM-5-IE (12.5) catalyst was attributed to polycondensation of olefins and aromatics over the high-density BASs in the zeolite channels.
Fig. 8 TG profiles of spent Co-based catalysts.
For the spent 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5-IWI (12.5) catalyst, two weight loss stages were observed, suggesting two kinds of coke or different coke locations in the sample. Further, O2-TPO measurement was conducted for these coked samples, and the obtained profiles are given in Fig. 9. Indeed, two distinct coke-burning peaks were centered at 505 and 635 °C, respectively. The former one indicates that coke was easier to oxidize probably because it is rich in hydrogen or due to the approach to Co sites that can play a catalytic role in coke oxidation,69 while the latter one might be related with the coke that had a high degree of crystallinity, like graphite and carbon nanotubes (CNTs), or/and that was far away from Co sites. As seen in Fig. 10, a large amount of CNTs was observed over the spent IWI-prepared Co/HZSM-5 sample, and its formation is certainly ascribed to ethane decomposition over Co0 clusters.36 However, for the spent IE-prepared catalyst, the high-temperature coke-burning peak was mainly attributed to the coke deposited on BASs in the zeolite channels, because little CNTs were observed over them (Fig. 10). Due to the higher BAS density in the HZSM-5 (Si/Al = 12.5), the spent Co/HZSM-5-IE (12.5) catalyst contained more high-temperature coke than the other two IE-prepared Co/HZSM-5 catalysts, in line with activity tests in which the selectivity to aromatics was very stable during reaction for the Co/HZSM-IE (18) and Co/HZSM-IE (25) catalysts (Fig. 6).

Fig. 10 SEM observations of spent catalysts: (a) 2 wt% Co/HZSM-5-IWI (12.5) and (b) Co/HZSM-5-IE (12.5).
3.3.2 De-anchoring of the exchanged Co species In addition to coke deposition, de-anchoring of Co(ii) ions from the –AlF–O–Co–O–AlF– structure could also cause catalyst deactivation. Previously, the same Co-exchanged HZSM-5 catalyst was tested for conversion of methane into aromatics with surprising activity and selectivity at 700 °C and higher ones,47 but the exchanged Co(ii) active sites could be de-anchored, reduced and sintered into Co0 clusters with time on stream at such high temperatures, thus promoting CH4 decomposition and catalyst deactivation. Fortunately, the de-anchoring of the isolated Co species was not observed in the present reaction due to a lower reaction temperature (600 °C).
H2-TPR is an efficient tool for confirming the existence of Co0 or CoOx clusters in a sample. After the removal of all coke with 10%O2/He at 550 °C for 2 h, any existing Co0 clusters were also oxidized into cobalt oxides that then can be recognized in H2-TPR. As shown in Fig. 11, the obtained H2-TPR profile of the spent Co/HZSM-5-IE (12.5) was almost duplicated with that of the fresh one, suggesting that the exchanged Co sites were very stable during the 5 h reaction due to unobservable H2 consumption. If the Co(ii) species departed from the zeolite framework, a clear H2 consumption peak could have been observed, such as the reference case (the dashed line in Fig. 11).47

4. Conclusion
In summary, various Co-exchanged HZSM-5 catalysts with different Si/Al ratios were prepared and characterized, and they are efficient for the conversion of ethane into both olefins and aromatics with a total selectivity over 80% at a relatively moderate reaction temperature (600 °C). The Brønsted acid sites in the HZSM-5 zeolite not only provide the exchangeable sites for anchoring Co2+ species, but also serve as active sites for the formation of aromatics in the zeolite channels. Over these Co/HZSM-5-IE catalysts, metal Co2+ ions are recognized to be strictly anchored at Al pairs in a zeolite to form an isolated –AlF–O–Co(ii)–O–AlF– structure, which are difficult to reduce by H2 into sintered Co0 clusters. The isolated Co(ii) species can suppress the C–C bond scission but favor the C–H bond activation, while Co0 clusters promote both C–C and C–H scissions, leading to the formation of coke and the unexpected CH4. At the moderate reaction temperature, the Co(ii) species are much stable without significant de-anchoring from the zeolite framework, ensuring the catalyst stability for co-production of the value-added olefins and aromatics.
