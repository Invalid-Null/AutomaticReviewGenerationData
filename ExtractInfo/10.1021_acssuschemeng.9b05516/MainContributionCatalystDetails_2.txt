 Based on the given document, this does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses the production of propylene from methanol via the methanol-to-propylene (MTP) process. While it mentions propane dehydrogenation (PDH) briefly as an alternative propylene production route, the focus is on comparing MTP to steam cracking of naphtha. No specific catalysts or improvements to PDH or oxidative PDH are discussed.
