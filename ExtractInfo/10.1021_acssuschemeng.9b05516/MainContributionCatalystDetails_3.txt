 Unfortunately, the provided document does not seem to discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The paper focuses on assessing different production routes for propylene, including from methanol, but does not go into details about catalysts or reactor design for propane dehydrogenation. So I don't have the relevant information to populate the XML output you requested.
