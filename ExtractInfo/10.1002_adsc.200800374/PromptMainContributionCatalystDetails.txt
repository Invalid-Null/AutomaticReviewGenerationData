Selective Hydrogen Oxidation Catalysts via Genetic Algorithms
Abstract
Solid “oxygen reservoirs,” such as doped ceria, can be successfully applied in a novel process for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The ceria lattice oxygen selectively burns hydrogen from the dehydrogenation mixture at 550 °C. This gives three key advantages: it shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium to the desired product side, generates heat in situ, which aids the endothermic dehydrogenation, and simplifies product separation. We have applied a genetic algorithm to screen doped cerias for their performance in the selective hydrogen oxidation. Three generations of doped ceria catalysts (61 catalysts in total), were synthesised. Dopants were chosen from a set of 26 elements, and with a maximum of two dopants per catalyst, at five different concentrations. The catalyst performance (activity and selectivity), is expressed by a fitness value. Each generation shows a higher average fitness value. The dopant type has a large effect on the catalyst fitness. We identified six dopant atoms which lead to selective hydrogen combustion catalysts, namely bismuth (Bi), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), potassium (K), manganese (Mn), lead (Pb) and tin (Sn) (“good” dopants). Analysis of the effect of electronegativity, ionic radius and dopant concentration shows that most elements yielding a high fitness have electronegativities ranging from 1.5–1.9. Generally, the properties of catalysts containing two dopants can be predicted from the behaviour of singly doped ones. Synergy does occur for certain copper-, iron- and platinum-containing catalysts. The addition of calcium (Ca) or magnesium (Mg) to copper-doped catalysts doubles the activity, and the selectivity of iron doped catalysts can be improved by adding chromium (Cr), manganese (Mn) or zirconium (Zr). Importantly, the doped cerias show a high stability in the redox cycling, much higher than that of supported oxides. A Cr- and Zr-doped catalyst (Ce0.90Cr0.05Zr0.05O2) was highly selective and active over 250 redox cycles (a total of 148 h on stream), with no phase segregation or change in particle size.

        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
