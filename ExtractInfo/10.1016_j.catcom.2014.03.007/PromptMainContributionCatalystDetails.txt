ZnNbO catalysts for propylene production via catalytic dehydrogenation of propane




1. Introduction
Niobium-based catalysts are effective in numerous reactions: selective oxidation [1], dehydrogenation [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], oxidative coupling of methane [7], [8] and hydration [9]. Due to the special properties like strong stability and metal–support interaction, a great deal of research was focused on the synthesis, characterization and application of niobium compounds.
Over the last decade, much effort has been dedicated to obtaining efficient catalysts for propylene production via catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. But little attention has been paid to Nb-containing multicomponent mixed oxides, which showed excellent performance in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes [10], [11], [12], [13]. Zhao et al. found that the addition of V2O5 and MoO3 increased the activity of Nb2O5 in ODH of propane [4]. Recently, the development of highly active NiNbO oxides exhibiting 46% ethylene yield for ethane ODH was also reported [3], [5]. However, the re-adsorption and interaction of propylene with MOx (M = V, Mo, Ni) led to total oxidation and reduced propylene selectivity. In contrast, ZnO is less reducible and shows much lower activity in oxidation reaction. Mole et al. found that zinc oxide could catalyze the heterolytic cleavage of CH [14]. Kazansky et al. [15] and Kolyaginalso et al. [16] also proposed that propane dehydrogenation on Zn-containing catalysts proceeded through propane dissociative adsorption over ZnO. And to our knowledge, there was no literature focused on the application of ZnNbO mixed oxides in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane.
In this paper, a series of ZnNbO oxides were synthesized via the co-precipitation method. The effect of calcination temperature and molar ratio of ZnO/Nb2O5 was studied in view of bulk and surface properties. Besides, their relation to dehydrogenation performance was also discussed to give an insight into the nature of the active sites.

Detailed description of the synthesis, characterization [17] and catalytic test of ZnNbO oxides was presented in Supporting Information S1 Experimental.
3. Results and discussion
TG–DTA analysis of uncalcined ZnNbO oxide with 1:1 molar ratio of ZnO/Nb2O5 was displayed in Fig. S1. Three endothermic peaks in the temperature range from room temperature to ~ 450 °C were observed and attributed to dehydration of adsorbed water and decomposition of niobium oxalate. Increasing the temperature to 800 °C, the reaction between ZnO and Nb2O5 occurred, which was represented by the exothermic peak centered at about 600 °C [18], [19]. Based on the results, the temperature range between 600 °C and 800 °C was selected to study the influence of calcination temperature.
As shown in Fig. 1(a), only diffraction lines of ZnO and a broad band centered at 2θ 27° attributed to amorphous niobium phase were observed for ZN-450, which are matched with JCDPS file numbers 89-1397 and 3-873. As the calcination temperature went up to 600 °C, diffraction peaks corresponding to ZnNb2O6 consistent with reported values (JCDPS 37-1371) emerged and became sharper gradually with increasing temperature. Upon calcination at 800 °C, diffraction peaks of Zn3Nb2O8 appeared (JCDPS 15-339). Obvious sintering phenomenon was observed over sample ZN-800 with the emergence of larger ZnNb2O6 and Zn3Nb2O8 crystals (Fig. 2 and Table S1). However, the single phase of ZnNb2O6 still hasn't been obtained under the present conditions, which may be attributed to the poor reactivity of starting materials and the processing schedule [18], [20], [21]. For multi-component metal oxides, the composition is another important factor influencing the catalytic performance [5], [22]. From Fig. 1(b) we can see that at low ratio (below 2.0), diffraction peaks indicative of ZnNb2O6 were strengthened with the increased molar ratio of ZnO/Nb2O5, while a further increase to 3.0 led to a weakened ZnNb2O6 phase and the disappearance of Nb2O5.

The activity of ZnNbO oxides was studied with a constant W/F (0.20 g s/cm3) and displayed in Table S1 and Fig. 3. Both propane conversion and propylene yield decreased dramatically with increased calcination temperature; only 6.1 wt.% propylene yield was obtained over sample ZN-800. Pure Nb2O5 exhibited low activity with propylene selectivity not exceeding 50% while pure ZnO exhibited only 2.0 wt.% propylene yield at 5.5 wt.% propane conversion. The incorporation of a small amount of ZnO caused little changes in the activity but a 100% increase in selectivity. Increasing the molar ratio to 0.5, propylene yield climbed from 3.9 wt.% to 11.4 wt.%, which reached the maximum (28.1 wt.%) at 3.0. The weakest ZnNb2O6 phase was obtained at 0.2 and the conversion was the lowest, which seemed to suggest that the formation of ZnNb2O6 was indispensable to excellent performance. This was further confirmed by the fact that at molar ratios below 2.0, the activity increased with increasing ratio of ZnO/Nb2O5.

From previous results, it could be concluded that the key component for the excellent catalytic behavior was ZnNb2O6. Firstly, the mixed oxides with the formation of ZnNb2O6 exhibited significantly better performance compared to pure Nb2O5 and ZnO. Though the activity decreased with increasing calcination temperature, sharper and higher diffraction peaks indicative of larger ZnNb2O6 crystals resulting in decreased active surface area were also observed. To rule out the effect of surface area, the reaction rates normalized per surface area were shown in Fig. S2. Based on this definition, the reactivity decreased in the following order: ZN-800 > ZN-700 > ZN-600, which agreed with decreased intensity of ZnNb2O6. The reaction was also conducted over 16 g of sample ZN-800. As we might expect, propane conversion significantly increased to 23.4 wt.%, suggesting that the extremely small surface area of ZN-800 was primarily responsible for the poor performance. Thus, it could be deduced that for ZnNbO oxides, ZnNb2O6 was the active site for propane dehydrogenation.
It is worth noting that though the strongest intensity of ZnNb2O6 was observed at the ratio of 2.0, the activity was not the highest. In addition to ZnNb2O6, ZnO was another major component at high ratio (above 2.0). Thus, we may suppose that the existence of ZnO contributes to the reaction as well.
XPS data of ZnNbO oxides were summarized in Table S2 and Fig. S3. With increased ratio of ZnO/Nb2O5 (below 3.0), the band position of Zn 2p slightly shifted to higher binding energy while that of Nb 3d shifted to lower energy, demonstrating an electron transfer from Zn to Nb [23], which resulted in an electron-deficient state of Zn atoms. Since the secondary carbon of propane has 0.051 negative charges, they are more likely to adsorb. Increasing the ratio to 4.0, ZnNb2O6 crystals become larger with the formation of Zn3Nb2O8, while further increase (above 4.0) led to the reaction between ZnO and ZnNb2O6 generating larger Zn3Nb2O8 crystals (Table S2), all of which reduced the active surface area and thus the dehydrogenation activity.
To obtain more information about the sites involved in propane activation, the SSAc (specific surface activity) expressed as 10− 2 μmol C3H8 consumed/(m2 s) and the surface concentration of Zn or Nb were plotted as a function of the nominal Zn/Nb ratio in Fig. 4. We can see that the activity and the number of exposed surface Zn sites followed the same trend with increasing Zn/Nb ratio, while an opposite trend was observed between SSAc and surface Nb concentration. This suggested that, the surface Zn centers constituted the active sites for propane activation [15], [16].

To further verify above speculation, the reaction was conducted over ZnNbO oxides with different molar ratio of ZnO/Nb2O5 mixing with ZnO (Fig. S4). Below 3.0, the introduction of ZnO led to an increased activity, e.g.: propane conversion increased from 6.6 wt.% to 18.3 wt.% while propylene yield increased from 4.5 wt.% to 14.2 wt.% at a molar ratio of 0.1, demonstrating that ZnO promotes propane dehydrogenation. C3H8 pulse adsorption–desorption experiment (Fig. S5) also showed that the adsorbed quantity (proportional to the area of hysteresis loop) of propane increased with increasing molar ratio of ZnO/Nb2O5. Based on above results, it was concluded that the existence of ZnO enhanced the adsorption capacity of propane which is advantageous to dehydrogenation reaction.
The results of stability test over the catalyst with the optimum formulation were displayed in Fig. S6 and Fig. S7. Both propane conversion and propylene yield dropped sharply with prolonged reaction time. After 1 h, only 9.8 wt.% propane conversion along with 5.4 wt.% propylene yield were maintained. Meanwhile, as the product of pyrolysis and cracking reaction, the formation of methane and ethylene was still the same, so their selectivity increased with TOS. As tabulated in Table S1, 28.5 wt.% carbon was detected on the surface after reaction for 1 h. Due to the small surface area of the catalyst, the active sites are easy to be covered by carbon deposition, resulting in dramatically declined activity. Though the activity can be largely recovered after regeneration, propylene yield decreased from 28.1 wt.% to 23.8 wt.% with increased reaction–regeneration cycles, suggesting that there are other causes leading to the catalyst deactivation.
As shown in Fig. 1(c), the intensity of ZnO declined while that of ZnNb2O6 strengthened significantly with prolonged reaction time and after regeneration. XPS results also showed that after reaction, the surface molar ratio of Zn/Nb decreased. Based on the premise, we think that the formation of carbon deposition going against the contact of propane with active sites is the reason for the fast reversible deactivation of the catalyst. On the other hand, the loss of surface Zn species causes the irreversible deactivation. XRD patterns of ZnNbO oxides with high ZnO/Nb2O5 (6.0 and 10.0) before and after reaction (Fig. 1(d)) and ZnNbO oxides with 3:1 molar ratio calcined with longer time (Fig. S8) also showed an obvious increase in the intensity of ZnNb2O6 suggesting that larger ZnNb2O6 crystals are easier to form during the reaction or regeneration, at high calcination temperature or molar ratio of ZnO/Nb2O5. Besides, stronger lines of Zn3Nb2O8 were observed. Thus, combining with the decreased activity, it is inferred that the active ZnO species were lost to form Zn3Nb2O8 during reaction–regeneration cycles, contributing to catalyst irreversible deactivation.
On the grounds of foregoing experiments, a synergetic effect between ZnO and ZnNb2O6 over ZnNbO mixed oxides was proposed and a simple reaction pathway was presented in Fig. 5. ZnNb2O6 is the active site for propane dehydrogenation while ZnO enhances the adsorption capacity of propane on the catalyst. At low molar ratio of ZnO/Nb2O5 (below 2.0), small ZnNb2O6 crystals constitute the active sites for propane dehydrogenation. With increasing ratio (up to 3.0), dispersed ZnO sites increase and strengthen the adsorption capacity of propane, facilitating propane dehydrogenation. At high ratio (above 3.0), larger ZnNb2O6 or Zn3Nb2O8 (above 4.0) along with ZnO crystals form and decrease the active surface area, resulting in declined activity. This finding will help explain the catalytic behavior of ZnNbO oxides prepared with different calcination temperature and molar ratio of ZnO/Nb2O5.

4. Conclusions
This study has demonstrated that ZnNbO catalysts are highly active and selective in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. By comparing the performance of a series of ZnNbO catalysts, it is evident that the efficiency of the catalysts is closely related to the composition which is greatly affected by the calcination temperature and molar ratio of ZnO/Nb2O5. The optimal results, 28.1 wt.% propylene yield and 84% selectivity were achieved over the sample calcined at 600 °C with 3:1 molar ratio of ZnO/Nb2O5. Though the activity and stability are lower than the best Cr-based and Pt-based catalysts widely used in industry, the catalyst is more environment-friendly and cheaper.
A synergetic effect between ZnO and ZnNb2O6 of ZnNbO catalysts for propane dehydrogenation was also proposed. ZnNb2O6 is the active site for propane dehydrogenation and dispersed surface ZnO sites enhance the adsorption capacity of propane, while excessive ZnO leads to the formation of larger ZnNb2O6 or Zn3Nb2O8 along with ZnO crystals decreasing the active surface area and thus the reactivity. The fast reversible deactivation is ascribed to the formation of coke deposition covering the active surface, which can be made up by increasing the amount of catalyst. Although a simple treatment under air atmosphere can largely reactivate the catalyst, the loss of ZnO species leading to the formation of Zn3Nb2O8 contributed to the irreversible deactivation of the catalyst. Therefore, it seems that the preparation parameters of the catalysts have not been fully optimized and for improvement still remains.
