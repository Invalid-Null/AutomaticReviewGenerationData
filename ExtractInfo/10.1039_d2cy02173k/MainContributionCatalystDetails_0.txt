The document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically for the conversion of propane to propylene. It focuses on evaluating aluminum nitride (AlN) and gallium-doped aluminum nitride (Ga/AlN) as potential catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation in general via computational modeling, but does not provide experimental results showing enhancement of propylene production from propane. While it mentions propane dehydrogenation mechanisms, it does not actually implement AlN or Ga/AlN as catalysts to convert propane to propylene or report performance metrics like conversion, selectivity, yield, etc. for propylene production.
