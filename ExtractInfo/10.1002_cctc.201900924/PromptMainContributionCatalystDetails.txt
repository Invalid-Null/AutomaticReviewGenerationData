Abstract
Developing an economically viable and eco-friendly catalyst is essential for the dehydrogenation reaction. In this context, cobalt-based catalysts supported on different morphologies of γ-Al2O3, nano-sheet (Al2O3−NS), nano-fiber (Al2O3−NF) and nano-plate (Al2O3−NP) were synthesized using wetness impregnation method and tested for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction. Metal support interaction and Lewis acidic center play a crucial role in propane dehydrogenation reaction; therefore this study focuses on investigating the role of these parameters on the catalytic activity for cobalt-based catalysts. A higher metal support interaction was observed in Co/Al2O3−NS as compared to Co/Al2O3−NF and Co/Al2O3−NP. The presence of tetrahedral coordinated Co+2 in Co/Al2O3−NS leads to higher selectivity towards propylene. The formation of metallic cobalt from Co3O4 precursor present in Co/Al2O3−NP promoted side reactions to form lower hydrocarbons and carbon, which caused catalyst deactivation. In-situ DRIFTS analysis revealed the interaction of propane and propylene gases with the catalyst, which was an important revelation to find the source of carbon deposition.
1 Introduction
Propylene is one of the main building blocks of a wide range of polymeric products used in day-to-day life. Till the last century, the primary process for the production of propylene and other olefins was through naphtha steam cracking. This process is an energy-intensive, and downstream separation process inculcates high operating cost. In contrast, dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons is one of the promising routes to obtain olefins with high selectivity. Pt−Sn based catalyst is proven to be the most promising class for dehydrogenation reaction, which is also commercialized by Oleflex, UOP Honeywell. However, this catalyst suffers from deactivation due to coke deposition and metal attrition, which requires frequent regeneration of the catalyst. Another transition metal-based catalyst which is commercialized by Catofin uses Cr2O3 metal supported on Al2O3 with K and Na promotion. Indeed, this catalyst showed promising activity, but suffers from thermal sintering of the alumina support and possess environmental concern due to the presence of Cr (VI).1 Over the years, non-noble metal-based catalysts such as Ga, In, Zn, Mo, V, Fe, Co, and Ni in the form of metal oxide and metal have revealed promising behavior for the further development of these catalysts which has potential to be commercialized in future.2
Cobalt-based catalysts supported on SiO2 and Al2O3 have been widely accepted for their promising performance in the Fischer-Tropsch process and several other important reactions, as reported in the literature.3 In the last few decades, cobalt-based catalysts showed good performance for oxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction.4 Indeed, Wang et al. reported the robust activity for oxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction in a catalytic membrane reactor using Co/SiO2 based catalyst. This catalytic membrane reactor showed the highest activity with highly stable performance for 50 h of reaction with less coke deposition as compared to the values reported in the literature for oxidative propane dehydrogenation in a membrane reactor.5 However, the selectivity for olefins is low due to the formation of other oxidized products such as CO2 and CO. Nevertheless, all the reported studies based on cobalt uncovered the active sites and importance of support for the dehydrogenation process. In recent years, cobalt-based catalysts were also reported for non-oxidative dehydrogenation reaction supported on SiO2 and Al2O3. Isolated cobalt oxide prepared by organometallic route showed the highest selectivity for propylene at 550 °C, while the selectivity decreased at higher temperatures (650 °C).6 On the other hand, mesoporous cobalt aluminate spinel showed higher conversion and selectivity at 600 °C, owing to the well-dispersed Co+2 in the alumina matrix which revealed that the non-redox type nature of cobalt coordinated with alumina is an active phase for propane dehydrogenation. This was also supported using EXAFS study under reducing atmosphere and reaction condition.7 Sun et al., also studied the effect of different cobalt loading on alumina and found that 5 % loading of cobalt led to the formation of Co+2 in the tetrahedral geometry and the higher percentage of cobalt loading led to cracking reaction.8 Indeed the addition of sulfate group reduces the reduction of CoO to metallic cobalt and also enhances C−H bond activation.9 Yet in another study, Li et al. reported that an initial induction period was observed for the pre-reduced and fresh catalysts; however, reoxidation of the catalyst leads to the better selectivity and stability for the propane dehydrogenation reaction.10 So far, from all the studies reported in the literature, it can be inferred that various aspects such as the effect of cobalt loading, the addition of promoter, reoxidation and increasing the surface area of support have been examined. However, to the best of our knowledge, cobalt supported on different morphologies of alumina have not been investigated.
Alumina is a quintessential class of acidic support known to be widely used in both research and industrial application. Alumina can be obtained in both amorphous and crystalline form, and increasing the crystallinity improves thermal stability. γ-Al2O3 has been extensively used in catalysis which consists of a mixture of AlO6 and AlO4 units. The modification of physical and chemical properties affects the interaction of metal as well as interaction of reactants and products. A wider range of morphologies of nanostructured alumina has attracted considerable attention in the past. Alumina as support offers high thermal and hydrothermal stability, varying pore diameters and exposure of various high energy facets. It was also found that bare alumina showed high activity for dehydrogenation of isobutane.11 Recently another study showed the structure-activity relationship on gamma-alumina.12 It was found that nano-shape morphology enhances the metal dispersion, thus improving the interaction with the support. For dehydrogenation reaction, the morphology effect has also been studied to understand the structure-activity relationship.13 Shi et al. investigated the difference in the performance between commercial gamma-alumina and penta-coordinated alumina nano-sheets.14
From the above works reported in the literature, it is evident that the morphology of the support indeed plays an important role in terms of improving metal support interaction which enhances the catalytic stability for several high-temperature reactions including propane dehydrogenation. This study focuses on investigating the effect of the interaction of cobalt with different morphologies of alumina support for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction. We aim at studying the effect of surface properties of alumina on cobalt oxidation states, the reducibility of cobalt oxide species and the performance of the catalyst and also to investigate the role of Lewis acidic centers on the cobalt support interaction and carbon deposition. The causes of catalyst deactivation will be discussed to understand the key factors leading to the lower selectivity and stability of the cobalt-based catalyst supported on Al2O3. Lastly, the interaction of propane and propylene will be discussed from the data obtained using in-situ DRIFTs analysis.
2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterizations of Al2O3 and Co/Al2O3
2.1.1 XRD Analysis
The hydrothermal method has been widely accepted for the preparation of different morphologies of both metal oxide as supports and catalysts.15 Modification of hydrothermal temperature, pH of the solution, and crystallization time leads to different degrees of crystallinity, and crystal size. Herein, XRD analysis of reduced catalyst was done to find the crystal size and the presence of different phases of cobalt and Al2O3.16 The standard peak position and facets are indicated using a reference XRD pattern from the database using Co3O4 (#43-1003), Co (#01-1278) and Al2O3 (#34-0493). The diffraction peaks at 2θ value (facets) of 32° (220), 37° (311), 39° (222), 46°(400), 61° (511) and 67° (440) planes of γ-Al2O3 are observed in reduced samples of cobalt supported Al2O3, as shown in Figure 1. Other phases, such as CoO and CoAl2O4, are hard to be distinguished by XRD analysis.17 From the peak intensity, it can be deduced that a higher degree of crystallinity is achieved by alumina nano-fiber followed by nano-plate. In contrast, the alumina nano-sheet showed low intensity broader peaks and very weak peak intensity at (222) planes indicating the higher degree of disorder, which was also reported in the literature.18

XRD patterns of reduced samples for Co/Al2O3−NS, Co/Al2O3−NF, and Co/Al2O3−NP
The reduced Co/Al2O3−NP catalyst showed small intensity diffractions at 2θ value of 44.4 and 51.6 degree of metallic cobalt, and these peaks are not distinguishable in Co/Al2O3−NS and Co/Al2O3−NF probably due to lower cobalt loading. The XRD patterns of the alumina support alone and calcined Co/Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Figure S1. After cobalt impregnation on alumina, there is a small shift in 2θ to lower value which was indicated by dotted line; this shift in 2θ value after cobalt insertion is an indication of an increase in crystal cell size. The crystallite size of Al2O3 was calculated for both catalyst and support, as depicted in Table 1. The Al2O3−NS consists of smaller crystals, which increased slightly in the cobalt-containing reduced catalyst due to cobalt insertion in the crystal lattice of Al2O3. Further, the characterizations will be discussed in the proceeding sections to identify the presence of different species of cobalt present in the catalysts.

2.1.2 Morphology and Textural Properties
The TEM images of the catalyst after cobalt impregnation are shown in Figure 2. The catalyst synthesized using urea and hydrothermal treatment at 100 °C gave a nano-sheet like morphology (Figure 2(a)); the solution where ammonia was used with pH=5.5 under hydrothermal treatment at 200 °C for 48 hours yielded nano-fiber like morphology (Figure 2(b)) and the solution with ammonia of pH=8.5 and hydrothermal treatment at 200 °C for 24 hours yielded nano-plate-like shape (Figure 2(c)), which consisted of different sizes of plates. All the morphologies were well-maintained even after cobalt impregnation and calcination at 700 °C temperature indicating the higher thermal stability of catalyst support.

The specific surface areas of all samples were determined by N2 adsorption-desorption of the prepared alumina support of different morphology, as shown in Figure S2 (a). The pore size distributions obtained from the desorption branch of the isotherms, using the BJH method are shown in Figure S2 (b) and all, the surface parameters are shown in Table 1. The values of surface area decreased in case of Al2O3−NS after cobalt oxide impregnation, whereas Al2O3−NF and Al2O3−NP showed a lower decrease in the surface area. The reduction in surface area can be due to the occupancy of cobalt oxide inside the pores of Al2O3−NS, thereby blocking the available pores in the fresh support. The Al2O3−NF and Al2O3−NP showed higher pore size distribution which is due to the interparticle pores as the surface is non-porous.
2.1.3 Temperature Programmed Reduction (TPR) Analysis
The extent of reducibility of metal oxide is an indication of the strength of metal- support interaction.19 In general, for Co/Al2O3, a higher metal support interaction directly corresponds to the difficulty in reducing metal oxides to form metallic cobalt sites. Cobalt contains few possibilities for reduction into lower oxidation states, and this reduction occurs in two-step Co+3→Co+2→Co0.20 The desired active site for propane dehydrogenation reaction is reported to be the Co+2 or CoO.8 Therefore, TPR analysis was done on all the fresh samples, and Figure 3 depicts the obtained H2 consumption profiles against temperature. In Co/Al2O3−NS sample, mainly three reduction peaks being observed; the lower temperature peak at 545 °C corresponds to the reduction of Co3O4 to CoO, medium temperature peak at 698 °C corresponds to the reduction of CoO to metallic Co. And a higher temperature peak for the reduction of cobalt in spinel CoAl2O4.3b, 17, 20a Further for Co/Al2O3−NF and Co/Al2O3−NP samples, the lower reduction temperature peak shifted to even lower temperature, and a broad reduction peak is observed in both the samples, which is a combination of two-step reduction process where Co+2 is an intermediate phase. Therefore, from TPR analysis, it can be deduced that the three catalysts showed distinctive reduction temperature, which is an indication of different strengths of metal-support interaction. The lower temperature broader peak for Co/Al2O3−NP indicates lesser metal support interaction due to the formation of bigger crystals of Co3O4, as shown in XRD patterns of unreduced samples (Figure S1). The reaction temperature chosen is 600 °C, therefore, it is expected that the cobalt oxide in Co/Al2O3−NF and Co/Al2O3−NP can be partially reduced to metallic cobalt under the pre-reduction step and also during the reaction condition in the presence of hydrocarbons or hydrogen produced during the reaction. In Co/Al2O3−NS, the peak shifted to a slightly higher temperature indicating the reduction of strongly interacted CoO, which will be reduced to metallic cobalt at a higher temperature (>600 °C) and it might be possible that only cobalt oxide species are present for this sample under the reaction conditions.

2.1.4 UV-Vis Spectroscopy
The UV-Vis spectrum for the all Co/Al2O3 catalysts is shown in Figure 4. The three distinctive peaks located at 535, 580, 630 nm can be ascribed to the 4 A2(F)→4T1(P) d-d transition of tetrahedral Co+2 species which is present in all the samples with different intensities.21 Co/Al2O3−NS and Co/Al2O3−NF samples shows higher intensities at the three positions whereas Co/Al2O3−NP shows lower intensity peaks with the broad band at 720 nm and 420 nm indicative of octahedral Co+2 species. Similar peaks are observed for Co/Al2O3−NF as well. The Co/Al2O3−NS catalyst consists of Co+2 mostly in the tetrahedral state, Co/Al2O3−NF consists of a mixture of Co+2 in the tetrahedral and octahedral state, and Co/Al2O3−NP consists mostly of octahedral state originated from the Co3O4 as a precursor with a small intensity of tetrahedral Co+2 peaks. Different colors were visibly observed for the three catalysts varying from sky blue to dark green. The change in color is an indication of different coordination of CoO present in the catalyst.22 This analysis will help to generate a correlation between the activity, different coordination states of cobalt, and the distinctive role of tetrahedral and octahedral coordinated Co+2 in dehydrogenation reaction.23

2.1.5 XPS Analysis
XPS analysis was carried out for all the samples reduced at 400–600 °C as reported in the experimental section. This analysis was done to find out the distribution of oxidation states of cobalt existing on the catalysts, the obtained binding energy (BE) profiles are presented in Figure 5. The XPS spectrum of reduced catalyst was de-convoluted to identify the presence of different cobalt species. As shown in Figure 5, the Co/Al2O3−NP and Co/Al2O3−NF showed mainly 2 kinds of BEs, firstly at 778.3±0.2 eV attributed to the Co0 and at ∼781 eV corresponding to co-existence of Co+2/Co+3 species.24 The absence of BE at 778.3±0.2 eV, which belongs to the metallic Co species in Co/Al2O3−NS can be explained using the reduction profiles presented in Figure 3 wherein Tmax for lower temperature reduction peak is around 545 °C. This observation also supports the presence of metallic cobalt, as shown in XRD section 2.1.1 and discussed in section in 2.1.3 where Co/Al2O3−NP showed broad and low-temperature reduction peak. The main peak of Co 2p3/2 in the calcined sample was decomposed into two peaks, one for Co+3 at ∼780±0.7 eV and Co+2 at ∼781±0.9 eV, as shown in Figure S3.25, 26 This spectrum shows the presence of a mixture of both Co+3 and Co+2, respectively. The Co 2p consists of the doublet peaks at 781.6 and 797.3 eV corresponding to 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively which arises by spin-orbital coupling.17, 26, 27 The difference of 15.7 eV corresponds to the formation of Co+2 species, and this value is typically for paramagnetic compounds formed due to multiplet splitting, and this value is very close to the values reported in the literature.28

2.1.6 Pyridine-FTIR
The presence of Lewis acidic center plays an important role in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The primary objective behind performing pyridine adsorption was to identify the acidic nature of the supports and catalysts. To investigate the surface acidity of supports and catalysts, pyridine was used as a probe molecule for FTIR study to correlate the catalytic activity with surface acidity.29 There are several possible ways in which pyridine interacts with the surface oxides and shows band spectrum in the IR region of 1650–1400 cm−1.29, 30 Diluted pyridine was adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst till the surface is saturated. For all the samples, including support and catalyst, the first dose of pyridine was introduced, following which a series of peaks were observed, as shown in Figure 6 (a) and (b). In all the spectra, there was no distinguishable peak at 1540 cm−1 corresponding to the Brønsted acidic center. The different ranges of Lewis acidic centers are observed, ν19a vibrational mode between 1445–1435 cm−1 and ν8a vibration region 1630–1590 cm−1.31

Further, the discussion will be based on the presence of different types of Lewis acidic centers present on support and the changes in the sites after the metal impregnation. The different types of Lewis acidic centers are categorized into four distinctive peaks.32 The peak at 1590 cm−1 corresponds to adsorption of pyridine at weak Lewis acidic sites and also known as octahedral coordinated Al+3. The other peaks at 1620–1622 cm−1 and 1612 cm−1 indicate the presence of tetrahedral coordinated Al+3 forming strong and medium Lewis acidic centers, respectively.33 Indeed, the peak at 1622 cm−1shows the presence of tetrahedral Al+3 site with cation vacancy in the neighborhood. Also, the peak at around 1575 cm−1 belongs to other types of adsorbed pyridine. The region between 1575–1630 cm−1 was further magnified and de-convoluted into four different peaks to calculate the percentage distribution of different types of acidic center on the support and catalysts. The percentage of strong Lewis acidic center with tetrahedral coordinated Al+3 followed the order Al2O3−NS> Al2O3−NF> Al2O3−NP, as shown in supporting information Figure S3 (a). The Lewis acidic center percentage distribution for Co/Al2O3 was measured after impregnating cobalt on Al2O3 and shown in Figure S3 (b). From XPS analysis, it was shown that cobalt exists in Co+2 state in the form of CoAl2O4 and also from UV-Vis spectra, tetrahedral coordinated cobalt was identified. The spinel structure formed partially covers the tetrahedral and octahedral sites of Al+3. An equal decrease in intensities of 1610 cm−1 was observed. Additionally, the shift in the band shows the change in the catalyst structure. The relative percentage distribution of different types of Lewis acidic center is shown in Table 2. From the Py-DRIFTs analysis, it can be concluded that Co/Al2O3−NS consists of an excess of strong Lewis acidic center. The correlation between the activity and presence of strong Lewis acidic center will be explained in the discussion section.

2.2 Catalytic Performance
Propane dehydrogenation reaction was investigated at 600 °C for cobalt supported on different morphologies of alumina. The conversion of propane and selectivity of propylene was calculated using equations indicated in the experimental section. To understand the role of Co+2, and Co+3 and Co0 in dehydrogenation reaction, the performance of both unreduced and reduced catalyst was investigated. Firstly, Figure 7(a) and (b) shows the catalytic performance of all reduced catalysts tested at 600 °C for 5 h. For Co/Al2O3−NS the initial conversion was 31 %, and the value decreased to around 17.6 % by the end of 5 h reaction. On the other hand, Co/Al2O3−NF showed initial lower conversion values of 37 %, which decreased to ∼10.8 %. Also, Co/Al2O3−NP showed the initial higher conversion of 41 %, which decreased to 7 % by the end of the reaction. Apart from the activity of the catalyst, the selectivity towards the propylene is crucial. The selectivity of Co/Al2O3−NS (∼81 %) was higher than the other two catalysts whereas the Co/Al2O3−NP showed the lowest selectivity ∼70 %. For this catalyst, it was also observed that there was a catalyst bed pressure build-up during the reaction. It is important to consider the gas phase cracking reaction at a higher temperature (600 °C) during the initial stages of the dehydrogenation reaction, which was observed in the preliminary study. Therefore, the reaction data was measured 30 min after the reactants were injected. This stage is known as the induction period, which was very well explained by Li et al. for propane dehydrogenation performed on Co/Al2O3 at different post-treatment conditions.10 The induction period was observed for Co/Al2O3−NF, and Co/Al2O3−NP whereas the Co/Al2O3−NS showed propylene production from the beginning of the reaction. The reduction temperature is also very crucial to obtain the Co+2 oxidation state; therefore, the reduction temperature used under this study was optimized to obtain better activity and selectivity.

Further, the catalytic activity of the unreduced catalysts was performed to show the difference in the performance with respect to reduced catalysts. Figure S4 shows the conversion and selectivity of unreduced catalysts. For Co/Al2O3−NP, the conversion slowly increased and reached higher values of 33 %, and during this process, the reactor pressure consistently increased finally leading to higher pressure buildup in the reactor, and the reaction was stopped. All the catalysts showed lower initial conversion, which increased with time indicating the in-situ reduction of Co3O4 in the presence of reducing gases. This study also showcased the key role of CoO in the reaction, as the presence of Co3O4 leads to lower conversion and selectivity values. For reference, the catalytic activity of bare Al2O3−NS support was also tested. The conversion of only bare support was significantly lower (6 %) with the selectivity of ∼68 %. The catalytic activity of only Al2O3 was reported in the literature for dehydrogenation revealing that Al2O3 in itself is also active for the reaction due to the availability of Lewis acidic sites.16
Since the performance of Co/Al2O3−NS was superior to the rest of the two catalysts, this catalyst was chosen to further investigate the stability at a lower reaction temperature of 550 °C. The catalyst showed 10 % conversion and 92 % selectivity, as shown in Figure 8. After the reaction, the coke deposition on the catalyst was found to be 0.13 mgcoke/gcat.min. The catalytic activity of the same catalyst was also tested at a different temperature, ranging from 550–625 °C with the catalytic performance obtained at every 25 °C increase in temperature (Figure S5). At 550 °C, although the conversion was only 10 % yet the selectivity was 92 %. With the increase in temperature, a decreasing trend in the value of selectivity and increasing conversion trend was observed. At higher temperature 625 °C, the selectivity towards propylene formation decreased due to the gas phase cracking reaction.

Additionally, the reusability of Co/Al2O3−NS catalyst was tested for three cycles, as shown in Figure 9. Each cycle was run for 5 hours with 1 hour regeneration step in the presence of diluted oxygen as an oxidant for the combustion of carbon. Although there was no significant decrease in selectivity, the initial conversion in the second cycle slightly decreased from the first cycle. The TEM image and Co 2p3/2 spectra of the spent catalyst obtained after cycle three are shown in Figure S6. From TEM images, it can be seen that carbon-nanotubes are detaching the metal from the surface of the support. The metal particle originates from the Co3O4 precursor, which is formed during the regeneration step in the presence of oxygen, as reported in the literature.34

2.3 In-situ DRIFTS Analysis for Co/Al2O3−NS Catalyst
The best performing catalyst, Co/Al2O3−NS was further investigated to find the interaction of propane and propylene over the Co/Al2O3−NS, using DRIFTS analysis. The catalyst was exposed to gaseous propane from 300 °C to 550 °C, and the spectrum was obtained, as shown in Figure 10 (a). Initially, several gas phase propane bands are observed at 2984, 1462, and 1370 cm−1.35 Moreover, other bands were also observed at 2981, and 2961 cm−1 which could be ascribed to νas (C−H) and νs (C−H) of methyl, 2901 cm−1 corresponding to 2δs (CH3), while the band at 2874 cm−1 belongs to ν(C−H) of methylene group.36 Besides, the bands at 1470 and 1391 cm−1 could be assigned to δas (C−H) and δs (C−H) of methyl, and 1484 cm−1 to δ(C−H) of methylene group.37 At 300 °C, one weak peak at 1580 cm−1 appeared which belongs to the carbonaceous products. With an increase in temperature, the intensity of this band increases and a new shoulder-like peak starts to evolve at 1565 cm−1 at 400 °C and becomes distinguishable at 550 °C, as indicated by dotted lines in Figure 10 (b). As reported previously by many studies in the presence of hydrocarbons, the peaks observed between 1585–1560 cm−1 belongs to carbonaceous products38 Furthermore, upon switching propane with He gas at 550 °C (Figure 10(c)), the bands at 2967 and 1370 cm−1 disappeared and a broad peak at 1585 cm−1 still appeared. Another experiment was performed where gaseous propylene was also flown at 550 °C. All the gaseous phase propylene was observed, and two peaks appeared at 1635 and 1458 cm−1, associated with the C=C stretching mode and the C−H deformation mode of olefin species, respectively. A new peak at 1580 cm−1 evolved due to the formation of carbon which is very prominent during the dehydrogenation reaction. The strong adsorption of reaction intermediates leads to cracking reaction producing methane and carbon (amorphous or graphitic). Therefore, it is possible that most of the carbon deposition and side reaction takes place from the strong adsorption of propylene and its intermediate. This phenomenon was also explained from DFT calculation reported in the literature, the first step of propane dehydrogenation is considered as the formation of the metal-alkyl bond which was even shown for Co (II) isolated catalyst. The propyl radical formed tend to crack, forming either propylene and hydrogen radical via β-H cleavage or lower alkanes such as methane via Co−C homolysis/β-H cleavage.39

2.4 Characterization of Spent Catalysts
All the catalysts showed deactivation over the period during the reaction. Therefore, it is crucial to find out the causes of deactivation. Firstly, the amount of coke deposition on each catalyst was found using TGA analysis and tabulated in Table 3. A lower coke deposition was observed in Co/Al2O3−NS whereas comparatively more coke deposition was observed for Co/Al2O3−NP. The nature of carbon formed during the PDH reaction was further evaluated using Raman spectroscopy and TEM. Raman spectroscopy was performed to find out the ordered and disordered carbon, as shown in Figure 11(b). In the Raman spectroscopy, basically there are two peaks observed, the band represented as D-band corresponds to disordered carbon and the G-band belongs to ordered carbon. A higher intensity peak for G-band was observed in Co/Al2O3−NP. On the other hand, Co/Al2O3−NF showed higher intensity peak for D-band, indicating the formation of more disordered carbon and graphitic carbon. The D-and G-band intensities were comparatively lower in the case of Co/Al2O3−NS, elucidating the lower carbon deposition on the catalyst. Comparing the intensities of D- and G-band, the ratio of ID/IG in the three catalysts followed the order: Co/Al2O3−NF> Co/Al2O3−NS>Co/Al2O3−NP.

TEM analysis of all the spent catalyst was done, as shown in Figure 12 (a), (b) & (c). The carbon nanotubes formation was severe in Co/Al2O3−NP catalyst. This is also an indication that the cobalt particle size formed on nano-sheet was smaller compared with nano-plates. On the other hand, some filamentous carbon was also observed in Co/Al2O3−NF. Additionally, the XRD analysis of spent catalyst was also performed to find the changes in the phases of the three catalysts as compared to the reduced catalysts (Figure S8). There was no distinguishable filamentous carbon peak observed at ∼26° in both Co/Al2O3−NS and Co/Al2O3−NF; however Co/Al2O3−NP showed a distinctive filamentous carbon peak. Another change observed is the presence of metallic cobalt in Co/Al2O3−NF, and Co/Al2O3−NP whereas no metallic cobalt peak was observed in Co/Al2O3−NS after 5 h of reaction.

In propane dehydrogenation reaction, cracking is one of the major side reactions, which leads to the formation of lower hydrocarbons such as methane and ethane/ethylene. This comes from the cracking of propylene formed rather than propane. The presence of metallic cobalt promotes the growth of carbon nanotubes, which was also reported by other studies. The presence of weakly interacting cobalt oxide on the surface of support leads reduction of CoO/Co3O4 to form metallic cobalt, which enhances the cracking reaction. The propylene and other lower hydrocarbon formed during the reaction are more prone to cracking reaction than the propane itself, which leads to carbon deposition. The carbon formed can either be in the amorphous form or graphitic in the form of carbon nanotubes. For example, the methane produced during the reaction undergoes cracking to form solid carbon and hydrogen. This carbon encapsulates the metal formed due to the reduction of cobalt oxide and grows in the form of filamentous carbon.40 The uncontrolled growth of carbon nanotubes causes catalyst bed expansion, which leads to complete blocking in severe cases, as was also observed in case of Co/Al2O3−NP.
2.5 Discussion
Development of catalysts based on transition metals such as Fe, Zn and, Co for propane dehydrogenation reaction requires metal oxide as an active site (Co+2, Fe+3, and Zn+2). The metal oxide phase is active for the production of propylene, otherwise promotes side reaction such as cracking. Cobalt-based catalysts reported for dehydrogenation reaction have shown that a highly dispersed Co(II) in tetrahedral coordination with the support is promising for the production of olefins. However, it suffers from deactivation due to the formation of metallic cobalt during the reaction, which produces carbon, and this carbon formed deposits on the active sites.
From the performance of propane dehydrogenation under this study, it was found that Co/Al2O3−NS showed better activity and stability than the Co/Al2O3−NF and Co/Al2O3−NP catalysts. The Co/Al2O3−NS showed higher surface area, which increased the availability of cobalt (II) oxide in the tetrahedral coordination with alumina on the support; this was evident from the UV-Vis and XPS analysis. The presence of strong Lewis acidic center with cationic vacancy also enhanced the interaction of cobalt with support. This can also be verified from TPR analysis which showed the peak with higher reduction temperature. The strong metal support interaction prevented the formation of metallic cobalt during the pre-reduction step and also during the reaction. Moreover, the catalyst showed good stability at a lower temperature(550 °C) as the gas phase cracking is suppressed at a lower temperature.
In contrast, the Co/Al2O3−NP showed the lowest selectivity towards propylene due to the presence of metallic cobalt as shown from XRD and XPS analysis. Additionally, this catalyst also consists of a lower fraction of tetrahedral Co+2 species after the reduction step, observed from UV-Vis analysis where weak intensity peaks appeared in the range of 400–630 nm. The formation of bigger Co3O4 was a precursor for metallic cobalt during the pre-reduction and reaction, thus decreasing the interaction with the support. This catalyst also contains a lower percentage of strong Lewis acidic center when compared to Co/Al2O3−NS and Co/Al2O3−NF, as shown in Table 2.
There are possibly two causes of catalyst deactivation during propane dehydrogenation reaction; one due to the formation of metallic cobalt which promotes the side reaction thereby increasing the coke deposition and secondly, due to carbon deposition on the excess of Lewis acidic center. From the characterization of spent catalysts such as Raman spectroscopy, TEM images, and XRD analysis, the nature of coke formed was elucidated. The formation of filamentous carbon was severe in the case of Co/Al2O3−NP due to the formation of metallic cobalt. This type of catalyst is not easy to be regenerated as it lead to loss of metal particle in contact with the support. On the other hand, the Co/Al2O3−NF showed the formation of both filamentous carbon and amorphous carbon. The Co/Al2O3−NS catalyst also showed carbon deposition with time and leads to lower activity by the end of the reaction.
3 Conclusions
In this study, Co/Al2O3 was successfully prepared via wetness impregnation method on different morphologies of alumina, including nano-sheet, nano-fiber, and nano-plate. Effect of cobalt-Al2O3 interaction on different morphologies of Al2O3 was studied for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation reaction. Various characterization techniques used such as XRD, BET, TEM, TPR, UV-Vis, XPS, and Py-FTIR showed the distinctive properties of the two catalysts. Cobalt existed as Co (II) species strongly interacted with Al2O3 in Co/Al2O3−NS which showed higher activity compared to the Co/Al2O3−NF and Co/Al2O3−NP catalysts. The presence of Co3O4 in Co/Al2O3−NP and weaker interaction with support were responsible for the formation of metallic Co during reduction and propane dehydrogenation reaction. The in-situ DRIFTS analysis on Co/Al2O3−NS showed the interaction of propane and propylene with catalyst and the major side reaction occurs from the strong adsorption of propylene. Carbon deposition on Co/Al2O3−NS led to the deactivation of the catalyst with time. For further development of cobalt based catalyst, lower cobalt loading should be preferred, and modification of support with TiO2, ZrO2 or SiO2 might help to suppress the strong Lewis acidic center and prevent coke deposition. The in-situ studies can be performed to understand the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation on Co/Al2O3 catalysts.
Experimental Section
Catalysts Synthesis
5 wt % of cobalt supported on alumina was prepared by adding the stoichiometric amount of cobalt nitrate and alumina in 10 ml water followed by stirring for 30 min. The solution was slowly dried at 120 °C in a heating bath finally calcined at 700 °C for 4 h in air atmosphere. Alumina support with different morphologies were prepared by hydrothermal treatment. The samples were denoted as Co/Al2O3−NS for nano-sheet, Co/Al2O3−NF for nano-fiber and Co/Al2O3−NP for nano-plate.
For the synthesis of alumina nano-sheet (Al2O3−NS), 6.44 g of aluminum nitrate was dissolved in 50 mL DI water and then 30 mL of urea solution was added to it. The mixture was stirred and then transferred to 180 mL autoclave and kept at 100 °C for 48 h, this was prepared by following the procedure as reported in the literature.14 It was also found during the synthesis that the formation of nanosheet is critical with the hydrothermal condition if the condition is changed then agglomerated sheets or bundled sheets will be formed along with nanosheet.
The alumina nano-fibers (Al2O3−NF) were prepared by the method reported previously,41 as follows dissolving 30 g of alumina nitrate in 50 mL water and the pH was maintained at 5.5 by adding aqueous NH4OH solution. Then, the solution was transferred to 200 mL autoclave and hydrothermal at 200 °C for 48 h. Similarly, alumina nano-plates (Al2O3−NP) were synthesized by adding 15 g of alumina precursor in 100 mL water and the pH was maintained at 8.5 and the solution was hydrothermally treated at 200 °C for 48 h, this method was also reported by our group. For all the support, the precipitate was washed with DI water and dried in oven at 80 °C and calcined at 600 °C for 4 h in air atmosphere.
Characterizations of Al2O3 and Co/Al2O3
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all calcined supports and catalysts were carried out in Shimadzu XRD-6000 powder diffractometer using X-ray Source Cu target Kα-ray for 2θ values of 20–80° with a scanning rate of 2° min−1.
The textural properties of the alumina support and catalyst were measured using N2 adsorption/desorption measurement (ASAP 2020) Micromeritics. The specific surface area and pore size distributions were calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) and Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) methods, respectively. The catalysts were initially degassed under helium at 300 °C for a minimum of 6 hour to remove the impurities before measurement.
Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM, LaB6 electron gun, JEOL-2010 and 200 kV) was used to visually observe the morphology of all support and catalyst. Before the analysis, the samples were ultra-sonicated for 15 min in ethanol solution followed by dispersing in a copper grid and then dried at 60 °C for 10 min.
To study the oxidation state of fresh and reduced catalyst, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was done on Kratos AXIS Ultra by using mono-chromatized Al Kα radiation as the X-ray source (1486.71 eV) at a constant dwell time of 100 ms and a pass energy of 40 eV. The X-ray source at a reduced power of 75 watts (15 kV and 5 mA) was run. The working pressure in the analysis chamber was maintained at 5×10–9 Torr. The core level signals were obtained at a photoelectron take-off angle of 90°. All the samples were preheated at 600 °C under helium and then prepared for the analysis. The binding energy was referenced to C 1 s hydrocarbon peak at 284.5 eV.
Thermo-Scientific TPDRO 1100 series system equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used for H2 Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) measurements for the catalysts. 100 mg of the sample was tested with a flow of 5 % hydrogen in nitrogen (30 ml/min) with a temperature ramping rate of 10 °C/min after degassing with helium for 10 min. Followed by ramping up to 950 °C and hold at this temperature for 5 min and then cooled down to room temperature.
Diffuse reflectance UV-Visible (DRUV-Vis) was performed for catalyst in a Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer. Barium sulphate (BaSO4) was used as reference material. The samples was placed in a flat holder and added to the cell. The spectra was measured between 300–800 nm.
The carbon residue on the spent catalyst after the propane dehydrogenation reaction was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) coupled with DTA (differential thermal analysis) on a Shimadzu DTG-60 thermogravimetric analyzer. A fixed weight of spent catalyst was heated in static air to 950 °C with a ramping rate of 10 °C/min and its weight was monitored with temperature.
Xplora Plus Microscope Raman (HORIBA, Japan) using a laser beam excitation of k=632.81 nm was used to investigate the types of carbon formed on the catalyst after the reaction, mainly graphitic and amorphous types. A fixed amount of sample was taken and the spectrum was analyzed between 0–2500 cm-1 Raman shift ranges.
Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) experiment was conducted in a Bruker FTIR Vertex 70 spectrometer using Harrick Praying Mantis DRIFTS gas cell equipped with ZnSe windows and a controlled gas system capable of carrying out a reaction at the higher temperature. The catalyst was firstly treated at 550 °C for 1 hour and then cooled down to 150 °C. The background signal was captured, and then pyridine was flown via helium as a carrier gas, and then adsorption spectrum was obtained with the He flow rate of 30 mL/min. After adsorption for 30 min, the Pyridine desorption was done by flowing only He for another 30 min, and the spectrum was obtained.
For in-situ DRIFTS of propane adsorption on Co/Al2O3−NS with following steps : (1) heating the sample from 50 °C to 500 °C in the presence of He, (2) reduction at 400 °C for 30 min same as reaction condition with 10 ml/min H2 flow rate, followed by reduction at 600 °C for 10 min (same as pre-reduction step) (3) cool down to 300 °C and flow He, (4) propane flow starts at 300 °C for 60 min followed by desorption for 60 min, (5) increase the temperature to 550 °C, adsorption of propane for 60 min followed by desorption under helium. The background was taken at 50 °C and for all other steps the spectrum was taken at each step. The similar steps were also performed for propylene adsorption and desorption at 550 °C.
Catalytic Activity Measurement
The propane dehydrogenation reaction was performed in a fixed bed quartz tube reactor of 10 mm diameter and 30 cm in length. 0.3 g of catalyst was used for the reaction which was diluted with a certain amount of silicon dioxide (quartz form) to maintain the uniform distribution of catalyst along the reactor and maintain same GHSV for all the catalysts. Before reaction the sample was heated to 600 °C under He for testing the performance of unreduced catalyst. For reduced sample testing, the samples were pre-treated at 400 °C for 30 min under H2 (20 %) and He (80 %), and heating up to 600 °C for 10 min before the reaction under the same hydrogen atmosphere. The total gas inlet flow rate was measured to be 30 mL/min. All the gases (CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, C3H8, H2) were analyzed using Agilent GC equipped with Hayesep-D column. For regeneration step of reduced catalyst, after the reaction, 6 % oxygen with He was flown for 1 hour at 600 °C and then the catalyst was reduced using the same condition as before heated to 600 °C for the reaction.
