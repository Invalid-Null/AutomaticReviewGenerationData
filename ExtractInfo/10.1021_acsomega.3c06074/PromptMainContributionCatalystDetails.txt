Utilizing Heteroatom Types and Numbers from Extensive Ligand Libraries to Develop Novel hERG Blocker QSAR Models Using Machine Learning-Based Classifiers
Abstract
The human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel plays a crucial role in membrane repolarization. Any disruptions in its function can lead to severe cardiovascular disorders such as long QT syndrome (LQTS), which increases the risk of serious cardiovascular problems such as tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Drug-induced LQTS is a significant concern and has resulted in drug withdrawals from the market in the past. The main objective of this study is to pinpoint crucial heteroatoms present in ligands that initiate interactions leading to the effective blocking of the hERG channel. To achieve this aim, ligand-based quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR) models were constructed using extensive ligand libraries, considering the heteroatom types and numbers, and their associated hERG channel blockage pIC50 values. Machine learning-assisted QSAR models were developed to analyze the key structural components influencing compound activity. Among the various methods, the KPLS method proved to be the most efficient, allowing the construction of models based on eight distinct fingerprints. The study delved into investigating the influence of heteroatoms on the activity of hERG blockers, revealing their significant role. Furthermore, by quantifying the effect of heteroatom types and numbers on ligand activity at the hERG channel, six compound pairs were selected for molecular docking. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations and per residue MM/GBSA calculations were performed to comprehensively analyze the interactions of the selected pair compounds.

Despite advancements in diagnosis and treatment, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) continue to be the leading cause of death worldwide, as highlighted by the World Health Organization (WHO). The mortality rate related to CVD is a significant concern, as seen in countries like Russia, where the annual rate is 614 deaths per 100,000 individuals, placing it among the highest worldwide. (1) The human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG), which encodes voltage-gated potassium ion channels, plays a critical role in the repolarization of cardiac action potential in human cardiomyocytes. (2) These potassium channels (KV) are integral membrane proteins that serve vital functions in various physiological processes. They are involved in generating nerve impulses, regulating neuronal excitability, cardiac pacemaking, and modulating muscular contractility. The channels are composed of homotetramers, each with six transmembrane segments (S1–S6). The voltage sensing domain (VSD) comprises segments S1 to S4, while the pore domain (PD) consists of S5, S6, the P-loop, and the selectivity filter (SF) that facilitates the permeation of K+ ions (Figure 1).

Prolonged ventricular repolarization caused by hERG channel blockade can increase the risk of cardiac damage, as evident by an extended QT interval on electrocardiography (ECG). Paradoxically, the use of antiarrhythmic medications to prolong QT intervals poses one of the highest risk of potentials. This risk has been also observed across various drug classes, including antihistamines, antipsychotics, antibiotics, and gastrointestinal stimulants. (3) Notably, medications such as cisapride (a serotonin receptor agonist), quinidine (an antiarrhythmic), astemizole, and terfenadine (both antihistamines) have either been withdrawn from the market or highly restricted due to their potential cardiotoxicity associated with hERG channel blockage. (4) These regulatory actions emphasize the significance of hERG-related risks and underscore the need to monitor and control the use of medications that may interfere with cardiac repolarization. Consequently, the hERG potassium ion channel has become a crucial therapeutic target, leading to the prioritization of screening drugs for their interaction with the hERG channel during the early stages of drug design. International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) regulations now require the evaluation of drug candidates for their ability to block the hERG channel during preclinical testing. (5) This evaluation has become a pivotal aspect in the initial phases of drug research to ensure the safety and efficacy of new drugs, particularly concerning their potential to cause adverse effects on cardiac repolarization. (6) By conducting a rigorous screening of hERG channel function, researchers can identify and eliminate drug candidates with unfavorable interactions, ultimately reducing the risk of cardiotoxicity and enhancing patient safety. In recent years, multiple mechanisms associated with QT prolongation have been discovered, highlighting the complexity beyond hERG channel blockade. (7) Despite the long-standing recommendation by international regulatory agencies since 2005 to assess the inhibitory effect of new drugs on the hERG channel in preclinical settings, (8) research continues to uncover additional factors influencing QT prolongation.
The comprehensive evaluation of QT prolongation risk, utilizing the multiple ion channel effect model that considers sodium and calcium channel blocking alongside the hERG channel assay, proves to be more robust than relying solely on the hERG assay for assessing drug safety. However, a significant number of currently available drugs undergo evaluation using only the hERG assay during the preclinical stage. As a result, efforts have been made to assess the risk of drug-induced QT prolongation at the preclinical and clinical level. Despite initiatives like crediblemeds.org, which aims to provide an updated list of QT-prolonging drugs, there are still instances where drugs with unknown risks of QT prolongation continue to be prescribed. (9)
Presently, the assessment of hERG-associated cardiac toxicity involves employing in vitro and in vivo techniques to study the impact of potential hERG channel blockers and to understand their effects on channel permeability. While in vivo experiments offer comprehensive drug evaluations, their high cost, inefficiency, and conflict with the 3R principle (i.e., reduction, and refinement in animal studies) highlight the need to minimize their use. In recent years, in vitro assays have made progress in terms of duration and cost-effectiveness. (10,11) However, these methods also have limitations in investigating the underlying structural mechanisms responsible for observed outcomes. To address this challenge, computational techniques have emerged as a promising approach in drug design and development for evaluating the hERG-blocking potential of small compounds before conducting experiments. (12) Computational methods provide insights into the structural basis of the hERG channel blockade and can complement experimental approaches, contributing to a more efficient and informed drug discovery process. By utilizing computational modeling and simulations, researchers can prioritize and optimize potential drug candidates, reducing reliance on resource-intensive in vitro and in vivo experiments and ultimately accelerating the development of safer and more effective medications. (13−15)
In silico strategies, such as machine learning (ML)-based classifiers and structure-based modeling, offer valuable and reliable complements to experimental approaches in addressing the issue of hERG-associated cardiac toxicity. (16,17) These computational methods leverage large data sets and advanced algorithms to analyze the structural and functional properties of hERG channels and their interactions with potential blockers. By training machine learning models on experimental data, researchers can accurately predict the hERG-blocking potential of novel compounds. Additionally, structure-based modeling techniques enable detailed exploration of the binding interactions between compounds and hERG channels, providing insights into the mechanisms of channel blockade. Integrating in silico approaches with experimental studies not only enhances the understanding of hERG-associated cardiac toxicity but also facilitates the identification of safer and more effective drug candidates in a more efficient and cost-effective manner. (1) While ligand-based models can offer effective predictive performance, their utility in screening diverse compound classes could be constrained due to limitations in their applicability domain. (18) This restriction arises from their reliance on training sets with a limited number of closely related analogs. In this scenario, the utilization of target-driven based methods, which are known for enhanced interpretability, becomes a valuable strategy. (19) These approaches can be effectively integrated into consensus strategies alongside ligand-based classifiers. (20,21) Notably, over recent years, target-driven approaches such as molecular docking have gained prominence as an effective technique for developing classification models within the realm of predictive toxicology. This computational approach has found extensive usage in elucidating interactions between small-molecule ligands and the hERG channel. It is frequently employed in conjunction with additional computational techniques such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (22) and experimental methods like mutagenesis studies. (23,24) These combined efforts enable the pinpointing of specific residues responsible for drug binding within the hERG central cavity. Notably, residues such as Thr623, Ser624, Val625, Gly648, Tyr652, Phe656, and Phe557 have been identified as important amino acids for ligand interactions at the central cavity of the hERG channel. (3,25)
In the current study, ligand-based QSAR models were constructed using data on heteroatom types and numbers derived from extensive ligand libraries, incorporating information about chemical constitution and hERG channel blockage (i.e., pIC50 values). The QSAR models, developed using various methods, proved effective in identifying essential structural components influencing the compound activity. The investigation of heteroatoms highlighted their role in the hERG activity of blockers. By quantifying the impact of heteroatom types and number in a compound on the pIC50 value, six compound pairs were selected for docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and MM/GBSA calculations for a comprehensive analysis.

Figure 2. Overview of the employed methodology in this study.
2.1. Construction of Ligand Databases from ChEMBL
The ChEMBL database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) was employed to gather structural and biological activity data of known hERG blockers. As of November 2022, the database contained 14,364 available compounds with their corresponding IC50 values at the hERG channel. To standardize the activity values, the IC50 values were transformed into pIC50 by taking the negative logarithm (base 10) of each IC50 value. pIC50 is a widely used pharmacological indicator that quantifies the potency of a substance by measuring the concentration of a ligand required to inhibit a specific biological activity. To manage the extensive database, a subset of 508 compounds was selected among 14,364 compounds. In order to construct a subset database, a normal distribution curve was generated, encompassing a range of pIC50 values spanning from 2.07 to 9.85 (Figure S1). This subset included compounds with varying levels of activity, providing a balanced representation of low, moderate, and high activity within the smaller database (508 compounds).
2.2. Building QSAR Models
Schrodinger’s AutoQSAR module was employed to develop QSAR models, initially using DeepChem. (26) ML methods were used to create predictive models for the target data. To compare its efficiency with that of DeepChem, a similar process was repeated using the traditional QSAR method. Additionally, the CANVAS cheminformatics package was utilized to build QSAR models. Physicochemical descriptors were calculated from the molecular properties of the 508 structures to enhance model generation. For model generation, multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least-squares (PLS) regression, and kernel-based PLS regression (KPLS) were employed. The statistical results of the constructed models, such as R2 and Q2, were assessed to determine the most effective method. KPLS models were developed by using various types of fingerprints. The models that exhibited high scores for each fingerprint were selected, and scatter plots were used for visualization and atomic contribution analysis to identify influential substructures affecting activity of the compound.
2.3. Investigating the Heteroatom Types and Numbers
To identify heteroatom types and numbers that significantly influence hERG blockage, the CANVAS chemoinformatics package was utilized on each of the chemical structure of the ligand. To ensure statistical reliability, the compound clusters that contain at least 5 compounds were only considered for subsequent analyses. Median pIC50 values were calculated for each data set, and a Python script in the Spyder IDE (27) was executed to perform correlation analysis. The script examines how changes in specific heteroatom types and numbers, in the presence of other heteroatoms, correlate with changes in the pIC50 value. The resulting graphs illustrate the correlation between the pIC50 value and the number and types of heteroatoms. Comparisons and calculations were conducted between clusters (sets) with the same number of other heteroatoms while observing the variations in the specific heteroatom’s count within the structure. To determine significant effects, the number of other heteroatoms was kept constant, and the impact of a particular heteroatom count was examined. If a substantial effect of at least around one log unit was detected between the median pIC50 values of the compared sets, the compound with the highest pIC50 value was selected from the set with the higher median pIC50 value, while the compound with the lowest pIC50 value was chosen from the set with the lowest median pIC50 value.
2.4. Ligand Preparation
The LigPrep module of the Maestro molecular modeling package was employed to prepare the 508 ligands. (28) During the ligand preparation process, the protonation states of the compounds were calculated within a pH range of 7.0 ± 2.0 using the Epik module. (29,30) Compounds with chiral centers generated up to four distinct stereoisomers, and ionization states were considered for each molecule. To ensure accurate representation of molecular characteristics, the OPLS3e (31) force field was applied.
2.5. Protein Preparation
The cryo-EM structure of the hERG K+ channel (PDB ID: 5VA1) was obtained from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. (32) In this structure, the ion channel is in an open-like state (5VA1), and the voltage sensors exhibit a depolarized shape. Despite its relatively small size, the central cavity contains four deep hydrophobic pockets, which may explain the heightened sensitivity of the hERG channel to diverse ligand structures. To enable molecular docking and MD simulations, the channel was prepared using the Protein Preparation tool in the Maestro molecular modeling suite. (33) Before the MD simulations, three potassium ions and two water molecules were added to the SF of the channel. Additionally, missing side chains and loops were filled. The Maestro’s Prime module, (34,35) was employed to incorporate the missing loops and side chains into the residues. PROPKA (36,37) was used to add hydrogen atoms to the protein at physiological pH, ensuring accurate ionization states of amino acid residues. Structural optimization was then performed by using the OPLS3 force field with a convergence criterion of 0.3 Å RMSD for heavy atoms.
2.6. Receptor Grid Generation
The generation of a receptor grid is a crucial step in grid-based docking studies. It involves creating a 3D grid that represents the binding site of the receptor, which is necessary to evaluate the binding energy of ligands during docking simulations. The Receptor Grid Generation tool was utilized to identify the binding pocket (active site) in the structure. (38) The grid was generated by specifying key residues (i.e., Thr623, Ser624, Tyr652, Ala653, and Phe656) located at the centroid of selected residues (Figure 3A). The coordinates for the center of the grid were determined as (2.86, −5.97, −1.27) in the (x, y, z) coordinate system, respectively.

2.7. Molecular Docking
The docking simulations were conducted using the grid-base Glide docking algorithm, (39−41) which systematically explores the lowest energy conformation of the docked compound at the binding site of the receptor. The ligands underwent hierarchical filtration to assess the complementarity of the ligand–receptor system. Ligands that passed this phase underwent energy minimization and were assigned scores. Two docking protocols, Glide/SP and Glide/XP, were employed in this study. Standard parameters, including ligand sampling with nitrogen inversions and ring conformations, bias sampling of torsion for amides, and postdocking minimization of 5 poses for each ligand, were considered. On the other hand, Glide/XP performed deeper sampling, beginning with SP sampling before utilizing its own anchor-and-grow technique. It utilizes a more complex scoring algorithm, demanding a higher ligand–receptor shape complementarity. The Glide/XP docking is employed with standard settings using flexible ligand sampling, Epik state penalties incorporated into the docking score, and postdocking minimization of 10 poses. The docked poses were ranked based on docking scores, and only the top-scoring poses were selected for further analysis using MD simulations.
2.8. Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations
The molecules with the highest docking scores were subjected to MD simulations using Desmond. (42) The membrane-embedded structure (PDB ID: 5VA1) was obtained from the OPM database. (43) The system builder placed the hERG channel protein in an orthorhombic solvation box using the TIP3P solvent model (44) and a POPC membrane model at 310 K, Figure 3B. The simulations were conducted in the NPT ensemble at 310 K with a pressure of 1.01325 bar, maintained using a Nose–Hoover thermostat (45) and Martyina–Tobias–Klein barostat. (46) The system was balanced by adding Cl– ions and 0.15 M NaCl solution to achieve a pH of 7.4 and neutralize the simulation medium. Prior to the simulations, energy minimization and relaxation of the structure were employed in Desmond. Each MD simulation was conducted for 200 ns production run which generates 1000 trajectory frames. The relevant MD simulations data were collected individually and saved in trajectory files.
2.9. Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born Surface Area (MM/GBSA) Calculations
To calculate average binding free energy of each compound at the hERG channel used in MD simulations and to better understand the main differences between weak and strong inhibitors, MM/GBSA analysis was performed using Maestro’s Prime module. (34,35) A systematic approach was employed, wherein MM/GBSA calculations were performed using one frame out of every ten frames. The dielectric constant was defined using the VSGB 2.0 implicit solvation model, (47). After the calculations for each complex, the average MM/GBSA value and standard deviations for each compound were computed. Furthermore, to gain insight into the contribution of individual residues in the four chains of the hERG channel to the inhibitory activity and frequency of ligand–protein contacts, per-residue MM/GBSA analysis was conducted to calculate binding free energies on a residue level. This analysis provides more detailed information about the role of specific residues in the interaction between the ligands and the protein.
3. Results and Discussion

The main objective of this study is to create ligand-based QSAR models by utilizing heteroatom types and numbers from extensive ligand libraries, which encompass information about the chemical structure of ligands and their respective hERG channel blockage IC50 values. Furthermore, the study seeks to explore atomic-level features that enhance the affinity with the hERG channel and influence the inhibitory activity of compounds. A data set consisting of 14,364 hERG blocker compounds was collected from the ChEMBL database. In order to manage easily the constructed models, a smaller subset database was considered among 14,364 hERG blockers. For this aim, an evenly distributed biological activity of compounds was selected, which involved 508 compounds (Figure S1). To ensure the reliability of the collected IC50/pIC50 values, they were also cross-checked from scientific literature. These 508 compounds were selected to generate a normal distribution curve, which provides insights into the distribution of hERG-blocking potential within the data set. The pIC50 values for these compounds ranged from 2.07 to 9.85. QSAR models were constructed to investigate the relationship between the structure and activity of the hERG blocker compounds, providing valuable insights into the crucial structural elements that influence their activity. Various QSAR modeling techniques were employed to assess their effectiveness on the given data set. The results revealed that the models developed using traditional methods exhibited elevated R2 and Q2 values, indicating superior precision and predictability, albeit with lower or moderate ranking score values (Table S1). Similarly, models developed using the DeepChem method also performed well in terms of R2 and Q2 values but with lower ranking score values (Table S2). When constructing the QSAR models, having a reliable objective function, or “score″, becomes essential to distinguish between effective (i.e., stable) and ineffective QSAR models. In AutoQSAR, the quality of the models is evaluated based on their performance on specific training and test sets. The accuracy of a model is represented by a value between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates perfect predictions and 0 signifies entirely incorrect predictions. The model M is then scored accordingly:
score
M
=
accuracy
test
(1.0
−|
accuracy

−

(

|
This formula is designed to provide favorable scores to models that demonstrate high accuracy on both the training and test sets. Conversely, it penalizes models that exhibit low accuracy on either or both sets, as well as models that show substantial discrepancies in accuracy between the two sets. (26)
Consistency in the effectiveness of the models was observed across various descriptor sets and molecular fingerprints. Among the different methods compared, the KPLS approach outperformed PLS and MLR (Table S3). Consequently, QSAR models utilizing machine learning-based classifiers were developed using the KPLS method along with eight different fingerprints (atom pairs, atom triplets, dendritic, linear, MACCS, mol_print, radial, and topological). To assess the impact of each fingerprint type on the statistical scores of the constructed QSAR models, we employed the CANVAS tool. The same data set containing 508 hERG blocker compounds with their corresponding pIC50 values was used in CANVAS. The results showed that the KPLS approach, when using atom_triplets, MACCS, radial, and dendritic fingerprints, yielded low Q2 values (Table 1). However, other fingerprints like topological, mol_print, linear, and atom_pairs produced both high R2 and Q2 values. The models with superior statistical results for each fingerprint type are presented in Table 1.
Table 1. Performance Evaluation of Top KPLS-Based Fingerprint Models Generated by CANVAS
fingerprint type training set/test set ratio R2 Q2
atom_pairs 85%–15% 0.94 0.60
linear 85%–15% 0.90 0.54
topological 85%–15% 0.65 0.53
mol_print 75%–25% 0.56 0.50
dendritic 75%–25% 0.98 0.49
radial 75%–25% 0.70 0.49
MACCS 85%–15% 0.40 0.27
atom_triplets 80%–20% 0.99 0.17
Overall, these findings underscore the significance of successful QSAR modeling techniques, particularly the KPLS approach, in elucidating the structure–activity relationships of hERG blocker compounds. These models offer valuable insights into designing potent and precise molecules. The use of different fingerprints and modeling methods allows for a comprehensive analysis, leading to a better understanding of the data set’s characteristics. The QSAR models displayed a strong correlation between predicted and observed pIC50 values (Figure 4). These models effectively predicted the activity of both the training and test sets, demonstrating their efficacy in predicting the potency of hERG blocker compounds.

Additionally, an investigation into the influence of heteroatoms on the functionality of hERG inhibitors was undertaken, focusing on the quantity and variety of heteroatoms present in the compounds. Heteroatoms give rise to structures known as functional groups. These functional groups serve as points where molecules interact and where chemical reactivity occurs between distinct compounds. Thus, heteroatoms have the potential to bring about noteworthy changes in both the properties and reactivity of a molecule. (48) The LigFilter descriptors were computed using the CANVAS (49,50) excluding carbon and hydrogen atoms (i.e., considering only heteroatoms). This allowed for the determination of the number of heteroatoms in a data set comprising 508 compounds (Tables S4–S7), providing valuable insights into the heteroatom composition within the compounds under study. The analysis revealed that oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, and sulfur atoms were particularly important heteroatoms in the 508 selected compounds, modulating the inhibition activity of the hERG blockers. Oxygen atoms exhibited an inverse relationship with activity, as an increase in their number within the compounds led to decreased inhibition (Figure 5). Figure 6 depicts pIC50 values of selected compounds at the hERG channel versus the number of oxygen atoms within each compound. Compounds are selected based on the compound that their pIC50 values fit to the mean value in each set. Similarly, an increase in the chlorine atom number resulted in a slight decrease in activity (Figure S2). On the other hand, the presence of sulfur atoms displayed a positive correlation with activity, indicating that as the sulfur atom content increased within a compound, the pIC50 value also tended to increase (Figure S3). However, the presence of nitrogen atoms did not show a discernible impact on the biological activity, with no clear correlation between the pIC50 value and the number of nitrogen atoms in the compound. Nevertheless, a closer examination revealed that an increase in the number of nitrogen atoms from 1 to 3 within a compound resulted in a decrease in pIC50 values, but when the number of nitrogen atoms exceeded 3, the trend in pIC50 values showed an increase. Furthermore, when there were more than 5 nitrogen atoms in a compound, the pIC50 trend was not stable (Figure S4). These findings provide valuable insights into the structure–activity relationships of hERG blockers, particularly concerning the influence of heteroatom types and numbers.

Figure 6
Figure 6. Illustrative example demonstrating an activity decrease with elevated oxygen levels within the structures.
To further investigate the correlation between heteroatoms and the pIC50 value, additional analyses were conducted by grouping compounds with the same number of a specific heteroatom type. This approach allowed for a more targeted analysis of how biological activity (pIC50) evolves with changes in the quantity of a particular heteroatom type while keeping the total count of heteroatoms in the molecular structure constant. Figure 5 and Figures S2B, S3B, and S4B depict these grouped analyses, offering a clearer understanding of the relationship between heteroatoms and activity. Further statistical analysis was performed to examine the quantitative impact of heteroatoms on pIC50 activity, focusing on changes of approximately 1 log unit or more for the effect of a specific atom on the activity. To ensure reliable sampling, a threshold of five members in a cluster was set, and clusters containing fewer than five compounds were excluded from the analysis. By evaluating the increase or decrease in the number of a specific heteroatom while keeping the number of other heteroatoms constant, significant effects on the activity were observed. To gain a deeper understanding of these effects, compounds with the highest and lowest pIC50 values were selected from each cluster, encompassing both strong and weak inhibitors, providing a comprehensive view of the differences influencing the activity. As a result, six pairs of molecules were identified, each pair consisting of a strong and weak inhibitor (Table 2). This approach enabled a comprehensive investigation of the discrepancies among these molecules and facilitated subsequent analyses.

To gain deeper insights into the impact of the type and number of heteroatom in these selected representative compound pairs, molecular docking analyses were carried out by using the Glide/SP and Glide/XP algorithms. These chosen molecules were docked to the pore domain region of the hERG channel. The outcomes of these simulations, comprising the ligand–protein interactions (Figure 7) and docking scores obtained from Glide/SP and Glide/XP, are presented in Table 3.

Following the selection of the top docking scores, the compounds were subjected to further analysis by using MD simulations. A total of 6 pairs, representing both strong and weak inhibitors, were utilized in 200 ns all-atom MD simulations. The resulting trajectories from each simulation were collected and subjected to analysis. To assess the structural stabilities of each ligand pair at the binding pocket, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the ligands was measured in comparison to their initial positions (i.e., Glide/XP). A higher ligand RMSD value generally indicates a deviation from the initial binding pose, while a lower RMSD value suggests that the molecule maintains its initial conformation throughout the simulations. As expected, the results from Figure 8 validate these assumptions, as the RMSD values consistently remain lower for the strong inhibitors and higher for the weak inhibitors. However, it is worth noting that only one pair of molecules CHEMBL70 (pIC50, 3) and CHEMBL1257821 (pIC50, 9.85) deviates from this trend.

These findings provide valuable insights into the structural dynamics and binding characteristics of the inhibitors, emphasizing the significance of heteroatom types and numbers in achieving a strong or weak inhibitory profile. The ligand–protein interactions were analyzed through the generation of a simulation interaction diagram. Throughout the 200 ns all-atom MD simulations, various contacts between the ligand and the protein were observed and recorded. Figures S5 to S10 present detailed interactions between the ligand atoms and the protein, focusing on interactions that occurred for more than 15% of the simulation time. These analyses shed light on the complex interactions between the ligands and the protein, further contributing to our understanding of the structure–activity relationships and binding mechanisms of the inhibitors.
The MM/GBSA results were thoroughly examined alongside the experimental pIC50 data for each pair of molecules. Table 4 presents the average MM/GBSA binding free energy values between the selected ligand pairs and the hERG channel.

As anticipated, the average MM/GBSA outcomes revealed a clear correlation between the binding energy and activity. Molecules with higher pIC50 values exhibited more negative binding energy values, indicating stronger interactions and a better fit with the pore domain of the ion channel. Conversely, molecules with lower pIC50 values showed less negative binding energy values, suggesting weaker binding and less favorable interactions, categorizing them as weak inhibitors. The overall agreement between the MM/GBSA results and experimental data substantiated the predictive capability of the MM/GBSA method. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the MM/GBSA results for the pair of molecules CHEMBL70 and CHEMBL1257821 did not align well with the experimental data. This discrepancy signals the necessity for further investigation to comprehend the underlying factors contributing to the observed deviation in this specific pair of molecules. While CHEMBL70, a kappa opioid receptor antagonist, was anticipated to have a smaller RMSD and a more negative average MM/GBSA score compared to CHEMBL1257821, the latter displayed a strong inhibitory effect at the hERG channel with a pIC50 value of 9.85. However, the mismatched results observed for this pair may be attributed to the state of the hERG channel. The hERG channel can exist in either an open state or an open-inactivated state for hosting the blockers, and different drugs may have varying affinities depending on the specific state. It is plausible that CHEMBL1257821 and CHEMBL70 interact differently with the hERG channel due to variations in the conformational state of the channel. To explore this hypothesis, an open-inactivated state model of the hERG channel that we have reported previously (12) was utilized for docking the two compounds (i.e., CHEMBL1257821 and CHEMBL70), employing the consistent Glide/SP and Glide/XP docking protocols. Although the weak inhibitor CHEMBL70 demonstrates docking scores of −6.44 and −6.77 kcal/mol when employed with the Glide/SP and Glide/XP modules in the open-inactivated state, the corresponding outcomes for the strong inhibitor CHEMBL1257821 are −8.84 and −8.27 kcal/mol, as determined by the Glide/SP and Glide/XP approaches, respectively (Table S8). Further investigations and studies are warranted to explore the specific binding mechanisms and interactions of these compounds with the hERG channel in different states. Understanding these nuances can provide crucial insights into the design and development of more effective hERG inhibitors.
In this study, a comprehensive MM/GBSA analysis was also conducted to identify the crucial residues within the hERG channel that significantly impact the inhibition activity. The goal of this analysis was to pinpoint the residues that establish strong interactions with the ligands compared to others. The results of the MM/GBSA per-residue study, depicted in Figure 9 and Figures S11–S19. The findings of the per-residue analysis shed light on the essential residues responsible for governing the inhibitory function of the hERG channel. Notably, the hERG channel contains two sets of aryl residues, Tyr652 and Phe656, at the central cavity. (51,52) These residues collectively exert control over the dynamic processes of potassium channel gating and subsequent potassium ion conduction. As expected, residues (Tyr652 and Phe656) were also identified as key contributors in the per-residue interaction analysis, forming strong contacts with the ligands (Figure 9). The intricate modulation of these essential functions underscores their critical role in the overall channel activity. Notably, these specific residues offer potential interaction sites for various chemical compounds, carrying the capacity to influence hERG blockage. (53) Comparing with existing literature, our results align well with previous studies highlighting the importance of Tyr652 and Phe656 in hERG channel function. These residues consistently emerge as vital players. The robust residue–ligand interactions reinforce their relevance. This coherence validates our findings and underscores their crucial role in the hERG modulation. Interestingly, each ligand at the pore domain also exhibited additional interactions with specific residues that played a role in binding to the hERG channel. For example, compound CHEMBL1257578 showed that Val625 from Chain-A, Leu650 from Chain-B, Thr623, Val625, Met645, and Val659 from Chain-C, and Met645 from Chain-D were significant contributors to the binding energy, in addition to Tyr652 and Phe656 (Figure 9). The findings align consistently with established literature, for the residues Thr623 and Val625, situated in proximity to the pore helix, which were found to be implicated in hERG binding for many tested drugs. (54) These polar amino acids might have the capability to engage with the polar tails found in numerous potent hERG blockers (55−57) followed by Met645, which was determined in another study as one of the vital binding elements contributing to the stabilization of vesnarinone. (58) An investigation that used a combination of alanine-scanning and site-directed mutagenesis, alongside protein modeling, potential energy mapping, and docking studies, discovered that among the residues implicated in drug binding, Thr623, Val625, and Val659 play a significant role.

In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the structure–activity relationships of hERG blockers and the substructures that influence their inhibition activity. The development of ligand-based QSAR models based on heteroatom numbers from extensive ligand libraries proved to be effective, with CANVAS-created QSAR models showing high R2 and Q2 values. Among the various QSAR modeling techniques employed, the KPLS method demonstrated superior performance, enabling the development of QSAR models using multiple fingerprints. The investigation of heteroatoms revealed significant correlations among the number of oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, and sulfur atoms in the chemical structure of the inhibitors and their pIC50 values. The increase in the quantity of oxygen and chlorine atom numbers demonstrated an inverse correlation with inhibitory activity, whereas the increased number of sulfur atoms displayed a parallel relationship. However, the impact of nitrogen atoms on the hERG channel blocking activity proved to be more complex. It was observed that when the number of nitrogen atoms increased from 1 to 3 within a compound, the pIC50 values showed a decreasing trend. However, when the number of nitrogen atoms exceeded 3, a reverse trend emerged, with pIC50 values increasing. Furthermore, having more than 5 nitrogen atoms in a compound did not show a stable pIC50 trend. These findings underscore the importance of heteroatoms in influencing the activity of hERG blockers. The study highlights the significant role that specific heteroatom types and their respective quantities play in modulating the inhibitory effects on the hERG channel. Understanding these relationships can contribute to the design and optimization of potent and selective hERG inhibitors.
The utilization of MD simulations and MM/GBSA calculations enabled comprehensive analysis of compound pairs, facilitating a comparison between strong and weak inhibitors. (61−63) The results aligned perfectly with expectations as strong inhibitors displayed lower ligand RMSD values and more negative average MM/GBSA binding energy values, indicating stronger binding to the hERG channel. On the other hand, weak inhibitors exhibited higher ligand RMSD values and less negative average MM/GBSA values, indicating a weaker binding affinity. Moreover, the MM/GBSA per-residue analysis identified critical residues in the four chains of the hERG channel that play a significant role in the blockage activity. Notably, Tyr652 and Phe656 emerged as key residues, demonstrating consistent and diverse interactions with all of the studied inhibitor ligands. Specifically, Tyr652 engaged in the highest number of interactions, accounting for over 50% of the simulation time, primarily driven by hydrophobic forces. Additionally, other crucial residues such as Thr623, Ser624, and Ser660 were found to actively participate in ligand interactions throughout the simulation period. These findings highlight the pivotal role of Tyr652 and Phe656 and other residues in establishing and modulating inhibitor–ligand interactions, providing valuable insights into the design and optimization of targeted therapeutics.
In summary, this study enhances our comprehension of hERG channel blockage and offers valuable insights that can aid in the design of more effective hERG blockers. The presented findings play a crucial role in advancing drug discovery and provide significant considerations for the development of targeted therapeutics.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
