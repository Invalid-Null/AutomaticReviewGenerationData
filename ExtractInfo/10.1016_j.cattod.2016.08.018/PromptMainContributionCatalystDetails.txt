1. Introduction
Nowadays, fossil fuels represent the major energy and carbon source; environmental and political issues, though, keep high the pressure for developing alternative, environmentally-friendly and economically viable energy conversion routes. One of the possible scenarios is represented by the so-called hydrogen-based economy, relying on low C-impact hydrogen production technologies and a massive penetration of fuel cells as highly efficient energy conversion systems [1], [2], [3].
Hydrogen can be produced from a variety of feedstocks [4], [5]. These include fossil resources, such as natural gas and coal, as well as renewable resources, such as biomass and water.
In the last 10–15 years, the catalytic conversion of biomass-derived oxygenates has been investigated for the development of sustainable routes to H2. Ethanol has been primarily and widely studied as a model biofuel for steam reforming and partial oxidation processes [6], [7], [8], [9]. In parallel, the steam reforming of bio-oils or bio-oil components has also gained increased attention. Pioneering studies on the steam reforming of acetic acid, one major component of the volatiles formed during the gasification/fast pyrolysis of different biomasses, were published in the ‘90s by Wang et al. [10] and Marquevich et al. [11]. Systematic studies were then initiated by several research groups including Takanabe et al. [12], Rioche et al. [13] and Basagiannis and Verykios [14], Kechagiopoulos et al. [15]. In those and several successive studies acetic acid was suggested as a viable feedstock for H2 production, but coking was identified as a major issue, strongly limiting the catalyst stability. Since then, the literature has been addressing the deepening of reaction mechanisms, effect of nature of the supports, strategies to regenerate the catalyst and there has been a steady increase of the number of papers published on this topic.
The reaction scheme of acetic acid steam reforming on supported metal catalysts has been recognized as highly complex, likely due to the multi-functionality of the molecule (containing both one highly hydrogenated C atom and one highly oxygenated C atom). Seshan and co-workers [16] have recently reviewed the reaction pathways, based on previous results from the group [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], as well as the results reported by Lemonidou et al. [23]. The proposed scheme is also coherent with the identification of reaction routes by and Basagiannis and Verykios [14]. The overall steam reforming process includes both reactions leading to gas phase products (initiated by a carboxylation reaction, making available CHX fragments that can undergo steam reforming to CO and H2, but also gasification reactions of several surface hydrocarbon or oxygenate intermediates) and highly undesired reactions (such as dehydration or ketonization) leading to precursors for solid C-species such as adsorbed ketene, ethylene or acetone species, eventually leading to coke build-up through condensation reactions. A list of stoichiometries and heat of reactions has been reported in [14] and extended in [24].
Both transition metals and noble metals have been proven to be active in the steam reforming of acetic acid. Hu and Lu [25] have tested Ni, Co, Fe and Cu supported on alumina and verified that Ni and Co were more active than Fe and Cu based catalysts. The Ni/Al2O3 was more stable than Co/Al2O3 but all samples showed a certain tendency to solid carbon formation. Matas Güell et al. [21] have tested Ni/ZrO2 catalysts and observed rapid deactivation, but the performance of the Ni catalysts improved by using La/Zr and Ce/Zr modified supports [16], [21], [22]. Verykios and co-workers [26] analyzed Ni and noble metal catalysts; by comparing the performance with Ni based catalysts, they found that noble metals were less active but more stable in terms of carbon formation. They found that Rh is the most active noble metal when compared with Ru, Pt and Pd. Basagiannis and Verykios [26], [27] also showed that the acidity of the support plays an important role in the process. Al2O3 was recognized to catalyze cracking reactions with formation of carbonaceous species on the catalytic surface; however, the doping with basic oxides as MgO, CeO2 and La2O3 showed to have a positive effect by reducing coke formation.
Takanabe and coworkers [12], [17], [18] studied the steam reforming of acetic acid over Pt/ZrO2. They proposed that the process followed a bi-functional mechanism, being the metal phase responsible for acetic acid molecule activation, forming acetate or acyl intermediates that undergo CC cleavage to generate carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methyl groups. The CH3- species would then react with adsorbed hydrogen to generate methane. The adsorbed hydrogen could also combine with each other and form molecular H2. Interaction with the support would instead promote the ketonization reaction, that, followed by oligomerization of the acetone, would lead to coking of the support. The formation of carbonaceous species at the metal/support interface was reported as a critical step in the deactivation process. In recent works focusing on the design of stable steam reforming catalysts [21], [22], the same group has shown how the redox properties of the support and the surface oxygen mobility can contrast the formation of interfacial coke deposits, thus significantly increasing the catalyst stable performance.
Lemonidou and co-wokers [23], [28] have studied the reaction process using Rh supported over CeO2-ZrO2 and La2O3/CeO2-ZrO2 mixed oxides which greatly suppressed the coking activity. The reaction pathway was investigated by transient and isotopic experiments and entirely associated with the catalysis on Rh. It was proposed that the conversion of acetic acid on Rh particles proceeded via decarboxylation and steam reforming of the CHX intermediates with effective production of CO, CO2 and H2. Instead, dehydration to ketene was assumed to proceed at the periphery of the Rh particles, leading to the formation of acetone.
The effect of O2-cofeed has been studied to a much lesser extent. Lemonidou et al. [23] performed autothermal reforming experiments to evaluate the coking tendency of the Rh/La2O3/CeO2-ZrO2 catalyst under different conditions and found a beneficial effect from the oxygen-enriched system.
In this work, we address a kinetic study of the conversion of acetic acid over Rh-supported catalysts with O2 and/or steam. Our main background is on synthesis gas production via partial oxidation and steam reforming of C1C8 hydrocarbons over Rh/Al2O3 catalysts [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]. The CPO-system is a consecutive reaction process consisting of deep oxidation (consuming oxygen and part of the fuels with production of CO2, H2O) and steam reforming + WGS/RWGS (consuming the rest of the fuel, H2O and CO2, with production of synthesis gas). In an insulated reactor, wherein a balance between heat released by oxidation and heat consumed by reforming realizes, synthesis gas may be obtained auto-thermally at temperature ≥ 700 °C. The use of Rh allows to reach thermodynamic equilibrium within few milliseconds contact time, which prompted in our laboratory the development of short contact time reactors for both the kinetic investigation (the isothermal annular reactor [29]), and the process verification (the auto-thermal reactor with monolith catalyst [35]). In principle, also oxygenates can be reformed auto-thermally, that is without any external enthalpy input [36]. There is thus a general interest in studying the fuel-rich oxidation of acetic acid, as well as the steam reforming. In this study we adopted the same Rh/α-Al2O3 catalyst that has been tested in previous studies on the CPO of light and liquid hydrocarbons; on the one side Rh is suitable for the expected resistance to C-formation, on the other side this formulation allows to directly compare the new kinetic evidence with the more stablished behavior of hydrocarbons. It is in fact interesting to understand how the nature of the functional group present in the fuel affects the modes of activation of the molecule and the kinetic dependences.
We herein adopt the same methodology of investigation as developed in our previous studies, consisting of tests aimed at exploring the effects of operating conditions on the whole CPO process in order to identify the prevailing stoichiometries and kinetic dependences, and tests on selected reacting subsystems (e.g. steam reforming tests) in order to better characterize the temperature regions where these are active and their kinetics.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The support α-Al2O3 was obtained by calcination of a commercial γ-Al2O3 (Puralox Sba-200, Sasol) in air at 1100 °C for 10 h. After calcination the phase composition was verified by XRD, superficial area (9 m2/g) by BET analysis (Tristar Micromeritics) and pore size distribution by Hg porosimetry (Micromeritics AuotoPore IV). The 2% Rh/α-Al2O3 samples were prepared by dry impregnation of the α-Al2O3 support with a commercial Rh(NO3)3 solution (14.68 wt% Rh, Chempur). The impregnated support material was dried at 110 °C for 3 h.
The catalyst was deposited in the form of thin layers (about 10 μm) on alumina tubular supports by dip-coating. A slurry was prepared by adding the catalyst powders to an acidic solution and was ball-milled for 24 h; the alumina tubular support was coated on its terminal portion (2 cm from the sealed end) by dipping into the slurry and extraction at constant velocity; the coated tube was dried at 280 °C for 10 min (flash-drying) obtaining a well adhered catalyst layer.
2.2. Testing apparatus
The experiments were performed in an annular duct reactor (7) which was externally heated by a three zone Carbolite oven. The reactor was assembled as follows: the catalyst-coated alumina (O.D. 4 mm) was coaxially inserted into a quartz tube (I.D. 5 mm) giving rise to an annular duct (0.5 mm channel height) through which the gas flowed in laminar regime.
The reactor design, described in detail in previous papers [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], allows operating at very high GHSV (105–107 l(NTP)/kgcat/h) with negligible pressure drops and, due to the heat dispersion properties of the annular design and the use of highly diluted feed streams, negligible temperature gradients. These are highly desirable features in the kinetic investigation, especially when dealing with highly exothermic and/or endothermic processes.
In each experiment, temperature profiles were chaked by sliding a thermocouple (K-type) inside the alumina tube itself but no significant changes were verified. The catalyst average temperature was calculated as an arithmetic average of the single measurements taken every 2 mm along the length of the layer (2 or 4 cm). In all the figures, data are reported as a function of the catalyst average temperature. Oven temperatures were recorded by a second K-type thermocouple sliding in a mullite tube which was placed along the heating wall. Gases were fed from high pressure cylinders, liquids were fed from saturators fed by N2 flows. Gas flow into the reactor was controlled by mass flow controllers (BROOKS mass flow meters) and heated (120 ∘C) stainless steel lines were used to deliver the gas mixture. A micro-GC (3000 A, Agilent Technologies) was used to analyze the inlet and the outlet gas compositions. For quantitative determination of the concentrations, N2 was used as an internal standard.
2.3. Operating conditions
Prior to the tests, the catalyst underwent a standard conditioning procedure which consisted of repeated runs of CH4-CPO at GHSV of 1.2 × 106 l(NTP)/kgcat/h, feeding a diluted gas mixture with composition CH4 = 1% v/v, O2/CH4 = 0.56, N2 to balance; the catalyst conditioning was complete when stable performances were reached in the whole temperature range (200–800 °C).
After conditioning, typical HAc-CPO or HAc-SR runs consisted of steady-state experiments within the temperature range 200–800 °C, with step-wise increments of 10–50 °C. Diluted feed stream were used with HAc concentration at 0.4–0.8% v/v; CPO experiments were performed by feeding HAc/O2/N2 gas mixtures, SR reforming experiments were performed by feeding HAc/H2O/N2 gas mixtures. At each temperature, several gas-chromatographic analyses were performed until stationary conditions were obtained. Depending on the operating conditions, up to 2–3 h were necessary to obtain stable results. At temperatures higher than 450 °C, transients were typically characterized by initial high conversions that slowly reduced with time.
The data reported in the figures were all obtained by averaging several analyses, collected under stationary conditions, in the limit of the experimental sensitivity. Carbon, oxygen and hydrogen balances were verified in each experiments, by comparing the moles of the atomic species consumed with the reactants with those present in the products. Since systematic trends were found in the C-balance error, then this was not associated with the experimental error, but it was analyzed as the quantitative indicator of a C-storage phenomenon. For this reason, in each experiment, HAc conversion was evaluated in two forms:

(2)

(1) quantifies the conversion from the consumption of acetic acid across the reactor and uniquely depends on the relative abundance of HAc and N2 peaks in the gas-chromatographic analyses of inlet and outlet flow. Eq. (2) evaluates the conversion of HAc necessary to explain the production of the C-containing species and was thus evaluated through the relative abundance of CO, CO2, acetone, CH4 peaks with respect to the N2 peak in the gas-chromatographic analyses of the outlet stream.
The missing outlet C was quantified in terms of a conventional C2* adsorbed species with integral production rate:

2.4. Raman and TPO measurements
Raman spectroscopy technique was used for the characterization of carbonaceous materials on the catalytic surface. The Raman experiments were carried out with a portable i-Raman BWTEK instrument (TE Cooled 2048 Pixel CCD detector). Laser excitation at 785 nm was used, and the spectra were collected over the 175–3200 cm−1 spectral range with 5 cm−1 resolution. The Raman instrument was connected to a video microscope sampling system (BAC151A) with integrated camera for tracking the laser beam position and focusing. The measurements were carried out in backscattering geometry.
The Raman measurements were realized starting from fresh coated tubes, that were exposed to a reference HAc-CPO test (O2/HAc = 0.5 and GHSV = 1.2·106 l(NTP)/kgcat/h) at constant temperature (300 and 450 °C) for two hours. After cooling in N2 flow, the tube was extracted by the reactor and exposed to the laser beam.
Temperature Programmed Oxidation (TPO) tests were also performed to characterize the nature of carbon-specie accumulated on the catalyst during the CPO of HAc.
The TPO was performed by reinserting the catalytic tube in the annular reactor right after the Raman analyses. The test consisting in heating the catalyst under air flow (GHSV = 104 l(NTP)/kgcat/h) from room temperature up to 800 °C at 2 °C/min, with a final hold of about 2 h.
3. Result and discussion
3.1. Thermodynamics of the HAc/O2/N2 and HAc/H2O/N2 reacting systems
The thermodynamics of the reacting systems were calculated by Gibb’s free energy minimization, using thermochemical data from the NIST database [37]; a home-made code was developed at this scope in the Mathematica® environment. Possible formation of solid carbon graphitic and ideality for all the gaseous species were assumed. In all the conditioned studied, complete conversion of HAc was predicted.
The selectivity of solid carbon and the distribution of the gaseous species were evaluated at varying O2/HAc ratio and H2O/HAc ratio, at constant HAc feed concentration = 0.6% v/v. The results are reported in Fig. 1. In the HAc/O2/N2 system (panel (a)), carbon formation is thermodynamically favored at low temperatures, and the equilibrium concentration decreases with increasing temperature; also the slope becomes more and more pronounced with increasing temperature. In the absence of O2, the equilibrium concentration drops to zero at relatively high temperatures, but the threshold temperature for the absence of solid C progressively decreases with increasing O2/HAc ratio. At O2/HAc = 0.5, the formation of solid C is thermodynamically favored only below 550 °C.

The H2O co-feed has the same qualitative and quantitative effect on the formation of solid C, as the O2-cofeed. The curves in panel (b) are in fact identical to those of panel (a) at equal O amount in the feed, either as O2 or as H2O. Thus 550 °C is the same temperature threshold for the formation of solid C for the H2O/HAc = 1.0 reacting system, too.
Concerning the gas-phase species, panel (3) compares the molar fraction of CO, H2, CO2 and CH4 for the reference reacting systems with O2/HAc = 0.5 (open symbols) and H2O/HAc = 1 (full symbols), representative of partial oxidation and steam reforming processes, respectively. In the partial oxidation system, a higher molar fraction of CO2 and lower molar fraction of CH4 are predicted in the low to medium temperature range. H2 and CO are the most abundant products above 550 °C in both systems, and while CO concentration is rather insensitive to the nature of co-reactant (H2O or O2), H2 concentration is inevitably higher in the case of the steam reforming system. The moderate decline of CO2 and H2 concentration at high temperatures is accompanied by an increase of CO and H2O concentration (not reported) and can be explained as the equilibration of the WGS/RWGS system.
It is very interesting to observe that there is a complete thermodynamic equivalence between the stability of HAc and the stability of the equimolar CH4/CO2 mixture. This equivalence is demonstrated in Fig. 2, where are plotted the selectivity of solid C and the distribution of gaseous products for the two systems. It is somehow fascinating to keep in mind such a potential equivalence, when approaching the kinetic analysis of HAc conversion and comparing with the background knowledge on methane activation [29], [30].

3.2. CPO of light hydrocarbons
Before addressing the kinetic study of the HAc CPO on Rh, it is useful to first briefly recall the characteristic features of the CPO process of light hydrocarbons [33].
It has been observed that, for any hydrocarbon, the CPO process proceeds along a consecutive reaction scheme consisting of deep oxidation and steam reforming. In fact, only at temperatures above the complete conversion of O2 (about 450 °C for methane and 400 °C for propane) steam reforming became active with production of synthesis gas. CPO and SR experiments at varying feed composition showed that the rate of deep oxidation of CH4 and C3H8 is independent from the O2 gas phase concentration, coherently with the assumption that the rate determining step is the breaking of a CH bond over a an oxygen-saturated surface, while the rate of SR is independent from the concentration of H2O and uniquely depends on the rupture of a CH bond over metal sites (see also Regime 1 and Regime 4 in [36]).
Raman spectra collected after the CPO experiments revealed that both in case of CH4 and in the case of C3H8, the surface of the catalyst was relatively clean from amorphous or more organized graphitic structures [33].
The presence of a CC group in the hydrocarbon molecule produced important changes [36]. The oxidation of the olefin was promoted, steam reforming, however, was slowed down. Syngas formation was observed starting from about 450 °C and its production grew with temperature with a sluggish trend. Additional tests revealed that the kinetic dependences of the oxidation rate were coherent with a Regime 2 in [38] (activation of a CH bond over a O*-* pair), while steam reforming was positively affected by H2O concentration. Raman measurements evidenced the formation of amorphous and graphitic C-structures in the plateau region at the intermediate temperatures. Both kinetic and spectroscopic measurements were coherent with the assumption of a strong affinity of the unsaturated hydrocarbon with the surface, such to compete with O2 adsorption on Rh thus making make available free sites adjacent to O*, and such to saturate the surface under conditions of complete O2 conversion, thus hindering by C-poisoning the rate of steam reforming.
Similar kinetic effects were observed in the study of the CPO of n-octane and i-octane [34]. An increased rate of oxidation was observed (following the trend: n-octane > i-octane ≅ propane > methane) while C-poisoning was proposed to hinder the steam reforming (more important in the case of n-octane than in the case of i-octane), delaying it to high temperatures and producing the typical stretched shape of conversion curve with a plateau in between the oxidation branch and the steam reforming branch.
3.3. CPO of acetic acid in annular reactor
A reference run of CPO was performed at GHSV = 1.2·106 l(NTP)/kgcat/h with an acetic acid concentration of 0.6% and a O2/HAc = 0.57.
Fig. 3 shows the results at varying catalyst temperature; panel (a) reports the measured conversions (in the case of acetic acid, according to both Eqs. (1) and (2)), panel (b) reports the distribution of the reaction products.

Fig. 3. HAc-CPO experiment. HAc = 0.6% v/v, O2/HAc = 0.57, N2 to balance, GHSV = 1.2.106 Nl/Kgcat/h, P = 1 atm. Panels: a) conversion of O2 and HAc; b) molar fraction of products.
An oxidation process started at low temperature (about 250 °C), while the production of H2 became important at temperatures above 450–500 °C; the conversion of the oxygenate presented a plateau region in between 300 and 400–450 °C. The general features are thus very similar to those observed in past in the case of propylene and in the case of n-octane, hydrocarbons with high affinity with the surface and tendency to C-poisoning.
The results of Fig. 3, though, showed very unique features, that we will analyze in some detail. The conversions of reactants started at about 250 °C and, as observed in the CPO of propylene, they rapidly grew with temperature up to 300 °C, where the process reached a mass transfer limited regime with about 93% O2 conversion and about 28% conversion of acetic acid. Both conversions, in fact, kept constant at further increasing the temperature to 350 °C. Surprisingly, at increasing T up to 450 °C a progressive decrease of O2 conversion was observed. This very unexpected trend was accompanied by a change of the product distribution, since the outlet molar fraction of CO2 decreased stoichiometrically with the O2 decline and an increasing concentration of CO was detected together with a little amount of hydrogen. Concerning the production of water, its concentration kept constant up to 450 °C and slightly increased at higher temperatures, indicating an increasing excess with respect to the amount expected for a deep oxidation stoichiometry (CO2: H2O = 1:1). Notably at these temperatures also an increasing error of the C-balance was registered. Fig. 3 also plots the molar fraction of the missing carbon in the outlet gas-phase, treated as a C2 component (C2* in the figure). In practice, this quantity represents the estimated concentration of a monomeric species that was stored (likely via condensation into larger molecules) on the catalyst surface. Since the results were obtained under stationary conditions, it is likely that the surface species were accumulated on the support (behaving as an infinite capacity system), rather than the Rh surface. Traces of acetone were also detected in the same temperature range.
Starting from 450 to 500 °C a rapid transition to a reforming regime was visible: syngas was progressively produced, O2 was rapidly consumed, the conversion the acid increased steadily up to complete conversion at 800 °C. The C-balance approached the unity at about 600 °C. Thus at the highest temperature investigated, the product distribution could be associated with a reaction scheme consisting of deep oxidation, steam reforming and water gas shift reactions.
Notably, the experiment was reproducible.
To better investigate the peculiar features of the low-temperature activation, additional experiments were performed at varying space velocity and feed composition. Although the whole 200–900 °C temperature range was investigated, we will focus in following on the results collected in the 200–450 °C T-window.
4. Effect of space velocity
Experiments with the same feed composition (O2/HAc = 0.57, HAc = 0.6%) were performed at decreasing space velocity from the reference 1.2·106 down to 1.5·105 l(NTP)/kgcat/h. The lowest space velocity was realized by partly decreasing the flow rate and using a longer (4-cm) catalyst layer.
The results are ported in Fig. 4. At the lower space velocity, the onset of the process became more rapid, since complete O2 conversion was reached at about 250 °C; at increasing temperature a less important loss of O2 conversion was observed. Coherently with the moderate decline of O2 conversion, only a weak decrease of the outlet CO2 concentration was observed; but, at each temperature, a greater concentration of CO, H2 as well as a greater amount of H2O not explained by deep oxidation were observed with respect to the high space velocity run. The concentration of these species, then, progressively grew with temperature up to 450 °C.

Panels: a) conversion of O2 and HAc; b) molar fraction of H2O, CO2, CO and H2; c) molar fraction of acetone and calculated molar fraction of the surface C2* species.
Interestingly, also the error of the C-balance grew with decreasing space velocity. Panel (c) reports the evolution of the “missing” outlet C, treated as a C2* species stored on the catalyst. For the sake of clarity, data were plotted over the entire range of temperature investigated, which allows to appreciate that the C-balance error passed through a maximum a decreased to zero at about 600 °C, as in the case of the high space velocity test. At 1.5·105 l(NTP)/kgcat/h this quantity was much more important, though. It is also interesting to note that, both at higher and at lower space velocity, acetone was observed in the product mixture and its concentration passed through a bell-shaped curve, similarly to the C-balance error, that is the accumulation of C-species on the catalyst surface. The analogy between the kinetics of acetone formation and the kinetics of coking phenomena has been observed by other authors; Hoang et al. [16] for instance observed that the initial decay of acetic acid conversion during steam reforming tests was accompanied by a decay of acetone mole fraction.
The similar effects that temperature and contact time exert on both acetone in the gas phase and on the accumulated C-species in the solid phase could be explained by assuming the existence of a common intermediate.
4.1. Effect of O2/HAc feed ratio
The effect of O2 concentration was evaluated by keeping constant the concentration of acetic acid at 0.6% and varying the concentrations of O2. The results are shown in Fig. 5. The rate of HAc deep oxidation in the temperature range 250–300 °C appeared almost independent from the concentration of O2 in the gas phase; in fact, the measured conversion of acetic acid, as well as the outlet mole fraction of CO2 and H2O did not appreciably changed with O2, while the conversion of O2 decreased at increasing O2 feed content. Due to the stoichiometric constraint, at increasing O2 content the plateau level of acetic acid conversion (reached at 300–350 °C) progressively increased.

In all the experiments O2 conversion declined above 300 °C; although the loss of conversion decreased with increasing O2 content, the net O2 outflow was identical in all the experiments (as shown by the trends of the molar fraction of O2, which was not reported for brevity). Indeed, in the three experiments the same decline of CO2 productivity and an equal production of CO were measured. These pieces of evidence suggest that the kinetic phenomenon which is responsible for the change of selectivity and the decline of O2 conversion does not depend on O2 partial pressure, since its rate kept constant at constant acetic acid concentration.
An additional experiment was thus performed at lower acid concentration (0.4%) while keeping the O2 concentration at about 0.3%; the results are reported in Fig. 6 and herein compared with the reference test. The decrease of acetic acid concentration had a negligible effect on the rate of production of H2O and CO2 up to 300 °C (evidencing an almost zero order dependence of deep oxidation on the acid concentration), but the O2 conversion loss decreased significantly, such that the decline of CO2 concentration and the production of CO were much less important.

Thus, summarizing, we observed that below 300 °C, where CO2 and H2O were uniquely produced, the reaction rate showed an almost zero dependence on both O2 concentration and acetic acid concentration. This could be explained by assuming that both reactants were largely adsorbed on the surface. The independence on O2 concentration is a common feature with the phenomenology of the oxidation of all the C1C8 hydrocarbons; this has been explained by our and other groups as the evidence that the rate determining step (the rupture of a CH bond) occurs on oxygen saturated Rh sites [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [38]. However, in the case of hydrocarbons the rate of oxidation shows a linear dependence on the hydrocarbon partial pressure. The absence of a kinetic dependence from the acetic acid concentration is instead new; this could be explained by assuming that the acid was also strongly adsorbed on the surface but on different sites from the O-sites, thus presumably on the Al2O3 support. The tendency of acetic acid to adsorb on metal oxides is in fact well known in the literature. The rate of reaction would thus depend on the coverage of O* species on Rh and the coverage of HAc* species on the support, both close to unity at the lowest temperatures investigated.
In the temperature range 300–450 °C, we observed a displacement of O2 from the Rh sites; the intensity of this phenomenon did not depend on O2 partial pressure but was proportional to the concentration of acetic acid. A change of selectivity appeared with the decline of CO2 production, the formation of CO (accompanied by a small amount of H2) and the progressively important accumulation of C on the catalyst surface.
These phenomena could be explained by assuming that in this temperature range acetic acid also adsorbed on Rh sites, reducing significantly the coverage of oxygen, while increasing the coverage of HAc-derived species. This in turn might produce a hindering of the deep oxidation process and promote a different oxygen-lean chemistry (notably, a small but significant amount of H2 was also observed). In this respect, it interesting to analyze the results of the combined IR and DFT study on the oxidation of C2C4 carboxylic acids over Au/TiO2 catalysts by McEntee et al. [39]; the authors propose a reaction mechanism wherein the rate determining step would be the formation of a gold ketelynidene intermediate (AuCCO) via the CO breaking of an acetic acid molecule interacting both with the metal particle (thorough the methyl group) and the support (through the carboxylic group). Although the extension of such a mechanism to Rh-supported catalysts is a speculation, we observe that a similar mode of interaction could explain the coverage of acetic acid on Rh, still in the presence of O2 in the gas-phase.
Further investigation is needed to better comprehend the nature of the observed effects.
4.2. A decomposition experiment
An experiment was performed under the same operating conditions as the reference CPO test, except for the absence of O2 in the feed stream. The results are reported in Fig. 7. Panel (a) reports in full symbols the conversion of acetic acid evaluated from Eq. (1) and in open symbols the conversion calculated from Eq. (2). The distribution of the reaction products is then reported in panel (b). Notably, most of the measured acid conversion was not explained by gaseous products, thus it gave rise to the production of species that accumulated on the catalyst surface; the quantification of the “missing” carbon in terms of a C2* surface monomer is also reported in panel (b). It is observed that its production was practically equimolar with the production of H2O, which suggests that the prevailing consumption route of the acid was likely dehydration, leading to a ketene-like intermediate:
CH3COOH → CH2CO* + H2O

It is reasonable to assume that a similar dehydration route is active also under CPO conditions, and that a ketene-like adsorbed species is the C2* intermediate, whose formation was invoked in the CPO experiments starting from 400 to 450 °C. The comparison between the decomposition run and the CPO run, though, shows that in the absence of O2 the formation of this species increased progressively with temperature, while under CPO conditions its concentration passed through a maximum, and declined over 500 °C in correspondence with the onset of reforming reactions that formed CO and H2.
Notably, the dehydration of acetic acid to ketene has been identified by Lemonidou et al. [23] as a parallel route of conversion of acetic acid at the periphery of Rh particles (thus a support-assisted mode); the ketene intermediate was proposed to either evolve to synthesis gas via steam reforming or to produce acetone via a modified ketonization route.
4.3. A steam reforming experiment
In order to gain more direct pieces of evidence on the nature of syngas production, that during the CPO run was observed in small amount in between 300 and 450 °C under non complete conversion of O2 (a very unique feature, never observed in the CPO of light and liquid hydrocarbons), but became significant only above 450–500 °C when O2 was completely consumed (in line with the behavior of hydrocarbons), experiments were performed with a diluted H2O/HAc/N2 mixture. The steam reforming tests provided a general confirmation of mechanistic observations previously reported in the literature [16], [23].
Fig. 8 reports the results in terms of: conversion, panel(a), evaluated from both the balance of the acid, and the C-containing products; mole fraction of H2O and of the most abundant products, panel (b); mole fraction of acetone and the C2* species whose concentration explains the C-balance error, panel (c).

Fig. 8. Steam reforming experiment. HAc = 0.6% v/v, H2O/HAc = 3,3, N2 to balance., GHSV = 2,0.106 Nl/Kgcat/h, P = 1 atm. Panels: a) conversion of HAc evaluated from both the acid consumption across the reactor, and the C-content of the products; b) molar fraction of H2O, CO, CO2, H2 and CH4 calculated at equilibrium (dotted lines) and measured (symbols); molar fraction of acetone and of the C-error, expressed in terms of C2 species.
The conversion of acetic acid started to increase with temperature from 300 °C, with a rapid increase of the slope above 500 °C. At these high temperatures, the conversion was explained by the observed C-containing products.
The product distribution suggests that an effective steam reforming pathway was active only at temperature higher than 450 °C; this was accompanied by a WGS reaction. In fact, the outlet mole fraction of CO2, CO and H2 grew steadily with temperature up to 650 °C were a change of trends was observed due to the approach to the thermodynamic equilibrium.
The results also allow to exclude that the formation of CO and H2 observed in the CPO process below 450 °C be due to a steam reforming reaction.
It is interesting to note that no CH4 formation was observed in the whole temperature range, thus excluding any appreciable importance of HAc decomposition to CH4 and CO2, the thermodynamically favored stoichiometry at low to medium temperature.
As in the CPO experiments, the representation of the “missing” C in terms of C2* surface species produced a growing trend with a maximum at about 500 °C. A similar trend was shown by the concentration of acetone, that was a minor reaction product.
Thus, both in the presence of O2, or in the presence of steam, a tendency of acetic acid to form surface compounds (presumably via dehydration to ketene and successive oligo- and polymerization steps) was observed in the temperature range 300–500 °C; however gasification reactions prevailed at higher temperatures where the acid consumption was well explained by the production of synthesis gas.
It is important to observe that, as in the case of the CPO run, the present data were obtained under steady state conditions; these were reached with relatively long equilibrations times (2–3 h, much longer than in the case of CPO or SR experiments with CH4). It is thus believed that most of the “missing” C was actually accumulated on the support.
Both after the CPO experiments and after the SR experiments the catalyst layers were visibly blackened.
4.4. Raman and TPO analyses
The state of the catalyst surface was investigated by Raman measurements (Fig. 9) and by TPO measurements (where surface C was converted into CO2, Fig. 10) after conditioning under reference CPO tests at 300 and 450 °C. The temperature value of 300 °C was chosen since it represents the upper limit temperature at which a deep oxidation process was uniquely observed and involved the entire length of the catalyst layer, since the conversion of O2 was not complete but close to 93%. The temperature value of 450 °C was chosen since here the minimum of the O2 conversion was observed together with the presence of an important unbalance between input and output C fluxes.

The Raman spectra were taken at 5 different axial positions of the catalyst bed (4 cm long). No carbon signals were detected along the catalyst layer after the CPO conditioning at 300 °C. Instead, after the CPO test at 450 °C, broad signals at 1595 cm−1 and 1350 cm−1 appeared, respectively attributed to the G and D peaks of amorphous carbon with a content of sp2 graphitic-like nanostructures [40], [41]. Notably, the intensity of the signals grew along the length of the catalyst layer (passing from position 2 to 3 to 4); the signals collected at the very inlet and outlet section were much weaker, but we cannot exclude that the intensity of the Raman effect was here attenuated by possible defects of the catalyst thickness, at the border of the washcoat.
After the Raman analysis, each tube was exposed to a TPO run. The results are reported in Fig. 10, in terms of molar flux of CO2 per unit weight of Rh/Al2O3 catalyst. The Raman and TPO experiments were in fact obtained over different tubes with slightly varying catalyst load.
Both TPO curves were relatively complex and consisted of several contributions, with little resolution among them. This could mean that together with the production of CO2, due to the effective oxidation of C-containing species, also desorption-elution phenomena occurred, likely associated with the presence of adsorbed oxygenated species on the support.
However, the comparison between the two curves seems to evidence some significant differences. In the case of the TPO curve after CPO at 300 °C, the most important component had its maximum at 230 °C and a secondary peak was detected at 570 °C. These low temperature and high temperature contributions to the production of CO2 can be associated with the oxidation of carbonaceous deposits with different compositions and structures and/or the carbonaceous deposits located on different sites on the catalyst. Both in [16] and in [23] similar TPO peaks have been attributed to C-species adsorbed on the support with different reactivity due to low and high degree of condensation.
In the TPO after CPO at 450 °C, the component at 230 °C decreased in intensity, while a peak centered at 350 °C appeared and represented the prevailing component, in analogy with [16], [23]. At temperatures higher than 400 °C, another broad contribution was visible which extinguished at about 570 °C and replaced the sharper high temperature peak of the TPO after test at 300 °C.
It is now interesting to compare kinetic evidence, Raman experiments and TPO experiments.
The Raman data are coherent with the kinetic data. In fact, both suggest that at 300 °C the oxidation of acetic acid proceeded as a deep oxidation process over a “clean” Rh surface (likely saturated by O* species), that is in the absence of coking phenomena leading to the accumulation of polymeric C-species. Instead at 450 °C, where the Raman measurement detected the presence of graphitic C-species, the CPO process was characterized by a change of the process stoichiometry with decreased consumption of O2 and a net loss of C from the gas-phase. The C-species accumulated on the catalyst surface displayed Raman activity, with the characteristic spectral features of amorphous carbon embedding sp2-hybridized graphitic entities.
However, the TPO tests evidenced that C-species were present on both samples. The apparent contradiction between TPO and Raman measurements is not knew in our studies on the C-poisoning phenomena. A very similar case was encountered when analyzing the Raman and TPO response of Rh/Al2O3 layers after the CPO of n-octane and the CPO of i-octane [35]. It is worthwhile briefly recalling those data. Raman spectra showed the presence of broad G and D peaks after the CPO of n-octane, while indicated a clean surface after the CPO of i-octane. The TPO profiles presented an equally important low temperature peak at 230 °C; only in the case of n-octane, the TPO profile presented an important high temperature peak at 570 °C. Based on previous studies by De Chen et al. [42] on propane dehydrogenation over a Pt-Sn catalyst, we have associated the low temperature and high temperature TPO peaks to C-species closely adjacent to the metal particles, and C-species more remote or accumulated on the support, respectively. De Chen’s studies also showed that the coke species on the metal had higher H/C ratio than those present on the support, which could explain a difference in the Raman activity.
By assuming that the low temperature signal in TPO is generated by reactive CHx intermediates with high H/C ratio and sp3–hybridized carbon, it is in fact expected that such species have an intrinsically weaker Raman signal, due to a largely reduced Raman cross section compared with π-conjugated carbon systems of similar size. Conversely, by assuming that the high-temperature peak is mainly associated with extended π-conjugated molecular structures embedded in amorphous carbon deposits, then it is understood why the D and G peak are produced (selectively for n-octane).
We can now extend this speculation to the present comparison between the state of the surface after the acetic acid experiments at 300 and 450 °C. Also in this study, in fact, we observe the absence of a Raman signal on the 300 °C sample, which can be explained by assuming that low temperature TPO peak was generated by the oxidation of highly hydrogenated CHX, not visible by the Raman technique.
The intense Raman signal shown by the 450 °C sample can be associated with the more intense TPO signal in the medium-high temperature range (300–600 °C) of the same sample. The presence of a TPO peak at 350 °C suggests that the reactivity of the most abundant species was intermediate in between the CHX fragments (easily interacting with the metal particle) and the highly condensed coke on the support (that would decompose at high temperatures [16]); indeed Lemonidou et al. [23] have associated the 350 °C peak to the decomposition of oligomers rather than polymers, formed by a limited condensation process of the ketene intermediate at the metal-support interface.
5. Conclusions
In this study, we investigated the conversion of acetic acid on a Rh/α-Al2O3 catalyst using an isothermal annular reactor, at high space velocity. CPO experiments allow to investigate both the oxidation and the steam reforming kinetics, but dedicated experiments without O2 (decomposition) and with H2O (steam reforming) supported the study.
Three characteristic processes were identified.
Oxidation initiated at 200–250 °C but kinetics and selectivity changed at 300 °C. Below this temperature the process proceeded as a deep oxidation reaction and the substantial independence of the rate from both the O2 and the HAc concentration in the gas-phase suggests that the reaction proceeded at the metal-support interface involving adsorbed species at high coverage (O* on Rh sites, HAc* on support sites). Above 300 °C, the conversion of O2 decreased together with the production of CO2, while CO, traces of H2 and C-balance error grew with temperature. This has been associated with the displacement of O2 from the metal in favor of acetic acid adsorption and consequent activation of an O-lean chemistry on Rh.
The dehydration of HAc was reasonably responsible for C-balance errors at the intermediate temperatures (400–550 °C) in CPO experiments as well as in steam reforming experiments, comparing well with the results of experiments with HAc/N2 feed. The stoichiometry of HAc dehydration leads to the production of ketene; its formation and condensation to larger species would be counterbalanced by gasification reactions, active both in the CPO and in the SR experiments. The kinetic trends (deduced from the C-balance errors) suggest an analogy between acetone production and C-accumulation. It is thus probable that also acetone is a product of ketene coupling.
Starting from 300 °C, but more significantly above 500 °C (where C-poisoning phenomena were less important) steam reforming was active a produced synthesis with a composition close to thermodynamic equilibrium although operating at very high space velocity; this confirmed that at sufficiently high temperature, acetic acid can be effectively converted into a H2-rich stream.
The combined characterization of deposited C-species by Raman spectroscopy and TPO tests indicated that, while the low temperature interaction of acetic acid and O2 on the surface did not form graphitic like structures, the reaction at 450 °C produced more organized C-species with sp2-hibridization, likely associated with the formation oligomers with intermediate reactivity and (or proximity with the metal particles).
