 Unfortunately this paper does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The paper is focused on characterizing the surface oxygen species on gamma-alumina using NMR spectroscopy. While gamma-alumina is sometimes used as a catalyst support material, this paper does not investigate any catalytic reactions or discuss the performance of catalysts for converting propane to propylene.
