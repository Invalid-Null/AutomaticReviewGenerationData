The given document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically. It provides a broad overview of trends and challenges in refinery technologies for converting crude oil to chemicals like olefins, but does not go into details about PDH/ODH catalysts. The document mainly focuses on steam cracking, fluid catalytic cracking, hydrocracking, and potential direct crude oil conversion technologies. Since PDH/ODH is not a core focus, I cannot extract the requested catalyst details or performance enhancements pertaining to those processes.
