The document does not discuss Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) or Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically for the conversion of propane to propylene. The document focuses on a novel copper-aluminum catalyst for propane dehydrogenation in general, but does not provide details on propylene selectivity, yield, or production relevant to PDH or ODH processes.
