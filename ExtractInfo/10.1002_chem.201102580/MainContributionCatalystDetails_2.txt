The provided document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The manuscript focuses on a catalyst for converting propane to propene, not propylene specifically. Therefore, it is not directly relevant to propylene production via propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH).
