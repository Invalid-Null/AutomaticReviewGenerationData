Composition- and Aspect-Ratio-Dependent Electrocatalytic Performances of One-Dimensional Aligned Pt–Ni Nanostructures
Abstract
This work presents the synthesis of 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures with ultrahigh aspect ratio (>1000) based on the anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template and their composition- and aspect-ratio-dependent catalytic performances to methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). The 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures were electrochemically deposited in the pores of the AAO template, and the diameter and length of the synthesized nanostructures are comparable with the diameter of pores and thickness of the used AAO. The aspect ratio of the 1D aligned nanostructures can be tuned merely by altering AAO templates with the appropriate aspect ratios. Voltammetric results show that the catalytic activities (both mass activities and specific activities) of the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures for MOR are composition dependent, and the highest electrocatalytic activity exhibits at a Pt/Ni molar ratio of 1:1 (PtNi). The mechanism of the promoting effect of Ni on Pt is explained based on modification of the electronic characteristics of the surface Pt atoms (Pt 4f) by Ni atoms due to the shift in electron transfer from Ni to Pt. Moreover, the catalytic activities of the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures are in an aspect-ratio-dependent manner and increase in the order 0D PtNi nanoparticles, 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures at aspect ratios of ∼200, 500, and 1300 due to the preferential exposure of certain crystal facets and less surface defects of the 1D aligned nanostructures. This work is believed to open new and exciting possibilities for enhancing the performance of fuel cell catalysts. Our synthesized high-aspect-ratio 1D aligned nanostructures may also be useful as sensors and in other electrochemical applications.

Designing and synthesizing effective Pt- and Pt-based electrocatalysts for the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and/or anodic alcohol oxidation reaction (AOR) has been a key scientific objective because there is an increased need for practical, cost-effective viable fuel cell devices and metal–air batteries for further energy applications. (1-12) The recent search for advanced catalysts has led to some exciting advances in our understanding of the catalytic nature, allowing more rational tuning of the catalytic properties via controlled synthesis. Highly active catalysts have been prepared by rationally manipulating the chemical composition of the Pt-based catalysts via alloying Pt with other transition metals. For example, Pt-based binary and ternary metallic catalysts have been synthesized and studied for enhancing the catalytic activity, improving the stability, and reducing the use of Pt. (1-3, 9, 10, 13-20) The catalytic characteristics of the Pt-based catalysts can be further activated when the catalysts are prepared in a controlled size, shape, and morphology. (3, 11, 12, 21-28) Although tangible gains have been achieved in the continued development of the nanocatalysts, generating viable, permanent solutions to many inherent performance issues (for example, the specific activity of commercial Pt catalysts is considerably lower than that of bulk Pt, and significant overpotentials are often required to achieve suitable kinetics for practical use) (3) continues to remain elusive.
Most of these previously synthesized Pt- and Pt-based catalysts, however, have been limited to nanoparticles (zero-dimension, 0D) that could be obtained using a variety of chemical procedures. (7, 9, 13, 16, 18) In contrast to those 0D nanoparticles, one-dimensional (1D) nanostructures, particularly those composed of noble metals, have recently become the focus of significant attention and effort as potentially effective materials in a broad range of applications because they exhibit additional advantages associated with their anisotropies, unique structures, or surface properties. (3, 4, 11, 29-34) A 1D nanostructure is expected to be an exciting and promising structural paradigm, which is inherently beneficial to efficient ORR and AOR performances and may solve many of the inherent technological shortfalls associated with commercial Pt catalyst (Pt nanoparticles). (35, 36) For example, the anisotropic structure of 1D noble metal nanostructures leads to preferential surface exposure of smooth, defect-free, low-energy facets. (37) These intrinsic structural and electronic properties are collectively expected to culminate in a weakened interaction with adsorbed oxygen species and delay passivation of the nanostructure’s surface to higher potentials, thereby effectively reducing the overpotential necessary for high kinetics. (35) Furthermore, the relatively low defect density associated with 1D structure also represents a promising route toward achieving increased durability because these structures are significantly less susceptible to both dissolution and ripening. (38, 39)
Although 1D Pt nanostructures (nanowires and nanotubes) have been synthesized by templating against channels in porous materials, self-assembled structures of surfactant, and Ag or Se nanowires or by growing directly on a nanosphere of a carbon black for catalyzing ORR and AOR, (31, 40, 41) there are several issues still remaining to be disclosed. For example, those synthesized Pt nanowires and nanotubes usually have a low aspect ratio and cannot be used for evaluating the aspect-ratio-dependent catalytic performances. The presence of carbon degrades durability and leads to a fast and significant loss of electrochemical surface area (ECSA) during fuel cell operation. (5, 42) Thus, there has been considerable interest in the development of 1D nanostructure having a high aspect ratio for fuel cell catalysts. To develop such catalysts, several characteristics have to be taken into consideration for their synthesis and assembly. For fuel cell catalysis, high surface area, multicomponent 1D Pt-based alloy is particularly promising for increasing the activity and utilization of precious metals.
This work presents the synthesis of 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures with ultrahigh aspect ratio (>1000) based on the anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) template and their composition- and aspect-ratio-dependent catalytic performances to the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR). Since its discovery about two decades ago, (43) AAO has been widely used as a template for synthesizing various 1D nanostructures because it provides a rigid matrix with well-aligned pores whose mean diameter and space between the interpores can be easily controlled by adjusting the anodization conditions. (44-51) However, the commonly used AAO is produced by two-step anodization procedures at a constant voltage (usually at 0–5 °C and 30–230 V) and has a low aspect ratio (less than 300), (46, 48) limiting its use for preparing the high-aspect-ratio 1D nanostructures. Recently, we reported a two-step anodization approach under galvanostatic conditions for preparation of an AAO template with an ultrahigh aspect ratio of more than 1000. (52) To explore application of the prepared ultra-high-aspect-ratio AAO, we first synthesized 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures with an aspect ratio of more than 1000 using the prepared AAO as template. We then studied the composition-dependent electrocatalytic features of the synthesized 1D aligned Pt–Ni catalyst toward MOR. We finally compared the electrocatalytic performances of the catalyst with different aspect ratios (0D Pt–Ni nanoparticles, 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanocatalysts with aspect ratios of ∼1300, 500, and 200) and highlighted the aspect-ratio-dependent electrocatalytic activity of the 1D aligned nanostructures. The reason we select the Pt–Ni nanostructures as our studied model is that Pt–Ni alloys have recently emerged as an attractive and active bimetallic nanocatalyst for achieving both high activity and stability while reducing the amount of Pt used and thus represent so far one of the most promising catalysts for ORR and MOR in fuel cells. (9, 53-55) This work is believed to open a new and exciting possibility for enhancing the performance of fuel cell catalysts, and our synthesized high-aspect-ratio 1D aligned nanostructures may also be useful as sensors and in other electrochemical applications.

2.1 Synthesizing 1D Aligned Pt–Ni Nanostructures
For synthesizing the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures, AAO membranes with different aspect ratios (∼1300, 500, and 200) were fabricated by a two-step galvanostatic anodization process in 0.3 M oxalic acid solutions using our recently reported procedures (52) (step a in Figure 1). Briefly, high purity aluminum foil (99.999%, Goodfellow) was annealed at 450 °C for 2 h to eliminate the internal stress and then ultrasonicated in acetone, ethanol, and double-distilled water for ∼30 min. Prior to anodization, the aluminum foil was first electropolished for 20 min under a constant dc voltage of 7 V at 10–15 °C in a solution of ethanol/perchloric acid (5:1, v/v). Afterward, the aluminum foil was anodized in an oxalic acid solution (0.3 M) at 0 °C and constant current densities of 8 mA/cm2 for 6 h. After this was done, the alumina film formed was stripped in a chromic acid/phosphate acid solution (42 mL of H3PO4 and 15.3 g of Cr2O3 in 1 L solution) for 4 h at ∼60 °C. The aluminum foil exhibited regular pits after removal of the alumina (Figure S1, Supporting Information); the sample was anodized again under the same conditions (0 °C and 8 mA/cm2) for 18 h. This anodic process produced an AAO membrane having a thickness of ∼200 μm and pore diameter of ∼150 nm (the aspect ratio is more than 1300). Pores as formed were uniform and almost in a regular hexagonal arrangement; the inner wall of the pores is smooth, vertical, and parallel to each other (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The AAO membrane was peeled off aluminum substrate by a lift-off process that involved selective etching of the unoxidized aluminum in saturated HgCl2 aqueous solution. The barrier layer at the bottom of the AAO membrane was dissolved in a 5% (in mass ratio) H3PO4 solution at 30 °C for 5–10 min. Note that increasing the anodization time to more than 18 h results in a decrease of the thickness of AAO membrane because AAO formation is dynamically balanced between the electrochemical formation process and the dissolution process in acidic media; long-time anodization also results in more formed AAO to be dissolved, leading to a decrease of the thickness of the AAO membrane.
Figure 1
Figure 1. Illustration of the preparation of the AAO membrane with ultrahigh aspect ratio, and synthesis of the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures using the prepared AAO membrane as a template.
The aspect ratio of the AAO membrane can be tuned by altering the anodization time in the second anodization process. For example, tuning the anodization time to 10 and 4 h (keeping the temperature at 0 °C and current density at 8 mA/cm2) we prepared the AAO membrane with a thickness of ∼70 and 35 μm, respectively. However, the pore diameters are ∼150 nm, almost independent of the anodization time (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Therefore, the AAO membrane has aspect ratios of ∼500 and 200, respectively.
To facilitate electrodeposition, one side of the AAO membrane was coated with a layer of platinum film with a thickness of ∼10 nm by high-vacuum evaporation to serve as a working electrode (step b in Figure 1). Electric contact was made to the Pt-coated AAO membrane using a copper wire via carbon conductive epoxy (Kunmin Institute of Noble Metals, China). Then both the coated Pt film and the copper wire were coated with a layer of insulating epoxy to avoid contact of solution with them. Afterward, the working electrode was subjected to electrodepositing the Pt–Ni nanostructures in a solution of 10 mM PtCl62– and 5 mM Ni2+ at a constant potential of −0.55 V (vs saturated calomel electrode, SCE) (step c in Figure 1). Electrodeposition occurred in the pore of the AAO membrane and results in formation of the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures (PtNi0.5). Note that extra care had to be taken, and the electrodepositing current had to be monitored in order to obtain the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures without overgrowing the Pt–Ni film on the surface of the AAO membrane. Usually we terminated the electrodeposition process once we observed a sudden change of the current in current–time profile because this sudden change is an indication of growing the 1D Pt–Ni nanostructures out of the pores of the AAO membrane and starting to form the Pt–Ni film on the surface of the AAO membrane. The SEM image (top view) shows that almost every pore is filled with 1D Pt–Ni nanostructures and that the top surface of the nanostructures is flush with that of the AAO membrane (Figure S4, Supporting Information).
Using similar procedures, we synthesized the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures with Pt/Ni ratios of 1:1 (PtNi) and 1:2 (PtNi2) by controlling the amount of metal precursors in solution. For comparison, we also synthesized the 1D aligned Pt nanostructures. By changing the AAO membrane with different aspect ratios we prepared the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures with aspect ratios of ∼1300, 500, and 200.
2.2 Electrochemical Measurements
Electrochemical measurements were performed with an Autolab PGSTAT302N electrochemical station (Metrohm) at ambient temperature (22 ± 2 °C). A conventional three-electrode system was used with the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures as a working electrode and a Pt sheet (∼1 × 1 cm) and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the counter electrode and the reference electrode, respectively. After etching away the AAO membrane using 6 M NaOH (step d in Figure 1), MOR in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution was studied as a model reaction system to characterize the electrocatalytic characteristics of the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructure electrode with various molar ratios of Pt/Ni and different aspect ratios (step e in Figure 1). The electrolyte solution was purged with high-purity nitrogen for at least 30 min prior to each electrochemical measurement, and the nitrogen environment was then kept over the solution to prevent the solution from oxygen.
2.3 Instruments
Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images were recorded using a JSM-7600F field-emitting scanning electron microscope. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and element analysis mapping were carried out on a JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope. The compositions of the prepared Pt–Ni nanostructures were evaluated by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES, Prodigy, Teledyne Leeman Laboratories) measurements and EDS analysis. EDS was recorded with an Oxford Link ISIS energy-dispersive spectrometer fixed on the microscope. Crystalline structures of the prepared nanostructures were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku/Max-3A X-ray diffractometer) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded on an ESCALAB 250 XPS spectrometer (VG Scientifics) using the monochromatic Al Kα line at 1486.6 eV. Binding energies were calibrated with respect to the C (1s) peak at 284.6 eV. The peak was analyzed based on curve fitting with a mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian line shape using the XPS PEAK program (version 4.0).

3.1 Synthesizing the 1D Aligned Pt–Ni Nanostructures
When the Pt film-coated AAO membrane was biased with a constant potential of −0.55 V (vs SCE) in a solution containing PtCl62– (10 mM) and Ni2+ ions (5 mM), the precursors could be reduced and deposited in the pores of the AAO membrane, producing the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures. After etching away AAO membrane, we can observe that the Pt–Ni nanostructures are well aligned and uniform in diameter (Figure 2a–c). Cross-sectional SEM images show that the Pt–Ni nanostructure has a diameter of ∼150 nm (Figure 2b) and a length of ∼200 μm (Figure 2c), and thus, the aspect ratio is more than 1300. The diameter of the nanostructure agrees well with that viewed from the TEM image of the single Pt–Ni nanostructure (Figure 2e). The TEM image also indicates that Pt–Ni nanostructure is remarkably uniform. The diameter and length of the Pt–Ni nanostructures are comparable with the diameter of the pores and the thickness of the AAO membrane used as template (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Note that the highly aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures can be produced on a large scale as viewed from the SEM image at low magnification (Figure 2d). These results imply that our AAO membrane can be used as a template for synthesizing the 1D aligned nanostructures with ultrahigh aspect ratio.

(g and h) EDS analysis and XRD patterns, respectively, of the synthesized PtNi0.5 nanostructures. Images were recorded after etching away AAO membrane. (Inset in e) Typical SAED patterns of the PtNi0.5 nanostructures.
Due to its low redox potential as compared to Pt, Ni loss may occur during reduction of Ni2+ and PtCl62– ions. Therefore, the compositions of the prepared Pt–Ni nanostructures were estimated by EDS analysis and ICP–AES measurement. Typical EDS results reveal the presence of Pt and Ni, and no other metallic element is detectable (Figure 2g; note that EDS has been recorded in different areas; EDS depicted here represents only one of the typical results), implying that the electrodeposited nanostructures are Pt–Ni. The atomic ratio between Pt and Ni obtained by EDS and ICP-AES measurements is ∼1:0.49, which is very close to the nominal values (1:0.5), suggesting that the molar ratio of Pt/Ni in the nanostructures is almost the same as that of precursors in the deposition solution.
HRTEM image recorded for PtNi0.5 shows dominant formation of the face-centered cubic (fcc) (111) lattice image (Figure 2f). The lattice spacing is observed to be 0.223 nm, which is in good agreement with that obtained from d-spacing calculation from an XRD pattern (discussed below). However, this value is slightly lower than that of the Pt (111) plane (0.227 nm) (6, 17) because of a contraction of the lattice upon substitution of Pt with the Ni atom (56) (Ni atoms are 11% smaller relative to Pt atoms). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (inset in Figure 2e) of the synthesized nanostructure shows concentric rings composed of bright discrete diffraction spots, indicating that the Pt–Ni nanostructures are polycrystalline with a high degree of crystallinity.
XRD patterns of the prepared Pt–Ni nanostructures demonstrate the characteristic peaks of the Pt fcc structure (such as 40.5°, 46.9°, 68.4°, and 82.4° corresponding to the plane of (111), (200), (220), and (311), respectively); no characteristic peaks of Ni are detected (Figure 2h), indicative of formation of an alloy of Pt and Ni. These characteristic peaks shift slightly to higher angles as compared to those of Pt (JCPDS 04-0802), thereby indicating contraction of the lattice upon substitution of Pt with Ni. This result is in good agreement with that obtained from HRTEM analysis. The values of d spacing and lattice parameter (a) of Pt in PtNi0.5 were calculated to be 0.223 and 0.3869 nm (the value of d was calculated using Bragg’s equation 2d sin θ = nλ, and the value of a was calculated using the equation dhkl = a/(h2 + k2 + l2)1/2 of the fcc system), respectively, showing a decrease in these parameters in the Pt–Ni nanostructures in comparison with those in Pt (∼0.226 and 0.3921 nm, respectively). These results suggest replacement of Pt atoms by Ni atoms, further proving formation of the Pt–Ni alloys. Additional evidence of formation of the Pt–Ni alloys comes from the element analysis mapping, which reveals the uniform distribution of Pt and Ni throughout the entire PtNi0.5 nanostructures without agglomeration (Figure S5, Supporting Information). Both XRD and HRTEM results indicate that the geometric environment of the Pt atoms in 1D Pt–Ni nanostructures is different from that of pure Pt because of formation of an alloy with Ni. The change in geometric or atomic configuration may affect the electronic structures of Pt, (57) leading to an enhanced electrocatalytic activity for MOR (see below).
By altering the amount of metal precursors, we synthesized 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures with a Pt/Ni ratio of 1:1 (PtNi) and 1:2 (PtNi2). EDS analysis and ICP-AES measurement confirmed that the atomic ratios of Pt/Ni in the nanostructures were almost the same as those of PtCl62–/Ni2+ in solution. The values of d spacing and lattice parameter (a) of Pt were ∼0.222 and 0.3852 nm in PtNi and ∼0.221 and 0.3848 nm, respectively, in PtNi2 nanostructures, showing formation of Pt–Ni alloys. These results further indicate that the compositions of the prepared 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures can be tuned by adjusting the concentrations of the PtCl62– and Ni2+ ions.
By analogy, we synthesized 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures (using PtNi as an example) having a length of ∼70 and 35 μm (Figure 3c and 3g), respectively, using an appropriate thickness of AAO membranes as templates. Synthesized PtNi nanostructures are well aligned and uniform (Figure 3a, 3b, 3e, and 3f). The diameter of PtNi is ∼150 nm (Figure 3b and 3f), and thus, the aspect ratio is ∼500 and 200, respectively. The diameter and length of the PtNi nanostructures agree well with the diameter of pores and the thickness of AAO membrane we used (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Similar to the Pt–Ni nanostructures with an aspect ratio over 1000, PtNi with aspect ratios of ∼500 and 200 can also be produced on a large scale (Figure 3d and 3h), implying the aspect ratio (diameter and length) control of the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures is achievable merely using templates of the appropriate aspect ratio.

PtNi nanostructures were synthesized using AAO as template by electrodeposition approach in the solution of 10 mM PtCl62– and 10 mM Ni2+ ions under a constant potential of −0.55 V. Images were recorded after etching away AAO membrane.
3.2 Composition-Dependent Electrocatalytic Characteristics of the 1D Aligned Pt–Ni Nanostructures
Having synthesized and characterized the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures with ultrahigh aspect ratio, we study the composition-dependent electrocatalytic activity of the nanostructures (using the aspect ratio of ∼1300 as an example) for MOR in acidic solution (0.5 M H2SO4) as a model reaction using voltammetry (CV). CV of the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution showed typical Pt characteristics (Figure S6, Supporting Information) and served to evaluate ECSAs based on the hydrogen adsorption/desorption charges, assuming 210 μC/cmPt2. (6, 56) ECSAs were estimated to be ∼70, 100, and 80 m2/gPt for PtNi0.5, PtNi, and PtNi2, respectively, which are ∼1.2, 1.8, and 1.3 times, respectively, that of 1D aligned Pt nanostructures (∼60 m2/gPt). Note that the deposited platinum film on the back side of the AAO membrane should not contribute to the ECSAs of the Pt–Ni nanostructures because it has been coated with a layer of insulating epoxy to prevent solution contacting with it. Such a high ECSA value makes the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures not only have large number of electrochemically active sites per gram of the catalyst but also easily accessible for transferring the electrons to and from the electrocatalyst surface. These features may significantly enhance the electrocatalytic activity of the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures.
Figure 4 compares the electrocatalytic performances of the 1D aligned Pt, PtNi0.5, PtNi, and PtNi2 nanostructures recorded in a H2SO4 solution (0.5 M) with 0.5 M methanol in which both mass activities (currents were normalized by the loaded Pt mass, Figure 4A) and specific activities (currents were normalized by ECSAs, Figure 4B) were compared. The peak current density (at ∼0.64 V, in the positive direction sweep) of the 1D aligned PtNi0.5, PtNi, and PtNi2 is ∼263 (curve b in Figure 4A), 657 (curve d in Figure 4A), and 368 mA/mgPt (curve c in Figure 4A), respectively, which is ∼2.2, 5.4, and 3.0 times that of the 1D aligned Pt nanostructures (∼122 mA/mgPt, curve a in Figure 4A). After being normalized by ECSAs, the catalytic peak current density of the aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures still shows a value that is ∼1.9 (0.52 mA/cmPt2 for PtNi0.5, curve b in Figure 4B), 3.3 (0.89 mA/cmPt2 for PtNi, curve d in Figure 4B), and 2.3 (0.63 mA/cmPt2 for PtNi2, curve c in Figure 4B) times that of the 1D aligned Pt nanostructures (0.27 mA/cmPt2, curve a in Figure 4B).

Cyclic (A and B), linear-sweep voltammetric (C), amperometric responses (D) for oxidation of 0.5 M methanol in H2SO4 solution (0.5 M) catalyzed by 1D aligned Pt nanostructures (a) and Pt–Ni nanostructures at the composition of PtNi0.5 (b), PtNi2 (c), and PtNi (d). Currents in A and C were normalized with the mass of Pt loading on the electrode surface; current in B was normalized with ECSAs. Cyclic and linear-sweep voltammograms were recorded at a 50 mV/s. Current–time profiles in D were recorded under a constant potential of 0.64 V (vs SCE). Current densities (representing mass activities) have been normalized with the highest current densities (in mA/cmPt2) obtained at the 1D aligned Pt (a), PtNi0.5 (b), PtNi2 (c), and PtNi (d) nanostructures.
The ratio of the forward anodic peak current (if) to the backward anodic peak current (ib) is an important index and can be used for evaluating the poison tolerance of Pt-based catalysts in MORs. (58) A higher if/ib value indicates more effective removal of the poisoning species on the catalyst surface, which means that methanol can be oxidized much more efficiently. The if/ib of the 1D aligned PtNi0.5, PtNi, and PtNi2 is ∼1.6, 1.4, and 1.4, respectively. All values are much higher than that of 1D aligned Pt nanostructures (∼0.93), suggesting that the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructure surface has less carbonaceous species accumulation and therefore good poison tolerance.
The onset potential of MOR catalyzed by the 1D aligned PtNi0.5, PtNi, and PtNi2 is ∼275 (curve b in Figure 4C), 200 (curve d in Figure 4C), and 240 mV (curve c in Figure 4C), respectively, which has a ∼125, 200, and 160 mV negative shift compared with that 1D aligned Pt nanostructures (∼400 mV, curve a in Figure 4C), implying that the MOR is easier to undergo on the surface of the Pt–Ni nanostructure electrocatalysts. Furthermore, at any given oxidation current the oxidation potential on the Pt–Ni nanostructures decreases in the order PtNi2, PtNi0.5, and PtNi (curves b–d in Figure 4C). They are certainly lower than that on Pt nanostructures (curve a in Figure 4C), indicating higher catalytic performance of the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures for MORs.
The composition-dependent stability of 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures was evaluated by chronoamperometric (CA) measurements under a constant potential of 0.64 V and compared with that of 1D aligned Pt nanostructures. Polarization currents decrease rapidly at the initial stage (Figure 4D). However, anodic currents of the Pt–Ni nanostructures (curves b, c, and d) are higher than that of Pt nanostructures (curve a) during the entire time range, indicative of high electrocatalytic stability of the Pt–Ni nanostructures in comparison with the Pt nanostructures. The oxidation currents at a time of 2000 s remain ∼3%, 10%, 18%, and 35% of their respective initial value for the 1D aligned Pt (curve a), PtNi0.5 (curve b), PtNi2 (curve c), and PtNi nanostructures (curve d), respectively, showing a composition-dependent stability.
These results demonstrate that the electrocatalytic activity of the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures is composition dependent. Increasing Ni content from 0.5 to 1 in the nanostructure can enhance its electrocatalytic activity, which reaches its highest value at a Pt/Ni molar ratio of 1:1. Further increasing the Ni content, for example, 1:2, significantly decreases the electrocatalytic activity.
The Ni content-dependent catalytic characteristics of the Pt–Ni nanostructures for MOR can be understood based on modification of the electronic properties of Pt by Ni in the nanostructures. XPS measurements show that Pt has various states in the prepared Pt–Ni nanostructures as analyzed by curve fitting with a mixed Gaussian–Lorentzian line shape (Figure 5A). The 4f core-level spectrum consists of two peaks for metallic platinum at ∼70.7 (Pt 4f7/2) and 74.1 eV (Pt 4f5/2) with two more peaks at ∼71.4 and 75.1 eV, which could be assigned to Pt(II) species as in PtO and Pt(OH)2, (59) respectively. A comparison of the relative intensities of those components (metallic Pt, PtO, and Pt(OH)2) shows that the Pt state in the Pt–Ni nanostructures is predominately metallic Pt, which can provide more suitable sites for methanol decomposition than Pt(II).

Analysis of the Pt 4f peaks with respect to the compositions of Pt–Ni nanostructures shows that the Pt 4f peaks shift to lower binding energy (Figure 5B), suggesting that the electronic structure of Pt is modified by alloying with the Ni component. The position of the Pt 4f peak in PtNi0.5, PtNi, and PtNi2 has ∼0.2 (curve b in Figure 5B), 0.7 (curve c in Figure 5B), and 0.5 eV (curve d in Figure 5B), respectively, negative shifts in comparison with that in Pt nanostructures (curve a in Figure 5B), implying that the largest modification occurs at a Pt/Ni molar ratio of 1:1. The change in the binding energy of the metal core level reflects the shift of its d-band center relative Fermi level. (60) The negative shift of binding energy represents the downshift of the d-band center because shifting the d-band center of surface Pt is known to be accompanied by a change in the surface core-level shift in the same direction. (61, 62) The downshift of the d-band center in Pt–Ni nanostructures, in comparison with that in Pt, is in good agreement with that predicted by the Hammer–Nørskov reactivity model, (60, 61, 63-66) which concludes that when a metal with larger lattice constants (Pt in this case, its lattice parameter is 0.3921 nm) is alloyed with metal with smaller lattice constants (Ni, its lattice parameter is 0.352 nm), the d-band center will shift down, resulting from a combination of d-band bandwidth changes upon alloying, followed by d-band shifts to maintain a constant local d-band filling (note that the lattice parameters of PtNi0.5, PtNi, and PtNi2 are 0.3869, 0.3852, and 0.3848 nm, respectively; please refer to section 3.1 for details). According to the Hammer–Nørskov model, (60, 61, 63, 64, 66) there is close correlation between the energy center of the valence d-band center of a metal surface and its ability to form chemisorption bonds. As the d-band center shifts up, a distinctive antibonding state appears above the Fermi level. Antibonding states above the Fermi level are empty, and the bond becomes increasingly stronger as their numbers increase. Thus, strong bonding occurs if the antibonding states are shifted up though the Fermi level (and become empty), and weak bonding occurs if antibonding states are shifted down through the Fermi level (and become filled). (67) The downshifted d-band center in the Pt–Ni nanostructures lowers the density of state on the Fermi level, reduces the Pt–COads bond energy, (68, 69) and weakens the chemical adsorption of oxygen-containing species such as COads on the surface of Pt–Ni nanostructures. (59) Therefore, the electrocatalytic activity of the Pt–Ni nanostructures is improved in comparison with that of Pt itself. Moreover, the Pt–Ni nanostructures exhibit the lowest binding energy at the composition of PtNi, implying the lowest Pt–CO bond energy is reached at this composition. Thus, the electrocatalytic activity of PtNi is the highest among the prepared Pt–Ni nanostructures (PtNi0.5, PtNi, and PtNi2).
3.3 Aspect-Ratio-Dependent Electrocatalytic Characteristics of the Pt–Ni Nanostructures
We next studied the aspect-ratio-dependent electrocatalytic performances of the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures to MOR. Only results for PtNi composition (the Pt/Ni molar ratio of 1:1) at aspect ratios of ∼1300, 500, and 200 are presented, because this composition of the Pt–Ni nanostructures has been proved to be optimum in the prepared 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures (section 3.2). To better compare the electrocatalytic performance of the Pt–Ni nanostructures at different aspect ratios, we also synthesized the PtNi nanoparticles (the Pt/Ni molar ratio is 1:1) with a size of ∼30–50 nm and recorded their electrocatalytic activity to MOR (detailed procedures of the synthesis of the PtNi nanoparticles are presented in the Supporting Information, and their TEM images are depicted in Figure S7, Supporting Information). We compare the ECSAs (Figure 6A), mass activities (in mA/mgPt, Figure 6B and Figure S8A, Supporting Information), specific activities (in mA/cmPt2, Figure 6C and Figure S8B, Supporting Information), stability (Figure 6D), value of the if/ib, and onset potential (Figure S8C, Supporting Information) for MOR at the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures and PtNi nanoparticles.
The ECSA value of the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures at aspect ratios of ∼200, 500, and 1300 is ∼93, 95, and 100 m2/gPt (Figure 6A), respectively, almost independent of the aspect ratios. These values are ∼20% lower than that of PtNi nanoparticles, probably due to the much smaller size of PtNi nanoparticles (∼30–50 nm) in comparison with the diameter of the 1D PtNi nanostructures (∼150 nm).
From a practical viewpoint, the figure-of-merit of an electrocatalyst is its mass activity and specific activity. (40) The latter, even for a unique element, such as Pt, may vary due to the crystallographic orientation of the surface, crystallite size, shape, and morphology. (16, 18, 27, 40, 70) Quite surprisingly, both the mass activity and the specific activity of the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures are much higher than those of the PtNi nanoparticles (Figure 6B and 6C) in spite of a ∼20% lower Pt area for the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures (Figure 6A). For example, the mass activities of the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures at aspect ratios of ∼1300, 500, and 200 are ∼657, 394, and 136 mA/mgPt (Figure 6B, the cyclic voltammetric responses for oxidation of 0.5 M methanol in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution catalyzed by PtNi nanoparticles and 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures at aspect ratios of ∼1300, 500, and 200, respectively, are depicted in Figure S8, Supporting Information), which are ∼8.2-, 4.9-, and 1.7-fold, respectively, better than that of the PtNi nanoparticles (∼80 mA/mgPt). Moreover, the activities of the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures are significantly dependent on their aspect ratios (Figure 6B and 6C).
Figure 6
Figure 6. Comparison of the ECSA (A), mass activities (B), specific activities (C), and stability (D) for the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures at an aspect ratio of ∼1300 (a), 500 (b), and 200 (c) and PtNi nanoparticles (d). Current–time profiles in D were recorded for oxidation 0.5 M methanol in a 0.5 M H2SO4 solution under a constant potential of 0.64 V (vs SCE). Presented current densities (mass activities) have been normalized with the highest current (in mA/cmPt2) obtained at the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures at an aspect ratio of ∼1300 (a), 500 (b), and 200 (c) and PtNi nanoparticles (d). Note that the cyclic voltammetric responses for oxidation of 0.5 M methanol in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution catalyzed by PtNi nanoparticles and 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures at different aspect ratios are depicted in Figure S8, Supporting Information. For better comparison, the values of mass and specific activities of the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures at an aspect ratio of ∼1300 in this figure are same as those depicted in Figure 4 (curve d).
The values if/ib of the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures at aspect ratios of ∼1300, 500, and 200 are ∼1.4, 1.35, and 1.4, respectively, which is higher than that of the PtNi nanoparticles (∼1.2), implying that MOR undergoes more efficiently on the surface of 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures than on PtNi nanoparticles due to effective removal of the poisoning species on the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures. The onset potentials of MOR at the 1D aligned PtNi are ∼200, 230, and 380 mV at aspect ratios of ∼1300, 500, and 200 (Figure S8C, Supporting Information), respectively, which has a ∼210, 180, and 30 mV negative shift compared with that of PtNi nanoparticles (∼410 mV, Figure S8C, Supporting Information), implying that the MOR is easier to undergo on the surface of the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructure electrocatalysts.
The aspect-ratio-dependent stability of the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures for MOR was evaluated by chronoamperometric measurement under a constant potential of 0.64 V and compared with that of the PtNi nanoparticles. Polarization currents at these nanostructures decrease rapidly at the initial stage (Figure 6D; note that the presented currents have been normalized with the highest current (in mA/cmPt2) obtained at the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures at aspect ratios of ∼1300 (curve a), 500 (curve b), and 200 (curve c) and PtNi nanoparticles (curve d), respectively), which is due to formation of intermediate species during methanol oxidation. (71) However, the anodic current densities of the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures (curves b, c, and d in Figure 6D) are higher than that of PtNi nanoparticles (curve a in Figure 6D), indicative of the high electrocatalytic stability of the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures in comparison with the PtNi nanoparticles. Oxidation current densities at a time of 2000 s remain ∼6%, 17%, 20%, and 35% of their respective initial value for the PtNi nanoparticles, and the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures at aspect ratios of ∼200, 500, and 1300 (Figure 6D), respectively, showing a aspect-ratio-dependent stability. These results again confirm the better tolerance to the intermediate species and superior electrocatalytic performance of the prepared 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures in MORs.
The higher activity of the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures as compared to PtNi nanoparticles might be due to the their inherent anisotropic morphology and unique structure, (11) which make 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures preferentially expose certain crystal facets of the former (3, 40) and/or have less surface defects bearing, therefore, a closer resemblance to the surface of large single crystals that exhibit even higher specific activities. (57) Synthesis of such 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures is thus an important step toward fabrication of Pt-based alloy nanostructures that would retain the high activity. The larger aspect ratio of the present PtNi nanostructures compared to that of PtNi nanoparticles is believed to open new and exciting possibilities for improving the performance of the fuel cell at high current densities. Since 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures are stretching out from the surface, electroactive species (such as methanol, O2 etc.) diffusion toward the catalyst surface might be improved. From a practical viewpoint, this orientation of the PtNi nanostructures with high aspect ratio also allows larger quantities of the proton-conducting ionomer to be applied: the optimum ionomer thickness is usually set by the height of electrocatalyst above the surface. More ionomer than this would cover the electrocatalyst surface and therefore decrease the ability of species to diffuse toward the catalyst surface. (72) Yet, large quantities of proton conducting ionomer are desirable to improve the overall transport of protons through the electrodes. (72) In fact, it has been predicted by a comprehensive model that ionomer contents of 50–70 wt % should be optimum, provided that the electrode porosity be not reduced by such high ionomer contents. (73) Therefore, the high aspect ratio of the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures can be expected to significantly increase the optimum quantity of ionomer in the fuel cell cathode and anode and thus improve the performances of the fuel cell.

We demonstrated the synthesis of the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures with ultrahigh aspect ratios using AAO membrane as template. The aspect ratio (diameter and length) of the 1D aligned nanostructures can be tuned merely by altering AAO templates of the appropriate aspect ratio. The catalytic activities of the 1D aligned Pt–Ni nanostructures for MOR exhibit a composition- and aspect-ratio-dependent manner, and much higher than those of the 1D Pt nanostructures and 0D PtNi nanoparticles. The 1D aligned PtNi (Pt/Ni molar ratio of 1:1) shows the highest electrocatalytic activity, and it increases in the order 0D PtNi nanoparticles, 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures at aspect ratios of ∼200, 500, and 1300. Use of the 1D aligned PtNi nanostructures as catalyst is believed to open new and exciting possibilities for enhancing the performance of fuel cell catalysts. Moreover, this aligned nanostructure may also be useful as sensors and in other electrochemical applications.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
