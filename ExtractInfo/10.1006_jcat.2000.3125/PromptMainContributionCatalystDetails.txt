Structure and Properties of Oxidative Dehydrogenation Catalysts Based on MoO3/Al2O3
Abstract
The effects of MoOx structure on propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) rates and selectivity were examined on Al2O3-supported molybdenum oxide catalysts with a wide range of Mo surface density (0.4–12 Mo/nm2). X-ray diffraction and Raman, UV-visible, and X-ray absorption spectroscopies showed that the structure of dispersed molybdena depends strongly on the Mo surface density. Two-dimensional MoOx oligomers formed preferentially for Mo surface densities below 4 Mo/nm2. At higher surface densities, these MoOx oligomers coexist on Al2O3 surfaces with three-dimensional MoO3. UV-visible edge energies decrease with increasing Mo surface density, consistent with the growth of MoOx structures. The evolution of near-edge spectral features in the X-ray absorption spectra and the gradual appearance of a Mo–Mo scattering peak in the radial structure function confirmed the growth of MoOx domains with increasing surface density. ODH rates per Mo atom increased with increasing Mo surface density and reached a maximum value for samples with ∼4.5 Mo/nm2; this behavior reflects an increase in the reactivity of surface Mo species, because all MoOx species are exposed at domain surfaces in this surface density range. As also shown for VOx-based catalysts, turnover rates are higher on two-dimensional domains than on isolated monomers and they increase as the MoOx domain size increases. The rates of reduction of MoOx species in H2 or C3H8 were probed using kinetic and X-ray absorption methods; these reduction rates increased in parallel with ODH rates as the MoOx surface density increased, apparently as a result of the ability of larger domains to delocalize the higher electron density that accompanies the reduction process. As the surface density increased above 4.5 Mo/nm2, ODH rates (per Mo atom) decrease, as a result of the loss of accessibility caused by the formation of MoO3 crystallites. For these latter samples, the ODH rate per BET surface area approached a constant value as the surface density increased, because all exposed surfaces in these samples reside within two- or three-dimensional MoOx structures with similar reactivity. The ratio of rate constants for propane ODH and propane combustion reactions increased with increasing surface density and then remained constant for values above 5 Mo/nm2. These effects appear to reflect the tendency of Al–O–Mo species to adsorb alkoxide intermediates and favor their sequential oxidation to COx. Propene combustion rate constants also decreased relative to those for propane ODH as two-dimensional structures form with increasing Mo surface density.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
