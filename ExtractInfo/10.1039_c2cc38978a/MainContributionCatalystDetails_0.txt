The given document discusses the spectroscopic characterization of a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation in a pilot-scale reactor. It does not contain information about improvements in selectivity, conversion, stability or other performance enhancements of the catalyst. The document focuses on using UV-Vis spectroscopy to analyze coke formation and removal on the catalyst during reaction. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for assessing propane dehydrogenation catalyst advancements.
