Operando UV-Visspectroscopy of a catalytic solid in a pilot-scale reactor: deactivation of a CrOx/Al2O3 propane dehydrogenation catalyst†
A novel operando UV-Vis spectroscopic set-up has been constructed and tested for the investigation of catalyst bodies loaded in a pilot-scale reactor under relevant reaction conditions. Spatiotemporal insight into the formation and burning of coke deposits on an industrial CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst during propane dehydrogenation has been obtained.
In the last decade the development and use of spectroscopic methods has matured into an important field of research to characterize catalytic solids at work.1 It allows the investigation of the intricate details of the working and deactivation principles of heterogeneous catalysts. Amongst them, UV-Visspectroscopy has shown to be a powerful method as it can be used to probe e.g. the electronic transitions of organic deposits and d–d transitions of transition metals present in catalytic solids.2 So far, UV-Visspectroscopy has been combined with other characterization methods, including but not limited to EPR, NMR, Raman, IR and XAFS, or integrated with an optical microscope to analyse heterogeneities within and between catalyst grains.3
Here, we present the design, construction and use of a novel pilot-scale reactor, in which specially developed UV-Vis probes are inserted to characterize a catalyst material under reaction conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt to characterize a catalytic solid by a spectroscopic technique installed in a pilot-scale reactor, illustrating the potential to implement these devices in an industrial environment for e.g. catalyst diagnostics. The showcase example is the dehydrogenation of propane into propylene over an industrial Cr/Al2O3catalyst, shaped in the form of 3 mm-sized catalyst bodies. This process is of renewed interest due to the recent boom in shale gas exploitation and the increasing demand for propylene relative to ethylene for the production of plastics.4
Fig. 1 shows the scheme of the pilot-scale reactor designed and built. Details, including design and pictures of the UV-Vis probes, can be found in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†). The reactor consists of a 0.7 L fixed bed reactor placed inside a three-staged oven. The temperature is controlled by three thermocouples placed in a thermowell inside the reactor. Four slots have been made along the length of the reactor, in which UV-Vis probes can be mounted. The first probe is placed approximately at the same height as the first thermocouple, while the second probe is positioned between the second and third thermocouples.
Fig. 1 Scheme of the pilot plant scale set-up for studying catalyst bodies under reaction conditions. Key to this set-up are the in situUV-Vis probes, which can be inserted in different holes made within the reactor tube.
The probe consists of six excitation fibres and one collection fibre, which are connected to a deuterium–halogen light source and an Avaspec 2048 UV-Visspectroscope. The probes are specially designed to operate under the reaction conditions of the pilot-scale reactor. They are installed inside a stainless steel tube, making it possible to flow N2 along its length, which provides cooling and prevents deposition of e.g. coke on the tip. Spectra are saved every 2 min, with 50 accumulations of 40 ms exposure time each. UV-Visspectroscopy has frequently been used to study chromia/alumina catalysts under alkane dehydrogenation conditions on the lab-scale.5 d–d transitions of chromium oxide species can be observed as broad bands in the UV-Vis spectra; Cr6+ species present bands at around 273 and 366 nm, while Cr3+ species typically display absorption bands at around 300, 452, 588 and 616 nm.6 Cr3+ species are proposed to be the active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction, while Cr6+ is considered to be inactive.7 Rapid deactivation is one of the disadvantages related to supported chromia catalysts. High reaction temperatures and low pressures used for the dehydrogenation reaction are optimal conditions for coke formation, which can be followed over time.8 Despite the fact that coke species do not present absorption bands, their formation can be observed indirectly by UV-Vis as the formation of coke leads to darkening of the catalyst and as a consequence an overall increase of the UV-Vis absorption of the catalyst material. Furthermore, during the oxidation–regeneration step, the locally generated heat by coke burning may play a role in the incorporation of active Cr3+ species in the alumina support by migration or entrapment viaaluminium oxide sintering.9
Finally, it is important to carefully control the temperature of the reactor during the different phases of the catalytic cycle in order to obtain an optimal propylene yield and reduce catalyst deactivation. With increasing temperatures, conversion of propane increases, while selectivity towards propylene drops as cracking of reaction products becomes more prevalent.
The potential of the developed operando set-up has been explored by studying the propane dehydrogenation over an industrial catalyst and the reactor is filled with approximately 500 g of CrOx/Al2O3 extrudates mixed with inert material at the extremities of the reactor. The catalyst consists of 20 wt% Cr (a mixture of Cr3+ and Cr6+) and 1 wt% Na on an alumina support. The reaction is performed at approximately 550 °C with a flow of 5000 ml min−1 consisting of 10% propane in 90% nitrogen for 6 h. After the dehydrogenation step, the catalyst is regenerated by using a flow of 150 ml min−1 oxygen in 2200 ml min−1nitrogen. The outlet of the reactor set-up is connected to a GC equipped with FID (Porabond-Q column) and TCD (Carboxan column) detectors to analyse the reaction products formed. The selectivity and conversion are shown in Fig. 2a. Initially, a high conversion of propane is observed, which gradually drops over time from 47% to 37%. At the same time the selectivity towards propylene increases from 80% to 88%. Such values for the conversion and selectivity are typical for this catalyst material under the applied conditions. Apart from the general trend in the conversion and selectivity, some fluctuations are present that can be attributed to changes in the temperature of the reactor. Fig. 2b shows the temperature measured at the three stages of the reactor related to the reaction time. By comparing Fig. 2a and b we can correlate the changes in selectivity and conversion with the temperature fluctuations within the reactor; an increase in temperature from 550 to 575 °C results in a drop in selectivity from 80 to 60%. These fluctuations occur as the heating system attempts to correct for the loss of heat due to the endothermicity of the reaction before the entire system has reached equilibrium.

UV-Visspectra of the catalyst are collected continuously during the reaction in order to monitor coke deposition. In Fig. 3a the spectra collected with the bottom probe during the dehydrogenation step are shown. At the start, Cr3+-species characterized by UV-Vis bands at around 300, 450 and 620 nm are identified. With time on stream, coke is deposited on the catalyst surface and the UV-Vis absorption increases over the entire range of wavelengths. After 2 h, the spectral features of the Cr3+-species are difficult to identify due to the darkening of the catalyst provoked by coke formation. This process becomes more prevalent during the rest of the cycle resulting in featureless and noisy spectra. In Fig. 3b, UV-Visspectra taken with the bottom probe during the oxidation–regeneration step are shown. During the first 2.5 h, no changes are observed in the spectra but within the next 30 min, the coke is combusted and the original spectrum with the respective Cr features is recovered. UV-Visspectra of the catalyst material have also been collected for the top probe during dehydrogenation and oxidation–regeneration (Fig. S4, ESI†).
Fig. 3 Operando UV-Visspectra obtained for the bottom probe (a) of the dehydrogenation and (b) during the oxidation cycle as a function of time.
In order to study the coke deposition and combustion rate at different catalyst bed heights over time, the absorption was determined in the region between 600–700 nm by averaging all data points. The spectra obtained for both probes are compared by normalizing these values, as shown in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4a it is clearly visible that the formation of coke during the dehydrogenation step is faster at the top of the reactor as compared to the bottom where coke deposition is a gradual process. A similar analysis has been performed on the UV-Vis spectra during the oxidation–regeneration step and the results are given in Fig. 4b. At the top of the reactor the coke is readily combusted within 30 min, while this process requires 3 h for the bottom part of the reactor. In both cases, the drop in UV-Vis absorption is rapid, which suggests that coke combustion is fast and that it takes place as a front, travelling through the reactor bed over time. This finding is corroborated by the heat released during combustion as measured at different points in time by the three thermocouples (Fig. S5, ESI†). In a related experiment, the reaction was halted after one hour of dehydrogenation to examine the individual CrOx/Al2O3 extrudates. It was clear that the few extrudates measured by the UV-Vis probe during the reaction were representative of that height of the reactor. Furthermore, it was apparent that catalyst particles had a different colour, depending on the height of the bed. This is in agreement with the observations made with operando UV-Visspectroscopy.

Summarizing, the results presented above illustrate the possibility of studying industrially relevant catalyst extrudates by operando UV-Visspectroscopy under realistic reaction conditions in a pilot-scale reactor set-up. This new design allows for in situ monitoring of coke formation and combustion by following the UV-Vis absorption intensity. Moreover, by using probes located along the catalyst bed, it is possible to follow the spatiotemporal differences in the rate of coke deposition and combustion.
