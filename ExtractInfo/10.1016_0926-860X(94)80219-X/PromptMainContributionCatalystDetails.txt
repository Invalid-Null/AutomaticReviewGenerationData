Characterization of vanadia supported on amorphous AlPO4 and its properties for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
Abstract
Vanadium oxide supported on amorphous aluminium phosphate (0.2–15 wt.-% V) has been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), surface area, Fourier transform (FT) Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy, and used for catalytic oxidation of propane, n-butane and toluene. At low vanadium concentrations, ⩽ 2 wt.-% V, formation of highly dispersed vanadyl species is indicated by Raman and XPS measurements. The vanadyl species is after dehydration/calcination characterized by a Raman band at 1031 cm−1, At 6 wt.-% V the amount of highly dispersed vanadyl species is lower and tetrahedral vanadium species and crystalline V2O5 are formed. The tetrahedral vanadium species is characterized by an infrared band at 929 cm−1 , and the amount appears to increase somewhat up to 15 wt.-% V. Both Raman and XRD indicate a strong increase in V2O5 formation at 10 and 15 wt.-% V. XRD also reveals partial crystallization of A1PO4 affected by high vanadium concentrations. FT-IR studies of carbon monoxide adsorbed on pretreated catalysts (oxidation (O2) at 500°C/ reduction (CO) at 500°C) indicated that vanadium species had reacted with aluminium and phosphorus surface hydroxyl groups, forming Al-O-bonded and P-O-bonded species. The latter is abundant at low vanadium loading, but after a more severe pretreatment involving oxidation at 800°C followed by reduction at 500°C, the Al-O bonded species is dominating. Further evidence for formation of Al-O-bonded and P-O-bonded vanadium species is the decrease of P-OH and Al-OH IR band intensities. The activities for oxidation of propane, n-butane and toluene increase with the vanadium loading. Acidic support sites show activity for dealkylation of both toluene and propane. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is best performed at 6 wt.-% V, which is associated with the presence of tetrahedral vanadium species. A lower selectivity at higher loading is associated with more active and less selective sites on V2O5.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
