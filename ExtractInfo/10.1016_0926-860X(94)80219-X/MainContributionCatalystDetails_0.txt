The given document discusses Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH) to convert propane to propylene using vanadium oxide supported on amorphous aluminium phosphate as the catalyst. However, it does not specifically pertain to improvements in propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document mainly characterizes the catalyst composition and structure at different vanadium loadings. While catalytic performance for propane oxidation is reported, there is no discussion of specific enhancements to selectivity, conversion, stability or other metrics.
