A novel integrated thermally double coupled configuration for methane steam reforming, methane oxidation and dehydrogenation of propane
Abstract
The goal of this study is the simultaneous production of synthesis gas, hydrogen and propylene in a thermally double coupled steam reformer reactor. This reactor has three concentric tubes where the exothermic reaction of methane oxidation is supposed to occur in the middle tube and the inner and outer tubes are considered to be endothermic sides of steam reforming and propane dehydrogenation, respectively. The motivation is to combine the energy efficient concept of coupling one exothermic reaction with two endothermic reactions, enhancement of synthesis gas production, propylene and hydrogen production and also producing two different H2/CO ratio streams of syngas. A steady state homogeneous model of fixed bed for three sides predicts the performance of this new configuration. The simulation results are compared with corresponding predictions of the conventional steam reformer. The results prove that synthesis gas production is increased in a thermally double coupled reactor in comparison with conventional steam reforming. In addition, the thermally double coupled reactor reduces the capital and operating costs by reducing the reactor size and consumption of energy.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, there has been an enormous increase in energy demands due to fast growing of industrial development and population of the world. The shortage of fossil fuels as a main energy sources has brought energy crisis. In order to eliminate fossil fuel dependence, comprehensive research has been carried out on searching alternative energy resources. Natural gas is recognized as one of the cleanest and most abundant fossil fuels utilized in various industrial processes. Different technologies are today available to convert natural gas to future energy carriers such as synthesis gas of which chemical conversion is of great interest. Conversion increases the value of the raw material 3–10 times (Løvik, 2011). Synthesis gas can be an excellent candidate for future energy carrier due to its high potential energy.
1.1. Synthesis gas
Synthesis gas or syngas is a major route from hydrocarbons to many vital chemical products consisting primarily of H2 and CO. Syngas can be produced from Natural Gas (NG), refinery off-gases, naphtha, heavy hydrocarbons and also from coal. Hydrogen has been considered as a clean and renewable energy carrier to support energy consumption. Hydrogen has characteristics of an environmentally friendly, efficient, safe and sustainable energy source (Heinzel et al., 2002, Lokurlu et al., 2003). The products of hydrogen combustion are water and a tiny amount of NOx which can be reduced by proper methods. The use of hydrogen in energy sector enhances the security of energy supply and improves economic competitiveness (Muller-Langer et al., 2007). Hydrogen has the best energy-to-weight ratio of any fuel. A fuel which contains higher proportion of hydrogen provides more energy (Sun et al., 2012). Therefore, pure hydrogen would be the leading fuel, which can satisfy the increasing demand for many processes such as: methanol, electricity, ammonia, aniline, oil refining, fuel cell, vehicle engines, power plants, etc. (Itoh et al., 2008, Brown, 2001). Several processes have been widely investigated as primary processes for converting hydrocarbons or alcohols into hydrogen, including steam reforming (Lee and Park, 1998, Ko et al., 1995, Rahimpour and Alizadehhesari, 2009, Rahimpour et al., 2010, Seo et al., 2008a, Seo et al., 2008b, Yu et al., 2009), partial oxidation (Wang et al., 2009, Kim et al., 2004, Gao et al., 2008), auto-thermal reforming (Takeguchi et al., 2003, Youn et al., 2008a, Youn et al., 2008b), and CO2 reforming (Luna and Iriarte, 2008, Nandini et al., 2006). It must be noted that hydrogen production must be low in CO2 emissions and other pollutants. Among all mentioned technologies, catalytic steam reforming of natural gas as a feasible process is widely used for hydrogen production, 80–85% of the world's total hydrogen production is provided by this method (Simpson and Lutz, 2007).
1.2. Steam reforming
Steam reforming technology is the most commercial method for synthesis gas (CO, H2) production, the hydrogen cost is less than hydrogen produced by using renewable energy sources or from gasification of solid fossil fuel (Rostrup-Nielsen, 1993, Tugnoli et al., 2008). Steam reforming may involve several catalytic steps: desulfurization of the fuel, steam reforming of methane, a water gas shift reactor and purification of hydrogen using the PSA unit. This method is suitable for light hydrocarbons such as natural gas (mainly CH4), naphtha, and liquefied petroleum gas (Ryden et al., 2006). Three main catalytic reactions involved in steam reformer reactor are steam reforming of methane (SRM) and the water–gas shift reaction.

Conventional steam reformer consists of vertical tubes packed with Ni-based catalyst located inside the huge furnace. The required heat for endothermic reforming reaction is provided by direct combustion of fuel in the furnace. Therefore, the reformer tubes are under very high thermal stress (Brown, 2001). In order to solve this issue, the recuperative coupled reactor has been suggested in which an appropriate exothermic reaction is used as a heat source. Hunter and McGuire (1980) were pioneers in coupling endothermic and exothermic reactions without direct heat transfer. A review on the process intensification for methane steam reforming in a thermally coupled membrane separation technology was studied by Bhat and Sadhukhan (2009). Patel and Sunol (2007) suggested a thermally coupled membrane reactor that is composed of the three channels for methane steam reforming. A numerical model for natural gas, steam reforming and coupling with a furnace was developed by Ventura and Azevedo (2010). In an interesting idea, Ryden and Lyngfelt (2006) studied steam methane reforming coupled with a chemical looping combustion reactor in order to enhance H2 production with CO2 capture.
1.3. Catalytic oxidation of methane
Today, steam reforming and partial oxidation are the main technologies to produce synthesis gas from natural gas. However, there are two main operational issues in producing synthesis gas by using these methods; Firstly, obtaining the suited H2/CO ratio and the second is reaching to high methane conversion and avoiding coke deposition (Jiang et al., 2007). For the characteristics of undesired H2/CO ratio of steam methane reforming for production of methanol and Fischer–Tropsch Synthesis and also high energy cost due to its endothermic reaction, alternative routes have been investigated. In this way, many other methods have been studied, including: carbon dioxide reforming (Mark et al., 1997, Bradford and Vannice, 1999), the partial methane oxidation (Mallens et al., 1997, Nakagawa et al., 1998), combinations of these reaction routes (Choudhary et al., 1995, Choudhary et al., 1998, Ruckenstein and Hu, 1998) and Tri reforming (combination of CO2 reforming, steam reforming, and partial oxidation) (Song, 2001). An effective option is to use catalytic oxidation of methane, which combines steam methane reforming and total combustion of methane in a single reactor. Four catalytic reactions of (1), (2), (3), (4) are used to describe the oxidation of methane:

This reaction is exothermic, so that no need for an external heat supply and leads to significant reduction of the total costs. In addition, the heat of reaction can be a source of energy supply for one or two suitable endothermic reactions like steam reforming and propane dehydrogenation in a thermally coupled reactor.
1.4. Dehydrogenation of propane
In today's scenario, due to rapidly growing demand of alkenes, industrial procedure of corresponding alkanes dehydrogenation has received much attention. Alkenes, especially ethylene and propylene, are indispensable raw materials for numerous petrochemical products (Thapliyal and Deo, 2003). Propylene has wide application as the major feedstock for the production of diverse products, ranging from solvents to plastics like (Sahebdelfar et al., 2012, Budavari, 1996):
•
Petrochemicals such as plastic polypropylene, acrolein and acrylic acid.
•
Films, packaging, caps and closures.
•
Isopropanol (Propan-2-ol), acrylonitrile, propylene oxide (epoxy propane) and epichlorohydrin.
Moreover, the propylene market reached the average growth rate of 5–6% per year (Tullo, 2003).
Propene is basically produced from fossil fuels, petroleum and natural gas via steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation (Warren and Oyama, 1996, Vitry et al., 2004). However, propane dehydrogenation is the economical and shortest route to propylene (Nawaz and Wei, 2011). The dehydrogenation reaction is a highly endothermic and equilibrium controlled; therefore, acceptable equilibrium conversion and reaction rate achieved with higher temperatures and lower pressure (Chin et al., 2011).
1.5. Thermally double coupled reactors
Recently, coupling exothermic and endothermic reactions are more interested in order to improve the thermal efficiency of the process and consequently enhances the production. This type of reactors aims to use energy released by exothermic reaction for proceeding endothermic reaction. In general, the coupled reactors exist into three main classes: direct coupling, recuperative coupling and finally regenerative coupling. At present, recuperative coupling has attracted the most attention of many researchers (Song et al., 2003). Coupling one endothermic and one endothermic reaction are more usual in this field. A double integrated reactor for dimethyl ether synthesis and H2 production from the cyclohexane dehydrogenation has been suggested and mathematical model by Vakili et al. (2011). Rahimpour et al. (2011) also studied the methanol synthesis and the dehydrogenation of cyclohexane to benzene in a thermally coupled membrane reactor with the aim of simultaneous methanol and hydrogen production. In 2010, Iranshahi et al. (2010) investigated an integrated process for the naphtha reforming process and the hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline.
For the first time, economical thermally double coupled reactor in which two exothermic reactions are coupled with one endothermic reaction has been studied by Rahimpour et al., 2013a, Rahimpour et al., 2013b, Rahimpour et al., 2013c. Recently, the simultaneous production of methanol, hydrogen and gasoline in a thermally double coupled reactor has been investigated by Samimi et al. (2013). Also, Farniaei et al. (2013) have inserted dual membrane in the thermally double coupled reactor. In this study, double coupled dual membrane reactor has been used for simultaneous production of methanol, hydrogen and DME.
1.6. Literature review
Many efforts have been made for improvement of steam methane reforming. Arab Aboosadi et al. (2011b) have considered a novel integrated thermally coupled configuration for methane steam reforming. In their simulated reactor, hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline in the exothermic side is used as a heat source for an endothermic reaction of steam methane reforming. The exothermic reaction takes place in the shell side and endothermic reaction occurs in the tube side. Moreover, Arab Aboosadi et al. (2011a) simulated and optimized tri-reformer (TRM) reactor for producing synthesis gas using differential evolution (DE) method. In TRM process, steam reforming, CO2 reforming and partial oxidation of methane occurred in a single reactor. Finally, methane steam reforming and hydrogenation of nitrobenzene in hydrogen perm-selective membrane thermally coupled reactor has been optimized using differential evolution (DE) method by Rahimpour et al. (2013a). Recently, Rahimpour et al. (2013b) have simulated methane steam reforming technology coupled with fluidized bed chemical looping combustion using Fe-based as an oxygen carrier. From previous studies, it is found that there is no modeling information available in the literature about using oxidation of methane as a heat source for steam methane reforming in order to increase H2 production. Therefore, it was decided to study on the mentioned system.
1.7. Objectives
The main goal of this study is an enhancement of synthesis gas production via steam reforming and oxidation of methane theoretically in a thermally double coupled steam reformer (TDCSR) in which propylene and hydrogen are also produced as additional valuable products. Two endothermic reactions of steam reforming and dehydrogenation of propane are coupled with exothermic reaction of oxidation of methane. The motivation is to combine the energy efficient concept of coupling one exothermic with two endothermic reactions, enhancement of synthesis gas production, propylene and hydrogen production and also producing two different H2/CO ratio streams of syngas. A steady state 1-D homogeneous model of the thermally double coupled multitubular reactor is used to estimate the performance of the proposed reactor. Ultimately, the simulation results of the TDCSR were compared with the ones in conventional steam methane reforming.

5. Numerical solution
A governing equation of this model consists of a set of differential algebraic equations including mass balances for all sides with given boundary conditions incorporate with the reaction rates as well as basic assumptions. In order to solve the set of equations, backward finite difference approximation was used. The reactor length is then divided into 100 separate sections and the Gauss–Newton method in MATLAB programming environment was used to solve the non-linear algebraic equations in each section.
6. Simulation and results
Model validation was carried out by comparing the simulated results of the steam reforming side of thermally double coupled steam reformer (TDCSR) with the observed experimental data of the industrial tubular fixed bed steam reformer reactor which is shown in Fig. 4. According to this figure, this simulation result is in good agreement with experimental data.

6.1. Thermal behavior
Fig. 5(a) shows the axial temperature profiles in conventional steam reformer reactor (CSR) as well as the inner endothermic side of thermally double coupled steam reformer (TDCSR). As seen, the temperature profile of CSR is linear while it has a curvy profile in the TDCSR. Although the initial temperature of both configurations is the same, the temperature profile of TDCSR is higher than that of CSR as a result of the positive effect of coupling concept which improves the overall heat transfer coefficient. Since the rates of endothermic reactions increase as temperature increases, syngas production is improved in TDCSR. Fig. 5(b) represents the thermal behavior of all sides of TDCSR. In order to make a driving force for heat transfer from exothermic side to endothermic side, the temperature of endothermic side must be always lower than that of exothermic side. In general, the highest temperature in thermally couple reactors is related to exothermic side where heat generation occurs. Although steam reforming is an endothermic process, its temperature is increased along the reactor; it happens because the amount of heat generated in the exothermic side is much higher than the consumed heat in the endothermic side (see Fig. 6(a)). The most heat transfer takes place in the first half of the reactor because of high temperature difference between both endothermic sides and exothermic side. At the end of the reactor, temperature of each three sides reaches to an equal value since the heat transferred from exothermic side to both endothermic sides, becomes zero.

Fig. 6(a) shows the consumed, heat and transferred heat in the steam methane reforming (inner endothermic side) of TDCSR. The consumed, heat of inner side is lower than the transferred heat from the exothermic side so the temperature increases along the reactor length in this side. At the end of the reactor, both heats have nearly the same profile causes constant temperature. Part of generating heat from the oxidation side is used for driving two endothermic reactions and the rest is used to heat the reaction mixtures in three sides of TDCSR. In the length of 0.12 m, there is a maximum in the consumer and transferred heat, which means that the maximum reaction rating takes place on this part. Fig. 6(b) demonstrates the consumption and transferred heat of outer endothermic side in which propane dehydrogenation occurs. In the first 0.12 m of the thermally double coupled steam reformer reactor, exothermic reaction of hydrogenolysis is the predominant reaction in the dehydrogenation side so the consumed heat decreases in this part. At the length of 1.68 m, the consumed, heat and transferred heat have become the same. After that, the consumed, heat profile became higher than transferred heat results in decreasing the temperature as seen in Fig. 5(b).

6.2. Molar behavior
6.2.1. Steam reforming of methane (inner endothermic side)
Fig. 7(a)–(e) presents the comparison of mole fraction of components in inner endothermic side (steam methane reforming) of TDCSR and CSR. Fig. 7(a) and (b) illustrates the mole fraction of hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO) along the reactor at steady state. Hydrogen and CO are the most desirable products of steam reforming and fortunately their mole fractions increase along the reactor in the double coupled configuration in comparison with CSR, because the thermal effect of coupled reactor provides a good condition for heat transfer and consequently more production. At the end of the reactor, both reactors reach to each others. The CH4 mole fraction is depicted in Fig. 7(c). As can be seen, the consumption rate of CH4 as a main reactant in steam methane reforming process increases in coupled configuration. The difference between CH4 mole fraction profiles in CSR and TDCSR is owing to the temperature increase in endothermic side which causes the increase in reaction rate and CH4 consumption (see Fig. 5(a)). CO2 and H2O mole fraction as an undesired product in TDCSR is compared with the one in CSR in Fig. 7(d) and (e), respectively. Along the reactor length, the water mole fraction in TDCSR is lower than the one in the CSR configuration, but at the end of the reactor it becomes the same as conventional reactor. After the reactor length of 8 m, all mole factions have become constant; it shows the economical feature of the thermally double coupled steam reformer which have the same production in a shorter length than conventional reactor (12 m).

6.2.2. Oxidation of methane (exothermic side)
Fig. 8 demonstrates the mole fractions of components in exothermic side of TDCSR in which oxidation of methane occurred. As the reaction scheme shows, the mole fraction of CH4 and O2, as reactants, decreases along the middle tube; after proceeding 0.12 m of the reactor, mole fraction of O2 reaches to zero as a result of predominating the reaction of methane combustion in this part. As seen, the mole fractions of H2 and CO2 increase as the main product of steam reforming and water gas shift reactions. From 0.12 m to 3.5 m, steam reforming reactions proceed more than total combustion of methane owing to the high temperature of exothermic side; so the mole fraction of hydrogen and CO2 increase. After 3.5 m, the temperature of exothermic side decreases and consequent the reactions of reforming shifts toward reactant side (left side) and as a result, the mole fractions of methane and water increase. The mole fraction of CO of the reactor entrance increases and then decreases as consuming in the water gas shift reaction.

Fig. 9(a) and (b) illustrates the mole fraction of the components of dehydrogenation side. Comparing Fig. 7(a) with Fig. 7(b) shows that the mole fraction of C3H6 and H2 are much higher than C2H4, CH4 and C2H6, for the dehydrogenation of propane is the predominant reaction on this side and the rate of propane cracking and propane hydrogenolysis are low. The mole fractions of propylene and hydrogen reach to 0.358 and 0.6 at the end of the reactor.

Fig. 10 shows the conversion of methane in the CSR and TDCSR. According to this figure, conversion of methane in the TDCSR has a higher profile than CSR along the reactor. However, at the end of the reactor two profiles reach to a single point of 26%. Fig. 11(a) presents the effect of variation of inlet temperature on the output CH4 conversion and H2 yield of methane catalytic oxidation side. It can be understood from this figure that methane conversion and hydrogen yield increase as inlet temperature increase from 800 to 1100 K. Since the rates of endothermic reactions increase as temperature increases, 5.6 and 1.15% enhancement in the methane conversion and hydrogen yield are seen, respectively. Fig. 11(b) represents the propane conversion and hydrogen recovery yield in the outer endothermic side, simultaneously. At the first 2 m of the reactor, propane conversion jump occurs because the temperature of dehydrogenation increased with this length of the reactor (see Fig. 5(b)). After that, the conversion of propane slightly increases. Finally, the conversion of propane and hydrogen recovery yield reach to 91.35 and 89.47%.

6.4. The effect of inlet temperature on production
Fig. 12(a) and (b) shows the methane conversion and hydrogen yield as a function of inlet temperature and length in the methane steam reforming side. Both parameters (CH4 conversion and H2 yield) increase along the reactor length with increasing inlet temperature of steam reforming side due to increasing production of endothermic reactions with increasing temperature. As seen, methane conversion increased from 26.99 to 27.57% when the temperature increased from 793 to 840 K.

In addition, the hydrogen yield of dehydrogenation side increased with increasing temperature and reaches to 87.49% at the end of the reactor.

7. Conclusion
This work focuses on the simultaneous production of synthesis gas, hydrogen and propylene in a thermally double coupled steam reformer (TDCSR). In this novel configuration, the exothermic reaction of methane oxidation has coupled with two endothermic reactions; steam reforming of methane and dehydrogenation of propane to get a heat transfer better. Thermally coupled steam reformer consists of three concentric tubes; the inner, middle and outer sides are used for steam methane reforming, methane oxidation and propane dehydrogenation, respectively. A steady state homogeneous catalytic reaction model is applied to analyze the performance of TDSCR for simultaneous production of synthesis gas, hydrogen and propylene. The simulation results of TDCSR have been compared with corresponding predictions for an industrial steam reformer operated at the same feed conditions. By this narrative configuration, not also the synthesis gas production increased, but also hydrogen, propylene and suitable syngas (with lower H2/CO from the methane oxidation side) produce as additional valuable products. In addition, this thermally double coupled reactor reduces the capital and operating costs by reducing the reactor size and consumption of energy. The result demonstrates that thermally double coupled steam reformer is more economical and efficient than conventional reactor.
