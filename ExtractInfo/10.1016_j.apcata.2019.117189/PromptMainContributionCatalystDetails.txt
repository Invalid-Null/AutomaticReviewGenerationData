1. Introduction
Propene is the second most important olefin after ethylene in the chemical industry with an annual production of almost 100 million tons [1,2]. It is used for the manufacture of a large number of important chemicals such as polypropylene, cumene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, propylene oxide, etc [3,4]. The major part of propene is produced as a byproduct in steam or catalytic cracking of various oil fractions [5,6]. These technologies alone cannot, however, completely fulfill the propene demand. Therefore, several alternative technologies for on-purpose production of propene have been developed and are currently applied. They include methanol-to-olefin [[7], [8], [9]] and methanol-to-propylene [8] processes, metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes [10,11] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [[12], [13], [14]]. A number of PDH processes such as Oleflex, Catofin, and Star are currently used for large-scale propene production [14]. Industrial catalysts are supported materials on the basis of Al2O3 (or crystalline zinc aluminate with some cement (for Star process)) possessing on its surface catalytically active Pt (Oleflex and Star) or CrOx (Catofin) species [13]. Although the applied catalysts are highly active and selective, there are a number of issues associated with their usage, which are high price of Pt and toxicity of Cr(VI)-based compounds. Therefore, both industry and academia are searching for alternatives [14]. In general, materials with supported VOx, GaOx, FeOx or InOx species are considered as possible candidates. The structure of metal oxide species is decisive for PDH performance but can alter under severe reaction conditions (exposure to reducing and oxidizing gases above 550 °C for catalyst regeneration and activation). As a consequence, catalyst performance changes after several dehydrogenation/regeneration cycles.
Recently we have developed a new concept for designing catalysts for non-oxidative alkane dehydrogenation [[15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]]. The main idea behind this concept is that the active sites for the target reaction are defects on the surface of bulk metal oxides possessing high mobility of lattice oxygen but not changing oxidation state of the metal upon removal of lattice oxygen. Verifying such concept, we have introduced alternative economic and environmentally friendly catalysts on the basis of ZrO2. Active sites of such catalysts are considered to be coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) [21,22]. Several options have been suggested for purposeful creating such sites. For example, Ru, Rh or Cu species can be supported on ZrO2-based materials. The supported materials do not demonstrate high activity in the dehydrogenation reaction but facilitate removal of lattice oxygen from ZrO2 to generate Zrcus. The supported metals can, however, provoke ZrO2 overreduction negatively affecting catalyst activity. Another possible method of creation of Zrcus sites is doping of zirconia with the oxides of metals with oxidation state lower than 4+ . However, the presence and the kind of dopant can either increase or decrease the activity because dopants also affect intrinsic activity of Zrcus sites [17]. Thus, the usage of dopants or supported metals for tailoring catalyst activity is not a straightforward method. As concluded in our very recent works [21,22], the size of crystallites of monoclinic or tetragonal ZrO2 is an important factor affecting the ability of this metal oxide to generate Zrcus and accordingly catalyst activity. Importantly, monoclinic ZrO2 performed superior to tetragonal ZrO2 in terms of the rate of propene formation and the selectivity to propene.
Against the above background, the main purposes of the present study were to check whether (i) the activity and particularly propene selectivity of mixed-phase ZrO2 (composed of tetragonal and monoclinic phases) is simply determined by the individual phases or there exists a synergy effect between the phases and (ii) the size of crystallite also plays an important role. One specific purpose was to check if bare ZrO2 can show activity as high as yttrium-doped ZrO2, which has been reported to be the most active ZrO2-based catalyst without any supported metals [17]. Finally, for tailored catalyst design, it was of particular importance to elucidate the kind of species responsible for coke formation and to identify physicochemical properties of ZrO2 enabling to hinder this undesired process. To this end, several preparation methods including precipitation, sol-gel, glycine-nitrate combustion, template, digestion, calcination and controlled thermal decomposition of zirconium oxonitrate were applied for the synthesis of bare ZrO2. The prepared catalysts were tested in the PDH reaction with the purpose to determine the rate of product formation and to identify primary and consecutive reaction pathways in the course of this reaction. The catalytic data together with the results of catalyst characterization by SEM, XRD, H2-TPR, and NH3-TPD enabled us to establish fundamentals relevant for catalyst activity and selectivity.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst synthesis
ZrOCl2·8H2O (>95%, Fluka), NH3 (25% aqueous solution, Roth), ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O (99%, Sigma Aldrich), NH2CH2COOH (99%, Sigma Aldrich), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (98%, Alfa Aesar), Zr(OC4H9)4 (80% solution in 1-butanol, Sigma Aldrich), acetyl acetone (>99%, Merck), ethanol (99.99%, Fischer Chemical), acetone (99.98%, Fischer Chemical), Pluronic F127 (Sigma Aldrich) were used as starting materials.
Sample ZrO2_A was prepared by a precipitation method. Briefly, the required amount of ZrOCl2·8H2O was dissolved in 80 mL of deionized water to obtain a solution with the concentration of Zr4+ of 1.0 M. An aqueous solution of ammonia was then added dropwise to the first solution under stirring until pH value of 9 was reached. The precipitate formed was aged overnight, filtered and washed several times with deionized water until no more chloride ions were identified in filtrate (reaction with AgNO3). The solid was dried at 110 °C overnight and calcined at 550 °C for 4 h.
Sample ZrO2_B was prepared through a combustion method using zirconium oxonitrate with glycine according to Refs. [23,24]. Briefly, about 0.04 mol of ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O were dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water. In a separate flask, about 0.4 mol of NH2CH2COOH were dissolved in 50 mL of water. These two solutions were mixed together, heated up to 100 °C and kept at this temperature under stirring until the solution converted into a viscous gel. Hereafter the gel was calcined at 550 °C for 4 h. During such procedure the gel ignited spontaneously resulting in a release of a large quantity of gases and the formation of foamy product.
Sample ZrO2_C was synthesized by a sol-gel method according to Ref. [25]. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, 9.3 g) was dissolved in 72 g of 0.7 wt% aqueous NH3 solution and stirred for 1 h. Then a mixture of Zr(OC4H9)4 solution (48 g), acetyl acetone (5 g) and ethanol (23 g) was added to the solution dropwise under stirring. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h and then refluxed under stirring at 90 °C for 48 h. The solid was filtrated, washed with acetone, dried at 70 °C for 48 h and calcined at 550 °C for 4 h.
Sample ZrO2_D was prepared by template method using nonionic block copolymer surfactant Pluronic F127 as a template according to Ref. [26]. Firstly, 15 g of Pluronic F127 were dissolved in 150 mL of ethanol at room temperature. Then, 24.2 g of ZrOCl2·8H2O were added to the solution under stirring. The mixture was covered with a polyethylene film and kept under stirring for 2 h. The homogeneous sol was formed and then aged at 40 °C for 3 days. Hereafter, it was dried at 100 °C for 2 days and finally calcined at 550 °C for 4 h.
To synthesize ZrO2_E, approximately 0.35 M aqueous solution of ZrOCl2 was initially prepared upon dissolving the required amount of ZrOCl2·8H2O in 235 mL of deionized water. This solution was then added dropwise under stirring to a 5 M aqueous solution of ammonia with 150% in excess. The formed white precipitate was digested in the mother liquor at 100 °C under open reflux for 192 h according to the procedure described in Refs. [27,28]. Then the solid was filtrated, washed with deionized water until no more chloride ions were detected in filtrate, dried at 110 °C overnight and calcined at 550 °C for 4 h.
Sample ZrO2_F was prepared by calcination of ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O in the muffle furnace at 1000 °C for 5 h. A series of the samples denoted as ZrO2_250, ZrO2_300, ZrO2_350 and ZrO2_400 were synthesized by treating ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O in Ar flow (10 mL·min−1) at 250, 300, 350 and 400 °C for 40 h.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Specific surface area (SBET) of each sample was determined from nitrogen physisorption experiments at 77 K using a Belsorp mini II setup (Bel Japan). Adsorption/desorption isotherms were evaluated according to the BET method. Prior to the experiment, each sample was degassed at 200 °C for 2 h. Total pore volume (Vp) and average pore diameter were calculated from the adsorption isotherm. Pore size distribution over the mesoporous range was determined by applying Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) analysis of the desorption branches.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Theta/Theta diffractometer X’Pert Pro (Panalytical) with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA) and an X’Celerator RTMS detector. Phase composition of the samples was determined using the program suite WinXPOW (Stoe & Cie) with inclusion of the powder diffraction file PDF2 of the international center for diffraction data.
The crystallite size (d) of the individual ZrO2 phases was estimated using the Scherrer equation (Eq. (1)).

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging was performed using a JEOL 7401 F instrument with a working distance of 8 mm and an acceleration voltage of 10 kV in secondary electron imaging mode.
For investigating redox properties of differently prepared ZrO2 samples, temperature-programmed reduction experiments with H2 (H2-TPR) were performed in an in-house developed setup containing eight individually heated continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactors. All samples (200 mg for each material) were firstly calcined in situ in air flow (10 mL·min−1) at 550 °C for 1 h, cooled down in the same flow to room temperature and then purged with an Ar flow (10 mL·min−1) for 15 min. Hereafter, the oxidatively treated samples were heated in a flow of 5 vol% H2 in Ar (10 mL·min−1) up to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 K·min−1. The H2 consumption was measured at the atomic mass unit (AMU) of 2 using an on-line mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320). Ar (AMU of 40) was used as a reference standard. To observe release of water during H2-TPR experiment, the ratio of AMU 18 to AMU 40 was used. The amount of H2 consumed during H2-TPR experiments was calculated by integrating the measured hydrogen profiles over time.
The formation of oxygen vacancies in ZrO2 samples during reductive treatment was confirmed by EPR spectroscopy. EPR spectra of the fresh samples and their counterparts reduced in a mixture of 57 vol% H2 in Ar at 550 °C for 1 h were recorded at room temperature on an ELEXSYS 500-10/12 cw-spectrometer (Bruker) using the following setting: 6.3 mW microwave power, 9.3 GHz microwave frequency (X-band), a modulation frequency of 100 kHz and modulation amplitude of 5 G.
Temperature-programmed ammonia desorption (NH3-TPD) tests were performed to investigate acidic properties of the samples. The experiments were carried out in the same setup as for H2-TPR measurements. Prior to ammonia adsorption, the samples (50 mg for each) were calcined in an air flow at 550 °C for 1 h, purged with an Ar flow (10 mL·min−1) for 15 min, treated with a flow of 57 vol% H2 in Ar (10 mL·min−1) at the same temperature and then cooled down in an Ar flow (10 mL·min−1) to 120 °C for NH3 adsorption. The samples were exposed to a flow of ammonia (1 vol% NH3 in Ar, 10 mL·min−1) at 120 °C for 1 h, then purged with Ar flow (10 mL·min−1) for 5 h to remove weakly bound NH3, and cooled down to 80 °C. Hereafter, they were heated up to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 K·min−1 in Ar flow (10 mL·min−1). Desorbed ammonia was registered by an on-line mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320) at the AMU of 15 (NH). For NH3 quantification, the ratio of AMU of 15 to AMU of 40 was used under consideration of the ratio determined for a calibration mixture consisting of 1 vol%NH3 in Ar. An overall number of acidic sites was determined through integration of temporal profiles of desorbed NH3 and taking into account the total gas flow and ammonia mole fraction in the outlet gas mixture. This number was used to calculate the amount of acidic sites per gram of each catalyst and an apparent density of acidic sites (per square nanometer) under assumption that one NH3 molecule is adsorbed on one acidic site.
For discriminating between Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites, we performed IR measurements of adsorbed pyridine on a Tensor 27 spectrometer (Bruker). Prior to the measurements, the samples were pressed into self-supporting wafers with a diameter of 20 mm and treated in the IR cell according to the following protocol: heating in air to 450 °C for 1 h, flushing with He for 15 min, treating in H2 flow (57 vol% H2 in He) for 1 h. Hereafter, the catalysts were cooled down in He flow to room temperature. Pyridine was adsorbed at 25 °C until saturation. Then the reaction cell was evacuated for removing physisorbed pyridine. After heating the samples in vacuum up to 100 °C, the IR spectrum of adsorbed pyridine was recorded.
2.3. Catalyst testing
All catalytic tests were performed at 1 bar in an in-house developed setup consisting of 15 continuous-flow fixed-bed reactors made of quartz. To determine the rate of propene formation, the tests were carried out at a degree of propane conversion below 10% to assure differential reactor operation. The rate of propene formation was measured after 190 s on PDH stream. The catalysts were heated in an N2 flow up to 550 °C followed by feeding air for 1 h. Hereafter, they were purged with N2 for 15 min, treated in a flow of 57 vol% H2 in N2 for 1 h, purged again with N2 for 15 min and then exposed to a flow of 40 vol% C3H8 in N2 (20 mL·min−1). Eq. (5) was used to calculate the rate of propene formation (
).

In order to identify reaction pathways leading to propene and other, non-desired reaction products including coke, selectivity-conversion dependences were determined. To this end, the PDH reaction was performed at 550 °C and different degrees of propane conversion which were achieved by varying both catalyst amount (0.68–1.8 g) and total flow (6 – 80 mL·min−1) of the feed mixture. Propane conversion (

A long-term stability test was performed at 550 °C in order to demonstrate practical relevance of bare ZrO2. To achieve industrially relevant initial propane conversion of about 30%, 300 mg of the most promising catalyst were loaded into the reactor. A mixture of 40 vol% C3H8 in N2 was fed at a rate of 10 mL·min−1. This experiment consisted of 20 alternating dehydrogenation and oxidative regeneration stages. Each dehydrogenation stage lasted for 1 h, while each regeneration stage included reoxidation in air flow (9 mL·min−1) for 15 min at the reaction temperature. The dehydrogenation and regeneration stage were interlaid by purging with N2 (13 mL·min−1) lasting for 15 min.
The feed components and the reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890) equipped with PLOT/Q (for CO2), AL/S (for hydrocarbons), and Molsieve 5 (for H2, O2, N2, and CO) columns as well as with flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Surface area, morphology and phase composition
In order to understand whether and how the method of preparation of ZrO2 influences its surface and bulk properties, all samples were characterized by BET, SEM and XRD. N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured for all zirconia samples and are shown in Figure S1 in Supplementary Information. According to international union of pure and applied chemistry (IUPAC) classification, isotherms of all samples except ZrO2_F can be attributed to the type IV isotherm typical for mesoporous materials. Isotherm of ZrO2_F does not possess hysteresis and can be related to the type III, indicating the nonporous nature of this material. The specific BET surface areas of the samples are listed in Table 1. Additional textural data obtained from t plot and BJH plot, namely total surface area a1, external surface area a2, total pore volume Vp, average pore radius rp, and the pore size distribution are given in Table S1 and Figure S2 in Supplementary Information. It was found that the specific surface area of the ZrO2 samples synthesized varies between 8 and 267 m2 g−1, while pore volume and average radius vary in the range from 0.09 to 0.64 cm3 g−1 and from 2 to 5 nm respectively. The highest surface area and accordingly pore volume were determined for the ZrO2_E sample prepared by a digestion method. According to Ref. [27], this method of preparation results in zirconia composed of fine crystallites with a low number of non-equilibrium defects. It should be noted that the ZrO2_A sample prepared by precipitation from the same precursor (ZrOCl2·8H2O) has about 7 times lower surface area. Such result confirms the importance of digestion treatment for the production of high-surface area zirconia. The ZrO2_F sample prepared by calcination of zirconium nitrate at 1000 °C possesses the lowest surface area of about 8 m2 g−1. As high temperature favors formation of large crystallites and their sintering, nonporous ZrO2 with a low surface area is obtained. The ZrO2_B sample synthesized by a glycine-nitrate combustion method also possesses low surface area of only 15 m2 g−1. According to this method, a lot of heat is generated due to oxidation of glycine leading to sintering of ZrO2 crystallites [24]. As a result, such material is characterized by low pore volume of 0.09 cm3 g−1. The pore size distribution in the samples ZrO2_A, ZrO2_D and ZrO2_B, ZrO2_C was determined to be in a narrow range from 3 to 6 nm and 1.5 to 2.5 nm respectively, while the samples ZrO2_E, ZrO2_250, ZrO2_300, ZrO2_350 and ZrO2_400 are characterized by a broad distribution of pores from 2 to 10 nm (Figure S2 in Supplementary Information).

Surface area of freshly prepared ZrO2_250, ZrO2_300, ZrO2_350 and ZrO2_400 is shown in Table S2. Since the preparation temperature of such catalysts was lower than the temperature of catalytic tests, we also characterize them after oxidative and reductive treatments at 550 °C; the corresponding SBET values are given in Table 1. The surface area of the treated catalysts is about 40% lower than that of their fresh counterparts. Such effect is due to sintering processes as described elsewhere [31]. It is worth mentioning that these samples as well as ZrO2_B and ZrO2_F were synthesized from the same precursor (ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O), However, the surface area of the ZrO2 samples prepared through controlled thermal decomposition of zirconium oxonitrate is more than 4 times higher than that of ZrO2_B and ZrO2_F. Thus, preparation method has a great influence on ZrO2 specific surface area.
In addition to the specific surface area, the morphology of ZrO2 is affected by preparation method as concluded from our SEM analysis. Selected images are presented in Figure S3 in Supplementary Information. Thus, ZrO2_A exhibits loose morphology, ZrO2_B is characterized by flat shaped agglomerates, while samples ZrO2_C and ZrO2_D are composed of irregularly shaped agglomerates. ZrO2_E has a cotton-like morphology. For the ZrO2_F sample, coral-shaped aggregates with complex hierarchy can be observed. Agglomerates of different size and consisting of flat polyhedrons are seen in the SEM image of ZrO2_300.
The XRD patterns of freshly prepared ZrO2_250, ZrO2_300, ZrO2_350 and ZrO2_400 are shown in Figure S4 in Supplementary Information. No reflections characteristic of any crystalline ZrO2 phase could be identified for ZrO2_250 and ZrO2_300. Thus, these samples can be considered amorphous. The ZrO2_350 and ZrO2_400 are composed of a mixture of monoclinic (m-ZrO2) and tetragonal (t-ZrO2) phases. It should be noted that the above-mentioned samples were prepared by using the same precursor (ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O). Therefore, the difference in phase composition is related to different treatment temperature.
The volume fractions of each phase as well as the size of crystallites for each phase are listed in Table S2 in Supplementary Information. ZrO2_400 has the largest average size of crystallites for both m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2. As ZrO2_250, ZrO2_300, ZrO2_350 and ZrO2_400 were prepared at temperatures lower than the temperature applied for the PDH reaction, we also characterized the samples after their treatment at 550 °C to investigate possible phase transformations. The obtained XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 1 together with those for other (freshly prepared) ZrO2 samples. The phase composition, volume fractions of m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2 phases in each sample as well as an average size of crystallites for each phase are listed in Table 1. It is obvious that ZrO2 samples with different phase composition and crystallinity were obtained. As no clear reflections characteristic of any crystalline phase could be identified in the XRD pattern of ZrO2_E, this sample is considered to be amorphous. The ZrO2_F sample mainly consists of monoclinic phase with large crystallites of about 43 nm. High temperature (1000 °C), at which this sample was calcined, induced growing of crystallites. ZrO2_A, ZrO2_B, ZrO2_C, ZrO2_D, and ZrO2_250 – ZrO2_400 (after second thermal treatment at 550 °C) contain both m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2 phases. The volume-related fractions of m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2 are almost equal in ZrO2_B, ZrO2_D, ZrO2_250, ZrO2_300, ZrO2_350, and ZrO2_400, while the ratio of t-ZrO2 to m-ZrO2 is about 6.7 in the ZrO2_C sample. Importantly, although ZrO2_A, ZrO2_D and ZrO2_E were prepared from the same precursor finally calcined at 550 °C, they have different phase composition as a consequence of different preparation methods used. The smallest crystallites of both phases were determined in the samples prepared by controlled thermal decomposition of zirconium oxonitrate (ZrO2_250, ZrO2_300, ZrO2_350, and ZrO2_400), i.e. about 7 and 9 nm for m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2, respectively. The size of t-ZrO2 crystallites in other samples was slightly larger and reached about 14.5 nm, while m-ZrO2 crystallites were at least two times larger.

3.2. Redox and acidic properties
H2-TPR tests were carried out to investigate redox properties of differently prepared ZrO2 samples. It is generally considered that ZrO2 is a non-reducible metal oxide [32]. Nevertheless, its lattice oxygen or surface OH groups can be partially removed during high-temperature reductive treatment [33]. Fig. 2 shows a flow of H2 at the reactor outlet as a function of temperature in H2-TPR tests. H2 consumption occurred above 400 °C. The presence of several peaks of H2 consumption can be ascribed to the reaction of H2 with different lattice oxygen of ZrO2 [34,35].

Fig. 2. Temperature profiles of H2 flow upon temperature-programmed reduction of different ZrO2 samples with H2.
To compare catalyst reducibility from a quantitative point of view, we calculated the amount of H2 consumed during H2-TPR experiments by integrating the measured hydrogen profiles over time. The obtained amount for each sample is given in Table 2 and indirectly reflects the number of created oxygen vacancies and Zrcus sites accordingly. On this basis, ZrO2_B should possess the highest concentration of such defect sites after reductive treatment with H2 at 900 °C. This number for ZrO2_300 is about 1.5 times lower, while all other samples consumed even less H2. If compare the amount of H2 consumed up to 600 °C, which is close to 550 °C applied for reductive catalyst treatment before PDH tests, this number is the highest for ZrO2_300 and the lowest for ZrO2_D and ZrO2_E. It should be noted that reducibility (both till 900 °C and till 600 °C) of the samples prepared from ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O, i.e. ZrO2_B, ZrO2_F, ZrO2_250 – ZrO2_400, in most cases is higher than that of the samples prepared from ZrOCl2·8H2O (ZrO2_A, ZrO2_D, ZrO2_E). Such result might indicate the influence of the precursor on redox properties of ZrO2.

The creation of oxygen vacancies upon reductive treatment of ZrO2 samples in H2 flow at 550 °C was additionally confirmed by EPR spectroscopy. The EPR spectra of selected fresh and reduced samples are shown in Figure S5 in Supplementary Information. A signal at g-factor of 2.004 characteristic of F+ center (anion vacancy with one electron) was observed in all reduced samples.
NH3-TPD experiments were carried out for determining overall acidity of differently prepared ZrO2. Prior to the adsorption of ammonia, all samples were pre-reduced in 57 vol% H2 in Ar flow at 550 °C for 1 h. As established in our previous study on doped ZrO2-based materials [17], such treatment results in stabilization of Lewis acidic sites, which should be Zrcus cations. The NH3-TPD profiles are shown in Fig. 3. For all samples, a broad asymmetric ammonia desorption peak in the temperature range from 200 to 600 °C is observed. Such peak is related to the presence of different kinds of acidic sites on catalyst surface.

Fig. 3. The NH3-TPD profiles for reduced ZrO2 samples.
An overall number of acidic sites was determined through integration of temporal profiles of desorbed NH3 (Fig. 3). This number was used to calculate an apparent density of acidic sites (per square nanometer) under assumption that one NH3 molecule is adsorbed on one acidic site (Table 2). According to the results obtained, ZrO2_A possesses the highest density of acidic sites. The lowest density was determined for ZrO2_250. It was about 4 times lower than for ZrO2_A. The difference may be related to the fact that the ZrO2 samples are mainly composed of different phases, which actually differ in the number of acidic sites [34,36]. According to Ref [36]. monoclinic phase of ZrO2 possesses higher concentration and basicity of surface hydroxyl groups and the stronger Lewis acidity of zirconium cations in comparison with tetragonal phase. By IR measurements of pyridine adsorbed on prereduced ZrO2 samples we confirmed that their acidity is due to the presence of Lewis but not Brønsted acidic sites (Figure S6 in Supplementary Information).
3.3. Catalyst activity and mechanistic network of propane dehydrogenation
To compare differently prepared ZrO2 samples in terms of their activity for PDH, the rate of propene formation was determined at 550 °C. The catalysts were pre-reduced (57 vol% H2 in N2, 550 °C, 1 h) before starting the dehydrogenation reaction. The rate of propene formation was measured after 190 s on PDH stream at a degree of propane conversion below 10% to assure differential reactor operation. Any effect of mass transport limitations on the measured rate can be excluded as concluded from the Mears and Weisz-Prater criteria (see Supplementary Information). The results obtained are shown in Fig. 4. For comparative purposes, this figure also contains the rate of propene formation obtained over YZrOx which showed the highest activity among ZrO2 promoted by La2O3, Y2O3, Sm2O3, CaO, MgO, or Li2O in our previous study [17].

Fig. 4. Initial rates (after 190 s on PDH stream) of propene formation determined at 550 °C over pre-reduced ZrO2 samples prepared by different methods (bars) and over pre-reduced YZrOx (dash line).
One can see that despite the identical chemical composition the samples strongly differ in their activity. Thus, among all ZrO2 catalysts the sample ZrO2_300 demonstrated the highest rate of propene formation (about 0.33 mmol·g−1 min−1). This activity value was 78% of that of YZrOx and comparable with that (0.31 mmol(C3H6)·g−1 min−1) of the most active monoclinic ZrO2 but superior to that (0.11 mmol(C3H6)·g−1 min−1) of the most active tetragonal ZrO2 [22]. Sample ZrO2_D showed about 34 times lower rate of propene formation than ZrO2_300 and was the least active sample. As the latter material has been prepared at 300 °C, while the PDH activity was determined at 550 °C, we also checked if its activity changes after exposure to high temperature. To this end, 20 PDH/regeneration cycles at 550 °C were carried in total over 48 h. The ZrO2_300 sample showed good durability without losing its high activity from cycle to cycle as concluded from temporal profiles of propane conversion in each cycle (Figure S7 in Supplementary Information). The selectivity to propene observed within the experiment was about 80%–85%.
Selectivity-conversion relationships were recorded for each sample to elucidate an overall mechanistic network of product formation in the course of propane dehydrogenation reaction. Moreover, it was of interest to find out if the PDH reaction follows the same scheme on all ZrO2 samples regardless of the method used for their preparation. Propane dehydrogenation tests were performed at 550 °C after pre-reducing the samples in a flow consisting of 57 vol% H2 in N2 at 550 °C for 1 h. The obtained selectivity-conversion relationships for propene, C1 – C2 hydrocarbons (sum of CH4, C2H6 and C2H4) and coke are shown in Fig. 5(a)–(c), respectively. Additionally, the individual selectivity-conversion relationships for CH4, C2H6 and C2H4 are shown in Figure S8 (a), (b) and (c), respectively. For all samples tested, propene selectivity decreased with increasing propane conversion (Fig. 5 (a)). Such dependence indicates the presence of sequential stage(s) involving propene as intermediate. Extrapolation of the selectivity-conversion relationship for propene to zero degree of propane conversion did not result in 100% propene selectivity. Interestingly, differently prepared ZrO2 samples differ in the primary selectivity to propene (selectivity at almost zero degree of propane conversion). Noticeably, the catalysts prepared from ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O used as precursor (ZrO2_B, ZrO2_F, ZrO2_250 – ZrO2_400) demonstrated much higher primary selectivity to propene than those prepared from ZrOCl2·8H2O (ZrO2_A, ZrO2_D, ZrO2_E). This might indicate that traces (below detection limit of the AgNO3 method for chlorine titration) of chlorine negatively affect the desired selectivity.

Fig. 5. Dependence of selectivity to (a) propene, (b) C1 – C2 hydrocarbons, and (c) coke on propane conversion at 550 °C over reduced ◼ ZrO2_A, ● ZrO2_B, ▲ ZrO2_C, ▼ ZrO2_D, ZrO2_E, ZrO2_F, ZrO2_300, and Δ ZrO2_350 catalysts; (d) proposed mechanistic schemes for propane dehydrogenation over bare ZrO2 samples.
The highest primary selectivity of about 95% was obtained over the samples ZrO2_300 and ZrO2_350 prepared by controlled thermal decomposition of zirconium oxonitrate. ZrO2_C, ZrO2_B and ZrO2_F showed the selectivity of about 90%, while the samples ZrO2_A and ZrO2_D reached about 77% selectivity. The lowest primary selectivity of 72% was determined for ZrO2_E. As the primary propene selectivity is below 100% there should exist one or several other products originated from gas-phase propane. Such products can be coke or C1 – C2 hydrocarbons; no other products formed in significant amounts were detected in our tests. To identify primary product(s) we analyzed the selectivity-conversion relationships for the above products.
As seen in Fig. 5 (b), the selectivity to C1 – C2 products formed over all ZrO2 samples increased with rising propane conversion starting from zero. Such dependence suggests that these products are not directly formed from propane but originate through consecutive transformations of propene. The differently prepared ZrO2 catalysts do not differ strongly in their ability to form C1 – C2 hydrocarbons as their selectivity-conversion relationships are similar (Fig. 5 (b)). In contrast to the selectivity to C1 – C2 hydrocarbons, the primary selectivity to coke is not zero. Thus, coke is another product originating directly from propane. From a mechanistic viewpoint, it can be suggested that the same surface intermediate formed after breaking C–H bonds in propane is converted into propene and coke with, however, different reaction rates. Since the selectivity to coke further increases with rising propane conversion, while propene selectivity decreases, this target olefin also forms coke in a consecutive reaction. It is worth mentioning that the contribution of the different paths to coke is different for different samples. For the samples ZrO2_A, ZrO2_B, ZrO2_C, ZrO2_D, ZrO2_F, and ZrO2_E, coke should mainly be formed through a direct route rather than consecutive propene transformations. For example, the primary coke selectivity for ZrO2_C is about 10%, while it increases to 14% at 40% degree of propane conversion. In comparison to the above mentioned ZrO2 samples, ZrO2_300 and ZrO2_350 showed the lowest primary selectivity to coke but the strongest effect of propane conversion on the selectivity to coke. Therefore, one can conclude that coke formation over these two catalysts basically occurs from propene via sequential stage(s), while direct coke formation from propane plays a minor role.
On the basis of the selectivity-conversion relationships for propene, C1 – C2 hydrocarbons and coke, an overall reaction network of their formation in the course of propane dehydrogenation over bare ZrO2 can be proposed (Fig. 5 (d)). The reaction scheme seems to be similar for all ZrO2 samples regardless of the method of their preparation. A similar scheme was also determined in our previous study dealt with PDH over monoclinic or tetragonal ZrO2 [22]. However, the contribution of propane and propene to coke formation is different for differently prepared samples. The samples prepared by controlled thermal decomposition of zirconium oxonitrate at different temperatures do not differ strongly in their selectivity-conversion dependences. For single-phase ZrO2 tested previously, it was demonstrated that propane-aided pathway of coke formation dominates over m-ZrO2, while both propane- and propene-aided pathways of coke formation over t-ZrO2 coexist [22].
3.4. Factors determining catalyst activity and product selectivity
Next we will discuss the results of catalyst characterization and catalytic tests with the purpose to identify factor(s) affecting the activity and product selectivity in propane dehydrogenation over bare ZrO2. When considering surface Zrcus as catalytically active sites for propane dehydrogenation [[15], [16], [17], [18]], one would expect that the activity will be governed by the surface area of the catalysts. Therefore, the sample with the highest surface area should be the most active one. However, although ZrO2_E possesses the highest surface area (Table 1) it showed quite low activity per gram of catalyst (Fig. 4). This sample will be even less active if the activity were related to its surface area. In this respect, ZrO2_300 with about 3 times lower SBET than ZrO2_E showed an about 11 times higher rate of propene formation. In general, no correlation between the surface area of differently prepared ZrO2 and their activity was established (Figure S9 (a) in Supplementary Information). Thus, high surface area does not automatically guarantee high catalytic activity and some other factors must determine PDH activity of zirconia. As our ZrO2 samples are composed of different phases, we also tried to find a correlation between a certain phase and propene formation. No direct correlation could be identified (Figure S9 (b) in Supplementary Information). For ZrO2_A and ZrO2_F composed of monoclinic ZrO2, the size of crystallites appears to be important. In agreement, with our previous study [21], the lower the size of crystallites, the higher the rate of propene formation was achieved. Overall acidity determined from NH3-TPD tests was also ruled out to be relevant for propene production (Figure S9 (c) in Supplementary Information).
Nevertheless, if we consider ZrO2 reducibility, an obvious correlation of this catalyst property with PDH activity exists. As seen in Fig. 6 (a), the rate of propene formation increases with the amount of H2 consumed up to 600 °C in our H2-TPR experiments. Similar dependence was also observed when considering the amount of H2 consumed up to 550 °C, 650 °C or even 700 °C (Figure S10 (a), (b) and (c), respectively). H2 consumption at higher temperatures (700–900 °C) should not be taken into account, because PDH experiments including catalyst reductive pre-treatment were performed at only 550 °C. H2 consumption with simultaneous formation of water (Figure S11 in Supplementary Information) in O2 absence proves that lattice oxygen of ZrO2 was consumed for this reaction. Thus, anion vacancies and accordingly Zrcus sites were created. The higher the amount of H2 consumed, the higher is the number of such defect sites.

(a) The rate of propene formation (black points) and overall rate of propane conversion into coke (grey points) versus the amount of H2 consumed up to 600 °C during H2-TPR; (b) dependence of coke selectivity at around 10% conversion of propane on the amount of H2 consumed up to 600 °C in H2-TPR test.
As concluded in our previous studies [[15], [16], [17], [18],21], Zrcus sites are active in PDH and are formed during reductive treatment of zirconia. The correlation between the rate of propene formation and the amount of H2 consumed in H2-TPR in Fig. 6 (a) further supports the importance of Zrcus for propane dehydrogenation. Thus, reducibility of zirconia, which can be varied through preparation method, can be considered as a crucial factor determining catalyst activity. In addition, the activity can be increased when ZrO2 will be reductively treated at temperatures higher than the PDH temperature. Figure S12 in Supplementary Information exemplarily shows an increase in the rate of propene formation over ZrO2_A with rising temperature of catalyst reduction.
Now we shall discuss which catalyst property affects product selectivity. It is often reported for dehydrogenation of lower alkanes that catalyst acidity plays a crucial role for coke formation [13,[37], [38], [39]]. As seen in Figure S13 (a) in the Supplementary Information, there is no direct correlation between the number of acidic sites determined from NH3-TPD and the selectivity to coke. Therefore, surface acidity of ZrO2 does not seem to be the main factor determining the formation of this undesired product.
It is also discussed that coke formation over the most of known dehydrogenation catalysts (e.g. Pt- or VOx-based) is a structure-sensitive reaction [13,40]. It occurs more likely on large species, while small species are considered to be more resistant against coke deposition. Taking into account this information, we also analyzed if the size of ZrO2 crystallites affects the selectivity to coke. For mono-phase monoclinic or tetragonal ZrO2 samples, a correlation exists between the size and the selectivity [21,22]. As our present ZrO2 materials are composed of m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2 (Table 1), we considered the size of crystallites of m-ZrO2, t-ZrO2 or an average size of crystallites calculated from that of m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2. For each case, no direct correlation between the selectivity and the size of crystallites could be derived, although some hints are evident that crystallite size is important (Figure S13 (b–d) in Supplementary Information). Amorphous ZrO2 showed the highest selectivity to coke, while the lowest selectivity was determined for the catalysts prepared through controlled thermal decomposition of zirconium oxonitrate (ZrO2_300, ZrO2_350) composed of m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2 with the lowest size of crystallites. For most crystalline materials, the selectivity to coke increased with an increase in the size of crystallites of either m-ZrO2 or t-ZrO2. The difficulty in finding a direct correlation might be due to the different contributions of crystallites of different phases as well as due to a possible impact of m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2 on each other.
A further insight into coke formation was derived from analyzing the overall rate of propane conversion into coke and the selectivity to coke in dependence on ZrO2 reducibility. The selectivity to coke was established to decrease with an increase in the amount of H2 consumed in H2-TPR tests (Fig. 6 (b)), despite the fact that the overall rate of propane conversion into coke increased (Fig. 6 (a)). Such dependence can be explained as follows. The selectivity to coke is a function of the rates of product formation and can be expressed by Eq. (10). As seen in Fig. 6 (a), the increase in the rate of propene formation with rising catalyst reducibility is more pronounced in comparison with the overall rate of propane conversion into coke. Thus, with an increase in reducibility of ZrO2 by a factor of 15 the rate of propene formation increases by a factor of 34.5, while the overall rate of propane conversion into coke increases by a factor of 8 only. As a consequence, the selectivity to coke decreases in favor of propene selectivity.
(10)
Differently strong effects of ZrO2 reducibility on the rate of propene formation and overall rate of propane conversion into coke can be understood if we suppose that there are at least two types of active sites on the surface of ZrO2 where propane/propene can be adsorbed and react. These sites are zirconium cations with different coordination: (i) the cations on flat surfaces with 7 or 6 fold coordination for tetragonal or monoclinic ZrO2 and (ii) the sites with lower coordination (Zrcus), e.g. those located at steps, kinks, or corners of the lattice of ZrO2 or on defect flat surfaces. The importance of the degree of unsaturation of zirconium cations for propene formation is supported by DFT calculations [21] and experimental studies [17]. Thus, it was demonstrated that two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy having, nevertheless, different chemical environment in tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2, are responsible for the homolytic CH bond dissociation. On the basis of the above discussion, we put forward that the first type of Zr sites is responsible for the formation of propene and coke. These products are formed from the same surface intermediate originated from propane. From a mechanistic viewpoint, when such intermediates interact with each other, small aromatic structures are initially formed and then further oligomerized finally yielding coke species. Such transformations are favored at high density of sites responsible for propane activation. The concentration of such sites decreases through removal of lattice oxygen from ZrO2 during reductive catalyst treatment. Zrcus sites are generated accordingly. As the rate of propene formation (r2 in Fig. 5 (d)) significantly increases with reducibility of ZrO2, these Zrcus sites should show higher intrinsic activity for propene formation than zirconium cations with the coordination equal to that of the cations located on flat surfaces. The overall rate of propane conversion into coke is also affected by ZrO2 reducibility but to a lesser extent than the rate of propene formation (Fig. 6 (a)). Moreover, the contribution of propane-assisted pathway (r1 in Fig. 5 (d)) to coke formation is also influenced by this property of ZrO2. For the most active catalysts (easily reducible ZrO2), coke formation from propane plays a minor role, whereas propene conversion into coke (r3 in Fig. 5 (d)) becomes to dominate but with a significantly lower rate than the rate of propene formation. This undesired process can take place with participation of both regular surface zirconium cations and Zrcus (lower coordination in comparison with the former cations). However, owing to the high activity of the latter sites for the selective conversion of propane to propene, high propene selectivity is achieved. Summing up, it can be concluded that the selectivity to propene can be optimized through improving reducibility of ZrO2 to ensure that the concentration of Zrcus sites is as high as possible. The reducibility depends on the size of crystallites as shown for monoclinic ZrO2 and may also be affected by the type of ZrO2 phase (monoclinic, tetragonal or cubic).
4. Conclusions
In the current work we have demonstrated that bare ZrO2, which is typically considered as a support but not as a catalyst for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, can be active and selective in the target reaction. The catalyst performance was established to be determined by the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen, while surface area and total acidity determined from NH3-TPD tests do not play a significant role for both activity and propene selectivity. The positive effect of ZrO2 reducibility on PDH performance is related to creation of surface zirconium sites with lower coordination. These sites show higher activity towards propene formation and lower ability for direct conversion of propane to undesired coke. Thus, the latter undesired reaction can be significantly suppressed when using easily reducible ZrO2. The reducibility can be tuned solely by preparation method as shown here without usage of any metal oxide promoters or supported metals usually used for such purposes. Among ZrO2 samples prepared by various methods, the material with the highest reducibility (up to 600 °C) was synthesized by a relatively simple method including controlled decomposition of ZrO(NO3)2 in inert atmosphere. This catalyst showed the highest activity and propene selectivity, which were close to those of yttrium doped ZrO2 used as a benchmark state-of-the art material.
