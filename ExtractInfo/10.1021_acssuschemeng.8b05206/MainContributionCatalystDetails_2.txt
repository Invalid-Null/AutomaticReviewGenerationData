The provided document does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. Though it mentions dehydrogenation reactions in general, it does not specifically discuss converting propane to propylene via dehydrogenation or oxidative dehydrogenation pathways. The focus seems to be on recycling spent chromium adsorbents as catalysts for other reactions like methyl mercaptan abatement. Since the relevance to PDH/ODH is unclear, I have indicated "No" for relevance and did not extract any catalyst details. Please let me know if I have missed any connection to PDH/ODH that should be considered.
