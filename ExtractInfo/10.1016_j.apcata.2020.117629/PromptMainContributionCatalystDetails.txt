1. Introduction
The increased supply of shale gas has triggered many interests toward the conversion of natural gas compounds into the more valuable petrochemical products. Consequently, the feedstock for steam cracking is shifting from naphtha to ethane (the second-largest component of shale gas). However, the lighter feedstock, ethane, does not lead to the production of heavier products during the steam cracking, which reduced the production of heavier petrochemical “building-blocks”, such as aromatics [1]. As a result, it becomes important to rebalancing the global petrochemicals markets with “on-purpose” technologies using light alkanes as the feedstock [2]. An efficient catalytic system for the direct ethane aromatization, therefore, could have far-reaching implications to the global BTX (benzene, toluene, and xylene) market [3,4].
While several catalytic processes for C3+ hydrocarbons aromatization, such as M2-forming [5], Cyclar™ process [6], Aroforming [7], and Z-forming [8], have been developed by the industrial community, a similar process for ethane conversion remains a formidable challenge. Different from C3+-alkanes, which can be converted to aromatics by the ZSM-5 in the H-form (through secondary carbenium formation) [5,9,10], the activation of ethane requires an additional metal function either exchanged with the proton of the zeolite or forming nanoparticles/clusters in close proximity with the zeolite [9,11,12]. Many efforts have been devoted to ethane aromatization since the 1980s and various metal species, such as Pt, Zn, Ga, Re, and Mo, modified HZSM-5 catalysts have been reported to be active [[11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]]. However, a trade-off between activity and selectivity/stability has been found for such a catalytic system, which hampered the industrial applications. According to Hu and coworker, the bimetallic Ga/Pt modified HSZM-5 catalyst shows higher activity than monometallic Ga, Pt, and Mo based catalysts, but the stability seems decreased (both conversion and selectivity attenuate, with time-on-stream, faster than the monometallic catalysts) [31,32]. More recently, the catalytic systems for ethane aromatization have also been extensively studied from a more fundamental point of view. For example, Mehdad and Lobo studied the Zn modified HZSM-5 catalyst and suggested that the balance between the number of Zn (II) Lewis acid and the remaining Brønsted acid sites is of great importance to the ethane and ethylene aromatization [33]. Our recent study also revisited the Zn-HZSM-5 catalyst, the influence of acidity on the early-stage reactivity and long term stability were discussed based on the transient kinetics analysis and deactivation kinetics [34,35]. Additionally, the effect of Al distribution in the MFI framework on the ethane aromatization over the Pt/HZSM-5 catalyst has been investigated by Cheng et al. [36] and the kinetics/mechanism of the ethane aromatization on the Re/HZSM-5 was discussed by Ma and Zou [37]. It might be expected, from the literature, that the metal functions have significant effects on the initial ethane dehydrogenation activity, product selectivity, and stability.
Among different catalysts, Ga modified HZSM-5 exhibits a higher selectivity to BTX and a slower rate of deactivation than the other metals, such as Zn and Pt, modified HZSM-5 catalysts. The Ga/HZSM-5 catalyst has been employed in the UOP/BP’s Cyclar™ process for propane/butane aromatization, which produces up to 60 wt% of aromatics yield (a commercial unit of 45,000 BPD was operated in the Middle East from 1999–2013) [6]. However, the activity of the Cyclar catalyst in the ethane aromatization is low [12,38]. On the other hand, Ni modified HZSM-5 catalyst has not been reported for the ethane aromatization, most probably due to its high rate of coking (Ni-based catalysts has been used for the synthesis of carbon nanotubes from ethane [39]). Nonetheless, Ni-exchanged HZSM-5 has been investigated for the aromatization of C3+ alkanes [[40], [41], [42], [43]]. Comparable selectivity to the Ga-ZSM-5 and Zn-ZSM-5 has been found during the pentane aromatization [42]. However, a higher methane selectivity [44] and a faster rate of deactivation [43] were observed during the propane and n-butane aromatization.
While single Ni metal modified ZSM-5 catalyst has been considered as “ineffective” in the ethane aromatization, here we will demonstrate a significant bi-metal synergistic effect in the Ni and Ga co-functionalized HZSM-5 for this reaction. The bi-metal Ni/Ga (with 1/1 atomic ratio) modified HZSM-5 shows improved activity or selectivity and stability than the single metal modified HZSM-5 catalysts. Specifically, we are focusing on the influence of metal species chemical composition on the early-stage catalytic activity/selectivity and stability during the ethane aromatization. Therefore, a series of Ni and/or Ga modified HZSM-5 catalysts were prepared through impregnation and the physicochemical properties of the prepared catalysts were extensively characterized by hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectrometers (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM-EDS), and ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). Consequently, the relationships between the chemical properties of the metal species and their reactivity will be discussed based on the early-stage transient results. The deactivation kinetics will be evaluated based on the modified power-law equation model for different catalysts; and the effect of chemical composition on the kinetic parameters will be also discussed.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The NH4-ZSM-5 zeolite (specific area 400 m2/g, SiO2/Al2O3 = 30) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. The zeolite was pretreated under vacuum (100 mbar) at 120 °C for 12 h to remove the moisture. Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and Ga(NO3)3·xH2O (trace metals) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and were used as obtained. The Ni and Ga modified HZSM-5 catalysts were prepared through incipient wetness co-impregnation. The Ni loadings were fixed at 2 wt% (metal base) and the Ni/Ga atomic ratio was varied. The bi-metal catalysts were noted as Ni1Gax/HZSM-5, in which x represents the relative atomic ratio between Ga to Ni. The monometallic Ni and Ga modified HZSM-5 catalysts were also prepared through incipient wetness impregnation both at 2 wt% metal loading. Experimentally, 2 g of the dried NH4-ZSM-5 zeolite was impregnated with a 2 ml aqueous solution of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and/or Ga(NO3)3·xH2O precursor at room temperature. The samples were kept under ambient conditions 24 h for aging. Finally, the samples were dried at 70 °C under vacuum overnight and calcined in air at 600 °C for 6 h. The powder sample was formed through tablet press, then crushed and sieved to obtain a size fraction between 125 and 250 μm for characterization and catalytic performance investigations.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) experiment was performed on the Micrometrics AutoChem 2910 equipped with an external on-line mass spectrometer. Prior to each experiment, the sample (0.1 g) was first activated in 10 % H2/Ar at 650 °C for 30 min. The pre-adsorption of NH3 was then performed at 120 °C under the flow of pure NH3 for 30 min. After that, the physically adsorbed NH3 was swept by Ar flow (20 ml/min) at the same temperature for 2 h. Finally, the temperature of the sample was increased from 120 to 650 °C at a ramp of 10 °C/min under the flow of Ar at 20 ml/min. Desorption of NH3 (m/z = 17) and the signal of Ar (m/z = 40) and H2O (m/z = 18) were measured online by the Ametek mass spectrometer (Dymaxion Benchtop).
Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was performed on the same Micrometrics AutoChem 2910 equipped with Agilent 5973 mass spectrometry to monitor the formation of H2O (m/z = 18) during the TPR. Hydrogen consumption during the TPR monitored by the Ametek mass spectrometer was negligible due to the low metal loading. Specifically, 0.2 g sample was first pretreated under Ar (30 mL/min) at 600 °C for 30 min to remove the moistures adsorbed on the catalyst. The temperature of the sample was then decreased to 200 °C before switching the reactor influence to 10 % H2/Ar. The sample was kept at 200 °C until the signal of H2O and H2 reaches the baseline. Afterward, the temperature was increased to 800 °C at 10 °C /min. The signal of H2O and H2 was recorded by the two mass spectrometers aforementioned.
The XRD patterns of the activated catalysts (after reduction, at 650 °C for 30 min, and passivation) were measured by the Rigaku Ultima III X-ray Diffraction System with Cu Kα radiation (154.06 pm, 40 kV, and 44 mA). Diffraction spectra were collected at the scanning rate of 4° min−1 in the range of 2θ from 4°–70°.
The surface chemistry of the activated catalysts was measured using a Thermo Scientific K-alpha X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) equipped with a monochromatic aluminum X-ray source at 1486.6 eV. A spot size of 400 μm2 was used for each measurement. The survey spectra were collected in the binding energy range of 0–1350 eV with a pass energy of 200 eV at a step size of 1 eV. To correlate the high resolution (HR) core level spectra of Ga 2p and Ni 2p, a 40 eV pass energy under an ultrahigh vacuum condition with an energy step size of 0.1 eV was applied. The C1s binding energy at 284.5 eV of adventitious carbon was taken as an energy reference to compensate for surface charging effects.
The X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments of the activated catalysts, involving X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), were conducted at the beamline 20-BM in Advanced Photon Source (APS). Data were acquired in fluorescence mode using a 13-element germanium detector; the sample was set at a 90 degree angle to the incoming beam and detector. Powder samples were pressed to a disk and sealed in Kapton® tape before being attached to the sample stage. Spectra were recorded at the K-edge of Ni and Ga. The XAS data were normalized and analyzed by Athena software.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and STEM-EDX chemical mapping of the activated catalysts were obtained using a JEOL 2100TEM (accelerating voltage 200 kV) equipped with a Gatan camera.
2.3. Catalytic performance evaluation
The catalytic performance of the prepared catalysts in ethane aromatization was tested in a home-built setup for step-change transient kinetic analysis. Typically, 0.2 g of the catalysts were loaded into a stainless steel reactor (ID, Φ = ¼ inches) and activated in 10 % H2/Ar (20 ml/min) at 650 °C (ramp 10 °C/min) for 30 min. After activation, the temperature of the reactor was decreased to 550 °C and the reactor influent was switched to pure Ar (20 ml/min). Prior to each experiment, Ar and the by-pass feed spectra were both recorded for mass spectrometer calibration and used as a reference for the calculation of conversion. Finally, the reaction was initiated by fast switching (by a 4-way valve) of the reactor influent gas from Ar (20 ml/min) to C2H6 (20 ml/min, which gives a GHSV (gas hourly space velocity) of 4000 h−1). The effluent gases were analyzed continuously by an on-line Agilent 5973 mass spectrometry. Information about the catalytic behavior during the early-stage induction period and the “steady-state” deactivation can be obtained simultaneously. A more detailed method for product quantification with the mass spectrometer has been shown in our previous paper [35]. It must be noted that the blank test of the stainless steel reactor shows negligible activity in ethane conversion at 550 °C. We used the stainless steel (instead of quartz) reactor because the Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst shows significant high activity towards coking, which will crack the quartz reactor.
2.4. Catalyst deactivation kinetics evaluation
The general reaction rate with catalyst deactivation can be expressed as
(1)
Where rt0 (T, C) is the rate after reaching the steady-state, T is reaction temperature, C is reactants concentration, and a (t) represents the reactivity coefficient (a (t) ≤ 1).
The rate of deactivation or the kinetic expression of the reactivity coefficient a (t) will be evaluated based on the generalized power-law equation model (GPLE) [45,46].
(2)
Where k is the rate constant of deactivation (as a function of T); f (C) is the power law expression of the deactivation rate (as a function of the concentration of the reactants and products); β is the order of deactivation (should be an integer), and a∞ is the asymptotic reactivity coefficient as the time approaches infinity (a∞ should approach to 0 for the present catalytic system). Assuming the concentration term f (C) is independent of the deactivation rate, namely f (C) is constant, integration of Eq. (2) for the first order (β = 1) deactivation kinetics can be written as
(3)
For second order (β = 2) deactivation kinetics, it can be integrated to
(4)
For the present catalytic system, we proposed to modify the GPLE models by adding power to the time (t in Eqs. (3) and (4) becomes tα). We expect α ≤ 1 and can be understood as the change of the amount of coke deposition on the surface of the catalyst “CC = Atn” where CC is the concentration of carbon on the surface of the catalyst (g/m2). The modified first and second order deactivation kinetic models are shown in Eqs. (5) and (6)
(5)
(6)
It is seen that the second order modified GPLE model is exactly the same (in mathematic) as the model we proposed in our previous paper for ethane aromatization over the Zn exchanged HZSM-5 catalysts [35]. The activity coefficient was expressed as a function of the concentration of carbon on the catalyst CC (a = 1/(1+ k0CCβ)).
The kinetic parameters k and α will be determined and the effect of chemical compositions of the metal species on the parameters k and α will be discussed.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalysts characterization
The prepared Ni and/or Ga modified HZSM-5 catalysts were characterized by means of XRD, H2-TPR, XPS, XAS, TEM/STEM-EDX, and NH3-TPD. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the XRD patterns of the monometallic Ni and Ga modified HZSM-5 show almost identical diffraction patterns to the HZSM-5 zeolite host. The diffraction of Ni and Ga species was absent, indicating very high dispersion of the Ni and Ga related species in the HZSM-5 zeolite. The metal species on the zeolites normally underwent significant ion-exchange during impregnation and the high-temperature activation process to form exchanged Ni2+ or Ga+, [GaO]+, and [GaOH]+, cations (see also XPS characterization) [47,48]. Quite interestingly, a new peak at 2 θ of 43.5° (see Fig. 1(b)), which can be assigned to the diffraction of 111 facet of the Ni3Ga intermetallic alloy [49,50], was identified for the bimetallic Ni/Ga modified HZSM-5 catalysts. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the formation of such Ni-rich intermetallic alloy with a stoichiometric Ni/Ga ratio of 3/1 was favored under Ga-rich conditions (Ni1Ga1 and Ni1Ga3 samples).

The H2-TPR profiles (see Fig. 1(c)) clearly show two distinguished peaks at temperatures range of 250−450 °C and 550−750 °C, corresponding to the reduction of the oxidic Ni and Ga particles, respectively [31,51,52]. While the peak for the reduction of Ni species in the monometallic sample was found at 367 °C, the profile was not back to the baseline until 600 °C, indicating the presence of the exchanged Ni2+ Lewis acid sites [51,53]. In contrast to the monometallic Ga/HZSM-5 sample, the broadness of the profiles for the bimetallic samples was decreased, indicating the presence of metallic Ni species promoted the reduction of the Ga species through hydrogen spillover. More interestingly, the intensity of the Ga peak for the Ni1Ga1/HZSM-5 is the highest among the samples (even higher than the samples with higher Ga loading), suggested that the reduction of Ga species was favored at Ni-rich condition.
The Ni and Ga 2p3/2 XPS spectra of the samples are displayed in Fig. 1(d and e), and the normalized relative concentration of Ni0/Ni2+ and Ga0/GaO+/Ga+ from the spectra are shown in Table S1. As shown in Fig. 1d, the Ga 2p3/2 spectra could be deconvoluted into three peaks at 1116.7, 1118.2, and 1119.2 eV, respectively. The low binding energy peak at 1116.7 eV is associated with metallic gallium (Ga0), which, however, was almost absent for the Ga/HZSM-5 and Ni1Ga1/3/HZSM-5 samples. As shown in Table S1, the normalized concentrations of Ga0 were ∼ 5% for the Ga/HZSM-5 and Ni1Ga1/3/HZSM-5, which might be originated from the error of deconvolution. Nevertheless, the concentration of Ga0 was 19.5 and 7.8 %, respectively, for the Ni1Ga1/HZSM-5 and Ni1Ga3/HZSM-5, indicating the presence of Ni0 promoted the reduction of Ga species (consistent with the TPR results) through hydrogen spillover and yielded the formation of intermetallic alloys (see XRD). The higher-binding energy peaks at 1118.2 and 1119.2 eV are attributed to the GaO+ and Ga+ cations, respectively, bound to the zeolite (see Eqs. (1), (2), (3), (4) for the most plausible reactions) [47,52,[54], [55], [56]]. More detailed normalized concentrations of these species are shown in Table S1.

Different from the Ga 2p3/2 spectra, the intensity of the Ni 2p3/2 spectra of various samples is significantly lower. As shown in Fig. 1(e), the spectra show two main peaks at 852.2 and 856.5 eV for the metallic Ni0 and Ni2+, respectively [53,57,58]. It is speculated that most of the Ni species were anchored inside the zeolite channels, and part of which has been exchanged with the Brønsted acid sites, forming Ni2+ cation as the Lewis acid site. Additionally, the surface concentrations of the nickel species are varied dependent upon the ratio of Ni/Ga, although the samples are containing the same 2 wt% nominal Ni loadings. In particular, the Ni1Ga1/HZSM-5 sample shows the highest Ni0 concentration, which once again can be explained by the formation of Ni3Ga intermetallic alloy particles outside the zeolite channel, consistent with the XRD patterns and Ga 2p spectra. While the XRD patterns show the formation of Ni3Ga intermetallic alloy, the ratio of Ni0/Ga0 on the surface is different from the 3/1 stoichiometric, which indicates the presence of unalloyed metallic species or the formation of different Ni/Ga stoichiometric alloys on the surface of the particles. However, these species can not be directly identified from the XRD patterns.
The Ni1Gax/HZSM-5 samples were further characterized by the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). XANES spectra of the K-edge of Ni and Ga are shown in Fig. 2a and c. The Ni K-edge spectra of the Ni1Gax/HZSM-5 samples, as well as the Ni modified HZSM-5 samples prepared through impregnation (IM) and ion-exchange (IE) were compared with the Ni foil and Ni(OH)2 standards. As shown in Fig. 2a, while the Ni IE shows a similar adsorption edge to the Ni(OH)2, the edges of the Ni IM and Ni1Gax samples are between the Ni foil and Ni(OH)2 standards. Additionally, the adsorption edges of the Ni1Gax samples shifted to the left in contrast to the Ni IM, indicating the presence of Ga affects the chemical state of the Ni species. The Fourier transform EXAFS spectra of the Ni K-edge (Fig. 2b) show that the radial distance of Ni-Ni is slightly larger than that for the Ni foil standard, which suggested the formation of Ni3Ga intermetallic alloy rather than monometallic Ni particles [58]. Further information about the coordination number and the bond length can not be identified from the EXAFS, because it is difficult to fit/model the data reliably due to the presence of Ni species with different chemical states. The Ga K-edge spectrum of the sample shifted to lower energy than the Ga foil shows a quite different pre-edge peak, which suggested the formation of positively charged Gaδ+ species. Additionally, the pre-edge peak shown in the spectrum is also quite different from the β-Ga2O3, indicating such Ga species (exchanged with the proton of the zeolite) are coordinated in both tetrahedral and octahedral with O atoms [59]. Fourier-transformed EXAFS spectrum of the Ga K-edge (Fig. 2d) shows dominant features at 1.4 and 2.1 Å in R-space, corresponding to backscattering from O atoms coordinated to Ga3+ centers [59].

The chemical properties of the metal species were further characterized by TEM and STEM-EDS. As shown in Fig. 3 for the Ni1Ga1/HZSM-5 sample, a considerable number of nanosized particles (range from 5 to 40 nm) are observed from the TEM image. These particles should be located outside the zeolite channels since their size is much larger (<10 times) than the pore size of the MFI zeolites. Smaller particles or nanoclusters anchored inside the zeolite channels cannot be identified from the TEM and HRTEM images since it quickly eclipses due to the fast etching of the zeolite framework under high-energy electrons. Nevertheless, from the STEM-EDS chemical mappings, besides the aggregated particles identified from the TEM image, a relatively homogeneous distribution of the Ni and Ga species on the ZSM-5 host was observed at the regions where the large particles were not identified. Therefore, the metal species must migrate into the channels of the zeolite and form either nanoclusters or exchanged with the H+ of the zeolites forming metal cations (δ+) as the Lewis acid sites. Additionally, the Ni and Ga show almost identical distribution over the entire zeolite host, which suggested that Ni and Ga species have close intimacy, and part of which should form intermetallic alloys as identified by the XRD. Quantitative analysis of the EDS spectrum suggested that the Ni and Ga loadings are both around 1.8 wt% (see Fig. S1), similar to the nominal Ni/Ga ratio and loadings. The TEM images and STEM-EDS chemical mappings for the other samples are shown in Figs. S2–S5. It seems that the distribution of metal species for the other samples show less homogeneity than the Ni1Ga1/HZSM-5 sample.

The effect of metal species modification on the acidity of the HZSM-5 zeolite was characterized by the NH3-TPD. As shown in Fig. 1(f), NH3 desorption profiles exhibit mainly two peaks at 150–350 and 360–550 °C, corresponding to the weak and strong acidic sites, respectively. In comparison with the HZSM-5 host, the presence of metal species decreased the density of total acid sites (see Table S2), especially the strong Brønsted acids. The metal species could exchange with part of the H+ of the zeolite to form Ni2+, GaO+, and Ga+ metal cations (see discussion of XPS results), which decreased the Brønsted acid density and increased the Lewis acid density. Such a conclusion was proved by the deviations of the NH3 profiles (for the metal modified HZSM-5) from the HZSM-5 host (see Fig. S6), which shows positive deviation at low temperatures and negative deviation at high temperatures. It is also seen that Ga has the least effect on the strong acid site of the zeolite. The desorption of NH3 deviates only around −5 μmol/g/min at the temperature around 500 °C. The Ni/HZSM-5 and NiGa/HZSM-5 (with Ni/Ga ratio 3/1 and 1/3) show significantly higher such deviations, indicating the ion-exchange of the Ni species with the H+ of the zeolite is easier than the Ga species (the same conclusion can be obtained based on the XPS results). What is the most interesting is the Ni1Ga1/HZSM-5 sample, while it contains the same Ni loading as the other samples, a significantly lower deviation was observed. Therefore, it might be expected that the Ni1Ga1/HZSM-5 catalyst might be a good candidate for ethane aromatization since it shows a balanced metal function (Ni3Ga intermetallic alloy) and acidity.
3.2. Catalytic performance
The catalytic performance of the Ni and/or Ga modified HZSM-5 catalysts will be discussed based on the early-stage behavior and the steady-state activity/selectivity, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4a–e, the chemical compositions of the metal species have a significant influence on the early-stage (induction period) reactivity based on the step-change transient experiments. While methane shows in the gas phase and reaches the maximum rate of production immediately (after switching the reactor influent from Ar to ethane), all of the other products show delay with various extent dependent highly upon the compositions of the metal species. For the Ga/HZSM-5 catalyst (Fig. 4a), ethylene was produced right after methane, whereas the formation of benzene and toluene was delayed for 30 and 50 s, respectively. For the Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst (Fig. 4b), such delay was significant. The formation of ethylene and benzene was observed after 10 min, and further delay was found for toluene and xylene. The presence of methane as the only gas-phase product during the early-stage suggested that the fresh Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst is highly selective for ethane cracking (C2H6 → CH4 + C + H2). Additionally, ethane is absent from the gas phase for the initial ∼4 min, indicating significantly higher initial activity (100 % conversion) for the cracking. Fast decrease of methane or increase of ethane after 5 min further suggested that the catalytically active sites are being reconstructed during the early-stage. For the Ni1Ga1/3/HZSM-5 catalyst (Fig. 4d), the delay times for benzene and toluene are 20 and 30 min, respectively, which are longer than that for the Ni/HZSM-5. However, ethylene was produced almost without delay, and it was not run into the steady-state even after 2 h. Additionally, the initial rate of methane over the Ni1Ga1/3/HZSM-5 is only one-tenth of that over the Ni/HZSM-5. Therefore, the catalytically active sites for ethane cracking/coking, as well as the rate of the catalyst surface reconstruction, are different between these two catalysts. Quite interestingly, the Ni1Ga1/HZSM-5 (Fig. 4c) catalyst shows significantly reduced delay time, which is only slightly longer than that for the Ga/HZSM-5. Benzene and ethylene appear in the gas phase right after methane with a shoulder peak at 30 s, which might be due to the presence of different kinds of catalytically active sites. The Ni1Ga3/HZSM-5 (Fig. 4e) shows a slightly longer delay time but very similar early-stage behavior to the Ni1Ga1/HZSM-5 catalyst. These two catalysts both show the formation of Ni3Ga alloy based on the XRD, indicating a similar type of active site was formed.

(f) Rate of total BTX formation over different catalysts. At t = 0, the reactor influent gas was switched abruptly from Ar to C2H6. Reactions were performed at T =550 °C, P = 1 atm, and GHSV =4000 h−1.
The time-dependent rate for the formation of total BTX is compiled in Fig. 4f. After the early-stage induction period, the Ni/HZSM-5 shows the highest rate for total BTX formation; however, it attenuates with time-on-stream (TOS) significantly faster than the other samples (the effect of metal function on the deactivation kinetics will be discussed later). It is seen that the Ni1Ga1/HZSM-5 shows a higher rate of BTX than the Ga/HZSM-5 and is more stable than the Ni/HZSM-5. The Ni1Ga1/3 and Ni1Ga3 modified HZSM-5 catalysts, however, show lower rates of BTX than the Ga/HZSM-5. The catalytic performance in terms of ethane conversion and product selectivity is shown in Fig. 5 (the rates of different products can be found from Fig. S7). To re-emphasize, Ni and Ni1Ga1/3 modified HZSM-5 catalysts show a significantly high activity of ethane cracking during the early-stage. Up to 100 % of ethane was converted into methane and coke over the Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst. While Ni/HZSM-5 holds the highest ethane conversion, selectivity to BTX is the lowest among the samples (see Fig. S8). Quite interestingly, the Ni1Ga1/HZSM-5 shows almost identical selectivity to that of Ga/HZSM-5. Additionally, all of the bimetal NiGa modified HZSM-5 catalysts show higher BTX selectivity than the Ni/HZSM-5, which suggested the synergistic effect between the Ni and Ga species.

The early-stage and “steady-state” catalytic behavior suggested that the metal function significantly affects the reactivity of the catalyst in ethane aromatization. We expect that the Ni° nanoparticles are extremely active in ethane cracking, leading to the formation of methane and coke. The presence of Ni° might be the reason for the long induction period over the Ni/HZSM-5 and Ni1Ga1/3/HZSM-5 catalysts because such delay was not observed over the Ni-exchanged HZSM-5 catalyst (see Fig. S7). Within the Ni1Ga1/3/HZSM-5 catalyst, the presence of small amount of Ga does not lead to the formation of alloys (see XRD); therefore, Ni° represents the majority of Ni species in the catalyst. However, the presence of Ga (in close proximity with Ni, see Fig. S3) reduced the activity of surface reconstruction, as a result leading to a longer delay time than the Ni/HZSM-5. Additionally, the exchanged Ni2+ Lewis acid site in the Ni/HZSM-5 sample should also be active for ethane dehydrogenation and aromatization; however, such kind of active sites produces large amounts of CH4 and deactivate significantly faster than the Ga/HZSM-5 and Ni1Ga1/HZSM-5 catalysts (see Fig. S7 for the catalytic performance of Ni exchanged HZSM-5 catalyst). For the bimetal Ni and Ga co-functionalized HZSM-5 catalysts (with Ga/Ni ≥ 1), the Ni nanoparticle most probably was absent due to the formation of new catalytically active sites, namely Ni3Ga intermetallic alloy. Consequently, the long induction period was not observed. Recently, the Ni3Ga intermetallic alloy was also identified as the catalytically active site for ethane and propane dehydrogenation by Laursen and coworker [59,60]. It might be important to mention that the long induction period was also found by Laursen et al. during both ethane and propane dehydrogenation over the Ni1Ga1/3/Al2O3 catalyst. The same as we have observed, during the early-stage, up to 100 % selectivity to methane was observed during propane dehydrogenation [59]. That’s probably the reason for treating the catalyst, before catalytic testing, under 10 % propane at 600 °C for 6 h (the long induction period will be removed) [60]. Although the same bulk Ni3Ga alloy was formed at different Ni/Ga actual loading, the “off-stoichiometric” 1/1 ratio of Ni and Ga was found to be optimal for ethane and propane dehydrogenation. Laursen et al. suggested that the Ga rich surface (forming core-shell type structure) is important for the dehydrogenation. Within the present catalytic system, the Ga rich surface was also identified by the XPS. Since the HZSM-5 zeolite was used as the support for the Ni and Ga species, additional Ni and Ga species not incroporating into the intermetallic alloys could exchange with the proton of the zeolite, forming metal cations (Ni2+ and GaO+ etc.) as the Lewis acid sites for the aromatization of both ethane and ethylene. We anticipate that the present Ni/Ga/HZSM-5 catalytic system for ethane aromatization might involve a tandem mechanism. Specifically, part of ethane was first dehydrogenated to ethylene on the Ni3Ga particles. Then the mixture of ethane and ethylene was transformed into BTX over the exchanged Ni2+ and GaO+ cations. The presence of ethylene could promote ethane aromatization over the galloaluminosilicate [11]. Therefore, the bimetallic Ni1Ga1/HZSM-5 catalyst shows higher activity (at similar BTX selectivity) than the monometallic Ga/HZSM-5 catalyst.
3.3. Stability/deactivation kinetics
Deactivation of the zeolites based catalysts is a common problem during the hydrocarbon processing at high-temperature. As already mentioned, the rate of BTX formation attenuates with TOS. Both ethane conversion and BTX selectivity decrease due to coking (the selectivity of ethylene was increased). Fig. 6(a–c) shows the reactivity-time data of methane, benzene, and toluene over the Ni/HZSM-5, Ga/HZSM-5, and Ni1Ga1/HZSM-5 catalysts, respectively. It is clearly seen that the reactivity of all three products over the Ni1Ga1/HZSM-5 decreased slower than the Ni/HZSM-5 but faster than the Ga/HZSM-5. While the reactivity of methane over the Ni1Ga1/HZSM-5 is closer to the Ni/HZSM-5 than the Ga/HZSM-5, the reactivity of toluene over the same catalyst is similar to the Ga/HZSM-5 rather than the Ni/HZSM-5. We also noticed that the degree of reactivity attenuation varied for different products. It seems the reactivity of methane attenuates (with TOS) significantly faster than the benzene and toluene over the same catalyst, which suggested that different catalytic active sites and mechanisms might be involved. Different from methane and aromatics, the reactivity coefficient for ethylene (results not shown) increased with TOS during the investigated time period, which also indicated that ethylene is the intermediate product in such tandem catalytic system.

In order to better understand the influence of metal function on the stability, the kinetics of deactivation were evaluated for the rate of methane, benzene, and toluene formation over the Ni, Ga, and Ni1Ga1 modified HZSM-5 catalysts, respectively. Xylene (due to its low selectivity) and ethylene (rate increased with TOS during the investigated time period) were not evaluated for the deactivation kinetics. We start with the generalized power-law equation (GPLE) model demonstrated in the experimental part. However, significant deviations were found for both first (see Fig. S9) and second order (see Fig. S10) deactivation for methane and benzene (deviation of toluene seems to be less significant). Therefore, the first and second order GPLE kinetic models were modified by adding a power α to the time t. As already mentioned in the experimental part, the parameter α ≤ 1, which indicates that the concentration of carbon on the surface of the catalyst was not increased linearly with TOS since the rate of coking was decreased. In order to identify the parameters α and k, the linear form of the modified first and second order deactivation models are shown in Eqs. (7) and (8).

Fig. 6(d–f) shows the linear relation for the methane, benzene, and toluene, respectively, based on the first order modified deactivation kinetics (Eq. (7)), and such linear relation for the second order modified deactivation kinetics (Eq. (8)) are shown in Fig. 6(g–i). It is clearly seen that both 1st and 2nd order modified GPLE model fit well with the experimental data. It is clearly seen from the linearized relation that metal function has a significant effect on the intercept (lnk) rather than the slop (α). The deactivation kinetic parameters for both 1st and 2nd order modified GPLE model are shown in Table 1. The 1st order model shows higher k and lower α than the 2nd order deactivation model for all investigated products and catalysts. In terms of the t1/2 (time for a(t) = 0.5), the 2nd order model is longer than the 1st order for benzene and toluene over the Ga/HZSM-5 and Ni1Ga1/HZSM-5 catalysts, but they are similar over the Ni/HZSM-5 and for methane. Based on the kinetic parameters, the recalculated reactivity coefficients for both 1st and 2nd order models are shown in Fig. S11. It seems the 1st order model shows a higher deviation during the initial 20 min TOS. Therefore, the 2nd order modified GPLE deactivation model is likely a better fit for data extrapolation.

The kinetic parameters were also different for each product among methane, benzene, and toluene, indicating different catalytically active sites or mechanisms were involved. For the rate constant of deactivation k, methane > benzene > toluene, but α shows just the opposite relation. Additionally, we noticed that the effect of catalyst seems to have more influence on k than α. Among the Ni, Ga, and Ni1Ga1 modified HZSM-5 catalysts, k decreases significantly following the order: Ni > Ni1Ga1 > Ga. Therefore, we anticipate that the rate constant of deactivation k is highly dependent upon the metal function. On the other hand, since the same HZSM-5 zeolite was used for these three catalysts, the parameter α seems to depend more on the acidity of the zeolites than the metal function. The difference in α among the three catalysts should be originated from the influence of the metal species on the acidity of HZSM-5. Considering the catalyst's characterization results and the tandem dehydrogenation/aromatization mechanism we have suggested, the presence of the exchanged Ni2+ cation should be responsible for the higher k over the Ni containing catalysts.
4. Conclusion
We have demonstrated that Ni/Ga co-functionalized HZSM-5 catalysts show enhanced selectivity + stability and activity than the monometallic counterparts, i.e., Ni/HZSM-5 and Ga/HZSM-5, respectively, during ethane aromatization. Specifically, with Ni/Ga atomic ratio of 1/1, the selectivity to total BTX is up to 80 % (identical to that over the Ga/HZSM-5), which is higher than Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst, as well as the other catalysts reported in the literature. In terms of the activity, the rate of total BTX formation over the Ni1Ga1/HZSM-5 (∼60 μmol/g/min) is higher than that over the Ga/HZSM-5 (∼40 μmol/g/min). Although the Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst shows the highest initial rate of BTX (up to 120 μmol/g/min), such a catalyst deactivates significantly with TOS due to coking. Based on the modified GPLE deactivation kinetic models, the rate constant of deactivation k over the Ni/HZSM-5 is larger than that over Ga and Ni1Ga1 modified HZSM-5 catalysts. It seems the metal functions significantly affect the rate constant of deactivation k rather than the power correlation α to time t. Additionally, the metal compositions of the catalysts also show a significant effect on early-stage catalytic behavior. While the Ga and Ni1Ga1/HZSM-5 catalysts show an induction period of a few minutes, over the Ni/HZSM-5 and Ni1Ga1/3/HZSM-5 catalyst, it increased to >10 min and >30 min, respectively. Such an induction period is highly undesired since only methane and coke were produced with up to 100 % ethane conversion over the Ni/HZSM-5 catalyst.
Detailed characterization of the catalysts suggested that various Ni and Ga related species are presenting in the same catalyst. Specifically, the formation of Ni3Ga intermetallic alloy particles was identified by both XRD (also evidenced by the XPS, XAS, and STEM-EDS mapping). We suggested that a tandem dehydrogenation (over the Ni3Ga intermetallic alloy) and aromatization (over the Ga+ or [GaO]+ exchanged HZSM-5) mechanism was involved in the ethane aromatization. The presence of other Ni species, especially the nanosized Ni particles, which is likely responsible for the long induction period, high rate of coking (fast deactivation), and high selectivity to methane, is not desired.
