The provided documents do not appear to contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The documents focus on the hydrodeoxygenation of cyclohexanone over Ni/HZSM-5 catalysts with different binders and do not mention propane, propylene, PDH or ODH. Since there are no extracts related to PDH or ODH research, I have indicated "No" relevance and left the rest of the XML structure empty.
