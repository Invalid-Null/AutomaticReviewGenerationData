The provided document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It discusses the catalytic oxidation activity of CexZr1-xO2 catalysts for soot combustion, and does not mention propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The document focuses on comparing different preparation methods and composition ratios for CexZr1-xO2 catalysts in catalyzing the oxidation of soot/carbon particles from diesel exhaust. It does not discuss converting propane to propylene via dehydrogenation reactions. Therefore, this document does not seem directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation processes.
