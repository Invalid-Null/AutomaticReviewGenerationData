AbstractAbstract
The PtSn/Al2O3 is a prototypical industrial catalyst for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). However, the local structures of the active sites are still inconclusive under the operation conditions. Herein, the evolutions of the Pt-Sn active centers supported on nano-Al2O3 are definitely discerned at the atomic level during PDH reaction. By combining complementary in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, we demonstrate that a highly productive Sn1Pt single-atom alloy (47.6 molC3H6 gPt–1 h–1) forms after the reduction, and thereby self-assembles to the Pt3Sn intermetallic compound during the reaction, which exhibits a rather stable performance (kd-10~40h: 0.0026 h–1). Intriguingly, the results of in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy further corroborate that the adjacent Pt atoms with terrace sites aggravating the coke deposition can be circumvented through this single-atom alloy mediated reconstruction. Our findings depict an unprecedented evolution process of the active sites of the PtSn/Al2O3, and afford an effectual nanostructure engineering pathway for stable PDH catalysts.

1. Introduction
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a kind of on-purpose propylene production strategy has attracted a great interest [1, 2]. The PtSn/Al2O3 is one of the most important catalysts for PDH reaction, which was industrialized firstly by Honeywell UOP in the 1990s [3]. Yet, the typical characteristic of this catalyst is that the activity decays with time on stream, for which the repeated regeneration is needed to gain continuous operation [4]. To improve the stability, tremendous efforts have been made to reveal the relationship between the PtSn structures and their catalytic performances. However, till now, the exact structures of the active sites for the PtSn/Al2O3 are still elusive.
Hitherto, different models, such as Pt-SnOx [5, 6, 7, 8], PtSn alloy [9, 10] and intermetallic compounds including Pt3Sn [11], Pt1Sn1 [12], PtSn3 [13] have been proposed as the active sites of the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. Owing to the intrinsic activity and mutable trait of both Pt and Sn [14], however, the PtSn structures are sensitive to many factors (e.g., supports, synthesis methods, atmospheres, temperatures, etc.), and thus, often experience the unpredictable reconstruction [15, 16]. More than three decades ago, Lin’s group reported that the sandwich-like Pt-SnOx/Al2O3 structure would transform to PtSn alloy after regeneration for the PDH process [5]. In 2010, Bert’s group [17] further demonstrated that, with increasing cycles of regeneration, the enrichment of Sn in the core of the PtSn bimetallic nanoparticles, together with the sintering effect caused the deactivation of the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst. Recently, Gong’s group [11] reported that, albeit the surface Sn was repeatedly leached out, the Sn from the core of the Pt3Sn nanoparticles could also segregate to the surface. Analogously, most of the studies focus on the changes of the active sites on PtSn/Al2O3 after several treatment cycles, although the ubiquitous activity drop occurs immediately at the beginning. To date, the research concentrated on the initial evolution of the PtSn structures is still missing, which could be a crucial step to recognize the unclear factors affecting the catalytic activity and/or stability, and strengthen the understanding of the typical activity loss. Therefore, it is imperative to depict a clear overall picture of the active structures of the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst within the different stages of PDH reaction.
Although PDH reaction is a structure-insensitive process [18], minimizing the particle size could greatly improve the utilization of the precious metal Pt and be beneficial to reducing the occurrence of side reactions and sintering [19]. Recently, there were a large amount of works reported to control over the size of PtSn bimetallic nanoparticles by confining them in the framework of the zeolites (e.g., MFI [20, 21], ZSM-5 [22, 23], etc.), protecting the particles with organic ligands (PtSn/MgAl2O4) [24], tuning the morphology of the supports (e.g., Al2O3-nanosheet [25], nanodiamond@graphene support [7], etc.), and fixing Sn in the support (e.g., Pt/MgSnAl-LDHs [26], Pt/Sn-Beta [27], etc.). The above strategies were all succeed in governing the particle size of the PtSn nanoparticles during PDH process. However, it is more significant to prevent the sintering of the PtSn particles over the commercial Al2O3 support, which is conducive to concentrate on the evolution of the specific PtSn itself within the industrialized PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst during PDH reaction.
Inspired by the positive effects of the enlarged distance between the particles [28] and the nanoparticulated support [29] on reducing the sintering, in this contribution, the loading of Pt was reduced to 0.1 wt% and the commercial nano-Al2O3 was chosen as the support, on which the Sn could be dispersed as single atoms, serving as nucleation sites [30] for inhibiting the sintering of Pt nanoparticles. The resulting PtSn/nano-Al2O3 catalyst with a narrow PtSn size distribution at ~1 nm, achieved an excellent productivity as high as 47.6 molC3H6 gPt–1 h–1 and exhibited an extremely stable behavior after a quick structural reconstruction. In contrast, the productivity of PtSn/nano-Al2O3 catalyst with a higher Pt loading was merely 11.1 molC3H6 gPt–1 h–1. By virtue of the characterization results of the aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning-transmission electron microscopy (AC-HAADF-STEM), in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier-transform spectroscopy by using CO as the probe molecule (CO-DRIFTS), and theoretical calculations based on stochastic surface walking (SSW) method combined with the density functional theory (DFT), a clear profile of the atomic configuration evolution of the active sites of the PtSn/nano-Al2O3 catalyst during PDH reaction is delineated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The mass ratio of Pt/Sn was elaborately modulated to 1:10, therefore, the target PtSn/nano-Al2O3 catalyst with 0.1 wt% Pt and 1.0 wt% Sn was fixed (nominated as 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3). To approach to the industrial catalysts, the PtSn/nano-Al2O3 analogue with 0.5 wt% Pt and 1.0 wt% Sn was used as a reference (named as 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3). Similarly, the Pt/nano-Al2O3 catalyst with 0.1 wt% and 0.5 wt% Pt were simplified as 0.1Pt/nano-Al2O3 and 0.5Pt/nano-Al2O3, respectively. The actual loadings were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), which were in line with the nominal values (Table S1). The PtSn/nano-Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by an industrially favorable co-impregnation method. Taking the synthesis procedure of 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 sample for instance, 1 g of commercial nano-Al2O3 (Aladdin, γ phase, 10 nm) was impregnated with a mixture of 0.5 mL of SnCl2·H2O ethanol solution (20.0 mgSn/mL), 0.132 mL of H2PtCl6·6H2O ethanol solution (7.5 mgPt/mL), and 1 mL of ethanol. Subsequently, the resultant slurry was dried at 60 °C overnight, and then calcined at 500 °C for 4 h. The control samples including 0.1Pt/nano-Al2O3, 0.5Pt/nano-Al2O3 and 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 were synthesized by following the same way.
2.2. Characterization
The loadings of both Pt and Sn in the as-prepared samples were measured by an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES; Thermo IRIS Intrepid II XSP, Thermo Electron Co).
The CO-pulse chemisorption experiments were applied for estimating the dispersion of Pt in the samples, which were performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 apparatus. In a typical process, 200 mg of the sample was packed into a U-shaped quartz tube. After being pretreated with 10 vol% H2/Ar at 600 °C for 2 h, the sample was cooled down to 50 °C. Then a pulse of 10 vol% CO/He was repeatedly introduced to the system until the chemisorption of CO was saturated. The adsorption stoichiometry of Pt/CO was assumed to be 1:1 for the calculation of Pt dispersion.
The electron microscopy measurements were performed on the JEOL JEM-2100F microscope operating at 200 kV and the JEOL JEM-ARM200F equipped with a CEOS probe corrector for particle size distribution statistics and atomically resolved images, respectively. Before the AC-HAADF-STEM measurements, the samples were pretreated in 20 vol% H2/He at 600 °C for 2 h. The pretreated samples were sequentially dispersed in alcohol, dropped on the copper grid, and fixed on the holder in glove box. Finally, the holder was quickly transformed to the vacuum chamber of the transmission electron microscope.
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) including X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra were performed at the BL14W1, Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF), China [31]. Si (111) and Si (311)-crystal monochromators were used for energy selection of L3-edge of Pt and K-edge of Sn, respectively. The Pt L3-edge were recorded at room temperature in the transmission or fluorescence mode, based on the energy calibration of Pt foil. The samples were prepared following the same procedure as that for the AC-HAADF-STEM measurement, except that the catalyst powder was pressed into tablets and sealed in the Kapton packs in glove box. The Sn K-edge was collected in situ due to its highly sensitive property to oxygen [32]. The optimized amount of sample powder was loaded into a tubular reactor designed for transmission mode. Before the measurement, the sample was reduced in situ in 20 vol% H2/He for 2 h at 600 °C and then cooled down to room temperature for data collection. The data were analyzed by the Athena software packages [33].
In situ XPS spectra were collected on a ThermoFisher Excalab 250Xi+ instrument. The binding energy of Pt and Sn species in the samples were calibrated by the adventitious carbon (C 1s peak at 284.6 eV). The as-prepared samples were reduced in 20 vol% H2/He at 600 °C for 2 h in an ultra-high vacuum (UHV) -connected high-pressure gas chamber. After the pretreatment, the samples were transferred to the analyzer chamber under UHV conditions.
In situ CO-DRIFTS were collected by an infrared spectrometer (Vertex 70, Bruker), equipped with a mercury-cadmium-telluride detector in the range 400–4000 cm–1 with a resolution of 4 cm–1. The measurements were carried out at room temperature under ambient pressure. In a typical procedure, the sample was packed into a sample cell (HC-500, Pike technologies) and reduced firstly in 20 vol% H2/Ar gas stream (20 mL min–1) at 600 °C for 2 h. After Ar purging for 10 min, the reaction gas (volume ratio: C3H8 : H2 : Ar = 14 : 14 : 72) was introduced into the cell for reacting 3 h. When the system cooled down to room temperature under Ar stream (20 mL min–1), the background spectrum was collected. Subsequently, 5 vol% CO/He gas stream (20 mL min–1) was introduced into the sample cell, followed by purging with pure He (20 mL min–1). The adsorption of CO molecules on the surface of the catalysts was monitored continuously until no obvious change in intensity.
2.3. Theoretical calculation methods
2.3.1. SSW-DFT simulation
Our approach for resolving complex metal cluster structures was based on both of the stochastic surface walking (SSW) and density functional theory (DFT) methods as implemented in LASP code [34], where the SSW method could achieve the global potential energy surface exploration. To obtain a reasonable model of PtSn alloy cluster on Al2O3, SSW-DFT method was applied to exhaustively search the phase space of Pt6Sn3/Al2O3. The model was built as follows:
(1)
The structure of γ-Al2O3 supported by a recent theoretical work was used [35]. We adopted γ-Al2O3 (110) structure with (2 × 2) supercell and three Al2O3-layers thickness involving 120 atoms (24 Al2O3 formula units).
(2)
A random Pt6Sn3 cluster was added on the Al2O3 (110) surface.
(3)
Starting from this initial model, more than 100 minima were screened by SSW-DFT simulation. As a result, the optimized structure of Pt6Sn3 on Al2O3 (110) surface was obtained, where a Sn single atom resided atop the Pt6 cluster and the other two Sn atoms located around the Pt6 cluster and bonded with surface O atoms (Fig. 4(a)). This model was adopted for PDH reaction.

The asterisk indicates the adsorption state. The reaction snapshots are shown with the Pt, Sn, Al, O, C and H in cyan, light gray, pink, red, grey and white colours, respectively.
2.3.2. DFT calculations
All DFT calculations were performed by using the plane wave VASP code [36], where electron-ion interaction was represented by the projector augmented wave pseudopotential [37, 38]. The exchange functional utilized was the spin-polarized GGA-PBE [39]. The kinetic energy cut-off was set as 400 eV. The first Brillion zone k-point sampling utilized the 1 × 1 × 1 gamma-centred mesh grid. The energy and force criterion for convergence of the electron density and structure optimization were set at 10–5 eV and 0.05 eV Å–1, respectively. For computing the PDH reaction profile, the long-range dispersion (van der Waals interactions) corrections at the level of PBE-D3 was utilized, which was found to improve the adsorption of reaction intermediates [40].
2.4. Reaction tests
PDH reaction was carried out in a quartz fix-bed reactor with 10 mm in diameter and 200 mm in length. All tests were performed in a feed gas composition of 14 vol% C3H8, 14 vol% H2 and 72 vol% He (30 mL min–1) under ambient pressure at 600 °C. Typically, 100 mg of the catalyst was loaded to the tubular reactor, and then heated to 600 °C (10 °C min–1) for 2 h in a flow of 20 vol% H2/He. After purging with pure He for 10 min, the reaction gas was introduced into the reactor. The products were analyzed using an online GC (Agilent Technologies 6890N) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The propane conversion, propylene selectivity and the productivity were obtained by the following equations:
(1)
XC3H8 = ([FC3H8]inlet – [FC3H8]outlet)/[FC3H8]inlet × 100%
(2)
SC3H6 = [FC3H6]outlet/∑i((ni/3) × [Fi]outlet) × 100%
(3)
Productivity = ([FC3H8]inlet × XC3H8 × SC3H6)/(Vm × mPt) molC3H6 gPt–1 h–1
where F is responsible for the flow rate of propane or propylene. XC3H8 and SC3H6 refer to the conversion and selectivity of the catalysts, respectively. The i refers to the hydrocarbon products in the outlet gas flow and ni means the carbon number of component i. Vm represents the ideal gas molar volume under the standard condition. mPt means the mass of Pt.
The catalyst stability was evaluated using a first-order deactivation model:
(4)
kd = (ln((1 – Xfinal)/Xfinal) – ln((1 – Xinitial)/Xinitial))/t
where Xinitial and Xfinal refer to the conversion measured at the beginning and the end of the test, and t means the reaction time (h), kd is defined as the deactivation rate constant (h–1), a higher kd value means a poorer stability.
3. Results and discussion
The performances of the 0.1Pt/nano-Al2O3, 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 and 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 catalysts are shown in Fig. 1(a). It is clear that the activity and stability of the PtSn/nano-Al2O3 catalysts are much higher than that of the monometallic Pt/nano-Al2O3. The initial conversion of propane over the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 catalyst is 43%, while sharply decreases to 35% after the first 3 h. The corresponding deactivation rate constant kd-3h, as high as 0.11 h–1, is almost 5 times more than the full-time value (kd-40h: 0.020 h–1) (Fig. 1(b)). However, for the course from 3 to 40 h, especially between 10 to 40 h, the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 catalyst is relatively stable (kd-3~40h: 0.013 h–1, kd-10~40h: 0.0026 h–1). As a contrast, the catalytic behavior of the 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 is distinct from that of the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3, resembling the traditional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst reported in the literatures [41, 42]. The variation of kd for 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 during the whole reaction process is inconspicuous (kd-3h: 0.040 h–1, kd-3~40h: 0.019 h–1, kd-10~40h: 0.019 h–1, kd-40h: 0.020 h–1). Notably, the catalytic activity of the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 is much higher than that of the 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 across the overall PDH process (e.g., 47.6 vs 11.1 molC3H6 gPt–1 h–1 and 27.2 vs. 7.6 molC3H6 gPt–1 h–1 in productivity calculated in the initial and final period, respectively), which also outperforms the state-of-the-art PtSn-based PDH catalysts (Fig. 1(c) and Table S2).

The atomic configuration and size distributions of the samples were characterized by the AC-HAADF-STEM. After the calcination at 500 °C for 4 h, the images of the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 catalyst show that the Pt and Sn are all dispersed as single atoms on the surface of the nano-Al2O3 (Fig. 2(a) and Fig. S1). After the reduction at 600 °C for 2 h, the nanoclusters appear with the average particle size estimated to be 0.85 nm (Fig. 2(b) and Fig. S2(c)), and no large nanoparticles in the arbitrarily selected areas can be observed (Figs. S2(a) and (b)). On the other hand, the particle size range from 1 to 10 nm in the 0.1Pt/nano-Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. S3) and large nanoparticles with a diameter of about 10 nm also present in the 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 (Figs. S4(a) and (b)).

The EDS mappings of the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 after the reduction (d–f) and PDH reaction (g–i) for 12 h.
The AC-HAADF-STEM images and EDS mapping of the reduced 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 show that the Pt atoms aggregate to nanoclusters interspersed by a small fraction of Sn species, while the majority of Sn are still distributed as single atoms on the support (Figs. 2(d)–(f) and Fig. S5). In sharp contrast, the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 after PDH reaction involves more uniformly dispersed Sn in the PtSn bimetallic structure, leading to a slightly increased size of the bimetallic nanoparticles (from 0.85 to 1.2 nm) (Figs. 2(c), (g)–(i), Figs. S6 and S7). Therefore, the sharp deactivation of the initial activity for the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 could be mainly due to the reconstruction of the Pt and Sn atoms over the nano-Al2O3 support. For the 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 catalyst, the results of the EDS signify that all the observed nanoparticles are PtSn alloy with similar composition regardless of before and after PDH reaction (Fig. S8). Furthermore, the diameters of the PtSn nanoparticles keep constant at ~1.0 nm (Fig. S4(c) and Fig. S9). This implies that the continuous deactivation with a constant kd for the 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 catalyst might be solely due to the coke deposition.
To confirm the interactions between Pt and Sn in the reduced 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3, the in situ XPS was conducted. The XPS spectrum of Sn 3d for the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 is presented in Fig. 3(a). The Sn0 species are discovered with the binding energy at 485.2 eV [43], which could be a solid proof for the formation of the PtSn alloy considering the common belief that the reduction of Sn heavily relied on the hydrogen spillover effect of Pt [44]. Only those Sn atoms in close contact with Pt could be possible to be reduced to metallic state, and there were no monometallic Sn nanoparticles in the reduced samples. While the peak ranged in 486.4–486.6 eV could be assigned to SnOx strongly interacted with the nano-Al2O3 support, since XPS is incapable of differentiating the Sn2+ and Sn4+ species [45]. Accordingly, the metallic Sn is also found in 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 (Fig. 3(b)), with a higher proportion (17.6%) compared with the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 counterpart (12.3%), suggesting more SnOx moieties are dispersed over the nano-Al2O3 in the latter. Besides, the Pt 4d5/2 XPS spectra of the 0.5Pt/nano-Al2O3 and 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 samples were also collected (Fig. S10), owing to the overlap of the binding energy of Pt 4f and Al 2p [46]. For the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3, the Pt loading is too low to be detected. The results show that the binding energy of Pt 4d of the 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 (314.3 eV) is slightly lower than that of the 0.5Pt/nano-Al2O3 (314.6 eV) because of the electron donation effect of Sn [47].

Normalized in situ XANES spectra at the Pt L3-edge (c) and Sn K-edge (e), as well as the corresponding k2-weighted Fourier transform spectra at the Pt L3-edge (d) and Sn K-edge (f) (without phase correction) of the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 during PDH reaction. The Pt foil, Sn foil, SnO and SnO2 were provided as references.
To further monitor the evolutions of the valence state and local structure of the Pt and Sn, the XAS spectra including XANES and EXAFS were collected at the different stages during the reaction process. Fig. 3(c) shows the normalized XANES spectra at Pt L3-edge with the Pt foil as reference. It is found that the white lines of the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 catalysts are all lower than that of the Pt foil, which could be contributed to the electron transfer from Sn to Pt [32]. Among them, the white line intensity of the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 after the long-term reaction is the lowest, indicating that the interaction between Sn and Pt becomes stronger as the proceeding of PDH reaction. Correspondingly, the EXAFS spectra in Fig. 3(d) exhibit that the main peaks located within the range of 2–3 Å, which refer to Pt–Pt and/or Pt–Sn bonds [48]. Besides, a weak peak is observed at around 1.9 Å in all of the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3, which is corresponding to the Pt–O bond. In this regard, it is convinced that a small fraction of Pt still tightly bond with the oxygen atoms of the surrounding SnOx species even in the reduction atmosphere [6]. The fitting results of the EXAFS data in Table 1 and Figs. S11 and S12 further affirm that the distance of Pt-Sn in the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 after the reduction is shorter than that of the reacted samples (2.66 vs. 2.81 or 2.80 Å). It was reported that 2.82 Å is the exact bond length of Pt-Sn in the Pt3Sn intermetallic compound [49]. Therefore, it is reasonable that the PtSn alloy supported over the nano-Al2O3 has transformed to Pt3Sn intermetallic compound after PDH reaction for 3 h, which remains stable in the following reaction. While the reduced 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 with the shorter Pt-Sn bond but high activity should involve a disparate PtSn alloy.
To make the structure of the PtSn alloy clearer, in situ XAS of the Sn at K-edge of the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 catalyst was further collected (Fig. 3(e)). Distinguished from the SnO2, the profile of the XANES spectrum of Sn in the reduced 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 is similar with the SnO and Sn foil, suggesting that the average valence state of Sn in the reduced 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 might be between 0 and +2. The corresponding Fourier transform spectrum (Fig. 3(f)) and the fitting results (Table 1 and Fig. S13) demonstrate that the atoms adjacent to Sn are only O and Pt with the distance of 2.12 and 2.66 Å, respectively. These results corroborate that the Sn exist as single atoms in the reduced 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3. According to the reported works, the Sn prefers to stay at the surface of the Pt after the reduction even though the surface Sn has been leached out [11, 17]. Therefore, the PtSn structure of the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 can be imaged as single-atom Sn anchored on the surface of the Pt clusters, defined as Sn1Pt single atom alloy (Sn1Pt SAA), the high activity of which is consistent with the recently machine-learning-based simulation results that low-coordinated Pt atoms and high Pt/Sn ratios are highly active for PDH reaction [50]. Sequentially, the Sn1Pt SAA begins to transform to Pt3Sn intermetallic compound under PDH reaction conditions. As a comparison, the changes of the distance between Pt and Sn in the 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 are almost negligible throughout all the reaction process (Table S3), manifesting that the 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 always maintains a stable Pt3Sn intermetallic compound. However, it is noteworthy that the productivity and stability of the Pt3Sn intermetallic compounds evolved from the Sn1Pt SAA in the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 are distinctly superior to that of the 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3.

The accuracies of the above parameters were defined as N, ±20%; R, ±1%. The S02 was set as 0.85 and 0.77, which was corrected by fitting the Pt and Sn foil references, respectively. The Δk (3.0–10.8 Å−1 for Pt and 3.0–11.2 Å−1 for Sn) and ΔR (1.4–3.3 Å for Pt and 1.2–3.0 Å for Sn) were the data ranges applied for data fitting in k-space and R-space, respectively.
The excellent PDH activity of the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 could be attributed to its unique Sn1Pt SAA catalytic center as further confirmed by DFT calculations. The Sn1Pt SAA structure on Al2O3 surface was obtained by using SSW global optimization based on DFT simulation to explore the global potential energy surface of Pt6Sn3/Al2O3. The cluster containing three types of Sn coordination environments, i.e. Sn1Pt SAA, Pt–Sn–O and isolated [SnO3], is 3.5 eV more stable than that without Sn1Pt SAA coordination environment (Fig. 4(a)), suggesting the high thermodynamic stability of Sn1Pt SAA structure. Besides, the Bader charge analysis shows that the electrons of Sn atoms in Sn1Pt SAA structure is 3.2 e–, much larger than the electrons of Sn atoms in Pt–Sn–O and isolated [SnO3] coordination environments (2.64 and 2.74 e–). The more electrons for Sn1Pt SAA structure points to the presence of Sn0, which is consistent with the XPS results. Therefore, the Sn1Pt SAA was used as the active site to explore the PDH mechanism.
Figs. 4(b) and 4(c) show the calculated lowest Gibbs free energy pathway for PDH reaction over the Sn1Pt SAA. The reaction starts from propane adsorption onto Pt atom, which is an endothermic process by increasing 0.84 eV in free energy due to the entropy loss under reaction condition at 873 K. The Gibbs free energy barrier for abstraction of the first H atom from the methyl group of the adsorbed propane is calculated as 0.63 eV, for which the reaction is endothermic by 0.28 eV. Then, the generated CH3CH2CH2 species further break the C–H bond of methylene group, forming the adsorbed propene and H atom. The cleavage of the second C–H bond gives a very low reaction barrier of 0.26 eV and the reaction Gibbs free energy is –0.17 eV. Sequentially, two absorbed H atoms are prone to recombine to H2 molecule with a barrier of 0.38 eV and the reaction energy of –0.57 eV. Finally, the propene desorption process releases 0.39 eV in free energy. By contrast, the PDH reaction on Pt3Sn (111) surface is subject to a much higher reaction barrier in the abstraction of the first H atom, where the energy barriers of propane adsorption and first C–H bond rupture are calculated to be 1.00 and 0.94 eV, respectively, and the overall free energy barrier for PDH on Pt3Sn (111) is as high as 1.94 eV at 873 K.
Based on the free energy reaction profiles, the microkinetics simulations were performed to determine the PDH reaction rate on Sn1Pt SAA structure and Pt3Sn (111) surface. At the steady state, the reaction sites on both Sn1Pt SAA structure and Pt3Sn (111) are largely empty as all intermediate concentrations are less than 10–4, confirming that the propane activation is the rate-determining step. At 873 K, the calculated turn-over-frequency (TOF) for PDH reaction on Sn1Pt SAA structure is around 6.12 × 104 s–1, which is about three orders of magnitude larger than that on Pt3Sn (111) surface (97 s–1), as illustrated in Fig. 4(d). To further confirm the high activity of Sn1Pt SAA, we removed Sn atoms from the Pt clusters and recalculated the PDH reaction pathway. As shown in Fig. S15, the reaction barrier on Pt cluster without Sn1Pt SAA is 1.54 eV with the TOF of 2.86 × 104 s–1. The reaction rate is twice slower than that on Pt cluster with Sn1Pt SAA, proving the importance of Sn1Pt SAA structure. From these kinetics results, it could be concluded that the presence of Sn1Pt SAA clusters does significantly improve the propene production activity, which supports the high activity of the Sn1Pt SAA catalyst in experiment.
To unravel the underlying reason, in situ CO-DRIFTS experiments were performed. As shown in Fig. 5(a), the absorption bands at 2070 and 1840 cm–1 are seen on the reduced monometallic 0.1Pt/nano-Al2O3, which could be ascribed to linear CO adsorption on the under-coordinated Pt atoms and the bridged CO absorption on the Pt nanoparticles, respectively [51]. The intensity of CO adsorption band at 2070 cm–1 increases immensely for the reduced bimetallic 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3, implying more Pt atoms are exposed with the aid of Sn. Meanwhile, a new band centered at 2007 cm–1 appears, which could be attributed to CO adsorbed on the Pt atoms of the Sn1Pt surface alloy [41], quite agreed with the results of XPS and XAS spectra. Concurrent with the ascending intensity of the band at 2007 cm–1, a shoulder band at 2052 cm–1 presents after PDH reaction, which might be assigned to CO adsorbed on the Pt in close contact with SnOx [25]. This result demonstrates that the interaction between Pt and Sn is ever increasing with time on stream, indicating the formation of the Pt3Sn intermetallic compound. Oppositely, the participation of Sn in the 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 brings about the decreased exposure of the Pt atoms, evidenced by the reduced absorption band at 2070 cm–1 (Fig. 5(b)). Simultaneously, a broadening band is observed due to the formation of a new band at 2085 cm–1, which could be ascribed to the well-coordinated Pt atoms at terrace sites regarded as the active centers of the deep dehydrogenation and carbon deposition [52]. It was reported that a small amount of monometallic Pt phase commonly coexisted in the PtSn intermetallic system [53]. Therefore, the surface of the Pt3Sn intermetallic compound in the 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 should be partially occupied by the Pt segments with the abundant terrace sites, according to the suppressed CO adsorption on PtSn alloy at 2007 cm–1 and the slightly higher Pt dispersion (85.6%) compared with the rigorous intermetallic compounds. We can envision that the consecutively deposited coke would cover the Pt atoms during PDH reaction, resulting in the declined CO absorption bands on the reacted 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3.

These data, taken together, enable us to clearly delineate the evolution process of the PtSn/nano-Al2O3 catalysts in PDH reaction (Fig. 5(c)). During the reduction process, the limited Pt in the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 restricts the hydrogen spillover effect [44]. Only a tiny proportion of Sn atoms are gradually reduced and interspersed over the newly formed Pt nanoclusters to form Sn1Pt SAA, which exhibits an extremely high catalytic activity (47.6 molC3H6 gPt–1 h–1). Upon continuous PDH reaction, the more reduced Sn single atoms begin to transfer and permeate into the Pt phase to generate Pt3Sn intermetallic compound, accounting for the rapid decreased activity during the first 3 h (kd-3h: 0.11 h–1). In this scenario, the limited Pt atoms are totally evolved to Pt3Sn intermetallic compound surrounded by the excess residual SnOx species, which act as the nano-glue for suppressing the particles sintering [54, 55] and as coke remover for the transformation of carbon deposited to the support [56, 57]. Therefore, the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 catalyst delivers a quite stable performance (kd-10~40h: 0.0026 h–1). Otherwise, increasing the mass ratio of Pt/Sn would be oriented to directly produce the stable Pt3Sn intermetallic compound due to the spring out of a large amount of the reduced Pt and Sn during the reduction process. Meanwhile, the superficial Pt phase with copious adjacent Pt atoms and less SnOx are remained, which are inclined to generate more coke during the reaction. As a result, the moderate activity (11.1 molC3H6 gPt–1 h–1) and deactivation rate (kd-40h: 0.020 h–1) are achieved on the 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3.
4. Conclusions
The evolution of Sn1Pt SAA is elucidated unequivocally for the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 catalyst in PDH reaction using various robust characterizations and theoretical calculations. Distinct from the 0.5Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 analogue, the adjacent Pt atoms with terrace sites, regarded as the active sites of coke generation, are absent in the evolved 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 catalyst. On account of the high purity of Pt3Sn intermetallic compound and large amount of surrounding SnOx species, both activity and stability of the 0.1Pt1Sn/nano-Al2O3 are promoted. Our results provide new insights into the active sites and the deactivation mechanism of the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst in PDH reaction, affording an alternative strategy to regulate the industrial PDH catalyst at the atomic level.
