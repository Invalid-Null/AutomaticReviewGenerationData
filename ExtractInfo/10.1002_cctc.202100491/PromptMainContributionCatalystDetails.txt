Propane Aromatization Tuned by Tailoring Cr Modified Ga/ZSM-5 Catalysts
Graphical Abstract
Catalytic propane aromatization: Post-introducing Cr species to Ga/Z5 catalyst had the maximum dehydrogenated active Cr3+ species. Propane was effectively converted, and more light alkenes from propane dehydrogenation were converted into BTX on 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst. Active Cr3+ species and strong interaction between Ga species and ZSM-5 zeolite on 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst accelerated the dehydrogenation step in propane aromatization.
Abstract
Accelerating propane dehydrogenation in propane aromatization is vital because it is the first and rate control step. In this study, we introduced Cr to Ga/ZSM-5 by tuning its impregnation sequence and amount, which was expected to accelerate the dehydrogenation step and improve aromatization performance. The impregnation sequence of Cr on catalyst not only affected the interaction between Ga and ZSM-5, but also tuned the amount of dehydrogenation active species Cr3+. Due to the plenty of Cr3+ species and strong interaction between Ga species and ZSM-5, 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst accelerated the dehydrogenation step and improved the aromatization process. More light hydrocarbons were preferred to be produced and were further converted into BTX on 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst. Excessive Cr on catalyst caused the formation of Cr2O3 particles with worse dispersion. The aggregated Cr2O3 decreased the strong acidity of catalyst, which could not further promote propane conversion and decreased the aromatization ability of catalyst.
Introduction
Light aromatics, especially benzene, toluene and xylene (BTX), as the important basic chemical materials, are mainly produced via traditional fossil-based routes. With the depleting of crude oil, it is necessary to explore alternative strategies for BTX synthesis. So far, plenty of studies have reported the successful synthesis method of BTX from other routes, such as methanol to aromatics (MTA),1 syngas to aromatics (STA),2 CO2 hydrogenation to aromatics,3 and aromatization of light alkanes.4 Among them, aromatization of light alkanes has attracted more and more attentions because of the adequacy of raw materials and low-cost property of the technological process.5
Light alkanes aromatization reaction contains a set of processes: olefins formation through alkane dehydrogenation (containing cracking), oligomerization of olefins, subsequent olefins interconversion, formation of new oligomers through olefins alkylation followed by hydrogen transfer, dehydrogenation, cyclization and aromatization.6 ZSM-5 zeolite is recognized as a promising solid acidic catalyst for light alkanes aromatization. To date, previous reports have demonstrated that Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst showed superior catalytic performance due to its good dehydrogenation ability and the excellent aromatization ability.7 Introducing Ga to ZSM-5 promoted the formation of Lewis acid sites, which accelerated the dehydrogenation step.8 It was reported that Ga species at ion exchange sites of ZSM-5 zeolite was the most active dehydrogenation sites in propane aromatization.9 Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst showed high aromatization selectivity, lower active components loss, and strong resistance to impurities. Recently, more and more attentions were paid to adding other promoters to Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst.10 He et al. found that the better dispersed Ag and Ga species and the moderate amount of Brönsted and Lewis acid were vital to olefin and methane aromatization over Ag-Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst.10d Gomez and Niu et al. reported that phosphorus-modified Ga/ZSM-5 showed well catalytic performance in the tandem reaction of CO2-assisted ethane or propane aromatization.10e, 10f Phosphorus species improved hydrothermal stability of Ga/ZSM-5 and reduced coke formation. Samanta reported that introducing Pt to Ga/HZSM-5 considerably accelerated dehydrogenation step in ethane aromatization and facilitated hydrogen spillover.10g Li reported that the co-existence of Zn and Ga species on HZSM-5 had a positive effect on BTX formation because of the enhanced Lewis acid sites by highly dispersed Zn and Ga species and the enlarged microporous structure of ZSM-5 catalyst.10h
In propane aromatization, propane dehydrogenation is the first and a crucial step, which requires higher reaction temperature. Appropriate introduction of dehydrogenation components on catalyst is expected to reduce the difficulty of propane dehydrogenation and accelerate the following aromatization process. Generally, chromium-based catalyst is one of the most efficient catalysts for alkanes dehydrogenation.11 Owing to the low price and excellent catalytic behaviors, chromium-based catalysts have been extremely widely applied in propane dehydrogenation industry. Isolated or unsaturated Cr3+ species were regarded as the most active sites in propane dehydrogenation.12 Cavani et al. compared the activity of three types of Cr3+ species in isobutane dehydrogenation reaction.12c The activity order was described as: Cr3+ in dispersed Cr2O3, i. e., amorphous or microcrystalline Cr2O3>redox Cr3+ from the reduction of Cr6+ species>α-Cr2O3. Hu et al. presented that Cr species combined with Brönsted acid sites in Cr/HZSM-5 catalysts were responsible for the high catalytic performance of propane dehydrogenation.13 The high surface area and good pore structure of HZSM-5 could provide an excellent environment for dispersion of Cr species. And Brönsted acid sites increased the propane adsorption ability and enhanced C−H bond activation ability. Raddi et al. added Cr to Pt/ZSM-5 and found that the addition of Cr species promoted the dispersion of Pt species, and facilitated the process of dehydrogenation in propane conversion.14
In this work, we introduced the efficient dehydrogenation species Cr component to Ga/ZSM-5, which was expected to accelerate the dehydrogenation step in propane aromatization, and further improve the catalytic performance. Wherein, the introduced sequences and amounts of Cr to catalysts were investigated. Various characterization techniques were employed to uncover the reaction mechanism and clarify the relationship between the catalyst properties and catalytic performances. Investigating the effect of Cr on Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst was significant to reveal the synergistic effect between dehydrogenation and aromatization reaction, as well as to design the more efficient light alkanes aromatization catalysts.
Results and Discussion
Catalytic performance and characterization of Cr modified catalysts with different Cr impregnation sequences
The catalytic performance of Cr modified catalysts with different Cr impregnation sequences was tested at 540 °C with a GHSV of 6000 mL ⋅ g−1 ⋅ h−1 under atmospheric pressure. As shown in Figure 1a, about 47.1 % C3H8 was converted with the 51.5 % BTX selectivity over Ga/Z5 catalyst. After introducing Cr species to ZSM-5, the catalysts showed different performances. Ga/2CrZ5 catalyst exhibited a low C3H8 conversion of 39.7 % and a similar BTX selectivity compared with pure Ga/Z5 catalyst. For 2Cr-Ga/Z5 catalyst, it exhibited a slightly lower conversion than Ga/Z5 and the lowest BTX selectivity among all the catalysts. It is worth noting that C3H8 conversion increased from 47.1 % to 50.9 % over 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst, and the BTX selectivity reached up to 55.7 %. The products selectivity in the outlet of different samples were given in Figure 1b. CH4 and C2 hydrocarbons were the main by-products in the outlet, followed by C3H6 and C4−C6 hydrocarbons. For 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst, the proportion of light alkanes decreased in the products. As we know, C3H6 and C2H4 were the main products in propane dehydrogenation reaction. These decreased light olefins on 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst might be attributed to the further conversion to BTX. Therefore, the selectivity of BTX was improved. These results clearly indicated that the impregnation sequence of Cr to catalyst could affect the catalytic performance, and post-introducing Cr to Ga/Z5 had a positive effect on propane aromatization. In addition, the catalytic evaluations of 2Cr/Z5 and HZSM-5 catalyst were also tested, and the results were listed in Table S1. For 2Cr/Z5 catalyst, although the catalytic performance C3H8 conversion increased from 24.1 % to 28.1 %, and C2H4 and C3H6 selectivity decreased from 48.8 % to 43.6 % compared with HZSM-5 catalyst. However, BTX selectivity increased from 11.9 % to 14.7 %. These decreased light alkenes might be converted into BTX on acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolite. Based on these results, we proved that the addition of Cr species on ZSM-5 catalyst could substantially promote the dehydrogenation step in propane aromatization reaction. Moreover, it could be seen from the evaluation data that the catalytic performance of Ga/Z5 was much better than Cr/Z5 catalyst in Table S1, indicating the interaction between Ga species and ZSM-5 was important, and Ga/Z5 catalyst played a major role in propane aromatization.

In order to understand the role of Cr species in catalytic activity, we adopted various characterization methods to analyze catalysts. XRD patterns of the prepared catalysts were shown in Figure S1. All the catalysts showed characteristic diffraction peaks of MFI topology structure in the ranges of 2θ=7–10° and 22–26°, which indicated that the structure of ZSM-5 zeolite was stable after the modification of Ga and Cr.15 Moreover, no diffraction peaks belonging to Ga and Cr species could be observed on catalysts, suggesting that the introduced metal species were highly dispersed or the amounts of Ga and Cr were too low to be detected.16
XRF and N2 physical adsorption were employed to analyze the element compositions and texture properties of the catalysts. In Table 1, the ratio of Si/Al of all catalyst was close to that of raw HZSM-5. The actual contents of Ga and Cr on catalysts were similar to their theoretical contents. The texture properties of all samples were also given in Table 1. All these catalysts were ascribed to the typical micropore structure according to the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms (Figure S2), and the catalysts modified by Cr showed the slightly decreased micropore surface area and micropore volume.

[a]. The ratio of Si/Al, Ga and Cr content were measured by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy, [b]. Total specific surface was calculated by Brunner-Emmet-Teller (BET) measurement, [c]. Micropore surface and micropore volume was calculated by t-plot method, [d]. The external surface was obtained by subtracting the micropore specific surface area from total specific surface area, [e]. Total pore volume was determined by volume adsorbed at p/p0=0.99.
The acidic property of catalysts was characterized by NH3-TPD and Py-IR measurements. The results were exhibited in Table 2, Figure S3 and S4. Clearly, all the samples presented two NH3 desorption peaks in Figure S3: The first peak before 340 °C was corresponding to weak acid sites; and the second peak above 340 °C was assigned to strong acid sites of catalyst.7a Both the weak and strong acidic strength were weakened after introducing Cr species. The quantitative results of acidic amounts were summarized in Table 2. The Cr modified Ga/Z5 catalyst had fewer weak acid, which indicated that Cr species covered some acid sites of ZSM-5 zeolite. Except for 2Cr-Ga/Z5, 2Ga/CrZ5 and 2Cr/GaZ5 catalysts had less strong acid sites than Ga/Z5. Moreover, introducing Cr species to catalyst decreased the concentration of Brönsted acid sites (BAS), while the concentration of Lewis acid sites (LAS) did not change (Figure S4). The strong BAS was conductive to oligomerization, cyclizing, and aromatization process for propane aromatization. Although both Ga/2CrZ5 and 2Cr/GaZ5 catalysts had the decreased concentration of strong BAS, 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst still had the highest BTX selectivity. Therefore, the concentration of BAS on catalyst was enough to aromatization, and the variation of acidic properties due to Cr introduction was not the main factor for different catalytic performances.

Different Cr impregnation sequences could affect the interaction between metal and ZSM-5 zeolite. XPS characterization was carried out to verify the chemical states of Ga and Cr specie on catalysts. Figure 2 showed Ga 2p3/2 XPS spectra of the as-prepared catalysts. The binding energy (BE) peak of Ga 2p3/2 for Ga/Z5 and 2Cr/GaZ5 samples centered at 1118.9 eV, higher than that of pure Ga2O3 (1117.9 eV), which indicated that there was strong interaction between Ga species and ZSM-5 zeolite.9 The stronger interaction between Ga species and ZSM-5 zeolite could promote the synergistic effect of dehydrogenation step and subsequent aromatization.17 Post-introduction of Cr on Ga/Z5 did not affect this interaction between Ga species and ZSM-5 zeolite on 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst. However, Ga 2p3/2 BE value of Ga/2CrZ5 and 2Cr-Ga/Z5 samples was lower than 1118.9 eV, suggesting that the interaction between Ga and ZSM-5 catalyst was weakened. Cr species could interact with ZSM-5 and hinder the binding of Ga on ZSM-5. Cr 2p3/2 XPS spectra of these catalysts could also reflect the different interaction between Cr species and ZSM-5 (Figure S5), which affected the valence state of Cr species. Two peaks at around 576.5 and 578.5 eV associated to Cr3+ and Cr6+ could be observed, respectively.18 And the quantitative data after fitting were listed in Table 3. All the catalysts had similar BE values in Figure S5. However, the ratio of Cr3+/Cr6+ was different. 2Cr/GaZ5 had the highest Cr3+/Cr6+ ratio, while the low Cr3+/Cr6+ ratio was observed on Ga/2CrZ5 and 2Cr-Ga/Z5 catalyst. As reported, because of the presence of strong interactions between Cr species and ZSM-5 zeolite supports such as the formation of Al−O−Cr and/or Si−O−Cr linkages, firstly introducing Cr to ZSM-5 caused much more Cr6+ preferentially.19 Post-impregnating Cr into Ga/Z5 generated more dehydrogenation active Cr3+ species, which significantly accelerated the dehydrogenation step in propane aromatization. From XPS results, 2Cr/GaZ5 sample showed strong interaction between Ga species and ZSM-5 zeolite, which promoted the dehydrogenation step and subsequent aromatization. More Cr3+ species on the catalyst played a positive role in promoting the propane dehydrogenation step.

Herein, in situ C3H8-DRIFT experiments were operated to make more insights into the mechanism of BTX synthesis from propane over Cr modified Ga/Z5 catalysts. Positive peaks represented the formation and negative peaks represented consumption in Figure S6 and Figure 3. In Figure S6, complex overlapped bands were observed at 2800–3000 cm−1 (at about 2957, 2922, 2904, 2886, 2973 cm−1), which were ascribed to the C−H bond stretching vibrations of ethyl and methyl groups.20 The band at 1331 cm−1 was assigned to the stretching vibration of C=C bond, indicating the efficient conversion of propane to alkenes on Ga/Z5 catalyst. Additionally, the bands at 1504 and 1469 cm−1 belonged to C−H bending vibrations of hydrogen-deficient aromatics,21 indicating the formation of aromatics successfully. The variations of OH region with reaction time on stream were displayed in Figure 3. Clearly, the bands at around 3601 cm−1 was ascribed to the stretching vibration of Si(OH)Al bridged bond, which was associated with BAS.8 The band at 3651 cm−1 was ascribed to extra-framework Al−OH group, which was associated with LAS.22 It was generally believed that LAS mainly played an important role in dehydrogenation and formation of cycloolefin intermediates.23 BAS contributes to olefin interconversion (containing cracking), oligomerization of olefins, subsequent formation of new oligomers followed by hydrogen transfer, cyclization and aromatization. The gradually increased BAS consumption peaks with the proceeding of reaction indicated the rapid conversion of intermediates and propane. For 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst, impregnating Cr to Ga/Z5 accelerated the consumption of BAS compared with other catalysts in Figure 3, which might be attributed to that more Cr3+ on 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst accelerated propane dehydrogenation, and then most of olefins from dehydrogenation step were quickly converted on BAS. Moreover, from the catalytic performance results, less light alkenes and more aromatics proved that more light alkenes produced from dehydrogenation step rapidly were converted into BTX under the function of Cr3+ species.

To further identify the dehydrogenation capacity of these catalysts, C3H8-TPSR experiments were carried out and the results were given in Figure 4. Ga/Z5, Ga/2CrZ5, and 2Cr-Ga/Z5 catalysts showed the similar propane conversion temperature. However, propane was converted over 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst at lower reaction temperature, and the propane consumption was the highest on this catalyst (Figure 4a). The signal of the produced H2 was an important indicator by which to demonstrate the dehydrogenation capacity of catalyst. In Figure 4b, impregnating Cr to Ga/Z5 decreased the dehydrogenation temperature and produced more H2 compared with other catalysts. Additionally, the lowest amount of C3H6 over 2Cr/GaZ5 suggested that much more propene produced by propane dehydrogenation had undergone further conversion soon (Figure 4c). In Figure 4d, a large amount of BTX was preferentially formed on 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst. These results demonstrated that post-introducing Cr to Ga/Z5 decreased the difficulty of dehydrogenation and accelerated propane dehydrogenation step. Much more light alkene intermediates were produced by propane dehydrogenation and then were further rapidly converted into BTX under the synergistic catalytic interaction between Cr3+ species and Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst

The impregnation sequences of Cr to catalysts not only affected the interaction between Ga species and ZSM-5 zeolite, but also changed the amount of active dehydrogenated Cr3+ species. Post-impregnating Cr to Ga/Z5 (2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst) decreased the dehydrogenation difficulty and performed better catalytic performance. The residual BAS amount was still sufficient for aromatization process after introducing Cr to Ga/Z5. From the in situ C3H8-DRIFT results, propane was effectively converted into BTX over all the catalysts, but BTX was preferentially formed on 2Cr/GaZ5. Specifically, 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst had the maximum active dehydrogenated Cr3+ species than other catalysts. H2 was preferentially generated from C3H8-TPSR experiment, which showed good dehydrogenation ability of 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst. In addition, the interaction between of Ga and ZSM-5 framework was still strongest on 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst. Therefore, 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst decreased the dehydrogenation difficulty and performed the better catalytic performance than other Cr modified catalysts.
Catalytic performance and characterization of xCr/GaZ5 catalysts
Post-introducing Cr to Ga/Z5 could effectively accelerate dehydrogenation step and improved the propane aromatization. To further study the influence of post-introduced Cr, xCr/GaZ5 catalysts with 1, 2, 4, and 8 wt % Cr were prepared and evaluated for propane aromatization. The results were exhibited in Figure 5 and Table S2. When the Cr content was higher than 2 wt %, propane conversion would not continue to increase. BTX selectivity increased to 57.5 % firstly and then decreased to 54.4 %. In the range of Cr loading amount on catalyst from 1 wt % to 4 wt %, 4Cr/GaZ5 catalyst exhibited the highest BTX selectivity up to 57.5 % with 50.7 % of propane conversion. In Table S2, the variation of C4−C6 selectivity was small, and the proportion of lower hydrocarbons on 4Cr/GaZ5 was the lowest. After continuing to increase Cr loading to 8 wt %, the propane conversion still maintained at 50.6 %, but the selectivity of BTX decreased to 54.4 %. Plenty of C2H4 and C3H6 were produced. The appropriate addition of Cr on catalyst could promote BTX selectivity, but excessive Cr species produced more by-products. The content of Cr species might affect the active sites Cr3+ species and acid sites on Ga/Z5 and shifted the reaction path towards the formation of lower hydrocarbons instead of BTX.

Various characterization techniques were employed to investigate the effect of Cr loading amount on Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane aromatization. Elemental analysis results and texture properties of catalysts were listed in Table S3. The introduced Ga and Cr content were very closed to target contents. Both the BET surface area and micropore area decreased with the increasing amount of Cr.
XRD profiles of xCr/GaZ5 catalysts were shown in Figure 6. No obvious diffraction reflections of Ga and Cr species were found on 1Cr/GaZ5 and 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst, which suggested the well dispersion on catalysts. 4Cr/GaZ5 and 8Cr/GaZ5 catalysts showed weak diffraction peaks at 2θ of 36.2°, 41.6°, 50.3° and 54.9°, which was characteristic of crystalline Cr2O3 phase attributed to the aggregated Cr species.16b Noticeably, the diffraction peaks of MFI topology of ZSM-5 decreased with the increasing content of Cr species, which was ascribed to the micro-absorption of X-ray by Cr2O3 particles.24

It has been recognized that Cr dispersion was an important factor in propane dehydrogenation.13 STEM and EDS elemental mapping were also used to investigate the dispersion of Cr and Ga species. It was clear that Ga species were homogeneously distributed on all catalysts in Figure 7. For 1Cr/GaZ5 catalyst and 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst, STEM and EDS mapping images revealed no aggregated Cr species (Figure 7A–C, 7D–F). With the Cr loading amount increasing to 4 wt %, some particles could be seen on the catalyst and EDS mapping images revealed the aggregated Cr species on 4Cr/GaZ5 catalyst (Figure 7G–I). In Figure 7J–K, more aggregated Cr species with small size could be seen on 8Cr/GaZ5 catalyst, and some big aggregated clusters dispersed on the edge of catalyst. Moreover, Figure 7L also revealed the extremely poor dispersion of Cr species on 8Cr/GaZ5 catalyst. The dispersion of Cr species became worse with increasing Cr loading. Combined with the XRD results, the aggregated Cr clusters were the crystalline Cr2O3 phase.

UV-Vis characterization was conducted to further illustrate the chemical states of Cr species on xCr/GaZ5 catalysts, and the spectra were exhibited in Figure 8. The peak centered at 370 nm could be assigned to O2−→Cr6+ charge transfer transition of monochromate species in tetrahedral coordination. Two bands at 460 and 600 nm could be assigned to octahedral Cr3+ in Cr2O3 or CrOx clusters.25 UV-Vis spectra showed that all the catalysts had monochromate and Cr3+ species. Combined with the XRD and STEM-EDS mapping images results, Cr3+ species was existed on 4Cr/GaZ5 and 8Cr/GaZ5 catalysts in the form of Cr2O3 besides the well dispersed Cr3+, and highly dispersed Cr3+ species mainly existed on 1Cr/GaZ5 and 2Cr/GaZ5 catalysts. Moreover, the intensity of two bands at 460 and 600 nm on 8Cr/GaZ5 was most intensive, which suggested much more Cr2O3 species existed on the catalyst. De Rossi et al. proposed that highly dispersed Cr3+ species on the surface of catalyst were the most active sites in light alkanes dehydrogenation. Highly dispersed Cr3+ species predominated at low Cr loadings. For the catalyst with higher Cr loadings, aggregated Cr species with less active such as crystalline Cr2O3 appeared.26 Combined with the catalytic behavior, well dispersed Cr3+ promoted the propane conversion and BTX selectivity. The aggregated Cr2O3 crystalline could not further promote propane conversion and decreased BTX selectivity. Besides, the aromatization ability was related to the acidic property of catalysts, which were thus further investigated.

The acidic properties of xCr/GaZ5 catalysts were characterized by NH3-TPD and the results were presented in Figure 9. The weak acid was maintained for xCr/GaZ5 catalysts. However, the amount of strong acid decreased with the increasing amount of Cr, implying that much more strong acid sites was passivated by Cr species. Strong acid amount on 8Cr/GaZ5 catalyst decreased obviously. As we know, the sufficient strong acid was important to aromatization process. 8Cr/GaZ5 catalyst exhibited lower BTX selectivity than 4Cr/GaZ5, which might be due to the lack of strong acid. Although 8Cr/GaZ5 had the least amount of strong acid, its catalytic performance was still better than Ga/Z5. These results suggested that Cr species played an important role in improving catalytic performance.

On the basis of the above characterization analysis and catalytic performances, Cr loading amounts affected its existence form, dispersion, and had an important effect on catalytic performance. Specifically, the dispersion of Cr species became worse and aggregated Cr2O3 species were formed with the increasing of Cr content increasing to 4 wt % on catalysts. Active Cr3+ species displayed good dispersion at low Cr content. The excessive Cr loading caused worse dispersion of Cr species and formed much more Cr2O3 particles. Propane conversion increased from 47.1 % to 50.9 % with the help of well dispersed Cr3+, and excessive Cr2O3 could not further to improve propane conversion. Much more excessive Cr2O3 decreased the strong acid, which was disadvantageous to produce BTX. With an optimal loading amount of 4 wt % Cr on Ga/Z5, BTX selectivity increased from 51.5 % to 57.5 %.
Conclusion
In this study, Cr modified Ga/ZSM-5 catalyst was investigated in propane aromatization. The impregnation sequence and amount of Cr on catalyst were tuned. The introduced sequences of Cr to catalyst not only affected the interaction between Ga species and ZSM-5, but also affected the amount of dehydrogenation active component Cr3+ species. Post-introducing Cr species to Ga/Z5 catalyst had the maximum dehydrogenated active Cr3+ species. Moreover, the strong interaction between Ga species and ZSM-5 was not affected. Due to the strongest interaction between Ga and ZSM-5 framework and the maximum active dehydrogenated Cr3+ species, 2Cr/GaZ5 showed better dehydrogenation ability and aromatization performance. Appropriate Cr amount on catalyst was beneficial to form the highly dispersed Cr3+, which obviously accelerated the propane dehydrogenation and improved BTX selectivity. Excessive Cr loading led to the formation of Cr2O3 and worse dispersion of active Cr3+ species, which could not continue to improve catalytic performance. Among all the Cr modified Ga/Z5 catalysts, 4Cr/GaZ5 exhibited the best catalytic performance with BTX selectivity of 57.5 % and C3H8 conversion of 50.6 %.

Catalyst Synthesis
Preparation of Cr modified Ga/ZSM-5 catalysts with different Cr impregnation sequences
HZSM-5 zeolite with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of 38 was purchased from Nankai University Catalyst Company, China. HZSM-5 zeolite was firstly calcined at 500 °C for 3 h to remove the residual template agent before utilization. All these catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation, and the impregnation process was under the assistance of ultrasonic.
Gallium nitrate hydrate (Ga(NO3)3 ⋅ xH2O, 99.9 %, Aladdin) and chromium nitrate nonahydrate (Cr(NO3)3 ⋅ 9H2O, 99.0 %, Aladdin) were used as Ga and Cr precursors, respectively. The desired content of Ga and Cr was 1 wt % and 2 wt % on catalysts, respectively. Cr was introduced into catalyst via three different impregnation sequences as shown in Scheme 1. For the first catalyst, gallium nitrate solution was first impregnated on HZSM-5, then followed by drying at 110 °C for 12 h and calcination at 550 °C for 5 h, and this sample was denoted as Ga/Z5. Ga/Z5 catalyst was further impregnated with chromium nitrate solution. After drying and calcination, 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst was obtained. For the second catalyst, gallium nitrate and chromium nitrate were dissolved in deionized water to form the aqueous solution of metal precursors, then impregnated on HZSM-5 zeolite. The wet powder was dried at 110 °C for 12 h and calcined at 550 °C for 5 h to obtain the catalyst, which was denoted as 2Cr-Ga/Z5. For the third catalyst, chromium nitrate solution was impregnated on HZSM-5 firstly to prepare 2Cr/Z5. Then followed by drying and calcination, gallium nitrate solution was impregnated on sample. After the same drying and calcination process, Ga/2CrZ5 catalyst was synthesized.

Preparation of xCr/GaZ5 catalysts with different Cr contents
To further study the influence of post-impregnation of Cr on Cr/GaZ5 catalysts for propane aromatization, xCr/GaZ5 catalysts with different contents of Cr loadings (1, 4, 8 wt %) were synthesized. The preparation process was identical with that of 2Cr/GaZ5 catalyst, and the obtained catalysts were denoted as 1Cr/GaZ5, 4Cr/GaZ5, 8Cr/GaZ5, respectively.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of catalysts were collected on a Rigaku D/max 2500 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.1546 nm) at a voltage of 40 kV in the diffraction angle range of 5–80°. Elemental compositions of catalysts were detected by Epsilon type 1 scientific X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometer manufactured in Panax with the Silicon Drift Detector 5. The quantitative standard was the Panac Omnian standard-free analysis program. Textural properties of catalysts were analysed by N2 physical adsorption at −196 °C on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 instrument. Prior to the measurement, all the samples were degassed in vacuum at 300 °C for 5 h to remove the impurities. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurement of all catalysts was conducted on a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer. The binding energy (BE) was calibrated using the referring C 1s at 284.8 eV. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra of the catalyst were measured by an Agilent Cary 5000 spectrometer. BaSO4 was used as the reference and the spectra were recorded in the range of 200–800 nm. STEM images and EDS element mappings were collected on a JOEL 2100F microscope operated at 300 kV. Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) measurement was performed on an automatic chemical adsorption instrument (TP-5080, Tianjin Xianquan Corporation) with a TCD detector. Typically, 0.1 g sample (20–40 meshes) was pretreated at 500 °C under the flowing pure N2 ambient (30 ml ⋅ min−1) for 1 h. After cooled down to 100 °C, the sample was saturated with pure NH3. After removing the physical adsorbed NH3 on the catalyst by N2 flow, NH3-TPD profile was recorded under N2 flow from 100 to 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C ⋅ min−1. In-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra of C3H8 (C3H8-DRIFT) were collected (64 scans, 4 cm−1 resolution) on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer. About 0.02 g catalyst was placed into an in-situ infrared cell. Prior to the measurement, the catalyst was pretreated at 400 °C for 1 h under Ar flow. After that, a flow of propane was fed to the cell for 30 min, during which the IR spectra were recorded. Pyridine infrared spectroscopy was obtained on the same instrument with C3H8-DRIFT experiment. 0.02 g sample was pressured into a wafer and placed into a CaF2 windows pool, then evacuated to 10−3 Pa at 673 K for 1 h to remove impurities. After evacuation, the sample was cooled to 323 K to record the background spectrum. Then pyridine vapor was introduced to the sample for about 30 min. The sample was evacuated at 423 K for 1 h to remove the excessive pyridine and the spectrum was recorded subsequently. C3H8 temperature programmed surface reactions (C3H8-TPSR) were performed on the fixed bed micro-reactor equipped with an on-line mass spectroscopy (Pfeiffer OmniStar). 0.1 g (20–40 meshes) catalyst was pretreated at 500 °C for 1 h under N2 flow. After cooling down to 50 °C, the reactant gas of C3H8/N2 flow was introduced, followed by increasing the temperature from 50 to 600 °C at a rate of 5 °C ⋅ min−1. Meanwhile, the signals of H2, C3H6, C3H8, C6H6, C7H8, C8H10 in the effluent were recorded by the online mass spectrometer.
Catalytic tests
Propane aromatization was carried out on a fixed bed micro-reactor with an internal diameter of 8 mm, and the reaction was carried out at 540 °C under the atmospheric pressure. Typically, 0.5 g catalyst (20–40 meshes) was placed into a quartz tube reactor. Prior to the experiment, the catalyst was heated to 540 °C in a flow of N2 to remove impurities. The mixed gas of C3H8 and N2 with a volume ratio of 1 : 2 was introduced into the reactor at a gas hourly space velocity of 6000 mL ⋅ g−1 ⋅ h−1. The effluent products were analyzed by three gas chromatographs. N2, H2, CH4 were analyzed by an off-line gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimadzu) fitted with a thermal conductive detector (TCD) and a TDX-01 column. The total gaseous hydrocarbon and aromatics were analyzed through an on-line gas chromatograph (GC-9860F, Fanwei) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a DB-FFAP capillary column. Another off-line gas chromatography (GC-2010 Plus, Shimadzu) with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a Al2O3/S capillary column was employed to distinguish all the alkanes and alkenes. The conversion of propane and selectivity of products are calculated as follows [Eqs. (1) and 2]:
