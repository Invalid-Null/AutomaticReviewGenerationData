O2 Activation and Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane on Hexagonal Boron Nitride: Mechanism Revisited
Abstract
Since the first report of the application of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), numerous efforts have been devoted to the exploration of the catalytic mechanism for the rational design of highly active catalysts. The present work focuses on the mechanism of O2 activation and oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) on h-BN by using the density functional theory (DFT). The armchair, boron-atom-terminated zigzag (zig-B), and nitride-atom-terminated zigzag (zig-N) edges were selected as the hypothetical active sites. Computational results show that the dissociative adsorption of O2 is more favorable than the molecular adsorption at all selected sites. For the mechanism of ODHP, our DFT results show that the zig-B edge is the most active site based on kinetic and thermodynamic analysis. In addition, a possible competitive reaction model (C–C bond break vs dehydrogenation) on the high selectivity to propene has been proposed. We propose that h-BN material with rich zig-B edges can enhance the ODHP activity based on the current results. Last, quantum analysis methods, such as electron density difference, charge distributions, and frontier orbitals have also been used to interpret the chemical nature of ODHP reaction.

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) to propene is an important topic in catalysis and chemical industry, owing to aiming the value-added and synthetically useful chemicals and to reduce environmental pollution. (1−4) The scientific challenge of ODHP process remains in the high propane conversion and high propene selectivity. Previous studies showed that the vanadium oxides and cerium oxide catalysts possess the most promising activity for ODHP. (2,4−6) However, the most challenge for those catalysts is the low selectivity to propene because propane is more thermodynamically favored to be oxidized to CO or CO2. Recently, Grant et al. reported that hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is a charming metal-free catalyst for ODHP with catalytic performance comparable to that of commercial vanadium oxide catalysts. (1)
Understanding of the ODHP mechanism is crucial to develop a more efficient catalyst and thus accelerating the process of commercial implementation. The ODHP reaction mechanism on the transition-metal oxides is generally regarded to follow the Mars–Van Krevelen (MvK) redox mechanism. (7,8) Chen et al. proposed that the propane first weakly interacted on the M–O site and then dehydrogenated with the help of lattice O atoms. (9) For the h-BN catalyst, the thermodynamic analysis of ODHP has also been explored. (1,10,11) Grant et al. also suggested that the oxygen species could assist the dehydrogenation step. (1) However, the kinetic behavior does not obey the MvK mechanism. They proposed that the active site for ODHP lies on the armchair edge of h-BN, with molecular adsorption of O2 based on the experimental and thermodynamic results of the density functional theory (DFT) study. In addition, they suggested that the dehydrogenation is initiated by the abstraction of hydrogen atom from a secondary carbon of propane by the B–O–O–N sites, and further it breaks the O–O bond to form a B–OH species and a nitroxyl radical. However, very recently, we noted that Lu et al. argued that the B–OH groups on the BN edge formed by B–O–B sites played the key role in triggering the ODHP. (10,11) They also believed that the dissociative adsorption of molecular oxygen is involved in the ODHP process. These two different mechanisms attract researchers’ interest. We noted that in Grant’s article, only the thermodynamic analysis on the armchair edge was calculated, whereas the activation energies and reaction pathways on the armchair edge and other possible edges were not considered. For example, zig-B and zig-N edges have been proposed to be the active sites in other reactions. (12−15) Here, inspired by the charming catalyst and expecting a deep discussion of the complex mechanism, the chemistry of armchair, zig-B, and zig-N edges of ODHP was revisited and systematically studied by DFT.
The outline of the present work is organized as follows. First, the structures and energetics of O2 molecular and dissociative adsorption on different h-BN edges were calculated to investigate the favorable adsorption sites. Then, the activation free energies, reaction pathways, and the selectivity of ODHP were discussed. In the last, the computational results were further analyzed by graphical quantum methods. Our DFT results show that the zig-B edge is more active than other two edges for ODHP.

2.1. Theory
The M06-2X functional has been shown to provide a broad accuracy for main-group thermochemistry, kinetics, noncovalent interactions, and electronic spectroscopy, which is much better than that of B3LYP. (16) In addition, because the mean-field electronic structure methods like Hartree–Fock, semilocal density functional approximations do not account for long-range electron correlation (London dispersion interaction), Grimme et al. developed a dispersion correction method to enhance the computational accuracy. (17) Hence, in the present work, the Minnesota hybrid metadensity functional with dispersion-corrected term (M06-2X + D3) was chosen as the routine method for exploring the electronic structures of h-BN and the intermediates during ODHP. (17,18) Besides, a triple-ζ basis set with polarized function was selected (6-311G(d,p)) to describe the electronic wave function. All the coordinates were fully optimized and no imaginary frequencies were found for the reactants, intermediates, and products. The transition states (TS) were identified by confirming the orientation of imaginary vibration mode and intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations. The temperature and pressure were set to be 763 K and 1 atm, consistent with the reaction condition.
2.2. Model
The active site for ODHP on the h-BN surface was proposed to be the edge site. (1,10,11) Grant et al. suggested that the active sites could be the armchair edge based on the experimental evidences of O–H vibrational frequencies, catalytic activity, and thermodynamic DFT calculations. However, Lu et al. believed that the zig-B edge is the active sites for ODHP. (10,11) To model the active sites of the h-BN monolayer systematically, three cluster models were selected in this work, including armchair edge, zig-B edge, and zig-N edge, respectively (Figure 1). The left of Figure 1a is the original armchair model without geometry optimization, whereas the right of Figure 1a is the finally used model after geometry optimization results in the reconstruction of the edge sites. Figure 1b,c shows the zig-B and zig-N models. Other edge sites are saturated by hydrogen atoms excepting the active sites.

2.3. Concepts for Discussion
The transitional, rotational, vibrational, and entropy contributions for each structure at the reaction condition were estimated by employing the concept of Gibbs free energy (G). Hence, for an elementary reaction, the change in free energy (ΔG) and activation free energy (ΔGa) were obtained by following formulas
(1)
(2)
where GP and GR are the free energy of the product and the reactant, GTS is the free energy of the transition state. In addition, ΔGa-rds is used to denote the activation free energy for the rate-determination step. The electron density difference (EDD) and the charge distributions analyses were employed to understand the ODHP mechanism. (19) All of the calculations were performed by Gaussian 09 program. (20)

3.1. O2 Activation
The O2 activation is an important topic for oxidative catalysis. In the current work, the molecular and dissociative adsorption for single O2 was first explored as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2a–c illustrates the molecular adsorption (mol-ads) of O2 on the armchair edge (arm-O2), zig-B edge (zig-B-O2), and zig-N edge (zig-N-O2), respectively. However, Figure 2d–f illustrates the dissociative adsorption (dis-ads) of O2 on the above three active sites. The adsorption Gibbs free energies (ΔG) were listed in Table 1. It can be seen that ΔG for the arm-O2 is positive (36.3 kcal/mol), whereas ΔG for zig-B-O2 and zig-N-O2 are −141.2 and −14.1 kcal/mol, respectively. Different from the conclusion proposed by Grant et al., we found that the molecular adsorption of O2 at the armchair edge site will not spontaneously occur from the thermodynamic view. (1) The molecular adsorption of O2 at zig-B edge site is strongly exothermic, whereas the molecular adsorption of O2 at zig-N edge site is a moderate reaction in such condition. It is found that ΔG turns to be more negative on all edges (Table 1), indicating that dissociative adsorption occur more readily. Especially, the dissociative adsorption at zig-B sites leads to an obvious deformation of h-BN and formation of a B–O–B local structure (Figure 2e). These findings were also supported by Lu’s experimental evidences. (10,11)

aUnit: kcal/mol.
In addition, models containing two O2 molecules were also studied for two reasons: one is to study the co-adsorption effect and the other is that Grant et al. suggested the ODHP may involve two O2 molecules (Figure 3). (1)Figure 3a–c displays the molecular adsorption (mol-ads) configurations on armchair, zig-B, and zig-N edges, respectively. Figure 3d,e shows the configurations of the molecular combined dissociative adsorption (mol-dis) of O2 at zig-B and zig-N sites. The structure of the mol-dis adsorption of O2 at armchair sites was not obtained in the current model. Figure 3f–h gives the configurations of the dissociative adsorption (dis-ads) of O2 at zig-B and zig-N sites. It can be seen from Table 1 that ΔG for the molecular adsorption at armchair sites is quite close to single O2 molecular adsorption (36.2 kcal/mol). However, ΔG for the molecular adsorption at zig-B and zig-N sites is more or less double (−284.3 and −39.7 kcal/mol). The O atoms in molecular adsorption may be called “inert O atoms” because they are thermodynamically not favored and have weak bonding capability. It should break the O–O bond first before the oxidative reaction. The dissociative adsorption is still favorable for the three active sites in this model. Hence, the current computational results have shown that the dissociative adsorption of O2 is more favorable than the molecular adsorption at all selected sites, which is consistent with Lu’s argument. (10,11) Besides, the zig-B sites are the most active sites for O2 activation.

3.2. Mechanism of ODHP on h-BN
3.2.1. Optimized Structures
In general, the dehydrogenation of propane may start at two types of H atoms (−CH3 or −CH2−). Previous works have shown that the dehydrogenation on the secondary carbon is the key step for ODHP on transition-metal oxides. (9,21,22) Besides, Grant et al. also suggested that the dehydrogenation starts at the secondary carbon. (1) Hence, in the present work, the starting point of the dehydrogenation is also considered to be the secondary carbon. It was noted that the recent experimental evidence shows the nitrogen atom is inactive for the ODH reaction of alkane. (11,23,24) Hence, the related figures and results on the zig-N edge site were placed in the Supporting Information. The transition states (TS) for the ODHP reaction were optimized based on two O2 molecules adsorption structures (Figure 4) as suggested by Grant et al. (1)Figures 4a,b and S1g illustrate the transition structures (TS1–TS3) of the first dehydrogenation step on armchair, zig-B, and zig-N edges in which the initial guess for the O2 species was the molecular adsorption states (mol-ads). It is found that only on the armchair edge the O2 species remain the molecular adsorption states after dehydrogenation, whereas on the zig-B and zig-N edge, one of the O2 molecule turns into dissociative adsorption state. The reactive C–H and O–H bond lengths of TS1 are 1.389 and 1.213 Å, respectively (Table 2). In TS2, the reactive C–H and O–H bond lengths are 1.166 and 1.478 Å. It can be known that the C–H bond length in the TS2 becomes shorter, whereas the O–H bond length becomes longer, which is opposite to TS1. Generally speaking, the reactive bond length is related to the bond strength in the TS; the stronger the bond strength, the longer is the bond length in its TS. This is also called “late” TS or “early” TS. (25) Hence, the longer length of O–H in TS2 means a more active state of the B–O species as compared with TS1. Figures 4c,d and S1h illustrate the transition structures (TS4–TS6) of the first dehydrogenation step on the armchair, zig-B, and zig-N edges in which the initial speculation for the O2 species was the dissociative adsorption states (dis-ads). The reactive C–H and O–H bond lengths for these TSs are similar to TS1–TS3 (Table 2). Figures 4e–g and S1i (TS7–TS9) show the transition structures of the second dehydrogenation step on the armchair, zig-B, and zig-N edges. It is noted that TS7 (Figure 4e) was based on the molecular adsorption state, whereas TS7a was based on the dissociative adsorption state on the armchair edge. The structures of these two TSs are quite different.

Figures 5 and S1a–f display the intermediate structures during ODHP reaction. Figures 5a,b and S1c are the intermediates for the first dehydrogenation step on the armchair, zig-B, and zig-N edges. The hydrogen atom is the preferred bonding to the O atom for all situations. The CH3–CH*–CH3 (isopropyl) radical is bonded to the O atom on the zig-B edge, whereas it is bonded to the B atom on armchair edge. The reason is that the O atom on the armchair edge is the molecular state, preventing the formation of the C–O bond. Figures 5c,d and S1e are the intermediates for the second dehydrogenation step on the armchair, zig-B, and zig-N edges. The CH2*–CH*–CH3 radical is bridged bonding to the O atoms on all of the situations. However, Figures 5e,f and S1f are the desorption structures for propene. These weak interactions can be classified into typical π–π interactions, as referring to our previous works. (26−28)

3.2.2. Activation Free Energies and Favorable Reaction Pathways
The activation free energies (ΔGa) and favorable reaction pathways are the important topics in the present work. All of the ΔGa values and reaction pathways of the three models are plotted in Figure 6 (armchair edge and zig-B edge model) and Figure S2 (zig-N edge model). The reference state for all the reaction pathways is the gas phase O2(g) + C3H8(g).
Figure 6
Figure 6. Free energy profile of ODHP reaction pathways on armchair, zig-B, and zig-N edge models at 763 K (unit: kcal/mol).
In Figure 6, as mentioned above, TS1 corresponds to the transition state of the first dehydrogenation step based on the molecular adsorption state of O2. The relative free energy of TS1 is 116.1 kcal/mol, which means that ΔGa is 79.9 kcal/mol for this elementary reaction. The relative free energy of the first intermediate, namely, IM-arm-1 is 60.6 kcal/mol, which indicates that it is an endothermic reaction (ΔG = 24.4 kcal/mol). Then, the IM-arm-1 can readily dehydrogenate into IM-arm-2 (relative free energy is −58.9 kcal/mol) via TS7. Besides, there is another reaction pathway starting from the dissociative adsorption state of O2 (−41.1 kcal/mol). Then, the first dehydrogenation step proceeds via TS4 (ΔGa = 45.7 kcal/mol). The relative free energy of TS4 is 4.6 kcal/mol, indicating this pathway is more reactive than TS1. IM-arm-1a, an important intermediate for the formation of propyl radical, is obtained via TS1 (ΔG = −23.1 kcal/mol), which is an exothermic reaction. The stabilization of the propyl radical was suggested to be the key point for the high propene selectivity and suppression of overoxidation. (1) IM-arm-2 can be also formed by further hydrogenation via TS7a (ΔGa = 49.2 kcal/mol). IM-arm-2 (Figure 5c) is a precursor for the desorption state of propene, namely, IM-arm-3 (Figure 5e). This elementary reaction goes through two C–O bond breaks and possesses the highest activation free energy (ΔGa-rds = 53.1 kcal/mol) along the reaction pathway (via TS4 and TS7a). Then, the product can be readily desorbed from the BN surface (ΔG = −13.1 kcal/mol). In summary, the results and discussions of ODHP on the armchair edge show that the dissociation adsorption state of O2 is superior to that of molecular adsorption state in terms of kinetics and thermodynamics.
In Figure 6, we creatively plotted the ODHP reaction pathways on the zig-B and armchair edge together on the h-BN surface. On the zig-B edge (blue lines), after the adsorption of O2, the starting point of ODHP is located at a relatively low energy level. The mol-dis adsorption O2 configuration can form IM-zig-B-1a through TS2 (ΔGa = 28.8 kcal/mol), whereas the dissociative adsorption O2 configuration can form IM-zig-B-1 through TS5 with a relatively high activation free energy (ΔGa = 84.5 kcal/mol). For the above two elementary reactions, the isopropyl radical is consequently rapidly combined with the B–O site, which is consistent with the radical rebound mechanism. (1) Besides, IM-zig-B-1 and IM-zig-B-1a are relatively stable along the reaction pathway and more stable as compared with other two edge models. Grant et al. suggested that the prevention of the highly reactive propyl radical is the key point to understand the high propene selectivity and suppression of overoxidation. (1) Here, we suggest that the high stability of the above complexes formed by isopropyl radical may be related to the high selectivity of propene. Then, these two intermediate can further dehydrogenate into IM-zig-B-2 via TS8 (ΔGa = 65.2 kcal/mol). IM-zig-B-2 is a precursor for the desorption state of propene, namely, IM-zig-B-3 (Figure 5f), which is the most stable species in the current system. Similar to IM-arm-3, this elementary reaction goes through a two C–O bond break and possesses the highest activation free energy (ΔGa-rds = 98.2 kcal/mol). Finally, IM-zig-B-3 can readily desorb to form propene and zig-B-2OH that contains two B–OH groups, which was ever proved to be the key intermediates in triggering the ODHP process. (10,11)
The activation free energies for each dehydrogenation step on different models are further listed in Table 3. Based on the above results, it can be known that on the armchair edge, the energy level of the ODHP reaction proceeds nearly at the entry level (0.0 kcal/mol, Figure 6). The potential energy well is relative shallow as compared with other models, although the activation free energy for rate determination step is moderate. On the zig-B edge, the energy level of the ODHP reaction is the lowest, indicating that it holds the strongest driving force for the dehydrogenation steps, although ΔGa-rds is the highest among all the hypothetical active sites. Hence, it would be the most favorable reaction pathway. On the zig-N edge, the energy level of the ODHP reaction is moderate and ΔGa-rds is the lowest, showing that it is more favorable than on the armchair edge. It was noted that Grant’s theoretical model was mainly based on the experimental and theoretical vibrational frequencies of the −OH group. (1) The infrared spectra would not be contrary to our mechanism because various kinds of OH groups may coexist on different edges. Lu et al. proposed a mechanism that started at B–OH groups and then the active B–O–O–B sites were formed by the flow of O2 based on a B–O–B zigzag edge. Our results prove that the B–O–O–B sites are indeed the active sites. (10,11) In our model, the formation of B–O–B site can also possibly exist through the reconstruction of the zig-B edge (zig-B-2O and zig-B-4O). However, the O atom in the B–O–B site is not active because it has no extra bonding ability. When the dehydrogenation step is started, the B–O–B species turn back to the original zig-B structure (zig-B-2O or zig-B-4O).

3.2.3. Rate Constants
To further confirm the current results, a simple reaction rate model based on Boltzmann distribution and transition state theory under steady-state approximation was established. The relative concentration of each species is obtained by Boltzmann distribution as follows
(3)
where Ci means the relative concentration of a given species before the rate-determination step and Gref,i means the relative free energy of each species. The relative reaction rate is obtained by Ci multiplying the Eyring equation
(4)
where ri means the relative rate constant for each elementary reaction. kB is the Boltzmann constant and h is the Planck constant. The calculated results are listed in Table 4. It can be seen that the predicted relative reaction rates agree well with the results from the free energy profile analysis. The relative reaction rates for the dehydrogenation steps and desorption are all fastest on the zig-B edge, whereas the values on the arm edge are the smallest. The relative reaction rates on the zig-N edge are moderate among the three active sites. In our previous work, we proposed that the zig-N edge was the active sites for oxidative desulfurization on the BN surface due to its comparable reaction heat. (12) This is not contrary to the current conclusion because oxidative desulfurization is an oxygen-transfer reaction, which should break its B–O bond. Hence, the break of strong B–O bond makes the oxidative step difficult to occur. The current reaction is a dehydrogenation reaction. And, the B–O bond is gradually and readily hydrogenated to B–OH, B–OH2, leading to a breakage of B–O bond at high temperature. The activation free energy for the formation of B···OH2 intermediate was calculated to be only 6.8 kcal/mol on the zig-B edge. In summary, our calculations prove that the zig-B edge plays an important role in the ODHP reaction.

aThe relative concentration of IM-zig-B-2 was set to be 1.00E+00 as the standard because it is the most stable intermediate.
3.3. Possible Mechanism of High Selectivity to Propene
The key scientific challenge for ODHP is the prevention of facile overoxidation of propene product into more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2. (1) Grant et al. proposed a radical rebound mechanism to interpret the selectivity. They believe that the one-dimensional nature of the h-BN edges avoids the creation of a highly reactive propyl radical, and the overoxidation of the adsorbed species is thus suppressed. We also believe that this is the chemical origin of the high selectivity to propene due to the high stability of isopropyl radical. Here, we try to make further discussion about the selectivity. In principle, the key point to the high selectivity to propene and low selectivity to CO and CO2 lies in the competition of C–C bond break, degree of dehydrogenation, and desorption of propene (Scheme 1).
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Selectivity Route for ODHP on Zig-B Edge
The above scheme starts with isopropyl radicals rather than propane because it is difficult to break the C–C bonds directly from propane. (22) Hence, the first competitive reactions are the second dehydrogenation and the C–C bond break. The activation free energies and free energy changes for the C–C bond break at the zig-B edge were calculated (Figure S3). It can be seen that the C–C bond break is not preferred from both kinetic and thermodynamic aspects. Hence, this chemical activity feature may be important to selectivity. Further, the second competitive reactions are the desorption of propene and C–C bond break of propene. We propose that the C–C bond break should not occur because the products are both diradicals, which will be recombined quickly in the reaction condition. Lastly, the desorption of propene is a spontaneous reaction (ΔG = −16.9 kcal/mol), which is beneficial for desorption. However, the high selectivity to propene and low selectivity to CO and CO2 maybe very complicated. We hope this discussion can offer some useful information on the selectivity.
3.4. Quantum Analysis on the ODHP Reaction
3.4.1. Electron Density Difference
The electron density difference (EDD) analysis is a useful method to estimate the density change of systems of interest. (29−31)Figure 7a–c plots the EDD map of the dissociative adsorption species, namely, arm-4O, zig-B-4O, and zig-N-4O with the help of Multiwfn program. (32) The EDD maps were obtained by differentiating the final density after adsorption and initial density when O atoms are not bonding to B or N atoms. The purple areas in Figure 7 mean the increase in electron density, whereas the green areas mean the decrease in electron density. It can be seen that the electron density of O atoms increases in arm-4O. The electron density mainly deceases between N–O bonding areas. Similarly, in Figure 7b,c the electron densities of O atoms are increased. All the figures have shown that there is a charge transfer from BN to O atoms during O2 activation and dehydrogenation reactions. Besides, the EDD maps of TS4, TS5, and TS6 for the first dehydrogenation step are plotted in Figure 7d–f. The EDD results have also shown a charge transfer from the C–H bond to the reactive O atom.

3.4.2. Charge Distributions
To quantitatively obtain the information on charge transfer and interpret the activation free energies during the dehydrogenation, the natural population analysis (NPA) was implemented by natural bond orbital scheme. The NPA atomic charges in O2, C3H8, and above-mentioned species are listed in Table S1. It should be noted that only the charges of related reactive atoms are listed. From Table S1, we can know that the initial charges of O, H, and C atoms are 0.000, 0.188, and −0.375, respectively. After dissociative adsorption, the charges of reactive O atoms in the three species are −0.109, −0.855, and −0.209, respectively, which shows a charge transfer from BN to the O atom, well in agreement with the results discussed in the EDD map. In TS4 and TS6, it is found that the negative charge of O atom increases. However, the negative charge of O atom in TS5 decreases. The electron-rich state of O atom in zig-B-4O may be related to the higher activation free energy for ODHP (Table 3).
3.4.3. Frontier Orbitals
To further understand the reactivity of ODHP, the frontier orbitals of propane and the dissociative adsorption configurations mentioned above were plotted (Figure S4). As shown in Figure S4, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of propane mainly consists of the C–H σ bonds, whereas the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital mainly consists of anti-σ bonds. For the dissociative adsorption configurations, it is found that the frontier orbitals are mainly located near the O atoms, except the HOMO of zig-B edge, which can be used to interpret the relative higher activation free energies for the dehydrogenation reactions.
4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The mechanism of O2 activation and ODHP on the three edge models of h-BN has been systematic explored by DFT. Computational results have shown that the dissociative adsorption of O2 is favorable than the molecular adsorption at all active sites. Besides, the zig-B edges are the most active sites for O2 activation due to the strong exothermic behavior. For the mechanism of ODHP, our DFT results show that the zig-B edge is more active site than the zig-N or armchair edges based on kinetic and thermodynamic analyses. The kinetic and thermodynamic advantages of the dehydrogenation reaction as compared to the C–C bond break could be the main reason for the high selectivity to propene. On the basis of the current results, we propose that h-BN material with a rich B zigzag edges can enhance the ODHP activity. And, we hope this new understanding will help to develop new and efficient ODHP catalysts.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
