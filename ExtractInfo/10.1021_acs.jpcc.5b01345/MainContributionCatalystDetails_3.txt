The given document discusses carbon tolerance and electrochemical performance of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) with different anode compositions when exposed to methane. It does not mention propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The catalysts explored are related to Ni-YSZ cermet anodes doped with Sn or BaO, and not for converting propane to propylene. Therefore, this document does not seem directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation.
