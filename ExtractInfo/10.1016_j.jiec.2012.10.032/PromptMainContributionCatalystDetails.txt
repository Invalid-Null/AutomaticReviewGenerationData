The joint reaction of methanol and i-butane over the HZSM-5 zeolite
Abstract
The effects of i-butane addition to methanol in MTP reaction were investigated over an in-house prepared HZSM-5 catalyst. It was observed that, propylene yield would be enhanced when i-butane fed to the reactor along with methanol. The rising growth of the propylene yield continued to peak on till the balance in thermal condition established. Similar trends have been observed when water was added to the mixture. The effect of WHSV with fixed water composition on product distribution was also studied. The optimum point where the highest amount of propylene yielded was shown to be high depended upon the temperature and residence time.
1. Introduction
Light olefins have been largely utilized as the starting materials to produce various chemicals in the petrochemical industry. The primary sources for the propylene included; a by-product of ethylene production in steam crackers and refineries’ FCC streams [1], [2], [3]. At present, need for propylene due to increased applications continues to outpace ethylene's production worldwide. In other words, the two aforementioned processes in which propylene is the by-product of are unable to meet the market demand. This has led researchers to focus attentions towards the “on-purpose” propylene production in both petrochemical and refinery facilities [4], [5]. Amongst the on-purpose processes including; propane dehydrogenation (PDH), methanol-to-olefin (MTO) and methanol-to-propylene (MTP) processes, the MTP might be the most practical route to fill up the growing gap between the supply and the demand. Since physical and chemical properties of zeolite catalysts and operating conditions greatly affect the product distributions, numerous studies performed to improve selectivity to light olefins [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12].
The interesting coupled methanol hydrocarbon (CMHC) process which is the simultaneous combination of the exothermic conversion of methanol to olefins and endothermic cracking of hydrocarbons over the HZSM-5 was previously studied by Martin et al. [13], [14], [15]. Since the catalytic conversion of the light linear alkanes to more useful compounds encounters more difficulties and limitations in comparison with other petrochemical and refinery processes because of their lower reactivities; these alkane materials are regarded as those of secondary interest. However, the availability of methanol combined with the environmental and economic attractiveness of the production route for this compound through the biogas renders the integrated process as an effective alternative for the purpose at hand. Consequently, this route improves both individual reactions of the MTP (methanol to propylene) and PTO (paraffin to olefins) [16], [17]. Recently, Mier et al. have studied the Co-feeding of methanol and n-butane (i.e., with methanol/n-butane molar ratio of 3) over the HZSM-5 catalyst [18], [19], [20], [21]. They found several advantages to such integrations, making it a promising route to improve MTO processes. These advantages included: (i) performing the integrated process under energy-neutral conditions by selecting the proper methanol/n-butane molar ratio, (ii) mitigating the stages of thermal decomposition of methanol leading to unwanted products such as methane, CO and CO2, (iii) reducing catalyst deactivation by coke and (iv) performing the joint transformation with higher values of time on stream. These compared with the methanol transformation alone resulted in higher selectivity toward the C2–C4 olefins.
It is reminded that, in every joint transformation containing two or more components in a mixture, the whole characteristics of individual reaction for each reactant should be completely realized in order to obtain the best possible results from the coupled reaction. The results from previous work of these authors [22] in which n- and i-butane cracked over an HZSM-5 catalyst prepared in-house with SiO2/Al2O3 = 484 under different operating conditions indicated that due to the low acidity of the catalyst synthesized: (i) a very low deactivation rate, (ii) high selectivity toward light olefins especially propylene and (iii) lower amounts of heavy products were obtained. The light olefins production in i-butane cracking was even higher than that obtained for n-butane. Moreover, results of that study showed lower paraffin selectivity.
The goal of the present study was to investigate the improvement of the propylene selectivity for the MTP process with respect to the effects of co-feeding of i-butane and methanol over an in-house prepared high Si/Al ratio HZSM-5 zeolite. In particular, the effect of such different operating conditions such as variations of methanol to i-butane molar ratio and temperature as well as; the water addition to the feed mixture were undertaken. The obtained results indicated considerable improvement in propylene yield while the rate of the deactivation of the catalyst remained quite low even under severe operating conditions. In addition, effect of water addition to the feed mixture was probed and was found to be very promising.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The HZSM-5 zeolite with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio = 484 was synthesized by the following method [25]. 0.311 g of NaAlO2 was partially dissolved in 433.6 ml of 0.215 N sodium hydroxide by vigorous stirring. To this 41.078 g of TPAOH (tetra-n-propyl-ammonium hydroxide, 40 vol%, Merck) was slowly added as a template. Then, 54.060 g silicic acid (SiO2·0.5H2O) was added to the above mixture under vigorous stirring at about 500 rpm. After about 60 min of stirring, the pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to about 10 using 98% sulfuric acid addition (about 5 g). Resulting mixture had the following molar composition: 0.775 of SiO2, 0.002 of Al2O3, 0.048 of Na2O, 0.081 of (CH3CH2CH2)4NOH and 25.854 of H2O. The mixture was placed in a PTFE lined vessel and heated at 105 °C, at atmospheric pressure for 12 days under reflux with stirring at 100 rpm. The resultant solid product was cooled to room temperature, removed, and washed with 30 l H2O. The product was then dried overnight at 105 °C. A portion of this product was subjected to X-ray analysis and identified as ZSM-5 phase. The product was then calcined in air at 550 °C for 10 h. Ion exchange was carried out four times with 1 M NH4NO3 solution at 90 °C for 4 h, followed by calcination at 550 °C in air for 6 h to give H-form products. The zeolite powder was pressed under a high pressure piston for 10 min and then crushed and sieved to a particle diameter between 0.3 and 0.4 mm.
2.2. Catalyst techniques and characterization
Structure of the synthesized material was confirmed to be ZSM-5 zeolite by the XRD (Fig. 1). The BET surface area was measured using the N2 adsorption method (Quantachrome, USA). Prior to the adsorption–desorption measurements, 0.533 g of fresh zeolite sample was degassed at 300 °C under N2 flow for 2 h.

The acidity of the sample and the concentration of acid sites on the catalyst surface were measured by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD, Micromeritics, USA), equipped with an on-line thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The Si/Al ratio of zeolite crystal was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) with a VGESCALAB 220iXL spectrometer employing an Mg Kα X-ray source (1253.6 eV). The physicochemical properties of the zeolite under investigation were presented in Table 1.

2.3. Catalytic tests
The joint transformation of methanol and i-butane to olefins was carried out in a lab-scale reactor unit equipped with a 10-mm inner diameter stainless-steel reactor. Appropriate amount of catalyst was crushed and sieved (mesh size: 355–425 μm) diluted with quartz and loaded into the reactor. The reactor was heated electrically and the catalyst bed was inserted into the middle of the furnace. In order to homogenize the reactant stream and regulate the gas flow, inert quartz particles were filled upstream and downstream of the catalyst packing of the reactor. The reaction temperature maintained at the desired temperature by controlling the internal temperature of the reactor using a TIC and three K-type thermocouples equipped in the furnace. The monitoring of the temperature of the catalyst bed was performed utilizing a TI and two K-type thermocouples. Product samples were withdrawn periodically at regular intervals from the outlet of the reactor for online gas chromatography analysis. Possible heavy products were separated using a condenser and decanter and transferred the products for on-line GC analysis. For each run, the first sample was analyzed 2 h after the reactant was introduced into the reactor.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Coupled methanol and i-butane reaction
Products selectivity calculated according to the following equation:
(1)
in which Fi and Fo represented the number of moles of the component i at the inlet and outlet streams, respectively. In addition, ni is the number of carbon atoms of component i.
The Si/Al ratio was a determining factor in the MTP process since it largely influenced the product distribution especially for propylene and aromatics productions [9]. The high ratio selected was in order to notably suppress the aromatization yield and enhance the propylene yield and propylene to ethylene ratio in the MTP reaction as well. Similar trend was also obtained for i-butane cracking [22]. Although the acidity of zeolite catalyst which finally determines the cracking strength of the samples for paraffin reactions was noticeably lower than required, the low acidity (high Si/Al ratio) is absolutely a preferable parameter in MTP reaction and since MTP reaction plays a more serious role compared to paraffin reaction (cracking) in CMHC process, this integral factor was adjusted so that the highest amount of light olefins (specially propylene) can be obtained.
Two cases probed in the present research. In the first one, pure methanol was introduced along with i-butane into the reactor and in the next, mixture of water and methanol in equal mass proportions was considered. The term WHSV (i.e., weight hourly space velocity) was defined as the mass flow rate of methanol or methanol and water (when water is present) over the total mass of catalyst:

Fig. 3a indicates variation of propylene, ethylene and heavy products yield versus methanol to i-butane molar ratio at 470 °C. This temperature value of T = 470 °C was chosen since it resulted in the highest yields toward light olefins production especially propylene in the individual reaction of MTP. In this condition, WHSV for methanol was adjusted to 1 h−1 and methanol conversion was 100%. Based upon the desired methanol to i-butane molar ratio and mass of the catalyst loaded in the reactor, i-butane flow rate was determined. On the other word, via loading a constant catalyst amount and adjusting the WHSV = 1, methanol inlet flow rate was kept constant and i-butane flow rate varied according to the specified ratio. As indicated by Fig. 3a, increasing i-butane flow rate while holding the methanol flow rate constant resulted in higher yields for propylene and ethylene. It must be noted that this trend has a peak around ratio = 3 and the same observation might have been seen for the other components. The methanol to i-butane ratio determined the thermal condition of the feed since methanol transformation was exothermic contrary to paraffin cracking. The heat released during the methanol reaction largely enhanced endothermic reaction of i-butane cracking until energy-neutral condition prevailed. The peak corresponding to this condition and therefore the yield of light olefins slightly decreased as the ratio reduced since as a result of higher ratio, higher amount of energy may be released that results in higher catalyst bed temperature and negative effect for propylene production in MTP reaction.

3.2. Influence of water
Water played an important role in the MTO process since it largely reduced the deactivation rate due to coke deposition and also increase the selectivity to light olefins [26], [27], [28], [29]. Indeed, the water reduces the methanol and i-butane partial pressure in the reactor and improved the reaction conditions toward the propylene production. Fig. 3b represents the effect of addition of water to the mixture of methanol and i-butane. The water was mixed with methanol in order to set the WHSV = 1 h−1 and then introduced into the reactor along with different methanol to i-butane ratios. The results indicated considerable enhancement in light olefin productions as well as; remarkably reduced the amount of light paraffin formed during the reaction. Similarly, the peak occurred in molar methanol/i-butane = 3.
It must be noted that high acidity (i.e., low Si/Al ratio) zeolite might have resulted in high paraffin feed conversion. However, this factor displayed a reverse effect upon the selectivity of desired products compared with this study's Si/Al ratio. In other words, high Si/Al ratio highly improved mono-molecular in comparison to bi-molecular mechanism and considerably affected the product distribution in i-butane cracking and eventually integrated process [22], [23], [24], [25], [26].
The effect of methanol WHSV on product distribution at different temperatures was also investigated. Fig. 4a–c demonstrates light olefins and paraffin yields with space velocity at different temperatures. The optimum result from previous section was applied with a mixture containing 50 wt.% methanol in water and molar methanol/i-butane = 3 as the reactor feed. As shown, a peak appeared for propylene indicating an optimum condition under which highest yield values were obtained. This peak changed with temperature and the highest value corresponded to 500 °C. The behavior for ethylene was relatively similar to propylene at 470 and 500 °C but a different trend was observed at 530 °C with a constant decrease in yield values. It might be initially inferred from the comparison between Fig. 4b and c that i-butane cracking and selectivity toward light olefins increased with rising temperatures and hence higher light olefins production was expected. However, this conclusion is contrary to what was observed in this study. This may be attributed to higher methanol decomposition to CO and H2 at 530 °C. Nonetheless, the amount of light paraffins (i.e., ethane, propane, n-butane as well as n- and i-pentane) production decreased as the temperature rose. Furthermore, the trend of variation of the light paraffin yield with space velocity was similar to that of the temperature, that is, it decreased as the space velocity increased.

The evolution of feed conversion, selectivity of propylene and heavy components with time on stream at 470 °C are illustrated in Fig. 5a and b for both pure methanol and co-feeding of equal mass ratio of methanol/water mixture with i-butane. Here the WHSV was 1 h−1 for both methanol and water in methanol/i-butane molar ratio = 3 during a 40 h run. It has been generally accepted that the deactivation of zeolite catalysts in the MTO reaction mainly originated from the coke deposition over the surface of the catalyst [30]. As mentioned previously, due to the low acid strengths at the centers, the rate of the deactivation of the catalyst was quite low for both cases studied here and even lower for the integrated process. Moreover, this was accurately confirmed by a carbon balance around the reactor utilizing a calibrated scale for calculating the water/methanol mixture weight reduction during the tests, a gas counter measuring the accumulated outlet gas volume and inlet flowmeter for inlet gas feeds. This slight lower deactivation in the integrated process was probably due to the favorable effect of a higher amount of light olefins (i.e., i-butane cracking products) on the mechanism of olefin formation [19], [31].

4. Conclusions
The coupled transformation of methanol and i-butane involved interesting features including distinct improvement in propylene while reduction in light paraffins yields. The experiments for different methanol to i-butane molar ratios at 470 °C showed an optimum under the ratio = 3. Since methanol transformation was an exothermic reaction, co-feeding of i-butane with methanol might have compensated for the acid strengths and reduced temperature associated with the endothermic individual i-butane cracking reaction. Furthermore, when different methanol to i-butane ratio fed with water in equal mass methanol to water ratio, a considerable propylene enhancement was obtained. The peak corresponding to the highest propylene yield might have been obtained in the molar methanol/i-butane ratio = 3. These points completely changed with temperature and also methanol space velocity. Because of the high Si/Al ratio utilized in this study the evolution of product distribution and methanol conversion remained relatively constant during a long run for the integrated process.
