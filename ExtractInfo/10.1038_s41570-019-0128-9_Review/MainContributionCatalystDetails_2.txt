The given document does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. Though it discusses oxidative dehydrogenation of some light alkanes like ethane, propane and butane using CO2, the focus is not specifically on converting propane to propylene. The document mainly examines catalysts for converting CO2 and light alkanes to alkenes and CO. Since propane dehydrogenation is not a central focus, I have indicated that the document is not relevant.
