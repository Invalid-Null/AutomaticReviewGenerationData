 Unfortunately, the provided documents do not seem to contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation research. All the documents focus on oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane using CO2 as an oxidant, and do not mention propane dehydrogenation specifically. Since there are no multiple extractions from the same document related to propane dehydrogenation, I cannot provide an integrated summary in the requested XML format.
