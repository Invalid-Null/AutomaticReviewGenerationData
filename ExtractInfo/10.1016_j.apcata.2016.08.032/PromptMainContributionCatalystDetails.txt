1. Introduction
Increasing demand for ethene (C2H4) derivatives such as polyethene, ethene oxide, ethylbenzene and many more has made ethene one of the main chemical feedstocks in the chemical industry [1], [2]. Conventionally, ethene is made by naphtha and ethane (C2H6) cracking, both energy intensive processes that promote high rate of coke deposition, a continuous operation hurdle, apart from high CO2 emission [3], [4]. Recently, ethane cracking has significantly picked up the pace, due to current growth in discoveries of natural gas, especially shale gas in the US, making it a cheap feed for ethene production [5]. The aforementioned inherent problems of these processes can be tackled by developing a relatively low temperature catalytic process. Oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) [6] takes place at lower temperatures where oxidants such as oxygen [7], carbon dioxide [8] and nitrous oxide [9] are utilized. However, O2 results in an exothermic reaction requiring efficient heat removal and it also easily oxidizes ethane, whereas utilizing N2O in large scale, is rather challenging due to its limited availability. Therefore, CO2, a greenhouse gas, comes as an obvious choice due to its high availability and relatively low cost [10].
Studies on ODHE employing CO2 have been reported over Cr2O3- [11], [12] and Ga2O3-based [13], [14], [15] catalysts, where the former showed superior activity. However, the use of Cr2O3 is problematic due to toxicity issues while Ga2O3 is relatively expensive and shows severe sintering and coking. The latter metal oxide has been reported to exhibit higher activity compared to that of the former [16]. But when supported on generic supports (e.g. Al2O3, SiO2 etc) [8], [17], the observed activity was reversed, i.e. the Cr-based catalyst was superior. One of the issues that crippled the performance of Ga3O3-based catalyst is high rate of coke deposition resulting in gradual and early deactivation [17], requiring frequent regeneration [13]. By tuning the acidity and basicity of the catalyst, to some extent, the coke deposition has been minimized [15], however, the necessity of catalyst regeneration seemed to be inevitable. The reported initial ethane conversion and ethene selectivity over Ga2O3-based catalysts are in the range of 20–30% and 80–90%, respectively, which gradually decrease, primarily ethane conversion, with time [17], [18]. In contrast, relatively high and stable ethane conversion of around 50% and ethene selectivity of >90% were obtained over SiO2-supported Cr2O3 compared to that of other supported catalysts (e.g. Al2O3, TiO2, and ZrO2) [8]. The observed high activity was attributed to the redox property and acidity/basicity of the Cr2O3/SiO2. Some improvement on the Cr2O3/SiO2 activity has been achieved by addition of acidic and basic oxide promoters [19].
Cobalt oxide based catalysts are attractive for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane [20], [21], [22], propane [23], [24] and isobutene [25] using O2 and also for dry reforming of methane [26], [27]. Li et al. [28] used 3%Co-MCM-41 with CO2 as oxidant and reported ethane conversion of about 40% with a selectivity of 99%. Zhang et al. [29] found 7% Co loading on BaCO3 to be optimal with a very stable (>5 h) ethane conversion of 48% at a C2H4 selectivity of 92%. The high activity and the stable performance was attributed to the redox property of CoOx as well as synergism between BaCO3 and BaCoO3.
The support characteristics have major influence on the performance in ODHE, as has been shown for Cr2O3- [8] and Ga2O3-based [17] catalysts. To our knowledge, there exists no systematic study of the catalytic performance of single and mixed oxide supported cobalt catalysts on CO2-assisted ODHE. With this in mind, we investigated the influence of single and mixed-oxide supports on the performance of Co-based ODHE catalysts. A scalable single-step flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) method was used for their preparation [30]. This synthesis technique is flexible, easily operable and offers high possibility of metastable phase formation due to which rapid growth in its utilization for catalyst synthesis is observed in recent years [31].
In this comparative study we report the physicochemical properties of flame-made single and mixed-oxide supported Co catalysts and their performance in ODHE using CO2 as a mild oxidant. The physicochemical properties of the catalysts were analyzed by nitrogen adsorption, XRD, HR-TEM, EDXS, NH3-TPD, TPR, DRIFTS, XPS and Raman- and UV–vis spectroscopy and crucial properties for optimal catalytic performance were identified.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
All catalysts were made by FSP [13]. Briefly, precursor solutions were prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of metal-precursors in toluene (Sigma Aldrich), except for catalysts containing (a) Al2O3, where diethylene glycol monobutyl ether (Sigma–Aldrich) and acetic anhydride (Sigma-Aldrich) (vol. ratio of 2:1) and (b) ZrO2, where a mixture of toluene, 2-ethylhexanoate (Sigma-Aldrich, purity >99%) and acetonitrile (Sigma-Aldrich, purity >99.5%) at vol. ratio of 3:1:1 were used. All the metal precursors, cobalt (III) acetylacetonate (98%), hexamethyldisiloxane (≥98%), titanium iso-propoxide (>97% purity) and aluminum tri-sec-butoxide (97% purity) from Sigma-Aldrich and zirconium 2-ethylhexanoate (∼6% Zr) from Strem chemicals, were used as received. The total molar concentration of metal (i.e. Co + metal in support(s)) was set to 0.45 M except for Zr-containing catalysts where the molarity was set to 0.31 M due to solubility limitation. When preparing mixed-oxide supports, both oxides were of equivalent weight (i.e. 1:1 ratio of 95.5 wt%). The cobalt content was always 4.5 wt%. During FSP, the precursor solution was pumped at 5 mL/min into the flame reactor nozzle using a syringe pump (Lambda, VIT-FIT). The feed was dispersed into fine droplets by co-flowed O2 of 5 L/min (>99.9% PanGas) and immediately ignited by a pilot flame fed by CH4/O2 of 1/2 L/min (>99.9% PanGas). The pressure drop at the nozzle-tip was maintained at 2 bar. Product powders were collected on glass fiber filter (ALBET GF 6, 25.7 cm in diameter) with the aid of a vacuum pump (Busch, Seco SV 1040C). All gas flow rates were regulated by mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst).
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffractograms were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer (40 kV, 20 mA, Cu Kα) over the 2θ range of 10–70° with a step size of 0.019° and scan speed of 0.1 s/step. Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured on a Micromeritics Tristar instrument and the specific surface area (SSA) of both fresh and spent catalyst powders was determined by applying the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method at 77 K. All samples were kept at 150 °C in N2-atmosphere for 1 h prior to measurements.
Micromeritics Autochem 2920 was used for H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD). For all measurements, a sample mass of ca. 100 mg, a temperature ramp rate of 10 °C/min and total gas flow rate of 20 mL/min were applied. The NH3-TPD was performed by heating the sample from room temperature to 400 °C in 5% O2 in He and maintaining it at this temperature for 2 h before cooling down to 50 °C in helium. Then, the gas flow was switched to 10% NH3 in Ar, which was passed over the sample for 90 min. Temperature was increased to 100 °C and the gas flow switched back to helium to remove physisorbed NH3 from the surface of the sample. Finally, the temperature was ramped to 840 °C and the desorbed NH3 was monitored by a mass spectrometer (m/z = 15). For H2-TPR measurements, the samples were heated from room temperature to 200 °C in helium and held at this temperature for 2 h before cooling down to 50 °C. Then the gas flow was switched to 5%H2/Ar before ramping to 840 °C. The H2-consumption was monitored by a mass spectrometer (m/z = 2).
Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) of all fresh catalysts was performed on a Vertex 70 v spectrometer (Bruker Optics). The powder samples were placed in an in-situ DRIFTS cell that was heated to 400 °C in 5%O2 in He at 20 mL/min and held at this temperature for 30 min. After cooling down to 40 °C in helium at 20 mL/min, background (sample + KBr) was taken and then the gas was switched to 10% NH3/Ar, which was passed over the sample for 15 min. Afterward the weakly adsorbed NH3 was flushed by helium for 15 min before measuring the spectra.
UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (Cary 500 UV–vis-NIR Spectrophotometer) were recorded from 300 to 800 nm for the fresh supported Co-catalysts and bare single metal oxides. The samples were diluted with BaSO4 keeping constant the mass ratio of the sample and BaSO4 and spectra were measured against a BaSO4 background. Raman (Renishaw InVia Raman microscope) spectra of both fresh and spent catalysts were obtained using a 785 nm laser with 5% of the laser power (500 mW) and an exposure time of 10 s. Accumulation of spectra was set to 20 for better resolution.
XPS measurements were performed using a VG ESCALAB 220iXL spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with monochromatic Al Kα source (spot size: 500 μm, power: 150 W). The powder samples were placed on an adhesive copper tape which was mounted on a stainless steel holder that was later transferred to the instrument chamber and kept under vacuum. In built electron and ion neutralizers were used to compensate the charge generated from the samples. The spectra were recorded in constant analyzer energy of 30 eV. The XPS system was calibrated using the Ag 3d5/2, the Cu 2p3/2 and the Au 4f7/2 peaks.
High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) was performed by a Tecnai F30 ST (FEI, FEG, operated at 300 kV) microscope. Electron-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) measurements were taken by an EDX spectrometer (Gemini system, EDAX), mounted on the electron column right above the sample that allowed recording the spectra of selected spots. Amount of coke in the spent catalyst was quantified using a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA/SDTA851e, LF/1100 °C, Mettler Toledo AG). A mixture of 40 mL/min CO2 and 10 mL/min Ar as reactant gas was passed over the samples to oxidize the deposited carbon. Approximately 20 mg of each sample was taken for the analysis.
2.3. Catalyst testing
The catalysts were tested at atmospheric pressure in a tubular continuous flow reactor with 4 mm inner diameter that was contracted to 2 mm after the catalyst bed. Prior to use, the catalyst powders were pelletized, crushed and sieved, affording a 80–140 μm size fraction. Mixtures of 150 mg of catalyst (80–140 μm) and 50 mg SiC (160–190 μm) were used to establish a catalyst bed, which was fixed at the center using quartz wool [32]. The tubular reactor was placed in a temperature-controlled electrically heated furnace which was ramped (10 °C/min) to the desired temperature (typically 700 °C).
If not otherwise stated, the standard reaction conditions were: 700 °C, reactant gas ratio CO2/C2H6 = 2.5 and a total flow rate of reactant gases (CO2, 99.95% PanGas and C2H6, 99.5% PanGas) of 15 mL/min. During reaction, the temperature of the catalyst bed was monitored using two thermocouples at its inlet and outlet. Generally, their temperature difference was <4 °C during all testing. The effluent gases were analyzed, after passing through cold traps (to condense H2O), using online gas chromatography (HP-PLOT Q column 30 m long, 0.32 mm in diameter and 0.2 μm film thickness fitted with TCD and FID, Agilent Technologies). All the catalytic test results are presented after 2 h reaction, if not otherwise noted. The C2H6 and CO2 conversion and C2H4 selectivity are calculated as follows:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural and chemical properties of catalysts
3.1.1. Crystallinity, surface area and morphology
The flame-made catalytic powders were nonporous as evidenced by their nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms (Fig. S1, Supplementary data) [13]. Particle formation in flame depends on the volatility of the materials i.e. material with high melting temperature condenses first [31], [33]. Therefore since the cobalt oxide is more volatile than other metal oxides, cobalt constituents must be preferentially located at the outer surface of the catalysts. This postulate is also supported by the XPS analysis, which will be discussed later. Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of fresh powders containing 4.5 wt% Co supported on SiO2, Al2O3, TiO2, ZrO2 and corresponding mixed oxide supports. The SiO2- and SiO2-Al2O3-supported catalysts were XRD-amorphous while γ-Al2O3 patterns were observed with pure Al2O3 support. As XRD reflections of γ-Al2O3 and CoAl2O4 are similar, small amounts of CoAl2O4 could be present [34]. In TiO2-supported catalyst, both anatase and rutile TiO2 reflections were observed with the latter being dominant, indicating that cobalt promotes rutilization. This can be attributed to the substitution of Co3+ (0.55 Å) into the Ti4+ (0.61 Å) lattice, due to the difference in their ionic radii [35] similar to Al3+ substitution of Ti4+ [36]. The intensity of anatase and rutile reflections is lower in the SiO2-TiO2-supported catalyst than for the TiO2-supported catalyst, because SiO2 suppresses TiO2 crystallization and/or there is a significant amorphous fraction. In the ZrO2-supported catalyst essentially all reflections can be assigned to tetragonal zirconia (t-ZrO2). Slightly broader reflections implying smaller crystallite size were observed in SiO2-ZrO2-supported catalysts, a similar action to Si-doping of TiO2 and SnO2 where amorphous interstitial Si leads to smaller crystals and blocks crystal growth during their co-oxidation. In the TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalyst, only reflections corresponding to the mixed oxide phase, (ZrTiO4) srilankite [37], were observed. No reflections belonging to the crystalline TiO2 and ZrO2 were observed but their presence in amorphous form and/or as very small crystals cannot be ruled out.

Fig. 1. XRD patterns of supported cobalt catalysts (a) fresh and (b) spent (4.5 wt% Co loadings in all catalysts. Mixed oxide supports contain an equal mass ratio of both oxides.).
After ODHE at standard conditions, only the XRD patterns of TiO2- and ZrO2-supported catalysts were changed (Fig. 1b). In such spent TiO2-supported catalyst the anatase phase was transformed to rutile TiO2. Its reflection was narrower than in the fresh sample, indicating crystal growth. In the spent ZrO2-supported catalyst, the majority of t-ZrO2 was transformed to larger monoclinic (m) crystals. The high resistance towards sintering of the Al2O3-, SiO2- and their corresponding mixed oxide-supported catalysts can be attributed to the intrinsic thermal stability of these oxides or large amorphous fraction. No reflections of CoOx and its mixed oxide were detected in fresh and spent catalysts, indicating their high dispersion or rather amorphous state.
Fig. 2 shows the SSA of fresh and spent catalysts. The SSA of all catalysts decreased after standard ODHE test. The decrease was most significant for TiO2- and ZrO2-supported catalysts, whereas both SiO2- and Al2O3-supported catalysts showed remarkable resistance towards sintering, in agreement with XRD (Fig. 1). The SSA of fresh TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalyst was similar to that of the corresponding fresh single oxide supported catalysts (∼110 m2/g). However, the decrease in SSA was smaller in the case of the mixed metal oxides supported catalyst (48 m2/g) due to the formation of the thermally stable srilankite phase (Fig. 1) [38]. In SiO2-containing catalysts (e.g. SiO2-TiO2), the decrease in SSA after ODHE was minimal due to resistance of SiO2 towards sintering.

(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
The freshly prepared catalyst powders differed significantly in their color as indicated by the inset of Fig. 2. The catalysts’ color also confirms the formation of cobalt containing mixed oxides during synthesis, e.g. blue in SiO2- (cobalt silicate) and Al2O3- (cobalt aluminate) supported catalysts [39]. The black color of the ZrO2-supported catalyst could be an indication of CoOx species formation. In Fig. 3 the HR-TEM images of fresh and spent SiO2-supported catalysts are shown exemplarily. In the fresh catalyst, cobalt-containing particles were around 2 nm and increased to about 10 nm after reaction. The bright spots in the images are due to cobalt species embedded in the silica matrix (e.g. cobalt silicate) in the fresh catalysts, whereas the observed bright spots on the corresponding spent catalysts are from Co in SiO2 and/or CoOx as indicated by EDX measurements.

3.1.2. NH3-TPD and DRIFTS
NH3-TPD measurements on fresh single and mixed oxide supported catalysts were performed to examine acidic sites on their surfaces (Fig. 4a). A very broad NH3-desorption signal was observed with the SiO2-supported catalyst compared to that of Al2O3- and TiO2-supported ones. The ZrO2-supported catalyst showed the narrowest low temperature desorption peak (around 200 °C) among all catalysts. The SiO2-Al2O3-supported catalyst possessed both weak and medium acidic sites (similar to that observed for the Al2O3-supported catalyst) beside strong acidic sites, indicated by the peak at ∼500 °C. For the TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalyst, the NH3 desorption profile is broader than that of the ZrO2-supported catalyst and similar to that of the TiO2-supported catalyst.

Fig. 4. (a) NH3-TPD analysis of differently supported 4.5% Co-catalysts and (b) corresponding deconvoluted plots of selected patterns.
Fig. 4b shows the deconvoluted profiles of some selected catalysts. In Al2O3- and SiO2-Al2O3-supported catalysts, the low temperature (100–250 °C) signal was composed of physisorbed NH3 and weakly adsorbed NH3 at Brønsted acid sites, respectively [40]. The deconvoluted peak around 290 °C can be attributed to strong Lewis acid sites, whereas higher desorption temperatures can be attributed to strong Brønsted acid sites [40]. Among single metal oxide supported catalysts, the SiO2-supported one showed the highest total NH3 uptake (210 μmol NH3/gcat) followed by those with TiO2, Al2O3 and ZrO2 supports (Table 1). Mixed oxide supports showed relatively higher NH3 uptake than single ones. However, when the amount of NH3 desorbed is referred to the catalysts’ SSA, different tendencies are observed, particularly for single metal supported catalysts (Table S1). Silica-supported catalyst exhibited the lowest surface density of acidic sites (0.50 μmol NH3/m2cat), whereas for the TiO2-supported one highest value was measured (1.8 μmol NH3/m2cat). High surface densities of acidic sites were also found for TiO2-ZrO2- and SiO2-TiO2-supported catalysts.

Fig. 5 shows the DRIFT spectra of NH3 adsorbed on a) single and b) mixed oxide supported catalysts. All bands at 3600–3750 cm−1 can be attributed to NH3 reaction with the residual OH groups of these flame-made oxides [41]. Multiple bands in the range of 3100–3500 cm−1 observed in SiO2- and Al2O3-supported catalysts arise from the NH3 stretching modes on the support [42]. Moreover, both catalysts showed a band at 1619 cm−1 due to asymmetric NH3 deformation in addition to 1282 (on Co/SiO2) and 1242 cm−1 (on Co/Al2O3) due to symmetric NH3 deformation. Both catalysts contained Brønsted acid sites as evidenced by a band around 1450 cm−1. The multiple bands in the range of 3100–3500 cm−1 can be attributed to the stretching vibration of NH3 on the TiO2 surface [42]. The bands at 1414 and 1540 cm−1 are indicative of Brønsted acid sites and the existence of NH2-bending vibration, respectively [43], and 1594, 1158 and 1112 cm−1 of Lewis-acid centers [42]. The latter doublet bands are due to inversion splitting [44]. The bands at 1615 and 1223 cm−1 are due to NH deformation and the 3308, 3203, 3168 cm−1 signals related to NH stretching are assigned to the Lewis-acidic sites on the ZrO2-supported catalyst [42]. Additionally, a band at 1460 cm−1 is assigned to Brønsted acid sites [42].

The spectra in the NH3-stretching range of 3100–3400 cm−1 for mixed oxide supported catalysts remained similar to the single oxide ones (Fig. 5a). A broad hump ranging from 2700 to 3100 cm−1 in catalysts containing SiO2 can be attributed to perturbed OH vibrations [45] in SiOH⋯NH3. The band at 1464 cm−1 is relatively intense and broader than that of single oxides, indicating an increased density of Brønsted acid sites. Moreover, a slight shift in the position of the bands belonging to the Lewis acid sites of Al2O3-, TiO2- and ZrO2-supported catalysts was observed upon introduction of the second metal oxide, an indication of an increase in catalyst acidity [46]. These observations are in agreement with the NH3-TPD results (Table 1).
3.1.3. Raman
Fig. 6a shows Raman spectra of fresh catalysts. No significant signals attributable to Si-O stretches or Al2O3 were observed in the SiO2- and SiO2-Al2O3-supported catalysts, probably due to the low Raman scattering of these oxides [47]. A very small signal at 693 cm−1 was observed with the Al2O3-supported catalyst but could not be assigned unambiguously due to the similarity in band position of cobalt oxide and CoAl2O4 [48]. However, the color of the Al2O3-supported catalyst was blue (Fig. 2 inset) indicating the formation of Co-mixed oxides [34], e.g. CoAl2O4, consistent with the observation made by Høj et al. [34] and Minnermann et al. [49] for flame-made Co-Mo/Al2O3 and Co/Al2O3 catalysts, respectively.

Fig. 6. Raman Spectra of (a) fresh and (b) spent supported 4.5% Co-loaded catalysts.
For TiO2-supported catalyst Raman bands at 439 and 610 cm−1 (due to rutile TiO2) [50] and 146 cm−1 (due to anatase TiO2) [51], were detected in agreement with XRD (Fig. 1a). The band around 250 cm−1 is the result of the second-order Raman scattering of the rutile structure [52]. For the ZrO2-supported catalyst [53], only the bands at 146, 266, 317, 461 and 646 cm−1 corresponding to t-ZrO2 were observed. The band at 693 cm−1 reveals the presence of Co3O4 [48]. In the SiO2-TiO2-supported catalyst, the band at 447 cm−1 belonging to rutile TiO2 (rest anatase) was observed further confirming its presence in the catalyst. The absence of Raman bands of the SiO2-ZrO2-supported catalyst even though the crystal phase of ZrO2 was distinctly detected by XRD, indicates that SiO2 impaired the measurement. The observed Raman band positions of the TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalyst are different than those of the TiO2- and ZrO2-supported catalysts, further confirming the formation of a mixed oxide phase [54], namely, ZrTiO4 (srilankite) [55], as was indicated by XRD (Fig. 1a). The bands at 286, 326, 414 and 634 cm−1 can be assigned to ZrTiO4 [55]. The broad band around 146 cm−1 could be an overlap of anatase TiO2, t-ZrO2 and ZrTiO4 (∼160 cm−1) due their close proximity.
Raman spectroscopy of most spent catalysts showed features similar to the fresh ones with only a slight change mainly due to fluorescence (Fig. 6b). Significant changes were observed only for spent TiO2- and ZrO2-supported catalysts. New bands at 236, 266, 335 and 693 cm−1 were detected matching the vibrational modes of CoTiO3 (693 cm−1 could be also from Co3O4) in the TiO2-supported catalysts [56], [57]. The rest of the bands belong to rutile TiO2. For the spent ZrO2-supported catalyst, all bands can be assigned to m-ZrO2 except the bands at 266 and 685 cm−1, which belong to t-ZrO2 [53] and Co3O4 [48], respectively. Raman bands of the spent TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalyst show low intensity but broad features around 200, 450 and 600 cm−1 belonging to ZrTiO4 and indicating that the crystal structure is retained during ODHE in agreement with XRD (Fig. 1b). The suppression of the Raman spectra intensity could be due to the interference created by deposited coke on the catalysts’ surface. In all spent catalysts, Raman bands around 1300 and 1600 cm−1 were observed (not shown), belonging to disordered (D) and graphitic (G) carbon, an indication of coke deposition during the reaction [58].
3.1.4. UV–vis reflectance and reducibility
Fig. 7 shows UV–vis spectra of a) pure single metal oxides, b) Co-containing single metal oxides and c) Co-containing mixed metal oxides. Fairly flat (400–800 nm) spectra were obtained with pure single metal oxide supports (Fig. 7a). Therefore, the observed changes in the spectra of Fig. 7b,c can be attributed to the CoOx and/or its interaction with the support. Flame-made pure CoOx exhibited bands around 400 and 710 nm (Fig. 7a), close to the reported values of around 430 and 720 nm for Co3O4 [22]. In all catalysts containing TiO2, red-shifting of its band at 300–400 nm is observed that can be attributed to TiO2 rutilization by cobalt. A broad feature is observed in the range of 575–735 nm, which can be assigned to CoTiO3 [59]. A similar feature (500–700 nm) was also observed with the TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalyst indicating the formation of mixed oxide in accordance with XRD (Fig. 1). Two broad signals around 380 and 690 nm were observed with the ZrO2-supported catalyst that can be attributed to CoOx. These signals were absent in other catalysts. However, since relatively high H2-uptake was observed over TiO2- and TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalysts (Table 1), the features of CoOx could have been overlapped/suppressed by bands from other structures. More specifically, the first signal from CoOx (around 380 nm) is clearly masked by the TiO2 absorption spectrum, whereas the absence of the second signal (around 690 nm) is likely due to different interaction of CoOx with TiO2 and TiO2-ZrO2 compared to that with ZrO2, which will be discussed later. Three distinct bands were observed around 520, 590 and 635 nm and 540, 580 and 630 nm with SiO2- and Al2O3-supported catalysts, respectively. The structural feature of SiO2-ZrO2-supported catalyst was similar to that of the SiO2-supported one. The SiO2-TiO2-supported catalyst showed spectral features (3 bands) similar to that of SiO2- supported one. Such spectral features of the single metal oxide supported catalysts (Al2O3 and SiO2) are attributed to the three spin allowed d–d transitions of tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ in Co-aluminate [60] and Co-silicate species [61]. The absence of octahedral Co3+ species indicates that flame synthesis favors formation of tetrahedral species incorporated into the Al2O3 [34]- and SiO2 [62]-matrix.

H2-TPR profiles of all as-prepared catalysts are presented in Fig. 8 along with deconvolution of the SiO2-, ZrO2- and TiO2-ZrO2-supported ones. Significant differences in the reduction profiles indicate that the oxidation state and the interaction of the cobalt species strongly depend on support composition. For Co3O4 generally, a two-step reduction is observed: Co3O4 → CoO and CoO → Co [63]. This was also confirmed by TPR over mechanically mixed commercial Co3O4 (Sigma Aldrich) with flame-made SiO2 (90 wt%) (not shown). The powder prepared by mechanical mixing showed a broad reduction peak ranging from 200 to 450 °C. Generally, relatively strong interaction between the CoOx species and the support was observed with all catalysts, indicated by a shift of the reduction peaks to higher temperatures (> 450 °C) [63].

The silica-supported catalyst could only be reduced above 750 °C, indicating strong interaction between cobalt oxide and silica, most likely due to formation of cobalt silicate [64]. A distinct shoulder was observed (∼820 °C), indicating the existence of different types of interactions between CoOx and SiO2. No reduction peaks were observed in both the Al2O3- and SiO2-Al2O3-supported catalysts, which could be attributed to the possible formation of CoAl2O4 that can only be reduced above 900 °C [34], [65]. The high temperature reduction peak (∼600 °C) of the TiO2-supported catalyst can be attributed to the strong binding between CoOx and rutile TiO2 [66].
For ZrO2-supported catalysts the low temperature reduction peak (around 200 °C) can be assigned to nano-sized easily reducible surface Co3O4 species [67]. The high temperature reduction peak was shifted to higher temperature (around 500 °C) compared to that of pure commercial Co3O4 (around 400 °C), which can be ascribed to the reduction of strongly bound CoOx on the ZrO2 surface [67]. The presence of a shoulder between low (∼210 °C) and high (∼280 °C) temperature reduction peaks can be attributed to the stepwise reduction of a fraction of Co3O4 to Co0. Silica containing TiO2 and ZrO2 mixed oxide supported catalysts showed high temperature reduction peaks of low intensity (∼810 °C) assignable to the reduction of cobalt silicate. With the TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalyst, a high temperature reduction peak (∼500 °C) was observed, also indicating strong interaction between CoOx and the support. This reduction peak of the TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalyst is positioned at higher temperature compared to that of ZrO2- and at slightly lower position than that of TiO2-supported catalysts. The broad feature observed for the TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalyst implies that virtually all CoOx species may have been embedded in the support matrix making them difficult to reduce at lower temperatures [66], [67].
Hydrogen uptakes of the various catalysts are summarized in Table 1. The ZrO2-supported catalyst exhibited the highest total H2-uptake (∼1025 μmol/gcat), followed by TiO2-, TiO2-ZrO2-, SiO2-, SiO2-ZrO2- and SiO2-TiO2-supported catalysts. We can distinguish between H2-uptake due to CoOx species reducible at lower temperature (<500 °C), as it occurred with the ZrO2-supported catalyst and higher temperature (>500 °C), as observed with the SiO2-supported one. Al2O3- and SiO2-Al2O3-supported catalysts showed no significant H2-uptakes, indicating that cobalt species were not reducible up to 840 °C. Lower H2-uptake by TiO2- and TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalysts compared to the ZrO2-supported one indicates that CoOx-admixing to TiO2 results in less reducible species (stronger support interaction), e.g. CoTiO3 [57]. Correlating this with the UV–vis results (Fig. 7) of the former two catalysts (TiO2- and TiO2-ZrO2), the absence of the second signal of CoOx (around 690 nm) can be attributed to this Co–Ti interaction.
3.1.5. XPS
Fig. 9 shows the Co 2p spectra obtained from XPS analysis over selected supported catalysts. The intensity of signals of the ZrO2-supported catalyst is higher compared to those from TiO2-ZrO2- and SiO2-supported catalysts, which could be related to the presence and/or amount of reducible CoOx species [68]. The Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 signals appeared at binding energies (BEs) of 779.4 eV and 794.9 eV, respectively, which also had corresponding satellite peaks appearing at 784.5 eV and 801.0 eV, over ZrO2 supported catalysts (Table S2). Similar values were also obtained over TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalyst. These BE values are close to those reported for Co3O4 and CoO confirming the presence of reducible cobalt oxides, which is in good agreement with reducibility results (Fig. 8) [68], [69]. However, a small difference in the BEs between these aforementioned supported catalysts exists (around 0.4 eV) pointing to the possible presence of a slightly higher amount of Co3O4 in the catalyst surface exhibiting the low values (i.e. over ZrO2). Over the SiO2-supported catalyst, the observed signals are vastly different from those of the other two supported catalysts, implying the absence of reducible CoOx species and the formation of Co-Si mixed oxide (e.g. cobalt silicate) [70], in agreement with our UV–vis and H2-TPR results.

3.2. Catalytic performance
3.2.1. Identified products and relevant reactions observed
During the ODHE reaction, besides the desired ethene also the formation of water, H2, CO, coke and methane were detected indicating simultaneous occurrence of several side reactions. Therefore, based on observations and with literature support, the following reactions are proposed to be relevant. With all catalysts, ethene was the major product confirming ODHE (C2H6 + CO2 → C2H4 + CO + H2O) and/or DHE (C2H6 → C2H4 + H2) as the governing reactions. In the former case, CO2 has been reported to oxidize the reduced active sites [8], [29] (redox pathways) whereas in the latter case, it pushes the equilibrium towards product side by consuming H2 via reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction (CO2 + H2 → CO + H2O) [12]. The RWGS reaction has been investigated separately over some selected catalysts (Fig. S2) and will be discussed later. Production of CO from the reaction can be related to RWGS, dry reforming of ethane (C2H6 + 2CO2 → 4CO + 3H2) and/or reverse Boudouard reaction (CO2 + C → 2CO) but to separate contributions of these feasible reactions is rather challenging. Coke formation by cracking was observed with all catalysts but to different extent (Table S1). Methane production (Fig. S3) can be related to CO and/or CO2 methanation or to ethane hydrogenolysis (C2H6 + H2 → 2CH4). The above mentioned reactions have been observed in several studies [12], [13], [71]. The elucidation of the individual contributions of all side reactions is very demanding and was beyond the scope of this work.
3.2.2. Influence of single and mixed metal oxide supports
In a first step the ODHE performance of all catalysts was compared at standard conditions (700 °C, feed ratio CO2/C2H6 = 2.5, total reactant gas (C2H6 and CO2) flow rate 15 mL/min, W/F = 0.6 g s/mL).
All catalysts showed an unsteady initial period (induction period), the duration of which depended on the catalyst type. Fig. 10 shows the conversion and selectivity to ethene of the catalysts during the induction period (top figure) and at steady state (bottom figure). During the induction period, all catalysts exhibited relatively high ethane conversion and low ethene selectivity compared to the performance after nearly steady state has been achieved. This behavior is attributed to changes in the catalyst properties occurring during the induction period. All fresh single- and mixed oxide-supported catalysts, except the ZrO2-supported one, exhibited high surface acidity (Table 1), as evidenced by high NH3 uptake. We propose that the initial activity (induction period) of the catalysts is influenced by the reducibility of the Co species, the population and strength of the acidic sites and the SSA of the fresh catalysts. Major changes during the induction period are induced by coking and sintering of the catalysts. These changes are indicated by the coke deposition (Table S1), particle size growth (Fig. 3) and decrease in SSA (Fig. 2) of the catalysts after steady state has been reached.

(top: induction period, after 20 min; bottom: steady state after 2 h). Reaction conditions: T = 700 °C; CO2/C2H6 = 2.5; total flow rate = 15 mL/min; catalyst wt. = 150 mg.
Coking is mainly promoted by the surface acidity (strength and population density) of the different supports, while the decrease of the surface area is thermally induced. The deposition of carbonaceous species on the surface seems to have a beneficial effect on the ethene selectivity but the activity decreases most likely due to blocking of active sites. However, the contribution of the different factors affecting the catalytic behavior (reducibility of Co-species, surface acidity, surface area, coking) on the final steady state behavior of the catalysts cannot be differentiated unambiguously based on the information collected in this work.
At steady state, SiO2- and ZrO2-supported cobalt catalysts showed superior performance compared to those supported on other single metal oxide supports. A similar ethene yield (around 23%) was observed for SiO2- and ZrO2-supported catalysts, with an ethene selectivity of 81% and 62%, respectively. The activity of TiO2- and Al2O3-supported catalysts was similar to that of the homogeneous gas phase reaction in the absence of catalyst (ethene yield ∼15%). Wang et al. [8] reported a similar behavior for Cr-doped catalysts for ODHE where the performance of the SiO2-supported catalyst was superior compared to other supported catalysts. The yield of SiO2-supported catalyst was better than that of catalysts where SiO2 was mixed with ZrO2, TiO2 or Al2O3. The TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalyst exhibited an ethene yield of ∼24%, which is comparable to that of both SiO2- and ZrO2-supported catalysts. Correlating CO2 conversions (Table S1) with the reaction results (Fig. 10), it can be inferred that conversion of CO2 is highly affected by the support type, which will be discussed further in detail.
Reaction rates referred to unit surface area (μmol C2H6/m2 s) of the catalysts were evaluated to gain insight into the activity of the catalysts (Fig. S4). Interestingly, the SiO2-supported catalyst showed the lowest rate (∼13 μmol C2H6/m2 s), while the ZrO2- and TiO2-ZrO2- supported ones showed the highest rates (∼60 μmol C2H6/m2 s). Among all the catalysts, Al2O3-, ZrO2- and TiO2-ZrO2-supported ones showed highest CH4 selectivity, while the lowest was observed over the SiO2-supported one under the applied standard reaction conditions (Table S1). This indicates that cracking or methanation is promoted over these three former catalysts. Highest amount of coke was deposited over the Al2O3-supported catalyst (∼4 wt%) followed by catalysts based on TiO2-ZrO2 and SiO2-Al2O3 ≈ SiO2 (1.9 wt%) supports, which can be associated with their acidity (Table 1). Efficient removal of coke and/or catalyst physicochemical changes (e.g. SSA and acidity) during the reaction could be the reason for relatively low coke deposition over the other catalysts (Table S1).
Deeper insight into the catalyst performance is gained by considering the selectivity versus conversion plots. For that purpose the catalysts were tested at different contact times (0.1–1.2 g s/mL), while keeping the other reaction conditions constant (Fig. 11). At isoconversion values >35%, the SiO2-supported catalyst showed the highest ethene selectivity among all tested catalysts confirming that it is the best performing catalyst for ODHE under these conditions. This catalyst showed ethane conversion and ethene selectivity as high as 46% and 74%, respectively. Similar high ethane conversion (46%) was also observed over ZrO2- and TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalysts but at the expense of ethene selectivity. The undesired side reactions of ethene (e.g. formation of CH4 and coke) became increasingly significant at higher conversion/contact time. The CH4 selectivity of SiO2-supported catalyst was virtually constant at all contact times indicating the occurrence of ethene conversion mainly to coke with increasing contact time (Fig. S3). While over ZrO2- and TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalysts conversion of ethene to CH4 seemed to be favored with increasing contact time as evidenced by a small increment in its selectivity. The opposing trend in ethane conversion and ethene selectivity over these catalysts indicates a trade-off between them that poses a critical challenge for developing an efficient catalyst.

At isoconversion values <35%, SiO2- and SiO2-ZrO2-supported catalysts exhibited better performance than TiO2-, SiO2-Al2O3- and SiO2-TiO2-supported ones. Though similar catalytic behavior was observed over SiO2- and SiO2-ZrO2-supported catalysts, improvement in ethane conversion with minimal change in ethene selectivity could not be achieved over the latter even when using the highest contact time (1.2 g s/mL). Overall, the SiO2-supported catalyst was the most efficient catalyst exhibiting an ethene selectivity of 74% at 46% ethane conversion, resulting in an ethene yield of 34%.
During ODHE, CO2 was consumed over all catalysts confirming its active participation in this reaction (Table S1). Higher CO2 conversion was observed over ZrO2- (17%) and TiO2-ZrO2- (22.3%) supported catalysts than over the others (3.4-9.5%). Oxidation of the deposited coke from the catalyst surface, reaction with H2 favoring the forward ethane dehydrogenation reaction [13] and oxidation of reduced active species are some of the pathways [29] consuming CO2. The high CO2 conversion over ZrO2- and TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalysts can be directly correlated to the high ethane conversion and low ethene selectivity (Fig. 10), where CO2 assists in favoring the forward dehydrogenation reaction by consuming H2 and also to its beneficial action in regenerating active sites blocked by carbonaceous deposits [13], [29]. The reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction was performed independently over SiO2-, ZrO2- and TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalysts to evaluate its role in the reaction network (Fig. S2). High RWGS activity was observed over the ZrO2- and TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalysts evidenced by high CO2 conversion. Therefore, during the ODHE reaction over these two catalysts, high ethane conversion can be directly related to the high RWGS reaction rate, which shifts the equilibrium of the ODHE reaction towards the products. Moreover, compared to the SiO2-supported catalyst, these two catalysts exhibited slightly higher CH4 selectivity indicating high cracking or methanation rates. Since ethene is more reactive than ethane, the decrease in its selectivity is most likely due to cracking. Additionally, the low ethene selectivity can also arises from unselective reaction of ethane and CO2 (dry reforming of ethane) [72]. The CO2 conversion increased with increasing contact time, mainly over SiO2-, ZrO2- and TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalysts, further corroborating the CO2 participation in ODHE (Fig. S5).
SiO2-, ZrO2-, and TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalysts (Fig. 10, Fig. 11) may be taken to elucidate the influence of the various characteristics (reducibility, Fig. 8, Table 1; surface acidity, Fig. 4, Table 1; surface area, Fig. 2) of the catalysts on their activity and selectivity. We speculate that depending on the reducibility of the cobalt species and the surface acidity two different reaction pathways may prevail, a redox and a non-redox mechanism. In the case of SiO2-supported catalyst, cobalt silicate was formed, in which the cobalt species are fairly stable against reduction [64]. It can be assumed that the tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ ions that are present in cobalt silicate [61] are essential for the catalytic performance. Similar observation was also reported for cobalt-exchanged hydroxyapatite [20] and Co/MCM-41 [25] catalysts during oxygen-assisted ODHE and oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane, respectively. Since the bare flame-made SiO2 is virtually inactive, showing a performance similar to that of an empty tube (∼15% yield), it can be concluded that the high activity of the SiO2-supported catalyst is exclusively due to cobalt that exists predominantly as cobalt silicate containing tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ ions (Fig. 7). In contrast, octahedrally coordinated Co3+ ions (CoOx species) prevail in ZrO2- and TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalysts, as corroborated by the low temperature reduction profiles (Fig. 8) and Co 2p3/2,1/2 spectra of XPS (Fig. 9).
As concerns the role of surface acidity, SiO2- and TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalysts showed similar overall NH3 uptake, whereas that of the ZrO2-supported catalyst was much lower (Table 1). The surface acidity was normalized by the catalysts’ SSA and correlated to the activity of the catalyst to further understand the activity-acidity relationship (Fig. S6). Regardless of the difference in the surface density of acidic sites, all the catalysts showed virtually similar ethane conversion except the SiO2-, ZrO2- and TiO2-ZrO2-supported ones. Among these, the SiO2-supported catalyst possessed the lowest density of acid sites followed by ZrO2- and TiO2-ZrO2-supported ones (Table S1). An increase in ethane conversion was observed with increasing surface density of acidic sites, whereas an opposite trend was observed when relating them to the ethene selectivity. This indicates that these sites are reactive towards both ethane and ethene and indicates that beside the state and reducibility of the cobalt species, surface acidity plays a role in ODHE, particularly by promoting side reactions. Nevertheless, regardless of these differences, the overall performance (ethene yield) of these catalysts was virtually similar, lending further support that most likely different reaction pathways occur with these catalysts.
As regards the role of the surface area, it seems to be of lesser importance than reducibility and surface acidity. This emerges from Fig. 2 where mixed oxide supported catalysts containing SiO2 had relatively high SSA (>150 m2/g) but their activity was low compared to that of ZrO2 and TiO2-ZrO2.
With the SiO2-supported catalyst tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ ions in the SiO2 matrix and surface acidity seem crucial. Recently, Hu et al. [73] showed that the selective propane dehydrogenation proceeds via a non-redox mechanism over Co/SiO2 where Co2+ ions are tetrahedrally coordinated in the SiO2 matrix. It was speculated that the heterolytic cleavage of the ethane CH bond is the key step in this reaction and the process is catalyzed by the non-redox single site i.e. Co2+ that is tetrahedrally coordinated with the SiO2 structure. This conclusion was derived based on the resistance of these ions to both oxidation and reduction, in agreement with previous reports on Co exchanged zeolite ZSM-5 [74]. In addition, the residual Brønsted acid sites also significantly contributed to the activity of the zeolite catalyst [73], [74]. Thus, CO2 mainly reacts with coke and/or H2 over the SiO2-supported catalyst. The reaction is expected to occur primarily as a consequence of the redox cycle of Co-O species over the ZrO2- and TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalysts, wherein CO2 acts as an oxidant [29], in addition to its two previously mentioned contributions. An increase in ethane conversion with a concomitant decrease in ethene selectivity was observed that could be attributed to the higher acidity of the TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalyst.
Summarizing, evidence has been accumulated that both reducibility of the cobalt species as well as the surface acidity are important descriptors for optimizing supported cobalt catalysts for CO2-assisted ODHE. The superior performance of the SiO2-supported cobalt catalysts can be attributed to the role of the relatively stable tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ ions near the surface, whereas the redox behavior of easier reducible CoOx species seems to be crucial for explaining the performance of ZrO2- and TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalysts.
The best performing catalysts were also evaluated for their potential for the ODHE reaction using O2 as an oxidant (Table S3). All the reaction conditions were kept similar as described in the experimental section except the reaction temperature and the reactant gas composition, which were changed to 500 °C and C2H6:O2:He = 6.4:3.2:5.4 mL/min, respectively. This temperature was chosen since it seemed to represent the mean value of the generally reported reaction temperatures (300–700 °C) and the reactant gas ratio of 2 is equal to the stoichiometric ratio of the reaction (C2H6 + 0.5O2 → C2H4 + H2O) [1], [7]. Ethane conversion and ethene selectivity were less than 10% and 40%, respectively, over SiO2- and ZrO2-supported catalysts. However, these values were higher over TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalysts (C2H4-yield of ∼16%). Former two supported catalysts promoted the unselective reactions, whereas the latter one favored the desired reaction. Performance of these catalysts was generally lower compared to most other true ODHE catalysts [1], [75], [76]. Nevertheless, the activity of the mixed oxides supported catalyst seemed to be comparable to some of the reported values exhibiting some potential as ODHE catalyst under true oxidative conditions (with O2 or air) [20], [22]. Overall, comparing the catalytic results from O2 and CO2 assisted ODHE, it can be inferred that the use of the latter oxidant is beneficial.
3.2.3. Performance of SiO2-supported catalyst at different reaction conditions
For deeper insight into the behavior of the best performing SiO2-supported catalyst, the influence of reaction temperature (650–725 °C), feed gas composition (CO2/C2H6 = 0–4.5) and gas hourly space velocity (3,000–36,000 L/kgcat h) as well as the catalysts’ stability was investigated. Fig. 12a shows the influence of reaction temperature on the ODHE performance of the SiO2-supported catalyst. At higher reaction temperatures, in addition to the catalytic reaction, some contribution of homogeneous gas phase reactions seems to become significant. An ethane conversion of 20% was achieved at 650 °C, which increased with increasing reaction temperature, attaining nearly 50% at 725 °C. However, at T >675 °C, the ethane selectivity was adversely affected. At higher reaction temperatures, formation of larger metallic cobalt ensembles can be expected [26], which promotes the unselective and/or secondary reactions resulting in lower ethene selectivity [72]. Concomitant increase in CO2 conversion was observed with increasing ethane conversion indicating that it assists the reaction by gasifying the deposited coke and also by reacting with H2, which is primarily produced by DHE [13]. During this CO2 assisted coke gasification, the catalysts’ surface is partially cleaned exposing sites (e.g. cobalt metal ensembles) that transform ethene to coke, thus lowering selectivity to ethene. In addition, CO2 reforming of ethane could also contribute to high conversions (both ethane and CO2) at higher temperatures [72].

Fig. 12b shows the influence of the feed gas composition on the performance of the SiO2-supported catalyst. The reaction was carried out with constant gas hourly space velocity of 6,000 L/kgcat h at 700 °C. The ethane conversion dropped from ∼30% to ∼20% when CO2 was replaced by helium while maintaining the gas ratio of 2.5, in the reactant gas feed. However by lowering the reactant gas ratio (CO2/C2H6) to 1.5, ethane conversion increased to ∼34%, confirming that CO2 plays an important role during reaction, e.g. by removing coke, as discussed earlier [13], [17]. After a slight decrease, ethene selectivity increased and remained virtually constant (around 80%), irrespective of a further increase in the CO2/C2H6 ratio. A similar trend was found for ethane conversion, which showed a small initial decrease followed by an increase to a stable value of ∼35% resulting the highest ethene yield of ∼28%. Minimal decrease in CO2 conversion was observed with increasing CO2/C2H6 ratio. This behavior is similar to that observed by Zu et al. [72] for ODHE over Co-loaded Mn-Na2WO4/SiO2 catalysts. Rather high CO2 conversions (22–45%) were achieved at lower CO2/C2H6 ratio (≤3), however, at the expense of ethene selectivity reducing their yield to 25%. This was attributed to CO2 reforming of C2H6 due to formation and growth of metallic cobalt domains [72]. So high catalyst activity can be achieved by maintaining the oxidic state of cobalt. Any further improvement in the catalytic activity seems to be mainly limited by the contact time (Fig. 11).
The effect of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) on the activity of SiO2-supported catalyst at 700 °C and a CO2/C2H6 ratio of 2.5 is shown in Fig. 12c. With increasing GHSVs, ethane conversion decreased, whereas ethene selectivity increased to ∼24% and ∼86%, respectively, at 36,000 L/kgcat h. This decrease in conversion can be ascribed to the low residence time for reactant gases in the catalyst bed. Improvement in the selectivity can be attributed to the reduction/elimination of secondary reaction pathways of ethene, e.g. cracking [29], [72]. At higher GHSVs, ethene selectivity seemed to have reached the optimal state though a decreasing trend in the ethane conversion was still perceivable indicating similar product distribution. The ethene yield followed a trend similar to ethane conversion with increasing GHSV. The CO2 conversion increased with decreasing GHSV corroborating its active role in the ODHE reaction.
Sintering and coking are the two main reasons for deactivation of ODHE catalysts [11], [13]. Therefore, an investigation of the stability of the catalyst is necessary to evaluate its efficacy and identify descriptors for tailoring the optimal catalyst. The time-on-stream test was performed using the SiO2-supported catalyst for 5 h under standard reaction conditions. The catalyst was stable showing nearly 30% ethane conversion and 80% ethene selectivity, exhibiting virtually constant ethene yield, even after 5 h of reaction (Fig. 12d). The initial unsteady period can be attributed to early changes in the physicochemical properties of the catalyst, e.g. SSA decrease and coke deposition. Steady CO2 conversion, which followed the trend similar to that of ethane conversion, indicates that CO2 was actively involved in the reaction. XRD patterns of the spent catalyst were similar to that of the fresh one (Fig. 1a) and the SSA was still relatively high (247 m2/g) after the stability test. Therefore, the stable performance of the catalyst can be attributed to its resistance towards sintering and the ability to retain most of cobalt-embedded in the SiO2 matrix as cobalt silicate.
4. Conclusions
Among various single and mixed oxides, silica showed the best performance as support for the Co-catalyzed oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with CO2. Depending on the support, different types of interaction between CoOx and support were indicated by H2-TPR, XPS and UV–vis spectroscopy. Well-reducible CoOx species were formed in ZrO2-, TiO2- and TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalysts, whereas the SiO2-containing catalysts showed very high reduction temperature of the cobalt constituent due to formation of cobalt silicate containing tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ species. NH3-TPD as well as DRIFTS showed that SiO2- and TiO2-ZrO2-supported catalysts possessed moderately strong acidic sites, whereas SiO2-TiO2- and SiO2-Al2O3-supported catalysts showed stronger acidic sites.
The studies revealed that both the reducibility of the Co species as well as the strength and surface density of acidic sites are critical catalyst properties for achieving optimal performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. However, these properties seem to be interdependent to some degree, so that an absolute assignment of their contribution cannot be given without ambiguity. Clear is that the surface acidity also plays a significant role by promoting side reactions (e.g. reverse water gas shift and cracking).
Coke deposition was observed with all catalysts and Raman spectroscopy revealed it to be mainly D- and G-type carbon. Parametric sensitivity studies of the best performing SiO2-supported catalyst showed that high reaction temperature (>675 °C) is detrimental for ethene selectivity. Low performance in the absence of CO2 confirmed that CO2 plays an important role in ODHE increasing the conversion by 50%. Change of the oxidant from CO2 to O2 led to significantly lower ethene yields, indicating that the use of CO2 is beneficial for these catalysts. The SiO2-supported catalyst showed stable performance for 5 h time-on-stream. Optimization of this catalyst by increasing the fraction of Co species, which are embedded in the silica matrix and strongly interact with the silica support (cobalt silicate), seems a promising strategy to further enhance the performance of this catalyst in ODHE with CO2.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
