Comparative study of propane dehydrogenation over V-, Cr-, and Pt-based catalysts: Time on-stream behavior and origins of deactivation

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021951712001777

AbstractAbstract
Catalytic performance of VOx/MCM-41 possessing highly dispersed VOx species in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (DH) was compared with that of industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and Pt–Sn/Al2O3 over four DH (24 h on-stream) and oxidative regeneration cycles. The effect of reduction with H2 on the catalysts DH properties was also investigated. VOx/MCM-41 in both oxidized and reduced form showed superior time on-stream stability in all DH cycles and its activity could be fully recovered by oxidative regeneration. In situ time-resolved UV/Vis spectroscopy and temperature-programmed oxidation of the used catalysts enabled us to elucidate the origins of the catalysts deactivation. In a single DH cycle, the formation of carbon deposits is the main reason for the deactivation. Activity loss of CrOx/MCM-41 and Pt–Sn/Al2O3 from cycle to cycle was caused by structural changes in the catalytically active metal/metal oxide species. In contrast to these two catalysts, the structure of active VOx species on MCM-41 was not changed during the DH/regeneration cycles, which is the reason for stable performance of the latter catalyst.

V- and Cr oxide-based catalysts with highly dispersed metal oxide species were prepared using MCM-41 as a support and tested in propane dehydrogenation. VOx/MCM-41 retained its activity through four dehydrogenation/oxidative regeneration cycles thanks to high stability of VOx species, whereas CrOx/MCM-41 gradually lost activity as aggregation of CrOx species occurred.

1. Introduction
Propene is one of the most important base chemical intermediates mainly used in polymer and rubber industry. The two main commercial processes of propene production are steam cracking of naphtha or liquid petroleum gas as well as fluid catalytic cracking of heavier oil fractions. However, these processes are already optimized with respect to propene selectivity and cannot yield further significant increase in propene production. Yet, a continuously growing demand for propene drives intense exploration of the new production processes. Catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation (DH) of propane and metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes are the two promising industrially applied alternatives.
Commercial propane DH is carried out at temperatures above 800 K due to thermodynamic constraints. As a consequence, propane/propene cracking and formation of coke occur contributing to the selectivity loss [1]. Commercial catalysts applied in this process contain supported CrOx or Pt species as active components. For example, the CATOFIN and Snamprogetti processes utilize a chromia–alumina catalyst in fixed and fluidized bed reactors, respectively [1]. Alumina-supported Pt catalysts are used in the Oleflex and STAR processes. In order to achieve high alkene selectivity and extended on-stream stability, Pt must be alloyed with other elements such as Sn, Ge, or In [2], [3], [4], [5]. Despite alloying, catalyst deactivation due to coke formation still occurs. Therefore, the catalysts must be oxidatively regenerated and consecutively reduced in a flow containing H2. Such treatment results in a gradual loss of initial activity and reduced on-stream stability in consecutive DH cycles owing to restructuring of active Pt sites [6].
Compared to the non-oxidative dehydrogenation, the oxidative (ODH) route is more attractive from a thermodynamic point of view. The reaction is exothermic, hence higher conversion can be achieved at lower temperature. This approach, however, suffers from the low olefin selectivity at industrially relevant alkane conversions due to successive propene oxidation to carbon oxides. Among numerous catalytic systems having been tested in ODH of propane [7], [8], [9], [10], vanadium-based catalysts showed the best performance. In particular, highly dispersed VOx species on silica with high surface area afforded high propane conversion and propene selectivity [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. Propene yields up to 28% at propene selectivity of 70% were obtained over such catalysts.
Vanadium-based catalysts were also studied in DH of C3–C4 alkanes in the absence of gas-phase O2 [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. Under such conditions, the alkanes were oxidatively dehydrogenated with participation of lattice oxygen of VOx species. However, the activity decreased significantly with time on-stream as mobile lattice oxygen was depleted. Recently, stable and selective iso-butane DH to iso-butene was reported over highly dispersed VOx species on SiO2 supports when operating under oxygen-lean conditions (ratio of iso-C4H10/O2 > 10) [27]. Alkene selectivity above 80% at alkane conversion above 40% was achieved. Compared to VOx/Al2O3 catalysts used in [22], [23], [26] for DH of butanes, significantly lower amount of coke was formed. Suppressed coke formation resulted in a stable performance of VOx/SiO2 catalysts over at least 20 h on-stream compared to 30–60 min for VOx/Al2O3.
The aim of the present study was to explore the potential of highly dispersed VOx species supported on mesoporous SiO2 (MCM-41) for DH of propane in the absence of gas-phase O2 with a particular focus on a long-term stability. To this end, the DH reaction was investigated under industrially relevant conditions over several DH-regeneration cycles. The duration of each DH cycle was 24 h while regeneration in air flow lasted 3 h. For a comparative purpose, industrially relevant Cr- and Pt–Sn-based catalysts were also investigated under the same reaction conditions. Mechanistic origins governing catalysts stability within one DH cycle and over several DH-regeneration cycles were elucidated by time-resolved in situ UV/Vis analysis and temperature-programmed oxidation of catalysts after DH cycles.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalytic materials
Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) used as a template for the preparation of MCM-41 was dissolved in an aqueous solution of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). pH was adjusted to 11.5 with ammonia solution. The resulting mixture was stirred for 24 h at 300 K and filtered. Isolated solid was dried at 300 K for 5 h, then at 353 K for 24 h, and finally calcined in a muffle furnace at 823 K for 8 h to yield MCM-41 [28]. Supported catalysts were prepared according to the procedure described in [19]. Briefly, vanadium (Acros, 99%) and/or chromium (Fluka, purum >97%) acetyl acetonate was dissolved in 300 mL toluene (Roth, >99.5%, less than 50 ppm H2O) and 1.2 g MCM-41 was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 12 h during which the color intensity of the solution visibly degraded. Hereafter, the impregnated MCM-41 was isolated, washed in pure toluene for 30 min to remove physically adsorbed metal precursor, dried at 353 K for 8 h, and calcined in a muffle furnace at 823 K for 12 h. To increase metal loading, the procedure was repeated on a certain portion of calcined CrOx/MCM-41 and VOx/MCM-41. Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared according to [6] using commercial alumina carrier (NORPRO, Saint-Gobain, 93 m2/g).
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The specific surface areas of the pristine supports and the catalysts were calculated from nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms collected at 77 K on BELSORP-mini II (BEL Japan) applying the Brunauer, Emmet, and Teller (BET) equation for N2 relative pressure range of 0.05 < P/P0 < 0.30. The results obtained are summarized in Table 1.

The metal content of the calcined catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES, Varian 715-ES). Table 1 summarizes metal loadings in the calcined catalysts.
In situ UV/Vis experiments were performed using an AVASPEC fiber optical spectrometer (Avantes) equipped with a DH-2000 deuterium–halogen light source and a CCD array detector. BaSO4 was used as a white reference material. A high-temperature reflection UV/Vis probe consisting of six radiating optical fibers and 1 reading fiber was threaded through the furnace to face quartz reactor walls at the position where catalysts were held [29]. When analyzing carbon deposition during DH cycles, we defined relative reflectance (Rrel) as the reflectance ratio of the catalysts with coke deposits (RDH) to the fully oxidized ones (
) relative to BaSO4 as given in Eq. (1). From this reflectance, we calculated the relative Kubelka–Munk function F(Rrel) according to Eq. (2).

2.3. Continuous flow catalytic tests
Catalytic propane DH tests were carried out in a multi-channel reactor consisting of six plug flow fixed-bed quartz reactors (reactor i.d. = 4 mm) operated in parallel at a pressure of 1.2 bar. Up- and downstream gas lines and the electrical furnace hosting the reactors were confined inside an insulated cabinet preheated to 403 K. The gas flows through reactors were controlled by an in-house developed flow restrictor system evenly dividing the total flow into six. The set-up is fully automated and is capable of performing kinetic and characterization runs.
150 mg of fresh catalyst (sieve fraction 315–710 μm) was filled into each reactor. The catalysts were heated at 5 K min−1 to 823 K in an air flow (5 mL min−1 per reactor) followed by flushing with N2 for 20 min at the same temperature. Then, a mixture of 40 vol.% C3H8 in N2 was fed at a rate of 3 mL min−1 per reactor at the same reaction temperature. The reaction was run for 24 h followed by catalyst regeneration in an air flow for 3 h at 823 K. The regeneration/DH cycles were repeated three times. In order to investigate the effect of catalysts reduction on their DH performance, a separate experiment was performed in which catalysts were additionally reduced in H2/N2 = 30/70 flow (6 mL min−1 per reactor) for 1 h at 823 K between the oxidation and dehydrogenation cycles.
The feed components and the reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890) equipped with PLOT/Q (for CO2), HP-PLOT Al2O3 “KCl” (for hydrocarbons) and Molsieve 5 (for H2, O2, N2, and CO) columns, flame ionization, and thermal conductivity detectors. The GC analysis was carried out successively, reactor by reactor. The propane conversion was calculated from the inlet and outlet propane mole fractions (Eq. (3)). The propene yield and selectivity were determined using Eqs. (4), (5), respectively.

2.4. Quantification of carbon deposits
The amount of carbon deposits was determined from the amount of CO and CO2 evolved during temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) of the used catalysts. To this end, the catalysts were cooled down to room temperature in N2 after finishing the 1st or 4th DH run (see Section 2.3) and used for TPO measurements. The measurements were performed with an apparatus for temperature-programmed experiments containing eight individually heated plug flow fixed-bed quartz reactors (pm engineering, Germany). The catalysts were tested successively when heating reactors at 10 K min−1 to 1173 K in a mixture of O2/Ar = 10/90 flowing at 50 mL min−1 through each channel. Oxygen consumption and formation of reaction products were monitored by a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar 200). The following atomic mass units (AMUs) were analyzed: 44 (CO2), 40 (Ar), 32 (O2), 28 (CO, CO2), and 18 (H2O). The concentrations of O2, CO, and CO2 were determined from the respective AMUs using standard fragmentation patterns and sensitivity factors determined by analyzing calibration gas mixtures.
3. Results
3.1. Catalytic materials and their characterization
Catalytic materials used in this study and their selected physico-chemical characteristics are presented in Table 1. The specific surface areas (SBET) of the calcined MCM-41-supported catalysts were ca. 780 m2 g−1 while pristine MCM-41 showed SBET of 901 m2 g−1. Thus, the pore structure of the support was mostly preserved after impregnation and the following calcination. As expected, the SBET of Pt–Sn/Al2O3 was significantly lower (78 m2 g−1), which is in agreement with the results of previous thorough characterization of such catalyst by Iglesias-Juez et al. [6]. From the BET data and the content of chromium and vanadium, we calculated their apparent surface densities. The respective values for vanadium and chromium on VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 are 0.58 V nm−2 and 0.24 Cr nm−2. According to [30], [31], the maximum possible densities for a monolayer coverage by VOx and CrOx species on SiO2 are 1 V nm−2 and 0.54 Cr nm−2, respectively. Taking these values into account, it is possible that our catalysts possess only highly dispersed surface VOx and CrOx species. The distribution of surface VOx and CrOx species was further studied by UV/Vis spectroscopy. The in situ UV/Vis spectra of fresh VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 are shown in Fig. 1. The spectra were collected at 823 K in a flow of O2/N2 = 20/80. A broad absorption band at ca. 300 nm in the spectrum of VOx/MCM-41 is characteristic of highly dispersed dehydrated VO4 surface species [19], [32]. The in situ UV/Vis spectrum of CrOx/MCM-41 displays ligand-to-metal charge-transfer bands at approximately 250 and 360 nm. According to [33], such spectrum is typical for isolated CrOx species, in which Cr is in its highest oxidation state.

3.2. Catalytic performance
In order to prove if catalyst reduction is mandatory for olefin production and for on-stream stability, catalytic tests were performed both with oxidized and reduced catalysts (Section 2.3). Fig. 2 compares initial space–time yield (STY) and selectivity (S) to propene obtained within the first hour on-stream at 823 K over these materials. Besides propene (the main product), methane, ethylene, and ethane were also produced as side gas-phase products. In addition, very small amounts of carbon monoxide were formed over oxidized catalysts at the initial stage of the DH reaction.

The propene STY values obtained over oxidized catalysts were in the range between 0.15 and
. A similar productivity was reported for propane DH at 823 K in the absence of gas-phase O2 over a VOx/SiO2 catalyst containing 6.8 wt.% V2O5 [25]. A slight decrease in the productivity was observed over reduced V- and Cr-containing catalysts. This is probably due to the fact that both oxidative (with participation of lattice oxygen) and non-oxidative propane DH contribute to the initial propene production over the oxidized catalysts, while only non-oxidative DH occurs over the reduced ones. In contrast to the above catalysts, the productivity of Pt–Sn/Al2O3 approximately doubled when the catalyst was reduced in H2 before starting the DH experiment. Such increase in the activity owes to the formation of metallic Pt, which acts as active species for propane dehydrogenation [34], [35].
As shown in Fig. 2b, the propene selectivity was very similar over oxidized and reduced catalysts. The highest selectivity of nearly 100% was achieved over Pt–Sn/Al2O3. The propene selectivity over VOx/MCM-41 was slightly above 90% and higher than over CrOx/MCM-41 at a similar degree of propane conversion. The lower propene selectivity over VOx- and CrOx-based catalysts stemmed from their high cracking activity resulting in the formation of CH4, C2H4, and C2H6. Insights into the origins of these by-products over VOx/MCM-41 were derived from catalytic tests at different contact times. Fig. S1 compares the selectivity-conversion plots over the oxidized material. The data presented in this figure were obtained within the first hour on-stream. One can see that the propene selectivity decreases with rising propane conversion, while the selectivity toward the side-products does not show such trend. This indicates that the side-products originate from direct cracking of propane. The decrease in propene selectivity is probably due to higher selectivity to carbon deposits at higher propane conversion. Thus, CrOx and VOx species are intrinsically less selective for the DH reaction than metallic Pt species.
In order to gain insights into long-term catalysts stability, we performed four successive dehydrogenation runs (each 24 h long) interlaid with regeneration stages the latter consisting of oxidation or oxidation/reduction for oxidized or reduced catalysts, respectively. Fig. 3 shows the variation of propene yield and selectivity as a function of time on-stream. For all the catalysts studied, the yield in the 1st dehydrogenation cycle decreased with time due to catalyst deactivation by coke deposition as will be demonstrated in Section 3.3. Oxidized Pt–Sn/Al2O3 and CrOx/MCM-41 showed stronger decrease in the propene yield from 19.8% to 9.0% and from 24.8% to 10.3%, respectively, compared to the more stable oxidized VOx/MCM-41 showing the yield drop from 21.5% to 14.6%. The decrease in the yield with time on-stream became less pronounced over the pre-reduced catalysts, in particular over Pt–Sn/Al2O3 and CrOx/MCM-41.

Depending on the catalyst composition and pretreatment, the initial propene yield and selectivity can be completely or partially recovered after the catalyst regeneration according to the protocol described in Section 2.3. Despite the fact that the reductive treatment significantly improved the propene production over Pt–Sn/Al2O3 within the 1st dehydrogenation cycle, its activity and on-stream stability gradually decreased during the following cycles resulting in lower initial yields and greater drops of the yield for each consecutive cycle (Fig. 3). As a matter of fact, the overall propene production (total amount of propene formed within one DH cycle) over Pt–Sn/Al2O3 decreases through four DH cycles from 0.38 to 0.19 gC3H6 on the oxidized catalyst and from 1.1 to 0.83 gC3H6 on the reduced one (Fig. 4). Recently, Iglesias-Juez et al. [6] reported very similar trends in the on-stream performance of a Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst tested over 10 DH/regeneration cycles. The CrOx/MCM-41 catalyst also lost its activity and on-stream stability with rising number of DH/regeneration cycles. Contrarily, the propene production over both oxidized and reduced VOx/MCM-41 does not change noticeably over a series of four DH cycles (Fig. 4).

3.3. Analysis of formation and removal of carbon deposits
To verify if carbon deposits were formed during the DH reaction, we performed temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) after the 1st and 4th DH cycle (for experimental details see Section 2.4) over the catalysts used in their initially oxidized form for the DH reaction. CO and CO2 were detected in the TPO tests. Fig. 5 compares the COx profiles obtained over VOx/MCM-41, CrOx/MCM-41, and Pt–Sn/Al2O3. The TPO profiles of VOx/MCM-41 after the 1st cycle feature a single CO2 release event starting at 510 K and extending as a low flat shoulder to 880 K with the maximum at 670 K. For the same catalyst, the maximum of CO2 formation is shifted to 690 K after the 4th cycle. Release of CO also occurred in this temperature range with peaks maxima coincident with those of CO2. Even though the CO and CO2 peaks are shifted to a slightly higher temperature after the 4th DH cycle, the profiles are very similar in shape suggesting that the nature of carbon species does not significantly depend on the number of DH/regeneration cycles. This assumption is supported by the fact that the amounts of carbon formed in the 1st and 4th DH cycles are quite close as determined by integrating the COx profiles (Table 1). Moreover, the results of in situ UV/Vis analysis discussed in Section 4.2 support the above statement. CO and CO2 were also formed upon reoxidation of CrOx/MCM-41. However, their profiles are shifted to a lower temperature range (485–780 K) compared to those obtained on VOx/MCM-41. Only CO2 was detected during the TPO experiment over Pt–Sn/Al2O3. The release started at 550 K, proceeded through two maxima at 675 and 730 K suggesting the presence of at least two coke species, and was over by 870 K. The fact that almost all COx evolved below the catalysts regeneration temperature of 823 K indicates that the regeneration procedure applied in this study enables us to remove coke from the catalysts.

Both after the 1st and 4th DH cycle, the following order of activity for the formation of carbon deposits was obtained: VOx/MCM-41 > CrOx/MCM-41 > Pt–Sn/Al2O3. It should be stressed, however, that even the VOx/MCM-41 catalyst formed less than 2 wt.% of carbon deposits related to the total amount of propene formed. The specific amount of deposited carbon formed over VOx/MCM-41 after the 1st cycle was only 10% lower than measured on the same catalyst after the 4th cycle. Contrarily, CrOx/MCM-41 and Pt–Sn/Al2O3 deposited a half of carbon species in the 4th DH cycle compared to that after the 1st one. Lower amount of carbon deposits formed in the 4th DH cycle over these catalysts is a direct result of their activity loss between the 1st and 4th cycles (Fig. 4).
Further insight into the formation of carbon deposits was derived from the in situ UV/Vis analysis during DH cycles. It is important to emphasize that the position of the UV/Vis probes, the total flow, the reaction temperature, and the overall pressure were not changed in these experiments. Therefore, the observed changes in the UV/Vis spectra relate entirely to the changes occurred in the catalysts over the cycles. Fig. 6 shows the UV/Vis spectra of CrOx/MCM-41 expressed as the relative Kubelka–Munk (F(Rrel.)) function (Eq. (2)) after different times on-stream. Appearance of a band at ca. 370 nm after 30 min on-stream is a result of reduction of highly dispersed Cr6+ species to Cr3+. It should be noted that since we used the relative Kubelka–Munk function, the signal at 370 nm, which usually disappears upon reduction of Cr6+ species [36], is seen in our case as a positive band. Another consequence of Cr6+ to Cr3+ reduction is a broad signal emerging at 550 nm and extending to longer wavelengths. Actually, the UV/Vis spectrum of CrOx/MCM-41 reduced in H2 at 823 K and not exposed to the propane feed is very similar (Fig. 6), thus supporting the above assignment of the signals.

With time on-stream, F(Rrel.) increased across the entire range of the UV/Vis spectrum. This increase must have occurred due to the deposition of coke species because the UV/Vis spectrum of H2-treated CrOx/MCM-41 differs strongly from those of CrOx/MCM-41 after 1 and 24 h in the DH reaction. Three absorption bands can be identified in the latter spectra with the maxima at 325 and 450 nm and a broad signal in the 570–800 nm range. In one of the previous studies on propane DH over a Cr-containing catalyst [37], this signal was related to polyaromatic graphitic species, which also contribute to the absorption at lower wave lengths. The bands at 325 and 450 nm may be ascribed to low-condensed aromatic species.
The UV/Vis spectra of VOx/MCM-41 recorded at different times on-stream at 823 K are presented in Fig. 6. For comparative purposes, the spectrum of the catalyst reduced in H2 (see Section 2.3) is also shown in this figure. An increase in the relative Kubelka–Munk function in the 420–800 nm range after 0.5 h in H2 flow at 823 K is related to the reduction of V5+ to V4+/V3+ [28], [38], [39]. From this UV/Vis spectrum and our findings made in the in situ spectroscopic study of VOx/SiO2–TiO2 redox behavior [39], we conclude that the changes in the UV/Vis spectra of VOx/MCM-41 during DH reaction are related to the formation of coke species. When comparing the UV/Vis spectra of VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 under DH conditions, one can clearly see that the absorption band at 325 nm is not present in the former, that is, no or a lower fraction of low-condensed aromatic species should be expected on its surface. This assumption is indirectly supported by our TPO results showing that carbonaceous deposits on CrOx/MCM-41 are oxidized at lower temperatures than those on VOx/MCM-41.
4. Discussion
4.1. Active sites for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation
In the studies on non-oxidative alkane dehydrogenation over V- and Cr-based catalysts published up-to-date, the nature of the active sites is not uniquely defined [1], [8], [22], [23], [25], [37], [40], [41]. Both oxidized and reduced MeOx (Me = V or Cr) as well as deposited carbon species were proposed as active sites for the dehydrogenation. In [37], the catalytic activity of a Cr-based catalyst in propane DH was observed to pass through a maximum during time on-stream, suggesting that coke species were the active sites. Later, some authors of [37] performed a deeper mechanistic study on the role of coke species over a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst in ethane DH using isotopically labeled reactants [42]. They concluded that carbon species are not responsible for the dehydrogenation. It is reasonable to assume that the reaction mechanism over VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 in our work is similar to that reported in the latter study. In addition, our catalysts did not show initial or delayed activation, so we can exclude carbon deposits as the main active dehydrogenation species.
In order to estimate the intrinsic activity of VOx, CrOx, or Pt, we performed a series of catalytic tests with propane conversions below 10% and calculated apparent turn over frequencies (TOFs) during the first hour on-stream. The TOF value is the number of propane molecules converted per metal atom per second assuming that all metal atoms are available for the reaction and possess the same activity. Fig. S2 compares the TOF over oxidized and reduced catalysts. As expected from the STY values given in Fig. 2, CrOx/MCM-41 and VOx/MCM-41 showed very similar intrinsic activity while that of Pt–Sn/Al2O3 was 70–100 times higher. If activation of the C–H bond in C3H8 is the rate-limiting step in dehydrogenation over the catalysts studied, the high intrinsic activity of Pt–Sn/Al2O3 would be either due to higher collision frequency of C3H8 with active species or the lower activation energy. The latter is indirectly supported by DFT calculations of Yang et al. [43]. They reported that propane activation occurs easier over stepped Pt surfaces compared to the flat ones. Moreover, according to [6], Pt–Sn/Al2O3 should possess Pt nano-species rich in coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms.
The following discussion is aimed to elucidate the role of reduced and oxidized MeOx species in the DH reaction. We will start with noticing that trace amounts of CO were observed within first 3 h of DH reaction over VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 indicating that lattice oxygen of oxidized MeOx participates in the activation of propane. On the other hand, no detectable formation of CO was observed over the reduced materials. The corresponding conversions of propane and propene yields are shown in Fig. S3 (see Supporting information). Apparently, oxidized CrOx and VOx species are more active than the reduced ones. At longer time on-stream, the difference in propane conversion and propene yield between oxidized and reduced catalysts gradually disappeared as oxidized MeOx species were reduced in the C3H8 stream (Fig. S3). This leveling off suggests that the nature of active sites formed upon reduction of fully oxidized MeOx is similar irrespective of the reducing agent (H2 or C3H8).
In contrast to VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41, the activity of Pt–Sn/Al2O3 was increased by a factor of 1.8 after the catalyst reduction by H2. The increase in the activity results from the formation of metallic Pt and/or Pt–Sn alloys. Since the activity of oxidized Pt–Sn/Al2O3 did not increase with time on-stream (Fig. 3), we can assume that the active metallic species are either not formed in significant number in situ during propane DH or become quickly deactivated by carbonaceous deposits. However, during the H2 treatment, lattice oxygen of PtOx and SnOx species is easily removed as water at 823 K.
4.2. Origins of catalyst deactivation
In the following discussion, we shall elucidate the origins of the catalysts deactivation within one DH cycle. As evident from Fig. 3, both reduced and oxidized catalysts lose their activity with time on-stream. Based on previous studies on Cr- and Pt-based catalysts [8], [22], [23], [37], [40], [41] as well as our UV/Vis and TPO results (Section 3.3), the activity decrease within one DH cycle must be related to deposition of carbonaceous species. However, the catalysts differ strongly in the rate of deactivation and the amount of deposits formed. The propene yield in the 1st DH cycle over oxidized VOx/MCM-41, CrOx/MCM-41, and Pt–Sn/Al2O3 decreased during 24 h by a factor of 1.5, 2.4, and 2.2, respectively. It is noteworthy that the most stable VOx/MCM-41 also produced the highest amount of carbon deposits (Table 1). The same trend was observed in the 4th DH cycle. Therefore, not only the amount of surface carbon species, but also their nature may determine the deactivation rate. As discussed above, the results of TPO and UV/Vis analyses suggest that CrOx/MCM-41 formed polycyclic aromatic coke species with the lower degree of condensation than on VOx/MCM-41. However, this may be not the only difference in the nature of carbon deposits on these two catalysts.
The oxidation state of MeOx species also determines the deactivation behavior. Fig. 7 compares the ratio of propene yields obtained after approximately 30 min and 24 h on-stream over oxidized and reduced catalysts in 4 DH cycles. This ratio is a measure of catalyst deactivation: The higher the ratio, the stronger the deactivation. In the 1st DH cycle, the yields ratio for oxidized and reduced VOx/MCM-41 was 1.5 and 1.3, respectively, that is, VOx/MCM-41 slightly improved its on-stream stability when used in a reduced form. The effect of H2 treatment on the propene formation over CrOx/MCM-41 was even higher: The corresponding values were 2.5 and 1.4. Thus, the oxidation state of MeOx species and the nature of carbon deposits are two important factors governing the catalyst deactivation within one DH cycle.

Now we shall turn our attention to the catalysts stability over several DH/regeneration cycles, which is an important characteristic when viewed in prospects of commercial application. As shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, both oxidized and reduced Pt–Sn/Al2O3 and CrOx/MCM-41 gradually lost their initial and on-stream activity from the 1st to 4th DH cycles, while VOx/MCM-41 did not exhibit such deactivation behavior. The TPO experiments performed on the catalysts oxidized before the DH reaction clearly indicate that regeneration conditions were appropriate to fully remove carbonaceous deposits since for all catalysts the bulk of COx profiles laid below the regeneration temperature (Fig. 5). Therefore, coking is not responsible for the observed loss of activity from cycle to cycle. Iglesias-Juez et al. [6] studied similar Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst and also observed a decrease in its activity over 10 DH cycles. They concluded that enrichment of the alloy with Sn and to a lower extent Pt sintering are responsible for the activity loss. It is likely that the same deactivation mechanisms operate on the Pt–Sn catalyst used in our work.
In contrast to Pt–Sn/Al2O3, VOx/MCM-41 and CrOx/MCM-41 showed stronger resistance to deactivation in four consecutive DH/regeneration cycles. The former was fully restoring its initial activity after regeneration, while the latter was losing some of it, but definitely less than Pt–Sn/Al2O3 (Fig. 3). What changes occurred (or did not) in these two catalysts with time on-stream? To answer this question, we analyzed their UV/Vis spectra before DH and after the 3rd oxidative regeneration (Fig. 1). No changes were identified in the respective spectra of VOx/MCM-41 proving that the nature of VOx species was not changed, that is, they remained highly dispersed. As a result, this catalyst showed stable performance in propane DH over the four cycles. Not only the propene production, but also the carbon deposition was not notably influenced by oxidative regeneration (Table 1). UV/Vis spectra recorded at different times on-stream during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd DH cycles are compared in Fig. S4. The temporal evolution of the corresponding F(Rrel.) at 700 nm is also shown in Fig. S5. Since the intensity and the temporal profile of F(Rrel.) after the 1st DH cycle was only slightly lower than those after the 2nd and 3rd DH cycles, it can be concluded that oxidative regeneration of VOx/MCM-41 does not change the nature of carbon deposits and the rate of their formation. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the same amount of surface carbon was formed over this catalyst in the 1st and 4th DH cycles (Table 1).
When comparing the UV/Vis spectra of CrOx/MCM-41 in the fresh state and after the 3rd oxidative regeneration, the spectrum of the latter comprises an additional broad band of low intensity appearing in the 580–700 nm region. According to [33], this band in the oxidized catalyst is induced by nanocrystalline Cr2O3. Based on this assignment, highly dispersed CrOx species have aggregated into larger particles during successive DH/regeneration cycles, which is surprising recalling the low apparent surface density of Cr on CrOx/MCM-41 (0.24 Cr nm−2). From a kinetic point of view, agglomeration of CrOx species reduces the number of active DH sites since a certain fraction of chromium in the bulk of Cr2O3 particles is not accessible for reaction. Similar results were also reported for ethane and propane DH over CrOx/Al2O3 [41]. This suggests that highly dispersed CrOx species sinter irrespective of the support nature. Based on the above discussion, we conclude that the origin of CrOx/MCM-41 activity loss over several DH/regeneration cycles lays in CrOx sintering.
Summarizing our main findings, we shall highlight that (i) both oxidized and reduced MeOx species can function as active sites for propane dehydrogenation with the former being more active; (ii) deactivation of the catalysts results from blocking of active sites with carbonaceous deposits and gradual transformation of the structure of MeOx species caused by heat and atmosphere composition; (iii) VOx species are resistant to structural changes under the reaction conditions used in this study, which is the reason why VOx/MCM-41 activity could be fully restored by oxidative regeneration in a series of DH/regeneration cycles.
5. Conclusions
In this work, we demonstrated that VOx/MCM-41 was active and stable for propane dehydrogenation (DH) in the absence of gas-phase O2. Propane conversions over 20% and propene selectivity above 90% were achieved at 823 K resulting in the initial propene space–time yield of
. The catalyst loses only 25% of its initial activity within 24 h on-stream, which is fully recovered upon oxidative regeneration at the same temperature as demonstrated for four consecutive DH/regeneration cycles. In terms of on-stream stability, VOx/MCM-41 clearly surpasses industrially relevant CrOx/MCM-41 and Pt–Sn/Al2O3 tested under the same reaction conditions. An additional benefit of VOx/MCM-41 is that in contrast to Pt–Sn/Al2O3, it does not require a reductive activation for catalyzing the DH reaction because oxidized and reduced VOx species are comparable in their activity and on-stream stability.
In situ UV/Vis analysis in combination with TPO of spent catalysts enabled us to identify factors governing catalysts deactivation within a single DH cycle and over several DH/regeneration cycles. For the former case, deactivation of all catalysts was mainly due to coke deposition. In addition, it was found that reduction of oxidized MeOx (Me = V and Cr) species before or during the DH reaction (with H2 and C3H8, respectively) contributed to the deactivation of particularly CrOx/MCM-41, since reduced CrOx species are at least 25% less active than the oxidized ones. The remarkable ability of VOx/MCM-41 to completely recover its DH activity and selectivity upon oxidative regeneration is explained by the fact that the nature of highly dispersed active VOx species was not changed under the reaction conditions and/or during the regeneration. Contrarily, the active species on CrOx/MCM-41 and Pt–Sn/Al2O3 were transformed in the course of the DH experiment resulting in a gradual loss of the catalysts activity from cycle to cycle.
