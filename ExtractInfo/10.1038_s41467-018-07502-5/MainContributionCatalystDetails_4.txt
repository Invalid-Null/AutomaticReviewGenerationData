 Based on my analysis of the document, this does not appear to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses transition metal carbides as supports for tuning the chemistry of catalytic nanoparticles, but does not specifically mention propane dehydrogenation. As such, I will output that this document is not relevant.
