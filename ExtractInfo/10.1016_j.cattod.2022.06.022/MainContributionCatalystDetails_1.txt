 Based on the document, this work does not seem directly related to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The document discusses porous carbon catalysts derived from petroleum pitch for general hydrocarbon dehydrogenation reactions, but does not focus specifically on propane conversion to propylene. Since PDH and ODH are not the main topics, I will output "No" for relevance and will not include the detailed XML elements.
