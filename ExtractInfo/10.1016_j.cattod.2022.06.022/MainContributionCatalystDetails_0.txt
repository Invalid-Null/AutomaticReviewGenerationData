 Unfortunately the document does not seem to be related to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses porous carbon-based catalysts derived from petroleum pitch for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, but does not provide details on the conversion, selectivity, stability, or other metrics for evaluating propane dehydrogenation performance. Since the relevance criteria are not met, I will not extract catalyst details or performance enhancements.
