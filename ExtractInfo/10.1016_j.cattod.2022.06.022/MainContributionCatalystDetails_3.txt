 Based on the details provided in the document, this does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The document discusses carbon-based catalysts for dehydrogenation reactions in general, but does not focus specifically on propane dehydrogenation. Since the relevance criteria are not met, I will omit the detailed XML output.
