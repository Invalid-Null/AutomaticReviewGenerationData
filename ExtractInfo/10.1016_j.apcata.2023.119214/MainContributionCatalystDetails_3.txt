 Based on the document, this does not seem related to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically. The document focuses on improving propylene yield from fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of vacuum gas oil (VGO). While propylene can be produced from propane dehydrogenation, that is not the focus here.
