The document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation, as it does not mention propane, propylene, PDH, or ODH. The document appears to be about catalysts for some unspecified reaction, but without any mention of propane, propylene or dehydrogenation, I cannot conclude that it is relevant to the propane dehydrogenation processes.
