Abstract
Supported noble metal catalysts are extensively used for propane dehydrogenation in both the academy and industry. When the active components are fixed, the variation and improvement of the support will significantly affect the performance of the catalyst. Here we first prepared a series of PtSn/TS-1 catalysts with systematically controllable sizes of TS-1 zeolite supports. The particle sizes of the as-prepared TS-1 zeolite supports are from 100 nm to 5.72 μm. The TS-1 supports exhibited only weak acid sites, which avoids some side-reactions such as cracking and coking. The minimal size TS-1 (∼100 nm)-supported PtSn catalyst gave the best catalytic performance and almost preserved the activity after a four-cycle reaction. The improved activity is ascribed to the hierarchically porous structure of the small-sized TS-1 sample, whereby diffusion hinders the mass transportation no more as certified by the Weisz–Prater criterion. The relationship between propane conversion and support size was fitted by a quadratic function. To further investigate the deactivation process, the species of deposited carbon was analyzed by in situ Raman methods. The work gave a new strategy for improving the catalytic performance of conventional supported catalysts in the PDH reaction, as well as some other heterogeneous catalysis.

1. Introduction
In recent decades, ample shale gas reserves are continuously being explored the world over, which provides a stable and cheap source for the efficient utilization of alkanes, including propane. Propylene is among the most important basic petrochemical materials due to its plentiful downstream products. Consequently, dehydrogenation of propane, as a new way to increase the production of propylene, has attracted steadily rising interest in the chemical industry.
Platinum- or chromium oxide-based catalysts are most widely used in commercial propane dehydrogenation (PDH) processes [1]. As an environmentally friendly material, the former achieves much wider application. After introduction of tin oxide, PtSn-based catalysts exhibit higher catalytic activity and better tolerance of coke formation [2]. To further increasing the production of propylene, a great deal of effort has been devoted to improving the catalytic performance of PtSn-based catalysts. The mechanism for the activation of CH bonds in propane has been investigated in detail [3], [4].
Because the dehydrogenation of C3H8 is endothermic and requires a high temperature (about 863 K), deep dehydrogenation also happens with the by-product of deposited coke; the lifetime of commercial Al2O3-supported catalysts is too short to resist deactivation under reaction conditions [5], [6]. In comparison, with intrinsic pores of molecular size, zeolites have been widely used in the petrochemical industry as supports or solid-acid catalysts [7], [8], [9]. It has been demonstrated that zeolites are composed of SiO4− or AlO4− tetrahedra, and their ordered multi-membered ring channel system is regarded as inhibiting the formation of carbon species [10], [11]. However, the channels of microporous aluminosilicates are surrounded by catalytically active strong acid sites, which cause the cracking of alkanes and cut back the desired products [12]. To address this problem, methods are still needed to reduce the acid content and strength by adding alkali (earth) metal. The application of new zeolites with lower acidity is still promising and important to the main reaction.
In addition, the kinetic diameter of propane is 0.47 nm, which is smaller than but very close to the pore diameter of ZSM5 zeolite (0.51 × 0.56 nm) [13], [14]. Their internal pores make the transfer of propane or propylene difficult, and the drawback of diffusion also causes partial poor distribution of the product, which further hinders the improvement of catalytic performance. Fortunately, recent progress in zeolites points to a new strategy for overcoming this restriction by integrating micro- and mesopores [15], [16], [17]. A hierarchical porous molecular sieve can be prepared by controlling the morphology of zeolites with ultrathin slices or direct creation of a secondary pore system. Al-containing zeolites usually lead to further side reactions such as coking of isomerization, whereas TiOx (x < 2) species are believed to accelerate the selectivity of propylene and stability of the catalyst [18]. Electrons can transfer from TiOx species to Pt atoms, and thus electron-rich Pt particles tend to inhibit the adsorption of propylene and improve the selectivity to propylene
As is known, the catalytic performance is significantly affected by the electronic interactions between metal and support in heterogeneous catalysis [19], [20], [21], [22]. For the traditional PtSn-based catalysts, improvement in the type or morphology of the support is a promising method for achieving better catalytic performance.
In the present work, a series of TS-1 zeolites were hydrothermally synthesized with methodically controllable crystal sizes and then used for the first time as supports for PtSn in the reaction.
Importantly, this strategy allows supports with similar micropore systems but different crystal sizes to be targeted for better catalytic performance. The catalysts were characterized by means of SEM, XRD, BET, UV-DRS, Raman, TEM, and XPS. Their microscopic structures are similar, such as the coordination state of titanium, the area of micropores, and acidity. The external surface area of as-prepared TS-1 zeolite increases with the reduction of crystal size, because a secondary mesopore system is gradually formed among the small crystal particles. The hierarchical pore system is beneficial for mass transfer and provides extra interfacial area for the contact of active components and reactants. Moreover, the TS-1 sample has a three-dimensional channel system similar to that of ZSM5 MFI zeolite but exhibits only weak acid sites, which avoids some side reactions such as cracking and coking. Supports with suitable physical morphology (small crystal size accompanied by hierarchical pore) and chemical properties (acidity) are of fundamental importance for the PDH reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
All TS-1 zeolites were synthesized according to the traditional hydrothermal method with a permanent Si/Ti molar ratio of 50 [23], [24], [25]. By changing the molar ratio of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH), and water in the sol system, the crystal size of TS-1 could be adjusted. Moreover, addition of isopropanol and variation of synthesis temperature also led to different crystal sizes. In a typical synthesis, 10 g of TEOS together with tetrabutyl titanate (TBOT) was dissolved in an aqueous solution of TPAOH (14.6 g, 20 wt.%). The mixture was stirred in ice water for 1 h and heated to 70 °C for 3 h. Then 12 g of isopropanol (IPA) was added and stirred for 1 h. The molar composition of the final gel was 1 SiO2:0.02 TiO2:4 IPA:0.3 TPAOH:35 H2O. The solution was subjected to a hydrothermal crystallization process at 170 °C for 4 days. After repeated washing and drying, the precursors were calcined in air at 550 °C to get TS-1 zeolites of 100 nm. The absence of isopropanol in the gel leads to the growth of TS-1 zeolites from 100 to 200 nm and the size of the zeolite can further increase to 300 nm when the amount of TPAOH is reduced by 20%. When the mixture with a molar composition of 1 SiO2:0.02 TiO2:0.6 TPAOH:35 H2O was directly stirred at 60 °C for 5 h, the final size of the TS-1 zeolite is 1 μm. The addition of isopropanol (1 SiO2:4 IPA) results in smaller TS-1 zeolites (500 nm) and the substitution of TEOS for silica sol assists in obtaining the largest TS-1 crystals of 5.72 μm. The nominal chemical compositions of the starting materials for the synthesis of TS-1 is given in Table S1 in the Supplementary Material.
Bimetallic PtSn/TS-1 catalysts were prepared by the incipient-wetness impregnation method. A water solution of H2PtCl6·6H2O and SnCl4·5H2O with the molar ratio 1:2 was added dropwise to the prepared TS-1 zeolites. After constant stirring, the mixture was treated by ultrasonic vibration and dried at 50 °C for 48 h. Finally, the mixture was roasted at 773 K for 4 h to get ae series of PtSn/TS-1 catalysts with different support sizes. The contents of platinum and tin in the final catalyst were fixed at 0.5 and 0.6 wt.%, respectively.
2.2. Characterization
Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained on a SU8010 apparatus operating at 5 kV. The samples were coated with gold before the SEM measurements. The X-ray diffraction patterns of PtSn/TS-1(x) catalysts were obtained on a Shimadzu X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm, 40 kV, 40 mA). The scanning range 2θ was 5° to 50° with a rate of 5°/min. The textural properties of PtSn/TS-1 catalysts were determined on an automatic N2 adsorption–desorption instrument (Tristar II 2020). Before measurement, the catalysts were degassed under vacuum at 350 °C for 4 h. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method was used to calculate the specific surface areas of the samples and the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model was employed to calculate the pore size distribution in the desorption branches of the isotherms. Diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra of the catalysts were recorded using a Hitachi U-4100 spectrometer at 200–800 nm. The (in situ) Raman spectra of the catalysts were recorded on a Renishaw inVia Reflex Raman spectrometer. The laser line at 532 nm was used as the exciting source with a maximum of 1 mW at the surface of the sample. Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3 TPD) measurements were performed to analyze the acidity of catalysts. A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to record the TPD profiles from 100 to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements of the catalysts were carried out on a JEOL JEM-2100 electron microscope equipped with a field emission source working at 200 kV. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were obtained with a PerkinElmer PHI-1600 ESCA spectrometer using MgKα radiation (hγ = 1253.6 eV). The values of binding energies were calibrated with the C1s peak of contaminant carbon at 284.6 eV.
2.3. Catalytic activity tests
The catalytic performance of PtSn/TS-1 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation was tested in a quartz tubular microreactor with a fixed bed. Before evaluation, the catalyst was prereduced in H2 at 773 K for 4 h. The reaction was carried out under the conditions following: reaction temperature 863 K, atmospheric pressure, feed gas including C3H8, H2, and N2, molar ratio of C3H8:H2:N2 1:1:4, WHSV 3 h−1. A SP-2100 gas chromatograph was employed to analyze all reaction products. Gas phase products were separated on an aluminum capillary column and their concentrations were detected by an H-ionization flame detector. The propane conversion was determined from the inlet and outlet propane mole fractions as

3. Results
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of as-prepared PtSn/TS-1 catalysts are presented in Fig. 1. We can see that all catalysts exhibit similar cubelike morphology but varying dimensions. The results not only give an intuitive and visual impression of the crystal sizes and morphologies, but also give the size distributions counted from each image. The TS-1 zeolites have an average crystal diameter of 100 nm initially and increase by 2, 3, or even 50 times when the synthesis conditions are changed; the largest TS-1 crystals are approximately 5.7 μm. Meanwhile, each sample was found with a uniform size distribution. It could be concluded that the highly textured TS-1 zeolites were systematically controlled with different sizes by hydrothermal methods.

The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of PtSn/TS-1 catalysts with different crystal sizes are shown in Fig. 2. All PtSn/TS-1 samples exhibit typical MFI-type XRD patterns at (011), (020), (051), (−303), (−313), and (−532), as observed in the 2θ ranges of 7.8–8.7° and 22–25°, implying the high purity of catalysts [26]. No obvious XRD peaks due to titanium can be identified in any of the catalysts, indicating that it is incorporated into the lattice or highly dispersed in the form of very small titania crystals. Dissection of diffraction peaks indicates that the smaller samples show a lower diffraction intensity generally, which indicates a lower degree of relative crystallinity. In contrast, the larger samples exhibit higher peak intensities and decreased linewidths. Taking the largest TS-1 zeolite as a reference, the crystallinity of the smallest TS-1 is evaluated to be approximately 54.7%. It is obvious that the diffraction peaks broaden and attenuate as the TS-1 crystal size decreases. Particularly, no peaks of crystalline platinum or tin are detected in any sample, which indicates a very small size of these. The active components may be evenly dispersed on the surface of TS-1 zeolite.

Physical properties of the catalysts were measured by nitrogen sorption methods as revealed in Fig. 4. The catalysts with crystal size 5.72 and 1.10 μm show almost no difference between the adsorption and desorption branches. As the crystal sizes decrease further, the type IV isotherms with H1 type hysteresis loop grow gradually, which is a peculiar feature of materials with mesoporous structure [27], [28], [29]. The presence of mesoporosity in the small-sized sample is also certified by the BJH pore-size distribution in Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Material.

The BET surface areas of catalysts corresponding to different crystal sizes are listed in Table 1. Surface areas are calculated using the BET method over the range P/P0 = 0.01–1. The catalysts with the smallest crystal size show the largest BET surface area of 431.6 m2/g and the surface area gradually decreases as the particle size increases. According to the results of t-plot micropore area, the catalysts show similar micropore area but variant external surface area, which means the diminished crystal size does not damage the interior structure of the TS-1 sample, but enlarges the external surface area for the loading of active centers. At the same time, the length of inner pores is shortened and the inner surface is easier to reach, which is beneficial for the diffusion of both reactant and product molecules. It is also a subsidiary proof of the reduction of crystal size.

To characterize the acidic properties of different catalysts, NH3 TPD was employed to analyze the strength of acid sites on the surface. The peak positions at different temperatures represent the different strengths of acidity in general [30]. The PtSn/TS-1 samples have no strong acid sites, as evident from the NH3 TPD curves shown in Fig. 5A. Only one desorption peak at 160 °C is observed, corresponding to a weak acid site. The introduction of titanium into the pure silica system does not result in strong acid sites, since there are no desorption peaks above 300 °C. In contrast, there are two peaks of the PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst at 240 and 500 °C, representing weak and strong acid sites, respectively [31]. The replacement of Si4+ with Al3+ is accompanied by additional protons (H+), which results in a higher intensity of acidity in ZSM-5. The constituent elements of support in different catalysts can influence their acidity.

All the PtSn/TS-1 catalysts show an obvious absorption band in the range 200–250 nm, which is caused by charge transfer from O2- to Ti4+ within the framework of Ti(OSi)4 [32], [33], [34]. The band is also extended to low-energy absorbance ranges at about 330 nm. The red shift reveals octahedral coordination of partial titanium species. This indicates that there are also some extraframework titanium species in the TS-1 samples.
The frameworks of catalysts are also characterized by UV Raman spectroscopy. Raman bands at 810 and 978 cm−1 are ascribed to the siloxane linkage and the surface SiOH stretching of silanol groups, respectively [35]. The two bands at 530 and 1125 cm−1 should be attributed to symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibration of the TiOSi band [36]. The formation of TiOSi species certifies that the titanium cations are highly dispersed and doped into the silica skeleton in a state of tetrahedral coordination [37]. According to the UV–vis and Raman results, both framework and extraframework titanium species exist in the catalysts.
Because of their sensitivity to surface species at a depth of 1–5 nm [38], [39], X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses of the catalysts are also implemented to analyze the surface components and their chemical states. The results show different elements such as carbon, oxygen, and silicon. Almost no signals of surface titanium can be detected, as shown in Fig. 8, which suggests that titanium does not accumulate but cooperates with silica to form the TiOSi band in the micropore structure. Due to their even distributions and low content, the Pt/Sn signals are hard to detect, as shown in Fig. 8a, but close inspection of the XPS data confirms the existence of Pt and Sn species.

The binding energies in the range from 65 to 80 eV are ascribed to the Pt4f7/2 and Pt4f5/2 levels of the catalysts (Fig. 8d and e). Peak deconvolution shows that the two Pt4f peaks could be divided into four peaks using Gauss–Lorentz peak fitting, namely, the chemical states Pt0 at 71.2 eV of 4f7/2 and 74.5 eV of 4f5/2, and Pt2+ at 72.8 eV of 4f7/2 and 76.0 eV of 4f5/2 [40], [41], [42]. The XPS data indicate the presence of both oxide and metallic platinum. For the PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalyst, Pt0 is the predominant component and Pt2+ is a minor component, which coincides with the used PtSn/TS-1(5.72 μm) counterpart.
Both in the large (5.72 μm) and small (100 nm) TS-1 supports, the tin species mainly remain in the oxide state. The two peaks at 486.3 and 487.3 eV are assigned to SnII and SnIV, respectively. The lower binding energy peak at 485.4 eV is ascribed to Sn0 in PtSn alloy, which may poison the active sites permanently [43], [44], [31]. The proportions of different chemical states have also been calculated from the area of Sn3d peaks. The content ratio of oxidized tin species (SnII + SnIV) to total tin species (Sn0 + SnII + SnIV) is 100% and 97.3% in the large (5.72 μm) and small (100 nm) TS-1 zeolite-supported catalysts, respectively. The tin oxide serves as an auxiliary to cooperate with platinum in PDH reactions for better catalytic performance.
Fig. 9A and B shows propane conversion and propylene selectivity as a function of reaction time on PtSn/TS-1 catalysts with different crystal sizes, respectively. PtSn/TS-1(5.72 μm) exhibits apparent low activity both in conversion and in selectivity. The conversion of propane drops from 30.3% to 17.1% in 7 h. Meanwhile, the smaller samples exhibit better catalytic performance. For the PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalyst, the initial conversion of propane can reach as high as 53.5% and still remains at 47.7% after 7 h reaction. It is also certified by the calculated TOFs for the conversion of propane with respect to reaction time, as shown in Fig. 9E. A relatively high TOF is obtained on smaller catalysts, and it slowly decreases with increasing reaction time.

It is obvious that the activity is relevant to the crystal size of TS-1; all other samples with medium size show middle activity. As shown in Fig. 9C, the initial conversion of propane decreases with increasing crystal size. When observed on a larger scale, their relationship could be fitted by a quadratic function as follows:
(4)
where x is the diameter of the TS-1 crystal and y is the corresponding conversion of propane. The equation of the curve is achieved using the polynomial fitting method in Origin software. The equation is an approximation to the relation between the true diffusion process and the particle size. As a whole, it could be used to predicate the general tendency of propane conversion over catalysts of different sizes. It can be concluded that the crystal size has a distinct influence on the activity of the catalysts. Their diminished size introduces mesopores among crystals, as certified by N2 sorption results. The hierarchical pores are beneficial to the entry of reactant molecules and the departure of product molecules. To achieve better catalytic performance, a smaller support is necessary. Here, PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalyst is continuously regenerated and tested. After the redispersion of PtSn active components and coke combustion, the catalyst still preserves its better catalytic performance, which makes it suitable for commercial application. Compared with traditional PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts, the PtSn/TS-1 catalyst shows both higher selectivity and conversion due to electronic and steric factors. As shown in Fig. S2, the lifetime of conventional PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst is too short because the side reaction of coking happens continuously. The activities and deactivation rates for the as-prepared catalysts in this work and the results in the literature are collected in Table S2. The PtSn/TS-1 catalyst shows a relatively low deactivation rate constant (kd) without modification by third alkali metals.
As discussed above, the Ti species in TS-1 are located in and out of the framework. Based on previous studies, the framework Ti in TS-1 could increase the electron density of Au [45], [46]. Because of the approximate unsaturated outer electron configuration of Au (5d106s1) and Pt (5d96s1), their electron density may be increased in theory. In addition, the extraframework Ti (TiOx) species also enhance the electron density of Pt and the electron-rich Pt is beneficial for improving the selectivity to propylene [18]. It is also worthwhile to note that the acid properties of the catalysts have a large effect on the catalytic performance including propane conversion, selectivity to propylene, and stability of the catalysts. As can be observed in Fig. 9F, the conversion of propane over PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst drops dramatically with increasing reaction time. Moreover, the selectivity to propylene is also much lower than that of PtSn/TS-1 catalysts.
As certified by the NH3 TPD results above, there are many strong acid sites in PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst, which cause side reactions of cracking and coking to a large extent. The selectivity to propylene is therefore very low at the beginning of the reaction. The propylene selectivity increases when the active sites for cracking and coking are gradually covered by the deposited carbon [30]. However, the deposited carbon also brings about significant reduction in propane conversion. The modification of acidity in the support is very important for improving propane conversion, selectivity to propylene, and the lifetime of the catalyst.
4. Discussion
The low activity of PtSn/TS-1(5.72 μm) for propane dehydrogenation also indicates the presence of mass transport limitations in the case of large zeolite-supported catalysts.
The TS-1 zeolites with smaller size exhibit hierarchical porosity: the intercrystalline channels are primary micropores, while the intracrystalline holes become secondary mesopores. The higher surface area and the existence of hierarchical porosity in smaller TS-1 zeolites result in a significant improvement in catalytic performance. The reactants on PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalysts are more apt to contact the active centers; the conversion of propane is therefore higher. The micropores become short with the decrease of crystal size, while the intercrystalline diffusion resistance declines too. Accordingly, we can assume that the active components are fully accessible to reactants through the micropores of the catalysts with small crystal size.
To investigate the effect of internal diffusion limitations in different dimensional zeolites, the mass transportation was calculated on the TS-1(100 nm) and TS-1(5.72 μm) supported PtSn catalysts according to the Weisz–Prater criterion [31], [47],
(5)
where −rA = 3.53 mol/(m3cat·s), observed reaction rate of propane; R = 1.01 × 10−7 m, radius of zeolites; CAS = 6.67 mol/m3, gas concentration of propane at the catalyst surface; De = 7.30 × 10−12 m2/s, diffusion coefficient, cited from previous work in the literature [48], because of the similar MFI structure of TS-1 and Silicalite-1. The value of CWP is calculated to be 7.41 × 10−4 < 1. Consequently, internal diffusion limitation is absent by the application of the criterion to PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalyst. However, the diffusion restriction appears when the Weisz–Prater parameter is calculated for PtSn/TS-1(5.72 μm) catalyst, which gives a value of 1.34 (>1) and evidences the presence of internal diffusion limitations. Therefore, crystallite size affects the internal diffusion based on the kinetic data calculated above, which leads to remarkable differences in the activity of different catalysts.
Low resistance to intercrystalline diffusion facilitates the departure of propylene from the active sites, which avoids some further side reactions, such as coking. Hence, the lifetime of smaller TS-1 zeolite-supported PtSn catalysts is much longer than that of the larger samples, as discussed above.
As coke plays a significant role in the deactivation of the propane dehydrogenation process, its detailed composition and formation deserve systematic investigation. In situ characterization studies offer the opportunity to investigate the nature of catalysts under controlled conditions [49]. In order to further analyze the process of deactivation and the species of deposited coke, in situ Raman studies were performed on the spent PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalyst.
Before testing, about 5 mg of fresh catalyst was placed in the microreactor and sealed by a UV-transparent window for the entry of simultaneous transmission of a laser. The reactor is surrounded by an oven to provide heat for the reaction. The initial reacting atmosphere is only argon, and no Raman bands was detected after activation by a 532 nm laser source (Fig. 10). When a mixture of propane and hydrogen was introduced into the system, two Raman peaks at 1600 and 1370 cm−1 were detected and increased gradually.

Fig. 10. In situ Raman spectra of the PDH process over PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalyst.
As shown in Fig. 11, the intense peak centered at 1600 cm−1 is ascribed to the G band, which is caused by the stretching vibration of the CC sp2 bond in the graphite lattice [50]. The band observed at 1370 cm−1 is assigned to the D band, which corresponds to microcrystals or the edges of the graphite lattice with low symmetry [51], [52], [53].

Fig. 11. The Raman spectra of spent PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalysts with distinguished bands.
Both the disordered carbon and graphite exist in the spent sample, as shown in the Raman spectra. During the reaction time, the intensity of the D band was apparently lower than that of the G band in the spectral region. The textural properties of deposited carbon were evaluated by the intensity ratio of the D band to the G band (ID/IG) [54], [55]. As calculated from the spent PtSn/TS-1(100 nm) catalyst, ID/IG is 0.79, which suggests that the structure of deposited carbon is mainly in the graphene phase. The D band is overlapped in the range of 1100–1550 cm−1 and consists of several small bands, which can be distinguished as D1, D3, and D2 bands. The most obvious D1 band was found at 1375 cm−1, representing the edge or defect of a graphitic lattice or a double resonant Raman scattering process [56]. Its intensity depends on the size of the graphitic crystallites. The D3 band with large linewidth appeared near 1480 cm−1, which is attributed to amorphous carbon. Finally, the D2 band observed at 1620 cm−1 is ascribed to the E2g symmetry vibration of a disordered graphitic lattice [57], [58]. With the increase of deposited carbon, the conversion of propane drops gradually but still remains above 47% after 7 h. That means that the active sites are not totally covered with deposited carbon and exhibit better coke tolerance. Because the activity is restored as discussed above, the deposited carbon is believed to be burnt out after regeneration.
5. Conclusions
A series of PtSn/TS-1 catalysts with systematically controlled zeolite sizes were successfully synthesized. The particle sizes of the supports are in the range from 100 nm to 5.72 μm, while keeping a narrow size distribution. Moreover, the generation of a hierarchical structure in small samples enhances the mass transportation and accessibility of active components, leading to improved catalytic performances. The electronic factor of titanium improves the selectivity to propylene and the steric factor of particle size affects the conversion of propane.
The minimal size TS-1-supported PtSn catalyst exhibits the best catalytic performance. The initial conversion of propane can reach as high as 53.5% and is still as high as 52.4% in the fourth cycle. A quadratic function is established to fit the sizes of support in PtSn/TS-1 catalysts and their initial conversion of propane. The diminution of support size shows a new approach to improving the catalytic performance of conventional supported catalysts in the PDH reaction, as well as some other heterogeneous catalytic processes.
The influence of crystal size was evaluated by applying the Weisz–Prater criterion for intercrystalline mass transfer limitations. The large TS-1 supported catalyst shows obvious internal diffusion limitations, which is the opposite of the small one. For the latter case, intercrystalline diffusion does not hinder the mass transfer, and the activity and life are superior to those of the other catalysts in the PDH process. Besides, the small catalyst exhibits higher surface area, which is beneficial for the contact of the reactants and catalyst. This factor could also lead to better catalytic performance.
The deposited carbon species were also analyzed by in situ Raman spectroscopy. Both D and G Raman bands appeared in the reaction, indicating the formation of graphene crystals and disordered carbon species. Combined with the cycle activity, it is obvious that the deposited coke has been totally removed after the process of regeneration. The spent catalysts exhibited stable catalytic activity in the fourth cycle, which demonstrated that they are suitable for commercial application.
