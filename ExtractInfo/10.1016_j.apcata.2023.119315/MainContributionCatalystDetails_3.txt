The provided document does not contain any mention of propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on the conversion of CO2 and CH4 into value-added products like unsaturated hydrocarbons and oxygenates using non-thermal plasma and iron-based catalysts promoted with potassium. While it discusses catalyst composition and performance for this CO2/CH4 conversion process, it does not relate to propylene production from propane specifically.
