The provided document does not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The document focuses on the plasma-catalytic conversion of CO2 and CH4 into higher value products like unsaturated hydrocarbons and oxygenates. It does not discuss the conversion of propane to propylene specifically. Since there is no information provided about PDH or ODH catalysts, I have indicated that the content is not relevant.
