The given document does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It discusses the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, but focuses on the anchoring and characterization of gold chloride and platinum chloride complexes on magnesium aluminum layered double hydroxides as catalyst support precursors. While it provides some catalytic testing results for propane dehydrogenation, the main emphasis is on how the support precursor and metal complex anchoring impact the dispersion, localization, and properties of the resulting mono- and bimetallic Au-Pt catalysts. There are no major insights or advancements related to improving selectivity, conversion or stability specifically for propane dehydrogenation through catalyst composition, preparation or process conditions.
