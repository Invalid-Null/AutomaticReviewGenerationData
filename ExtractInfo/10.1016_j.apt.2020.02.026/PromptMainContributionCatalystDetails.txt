Abstract
Effect of exit geometry on solid holdup distributions in a small-diameter riser (0.01 m i.d. × 3.07 m high) has been determined with three fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts of different physical properties. The axial holdup distributions of the catalysts showed the C-shape with relatively dense bottom and upper regions of the riser. The solids holdups (εs) in dilute phase increased with decreasing gas velocity and increasing solids circulation rate. Higher εs in the upper region of the riser were observed with larger catalyst diameter and density. As the exit diameter decreased, the εs in the upper region were increased. The T-shaped exit with a projected roof increased the solids holdups near the riser top region compared to the L-shaped exit. No significant change in solid holdups was observed with increasing the projected roof height above a certain height. Interestingly, decay constants affected by the riser exit (ae) increased with increasing solid circulation rate in the small-diameter riser due to the increased ratio of perimeter to unit area of the riser. Empirical correlations on ae and reflux constant (Ce) for the small-diameter riser were proposed. Finally, a model was proposed for prediction of the axial εs distribution in the small-diameter riser with abrupt exit.

1. Introduction
Circulating fluidized beds (CFBs) have been widely employed in various catalytic processes for continuous catalytic reaction and regeneration such as the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) reactors and the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reactors. In the CFB reactors, product selectivity and yield are strongly dependent upon average solids holdup and their distribution in the riser. The prediction of the solid holdup distribution at a given condition is very important for the design of lab scale reactor, which is a starting point of the design for determination of further scale up to pilot and commercial CFB reactors [1]. The distribution of catalysts holdup in the riser is influenced by particle properties, operating condition and riser geometry [2]. It has been known that the riser exit geometry strongly influences the hydrodynamics within the riser [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8].
Numerous studies on the effect of riser exit geometry have been extensively carried out, and details of the studies with Geldart A particles related to this study are summarized in Table 1. Several studies focused on the abrupt or T-shaped exit where exit flow is at a right angle to gas–solid flow direction in the riser [3]. This type of exit shape could reduce the catalysts erosion around the riser outlet region, and the riser exit has been usually employed in catalytic cracking reactor such as the FCC riser [14], [15].

Many experimental studies have reported that the riser with the abrupt exit has C-shaped axial solid holdup profiles with a high concentration of solids in upper region of the riser, depending on operating condition [2], [4], [7], [8], [9], [16]. The increase of solids holdup by the abrupt exit was found to be due to solids down-flow along the riser wall from the exit region which stimulates internal reflection [2], [6], [16], [17]. In more detail regarding the effect of geometrical parameters of the riser exit, decreased exit diameter resulted in a significant increase of average solids holdup in the riser with enhancing of the solids reflux around the riser exit [4], [5], [6]. The projected height in the exit geometrical factors stimulated internal circulation of particles and increased solids concentration in the upper region [6], [12]. However, the effect of projected height was shown within a certain height [2], [16].
A few studies [10], [11] reported that the solids holdup profiles and solids down-flow at riser wall are affected by the riser diameter, indicating the diameter effect should be considered in the scale-up of the riser with the abrupt exit. Smaller riser diameter showed decreased average solid holdups at given conditions [3], [5], [16]. The solid holdups and the length of influence around the abrupt exit region was described by empirical correlations, which indicates the exit effect is intensified with increasing the riser diameter [13], [18]. However, the correlations were developed from the experimental results in risers with a diameter of 0.1 m or more.
A pilot-plant at lab-scale, which is often called mini-plant, has been generally used to evaluate the feasibility and obtain the design values for a new process [19]. The lab-scale CFB plants has a small-diameter riser as well as a regenerator because its design is based on the circulation of catalysts for their continuous reaction and regeneration. A cold flow model with the same-size riser is also used to simulate the process aspect related to the fluid flow [19], [20]. Although extensive experimental works and empirical modeling works have been conducted to investigate the effect of the abrupt exit, the results in the small-diameter riser at lab scale are comparatively sparse despite their significant importance, especially for the catalytic cracking tests. However, it is common to design and use the small-diameter riser in pilot plant for testing the activity of the catalysts in hydrodynamically similar condition such as the FCC research [20], [21]. Therefore, it is required to study and predict the catalysts flow in the lab or pilot scale small-diameter riser with the abrupt exit.
In the present study, the effect of the exit geometry on the solid holdup distribution in the small-diameter riser has been determined. Effects of operating condition and physical properties of FCC catalysts have been investigated. The exit effect was determined with changes of the geometrical parameters of the abrupt exit. The decay constant and the reflux constant around the riser exit region were evaluated and their correlations were developed. An empirical model was proposed to predict axial holdup distribution of FCC catalysts in the small-diameter riser for the purpose of riser design and catalyst selectivity evaluation.
2. Experimental
Experiments were conducted in a lab-scale CFB cold-model with a Plexiglas riser (0.01 m i.d. X 3.07 m height) as in Fig. 1. Bed materials used in the study were three FCC catalysts (Geldart group A) with different diameter and apparent density as found in Table 2, which were designed for cracking reactions of specific hydrocarbons. A nozzle type distributor (0.0019 m i.d.) connected to the main column bottom into which pressure-regulated air was fed through a calibrated flow-meter. The riser exit had a shape of abrupt or T-type which is commonly adopted in CFB catalytic reactors [9], [10]. The exit had a connector (0.01 X 0.008 m) to a cyclone with 90° take-off below 0.07 m from the riser roof. The particles entrained from the riser flowed into the cyclone. Collected solid particles in the cyclone flowed into a regenerator (0.05 m i.d.) through a dipleg pipe (0.01 m i.d.). The particles in the regenerator were injected to the riser through a slide valve with regulated solid circulation rate (Gs) by control of orifice area. The Gs at steady state was measured by the accumulated particles velocity on closed porous plate in a transparent measuring column (0.01 m i.d.) in the loop. The Gs was determined based on the bulk particle density measured previously in the measuring column. Manometers and pressure transducers (Setra 264, USA) were connected to the pressure taps along the riser column wall for measurement of pressure drops. The pressure signals were recorded in a PC via an A/D converter after signal amplification.

In measuring the pressure drop in small diameter risers, a portion of pressure drop comes from the gas friction on the wall [22]. In particular, the effects of gas friction and acceleration should be considered near the riser exit region where an abrupt change in gas flow direction occurs. For the reason, the pressure drops across the empty riser were previously measured at the gas flow rates under experimental conditions, and the pressure drop (ΔP) obtained by subtracting the empty column pressure drop from the pressure drop measured at given Gs was considered as the static pressure. The solid holdup (εs) was determined from the obtained ΔP across the two locations based on Eq. (1) assuming that the solids acceleration and the wall friction are ignored.

Additionally, the εs distributions in the riser was obtained with variation of the exit diameter (De) and projected height (He) as defined in Fig. 1(b) to determine the effect of the exit geometry.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Solids holdup distribution in riser
3.1.1. Effect of Ug and Gs
Fig. 2(a) shows the effect of Gs on axial εs distribution in the riser at constant Ug. The average solid holdup increases due to the increase of the amount of particles injected into the riser with increasing Gs. The solid holdup distribution shows a C-shape with relatively high concentrations in the bottom and the exit regions. The high holdups of particles around the riser exit are due to the geometry of abrupt exit with the diameter (De = 0.0089 m) smaller than the riser diameter (Dr = 0.010 m). This type of the exit causes sudden angular change and resistance in the flow of particles and separates particles from the gas as a solid particle separator [7], [8], resulting in a particles reflux phenomenon that descends along the wall from the riser top. The increase in solid holdups near the riser exit is not significant at low Gs of 27 and 50 kg/m2s and the εs values are similar throughout the riser. As the Gs is further increased, the increase in the solid holdups near the riser top was large due to the enlarged exit effect.

Fig. 2(b) shows the effect of Ug on axial εs distribution in the riser at constant Gs of 75 kg/m2s. As the Ug increased, the average solid holdup decreased due to a decrease of bottom dense region by the increase of particle entrainment. The solid holdups in the dilute phase are high at lower Ug, because the re-entrainment of refluxing particle layer by the shearing action of rising gas is difficult at lower gas momentum, so the down-flowing distance of the reflux particles becomes longer [5], [13].
3.1.2. Effect of particle properties
Fig. 3 shows axial εs distributions of three catalysts, respectively, at given Gs of 43 and 73 kg/m2s and Ug of 3.73 m/s. The dense bottom region is not formed at the given condition due to the high gas jet velocity at the nozzle (Hr = 0.0 m). The smaller and denser catalyst 1 shows an uniform profile of the solid holdup along the entire riser. The coarser and lighter catalyst 2 than the others shows higher solid holdups in the riser and significant increase of the solid holdups in upper section of the riser. The finding is inconsistent with the results from the riser with smooth exit of previous study [23], which reports the higher solid holdups of the heavy particles in the dilute phase of riser because the denser particles have higher local solid holdups around the wall due to their lower solid velocity [23]. The abrupt exit causes particles reflux in the riser [3] and the degree of reflux is proportional to the number of particles (or solid holdup) reaching the exit region [24]. The catalyst 2 with a large number of particles at the same Gs is much strongly affected by the exit effect [13], resulting in high solid holdups in the upper region. The axial solids holdup profiles in the study indicate that the increases of particle size and density have an obvious effect, combined with the exit geometry effect, on the solids distribution, resulting in a significantly higher solids concentrations in the upper region of the riser.

3.1.3. Effect of riser exit geometry
Fig. 4(a) shows the effect of riser exit diameter on axial εs distribution at given condition of Ug = 3.73 m/s and Gs = 115 kg/m2s. As the exit diameter decreased, the solid holdups in the upper region are increased. The reduction in the area of riser exit reduces the particles that can be directly discharged from the riser without the flow resitance, thus increasing the average εs in the riser as reported by Zheng and Zhang [6]. The solid holdups in the exit region increased almost linearly within the experimental range for the decrease in the De/Dr as shown in Fig. 4(b). Fig. 5(a) shows the effect of projected height of the riser exit on axial εs distribution at the same condition of Fig. 4. In the figure, the He/Dr of 0.4 refers to an L-shape structure of the riser exit where the riser outlet has a right angle to the solid flow direction without the projected height, whereas the He/Dr above 0.4 refers a T-shape exit with the projected height. The T-shaped exit increases the εs near the riser top region due to the increase of the amount of solids staying in the riser roof-top region compared to the L-shaped exit, which is consistent with previous findings [2], [6], [7], [12]. In detail, the gas upward-flow in the riser turns horizontally toward the cyclone at the exit, while some solid particles continue to move upwards by the inertia and collide with riser ceiling wall. The collided particles are rebounded and descend. The down-flowing particles merge with the rising solid stream around wall region to increase the solid holdup near the riser exit region. However, no significant change in solid holdup was observed with increasing the projected height from He/Dr = 2.8 to 7.4 as shown in Fig. 5(b), which is matched well with the results from Breault et al. [2] and Zhang et al. [12]. In the projected roof above a certain height, the particles are concentrated and circulating internally [16], and most of the rising particles toward the roof do not reach the ceiling by the internally-circulating particles unlike the L-shape, which weakens the rebound of the particles. From the catalytic reactor design point of view, these results on the De/Dr and He/Dr should be reflected in the selection of exit diameter and projected height of the riser, considering their effects on the conversion and selectivity due to further reaction of the catalysts at the exit region of the reactor.

3.2. Prediction of solids holdup distribution
3.2.1. Decay and reflux constants in dilute region of riser
There have been many approaches to express the axial distribution of the εs in CFB risers. This study adopted the following equation by Zenz and Weil [25] for description of axial solids profile [8], [26].
(2)
It is well known that the Eq. (2) predicts well the εs profile in the riser with smooth exit [8], [25], [26]. However, the riser with abrupt exit showed large deviations from predicted holdups by Eq.(2) due to the solids reflux near exit region by the easy separation of particles from gas [8], [26], [27]. Kunii and Levenspiel [26] proposed an equation to express the deviation extent with ae (decay constant affected by the exit geometry) and Ce (reflux constant) as.
(3)
In this study, the ae and Ce were obtained from the results on axial profiles of solid holdup in dilute phase of present and previous studies [6], [8], [10], [28], [29], [30].
Fig. 6 shows the effect of Gs on the ae in small diameter riser (0.01–0.03 m) and large diameter riser (0.10–0.40 m) respectively. In the case of risers having diameter larger than 0.10 m, the ae decreased with increasing Gs as in the previous reports [8], [16]. Interestingly, the ae increased with increasing Gs for small diameter riser (Dr ≤ 0.03 m). As the Gs increases at a constant Ug, the particles form agglomerates or clusters and the particles agglomerates fall along the wall from the riser top region, depending on the exit geometrical factors of the riser [3], [5]. The downward layer thickness of the solid particles becomes thicker with increasing Gs in the riser with an abrupt exit, thereby increasing the solid holdups in the upper region. The thick down-flowing solids results in a decrease of the ae (Fig. 6b), by reducing the axial change in the solid holdups along the direction of the solid down-flow from the exit region in the riser [8]. However, the solid holdups near the exit region in the small-diameter riser increase as the Gs increases, but the solid holdups show relatively low values and the ae increases in the dilute region of the small diameter riser since the downward flow layer is weakly formed below the top region. As the riser diameter is decreased, the wall surface area for the solids down-flow is increased since the perimeter to cross-sectional area of the riser will increase [31], resulting in decrease of the thickness of the falling particles and easy dissipation of the descending solids flow by the rising gas–solid flow. The rising gas-solids flow dominantes the hydrodynamics in a small-diameter riser rather than the particle down-flow near the wall. This agrees well with results by Yan and Zhu [32] where the radial velocity distributions of gas-solids are much uniform in the small-diameter risers.

Finally, it is not appropriate to apply previous correlations on the ae to predict εs distribution in the riser with a small-diameter less than 0.03 m based on these findings. Correlations on the ae and Ce were proposed based on the results from previous [29], [30] and this studies.

The aeDr and Ce values calculated from Eq. (4), (5) were matched well with the experimental values of the present study and literature [29], [30] as shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b), respectively.

3.2.2. Prediction model and validation
For solids distributions in the small-diameter riser, a model was developed and applied by a computation procedure as shown in Fig. 8. To predict axial εs distribution in the riser, the solid holdups in dense bed (εsd) and dilute phase (εs*) are firstly calculated from Bai and Kato [33]'s Eqs. (6)–(10) based on whether the Gs is greater than or less than the saturation carrying capacity (Gs*) as.

Then, the dense bed height (zd) is assumed. A decay constant (a) is required to obtain the axial variations in solid holdups above the dense bed in the riser. This study adopted Eq. (11) by Park et al. [34], which proposed a correlation on decay constants based on the results from the small-diameter riser (0.0254 m) as.
(11)
Then, Eqs. (4), (5) are applied into Eq. (3), and εs values are obtained from Eq. (2) with correction of Δεsr to determine the change in the distribution of solid holdups in the dilute phase due to the exit effect. Finally, the predicted axial solid holdup distributions from Eq. (2) combined with Eq. (3) are shown in Fig. 9, Fig. 10, Fig. 11. As in Fig. 9, the model based on the proposed correlations predicted well the experimental results over the entire riser length with Ug and Gs, and showed good agreement, especially near the riser outlet. Fig. 10 shows that the proposed model also described well the effect of the catalyst properties.

Concerning risers with the abrupt exit, a few models were proposed for the prediction of axial holdup profiles of Geldart A particles as in Table 3. Their key correlations adopted the riser diameter in the dimensionless numbers to reflect the effect of the riser diameter as well as the exit geometrical parameters [8], [13]. However, the correlations were developed based on the results obtained in the riser larger than Dr = 0.1 m. They can not describe well the Δεsr in Eq. (3) which is affected by the higher ratio of perimeter to cross-sectional area in the small diameter riser [28]. Comparisons of axial εs profiles predicted from the present model and those from Kim et al. [8] and Monazzam et al. [16] are shown in Fig. 11. The previous models showed excessive solid holdups closer to the riser exit region. Whereas, the proposed model described well the solid holdup profiles of present and previous studies [30], [31] conducted in the small-diameter riser less than 0.03 m.

4. Conclusions
The effect of the exit geometrical factors on the εs distribution in the small-diameter riser has been determined with three FCC catalysts of different particle diameter and density. The axial solid profile showed a C-shape, and the solids holdups in dilute phase increased with decreasing Ug and increasing Gs with strong exit effect. Higher εs in the upper region were observed with increasing particle diameter and density. As the De decreased, the εs in the upper region were increased. The T-shaped exit increases the εs near the riser top region compared to the L-shaped exit. No significant change in solid holdups was observed with increasing the projected height above He/Dr = 2.8. Interestingly, the ae increased with increasing Gs for the small-diameter riser due to the increase of the perimeter per unit area of the riser for solids refluxing down-flow. Empirical correlations on the ae and Ce for the small-diameter riser less than 0.03 m were proposed. Finally, a model was proposed to predict the axial εs profiles in the small-diameter riser with the abrupt exit. The proposed model describes well the experimental results from present study and literature compared to the previous models.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
