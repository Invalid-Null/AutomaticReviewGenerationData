 Based on the research paper, this does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The paper focuses on studying axial holdup distributions of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts in a small-diameter riser with an abrupt exit. It does not mention PDH, ODH, or propane conversion specifically.
