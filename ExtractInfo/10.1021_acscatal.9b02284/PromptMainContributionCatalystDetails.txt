Supported Boron Oxide Catalysts for Selective and Low-Temperature Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane

Abstract
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of light alkanes catalyzed by metal oxides is considered to be a thermodynamically favorable process for olefin production. The strong interaction between the unoccupied d-orbital of metal atom and the π-electrons of olefins, however, leads to deep oxidation of olefin to CO2, especially at elevated temperatures. The challenge lies in the development of selective and low-temperature active catalysts to avoid such unwanted deep oxidation. Here, we report unambiguous evidence on properly prepared mesoporous silica-supported boron oxide catalysts showing high selectivity for ODH of propane. The catalysts are active at a temperature as low as 405 °C, showing a propane conversion of 2.8% and a propene selectivity of 84.1% (C2–3=: 94.6%). Upon raising the temperature to 450 °C, a propane conversion of 14.8% can be achieved, with a selectivity of 73.3% toward propene or 87.4% for both propene and ethene (C2–3=). Both experimental and theoretical studies indicate tricoordinated boroxol and hydroxylated linear boron species are the active sites for the ODH of propane. In addition, the oxophilicity of boron sites is responsible for suppressing deep oxidation by eliminating the alkoxyl species, leading to high selectivity toward olefin products.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propene is one of the most useful building blocks in petrochemical industry. Commercial production of propene is either based on catalytic cracking of petroleum-derived hydrocarbons or direct dehydrogenation of propane to propene. These protocols are tremendously energy demanding and raise environmental concerns. (1−3) The increasing availability of worldwide shale gas, (4,5) including natural gas resources, has recently stimulated a quick technical shift to the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane for propene production. (6−8)
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane is featured by its exothermicity and free of equilibrium limitation and coking. (9−11) In the past decades, it has been extensively investigated nearly exclusively on metal oxide catalysts, e.g., sol–gel Li/MgO, (12) CeNbNiOx, (13) V2O5/SBA-15, (14) and V–Mg–O, (15) to benefit from its thermodynamic advantages for propene production. A major obstacle in its industrialization is the deep oxidation of olefin products over metal oxides catalysts, leading to poor yield of propene and serious CO2 emission. Boria supported on Al2O3 (16−18) was also reported to display improved selectivity for olefins in ODH of propane while still with a significant amount of oxygenated products. The dawn to end the stalemate came with the discovery of functionalized boron nitride (BN) catalysts which exhibit high activity and selectivity to propene and ethylene with negligible formation of CO2. (19,20)
In previous work, we proposed that the oxygenated B sites (B–O/B–OH) of edge-hydroxylated BN catalysts are the active regions, (20−23) which has recently received further support in our and other groups’ work. (24−26) However, though h-BN catalysts display extraordinary performance in selective production of olefins, they require relatively high reaction temperatures up to 530 °C. Hence, considering both high reaction temperature issue and scientific desire (i.e., the in-depth comprehension of intrinsic activity over boron-containing catalysts), there is a compelling need in the preparation of low temperature active catalysts possessing high activity, which would consequently boost the industrialization of the ODH of propane.
With this consideration, we designed a supported boron oxide catalyst on mesoporous silica (B2O3/SBA-15, denoted as BOS) and demonstrated its remarkable performance to catalyze the ODH of propane at low temperature with the high selectivity of propene.

BOS Catalysts
Mesoporous silica is known to have the merits of high specific area, amorphous state, and rich channels with large pores. Our investigation has shown that this material is inactive for ODH of propane (Table 1, Figure S1); thus, it also offers an ideal testing bed to identify the role of B–O units both in sparsely distributed and in aggregated forms. B2O3 is rich in B–OH groups and B–O–B bridges. These building blocks may constitute various structural units to adapt to the chemical environment under reaction conditions. The structural flexibility allows B2O3 to display bond length thermal expansion under calcination (27−29) and covalently implemented on SBA-15. In the fabrication of B2O3/SBA-15 catalysts, the loading of B2O3 was varied in the weight range of 0.1–30%, ranging from sparse dispersion on the surface of silica to full coverage of the surface according to theoretical estimation. The abundant surface silanol groups (∼4.3–6.7 −OH/nm2) (30) and amorphous nature of mesoporous silica enabled the immobilization of B2O3 on the surface of silica via B–O–Si bridges. The synthesized catalysts are denoted as BOS-x, where x represents the weight percentage of loaded B2O3.

Note: for BOS-10, at 31.5% conversion, besides COx, oxygenates (in totoal less than 5%) such as formic acid, formaldehyde, methanol, ethanol, etc. were detected.

Catalytic Activity in ODH of Propane
Our catalytic test results demonstrate that SBA-15 is inactive in ODH of propane. After immobilizing B2O3 on its surface, remarkable conversion of propane to alkene with surprisingly high selectivity was observed at temperatures above 400 °C, and the conversion of propane can be improved by increasing the amount of B2O3 loaded on SBA-15 (Figure 1a). The corresponding oxygen conversion (Figure S2a) also showed a similar trend to propane with the temperature. The optimum loading of B2O3 is 10%, at which a propane conversion of 14.8% and a selectivity of 73.3% toward propene or 87.4% for both propene and ethene (C2–3=) were achieved at 450 °C (Figure 1b). Compared with reported h-BN catalyst, (19) BOS showed a better propane conversion at a higher WHSV of 9.4 gC3H8 gcat–1 h–1 and a lower temperature of 450 °C. Upon raising the temperature to 500 °C, a propane conversion of 31.5% can be attained, with a selectivity of 64.0% toward propene or 83.1% for both propene and ethene (C2–3=) (Table 1, Figure S2b). The olefin yields are higher than that using different metal oxide catalysts (31)(Table S1). During the 30 h operation at 450 °C, the propane conversion and product selectivity remained essentially unchanged, demonstrating the excellent stability of the BOS-10 catalyst (Figure 1c). More significantly, the temperature for the ODH process of BOS catalyst is considerably lower than that required by most of the metal-free catalysts, and a propane conversion of 2.8% was obtained for BOS-10 catalyst with a propene selectivity of 84.1% (C2–3=: 94.6%) even at 405 °C. These features endow the BOS-10 catalyst with remarkable performance in ODH of propane at low temperature.

Reaction conditions: catalyst weight, 100 mg; gas feed, 48 mL/min, C3H8/O2/N2 with a molar ratio of 1/1.5/3.5.
The activity of BOS catalysts was observed to depend on the amount of B2O3. Raising the loading of B2O3 from 0.1% (BOS-0.1) to 10% (BOS-10), the propane conversion increased from 4.2% up to 31.5% at 500 °C. However, with a further increase of loaded B2O3 on SBA-15, e.g., 20% and 30%, the propane conversion decreased to 18.1% and 8.0%, respectively (Table 1), possibly due to the limited accessible active sites. For such a deduction, we used NH3 adsorption method to investigate the exposure of active sites (Table S2, Figure S3). The amount of NH3 adsorbed for intact SBA-15 support was very low, and it increased to 84.66 μmol/g with an increasing loading of B2O3 to 10%. By further increasing the B2O3 loading, the total amount of adsorbed NH3 decreased, reflecting a decreased accessible active sites due to the aggregation and blockage of B2O3 in SBA-15.
These results unambiguously demonstrated the remarkable catalytic ability of boron oxides in ODH of light alkanes and verified the important role of oxygenated B sites (B–O/B–OH) of edge-hydroxylated BN catalysts in ODH. (20)
Structural Characterization of BOS Catalysts
The structural variations of the BOS catalysts were characterized using different means. Highly ordered channels of fresh and spent BOS-10 catalysts were observed by transmission electron microscope (TEM) (Figure 2a, 2b). These well-retained channels after 30 h operation of propane ODH indicated good stability of the mesostructure.
Figure 2
Figure 2. TEM images of fresh (a) and spent (b) BOS-10 catalyst. (c) XRD patterns, (d) N2 sorption isotherms and pore size distributions (inset) of SBA-15, fresh and spent BOS-10 catalyst.
The XRD patterns (Figure 2c) of SBA-15 support, fresh and spent BOS-10 catalysts show major broad reflection in the 2θ range of 15–29° attributed to the amorphous nature of SiO2 support. For the fresh and spent BOS-10 catalysts additional peaks appear at 2θ of 14.5° and 27.7°, corresponding to the lattice planes of boron oxide (ICDD: 00-006-0297).
N2 physical sorption isotherms of SBA-15, fresh and spent BOS-10 catalysts (Figure 2d, Figure S4) belong to type IV with H1-type hysteresis loops, an indicative of typical mesoporous structure. The average pore size of the SBA-15 obtained from the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method is 6.7 nm, and it decreases to ∼5.1 nm for the as-made BOS catalyst (Table S2), indicating that the loaded B2O3 entered and coated on the surface of the mesopores. After 30 h operation, the spent catalyst exhibits nearly identical N2 sorption isotherm as that of the fresh catalyst, suggesting that the mesostructure of BOS catalyst was stable during the ODH of propane.
The 11B NMR measurement (Figure 3, Figures S5 and S6) identified four types of B species with chemical shifts at ca. 18.1–18.7, 14.9–15.7, 12.0–12.8, and −5.3 to −1.8 ppm, respectively. The quadrupolar coupling constants (CQ) of three types of tricoordinated boron species were 2.5–2.6 MHz. (32−35) The tetracoordinated boron species with a chemical shift on the upfield side showed a Gaussian–Lorentz line feature. The two species at the downfield side were assigned to tricoordinated B species, with the nonring BO3/2 (B(3b) in Scheme 1) less deshielded by about 3 ppm than the boroxol ring B3O9/2 (B(3a) in Scheme 1) species, which agrees well with the data in earlier NMR experimental (36,34) and computational studies. (37−39) It was proposed that due to the more bent B–O–B bond angle in the boroxol ring (120°) than in the nonring species (about 134°), there was more deshielding of the former than the latter. (39) The two on the upfield side (12.0–12.8, −5.3 to −1.8 ppm) were assigned to two tricoordinated planar B species and a tetra-coordinated tetrahedral B anionic species, which were fused into the silica matrix.

aThe calculated 11B NMR chemical shifts are shown.
The relative abundance of the four types of B species showed dependence on the loaded amount of B2O3. The increase in the amount of B2O3 led to larger proportion of the boroxol species, accompanied by the decrease of the other three types of species (Table 2 and Table S3). This indicated that boroxol species was favored at higher loading of B2O3, agreeing with earlier ab initio MD simulations (40) that thermodynamically boroxol-rich models were more stable. Both NMR experiments at 14.1 T and at 11.7 T indicated that the majority of B2O3 dispersed on the surface were tricoordinated trigonal planar B species (>95%). As the preparation of the catalysts were performed at high temperature (700 °C), it is reasonable to rule out the isolated B(OH)3 species. All tri- and tetracoordinated B species should be immobilized on the surface of silica via B–O–Si bridges. All spent catalysts show increased quantity of B(3a) species and decreased quantity of B(3b) and B(3c) species. Clearly, there were dynamic conversions between these oxygenated B species under ODH conditions, and the transformations of B(3b) and B(3c) to B(3a) species were enthalpy-driven according to previous 17O NMR and first-principles study.

In addition, a series of model systems covering tri- and tetracoordinated B species immobilized on SBA-15 via B–O–Si bridges with each B site bound with 0 to 2 hydroxyl groups were investigated theoretically (Figure S7). The most probable models were identified according to their calculated isotropic shielding tensors and grouped into four categories (Scheme 1). For the tricoordinated B species, depending on the number of hydroxyl groups on B atom, the chemical shifts of 11B were calculated to span in the range of 11–19 ppm, with the less hydroxylated nonring B species (B(3b) and B(3c)), saturated with terminal B–OH or B–O–B/Si bridges and fused into the matrix, on the upfield side, and those ring species (B(3a)) on the downfield side. For the tetra-coordinated species (B(4)), the B atom was rich in electron density in its vicinity, and its chemical shift was calculated to be −0.2 ppm. These results agree well with the experimental data.
In the 1H NMR experiments, two proton species were identified (Figure 4, Figure S8–S9), i.e. the B–OH proton at 3.1 ppm and the silanol proton (SiOH) at 2.0–2.2 ppm (Table 3). In the case of fresh BOS catalysts, increasing loading of B2O3 from 0.1% to 10% resulted in the presence of a higher amount B–OH protons and a lower amount Si–OH protons. This result indicated the formation of B–O–Si covalent bonds by consuming Si–OH groups. After ODH reaction, the distributions of the two types of protons varied bifurcately (Table 3). The marginal increase of Si–OH sites may be the consequence of the cleavage of Si–O–Si and Si–O–B bonds, possibly catalyzed by the in situ generated water molecules, similar to the water-promoted B–O–B bridge cleavage proposed in our previous work. (20) The results indicated that the structure of the loaded B2O3 could be changed after ODH reaction in accord to the 11B NMR experimental data.

DFT Calculations and Mechanistic Issues
In order to understand the underlying mechanism, free energy profiles of key reaction steps were constructed by the DFT method (Table S4). The above discussions of the experimental results showed that the proportion of the boroxol species (B(3a)) increased in the spent catalysts accompanied by the decrease of B(3b, 3c), implicating that these species could be closely relevant to the catalytic activity of the catalysts and transformation of the latter to the former took place during the reaction. In order to evaluate the role of these sites, we first considered the dehydrogenation of the >B–OH groups and the following dehydrogenation of propane initiated at these >B–O• sites in the DFT calculations. It turned out that the dehydrogenation of the doubly hydroxylated B sites, which may be transient species generated via hydrolysis of B(3a) or B(3b) species, was a two-step reaction and the activation energy required for the first step was 2.37 eV, which was accessible under the ODH reaction conditions. The dehydrogenation of the >B–OH group at the monohydroxylated B site faced a barrier of 2.49 eV. These high barriers agreed with the feature of the catalytic system that an induction period was observed before efficient propane ODH products were detected, and the large resonance energy of triplet dioxygen was responsible for its low reactivity toward the hydrogen abstract from >B–OH groups. (41) The generated >B–O• radical was highly active toward the subsequent dehydrogenation of propane with a free energy barrier of 0.12 eV.
These results showed that the B sites with more OH groups were easier to dehydrogenate by dioxygen. To generate more >B–OH groups, water molecule was considered as the proton source to break the B–O–B/Si bridges via electrophilic attack to the bridging O sites. In the meantime, the hydroxyl group attached to the B site lost its −OB or −OSi neighbor. These processes corresponded to the reverse reactions of the condensation of boron oxides and were found to proceed easily with free energy barriers in the range of 0.42–1.42 eV. The B–OSi bond cleavage of the B(3b) sites were among the most facile reactions both in view of kinetics and thermodynamics, and explained the decrease in the amount of B(3b) species (Table 2) and B–OH protons (Table 3) and the increase in that of Si–OH protons (Table 3) in the spent catalysts. It was also possible for B(3a) to open the ring to offer more doubly hydroxylated sites with free energy barriers ranging from 0.64 to 1.42 eV.
The dehydrogenation of propane via base catalysis, i.e., the direct reaction of the >B–OH, >B-OB, and >B-OSi sites of B(3b) and B(3a) with propane, need overcome even higher barriers of 2.80–3.38 eV, and all were endothermic, suggesting that even harsher conditions were required for these processes to occur.
It merits a discussion on the origin of low deep oxidation. It is conceivable that the deep oxidation requires the cleavage of the C–C bond and the survival of the C–O bond once it forms. According to calculations, alkoxyl radicals may form during the ODH of propane, and these radicals displayed high affinity to attach to the B site and form a stable B–OR bond. If there were alkyl groups at the target B site, one alkyl group would be released, which may then easily react with dioxygen to form an alkyl peroxo species followed by dehydrogenation to produce propene and a hydroperoxo radical. The high oxophilicity of the B site thus shortened the lifetime of the free alkoxyl radical and suppressed the deep oxidation channel.
Moreover, kinetic experiments of the ODH reaction of propane were performed over the BOS-10 catalyst. The activation energy of propane was estimated to be 1.51 eV (145 kJ/mol) (Figure S10a), which is lower than that over BN catalytic system (1.92 eV, 184 kJ/mol). (20) The effect of partial pressure of propane and oxygen on the reaction rate is shown in Figure S10b,c. The reaction orders are about 0.5 for oxygen and 2 for propane. On the basis of the experimental data and calculations, a mechanism (see the SI) and the dominant pathway were proposed (Figure 5). The activation free enthalpy to this pathway was calculated to be 1.698 eV, and the dehydrogenation of propane was identified as the rate-determining step.

Using high surface area silica as the support, boronic species can be dispersed and immobilized through B–O–Si bonds. Such supported catalysts were convenient to prepare and displayed detectable activity at as low as 405 °C, which is about 100 °C lower than that of BN catalyst and far lower than that of other metal-free catalysts, showing its specificity and potential in ODH of light alkanes. Their extraordinary performance in ODH of propane was evaluated, and the active sites were identified. The catalyst with 10 wt % B2O3 under ODH conditions exhibited remarkable ODH activity at a propane conversion of 31.5% and an olefin selectivity of 83.1%. The supported boron oxide catalysts not only offer ideal model of metal-free boron-based catalyst to study the scientific foundation behind their remarkable efficiency but also serve as a promising catalyst candidate for the industrial ODH process.
The boroxol ring and the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 species were presently identified as the active sites being responsible for the low temperature activity and high efficiency in catalyzing ODH of light alkanes, and the mesoporous silica offered ideal surfaces for the immobilization of B2O3. The oxophilicity of B enabled its high affinity to bind with alkoxide to suppress its further oxidation and guarantee high selectivity for olefin products.

Materials
Boric acid (H3BO3) and ethylene glycol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All of the chemicals used in this work were of analytical grade without further purification.
Synthesis of BOS Catalysts
SBA-15 was synthesized according to the literature. (42) A series of BOS catalysts containing different amounts of B2O3 were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method using H3BO3 as a boron source. The concentration of H3BO3 in ethylene glycol solution was matched so as to obtain 0.1–20 wt % of the total B2O3 content in the catalysts. Due to the low solubility of H3BO3, 30%B2O3/SBA-15 catalyst was synthesized by impregnation twice with H3BO3 solution. Then the precursors were calcinated at 700 °C for 3 h in air. The catalysts were denoted as BOS-x, where BO stands for B2O3, S for SBA-15, and x for the weight percentage of B2O3 (wt %). The BOS-10W sample was prepared by washing spent BOS-10 catalyst with deionized water, dried overnight at 50 °C, and calcinated at 700 °C for 3 h in air. The B2O3 loading in BOS-10W before and after reaction was 0.98 and 1.02 wt %, respectively, as analyzed by ICP-OES.
Catalytic Reaction
ODH of propane reaction was tested in a packed-bed quartz microreactor (I.D. = 6 mm) under atmospheric pressure. Catalyst (100 mg) without any inert packing was placed in the reactor. The reaction mixture was C3H8/O2/N2 with a molar ratio of 1/1.5/3.5. Flow rate was fixed at 48 mL/min (WHSV was 9.4 gC3H8 gcat–1 h–1), and the reaction temperature was varied in the range of 400–500 °C. Before reaction, each BOS catalyst was pretreated to stabilize the coordination environment of boron species under reaction conditions. Reactants and products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (Techcomp, GC 7980). A GDX-102 and 5A molecular sieve column, connected to a TCD were used to analyze the O2, N2, C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, CO, and CO2.
Conversion was defined as the number of moles of carbon converted divided by the number of moles of carbon present in the feed. Selectivity was defined as the number of moles of carbon in the product divided by the number of moles of carbon reacted. The carbon balance was generally higher than 95%.
Material Characterizations
The in situ prepared and spent BOS-x catalysts were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) on PANalytical X’Pert3 Powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The tube voltage was 40 kV, and the current was 40 mA. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured by using a TriStar 3000 adsorption analyzer (Micromeritics) at −196 °C. Before the measurements, the sample was degassed at 200 °C. The specific surface area (SBET) was calculated from the adsorption data in the relative pressure range from 0.05 to 0.3 using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Total pore volumes (Vtotal) were calculated from the amount of nitrogen adsorbed at a relative pressure (P/P0) of 0.95. NH3 adsorption experiments were performed on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument. The sample was pretreated in a flow of helium at 400 °C for 1 h. Afterward, the amount of ammonia adsorbed was measured at 100 °C by means of a pulse-chromatographic technique. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on TECNAI F30 high-resolution transmission electron microscope (FEI Company) operated at an accelerating voltage of 300 kV by dispersing ground powders in ethanol and then onto holey carbon films supported on copper grids. The boron content in the catalysts was determined using ICP-OES on Optima2000DV. Before ICP-OES measurements, the samples were dissolved in a mixture of HF and HNO3 solution under heating conditions.
Solid-state 11B magic-angle-spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (11B MAS NMR) measurements were performed on an Agilent DD2-500 MHz spectrometer with a 11.7 T magnet and Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz spectrometer with a 14.1 T magnet. The spectra were acquired using 4 mm MAS NMR probes with a spinning rate of 10 kHz. The chemical shifts were referenced to a 1 M H3BO3 aqueous solution at 19.6 ppm. The spectra were deconvoluted by the DMFIT program using the Q MAS 1/2 module. (43) The peak areas represented the amount of nuclear spins, i.e., the amount of corresponding B species; therefore, the relative amount of B species in each spectrum could be derived. We assumed that all B species were observed in the 11B MAS NMR, and the amount of each species could be obtained for each sample with a given B content derived from ICP-OES. 1H MAS NMR experiments were carried out at 499.8 MHz using a 4 mm MAS NMR probe with a spinning rate of 10 kHz. Adamantane was used as the standard sample for 1H MAS NMR quantification. The chemical shifts were referenced to tetramethylsilane. Prior to measurement, the sample was dehydrated at 400 °C for 1 h at 10–4 Pa and then transferred to a 4 mm MAS rotor in an in-house device without exposure to air.
Computational Methods
Becke’s three-parameter exchange together with Lee–Yang–Parr’s correlation (B3LYP) (44−46) as implemented in Gaussian 09 (47) was used to calculate the isotropic shielding tensors of 11B in various chemical environments and the energetics of key steps of the ODH of propane. All atoms were treated with a double-ζ 6-31G(d,p) basis set. (48,49) In the calculations of isotropic shielding tensors of 11B, the Gauge-Independent Atomic Orbital (GIAO) method (50) was used. All stationary points reported here have been fully optimized followed by vibrational frequency analysis to identify their nature as transition states or minima. For each elementary reaction, intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) (51,52) calculations were done to confirm the transition state connected the two minima in the backward and forward directions.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
