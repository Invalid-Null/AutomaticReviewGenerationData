The given document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation, as it focuses on dehydrogenation of lower paraffins in general without specific mention of propane. The document discusses platinum supported on magnesium aluminate spinel catalyst for dehydrogenation of lower paraffins, but does not provide details on conversion, selectivity or other performance metrics specifically for propane dehydrogenation. Since the relevance to propane dehydrogenation is unclear, I have indicated "No" for relevance in the output.
