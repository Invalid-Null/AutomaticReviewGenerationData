Effect of Boron Promotion on Coke Formation during Propane Dehydrogenation over Pt/γ-Al2O3 Catalysts

Abstract
The effect of boron promotion on the performance of 3 wt % Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts during propane dehydrogenation was investigated. A series of boron-promoted Pt/XB-γ-Al2O3 catalysts were synthesized, tested, and characterized. The sequential impregnation of 1 wt % boron and 3 wt % platinum decreases the amount of deposited carbon 3-fold, increases the propylene selectivity from 90% to 98%, and enhances the activity after 12 h by 40%. Catalyst characterization and thermodynamic DFT calculations suggest that boron forms a finely dispersed amorphous oxide on the γ-Al2O3 support and on the platinum particles, modifying both the selectivity of the metal sites and the strength and number of acid sites on the support.

1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propylene is an important building block for a variety of bulk chemicals and polymers (1) and is mainly produced by naphtha steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. (1,2) The shift in steam cracking feedstock toward shale gas, coupled with the growth in propylene demand, have motivated the introduction of “on-purpose” propylene production processes, such as catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH). (2,3)
PDH is an endothermic reaction, performed around 600 °C over alkaline-promoted bimetallic platinum or chromium oxide catalysts. (1) Platinum catalysts are often preferred because of their higher activity and selectivity and lower environmental footprint. (2) At elevated temperatures, alkane dehydrogenation is accompanied (i) by unwanted side reactions that lead to coke formation, where carbon deposits cover active sites and block pores, and (ii) by sintering, where active sites are lost via the growth of platinum particles. (1,2)
Platinum catalysts are often promoted by tin (4−6) or gallium (7,8) to reduce sintering and coke formation. Tin reduces coke formation by facilitating the desorption of the propylene product. (6) Tin also assists in platinum redispersion during oxidative regeneration and does this by providing nucleation sites on the alumina support. (6) To further enhance the catalyst’s lifetime, promoters such as indium, iridium, and germanium are sometimes introduced to mitigate carbon formation. (9−11)
A typical catalyst support for PDH is high-surface-area γ-Al2O3, which exhibits good thermal stability, mechanical strength, and high platinum dispersion. (2) However, the presence of acid sites can catalyze isomerization, cracking, oligomerization, and polymerization reactions, all of which enhance coke formation under PDH conditions. (2,12) Therefore, the support’s acidity is often reduced by the introduction of alkali promoters such as magnesium, sodium, potassium, and lanthanum. (4,13−15)
While many research efforts have addressed the deactivation of platinum catalysts during PDH, coke formation continues to be one of the most challenging deactivation problems, and thus the search for more efficient promoters continues. Recently, it has been shown that the introduction of small amounts of boron reduces coke formation on nickel (16) during steam reforming and on cobalt (17) during Fischer–Tropsch synthesis. DFT calculations indicate that, under the respective reaction conditions, boron atoms selectively block step and/or subsurface sites, thus preventing the nucleation and growth of deactivating carbon, (18,19) although other promoting effects have been proposed as well. (20−26) The nature of boron, as an alloy, an amorphous oxide, or both, depends on the catalytic system and on the reaction conditions. Recently, the effect of boron promotion on the stability of platinum clusters was evaluated by Alexandrova et al. (27,28) DFT studies suggest that the introduction of atomic reduced boron in platinum clusters enhances cluster–support binding via the formation of a B–O bond and reduces the alkene and carbon affinity of the platinum clusters, thus minimizing coke formation. These computational results were supported by ethylene decomposition experiments over size-selected Pt–B clusters. (28) More recently, a Pt–B–Si catalyst was studied for the dehydrogenation of n-butane under low alkane partial pressure conditions. (29) In these experiments, boron promotion was found to enhance catalytic activity and stability. An extensive XPS investigation was performed; however, no conclusions on alloy formation were obtained. Indeed, the authors mention that the platinum–boron interaction is complicated and requires further investigation.
In this work, Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts are promoted with boron to enhance their performance during PDH. A systematic approach was followed, where a series of catalysts with different boron loadings was prepared using various impregnation sequences. Catalytic tests evaluate the effect of boron on the catalysts’ activity, selectivity, and stability. Detailed characterization and thermodynamic DFT calculations help identify the nature, location, and state of the boron promoter.

2.1. Catalyst Preparation
B-γ-Al2O3 support materials were prepared via wet impregnation of aqueous H3BO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, >99.5 wt %) onto commercial γ-Al2O3 (NorPro, SBET = 240 m2 g–1) to reach a maximum boron loading of 5.6 wt %. The mixture was stirred continuously at 50 °C until total evaporation of the solvent and then calcined in stagnant air at 650 °C for 4 h. The supports are referred to according to their corresponding boron loadings, XB-γ-Al2O3, where X = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 5.6 wt %. The highest boron loading, 5.6 wt %, is sufficient for a B2O3 monolayer coverage of 0.75, calculated using the surface area of the support, the density of trigonal boron oxide, and a monolayer thickness based on the dimensions of its unit cell.
Three different synthesis routes were followed. (1) Pt/XB-γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared via wet impregnation of aqueous H2PtCl6 (Sigma-Aldrich, 39 wt % Pt) onto XB-γ-Al2O3 support materials. The mixture was stirred continuously at 50 °C until total evaporation of the solvent and then calcined in stagnant air at 650 °C for 4 h. (2) In order to evaluate the effect of the impregnation sequence, 1B/Pt-γ-Al2O3 was prepared via wet impregnation of aqueous H3BO3 onto Pt/γ-Al2O3: i.e., an inverse sequential impregnation. (3) Finally, Pt-1B-γ-Al2O3 was prepared by coimpregnation of boron and platinum, followed by solvent evaporation and calcination. The platinum loading in all the catalysts was fixed at 3 wt %. For 1 wt % B, this loading corresponds to a B/Pt atomic ratio of 6. The platinum and boron loadings were selected to facilitate characterization and to obtain B/Pt molar ratios between 0 and 10. Pt/γ-Al2O3 was prepared as a reference catalyst.
2.2. Catalyst Characterization
The elemental composition of the catalysts was determined by inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, iCAP 6500, Thermo Scientific). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)–EDX images were obtained with a Cs-corrected microscope (JEM 2200-FS, JEOL), operated at 200 kV and equipped with a Schottky-type field-emission gun, with an in-column ω filter. All samples were prepared by immersion onto a copper grid.
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area was determined from N2 physisorption at −196 °C (Tristar II, Micromeritics) after degassing the sample for 4 h at 200 °C. The metal dispersion was determined from H2 pulse chemisorption at ambient temperature and pressure (Autochem II 2920, Micromeritics). The calcined catalyst was loaded into a U-shaped quartz tube reactor and reduced in 1.67 N mL s–1 of 10 vol % H2 at 600 °C with a temperature ramp of 10 °C min–1 for 30 min, followed by cooling in helium. After the sample reached ambient temperature, 1 N mL of 10 vol % H2 was pulsed every 2 min until the TCD response indicated surface saturation.
Acidity measurements were performed by temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) with NH3 (Autochem II 2920, Micromeritics). The calcined sample was loaded into a U-shaped quartz tube reactor and heated to 600 °C in helium with a temperature ramp of 10 °C min–1 to remove adsorbed compounds: i.e., mainly CO2 and water. Subsequently, the sample was cooled to 100 °C in helium, exposed to 1 N mL s–1 of NH3/He (3.996 vol % NH3, Air Liquide) for 2 h, followed by evacuation for 30 min: i.e., the time required to obtain a constant TCD baseline. The TPD spectrum was obtained for a linear temperature ramp of 5 °C min–1 up to 650 °C in 1 N mL s–1 helium. These experiments were repeated at least twice for each sample.
2.3. Catalyst Testing
The catalysts were tested in a tubular quartz microreactor with an internal diameter of 7 mm, housed inside a three-zone electric furnace. For each experiment, 100 mg of the calcined sample, with 150–300 μm particle size, was diluted with inert α-Al2O3 of the same size (sample/inert weight ratio 1/5). The temperature of the bed was measured with a type-K thermocouple, axially positioned in the center of the catalyst bed. Thermal mass flow controllers (EL-Flow, Bronkhorst) were used to control the inlet gas flow rates.
The effluent was analyzed with a mass spectrometer (ThermoStar GSD 300, Pfeiffer Vacuum) using the multiple ion detection mode. H2 was monitored at a m/z ratio of 2, He at 4, CH4 at 16, H2O at 18, CO at 28, C3H8 at 29, Ar at 40, C3H6 at 41, and CO2 at 44. Unavoidable interferences due to overlapping fragments were resolved by a signal correction. For example, since propane and propylene produce the same fragment at m/z 41, a signal correction factor was used to obtain the propylene signal. Similarly, the argon signal was corrected by removing contributions from propane and propylene to the fragment at m/z 40. The correction factors were determined by flowing pure compounds through an empty reactor and recording the ratios between the fragments. This calibration was performed before every experiment. In all experiments, the carbon balance was closed within 10%. The role of internal and external mass transfer limitations as well as heat transfer limitations could be discarded on the basis of dimensionless criteria. (30)
The catalysts were reduced inside the reactor in 1.67 N mL s–1 of 10 vol % H2 at 600 °C with a temperature ramp of 10 °C min–1 for 30 min and then flushed with argon for 10 min. The activation procedure for the screening experiments consisted of reduction, a 20 min reaction period, and a regeneration cycle. During the regeneration cycle, 1 N mL s–1 10 vol % O2 was introduced for 5 min to remove carbon deposits, followed by reduction for 30 min, both at the reaction temperature.
After the activation procedure, a mixture of 20 vol % C3H8, H2, and Ar (W/FC3H8 = 3.0 kgcat s molC3H8–1, H2/C3H8 = 1, internal standard Ar) was introduced. Propylene, hydrogen, and methane were the major products detected. The activity measured during the second 20 min cycle is reported. The catalyst was hence exposed to one oxidation treatment before assessing its performance. Long-term stability experiments were performed for 12 h of reaction, under the same conditions.
In addition, experiments without cofeeding hydrogen were performed using a mixture of 8 vol % C3H8 and Ar (W/FC3H8 = 11.2 kgcat s molC3H8–1), at the same temperature, pressure, and catalyst/inert dilution ratio, for 4 h. Standard errors were obtained from three independent experiments.
The conversion is defined as
(1)
where FC3H8,0 and FC3H8 are the inlet and outlet molar flow rates (mol s–1) of propane, relative to the internal standard, respectively.
The selectivity to propylene is defined as
(2)
where FC3H6 is the molar flow rate of propylene at the outlet of the reactor.
The propylene space–time yield (STY) and propane turnover frequency (TOF) are defined as
(3)
where NPt_surf (mol) is the number of surface platinum atoms determined by H2 chemisorption.
The total amount of propylene formed during an experiment was used to calculate the carbon to propylene ratio, a measure of the selectivity toward the desired product.
TPO was used to quantify the amount of deposited carbon. First, the sample was cooled to ambient temperature in argon. Subsequently, the sample was exposed to 1.1 N mL s–1 of 10 vol % O2 at ambient temperature for 5 min to stabilize the MS signal, before heating to 750 °C with a temperature ramp of 20 °C min–1. CO2 and CO responses were monitored as carbon deposits were combusted. The normalized CO2 signal was used for quantification as no CO was detected.
Considering that carbon formation on the support originates from propylene, we investigated propylene decomposition over Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/1B-γ-Al2O3. A 100 mg sample was reduced in the reactor in 10 vol % H2 (see above) and exposed to a mixture of 10 vol % C3H6 (W/FC3H6= 7.3 kgcat s molC3H6–1) and Ar (internal standard) at 600 °C. In addition, experiments in the presence of hydrogen were performed using 20 vol % C3H6, H2, and Ar (W/FC3H6= 3.0 kgcat s molC3H6–1, H2/C3H6 = 1, internal standard Ar). The experiments were performed at the same temperature, pressure, and catalyst/inert dilution ratio outlined above. After 30 min of reaction, the amount of carbon was quantified.
2.4. Computational Methods
The stability and nature of boron on platinum, nickel, and alumina was evaluated by computing Gibbs free energies with the vdW-DF2 functional (31,32) as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP), (33) and a PAW basis set with a cutoff kinetic energy of 450 eV. The selection of the vdW-DF2 functional was motivated by its accurate description of the adsorption of different species on metal surfaces. (34) An energy convergence criteria of 10–6 eV and a maximum force tolerance of 10–3 eV Å−1 were applied. Enthalpy and entropy corrections were obtained for translational, rotational, and vibrational contributions. The nickel and platinum (111) surfaces were modeled as five-layer p(3 × 3) slabs. Step sites were modeled with a five-layer p(4 × 6) slab, where three rows of surface atoms were removed. The Brillouin zone was sampled with 3 × 3 × 1 and 3 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack grids, respectively. The γ-Al2O3 (110) surface was modeled as a four-layer slab. The Brillouin zone was sampled with 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack grids. Gibbs free energies for the surfaces were calculated considering the vibrational contributions of the surface functional groups: e.g., surface-hydroxyl as in γ-Al2O3–OH. In all surface models, the top two layers were relaxed while the bottom layers were fixed at bulk positions. Repeated slabs are separated by a 15 Å vacuum layer to avoid interactions. The optimized lattice parameters, 4.09 Å for platinum and 3.61 Å for nickel, slightly exceed the experimental values of 3.92 and 3.52 Å. (35)
3. Results and Discussion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
3.1. Catalyst Screening
A series of boron-promoted Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were prepared to evaluate the effect of boron loading and impregnation sequence on the catalysts’ performance during PDH at 600 °C. The propane conversion in the experiments was limited between 10% and 20% to maintain the reaction within the kinetic regime, eliminating effects of transport phenomena. The data in Table 1 were obtained during the 20 min catalyst screening period (see above). The sequential addition of 1 wt % boron to Pt/γ-Al2O3 reduces both the activity and the amount of deposited carbon. The reduction in the amount of carbon is, however, completely due to the reduced activity; in fact, the ratio between the deposited carbon and the produced propylene over the 20 min test increases by 30%. This decrease in activity is hence consistent with a reduction in the number of active sites. Reversing the impregnation sequence, namely first modifying the γ-Al2O3 support with boron, followed by platinum impregnation, has a minor effect on the activity but reduces the amount of deposited carbon by a factor of 2.6. Coimpregnation leads to intermediate catalytic performance and to a carbon to propylene ratio that is nearly identical to that of the unpromoted catalyst.

The importance of the impregnation sequence was also reported for Ni/γ-Al2O3 and for Co/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. (16,17) However, different from platinum, the promoting effect of boron was only observed when the boron promoter was introduced after the active metal. For cobalt and nickel, DFT calculations and XPS characterization indicate that there is a strong interaction between reduced boron atoms and the active metal, likely forming a surface alloy. (16,17) The similar selectivity and lower activity of the catalyst where boron was introduced after platinum are consistent with a reduction in the number of active sites rather than the formation of a Pt–B alloy. The data in Table 1 thus suggest that a Pt–B surface alloy is not formed. Promotion with boron does improve the performance of Pt/γ-Al2O3, but the mechanism by which the performance is improved is likely very different from that observed with nickel and cobalt catalysts.
Once the most promising impregnation sequence was identified, the effect of boron loading was evaluated (Table 1). Both the activity and carbon formation are affected by the boron loading. Figure 1 shows that the addition of boron to the γ-Al2O3 support has a larger effect on the amount of carbon than on the propylene yield, and the introduction of 1.5 wt % boron decreases the carbon to propylene ratio for the 20 min experiment by a factor of 4. Note that 1.5 wt % boron roughly corresponds to a 0.2 monolayer coverage of B2O3 on the γ-Al2O3 support.

3.2. Extended Stability Tests
On the basis of the screening experiments, Pt/1B-γ-Al2O3 was selected for a 12 h stability test and characterization. The performance of Pt/1B-γ-Al2O3 in comparison to the reference Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is shown in Figure 2. Boron promotion clearly enhances both the stability and selectivity of the platinum catalyst. The initial activities of both catalysts are similar with comparable turnover frequencies (TOF, Table 2), suggesting that boron does not significantly influence the activity of sites for propane dehydrogenation. After 12 h, the promoted catalyst is 40% more active than the reference catalyst, and the total propylene yield is 45% higher (Table 2). The reference catalyst loses 40% of its initial activity in the first 4 h, after which deactivation becomes more gradual. Deactivation of the promoted catalyst is significantly slower in the first 4 h, with only a 20% loss in activity. The second, more gradual deactivation rate is comparable for both catalysts and could be attributed to a deactivation mechanism other than carbon deposition. Two distinct deactivation regimes were also reported by Zhu et al. (36) during propane dehydrogenation. Redekop et al. (37) showed that during the rapid initial deactivation period, undercoordinated platinum sites promote structure-sensitive deep dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis reactions. As these sites become passivated with carbon, both the methane selectivity and the rate of carbon formation decrease. The slower initial deactivation for the boron-promoted catalyst thus suggests that boron modifies or blocks these defect sites on platinum. This hypothesis is consistent with the higher propylene selectivity for the boron-promoted catalyst (Figure 2).

dCarbon deposited divided by the total amount of propylene produced during the stability test (mol C (mol C3H6)−1)
The amount and the reactivity of the coke formed after 12 h on stream were analyzed by TPO (Figure 3a). Boron promotion reduces the total amount of deposited carbon by a factor of 2.7 and the carbon to propylene ratio by a factor of 3.2 (Table 2). This indicates that not only is carbon deposition significantly reduced but also propylene selectivity is enhanced. As a consequence, the boron-promoted catalyst was exposed to somewhat higher propylene partial pressures and would be expected to form more coke. The TPO profile for Pt/γ-Al2O3 shows a dominant peak at 505 °C and a second peak at 630 °C. Promotion with boron (Pt/1B-γ-Al2O3) dramatically modifies the TPO profile, as seen from the near-to-complete elimination of carbon removed in the 250–550 °C region and a reduction in the amount of carbon removed at higher temperatures.

The effect of boron loading on the total amount of deposited carbon is shown in the inset bar graph.
According to the literature, (38−41) three types of coke are found on Pt/γ-Al2O3: (1) carbonaceous species on the metal and its vicinity, (2) carbonaceous species on the support, and (3) graphitic species on the support. The first peak (250–550 °C) on the spent Pt/γ-Al2O3 TPO profile (Figure 3a) is associated with carbonaceous species rich in hydrogen, deposited both on platinum and on the support. As the time on stream increases, the amount of carbon deposited on the metal sites becomes insignificant in comparison to the carbon deposited on the support, and the two peaks become indistinguishable. (38) The second peak (550–750 °C) is associated with graphitized carbon that is difficult to oxidize. This peak is often attributed to carbon and carbon precursors that have migrated from platinum to the support. (40−42)
The promotional effect of boron was confirmed in experiments without cofeeding hydrogen (Table 3). During these tests, the propane conversion was only 2–3% for Pt/γ-Al2O3 and 4–5% for Pt/1B-γ-Al2O3 (Figure S1a). Again, boron promotion reduces the amount of deposited carbon after 4 h by a factor of 2. The corresponding TPO profile for Pt/γ-Al2O3 (Figure S1b) now shows peaks at 300, 435, and 620 °C, corresponding to the three types of carbon discussed above; the TPO profiles (Figure S1b) are significantly affected by boron promotion. Another set of experiments, where propane was replaced by propylene while cofeeding hydrogen, reveals the same reduction in carbon formation after boron promotion (Table 3). The higher reduction in the amount of carbon in the second set of experiments indicates that boron has a stronger effect on carbon formed from propylene.

To further analyze the effect of boron on the reactivity of deposited carbon, 30 min of propylene decomposition experiments over γ-Al2O3 supports with different boron loadings and without platinum were performed. The amount and reactivity of the carbon deposited on boron-modified supports are lower than on pure γ-Al2O3. Specifically, the amount of carbon deposited on the 1B-γ-Al2O3 support is 1 order of magnitude lower than that deposited on the pure support. Coke formation on γ-Al2O3 has been attributed to the presence of high-temperature acid sites, (3) and the decrease in the amount of carbon indicates that boron has a strong effect on the acid sites of the support.
The TPO profiles (Figure 3b) suggest that the peak at 500 °C in Figure 3a corresponds to carbon formed from propylene on the γ-Al2O3 support. The addition of boron dramatically suppresses the formation of such carbon species and increases the carbon combustion temperature. This shift could be due to a more extensive graphitization of the deposited carbon or to carbon formed at different sites of the support that are not affected by boron promotion.
Note that carbon on γ-Al2O3 is activated at temperatures as low as 300 °C and this occurs without platinum. This suggests that, in the presence of platinum, TPO peaks at 250–350 °C correspond, mainly, to carbon formed on the support and not carbon on platinum as attributed in the literature. (39,41) The amount of carbon removed in the 250–350 °C range after the long-term stability test over Pt/γ-Al2O3 is 129 μmol carbon gcat−1 and is larger than the number of exposed platinum sites, 25 μmol gcat−1. These calculations and the remaining activity at the end of the stability test (Figure 2) indicate that a significant fraction of that carbon is located on the support.
The TPO profiles of the spent catalysts in this section are in good agreement with those reported for other boron-promoted systems. (16,43−45) Raman spectra of spent boron-promoted Ni/SBA-15 after dry reforming experiments showed that a larger fraction of the deposited carbon was graphitic. (44) In another study, (45) the TPO profiles of spent boron-promoted and unpromoted HZSM-5 catalysts after methanol to olefins reactions were compared. Other than reducing the amount of carbon deposited, boron promotion resulted in carbon depositions that were more difficult to oxidize. (45) The effect of boron promotion on coke formation thus extends to other systems under different reaction conditions; however, questions regarding the state of the boron promoter remain and are further discussed below.
3.3. Catalyst Characterization
TEM images (Figure S2) give mean platinum particle sizes of 1.1 and 1.6 nm for Pt/γ-Al2O3 and Pt/1B-γ-Al2O3, respectively (Table 4). Hydrogen pulse chemisorption at ambient temperature shows a higher hydrogen uptake, within experimental error, for Pt/1B-γ-Al2O3 than for Pt/γ-Al2O3. The hydrogen uptake corresponds with a dispersion of 16–18% and a particle size of 5–6 nm, larger than the average particle size obtained by TEM. XRD patterns (Figure S3) of the promoted catalysts and of the borated γ-Al2O3 show no boron oxide diffraction peaks, indicating that boron is present as particles smaller than 3 nm or as an amorphous phase. This is consistent with the equilibrium phase diagram for borated γ-Al2O3. (46)In situ XRD measurements for the promoted catalyst under a hydrogen atmosphere at 600 °C do not show any shift in platinum’s most intense peak at 39.8° (Figure S4), thus excluding the formation of a bulk Pt–B alloy. The BET surface area (Table 4) was not affected by boron promotion; pore filling does not take place at these loadings. EDX mapping (Figure S5) reveals a uniform distribution of boron over the sample, suggesting that boron oxide also does not form larger particles during calcination.

Since the formation of carbon deposits on the γ-Al2O3 support is related to its acid sites, (3) NH3-TPD experiments were performed to investigate the effect of boron on the acidity of the catalysts (Figure 4). Ammonia can interact with electron acceptor sites, with acidic protons, and with neutral or acidic hydroxyl groups. (47) There is general consensus in the literature regarding the distinction among weak, medium, and strong acid sites. (48) Oligomerization and polymerization reactions which lead to carbon deposition have been attributed in particular to the strong acid sites. (49,50)
Figure 4
Figure 4. NH3-TPD profiles of γ-Al2O3 (red —), 1B-γ-Al2O3 (blue − −), and 5.6B-γ-Al2O3 (orange ···). The addition of boron significantly reduces the number of strong acid sites and increases the number of weak acid sites. The same sample weight was used for all experiments.
NH3-TPD of the γ-Al2O3 support shows distinct peaks at 165 and 275 °C and a broader feature above 350 °C, corresponding to weak, medium, and strong acid sites, respectively. The introduction of 1 wt % boron drastically reduces the number of medium and strong acid sites and slightly increases the number of weak acid sites. Increasing the boron loading to 5.6 wt % doubles the number of weak acid sites and reduces the number of strong acid sites 4-fold. A similar increase in the number of weak acid sites has been reported by Yang et al. (51) for ZSM-5 after promotion with boron. These finding are in line with microcalorimetry studies of dried borated alumina by Colorio et al. (52,53) The reduction in medium and strong acid sites by the introduction of boron is consistent with the reduced formation of deposited carbon on the support during PDH.
The interaction of boron with both platinum and the support were evaluated using first-principles thermodynamics (Figure 5). The stability of boron on the platinum surface (Figure S6) and the interaction of boric acid with surface hydroxyls on γ-Al2O3 (110) (Figure S7) were considered. Boron on a nickel step (B5) site was calculated for comparison.

Figure 5. Gibbs free energy for the formation of boron species on platinum and nickel surfaces and on γ-Al2O3 (110) relative to boric acid; H3BO3(g) + 3/2H2(g) + * ⇌ B* + 3H2O (g), γ-Al2O3–OH(s) + H3BO3(g) ⇌ γ-Al2O3–OB(OH)2(s) + H2O (g), and H3BO3(g) ⇌ 1/2B2O3(s) + 3/2H2O(g). (54)
Reduced boron atoms bind rather weakly on platinum—about 130 kJ molB−1 weaker than on nickel. For all of the Pt−B surface structures, a very positive Gibbs free energy of formation was calculated, indicating that boric acid and boron oxide are thermodynamically more stable than the considered surface alloys. Boron on a nickel step site, however, is more favorable than boric acid at temperatures above 700 °C and is only 27 and 20 kJ molB–1 less favorable than boron oxide at 700 and 800 °C, respectively. This Gibbs free energy of formation can be overcome by sufficiently high hydrogen pressures or temperatures, leading to the formation of a surface alloy. This is consistent with the observation of reduced boron species on Ni/γ-Al2O3 catalysts (16) and with the stability of Ni–B alloys. (19) The platinum–boron interaction is much less favorable, and the formation of reduced boron species even under strongly reducing conditions, as during PDH, is highly unlikely. The formation of a borated surface, γ-Al2O3–OB(OH)2(s), via the reaction of boric acid with surface hydroxyl groups, occurs below 100 °C and is nearly as favorable as the formation of boron oxide at room temperature. During calcination, boron oxide is more stable, and the calculations suggest that boron oxide is formed upon loss of water. Finally, while Pt−B alloys can be synthesized, e.g., using diborane as a boron source, (28) the synthesis procedure followed here will lead to the formation of boron oxides after calcination and reduction.
4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The promotion of Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with an optimum amount of boron reduces carbon deposition and enhances the propylene selectivity during propane dehydrogenation, leading to an increase in productivity. Interestingly, only the introduction of boron before platinum enhances the carbon resistance and the selectivity; introduction of boron after platinum only reduces the activity. Specifically, promotion with 1 wt % boron decreases the amount of carbon 3-fold and increases the propylene selectivity from 90 to 98% over a 12 h PDH experiment. This enhanced performance corresponds to a 40% increase in the total propylene yield.
NH3-TPD and propylene decomposition indicate that boron removes medium and strong acid sites from γ-Al2O3, which are responsible for coke formation by propylene oligomerization. Catalyst characterization and DFT calculations indicate that the boron promoter is present as a finely dispersed amorphous oxide both on the support and on the platinum particles. The formation of reduced boron species and of a Pt–B surface alloy are highly unfavorable. The present study suggests boron as a promising alternative to conventional promoters for platinum-based alkane dehydrogenation catalysts.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
