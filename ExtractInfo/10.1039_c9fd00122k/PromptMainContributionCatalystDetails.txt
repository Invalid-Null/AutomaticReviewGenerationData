Addressing the uncertainty of DFT-determined hydrogenation mechanisms over coinage metal surfaces†
Density functional theory (DFT) has been considered as a powerful tool for the identification of reaction mechanisms. However, it is still unclear whether the error of DFT calculations would lead to mis-identification of mechanisms. Here, taking the hydrogenation of acetylene and 1,3-butadiene as model reactions and employing a well-trained Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF-vdW), we try to estimate the error of DFT calculation results statistically, and therefore predict the reliability of the hydrogenation mechanisms identified. With an ensemble of 2000 functionals obtained around the BEEF-vdW functional as well as a descriptor developed to represent the possibility of different mechanisms, we found that the non-Horiuti–Polanyi mechanism is preferred on Ag(211) and Au(211), while the Horiuti–Polanyi mechanism is dominant on Cu(211). We further discovered that the descriptor is linearly correlated with the adsorption energies of reaction intermediates during acetylene and butadiene hydrogenation, and the hydrogenation of strongly adsorbed species are more likely to follow the Horiuti–Polanyi mechanism. We found the probability of following the non-HP mechanism obeys the order Cu(211) < Au(211) < Ag(211). Our work gives a more comprehensive explanation for the mechanisms of coinage metal catalyzed hydrogenation reactions, and also provides more theoretical insights into the development of new high-performance catalysts for selective hydrogenation reactions.
1 Introduction
Catalysis plays an essential part in society because of its large contribution to economies,1 the key issue in the development of catalytic processes is to understand the underlying reaction mechanisms. In the petroleum industry, selective removal of highly unsaturated hydrocarbons is an important step in cracking-gas processes, because these unsaturated hydrocarbons act as impurities in the feed gas and also would poison the downstream polymerization catalyst.2 Industrially these highly unsaturated hydrocarbons are expected to be selectively hydrogenated to their corresponding alkenes, e.g., acetylene should be selectively hydrogenated to ethylene.3 Although Pd-based catalysts are commonly used for this process,4–7 they suffer from deactivation. Recently, coinage metals, i.e., Cu, Ag and Au, have been proposed as promising hydrogenation catalysts in view of their high selectivity to semi-hydrogenation products and strong resistance to deactivation, but the hydrogenation mechanisms are still unclear.8–12
Mechanistic studies on heterogeneous hydrogenation reactions can be traced back to the 1930s,13 and the best known mechanism for hydrogenation reactions is the Horiuti–Polanyi (HP) mechanism proposed in 1934.14–17 According to HP, the H2 firstly undergoes dissociation followed by sequential addition of atomic H to the substrates. However, we recently proposed a mechanism that molecular hydrogen can directly hydrogenate the substrates without dissociation, namely the non-Horiuti–Polanyi (non-HP) mechanism. We found that the terminal O atom of acrolein can be preferentially hydrogenated by H2 rather than atomic H over Au(211).18 Further studies revealed that hydrogenation of the C atom within acetylene and butadiene may also follow the non-HP mechanism.18–21 Moreover, Vilé et al. conducted experimental and theoretical studies to suggest that the non-HP mechanism is possibly favored for semi-hydrogenation of propyne over supported Ag nanoparticles.22
Although several studies have provided theoretical methods to assign a favorable hydrogenation mechanism, it is sometimes inaccurate to classify a hydrogenation reaction into either the HP or non-HP mechanism group by only comparing the energetics of different reaction pathways, especially when the energy difference between effective transition states of HP and non-HP mechanisms is within the error of density functional theory (DFT). In addition, common functionals such as PW91 and PBE fail to accurately obtain both physical quantities and chemical properties at the same time, and if you only use these functionals, long-range van der Waals interactions between the adsorbate and surface are inaccurately depicted.23,24 To circumvent such problems, Nørskov and co-workers used a machine learning approach to develop a well-trained Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF-vdW),24,25 which provides the possibility to assess the uncertainties of DFT-calculated properties. Recently, Gong’s group, using this BEEF-vdW functional, performed probability-based screening of the propane dehydrogenation reaction over Pt-based catalysts, and more importantly, estimated the uncertainty to ensure reliability when searching for good catalysts.26
In order to reveal the uncertainty in the identification of hydrogenation mechanisms, herein we systematically calculated the energetics of different hydrogenation pathways of acetylene and butadiene over coinage metal (211) surfaces with BEEF-vdW. The obtained results were used to carry out probability analysis to show the preferred mechanism for a given reaction. By employing the ensemble of functionals generated around BEEF-vdW and statistical analysis, we disclose for the first time the probability of the HP and non-HP mechanisms for acetylene and butadiene hydrogenation over the considered surfaces, which offers new insights into the quantitative analysis of reaction mechanisms and the assessment procedures for rational catalyst design.
2 Computational details
In this work, all the DFT calculations were performed within a periodic slab model using VASP software27–30 and the BEEF-vdW functional.23,24 The electron–core interaction was described by projector augmented wave (PAW) method.31,32 The cutoff energy was 500 eV, and the convergence criterion of force on each relaxed atom was set to be 0.05 eV Å−1. Twelve-layer 1 × 4 (211) surface slabs of Cu, Ag and Au were built for the optimizations. The bottom six-layer atoms were fixed to simulate the bulk structure while the other atoms were allowed to relax. We used a vacuum layer higher than 12 Å in each slab model to avoid spurious self-interactions. The k-meshes were 4 × 2 × 1 to describe the surface Brillouin zone. The computational settings relating to (211) surfaces are similar to those in our previous work.33–37 The transition states were located using the constrained minimization method,18,38–42 and the obtained transition states were characterized by only one imaginary frequency. Zero-point energy correction was included in the current work. The adsorption energy (Eads) was calculated with the following equation:
Eads = Etot − Eslab − Egas
where Etot is the total energy of the slab after adsorption, Eslab and Egas is the energy of the slab and the gaseous adsorbate. For C2H3 and C4H7, the gas-phase energy was calculated with the sum of C2H2 and 0.5H2 energy and the sum of C4H6 and 0.5H2 energy, respectively.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Horiuti–Polanyi vs. non-Horiuti–Polanyi
In this work we study the selective hydrogenation of acetylene (C2H2) and butadiene (C4H6) via the HP and non-HP mechanisms, which are illustrated with examples in Scheme 1. In the HP mechanism pathway, the H2 from the gas phase firstly dissociates into surface atomic H with a transition state of TS1. Subsequently, the surface atomic H reacts with the adsorbate to undergo the hydrogenation reaction, and the transition state of this process is represented by TS2. In contrast, the non-HP mechanism describes a process in which the adsorbate directly interacts with molecular H2 to undergo hydrogenation. One can find that both HP and non-HP mechanisms have the same reactant and same product whilst the energetics may differ from each other.

3.2 Selective hydrogenation of C2H2 to C2H4
The desired product from C2H2 selective hydrogenation is C2H4, and whether C2H4 can desorb from the surface or undergo further hydrogenation determines the selectivity. Therefore, we consider in this work the following process:
The adsorption energies of these species are listed in Table 1 and the corresponding configurations are presented in Fig. S1 of the ESI.† One can see from Fig. S1† that, on Cu(211) and Au(211), C2H2 adsorbs at the step edge site, while the B5 site over Ag(211) is favored for the adsorption of C2H2. C2H3 adsorbs at the bridge site along the upper step edge over all three surfaces. C2H4 is preferentially adsorbed at the step edge site with a π-bonded configuration over all the surfaces considered. Although the adsorption configurations of C2H2, C2H3 and C2H4 are mostly identical compared with those in our previous work,19 the calculated adsorption energies obtained in the current work differ from previous results by 0.1–0.8 eV. Such discrepancy, as has been revealed in the Introduction section, may be explained by the different functionals used, and the included van der Waals interactions in the current work. In addition, C2H4 adsorbs on these three surfaces with adsorption energies (Eads,C2H4) ranging from −0.36 to 0.24 eV, while the hydrogenation barriers of C2H4 (Ea,C2H4) vary between 0.59 and 1.35 eV. Using the descriptor for selectivity analysis that we proposed before, i.e., Ea,C2H4 − |Eads,C2H4|,19,41–44 we found that the semi-hydrogenation product C2H4 would prefer to desorb from these surfaces rather than undergo further hydrogenation to C2H6, and therefore high C2H4 selectivity during C2H2 hydrogenation can be expected.

Ag(211) 0.88 0.27 −0.94 −0.19
Au(211) 0.64 −0.23 −1.17 0.24
The activation energies of the elementary steps within C2H2 hydrogenation following the HP and non-HP mechanisms are listed in Table 2. To compare the energetics of HP and non-HP mechanisms, here we use the effective barrier analysis approach as proposed before18,19,21 and plot the energy profiles obtained from BEEF-vdW in Fig. S2.† Since the initial state for both HP and non-HP mechanisms are the same, one can compare the energy of effective transition states in the energy profiles directly, to infer the preferential hydrogenation mechanism. For the HP mechanism, the effective transition state can be defined as max(TS1, TS2), i.e., the higher energies between TS1 and TS2. The effective transition state for the non-HP mechanism is simply the transition state of the hydrogenation process with molecular H2 (termed as TS3). The results in Fig. S2† clearly show that the HP mechanism is dominant over Cu(211), while non-HP mechanisms may preferentially take place over Ag(211). For Au(211), the hydrogenation of C2H2 may undergo both HP and non-HP mechanisms, but the non-HP mechanism seems favorable for the hydrogenation of C2H3 and C2H4.

The results shown in Fig. S2† are obtained from BEEF-vdW calculations and they are generally consistent with those in the literature.19 However, the identification of favorable hydrogenation mechanisms with the above method is sometimes inaccurate when the effective barriers of the two mechanisms are indistinguishable, e.g., the energy of max(TS1, TS2) is close to that of TS3 for the C2H2 hydrogenation over Au(111). In this case the confidence of assigning a mechanism is lowered. To solve the problem, we utilized an ensemble of 2000 energies generated around BEEF-vdW to visualize the favorable mechanisms for C2H2 hydrogenation, and the results are shown in Fig. 1. We define ΔE as the difference between the energy of TS3 and the energy of max(TS1, TS2), and negative ΔE values suggest that the non-HP mechanism is preferred. For example, one can see from Fig. 1 that most of the Ag(211) histograms lie below 0, meaning that it would be with high confidence to claim that the hydrogenation reactions considered on this surface would follow the non-HP mechanism.
Fig. 1 Histogram of the probability of ΔE for (a) C2H2, (b) C2H3 and (c) C2H4 hydrogenation reaction over Cu(211), Ag(211) and Au(211). ΔE measures the extent of the preferential hydrogenation mechanism between the HP and non-HP mechanisms, the definition of ΔE is discussed in the main text. Negative ΔE suggests that the non-HP mechanism is favored, and HP mechanism is preferred when ΔE is positive. Gaussian distributions are fitted from the histogram, shown as solid lines.
To quantitatively analyze the trends obtained above, we classify the ensemble of 2000ΔE into positive or negative and calculate their proportions with respect to 2000, the results are shown in Fig. 2. We found that the hydrogenation of C2H2, C2H3 and C2H4 have 99% probability of following the non-HP mechanism over Ag(211), in accordance with the results shown in Fig. 1. In contrast, the probabilities of the HP mechanism being preferred over Cu(211) are all larger than 75%, suggesting that the HP mechanism is more likely to be the dominant hydrogenation mechanism over Cu(211). Moreover, the ΔE values over Au(211) are between those over Ag(111) and Cu(211), suggesting that the preference of the non-HP mechanism on Au(211) is intermediate compared with Ag(111) and Cu(211).

The adsorption energy (Eads) of the substrate being hydrogenated might correlate with the transition state energies of the hydrogenation reaction according to our recent work.19 Therefore, we also plot in Fig. 3 such a correlation using the ensemble of 2000 energies generated around the BEEF-vdW energy. In Fig. 3(d), a general trend between ΔE and Eads can be found using the average values of the 2000 energies. Weaker adsorption of intermediates would result in more negative ΔE, and therefore the non-HP mechanism might be preferred for the hydrogenation of these intermediates, which is consistent with our previous discoveries.19

The error bars are also given in the figure.
3.3 Hydrogenation of C4H6
In this work, we consider five elementary reactions for the hydrogenation of C4H6 to C4H9, as illustrated in Scheme 2. The adsorption energies of the reactants and intermediates are listed in Table 3 and the corresponding adsorption configurations are given in Fig. S3.† C4H6 are found to adsorb along the step edge of the (211) surfaces with a di-π configuration, and the step edge site is also favored for C4H7 and C4H8 adsorption. The activation energies of the elementary steps included in C4H6 hydrogenation are listed in Table 4. To study the selectivity of C4H8 during C4H6 hydrogenation, here we use Ea,C4H8 − |Eads,C4H8| as a descriptor, where Ea,C4H8 and Eads,C4H8 indicate the hydrogenation barrier of a given butene isomer and its adsorption energy, respectively. This descriptor is similar to Ea,C2H4 − |Eads,C2H4| that measures the selectivity of C2H4. The semi-hydrogenation product C4H8 would favorably desorb from the considered surfaces since the hydrogenation barriers are all higher than the absolute value of the adsorption energies, suggesting that high C4H8 selectivity during C4H6 hydrogenation can be expected on these surfaces.

The energy profiles, calculated with BEEF-vdW, of five elementary steps within C4H6 hydrogenation over the considered surfaces are shown in Fig. S4,† and we can also compare the energy of max(TS1, TS2) with that of TS3 to infer favorable hydrogenation mechanisms. As one can see in Fig. S4,† the HP mechanism is favored for all of the hydrogenation steps over Cu(111). For Ag(211), the HP mechanism is favorable for the hydrogenation of C4H6 and C4H7, while both HP and non-HP mechanisms may be possible for the hydrogenation of 2-t-C4H8 because of the mere ∼0.1 eV difference between the energy of TS3 and that of max(TS1, TS2). Similarly, such a small difference is also observed for the hydrogenation of 1-C4H8 and 2-t-C4H8 on Au(211). These results suggest that the favorable hydrogenation mechanisms determined with BEEF-vdW energies may not be reliable enough for some species during C4H6 hydrogenation over Ag(211) and Au(211).
Further statistical analysis using the ensemble of 2000 energies generated around the BEEF-vdW energies are performed and the results are shown in Fig. 4–6. In Fig. 4, most regions of the ΔE histogram on Ag(211) and Au(211) are negative while those on Cu(211) are positive, meaning that we can confidently claim that the non-HP mechanism is favored over Ag(211) and Au(211), while the HP mechanism is preferable over Cu(211). For C4H6 and C4H7 species, we observe that the peak position of Gaussian distribution curve generally follows the trend of Ag(211) < Au(211) < Cu(211). However, the peak positions over Ag(211) and Au(211) are similar for the hydrogenation of two C4H8 isomers, indicating that the non-HP mechanism is similarly preferred over the two surfaces. To quantitatively study such similarity, here we have measured the probability of favorable hydrogenation mechanisms among the three considered surfaces as shown in Fig. 5. For the hydrogenation of the five reactants and intermediates, the probabilities of following the non-HP mechanism on Ag(211) and Au(211) are all above 70%, and such probabilities on Ag(211) are slightly larger than those on Au(211). Considering the HP mechanism is dominant for all of the hydrogenation steps over Cu(211), the probabilities of following the non-HP mechanism falls in the order of Cu(211) < Au(211) < Ag(211) for all of the reaction steps during C4H6 hydrogenation. This trend is the same as that obtained in the above-mentioned C2H2 hydrogenation section.

In addition, the ensemble of 2000 scatters shown in Fig. 6(a)–(e) suggest that Eads is also correlated with ΔE. In Fig. 6(f), we plot the relation between the average of 2000ΔE and that of 2000Eads, and find that ΔE is linearly correlated with Eads for all of the elementary steps during the C4H6 hydrogenation process, which is consistent with the results in Fig. 3(d) which shows that the HP mechanism would be favorable for the hydrogenation of strongly adsorbed species.

(f) represents the relation between ΔE of the intermediates and their corresponding adsorption energies that are averaged from the ensemble 2000 energies generated around the BEEF-vdW energy.
4 Conclusions
In this work, we used BEEF-vdW to compare two possible hydrogenation mechanisms, namely the Horiuti–Polanyi (HP) and non-Horiuti–Polanyi (non-HP) mechanisms, for the hydrogenation of acetylene and butadiene over Cu(211), Ag(211) and Au(211). Using the ensemble 2000 energies generated around the BEEF-vdW energy, we revealed that the HP mechanism would generally be preferred over Cu(211), while the hydrogenation reactions on Ag(211) and Au(211) would more likely follow the non-HP mechanism, and the probability of following the non-HP mechanism falls in the order Cu(211) < Au(211) < Ag(211). We also found scaling relations between adsorption energies of species and its ΔE, and stronger adsorption would result in a higher possibility of the HP mechanism. Using the proposed probability analysis to study the favorable hydrogenation mechanism, new understanding is expected to be obtained for the rational design of novel coinage-metal catalysts for industrial hydrogenation processes.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
