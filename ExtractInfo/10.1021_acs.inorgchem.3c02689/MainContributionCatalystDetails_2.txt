 Based on my analysis, the supplied document does not appear to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses fabricating a CoTe/PCN Z-scheme heterojunction photocatalyst for photocatalytic CO2 reduction. It does not mention propane dehydrogenation or converting propane to propylene.
