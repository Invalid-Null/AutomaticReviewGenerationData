Adjusting Surface Oxidized Layer of CoTe on PCN via In Situ N-Doping Strategy to Promote Charge Separation of Z-Scheme Heterojunction for Propelling Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction
Abstract
It has been a challenging issue to profoundly actuate the transfer and separation of photoinduced charge carriers by controlling the interface structure inside the heterojunction, owing to the molecular/subnanometric level interface region. Herein, a unique one-dimensional/two-dimensional (1D/2D) CoTe/PCN Z-scheme heterojunction is fabricated through the self-assembly of CoTe nanorods on the surface of polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) nanosheets. Significantly, in situ N-doping in the molecular/subnanometric surface oxidized layer of CoTe nanorods is achieved, effectively adjusting its chemical structure and element chemical states. Moreover, this N-doped surface oxidized layer can serve as a recombination region of photogenerated electrons from PCN and photogenerated holes from CoTe to increase the overall carrier separation efficiency in the Z-scheme heterojunction actuated by the built-in electric field. As a result, the photocatalytic CO2 reduction (CO2R) performance is enhanced dramatically, in which the yield of CO generated over the optimal 1D/2D CoTe/PCN heterojunction reaches up to triple than that over PCN. This unique contribution provides an emblematic paradigm for adjusting the interfacial structure of heterojunction and has a profound insight into the interfacial adjusting mechanism to improve the charge separation efficiency in the photocatalytic reaction.

The N-doped surface oxidized layer can serve as a recombination region of photogenerated electrons from PCN and photogenerated holes from CoTe to impel the overall carrier separation efficiency in heterojunction driven by the built-in electric field, thus dramatically enhancing photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance.

ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The issues of energy shortage and environmental pollution are becoming more and more prominent, which seriously hinders the sustainable development of human society. (1−4) Especially for intensifying the greenhouse effect, it is imperative to take the required tactics to reduce the negative impact of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and develop effective methods to utilize them. (5−11) Harnessing inexhaustible solar energy to drive the conversion of CO2 into high-value chemical products is regarded as a highly promising approach to simultaneously address the global energy demand and escalating environmental issues. (12−16) However, the key to this approach lies in the exploitation of photocatalysts that achieve efficient catalytic ability in the CO2 reduction (CO2R) reaction.
Up to this point, a great amount of significant sustained effort has been dedicated to developing efficient, stable, and cost-effective photocatalysts. Among them, polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) has emerged as a promising nonmetallic polymer photocatalyst due to its inherent merits that comprise preeminent stability, facile synthesis, environment friendliness, favorable energy band structure, etc. (17−22) Nonetheless, the photocatalytic activity of PCN remains unsatisfactory for large-scale applications due to some limitations such as relatively low charge mobility, high recombination probability of carriers, and inadequate solar utilization.
To surmount these issues, it has commonly been adopted to fabricate Z-scheme heterojunctions by coupling PCN with other complementary semiconductors. This is mainly due to the unique absolute superiority of the Z-scheme mechanism that can promote the directed charge transport, enable spatial charge separation inside the heterojunction, and maintain high redox capability of structure units. (23−25) It is well-known that the interfacial structure within the Z-scheme heterojunction determines the transfer and separation efficiency of photoinduced carriers because it is directly related to the recombination ability of photogenerated electrons from one structural unit and photogenerated holes from another structural unit. (26,27) Unfortunately, however, the control of the interface structure is generally difficult to achieve on account of the molecular/subnanometric level interface region; thus, it seems to have reached a bottleneck for further improving the photocatalytic performance of Z-scheme heterojunctions. It is reported that cobalt telluride (CoTe), the narrow-band semiconductor with favorable electrical and magnetic properties, has been extensively applied in solar cells, supercapacitors, and electrode materials for water electrolysis. (28−30) Especially for the unique band structure of CoTe with relatively high conduction band (CB) and valence band (VB) positions, (31,32) it is promising to match with that of PCN for constructing Z-scheme heterojunction.
Herein, CoTe nanorods are used as a structural unit to decorate PCN nanosheets, fabricating a one-dimensional/two-dimensional (1D/2D) Z-scheme heterojunction. The experimental results demonstrate that the in situ N-doping in the surface oxidized layer of CoTe effectively adjusts its chemical structure and element chemical states, which results in the improvement of the overall charge separation efficiency in the 1D/2D CoTe/PCN heterojunction, thus achieving triple CO yield in the photocatalytic CO2R reaction of 4 h relative to that of PCN. The preparation process and possible formation mechanism of the 1D/2D CoTe/PCN heterojunction are depicted in Scheme 1.

3. Results and Discussion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The morphologies of the as-prepared catalysts are investigated using the scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) technique. The SEM images in Figure 1a,b exhibit that PCN displays the typical block of stacking nanosheets while the morphology of CoTe is mainly nanorods accompanied by a small number of nanoparticles. In the SEM image of CoTe/PCN-10 in Figure 1c, some CoTe nanorods are combined with PCN nanosheets, suggesting that the 1D/2D CoTe/PCN heterojunction is fabricated. Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of CoTe/PCN-10 are performed. As shown in Figure 1d,e, CoTe nanorods are firmly loaded on PCN nanosheets to form the 1D/2D CoTe/PCN heterojunction. The partial TEM image in Figure 1f reveals that the nanorods are made up of plenty of nanoparticles, suggesting that the 1D/2D CoTe/PCN heterojunction is fabricated through the self-assembly of CoTe nanoparticles into nanorods on the surface of PCN nanosheets in the solvothermal process. In addition, the clear lattice strips are exhibited in the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of CoTe/PCN-10 (Figure 1g), with a lattice spacing of 0.286 nm, which corresponds to the (101) crystal planes of CoTe. At the same time, the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image illustrated in Figure 1h shows a clear diffraction ring that is identified as the (101) crystal planes of CoTe, indicating that the CoTe nanorod has a polycrystalline structure. Moreover, the high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) image (Figure 1i) and the energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental mapping images (Figure 1j–n) of CoTe/PCN-10 show the characteristic distribution of C, N, O, Co, and Te elements on the surface, proving the fabrication of a 1D/2D CoTe/PCN heterojunction again. What is noteworthy is that oxygen and nitrogen elements are uniformly detected on the surface of CoTe nanorods, suggesting that the molecular/subnanometric oxidized layer is formed on the surface of CoTe nanorods, and nitrogen element is doped in it. The incorporation of a small amount of nitrogen element can not only effectively adjust the chemical structure and electron configuration of the surface oxidized layer to improve the charge transfer ability between CoTe nanorods and PCN nanosheets but also produce defects acting as carrier recombination centers of the photogenerated holes from CoTe and the photogenerated electrons from PCN to improve the separation efficiency of carriers in their respective interior, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic CO2R performance.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) is conducted to identify the crystal structure and phase composition of samples. As shown in Figure 2a, the XRD patterns of PCN have two distinct peaks located at 13.0 and 27.3°, which ascribes to the diffractions of the (100) crystal planes of triazine units and (002) crystal planes stacked between layers, respectively. (33) Additionally, the XRD pattern of CoTe shows obvious five diffraction peaks at 31.3, 43.0, 46.6, 58.3, and 77.7°, corresponding to (101), (102), (110), (103), and (203) crystal planes of the hexagonal crystal system (PDF#34-0420), respectively. Importantly, the XRD pattern of CoTe/PCN-10 also shows some diffraction peaks from CoTe besides PCN, indicating the fabrication of the 1D/2D CoTe/PCN heterojunction. Noticeably, there is no offset of CoTe diffraction peaks in the XRD of CoTe/PCN-10 in contrast with single CoTe, indicating that the nitrogen element is doped in the surface oxidized layer rather than the interior lattice of CoTe.
Figure 2
Figure 2. (a) XRD patterns and (b) FT-IR spectra of samples.
The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra are carried out to investigate the molecular framework structure of samples. As shown in Figure 2b, all of the CoTe/PCN heterojunctions exhibit similar FT-IR spectra to PCN, where the broad peaks appearing in 3000–3400 cm–1 are derived from the stretching vibration of the NHx group; the characteristic absorption peaks appearing in the range of 1150–1750 cm–1 are due to the stretching vibration of the aromatic heterocyclic rings, and the absorption peak at 814 cm–1 is generated by the vibration absorption of the s-triazine rings. (34,35) However, from the locally magnified FT-IR spectra of the samples, the characteristic absorption peak originating from Co–Te bonds appears at 508 cm–1, further suggesting the decoration of CoTe nanorods on the PCN nanosheet surface.
To investigate the adjusting effect of N-doping in the surface oxide layer and the interaction between structural units in the heterojunction, X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) of samples is performed (Figures S2 and S3 and Tables S1–S3). The C 1s XPS of PCN from Figure 3a shows that the binding energy peaks located at 284.8, 287.0, and 288.2 eV are derived from graphitic carbon of C–C/C═C bonds, carbon connected to the NHx group, and sp2-hybridized carbon of N–C═N in the triazine rings, respectively. (36) As shown in Figure 3b, the N 1s XPS of PCN exhibits three characteristic peaks at 401.2, 400.1, and 398.7 eV, which are originated from the sp2-hybrided nitrogen in the terminal NHx group, tertiary nitrogen (N–C3), and triazine ring (C–N═C), respectively. (37) Compared with PCN, the peak originating from carbon connected to the NHx group and nitrogen of terminal NHx in the XPS of CoTe/PCN-10 shifts 0.5 and 0.1 eV to low binding energy, respectively, which indicates that PCN nanosheets may be bonded to the N-doped surface oxidized layer of CoTe nanorods by the NHx group, resulting in strong interface interaction. The negative offset of binding energy peaks demonstrates electrons diffusing from PCN nanosheets to CoTe nanorods via the N-doped surface oxidized layer of CoTe nanorods, owing to the strong interfacial bonding effect in the CoTe/PCN heterojunction. Furthermore, Figure 3c shows Co 2p XPS spectra of CoTe and CoTe/PCN-10. For the former, the peaks at 795.6 and 779.5 eV originate from the Co 2p1/2 and Co 2p3/2 states of cobalt in the surface Co–Te bonds, respectively, while the characteristic peaks at 781.1 eV arise from the surface oxidation of cobalt. (38,39) Compared with CoTe, the Co 2p XPS of CoTe/PCN-10 shows that the peak of cobalt in the oxidized state has a large shift of 0.5 eV to high binding energy, indicating that nitrogen element is introduced into the surface oxidized layer rather than the interior lattice of CoTe, which is in accord with analysis results from TEM and XRD. In addition, the peak corresponding to the Co–Te bond also appears to have a slight 0.1 eV shift to the high binding energy in the Co 2p XPS of CoTe/PCN-10. This is because the N-doping effect in the surface oxidized layer results in the chemical state change of cobalt in the surface lattice of CoTe. The positive offset of this peak further evidences the electron diffusion from PCN nanosheets to CoTe nanorods via the N-doped surface oxidized layer of CoTe nanorods. As a consequence, the electron-directed diffusion leads to induce a built-in electric field from CoTe to PCN, which can effectively drive photogenerated electrons of PCN and photogenerated holes of CoTe, which migrate to their interface and then recombine in the N-doped surface oxidized layer, thereby improving the separation efficiency of the photogenic charge carrier to propel the photocatalytic CO2R reaction. Moreover, for the Te 3d XPS of CoTe in Figure 3d, two peaks at 583.1 and 572.7 eV correspond to Te 3d3/2 and Te 3d5/2 states of tellurium in the surface Co–Te bond, respectively, (40) which are not detected in the Te 3d XPS of CoTe/PCN-10 owing to the low content of CoTe. However, the peaks at 575.8 and 586.2 eV originating from the surface oxidation of tellurium are not changed, (40) suggesting that the chemical state of cobalt rather than tellurium in the N-doped surface oxidized layer is effectively adjusted.

The specific surface area and pore structure also affect the photocatalytic CO2R performance. Figure 4a shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isothermal curves of samples. CoTe exhibits poor adsorption capacity, while PCN and CoTe/PCN-10 exhibit high adsorption property and similar adsorption–desorption behavior. Both PCN and CoTe/PCN-10 have the hysteresis loop in the range of 0.4–1.0, with a typical characteristic of type IV isotherm, indicating that a mesoporous structure exists, (41) which is also proved by the similar pore size distribution of them (Figure 4b). In addition, as summarized in Table S4, a relatively low specific surface area (18.31 m2 g–1) and pore volume (0.10 cm3 g–1) are detected on CoTe. However, we note that the specific surface area of CoTe/PCN-10 is slightly smaller than that of PCN, with values of 66.69 and 72.88 m2 g–1, respectively, and the pore volume of the former (0.41 cm3 g–1) is similar to that of the latter (0.48 cm3 g–1). The above results imply that the enhanced photocatalytic CO2R performance of the 1D/2D CoTe/PCN heterojunction is primarily due to the high-efficiency separation of photogenerated carriers, with little relatedness to specific surface area and pore structure.

To investigate the light absorption and band gap of the as-prepared samples, the UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV–vis DRS) is conducted on them. As shown in Figure 5a, the spectral absorption range of PCN is approximately close to 450 nm, while CoTe has a strong absorption ability over the entire spectral range. Due to the coupling effect of CoTe, the absorption edge of CoTe/PCN-10 undergoes an evident red shift, as well as the light harvest range broadens to the entire visible and near-infrared regions. In addition, the band gap of samples is calculated using the Tauc formula. (42) On the base of the plots of (αhν)1/2 vs hν in Figure 5b, the PCN band gap is reduced from the initial 2.67 to 2.37 eV after incorporating CoTe on the surface. The extended light harvest range and reduced band gap mean that the 1D/2D CoTe/PCN heterojunction has higher solar utilization and is more easily excited than PCN, facilitating the photocatalytic CO2R reaction. Furthermore, the energy band structures of the as-prepared samples are determined by XPS valence band (VB) spectra and electrochemical Mott–Schottky curves. The VB values of PCN, CoTe, and CoTe/PCN-10 in Figure 5c are 1.66, 0.63, and 1.66 eV, respectively. According to the band-gap values of PCN (2.67 eV), CoTe (1.98 eV), (43) and CoTe/PCN-10 (2.37 eV), their corresponding conduction band (CB) values are calculated to be −1.01, −1.35, and −0.71 eV, respectively. Besides, as shown in Figure 5d–f, the Mott–Schottky plots with positive slopes indicate the N-type semiconductor feature of samples. Based on the flat band potentials obtained from the x-intercept in the Mott–Schottky plots, the Fermi levels of PCN, CoTe, and CoTe/PCN-10 are calculated to be −0.72, −0.65, and −0.65 V, respectively.

Figure 6a exhibits the kinetic curves of CO evolution for the photocatalytic CO2R reaction over the as-prepared samples. No CO is produced over the CoTe nanorods, and the PCN nanosheets exhibit relatively low photocatalytic CO2R activity. However, after PCN nanosheets are modified with CoTe nanorods, all of the 1D/2D CoTe/PCN heterojunctions formed display a significantly enhanced photocatalytic CO2R activity relative to PCN. Meanwhile, the photocatalytic CO2R activity shows a tendency to increase and then decrease with increasing CoTe content, which achieves the highest over CoTe/PCN-10. The CO yield over CoTe/PCN-10 reaches 32.84 μmol g–1, which is about three times that over PCN nanosheets (10.94 μmol g–1) within 4 h. In order to ascertain that CO originates from CO2 in the photocatalytic reaction, the control experiments are performed under different conditions. As shown in Figure 6b, CO is not detected in some control experiments, indicating that the CO produced stems from the CO2 in the photocatalytic reaction. In addition, the cyclic experiments of the photocatalytic CO2R reaction are further executed on CoTe/PCN-10. As the cyclic kinetic curves of CO evolution depicted in Figure 6c, the photocatalytic CO2R performance of CoTe/PCN-10 has no significant decrease after undergoing four cyclic runnings. Meanwhile, Figure 6d shows almost exactly the same XRD diffraction patterns for CoTe/PCN-10 before and after the cyclic reaction. The above results indicate that the fabricated 1D/2D CoTe/PCN heterojunction has superior stability and reusability.

The separation and transfer ability of photogenic carriers is one of the dominating factors that determine the photocatalytic performance, which is investigated by electrochemical and photoelectrochemical techniques. As exhibited in Figure 7a, the photocurrent response intensity of CoTe/PCN-10 is obviously higher than that of PCN and CoTe, indicating that the modification of CoTe significantly improves the separation efficiency and transfer rate of photogenerated carriers. (44,45) Figure 7b shows the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of samples, in which the Nyquist curve radius of CoTe/PCN-10 is distantly smaller than that of PCN and CoTe, indicating that it has faster charge-transfer rate and lower interfacial charge-transfer resistance. (46) In addition, the equivalent circuit fitted from the Nyquist curves (inset of Figure 7b) indicates that the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of CoTe/PCN-10 (227 Ω) is obviously lower than that of PCN (940 Ω) and CoTe (322 Ω), suggesting a significant increase of charge-transfer rate in the CoTe/PCN heterojunction. (47) The linear sweep voltammogram (LSV) curves of samples are shown in Figure 7c; the CoTe exhibits extremely low overpotential in the CO2 atmosphere at the same current density, which may be due to its outstanding conductivity. However, the overpotential of CoTe/PCN-10 is smaller than that of PCN at the same current density, indicating that the fabricated heterojunction can effectively promote charge transfer and accelerate surface reaction kinetics to enhance the photocatalytic activity. (48) In addition, the overpotential of CoTe/PCN-10 in the CO2 atmosphere is significantly lower than that in the Ar atmosphere at the same current density, indicating that CO2 is more likely to be reduced rather than H+ ions during the photocatalytic process. (49) The cyclic voltammetric (CV) curves (Figure S3) are also tested at different scanning rates to investigate the double layer capacitance (Cdl) and electrochemical active area (ESCA). The capacitive current of CoTe/PCN-10 is significantly higher than that of PCN and CoTe, indicating that the former has a greater capacity to hold charge. (50) Moreover, the Cdl values are obtained by fitting the CV curves of samples at different scanning rates. As displayed in Figure 7d, CoTe/PCN-10 has a relatively large Cdl value of 0.253 mF cm–2, which is higher than PCN (0.238 mF cm–2) and CoTe (0.203 mF cm–2), suggesting that it has larger ESCA to provide more effective active sites, thus promoting CO2R reaction. (51)

The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the as-prepared photocatalysts are also carried out and used to investigate the separation ability of photogenic carriers because it is primarily caused by the recombination of holes on the VB and electrons on the CB in the semiconductor. As presented in Figure 8a, PCN shows a strong emission peak between 425 and 475 nm, stemming from the recombination of photogenerated carriers. Compared with PCN, the PL spectrum of CoTe/PCN-10 displays the same emission peak with a half-magnitude decrease of intensity. The unshifted peak position and such a distinct quenching phenomenon suggest that the PL emission of CoTe/PCN-10 is originated from PCN and the energy-wasteful charge recombination is remarkably inhibited in PCN. (52,53) This is further verified by the time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) decay property of samples. Based on the TR-PL decay curves in Figure 8b, the average PL lifetime (τ) using dual-exponential fitting is shortened from 13.83 ns in PCN to 7.04 ns in CoTe/PCN-10 (Table S5). The remarkably reduced PL lifetime should be attributed to the creation of a new nonradiative transition channel due to the trapping of photogenerated electrons produced in PCN by the N-doped surface oxidized layer of CoTe nanorods. (53) These results indicate that the transfer and separation efficiency of photogenic carriers are significantly improved through fabricating 1D/2D CoTe/PCN heterojunctions, thus facilitating the photocatalytic CO2R performance.
Figure 8

To determine the possible CO2R reaction pathway, the in situ FT-IR spectra are performed over CoTe/PCN-10 to detect some key intermediates. As shown in Figure 9a, a series of strong downward absorption peaks appear between 3200 and 3800 cm–1, stemming from hydroxyl groups (·OH) and H2O molecules, (54,55) in which the gradually increasing absorption intensity with prolonging illumination time indicates that they are continuously consumed to participate in the photocatalytic CO2R reaction. In the meantime, the multiple characteristic absorption peaks of intermediate products are also detected in the photocatalytic CO2R reaction. As shown in Figure 9b, the absorption peaks of monodentate carbonate (m-CO32–), bicarbonate (HCO3–), and polydentate carbonate (b-CO32–) appear at 1498, 1463, and 1334 cm–1, respectively, which are hydrolyzed products of CO2 adsorbed on the surface of the sample. Importantly, three main intermediates are also detected at 1690, 1559, and 1948 cm–1, which are derived from absorption peaks of activated CO2*, COOH*, and CO*. (56,57) As a consequence, the photocatalytic CO2R reaction pathway over the 1D/2D CoTe/PCN heterojunction is CO2 → CO2* → COOH* → CO* → CO.

Furthermore, it is proposed for the possible charge transfer and separation behavior and photocatalytic CO2R mechanism over the 1D/2D CoTe/PCN heterojunction. According to the analyzing energy band structure, it is more reasonable to follow the Z-scheme than type-II mechanism for the transfer and separation behavior of photogenic charge carriers because the VB position of CoTe is located above the oxidation potential of H2O (1.23 V vs NHE). As exhibited in Figure 10, when the 1D/2D CoTe/PCN heterojunction is under intense light irradiation, electrons on the VB of CoTe and PCN all are excited to their CB to induce photogenerated electron–hole pairs, respectively. In quick succession, the photogenerated electrons from PCN and the photogenerated holes from CoTe migrate to the interface driven by the built-in electric field and then are captured and recombined in the N-doped surface oxidized layer of CoTe nanorods. Lastly, the CO2 molecules reduced by photogenerated electrons remained on CoTe nanorods to release CO, and the corresponding photogenerated holes on PCN are continually consumed by H2O molecules.

4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In summary, we fabricate a unique 1D/2D CoTe/PCN Z-scheme heterojunction in which CoTe nanorods are firmly modified on the surface of PCN nanosheets. The modification of PCN with CoTe not only significantly extends the spectral response range and reduces the band gap but also improves the interface charge transfer and separation efficiency due to the adjusting effect of in situ N-doping in the surface oxidized layer of CoTe. The photocatalytic experiments show that the CO2R performances of the 1D/2D CoTe/PCN heterojunctions all are higher than that of PCN. The optimal CO yield over CoTe/PCN-10 is 32.84 μmol g–1, which reaches up to three times that of PCN (10.94 μmol g–1) within 4 h. Meanwhile, after four cyclic experiments, the photocatalytic activity of CoTe/PCN-10 has no significant decrease, indicating that the 1D/2D CoTe/PCN heterojunction has superior stability and reusability. This work may provide a representative exemplification to further improve the charge separation efficiency of Z-scheme heterojunctions to achieve high-efficiency photocatalytic performance.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
