 Unfortunately the provided documents do not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation research. The documents focus on isobutane dehydrogenation using manganese-based catalysts and do not mention propane dehydrogenation specifically. Since there are no relevant extracts, I cannot provide a summarized XML output. The unified response is:
