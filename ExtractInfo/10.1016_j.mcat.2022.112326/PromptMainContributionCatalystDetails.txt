Synergistic effect of low valence manganese ions in manganese-based catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane
Abstract
A series of manganese-based catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 with low loading amount of manganese from 0.5% to 2.0% were prepared by incipient impregnating method. All catalysts were tested on non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane at 600 °C. In order to explore physicochemical properties of all catalysts, various characterizations including XRD, H2-TPR, XPS, UV-vis, NH3-TPD and TG were carried out on manganese-based catalysts. The experimental results indicated that MnOx species were highly dispersed on γ-Al2O3 support, and both Mn2+ and Mn3+ ions are main active species for isobutane dehydrogenation. The reduced catalyst 1.5%Mn/γ-Al2O3 exhibited the most optimal dehydrogenation performance among all catalysts, reaching at isobutane conversion of 36% and isobutene selectivity of 79%. The main reasons for the excellent activity and selectivity of 1.5%Mn/γ-Al2O3 were related to the high proportion of low valence manganese ions including Mn2+ and Mn3+ as well as the high concentration of medium strong acid sites and weak strong acid strength.

1. Introduction
Isobutene, which is widely applied to synthesizing high value-added products including methyl methacrylate, polyisobutylene, butyl rubber and so on [1], is crucial raw material in fine chemical industry [2]. In recent years, the growing demand of isobutene has propelled people to find ways to increase production because of the development of chemical industry [3]. Preparation of isobutene by traditional process including naphtha steam cracking and petroleum catalytic cracking has two shortages: low content and more by-products [4]. In order to satisfy the increasing demand of isobutene, the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene has attracted more and more attention because of its simple operation and high concentration of isobutene [5]. Pt-based and Cr-based catalysts were most widely used in the reaction of light alkanes dehydrogenation [6], [7], [8]. Although Cr-based catalysts have showed good performance for alkanes dehydrogenation, their toxicity and pollution to environment which are not avoided have great restriction on further application and popularization of Cr-based catalysts. Pt-based catalysts have attracted much attention because of its excellent catalytic performance. Because Pt is a kind of noble metal, the cost of Pt-based catalysts is very high [9,10]. In addition, the Pt-based catalysts have serious problems of carbon deposition and Pt sintering in the high temperature treatment and reaction process, which lead to rapid deactivation and poor stability of the catalysts in the reaction process [11]. Therefore, a large number of scientists have focused their work on non-noble metal catalysts for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes [12], [13], [14], [15]. In the non-oxidative dehydrogenation process, the low-valence metal oxides, such as Mo4+ in MoOx [12], Co2+ in CoOx [13] and V4+ in VOx [14] are usually regarded as the active species. The catalytic behavior of non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over different crystalline Al2O3 supported VOx catalysts indicated that the crystal structure of Al2O3 can affect the dehydrogenation performance by changing the surface acidity and interaction between active species and Al2O3 [16]. The non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation over ZrOx exhibited high propane conversion of 25% and excellent propene selectivity of 98% [17]. And the oxygen vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated Zrcus4+ sites in ZrOx were considered as the active sites. The catalyst Zn/Al2O3 with 10% Zn loading was tested over non-oxidative isobutane dehydrogenation with isobutane conversion of 45% and isobutene selectivity of 86% [18]. The Zn species could be highly dispersed on the surface of Al2O3 with well-ordered mesopore. At the same time, the introduction of Zn species changed the acidity of the catalyst, and the decrease of strong acid sites promoted the selectivity of isobutene. In addition, we also studied the role and mechanism of Co, Mo-based non-noble metal catalysts in non-oxidative dehydrogenation [19,20]. All results regarded the low valence Co2+ in CoOx and Mo4+ in MoOx as the main active sites in the dehydrogenation of low-carbon alkanes, because the catalytic performance can be enhanced after reduction treatment.
However, there are few applications about the non-noble Mn-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. The existing reports mostly focused on oxidative dehydrogenation [21], [22], [23]. And the dehydrogenation mechanism of Mn-based catalysts and the chemical state of active species are still not clear. Therefore, it is necessary to be further studied.
In this work, γ-Al2O3 supported Mn-based catalysts with Mn loading from 0.5% to 2% were used to catalyze the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane reaction. According to a series of characterization, the impact of Mnn+ ions with different value on catalytic activity and selectivity of isobutane dehydrogenation reaction was studied.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
2.1.1. Materials
The materials of synthesizing catalysts include Mn(NO3)2 solution (AR, 50 wt.% in H2O) and γ-Al2O3 purchased from Aladdin Industrial corporation.
2.1.2. Preparation of catalysts
A series of Mn-based catalysts with different Mn content were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of γ-Al2O3 with different concentration of Mn(NO3)2 solution for 12 h. Then the solids were dried at 120 °C for 12 h. After that, these solids were ground into powder and calcined in air at 700°C for 12 h. The obtained γ-Al2O3 supported Mn-based catalysts are denoted as xMn-AlO (x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0), where x represents the mass fraction of Mn species. Before reaction, the catalysts were reduced in 5% H2/N2 (30 mL min−1) at 600 °C for 2 h at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1.
2.2. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests were carried out on D-Foucas (Bruker) which equipped with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm). The spectral scanning angle and scanning speed were 10–90° and 8°/min respectively.
The temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was carried out to analyze the reduction capacity of catalysts by automatic multi-purpose adsorption apparatus (tp 5080 XQINSTRUMENT CO., LTD China). Prior to H2-TPR test, the fresh samples (30 mg) were placed into quartz tube, after the baseline was stabilized for 30 min, the reactor was heated from room temperature to 900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, the concentration variation of H2 was recorded with a TCD.
The coke deposition of spent catalysts was analyzed by Thermogravimetric (TG). The instrument is HITACHI STA7300 thermogravimetric analyzer. When the samples were analyzing, the temperature rose from room temperature to 900 °C and the heating rate was 10 °C/min.
The X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out on catalysts to get the information of the chemical composition and chemical states of the elements which are located on the surface of reduced catalysts. The measurement apparatus is Thermo ESCALAB 250Xi (US) using Al Kα radiation. In addition, the C 1s level with a binding energy of 284.8 eV was used as an internal reference.
The Ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis) spectroscopy was obtained in the range of 200–800 nm on Shimadzu UV-3600 spectrophotometer with BaSO4 as reference.
N2 adsorption-desorption conducted on automatic analyzer (QUA211007, Quantachrome, USA) were used to explore the textural properties of catalysts. Before the characterization, all samples were degassed under vacuum at 300°C for 4 h.
2.3. Catalytic performance test
The catalytic performance test was carried out in the stainless-steel fixed-bed reactor with inner diameter of 8 mm. After fixing the reduced catalyst in the reactor, the mixed gas (C4H10: H2 molar ration = 1: 1, WHSV = 3 h−1) was introduced into the reactor. The non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane was performed at 600 °C. The gas compositions were analyzed by gas chromatography with a FID detector. The conversion of isobutane, selectivity and yield of isobutene were calculated by following formulas based on the total number carbon atom balance:
In the above formula, C4H10 in stands for the isobutane content in the feed, C4H10 out and C4H8 out stands for the isobutane and isobutene content respectively in the exit gases.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic performance
Generally, the low-valence metal ions can improve the reaction activity or selectivity by increasing the adsorption of alkanes or the desorption of olefins in the dehydrogenation process [24]. On the other hand, the metal oxide catalysts also should undergo a reduction pretreatment in order to stabilize the chemical state and avoid the influence of reaction atmosphere on the metal oxides. In order to confirm difference, it is necessary to compare the dehydrogenation performance between the unreduced and reduced catalyst.
Firstly, it can be found that the isobutane conversion and isobutene selectivity of the unreduced 1.5Mn-AlO are significantly lower than that of the reduced one during the reaction of 6 h. Especially, the isobutene selectivity of unreduced 1.5Mn-AlO is not as stable as that of the reduced one. Even it presents an increasing trend with the reaction time and reaches the maximum value which is equivalent to that of reduced 1.5Mn-AlO and then drops slightly. This unstable phenomenon hints that the reduction feed gas could change the phase structure of the unreduced 1.5Mn-AlO. The most possible reasons should be related to the continuous formation of low valence Mn species (Mn3+ and Mn2+ ions) and further sintering of MnOx microcrystals during the reaction period. In particular, the isobutane conversion of unreduced 1.5Mn-AlO decreases nearly 18% compared with the reduced 1.5Mn-AlO.
The obvious difference for the non-oxidative isobutane dehydrogenation between the Mn-based catalyst with or without reduction pretreatment, reflects significant influence of reduction on the dehydrogenation properties. It seems to be possible that the reduced 1.5Mn-AlO catalyst contains more low valence Mn ions. Therefore, in the next work, the research focuses on the reduced catalysts xMn-AlO (x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0) with different Mn content.
As shown in Fig. 1(a), it can be found that the isobutane conversion-time curves of the reduced catalysts with different Mn content have an obvious shift up from 0.5Mn-AlO to 1.0Mn-AlO and to 1.5Mn-AlO, and then fall down for 2.0Mn-AlO which is nearly back to the level of 0.5Mn-AlO. The isobutane conversion of 1.5Mn-AlO can be kept at more than 36% during reaction of 6 h, which has a maximum isobutane conversion of 38%. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the isobutene yields of all reduced catalysts display a similar trend. The curves of isobutene selectivity show a slight increase with the increase of Mn content. The isobutene selectivity of all catalysts is no less than 76%, and 2.0Mn-AlO obtains the maxima of 81%. As for 1.5Mn-AlO, the isobutene selectivity nearly approaches a constant high value at 79%. During the dehydrogenation reaction, the by-products, such as CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C3H8 and C3H6, also can be monitored. Except C3H6, the selectivity of other by-products obtains a constant low value (less than 8%) for the reduced catalysts, therefore these variations can be negligible. However, the C3H6 selectivity exhibits an opposite trend with the increase of Mn content as compared with that of isobutene. As a result, the total selectivity of the light alkenes is independent of the Mn content.

Anyhow, it is noteworthy that the reduced 1.5Mn-AlO shows the most excellent catalytic activity in this work. It is necessary to compare the reduced 1.5Mn-AlO with some non-noble metal-based catalysts for isobutane dehydrogenation. The following Table 1 lists the dehydrogenation performance of some non-noble metal-based catalysts under the similar conditions. The reduced 1.5Mn-AlO in this work exhibits the similar catalytic performance with others. Therefore, it is valuable to investigate the structure-performance relationship of the reduced xMn-AlO (x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0) catalysts in the isobutane dehydrogenation. The further details would be discussed below in combination with the relevant characterizations.

3.2. Structure and texture of catalysts
3.2.1. XRD
In order to understand what structures features of γ-Al2O3 supported Mn-based catalysts are responsible for these different activities, some characterizations are carried out. Firstly, the XRD patterns of the calcined and reduced catalysts with different Mn content are shown in Fig. 2. According to Fig. 2(a), all calcined catalysts display diffraction peaks at 2θ = 31.9° (220), 37.0° (311), 39.5° (222), 47.4° (400), 61.0° (511) and 67.0° (440), which can be attributed to single γ-Al2O3 phase (JCPDF file No. 10-0425). However, there are no any diffraction peaks of MnOx such as MnO2 and Mn3O4 in the XRD patterns. It is often interpreted as the small size and/or low concentration of MnOx nanoparticles below the XRD detection limit. Another reason should be related to the amorphous state of MnOx [28]. In any case, it can be determined that the MnOx nanoparticles are highly dispersed on the surface of γ-Al2O3 and even to form a monolayer dispersion considering that the Mn content is less than 8.1% as reported in literature [29]. For the reduced catalysts, all diffraction peaks are the same with the calcined ones. This indicates that the MnOx nanoparticles are stable enough and the corresponding reduced states also can be highly dispersed on the support.

3.2.2. N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms
In order to explain the textural properties of all catalysts, the low-temperature N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms and pore size distribution (PSD) curves of the calcined catalysts are displayed in Fig 3. And the textural properties including specific surface area (SBET), total pore volumes (VP) and the most probable pore size (DP) are shown in Table 2. All xMn-AlO (x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0) catalysts possess the IV isotherms and H2-type hysteresis loops, which are attributed to the slit-shaped mesoporous feature. These pore characteristics also have been proved by the PSD curves and the textural data in Table 2. Furthermore, the small difference of SBET, VP and DP values indicates that the textural properties of these catalysts have not been influenced by the loading amount of Mn. This also hints that MnOx formed a monolayer coverage on γ-Al2O3 support.

3.2.3. H2-TPR
The reducibility of the MnOx supported on γ-Al2O3 with different Mn content is determined by H2-TPR. Generally, the reduction process of MnOx consists of the following three stages: MnO2→Mn2O3→Mn3O4→MnO [30], [31], [32]. According to thermodynamic principle, MnO would not be further reduced in our experiment condition [32,33]. As shown in Fig. 4, all catalysts xMn-AlO (x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0) present a weak α peak at the lower temperature and a long-span peak at the higher temperature. And the low temperature α peak should belong to the reduction of MnO2 to Mn2O3. The broad peak can be fitted into β peak at middle temperature and γ peak at high temperature, corresponding to the reduction processes of Mn2O3 to Mn3O4 [33] and Mn3O4 to MnO [30,34], respectively. And the corresponding H2 consumptions at three stages are collected in Table 3. It can be found, the α peak temperature decreases gradually with the increase of Mn content from 0.5% to 1.5%, and then slightly rises again as the Mn content reaches 2.0%. It can be deduced that the reducibility from MnO2 to Mn2O3 follows an opposite order with the increase of Mn content. The similar trend could be seen for β and γ peak of 0.5Mn-AlO, 1.0Mn-AlO and 2.0Mn-AlO, besides a sharply rising temperature of 1.5Mn-AlO. It indicates that the interaction between low valence Mn species (Mn3+ and Mn2+ ion) and support can be effectively strengthened by introducing appropriate Mn content into catalyst. This reveals that the reduction of high valence Mn4+ ion in 1.5Mn-AlO is easier and the low valence Mn species in the reduced one are more stable than that of other catalysts. As one reason, it can be used to explain the stable dehydrogenation behavior for the reduced 1.5Mn-AlO catalyst.

H2 consumption calculated from H2-TPR result using CuO as the reference material.
According to the similar H2 consumption of all α peaks in Table 3, the only thing that can be determined is that there is no difference for the amount of the reducible MnO2 in these catalysts. However, the total H2 consumption, especially for the second reduction stage from Mn2O3 to Mn3O4 shows a rapidly increasing trend from 0.5Mn-AlO to 1.0Mn-AlO and to 1.5Mn-AlO, and then falls to the bottom of 2.0Mn-AlO, which is consistent with the variation of corresponding isobutane conversion vs. Mn content. It suggests that the low valence Mn species must play an important role in activating the dehydrogenation reaction. In the last reduction process from Mn3O4 to MnO, an opposite change, namely the lowest H2 consumption, can be obtained for 1.5Mn-AlO. These mean there are not only more low valence Mn ions (Mn3+ and Mn2+) in the reduced 1.5Mn-AlO samples than others, but also more Mn3O4 can be formed and maintained during the reduction treatment.
3.2.4. XPS
The XPS surface analysis was used to investigate the chemical composition and surface states of O and Mn species on the surface of γ-Al2O3 supported Mn-based catalysts.
As shown in Fig. 5(a), the O 1s spectra for all reduced Mn-based catalysts only present an intense peak at binding energy (BE) of ca. 531.5 eV. This should be attributed to the surface oxygen species, such as hydroxyl groups [35]. It is worth noting that the characteristic peak of lattice oxygen located at low BE of around 530.0 eV cannot be deconvoluted from the main peak. The absence of lattice oxygen also means there are large amounts of hydroxyl groups covered on the surface of catalysts [36]. This should be related to the formation of a large number of coordinatively unsaturated Mn species, which is likely originated from the reduction pretreatment [37, 38].

Fig. 5. XPS profiles of (a) O1s and (b) Mn 2p regions in the reduced xMn-AlO catalysts (x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0).
The Mn 2p3/2 core level spectra for all reduced xMn-AlO (x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0) samples are displayed in Fig. 5(b). In each case, there is a main [30, 39, 40] peak at BE of ca. 642 eV together with a satellite peak at BE of ca. 647 eV respectively. The appearance of satellite peak in the Mn 2p3/2 region further proves the existence of Mn2+ species in the reduced catalysts. In addition, the main Mn 2p3/2 peak could be deconvolved into three peaks at around 640.4 eV, 641.7 eV and 643.5 eV, corresponding with the BE position for Mn2+, Mn3+ and Mn4+ species [41], [42], [43], which also identified by the UV-vis spectra in Fig. S1 of Supplementary Materials. The XPS characteristic data of Mn 2p3/2 region and the ratios of different Mn chemical states for the reduced catalysts are listed in Table 4. Obviously, the BE values of Mn4+ and Mn3+ ions give a falling trend with increasing Mn content, while a reverse change can be found for that of Mn2+ ion from the reduced 1.0Mn-AlO to 2.0Mn-AlO. This means that there is an increasing electron density for Mn4+ and Mn3+ ions, accompanied by a decrease in the electron density of Mn2+ ion. It is supposed that the electron transfer can be strengthened in the reduced 1.5Mn-AlO. As a result, the interaction between low valence Mn species (Mn3+ and Mn2+ ion) and support also can be enhanced in it. At the same time, the maximum percentage of surface low valence Mn2+ and Mn3+ ions appear on the reduced 1.5Mn-AlO sample, which is agreement with the results of H2-TPR. It is worth noting that the variation of low valence Mn species along with the increase of Mn content is same with that of isobutane conversion. It can be deduced that the low valence Mn2+ and Mn3+ ions should be the main active species. And it means that the isobutane is firstly adsorbed and activated on the low valence Mn active sites in the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction. As discussed in the Cr-based dehydrogenation catalysts [15], the similar phenomena can be attributed that the formation of coordinatively unsaturated Mn2+ and Mn3+ ions.

NH3-TPD technique was used to explore the acidity of the reduced xMn-AlO (x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0) catalysts as displayed in Fig. 6. For all xMn-AlO catalysts, the NH3-TPD profiles could be fitted into four peaks. The first peak (Peak I) at low temperature is attributed to the desorption of weakly adsorbed hydroxyl groups. The other three peaks (Peak II, Peak III and Peak IV) belong to weak acid, middle acid and strong acid sites, respectively [44], [45], [46], [47]. The corresponding temperature of the peak maximum (Tmax) and the peak area fraction are summarized in Table 5.

For the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction, the surface acidity also has an influence on the catalytic activity and selectivity. Generally, the medium acid sites can promote isobutane dehydrogenation, while the strong acid sites can activate the side reactions, involving polymerization, isomerization and cracking [48,49]. Among these catalysts, there is no obvious difference for their temperatures and peak area fractions of Peak I. Therefore, the influence of weakly adsorbed hydroxyl groups on catalytic performance is not discussed here. As for the total peak area fraction of Peak Ⅱ and Peak III, on behalf of the total amount of weak and middle acid sites, is well in line with the change trend of reaction activity along with the Mn content. This suggests that the increase of the total amount of weak and middle acid sites is exactly conducive to the main reaction of isobutane dehydrogenation in some extent. On the other hand, it can be found that the temperature of Peak IV gradually decreases with the increase of Mn content. That is to say, the more Mn content, the weaker the strong acid sites are, together with the higher isobutene selectivity. It can be deduced that the isobutane dehydrogenation can be improved by increasing the total amount of weak and middle acid sites and weakening the strength of strong acid sites in some extent.
3.2.6. TG-DTG analysis
As we all known that the surface acidity of catalysts must affect the side reactions. As one of by-products, the characteristics of deposited carbon play an important role on the stability and regeneration ability of catalysts. In view of this, the TG-DTG experiments were carried out to explore the situation of the carbon deposition on the used catalysts. The TG-DTG profiles of the used catalysts are drawn in Fig.7 and the analyzed results to predict the carbon species characteristic are listed in Table 6.

Obviously, two distinct peaks can be found in the DTG curves. It means that the mass loss processes of the used catalysts can be divided into two stages. The first stage in the low temperature range of ambient temperature to 300°C should be related to the removal of weakly adsorbed steam and hydrocarbons from the reaction system [50], which is consistent with the fist peak of NH3-TPD. This process has no obvious influence on the DTG peak temperature. However, the mass loss percentages of 1.0Mn-AlO, 1.5Mn-AlO, 2.0Mn-AlO sample at this stage are similar and more than twice that of 0.5Mn-AlO sample.
For the second stage above 300°C, the mass loss is mainly assigned to the combustion of deposited coke on the surface of catalysts. It can be calculated out that the deposited coke amount has a strongly increase from 6.8% of the used 0.5Mn-AlO sample to 12.6% of the used 1.0Mn-AlO and 1.5Mn-AlO sample, and then decrease to 10.5% of the used 2.0Mn-AlO sample. The change trend of carbon deposition is the same as that of the proportion of strong acid sites on the catalyst. And the similar change also can be found for the coke combustion temperature of these catalysts.
4. Conclusion
A series of γ-Al2O3 supported Mn-based xMn-AlO (x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0) were tested on non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane. It is found that the reduction of the catalyst before the reaction will improve the activity and stability of the catalyst. The reduced 1.5Mn-AlO has the most excellent catalytic performance among all catalysts. High concentration of medium strong acid sites is conducive to improve the isobutene selectivity of the catalyst. In addition, ascendant catalytic ability of xMn-AlO (x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0) could be attributed to low valence including Mn2+ and Mn3+ ions. Therefore, Mn-based catalysts have great application prospects in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of isobutane to isobutene
