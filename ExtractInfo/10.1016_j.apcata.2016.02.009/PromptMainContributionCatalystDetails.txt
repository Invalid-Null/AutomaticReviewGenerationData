1. Introduction
Light alkenes (olefins), which are among the most important intermediate products in chemical industry, are currently commonly obtained by steam cracking (SC) [1] and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) [2] of light oil fractions. For example, most propylene is produced as co-product in steam crackers (> 55%) and as by-product in FCC units (∼35%), while only small fraction (< 10%) is produced by alternative technologies, such as propane dehydrogenation [3]. As both SC and FCC require high temperatures, coking and side reactions are among major drawbacks [4], [5]. Catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) of light alkanes suffers from several common limitations: (i) Thermodynamic restrictions on conversion, which imply high temperatures to obtain reasonable conversions [6]; (ii) Strong endothermicity, which requires heat supply. (iii) Side reactions like thermal cracking, isomerization, which become important at high residence times [7], [8]; (iv) Coke formation due to the high temperatures, which is still extremely fast (less than several hours in industrial applications [6], [9] and about 1 h under conditions expected in membrane reactors [10], [11]). As a result, catalytic reactors have to be regenerated often, to burn off the deposited carbon.
Successful implementation of membrane reactors has a potential of replacing the currently used periodically-regenerated fixed bed reactors. Continuous removal of hydrogen by membrane separation should increase the DH conversion for a given temperature and this in turn will allow to operate at lower temperatures, therefore reducing the coke formation and side reactions. On the other hand, using H2 selective membrane may results in extremely low H2 partial pressures in the reaction mixture, leading to even larger deactivation rates. Therefore, introduction of H2 separation membranes into DH process should be supported by a detailed analysis and process optimization. That in turn requires a detailed model of reaction kinetics.
The purpose of this article is to present a detailed experimental program and a model of PDH activity, selectivity and stability on supported Pt catalysts, mainly for a design of membrane reactor for PDH. Results are compared with published PDH studies on similar Pt-based catalysts. PDH membrane reactors are characterized by several features: (i) Hydrogen removal from the process stream allows for operating at lower temperatures than those of regular catalytic reactors. (ii) In order to mitigate deactivation by coking we study the process at low temperatures, at relatively low pressures with some steam and all these effects should be studied. (iii) Membrane reactors should benefit from operating at higher pressure, since the separation driving force is larger and with hydrogen separation high pressure does not inhibit equilibrium; higher pressures, however, accelerates deactivation. (iv) Selectivity is poorer in a membrane reactor since the required contact times are larger.
The rate expression of the main reaction
(1)
is expressed by a driving force for the reaction, that is the distance from equilibrium, and an inhibition due to competitive adsorption. Literature studies differ in the identity of the adsorbed of species that inhibit the catalytic active sites [12], [13], [14]. (Table 2, Section 3.1). Propylene and hydrogen are often included as inhibitors. Propylene is an obvious inhibitor, and it also acts the precursor for coking.The main reaction is accompanied by cracking to methane and ethylene with possible hydrogenation of the latter.
(2)
Cracking kinetics was modeled on several works, some presented in Table 3, Section 3.2. As the gas-phase CC bond is weaker then CH bond (about 246 kJ/molmol−1 compared to about 363 kJ/molmol−1) dehydrogenation cannot be performed thermally due strong thermal cracking. With an appropriate catalyst, such as platinum and chromia, this can be overcome and good selectivity can be achieved. Note that the catalytic cracking has a higher activation energy than the main reaction implying that selectivity will diminish with higher temperatures. Note also that although the rate constant of cracking at working conditions is 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that of main reaction, the main reaction is limited by equilibrium and at high residence times, as is the situation in an integrated membrane reactor, the selectivity to cracking becomes significant. All cited works agreed on cracking being first order w.r.t. propane.

Some of the ethylene produced can be hydrogenated
(3)
Most PDH models do not include ethylene hydrogenation kinetics as its effect is expected to be negligible. The reason for this is that the ethylene reactant for this reaction is produced only by cracking which, being an undesired side reaction by itself, is mitigated by catalytic formulation and reactor operation conditions. The relatively higher activation energy can also be a factor. A kinetic expression was suggested [12].
Steam will be used in the catalytic PDH process both as a diluent as well as a coke regenerator, being able to gasify coke into CO without significantly effecting the overall reaction and design [15].The suppressive effect of steam on coke formation over Pt catalysts was reported in several works [16]. However, adding steam to the PDH process may lead to steam reforming (SR) of propane and propylene
(4)
along with water-gas shift of the products,
⥂
Propane steam reforming was reported to occur on several metals used for industrial hydrogen production such as platinum, rhodium, ruthenium, and more [17], [18]. The reaction mechanism is likely to involve both the active metal sites, which provide the hydrocarbon dissociative chemisorption, and the support (usually Al2O3 or CeO2), which provides sites for water activation into hydroxyl groups. Even though the support used in the catalysts studied here is aluminum-containing MgO, or Mg(Al)O, which is a novel material and as such is not yet tested in this aspect, the presence of both Pt as the active metal and Mg/Al oxide as the support was suspected to enable steam reforming.
Rate expressions of C3H8/C3H6 steam reforming seem to be scarce in the literature, and none were found to include distinction between steam reforming of propane to that of propylene and of the effect of side reactions of steam reforming such as water-gas shift and additional SR of side products such as methane. An example for SR kinetics which distinguish between CO and CO2 products of SR was suggested by Barghi et al. [16].
The kinetics of propane dehydrogenation and cracking over PtSn catalyst was a topic for first principle calculations [19]. Increasing Sn content in the catalyst leads to weaker bonding of propyl and propylene to the catalyst; it lowers also the energy barrier for propylene desorption, from −0.97 eV on Pt(111) to −0.50 on Pt3Sn (hence improving selectivity) and simultaneously increases the barrier for propylene dehydrogenation. This also leads to lower coking rates. The energy barrier for CC bond cleavage was predicted to vary from 1.6 eV for Pt(1 1 1) to 2.02 for Pt3Sn. The reaction involves two steps, propane to propyl and propyl to propene, having similar activation energies on Pt(1 1 1) (−0.70 eV), implying that the latter is rate determining step. Adsorption energies of propane were predicted to be weak, in the rage −0.02 to −0.08 eV (∼−2 to −8 kJ/molmol−1e), while those of propene were predicted to be −0.42 to −0.61 on Pt3Sn or Pt2Sn compared with −0.99 on Pt(1 1 1).
1.1. Catalyst deactivation
Catalyst deactivation tends to be very fast on the industrial catalytic PDH process, requiring very frequent regeneration cycles, usually in a cycle of several hours [20], [21]. High operation temperatures increases the rate of the cracking side reaction, which lead to lower selectivity toward propylene and to catalyst deactivation due to fast coke formation on the catalyst surface. Sintering, is naturally also encouraged. Regeneration is usually performed by oxidation in air. The need for regeneration cycles leads to higher process complexity and operation costs.
Pt catalysts, which are commonly used for PDH process, are well known to undergo rapid deactivation [22]. Addition of promoters such as Sn and K, which selectively weaken the Pt-propylene interaction without affecting Pt-propane interaction, thus lowering selectivity to coking, inhibit the coking rate. Two kinds of coke were identified in an experimental TPO study of coke formation on Pt-Sn/Al2O3 during propane hydrogenation [23], and were attributed to coke on the metal and coke on the support. The former, which is relevant to this study, is weakly dependent on propene and hydrogen pressure but increasing with propane pressure. The rate was found to be best described by the dimerization of propylene. The authors report that coking on Pt/MgO catalyst, which is free of acid sites, appeared at lower temperatures than that on alumina.
Catalyst deactivation has been described by several kinetic models, from a simple linear decline of activity with time (Li et al. [14]) to a multi-step dimerization and polymerization of propylene (van Sint Annaland et al. [17]). Akporiaye et al. [13] have developed a catalyst which contains Pt prompted with Sn supported on a calcined hydrotalcite-like carrier material. The support is composed of Mg(Al)O, a double hydroxide structure which exhibits a crystal structure similar to that of hydrotalcite. Tests performed on several compositions of the Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst showed it experiences much slower deactivation rate in comparison with Pt/Al2O3 catalysts commonly used for PDH. It was also found that extraordinarily, certain Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O configurations do not exhibit relative deactivation from cycle to cycle following the first cycles of regeneration. The combination of low deactivation per cycle and potentially stable activity from cycle to cycle make the Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst a very promising research choice, which we have chosen to explore in this work. In particular, the effect of catalyst dimension on system performances was investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts table
All experiments were performed using Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalysts, as described by Akporiaye et al. [13], manufactured separately by SINTEF and Johnson Matthey (JM) (Table 1). SINTEF provided a catalyst consisting of 0.3%w Pt and 1.2%w Sn over an alumina support with a Mg/Al ratio of 0.7/0.3. JM provided catalyst samples also based on the work of Akporiaye et al. [13] and made for the purpose of this work. The latter catalyst was used either as a pellet with egg-shell catalyst coating with average thickness of 60 μm, or as a powder obtained by crushing the pellets. Generally, the screening of experimental condition effects (operating pressure and steam content) was carried out on sample “A”; once operating conditions were fixed, activity tests were carried out by sweeping the temperature on samples “B”, “C” and “D”

2.2. Experimental apparatus
The experimental setup was realized in the ProCEED laboratories of the Department of Industrial Engineering at the University of Salerno. Tests were carried out in a tubular stainless steel AISI 310 reactor with an inner diameter of 18 mm, a length of 380 mm and a wall thickness of 4 mm. Two thermocouples were inserted both above and below of the catalytic bed to measure reaction temperature and a pressure gauge was placed at the inlet of the reactor to measure the inlet gas pressure. In order to minimize homogeneous reactions of both reactants and products streams, the reactor volume upstream and downstream the catalyst was filled respectively with quartz, so reducing the residence times of the process stream outside the catalytic volume.
The reactor was placed in an electrical oven (nominal power of 4 kW) to ensure isothermal operating temperature up to 1000 °C. The folding oven incorporates three independent heating zones, each controlled by a TLK38 type temperature controller in order to achieve a uniform temperature profile along the reactor.
A series of mass flow controllers was used to regulate propane feed flow-rate, helium sweep gas and activation/regeneration gasses; the gaseous reactants were supplied as ultrapure gas by Sol S.p.A. Furthermore, as steam source, bi-distilled water was fed to the system in liquid state by means of a peristaltic pump: liquid water was vaporized through a coil placed inside the reactor. The amount of delivered water was verified by checking weight reduction of the beaker where water was stocked.
The reaction products were analyzed continuously with a Hiden Analytical mass spectrometer, after a cooling stage aimed to condense humidity. Through the MASoft Professional software interface it was possible to analyze the concentrations of propane, propylene, ethane, ethylene, methane, helium, hydrogen by following m/z = 44, 41, 30, 26, 16, 4 and 2 respectively. Since the analysis on CO and CO2 content was not possible by mass spectrometer (due to the fragmentations of heavy hydrocarbons on mass 28 and 44), an ABB IR based analyzer was required to evaluate the concentrations of carbon monoxide and dioxide in the outlet stream; the contribution of CO2 to m/z = 44 signal was subtracted before propane concentration was evaluated. Coke formation, and then coke selectivity, was evaluated by closing carbon balance, as the balance after accounting for concentrations of only propane, propylene, ethane, ethylene, methane, hydrogen carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The coke formation estimation was confirmed by after-test coke burning, showing an overall experimental error within 6%.
2.3. Experimental procedure
The experimental tests were carried out on with of 8.9 g of catalyst, diluted 1/1 vol with quartz powder (510 ÷ 700 μm) in order to minimize pressure drops and/or to enlarge the heat transfer surface toward the catalytic volume. In all tests, a 0.60 NL/min propane was fed to the system, eventually adding steam to reach the desired C3H8 to H2O ratio. The proposed operating conditions assured a WHSV = 8 h−1, as the ratio between the propane mass rate and the catalyst mass.
The catalyst was activated in situ in 3 main steps, according to the suppliers indications: a TPR pre-treatment with a 5% H2 in He 0.60 NL/min stream and 20 °C/min heating rate, followed by 1 h in isothermal condition at 600 °C under the same feed; an oxidation phase at 600 °C for 1 h with a 2% O2 in N2 0.60 NL/min stream; a reduction phase at 600 °C for 1 h with 0.60 NL/min of pure H2.
Experiments were conducted in a fixed bed isothermal reactor either by stepwise changing total pressure, while reaching steady state at each pressure, or by sweeping temperature at a rate of 1 °C/min.
The experimental propane conversion was compared to the equilibrium conversion of the main reaction while accounting for the dilution effects of steam.
3. PDH kinetics and modeling
3.1. Main reaction: propane dehydrogenation
The main reaction rate expression (Table 2) were derived using experiments on Pt-Sn/Mg(Al)O powder catalysts (cat. A & B). The activation energy was determined from the conversion dependence on temperature (Fig. 3); the conversion, in turn, was used to determine the forward reaction constant (k1), using the PFR design equation (see Section 4) with a rate expression suggested by Lobera et al. [12], for their experiments over Pt-Sn-K/Al2O3. The mode took into account the main reaction along with propane cracking and ethylene hydrogenation side reactions. We adopted the inhibition parameter (the denominator) from this work. For Cat A the activation energy was similar to that in [12] while for cat B it differ somewhat. The pre-exponential parameter k01, which was calibrated for each catalyst was found to be higher here than suggested in the Lobera et al. model. The parameter ‘a’ represents activity factor due to catalyst deactivation, and initially (at t = 0) a = 1. This expression considers that inhibition is dominated by propylene adsorbed to catalytic active sites. As can be seen from the expression, this inhibition effect is not negligible. At typical operation conditions of PC3H8 = 3 bar and T = 520 °C, equilibrium conversion results in about PC3H6 ≈ 0.4 bar, inhibiting the reaction by more than 10% of its initial (zero conversion) rate. Note that the apparent activation energy is smaller than predicted from first principles [19] but the calculations verify the much stronger inhibition of propylene compared with that of propane; yet, the former was predicted to have a much stronger temperature dependence.

Good agreement with experimental results is obtained using these parameter (Fig. 3), although this presentation is somewhat insensitive to operating condition as results are quite close to equilibrium. For that reason we have not attempted to estimate the inhibition term.
Temperature effect tests were performed on catalysts B, C & D. While the kinetics was derived using the powder catalyst (cat. B), the larger pellets (cat. C, D) were studied to assess pellet diffusion effect (Fig. 3), which is discussed later in this work (section 4). The powder catalysts showed the highest conversion in the whole investigated temperature range, suggesting diffusion limitations in pellet samples.
Pressure effect tests were performed on catalyst A. The experimental test was carried out, by increasing operating pressure from 1 to 6 absolute bar: pressure variation was obtained by 1 bar steps, the composition (as well as conversion and selectivity values) was recorded after the transitory phases was over. Modeled results were obtained by solving the reactor model with the main and all reactions described below. Fig. 1, Fig. 2 show experimental and modeled results of pressure effect on conversion and propylene selectivity:

Experimental results show a conversion that is 1.5–2% higher than the simulated results and are above equilibrium line at about the same extent. Since all side reactions consume propane (directly or indirectly) and their rates increase with pressure (discussed below), a propane conversion higher than PDH equilibrium conversion was anticipated at higher pressure. At lower pressure there is a decrease in the rates of side reactions and most of the conversion is due to PDH, which leads to a lower equilibrium conversion.
Selectivity was calculated by solving the reactor model with the main and all reactions described below and expressing exit selectivity by molar flows at the reactor exit

As expected, propylene selectivity decreased with increasing temperature, and was better than 92% in all samples in operating temperature below 550 °C, confirming the overall good performances of the tested samples. In contradiction to the computed trend, the pellet samples registered the best performances in term of selectivity.
3.2. Propane cracking and ethylene hydrogenation
Rate expressions for propane cracking and ethylene hydrogenation (Eqs. (2) and (3)), along with comparison to other works, are described in Table 3:
The activation energies of propane cracking and ethylene hydrogenation were adopted from Lobera et al. [12] and only the pre-exponential values were calibrated. Experimental data showed both reactions to be faster than those in [12] (see Table 3). Good agreement is obtained (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). The activation energy is high but still smaller than that by first principle predictions [19].

Pressure effect tests were performed on catalyst A (Fig. 2, Fig. 5). While CO and CO2 presence is attributed to propane steam reforming (discussed below), concentrations of other side products are affected by other possible side reactions which were not included in the model due to negligible effect on the main reaction (CH4 steam reforming etc.). It should be noted that since side reactions are significantly slower than the main reaction, inhibition effects on the overall product distribution are negligible.
Temperature effect tests were performed on catalysts B, C & D. Cracking selectivity was calculated using CH4 molar flow at the reactor exit (i.e., Eq. (5), i = CH4), assuming negligible amount of CH4 that undergoes side reactions such as steam reforming: Modeled and experimental temperature effects on exit selectivity of CH4 are shown in Fig. 6:
The results reported in Fig. 6 suggest that the increasing pellets size resulted in an increasing of selectivity to methane. The strange selectivity recorded on 5 mm pellets may be devoted to inaccuracy in methane detection, since methane concentration ranged between 0.1 and 0.5% up to 550 °C.
3.3. Steam reforming
Due to the addition of steam as a coke reducing agent and under the catalytic conditions present in the PDH system, propane and propylene can undergo steam reforming (SR). As mentioned above, kinetics expressions were proven problematic to find for these reactions.
The SR kinetics suggested in this work is a simplified form of propane steam reforming reactions, aimed to provide an estimate of the total rate of CO and CO2 formation. The distinction between the two rates will require the modeling of several additional reactions, such as water gas shift, methane SR etc. As shown in Fig. 3 the latter is evident here since concentration of CH4, which is formed by cracking, is always lower than the sum of C2H4 and C2H6 (which formed by C2H4 hydrogenation).
Steam reforming was simplified assuming equal reactivity of C3H8 and C3H6 into CO and CO2 (product distribution is arbitrary). The simplified reactions and suggested rate expression are shown in Table 4:

As SR is most likely to occur on active catalytic sites, it was assumed to be affected by propylene inhibition in the same manner as the main reaction. Thus, inhibition term (rate equation denominator) is the same as for PDH reaction.
Pressure effect tests were performed on catalyst A. Calibration of parameters was performed on experimental exit composition using GC (Fig. 7). It was assumed that equilibrium is reached early enough along the reactor length to assume equilibrium conditions.

4. Catalyst deactivation
4.1. Catalyst activity changes
Here we use two sources of deactivation information: long-term measurements of decline of apparent activity and short-term measurements of selectivity to carbon. We try to relate the two. We start with a simple model with linear temporal rate of activity decline with a slope that depends on gas-phase composition. We then try to estimate coverage by carbon and relate the activity to carbon coverage.
The long runs show catalyst deactivation over 8 h of operation. After each run, the test was stopped by replacing propane with nitrogen and by cooling system at room temperature, keeping catalyst in such condition overnight. The test was repeated by heating system in nitrogen up to the reaction temperature, and then replacing nitrogen with propane for test restarting. The resulting conversions are shown in Fig. 9:

Results reported in Fig. 9 show that the shut-down and start-up procedures lead to an undesired and sensible catalyst (partial) regeneration, as the catalyst seemed to partially recover its activity in the early part of each test. To find the activity from the f(t) measurements we determine k01 of the main reaction in the following way: Using the design equation of a PFR mass balance for 20%vol H2O in feed (A = C3H8, B = C3H6), while neglecting side reactions we find:
(7)
We translated conversion vs time results for catalyst A and B into k1(t). This main reaction k decline approximately linearly as shown in Fig. 10:

We find an approximate linear decline with time for both cases. So activity can be expressed as:
(8)
To find the pressure dependence we use the selectivity to carbon data. We assume it is described for short times by the following expression, based on a coking model of PDH on Pt/Al2O3 following van Sint Annaland et al. [17] that suggested that coke is formed from adsorbed propylene. To express θC3H6 we kept the original parameters suggested in [17], and added a temperature dependent variable, B(T):
(9)
We calibrated B(T) at T = 540 °C, by fitting the coke selectivity derived from this expression to experimental coke selectivity data from tests on catalyst A and 1–4 bar pressure range (Fig. 11). The suggested activity expression, for short times and T = 540 °C, is presented in Table 5:

4.2. Coke coverage and effect on activity
The purpose of this section is to estimate coke coverage from measurements of selectivity to carbon, assuming monolayer carbon formation, and compare its dependence with that of activity. Coke formation is assumed follow the polymerization of adsorbed propylene, coked active sites are assumed to be covered with covalently bonded carbon atoms.
Experimental coke selectivity is calculated by carbon mass balance over the inlet and outlet compositions is defined as:
(10)
where FC [moleC/s] is the net molar carbon deposition rate over the entire surface (3 molesmol of carbon per mole of reacted propane), using the definition of conversion
. Expressing growth rate of catalyst coke coverage area (dAcoke/dt), using coke molar deposition rate, carbon molecule cross section [24] (
) then coke partial coverage growth rate is:
(11)
where Acabon = πRC2,
is the surface area of the Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst [13]: Integrating in time will reveal θC(t). The k01(t) determined for catalyst B is shown in Fig. 10 (right): Using SC to calculate the θC(t) (Fig. 12) the relation between main reaction rate constant. k01 and coke coverage was obtained as described in Fig. 13 and Eq. (5).

Coke coverage change θC/dt is a function of pressure and temperature. Pressure and steam content effects were tested on the powder catalysts (Cat. A, B). The tests were conducted on the same run (without regenerations between different conditions). For each run dθC/dt was calculated. Pressures above 5 bar and steam contents less than 5% will lead to high coking rates (Fig. 14, Fig. 15).

Pellet size effects and temperature dependency of coking selectivity was also tested using Cat. B, C, D. The apparent activation energy of coking can be evaluated by plotting ln(dθC/dt) vs 1/T (Fig. 16) in the higher temperature range (535–600 °C) where coking effect is most dominant: Note that the 2 mm pellets coking rates are smaller than that of the powder, showing also the highest apparent activation energy. Higher coking rates and higher activation energy for larger particles can suggest two effects that can lower net coke formation for a volume of catalyst: (a) pore blockage due to multilayer coking, which is unlikely for the short term used here, or (b) the effect of diffusion limitations when the coking rate depends on the reactant (propane) rather than the product (propene), since on average the pellet catalyst contains less reactant than the powder. This is contrary to current understanding of coke formation.

Further calculations (See Pellet Diffusion Effect section below) show that the average pore radius is approximately 7[nm]. Considering that covalent radius of carbon is 0.07[nm], monolayer coke formation is unlikely to block a pore and we can expect a pore blockage only if multilayer coke formation was sufficiently strong. Multilayer coking would not yield good θC linearity with t, which is indeed seen here, meaning that coking is mainly formed in a monolayer.
5. Pellet diffusion effects
Three pellet sizes were tested (Table 1). The effect of temperature on conversion (Fig. 3), and on selectivity (to cracking or SR products, Fig. 6, Fig. 8), and on selectivity to coke was studied in a bed by sweeping its temperature up at a rate of 1 °C/min. Tests were carried out on the same amount of catalyst (8.9 g) by feeding steam and propane (ratio 1:4) up to having a WHSV = 8 h−1. The purpose of this section is to extract kinetic information and simulate the effect of pellet size on conversion, activity and selectivity of the Pt-Sn/Mg(Al)O PDH catalyst. The analytical calculations shown here and in Appendix A assumes that the catalyst loading is uniform. In practice, however, the 2 mm and 5 mm pellets were ‘egg–shell’ type catalyst of the same thickness coating, so that the larger pellet is, on average, of a lower catalyst content.
5.1. Analytical solution assuming uniform deposition
To simulate the conversion dependence on temperature for the various pellet sizes we take the following steps: (i) Write the analytical solution of a 1st order reversible kinetics, (ii) determine the reaction constant from the conversion data f(T), (iii) estimate the diffusivity and (iv) estimate the effectiveness factor vs T and the overall rate using the analytical approximation derived in (i). Simulation results and comparison with experimental results are presented below.
For the reversible reaction the rate expression is:
(13)
r = kC,1C1-k'C,2C2CH ∼  kC1C1-kC2C2
where r is the reaction rate in [mol/ss−1s−1ec/gr], components 1 and 2 stand for C3H8 and C3H6 and CH for hydrogen. It is assumed that hydrogen diffusivity is large so that CH is almost constant and the kinetics is linear.
,
are rate constants for forward and reverse reaction. The hydrogen concentration is assumed to be its equilibrium value (although CH ∼ Cin -C1 is a better approximation, the difference between the two is expected to be small). Under these assumptions the effectiveness factor can be determined analytically [25] as we do in the Appendix A.
The effectiveness factor (Eq. (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6)) was estimated for the two catalyst pellets using the ‘true' rate constant which was estimated from the kinetics on powder for catalyst B, and the estimated diffusion coefficient Deff for T = 540 °C which was assumed to be approximately constant within this temperature range. Modeled effectiveness factor is shown in Fig. 17. Note that η increases with temperature due to the approximation made in converting the problem into a first order reaction (kc2 ∼ CH, which increases with temperature).

Prediction of temperature effect on conversion of the main reaction was also performed using calculated effectiveness factor while neglecting side reactions. Simulated results of conversion and propylene selectivity were obtained using the full reactor model. Simulated and experimental results are shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4 showing, as expected, that while diffusion effect is significant (η ∼ 0.1) the effect on conversion is small, as the system operates close to equilibrium.
5.2. Propane cracking
Diffusion effects on cracking can be examined as well when we consider that selectivity is affected by C3H8 pressure inside a particle. Since the effectiveness factor is defined as the ratio between actual (i.e., average) and surface reaction rates, it can also be expressed in terms of reactant pressure. For a given particle radius R, and under equilibrium conversion:
(14)
where
is the average partial pressure inside a particle and
is the surface partial pressure. Isolating
from Eq. (14):
(15)
while considering the entire reactor, we consider C3H8 pressure as the particle surface changes along the reactor. Hence, using Eq. (15), cracking rate along the reactor can be expressed as:
(16)
Simulated and experimental cracking selectivity are shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 6, showing in general good agreement, with the expected trend in simulated results (better selectivity to propylene in powder catalyst), while experiments show at high temperatures an opposite trend. The selectivity to methane was found to be insensitive to pellet size at high temperatures, while simulations exhibit the poorer selectivity with larger pellets.
5.3. Steam reforming
Simulated and experimental cracking selectivities (Fig. 8) show higher selectivity to SR products in simulations with large pellets while experiments sow the powder catalyst having the higher selectivity.
5.4. First order reaction approximation for PDH
In order to treat PDH reaction as a 1st order reversible reaction, we assess the denominator (inhibition term) of the kinetic rate expression that was used in our model, as previously shown in Table 6:
(17)
The largest propylene concentration is that in equilibrium and for temperatures below 500C this value is smaller than 1.05, justifying our assumption.

6. Conclusions
A comprehensive kinetic model for propane dehydrogenation on a Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst was composed.
The catalysts used are very active, approaching the thermodynamic propane conversion values in a wide range of operating conditions. On the other hand, the most severe operating conditions (high pressure, low steam content) resulted in a significant reduction in selectivity to propylene, mainly due to the increasing of coke formation rate. Samples B, C and D showed appreciable performances in the temperature range 450–550 °C, in which the selectivity to propylene reached the maximum values.
Parameters were estimated from steady state experiments at varying pressure and from temperature-programmed experiments, and are compared with previous models on similar catalysts. The kinetics of the main reaction shows similar activation energy and activity to other reported Pt catalysts and so are the properties of the cracking reaction. Steam was added to slow coke formation, leading to some steam reforming which was accounted for in the model. The rate of deactivation is slower than that of other catalysts and was shown to correlate with carbon build up on the surface, which was determined from the selectivity to carbon. In order to achieve a more comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon, in a future work a detailed analysis of the turnover frequencies for the proposed catalysts will be carried out; such approach will assure a more effective correlation between catalytic active sites with the rate of deactivation.
Application of the model to design a Pd-membrane reactor suggests that pressure should be kept below 5 bar to suppress side-reaction and deactivation (Fig. 2, Fig. 14) and steam should be maintained around 10% in feed (Fig. 15), while pellet size affects mainly the selectivity while the effect on conversion is small. While the main reaction is fast, side reactions are not negligible, especially under conditions of a membrane reactor, but selectivity to propane can be maintained about 95%. Parallel studies of membrane coking showed a strong compensating effects of temperature and of hydrogen concentration [26]; for practical hydrogen concentrations the required membrane temperature should be kept as low as 250C to avoid coking [20], [26]. Reactor design should optimize the contradicting demands of high temperatures for efficient conversion and low temperature for maintaining stable membrane operation. A simple integrated reactor design led to fast deactivation of both membrane and catalyst [8], [19].

Determining the effectiveness factor
The dimensionless reaction–diffusion problem for a spherical particle of the approximated linear reversible reaction rate expression takes the following form after proper scaling [27].

where r, R are the coordinate and size, and
are the dimensionless distance from equilibrium, dimensionless particle radius and the Thiele modulus. The solution to this problem follows [27]:

Reaction rate of the main reaction was extracted from experimental data, using the isothermal PFR design equation under assumption that side reactions are negligible (rPDH > >rsidereactions):
(A-8)
Isolating kη on the L.H.S and solving the integral:
(A-9)
We use the data in Fig. 3 to extract k1 for powder catalyst (Cat. B.) using Eq. (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), assuming η = 1 and plot its ln vs 1/T. The pre-exponential and activation energy for JM catalyst are close to the parameters fitted to SINTEF catalyst based on pressure test: k01 of JM and SINTEF catalysts was found to be 3.78*10−3 and 11.5*10−3 [mol/ss−1s−1ec/gr/bar] respectively, and Ea1 was found to be 30.45 and 34.5 [kJ/molmol−1] respectively.
Estimation of diffusivity
Diffusivity was calculated for SINTEF Pt,Sn/Mg(Al)O catalyst (cat. A), having a surface area of 190 m2/gr [13]. Due to relatively high fraction of C3H8 in reaction feed, diffusing components were assumed to be mainly C3H8 and C3H6. To determine diffusion type, pore radius was estimated as 7.1 nm, from density
, porosity
, surface area A = 190m2/g (thus A/εV = 2/Rpore = 28.107m2/m3)
The Knudsen number for a gas in the reaction conditions (ideal gas) is:
(A-10)
For this Kn value diffusion is assumed to be in transition between molecular and Knudsen diffusion regimes, with the diffusivity calculated as:
(A-11)
The Knudsen diffusivity is estimated from
(A-12)
The Molecular diffusivity (based on Chapman–Enskog theory) of propane in propylene is:
(A-13)
(A-14)
Thus the effective diffusivity, assuming the well accepted correction for tortuosity ∼ 1/ε,
(A-15)
Higher diffusivity maybe expected in a mixture with hydrogen, but since H2 concentration this value is small it will not affect results significantly.
