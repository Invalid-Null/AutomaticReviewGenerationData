The given document does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). It focuses on the synthesis and characterization of La-doped γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles as catalyst supports. While alumina supports could potentially be used for PDH or ODH catalysts, this particular study does not investigate propane conversion or propylene yield. There is no mention of using the La-doped γ-Al2O3 for either PDH or ODH specifically. Therefore, I do not believe this study is directly related to propane dehydrogenation.
