The given document discusses the synthesis and characterization of lanthanum (La)-doped gamma-alumina (γ-Al2O3) nanoparticles as catalyst supports. It does not mention propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The document focuses on improving the thermal stability of γ-Al2O3 by doping it with lanthanum, but does not relate this to propylene production from propane. Therefore, this document does not seem directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation.
