Pt–Carbon interaction-determined reaction pathway and selectivity for hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural over carbon supported Pt catalysts†
In this study, a series of Pt catalysts supported on carbon materials, including multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), and biochar (BC), were prepared by impregnation or atomic layer deposition (ALD) methods. The Pt content was around 2.5 wt% in all the Pt catalysts, and the average Pt particle size was 1.6–1.9 nm for the catalysts prepared by impregnation (IM), which was slightly larger than that for the Pt catalyst (∼1.4 nm) synthesized by ALD (Pt/CNTs-ALD). All the catalysts were used in the HMF hydrogenation reaction to investigate the effects of different carbon materials and Pt–carbon interactions on the catalytic performance of catalysts. The main product was DHMF over all the Pt catalysts prepared by impregnation, and Pt/BC-IM showed the highest turnover frequency and the highest selectivity to DHMF (95.3%) with an HMF conversion of 94.6% after 10 h of reaction time, which could be due to the abundant functional groups on the surface of BC. Compared with the Pt/CNTs-IM catalyst, the main product over the Pt/CNTs-ALD catalyst was DMF with a yield of 47% due to the relatively strong Pt–CNT interaction. The interaction between Pt and CNTs is the dominant factor in determining the main product in the selective HMF hydrogenation reaction. After introducing Ni nanoparticles to Pt/CNTs-ALD, the yield of DMF reached 93.4% over the PtNi/CNTs-ALD bimetallic catalyst owing to the synergistic effect between Pt and Ni.
1. Introduction
With the shrinkage of fossil resources, efficient synthesis of renewable fuel and high value-added chemicals from biomass has recently attracted global attention.1,2 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), which can be derived from biomass, is one of the most important platform chemicals.3–5 Since it contains several functional groups, including a furan ring, an aldehyde group, and a hydroxymethyl group, HMF can be converted into valuable chemicals and fuels, such as 2,5-bishydroxymethylfuran (DHMF),6,7 5-methyl furfural (5-MF),8 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF),9–12 and 5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (DMTHF),13–15 as shown in Fig. 1. Among these chemicals, DMF is a promising and potential biofuel due to its high energy density (30 MJ L−1) and high research octane number (RON = 119),16 and DHMF is an important chemical that can be used as a precursor for functional polymers, resins, artificial fibers, drugs, and high-value fine chemicals.17,18 Thus, a high yield of DHMF and DMF in the catalytic hydrogenation of HMF is pursued by researchers, and it is the key to the design and fabrication of catalysts with high activity and high selectivity to the target product.
Fig. 1 Proposed reaction pathways for the conversion of HMF. Compounds: 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfural (HMF), 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan (DHMF), 5-methylfurfural (5-MF), 5-methyl furfuryl alcohol (MFA), 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), 5-bis(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (DHTHF), and 2,5-dimethyltetrahydrofuran (DMTHF).
As shown in Fig. 1, DHMF is synthesized from hydrogenation of HMF, and DMF will be produced after further hydrogenolysis over various supported metal catalysts, including Pt-, Ru-, and Cu-based catalysts.19,20 Among them, some metal catalysts supported on carbon materials with outstanding catalytic performance have been reported and high yield of the target product has been achieved.21–24 For example, Yu et al. reported a robust carbon nanotube (CNT) supported Ni–Fe catalyst and the selectivity to DHMF was as high as 96% at 110 °C.21 Yang and co-workers prepared Ni–Co/C bimetallic catalysts by a wetness impregnation method, and an up to 95% DMF yield was obtained at 130 °C and 10 bar H2.24 In our previous study, Pt–Co/CNT bimetallic catalysts were prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD), and a more than 90% DMF yield was achieved with complete conversion of HMF.25 Thus, carbon materials were reported as efficient supports for selective HMF hydrogenation reaction. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the effects of carbon supports and the interaction between Pt and carbon supports on the selective hydrogenation of HMF to target products, and the catalytic mechanism has not been well revealed.
Herein, in this study, a series of carbon material supported Pt catalysts with an ultra-small Pt particle size were prepared by impregnation to investigate the effects of carbon supports, including multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), and biochar (BC), in the HMF hydrogenation reaction. DHMF was the main product over all the catalysts, and Pt/BC-IM showed the highest yield of DHMF (>90%) with a selectivity of >95%. Under various reaction conditions, the main product was still DHMF, though the HMF conversion and DHMF selectivity varied, and almost no further hydrogenation/hydrogenolysis reaction occurred. But, interestingly, when we tuned the Pt–carbon interactions through preparing a Pt/CNT catalyst by ALD, the main product changed to DMF over the Pt/CNTs-ALD catalyst with a similar Pt loading and particle size. Thus, the interactions between Pt and carbon supports are the dominant factor in determining the main product in the selective HMF hydrogenation reaction for Pt catalysts.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Chemicals and materials
CNTs (>95%, OD 10–20 nm) and GO were purchased from Nanjing XFNANO Materials Tech Co Ltd. HMF (98%), DHMF (97%), DMF (99%), 1-butanol (99.5%), and n-tridecane (99%) were purchased from J&K Chemicals, Ltd. (Methylcyclopentadienyl)trimethylplatinum [(MeCp)PtMe3] (99%) and bis(cyclopentadienyl)nickel (NiCp2, 99%) were obtained from Strem Chemicals, Inc. Biochar and g-C3N4 were prepared in the lab as explained in detail in the following section.
2.2. Preparation of carbon supports
Biochar (BC) was prepared by slow pyrolysis of rice husks, as described in detail previously.26,27 Briefly, a certain amount of rice husks was added in a thermal cracking reactor, and then the pyrolysis temperature was increased from room temperature to 550 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. Finally, the obtained BC samples were crushed to pass through a 50-mesh sieve before further processing. g-C3N4 was synthesized by heating urea at 550 °C for 2 hours in a semi-closed quartz crucible placed inside a muffle furnace.
2.3. Preparation of Pt-based catalysts
Pt catalysts supported on carbon materials were prepared by a simple impregnation method. Briefly, 0.1 g of H2PtCl6 was firstly dissolved in 80 mL of deionized water and then 0.5 g of supports were added. After stirring to dry at 70 °C, the obtained samples were washed three times with ethanol. Then, the samples were dried overnight at 60 °C. At last, the samples were reduced by flowing a 5 vol% H2/Ar mixture at 400 °C with a flow rate of 120 mL min−1 for 2 hours. The catalysts are labeled as Pt/CNTs-IM, Pt/rGO-IM, Pt/g-C3N4-IM, and Pt/BC-IM with different supports.
In order to adjust the Pt–CNT interaction and study the effects of the interaction on the catalytic performance, ALD was adopted to prepare another Pt/CNT catalyst (labeled as Pt/CNTs-ALD) with a similar Pt loading and particle size, and the scheme of the ALD reactor is shown in Fig. S1.† 1 cycle of Pt ALD was applied on CNTs at 300 °C, and (methylcyclopentadienyl)trimethylplatinum [(MeCp)PtMe3] and oxygen (O2) were used as the precursors. During the ALD process, (MeCp)PtMe3 reacted with functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl groups) on the surface of the CNTs, and thus chemical bonds formed between Pt and the CNTs with strong interactions.28 Since the burning point of BC is relatively low and O2 is a precursor in the ALD process, Pt ALD was not applied for BC. In order to further optimize the ALD-prepared catalyst and enhance the catalytic performance, 3 cycles of Pt ALD and 1 cycle of Ni ALD were applied on CNTs to prepare a PtNi bimetallic catalyst (labeled as PtNi/CNTs-ALD). For Ni ALD, NiCp2 and H2 were used as precursors and the reaction temperature was 300 °C. The details of Pt ALD and Ni ALD are described in the ESI.†
2.4. Catalyst characterization
The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and pore size distribution of the carbon supports were analyzed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. The Pt content and Ni content in all the catalysts before and after HMF hydrogenation reactions were measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The size and distribution of metal NPs on the supports were directly observed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, FEI-Tecnai G2 F20). The crystal structure and the functional groups of the catalysts were analyzed by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out for all the Pt catalysts. The reduction properties of the catalysts were evaluated by H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) using a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920. The details of BET analysis, HRTEM, XRD, XPS, and H2-TPR are described in the ESI.†
2.5. Hydrogenation of HMF
The HMF hydrogenation reactions were performed in a stainless-steel reactor, which was described in detail previously.25 Typically, first, a certain amount of catalyst was added into the reactor. Then, 0.5 g HMF, 0.05 g n-tridecane (internal standard), and 40 mL of 1-butanol were introduced to the reactor. In order to remove the air in the reactor, the reactor was first pressurized to 10 bar with H2 and then depressurized to atmospheric pressure ten times. Then, a certain H2 pressure (10–30 bar) was applied in the reactor and the temperature was increased to a set point (160–180 °C). After the temperature reached the set point, the reaction started with a slurry stirring speed of 500 rpm for all experiments. At certain time intervals, 1–1.5 mL samples were collected, filtered, and analyzed using a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector (GC-FID, Agilent Technologies Inc., 6890). The individual components were separated using a 30 meter DB-5 capillary column. The initial column temperature was set at 70 °C and programmed to 250 °C at 20 °C min−1, and then the temperature was maintained at 250 °C for 4 min. Both the injector temperature and the FID temperature were set at 250 °C. After reaction, the used catalysts were collected, washed with 1-butanol 3 times, and dried at 60 °C in an oven overnight for cycling tests.
Besides, in order to study the effect of carbon supports on the catalytic performance, we evaluated the adsorption of HMF by the supports. Briefly, in each test, 0.1 g of carbon supports were added in a 1-butanol solution with 0.2 g HMF. At 10–60 min intervals, 1 mL samples were collected, filtered, and analyzed by GC-FID to obtain the adsorption rate of HMF.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of the Pt catalysts
As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1, all four carbon supports had a porous structure, and the CNTs had the highest surface area (197 m2 g−1) with a total pore volume of 0.79 cm3 g−1, followed by g-C3N4 (105 m2 g−1, 0.62 cm3 g−1), rGO (65 m2 g−1, 0.32 cm3 g−1), and BC (9 m2 g−1, 0.27 cm3 g−1). Compared with the surface areas of the rGO samples in previous reports,29,30 the low surface area of the rGO samples in this study could be due to the accumulation of graphite layers. From the pore size distribution in Fig. 2b, all samples showed a sharp peak centered at around 3.3–3.6 nm. In addition, both CNTs and g-C3N4 showed another broad peak at around 5–25 nm and 16–50 nm, respectively. Based on the ICP-AES analysis, the Pt content in all the catalysts was between 2.2 wt% and 2.6 wt%. Though the supports had different surface areas and pore volumes, the initial volume of the platinum precursor solution (80 mL) was much larger than the pore volume of the supports, so the surface properties of the supports had little effect on the Pt loading in the impregnation method. A similar phenomenon was also reported by Zhang et al.31 The Pt loading and Ni loading of PtNi/CNTs-ALD were 8.6 wt% and 1.5 wt%, respectively.

HRTEM images of the catalysts prepared by the impregnation method are presented in Fig. 3. Ultra-small Pt NPs were highly dispersed on the four supports, and the average Pt particle sizes were similar (1.6–1.9 nm) for all four catalysts (Table 1). Fig. 4 shows HRTEM images of the Pt/CNTs-ALD and PtNi/CNTs-ALD samples, and metal NPs were deposited on CNTs with an average particle size of 1.4–1.7 nm, which was similar to that on CNTs prepared by the impregnation method. The result is in agreement with our previous study.32 Some “twinned” NPs were observed and circled in Fig. 4d, indicating the formation of Pt–Ni bimetallic NPs. To verify the bimetallic structure of Pt–Ni, STEM-EDS analysis was performed for a single nanoparticle (NP). As shown in Fig. S2,† the result for elemental composition indicates the formation of a Pt–Ni bimetallic NP prepared by ALD.

In order to obtain the turnover frequency (TOF) and evaluate the catalytic activity, the Pt dispersion on the different catalysts is required, which is calculated using the following two equations:33,34

where L is the Pt content (wt%), f is the particle shape correction factor (f = 6 for a sphere), d is the average diameter of Pt NPs measured by HRTEM, z is the Pt density, M is the formula weight of Pt, N is Avogadro's number, and A is the metal atomic surface area (for Pt, A = 8 Å2 per atom). As shown in Table 1, the Pt dispersion of the catalysts prepared by impregnation was 60–70%, and that of the Pt/CNTs-ALD catalyst reached 81%.
FT-IR spectra of all samples were shown in Fig. 5a. The FT-IR spectra of Pt/g-C3N4-IM exhibited several conventional peaks of g-C3N4 at about 3000–3600, 1200–1650, and 812 cm−1. The broad band in the region of 3000–3600 cm−1 could be assigned to the stretching vibration of N–H groups.35 The bands at 1200–1650 cm−1 were contributed by the aromatic C–N stretching vibrations.36,37 The peak at 812 cm−1 was considered to be the characteristic breathing mode of the triazine units.35,36 For the Pt/CNTs-IM, Pt/rGO-IM, and Pt/BC-IM catalysts, the peak at 3423 cm−1 was contributed by the hydroxyl groups (–OH),38–40 besides the obtained peaks at around 2920 cm−1 that are linked to the stretching of a methylene group, indicating the presence of methylene groups (CH) on the surface of Pt/CNTs-IM and Pt/rGO-IM.41,42 The band assigned to the skeletal vibration of CC and CO is shown at around 1633 cm−1,43 and the peaks located at 1080 and 807 cm−1 are ascribed to C–O and C–H stretching vibration.38,44

XRD profiles of the Pt catalysts are presented in Fig. 5b. Pt/rGO-IM exhibits two diffraction peaks at 30.9° and 64.2°, corresponding to the (0 0 2) and (0 0 4) crystal planes of graphite-2H (JCPDS card no. 41-1487), respectively. For the Pt/CNTs-IM catalyst, there are two peaks at 30.2° and 50.3°, corresponding to the (0 0 2) and (1 0 0) crystal planes of graphite, respectively, according to JCPDS card no.08-0415. The XRD pattern of Pt/g-C3N4-IM shows a peak at 32.2° corresponding to (1 1 0) of carbon nitride according to JCPDS card no. 50-1512. These characteristic peaks indicate that the supports maintained their typical structure in the preparation of the catalysts. In the XRD pattern of Pt/BC-IM, the diffraction peak at 47° corresponds to the (1 1 1) plane of Pt, owing to better crystallinity, while diffraction peaks related to the Pt phase were not detected on Pt/CNTs-IM, Pt/rGO-IM, and Pt/g-C3N4-IM. In addition, the Pt lattice structure can be observed in the HRTEM images, as shown in Fig. 3e–h.
XPS analysis was carried out to examine the composition and valence state of the Pt-based catalysts, as shown in Fig. 6a and S3–S5.† For the Pt/CNTs-IM, Pt/rGO-IM, Pt/g-C3N4-IM and Pt/BC-IM catalysts, the Pt0 4f7/2 binding energies (BEs) were around 71.4, 71.1, 71.5 and 71.4 eV, respectively, and the Pt0 4f5/2 BEs were around 74.8, 74.5, 74.9 and 74.8 eV, respectively. rGO contains a large amount of graphitic carbon structures, and the main reason for the lower Pt0 BE for the Pt/rGO-IM catalyst could be ascribed to the π-electron transfer from the graphitic carbon to the Pt NPs.45 The slightly higher Pt0 BE of the Pt/g-C3N4-IM catalyst could be due to the fact that the outer electrons of Pt transferred from the Pt NPs to the g-C3N4 containing a large amount of the N element with high electronegativity.46 For these Pt catalysts, the ratios of Pt0/PtII were around 3 : 1 (Table S1†). The Pt XPS spectrum of Pt/CNTs-ALD displayed two Pt0 characteristic peaks at 71.9 and 75.2 eV, corresponding to Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2, respectively, which exhibited a higher binding energy owing to the chemical bonding between Pt NPs and CNTs. In addition, for all the Pt catalysts, the peaks of PtIIO were weak, implying that most of the Pt NPs remained in the metallic state. For PtNi/CNTs-ALD, the binding energy peaks at around 71.5 eV and 75.1 eV are ascribed to Pt7/2 and Pt5/2 owing to the presence of zero-valent Pt0, and the Pt7/2 and Pt5/2 positions of PtIIO were at around 72.8 eV and 76.0 eV, respectively. Compared to that of the Pt/CNTs-ALD catalyst, the d-band center of the PtNi/CNTs-ALD catalyst upshifted, and such a tendency implies the formation of a Pt–Ni bimetallic structure and electrons transferring from Ni to Pt.47,48 In addition, the Pt loading in the PtNi/CNTs-ALD catalyst (8.7 wt%) was higher than that in the Pt/CNTs-ALD catalyst (2.3 wt%), and thereby, more Pt NPs could be oxidized in the air, resulting in the increase of PtIIO, as Fig. 6a exhibits.
Fig. 6 (a) XPS spectra and (b) TPR analysis of the Pt-based catalysts supported on different carbon materials.
In addition, the XPS spectra of C 1s and O 1s for all the catalysts presented the functional groups on the surface of the supports (Fig. S4 and S5†). The high resolution spectra of C 1s could be deconvoluted into three peaks, corresponding to sp2 and sp3 carbon (CC and C–C 284.4 eV), carbon–oxygen bonds (C–O 285.5 eV), and carbonyl groups (CO 286.8 eV), respectively,43 and the ratios of these groups are presented in Table S1.† Moreover, for the Pt/g-C3N4-IM catalyst, the N 1s peaks at 398.4, 399.7, 401.0 and 404.3 eV can be assigned to the N–(C)3, CN–C, N–H, and π excitations, respectively (Fig. S5b†).43,49 The catalysts exhibited four peaks of O 1s at 529.5, 531.1, 532.3, and 534.9 eV, which were assigned to PtIIO, CO, C–O and –OH, respectively.43,44 Notably, the O1s peak area for the Pt/BC-IM catalyst was much larger than those for the other catalysts, which indicated a higher number of functional groups on the BC. During the hydrogenation of HMF to DMF, these functional groups may assist in activating CC of HMF, thus enhancing the selectivity for HMF to DHMF conversion.
Fig. 6b shows H2-TPR profiles of the Pt-based catalysts. For the Pt/BC-IM catalyst, there was a broad and strong peak at around 700 °C, attributed to the functional groups (C–O and CO) on the support.50 The large number of functional groups was consistent with the XPS and FT-IR results. A broad peak and a weak peak at 550 °C and 525 °C were observed for both the Pt/CNTs-IM and Pt/CNTs-ALD catalysts, indicating that there were only a few Pt NPs oxidized in the air, which was consistent with the XPS results. PtNi/CNTs-ALD presented an apparent peak centered at 435 °C, which could be due to the H2 consumption of the oxidized Ni NPs, indicating that some of the Ni NPs were oxidized in air after Ni ALD.
3.2. Catalyst performance
3.2.1. Role of the different carbon supports The catalytic performance of the Pt catalysts supported on different carbon materials is presented in Fig. 7 and S6.† The main product was DHMF over all four catalysts, and the conversion of HMF reached 97.2% with a selectivity to DHMF of 70.4% over Pt/g-C3N4-IM. A similar conversion (95.5%) and selectivity to DHMF (68.1%) over Pt/rGO-IM was observed. The Pt/BC-IM catalyst showed the highest selectivity to DHMF (95.3%), and the highest yield (90.1%) of DHMF was obtained. Pt/CNTs-IM showed the lowest HMF conversion of 72.7% with a DHMF selectivity of 49.4%. Fig. S6† presents the product distribution over the different Pt based catalysts along with reaction time, and the reaction pathway (hydrogenation of HMF to DHMF) was the same over all four Pt catalysts. The main by-product of the reaction at 10 h was 5,5-(oxybis(methylene))bis(2-methylfuran) (OMBM), as we reported previously.25 In addition, the TOF was calculated with a HMF conversion of 20%, and that of the Pt/CNTs-IM, Pt/rGO-IM, Pt/g-C3N4-IM, and Pt/BC-IM catalysts was 5.5, 9.4, 7.9, and 9.2 min−1, respectively. The TOF of Pt/CNTs-IM was much lower than that of the other three catalysts, which could be related to the inert surface of CNTs. As shown in Table 1, all of the four catalysts had a similar Pt loading and Pt particle size; however, they presented different conversions and selectivities to DHMF. This indicated that supports may play an important role in the catalytic performance.
Fig. 7 HMF conversion, selectivity to different products, and TOF over the different Pt catalysts. Reaction conditions: 0.5 g HMF, 0.05 g n-tridecane, 40 mL 1-butanol, 50 mg catalyst, 160 °C, 10 bar H2, 10 h, and 500 rpm. The TOF was calculated at a HMF conversion of 20%.
Among the four catalysts, Pt/g-C3N4-IM and Pt/rGO-IM showed the highest conversion of HMF, attributable to their high BET surface areas and the strong HMF adsorption ability of the supports. It was reported that the conversion of HMF could rely on its adsorption for hydrogenation reactions.51 To investigate the adsorption ability of the supports for HMF, adsorption experiments were performed, and the results are shown in Fig. 8. For rGO and g-C3N4, they exhibited higher adsorption capacity for HMF, which could be attributed to the fact that their high BET surface areas (65 and 105 m2 g−1) and pore volumes (0.32 and 0.62 cm3 g−1) could increase the adsorption of HMF, leading to a high conversion of HMF. Similar phenomena were also observed in other reactions.52–54 Although CNTs had the highest BET surface area (197 m2 g−1) and pore volume (0.79 cm3 g−1), the adsorption ability of HMF over CNTs was the weakest owing to the relatively inert surface and fewer functional groups. In contrast, though BC has the lowest BET surface area and pore volume, various functional groups on BC could be beneficial to improve the adsorption ability for HMF and, thereby, promote the conversion of HMF.55 Moreover, the high selectivity to DHMF over Pt/BC-IM could be due to the functional groups on BC (e.g., hydroxyl (–OH), carbonyl (CO), carboxyl (–COOH), and alkoxy (C–O–C)).
Fig. 8 Adsorption of HMF over the different carbon supports. Conditions: 0.2 g HMF, 0.05 g n-tridecane, 25 °C, 20 mL 1-butanol, 0.1 g support, and 500 rpm.
In addition, the 2D plane structure and surface functional groups of g-C3N4 and rGO played a vital role in hydrogenation of HMF to DHMF. As shown in Fig. 5b, the XRD patterns of Pt/g-C3N4-IM and Pt/rGO-IM exhibited diffraction peaks at 32.2° and 30.9°, attributed to the (1 1 0) crystal plane of carbon nitride and (0 0 2) crystal plane of graphite-2H, respectively. It was reported that a flat structure is more conducive to the adsorption of HMF.55 Besides, the FT-IR spectra of Pt/g-C3N4-IM and Pt/rGO-IM provided another evidence of the existence of a graphite structure and g-C3N4 structure. As shown in Fig. 5a, the aromatic C–N (band at 1200–1650 cm−1) and triazine units (band at around 812 cm−1) over Pt/g-C3N4-IM were the characteristic components of g-C3N4. The functional groups C–H (band at around 2920 cm−1) and aromatic CC (band at around 1633 cm−1) over Pt/rGO-IM proved the existence of graphitic carbon. In contrast, the one-dimensional shape of CNTs played a negative role in HMF adsorption on the substrate. CNTs, which have the highest BET surface area and pore volume, showed a low activity due to the 1D inert CNT structure and some of the Pt NPs loading inside the CNTs, as observed by HRTEM (Fig. 3a). Moreover, the XRD spectrum of Pt/CNTs-IM (Fig. 5b) shows a weaker diffraction peak of the (0 0 2) crystal plane of graphite-2H than that of Pt/rGO-IM, indicating that there was less graphite carbon over Pt/CNTs-IM, and this could affect the catalytic performance of Pt/CNTs-IM.
As mentioned above, both the XPS analysis and FT-IR spectra of the Pt/BC-IM catalyst verified the existence of functional groups, such as –OH, –COOH,56 CO, and aromatic CC. These oxygen-containing functional groups could enhance the adsorption of HMF. In a previous report, the transfer of π-electrons from carbon support CC to metal sites could enhance the selectivity of CO.25 In addition, there was a large peak at 1080 cm−1, corresponding to alkoxyl C–O (1,080 cm−1),56 and the alkoxyl group could be considered to attract electrons, which is beneficial to adsorb HMF and enhance the activation of CO in HMF. In addition, the small amount of –COOH-released H+ could enhance the hydrogenation of CO in HMF. Thus, the functional groups played an important role in enhancing both the conversion of HMF and the selectivity to DHMF, resulting in a high DHMF yield of 90.1% for the Pt/BC-IM catalyst.
In order to figure out whether the reaction conditions dominantly affected the produced main product or not, a series of reactions under different reaction conditions, including temperature, H2 pressure, reaction time, and catalyst dose, were performed and the results are presented in the following section.
3.2.2. Effects of reaction conditions In this study, the Pt/BC-IM and Pt/CNTs-IM catalysts were used to study the effects of reaction conditions on HMF conversion and product distribution, since the highest and lowest yields of DHMF were obtained over these two catalysts. As shown in Fig. 9 and S7 and S8,† the conversion of HMF was 71.2% and the selectivity to DHMF increased to 96.9% at 140 °C over the Pt/BC-IM catalyst. A lower temperature was beneficial to the formation of DHMF from HMF but not conducive to activating HMF.57 When the temperature increased from 140 °C to 160 °C, the conversion of HMF reached 94.6% and the selectivity to DHMF reached 95.3%. As the reaction temperature further increased to 180 °C, the conversion of HMF increased to 96.4%, but the selectivity decreased to 88.1%. For the Pt/CNTs-IM catalyst, the conversion of HMF increased from 72.7% to 98.1% and the selectivity to DHMF decreased from 49.4% to 42.1%, when the temperature increased from 160 °C to 180 °C. The HMF conversion increased and the selectivity to DHMF decreased with the increase of the temperature for both catalysts, indicating that a high reaction temperature would accelerate the reaction process; however, the main product was still DHMF. At 180 °C, the selectivity to both DMF and other by-products increased for Pt/CNTs-IM. This implies that more side reactions occurred at high temperature, including ring-opening, dehydration, and hydrogenolysis reactions, which is consistent with a previous report.25
Fig. 9 Effects of reaction temperature on the conversion of HMF and selectivity to products. Reaction conditions: 0.5 g HMF, 0.05 g n-tridecane, 40 mL 1-butanol, 50 mg catalyst, 10 bar H2, 10 h, and 500 rpm.
10, 20, and 30 bar of H2 pressure were applied for the HMF hydrogenation reaction, and the results are presented in Fig. 10 and S9 and S10.† For the Pt/BC-IM catalyst, the HMF conversion increased along with the increase of H2 pressure, and it was as high as 98.1% at 30 bar of H2, while the selectivity to DHMF decreased to 79.6% due to the occurrence of more side reactions. In contrast, both the HMF conversion and DHMF selectivity increased over Pt/CNTs-IM with increasing reaction pressure from 10 bar to 30 bar. This could be explained by the fact that a high pressure was beneficial to dissolve H2 in the solvent, which could promote the hydrogenation of HMF and cause further hydrogenation to convert more by-products. In addition, when the reaction time was prolonged to 12 h, the selectivity to DHMF decreased and the selectivity to other by-products increased over the Pt/BC-IM catalyst (Fig. S11†). As presented in Fig. S12 and S13,† 50 mg and 100 mg of the Pt/BC-IM catalyst were adopted, and the by-products increased greatly when 100 mg of the catalyst was used. These results indicate that both prolonging the reaction time and increasing the catalyst amount could not promote the conversion of DHMF into DMF.
Fig. 10 Effects of H2 pressure on the conversion of HMF and selectivity to products. Reaction conditions: 0.5 g HMF, 0.05 g n-tridecane, 40 mL 1-butanol, 50 mg catalyst, 160 °C, 10 h, and 500 rpm.
When the reaction conditions became harsher (e.g., higher H2 pressure and temperature, higher catalyst dose, and longer reaction time), the main product was still DHMF and the DHMF to DMF hydrogenolysis reaction did not occur over the Pt catalysts prepared by the impregnation method, implying that the reaction pathway did not change via adjusting the reaction conditions, and the interaction between Pt NPs and supports is the dominant factor in determining the selectivity to HMF hydrogenation products.
3.2.3. Effects of metal–support interaction As discussed above, the main product was DHMF for all the carbon supported Pt catalysts prepared by the impregnation method under different reaction conditions. Thus, the reaction conditions are not the dominant factor in determining the main product. In other words, the reaction pathway and the formation of the main product depend on the properties of the catalysts, especially the interaction between Pt and supports. The main product was DHMF over the catalysts prepared by the impregnation method, which indicated that the catalysts prepared by the impregnation method had similar metal–support interactions. Herein, we prepared another Pt/CNTs-ALD catalyst via the ALD method to investigate the effect of the interaction between Pt and CNTs on the HMF hydrogenation reaction, since chemical bonds with strong binding force between Pt and CNTs are expected for the catalyst prepared by ALD.
As shown in Fig. 11a and S14,† the main product changed to DMF when the Pt/CNTs-ALD catalyst was applied, and a higher HMF conversion (100%) and selectivity to DMF (46.1%) were achieved in comparison with those using the Pt/CNTs-IM catalyst, which could be due to the different interactions between Pt and CNTs. As presented in Fig. 6a, the XPS spectrum of Pt for Pt/CNTs-ALD exhibited the 4f7/2 binding energy of Pt0 at around 71.9 eV, and that of the catalysts prepared by the impregnation method had a lower binding energy, indicating that there was a weak binding force between the Pt NPs and carbon supports. Meanwhile, the H2-TPR results were consistent with the XPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 6b, the H2-TPR spectra of Pt/CNTs-IM and Pt/CNTs-ALD exhibited weak peaks at around 550 °C and 600 °C, respectively, implying that the binding force between Pt and CNTs was stronger for the Pt/CNTs-ALD catalyst. Compared with that for Pt/CNTs-ALD, the Pt0 binding energy was lower for Pt/CNTs-IM, which could enhance electron transfer between the metal and supports. Instead, for the Pt/CNTs-ALD catalyst, the metal NPs and supports were linked by chemical bonding (Pt–O–support), and the electrons could transfer from Pt to O, which was verified by XPS analysis, thereby, leading to the decrease of electron density of the Pt NPs. It has been reported that reducing the metal electron density helps weaken binding with the reactant.58 Therefore, a low binding energy is beneficial to enhance the selectivity for CO hydrogenation,45 but it could reduce the adsorption of H2, which suppressed further DHMF hydrogenolysis reaction.59
Fig. 11 (a) Selective hydrogenation of HMF and (b) cycling tests of HMF hydrogenation over the Pt-based catalysts prepared by different methods. Reaction conditions: 0.5 g HMF, 0.05 g n-tridecane, 40 mL 1-butanol, 50 mg catalyst, 160 °C, 10 bar H2, and 500 rpm.
To better understand the factors affecting the yield of DMF, a PtNi/CNT-ALD catalyst was prepared. A higher loading of Pt NPs on CNTs was achieved by ALD, since one of the main by-products was DHMF (intermediate product) over the Pt/CNT-ALD catalyst and a high loading of Pt could improve the activity and DMF selectivity of the Pt–Ni/CNT-ALD bimetallic catalyst. The yield of DMF was as high as 93.4% over the PtNi/CNTs-ALD catalyst due to the synergistic effect between Pt and Ni, which was reported in a previous paper.60 The Pt XPS spectrum of PtNi/CNTs-ALD (Fig. 6a) shows that the peaks of Pt0 had a lower binding energy, compared to those of the Pt/CNTs-ALD catalyst, which implied that there was an electron transfer from Ni to Pt and the Pt NPs had a higher charge density in the PtNi/CNTs-ALD catalyst. The high charge density enhanced the adsorption of intermediate products and thereby promoted the selectivity to DMF,25 as presented in Fig. 12. Besides, the apparent peak of PtNi/CNTs-ALD was located at 435 °C in Fig. 6b, which was attributed to the reduction of NiOx species. It was reported that NiOx species could accept electrons as a Lewis acid center,61 which could enhance the activity for C–O hydrogenation and improve the selectivity to DMF. Although PtNi/CNTs-ALD had a higher loading of Pt, the TOF was low in comparison with that of Pt/CNTs-ALD. This indicates that Ni suppressed the high activity of the Pt catalysts, and the moderate activity could enhance the selectivity to DMF and avoid the occurrence of side reactions. A similar phenomenon was observed for Pt–Co/CNT catalysts prepared by ALD.25
Fig. 12 Proposed mechanism of selective hydrogenation of HMF over the (a) Pt/CNTs-IM, (b) Pt/CNTs-ALD, and (c) PtNi/CNTs-ALD catalysts.
Cycling tests of the CNT supported Pt and PtNi catalysts were performed to evaluate their stability. As shown in Fig. 11, after 3 test cycles, the HMF conversion and selectivity to DMF almost did not change over the Pt/CNTs-ALD catalyst, which were ∼100% and ∼47%, respectively, indicating its good stability. This could be due to the strong chemical bonding between Pt and CNTs, as we proved previously.62 In contrast, a noticeable decrease of HMF conversion was observed over the Pt/CNTs-IM catalyst, implying the leaching of Pt NPs during the reaction and the weak interaction between Pt and CNTs, which was verified by the ICP analysis. In addition, after the second cycling test, the selectivity to DMF significantly decreased over the PtNi/CNTs-ALD catalyst, though the HMF conversion was still 100%, which could be attributed to the leaching of Ni NPs. Based on the ICP-AES analysis, the Ni loading decreased from 1.5 wt% to 0.9 wt% after the cycling tests. As shown in Fig. S15,† compared to that in the first cycling test, complete HMF conversion was reached in a shorter time in the second cycling test. This implied that Ni suppressed the activity of the Pt/CNTs-ALD catalyst, and the leaching of Ni NPs enhanced the activity of the PtNi/CNTs-ALD catalyst. Enhancement of the stability of the PtNi/CNTs-ALD catalyst is being pursued by our group.
4. Conclusions
A series of Pt catalysts supported on various carbon materials were prepared by the impregnation method or ALD with a similar Pt loading and particle size. DHMF was the main product over all the Pt catalysts prepared by the impregnation method, and the Pt/BC-IM catalyst showed the highest yield of DHMF (90.1%) owing to the abundant surface functional groups of BC. Compared with that over the Pt/CNTs-IM catalyst, the reaction pathway was altered and the main product was DMF with a yield of 46.1% over Pt/CNTs-ALD due to the strong interaction between Pt and CNTs. Thus, the interaction between Pt and carbon supports determined the reaction pathway and main product in the HMF hydrogenation reaction. After depositing Ni NPs on the Pt/CNTs-ALD catalyst by ALD, the yield of DMF increased to 93.4% with complete HMF conversion over the PtNi/CNTs-ALD bimetallic catalyst attributed to the synergistic effects between Pt and Ni NPs.

4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
