 Based on the analysis of the provided document, it does not appear to discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document focuses on the catalytic hydrogenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to products like 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF). As such, I have indicated this is not relevant to propane dehydrogenation in the output.
