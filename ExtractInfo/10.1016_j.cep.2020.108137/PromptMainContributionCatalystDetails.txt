1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important building blocks in the synthesis of a wide range of chemicals [1,2]. With the further development of the downstream market of propylene, its demand keeps growing. For now, the fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking of naphtha are the two main processes to produce propylene [3]. However, their main products are gasoline and ethylene, respectively, and the propylene is only a by-product. Moreover, after several decades of development and optimization, the propylene yield of these processes cannot be significantly improved any more [4]. Considering the rapid growth of propylene demand, the urgent need for a dedicated efficient propylene production process becomes apparent.
Recently, the development and expansion of the shale gas industry makes propane to propylene processes attract more and more attention. Among those propane to propylene processes, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP), which co-feeds gaseous oxygen and propane, has been studied extensively since it can proceed in a spontaneous pathway [[5], [6], [7], [8]]. However, in this process, the existence of gaseous oxygen can lead to the deep-oxidation of propane, which reduces the propylene yield [9]. In addition, the requirement of costly air separation units limits the widespread use of the ODHP process. Also the security of co-feeding propane and gaseous oxygen is a big issue that needs to be taken into consideration.
Chemical looping technology can decompose a chemical reaction into several sub-reactions by using a solid carrier for a certain element, viz. oxygen, hydrogen or nitrogen, needed by the reaction [10]. Among the solid carriers, the oxygen carriers, which donate lattice oxygen for a reduction reaction and absorb oxygen from air, are widely used in gasification, reforming, air separation and combustion, amongst many other proposed applications [11]. In order to overcome the shortcomings caused by the application of gaseous oxygen in ODHP, chemical looping technology can be applied into the ODHP process, which is then called chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CL-ODHP) [[12], [13], [14], [15], [16]]. Fig. 1 shows a schematic picture of the CL-ODHP process; propane is partially oxidized by lattice oxygen from a solid oxygen carrier in the dehydrogenation reactor, after which the oxygen carrier is re-oxidized by air in the regenerator. The heat that is produced by the oxidation step can in turn be supplied to the dehydrogenation reactor, which reduces the total energy consumption of the process. The use of an oxygen carrier avoids direct contact of propane with gaseous oxygen, and thus can overcome the shortcomings the conventional ODHP processes.

Like other chemical looping processes, the stability and performance of the oxygen carrier is the most important aspect that critically determines the process technical feasibility [17,10,18]. Because of their promising properties and reactivity performance, perovskites and metal oxides have been reported as suitable oxygen carriers for chemical looping processes [10,18]. Meanwhile, metal oxides are well known active materials as redox catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes [19,20]. Fukudome et al. used a propane temperature programmed reaction method to investigate the ODHP performance of different metal oxides (NiO, Co3O4, Fe2O3 and V2O5), and found that the V-based catalyst can perform the ODHP reaction at a lower temperature than the direct dehydrogenation or cracking of propane [9]. It is widely known that sepiolite or alumina supported vanadium redox catalysts have a good performance in ODHP processes and are active at a lower temperature (623−673 K) than other redox catalysts [21,22]. Meanwhile, the V-based catalyst is also a common catalyst used in oxidative dehydrogenation of other alkanes (like ethane and butane) [19,20]. The Ga-based catalyst has been regarded as a new promising catalyst in many processes, like oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, selective catalytic reduction of NOx and acylation reactions [[23], [24], [25]]. Several studies have indicated that the Ga-based have a good catalytic performance in oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane process [4,5,26,27], while also the Mo-based catalyst is also an important catalyst here [28]. Molybdenum oxides supported on various supports are regarded as the promising ODHP catalysts [29].
Obviously, different metal oxides have their own properties, and thus exhibit a specific catalytic performance of the ODHP reaction. Various studies on the use of ODHP catalysts have indicated that many metal oxides, like Ga, Mo and V have a good catalytic performance in the ODHP process [26,27,29]. However, in the CL-ODHP process, the metal oxide not only acts as a catalyst but also performs the role as an oxygen carrier, delivering oxygen from the regenerator to the dehydrogenation reactor. The properties of an oxygen carrier used for CL-ODHP should include: (1) high reactivity and ability to catalyze the ODHP reaction, (2) adequate oxygen capacity, (3) high selectivity for propylene, (4) high anti-sintering ability, (5) sufficient mechanical strength, (6) high redox thermal stability and (7) environmentally friendly. Among them, the propane oxidative dehydrogenation under gas free oxygen conditions and the oxygen absorption rate from air to regenerate the reduced oxygen carrier are the most important properties for an oxygen carrier used in CL-ODHP. Some researchers have investigated the ODHP step using lattice oxygen, but detailed research on the oxidation step of the reduced solid is still very scarce [31,32]. For the CL-ODHP process, the ODHP step and oxidation step for the reduced oxygen carrier are equally important and both of them need to be investigated in detail.
In this study, a series of different oxygen carriers are prepared by impregnation, using three metal oxides (V, Ga, and Mo) supported on Al2O3. The oxygen carriers are characterized by several technologies, like thermogravimetric analysis, H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and O2 temperature programmed oxidation (O2-TPO), to obtain information about the thermal stability and redox properties of different oxygen carriers. Also, N2 adsorption, XRD and SEM-EDX measurements are conducted to determine the morphological properties. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and oxidation reactions tests are performed in a fixed-bed reactor. This paper proves the technical feasibility of CL-ODHP by experiment and aims to find the best oxygen carrier, which can complete the whole oxidation-reduction cycle between the two reactors and shows a satisfactory reactivity performance in the reactors, among the prepared Ga-based, Mo-based and V-based oxygen carriers, so that a detailed, dedicated, investigation of the best oxygen carrier can be carried out in the near future.
2. Experimental
2.1. Oxygen carriers preparation
The oxygen carriers used in this paper were prepared by impregnation. For each oxygen carrier, the active metal oxide loading is approximately 10 wt.%. The active materials precursors ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, Ga(NO3)3·xH2O, NH4VO3, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in deionized water and then mixed uniformly with the γ-Al2O3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 199974-1KG, activated, neutral, Brockmann) support. The mixtures were stirred at 80 °C until most of the water was evaporated. The residues then were calcined in an oven in air: first the temperature was ramped to 450 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min and then kept constant for 4 h; after that the temperature was ramped to 850 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min and again held constant for 4 h to enhance the mechanical strength of the oxygen carriers. After calcination, the oxygen carriers were allowed to cool down to room temperature in the oven. Lastly, using a mortar, pestle and sieves the products were processed to obtain the oxygen carrier with 75−105 μm particle size.
2.2. Oxygen carriers characterization
Phase identification of the oxygen carriers were carried out with a Powder X-Ray Diffraction (Rigaku MiniFlex 600 diffractometer operating with a Cu Cu-Kα anode at 40 kV and 15 mA). A scanning range of 10 to 90° (2θ) with a step rate of 0.4°/min was used to obtain the XRD patterns.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate the oxygen carrier particles structure and surface topography by a Phenom ProX. Moreover, energy dispersive spectrometry (EDX) was used to investigate the elements distribution by the same system as the SEM at 15 kV.
The surface area of the oxygen carriers and Al2O3 support were measured based on the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method on a Micromeritics TriStar II. Before these measurements took place, the samples were degassed at 100 °C under N2 conditions for 4 h. The measurements were performed at 77 K using N2 as the adsorbent gas.
2.3. Thermogravimetric analysis
Both a temperature programming method and isothermal method were performed to investigate the redox performance of oxygen carriers. Before the experiments took place, about 50 mg of fresh oxygen carrier was loaded into the thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) which was subsequently heated to 850 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min in air, in order to maintain the oxidized sites in the oxygen carrier.
For the temperature programming method, the oxygen carrier was heated from 150 °C to 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min in a 10 % H2/90 % N2 environment to reduce the oxygen carrier. The reduced oxygen carrier was heated from 150 °C to 850 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min in a 10 % air/90 % N2 environment to re-oxidize oxygen carrier.
Before performing the isothermal TGA method, the oxygen carrier was heated to the reducing temperature in a pure N2 environment, after which the gas flow was switched to 10 % H2/90 % N2 to reduce the oxygen carrier. After the reduction reaction, the temperature was changed to the oxidation temperature, again in a pure N2 environment, followed by switching the gas flow to air to re-oxidize the oxygen carrier. Based on the results of isothermal TGA, the oxygen capacity and redox stability can be determined.
2.4. Reactivity test
The reactivity tests of the oxygen carriers were carried out using a packed bed reactor which has a 14 mm outer diameter and a 10 mm inner diameter. 1.0 g oxygen carrier particles were loaded in the packed bed reactor. Quartz particles (16 mesh) were loaded on each side of the oxygen carrier particles. The packed bed reactor was heated using a temperature-controlled tube oven and there were two thermocouples placed in the reactor to measure the reaction temperature. Mass flow controllers were used to control the gas flow into reactor. The pressure for reactivity test is 1.3 bar.
To test the reactivity of the 3 oxygen carriers, the ODHP reaction and oxidation were performed in the reactor. During the ODHP step, 50 % propane balanced with N2 (total flow was 40 mL/min) was fed into the reactor. After the ODHP step the reduced oxygen carriers were re-oxidized by 40 mL/min air. For the oxidation, the oxygen carrier was first fully reduced by 10 % H2 balanced with N2 (total flow was 40 mL/min), and then 40 mL/min air was fed into the reactor to regeneration the reduced oxygen carrier. The 100 % N2 was used to purge the reactor before and after ODHP and oxidation steps.
The products of the ODHP and oxidation reactions were analyzed by a micro gas chromatography system (Agilent 490 Micro GC system) equipped with a TCD detector.
The propane conversion can be calculated by the following equation:

Where C3H8in is the amount of propane fed into the reactor and C3H8out is the amount of propane came out from the reactor.
The selectivity is calculated by the following equation:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Oxygen carrier characterization
The XRD patterns of the three oxygen carriers together with Al2O3 support are depicted in Fig. 2. The XRD patterns of the bare Al2O3 support shows the break peaks in the 2θ ranges of 35−50° and 65−70° indicating the poor crystalline morphology of the alumina. The Ga-based oxygen carrier shows the almost same XRD pattern with Al2O3 support. However, the loading of molybdenum and vanadium induce the Al2O3 support to change to a more crystalline structure with a rapid drop in surface areas (136.60 m2/g vs. 4.32 m2/g and 1.92 m2/g), which also makes the peaks in XRD patterns become sharp and intensive. This is caused by the differences in melting points of the active metal oxides (for V2O5 the melting point is 690 °C, for MoO3 795 °C and Ga2O3 1900 °C), after low temperature calcination (450 °C), the active materials precursors, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, Ga(NO3)3·xH2O and NH4VO3, will become MoO3, Ga2O3 and V2O5. In order to enhance the mechanical strength of the oxygen carriers, a high-temperature calcination (850 °C) needs to be performed. During the high-temperature calcination, V2O5 and MoO3 melt on the alumina support, whereas Ga2O3 will not, which makes the Ga-based oxygen carrier behave differently compared to the V-based and Mo-based oxygen carriers.

Fig. 2. XRD patterns of Al2O3 support and Ga-based, Mo-based and V-based oxygen carriers.
Meanwhile, it can be seen from Fig. 2 that there is no obvious peak of active metal oxide (Ga2O3) in the XRD results of the Ga-based oxygen carrier, and when comparing the peaks of Al2O3. This is mainly because the low active metal oxide loading (10 wt.%) and good distribution on the Al2O3 support, which causes that their concentration on the support surface and/or particle size is below the XRD detection limit [2,4,19]. For the Mo-based and V-based oxygen carriers, the peaks of active metal oxides (MoO3 and V2O5) can be seen in the XRD patterns, and the peaks of chemical compounds of active metal oxides and Al2O3 support cannot be found in the XRD patterns, which means the active materials do not react with the Al2O3 support during the preparation.
The BET surface area of the Ga-based oxygen carrier slightly decreases compared to the sole Al2O3 support (136.50 m2/g for Al2O3 support, 104.90 m2/g for Ga-based oxygen carrier). However, the BET surface areas of Mo-based and V-based oxygen carriers are 4.30 m2/g and 1.92 m2/g, respectively, which are much smaller than the Al2O3 support. The rapid decrease of surface areas for Mo-based and V-based is due to the blockage of Al2O3 support pores by VOx and MoOx [19]. When compared to the other supported Mo-based and V-based catalysts used in ODHP, the surface areas of Mo-based and V-based oxygen carriers are smaller [29,30,33]. But as an oxygen carrier, the oxide activity always shows more association with internal oxygen transport ability than surface, and such surface areas are very common for oxygen carrier used in chemical looping technologies [34,35].
Fig. 3 shows the morphology and element distribution of Al2O3 support and the Ga-based, Mo-based and V-based oxygen carriers. It can be observed that the size and structure of the particles do not change during the preparation process. All the oxygen carrier particles show similar particle sizes and structures with the untreated Al2O3 support. But when focused on the particles surface of the three oxygen carriers, a lot of differences can be seen. The particle surface morphology of the Ga-based oxygen carrier is similar with Al2O3 support and is much smoother compared to the Mo-based and V-based oxygen carriers. For the Mo-based oxygen carrier, there are many holes on the particle surface and making the particles look like a sponge. There are some bright spots on the particle surface which are identified as the MoOx species. For the V-based oxygen carrier, the particle surface is covered with needle-like VOx species, and similar results can also be seen in V-based catalysts [3,36]. These SEM investigations can also explain the XRD patterns of Mo-based and V-based oxygen carriers unlike Ga-based oxygen carrier and Al2O3 support. The EDX element maps of three different oxygen carriers are illustrated alongside the SEM results in Fig. 3. There are no particular rich regions (hot spots) of the active material elements, nor are any aluminum rich regions observed from the EDX images. Moreover, the active material elements are always found together with the Al2O3 support. We conclude that, for the prepared oxygen carriers, the active materials species are well distributed on the Al2O3 support. This result of SEM-EDX corresponds with the XRD results that the active metal oxide of Ga-based oxygen carrier cannot be detected clearly, while the peaks of active metal oxides for Mo-based and V-based oxygen carriers can be seen in XRD patterns.

Fig. 4 shows the Ga-based, Mo-based and V-based oxygen carriers H2-TPR/O2-TPO profiles for reduction and oxidation. As shown in Fig. 4(a), all the oxygen carriers show reduction peaks which are related to their metal oxide species. However, there are some differences between these three oxygen carriers. The Ga-based oxygen carrier has a wide reduction peak at about 540 °C, which is ascribed to the well-dispersed reducible Ga species on the support, like micro Ga2O3 particles [4]. This result is in line with XRD and EDX results, and underlines once more that the Ga species was dispersed very well on the support. However, the lower reduction peak indicates the Ga-based oxygen carrier is very hard to reduce by H2 in the explored temperature range [[37], [38], [39]]. It can also be seen in the isothermal TGA profiles (Fig. 5(a)), the mass change of Ga-based oxygen carrier is much smaller than Mo-based and V-based oxygen carriers.

Fig. 5. Isothermal TGA of redox cycles (a)Ga-based, (b)Mo-based, (c)V-based.
The Mo-based oxygen carrier has a reduction peak at the temperature range of 400−550 °C which is ascribed to the reduction of Mo6+ to Mo4+ [40]. This is due to the multilayered MoO3 in octahedral coordination and tetrahedral coordinated Mo6+ ions in the crystalline MoO3 phase reductions [32]. Meanwhile, it can be seen from Fig. 4(a) that the reduction rate of Mo-based oxygen carrier increases again when the temperature is increased above 600 °C, which can be interpreted as multiple reducible Mo species on the Al2O3 support [29].
Finally, the V-based oxygen carrier only displays one obvious reduction peak in the studied temperature range, which is corresponding to polymeric vanadium species [41]. Meanwhile, from Fig. 4, Fig. 5, it can be seen that the V-based oxygen carrier has the strongest reduction peak in H2-TPR and largest weight change in redox cycles, which indicates that it can be reduced by H2 more easily than Ga- and Mo-based oxygen carriers. Thus, the order of reducibility for the three oxygen carriers is V-based > Mo-based > Ga-based.
For the CL-ODHP process in particular, the oxidation of the oxygen carrier is equally important to the reduction, as it affects the efficiency of oxygen transport between dehydrogenation reactor and regenerator. It can be seen from Fig. 4(b) that the Ga-based oxygen carrier also shows a wider and lower oxidation peak (485 °C) than Mo-based and V-based based oxygen carriers, which indicates that the Ga-based oxygen carrier is also difficult to re-oxidize by O2. The Mo-based oxygen carrier gives two oxidation peaks at around 290 and 340 °C, and the V-based oxygen carrier also shows two oxidation peaks (385 and 435 °C). That means during the oxidation, both Mo-based and V-based based oxygen carriers have formed the intermediate products [42,43]. And based on oxidation peaks of Mo-based and V-based oxygen carriers and their weight change in redox cycles, it can be concluded that V-based oxygen carriers can be re-oxidized by O2 more easily than the Mo-based oxygen carrier. Thus, the order of oxidation capacity of the three oxygen carriers is V-based > Mo-based > Ga-based.
The quantitative TGA results is summarized in Table 1. It can be concluded that the V-based oxygen carrier has much better redox abilities and oxygen transport capacities compared to the other two oxygen carriers under investigation.

3.2. Reactivity of oxygen carriers
3.2.1. ODHP performance
Fig. 6 shows the propane conversion and product selectivities of the Ga-based oxygen carrier as a function of time at different temperatures. It can be seen from Fig. 6(a) that the initial propane conversions at the studied temperatures are the highest and then decrease with time. The initial propane conversions of Ga-based oxygen carrier at 490 °C, 540 °C and 590 °C are 6.97 %, 7.97 % and 9.69 % and then decrease to 0.82 %, 1.53 % and 3.27 %, respectively. Meanwhile, from Fig. 6(b) and (c), it can be seen that the propylene selectivity increases with time while the COx selectivities decrease. The variation of the propane conversions and products selectivities with time for Ga-based oxygen carrier can be explained as follows; the Ga-based oxygen carrier or Ga supported catalyst usually have three kinds of active sites on the particle surface: micro Ga2O3, well dispersed Ga species and GaO+ [44,45]. Between those active sites, the well dispersed Ga species and GaO+ usually have higher selectivity towards propylene, while the micro Ga2O3 is the main reason for high propane conversion. However, the latter leads to poor propylene formation, as selectivity more COx are formed [44]. During the oxidative dehydrogenation, the reducible Ga2O3 is reduced to Gaδ+(δ<2) and GaO+ which all show the high selectivity to propylene [4,44,45]. Thus over time, the system stabilizes as propane conversions and COx selectivities decrease while propylene selectivities increase.

Fig. 7, Fig. 8 show the propane conversions and product selectivities for Mo-based and V-based oxygen carriers, respectively. The propane conversions and product selectivities of Mo-based and V-based oxygen carriers show the same tendency with the Ga-based oxygen carriers the propane conversions and COx selectivities first decline drastically and then stabilize gradually. The propylene selectivities first increase and then converge to a stable value. The decrease of the propane conversion and COx selectivities are mainly because of the consumption of lattice oxygen in the Mo-based and V-based oxygen carriers. Moreover, for the three oxygen carriers, the nonselective surface oxygen species in the fully oxidized oxygen carrier can promote the deep oxidation of propane and propylene to COx [46,47]. As the reactions take place, those nonselective surface oxygen species are consumed. That is why the propylene selectivities are low in the initial stage but increase in the following stage. The non-selective surface oxygen species in the oxygen carriers are formed by the weakly bounded lattice oxygen and the adsorbed oxygen from the regeneration reaction.

Meanwhile, it can be also be seen from Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8 that the propane conversions increase with the temperature while the propylene and COx selectivities decrease. It is because of that with the temperature increase, the cracking reactions of propane and propylene would be become more intense. That is to say, the propane and propylene will be more likely to convert to C1, C2 and carbon at higher temperatures. Moreover, the propane and propylene combustion reactions are exothermal reactions, higher temperature will prevent those reactions from occurring. That is why the COx selectivity decreases with the temperature increasing. In a self-stabilizing fashion, the increase of cracking products at higher temperatures could decrease the COx selectivity.
Fig. 9 shows the comparison of reactivity performance for the three oxygen carriers, each at their own preferred temperature based on the TGA results and their reactivity performance. As shown in Fig. 9(a), when the oxygen carrier is fully oxidized, the initial propane conversion of Mo-based oxygen carrier is much higher than Ga-based and V-based oxygen carriers. However, the Mo-based oxygen carrier also shows the worst stability among the three oxygen carriers. After 6 min, the propane conversion of three oxygen carriers is in the following order: V-based > Mo-based > Ga-based. From Fig. 9(b) and (c), it can be seen that the V-based oxygen carrier shows the higher selectivity of propylene and COx than Ga-based and Mo-based oxygen carriers throughout the testing period. It also has a higher propylene yield than the other two oxygen carriers (Fig. 9(d)). For Ga-based and Mo-based oxygen carriers, the Ga-based oxygen carrier shows a lower propylene selectivity than the Mo-based oxygen carrier at the initial stage, because the surface area of the Ga-based oxygen carrier is larger than the Mo-based oxygen carrier, which can adsorb more oxygen on the particle surface after the regeneration reaction. Thee adsorbed oxygen can lead to more propane and propylene combustion to form COx. After the adsorbed oxygen on the particle surface is exhausted, the Ga-based oxygen carrier shows a higher propylene selectivity compared to the Mo-based oxygen carrier. The Ga-based oxygen carrier also shows the lowest COx selectivity among the three oxygen carriers throughout the testing period.

Fig. 9. The comparison of the reactivity performance for the three oxygen carriers: (a) Propane conversion, (b) Propylene selectivity, (c) COx selectivity, (d) Propylene yield.
Based on the TGA results, it can be seen from Fig. 9 that the order of propane conversion and COx selectivity for three oxygen carriers are the same as their reducibility. Thus, among the three oxygen carriers, the V-based oxygen carrier shows both a good oxygen carrier capacity and a good catalytic ODHP performance, while the Ga-based oxygen carrier only shows a good catalytic performance.
The cracking products (C2H6, C2H4, CH4 and C) distribution of three oxygen carriers during the ODHP step can be found in the Fig. 10. As the Fig. 10 show, for three oxygen carriers, the selectivity to C2H6 is higher than other cracking products (C2H4, CH4 and C). And for the Ga-based and Mo-based oxygen carriers, the selectivity to C2H6 is even higher than C3H6, which is not benefit for propylene production. Meanwhile, the selectivity to carbon of Ga-based and Mo-based oxygen carriers is also higher than V-based oxygen carrier. In total, the selectivities to cracking products of the Ga-based and Mo-based oxygen carriers are higher than of the V-based oxygen carrier, which makes them less suitable for CL-ODHP.

3.2.2. Oxidation performance
Fig. 11 shows the changes of the outlet oxygen concentrations of the three oxygen carriers as a function of time at different temperatures during the oxidation step. Because there is carbon deposition in the reactor after the ODHP reaction, and the carbon will be combusted during regeneration, which will also consume oxygen. When oxygen carriers are directly regenerated after ODHP reaction, the results can not directly reflect the oxidation ability of the oxygen carriers. Therefore, in order to eliminate the effect of carbon combustion during the regeneration and investigate the oxidation performance of reduced oxygen carriers in the fixed bed reactor, the oxygen carrier is first reduced by H2. The blank experiment is performed at room temperature. When the inlet gas changes from N2 to air, there is an increasing tendency of the outlet oxygen concentration even at room temperature. Fig. 11(a)–(c) show the outlet oxygen concentration during the oxidation step for Ga-based, Mo-based and V-based oxygen carriers, respectively. For the three oxygen carriers at the studied temperatures, the outlet oxygen concentrations are at a low level in the initial stage of the oxidation step, which means a rapid oxygen adsorption. After the initial stage, the outlet oxygen concentrations can increase to about 21 %, which indicates that all the reduced oxygen carriers can be re-oxidized again by air easily. Meanwhile, it can be seen from Fig. 11(a)–(c) that the time needed for the full re-oxidation decreases with increasing temperature. It is because of that, that the equilibrium oxygen concentrations of the three oxygen carriers are all much smaller than 21 % at the studied temperatures, the oxidation reactions for the three oxygen carriers are all temperature dependent reactions. Thus, the oxidation reaction rates for the three oxygen carriers are increasing with the temperature.

Fig. 11(d) shows the comparison of oxidation performance for the three oxygen carriers. It can be seen from Fig. 11(d) that the initial outlet oxygen concentration of V-based oxygen carrier is much smaller than the other two oxygen carriers. Meanwhile, the V-based oxygen carrier needs a longer time to reach to the fully oxidized state. That is to say the V-based can adsorb more oxygen from the air than the other two oxygen carriers. From Fig. 11(d), it can be seen that the Ga-based oxygen carrier adsorbs the least amount of oxygen from air. The results of oxidation performance for the three oxygen carriers is correspondence with the TGA result.
4. Conclusion
In this paper, Ga-based, Mo-based and V-based oxygen carriers supported on Al2O3 for the chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation of propane were prepared by incipient wet impregnation. The physical and chemical properties as well as the reactivity performance of these three oxygen carriers were investigated and compared. The technical feasibility of CL-ODHP is experimentally demonstrated in this paper. The main conclusions are formulated as follows: Because of high temperature calcination, the morphological properties of Mo-based and V-based oxygen carriers are different from the Al2O3 support and the Ga-based oxygen carrier. The V-based oxygen carrier exhibits a higher redox ability and oxygen transport capacity than the Ga-based and Mo-based oxygen carriers. All the studied oxygen carriers show a good stability over many redox cycles. The V-based oxygen carrier also shows a better performance in the reactivity test, which shows a higher propane conversion and propylene selectivity in the ODHP step and a faster regeneration rate than the Ga-based and Mo-based oxygen carriers. Therefore, it is concluded that the V-based oxygen carrier is more suitable for CL-ODHP than Ga-based and Mo-based oxygen carriers. The reaction temperature will affect the reactivity performance to a large extent, and with increasing temperature, the propane conversion increases while the propylene selectivity decreases in the ODHP step, whereas the time needed for full re-oxidation decreases with increasing reaction temperature in regeneration step.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
