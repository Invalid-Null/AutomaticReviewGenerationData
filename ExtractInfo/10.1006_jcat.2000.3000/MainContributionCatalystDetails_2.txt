The provided document does not seem to be relevant, as it does not pertain to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically for converting propane to propylene. The document discusses reactions of propane over Mo2C catalysts in general, including aromatization reactions, rather than focusing on PDH or ODH to produce propylene.
