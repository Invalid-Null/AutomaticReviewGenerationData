The given document discusses oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes like ethane, propane, butane etc. on vanadium oxide-based catalysts. It does not specifically discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. Since the document is not relevant to PDH or ODH of propane, I have indicated "No" for relevance and did not include any catalyst details or performance enhancements.
