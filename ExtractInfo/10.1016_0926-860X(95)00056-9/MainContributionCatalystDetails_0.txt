The given document discusses oxidative dehydrogenation of lower alkanes, specifically C2-C5 alkanes, on vanadium oxide-based catalysts. It does not mention propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. Therefore, this document does not seem directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation to propylene.
