CO2 methanation over γ-Al2O3 nanosheets-stabilized Ni catalysts: Effects of MnOx and MoOx additives on catalytic performance and reaction pathway
With 5 nm Ni nanoparticles anchored by the nanosheet-shaped γ-Al2O3 supports, a ~10 wt% Ni/Al2O3 catalyst displayed ca. 45% conversion and >98% CH4 selectivity in CO2 methanation reaction at 300 °C for 450 h. Benefited from stable interfaces between Ni sites and highly dispersed MnOx promoters on Al2O3, a modified Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited 93–88% conversions, >99.9% selectivity and great stability in 1100 h reaction. As a contrast, a Mo-modified Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst showed severe deactivation with declined conversions from >80 to 50% within initial 20 h. The high-dispersion MoOx species in the fresh catalyst occurred aggregation and reduction during the reaction, reconstructing the Ni-support interfaces. As clarified by in-situ DRIFT spectra, the COads-mediated hydrogenation reaction pathway was followed on these Ni catalysts via sequential steps, CO2 → bicarbonates → bidentate carbonates → bidentate formates → COads → CH4. Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited significantly high and well-matched reaction rates in overall steps, whereas Ni/Al2O3 catalyst showed low activities in key steps of formate decomposition and COads methanation. Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst displayed superior ability for CO2 dissociation into bicarbonates, and nonetheless, it could not steadily achieve the formation and hydrogenation of COads species, allowing the inactive surface species to be accumulated and to induce the catalyst structural change for deactivation.
1. Introduction
Methanation (Sabatier) reaction converts carbon dioxide (CO2) into methane (CH4), serving as one of the efficient routes to recycle the C1 feedstocks [1], [2], [3]. The produced synthetic natural gas (SNG) with a relatively high energy density can be interconnected with the existing gas network, acting as fuel directly or as energy source to generate electricity in power plants. Methanation is the most favorable process in the thermodynamics for CO2 hydrogenation in comparison with the processes to produce other hydrocarbons, alcohols or acids [4]. Therefore, unremitting efforts have been focused on the development of the CO2 methanation catalysts with high intrinsic activity and long-term stability from academic and industrial communities. Among the investigated transition metals-based catalysts, the noble metal catalysts (such as Ru, Rh and Ir) exhibit the greatest low-temperature activity, and nonetheless, the relatively high cost limits their large-scale application [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. The non-noble metal Ni-based catalysts are the more cost-effective candidates suitable for the industrial application [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. The active Ni sites highly dispersed on the supports afford comparable catalytic activity, whereas they prefer to occur self-sintering irreversibly as well as to induce the deposition of coke species, causing the deactivation issue of the Ni catalysts.
The Al2O3-based supports have been widely adopted in the Ni-based methanation catalysts due to their advanced structure features as well as the good adjustability [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. By optimizing the synthesis methods, the morphology, pore structure and surface basicity of Al2O3 supports can be well regulated, and therefore improve the dispersion degree of Ni atoms and the anti-sintering stability. For instance, the γ-Al2O3 surfaces with coordinatively unsaturated pentacoordinate Al3+ sites can anchor the metallic atoms by strong interaction, allowing the metals to be catalytically active and structurally stabilized in the heterogeneous catalysis reactions [27], [28], [29], [30]. Furthermore, the addition of the promoters, such as the second metal and metal oxide, is also an effective strategy to optimally tune the properties of the interfaces between the active metal sites and the Al2O3-based supports in terms of electronic and geometric modifications [31], [32], [33], [34]. These modified Ni-support interface sites can regulate the bonding configurations and strengths of the relevant intermediate species as well as the reaction rates for their formation and transformation, even selecting the reaction pathway of the CO2 methanation (i.e., formate or CO hydrogenation, as the commonly accepted pathway) [35], [36]. The COads species chemisorbed on the Ni sites are the key intermediates for the CO hydrogenation pathway, and their bonding strength and hydrogenation reactivity determine the catalytic selectivity, methanation into CH4 or reverse water-gas shift (rWGS) into CO [37], [38], [39]. On the other hand, the strongly bonded COads species also possibly cause poisoning or sintering of the active Ni sites through supersaturation of the formed Ni(CO)x species [40]. Therefore, to improve the overall performances of the Ni catalysts with respect to the activity, selectivity and stability, either the interface structure control for the supported Ni catalysts or the reaction mechanism understanding on the Ni-catalyzed CO2 methanation reaction is necessary.
In this work, focusing on the Al2O3-supported Ni nanoparticle catalysts for CO2 methanation reaction, we choose the nanosheet-shaped γ-Al2O3 with high-density Al3+penta sites as the support for stabilizing the metallic Ni sites, and further introduce the transition metal oxide-based promoter additives to modify the structure and property of the Ni-support interfaces. These Ni catalysts with tailored interfaces are carefully characterized and evaluated to establish the relationships between the structural stability and the catalytic performance. The in-situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectral analyses are also performed to explore the hydrogenation reaction mechanism and pathways.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The γ-Al2O3 nanosheet support was synthesized by a hydrothermal method. In a typical synthesis procedure, 6.44 g of aluminium nitrate (Al(NO3)3·9H2O) and 9.4 g of urea (CO(NH2)2) were dissolved in deionized water under magnetic stirring for 25 min. The solution with ~3.8 pH value was then placed in a 200 mL Teflon-lined stainless autoclave and maintained at 100 °C for 48 h. After air-cooling to room temperature, the white precipitate was filtered and washed with deionized water and anhydrous ethanol several times and then dried at 80 °C overnight. Finally, the γ-Al2O3 nanosheets were obtained by calcination of the powder in air at 600 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 1 °C/min.
Using nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), manganese nitrate tetrahydrate (Mn(NO3)2·4H2O), hexaammonium molybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O), ammonium paratungstate ((NH4)10W12O41·xH2O) and ferric chloride hexahydrate (FeCl3·6H2O) as the precursor salts, an incipient co-impregnation method was used to prepare the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet supported Ni and Ni-M (M=Mn, Mo, Fe, W) catalysts. The expected metal loading amount was 10 wt% for Ni, 4 wt% for Mn and Fe, 2 wt% for Mo and W, respectively. For example of Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst, 330 mg of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was diluted in 1 mL ethanol, while 114 mg of Mn(NO3)2·4H2O was diluted in 500 μL of ultrapure water. The solutions were impregnated into 0.6 g of the Al2O3 support. The mixture was maintained at room temperature for 10 h and then dried at 70 °C for 10 h. The sample was calcinated in air at 350 °C for 4 h and then reduced in 15 vol% H2/N2 (30 mL/min) at 500 °C for 2 h. The obtained catalysts were named as Ni/Al2O3 and Ni-M/Al2O3 (M=Mn, Mo, Fe, W). As the reference samples, Mo/Al2O3 and Mn/Al2O3 with similar metal loading amounts were also prepared by incipient impregnation method.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
An inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, 720ES, Agilent) was used to analyze the metal loading amounts of the catalysts. The actual Ni loading amount was 9.4, 8.8, 9.6, 9.0 and 9.2 wt% for Ni/Al2O3, Ni-Mn/Al2O3, Ni-Mo/Al2O3, Ni-W/Al2O3 and Ni-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst, respectively. The loading amount of the metal additive (M) was 3.6 wt% (Mn), 1.8 wt% (Mo), 1.6 wt% (W) and 3.6 wt% (Fe) for Ni-Mn/Al2O3, Ni-Mo/Al2O3, Ni-W/Al2O3 and Ni-Fe/Al2O3 catalyst, respectively. The detailed loading values of Ni/Al2O3, Ni-Mn/Al2O3 and Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalysts were summarized in Table 1 and Table S1.

N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured by a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 instrument operated at –196 °C. Before the N2 physisorption, the catalyst was degassed at 300 °C for 5 h in vacuum. The specific surface area value was calculated using Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method in the partial pressure range of 0.05–0.35, while the pore information was obtained using Barret-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance A25 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm), while the accelerating voltage and current were 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was carried out on a JEOL JEM 2100 F system operated at 200 kV. Thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted on a Mettler Toledo TGA 2 with 50 mL/min of air and a raising rate of 10 °C/min. Raman spectrum was recorded on a Horiba HR Evolution spectrometer with 532 nm excitation laser. The acquisition time was 20 s, and the accumulation was 3 times. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra were obtained on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha electron spectrometer with monochromatic 150 W Al Kα radiation, and the binding energy was referenced to the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV.
Temperature programmed analyses were performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 chemisorption analyzer equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) or an online Hiden QGA mass spectrometer (MS). In temperature programmed reduction with hydrogen (H2-TPR), 100 mg of sample was pretreated in 30 mL/min of 10 vol% H2/Ar at 300 °C for 1 h. After cooling to 50 °C, the flow was switched to 30 mL/min Ar for removing the residuals and reaching a steady state. The H2-TPR curve was recorded with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. In temperature programmed desorption of carbon dioxide (CO2-TPD-MS), 100 mg of catalyst was pre-treated under same conditions to the H2-TPR test. The adsorption in 30 mL/min of CO2 was conducted at 50 °C for 30 min. After purge in 30 mL/min of Ar for 60 min, the MS signals of CO2, Ar, H2O and H2 were started to record with a ramp rate of 10 °C/min.
For evaluating dispersion degree of Ni species in the catalysts, H2 pulse titration experiment was performed on Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 chemisorption analyzer. 100 mg of catalyst was pre-reduced under 10 vol% H2/Ar (30 mL/min) at 400 °C for 2 h. Then the catalyst was purged with Ar (30 mL/min) for 60 min and cooled down to 50 °C to achieve the stable baseline. 10 vol% H2/Ar pulses were fed into the sample tube till adsorption saturation. The ratio of H2 to Ni was assumed as 1:2, and the atomic cross-sectional area (δNi) and the density of Ni (ρNi) were 0.0824 nm2 and 8.902 g cm–3, respectively. The Ni dispersion (DNi), Ni’s specific metal surface area (SNi), and average size of Ni (dNi) were calculated based on the following equations [41], [42]. In the equations, VH2 represented the volume of chemisorbed H2, mcat was the mass of fresh catalyst, WNi represented the weight fraction of Ni in catalyst, and NA was Avogadro’s constant.

2.3. Catalytic CO2 methanation reaction
The reaction was performed in a fixed-bed reactor with a quartz tube (8 mm in inner diameter). The catalyst and quartz sand (20–50 mesh) were pre-reduced in 50 mL/min of 15 vol% H2/N2 flow at 500 °C for 1 h and then cooled to the set temperature. The co-feeding gas was 3/12/5 CO2/H2/Ar at 50 mL/min (gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) = 9400 h–1, 1 atm). For the programmed temperature reactions, the temperature range was from 200 to 450 °C. The long-term reactions were performed at 300 °C and identical GHSV. The effluent gases from the reactor were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with both a methanizer-connected flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The CO2 conversion, the selectivities of CO and CH4 were determined from the following equations:
(4)
Conversion (%) = {[Fin(CO2) – Fout(CO2)] / Fin(CO2)} × 100%
(5)
Selectivity (%) = {Fout(i) / [Fin(CO2) – Fout(CO2)]} × 100%
where i represented the hydrogenation product (CO or CH4), and F(i) is the corresponding flow rate.
The deactivation rate constant (kd), defined by assuming a first order kinetics, was derived from the following integrated formula:
(6)
ln [(1 – Xfinal) / Xfinal] = kd × t + ln [(1 – Xinitial) / Xinitial]
where X represented the CO2 conversion at the time t.
2.4. In situ DRIFT spectral characterization
In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra were recorded on a Thermal is10 spectrometer equipped with a Hattrick cell and an MCT/A detector cooled by liquid nitrogen. The temperature was controlled by an Omega programmable temperature controller. Prior to each experiment, the sample was pre-treated in H2 at 500 °C for 60 min, followed by Ar purge (20 mL/min) for 30 min. The background spectrum at each set temperature was collected in steady state with flowing Ar. The feeding gas in the reaction was 80 % H2 and 20 % CO2 with total flow rate of 20 mL/min. All spectra were recorded by accumulating 100 scans with a resolution of 4 cm–1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic performance
The atmospheric CO2 hydrogenation reactions were performed on Ni/Al2O3 and the modified Ni-M/Al2O3 (M=Fe, W, Mo and Mn) catalysts. Their catalytic performances as a function of the reaction temperature were shown in Fig. 1. A moderate activity was obtained on the monometallic Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. Specifically, the T10 temperature (corresponding to 10 % conversion) was approximately 260 °C, while the T50 value (at 50% conversion) was about 320 °C (Fig. 1A). The conversion raised up to ca. 83 % at 400 °C, reaching the equilibrium (the dash line), while further increased reaction temperature caused decline of the conversion due to the thermodynamic limitation. The CH4 selectivity of Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in the temperature range of 250–400 °C could maintain at a relatively high level (99.1–99.4%, Fig. 1B). The modification with W or Fe additives played negative role on both the catalytic activity and CH4 selectivity. The significantly increased light-off temperatures were obtained on Ni-W/Al2O3 and Ni-Fe/Al2O3 catalysts in comparison with Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. Their T10 values were 310 and 380 °C, while the T50 values were 400 and 430 °C, respectively. These two catalysts also exhibited lower CH4 selectivity of 95–97 % at the temperatures >325 °C. As a striking contrast, the modification with Mo or Mn additives promoted the catalytic performances with respect to the temperature-programmed activity and CH4 selectivity. The T50 values of Ni-Mo/Al2O3 and Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalysts were as low as ca. 265 °C, while their 90% conversions (close to the equilibrium) were achieved at 325 °C. Furthermore, over 99.9 % CH4 selectivity could be maintained at the high-conversion levels (275–375 °C) over these two catalysts.

The catalytic stability of Ni/Al2O3, Ni-Mo/Al2O3 and Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalysts were further evaluated in the long-term CO2 methanation reactions at 300 °C. For Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, the relatively stable values of 42–47% CO2 conversions were observed within 450 h time on stream, while the CH4 selectivity slightly dropped from >99 to 98%, as shown in Fig. 2. In the reaction over Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst for 1100 h, the CH4 selectivity could be maintained over 99.9%, and the conversion was decreased from 93 % to 88 % at a deactivation rate (kd) as significantly low as 7.6 × 10–4 h–1. Although Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst showed high initial activities and stable CH4 selectivities over 99.7%, severe deactivation was observed in 135 h reaction. A remarkable decline of the CO2 conversion was obtained from >80% to ca. 50% in the initial 20 h, and the conversion further slowly decreased to 42% in the next 115 h duration. The corresponding kd values for these two deactivation stages were 1.4 × 10–2 and 8.1 × 10–4 h–1, respectively. Therefore, in comparison with the catalytic performance of Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in the CO2 methanation reaction, the promotion effects of Mn additives on the activity and CH4 selectivity as well as long-term stability were highlighted on the Mn-modified Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst, whereas a high initial activity but an unsatisfactory stability were observed on the Mo-modified Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst. For unveiling the catalytic roles of the Mn and Mo additive species in the Ni-catalyzed CO2 methanation, careful structural characterizations of the catalysts before and after the reactions as well as the in-situ DRIFT spectral experiments were performed, as discussed in the following sections.

3.2. Catalyst structure
The XRD patterns of the fresh and spent catalysts were shown in Fig. 3. The typical characteristic diffractions of γ-Al2O3 phase (JCPDS 29-0063), including the peaks at 19.6°, 31.9°, 37.6°, 39.5°, 45.8°, 60.4° and 66.8°, were observed on all catalysts. The peaks at 51.8° and 76.3° were barely distinguished, which were corresponded to the characteristics of (200) and (220) plane of metallic Ni0 phase for the small-size nanoparticles (JCPDS 04-0850), respectively. The signals corresponding to the Mo- or Mn-related phases were absent over Ni-Mo/Al2O3 and Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalysts, suggesting that the Mo and Mn species existed in highly dispersion states on the γ-Al2O3 supports without obvious aggregation to over-large particles in both fresh and spent catalysts. Furthermore, for the spent Ni/Al2O3 (450 h), Ni-Mo/Al2O3 (135 h) and Ni-Mn/Al2O3 (1100 h) catalysts, their diffraction peaks did not show significant shift in peak position or variation in half-peak breadth, indicating that the Ni, Mo and Mn species might not insert into the γ-Al2O3 matrix for changing the lattice parameters. It was also worth to state that the main diffraction peaks of graphite phase were not emerged in the patterns of the spent catalysts, illustrating that no large amount of highly graphitized coke species was produced during the Ni-catalyzed CO2 methanation reactions. The TGA curves were also measured on three spent catalysts, as shown in Fig. 4. The weight losses at below 100 °C were attributed to the desorption of water species physically adsorbed on the catalysts, while the slightly increased weights at approximately 300 °C were ascribed to the oxidation of metallic Ni species [43], [44]. Less than 1 wt% weight losses were obtained at the further increased temperatures (300–800 °C), indicating that there was no large amount of coke species deposited on these spent catalysts.

The EDX elemental mapping images further illustrated the dispersion of the individual elements in the fresh and spent catalysts, as shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. S1. The Mo and Mn species were homogeneously distributed on the Al2O3 supports in nano scale, while the assembled Ni nanoparticles with small sizes were anchored by the supports. The TEM images in Fig. 6A-C confirmed the γ-Al2O3 nanosheet morphology for these catalysts. The dispersed nanoparticle average sizes were 4.9 ± 2.2, 4.7 ± 1.7 and 5.3 ± 2.1 nm for Ni/Al2O3, Ni-Mo/Al2O3 and Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst, respectively. In the high-resolution HR-TEM images as shown in Fig. 6D-F, the clear lattice fringes with d value of 0.203 nm were observed on these three catalysts, which were attributed to the Ni(111) planes. Based on the H2 pulse titration data as summarized in Table 1, the dispersion degrees and corresponding nanoparticle sizes of these three catalysts were approximately 15% and 5 nm, respectively. Above characterization results indicated the uniform dispersion of the metallic Ni nanoparticles on the bare or modified γ-Al2O3 nanosheet supports.

The Raman spectra of these supported Ni catalysts were shown in Fig. 7, providing the state of the Ni-, Mo- and Mn-relevant species on the catalyst surfaces. For the fresh and spent Ni/Al2O3 catalysts, a weak band at ~540 cm–1 was observed, which was attributed to the longitudinal optical (LO) mode of NiO-like phase that was possibly attached on the Al2O3 support through Ni-O-Al bond [45]. A relatively strong band centered at ~580 cm–1 was observed on the fresh Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst, which was associated with the fingerprint of the Mn-O stretching vibration along the chains in the MnOx framework, and this broad band might cover the weak signal of NiO phase [46], [47]. For the spent Ni-Mn/Al2O3 (1100 h) catalyst, two split bands with the frequencies of ~570 cm–1 and above 605 cm–1 were obtained, suggesting that the strain and relaxation process of MnOx lattices might occur during the long-term reaction for inducing the symmetric stretching vibrations of the MnO6 octahedra with the Ag phonon species [47]. A broad band located at ca. 575 cm–1 was obtained on the fresh Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst, which was assigned to the Al-O stretching mode of Mo-O-Al bond, indicating the formation of the high-density interfaces between the Mo species and Al2O3 supports [48], [49]. As a contrast, the spectrum of the spent Ni-Mo/Al2O3 (135 h) catalyst showed not only the band of NiO species at ca. 540 cm–1 but also the band of the orthorhombic MoO3 or Mo4O11 species with the Ag/B1 g symmetric stretch mode of OMoO at about 820 cm–1 [50], [51]. Such change in the spectral bands suggested that the Mo species in Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst were evolved from the highly dispersed Mo-O-Al interfacial sites to the aggregated MoOx species during the CO2 methanation reaction. Such unstable structure of the Mo/Al2O3 support for the active Ni sites could partially explain the reason of its rapid deactivation phenomenon. Furthermore, the characteristic feature of the graphite species with G and D bands at ca. 1600 and 1300 cm–1 was absent in the spectra of all the spent catalysts, suggesting again that the mass cokes species could not be produced in the Ni-catalyzed CO2 methanation reactions.

Fig. 7. Raman spectra of the fresh and spent Ni catalysts.
The H2-TPR profiles (50–750 °C) in Fig. 8 showed different reduction patterns of the monometallic Ni, Mn and Mo (as references) as well as the bimetallic Ni-Mn, Ni-Mo catalysts, providing the information about the nature and strength of the interactions between Ni species and Mn- or Mo-modified Al2O3 nanosheet supports. For Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, the maximum H2 consumption was obtained at above 500 °C temperatures with a remarkable peak centered at ca. 650 °C, suggesting that the NiOx species in a strong interaction with Al2O3 supports dominated over the catalyst [52], [53]. There were also two low-temperature reduction peaks at about 170 and 400 °C. The former peak was due to the reduction of the adsorbed oxygen species on the NiOx-Al2O3 surfaces, while the latter peak indicated the co-existence of small amounts of Ni species possessing relatively weaker NiOx-Al2O3 interaction. The impregnated bulk Mn/Al2O3 reference sample displayed an asymmetric reduction peak in the temperature range from 350 to 500 °C, corresponding to the successive reduction processes of MnO2-to-Mn3O4 (or Mn2O3) at ~400 °C and Mn3O4 (Mn2O3)-to-MnO at ca. 460 °C [54]. For Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst, a two-stage reduction feature was observed. The main peak at around 340 °C was due to the moderate interaction between the Ni and Mn oxidic phases for most of the Ni species [55]. The remarkably weak peak at 650 °C was associated with the contribution of the small amount of the NiOx species with a strong interaction with Al2O3 supports, which was similar to that for Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. The impregnated Mo/Al2O3 reference showed a single peak at ca. 520 °C, which was attributed to the reduction of MoO3 to MoO2 or Mo4O11 species [56]. For the fresh Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst, two kinds of the Ni species were co-existed. One possessed a strong interaction with Al2O3 supports, leading to a high-temperature reduction peak at ca. 630 °C. Another one showed a broad reduction peak at below 400 °C, indicating a relatively weak interaction between the NiOx species and MoOx substances on Al2O3 supports. For the spent Ni-Mo/Al2O3 (135 h) catalyst, only low-temperature reduction feature could be maintained, and the high-temperature peak was disappeared. Such variation in the NiOx-related reduction nature between the fresh and spent Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalysts might be related to the structural transformation for the Mo species from highly dispersive Mo-O-Al to assembled MoO3 phase during the CO2 methanation reaction for causing the catalytic deactivation, which was also evidenced by the Raman spectral results (Fig. 7).

The XPS spectra were further collected on the fresh and spent catalysts, attaining the insight into the chemical state of the metal species on the catalyst surfaces. The summarized relative proportions of the surface metal species for these catalysts were summarized in Table S2. In the fitted spectra at Ni 2p3/2 orbit, as shown in Fig. 9, the binding energies at 852.5, 856.0 and 862.2 eV were assigned to the metallic Ni0, oxidative Ni2+ and satellite peak, respectively [53], [57]. The similar peak area ratios of Ni0/Ni2+ were obtained on three fresh catalysts, which were 9/91, 10/90 and 10/90 for Ni/Al2O3, Ni-Mn/Al2O3 and Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst, respectively. For the spent Ni/Al2O3 (450 h), Ni-Mn/Al2O3 (1100 h) and Ni-Mo/Al2O3 (135 h) catalysts, their Ni0/Ni2+ ratio did not significantly vary, which was 6/94, 5/95 and 9/91, respectively. The spectra of Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalysts at Mn 2p3/2 orbit were shown in Fig. 10A. The binding energies at 645.3, 641.6 and 639.7 eV were attributed to the Mn4+, Mn3+ and Mn2+ state, respectively [58]. The Mn4+/Mn3+/Mn2+ ratios for the fresh and spent catalysts were 26/36/38 and 29/37/34, respectively. The Mn species were co-existed with mixed oxidation states on the Al2O3 support surfaces, and these MnOx species were stable against the reductive atmosphere of the methanation reaction. The spectra of Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalysts at Mo 3d orbit were shown in Fig. 10B. For the fresh catalyst, the binding energies at 235.9, 234.7 and 232.9 eV were ascribed to MoO3, Mo4O11 and MoO2 species at Mo 3d3/2 orbit, respectively, while that at 232.8, 231.6 and 229.8 eV were corresponded to their signals at Mo 3d5/2 orbit [59]. The MoO3/Mo4O11/MoO2 ratio was 53/42/5 for the fresh Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst. For the spent Ni-Mo/Al2O3 (135 h) catalyst, in addition to the above three oxidative species, the peaks of the metallic Mo0 species at Mo 3d5/2 and 3d5/2 orbits were also observed at 231.9 and 228.7 eV, respectively. The MoO3/Mo4O11/MoO2/Mo0 ratio was found to be 36/48/5/11. The declined amount of MoO3 species and the formation of the metallic Mo0 species via reduction suggested the structural evolution of the unstable MoOx species at the MoOx-Ni-Al2O3 interfaces during the reaction, which resulted in the deactivation issue.

Stable structure of Ni/Al2O3 and Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalysts against the reaction conditions was strongly clarified by the comprehensive characterization results, which benefited to their satisfactory long-term catalyst life in CO2 methanation. For Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst, the oxidative MnOx promoter species were highly dispersed on the nanosheet-shaped γ-Al2O3 supports, and the Ni nanoparticles with approximately 5 nm average size were anchored by the MnOx-modified Al2O3 supports. In comparison with Ni/Al2O3 catalyst consisting of 5 nm Ni nanoparticles located on the unmodified Al2O3 nanosheets, Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited moderate reducibility of NiOx species due to the tuned interaction between Ni species and MnOx-Al2O3 supports. As a sharp contrast, remarkably unstable structure of Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst during the reaction was evidenced, causing a critical deactivation problem with a high kd value within a short period. In the fresh Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst, similarly sized Ni nanoparticles were stabilized by the supports that were modified with the homogenously dispersed MoOx species. However, with the proceeding reaction, the high-dispersion MoOx species eventually evolved into the aggregated MoOx species co-existed with the metallic Mo0 species for the spent Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst, and the MoOx reduction was evidenced by the significantly changed H2-TPR patterns. The original Ni-MoOx interfaces on the Al2O3 supports might reconstruct under the influence of the surface intermediates (reductive hydrogen or CO) formed in the reaction [59], [60]. It was reported that the defective MoO3−x overlayer with oxygen vacancies could be in-situ generated in the Ru-MoO3-catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation with the aid of the metallic Ru sites [6]. The deactivated Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst (within 20–135 h) showed same conversion levels with Ni/Al2O3 catalyst (0–450 h) in the long-term methanation reactions.
3.3. CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation: Intermediates and pathways
The formation of the CO2-derived adsorbates and hydrogenation reaction intermediate species would be explored in this section. The CO2-TPD-MS profiles of the Ni, Ni-Mn and Ni-Mo catalysts were shown in Fig. 11, providing the capability and strength of the CO2 chemisorption on the catalyst surfaces. The moderate-strength chemisorption was achieved on Ni/Al2O3 and Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalysts. A peak at approximately 230 °C was observed on Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. Two-stage CO2 desorption occurred on Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst, corresponding to a broad peak at < 230 °C temperatures and a peak at ca. 350 °C. For the modified Ni-Mn catalyst, a shift of the maximum desorption peak position from 230 to 350 °C suggested that the Ni-Mn catalyst possessed relatively stronger CO2 chemisorption strength in comparison with the monometallic Ni catalyst. In addition, the modification with Mn species in Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst could also increase the CO2 chemisorption content in view of the larger desorption peak area relative to Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. Such enhanced CO2 chemisorption property of Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst was related to the contribution of the surface basic sites with a medium strength, leading to the promoted activity in the CO2 methanation reaction [61]. For Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst, the low strength but high content CO2 adsorption corresponding to the strong peak at 120 °C was obtained, indicating that the weak basic sites dominated over the Mo-modified catalyst surface. The profile also showed a broad desorption peak at 300–400 °C and a weak peak at 460 °C, revealing that a small amount of CO2 molecules was adsorbed on the medium-strength and strong-strength basic sites.

By combining with the in-situ DRIFT spectral characterization, the surface adsorbate and intermediate species were further identified in the steady-state CO2 hydrogenation reactions over three pre-reduced Ni catalysts at 300 °C for 30 min. The collected spectra and the corresponding species assignments were presented in Fig. 12 and Table 2, respectively. In a case of Ni/Al2O3 catalyst (Fig. 12A), the sharp peaks at 3014 and 1304 cm–1 were observed, indicating the production of gaseous CH4. The methyl peak was observed at 2903 cm–1. The peaks located at 1630 and 1429 cm–1 were owing to the formation of bicarbonate species. The peaks at 1597, 1372 and 1392 cm–1 were attributed to bidentate formate species, while the peaks at 1559 and 1324 cm–1 were assigned to bidentate carbonate species. The peaks at 2011, 1914 and 1856 cm–1 in the range from 2100 to 1750 cm–1 were assigned to the adsorbed COads species in linear, bridged and three-fold bridged configurations on the Ni sites, respectively [62].

The facile activation and transformation of CO2 could be evidenced by not only the observation of bicarbonates through the reaction of CO2 and hydroxyl groups on supports as the weakly basic sites, but also the detection of bidentate carbonates via CO2 dissociation on the mildly basic sites [63]. The absence of the characteristic peaks of monodentate carbonates and monodentate formates (as hydrogenation product of monodentate carbonates) suggested the lack of the surface adsorbed O2– sites with strong basicity, which well agreed with the CO2-TPD-MS result. With the aid of the spillover hydrogen species dissociated on the Ni sites, the bidentate formates could be produced via the hydrogenation of these (bi)carbonate-relevant adsorbates and further split into COads intermediate species [64], [65], [66]. The CH4 production was finally achieved by the COads methanation process on the Ni surfaces. The above typical spectral features demonstrated that the Ni/Al2O3-catalyzed CO2 methanation followed the reaction pathway with COads species as the key intermediates, as shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1. Proposed COads-mediated reaction pathway for CO2 methanation over Ni/Al2O3, Ni-Mn/Al2O3 and Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalysts.
Among three kinds of the formed COads species, the three-fold bridged species (1856 cm−1) and bridged species (1914 cm–1) showed both superior chemisorption strengths and larger proportions in comparison with the linear COads species (2011 cm–1), indicating that the planar metallic Ni0 sites (e.g., Ni(111) plane) dominated the Ni surfaces in Ni/Al2O3 catalyst for providing intense Ni-COads interaction [57]. In addition, the peaks of CH4 product, COads species and methyl species (as the intermediate in COads-to-CH4 hydrogenation process) revealed remarkably weak intensities in comparison with the signals of the formate- and bicarbonate-relevant intermediate species, which clearly clarified that the dissociation of CO2 into carbonates and formates could proceed favorably, and nonetheless, the formation of COads species from formates decomposition was inefficient. In the key step of dissociative hydrogenation of COads species, the relatively low activity to convert the over-stable COads species could limit the complete CO2 methanation cycle, causing an unsatisfactory activity of the monometallic Ni/Al2O3 catalyst. Furthermore, gaseous CO was not detected as the by-product in both the catalytic reactions and DRIFT spectral characterizations, highlighting again the high stability of the formed COads species that could prefer neither desorption as the product nor further hydrogenation into CH4. The Ni(CO)x supersaturation, which usually led to agglomeration of Ni atoms for poisoning the active sites, might not be happened on Ni/Al2O3 catalyst, in view of its high catalytic stability in the long-term CO2 methanation reaction for 450 h [40].
In the spectra of the modified catalysts of Ni-Mo/Al2O3 (Fig. 12B) and Ni-Mn/Al2O3 (Fig. 12C), in addition to CH4 product, the typical surface species, including bicarbonates, bidentate carbonates, bidentate formates, linear and bridged COads species, etc., were captured during the steady-state reactions at 300 °C, indicating that both two modified catalysts also followed the COads-mediated hydrogenation reaction pathway (Scheme 1). Specifically, signals of CH4 product and COads species as the key intermediates over the Ni-Mo and Ni-Mn catalysts were remarkably enhanced in comparison with that over the monometallic Ni catalyst, which was consistent with their superior catalytic activities. Slight shifts in the peak positions with few wavenumbers were also observed on the Mo- and Mn-modified catalysts relative to the Ni catalyst, as summarized in Table 2. For instance, for the linear COads species, the peak position was 2011, 2021 and 2038 cm–1 for Ni, Ni-Mo and Ni-Mn catalyst, respectively. The modification of Mo and Mn also allowed the peak of the bridged COads species to blue shift (from 1914 to 1920/1931, from 1856 to 1865/1867, cm–1). Such substantial differences for COads species evidenced the electronic modification effects of the MoOx or MnOx additives on the Ni sites. These oxides served as the electron acceptor for the d-π electron transfer of the Ni-CO bonding, leading to the high-wavenumber peak shifts. Furthermore, the distributions of the COads species were distinctly different over these three Ni catalysts. The relative proportion of the linear COads species compared with two bridged species was significantly increased over the Ni-Mo and Ni-Mn catalyst than the Ni catalyst, suggesting that the Mo and Mn promoters played a role in the geometric modification on the Ni surfaces. In particular, the increased proportion of the linear COads species confirmed the formation of the high-density Ni-MoOx or Ni-MnOx interface sites rather than the large-size Ni particles with more planar sites. Therefore, the geometric and electronic modification effects of the Mo and Mn additives on the Ni sites were verified by the above spectral results.
By analyzing the variation trends of the relevant surface intermediate species and CH4 product during the reactions over the Ni-Mo and Ni-Mn catalysts, the relative peak intensities of CH4, bicarbonates, bidentate formates and linear COads species (at ca. 3014, 1630, 1592 and 2030 cm–1, respectively) were drawn as a function of the reaction time on stream, as shown in Fig. 13. The maximum peak intensity for each species was set as a reference with 100% relativity. For Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst, all four species were monotonically increased with the increasing reaction time from 0 to 30 min, revealing that each sequential key step, CO2 → bicarbonates → bidentate formates → COads → CH4, could proceed at high reaction rate, and these reaction rates could achieve well matching. Therefore, the satisfactory catalytic activity and long-term stability could be achieved on Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst for 1100 h.

Fig. 13. Variation of relative peak intensities of (A) bicarbonates (1630 cm−1), (B) bidentate formates (1592 cm−1), (C) linear COads species (2030 cm−1) and (D) CH4 (3014 cm−1) in CO2 methanation DRIFT spectra (from Fig. 12) over Ni-Mo/Al2O3 and Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalysts.
As a contrast, mismatched rates in these steps were observed on Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst. The formation of bicarbonates rapidly reached the maximum intensity within initial 5 min and maintained high level in the further 25 min (Fig. 13A). Bidentate formates could be steadily produced with the increasing time (Fig. 13B). The intensities of the formed COads species and CH4 product were raised up to the maximum at 7 min and declined in the following duration, and the decline rate for later step of CH4 formation was relatively higher than that for COads formation (Fig. 13C-D). Above intensity-time relationships for the key species suggested that CO2 activation and dissociation could occur easily to produce bicarbonates, which was in well agreement with the great CO2 chemisorption property of Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst, as evidenced by the strong CO2 desorption peak at low temperature in the CO2-TPD-MS profile. The transformation from bicarbonates to bidentate formates could also efficiently accomplished. However, as the downstream steps, the formation of COads species via decomposition of bidentate formates and the COads-to-CH4 step both exhibited remarkably low reaction rates, causing the accumulation of bidentate formates and the deceleration of CH4 production. Therefore, these results could be expected to explain the great initial activity and the severe deactivation issue of Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst.
4. Conclusions
Ni/Al2O3, Ni-Mo/Al2O3 and Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalysts with ~10 wt% Ni loadings were prepared and applied in CO2 methanation reactions. The monometallic Ni catalyst displayed ca. 45% conversion and >98% CH4 selectivity in the reaction at 300 °C for 450 h. Under the identical conditions, the modified Ni-Mn catalyst exhibited 93–88% conversion and >99.9% selectivity in 1100 h reaction, whereas the Ni-Mo catalyst showed severe deactivation with rapidly dropped conversions from >80 to 50% within initial 20 h.
As revealed by the characterization results, Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was consisted of Ni nanoparticles with 5 nm size stabilized by the nanosheet-shaped γ-Al2O3 supports. For Ni-Mo/Al2O3 and Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalysts, the 5 nm sized Ni nanoparticles were anchored by the highly dispersed MoOx or MnOx species on the γ-Al2O3 nanosheets. In comparison with Ni/Al2O3 catalyst with the Ni-Al2O3 interfaces, the distinctly different reduction degrees of Ni and structural stabilities were observed on Ni-Mo/Al2O3 or Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalysts due to the specific interfaces constructed between the Ni sites and the MoOx- or MnOx-modified supports. Both Ni/Al2O3 and Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalysts could maintain the Ni-support interface structures during the reactions, contributing to their extremely high catalytic stability. As a contrast, the MoOx species in Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst could evolve from the high dispersion state into the aggregation state along with the reduction into the metallic Mo0 species, causing the variation in the structure and property of the interfaces between active Ni sites and Mo-modified supports, and therefore leading to the dramatical deactivation issue.
By monitoring the surface intermediate species formed during the CO2 methanation reactions, the in-situ DRIFT spectral observations demonstrated that these Ni catalysts followed the COads-mediated hydrogenation reaction pathway. The complete catalytic reaction cycle included CO2 → bicarbonates → bidentate carbonates → bidentate formates → COads → CHx → CH4, with the assistance of the dissociated hydrogen species. The significantly high and well-matched reaction rates in these sequential steps over Ni-Mn/Al2O3 catalyst benefited to its satisfactory catalytic activity as well as great long-term stability. However, the low activities of Ni/Al2O3 catalyst in the key steps of formate decomposition and COads methanation (as the rate-limiting step) seriously limit the whole hydrogenation processes, causing its relatively low CO2 conversions. Ni-Mo/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited superior ability for CO2 chemisorption and dissociation into bicarbonates, which might be related to its high initial activity. Nonetheless, the formation and hydrogenation of COads species could not be steadily proceeded, and therefore, the accumulation of the inactive surface species might induce the structural change of the Ni-MoOx interfaces and the deactivation phenomenon.
