1. Introduction
Propene is one of the important chemical building blocks produced in the petrochemical industry [1]. Due to the steep rise in urbanization, the demand for propene has grown significantly. Currently, it is mainly made available in the industry by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha. In order to close the gap between demand and supply of propene, catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is also used as an production route [1]. These methods of production are endothermic, involve use of higher temperatures, their conversion is thermodynamically limited and these processes face rapid catalyst deactivation due to coke formation. To counter these drawbacks, studies were initiated on the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane using oxygen as an oxidant. This route is exothermic, requires moderate reaction temperature (˜300–500 °C), has no thermodynamic limitation and has reduced coke formation [1,2]. However, this route is beset with the challenge of complete oxidation of propane and propene to carbon oxides. Consequently, a lower selectivity to propene is achieved at higher conversions of propane. To overcome this challenge, one of the promising alternatives involves the use of CO2 as a mild oxidant in the ODH of propane over various supported catalysts [3]. Another advantage of using CO2 is that it can absorb the exothermic heat of reaction due to its high heat capacity [4]. Thus, the formation of hot spots and cracking of propane can be avoided.
There is a noticeable rise in atmospheric CO2 due to the large emissions by human activities, which has an effect on the global climate. Therefore, utilization of CO2 in industrially important chemical reactions, such as the ODH of propane, is worthwhile and gaining attention. CO2 is a thermodynamically stable molecule, and requires the design of a suitable catalysts and reaction conditions to create a driving force for its chemical transformation.
Catalysts investigated for the ODH reaction using oxygen as an oxidant include oxide catalysts, such as supported vanadia [1,2,[5], [6], [7]]. The most commonly observed reaction mechanism occurring on these oxide catalysts are those proposed by Mars Van Krevelen [8,9]. According to this mechanism, the reactant is oxidized by simultaneously reducing the catalyst, and in the second step the oxidant (O2 or CO2) restores the catalyst to its original oxidized state. In contrast to O2, CO2 is a weak oxidizing agent, and it is possible that it does not fully re-oxidize the catalyst to its original oxidation state [4]. Thus, the degree of reduction (or the steady state ratio of the reduced and oxidized sites) may be different when O2 and CO2 are used as the oxidant. Furthermore, it is also reported that direct dehydrogenation of propane (DDP) occurs on these oxide catalysts [4]. CO2 eliminates hydrogen released by this dehydrogenation route via reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS). Therefore, the combination of DDP and RWGS enhances the equilibrium conversion of propane. In addition, CO2 can decompose the coke formed over the catalysts by the reverse Boudouard reaction and impart long term stability to the catalysts.
Supported vanadia catalysts have been widely reported to possess excellent catalytic activity for the ODH of propane to propene [10]. Typically oxide supports like alumina, silica, titania and ceria are used to synthesize these catalysts. Vanadia is dispersed over these high surface area porous oxide supports. Furthermore, it is known that at less than monolayer coverage of vanadia molecularly dispersed species are formed [2,[10], [11], [12]]. These species are reported to be highly active and selective for the ODH reaction.
Previous studies reveal that an improvement in the ODH activity of the supported vanadia catalyst can be achieved by addition of the secondary metal oxide [12,13]. Alumina supported vanadia showed improved catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation reaction with the addition of MgO [14]. The MgO assisted in better dispersion of vanadia and also decreased coke formation. Consequently, the stability of the catalyst is improved. Similar promotional effect is reported on the performance of silica supported vanadia catalyst modified with tungsten oxide [4]. Tungsten oxide interacts with vanadia causing better dispersion of the active vanadia species; thus maintaining their abundance. Interaction with tungsten oxide is even reported to enhance the reducibility of vanadia species, which is beneficial for the dehydrogenation of propane. Furthermore, the enhancement in the DDP over supported vanadia is observed in the presence of CO2 [4].
However, CO2 assisted propane dehydrogenation on the alumina supported vanadia catalysts in the presence of a secondary metal oxide like chromium, molybdenum or tungsten oxide has not been studied and compared. These secondary metal oxides have varying redox properties and can influence the redox property of vanadia. Our earlier work demonstrated the effect of these secondary oxides on the performance of alumina supported vanadia for the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction using oxygen as the oxidant [13]. Keeping this outcome in perspective, we have undertaken the current work to study the dehydrogenation of propane, both in the presence and absence of CO2, on alumina supported vanadia catalysts using chromium, molybdenum and tungsten oxides as additives. Moreover, the surface acidity of catalysts is known to have an effect on the activity and selectivity of several industrially important reactions, and can be determined by using appropriate base compounds as adsorbents. For supported metal oxide catalysts, FTIR spectroscopy of pyridine was successfully used to quantify the surface acidic properties [15]. However, in the present study the surface acidic properties of the various catalysts were not determined. Hence, any correlation of the activity and selectivity with the acidic properties were not considered.
In the first part of the current study, we report the thermodynamic analysis to show the beneficial effect of co-feeding CO2 with propane on the dehydrogenation of propane. In the second part, a series of alumina supported vanadia with a secondary oxide are synthesized by the incipient wetness impregnation method and are characterized by N2-adsorption for their surface area. Furthermore, temperature program reduction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy are performed to evaluate their redox properties on treatment with O2 and CO2. Finally, the characterization data is correlated with the performance of these catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane with and without co-feeding CO2.
2. Experimental procedures
2.1. Thermodynamic calculations
Thermodynamic analysis of the oxidative dehydrogenation of C3H8 reaction using CO2 was performed using AspenPlus 7.2 software. It was previously used for various reforming reactions using propane and carbon dioxide as reactants [[16], [17], [18]]. The possible reactions that are known to take place are:
(1)
C3H8 + CO2→ C3H6 + CO + H2O
(2)
DDP: C3H8→ C3H6 + H2
(3)
RWGS: CO2 + H2→ CO + H2O
Therefore, the reactants and products included were CO2, C3H8 and C3H6, CO, H2, H2O respectively. In this work, equilibrium composition was determined by using RGibbs reactor model with Gibbs free energy minimization algorithm subject to atom balance constraints. The influence of the CO2:C3H8 molar ratio (1:1 and 3:1) and temperature on equilibrium conversion and product composition were examined. The pressure was kept constant at 1 atm while the temperature was varied in the range of 500–1200 K. The effect of including N2 as an inert was also considered to mimic the reactant stream with CO2:C3H8:N2 ratio of 3:1:4 used in the activity study. Aspects of fluid dynamics, heat transfer limitations in the reactor and side reactions leading to carbon formation and catalyst deactivation are not taken into consideration in these calculations.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
γ-alumina (obtained from Sasol, Puralox 200 m2/g) supported catalysts in this study were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method. The composition of the catalysts, and the preparation methodology used were adopted from our previous reported work [13]. Accordingly, seven catalysts were prepared and referred to as 7V, 4Cr, 5Mo, 7W, 7V4Cr, 7V5Mo, and 7V7W. The numbers denote the weight percentage of corresponding oxide (V2O5, Cr2O3, MoO3, WO3) deposited on alumina. An earlier study confirmed that these oxide species were non-interactive molecularly dispersed in nature and in their mixed oxide form as suggested by Raman Spectroscopy and hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) studies [13].
2.3. Catalyst characterization
2.3.1. BET surface area
The surface area was determined using multipoint BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) method from the data obtained on a Quantachrome Autosorb equipment. About 50 mg of sample was degassed at 523 K for 2 h followed by nitrogen adsorption at 77 K.
2.3.2. H2-TPR studies
H2-TPR studies of calcined samples were carried out in Altamira AMI-200 unit. About 100 mg of catalyst was degassed using argon flow prior to H2-TPR study. The sample was then heated from 323 K to 873 K at a ramp rate of 10 K/min under hydrogen flow and maintained at 873 K for 1 h. Any hydrogen consumed was detected by a thermal conductivity detector. This reduced catalyst was purged with argon and subsequently oxidized with oxygen at 873 K. The sample was then cooled to 323 K. Finally, the H2-TPR step was repeated to examine whether the active sites were regenerated. The same experiment was repeated taking a fresh catalyst sample and using CO2 as an oxidant in place of oxygen. The reduction degree of the catalyst was defined as follows:
The H2-consumed during reduction is obtained from this H2-TPR study. The stoichiometric factor is the stoichiometric amount of H2 required to reduce the reducible oxides with different oxidation states present in one mole of a given metal oxide. The proportion of metal in their different oxidation states was determined by XPS analysis. The calculated reduction degree of 7V and 4Cr catalysts is reported in Table 1. Due to the uncertainty involved in determining the stoichiometric factor for mixed metal oxide catalyst, their reduction degree was not determined.

2.3.3. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
Photoelectron spectra were recorded on a PHI 5000 Versaprobe II, FET Inc., equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα source (hν =1486.6 eV, spot size 200 μm, 45° collection angle, pass energy of analyzer 187.85 eV). The binding energy (BE) values were corrected using C1s peak (BE =284.8 eV) as an internal standard. After a Shirley background subtraction, the elemental species in different oxidation states were estimated by using non-linear peak fitting routine available in Origin 8.0 as a combination of Gaussian curves. The average oxidation state was determined for each catalyst sample under four different conditions, (i) as-synthesized (O2), (ii) after reduction (H2), (iii) after reoxidation of reduced catalyst with O2 (H2-O2) and (iv) after reoxidation of reduced catalyst with CO2 (H2-CO2).
2.4. Reactivity studies
The ODH of propane using CO2 was performed in a down flow tubular quartz reactor operating at 823 K under atmospheric pressure. About 200 mg of catalyst was pretreated in an oxygen flow at 823 K for 30 min. Then 16 ml/min of reactant gas mixture with CO2/C3H8/N2 in a molar ratio of 3:1:4 was passed through the catalyst bed. Product gases consisted of CO, CH4, C3H6 and unreacted C3H8 and CO2. These product gases were analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector. Experiments were repeated at least three times with freshly prepared catalyst so that an average reactivity data and standard errors were obtained. The reaction data was averaged over a run time of 2 h. Furthermore, the reaction data were presented in terms of conversions and yields using definitions previously used [9].
Direct dehydrogenation of propane experiments were also performed maintaining the weight of the catalyst and partial pressure of propane the same as in the ODH study described above. The corresponding molar ratio of C3H8/N2 was 1:7 and the total flow rate was 16 ml/min. Here the product gases consisted of CH4, C3H6 and unreacted C3H8.
The turnover frequency (TOF, s−1) for C3H8 and CO2 conversion was calculated from the formula given below:
Similar to the TPR analysis above, the TOF was not calculated for the mixed metal oxide catalysts.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculation
The equilibrium conversion (Xeqm) of C3H8 and corresponding amount of all the components are calculated over 500–1200 K for three different reactant stream compositions as shown in Fig. 1(a–d). From Fig. 1a, it can be concluded that Xeqm of C3H8 increased by 32% at 823 K for CO2:C3H8 molar ratio of 3:1 as compared to that at 1:1. This suggests that using excess CO2 promotes propane conversion. A recent study reported an equilibrium propane conversion of ˜50% in a reaction system of CO2 and C3H8 with a molar ratio of 1:1, similar to the results obtained in our study [4]. Furthermore, the calculated Xeqm (64%) of C3H8 was comparable to the previously reported value (67%) for CO2:C3H8 molar ratio of 3:1 at 823 K [5]. Interestingly, in presence of nitrogen a higher Xeqm of propane (72%) was estimated. Such an increase in propane conversion in presence of N2 as an inert was also observed in the previous study [5].

(a) Equilibrium fractional conversion of propane, (b) equilibrium product amounts for CO2 and C3H8 system (CO2:C3H8 = 1:1), (c) equilibrium product amounts for CO2 and C3H8 system (CO2:C3H8 = 3:1), (d) equilibrium product amounts for CO2, C3H8 and N2 system (CO2:C3H8:N2 = 3:1:4) as a function of temperature.
The simultaneous occurrence of DDP and RWGS reactions results in the formation of C3H6, H2, CO and H2O [4,5]. The equilibrium amount of these products along with CO2 and C3H8 vary as a function of temperature and are shown in Fig. 1(b–d) for three different reactant stream compositions. A comparative analysis of Fig. 1b and c revealed that increasing CO2 has a detrimental effect on propene formation. Furthermore, the ratio of H2/CO decreased from 0.74 to 0.66 with increase in the molar ratio of CO2:C3H8 from 1:1 to 3:1 at 823 K. However, addition of inert to the reactant stream of CO2 and C3H8 did not further alter the H2/CO ratio. The decrease in H2/CO ratio with increase in CO2 is due to the fact that dry reforming of propane competes with the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 at the chosen operating temperature [4]. Therefore, it is desirable to kinetically limit the occurrence of dry reforming of propane and promote oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. This can be achieved by designing a suitable catalyst, which is the scope of this study.
3.2. BET surface area and H2-TPR studies
The surface area associated with the synthesized alumina supported catalysts is reported in Table 1. The surface area of these catalysts decreased marginally as compared to that of alumina support. This finding is consistent with those previously reported [13]. Moreover, X-ray diffraction studies revealed that the support is not affected significantly during the catalyst preparation method.
For the catalysts investigated in this work, the total metal oxide surface coverage is below their corresponding monolayer coverage values. The monolayer surface coverage value for the vanadium, chromium, molybdenum and tungsten oxides on an alumina support is: 7.3 V/nm2, 4 Cr/nm2, 4.6 Mo/nm2 and 4.5 W/nm2 [13,19]. It was also reported from the Raman spectra of these catalysts that the vibration associated with VO, CrO, MoO, WO bonds in the investigated mixed oxide catalysts is close to that of the single molecularly dispersed oxide catalysts [13]. Thus, it is ensured that the monolayer coverage is not exceeded even in the mixed oxide catalysts and that the vanadia and the secondary oxide additive are non-interacting in nature.
The H2-TPR profiles for the alumina supported metal oxide catalysts are presented in Fig. 2. The TPR profiles of the fresh calcined catalysts are in complete agreement with those previously reported [13]. These profiles are shown in Fig. 2 with dark solid black lines. The reduction temperatures of the metal oxides in the freshly prepared catalysts are reported in Table 1. Chromium oxide is reduced at a lower temperature of 640 K amongst the metal oxides catalysts investigated, followed by molybdenum oxide at 760 K and vanadium oxide at 784 K. Tungsten oxide was not reduced in the temperature range of 473–873 K. The reduction temperature of vanadia species in mixed 7V5Mo and 7V7W catalysts were unaffected. However, vanadia species are reduced at a relatively lower temperature of 763 K in 7V4Cr catalyst. This could be due to some hydrogen spillover from the easily reducible chromium oxide species [13]. Additionally, the reduction degree was determined for both fresh (calcined) and O2 (and CO2) treated 7V and 4Cr catalysts. The % reduction values are tabulated in Table 1.

The catalysts in (a) are reoxidized using O2 and in (b) are reoxidized using CO2 as an oxidant. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article).
The reduced catalysts in the TPR equipment were reoxidized with O2 followed by reduction with H2 to ascertain the degree to which the metal oxides are regenerated. The same procedure is repeated using CO2 as an oxidant to regenerate the reduced catalysts. The corresponding second TPR profiles are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b) with the use of red dashed line. The vanadium species seem to be regenerated to a similar extent using O2 and CO2 as oxidants. Same observation was made for single oxide catalyst 7V as well as for the vanadia species in the mixed oxide catalysts (7V4Cr, 7V5Mo and 7V7W). Further, the area under these peaks appears to be the same indicative of the same number of sites. However, the chromium species are reoxidized to a lesser extent using CO2 as compared to that obtained using O2. Similar observation was reported for alumina supported chromium oxide catalysts [20]. It is difficult to clearly state whether this trend is followed even by molybdenum species because of its very small reduction peak. The tungsten oxide species was not reducible in 7W and 7V7W. Furthermore, it appears that vanadium and chromium oxides are reducible, whereas molybdenum oxide is slightly reducible and tungsten oxide is not. Overall from the TPR studies, it can be concluded that vanadium species are regenerated to an equal extent using CO2 and O2 as oxidants, but chromium species are only partially reoxidized using CO2.
3.3. XPS
X-ray photoelectron spectra were obtained for the catalysts containing only vanadia and chromia. These catalysts showed difference in redox property on the use of O2 and CO2 as oxidants during TPR studies. This study allowed for the determination of the average oxidation state. Hence, it was used to evaluate the ability of the reduced catalysts to regain their oxide form under O2 and CO2 environment.
The de-convoluted spectra of V in 7V catalyst obtained under four different treatment conditions are shown in Fig. 3. Similar spectra of V and Cr were obtained for 7V4Cr and 4Cr catalysts. The characteristic peak position was used to identify the element in different oxidation states. V2p3/2 and Cr2p3/2 peaks were used to do quantitative analysis of vanadia and chromia species respectively. Using an iterative procedure, these single peaks were deconvolute into multiple peaks corresponding to different oxidation states of an element. For the V2p3/2 envelope, attempts were made to fit peaks corresponding to three oxidation states: V5+, V4+, and V3+. However, only two spectral components (V5+ and V3+) could be fit accurately into the V2p3/2 envelope. Then the area of these peaks and their assigned binding energy values were used to obtain the average oxidation state (OS) of the element. The average OS associated with element after each treatment is reported in Table 2.

The data revealed that the freshly prepared 7V catalyst has majority of the vanadia species (˜88.3%) in the +5 OS identified with a characteristic peak position at 517.7 eV and the remaining vanadia species are in +3 OS as identified with a characteristic peak position at 516.1 eV [21]. The average OS of this catalyst was thus calculated to be 4.77. This catalyst on reduction with H2 had its OS decreased to 3.99. Upon reoxidizing with O2, the average OS was restored back to 4.78, while an OS of 4.58 was obtained for CO2 reoxidized sample (Table 2) suggesting incomplete re-oxidation. Thus, O2 was able to fully re-oxidise the vanadia species and CO2 was able to only partially re-oxidize these species.
Chromia species in the +6 OS and +3 OS are known to show XPS signal at the binding energy values of 579.2 eV and 576.7 eV, respectively [22,23]. The characteristic peaks associated with chromia species in 4Cr were de-convoluted accordingly. As prepared 4Cr catalyst had ˜84% species in the +6 OS and the remaining ˜16% species in the +3 OS accounting for an average OS of 5.53. The catalyst on reduction showed lower average OS of 5.08 as the relative proportion of +3 species increased. Nevertheless, these reduced chromia species could be reoxidized fully by O2, but not by CO2. This characteristic redox property is similar to that observed for vanadia species.
In case of mixed vanadia-chromia catalyst (7V4Cr), the vanadia and chromia species exhibited same redox characteristics as shown in the single oxide catalysts, viz., 7V and 4Cr. These results support the findings of Raman spectroscopy and TPR studies that these oxides are non-interacting in nature. It is also clear from this XPS study, CO2 is a weak oxidizing agent and can partially reoxidize the vanadia and chromia species.
3.4. Reactivity studies
Reaction data for ODH of propane with CO2 and DH of propane over the supported metal oxide catalysts are presented in Table 3. Under the chosen reaction conditions, there were no reactions in the gas phase as well as on the bare alumina support. However, the performance of the catalysts deteriorated over the 2 h run time and a representative data for 7V is shown in Fig. S1 in the Supporting information. Furthermore, the deactivation appears to be related to carbon formation as seen from the Raman spectra of the spent catalyst shown in Fig. S2.

A first set of experiments were performed to measure the dehydrogenation activity of the catalysts. It can be seen that alumina supported chromia catalyst was the most active catalyst. The corresponding propane TOF obtained was also the highest (Table 3). The propane cracking activity, indicated by the formation of CH4, is also largest for the chromium containing catalysts. Interestingly, it is also the commercially used catalyst in the production of propene by dehydrogenation of propane [24,25]. However, chromia is known to cause health problems in humans and also there are environmental concerns in its use [20]. Therefore, alternative catalysts can be explored.
Supported vanadia and molybdena catalysts which are observed as the next best catalysts in this study are considered by many researchers as alternatives to chromia [24,26,27]. Since these catalysts are less active as compared to chromia, typically MgO is used as a promotor to enhance the activity of these catalysts [26,27]. It was also found in this study that the alumina supported tungsten oxide was the least active for the dehydrogenation reaction. The mixed oxides were also tested for this reaction. However, no synergy in the dehydrogenation activity was obtained by using the mixed metal oxides as evident from the propane conversion values (Table 3). Since propane dehydrogenation involves a single reactant molecule it appears that the active site is not influenced by the nature of non-interactive metal oxides in mixed oxide catalysts as characterized by TPR and XPS studies.
The influence of co-feeding CO2 with propane was examined over the catalysts. The results are presented in Table 3. Carbon monoxide was the additional product observed with CO2 co-feed. Interestingly, the CO2 conversion was equal to the CO yield. The formation of CO in equal amounts to CO2 conversion and the formation of propene as a product is indicative of the oxidative dehydrogenation nature of the reaction. The performance of chromia catalyst is significantly reduced by ˜45% when CO2 is co-fed with propane. A similar loss in propane dehydrogenation activity of alumina supported chromia in the presence of CO2 has been reported previously [20]. It was also observed in the present study that there was loss in the activity (7–17%) of the alumina supported vanadia and molybdena catalysts. Dehydrogenation activity of chromia occurs by the reduced chromia sites [28]. These reduced chromia sites can strongly adsorb CO2 to form bicarbonate species [29]. Consequently, the number of active sites available for dehydrogenation of propane decreases and the activity drops. Using similar arguments it appears that CO2 also strongly adsorbs on the reduced vanadium and molybdenum oxide sites causing the number of active sites to decrease. Thus, the dehydrogenation activity of supported vanadia and molybdena also decrease. In contrast, the activity of alumina supported tungsta catalyst remains low and does not significantly change with the co-feeding of CO2. The surface tungsten oxide species was seen to be difficult to reduce from the TPR studies and no effect of CO2 adsorption is observed.
For the mixed metal oxide catalysts, the effect of adding the second metal oxide species to the vanadia catalysts depends on the specific metal oxide added. For example, the addition of chromia, as in 7V4Cr, does not show any promotional effect since the cumulative C3H8 conversion of 7V and 4Cr is greater than that of 7V4Cr. As discussed above, the strongly bound CO2 on the reduced chromia and vanadia sites cause them to be inactive and the remaining chromium and vanadium oxide sites are active. In contrast, 7V5Mo shows a promotional effect since the C3H8 conversion of 7V5Mo is greater than that of the cumulative conversion of 7V and 5Mo. The 7V7W catalyst also shows a promotional effect due to the same reason. In fact, the increase in C3H8 conversion is the highest for 7V7W. Interestingly, the TPR studies above revealed the vanadium and chromium oxides are easier to reduce than molybdenum oxide, and tungsten oxide is not reducible. It appears that for the vanadium containing mixed metal oxide catalysts, to promote the C3H8 conversion during ODH with CO2, it is beneficial to have a non-reducible secondary metal oxide. Furthermore, it would be worthwhile exercise to increase the partial pressure of CO2 such that the surface metal oxide species are more oxidized and are not poisoned by CO2.
4. Conclusions
Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations revealed that the use of CO2 can enhance the propane conversion. To achieve this objective several alumina supported vanadia catalysts modified with chromia, molybdena and tungsta were synthesized. Their characterization by TPR and XPS revealed non-interacting nature of the oxides in the mixed oxide form. It was also found that CO2 has a weaker oxidizing potential as compared to O2. Alumina supported chromia gave the highest propane dehydrogenation activity in the absence of CO2. However, there was no synergy observed in the use of mixed oxide catalysts. Introducing CO2 as a co-feed with propane revealed no improvement in the propene formation rates under the same partial pressures of propane when chromia was used as a secondary supported metal oxide; whereas an improvement in propene formation was observed when molybdenum or tungsten was used. The absence of synergy for chromium as the secondary metal oxide appears to be related to the strong adsorption of CO2 on the reduced vanadium and chromium oxide sites. The improvement in propene yield when molybdenum and tungsten are used as the secondary metal oxide appears to be related to their non-reducible nature. In future it might be worthwhile to study the effect of partial pressure of CO2 on the propane DH reaction such that the surface metal oxide species were more oxidized.
