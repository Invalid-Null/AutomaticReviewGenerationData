Non-oxidative Dehydrogenation of Methanol to Formaldehyde over Bulk β-Ga2O3
Graphical Abstract
“GA” instead of “AG”: The application of Ga2O3 in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol to produce water-free formaldehyde and hydrogen was established as a possible alternative to the classical oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol over Ag. In the temperature range from 500 °C to 650 °C dehydrogenation prevails the dehydration pathway over Ga2O3, which can be fully oxidatively regenerated at 500 °C and 550 °C.
Abstract
The non-oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol to formaldehyde is considered a dream reaction compared with the classical oxidative route, because the valuable coupled product hydrogen is formed instead of water, and the produced anhydrous formaldehyde is highly suitable for the further synthesis of oxygenated synthetic fuels. This study reports on the high catalytic performance of pure β-Ga2O3 in this reaction at temperatures between 500 °C and 650 °C. At 550 °C and a GHSV of 45500 h−1, an initial selectivity to formaldehyde of 77 % was obtained at a methanol conversion of 72 %. Performing the reaction at temperatures beyond this range and lower GHSV resulted in a lower formaldehyde selectivity. The catalyst suffered from deactivation caused by formation of carbon deposits, but it was possible to regenerate its initial activity at 500 °C and 550 °C completely by an oxidative treatment. Irreversible deactivation occurred at 650 °C due to partial volatilization of Ga2O3.
Introduction
Formaldehyde (CH2O) is one of the most important industrial chemicals which is mainly used for the production of resins or as a building block for the synthesis of other chemical compounds.1 The global market of CH2O is estimated at 45.6 Mt in 20202 and expected to grow with 4.65 % per year from 2021 to 2028, thus reaching a market value of USD 37.7 billion by 2028.3 Since the beginning of the large-scale manufacturing in 1889, CH2O is produced by selective vapor-phase oxidation of methanol (CH3OH), which is based on partial oxidation (1) and dehydrogenation (2).1, 4 This process is nowadays performed either over silver catalysts (silver contact process, (Eq. (1))5, 6 or over iron oxide-molybdenum oxide catalysts (Formox process, (Eq. 2).7
Considering the plans of the European Commission to reduce the greenhouse emissions by 55 % to 2030 and to reach net-zero emissions by 2050,8 the application of synthetic fuels synthesized from non-fossil sources applying renewable energy becomes attractive for the mobility sector. This is especially relevant for the heavy-duty and long-distance transport. Polyoxymethylene dimethyl ethers (OME, CH3-(OCH2)n-OCH3 with n=3-5), which can be prepared by acid-catalyzed acetalization of CH3OH with CH2O,9, 10 are suggested as a potential drop-in oxygenated synthetic fuel or fuel additive because of the similar physicochemical properties and unlimited miscibility with conventional diesel fuel. When used as a neat fuel or blended with diesel, OMEs show important benefits such as improved efficiency of the engine due to the higher cetane numbers and significant reduction of the particulate matter emissions.11-13 Anhydrous CH2O is preferred for the synthesis of OME to achieve higher reaction rates and selectivity towards the desired products.9, 10 Since the resulting commercial product of the selective oxidation of CH3OH (Eq. 1) is an aqueous solution of CH2O with maximum concentrations up to 55 %,5 the direct dehydrogenation of CH3OH (Eq. 2) is a favorable route which results in water-free CH2O. Moreover, H2 as a second valuable product is obtained, of which the annual demand is predicted to increase from ca. 90 Mt in 2020 to ca. 210 Mt in 2030 in order to meet the goals of the Net Zero Emissions Scenario.14 Recently, a techno-economical evaluation and carbon footprint of the routes for the production of OME starting from CO2 and H2 have been assessed.15 It was demonstrated that the production routes based on anhydrous CH2O have a higher energy efficiency in comparison to the routes based on the application of aqueous CH2O solutions due to the possible reutilization of the coupled product H2 (Eq. 2) for the synthesis of CH3OH.
Previously studied catalysts for the dehydrogenation of methanol are mostly based on transition metals such as silver, zinc and copper. Among other elements, sodium-based catalysts have demonstrated high activity at high temperatures (650-900 °C).16, 17 In the last decade, Mo-containing compounds such as CaMoO418 and Ce2(MoO4)3)19 as well as solid acids (hydrogen titanium phosphate sulfate, H1-xTi2(PO4)3-x(SO4)x, x=0.5–1)20 have been reported as catalysts for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of CH3OH. Both high catalytic activity combined with high selectivity and catalyst stability were claimed. However, the production of anhydrous CH2O has still not been industrially established, and the development of new catalytic systems with better catalytic performance remains highly relevant.
Among the metals of group 13 (Al, Ga, In), In is documented as a potential catalyst. In the molten form it reached the highest selectivity towards CH2O.21 In another study, In2O3 displayed a selectivity of 86.0 % towards CH2O at 10.7 % CH3OH conversion.22 Additionally, as a promotor, In can enhance the selectivity to CH2O over Na2CO3.23 In contrast, Al2O3 favors CH3OH dehydration to dimethyl ether (DME) due to the presence of acidic sites.24
Up to now, Ga-based catalysts have been frequently studied for the aromatization (Cyclar process over Ga/H-ZSM-5)25 and dehydrogenation of alkanes such as propane,26-30 the conversion of CH3OH to hydrocarbons,31 CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH,32, 33 and steam reforming of CH3OH (MSR).34 In particular, Ga2O3 was investigated for the selective oxidation of CH3OH at 300 °C. In this reaction it showed similar behavior as Al2O3, exhibiting 100 % selectivity to DME, which was attributed to the Lewis acidity of these oxides.35 In a study by Freeman et al.31 devoted to the conversion of CH3OH to hydrocarbons, it was demonstrated that Ga2O3 is almost inert for the conversion of CH3OH at 400 °C (WHSV=0.7 h−1). In contrast, recently Izzo et al.36 showed that bulk Ga2O3 can effectively catalyze the dehydrogenation of primary and secondary alcohols and, according to their DFT calculations, this reaction pathway is preferred over alcohol dehydration. It was suggested that this is due to the weaker acidity of Ga2O3 in comparison to Al2O3. However, under the applied reaction conditions in that study (400 °C, residence time of 1 s) the main products were found to be H2, DME, CO2 and CO. To the best of our knowledge, till now no other reports on the production of anhydrous CH2O at T >400 °C over Ga-based catalysts have been published. Here, we report on the high activity of Ga2O3 at T≥500 °C for the non-oxidative CH3OH dehydrogenation to anhydrous CH2O.
Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the conversion of CH3OH and the corresponding yields of the products applying β-Ga2O3 as a catalyst during a first quasi steady-state screening by heating with a linear heating rate of 2 °C min−1 in a reaction mixture containing 2.6 % CH3OH in N2. The tendency towards either dehydration or dehydrogenation of CH3OH is dependent on temperature. At temperatures below 415 °C DME is the main product originating from dehydration with a light-off temperature around 280 °C and a maximum DME yield (Y(DME)) of 23 % at 400 °C. The endothermic dehydrogenation route leading to the production of CH2O has a light-off temperature of around 300 °C and dominates at temperatures above 500 °C. In this region, the maximum CH2O yield (Y(CH2O)) of 42 % at a methanol conversion (X(CH3OH)) of 51 % was observed at 500 °C and 650 °C with a decrease in X(CH3OH) and Y(CH2O) to 28 % at 560 °C, which may result from the superposition of deactivation and structural changes during the temperature-programmed experiment and the faster dehydrogenation rate at higher temperatures. Over the whole investigated temperature range the calculated maximum possible conversion according to the thermodynamic dehydrogenation equilibrium for the applied methanol concentration was significantly higher than the experimentally obtained values, confirming that the reaction was not limited by thermodynamics. In this temperature range no detectable conversion was observed in the absence of Ga2O3 over a catalyst bed formed by SiC, and the C-balance was in the range of 98–104 %.

Light-off curve for Ga2O3 in 2.6 % CH3OH/N2 recorded with a heating ramp of 2 °C min−1. The filled symbols show the degree of conversion and product yields, which were evaluated based on the experimentally measured effluent mole fractions of CH3OH and the products CH2O, CO, CO2, DME, CH4, H2O, H2. H2 was detected using a GC equipped with a TCD, whereas all other products were detected using online FTIR analytics. The open symbols correspond to the theoretically calculated yields of H2 and H2O and to the corresponding O- and H-balances, which were all evaluated based on the stoichiometry of the reactions (2)–(5). The overlap of the experimental and calculated Y(H2O) and Y(H2) confirms the impact of the suggested side reactions (2)–(5) and verifies the calculated values of Y(H2) over the whole temperature range. The equilibrium conversion of CH3OH (X(CH3OH)eq) in the dehydrogenation reaction (Eq. 2) with a feed gas mixture of 2.6 % CH3OH/N2 is plotted for comparison.
Other detected carbon-containing products in the lower temperature region (280-500 °C) were CO and CO2 with a maximum CO yield (Y(CO)=12 %) and CO2 yield (Y(CO2)=11 %) at 420 °C and 400 °C, respectively. Also, a small amount of methyl formate (MF) was observed (Y(MF)=4.5 % at 430 °C). This product distribution is in line with previous studies on methanol decomposition over β-Ga2O3 at 400 °C reported by Izzo et al.36 In addition to DME, they also detected carbon oxides in the product stream, which was explained by the decomposition of either CH2O to CO and H2 and of MF to CO2 and CH4. The reported conversion was higher (>95 %) despite the higher methanol concentration in the feed stream (18 %) due to the higher catalyst amount (1 g vs. 50 mg) and the longer residence time (1 s vs. <0.11 s) in comparison to the reaction conditions in this study. These differences may also be a reason for the considerable differences in CH2O yield, since CH2O is known to decompose at long contact times.37
In our study, the observed decrease in COx yield despite the simultaneous increase in CH2O yield together with the absence of CH4 production at T below 415 °C suggests that COx is formed in parallel and not in a consecutive reaction by CH2O decomposition. Thus, we suggest that the reaction of CH3OH with H2O originating from the dehydration reaction (3) causes the formation of CO2 (methanol steam reforming, MSR, (Eq. 4). CO may also be a direct product of methanol decomposition (Eq. 5) or a result of the reverse water gas shift (rWGS) reaction. The yields of H2 and H2O calculated based on the stoichiometry of the discussed reactions (2)–(5) are in good agreement with the experimental data (Figure 1) where the resulting O- and H-balances between 100–104 % confirm the contribution of the proposed side reactions (Eqs. (3–5)).
Among the other by-products, MF was detected as an intermediate product of MSR in the middle temperature range between 400 °C and 500 °C when the dehydration pathway becomes less favored. This may be correlated with a higher amount of surface CH3O and HCOO species in the absence of H2O, resulting in a higher concentration of MF in the gas phase.34 At higher temperatures (T>600 °C) the yields of CO and CH4 increase probably due to the thermal decomposition of CH2O and as a result of deoxygenation of CH3OH, respectively. The latter reaction may be facilitated in the presence of oxygen-vacancies produced on Ga2O3 at high temperatures under reductive reaction conditions38 analogous to the increased methane selectivity (S(CH4)) due to methanol decomposition over reduced oxygen-deficient TiO2 surfaces.39 This also correlates with the detection of CH4 in the product stream at T>400 °C where the amount of H2O decreases, thus becoming insufficient for possible fast quenching of the formed oxygen vacancies. Furthermore, the formation of other light hydrocarbons (C2H6 and C2H4) was observed starting at T>400 °C. As their yields are <0.2 % being significantly lower in comparison to the yields of other by-products, they are not discussed further.
It is worth noting that the pretreatment of Ga2O3 at 550 °C and 650 °C in a reducing atmosphere (5 % H2/N2) prior to the heating rate experiment did not influence the catalytic performance in the high temperature region but had an impact on methanol dehydration activity at T<450 °C, decreasing the yields of DME, CO and CO2 (Figure S1). This change may be attributed to the partial reduction of Ga2O3 and formation of oxygen vacancies during the pretreatment. In our further tests, Ga2O3 was kept for 1 h at reaction temperature in N2 before the reaction was started, and no further pretreatment was applied.
The catalytic activity of Ga2O3 was further studied in long-term experiments for 300 min at constant temperatures of 500 °C, 550 °C and 650 °C. Figure 2 and Figure S2 display the changes of conversion, selectivities and yields with TOS for the reaction at 550 °C. The analogous plots for the reaction at 500 °C and 650 °C are shown in Figure S3. For all studied reaction temperatures X(CH3OH) decreased severely during 300 min TOS: it decreased from 65 % to 10 % at 500 °C, from 72 % to 11 % at 550 °C, and from 84 % to 37 % at 650 °C. In general, the selectivity to CH2O was higher at lower conversion obtained with the deactivated catalyst in comparison to the initial values after 2 min TOS and reached a maximum of 95 % at both 500 °C and 550 °C after 300 min TOS. Since CH2O was the main product, Y(CH2O) was decreasing in parallel with decreasing conversion, whereas S(CH2O) was relatively stable after the first hour TOS. The formation of the by-products decreased significantly in comparison to the initial values, and CH4 was detected as the main by-product at all temperatures.

The error bars represent the standard deviation of five adjacent data points, which were recorded within 2.5 min of reaction time.
The results of the temperature variation experiments are summarized in Figure 3. The initial conversion (2 min TOS) increased with increasing temperature from 65 % at 500 °C to 84 % at 650 °C. The initial selectivity to CH2O was the highest (77 %) at 550 °C and decreased in favor of DME and MF at 500 °C, and of CH4 at 650 °C, which is consistent with the heating rate experiment (Figure 1). The selectivities towards CO and CO2 at 2 min TOS fluctuated in the range of 6–10 % and 6–8 %, respectively, and were slightly lower at 550 °C in comparison to the other temperatures. Additionally, the activity of Ga2O3 was compared with Na2CO3, which was chosen as a reference catalyst for non-oxidative methanol dehydrogenation as one of the most available, stable and highly active catalysts known for this reaction.16, 23, 40 The obtained conversion of 25 % and CH2O productivity of 2.7 gCH2O gcat−1 h−1 after 2 min TOS at 650 °C (Table 1) are significantly lower in comparison to Ga2O3. The obtained results with Na2CO3 as a catalyst are in good agreement with the literature data, where only CH4 and CO were detected as by-products16 and S(CH2O)=90 % was reported at a conversion of 20–30 % (650 °C, residence time of 0.4 s). In our study, S(CH2O) was in the range of 60–90 % at a conversion between ∼20-30 % (650 °C, residence time of 0.08 s) depending on the TOS (Figure S4a).

The comparison of the deactivation rates rd (Table 1) shows that rapid deactivation occurred during the first 10 min TOS, and this initial deactivation strongly depends on the reaction temperature being the highest for 650 °C. In the next 290 min the decrease of conversion slowed down which can clearly be observed in Figure S5a. Interestingly, there is only a slight difference in the deactivation rates at 500 °C and 550 °C, but the rate of deactivation at 650 °C in this range of TOS is significantly lower compared with the other temperatures.
The initial activity (conversion, product distribution, productivity) was successfully regenerated by an oxidative treatment (TPO in 2.5 % O2/N2) after reactions at 500 °C and 550 °C. This reversibility of the deactivation as well as the collected Raman spectra of the used samples (Figure S6b) confirm the formation of carbon deposits on the catalyst active sites that can be removed by treatment with O2. In contrast, irreversible deactivation occurred at 650 °C leading to a lower methanol conversion and CH2O productivity after the TPO experiment. The irreversible deactivation can be related to the formation of volatile Ga(I) species such as Ga2O41 under the strongly reducing reaction conditions at high temperatures. This assumption is in line with the formation of solid deposits downstream of the catalyst bed in the colder zone of the reactor (140-550 °C) found after the reaction at 650 °C. The XRD patterns of the collected deposits are displayed in Figure S7 and confirm that they consist of Ga2O3, which may originate from the disproportionation of unstable Ga2O to Ga and Ga2O3.41 However, the formation of volatile organogallium compounds in the presence of CH3OH cannot be ruled out. Formation of volatile methoxy species is considered as a reason for the deactivation of Mo-containing catalysts in the Formox process.42 During the reaction run after regeneration by TPO the same tendency was found for the deactivation rates in the first 10 min TOS as for the reaction over the fresh catalysts, whereas a similar deactivation rate was observed after 10 min TOS for all the reaction temperatures (Figure S5b).
A TPR measurement was performed to further investigate the reducibility of the applied Ga2O3 and did not reveal any detectable H2 consumption during the heating up to 650 °C (Figure S8d). This is in contrast with TPR measurements by Wachs and coworkers35 who report an onset reduction temperature as low as 320 °C for Ga2O3, but in agreement with observations by Behrens et al.43 concerning the lack of H2 consumption in the H2 TPR profiles for crystalline α-Ga2O3 and β-Ga2O3 in comparison to γ-Ga2O3, which was ascribed to a more disordered structure and higher specific surface area of this polymorph. In a very recent study by Castro-Fernández et al.44 the influence of disorder on the reducibility of the surface was extended to the reducibility of the bulk of the poorly crystalline γ-Ga2O3. It is suggested that the disorder of the bulk of this polymorph leads to a higher mobility of bulk defects such as cationic and oxygen vacancies. Thus, surface defects created by reaction with H2 can more easily move into the bulk.44 Therefore, it can be concluded that reduction and volatilization of only a relatively small part of Ga2O3 occurs under reaction conditions at 650 °C.
In situ Raman measurements were performed to study the influence of a reducing atmosphere on the structure of the catalyst. Ga2O3 was heated in 1 % H2/N2 (50 STP mL min−1) to various temperatures with 20 °C min−1. Subsequently, the sample was cooled quickly, and a spectrum was recorded at room temperature to avoid any possible temperature influences on the bands shown in Figure S8f. It is obvious that the catalyst structure, reflected in an increasing fluorescence background, is affected starting at temperatures above ∼400 °C. This effect becomes especially pronounced at temperatures where the dehydrogenation reaction is dominant (500–650 °C). The original state of the material can be retrieved by heating in 1 % O2/N2 (Figure S8g), suggesting the formation of oxygen vacancies and their refilling in O2.
In order to investigate the carbon deposits, temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) was applied. Figure 4 shows the CO2 release due to the total oxidation of the carbon deposits on the catalyst after 300 min TOS at 500 °C, 550 °C, and 650 °C. Additionally, CO was detected in the effluent flow during the TPO experiment (Figure S9). H2O was not formed in a significant amount during the TPO experiments, and the concentration was lower than the detection limit for the applied settings for the used FTIR analytics (<0.02 mol%), indicating a very low hydrogen content of the carbon deposits formed at high reaction temperatures. The recorded CO2 traces show two major peaks, of which the first one is in the region between 470–655 °C depending on the applied reaction temperature and originates from the oxidation of carbon deposits on the catalyst. The CO2 release at temperatures above 650 °C may be explained by the oxidation of carbon deposits formed during reaction on residues originating from vaporized catalyst located downstream in the cooler zone of the reactor. The broad peak at 750 °C may originate either from carbon deposits in the cooler reactor zones or from combustion of the slight contamination of commercial SiC as indicated by the results of the blank test in the reactor filled only with SiC. Therefore, the range above 700 °C was not considered during the further evaluation of the amount of deposited carbon.

Effluent mole fraction of CO2 during the regeneration by TPO after performing methanol dehydrogenation for 300 min TOS at 500 °C, 550 °C and 650 °C.
The comparison of the carbon amount burned off during these measurements normalized to the mass of the catalyst (Table 1) reveals that a higher reaction temperature favors carbon formation. According to the TPO measurements, the amount of carbon increases in the order 500 °C<550 °C<650 °C and is approximately twice as high at 650 °C as at 500 °C. In contrast, the amount of carbon divided by the amount of converted CH3OH (assigned as Stot(C) in Table 1) remains almost constant and is independent of the reaction temperature, demonstrating a correlation between the conversion of CH3OH and the amount of the deposits. The values of Stot(C) show that only a minor fraction (0.4-0.6 %) of the converted CH3OH molecules was transformed into carbon deposits even at 650 °C. Furthermore, the maximum of the CO2 release shifts towards higher temperatures with increasing reaction temperature. In summary, higher temperatures are required for the combustion of carbon deposits formed at higher reaction temperatures, which is caused by an increasing stability of the carbon deposits.
To confirm the formation of the carbon deposits and to investigate their nature, Raman spectra of the used catalysts were recorded (Figure 5), which show bands characteristic for defect-rich carbon materials.46 The normalized and deconvoluted spectra of the region between 930 and 2000 cm−1 are shown in Figure 5. Two intense bands at ∼1330 cm−1 (D1 band) and ∼1595 cm−1 (G band) are typical for carbon deposits, which were also observed in other dehydrogenation studies with Ga-containing catalysts29, 30, 45 and indicate the presence of disordered graphitic carbon. The deconvolution procedure (Table S1) revealed additional bands related to amorphous carbon (D3 at ∼1530 cm−1) and carbon with a disordered graphitic lattice (D4 at ∼1180 cm−1). Due to the different nature of the deposits resulting in the D1 and G modes, the ratio of their intensities (D1/G) can be used for the evaluation of the degree of disorder of the carbon deposits.29, 45 For the catalyst after reaction at 650 °C a slightly higher D1/G ratio of ∼1.6 was obtained in comparison to the other reaction temperatures (∼1.4). The change in the FWHM for the D1 band was more pronounced, of which the narrowing at increasing reaction temperatures can be explained by the development of more ordered carbon deposits with less defects, which correlates with the higher combustion temperatures.47 Additionally, the effect of the GHSV on the catalytic performance of Ga2O3 at 550 °C was examined and results are summarized in Figure 6 and included in Table 1. The conversion after 2 min TOS increased slightly from 72 % at 45500 h−1 (residence time of 0.079 s) to 77 % at 33400 h−1 (residence time of 0.108 s). This change in conversion affects the product distribution (Figure S10).

Comparison of conversion, selectivities (▪ S(CH4), ▪S(DME), ▪S(CH2O), ▪S (CO2), ▪S(MF), ▪S(CO)) and CH2O productivity at 550 °C after 2 min and 300 min TOS upon variation of the GHSV (45500, 39400 and 33400 h−1).
Additionally, the effect of the GHSV on the catalytic performance of Ga2O3 at 550 °C was examined and results are summarized in Figure 6 and included in Table 1. The conversion after 2 min TOS increased slightly from 72 % at 45500 h−1 (residence time of 0.079 s) to 77 % at 33400 h−1 (residence time of 0.108 s). This change in conversion affects the product distribution (Figure S10). When conversion increased from 72 % to 77 %, S(CH2O) dropped from 77 % to 68 % favoring S(CO), S(CO2), S(CH4), which rose from 6 % to 10 %. Accordingly, this trend led to a decrease in the productivity to CH2O (Figure 6, Table 1). The favored decomposition of CH2O to CO and H2 at longer residence time as well as the required high GHSV for the production of CH2O in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of CH3OH are in agreement with studies concerning other catalysts.37, 49 S(DME) and S(MF) remained constant in the investigated range of residence times. After 300 min TOS conversion had decreased significantly for all space velocities, but the lower productivity to CH2O at higher residence time was still observed. Typically, S(CH2O) increased upon further deactivation, which was also observed during the temperature variation experiments (Figure 3). When comparing the deactivation rates in the first 10 min TOS (Table 1), it can be concluded that the most rapid deactivation occurs at lower space velocities during the first 10 min TOS. However, the subsequent deactivation between 10 min and 300 min TOS is independent of the applied GHSV (Figure S11).
To compare the amount of carbon which had been deposited during 300 min TOS while performing methanol dehydrogenation at different GHSVs, TPO measurements using the spent catalysts were recorded (Figure S12). In every TPO profile, two peaks were observed as in the case of the TPO profiles recorded after 300 min TOS at different reaction temperatures. The position of the peak that was related to the burning-off of the carbon deposits (520 °C) shifted to slightly higher temperatures at a GHSV of 45500 h−1 in comparison with the lower GHSV. In contrast to the effect of temperature, no significant changes in the nature of the carbon deposits and their amount due to different residence times were observed (Table 1).
Based on the results obtained during the heating rate experiment (Figure 1) the possible reaction pathways under the conditions of the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of CH3OH over β-Ga2O3 are summarized in Scheme 1. The reaction temperature has a significant effect on the product distribution shifting from the dominant dehydration and steam reforming of CH3OH at T<500 °C towards the dehydrogenation to CH2O at 500 °C≤T<630 °C. The further increase of temperature leads, in turn, to an enhanced formation of CH4 and CO presumably due to the deoxygenation of CH3OH and decarbonylation (decomposition) of CH2O.

Proposed reaction network for methanol dehydrogenation catalyzed over β-Ga2O3.
The ability of pure Ga2O3 to catalyze methanol decomposition to CO and CO2 has been studied extensively and Pd/Ga2O3 is a well-established catalyst for this process.50, 51 In the presence of Pd (or a PdGa alloy) the temperature for methanol decomposition is reduced in comparison with pure Ga2O3.34, 51 Pd is suggested to play the role of a sink for atomic hydrogen by spillover and/or to facilitate the formation of surface formates (HCOO, especially monodentate formates), which are regarded as intermediates to CO2 under MSR conditions in the presence of H2O.34 The formation of the latter species are supposed to be enhanced by activation of surface oxygen from Ga2O3 during alloy formation with Pd after high-temperature reductive pretreatment as confirmed by temperature-programmed surface reaction studies.34 Collins et al.50 suggested that formate species on Ga2O3 decompose either to CO and OHads or to CO2 and Hads, leading to the formation of an oxygen vacancy in case of CO2. The transformation of surface methoxy species to surface formates over pure Ga2O3 begins at temperatures of around 300 °C34 and is in good agreement with our detection of CO and CO2 at temperatures above 350 °C in the discussed heating rate experiment.
When applying Ga2O3 in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of CH3OH at high temperatures (T≥500 °C), possible partial reduction of the oxide, formation of oxygen vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated Ga sites (cus-Ga) under the strongly reducing atmosphere need to be considered. Recently, Castro-Fernández et al.30 demonstrated that the coordination of Ga surface sites effects the activity of Ga2O3 in propane dehydrogenation by comparing α-, β-, and γ-Ga2O3. The investigated polymorphs contain tetra-, penta- and tri-coordinated Lewis acidic sites which were shown to display different acidity strengths. The higher catalytic activity of β-Ga2O3 for propane dehydrogenation was correlated with the presence of weakly acidic tri-coordinated Ga3+ sites. According to Collins et al.50, 25 % less CH3OH is chemisorbed on Ga2O3 after a pretreatment in H2 in comparison to a pretreatment in O2. This was translated into a decreased density of active sites for CH3OH adsorption and formation of methoxy species that lead to DME, which correlates with the lower yields of this product in the heating rate experiments after pre-reduction in 5 % H2/N2 at 550 °C and 650 °C compared with the unpretreated sample (Figure S1). The effect is more pronounced at higher reduction temperature of 650 °C, which is in line with the higher amount of cus-Ga sites and oxygen vacancies after reduction in H2 at higher temperatures reported by Jochum et al.38 In that study it was also demonstrated that the produced oxygen vacancies on Ga2O3 can be replenished in the presence of (even traces of) H2O under reaction conditions. Therefore, it can be expected that oxygen vacancies created upon reduction during a pretreatment in H2 disappear by reacting with H2O generated during methanol dehydration in the low temperature range of the heating rate experiment.38, 50 As a result, in the higher temperature range of the heating rate experiment no effects of pre-reduction can be observed. In another study it was shown by means of FTIR spectroscopy that reduction of Ga2O3 at 400 °C does not influence the surface species, which are formed during the following exposure to methanol at low temperature in comparison to the sample reduced at 100 °C, and neither was the evolution of those surface species during subsequent heating affected.34 Thus, we conclude that pre-reduction only reduces the density of active sites for the lower temperature processes temporarily, since they are replenished by H2O which is formed by dehydration at lower temperatures. The type of intermediate species and the mechanism under steady-state conditions are supposedly not affected when the transformations due to changes in the oxidation potential of the atmosphere occur relatively fast. However, they can be expected to be highly dependent on temperature. For instance, Wachs and coworkers35 report that surface methoxy species on Ga2O3 decompose already at 171 °C, whereas the spectroscopic studies by Haghofer et al.34 point out remarkable stability of these species at β-Ga2O3 up to 400 °C. Additionally, Copéret52 discussed the activation of alkanes during dehydrogenation at high temperatures over Ga-containing catalysts through alkyl and alkoxy intermediates.
As was shown in the long-term experiments at 500 °C, 550 °C and 650 °C, Ga2O3 suffers from the rapid deactivation during the first 300 min TOS (Table 1, Figure 3, Figure S5). This deactivation was attributed firstly to the formation of carbon deposits as confirmed by Raman spectroscopy (Figure 5) and the TPO measurements (Figure 4) for the spent catalyst. Another possible reason for catalyst deactivation is the formation of oxygen vacancies and Ga−H species due to the presence of H2.38 During the catalyst reduction in 1 % H2/N2 (Figure S1f) and the catalyst reoxidation in 1 % O2/N2 (Figure S1g) changes in the background of the in situ collected Raman spectra were observed in our studies. In the early years of the development of in situ and operando Raman spectroscopy, Wachs and Weckhuysen53 pointed out that these techniques can suffer from fluorescence under reaction conditions, especially in the absence of oxygen in the gas phase, which can complicate interpretation. In our study, we clearly observe a trend for the treatment with H2 at higher temperatures leading to an increasing shift in the baseline of the spectra. Baseline phenomena in Raman spectroscopy are in general due to the occurrence of fluorescence/luminescence. In our case, the baseline increased monotonously with increasing Raman shift in the range of 100–1750 cm−1. Since the excitation was performed with a green laser (532 nm), the corresponding absolute wavelength range is 535–587 nm. Thus, the Raman spectra were measured on the low energy side flank of a red fluorescence emission, the intensity of which is increasing with temperature in H2. In literature, the presence of red luminescence has been related to oxygen vacancies,54 but also recently to hydrogen dissolved in Ga2O3.55 Bulk processes are indeed involved, because this luminescence can only be removed by annealing in O2 at 650 °C. Dong et al.56 performed calculations describing the formation of oxygen vacancies on Ga2O3 as a function of oxygen treatment and concluded that the presence of oxygen increases their formation energy. The according disappearance of oxygen vacancies upon oxygen treatment was corroborated by experimental fluorescence spectra that showed a corresponding decrease in intensity. We therefore tentatively ascribe the increase in fluorescence upon thermal treatment in a reducing atmosphere to the formation of oxygen vacancies, which can be refilled by an O2 treatment. These oxygen vacancies are likely to play a role in the high temperature dehydrogenation reaction. Recently, calculations also showed that several types of oxygen vacancies can exist on various Ga2O3 terminations,57 all of which can be relevant catalytic active sites during the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of CH3OH.
Conclusion
Highly attractive catalytic properties of β-Ga2O3 were identified under the conditions of non-oxidative dehydrogenation of CH3OH: whereas in the temperature range from 280 °C to 500 °C, Ga2O3 catalyzed the dehydration of CH3OH to dimethyl ether as well as the formation of CO2, methyl formate, and CO, the dehydrogenation to CH2O was favored between 500 °C and 650 °C. At 550 °C, a CH2O selectivity of 77 % at a CH3OH conversion of 72 % was obtained after 2 min, which corresponds to a CH2O productivity of 6.8 gCH2O gcat−1 h−1. With increasing temperature, the initial conversion after 2 min time on stream increased from 65 % at 500 °C to 84 % at 650 °C. The CH2O selectivity amounted to 70 % at 500 °C and 68 % at 650 °C decreasing at expense of dimethyl ether and methane, respectively. The variation of the feed flow rate at 550 °C showed that the decrease in the GHSV from 45500 h−1 to 33400 h−1 led to an increase in CH3OH conversion from 72 % to 77 % with a drop in CH2O selectivity from 77 % to 68 % in favor of CH4, CO and CO2. The long-term experiments at 500 °C, 550 °C and 650 °C revealed a significant deactivation of the catalyst during the first 300 min TOS. The initial activity was successfully regenerated by an oxidative treatment in 2.5 % O2/N2 after the reactions at 500 °C and 550 °C. In contrast, irreversible deactivation occurred during the reaction at 650 °C, caused by partial volatilization of Ga2O3. The deposition of carbon was identified as another reason for the observed deactivation. These carbon deposits had a low hydrogen content and a high degree of graphitization demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy. The performed TPO measurements showed an increase of the stability of the carbon deposits with increasing reaction temperatures, whereas the variation of GHSV did not significantly affect the combustion temperature of the formed deposits. The changes in the structure of Ga2O3 under the reducing reaction conditions were confirmed by in situ Raman spectroscopy, which were retrieved after the subsequent oxidative treatment and assigned to the formation of oxygen vacancies, which may also have an impact on catalyst deactivation. In summary, this study introduces the application of Ga2O3-based catalysts in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol to water-free formaldehyde with high yields and provides first insights in their further development including their oxidative regeneration.
Experimental Section
Materials. Gallium (III) oxide (Ga2O3, 99.99 %) was obtained from ChemPur. Methanol (CH3OH, VWR, AnalaR NORMAPUR) was degassed by helium purging and used without further purification. Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) was prepared by calcination of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) in synthetic air by heating to 250 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1 and holding for 90 min.
Calculation of the equilibrium conversion. The CHEMCAD software by Chemstations Inc. was used to calculate the equilibrium conversion of methanol in the dehydrogenation reaction (CH3OH⇌CH2O+H2) in the temperature range of 100 to 900 °C and atmospheric pressure for the typical feed gas mixture (2.6 % CH3OH/ N2).
Catalyst characterization
N2 physisorption measurements were performed using a BELSORP-mini II gas sorption analyzer. Prior to the measurement, the sample cells were evacuated and heated to 200 °C for degassing (holding time 3 h). During the analysis, both adsorption and desorption isotherms were recorded. The surface areas were derived using the BET method. The total pore volume and pore size distribution were calculated using the BJH method.
X-ray diffractograms were recorded at room temperature in the 2θ range from 5° to 80° with a step width of 0.03° using a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (1.5406 Å). For analysis of the recorded XRD data, the reference patterns of Crystallography Open Database (COD) were used.
ICP-MS elemental analysis was performed by a ThermoFischer iCAP RQ ICP-MS device. Before the measurement the sample was digested in HNO3 (Carl Roth, Supra, 69 %) using a microwave digestion system Anton Paar Multiwave Pro.
Raman spectra were recorded to study the structure of applied Ga2O3 and the nature of the carbon deposits on the used catalyst using a LabRAM HR Evolution spectrometer (Horiba). The measurements were performed at room temperature using a green laser (Oxxius, 532 nm, 100 mW) applying 5 % laser power for 300 s and 4 accumulations. For the deconvolution of the bands of the coke deposits in the region between 930 and 2000 cm−1, the spectra were baseline-corrected applying anchor points at 930, 1800, 2000 cm−1, and the spectra were normalized with respect to the G band. The resulting peaks were fit using Gaussian peak shapes. The deconvolution analysis was performed with Fityk data analysis software.58
In situ Raman spectra were recorded using a commercial in situ Raman cell (Linkam CCR1000) connected to a home-made gas dosing system, which supplied N2, H2/N2 and O2/N2 (99.999 %, Air Liquide).
H2 TPR was performed using a self-built apparatus equipped with a TCD detector. For the analysis, approximately 280 mg sample was treated with 84.1 mL min−1 flow of 4.6 % H2 (99.999 %, Air Liquide) in Ar (99.999 %, Air Liquide), while the temperature was increased to 650 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The final temperature was held for 1 h.
NH3 TPD experiment was performed with ca. 100 mg after pretreated by heating to 500 °C in the flow of 50 STP mL min−1 He with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 and hold time of 1 h. Afterwards, the sample was cooled to 100 °C and exposed to a flow of 50 STP mL min−1 of 10 % NH3 (99.999 %) in He (99.999 %, Air Liquide) for 1 h with a subsequent purging with 50 STP mL min−1 He for 2 h. The desorption profile was collected while heating in He from 100 to 650 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
Catalytic tests
The catalytic performance in methanol dehydrogenation was investigated in a home-made laboratory setup equipped with a tubular quartz fixed-bed reactor (ID 9 mm, OD 12 mm). The temperature inside the catalyst bed was measured with a thermoelement protected by a quartz sleeve (ID 0.5 mm, OD 3 mm). In a typical test 50 mg of the catalyst (sieve fraction of 250–355 μm) was diluted with 450 mg SiC resulting in a length of the catalyst bed of around 7 mm and a volume of 0.4 cm3. For the catalytic test the catalyst was placed between two plugs of quartz wool (Carl Roth) in the isothermal zone (deterFtmined to be appr. 15 mm) of the reactor furnace. CH3OH was supplied using a dual-piston HPLC pump (Shimadzu LC20AD) and a quartz evaporator that was heated to 140 °C. The dosed amount of methanol as a function of time was measured using a balance (Sartorius Cubis MSE). N2 (99.999 %, Air Liquide) used as a carrier and dilutant gas was passed through oxygen and moisture traps for additional purification. The effluent product stream was analyzed using a process-gas FTIR spectrometer (Nicolet iS50, ThermoFisher Scientific) equipped with a gold-coated heated gas cell (T=140 °C, L=150 mm, V=7.5 mL) and a DLaTGS detector. The following parameters for recording of the spectra in this study were applied: spectral range 4000–650 cm−1, resolution 4 cm−1, number of scans 25, acceleration 8, optical velocity 0.6329, slit 230, time for recording one spectrum 30 s. The quantitative analysis was based on the classical least square method (CLS) using TQAnalyst software (ThermoFisher Scientific). Additionally, a gas chromatograph (GC) was used to confirm the composition of the product stream and quantify H2. The GC consisted of two Shimadzu GC-2014 ovens, TCD and FID detectors and was equipped with a Porapak Q, Porapak N and a Molsieve 5 A column for the separation of gaseous products. Examples of typical IR spectra and GC chromatograms recorded during a heating rate experiment are shown in Figure S13.
Light-off experiment. The catalyst was heated at atmospheric pressure in 2.6 % CH3OH/N2 (unless specified otherwise 300 STP mL min−1, resulting in a GHSV of 45500 h−1) from 140 °C to 650 °C with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1. In a typical experiment, the sample was kept in N2 (200 STP mL min−1) for 1 h at 140 °C before starting the reaction procedure. For studies on the influence of a reductive pretreatment the sample was kept at 550 °C or 650 °C in 5 % H2/N2 (99.999 %, Air Liquide) (200 STP mL min−1) for 1 h with a subsequent cooling to 180 °C in 200 STP mL min−1 N2.
Long-term experiment. The catalyst was heated with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 in 200 STP mL min−1 N2 to the reaction temperature (500, 550 or 650 °C) at which it was held for 300 min in 2.6 % CH3OH/N2 (300 STP mL min−1) at atmospheric pressure.
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). After performing the reaction, the catalyst was cooled to 180 °C and then heated to 860 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 in a flow of 2.5 % O2 in N2 (60 STP mL min−1).
Evaluation of the catalytic performance. In all experiments diluted CH3OH was applied (<3% CH3OH/N2), and therefore the total flow was considered as constant during the experiment. Accordingly, the conversion X(CH3OH) Eq. (6), product selectivities S(i) Eq. (7), yields Y(i) Eq. (8)–(10), CH2O productivity Eq. (11), and C-balance Eq. (12) were calculated as follows (y(i) – the mole fraction of the component i in the effluent flow, N(C)i – the number of carbon atoms in the component i, – the molar flow of CH2O (mol min−1)):
