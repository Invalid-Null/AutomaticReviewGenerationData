1. Introduction
In the chemical industry, propene is a widely used starting material for the production of polymers, oxygenates, and valuable chemical intermediates [1]. Large volumes of propene have been produced by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. A steady increase in demand for propene over the past decade has made propene-selective processes necessary because conventional processes yield a mixture of olefins [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. In terms of the exclusive selectivity towards propene, the direct propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process has attracted attention in recent years. Moreover, the PDH process has the advantage of using a more economical feedstock, propane. The profitability of the PDH process is based on the price gap between propane and propene and high availability of cheap propane from shale resources. These facts further motivate research on PDH.
The non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (C3H8 ↔ C3H6 + H2) is a highly endothermic and thermodynamically limited reaction. Thus, the PDH process requires high reaction temperatures above 550 ℃ to provide a sufficient equilibrium conversion at ambient pressure [3,5]. The high operating temperature in the PDH process causes several issues, including severe coke deposition by the deep dehydrogenation of propane and agglomeration or sintering of active phases [6]. As a result, PDH catalysts rapidly lose their activity and they must be periodically regenerated after the short-time reaction [3,7,8]. There are two types of catalysts that have been used in commercial PDH processes: Pt-Sn/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3 [3,[7], [8], [9], [10]]. Despite the high activity and selectivity of these catalysts, the high cost of Pt and the severe toxicity of the Cr6+ species require the development of alternative catalysts that have economic and environmental benefits.
The catalytic performances for the dehydrogenation of light alkanes have been reported for many metal oxides [3,[11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]]. It is known that coordinatively unsaturated metal cations (Mcusx+) that are next to oxygen vacancies serve as adsorption sites for light alkanes. Surface oxygen sites act as hydrogen acceptors, abstracting hydrogen from the adsorbed alkane molecules. For easily reducible metal oxides, the number of Mcusx+ sites and thus their catalytic performances can be tuned by pretreatment using a reducing gas, such as H2 and CO. The superior performances of pretreated bulk WOx and FeOx/Al2O3 catalysts compared to fully oxidized catalysts have been reported in previous studies [11,20]. In addition to the partial reduction of metal oxides, Mcusx+ sites can be created by structural transformation when metal oxides are mixed together. Ga2O3-Al2O3 solid solutions, which have more coordinatively unsaturated Ga3+ cations, exhibited higher catalytic activity than γ-Ga2O3 in propane dehydrogenation [12].
Recently, a bulk ZrO2 catalyst has been reported to exhibit a high activity and selectivity in PDH [14,22,23]. A substitution of dopants with lower oxidation states or with different radii into ZrO2 lattice leads to structural transformation, creating defect sites [24,25]. The accompanied increase in the amount of Zrcus4+ cations and oxygen vacancies further improved catalytic performance of ZrO2-based catalysts for dehydrogenation of light alkanes [[25], [26], [27], [28]]. Vanadium oxide is known as an active catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes [[29], [30], [31], [32]]. In this study, we first demonstrated that vanadium can improve the catalytic performance of the ZrO2 catalyst by creating more active sites of Zrcus4+ cations. To identify the influence of the dopant content, a series of vanadium-doped ZrO2 metal oxides (VZrO-x) were prepared via the co-precipitation method. The physical and chemical properties of VZrO-x were systematically investigated by various techniques. The catalytic performances and recyclability of VZrO-x were compared to those of ZrO2 in the temperature range of 550–600 ℃. Moreover, the influence of H2 co-feeding on the deactivation rate of VZrO-x with the time-on-stream was investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
VZrO-x catalysts with various vanadium contents were prepared by the co-precipitation method. In a typical synthesis, specified amounts of ZrO(NO3)2∙xH2O (Sigma Aldrich, 99%) and VCl3 (Sigma Aldrich, 97%) were dissolved in 200 mL of deionized water to obtain a total cation concentration of 0.1 M. While vigorously stirring the solution at room temperature, an aqueous ammonia solution (Samchun Pure Chemical, 28–30 wt%) was added dropwise until the pH of 9 was reached. The solution was aged at 100 ℃ for 12 h under static conditions. Subsequently, the precipitate was filtered and washed several times with deionized water until the pH of 7 was attained. The precipitate was dried at 110 ℃ for 12 h and then calcined at 600 ℃ for 3 h. The obtained solid powders were labeled as VZrO-x, where x denotes the molar ratio of [V]/([Zr]+[V])
100 in the samples. Bulk ZrO2 and V2O5, reference catalysts, were synthesized via the same procedure except that only one precursor was used.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the VZrO-x catalysts were obtained on a Rigaku D/Max 2500-PC diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 100 mA with a Cu-Kα radiation source (λ =1.54 Å). The bulk compositions of the samples were determined by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on a SPECTRO ARCOS FHM22 spectrometer. Nitrogen physisorption was carried out at 77 K using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 system. The samples were pretreated under N2 flow at 150 ℃ for 12 h prior to the measurements. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas were calculated using data obtained over the relative pressure range of 0.05 ≤ p/p0 ≤ 0.2. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded on a JEOL JEM-2100 F transmission electron microscope at the Korea Basic Science Institute (Daegu, Korea). Raman spectra were obtained from the powder sample using WITec alpha 300 R confocal Raman microscope with a resolution of 1 cm−1 and an excitation wavelength of 532 nm.
H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was conducted on a BELCAT II. The sample was reduced in a stream of 5 vol% H2/Ar gas mixture (total 30 sccm) from room temperature to 750 ℃ at a heating rate of 5 ℃/min. The amount of consumed H2 was monitored using a thermal conducting detector (TCD). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV) under ultra-high vacuum at the Korea Basic Science Institute (Busan, Korea). The binding energies were referenced to the C 1s peak at 285.0 eV. Near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) studies were performed with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hν =1486.6 eV) at the Korea Basic Science Institute (Daejeon, Korea). Analysis of the sample was conducted at 500 ℃ while exposing the sample to O2 (1 mbar) or H2 (0.1 mbar).
Fourier transform infrared spectra of the adsorbed pyridine (Py-FTIR) were recorded on a Nicolet iS50 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a diffuse reflectance (DRIFT) cell (PIKE Technologies DiffuseIR™). Prior to pyridine adsorption, the sample was pretreated in a flow of 5 vol% H2 in Ar (total 100 sccm) at 550 ℃ for 1 h and then cooled to 50 ℃ in an Ar flow. After the pyridine vapor was introduced into the cell for 10 min, the sample was heated to 100 ℃ to remove the physisorbed pyridine, and FTIR spectra were then recorded at 100 ℃. Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) was conducted on a BELCAT II using a 200 mg sample. Prior to NH3-TPD, the sample was reduced in a stream of 10 vol% H2/He gas mixture (total 50 sccm) at 550 ℃ for 1 h. Next, the sample was cooled to 120 ℃ in a He flow. After the temperature was stabilized at 120 ℃, the pre-reduced sample was exposed to a 5 vol% NH3/He gas mixture (total 50 sccm) for 30 min and cooled to 80 ℃ in a He flow. The sample was then heated from 80 to 700 ℃ at a heating rate of 10 ℃/min in a He flow (30 sccm). The amount of ammonia desorbed from the sample was monitored with using mass spectrometry (MS). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a HITACHI STA 7300 using 20 mg of the spent sample. The sample was charged into sample pan and then heated to 600 ℃ at a heating rate of 5 ℃/min in an air flow (200 sccm).
2.3. Catalytic tests
The catalytic performances for PDH were evaluated at ambient pressure using a tubular fixed-bed quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 4 mm. The flow rates of each gas were regulated using calibrated mass flow controllers. The reaction temperature was measured with a type-K thermocouple positioned at the top of the catalyst bed inside the quartz reactor and controlled by a proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controller. The powder catalysts were pelletized to obtain a uniform grain size of 425–850
, and 200 mg of the catalyst was used for the performance tests. Prior to the reaction, the reactor was heated to the reaction temperature, which was 550 ℃, 575 ℃, or 600 ℃, under Ar flow for 1 h. Subsequently, the loaded catalyst was pretreated in a flow of 10 vol% H2/Ar gas mixture at the reaction temperature for 1 h. After purging the reactor with Ar for 15 min, a gas mixture of 8 sccm C3H8 and 52 sccm Ar (WHSVpropane =4.73 h−1) was introduced into the reactor to evaluate the catalytic performance. In the H2/C3H8 co-feed experiments, 8 sccm H2 was co-fed with 8 sccm C3H8 and 44 sccm Ar. The gas compositions of the reactant and products were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph (YL6500, Younglin Instrument Co., Korea) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The propane conversion (Xpropane), product selectivity (Si), and propene yield (Y) were calculated as follows:
where npropane is the number of moles of propane, ni is the number of moles of the C1-C3 products (CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and C3H6), ai is the number of carbon atoms in the corresponding product, and W is the weight of the catalyst. In the calculations, the conversion of propane to coke was not considered because the carbon balance was within
3% during the measurements.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural properties of the VZrO-x catalysts
Transition metal dopants can significantly affect the physico-chemical properties of ZrO2 [24]. The influence of the amount of vanadium dopant on the crystalline phase of VZrO-x, where x = [V]/([Zr]+[V])
100, was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD). Generally, pure ZrO2 has a monoclinic phase that is thermodynamically stable below 1175 ℃ [33]. As shown in Fig. 1, the synthesized ZrO2 clearly exhibited diffraction peaks at 2θ = 28.3° and 31.8°, corresponding to the monoclinic phase (●). Similar to pure ZrO2, VZrO-4 and VZrO-8 exhibited characteristics of the monoclinic phase. In addition, a small amount of vanadium dopant resulted in the appearance of additional peaks at 2θ = 30.3°, assigned to the tetragonal phase (○). Previous studies on ZrO2-based binary metal oxides have shown that the substitution of Zr4+ cations with dopant cations of different radii leads to the distortion of the ZrO2 lattice and thus transformation to a metastable tetragonal phase. In the process of stabilization to the tetragonal phase, they create oxygen vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated Zr (Zrcus4+) sites [[34], [35], [36]]. Thus, the presence of the tetragonal phase in VZrO-4 and VZrO-8 indicates that the substituted vanadium dopant effectively generates Zrcus4+ sites. However, the diffraction pattern of VZrO-12 was significantly different from those of VZrO-4 and VZrO-8 in that there was no peak corresponding to tetragonal phase (○). It exhibited strong peaks corresponding to the monoclinic phase (●) and a new peak at 2θ = 20° (♦). A comparison with the diffraction pattern of pure V2O5 reveals that this peak reflects crystalline V2O5. Thus, this result indicates that an excess amount of vanadium dopant in VZrO-12 leads to formation of V2O5 crystallites rather than substitution of Zr4+ cations.

Fig. 1. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the VZrO-x and reference samples. The substitution of V into Zr lattice results in the appearance of tetragonal phase (○) in VZrO-4 and VZrO-8. However, an excess amount of V dopant leads to the formation of V2O5 crystallites (♦) in VZrO-12.
The specific surface areas of the VZrO-x samples were measured by nitrogen physisorption. As listed in Table 1, the addition of the vanadium dopant led to a significant increase in the surface area of VZrO-4 (88 m2 g−1) and VZrO-8 (99 m2 g−1) compared to that of pure ZrO2 (52 m2 g−1). Thus, the incorporation of vanadium cations into the Zr lattice resulted in a structural change from the monoclinic phase to mixed monoclinic and tetragonal phases, as shown in the XRD patterns. The stabilization of the metastable tetragonal phase induced the formation of structural defects and increased the surface areas of VZrO-4 and VZrO-8. However, further doping of vanadium led to a significant decrease in the surface area of VZrO-12 (14 m2 g−1). Based on the smaller surface area of pure V2O5 (3 m2 g−1), the reduction in the surface area is associated with the weak thermal resistance of V2O5 crystals in VZrO-12. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms of bare ZrO2, VZrO-4, and VZrO-8 displayed type IV curves with H2-type hysteresis, reflecting the existence of mesopores (Fig. S1). The representative TEM images of the samples also confirmed that they form agglomerates with mesopores that are composed of small particles (Fig. S2). However, the isotherms and the TEM images of VZrO-12 and V2O5 showed that they have large aggregates.

Three main types of surface VOx species have been identified in supported VOx catalysts: isolated monomeric VO4 species, polymeric VO4 species, and bulk-like V2O5 species [[37], [38], [39], [40]]. The nature of the VOx species in VZrO-x was further investigated by Raman spectroscopy (Fig. S3). For the VZrO-4 sample, a band was observed at 1025 cm−1, corresponding to the stretching vibration of the vanadyl (VO) bond of the VO4 species (●), as shown in Fig. 2 [37]. Upon increasing the content of vanadium, the stretching frequency of the VO bond shifted to 1028 cm−1 for VZrO-8 and to 1034 cm−1 for VZrO-12. These shifts to higher wavenumbers are attributed to the polymerization of VOx species from monomeric to polymeric VO4 species via oligomeric species [38]. Thus, the observed changes in the Raman spectra of VZrO-x indicate that the degree of oligomerization increases with increasing amount of vanadium dopant. Combined with the main band ascribed to the VO stretching vibration, an additional band (○) was observed at 1000 cm−1 only for VZrO-12. The fact that pure V2O5 exhibited the band at the same position shows that VZrO-12 has bulk-like V2O5. Based on the results of Raman spectroscopy and XRD analyses, we conclude that the doped vanadium formed well-dispersed monomeric and oligomeric VO4 species, creating structural defects in VZrO-4 and VZrO-8. However, excess dopant led to the formation of both polymeric VO4 and crystalline V2O5 in VZrO-12.

Fig. 2. Raman spectra of the VZrO-x and reference V2O5 samples. As increasing the vanadium content, the stretching frequency of the VO bond (●) shifts to to higher wavenumbers. This change indicates increase in the degree of oligomerization of VOx species. Excess vanadium leads to the formation of V2O5 crystallites (○) in VZrO-12.
3.2. Chemical properties of the VZrO-x catalysts
The reducibility of ZrO2-based catalysts is one of the critical factors for determining catalytic performance because more Zrcus4+ sites, known as active sites for dehydrogenation, can be generated by reductive pretreatment [22]. The reducibility of as-prepared VZrO-x samples were investigated by H2-TPR. The TPR profiles of the VZrO-x and reference samples are shown in Fig. 3. Bare ZrO2 exhibited a small peak at ∼625 ℃, corresponding to evolution of H2O. The reduction of bulky V2O5 resulted in the appearance of peaks above 650 ℃. However, the VZrO-x catalysts revealed one or two peaks in the lower temperature range of 300–600 ℃. Their different reduction temperatures suggest the presence of different VOx species, including isolated monomeric VO4, polymeric VO4, and bulk-like V2O5. VZrO-4 exhibited one main peak at 438 ℃, attributed to the reduction of well-dispersed monomeric VOx species. Interestingly, the increase in the vanadium content led to a shift in the main peak to 428 ℃ and evolution of a shoulder at lower temperature, as observed for VZrO-8. These changes represent the formation of small oligomeric species in VZrO-8 because small oligomeric species are more easily reduced than monomeric species by hydrogen [41]. For VZrO-12, the main peak moved to 496 ℃, and a separate peak appeared at higher temperature. These peaks are related to the reduction of large polymeric VOx and crystalline V2O5 that formed owing to excess vanadium dopant [42]. The identification of vanadium species in the VZrO-x samples using H2-TPR agrees well with the results obtained from XRD and Raman analyses. It should be noted that the vanadium dopant led to a significant decrease in the reduction temperature of VZrO-4 and VZrO-8 catalysts compared to bare ZrO2. In addition to the creation of Zrcus4+ sites by the formation of structural defects, the high reducibility of the vanadium dopant allows more Zrcus4+ sites to be easily generated by H2 pretreatment even at 500 ℃.

Fig. 3. H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profiles of the calcined VZrO-x and reference samples. VZrO-4 and VZrO-8 catalysts exhibit reduction peaks at significantly lower temperatures than that of bare ZrO2, showing improved reducibility. The reduction peaks of VZrO-12 indicate the presence of polymeric VOx and crystalline V2O5.
The surface composition and the chemical states of the as-calcined VZrO-x samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The relative vanadium composition and the binding energies of Zr 3d5/2, O 1s, and V 2p3/2 are summarized in Table 2. The relative surface ratio of vanadium, [V]/([Zr]+[V]), was similar to the bulk ratio. Fig. 4 shows the Zr 3d and V 2p core-level spectra of the VZrO-x and reference samples. The Zr 3d3/2 and Zr 3d5/2 peaks have an area ratio of 2:3 with a binding energy difference of ∼2.35 eV (Fig. 4(a)). All Zr 3d5/2 peaks for VZrO-x are located in the binding energy range of 182.0–182.2 eV. These binding energies correspond to the Zr4+ state [[43], [44], [45]]. The V 2p core-level spectra of VZrO-x exhibit peaks with binding energies at 516.5–517.2 eV for V 2p3/2 and at 523.7–524.8 eV for V 2p1/2. The deconvoluted spectrum indicates the presence of two oxidation state of vanadium, V4+ and V5+ (Fig. 4(b)) [46,47]. The surface V5+/V4+ ratio is unity for VZrO-4. However, the V5+/V4+ ratio increased to 2.0 for VZrO-8 and to 2.6 for VZrO-12 with increasing amount of vanadium in VZrO-x. This increase in V5+ species indicates the formation of the V5+=O species during the process of formation of oligomeric and crystalline V2O5 [48].

Fig. 4. X-ray photoelectron core-level spectra of (a) Zr 3d and (b) V 2p for the as-calcined VZrO-x and reference catalysts. The binding energies of Zr 3d peaks for pure ZrO2 and VZrO-x catalysts are nearly identical and they correspond to Zr4+ state. The V 2p peaks of VZrO-x show mixed oxidation states of vanadium. The V5+/V4+ ratio increases with increasing V content.
The VZrO-8 catalyst was further characterized by near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS) to understand the chemical states after air calcination and H2 pretreatment. For this investigation, XP spectra of the sample were collected at 500 ℃ under oxygen and hydrogen environments. Both Zr 3d core-level spectra exhibited identical features as that obtained under UHV (Fig. 5(a)). This result indicates that there is a negligible change in the oxidation state of the Zr cations. However, the V 2p core-level spectra revealed a noticeable change in the oxidation state of vanadium, depending on the gas conditions (Fig. 5(b)). The vanadium species were almost fully oxidized under the oxygen environment. Under the hydrogen environment, the V 2p3/2 peak shifted toward the lower binding energy of 1.1 eV. The binding energy of ∼516.1 eV corresponds to the mixed oxidation state of vanadium (V5+ and V4+). Compared to the UHV environment, the V5+/V4+ ratio significantly decreased from 2.0 to 0.1. It reveals that the most vanadium species were reduced from V5+ to V4+ under the hydrogen environment. Along with H2-TPR profiles, NAP-XPS results suggest that the VZrO-8 catalyst can be easily reduced by H2 pretreatment.

Fig. 5. Near-ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron core-level spectra of (a) Zr 3d and (b) V 2p for the VZrO-8 catalyst under oxygen and hydrogen environments. There is no change in the oxidation state of Zr cations, Zr4+, regardless of gas environment. The oxidized vanadium cations, V5+, under oxygen environment are reduced to V4+ under hydrogen environment.
The substitution of vanadium dopant into the Zr lattice of VZrO-4 and VZrO-8 resulted in a structural transformation to the tetragonal phase. This phase change of the samples indicates the creation of oxygen vacancies and neighboring Zrcus4+ sites [[34], [35], [36]]. In terms of acidity, the Zrcus4+ cations correspond to Lewis acid sites, as reported for the coordinatively unsaturated metal sites (Mcusx+) in many metal oxides [12,13,26]. Thus, the FTIR spectra of adsorbed pyridine and the ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) spectra were measured to estimate the acid properties of VZrO-x. They revealed well resolved bands arising from the pyridine adsorbed on Lewis acid sites at 1447 cm−1, 1575 cm−1, and 1604 cm−1, as displayed in Fig. 6(a). However, a representative band at 1540 cm−1 corresponding to pyridine adsorbed on the Brønsted acid sites was negligible. Similar features were observed in the spectrum of bare ZrO2. These spectra indicate that pure ZrO2 and VZrO-x have only Lewis acid sites and that the addition of the vanadium dopant has no influence on the nature of the acid sites.

Fig. 6. (a) Fourier transform infrared spectra of adsorbed pyridine (py-FTIR) and (b) NH3-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) spectra for VZrO-x and ZrO2. All catalysts reveal bands corresponding to Lewis acid sites. The addition of vanadium leads to the increase in the total amount of acid sites on VZrO-4 and VZrO-8. Excess vanadium results in the sharp decrease in the amount of acid sites on VZrO-12.
In addition to the type of acid sites, their strengths and amounts in VZrO-x were investigated by NH3-TPD. The VZrO-x catalysts exhibited a broad NH3 desorption peak in the temperature range of 100–650 ℃, as shown in Fig. 6(b). These peaks can be deconvoluted into three Gaussian peaks, peak α, peak β, and peak γ, based on semi-empirical methods (Fig. S4) [26,49,50]. They have peak temperatures at ∼207 ℃, ∼292 ℃, and ∼414 ℃, respectively. Thus, peak α and peak β correspond to relatively weak acid sites, while peak γ corresponds to strong acid sites. The estimated acid site density for each peak of the VZrO-x and reference samples are summarized in Table 1. In the cases of VZrO-4 and VZrO-8, the addition of more vanadium led to the creation of more acid sites. The increase in the total amount of acid sites is mainly attributed to the increase in the amount of strong acid sites compared to the amount of weak acid sites. The fact that Mcus4+ sites correspond to Lewis acid sites suggests that the increase in the Lewis acidity of VZrO-4 and VZrO-8 results from the increase in the number of Zrcus4+ sites via incorporation of vanadium in the Zr lattice [12,13,51]. However, excess addition of vanadium led to a clear reduction in the amount of acid sites as observed in VZrO-12.
3.3. Catalytic performances of the VZrO-x catalysts
The VZrO-x catalysts were tested during the PDH reaction at 550 ℃, and their catalytic performances were compared to those of pure ZrO2 and V2O5. It is noteworthy that the VZrO-x and V2O5 catalysts were pretreated at 550 ℃ in a flow of H2; however, ZrO2 was pretreated at 600 ℃ because it showed a poor performance owing to its low reducibility at 550 ℃. The initial activities and propene selectivities are compared in Fig. 7(a). Regardless of the vanadium content in the VZrO-x, they exhibited a high propene selectivity (>98%). The vanadium dopant had a distinctly positive influence on the catalytic performance of the VZrO-4 and VZrO-8 catalysts; they had a more than two times higher activity compared to ZrO2. However, VZrO-12 exhibited nearly the same activity as pure ZrO2. This decrease is related to the formation of bulk V2O5 crystallites from excess vanadium. The low conversion of V2O5 of less than 5% also supports this decrease in activity of VZrO-12.

The VZrO-4 and VZrO-8 catalysts have a more than two times higher activity compared to ZrO2. The catalyst with more acid sites results in higher initial conversion. (Experimental conditions: T = 550 ℃, atmospheric pressure, WHSVpropane=4.73 h−1, 200 mg of catalyst, Total flow rate =60 sccm).
In metal oxides, Zr cations neighboring oxygen vacancies, called Zrcus4+ sites, correspond to Lewis acid sites [26,28]. For VZrO-x, the addition of the vanadium dopant affects the number of Lewis acid sites, as observed in the FTIR spectra of adsorbed pyridine and the NH3-TPD spectra. Therefore, the specific activity of VZrO-x can be interpreted by the number of Lewis acid sites. The relationship between the activity of the VZrO-x samples and the amount of Lewis acid sites is shown in Fig. 7(b). This plot shows a trend that the VZrO-x catalyst with more acid sites exhibits a higher activity. This correlation supports the idea that the vanadium dopant generates additional Zrcus4+ sites, which are active sites for PDH. The relationship between the number of Zrcus4+ sites and activity was further investigated by comparing the properties and performance of vanadium-impregnated ZrO2 (V/ZrO-4) with those of VZrO-4 (Fig. S5-S8). The impregnated vanadium were well-dispersed on ZrO2. However, V/ZrO-4 revealed no structural transformation. This indicates that no incorporation of vanadium dopant into Zr lattice occurred. As expected, V/ZrO-4 exhibited no significant increase in the amount of Lewis acid sites and improvement in activity. Again, this shows that the activity of VZrO-x is well correlated with the amount of Lewis acid sites and the increased activity is mainly attributed to the formation of Zrcus4+ sites by incorporated vanadium dopant. Our results also agree with previous studies on PDH on metal oxides, where the Mcusx+ sites of CrOx, GaOx, FeOx, and AlOx serve as adsorption sites for C3H7 species, which is a reaction intermediate for dehydrogenation [[10], [11], [12], [13],22,52,53].
The VZrO-x catalysts show a loss in catalytic activity as a function of time-on-stream (Fig. S9). The activity recovery by regeneration is one of the important properties of catalysts for PDH reaction. For VZrO-8, the PDH reaction was repeated for 10 cycles to verify its recyclability. After each reaction, the catalyst was regenerated by air treatment, followed by hydrogen treatment at 550 ℃. Following the regeneration step, the VZrO-8 catalyst exhibited 100% recovery of the catalytic performance for 10 repeated cycles, as shown in Fig. 8(a). After 10 cycles, the NH3-TPD spectrum of the regenerated VZrO-8 catalyst was identical to that of fresh VZrO-8, as shown in Fig. 8(b). This result indicates that there was no change in the active sites of VZrO-8, corresponding to Lewis acid sites, during the repeated cycling. Moreover, the complete restoration of the catalytic performance suggests that carbon deposition on the catalyst surface led to the deactivation of VZrO-x as a function of time-on-stream. In the case of the reference ZrO2 catalyst, the regenerated catalyst revealed a low yield of ≤ 2.3% for the 2nd cycle. However, following the longer H2 reduction at the higher temperature of 600 ℃, the initial yield was recovered, as observed at the 3rd cycle. Thus, the low yield measured at the 2nd cycle was due to the low reducibility of pure ZrO2. The higher reducibility of VZrO-8 by the vanadium dopant resulted in a higher catalytic activity and recyclability.

(Experimental conditions: T = 550 ℃, atmospheric pressure, WHSVpropane=4.73 h−1, 200 mg of catalyst, Total flow rate =60 sccm).
The influence of the reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of pure ZrO2 and VZrO-8 are compared in Fig. 9(a). In the temperature range of 550 ℃ to 600 ℃, the initial propene yield of ZrO2 steadily increased with increasing temperature with the highest yield of 19% at 600 ℃. It is noteworthy that despite of higher reaction temperature, the initial yield of ZrO2 at 600 ℃ was lower than that of VZrO-8 at 550 ℃. The initial yield of the VZrO-8 catalyst increased from 24% at 550 ℃ to 28% at 575 ℃. However, there was no improvement in the initial yield when the reaction temperature was increased to 600 ℃. Although VZrO-8 revealed the same yield at both 575 ℃ and 600 ℃, the deactivation was faster at higher temperature, as shown in Fig. 9(b). For each reaction temperature, the amount of coke on the spent VZrO-8 catalyst was measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The catalyst used at a higher temperature led to a greater loss in weight, as shown in Fig. 9(c). This result indicates that the amount coke on the catalyst increased with increasing reaction temperature. Therefore, the negligible improvement in the initial yield of VZrO-8 at 600 ℃ resulted from the severe coke deposition and the rapid loss in activity during the early stage of PDH.

The severe coke deposition and the rapid loss in activity lead to the negligible improvement in the initial yield of VZrO-8 at 600 ℃ compared to that at 575 ℃. (Experimental conditions: T = 550–600 ℃, atmospheric pressure, WHSVpropane=4.73 h−1, 200 mg of catalyst, Total flow rate =60 sccm).
For non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on metal oxides, it has been suggested that propane molecules are adsorbed on Mcusx+ sites. Then, a hydrogen from the adsorbed propane molecule is abstracted by a surface oxygen, forming a hydroxyl group and a propyl species [14,26,53,54]. In this case, deep dehydrogenation of the adsorbed propane molecule generates a coke precursor. As a result, fast deactivation occurs by severe coke deposition, as observed for PDH on VZrO-8 at 600 ℃. Therefore, the deep dehydrogenation can be suppressed by decreasing the density of surface oxygen sites, which act as H atom acceptors. Indeed, the transformation of the surface oxygen of IrO2 to the –OH group via partial hydrogenation prevented deep dehydrogenation of ethane [53]. Thus, hydrogen was co-fed with propane at a ratio of H2/C3H8 of 1 to reduce the coke formation on VZrO-8 during PDH at 600 ℃. The catalytic performances of VZrO-8 with and without H2 co-feeding are compared in Fig. 10(a). The initial propene yield increased from 28% to 34% by co-feeding H2. Moreover, the VZrO-8 catalyst exhibited significantly decreased the deactivation rate. The TGA spectrum of the spent VZrO-8 catalyst confirms that co-feeding H2 clearly suppressed the formation of coke, as presented in Fig. 10(b). Approximately half the amount of coke was formed on the VZrO-8 catalyst when hydrogen was co-fed with propane.

Co-feeding H2 suppresses the formation of coke and therefore, increases the propene yield. (Experimental conditions: T = 600 ℃, atmospheric pressure, WHSVpropane=4.73 h−1, 200 mg of catalyst, C3H8/H2/Ar = 8/8/44, total flow rate =60 sccm).
4. Conclusion
In this study, we showed that the addition of vanadium dopant in ZrO2 can lead to significant improvement in catalytic activity and recyclability in PDH. The superior catalytic performances of VZrO-x resulted from the creation of additional Zrcus4+ cations, which are Lewis acid sites. The activity of VZrO-x was well correlated with the amount of Lewis acid sites. An appropriate amount of vanadium led to the substitution of the vanadium dopant into Zr lattice. These VOx species enabled more Zrcus4+ sites to be generated by a structural transformation and H2 pretreatment. However, the formation of V2O5 crystallites by excess vanadium led to a significant decrease in the catalytic performance. As a result, VZrO-8 exhibited the highest activity. The deactivation of the catalyst by coke deposition was successfully suppressed by H2 co-feeding.
