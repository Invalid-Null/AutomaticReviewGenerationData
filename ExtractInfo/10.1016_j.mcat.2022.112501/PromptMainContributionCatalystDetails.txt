Abstract
Since last decade, single atom catalysts have massive development in the field of propane dehydrogenation (PDH). In this study, both the catalytic activity and reaction mechanism of 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal atom anchored on C2N (TM-C2N) for non-oxidative PDH are studied in detail using the density functional theory methods. Firstly, six stable catalysts (Cr-, Mn-, Fe-, Co-, Cu-, and Ag-C2N) are screened out by calculating the difference between the formation energy of the single atom and the cohesive energy of the corresponding bulk metal. Combining the results of adsorption energy and density of states, it is demonstrated that propane and propylene can be stably adsorbed on all screened TM-C2N. The calculated activation barrier and reaction energy of elementary reactions involved in PDH indicate that the initial C−H bond breaking step is determined as the rate-determining step on almost all the screened TM-C2N catalysts. Among all studied TM-C2N, the Fe-C2N possesses excellent catalytic activity even better than other promising catalysts. In addition, the d-band center values of transition metal atoms in screened TM-C2N show a stronger liner relationship with the interaction energy, suggesting that the d-band center may be served as a priority descriptor for the interaction energy between reaction species and catalyst surface rather than for the adsorption energy of reaction species.

1. Introduction
Propylene (CH3CHCH2) is one of the basic raw materials of petrochemical industry, which is mainly manufactured through the catalytic cracking, steam cracking, propane dehydrogenation (PDH), and coal-to-olefins processes [1], [2], [3]. Among them, the PDH is considered to be one of the most promising propylene production methods [4], [5], [6], due to the abundant sources and low price of raw propane as well as ultra-high propylene selectivity [7], [8], [9]. The PDH includes two approaches, which are oxidative dehydrogenation and non-oxidative dehydrogenation [10]. For oxidative dehydrogenation, its process unavoidably generates byproducts due to deep oxidation of propene [11], [12], [13]. In contrary, non-oxidative approach is characterized by the advantages of higher propylene yield and fewer side reactions, which has been realized in commercial applications [14,15]. Nowadays, the industrially applied catalyst is Pt/C material, with the limited resource and high price, tremendously hindering the development of non-oxidative PDH [16], [17], [18]. Therefore, it is imperative to find alternate materials with low cost and high performance to replace Pt/C material.
Since Qiao et al. proposed the concept of single atom catalysts (SACs) [19], the SACs have been intensively studied for the PDH process [20]. Previous studies have shown that fast propylene desorption can be achieved through weak propylene-π adsorption mode on SACs, thereby achieving the desired propylene selectivity [21], [22], [23], [24]. Chang et al. have investigated the adsorption and catalytic behaviors of single-atom-doped Ga2O3 catalysts for PDH by DFT methods, which shows that the volcano-shaped activity plot can be broken by Lewis acid base interactions [25]. Owing to the good electrical and thermal conductivities as well as large specific surface area, two-dimensional materials including graphene, boron nitride, and graphitic carbon nitride are considered as suitable supports to anchor metal atoms for catalyzing various reactions [26], [27], [28], [29]. Xiong et al. have theoretically found that single Pt atom at the B vacancy on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) and Ru at the N vacancy on h-BN show excellent activity for PDH [30]. Kong et al. have theoretically demonstrated that the single vanadium atom anchored on g-C3N4 may serve as a promising SAC for non-oxidative PDH with industrially practical activity, selectivity, and thermal stability [31]. Similar to g-C3N4, the negatively charged N atoms of C2N make the cavity environment highly electron rich in nature, and it leads C2N to serve as the ideal support for the inclusion of positively charged transition metal (TM) ions [32], [33], [34], [35], [36].
In this work, based on the density functional theory (DFT) methods, the 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal anchored on C2N (TM-C2N) are systematically studied as potential non-oxidative PDH catalysts. The formation energy is calculated to evaluate the structural stability of TM-C2N, and six stable TM-C2N are screened to further investigate the catalytic activity for PDH. The adsorption behaviors of propane and propylene on screened TM-C2N are also studied. Furthermore, the detailed mechanism of PDH on screened TM-C2N is investigated to determine the favorable route. Encouragingly, Fe-C2N shows better catalytic activity and is expected to be the potential non-oxidative PDH catalyst. Finally, the electronic structure analysis illustrates that the d-band center can serve as a priority descriptor for the interaction energy between reaction species and screened TM-C2N surface.
2. Computational details
DFT calculations were carried out by the DMol3 code in Materials Studio [37,38]. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional was utilized to explore the electronic exchange-correlation effects [39], and double numerical plus polarization (DNP) basis set was adopted. A smearing of 0.005 Ha was employed to simultaneously accelerate convergence and improve computational accuracy. All structures were relaxed until the force on each atom was less than 0.004 Ha Å−1. The complete LST/QST method and a mode-eigenvector following approach were employed to search the transition states of all elementary reactions [40,41]. In addition, the first principle molecular dynamics calculation simulation was carried out in the NVT (dynamics at constant temperature and constant volume) system at a temperature of 800 K with a period of 1 ps [42]. The integration time step used is 1 fs. The Anderson temperature controller is used here for temperature control.
The formation energy (Ef) is defined as:
(1)
where ETM-C2N is the total energy of transition metals doped C2N, EC2N means the energy of C2N, and ETM is the energy of transition metal atoms in bulk structure.
The dissolution potential (Udiss) is calculated by the following equation:
(2)
where U
diss (metal, bulk) is the standard dissolution potential of bulk metal and N is the number of electrons involved in the dissolution (details are showed in Table S1). Actually, Udiss > 0 indicates that the binding force between the metal atoms on the tested SAC and the substrate is strong enough to avoid dissolution under solution conditions, on the contrary, Udiss < 0 indicates that the metal will dissolve into ions in solution.
Furthermore, the cohesive energy (Ecoh) of bulk metal system is calculated by the following formula:
(3)
where Ebulk and Esingle are the energies of bulk metal and single metal atom, respectively, and n is the number of metal atoms in the bulk.
Besides, the difference (Ediff) between Ef and Ecoh is defined as:
(4)
Additionally, the activation barrier (Ea) and reaction energy (∆E) are calculated as:
(5)
(6)
where ETS, EIS, and EFS are the total energies of the transition state (TS), initial state (IS), and final state (FS), respectively.
Additionally, the interaction energy (Eint) between species and catalyst surface is calculated by the formula:
(7)
where Edef/surf and Edef/mol are the deformation energies of catalyst surface and propylene molecule, which are obtained by subtracting the electron energy of the corresponding individual ideal gas components (surface and molecule) from the electron energy of the clean surface and free molecule of the completely optimized structure.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structure and stability of TM-C2N
In this work, the aperiodic porous structure of C2N consists of 78 carbon atoms, 30 nitrogen atoms, and 18 hydrogen atoms, as shown in Fig. 1(a). It can be clearly seen that the TM atom is anchored on a cavity of C2N. Total 24 kinds of 3d, 4d, and 5d TM atoms are considered and exhibited in Fig. 1(b). The TM atoms are initially placed in the center of cavity for geometry optimization to obtain the stable structures of TM-C2N. The optimized geometries are all shown in Fig. S1. It should be noted that the constructed aperiodic structure of TM-C2N is reasonable based on the comparison of the adsorption energy of propane and propylene on aperiodic and periodic TM-C2N (see Table S2).

To evaluate the thermodynamic stability of TM-C2N, the corresponding Ef values are calculated. In addition, the Udiss values of metal atoms are considered to evaluate the stability of these catalysts in solution condition, as shown in Fig. 2a. The systems with Ef < 0 eV are considered to be thermodynamically stable, while materials with Udiss > 0 V can avoid metal dissolution under solution condition. A total of 17 TM-C2N in the green region possess negative Ef and positive Udiss values, suggesting that they are thermodynamically, and the metals on the catalysts can avoid dissolution under solution conditions. Therefore, in the following investigation, only these 17 TM-C2N are considered, that is, the corresponding transition metal atoms are more likely to stabilize at the cavity of C2N.

At the same time, Ediff are calculated to assess whether the metal atoms are at risk of agglomeration on C2N, as shown in Fig. 2b. If the Ediff value is negative, it indicates that the single TM atom can be stably anchored on C2N. Conversely, a positive value of Ediff means that single TM atoms tend to agglomerate into large cluster. It is clear that the Ediff values of Cr-, Mn-, Fe-, Co-, Cu-, and Ag-C2N are all negative, suggesting that these TM atoms can be stabilized on the C2N monolayer in the form of isolated single atoms. Based on the above analysis, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, and Ag can stabilize at the cavity of C2N as the isolated atom. Therefore, the subsequent discussion only focuses on six catalysts.
Considering that the operating temperature of industrial PDH is about 800 K [31], we performed the molecular dynamics calculation to evaluate the thermal stability of a single transition metal atom anchored on curved C2N at 800 K. As shown in the Fig. 3, there is no obvious deformation of TM-C2N structures observed, which indicates that the screened catalysts can still exist stably under the industrial PDH reaction temperature without decomposition.

3.2. Adsorption of reaction species
Previous studies have pointed out that the adsorption of propylene plays a crucial role in determining the activity of catalyst, and the difficulty of propylene desorption from the catalyst surface is highly relevant to the selectivity of catalyst for propylene [43,44]. Therefore, we calculate the adsorption energies of propane and propylene to evaluate the adsorption strength of them on TM-C2N, as shown in Fig. 4. The more negative the Eads value, the stronger the adsorption strength. As shown in Fig. 4, it can be concluded that the Eads values of propane on most TM-C2N are more negative than that on the Pt(111) surface (−0.37 eV) [45], such strong adsorption of propane is favorable to the subsequent dehydrogenation process. Compared with other TM-C2N, Co-C2N possesses the strongest adsorption strength of propane and propylene, with the corresponding values are −0.54 and −1.19 eV, respectively. The adsorption of propylene on screened TM-C2N is stronger than propane adsorbed on the corresponding catalysts, which is consistent of the situation on the Pt(111) surface. It should be noted that the adsorption energy of propylene on Fe-, Co-, and Cu-C2N is relatively strong than that on the remaining TM-C2N, such a strong adsorption may not affect the catalytic activity and selectivity for propylene production, as discussed in Section 3.3. Indeed, the adsorption strength of propylene and other reaction species can be tuned by further vacancy engineering, tensile strain, or heteroatom doping of catalysts, which is one of the research topics for PDH [46], [47], [48].

3.3. Reaction mechanism of PDH
Previous literature shows that the activation barrier of CC bond dissociation is significantly higher than that of methyl C−H bond and methylene CH bond dissociation of propane, which indicates that the initial activation of CC bond is unfavorable [13]. In addition, the high activation barrier of deep dehydrogenation of propylene on SACs blocks its kinetic possibility [47,49]. Therefore, only the main elementary reactions involved in PDH are considered. In the process of PDH, there are two different situations for the breakage of the first CH bond, whose products are CH3CHCH3 and CH3CH2CH2, and these two intermediates are subsequently dehydrogenated to the final product propylene. The above two situations are defined as route I and route II, as depicted in Fig. 6.

Fig. 6. Schematic of reaction mechanism of PDH.
To quantitatively evaluate the catalytic activity of screened TM-C2N catalysts, the activation barriers and reaction energies (ΔE) of elementary reactions involved in PDH are calculated systematically, as shown in Fig. 7, and the corresponding IS, TS, and FS are displayed in Figs. S3–S8. It can be seen that except for Cu-C2N, the Ea values of the step of initial CH bond breaking on screened TM-C2N is higher than that of the subsequent CH bond breaking. This indicates that the initial CH bond breaking step is determined as the rate-determining step (RDS). As plotted in Fig. 7b and f, there is barely difference for the Ea values of the step of initial C−H bond breaking on Ag- and Mn-C2N, suggesting that both CH3CHCH3 and CH3CH2CH2 intermediates may be produced on them. Furthermore, except for Cu-C2N, the RDS of all screened TM-C2N is the step of CH3CH2CH3 → CH3CHCH3, and the corresponding Ea values are 1.70, 2.06, 1.23, 1.69 eV, respectively. The Ea value of RDS on Mn-C2N is as high as 2.06 eV, so Mn-C2N has the poor catalytic performance for PDH among all TM-C2N. For Cu-C2N, the RDS is determined as the step of CH3CH2CH2 → CH3CHCH2 with the Ea value of 1.12 eV. For Cr-, Fe-, and Co-C2N, the formation of CH3CHCH3 intermediate is energetically favorable, that is, PDH is proceed through the route I. Especially, Fe-C2N possesses the lowest Ea value (1.04 eV) for the step of CH3CH2CH3 → CH3CHCH3 compared to other TM-C2N. It should be noted that the calculated activation barrier of RDS on Fe-C2N is slightly higher than that of Pt (Ea = 0.7 eV) [24]. However, it still lower than that of some promising PDH catalysts, such as Pt2Sn/Pt(111) (Ea = 1.22 eV) [50], V2O3 (Ea = 1.12 eV) [51], Cr2O3(0001) (Ea = 1.4 eV) [52], and Pd(111) (Ea = 1.26 eV) [53]. Therefore, Fe-C2N also shows better catalytic activity and is expected to be the potential non-oxidative PDH catalyst.

In addition, the activation barriers for further dehydrogenation of propylene on TM-C2N (TM = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, Ag) are ulteriorly tested, and the corresponding values are 1.06, 1.98, 2.40, 1.77, 2.05, and 1.52 eV, respectively. Kong et al. concluded that if the activation energy of further dehydrogenation for propylene is higher than that of propylene formation as well as is higher than the absolute value of propylene adsorption energy, the propylene can be recognized as the ultimate target product [31]. Similarly, all the screened TM-C2N possess a higher Ea value of propylene dehydrogenation than that of propylene formation and the absolute value of propylene adsorption energy. Thus, the propylene is the ultimate target product rather than reaction intermediate and the selectivity of propylene on screened TM-C2N is satisfactory.
3.4. Electronic structure analysis
The electronic structure analysis is helpful to understand the reactivity trend for SACs. Therefore, the d-band center (εd) values of screened TM-C2N are calculated. According to the d-band center theory, the values of εd can be used as the critical parameter for determining the reactivity of transition metals of catalyst [54]. The higher the εd values, the higher the reactivity of metal, which indicates a stronger adsorption of reaction species. That is, the Eads values of reaction species generally possess a linear relationship with the εd values. The Eads values of propylene on screened TM-C2N are linearly fitted with the corresponding εd values (see Fig. 8a), and it can be seen that the linear relationship is very weak, with a low coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.33. The liner relationship between the Eint values of propylene on screened TM-C2N and the εd values are further fitted in Fig. 8b. By comparison, the εd values of screened TM-C2N show a stronger liner relationship with the Eint values (R2 = 0.81). The reason for this phenomenon is that the adsorption energy takes the deformation energy of catalyst surface and propylene molecule into account. While the interaction energy is calculated by removing the energy change caused by structure deformation. During the adsorption process, the propylene and screened TM-C2N will undergo obvious deformation, and the different deformation degree leads to varying deformation energy (see Fig. 4b). That can explain why the Eads values of propylene on screened TM-C2N are not linear strongly with the εd values. For a kind of catalyst that possesses large difference in configuration of the same adsorption species, the d-band center may be used as a priority descriptor of the interaction energy between reaction species and catalyst surface.

4. Conclusions
In this study, the DFT calculations are carried out to explore the catalytic performance of the non-oxidative PDH over the 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metal anchored on C2N. By comparing the formation energy of the single atoms with the cohesive energy of the corresponding bulk metals, the Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Cu, and Ag atoms can be stabilized on the C2N monolayer in the form of isolated single atoms. Both the propane and propylene can be strongly adsorbed on all TM-C2N, and the comparatively obvious overlap between the d states of TM and the p states of C directly connected to TM also proves that. In order to quantitatively evaluate the catalytic activity of screened TM-C2N catalysts, the activation barrier and the reaction energy of each elementary reaction involved in PDH are further calculated. It can be found that except for Cu-C2N, the Ea values of the initial C−H bond breaking step on screened TM-C2N are higher than that of the subsequent CH bond breaking step, which indicates that the initial CH bond breaking step is determined as the RDS towards PDH. In particular, the Fe-C2N has shown satisfactory catalytic activity and is expected to be potential non-oxidative PDH catalyst. Finally, the electronic structure analysis shows that for a kind of catalyst that possesses large difference in configuration of the same adsorption species, the d-band center may be used as a priority descriptor of the interaction energy between reaction species and catalyst surface. In short, the presented results can provide pivotal guidance to design and screen out promising single atom catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation process.
