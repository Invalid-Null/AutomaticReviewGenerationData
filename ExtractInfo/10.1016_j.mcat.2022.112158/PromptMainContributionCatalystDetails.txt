Abstract
The linear and non-linear effects of the impregnation pH and of the concentration of vanadium in solution over the properties of Na-SiO2 supported catalysts used for the oxidation of propane under light-off/light-out tests at oxidizing conditions were studied. The listed factors had no net effects over the loading of vanadium, the surface area, and the porous structure of the catalysts. Depending on the pH, sodium vanadates of different particle sizes were formed; namely, NaVO3 microcrystals and particles made of α-NaVO3 and β-NaVO3 phases were formed at acidic pH, whereas sodium metavanadate nanoparticles were formed at pH=9.0. For the catalysts synthesized at pH=3.8, i.e., near the point of zero charge of the support, and at pH=9.0, the α-NaVO3 phase prevailed over the β-NaVO3 phase after dehydration and catalytic testing. The catalyst synthesized at pH=9.0 and at the highest concentration of vanadium in the impregnating solution showed normal hysteresis behavior while being the best in terms of the selectivity to propene and the conversions of propane and oxygen which were at the same level as the ones found for a VOx/SiO2 benchmark. The correlation of the catalytic trends with the physicochemical properties of the catalysts allowed concluding that increasing the impregnation pH favors the formation of less reducible and more acidic V4+ species that favor the reactivity and the selectivity to propene over the Na-SiO2 supported sodium vanadate catalysts synthesized herein. the most selective to propane oxidative dehydrogenation at a propane conversion comparable. Kinetic and thermodynamic arguments were discussed to elucidate the origin the catalytic trends.

Introduction
The selective oxidation of light hydrocarbons has been studied for almost a century with the first US patents granted to Burke et al. in 1933 and 1934 [1,2]. A first review of the topic was made as early as 1937 by Newitt [3]. Since the beginning, propene was found to be one of the products of the catalytic oxidation of propane. However, researchers only started paying attention to this reaction at the end of the 60 s [4], [5], [6], [7]. They aimed to increase the production of olefins using processes other than the well-established catalytic dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Costs savings in energy and catalyst consumption were since then envisioned because oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are exothermic, and they do not foul the catalyst with coke. Despite such prospects [8,9,18,19,[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]], a commercial process for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is not yet a reality [10,20].
The main drawback of oxidative dehydrogenations is their lower thermodynamic favorability when compared to combustion. Fig. S1 plots the standard, p = 1.0 bar, Gibbs free energy, ΔG°, as a function of temperature for some of the reactions that can take place in a propane oxidation process made with oxygen. The following reactions were considered: total (i) and partial (ii) combustion, oxidative dehydrogenation (iii), water gas shift -WGS- (iv), and oxidative reforming (v). Reactions (iv) and (v) were included because hydrogen has been reported as a product in some studies [10,21]. Accordingly, oxidative dehydrogenation is only more thermodynamically favorable than the WGS reaction. In addition, to reduce the gap between oxidative dehydrogenation and the combustion and reforming reactions, the process should be run at the lowest temperature possible. Typically, catalysis studies are performed between 400°C and 550°C [8,10,12,13,15,[22], [23], [24]]. In addition, they are normally restricted to conversions of propane around 10% where the production of propene is relatively near to the requirements of a practical application [10,25].
Supported vanadium oxides perform best in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane [8,9,[26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]]. Silica and alumina (mostly γ-Al2O3) are archetypical vanadium oxide supports [8,9,36,10,13,28,29,[32], [33], [34], [35]]. The surface chemistry of silica is relatively simpler than that of γ-Al2O3 as in regards to the relative distribution of hydroxyls [37,38]. Thus, in principle, this allows a more precise control of the surface distribution of vanadium oxide species over silica. Indeed, Wachs and Weckhuysen [35] pointed out that the formation of isolated surface VOx units is favored over silica. Isolated VOx units and other oligomeric two-dimensional vanadium oxide species are considered to favor the production of propene [9,10,13,26,28,31,32,[39], [40], [41]]. However, the strongest limitation for the use of silica as support is its relatively low surface density of hydroxyls, ca. 5 OH/nm2, regardless of its surface area [37]. This restricts the loading of vanadium for producing the active phases selective to propene.
The use of sodium for the impregnation of vanadium over silica has been claimed to improve the dispersion of vanadium [42,43] via the formation of oligomeric two-dimensional vanadium oxide species [44], [45], [46]. Irusta et al. [42,43] reported this first for catalysts synthesized by the impregnation of ammonium metavanadate -NH4VO3- in the presence of NaOH. They suggested the formation of sodium metavanadate, NaVO3, type compounds. Grant et al. [44,45] found similar trends after impregnating sodium nitrate over SiO2 and then impregnating vanadium triisopropoxide over the sodium loaded support. On the other hand, Nadjafi et al. [46] showed evidence indicating that SiO2 supported sodium vanadates may redisperse under the reaction atmosphere of propane oxidative dehydrogenation.
The main variables during the impregnation of a supported catalyst are the pH and the concentration of the metal to be impregnated [47,48]. The effects of these variables on the distribution of vanadium oxides were studied in the past [34,49]. Taouk et al. [49] found that at pH = 4.0 vanadium oxide precipitated over SiO2 during impregnation, while tetrahedrally coordinated V4O124− species were prevalent on the catalysts at pH = 11. Deo and Wachs [34] developed predictions for the vanadium oxide structures as a function of these two variables while considering the point of zero charge, PZC, of different oxidic supports; namely, MgO, γ-Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2, and SiO2. They used the equilibrium distribution of aqueous vanadium species [50] as a guide. For SiO2, they predicted that at pH=3.9 and low surface coverage, i.e., for V2O5 loadings between 1.5 and 3.0 wt.%, decavanadate-like species, V10O28, are formed while V2O5 particles are formed for V2O5 loadings higher than 3.0 wt.%. In a further review, Wachs [51] demonstrated that the structure of supported hydrated surface metal oxides was similar to the one found in aqueous solutions if the pH of both the hydrated surface and the aqueous solution was the same. However, the author also warned that cations such as sodium may change the structure of the hydrated supported metal oxides. In this sense, as far as the literature reviewed for this paper is concerned, a systematic analysis of the effects of pH and vanadium concentration over the properties of Na-SiO2 supported vanadium oxide catalysts is still missing.
This work investigates the impregnation of NH3VO4 over a 1.0 wt.% sodium loaded silica, Na-SiO2, support and focuses on how the pH and the concentration of the vanadium precursor influence the physicochemical and catalytic properties during propane oxidation. The possible non-additive effects [52], [53], [54] of these variables over the properties of the catalysts were investigated. The levels of pH and concentration of vanadium were fixed at values where different electrostatic interactions between the dissolved vanadium species and the Na-SiO2 support occurred [31], Fig. S2. The bulk, surface, and catalytic properties of the synthesized materials were analyzed by various techniques and the results were assessed both statistically and phenomenologically.
Experimental section
2.1. Synthesis of catalysts
The sodium loaded, ca. 1.0 wt.%, silica -Na-SiO2- support (commercial grade, Brazilian origin) was impregnated with NH4VO3 (Carlo Erba, pure reagent). Impregnation experiments were planned and executed by following four times replicated 22 plus one off-centered point full factorial experimental design where the input variables were the pH and the concentration vanadium in the impregnation solution. The syntheses were made in random order as in agreement with the principles of statistical experimental design [52], [53], [54]. The levels selected for the pH were 1.5; 3.8; and 9.0, while for the molal (m) concentration of vanadium the levels were 0.0126 × 10−3; 0.0504 × 10−3; and 0.0864 × 10−3 μmolal. The values of pH were selected to be below, near, and above the point of zero charge, PZC, of the Na-SiO2 support; PZC ∼3.5, Fig. S2. Synthesis runs were planned for producing batches of 3.0 g of the materials. Therefore, the nominal wt.% of vanadium in the catalysts were: 0.21, 0.84, and 1.44 wt.%. For each run, NH4VO3 was added to a beaker with 50 mL of deionized water (Milli-Q) at 70 °C and stirred with a PTFE magnetic bar at 200 rpm to ensure the dissolution of NH4VO3. The pH of the resulting solution was adjusted with solutions of either HNO3 (Merck, 65%) or NH4OH (Merck, 25%). Afterwards, the necessary amount of the Na-SiO2 support was added to the solution. The obtained suspension was heated to 90 °C under 300 rpm stirring until evaporating most of the excess water. The formed slurry was further dried overnight at 100 °C and then calcined at 500 °C under 100 mL/min of dry air (Linde, dry grade) for 12 h. For reference purposes, bulk vanadium oxide was synthesized by calcining NH4VO3 at 120 °C for 1 h and then at 550 °C for 6 h. In addition, a SiO2 supported vanadium oxide catalyst used as a benchmark was synthesized by the wetness impregnation of a solution of NH4VO3 in oxalic acid (NH4VO3/oxalic acid = 0.5 M). The concentration of vanadium in solution corresponded to 0.0864 × 10−3 μmolal; i.e., the high level of the experimental design. For the synthesis, Na was first removed from the original Na-SiO2 material by first mixed in a beaker with a 1 M HNO3 solution for 4 h at 70 °C and under 100 rpm magnetic stirring. The resulting suspension was vacuum-filtered and washed with deionized water until the washing solution had pH=7. The slurry recovered by filtration was dried for 24 h at 120 °C and then calcined at 450 °C in a static oven for 4 h. The removal of Na from the SiO2 support was verified by collecting high resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectra for the Na 1 s region before and after the procedure, see Fig. S3. The sodium free SiO2 support was then added to the NH4VO3/oxalic acid solution under continuous stirring at 70 °C. The resulting material was thermally treated in the same manner as the sodium loaded catalysts.
2.2. Assessment of physicochemical properties
2.2.1. Point of zero charge of the Na-SiO2 support
The point of zero charge of the Na-SiO2 support was determined by a potentiometric titration procedure. For the procedure, ca. 1.0000 g of Na-SiO2 were suspended in 50 mL with a 0.05% solution of NaNO3. The suspension was equilibrated under such conditions. Afterwards, doses of 0.05 mL of NaOH were automatically added to the suspension in the presence of NaCl as electrolyte. The change in pH was recorded as a function of the added volume of NaOH. The experiments were made with a Metrohm AG instrument controlled by the TIAMO® software. From the results of this test, the surface ionization constants (pKa) were calculated and the corresponding acid-base distribution function for the solid was built, Fig. S2.
2.2.2. Bulk vanadium content
The bulk contents of vanadium of the catalysts were measured by atomic absorption. Samples were dried for 2 h at 110 °C in a 100 mL/min flow of air (Linde, dry grade) before the analyses. The digestion of the samples was done following the protocol proposed by Westerman et al. [55] Particularly, ca. 0.5000 g of the samples were transferred to a polytetrafluoroethylene beaker where they were put in contact with a mixture between 2 and 5 mL of sulfuric acid (Merck, 95–97%) and 5 mL of hydrofluoric acid (Merck, 40%) under heating at 80°C. The procedure was stopped when sulfur trioxide fumes appeared since this indicated that silica was completely dissolved, and that the excess hydrofluoric acid was evaporated. The cooled digests were diluted to 100 mL with deionized water and stored in polythene jars for performing the atomic absorption test. The nomenclature adopted for the synthesized materials was made by considering the results of the atomic absorption analyses. Thus, the catalysts were branded as V(y)-z. Where, y is the wt.% of vanadium of the materials as measured by atomic absorption and z is the pH used for the synthesis. Therefore, for example, a material branded as V(1.30)−1.5 corresponds to a catalyst loaded with 1.5 wt.% vanadium after impregnating the latter at pH = 1.5.
2.2.3. Morphology, porosity, and surface area
The morphology of the materials was assessed by taking images with a scanning electron microscope, SEM. SEM measurements were made in a FEI Quanta 650 FEG instrument operated at an acceleration voltage of 15.00 kV. The analyzed samples were placed on top of carbon adhesive tape and coated with gold for alleviating differential charging effects during the tests. In addition, energy dispersive spectroscopy, EDS, was made over some particles of the materials analyzed by SEM with an EDAX APOLO X detector whose resolution was 126.1 eV (Mn Kα line). EDS tests allowed estimating the chemical composition of some specific particles from selected materials. For reference purposes, a detailed SEM-EDS characterization of the Na-SiO2 support is featured in the Supplementary Information, Section S5.
The porosity of the materials was assessed after measuring the adsorption-desorption isotherms of molecular nitrogen at −196°C. For these measurements, samples of ca. 0.1500 g of each material were weighed inside 9 mm diameter cells made of borosilicate glass (Micromeritics). After weighing, the cells were placed in an outgassing unit (Vac Prep 061, Micromeritics) and heated for 2 h at 200°C in order to remove adsorbed gasses. The duration of the outgassing procedure was defined after finding that the vacuum in the cells reached ca. 0.05 mbar. The weight of the outgassed samples was recorded and used as input data for recording the adsorption-desorption isotherms. The adsorption-desorption isotherms for each sample were measured in a 3FLEX™ (Micromeritics) instrument. Data were recorded in the relative pressure range (P/P0) between 0.0025 and ∼0.9900 using an equilibration time of 10 s. The total pore volume and the pore size distributions were calculated with the Barret-Joyner-Halenda, BJH, method [56] using the MicroActive® software provided with the instrument. However, the produced distribution was only considered for comparison purposes since the software is restricted to pores with cylindrical geometry. In addition, the total specific surface area -SSABET- of the solids was estimated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller, BET, method [57]. The selection of the experimental points used for SSABET calculations was made after applying the Rouquerol transform [58] and checking for the so-called consistency criteria, Table S1. On the other hand, to analyze whether nanoparticles of sodium vanadates formed inside the pores of the support, normalized SSABET, NSSABET, values were calculated using the following equation (E1) [59]:
(1)
Where,
= BET specific surface area of the catalysts and y = weight fraction of vanadium. The interpretation of equation (E1) considers that NSSABET values near 1.0 correspond to very well dispersed phases that do not form nanoparticles causing pore blocking [59,60].
2.2.4. Chemical structure
Raman, UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopic, and X-ray diffraction measurements were done for characterizing the chemical structure of the catalysts. Raman analyses were done for hydrated and dehydrated samples of the fresh and spent catalysts. The dehydration procedure was made under vacuum in the same outgassing unit used for the adsorption experiments. The procedure consisted of drying samples of ca. 0.0500 g at 120°C for 1 h, and then overnight at 300°C. Right after completing the aforementioned treatment, the dehydrated samples were put in sealed bags containing a silica gel desiccant and then rapidly taken out of the bags, deposited over a quartz film of 1 mm of thickness, and transferred to the previously set-up Raman instrument. Spectra were recorded making 40 scans within the range 30 to 1700 cm−1, step of 1.85 cm−1, with a LabRAM HR Evolution Raman Confocal Spectrometer (HORIBA Scientific). The power of the laser of the instrument was fixed at 80 mW. The total acquisition time for recording the spectra depended on the intensity of scattered radiation and ranged from 10 to 500 s. The resolution of the instrument was 1 cm−1, the size of the aperture hole 50 μm, and the grating size 600 grooves/mm. Under these conditions, no degradation of the analyzed samples was observed. In general, the chemical structure of the Na-SiO2 support as assessed by Raman measurements is discussed in the Supplementary Information, Section S6.1.
For the UV–vis diffuse reflectance, UV–vis-DRS, measurements, the hydrated samples were ground in an agate mortar together with a BaSO4 matrix. A film of the finely ground powder was deposited on a small quartz plate which was further covered with another quartz plate of equal size. The UV–vis-DRS spectra were recorded with a UV 2401 PC spectrometer (Shimadzu) within the range 190–900 nm using a step of 1 nm and 70 scans. Data treatment was made after applying the Kubelka-Munk function F(R∞) which depends on the absorption energy hυ, using the equation (E2) [61]:
(2)
Where,
represents the diffuse reflectance measured from a semi-infinite layer.
Edge energies, Eg, were determined from plots of (f(R)*hv)2 as a function of absorption energies and then applying the Tauc method [62] while following the recommendations from Makuła et al. [63] On the other hand, fitting of the recorded spectra was done using the method recommended by Bulanek et al. [64,65] and with the help of the Fityk program (available for free at: https://fityk.nieto.pl/).
Finally, X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed in a BrukerD8 Advanced - Davinci diffractometer equipped with a Cu-Kα radiation source and a Lineal LynxEye detector. Diffraction patterns were recorded between 2θ = 2.0 and 70°, with a step time of 0.6 s which corresponds to a 2θ step of 0.02035°.
2.2.5. Reduction profiles of the catalysts
Reduction profiles from the catalysts were recorded using H2 temperature programmed experiments, TPR. Tests were done in a CATLAB system coupled to a QGA mass spectrometer -MS- (Hiden Analytical). The MS was equipped with both an internal dual electron multiplier detector, SEM, and a Faraday detector, and with a precision quartz inlet heated capillary (QIC) sampling interface. Samples of ca. 0.1000 g were loaded in a quartz tube (1.0 cm i.d.) and pretreated with a 50 mL/min flow of argon at 120°C for 1 h and then at 300°C for 2 h. After cooling down to 50°C, the reactor was fed with a mixture of 2 vol% H2 in Ar (50 mL/min) while the temperature was increased at 5°C/min and up to 900°C. The consumption of hydrogen and the production of water were followed on-line with the MS. Sensitivity factors provided by the Hiden QMS library were used for quantification. The instrument was calibrated with H2 pulses of 10μL, for quantification purposes. However, due to the very low intensity of the acquired signals, it was necessary to approximate hydrogen consumption by calculating the peak area from the water signal. The following stoichiometry was assumed: one mole of H2 per one mole of H2O for every reduction step. Such an assumption was based on the following equation postulated for the removal of lattice oxygen from V2O5 [66]:
.
2.2.6. Basicity of the catalysts
The basicity of the catalysts was analyzed by making CO2 temperature programmed desorption tests. The tests were done in the same equipment as the one used for TPR. Samples of ca. 0.1000 g were pretreated with a 20 mL/min flow of argon at 120°C for 1 h and then at 300°C for 2 h. After cooling down to 50°C, the reactor was fed with a 20 mL/min flow of 10% CO2 in Ar for 1 h. Then, the system was purged with Ar (30 mL/min) for 30 min before starting the test by raising the temperature to 600°C at 5°C/min, adapting the procedure described by Zhao et al. [67].
2.2.7. Surface chemistry
The near surface elemental composition and chemical speciation of the materials were assessed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS. XPS spectra were recorded in the XPS/ISS/UPS-A.Centeno surface characterization platform (SPECS). The platform is equipped with a PHOIBOS 150 2D-DLD analyzer and a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (FOCUS 500). The X-ray source was operated at 100 W and 12 kV. For the analyses, the samples were deposited on a carbon conductive tape which was mounted on a metallic sample holder. Samples were placed inside the instrument via its introduction chamber for outgassing and then moved to the analysis chamber which was at a base pressure of ca. 1 × 10−7 Pa. Spectra were recorded after setting the pass energy of the analyzer at 100 eV, energy step equal to 1.000 eV, for recording general surveys and at 15 eV, energy step equal to 0.050 eV, for recording high-resolution spectra of specific core lines. The charge developed by the surface of the samples by the photoelectron emission process was compensated with an electron flood gun (FG 15/40-PS FG500) operated either between 1 and 10 eV or between 58 and 70 μA, as required for avoiding artificial chemical shifts and deformation of the recorded peaks. The stability of the samples during the analyses was verified by taking spectra from the C 1 s core level at the beginning and at the end of each run. The data recorded for each sample were treated with the CasaXPS software (Casa Software Ltd.) using a U SiO2 Tougaard [68] type baseline and with either LA(y1,y2) or TLA(y1,y2,y3) line shapes. Scofield response sensitivity factors were used for quantification [69].
Six random samples of the Na-SiO2 support were analyzed. The objectives were: (1) to estimate the media of the empirical formula for the surface of the support and (2) to choose the most adequate core line for calibrating the binding energy scale of the spectra. Accordingly, the Si 2p core line fixed at 103.52 eV was selected for calibrating the binding energy scale of the spectra. A detailed account of the results of these measurements is presented in the Supplementary Information of the paper, Section S7. On the other hand, twenty samples were analyzed from randomly selected replicates of the catalysts V(0.19)−1.5, V(1.30)−1.5, V(0.76)−3.8, V(0.19)−9.0, and V(1.59)−9.0.
The surface oxygen uptake capacity of the twenty synthesized materials was assessed by oxygen chemisorption. The measurements were made with a ChermiSorb 2720 (Micromeritics) instrument provided with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Prior to measurements, samples of weights between 0.8000 and 1.0000 g were placed inside a U- shaped quartz reactor and then outgassed under vacuum at 120 °C for 1 h and further at 300 °C for 2 h in the Vac Prep 061 unit mentioned earlier. Then, the samples were placed in the instrument where they were reduced under a flow of 40 mL/min of hydrogen (Linde, 99.99%) at 367 °C during 2 h. At this temperature, pulses of 0.5 mL of oxygen (Cryogas, UHP) were injected to the testing port of the instrument using a calibrated syringe. Time intervals of 5 min were fixed between each injection. Injections were stopped after reaching the saturation of the sample which was evidenced from a stabilization of the value displayed for the area of the integrated signal from the TCD. TCD areas were transformed into oxygen concentrations [cm3 of adsorbed oxygen/g sample] following equation (E3).
(3)
Where, Vinj = volume of injected gas [cm3]; w = sample weight [g]; Ai= area of peak I; Af = area of last peak; Vads = adsorbed volume [cm3/g].
The methodology adopted for the measurements was adapted from the method developed by Oyama et al. [36]. According to these authors [36], under the above mentioned conditions, a complete reduction of the surface of vanadium pentoxide, V2O5, is achieved without reducing the bulk of the oxide. Herein, it will be assumed that these considerations may be extended to vanadium oxides other than V2O5. For calculating the number of exposed vanadium sites, a stoichiometry of one mol of atomic oxygen per mol of exposed vanadium was assumed following the proposal by Nag et al. [70].. Although the accuracy of the method may be called into questioning, its results are nonetheless useful for comparison purposes. On the other hand, it will be assumed that the number of exposed vanadium sites measured with the current method is an acceptable estimation of the number of active sites, albeit the latter may correspond to oxygen moieties; namely, oxygen in V-O-V or V=O linkages, whose intrinsic reactivity in oxidation reactions varies [9,26,31,32,71]. Furthermore, a linear correlation between the results of these measurements and the concentration of vanadium assessed by XPS was found hence ensuring the consistency of the assumptions made for estimating the number of active sites. The reader may refer to the Supplementary Information for details, Section S8.
2.3. Catalytic tests
The catalysts were tested in the oxidation of propane. Tests were carried out in a fixed-bed stainless steel reactor with an internal diameter of 1.18 cm and provided with a porous plate of 10 μm of diameter that was used to support the catalytic bed. Reaction tests were done ramping the temperature from 350 to 500 °C (light-off mode) and then back to 350 °C (light-out mode) using steps of 50 °C. A constant gas hourly space velocity of 4 h−1 referred to propane was used. Catalysts, ca., 0.3000 g of particles with sizes between 180–300 μm, were pretreated in-situ with a 130 mL/min of N2 at 120 °C for 1 h, followed by cooling to ambient temperature before feeding the reactor with the reactants. The reaction feed was composed of a 5:10:115 [mL NTP -NIST definition-/min] mixture of C3H8:O2:N2 set with mass flow controllers (Alicat). All tests were made at atmospheric pressure (∼0.99 atm in Piedecuesta, Colombia). For the VOx/SiO2 benchmark, the reaction protocol was modified by doing the initial temperature ramping up stage up to 550 °C and then the temperature was decreased 50 °C stepwise to 350 °C.
The reaction feed was analyzed at ambient temperature before and after the catalytic test. Reaction products were analyzed using an on-line gas chromatograph -GC- (Shimadzu GC-2014ATT) equipped with both thermal conductivity and flame ionized detectors. The system also has a methanizer for improving the accuracy of the quantification of CO and CO2. For the analyses, the reaction products were separated with both a HayeSep Q and a Molecular Sieve 5A column. Ar (20 mL/min) was used as carrier gas for GC analyses. The temperatures of the GC oven, the TCD, the methanizer, and FID were kept constant at 100 °C, 160 °C, 375 °C, and 200 °C, respectively. Dry air, H2 and Ar (carrier gas) were fed to the system at 35 kPa, 65 kPa, and 60 kPa, respectively. The quantification of the reaction products was made following the methods presented elsewhere [72]. The catalytic performance of the materials was analyzed using conversions -Xi- (equation E5), yields -Yp-(equation E6), selectivity -Sp- (equation E7) using the methods described by Sandoval et al. [72], and apparent reaction rates considering a differential reactor. Further estimation of apparent turnover frequencies, TOF, [s−1] were done with equation (E8), considering the concentration of surface vanadium of each type of catalyst as estimated from O2 chemisorption experiments.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Bulk chemical composition and textural properties
The results of atomic absorption are presented in Table 1. In all instances, the deviation of the measured weight percentages of vanadium from the nominal weight percentages of the synthesis was around 10%. The changes of pH did not influence the amount of vanadium deposited over the Na-SiO2 support. Meanwhile, the increase in the concentration of vanadium in the impregnating solution led to an increase in the loading of vanadium in the catalysts.

Representative SEM pictures of the Na-SiO2 support, the catalysts, and bulk vanadium oxide are presented in Fig. 1 and in Sections S5 and S9. The support showed a large fraction of broken particles. Their microstructure can be described as a collection of large hemi-spherical hollow vesicles containing smaller Na-SiO2 vesicles. On the other hand, almost all the particles of the catalysts were broken. This can be ascribed to their shearing by the magnetic stirrer during the synthesis.

The catalysts synthesized at acidic pH, 1.5 and 3.8, presented microscopic crystals. These microcrystals appeared mixed with the broken husks of the support and, for some regions of the sample, they sprawled from clumps of small particles. The microcrystals formed under conditions other than those typically used for growing crystals with the hydro- and solvothermal methods [73], [74], [75]. Furthermore, they did not resemble those of bulk vanadium oxide, Fig. 1. Basic impurities may directly react with the surface metal oxide species to form nanocrystalline compounds such as CaMoO4, Na2MoO4, and K2MoO4 [51]. However, no reports on the formation of self-supported microcrystals such as the ones found herein were found. At pH = 1.5, clumps of particles near the microcrystals and microparticles of the broken support were also found. Finally, neither microcrystals nor clumps of small particles were observed for the materials synthesized under a basic pH, 9.0; indeed, only broken particles were seen in the micrographs.
Concerning the catalysts, SEM-EDS analysis of the structures found for V(1.30)−1.5 allowed identifying their chemical composition, Section S9. Accordingly, the microcrystals examined with EDS for V(1.30)−1.5 were rich in vanadium; median mole%∼17.2, and poor in silicon, median mole% ∼8.0. EDS data also showed the presence of aluminum as an impurity of the microcrystals, median mole% ∼0.3. The origin of this impurity could be the NH4VO3 salt used for the synthesis [76] or traces of aluminum in the Na-SiO2 support itself. Using the median as a metric to represent the composition of the sampled microcrystals, the following empirical formula was deduced taking vanadium as a calculation basis: (Al0.02Si0.47)Na0.56VO3.61; which hints to the formation of sodium metavanadate microcrystals. On the other hand, the clumps of particles showed a more heterogeneous composition with maxima for silicon and aluminum mole% of ca. 18.3 and 9.8, respectively, while the concentration of vanadium was ca. 5.1 mol%. Two of the EDS examined clumps had a median empirical formula: (Si0.34)Na0.42VO2.20, which was similar to the empirical formula of the microcrystals but without the aluminum impurity. Therefore, some of the observed clumps were made of sodium metavanadate structures. A precise identification of the crystalline structure of the sodium vanadate structures identified by SEM-EDS was not possible by XRD, nonetheless (see Supplementary Information, Section S10). Finally, the microparticles associated with the broken support were the most rich in silicon, median mole%∼32.2, and the most poor in vanadium, median mole%∼1.2, and with a median empirical formula, using silicon as a basis, corresponding to (Na0.04V0.04)SiO2.01. Therefore, these particles were mostly composed of the Na-SiO2 support with vanadium dispersed over them.
The examination by EDS of the particles of V(0.76)−3.8 suggested the existence of a mixture of vanadium oxides and sodium metavanadates; namely, the following empirical formulas were obtained: (Al0.02Si0.33)Na0.01VO0.33 and (Al0.18Si0.66)Na0.43VO1.90. Results also showed the presence of particles mostly composed of silica; median empirical formula: SiO1.50, with some of them showing traces of sodium and vanadium, Fig. S8. Finally, the samples from V(1.59)−9.0 were always rich in silicon and their median empirical formula was: (Na0.02V0.02)SiO1.60. As already mentioned, no discernible vanadium structures were found for this material by SEM. Therefore, it can be deduced that vanadium was best dispersed in the catalysts synthesized at pH = 9.0 as compared to the other catalysts.
Fig. 2 shows the N2 physisorption isotherms and the BJH pore size distribution and accumulative pore volume for a sample of the Na-SiO2 support (a) and for a sample of V(1.59)−9.0 (b). Representative isotherms for the other catalysts can be found in Section S11. In general, both the support and the catalysts showed the same kind of isotherm with unrestricted adsorption at the limit P/P0 ∼1.0 and a very wide hysteresis loop closing at P/P0 ∼0.6. This type of isotherm does not make part of the IUPAC system [77,78]. Adamson proposed that they should be classified as isotherms for solids which are not fully wetted by the adsorbate [79]. Barby, as cited by Rouquerol et al. [80], found similar isotherms for silica xerogels and proposed that they are due to voids of ca. 10 nm between spherical particles. The latter matches the BJH estimation of the average pore size of the Na-SiO2 support studied herein. Concerning the hysteresis loop, it seems to be a mixture of the types H2(b); found for systems where pore blocking effects are present, and H3; which are associated to either non-rigid aggregates of plate-like particles or to a pore network made of macropores which were not filled with liquid N2 [77]. Considering the above literature and SEM observations, the pore network of the materials studied herein may consist of interparticle voids making a mesoporous network connected to larger cavities that make a macropore network.

Table 1 shows the BET surface area of the materials. Repeated measurements of the Na-SiO2 support allowed establishing that its media BET surface area was 18.4 ± 3.5 m2/g (tα=0.01; ν=5), whereas the ensemble of the measured supported catalysts had the media: 9.9 ± 3.5 m2/g (tα=0.01; ν=4) which implies that, regardless of the synthesis conditions, the catalysts had ∼50% less BET surface area than the Na-SiO2 support. Further application of equation (S1) led to a media for the normalized BET area, NSSABET, within the interval 0.604 ± 0.008 (tα=0.01; ν=4), which indicates that there were vanadium structures blocking mesopores [59]. BJH calculations for estimating the pore size distributions of the materials, Fig. 2 and Table 1, further supported the latter hypothesis. Indeed, the media for the average pore diameter of the catalysts was larger, 14.7 ± 2.2 nm (tα=0.01; ν=4) than the one of the Na-SiO2 support; 10.7 ± 0.6 nm (tα =0.01; ν =5), which suggests that the smaller mesopores were blocked by the impregnation of vanadium.
3.2. Chemical structure of the hydrated catalysts
Raman characterization of selected samples of fresh Na-SiO2 (reference, dehydrated state), V(1.30)−1.5, V(0.76)−3.8, and V(1.59)−9.0 in the hydrated state are shown in Fig. 3. The supplementary information features additional Raman spectra for other catalysts, Fig. S5a, different regions of selected catalysts particles, Fig. S5b, as well as for the VOx/SiO2 benchmark, Fig. S5c, Section S6. In general, these spectra confirmed SEM-EDS results showing the heterogeneity of the distribution of the sodium vanadate phases of the catalysts.

Fig. 3. Raman spectra for selected samples of hydrated V(1.30)−1.5, V(0.76)−3.8, and V(1.59)−9.0, and for a sample of dehydrated Na-SiO2, for reference purposes. Nomenclature: V(x)-y. Where, x = nominal vanadium loading, mol.%, and y = impregnation pH.
The Raman spectrum for the sample from V(1.30)−1.5, Fig. 3, shows four consecutive peaks whose intensity decreased as follows: 952 > 917 > 943 ≥ 910 cm−1. This family of peaks matched those ascribed to antisymmetric υ VO2 (900 - 920 cm−1) and symmetric υ VO2 (940–956 cm−1) vibrations in bulk α-NaVO3 and β-NaVO3 crystals [81,82]. The peaks at 511 and 546 cm−1 could be ascribed to symmetric υ V-O-V vibrations while the peak at 640 cm−1 may be due to the antisymmetric υ V-O-V vibration of the same α-NaVO3 structure [81,82]. The peaks at 349 and 369 cm−1 matched those assigned to δVO2 units in α-NaVO3. Meanwhile, the four peaks whose intensity decreased in the order 245 > 254 > 222 ≥ 180 cm−1 belong to different V-O-V vibrations such as: δV-O-V, ρr, ρt, ρw, and chain deformations [81], [82], [83]. Finally, the peaks at 63 and 95 cm−1 belong to lattice modes of either α-NaVO3 or SiO4 tetrahedra, respectively [81,82,84].
The Raman spectrum for hydrated V(0.76)−3.8, Fig. 3, mostly coincided with the pattern for bulk β-NaVO3 with traces of α-NaVO3. Among the bands recorded for this material, five subsequent bands whose intensity decreased in the order 945 > 952 ≥ 887 > 917 > 925 cm−1 were found. Comparing them with those found for V(1.30)−1.5, the band at 945 cm−1 was the strongest for V(0.76)−3.8 while it was one of the weaker for V(1.30)−1.5. Also, the intensity of the band at 952 cm−1 decreased for V(0.76)−3.8 as compared to the same band for V(1.30)−1.5. Finally, the band at 887 cm−1 was not observed for V(1.30)−1.5. This pattern conforms to the β-phase of bulk NaVO3 whose stronger bands are at 888 and 945 cm−1 [81,82]. Furthermore, the strong bands observed at 200, 431, and 739 cm−1 and the weaker ones at 138, 173, 291, 297, and 925 cm−1 are also distinctive of bulk β-NaVO3 as compared to α-NaVO3. Meanwhile, as discussed before, the bands at 254, 512, 643, 917, and 952 cm−1 are characteristic of α-NaVO3 hence suggesting that the catalyst V(0.76)−3.8 is composed of a mixture of α- and β-NaVO3. Finally, the band at 1050 cm−1 may be associated to the vibration of terminal V=O vanadyls stemming from either monomeric or oligomeric VO4 species [9,26,28,35,36,42,46,71,[85], [86], [87], [88]]. According to Wachs [51], four coordinated VO4 units are charge balanced by sodium in structures such as polymeric metavanadates, Nan(VO3)n, dimeric pyrovanadates, Na4V2O7, and isolated orthovanadate, Na3VO4.
According to the above results, the synthesis conditions applied herein led to the formation of two distinct bulk sodium metavanadate crystalline phases; namely, α- and β-NaVO3. This behavior is particular because while α-NaVO3 is a thermodynamically stable phase, β-NaVO3 is metastable [89,90] hence it is supposed to irreversibly transform into α-NaVO3 when calcined from 405 °C [81,89]. However, recent results from Nadjafi et al. [46,91] have shown that silica supported catalysts composed of mixtures of vanadium oxide and sodium vanadate phases also contain the metastable β-NaVO3 phase. Where, the stabilization of β-NaVO3 may be due to its interaction with Na1+xV3O8 and VOx species dispersed over the silica support.
The change between the Raman spectra for the hydrated catalysts synthesized at acidic pH and those synthesized at basic pH was rather drastic. Indeed, the sample from V(1.59)−9.0 showed wide and often poorly defined peaks at 59, 95, 488, 740, 940, and 1040 cm−1 that resembled those found for the Na-SiO2 support. Overall, the pattern of the Raman spectrum and SEM-EDS results for V(1.59)−9.0 suggested that vanadium species were present on this type of catalyst either as an amorphous or nanocrystalline phase. Among the peaks of weak intensity that did not appear in the spectrum of the Na-SiO2 support were those at 178, 261, 323, 387, 431, 470, 611, 809, 888, and 915 cm−1. Among these, the ones at 888 and 915 cm−1 and the feature at 940 cm−1 were also found in the Raman spectrum of V(0.76)−3.8. Also, as already discussed, the peaks observed between 170 and 500 cm−1 originate from V-O-V and VO2 vibrations. Such findings suggested the presence of sodium metavanadate phases (α- and β- phases or some other intermediate phases [44,46,[89], [90], [91]]) for this catalyst. One may wonder whether the recorded spectrum can be ascribed to a sodium orthovanadate, Na3VO4, type structure since similar Raman patterns to the one observed in Fig. 3 have been previously associated to this type of compound [42]. However, the Raman spectrum reported by Sigma-Aldrich [92] for bulk Na3VO4 does not resemble the spectrum found herein. Therefore, the presence of Na3VO4 was discarded. On the other hand, one unintended consequence of synthesizing the catalysts at basic pH is the potential partial dissolution of the support. Particularly, because the dissolution of silica at basic pH is kinetically favored by alkali ions [93]. This process is known to occur by the breakage of surface Si-O-Si bonds that may react with hydroxyl ions to produce adducts of silicic acid, H2SiO42−, which are in equilibrium with H3SiO4− [93], [94], [95]. As discussed earlier, silicas show peaks at 488 and 603 cm−1 that are ascribed to defects [96], [97], [98]. Stolen et al. [99] showed that the intensity of these bands increases with the concentration of OH hydroxyls. For V(1.59)−9.0, the increase in the intensity of the bands at 488 and 611 cm−1 may hence be due to an increase in the relative concentrations of the D2 and D1 defects, respectively. Particularly, the peak at 611 cm−1 would correspond to a red shift of the D1 defect implying a lengthening of the bond associated to this defect.
UV–vis-DRS examination of the hydrated catalysts is shown in Fig. 4. In general, the spectra from the catalysts synthesized at acidic pH had low intensity. Conversely, the spectra for the catalyst synthesized at basic pH was intense as in agreement with the formation of dispersed sodium vanadates. The edge energies of the hydrated samples increased in the order: V(0.76)−3.8 (Eg ∼5.10 eV) ≈ V(1.30)−1.5 (Eg ∼4.99 eV) > V(1.59)−9.0 (Eg ∼3.15 eV). On the one hand, the edge energies for V(1.30)−1.5 and V(0.76)−3.8 differed from the values reported for pure sodium vanadates; namely, 3.28 eV for NaVO3 and 4.17 eV for Na3VO4 [100]. Therefore, the UV–vis-DRS recorded for the hydrated catalysts synthesized at an acidic pH did not correspond to those expected for bulk sodium vanadates or to other vanadates (e.g. Eg-AlVO4 = 3.14, Eg-KVO3 = 3.09, etc. [100]). This finding can be explained by the fact that these materials consisted of self-supported microcrystals and clumps of sodium vanadate particles sparingly dispersed over the Na-SiO2 support. Indeed, the edge energy for SiO2 is 5.79 eV [100] which is a value closer to the one found for the samples of the catalysts synthesized at acidic pH. Also, Catana et al. [101] reported an UV–vis-DRS for silica which shows the same features as the ones found for V(1.30)−1.5 and V(0.76)−3.8. Therefore, the UV–vis-DRS spectra for these catalysts was strongly influenced by the one of the Na-SiO2 support and their interpretation for identifying vanadium species would be doubtful.

The signal for sample V(1.59)−9.0 and its decomposition has been multiplied by 2, to get a better resolution of the entire spectra. Nomenclature: V(x)-y. Where, x = nominal vanadium loading, mol.%, and y = impregnation pH.
On the other hand, the edge energy for hydrated V(1.59)−9.0 was very close to that reported for bulk NaVO3 [100]. In addition, the high intensity of the spectrum for V(1.59)−9.0 was a sign of a higher concentration of more homogeneously distributed vanadium species [102]. Considering that the value of the edge energy for V(1.59)−9.0 was ∼3.15 eV, it is likely that the dominant species for this type of catalyst consists of sodium vanadates whose structure could be similar to that of dimeric pyrovanadates Na4V2O7 [51,96]. Edge energies within the range 3.0 to 3.2 eV are distinctive of polymeric VO4 units [96]. The deconvolution of the UV–vis-DRS spectrum for V(1.59)−9.0 allowed identifying bands at ∼1.8, ∼2.7, ∼3.2, ∼4.3, and ∼5.0 eV, Fig. 4. These bands coincided with the UV–vis-DRS spectra for supported vanadium oxide type catalysts shows several bands in the region between 1.5 and 6.5 eV (850–190 nm) [33,83,96,[101], [102], [103]]. Thus, the bands at ∼1.8 eV were ascribed to d-d absorption bands for O → V+IV transitions [83,101,102]. The bands at ∼2.7 and ∼3.2 eV can be attributed to 2D-square pyramidal or 3D-octahedrally coordinated (group Oh) bulk-like VOx units [83,102]. Finally, the bands at ∼4.3 and ∼5.0 eV were ascribed to tetrahedrally coordinated VOx species (Td symmetry group) [102].

For V(1.30)−1.5, a strong contribution at 1066 cm−1 was found. This contribution can be related to isolated vanadyl species from the sodium vanadates or from (SiO)3V=O structures [9,26,96,104,105,28,35,36,42,46,51,71,[85], [86], [87], [88]]. In the latter case, the band around 927 cm−1 may also be associated either to the formation of bridging V-O-Si bonds from (SiO4)2(VO3)2 structures [87,96,[104], [105], [106]]. Another explanation for the band at 927 cm−1 is that, as discussed earlier, it is due to the vibration of V-O-V bonds from the self-supported β-NaVO3 crystals. In this sense, the bands at 131, 293, 433, 557, 740, and 877 cm−1 can also be associated to β-NaVO3 since they were also found for the hydrated samples of V(0.76)−3.8. These bands added to the ones already characterized as belonging to the α-NaVO3 phase, Fig. 3. Thus, the proposal of an interconversion between the α-NaVO3 and β-NaVO3 phases found further support.
The spectrum from dehydrated V(0.76)−3.8, Fig. 5, kept most of the peaks found for its hydrated counterpart, Fig. 3, while losing the bands at 643 and 952 cm−1 which were associated to the α-NaVO3 phase. Although a band at 1066 cm−1 was also found for dehydrated V(0.76)−3.8, its intensity was very weak as compared to the same band found for V(1.30)−1.5. Therefore, the contribution of this kind of species to the chemical composition of the dehydrated V(0.76)−3.8 catalyst was very low.
The dehydration of V(1.59)−9.0 allowed establishing that, in this state, the material is composed of similar sodium vanadate phases as the ones found for the catalysts synthesized at acidic pH. Particularly, the recorded spectrum showed well defined Raman peaks whose intensity decreased in the order: 949 > 944 > 508 > 917 > 635 > 288 > 124 cm−1 plus some clearly discernible shoulders at 104, 151, 244, 316, 471, 557, 741, and 892 cm−1. Following this evidence, the sodium vanadates in the catalyst V(1.59)−9.0 were more prone to be structurally modified by hydration. According to Gao et al. [96], hydrated vanadium oxides molecularly resemble more V2O5∙nH2O gels than V2O5 crystals. The structure of such a gel would be constituted by chain and/or 2D polymers made of highly distorted square pyramidal VO5 units connected by V-OH-V bridges stabilized by the formation of hydrogen bonds of the type Si-OH∙∙∙V [96]. In addition, the V2O5∙nH2O gel has regions where the V-O-V bonds may hydrolyze to form O-V-(OH)3 species able to migrate over the surface of silica [107]. One may suppose that this kind of behavior is shared by the supported sodium metavanadates studied herein as well, hence explaining the marked differences between the Raman spectra for the hydrated and dehydrated V(1.59)−9.0.
3.4. H2 reduction profiles of the catalysts
Fig. 6 shows the hydrogen temperature reduction profiles for samples of the catalysts V(1.30)−1.5, V(0.76)−3.8, and V(1.59)−9.0, bulk vanadium oxide, and for the VOx/SiO2 benchmark. The TPR pattern of the benchmark showed a peak centered at 628 °C and shoulders at 695 and 761 °C. According to the literature [108], [109], [110], the first peak corresponds to the reduction of V5+ species to VO2 (V4+), while the latter shoulder is associated with further reduction to V2O3 (V3+). The reduction patterns of the V(1.30)−1.5, V(0.76)−3.8, and V(1.59)−9.0 were more complex as compared to the one found for the benchmark. The reduction of V(1.30)−1.5 started around 350 °C and showed its maximum at 424 °C. Afterwards, a feature appeared at 601 °C followed by a last sharp peak at 701 °C and a shoulder at ∼810 °C. The reduction process stopped at 900 °C where the H2O signal returned to its baseline. Accordingly, the reduction of V(1.30)−1.5 started earlier and finished later than the reduction of the benchmark. This trend agrees with literature reports [111,112] in which the addition of alkalis decreased the temperature at which vanadium oxides start to reduce. Such a behavior has been attributed to the formation of bronze-like phases in which the V4+ oxidation state is stabilized [111]. Tentatively, the shift to lower reduction temperatures may be explained when considering that the sodium cation attracts the electron cloud from one of the oxygens of the metavanadate structure hence enlarging the bond distance between the vanadium center and the oxygen linked to sodium. The latter consideration may also partly explain the very broad reduction pattern recorded for V(1.30)−1.5.

On the other hand, V(0.76)−3.8 started reducing at ∼390 °C and its pattern included one summit centered at 665 °C, two lower intensity peaks at 440 and 550, and a shoulder at 805 °C. If the reduction sequence V5+ → V4+ → V3+ is assumed to take place, one may thus say that most of the vanadium was present as V4+ for this catalyst. On the other hand, the reduction peaks at 550 and 665 °C had an approximately constant shift of ∼50 °C to lower temperatures in regards to the peaks at 601 and 701 °C from V(1.30)−1.5.
The reduction pattern for V(1.59)−9.0 was very similar to the one found for V(0.76)−3.8. But, the summit and the lower temperature shoulders of the profile for V(1.59)−9.0 were shifted ∼30 °C higher as compared to the same features for V(0.76)−3.8. Some authors [113,114], have shown that larger supported vanadium oxide structures are harder to reduce as compared to smaller ones. However, this latter explanation did not coincide with the tendencies found for the SiO2 supported sodium vanadate phases presented herein. Indeed, an estimation of the consumption of H2 during TPR experiments showed that H2 consumption decreased with the size of the vanadium structures according to the following: bulk V2O5 (23.29 μmol H2/g) > V(1.30)−1.5 (1.72 μmol H2/g) > V(0.76)−3.8 (0.96 μmol H2/g) > VOx/SiO2 benchmark (0.90 μmol H2) > V(1.59)−9.0 (0.80 μmol H2/g). Hence, instead of the explanation presented in the literature [113,114], it seems that the reducibility of the current supported sodium vanadates could be rather associated to the aforementioned stabilization of V4+ species by sodium cations which agrees with the already discussed Raman results for the dehydrated catalysts.
Considering the above, the recorded temperature programmed profiles allowed to conclude that: (1) the supported sodium vanadate catalysts started reducing at lower temperatures than the VOx/SiO2 benchmark and the bulk V2O5; and, (2) The catalysts V(0.76)−3.8 and V(1.59)−9.0 had lower reducibility than the V(1.30)−1.5 catalyst. This trend was correlated to the size of the sodium vanadate structures which was lower for the former.
3.5. Surface chemical state of the catalysts
The description of the surface chemical state of the catalysts comprises the elemental composition and distribution of chemical species as measured with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the dispersion of exposed vanadium sites as estimated from O2 chemisorption experiments, and the basicity of the catalysts assessed by the temperature programmed desorption of CO2.
3.5.1. Surface chemical composition
Fig. 7 features main effects and interaction plots for statistically assessing the effects of the factors studied during the synthesis of the catalysts over the surface concentration of vanadium, the whole data set is presented in Section S12. Accordingly, the pH and the concentration of vanadium in the impregnating solution had weak (i.e., the averages of the XPS surface concentration of vanadium at each experimental level were very near to the limits of a 95% t-Student confidence interval for the mean of the whole data set) negative and positive effects, respectively, over the surface concentration of vanadium. On the other hand, the interaction plots for the pH and the concentration of vanadium in the impregnating solution showed parallel lines hence ruling out non-additive effects over the output variable. A supplementary analysis of how impregnation pH and vanadium solution concentration influenced the concentration of exposed vanadium was made from the data collected during O2 chemisorption experiments, Fig. S11 (raw data are found in Table S4). The results of this analysis basically coincided with those made with XPS, but the positive effect of the concentration of vanadium in solution over the concentration of exposed vanadium measured by O2 chemisorption appeared stronger. On the other hand, comparing the surface concentration of vanadium of the sodium vanadate-based catalysts with the one measured for the VOx/SiO2 benchmark, Table S3, no evidence about an increase in the dispersion of vanadium due to sodium was found. In this sense, empirical formulas describing the composition of the surface of the catalysts are presented in Table 2. The formulas showed that the surface of the catalysts V(0.19)−1.5, V(0.19)−9.0, and V(0.76)−3.8 was enriched by sodium while the stoichiometry of the surface of the catalysts V(1.30)−1.5 and V(1.59)−9.0 was closer to the one of NaVO3 as compared to the other catalysts. In addition, results also suggested that residual NaNO3 and parent ONOO−moieties were present at the surface of the catalysts when the synthesis was made at acidic pH, see high resolution N 1 s spectra in Section S14 of the Supplementary Information.

Concerning the influence of pH and [V]sol over the distribution of surface chemical species, Figs. 8–10 are statistical plots for analyzing the binding energies displayed by the Na 1 s, O 1 s, and V 2p3/2 core lines of the spectra recorded for the samples of the catalysts. In the case of the Na 1 s core line, only the concentration of vanadium in solution produced a significant effect over the position of the peak, Fig. 8b. The highest concentration of vanadium in solution led to a shift of the Na 1 s core line of ∼−0.4 eV; i.e., the average binding energy for Na 1 s core line for the catalysts synthesized with the highest concentration of vanadium in solution was ∼1073.2 eV. A negative shift in the position of an XPS core line is interpreted as an increase in the reduction state (or vice versa a decrease in the oxidation state) of the element. Therefore, these results suggested that increasing the concentration of vanadium in the impregnation solution led to more reduced surface sodium species. In this sense, Kishi et al. [115] showed that lower concentrations of sodium over an oxidized V/Cu(100) surface resulted in more reduced sodium species. According to the plots done for the position of the summit of the O 1 s core line, Fig. 9, neither the pH nor the concentration of vanadium had statistical effects that overcame the 95% confidence limit threshold. However, a negative correlation between the O 1s binding energy and pH was found in the main effect plot of pH. This suggested that pH had a weak effect over the position of the O 1s core level; namely, increasing pH led to more reduced oxygen species. In addition, the crossover found for the interaction plots, Fig. 9c and 9d, indicated the existence of an interaction effect. In this case, the interaction was synergistic for the [V]sol × pH plot and antagonistic for the pH × [V]sol plot [52] which implied that its origin was related to other factors not considered in the statistical analysis of the experiment. Therefore, a closer examination of the components of the O 1s core line for all the studied materials was made. The analysis of the data (Supplementary Information, Section S15) led to conclude that the oxygen at the surface of the catalytic support comprises three species: bridging oxygen; Si-O-Si bond [116], non bridging oxygen, Si-O−-Na+ moieties [117][116], and oxygen making part of Si-O-Si-O−-Na+ abducts [118]. The presence of the aforementioned species was coherent with the Raman analyses made earlier for the support, Fig. 3.

On the other hand, besides the species found for the support, several samples of the catalysts showed oxygen components associated to oxygen bound to vanadium for which two stoichiometries were determined; namely, VO∼1.0 and VO∼2.0. Further analysis of the recorded V 2p core line showed that the increase in the concentration of vanadium in the impregnating solution led to more reduced vanadium species. More precisely, the increase in the concentration of vanadium led to a monotonous decrease in binding energy of the V 2p3/2 core level from ∼518.3 to 517.7 eV, Fig. 10. It was not possible to find a systematic study on the XPS characterization of silica supported sodium vanadates in the literature. But, a comparison of the binding energies measured in this work with those reported for bulk vanadium oxides, bulk NaVO3, and silica supported vanadium oxides yields useful information, though. In this sense, careful and detailed XPS studies made for bulk vanadium oxides [119], [120], [121] show that there is an average ∼1.0 eV difference between V5+ and V4+ species in bulk vanadium oxides, where the V 2p3/2 core line for the former typically shows binding energies around ∼517.5 eV whereas the latter appears at ∼516.0 eV. On the other hand, bulk NaVO3 [122] and bulk Na3VO4 [123] typically show the V 2p3/2 core line at ∼517.5 eV hence implying that vanadium is as V5+ in sodium vanadates as well. Therefore, it seems safe to conclude that the binding energies of the V 2p3/2 core line recorded for the catalysts studied herein mostly correspond to V5+ species associated with the chemical structures studied earlier in the paper. Particular attention was brought to the fact that several catalysts displayed V 2p3/2 peaks at binding energies around and higher than 518 eV, Figs. 10 and S12. Some authors have found similar results for supported vanadium oxide catalysts and have proposed that such a tendency is due to highly dispersed vanadium species [124,125]. Such a proposal was tested by plotting the recorded V 2p3/2 binding energies as a function of the surface concentration of vanadium, Fig. S13. The observed tendency led to reject the hypothesis that the binding energies higher than 518 eV recorded for the V 2p3/2 peak were due to an increase in dispersion because there was an inverse dependency of the binding energy on the concentration of surface vanadium. An alternative interpretation of the high binding energies found some of the V 2p3/2 peaks can be postulated considering that an increase in binding energy in XPS implies a decrease in the electron density around the assessed element. As a consequence, the peaks at higher binding energies for vanadium have a higher Lewis acidic character than those at lower binding energies [126]. Therefore, it was considered that the V 2p3/2 peaks with binding energies higher than 518 eV corresponded to more acidic vanadium species. Further correlation of the surface Na/V molar ratios of the catalysts with the binding energy of the V 2p3/2 peak, Fig. S14, provided support for this proposal since the Na/V molar ratio had a positive effect on the binding energy of the V 2p3/2 peak.

3.5.2. Basicity of the catalysts
Fig. 11 presents the results for CO2 temperature desorption tests made for representative samples of the catalysts V(1.30)−1.5, V(0.76)−3.8, and V(1.59)−9.0. The recorded profiles showed the following: (i) the total basicity of the catalysts decreased as follows: V(1.30)−1.5 (0.32 μmol CO2/g) > V(0.76)−3.8 (0.25 μmol CO2/g) > V(1.59)−9.0 (0.09 μmol CO2/g). (ii) V(1.30)−1.5 had both weak; CO2 desorption peak at 142 °C, and strong basic sites; with a CO2 desorption region showing a shoulder at 460 °C, a sharp peak summit at ∼530 °C, and a final shoulder at 585 °C. (iii) V(0.76)−3.8 only had strong basic sites with a broad desorption region with three summits at 412, 500, and 585 °C. Where, the latter was the sharpest peak. (iv) V(1.59)−9.0 had the poorest basicity with the least intense CO2 signal. The catalyst showed a very broad desorption region at low temperature (up to ∼150 °C) and another very broad desorption region with broad peaks at 460 and 585 °C.

The above tendencies showed the influence of the impregnation pH over the basicity of the catalysts; namely, the total basicity of the catalysts decreased with increasing pH and the relative distribution of basic sites was also modified by pH. These effects can be related to the differences in chemical structure of the catalysts discussed in the previous sections. Indeed, one may recall that the chemical structure of the catalysts synthesized at acidic pH, V(x)−1.5 and V(0.76)−3.8, mostly consisted on microcrystalline sodium vanadate structures while at basic pH particles of sodium vanadates were formed. Furthermore, the XPS analysis made earlier showed that the surface of the catalysts impregnated at basic pH was populated by more acidic species.
3.6. Catalytic reactivity of the materials
First, an analysis of the conversion of propane and the products yields will be presented and discussed as a function of time on stream and reaction temperature. Second, the tendencies concerning the distribution of products found during the experiments is made. Finally, a discussion about the catalytic performance grounded on kinetic considerations is done.
3.6.1. Analysis of the evolution of the conversion of reactants
Fig. 12 shows the evolution of the conversions (Xi) and products yields (yj) as a function of time on stream for the oxidation of propane over representative samples of the synthesized catalysts. The behavior of the silica support and of the other replicates of the catalysts is found in Section S16. In general, both the conversions of propane and oxygen were below 0.15 for the V(x)-y catalysts. Therefore, it was considered that the reactor was operated in a differential mode.

Where, x = nominal vanadium loading, mol.%, and y = impregnation pH.
Overall, the catalysts synthesized at pH=9.0 performed best in the reaction of oxidation of propane in terms of both stability and consumption of propane and oxygen. Regarding the latter, its consumption in oxidative dehydrogenation reaction is seldom discussed in the literature despite its importance for a potential commercialization the process [8,10]. Meanwhile, the catalysts synthesized at acidic pH showed the lowest performance among the synthesized catalysts. Though such a trend may be due to a deleterious effect of surface NaNO3 and ONOO− moieties detected by XPS, the results featured herein did not allow confirming this proposal. Furthermore, it was not possible to find any literature report on the effects of these species over propane oxidation.
A comparison of these trends with the one exhibited by a VOx/SiO2 benchmark, Fig. S16, showed that the evolution of the active phase of supported vanadium oxide differ from the one displayed by the active phase of supported sodium vanadates synthesized herein. Indeed, the stability of the current series of catalysts was analyzed by statistically comparing (t-Student test) conversions at 450 °C before and after ramping the reaction temperature to 500 °C, Table S6. In this sense, the catalyst V(1.30)−1.5 kept the same performance throughout this test while the catalysts V(0.76)−3.8 and V(1.59)−9.0 changed their performance after ramping down to the temperature to 450 °C. Particularly, as shown in Fig. 12, the conversion of the reactants over V(1.59)−9.0 increased after ramping down the temperature while those for V(0.76)−3.8 decreased. It was noticeable that at 500 °C, there was a strong positive gap between the conversions of O2 and C3H8 for V(0.76)−3.8 and basically no gap between the latter two for V(1.59)−9.0.
The above findings suggested that the initial sodium vanadate phases of the catalysts evolved differently during the catalytic tests. Specifically, there would have not being an evolution of the active phase of the catalyst synthesized at pH=1.5 regardless of the changes in temperature. Meanwhile, the active phases of the catalysts synthesized at pH=3.8 and pH=9.0 would have evolved at 500 °C with time on stream under the reaction atmosphere. To investigate this hypothesis, Raman analysis of the spent catalysts in their dehydrated state was carried out and it is shown in Fig. 13. Considering these results (described in detail in the Supplementary Information, Section S6.2) and those presented earlier, Table 3 summarizes the evolution of the chemical structure of the catalysts as characterized by Raman and UV-DRS. Accordingly, the following was concluded: (1) the active phase of the catalysts synthesized at pH=1.5 mostly corresponded to α-NaVO3 structures belonging to bulk self-supported microcrystals which were chemically stable under the studied reaction conditions. However, the performance of this material was the poorest among the synthesized catalysts. (2) When pH=3.8, i.e., the chemical structures that were present at the beginning of the reaction were mostly of the β-NaVO3 type (dehydrated catalysts, Fig. 5) and evolved into an active phase related to α-NaVO3. (3) When pH=9.0, the active phase of the catalyst was also ascribed to the formation of a α-NaVO3 type phase whose chemical structure did not seem to evolve with time on stream during the catalytic tests, Fig. 5. Although, its catalytic performance positively evolved towards a higher activity which did not sacrifice propene selectivity. As such, the behavior observed for this catalyst may be related to the possible presence of a combination of low temperature reactant adsorption effects and to diffusion and thermal effects [127], [128], [129]. In this sense, V(1.59)−9.0 displayed what is called a normal hysteresis behavior; i.e., the conversion of reactants was higher during light-out, Figs. 12 and S17. When analyzing hysteresis, a sudden and strong increase in conversion during the light-off branch of the reaction is called ignition [130]. In the case of the oxidation of hydrocarbons such as methane and propene, there is evidence [131,132] that hysteresis may be associated to the formation of surface carbonaceous sites that form from the dissociative adsorption of the hydrocarbon and to the enrichment of the surface of the catalyst by chemisorbed oxygen. However, the Raman spectra recorded for spent catalysts, Fig. 13, did not support this explanation. On the other hand, the most traditional explanation of the hysteresis phenomenon is that ignition leads to overheating of the active sites of the catalysts which can neither be quenched by the gaseous stream passing through the reactor nor can it be sensed by the thermocouple in contact with the catalytic bed [127]. If this is the case, the strength of the hysteresis phenomenon should depend on the conversion of the hydrocarbon. A comparison between the hysteresis curves for a sample from one of the replicates of the V(1.59)−9.0 catalyst and the VOx/SiO2 benchmark suggested that this may be the case for the benchmark whose conversion of both propane and oxygen was allowed to reach higher levels during testing. Meanwhile, if this was the effect determining the increase in conversion for V(1.59)−9.0 its impact was rather weak.

3.6.2. Analysis of the evolution of the reaction products
Concerning the distribution of products, CO2 was the main reaction product for all catalysts, and its yield was followed by the ones to C3H6 and CO, Figs. 12, S15, and S16 and Tables S7 and S8. Water was also detected in the exit stream of the reactor, but it was not quantified since its production was dictated by stoichiometry. The catalyst V(0.76)−3.8 displayed an enhancement of the consumption of oxygen that specifically promoted the production of CO2, Fig. 12. In this sense, the recorded trends may be related to the difference in the nature of the oxygen belonging to the lattice of the active phase and the oxygen chemically adsorbed on the catalyst; these differences were already discussed in the XPS section of the paper. In addition, various authors have postulated that adsorbed electrophilic oxygen is responsible for the combustion of the alkanes in oxidation reactions [8,10,13,133]. Such an analysis also agreed with the studies of Chen et al. [134,135] who concluded that the rate of formation of propene is independent, zero order, of the partial pressure of oxygen for conventional oxide supported catalysts. In addition, the catalysts V(0.76)−3.8 and V(1.59)−9.0 produced measurable traces of H2 and CH4 at 500 °C. Comparing the behavior of the catalysts synthesized at acidic pH with the one at basic pH, the former had larger yields to CO2 than to C3H6. Particularly, at 500 °C, the yields to CO2 over these catalysts were roughly up to fourfold larger than the yields to C3H6. Meanwhile, the ratio between the yields to CO2 and C3H6 was close to one. Finally, it was observed that the yields to C3H6 were always higher than the yields to CO for all the catalysts.
An analysis of the selectivity to C3H6 at 500 °C is presented next. The catalysts V(1.30)−1.5 and V(0.76)−3.8 showed almost the same average steady state selectivity to C3H6; namely, 0.061±0.016 and 0.068±0.003, respectively, despite the differences in the conversion found for these two catalysts. For the catalyst V(1.59)−9.0, the average steady state selectivity to C3H6 was 0.152±0.003; a value which was the highest for all catalysts while the conversions of both O2 and C3H8 were the highest, Fig. 12. Also for V(1.59)−9.0, after ramping down the temperature to 450 °C the steady state selectivity to C3H6 was slightly higher; 0.185±0.001, for conversions of C3H8 and O2 of 0.058 and 0.044, respectively. Additional analysis of the dependency of selectivity with the conversion of propane, Fig. S18, showed that within the range of conversion obtained for V(1.30)−1.5 and V(0.76)−3.8, Fig. S18a and S18b, respectively, the latter weakly but negatively affected the selectivities to propene and CO2 while negatively while the selectivity to CO was positively but weakly affected. Meanwhile, V(1.59)−9.0 showed the same kind of effects as above but with relatively higher intensity, Fig. S18c. The above effects of conversion over selectivity for the sodium vanadate catalysts were, in general, similar in nature to those observed for the VOx/SiO2 benchmark, Fig. S18d, and to those reported in the literature [8,10,13,22]. However, at 500 °C, the selectivity to C3H6 displayed by the benchmark was lower than the selectivity displayed by the catalyst V(1.59)−9.0 (SC3H6 = 0.152±0.003) at the same level of conversion of propane, XC3H8 = 0.100±0.001, but with a lower consumption of oxygen, XO2 = 0.111±0.001.
The results described above ratify that the catalyst V(1.59)−9.0, which is based on dispersed sodium vanadate particles of the α-NaVO3 type phases constituted mainly by V4+ species and had lower basicity, performed best. The recent literature has shown similar results in the case of both Na doped silica supports over which 2D vanadium oxide structures are formed [44,45] and sodium vanadates were impregnated over silica [46,91], see Table S8. Particularly, Grant and co-workers [44,45] used both a silica where Na was present as an impurity (Na-SiO2) and a silica over which a solution of NaNO3 was impregnated as supports for vanadium oxides whose impregnation was made with a dry isopropanol solution of vanadium triisopropoxide under a dry N2 atmosphere. For the catalysts synthesized over the Na-SiO2 support, the authors reported the formation of V2O5 nanoparticles whose propane conversion was kept below 0.09, T = 490 °C, O2/C3H8 molar ratio = 0.5 -so-called reducing conditions-, and whose selectivity decreased from SC3H6 ∼0.60 at XC3H8 ∼0.02 to SC3H6 ∼0.40 at XC3H8 ∼0.07 as a function of dispersion; namely, higher dispersion led to 2D vanadium oxide structure that were more active, i.e., higher apparent TOFs, and selective to propene than Na promoted V2O5 nanoparticles. On the other hand, Nadjafi et al. [46,91] impregnated aqueous solutions of NaVO3 and sodium decavanadate, Na6V10O28, mixed with oxalic acid over silica. The authors tested their catalysts at 450 °C using the same O2/C3H8 molar ratio as Grant et al. [44,45] The importance of the latter condition is not to be neglected since it is known that reducing conditions lead to higher propene selectivities [136,137]. In contrast, the current work used so-called oxidizing conditions; namely, the O2/C3H8 molar ratio was 2.0, which has been established to lower the selectivity to propene.
3.6.3. Kinetic considerations regarding the behavior of the catalysts
Let us now analyze the effects of the pH, the concentration of vanadium in solution during impregnation, and their interaction over the apparent turnover rates of C3H8 and O2 at 500 °C. Figs. 14 and S19 show main effects and interaction plots, respectively, done for this purpose (the reader may find discriminated turnovers for each tested catalyst in Tables S7 and S8). The results of the aforementioned analysis showed that only the pH had a statistically positive significant effect over the apparent turnovers of C3H8 and O2. This effect produced larger apparent turnovers for the catalysts synthesized at pH=3.8 and pH=9.0; where, the average C3H8 and O2 apparent turnovers for these latter two types of catalysts were not statistically different. The input variables studied during synthesis did not have non-additive effects over the apparent turnovers as evidenced in Fig. S19. From characterization results, the above trends seem rather related to the already described differences in vanadium dispersion, reducibility, and acid-base properties.

On the other hand, the catalytic results led to postulate the reaction paths for propane oxidation showed in Scheme 1. Accordingly, propene may be produced either by the direct dehydrogenation of propane (A) or via the indirect oxidative route (B). Regardless of the route, one may notice that the desorption constants, Kdes-A and Kdes-B, play a key role in determining the selectivity of the catalyst. Roughly, these desorption constants must be large enough as to favor the desorption of propene rather than its further oxidation and combustion. Adsorption constants are a function of the enthalpies and entropies of adsorption of the surface intermediates. In this sense, while enthalpy is a measure of the strength of the interaction between the active phase (♣)) and the adsorbed intermediates, entropy is a measure of the degree of coordination of the adsorbed intermediates with the active phase. For the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, this translates into the need of a catalyst with an oxidizing active phase able to break one of the C-H bonds of propane, form a surface allylic double bond, and then desorb propene before it can undergo further oxidation. At present, it is well accepted that the active sites for hydrocarbon oxidation over vanadium based catalysts are surface oxygen moieties linked to vanadium [8,9,133,135,[138], [139], [140],10,12,13,[26], [27], [28], [29],31]. These moieties are consumed by the reaction and then replenished by oxygen from the gas phase that is activated by surface vanadium, hence completing a redox cycle. The turnover rate of the redox cycle can thus be considered to depend in part on the Lewis acidity of the vanadium moieties. Therefore, more acidic vanadium species would be able to do faster turnovers provided that a very fast rate of surface diffusion of the activated oxygen happens. However, given the consecutive pathway of propane oxidation, the faster the surface diffusion of activated oxygen in the catalyst is the higher the probability of burning the adsorbed hydrocarbon intermediates.
H2-TPR results showed that the reduction of the sodium vanadate based catalysts started at lower temperatures as compared to the VOx/SiO2 benchmark, Fig. 6; a finding that has been reported earlier [9,32,42,46,141]. Overall, sodium, and other alkalis, increase the reducibility of the vanadate moieties and, in turn, regulate, to some extent, the rate of oxygen transfer to the activated surface hydrocarbons. In this sense, Martín et al. [142] reported that sodium in vanadium oxide supported catalysts strongly weakens the adsorption of propene over vanadium oxide to an extent where it is reduced to physisorption and this thwarts the reduction of V5+ to V4+. The presence of sodium would increase Kdes-B in the oxidative dehydrogenation route of reaction.
Another aspect worth considering is how the strong consumption of oxygen by the catalyst seemed to directly translate into CO2 production, Fig. 12. In this regard, Oyama and others [133,143] established that the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethene and other selective oxidation products is structure insensitive while the oxidation of ethane to COx is structure sensitive. Taking advantage of the variations in the number of active sites found for the four replicates of the catalyst V(1.59)−9.0, Table S4, an analysis of the structure sensibility of the reaction in terms of both the turnover rates of propane and of oxygen is presented next.
Fig. 15 plots the apparent steady state turnover rates of propane and oxygen as a function of the initial number of active sites of the four replicates of the catalyst as measured at 500 °C. The four experimental averages presented in these plots are compared to a 95% t-Student confidence interval, υ = 32, for the global average of all measurements. Given that all the experimental points fell out of the corresponding confidence intervals, the observed effects were statistically significant. Therefore, it can be assumed that both the transformation of oxygen and of propane were structure insensitive. This was in agreement with previous literature studies [133]. Fig. 16 plots the apparent steady state TOFs for propene, CO2, CO, and H2 as a function of the apparent TOF of the reactants. The slopes of the rates for propene and CO2 were the same in each plot. This indicated that the reactions that led to both products had the same reaction rate constants; a fact that corroborates that both reactions are kinetically controlled by the same elementary step. Furthermore, the apparent TOFs for propene were within the range of those reported by other authors who have investigated the catalytic performance of either Na-promoted 2D VOx/SiO2 [44] or Na6V10O28/SiO2 and α-NaVO3/SiO2 [46] in propane oxidation under reducing reaction atmospheres, see Tables S7–S9 for comparison purposes. Consequently, the current results confirm previous kinetic studies that demonstrated that the production rate of propene has a zero order dependency on oxygen concentration [134,144,145].

According to the literature, the activation of one of the CH bonds of propane is the rate determining step in the oxidation of propane [[8], [9], [10],12,35,133,134]. Particularly, Chen et al. [134] showed that the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane and its combustion have similar activation energies hence the steps that determine the selectivity propene/CO2 is defined for what may occur after the activation of the C-H bond of propane; which in turn depends on the ratio Kdes-B/k3, Scheme 1. Therefore, in this case, the highest production of propene for the catalysts synthesized at pH=9.0 may be ascribed to sodium decreasing the adsorption energy of propene, as discussed previously. On the other hand, the slopes of the straight lines for CO were always ca. half of the slopes for propene and CO2. Therefore, the rate constant for producing CO should be half the rate constant for propane activation. This suggested that CO production followed the same reaction path as CO2.
The slopes for the linear relationships for the TOFs of hydrogen as a function of the TOFs of the reactants were very small and negative as compared to the other products hence suggesting that the detected H2 could be formed by a reaction mechanism other than the one followed for oxidative dehydrogenation. Namely, hydrogen could have been produced either by direct dehydrogenation, route A, Scheme 1, or by the reforming of propane, e.g., Equation (v), Section S1. Aiming to get an insight into the production of H2, further analysis of the thermodynamics of the system (p = 1 atm; O2/C3H8 molar ratio = 2) was carried out by means of the Chemical Equilibrium Calculation tool available for free at: http://navier.engr.colostate.edu/code/code-4/index.html. According to the authors, this tool is based on the STAJAN interactive program developed by Reynolds using the element potential method for equilibrium analysis. Fig. 17 shows the dependency on temperature (a1) of the propane and oxygen conversion when H2 is produced (Fig. 17a1), the equilibrium molar fractions of C3H6, CO2, CO, H2O, and H2 for case (a1) (Fig. 17a2), (b1) the propane and oxygen conversion when no H2 is produced (Fig. 17b1), and (b2) the equilibrium molar fractions of C3H6, CO2, CO, and H2O for this case (Fig. 17b2).

Scheme 1. General reaction paths on the catalytic oxidation of propane.
The results of the thermodynamic analysis show that under the current conditions, oxygen is always fully consumed. Meanwhile, propane reached full conversion at 500 °C when hydrogen was produced (Fig. 17a1), but the maximum conversion of propane was 0.70 at 700 °C when hydrogen was not produced (Fig. 17b1). On the other hand, when hydrogen was produced (Fig. 17a2), its production started at ∼150 °C and then increased simultaneously with the decrease in the equilibrium molar fraction of water. Under the aforementioned conditions, the molar fraction of CO2 remained approximately constant up to 400 °C whence its production decreased until reaching a minimum at ∼650 °C. Conversely, the molar fraction of CO increased up to 0.35 at the latter temperature. Concerning propene, its maximum equilibrium molar fraction was reached between 450–475 °C, but the estimated fractions were three orders of magnitude lower than those estimated for the other reaction products. On the other hand, when no hydrogen was included in the system (Fig. 17b1 and 17b2), the equilibrium molar fraction of propene increased one order of magnitude, while the molar fractions of CO2 and CO showed the same trends as those previously described considering the formation of H2 (Fig. 17a2). In addition, the molar fraction of H2O remained rather constant within the studied temperature range. The thermodynamic behavior discussed so far, allow establishing that the reactions described by the equations (i)-(v), Introduction section and Fig. S1, do not suffice to describe the chemical equilibrium of the system. Particularly, the fact that the production of both H2 and CO increased while H2O and CO2 were consumed suggest that at equilibrium conditions propane reforming with H2O (C3H8 +3H2O
3CO +7H2,
) and CO2 (C3H8 +3CO2
6CO + 4H2,
) [21,146] plays an important role. Furthermore, according to thermodynamics, under the current reaction conditions -oxidizing environment-, the reforming reactions are more relevant for the production of H2 than the endothermic direct dehydrogenation or propane (C3H8
C3H6 + H2,
[147]), and than the water gas shift reaction (CO + H2O
CO2 + H2,
) which has been used for producing H2 when the oxidation of propane is made over vanadium oxide based catalysts and under reducing conditions [10,23,148].
Conclusions
The effects of pH, the concentration of vanadium in solution, and of their interaction; i.e., non-additive effect, over the properties of Na-SiO2 (hollow vesicles, surface area ∼18 m2/g, mesopores of average diameter of ∼11 nm, and ∼1.0 wt.% Na) supported catalysts used for the oxidation of propane under oxygen rich conditions, O2/C3H8/ molar ratio = 2.0, were studied in this work. The results of the study led to the following conclusions: (1) Neither the pH and the solution concentration of vanadium influenced the net difference between the nominal and final loadings of vanadium in the catalysts (∼10%) nor their surface area and porosity. However, all catalysts presented a ∼50% decrease in surface area due to partial mesopore blocking reflected by a ∼30% increase in the average pore diameter. (2) The Na present in the support as either extra-framework (majority); i.e., Si-O-Si-O−-Na+, or intra-framework (minority); i.e., Si-O−-Na+ reacted with the dissolved NH4VO3 and led to the formation of different sodium metavanadates of different particle sizes depending on the pH. Namely, when the pH was 1.5, i.e., below the point of zero charge of the support, PZC=3.5, large self-supported α-NaVO3 (majority) and β-NaVO3 (minority) microcrystals mixed with particles from the support were found in the hydrated catalysts. At pH=3.8 ∼PZC, both self-supported microcrystals β-NaVO3 (majority) and α-NaVO3 (minority) and clumps of sodium metavanadate particles were found in the hydrated catalysts. While, at pH=9.0 nanoparticles of sodium metavanadates were found most likely making a dispersed gel in the hydrated state of the catalysts. An interconversion between the α-NaVO3 and β-NaVO3 phases was evidenced after dehydrating the catalysts. After the reaction tests, a mixture of the α-NaVO3 and β-NaVO3 phases prevailed in the catalysts. (2) The reactivity of the sodium vanadate phases increased with a decrease in particle size and with the increase of both the relative concentration of V4+ species and the acidity of the catalysts. In this sense, increasing the pH during the synthesis of the catalysts favored the catalytic activity. Therefore, the catalysts synthesized at pH=9.0 and with the highest concentration of vanadium in solution showed the best catalytic performance. Overall, under the conditions used herein, increasing the concentration of vanadium during impregnation led to increasing the surface concentration of vanadium in the catalysts. (3) The performance of the catalysts evolved with time on stream and temperature during the light-off/light-out cycles as a function of pH. Particularly, normal hysteresis was found for the catalysts synthesized at pH=3.8 and pH=9.0. An examination of the evolution of the conversions of oxygen and propane at 500 °C allowed establishing that a larger consumption of oxygen from the feed translates into a higher production of CO2. This effect was mitigated by the catalysts synthesized at pH=9.0 that displayed a roughly similar selectivity to propene than a VOx/SiO2 benchmark, where the latter consumed more oxygen from the feed. (4) An analysis of the apparent turnover rates recorded for the catalysts synthesized at pH=9.0 allowed establishing that both the catalytic reactions of propane and oxygen are structure insensitive. Furthermore, the collected evidence allowed corroborating that both the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene and its combustion to CO and CO2 are kinetically controlled by the initial activation of one of the C-H bonds of propane. On the other hand, as hydrogen was produced during the reaction tests, a thermodynamic analysis of the reaction system evidenced that under oxidizing reaction atmospheres the reforming of propane is more favorable than other commonly considered reactions such as the direct dehydrogenation of propane and the water gas shift reaction. The ensemble of these findings contributes to the understanding of sodium promoted vanadium oxide systems supported on silica; a topic that has been reinvigorated very recently.
