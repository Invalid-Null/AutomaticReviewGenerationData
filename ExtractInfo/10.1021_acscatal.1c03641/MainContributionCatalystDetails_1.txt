 Based on my analysis of the document, this does not appear to be related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation for converting propane to propylene. The document focuses on characterization and kinetic studies of Zn-exchanged H-ZSM-5 (Zn/H-ZSM-5) catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and cracking, but does not provide specific details on enhancing propane dehydrogenation performance in terms of selectivity, conversion, or stability. Therefore, I do not have the relevant details to populate the XML output.
