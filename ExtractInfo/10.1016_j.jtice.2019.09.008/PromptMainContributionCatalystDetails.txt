Abstract
A beautiful dandelion-like microspheric SUZ-4 zeolite was created by the addition of ethyl acetate and using industrial by-product silica fume (SF) as silica source. The morphology of the SUZ-4 zeolite can be transformed from traditional rod to dandelion-like by adjusting the ethyl acetate dose and the pre-crystallization time of the synthesis gel. The effect of the ethyl acetate on the peculiar morphology formation and the construction mechanism were proposed as follow: Under the influence of ethyl acetate, the template in the system does not work, and the nuclei formed during the pre-crystallization are more liable to assemble in “tip-to-tip” orientation to form spheres, instead of growing on the facet with low density to form dispersed rods without ethyl acetate. On the other hand, the microscopic analyses indicated that, the dandelion-like microspheres are formed by the aggregation of little SUZ-4 crystals, which are not dense, allowing access to their interiors. Hence, the dandelion-like SUZ-4 zeolite displayed much better adsorption ability for methylene blue in water, compared with the rod-like one.
1. Introduction
Zeolites are crystalline materials with well-defined three-dimensional framework, which are composed of SiO4 and Al2O3 tetrahedral [1]. They play important roles in adsorption, ion exchange, catalysis and so on, due to their porous structures and uniform channels [2]. Last few decades, much effort was devoted to improve the efficiency of zeolite as adsorbent or catalyst, one of which is to reduce the size of zeolite particles to nano-scale [3], [4], [5], [6], owing to the shorter channels and larger external surface. However, there is clear evidence that crystal size reduction would generally lead to crystallinity loss [7], [8], framework defects [9], [10], tedious separation [11] and so on. It is reported that, large-sized particles self-assembled from nanocrystals in order can totally or partially overcome the problems mentioned above [12], [13], and at the same time, the oriented aggregation may achieve better performance in the application [14], because the hierarchical porosity (including intracrystalline and intercrystalline porosity) can be introduced to transport the guest molecule [15]. Among the synthesis strategies, soft templates, such as cationic surfactants [16], or hard templates, such as carbon particles [17], were indeed necessary. However, such processes always involve some complex operations and additional cost. Therefore, the exploration of simple and economical agent for ordered self-assembled zeolite synthesis is still a challenge for practical application.
SUZ-4 zeolite is known to possess pore system with 10-ring channels intersected by 8-ring channels [18]. Lately, a goodly number of researchers devoted their strength tothe SUZ-4 zeolite application, due to its considerable catalytic activity in many reactions, such as methanol to hydrocarbons [19], [20], propane dehydrogenation [21], methane-to-methanol conversion [20] and so on. To the best of our knowledge, SUZ-4 zeolite has always been rod-like or fiber-like [3], [22], [23] since its discovery in 1992, because of its growth habit and the harsh synthesis conditions. It is reported that, SUZ-4 zeolite's maximum ring, i.e. 10-ring channel is along the length of rod or fiber [19]. Hence, we have reason to believe that reducing the SUZ-4 crystal length to nano-size is necessary for its activity improvement in application. Of cause, based on the discussion above, ordered aggregation of SUZ-4 nanocrystalline to some certain morphology with block-size is our goal.
On the other hand, silica fume (SF), as a kind of industrial solid waste, is produced from the smelting process of metallic silicon or ferrosilicon in the alloys industry [24]. The material is normally used as additives in cement, refractory, as well as filler in plastics and paints [25]. More recently, potential utilization of SF evolved to the synthesis of zeolite as silica source [26], [27], [28], due to its high content of SiO2 (85–99%) and non-crystalline properties. The evolution not only expanded the SF applications, but also reduced the cost of zeolite synthesis.
In this paper, using the SF as silica source, we attempt to set up an economical and facile method to obtain a self-assembled spherical SUZ-4 zeolite by the addition of ethyl acetate, and the effect of the ethyl acetate on the zeolite formation is going to be discussed in detail.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
The reagents used for the preparation of SUZ-4 zeolite were aluminum foil (99.9 wt.%, Tianjin Tianchen Chemical reagent factory), potassium hydroxide (KOH, 85 wt.%, Sinopharm), tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide (TEAOH, Shanghai Bangcheng Chemical Co., Ltd.), ethyl acetate (CH3COOC2H5, Tianjin Beichen Fine Chemical Co., Ltd.), and silica fume (SF, 96.7 wt.% SiO2, Gongyi Hengnuo Filter Material Co., Ltd.) as silica source. All reagents, including SF were used without further purification. On the other hand, methylene blue (MB, Tianjin Beichen Fine Chemical Co., Ltd.) was chosen for investigating the adsorption ability of SUZ-4 zeolite.
2.2. Preparation of SUZ-4 zeolite
In a typical synthesis procedure, 0.20 g Al foil was completely dissolved in the solution of 1.92 g KOH and 10 g deionized water, then the suspension composed of 5.7 g tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide, 4.6 g silica fume, and 19 g deionized water was added dropwise under vigorously stir to form the gel with formulation of 7.9KOH:1.0Al2O3:2.6TEAOH:21.2SiO2:498.6H2O thus obtained, which is the same molar ratio with the conventional SUZ-4 zeolite synthesis in the literature [3]. The gel was heated at 150 °C for a certain time under rotation of 20 rpm. The hydrothermal procedure above is named as pre-crystallization, and after that different amount of ethyl acetate was added to the system. Afterwards, under 20 rpm rotation, the system was again heated at 150 °C for 96 h counting in the pre-crystallization time. Then, the solid was filtered, washed, dried, and calcinated at 550 °C for 5 h. For discussing conveniently, the samples thus obtained was denoted as Sa-t, in which a represents the amount of ethyl acetate added to the system and t represents the pre-crystallization time. Exceptionally, the non-calcinated samples were also needed in some characterization analysis and noted as Sa-t-n.
2.3. Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) data of samples were collected by using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Ultima IV, Japan), whose diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation from 5° to 55° and the scanning speed was 20 °/min. Elemental analysis was determined by an ICP Varian 715-ES ICP optical emission spectrometer after dissolution of the solids in a HNO3/HF solution. The sample morphology was examined using a JSM-IT200 scanning electron microscopy (SEM) system with an acceleration voltage of 10 kV and a JEM-2010 high resolution transmission electron microcopy (TEM) system. Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra of the samples were obtained by means of a FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet IS10, Thermo Scientific American) using KBr pellet technique, whose spectra were collected in the range 450∼4000 cm−1. The thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a STA449 F3 (NETZSCH, Germany). The sample was heated from room temperature up to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under flowing air, with a flow rate of 10 mL min−1. Nitrogen gas adsorption-desorption experiments were performed at 77 K using an automatic surface area and porosimetry system (ASAP2020, Micromeritics, America) and the specific surface area was calculated by the Brunauer Emmet–Teller method (BET). Solid-state 27Al MAS NMR spectra of the samples were collected on Varian infinity-plus 400 MHz spectrometer, at resonance frequency of 104 MHz, with spinning rate of 8 kHz, and recycle delay of 2 s.
For each synthesized sample x, the relative crystallinity of SUZ-4 zeolite was calculated based on the formula below using a well crystalline sample S0-12 as reference, in which the diffraction peak at 2θ = 7.8° was referred:
2.4. Adsorption experiments
Typically, 0.5 g of dry SUZ-4 zeolite materials were placed in a series of 100 mL flasks containing 50 mL of methylene blue(MB) solution with the concentration of 200–400 mg/L and the pH of 6.42, and then the mixture was shaken with speed of 200 shakes per min in a shaker at 298 K for 120 min. After that, the MB-adsorbed solid adsorbent was separated from the solution by centrifugation, and the concentration of MB was determined using UV–VIS spectrophotometer (METASH UV-5500 PC) by evaluating the absorbance at a wavelength of 660 nm.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology evolution
3.1.1. Effect of ethyl acetate dose
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of samples obtained by adding the different amount of ethyl acetate (from 0 to 2 mL) to the synthesis gel pre-crystallized for 12 h. The results indicated that, using SF as silica source, SUZ-4 zeolite could be obtained when the addition dose of ethyl acetate was less than or equal to 1 mL (such as sample S0-12 and S1-12), and the phase transformed to be amorphous when the dose increased to 2 mL (S2-12). As shown in Fig. 1, the samples S0-12 and S1-12 exhibited a series of peaks at 7.8°, 11.79°, 15.5°, 18.68°, 19.38°, 22.18°, 22.51°, 23.35°, 25.03°, 25.56°, 28.45° and so on, confirming the pure material. It means that, the formation of SUZ-4 phase strongly depends on the addition dose of ethyl acetate. This result is totally different from that reported by Zhou et al. [28], in which the objective MCM-41 zeolite can be obtained even when the amount of ethyl acetate increased to 35 mL.

An interesting phenomenon can be seen from the SEM images shown in Fig. 2, in which the scattered rod-like sample (S0-12 shown in Fig. 2a and a') was obtained without ethyl acetate addition, while the morphology turned to be dandelion-like when the dose increased to 1 mL (S1-12 shown in Fig. 2b and b'). The former is similar to that reported in the literatures [29], [30], whereas the latter never appeared in the SUZ-4 zeolite synthesis field. Detailly, these beautiful dandelion microspheres with average diameter of 10–15 µm were stacked together, and they were fabricated by the large numbers of nano-needles that oriented assembled together with “tip-to-tip”. Ulteriorly, TEM analysis of S1-12 (Fig. 2c and c') showed that these microspheres were not dense, existing interparticle voids among the little crystals.

3.1.2. Effect of the pre-crystallization time
For the same total crystallization time (96 h), the influence of pre-crystallization time of the gel on the SUZ-4 zeolite synthesis was investigated when the ethyl acetate dose was fixed to 1 mL. As shown in Fig. 3, when the pre-crystallization time was 0 h (sample S1-0), amorphous material was still acquired even after the crystallization for 96 h, as the pre-crystallization time was prolonged to 6 h (sample S1-6), a few SUZ-4 crystals could be found, and with the period extension, no more amorphous material could be seen from samples, and the morphology evolved to be dandelion-like for S1-12, chrysanthemum-like for S1-24 and pompon-like for S1-48. The SEM consequence is totally in accordance with XRD characterization (as shown in Fig. 4), in which with the extension of the pre-crystallization time, relative crystallinity of the samples was varied from 0% (S1-0) to 48% (S1-6), then to 100% (S1-12, S1-24 and S1-48).

Based on the above, it can be concluded that the addition dose of ethyl acetate and the pre-crystallization time not only compromise the phase of system, but also affect the morphology of the zeolite.
3.2. Physicochemical and textural properties
The physicochemical and textural properties of S1-12 as well as the reference sample S0-12 were further characterized by inductively coupled plasma (ICP), 27Al MAS NMR and N2 adsorption. The ICP analysis in Table 1 showed Si/Al molar ratios of 6.6 and 7.5 for S0-12 and S1-12, respectively. The 27Al MAS NMR spectra in Fig. 5A showed that there were only tetrahedrally coordinated framework aluminum species in the two samples (corresponding to the signal at 47 ppm), which indicated all aluminum species are incorporated into the SUZ-4 zeolitic framework [31]. The results above illustrated that the addition of ethyl acetate does not affect the crystallization efficiency of aluminum during crystallization. Fig. 5B presented the N2 sorption isotherms of these samples. The S0-12 with large scattered crystals performed almost no adsorption hysteresis loop, illustrating the perfect microporous structure in this sample. Notably, for the S1-12, an obvious hysteresis loop was observed in its isotherms at high relative pressure (P/P0 > 0.8), which was caused by the meso‑ and macro-porosities in the zeolite. Moreover, as shown in Table 1, compared with S0-12, S1-12 had the same Vmicro but larger Vmeso and Vmacro that should be formed by the assembly of the adjacent nano-crystallites, which is completely in accordance with the TEM result above.

3.3. FTIR and TG study
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analyses of the non-calcinated samples (S0-12-n and S1-12-n) were carried out and shown in Fig. 6A. For the two samples, they showed the same bands at 1636 and 3437 cm−1, which are the characteristic bending and stretching vibrations of -OH groups of adsorbed water [32], [33], [34]. Besides, it is worthy to note that, the bands at 1398, 1496, 2996 cm−1 between the two spectra were considerably different in their intensity. These bands can be attributed to the symmetric/asymmetric vibrations of the -CH2 and -CH3 groups deriving from the template (TEAOH) [35], [36]. Therefore, compared with the bands of S0-12-n, the ones of S1-12-n were so weak in intensity that almost no TEAOH could be considered to be contained in S1-12-n. In order to support the FT-IR result, TG characterizations of the two non-calcinated samples were conducted. As shown in Fig. 6B, the weight loss in the range of 440–540 °C could be attributed to the combustion of the template TEA+ existing in the zeolite channels [37], and the losses for S0-12-n and S1-12-n were 4.3% and 0.86%, respectively.

3.4. Formation mechanism
In literature, until now, there have been only two papers concerning the ethyl acetate used in the zeolite (MCM-41) synthesis [28], [38], in which the ethyl acetate was denoted as catalyst, but its specific role in the zeolite synthesis was not expatiated. Herein, the specific effect of ethyl acetate on the dandelion-like SUZ-4 zeolite formation was discussed as below.
As indicated by the FT-IR and TG results, we can conclude that, as the system was added by ethyl acetate, TEAOH did not act as template during the subsequent crystallization i.e. the presence of ethyl acetate can make TEAOH useless. Furthermore, as discussed above, in spite of the same total crystallization time, the longer pre-crystallization time the sample undergoes, the higher crystallinity or the larger crystals it has. It means that, the effect of the pre-crystallization is to produce SUZ-4 crystal nuclei and production should be stopped once ethyl acetate is added due to the ineffective template, and the subsequent crystallization of the system is completely depended on the crystal nuclei formed during the pre-crystallization. For instance, when the pre-crystallization time was 0 h, there were no nuclei formed in the system, and meanwhile the template was also invalid, and so amorphous sample was obtained even after the crystallization of 96 h. Another example, with the time prolonged from 12 to 48 h, the little crystals composing the microspheres became larger, due to the longer pre-crystallization time, and hence the morphology of the samples changed from dandelion-like for S1-12 to chrysanthemum-like for S1-24 and to pompon-like for S1-48.
It is well known that ethyl acetate hydrolyzes into acetic acid and ethanol under the alkaline condition [39]. Interestingly, we duplicated the synthesis procedure of S1-12, but the corresponding amount of acetic acid (0.5 mL) and ethanol (0.5 mL) mixture was added instead of ethyl acetate. No pure SUZ-4 zeolite could be obtained. To explore the reason, the temporal dependence of pH of the different systems was investigated. As shown in Fig. 7, taking the pH evolution of the system without ethyl acetate as reference, the pH decrements of the other systems were investigated. Compared with the pH reduction of the system with the mixture, the one of the system with ethyl acetate was relatively smaller, especially before 24 h. That is to say, compared with the mixture, ethyl acetate has much less influence on the pH change of the system, and hence the SUZ-4 zeolite is more liable to be formed under the little higher pH value. It may be because that, ethyl acetate hydrolysis would be tardiness if there is silicate polymerization in the system, and the pH decrement is therefore small [40]. On the other hand, for the system with 2 mL ethyl acetate, the pH value may be too low to obtain the SUZ-4 zeolite.

As discussed above, the effect of ethyl acetate on the dandelion-like SUZ-4 formation, i.e. the construction mechanism of the zeolite was summarized as follow. In the beginning, a certain number of nuclei are formed under the action of TEAOH during the pre-crystallization time. Later, when ethyl acetate is added, the acetic acid and ethanol is slowly released due its tardy hydrolysis. Then, the template TEAOH is invalid due to the acetic acid, and the crystal nuclei formed in the pre-crystallization are liable to aggregate together to form dandelions in “tip-to-tip” orientation under the function of ethanol. According to Alkimim et al. [41], in presence of ethanol, the polymerization of aluminosilicate in the system is slow and the morphology of crystal tends to form sphere in order to minimize the free energy of the surface. In opposite, for the system without ethyl acetate, nuclei grow along the direction with low framework density to form the dispersed rod-like crystals. The growth tracks of rod and dandelion-like SUZ-4 zeolite was concluded in Fig. 8.

3.5. Adsorption performance
The adsorptions of the synthesized dandelion-like SUZ-4 zeolite (S1-12) for methylene blue (MB) were evaluated in the adsorbate concentration varying in the range of 200–400 mg/L, and the traditional rod-like zeolite (S0-12) and the raw material SF were adopted as references. As shown in Fig. 9, for the 200 mg/L MB solution, the maximum removal attained was 97.17% on S1-12, 91.32% on S0-12 and 48.03% on SF. The data clearly showed that the dandelion-like zeolite has higher adsorption capacity for MB, compared with rod-like zeolite and raw material SF. Especially when the adsorbate concentration increased to 400 mg/L, the removal percentage decreased to 86.76% on S1-12, which is about twice as much as S0-12 (48.26%) and 8 times removal rate of SF. The better MB adsorptivity of S1-12 should be attributed to its larger Vmeso and external surface, which allow access to their interiors.

4. Conclusion
Herein, by manipulating the ethyl acetate dose and pre-crystallization time, a new dandelion-like microspheric SUZ-4 zeolite was constructed, and the specific effect of ethyl acetate on the zeolite formation was also obtained. It is found that tardy hydrolysis of ethyl acetate plays a key role in creating the dandelion-like zeolite. Acetic acid released during the process can make TEAOH ineffective due to the acid-base reaction, and ethanol can make the little crystals aggregating as microsphere to reduce the free energy of the surface. The systematic and thorough characterizations demonstrate that, compared with traditional rod-like SUZ-4 zeolite, the dandelion-like one has much more mesopores and larger external surface, which are responsible for its better MB adsorptivity.
