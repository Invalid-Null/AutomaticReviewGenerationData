The provided document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation to propylene. It examines the effects of potassium addition on chromia/alumina dehydrogenation catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, but does not focus on converting propane to propylene specifically. The document mainly characterizes the catalysts using various techniques rather than evaluating performance for propylene production. Since it does not pertain to PDH or ODH processes to produce propylene, I have indicated "No" for relevance and left the details blank.
