Effects of potassium addition on the acidity and reducibility of chromia/alumina dehydrogenation catalysts
Abstract
Dehydrogenation catalysts based on chromia supported on γ-alumina, containing about 6 wt.% of chromium and increasing amounts of potassium (up to 1.8 wt.%), were prepared and characterised by means of several techniques, such as N2 adsorption at 77 K, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), temperature programmed reduction (TPR), microcalorimetry and chemical analyses. The catalytic behaviour of the samples was investigated in the propane dehydrogenation reaction at 813 K and the effect of potassium loading was examined. The addition of increasing amounts of the alkali metal, as expected, determined a general decrease in the surface acidity. The sites strength distribution was greatly influenced, due to the fact that, at loadings above 0.5 wt.%, potassium preferentially caused the disappearance of weak and medium acid sites. EPR showed a decrease of CrIII species (especially α-Cr2O3) on potassium increasing. TPR profiles of the K-containing samples showed the presence of two reduction peaks, ascribable to two different kinds of CrVI surface species with a different reduction behaviour. All catalysts showed a maximum of activity as a function of time-on-stream, due to reduction of CrVI to CrIII species in the first reaction period, and then a decrease, due to deactivation by coking. Propene selectivity was high in all cases and was positively affected by the presence of potassium in concentrations up to 1 wt.%.
1. Introduction
The dehydrogenation reactions of short chain alkanes are currently investigated, because of the potential commercial interest in using alkane effectively. The reactant conversion to the corresponding olefin is limited by thermodynamic constraints: due to the strong endothermic character of the reaction, for C2–C6 paraffins, temperatures in the range from 800 to 1000 K are needed to reach equilibrium conversions around 50%. Consequently, side cracking reactions to lighter hydrocarbons and coke are favoured, thus decreasing selectivity to the desired product. The cost of the feedstock encourages operations to achieve the highest possible selectivity to alkenes and to limit coking. Regenerating catalysts periodically to remove coke also requires a very thermally stable catalyst and the choice of a proper support is of particular importance. The high activity and selectivity of supported chromia catalysts for the dehydrogenation of C3–C4 alkanes have been known for many decades [1], [2], [3]. Widely employed industrial catalysts for this reaction are chromia supported on γ-alumina, a refractory high surface area material, which unfortunately presents the undesired feature of catalysing the side reactions of cracking and coking, leading to catalyst deactivation. In this respect, the possibility of using supports with different acid properties [4], [5], [6], [7], [8] and the addition of alkali or alkaline-earth metals to the catalyst formulation [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19] have also been investigated. In the case of chromia supported on γ-alumina, the promotion of activity and selectivity in the presence of alkali metals has been attributed to a decrease in surface acidity [13] or to an increase in the number of active sites and to a stabilising effect on the structure of the carrier against recrystallisation to the α-phase [12], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. On the other hand, an inhibition effect of potassium on activity has been observed in [19], depending both on the concentration of the alkali metal and the chromium, and in [4], where ZrO2 was used as a support.
It has been generally accepted that the catalytic properties of the chromia-based systems are due to surface CrIII species. Consequently, research interest has been focused on the molecular structures of these active species and on the factors which determine their concentration on the surface. For this purpose, different characterisation techniques have been used on both fresh and used catalysts, such as X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) [19], [21], [24], laser Raman spectroscopy [13], [20], [22], [23], [25], [26], [27], X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [19], [24], [28], [29], [30], electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) [24], [31], [32], [33], infrared spectroscopy [5], [20], [34] and temperature programmed reduction (TPR) [22], [26], [35], [36].
In the present work, the catalytic behaviour of chromia on γ-alumina samples, containing about 6 wt.% of chromium and increasing amounts of potassium (up to 1.8 wt.%), has been investigated in the propane dehydrogenation reaction at 813 K. The chemical and textural features of the catalysts have also been investigated by means of several techniques, such as N2 adsorption at 77 K, XRPD, UV-Vis DRS, EPR, TPR, microcalorimetry and chemical analyses, aiming to find correlations with the catalytic activity and to clarify the role of potassium in affecting conversion and selectivity.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The following catalysts were prepared: ACr nominally containing 6 wt.% of chromium on γ-alumina, ACrK0.5, ACrK1 and ACrK2 nominally containing also 0.5, 1 and 2 wt.% of potassium, respectively. γ-Alumina (grain size 100–500 μm, kindly provided by Süd Chemie MT, Novara, Italy) was obtained by calcination in air of pseudoboehmite Versal 250 La Roche at 1223 K for 4 h. The support was impregnated with comparable volumes of aqueous solutions of the appropriate amounts of CrO3 (and K2Cr2O7 for the ACrKx samples). The carefully stirred paste was dried overnight at 383 K and finally calcined at 973 K for 12 h. For comparison purpose, a sample of crystalline chromia was prepared as in [6]. All chemicals were Carlo Erba reagent grade. Textural properties and chemical composition of the obtained samples have been summarised in Table 1.

2.2. Catalyst characterisation
Chemical analyses of the total Cr (column 4 in Table 1) was carried out by atomic absorption (AA, Varian SpecrAA-30) on samples previously dissolved by fusion with a mixture of KNO3 and Na2CO3 (1:1 (w/w)). On a different portion of the catalyst, the CrVI content (column 5 in Table 1) was determined by AA after several extractions with 10 M NaOH solution heated to incipient boiling. The same sample with the residual CrIII (column 6 in Table 1) was then dissolved by fusion with the mixture of KNO3 and Na2CO3 and analysed by AA. The correspondence of the total amount of Cr and the sum of the amounts of CrVI and CrIII (column 7 in Table 1) has been then checked with satisfactory results.
Phase analysis was performed by XRPD using a Philips PW 1729 diffractometer equipped with a PC for data acquisition and analysis (software APD-Philips). Scans were taken with a 2θ step of 0.01°, using Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation. Particle sizes were evaluated by means of the Scherrer equation: D=Kλ/(β cos θ) after Warren’s correction for instrumental broadening, where D is the mean crystallite diameter of the particles supposed spherical, K a constant equal to 0.9, λ the wavelength of the X-ray used, and β the effective line width of the X-ray reflection under observation.
Diffuse reflectance spectra were taken in the wavelength range 200–800 nm (50,000–12,500 cm−1) with a Varian CARY 5E spectrometer equipped with a PC for data acquisition and analysis and using PTFE as a reference.
EPR spectra were recorded on a Varian E-9 spectrometer at X-band. Measurements at 363 K were carried out utilising the Bruker variable temperature control unit B-ST 100/700. The spectrometer was equipped with an online computer for data treatment, which consisted of smoothing, baseline drift correction and integration of spectra.
Tian-Calvet heat flow equipment (Setaram) was used for microcalorimetric measurements. Each sample was pretreated overnight at 673 K under vacuum (10−3 Pa) before the successive introduction of the probe gas (ammonia). The equilibrium pressure relative to each adsorbed amount was measured by means of a differential pressure gauge (Datametrics). The run was stopped at a final equilibrium pressure of 133.3 Pa. The adsorption temperature was maintained at 353 K, in order to limit physisorption.
TPR profiles were obtained on a TPD/R/O 1100 apparatus (ThermoQuest), under the following conditions: sample weight, 40–45 mg; heating rate (from 313 to 1173 K), 20 K/min; flow rate, 30 cm3/min; 5 vol.% H2/N2; the hydrogen consumption was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Textural analyses were carried out on a Sorptomatic 1990 system (Fisons Instruments), by determining the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K. Before analysis, the samples were heated overnight under vacuum up to 473 K (heating rate=1 K/min).
2.3. Catalytic runs
Experimental runs lasting 2 h were performed in a fixed-bed quartz–glass microreactor at P=1.013×105 Pa and T=813 K, catalyst weight
 g. Blank runs, performed in the empty reactor, allowed to rule out the contribution of thermal reactions.
Prior to the catalytic test, samples were activated in situ at 773 K for 12 h, under nitrogen flow (15 cm3/min). The reaction mixture contained 12 vol.% C3H8 (pC3H8=0.234×105 Pa) diluted in He (total flow rate=53 cm3/min). Online GC analysis was carried out with an HP 6890, equipped with a capillary column HP PORAPLOT Q and a TCD. Propane (C3) conversion and selectivity to products have been calculated as follows:
where i=propene, ethylene, ethane, methane and CO2; and Ni and NC3 are number of carbon atoms in the product and propane, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterisation
Textural analyses (Table 1) have shown that in all cases the surface area decreases with respect to that of the support. However, it seems that the SBET value is mainly affected by chromium addition, the presence of potassium having only a minor effect. A slight catalysts surface area diminution with respect to the pure support, in the presence of chromium loadings above 5 wt.%, has already been reported [19], [21], [22], [37].
It has been reported in the literature [5], [8], [19], [20], [21], [22], [26], [27], [28], [31], [32], [33], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41] that chromium can exist on the catalyst in different oxidation states, depending on the metal loading, calcination temperature, nature of the carrier, hydration degree of the surface and type of chromium precursor. When alumina is used as a support, the surface chromium species are: (i) highly dispersed CrVI species, stabilised in a high oxidation state by interaction with the carrier and predominant at low metal content (below the monolayer coverage). They are mainly CrVI species (containing a fraction of about 10% CrV) in the form of isolated chromates, but di-, tri- or more polymerised chromates can also be present; (ii) isolated CrIII species, which could in part diffuse within the framework of alumina, because of the comparable size and same charge of the CrIII and AlIII ions; (iii) CrIII species organised in small clusters, present in the case of medium and high metal loadings; and (iv) α-chromia, formed at the highest chromium contents.
Chemical analyses of the investigated samples (Table 1) showed the presence of CrIII and CrVI species and allowed to quantitatively determine their amounts. It can be noted from the table that the concentration of CrVI species generally increases when increasing potassium loading. According to [19], this can be explained by the formation, in the presence of the alkali metal, of CrVI containing compounds (K2CrO4 or K2Cr2O7 species) at the expense of the CrIII oxide.
X-ray diffraction shows the presence of the γ-alumina phase and also of the α-Cr2O3 phase for all the samples (Fig. 1), in accordance with the literature for chromium loadings higher than 5 wt.% [19], [20], [21], [22], [37]. The particle size of α-Cr2O3 phase was found to be in the range 340 to >1000 Å.

The EPR spectra at 293 K of the ACr and ACrKx samples were dominated by a broad signal of Lorentian shape centred at g=1.98 (ΔHPP≃900 G), that obeys the Curie law and is attributable to the CrIII in clusters of small dimensions. The integrated intensities of this signal, I, are reported in Table 2 (column 1). Moreover, two very small signals of isolated CrIII and CrV species at g≃4.2 and 1.97, respectively, were observed. In order to detect a signal for the crystalline α-chromia (antiferromagnetic below its Néel temperature of 308 K), spectra were recorded also at 363 K. The difference between the integrated intensities of the signals at 363 K (column 4 in Table 2) and 293 K (this latter corrected by the factor 0.81=293/363 for the Curie law; column 3 in Table 2) gives an estimate of the integrated intensity of the signal of crystalline α-chromia present on the sample (column 5 in Table 2).

The main result is that both CrIII in small clusters (column 2 in Table 2) and CrIII in crystalline α-chromia (column 5 in Table 2) tend to decrease while increasing potassium loading. This result supports the suggestion that the introduction of potassium in the samples stabilises CrVI as surface chromates at the expense of the CrIII. It is noteworthy that the percentage decrease is higher for α-chromia, that is more than halved passing from ACr to ACrK2.
Diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectroscopy of the investigated catalysts evidences four adsorption bands (Fig. 2): two charge transfer transitions O→Cr typical of CrVI at λ≃278 and 370 nm and two bands due to d–d transitions of CrIII in octahedral symmetry at λ≃463 nm (A2g→T1g) and 600 nm (A2g→T2g).

Microcalorimetry is a convenient method to investigate the surface acid–base properties of a catalyst by means of suitable probe molecules which adsorb on the solid. Different basic molecules can be used to characterise surface acidity; in the present case NH3 was employed. The calorimetric results for the investigated samples, including γ-alumina, are summarised in Fig. 3, where the differential heats, Qdiff, of NH3 adsorption are plotted versus the uptake. The impregnation of chromium on the carrier leads to an increase in the surface acidity: the ACr sample shows an initial Qdiff value of about 265 kJ/mol, higher than that of alumina (244 kJ/mol), and the curve exhibits a plateau, corresponding to homogeneous sites forming a family of constant Qdiff (≃170 kJ/mol); a continuous decrease is then observed, ascribed to the heterogeneity of the adsorption sites. With regard to the other catalysts, a continuous decrease is observed at any coverage. As expected, the addition of increasing amounts of potassium results in a decreased acidity, as indicated by the change in the initial value of Qdiff (from 265 to 151 kJ/mol, when passing from ACr to ACrK2) and by the shape of the curves: for the K-containing samples, the increase in the ammonia uptake is accompanied by a continuous decrease in the differential heat to low values (<50 kJ/mol), which becomes more pronounced when increasing potassium loading.

According to the differential heat of adsorption, the conventional acid strength distribution, shown in Table 3, has been considered. It has been reported in [42] that non-specific adsorption through hydrogen bonding of ammonia on Al2O3/SiO2 is responsible for Qdiff values of about 70 kJ/mol. Consequently, NH3 uptakes originating differential heats <70 kJ/mol were neglected in calculating the concentration of acid sites for all the samples. It can be observed from the table that the number of strong acid sites is almost quadrupled when chromium is added to the carrier, while medium acidity is practically unaffected and the number of weak acid sites is only 1.5 times higher if compared to γ-alumina. The addition of the lowest amount of potassium (0.5 wt.%) to the ACr catalyst gives rise to a marked decrease in acidity, which involves any kind of sites. However, at higher loadings, the alkali metal preferentially causes the disappearance of medium and weak acid sites. It is noteworthy that the less acidic sample, ACrK2, shows the highest value of the s/t ratio (=0.5), indicating that, although the number of total acid sites is sensibly lower than on the other catalysts, the 50% of them are strong.

TPR with hydrogen is a useful technique for characterising the reduction behaviour of the surface species on a catalyst. The ease of reduction is conveniently measured by the temperature of maximum hydrogen consumption (Tmax), which increases as the ease of reduction decreases. Besides the experimental conditions, factors concerned with the sample itself affect the value of Tmax, such as the nature of the surface species, their concentration and their accessibility. TPR profiles of the samples are reported in Fig. 4. It has been assumed that H2 is consumed only in the reduction of CrVI to CrIII species; the presence of chromium in a lower oxidation state was ruled out on the basis of already reported results about chromia supported on alumina samples [5], [21], [28], [40]. The ACr sample shows a single reduction peak, indicating the presence of a single family of CrVI species. Instead, the K-containing catalysts exhibit a second peak at higher temperatures, pointing out to a less reducible kind of CrVI species. TPR curves reported in previous papers for non-promoted chromia/alumina catalysts [22], [26], [35], [36] also showed a single reduction peak. The second peak in the TPR profile of the ACrKx catalysts, the intensity of which seems to increase when increasing potassium amount, can be reasonably attributed to the formation of potassium chromate or dichromate phases, which possess a higher stability (pure KCrO4 and K2Cr2O7 showed reduction peaks in the temperature range 873–973 K) compared to that of other CrVI species only interacting with the support. It is noteworthy (Table 4) that the presence of potassium affects also the reducibility of this latter kind of CrVI species: the temperatures of the maximum hydrogen consumption, T1, tend to shift towards higher values, especially in the case of the sample with the highest potassium concentration, for which a broadening of the reduction peaks can also be evidenced. As regards the extent of CrVI reduction, column 4 in Table 4 reports the H/CrVI values calculated by the consumption of hydrogen and the CrVI content (column 5 in Table 1). It appears that the H/CrVI ratio decreases when increasing the potassium loading, especially when passing from ACrK1 to ACrK2. It is possible that, at high potassium loadings, a partial coverage of the surface by the K2O phase results in a decreased accessibility of the reducible sites.

3.2. Catalytic results
Besides the desired product (propene), methane (≤2 mol%), ethylene (≤1.5 mol%), ethane (≤0.5 mol%) and, in the first minutes of reaction, CO2 (≤0.5 mol%) were also detected as by-products. The original green colour of the fresh catalysts changed to a deep black after propane dehydrogenation, pointing out to coke formation. To investigate the coke composition, the ACr and ACrK2 used samples (time-on-stream=2 h) were treated by refluxing (up to 6 h) with CH2Cl2 in a Soxhlet apparatus. GC analyses of the extracting solutions showed no traces of other species than the organic solvent. The carbon and hydrogen contents were also measured on the same catalysts by total burning at 1293 K, under helium and oxygen, with a C/H/N analyser. No hydrogen was detected, while carbon content was 3.4 and 2.4 wt.%, for ACr and ACrK2 respectively. These results seem to indicate that the formed coke consists of insoluble, highly condensed polynuclear carbon compounds.
The catalytic activity of the samples (γ-alumina has also been reported for comparison) is shown in Fig. 5, Fig. 6 in terms of propane conversion and propene selectivity as a function of time-on-stream (t-o-s). By extrapolating the curves at zero time-on-stream, the initial values of conversion and propene selectivity have also been calculated. It is well known that, on the chromia/alumina systems, dehydrogenation sites are provided by CrIII species. Results obtained on γ-alumina, which exhibits a negligible catalytic activity (Fig. 5) confirm such hypothesis. On the other hand, it has been reported [40], [43], [44] that chromium species and alumina are both involved in the coking reaction, which is closely related to the formation of the olefinic product. Going into deeper details about the nature of the dehydrogenating active species, it has been showed in previous investigations [14], [16], [18], [19], [31] that the catalytic activity can be attributed to co-ordinatively unsaturated mononuclear CrIII surface species. It is likely that loss of water at high temperature, by condensation of surface OH− groups, is responsible for the formation of the above-mentioned unsaturated active sites.

It can be noted from Fig. 5, that all the catalysts show an initial increase in conversion up to a maximum and then a decrease, due to deactivation by coking.
The initial activity increase has been attributed [8], [23], [24], [40] to the reduction of the CrVI by the reactant, with the consequent formation of H2O and CO2. Additional active sites are then originated on the surface by water desorption and their contribution is added to that of the co-ordinatively unsaturated CrIII already existing in the system. Since a certain lapse of time is required for a complete reduction of CrVI, an increasing amount of active sites is superimposed to that initially present on the surface. Thus, the increase in the activity observed in the first period of reaction can be easily understood. It is worthwhile to point out that the position of the maximum of conversion shifts towards higher values of time-on-stream when increasing potassium loading, in agreement with the increased concentration of CrVI species and with their decreased reducibility in the catalysts with the highest K contents. Finally, it can be noted from Fig. 5, that deactivation rate is lower on the ACrK1 sample.
It can be seen from Fig. 7, that the maximum value of conversion increases with the CrVI/CrIII ratio. The augmentation in this parameter is due to the formation of increasing amounts of potassium chromates. As showed by the EPR results, these species are mainly formed at the expense of the crystalline α-chromia, which was found to be definitely less active than any other CrIII species [19]. As already mentioned, the reduction of the potassium chromates leads to the formation of additional active sites for the reaction (accompanied by a re-dispersion of the chromium on the surface [19], [29]) and then to an increase in conversion.

On the basis of what reported in the literature about chemisorption on chromia ([45] and reference therein), it can be suggested that propane adsorbs on chromia-based catalysts by a heterolytic dissociative adsorption on pairs of adjacent co-ordinatively unsaturated CrIII and O2− ions. The role of these surface Lewis acid–base centres in the activation of propane has also been evidenced by De Rossi et al. [4], [5]. Since CrIII sites provide the acidic part of the adsorption centres, a correlation between catalytic activity and surface acidity may exist. To confirm this hypothesis, the initial values of conversion of the investigated catalysts have been reported, in Fig. 8, as a function of the number of total acid sites. As expected, the initial activity tends to increase with the surface acidity, i.e. with the number of sites which can possibly adsorb propane. Such initial values have been chosen because the microcalorimetric measurements give a description of a “clean” surface, not yet modified as a consequence of the catalytic reaction. In the case of alkane dehydrogenations, the acidic properties of the catalytic surface are deeply modified because of reduction and coke formation; thus, reliable correlations with microcalorimetric data should be better investigated by considering the initial catalytic behaviour.

As for propene selectivity, it can be observed from Fig. 6, that it is positively affected by the presence of potassium in concentrations up to 1 wt.%. The curves show a slight increase in the first minutes on stream and then reach a plateau. This is not true for ACrK2, which presents a well defined minimum in the selectivity curve, in correspondence to the highest conversion value (see Fig. 5). The changes in selectivity during the first minutes on stream have been related with the transformation of the hydrocarbon into oxygenated products (mainly CO2 and H2O) and the suppression of strong acid sites by coke deposition [8], [40].
The initial value of propene selectivity seems to depend on the fraction of strong acid sites (s/t). It can be observed from Fig. 9, that when the number of strong acid sites increases with respect to the total ones, selectivity to propene decreases because of an increased contribution of the side cracking reaction, independently from the initial value of conversion.

4. Conclusions
The present results show that the addition of increasing amounts of potassium (up to 1.8 wt.%) to a Cr2O3/γ-Al2O3 dehydrogenation catalyst (containing about 6 wt.% of Cr) can deeply modify the surface chemistry and then the catalytic behaviour. In particular, the concentration of CrVI was found to increase with the content of potassium, which most probably led to the formation of surface K-chromates at the expense of CrIII (especially α-Cr2O3, on the evidence of EPR results). As a consequence, the ratio CrVI/CrIII also increased while adding increasing potassium amounts. The formation of a less reducible kind of CrVI species was confirmed by the TPR spectra, which revealed the presence of a second reduction peak at higher temperatures, for the K-containing samples. Besides affecting the reduction behaviour of the investigated samples, increasing amounts of potassium also determined a general decrease in the surface acidity. At loadings above 0.5 wt.%, potassium preferentially caused the disappearance of weak and medium acid sites and, as a consequence, the sites strength distribution was greatly influenced.
The reactivity studies during propane dehydrogenation suggested that the initial activity and selectivity strongly depend on the acidic properties of the catalysts. If the acidity is too low the initial activity is scarce; on the other hand, if the percentage of the strong acid sites is too high, the selectivity decreases. Concerning the maximum activity, it depends on the ratio CrVI/CrIII: the higher this ratio the higher the maximum propane conversion.
Both acidity and CrVI/CrIII ratio can be modulated by adding potassium. The performance of the catalytic system may be optimised by adjusting these parameters.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
