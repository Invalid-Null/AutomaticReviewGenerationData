1. Introduction
Investigation of supported metal catalysts mostly focuses on optimizing the composition, or geometry of the metal sites to improve the catalytic performance [[1], [2], [3]]. On the other hand, strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) has been also exploited to modify catalytic rates and selectivity. Tauster et al. found that high temperature reduction of group VIII NPs supported on oxides like TiO2, Nb2O5 and FeOx caused the CO and H2 chemisorption to be strongly suppressed; while NPs reduced at low temperature displayed normal chemisorption behaviour [[4], [5], [6], [7]]. It is generally thought that these SMSI oxides are partially reduced at high temperature where the sub-stoichiometric oxides migrate and encapsulate metal NPs blocking the catalytic surface, as demonstrated via HRTEM imaging of Rh/TiO2 [8]. The SMSI overlayers can also change the surface geometric and electronic properties of the group VIII NPs leading to modified catalytic properties [9]. For example, Matsubu et al. found that the formation of a permeable HCOx overlayer resulted in catalysts with higher CO selectivity for CO2 reduction [10]. Worz et al. showed that partially reduced SMSI TiO2 on Au NPs increases the activity for CO oxidation [11]. It was proposed that Au binds to oxygen vacancy sites in the SMSI support leading to an electron transfer from the support to Au. Kang et al. found that Pd NPs supported on TiO2 were electron rich, compared to non-SMSI Pd, leading to weaker adsorption of acetylene, resulting in higher selectivity for the selective hydrogenation to ethylene [12]. Liu et al. showed that Pt/FeOx exhibited higher catalytic activity for low temperature CO oxidation due to formation of dual reaction sites, i.e., Pt sites for CO and FeOx sites for O2 [6].
CeO2 is also known to exhibit SMSI, however, generally under more extreme temperatures than, for example, TiO2 [13,14]. In this study, we prepared Pt/CeO2 catalysts, which have previously been shown to disperse as single atoms on the surface of the CeO2 by air oxidation at temperatures higher than about 800 °C [15,16]. Pt/CeO2 catalysts in this study were reduced at 550 °C and 975 °C and showed SMSI characteristics at the higher reduction temperature. Structural characterization by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirm the formation of monometallic Pt NPs at both reduction temperatures. After reduction at 550 °C, the TOR for ethylene hydrogenation and propane dehydrogenation was similar to that of Pt/SiO2, a non-SMSI support. After reduction at 975 °C, however, the rate per mol of Pt for ethylene hydrogenation is significantly lower. STEM shows a CeOx surface coverage on the Pt NPs, i.e., an SMSI state. After reduction at 975 °C, however, Pt/CeO2 showed much higher olefin selectivity for propane dehydrogenation (at 550 °C). The higher olefin selectivity is suggested to result from a decrease in the size of exposed Pt ensemble sites responsible for hydrogenolysis, from the partially covered SMSI Pt/CeO2; while the remaining exposed sites are active for dehydrogenation.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The procedure for 1% Pt/CeO2 synthesis followed previous procedure by Lu et al. [17]. 1 wt% Pt on CeO2 was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of a tetraammineplatinum (II) platinum nitrate (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.995 %) solution onto a commercial ceria support (Solvay, HS5). The fresh catalysts has a surface area of 90 m2/g for with a pore volume of ceria (0.6 mL/g) was determined by wetting the dry ceria powder with water. The solution was impregnated 6 times with 3 h of drying at 110 °C between each impregnation. The catalyst was then calcined in flowing air at 800 °C for 10 h to atomically disperse Pt in the CeO2 support. The surface area was 45 m2/g after 800 °C in air.
The monometallic Pt catalyst with 2 wt% Pt loading was prepared by a pH adjusted incipient wetness impregnation method (IWI) on SiO2. Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 was dissolved in 2 mL deionized water and ammonium hydroxide solution was added to adjust the pH to 11. The solution was added dropwise to Davisil Grade 636 silica (pore size =60 Å, surface area = 480 m2/g). This catalyst was then dried overnight at 125 °C and calcined at 225 °C for 3 h to keep the particle size small. Finally, all the catalysts were pre-reduced in 5% H2/N2 (100 mL/min) at 200 °C for 30 min to initially form reduced NP’s. These were further pre-reduced for 30 min at 550 or 975 °C.
2.2. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)
In situ XAS experiments were completed at the Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory at the 10-ID beamline. Experiments were performed in florescence mode at the Pt L3 (11.564 keV) edge. To perform experiments, the catalysts were crushed into a powder and pressed into a stainless-steel sample holder with the catalyst wafer oriented 45 degrees relative to the x-ray beam. The cell used for fluorescence measurement consists of a water-cooled stage fitted with Kapton windows for fluorescence measurement. For treatments, the cell is equipped with water cooling and ceramic heaters for temperature control and valves for gas flow. 3.5 % H2/He (Airgas) was used to treat the sample cell at 550 °C for 30 min. He (Airgas) was flowed between each temperature exposure to cool the cell to room temperature. The cell was then sealed and moved to the beamline to perform the in situ XAS experiment. To reduce potential O2 exposure, a He tank was connected to the gas purifier.
Each experiment required a concurrent measurement of a Pt foil scan acquired from a third ion chamber for internal energy calibration. Demeter 0.9.25 was the software package used to fit the XAS data. The XANES spectra was used to determine the edge energy using the maximum of the first peak in the first derivative of the spectra. To obtain EXAFS coordination parameters, least-squares fit in R-space of the k2 -weighted Fourier transform data from 3.0 Å−1 to 12.0 Å−1 was utilized. 0.80 was determined to be the amplitude reduction factor (S02) by fitting a reference spectrum of Pt foil and using it to fit all other EXAFS spectra. One Pt-Pt path and three free parameters were used for the initial fitting for Pt/CeO2.
2.3. Propane dehydrogenation catalytic performance tests
Catalytic performance was tested in a fixed bed reactor with a quartz reactor tube of 3/8-inch OD. The temperature of the reactor was controlled by a furnace connected to a controller. To measure catalyst temperature, a K-type thermocouple (O.D. = 3.2 mm) was positioned in the middle of the catalyst bed. 10 mg–200 mg of catalyst was diluted with enough silica to total 1.0 g and loaded into the reactor. The pre-reduced catalyst was re-reduced at 550 °C or 975 °C with 100 ccm 5% H2/N2 for 30 min. Propane dehydrogenation was performed with 2.5 % C3H8 and 2.5 % H2, balanced with N2 at 550 °C. Since the catalysts deactivate, the selectivity and conversion were obtained with fresh catalyst by measuring the performance after about 2 min on stream and every few minutes for 30−60 min. The selectivity and conversion were extrapolated back to zero time, i.e., zero coke on catalyst. A fresh sample of catalyst was measured at each space velocity, and the reproducibility of selectivity is about 3% and rate about 10 %. A Hewlett Packard 6890 Series gas chromatograph using a flame ionization detector (FID) with a Restek Rt-Alumina Bond/Na2SO4 GC column (30 m in length, 0.32 mm ID, and 0.5 μm film thickness was used to analyze the products.
2.4. Ethylene hydrogenation catalytic performance tests
Ethylene hydrogenation experiments were carried out in a U-tube quartz reactor (3/8 inch OD). The reactor was loaded with quartz wool before adding the catalyst, amount based on space velocity. The space velocity was adjusted to ensure conversions < 5 %. The thermocouple well inside the reactor was used to monitor the temperature of the catalyst bed. In a typical experiment, 3 torr ethylene (1 % C2H4 in 5 % Argon, balance Helium, Matheson Gas Company), 15 torr hydrogen (5 % H2, balance N2, Indiana Oxygen Company) and balance UHP (ultra-high purity) nitrogen (Indiana Oxygen Company). The effluent stream was analysed with a Gas Chromatography unit equipped with a Flame Ionization Detector using a GS-Alumina (Agilent J&W) capillary column.
2.5. Scanning transmission Electron microscopy (STEM)
Catalyst was mounted on holey carbon grids for imaging with an FEI Titan transmission electron microscope operated at 300 kV with image aberration correction for TEM images, or a JEOL NEOARM microscope operated at 300 kV with probe aberration correction for STEM images. Samples were mounted on the grids by a dry loading technique in order to eliminate the possibility of carbon contamination to ensure a fair comparison between as prepared, reduced catalyst.
3. Results
3.1. STEM/TEM
Fig. 1 shows a high magnification image of a 1 wt.% Pt-CeO2 sample that has been calcined at 800 °C, and subsequently reduced at 975 °C or 550 °C in H2, Fig. 1A, B and C, respectively. Similar to previous reports [15,16,18,19] calcination of Pt on CeO2 at temperatures above 800 °C leads to isolated Pt atoms, which are shown as bright spots marked by the arrows. After reduction at 975 °C, the Pt NPs are approximately 15 nm. These also show a thin coating of CeOx on the NP surface, i.e., the faint region highlighted by the white arrow in 1B. This thin film is present across the entire surface of the ceria and is visible as a disruption to the ceria lattice planes at the edges of ceria particles. Previously, HR-TEM has shown that after high temperature reduction Pt3Ce [20] and CePt5 [21] intermetallic alloys are formed. For this catalyst, all particles index to metallic Pt, see the Fourier Transform the Pt NP (inset in Fig. 1B).

The 1 wt.% Pt-CeO2 sample was also reduced at 550 °C, Fig. 1C and the average size of the Pt NPs is about 5 nm, which is slightly larger than the benchmark 2−3 nm 2 Pt/SiO2 catalyst (Fig. S1). In agreement with previous results by Bernal et al. [21], unlike the case of titania [22], 550 °C reduction does not exhibit well defined amorphous coatings, as shown in Fig. 1B. These Pt particles are too small for direct detection of surface features due to the very low contrast in bright field TEM.
3.2. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)
The Pt L3 edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra for the single atom 1 Pt/CeO2 oxidized at 800°C has previously been reported [18,19]. Similar results have been found in this study shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. These have a XANES energy and high white line intensity typical of Pt2+ ions with a first shell Pt-O coordination of 5 at 2.05 Å, with a small second shell scattering peak characteristic of isolated atoms. The Pt L3 XANES for Pt/CeO2 reduced at 550°C and 975 °C are shown in Fig. 2(B). After 550 °C and 975 °C reduction, 1 Pt/CeO2 had an edge energy of 11564.0 eV, which is identical to Pt foil and consistent with monometallic 2−3 nm Pt/SiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. S2(A)).

For 1 Pt/CeO2 reduced at 550 °C and 975 °C, the Pt L3 magnitude of the Fourier transform of the k2-weighted EXAFS shows three main peaks between 2−3 Å in Fig. 2(B), which is typical of the Pt-Pt scattering in metallic Pt NPs (Fig. S2(B)). The magnitude of the peaks was smaller when 1 Pt/CeO2 was reduced at 550 °C indicating a smaller particle size. The fit of the EXAFS for Pt/CeO2 reduced at 975 °C, gave a Pt-Pt had a coordination of 10.8 and bond distance similar to that of Pt foil (Table 1), consistent with the TEM particle size (>10 nm). The fit of the EXAFS for Pt/CeO2 reduced at 550 °C gave a Pt-Pt coordination number of 8.5 with bond distance of 2.74 Å, slightly shorter than Pt foil, and consistent with about 5 nm NPs consistent with TEM. The EXAFS fit of Pt/SiO2 was 7.6 at 2.73 Å, consistent with slightly smaller NPs on Pt/CeO2 reduced at 550 °C.
3.3. Ethylene hydrogenation
Hydrogenation of ethylene is a structure sensitive reaction where every exposed Pt has the same TOR independent of the particle size or support type, thus can be used to determine the number of active surface Pt sites [[23], [24], [25]]. In this study, this reaction will be used to estimate the number of (metallic) catalytic Pt sites for the Pt/CeO2 catalysts under different treatment conditions, i.e., air at 800 °C, and 550, 900 or 975 °C reduction with H2.
As shown in Table 2, the fresh (air at 800°C) Pt/CeO2 catalysts shows low rates per g Pt for ethylene hydrogenation. Since the STEM shows that these are atomically dispersed, the turnover rate (TOR) was determined assuming each Pt is active. The TOR of 7 × 10−4 s-1 is much smaller than that reported for metallic Pt [24,26,27].

Following reduction in H2 at 550 °C, the rate/g Pt increased to 4.3 × 10−1 s−1, almost 3 orders of magnitude higher than atomically dispersed Pt2+ ions. Estimating the dispersion from the TEM particle size of 5 nm, i.e., 20 % dispersion, the TOR is 1.1 s−1. The TOR of a 2 wt.% Pt/SiO2 reduced at 550 °C with a dispersion of 0.44, determined by CO chemisorption, was 1.4 s-1 and similar to rates reported for other Pt catalysts [23,24,26,28]. Thus, Pt/CeO2 reduced at 550 °C has a TOR typical of other non-SMSI Pt catalysts.
At higher reduction temperatures (900 °C and 975 °C), however, the ethylene hydrogenation rate/g Pt decreases significantly. At 975 °C, for example, the Pt NPs are larger, ca. 15 nm, or an estimated dispersion of about 6–7 %. If the loss in rate were due to sintering alone, the rate/g would be about 3 times lower, e.g., 20/6.5, or the ratio of dispersions, than Pt/CeO2 reduced at 550°C. The rates per/g, however, are 40–50 times lower, which far exceeds that from sintering alone. The large decrease in rate is likely due to the blockage of surface Pt sites by the CeOx over layers as evidenced in Fig. 1B. The very low ethylene hydrogenation rates suggest that only a small fraction of the Pt surface is catalytic.
Previously, CeO2 has been shown to exhibit an SMSI effect at relatively moderate temperatures (>300 °C) and inhibit the activity of noble metal catalysts [[29], [30], [31]]. Cunningham et al. studied the effect of H2 pretreatment on a Rh/CeO2 catalyst at temperatures up to 380 °C and found complete loss of activity for acetone hydrogenation [32]. Liotta et al. observed similar results with reduced activity for NO reduction by C3H6 for Pt/ceria-zirconia catalysts reduced in H2 at elevated temperature. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and XPS were used to detect the SMSI state [33]. Other studies show high reduction temperatures are required for SMSI on Pt/CeO2. Reduction of Pt/CeO2 at 700 °C was highly selectivity for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation. The improved performance was due to preferential hydrogenation of the carbonyl group for Pt NPs existing in an SMSI state [34]. In our catalysts, we observe little effect of SMSI at 550 °C, but the Pt NPs have high surface CeO2 coverage after reduction above 900 °C, much higher than generally reported.
3.4. Propane dehydrogenation
These Pt/CeO2 catalysts, and for comparison Pt/SiO2, were also evaluated for propane dehydrogenation. Hydrogen was co-fed in order to increase the hydrogenolysis selectivity forming methane, ethane and ethylene, which is a more severe evaluation of the catalyst’s performance. Each data point was determined with fresh catalyst at different space velocity, i.e., sample weight or flow. To obtain the coke-free activity and selectivity, the conversion and selectivity was determined after about 2 min and every few minutes for about 30−60 min and extrapolated to zero time. As shown in Fig. 3 (pink), the propylene selectivity of 2 Pt/SiO2 was 75 % at 15 % conversion, and the selectivity decreases as the conversion increases, for example about 60 % at 30 % conversion. The TOR was 0.17 s−1 (Table 3), which is consistent with previous literature [35]. For 1 Pt/CeO2 reduced at 550 °C (Fig. 3 (black)), the selectivity was slightly higher, but similar to 2 Pt/SiO2 and the TOR was also similar. Thus, the catalytic performance of 1 Pt/CeO2 reduced at 550 °C is very similar to 2 Pt/SiO2. For 1 Pt/CeO2 reduced at 975 °C (Fig. 3 (blue)), however, the propylene selectivity was much higher, about 94 %, than for reduction at 550 °C. In addition, the olefin selectivity remained high with increasing conversion. The rate per g Pt (Table 3), however, was about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the catalyst reduced at 550 °C. The loss in activity is similar to that observed for ethylene hydrogenation. The TOR based on the STEM size also indicates a much lower rate, about 25 times lower than non-SMSI catalysts. However, the TOR based on the number is sites estimated from the ethylene hydrogenation rate is similar to non-SMSI Pt NPs.

4. Discussion
4.1. Structure of Pt/CeO2 catalysts
Similar to previous studies, Pt single atoms are dispersed on the CeO2 after 800 °C calcination [15,16,18,19]. These, however, have low catalytic activity compared to Pt NPs and are readily reduced to Pt NP’s at temperatures above about 300 °C. The in situ XAS and STEM structure determination of Pt/CeO2, reduced at 975 °C, indicate that monometallic Pt NPs are present with no evidence for formation of any intermetallic alloy, as previously reported [[35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40]]. At 550 °C, the Pt NPs are approximately 5 nm, with no evidence of a CeOx SMSI oxide layer. The catalytic TOR of ethylene hydrogenation is similar to Pt/SiO2 and the propane dehydrogenation TOR and selectivity are also similar, consistent with no change in the catalytic properties due to a support interaction. Reduction after 975 °C, however, led to the formation of an oxide over layer observed by STEM, Fig. 1B, and a significant loss in the TOR for ethylene hydrogenation consistent with a CeOx SMSI structure. The formation of the SMSI oxide, however, occurred at much higher temperature than reported for Pt/TiO2, for example, which occurs at about 500 °C [4,5]. This high reduction temperature to form a CeO2 SMSI state is consistent with a previous study by Deleitenburg et al. showing that CeO2 only exhibits SMSI behavior under extremely harsh conditions. At these high temperatures, the Pt NPs also sinter (ca. 15 nm) compared to the particles reduced at lower temperature (5 nm).
SMSI oxides are often suggested to increase number of electrons on the metal NPs by transfer of electron density from the partially reduced support. For example, it has been shown by XPS that the 4f7/2 peak is shifted from 71.0 eV (Pt) to 70.2 eV (Pt/TiO2) suggesting that TiO2 provided electrons to the Pt nanoparticles [41,42]. In this study, the XANES edge energy of Pt/CeO2 after reduction at 550 and 975 °C are very similar suggesting little change in the Pt.
4.2. The effect of SMSI on catalyst performance
The TOR of Pt NPs is independent of particle size and support for ethylene hydrogenation; thus, one can estimate the SMSI coverage of the Pt NPs from the apparent TOR for the Pt/CeO2 reduced at 975 °C. From the STEM images, the particle size of the latter is about 15 nm, which corresponds to ∼6% of dispersion [43]. However, the apparent TOR is much lower. Assuming that the loss in rate is due to surface coverage by SMSI CeO2, approximately 90 % of the catalytic sites are inaccessible for catalysis. Of the few remaining exposed sites, there is a significant increase in the olefin selectivity for propane dehydrogenation.
Alkane dehydrogenation, which is the reverse reaction of olefin hydrogenation is a structure insensitive reaction, thus, only requires individual atoms for catalytic activity. Hydrogenolysis, a structure sensitive reaction, requires several atom ensemble active sites [44]. Intermetallic alloys such as Pt3Mn, [45] Pt3Co, [40] Pt1Bi1 [39], Pt3Cr, [37] Pt3V [46] and Pt1Zn1 [36] have been shown to have isolated or three atom ensemble Pt sites and are highly olefin selective for alkane dehydrogenation. While in situ EXAFS and STEM suggested that Pt/CeO2 did not form an alloy even after 975 °C reduction, the high propylene selectivity suggests that the ensemble size of the catalyst was likely significantly reduced. Previous studies have shown that SMSI catalysts inhibits hydrogenolysis. Ethane hydrogenolysis has been suppressed on Pd/TiO2 in a study by Bracery et al.; while HDO of m-Cresol on NiMo/SiO2 catalyst also showed hydrogenolysis suppression [47,48]. Therefore, the higher propylene selectivity is likely that due to the high surface coverage of these large Pt NPs by CeOx resulting in few ensemble sites capable of hydrogenolysis.
5. Conclusion
In summary, single atom Pt sites on CeO2 have low catalytic rates for hydrogenation and are readily reduced to Pt NPs at temperatures above about 300 °C. Small to moderate sized NPs formed at temperatures below about 550 °C, display normal Pt catalytic properties for ethylene hydrogenation and propane dehydrogenation with no evidence of an SMSI CeOx by catalysis or STEM. Reduction at 975 °C leads to sintering of the Pt NPs to about 15 nm and coverage of greater than about 90 % of these larger particles by an SMSI CeOx. Both sintering and SMSI lead to a large loss in catalytic rate. The small number of exposed Pt sites on SMSI Pt/CeO2, however, led to highly selective propane dehydrogenation catalysts compared to Pt/SiO2, for example. The high olefin selectivity is likely due to smaller Pt ensembles, which suppress hydrogenolysis reactions, while the few remaining exposed Pt sites are active for dehydrogenation.

Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
