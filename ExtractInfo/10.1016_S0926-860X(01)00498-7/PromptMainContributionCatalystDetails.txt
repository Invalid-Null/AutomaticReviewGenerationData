Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over V2O5/TiO2/SiO2 catalysts obtained by grafting titanium and vanadium alkoxides on silica
Abstract
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on V2O5/TiO2/SiO2 catalysts, prepared by grafting, was investigated in the temperature range 673–773 K. The prepared samples were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), UV–VIS diffuse reflectance (DR UV–VIS), temperature programmed reduction (TPR) and O2 chemisorption. Crystalline V2O5 was not revealed on any sample, although the dispersion of the surface species steeply decreased with increasing vanadium loading. Non-isolated tetrahedral V5+ were present on the surface at any vanadium concentration. In the case of A(5) catalyst, the presence of octahedral vanadium species was also observed.
1. Introduction
The dehydrogenation reactions of short chain alkanes are currently widely investigated, because of the potential commercial interest in using alkane effectively. In this view, the oxidative dehydrogenation is an attractive way to produce the highly demanded C2–C5 alkenes from the corresponding alkanes. The main problem is that both the reactant alkane and the product alkene undergo non selective oxidation to carbon oxides. The selectivity patterns depend on the nature of both the catalyst and alkane, even if there exist some common features, such as breakage of the CH bond, which appears to be the rate determining step.
The oxidative dehydrogenation reaction of propane has been investigated over various vanadium-containing oxides [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. The different catalytic properties of supported vanadia catalysts are usually related to modifications in the co-ordination and environment of vanadium species, which can modify their redox properties. In order to better understand the influence of the support, a number of papers have been devoted to the characterisation of vanadium surface phases by using different techniques such as
solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (
) [4], [11], [16], electron spin resonance (ESR) [4], [19], [26], [39], laser Raman spectroscopy (LRS) [1], [4], [15], [17], [18], [20], [24], [27], [29], [31], [38], [39], [43], FTIR [30], [32], [33], [34], [38], [40], DR UV–VIS [4], [14], [15], [19], [21], [30], [36], [39], [40], [43], X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) [7], [11], [14], [16], [37], [38], extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) [22], TPR [17], [22], [23], [24], [25], [28], [31], [35], [37], [39] and O2 chemisorption [26], [27]. From these studies it can be concluded that both the nature of the vanadium species and the catalytic behaviour depend on the metal oxide support. However, in spite of the great amount of available data, the detailed mechanism and the characteristics of selective sites are still under debate.
Due to the strong interactions which are formed between the carrier and the supported vanadia layers, titania permits to obtain a very good dispersion of V2O5 on its surface, but the resulting samples show low surface areas and low resistance to sintering. On the contrary, SiO2 interacts weakly with V2O5, favouring the thermally induced agglomeration of the surface VOx species. Despite the low dispersion of vanadia, the use of silica as carrier is advantageous in preparing catalysts with surface areas and resistance to sintering higher than in the case of titania [37]. Hence, the preparation of mixed TiO2/SiO2 supports is an interesting route to obtain samples with: (i) a surface area higher than that usually obtained with titania (typically 50–100 m2/g); (ii) a high dispersion of the surface active species; (iii) a high resistance to sintering and good mechanical properties. The so-called grafting method, based on the chemical reaction between a species (vanadyl chloride or vanadyl triisopropoxide) containing the active element and the hydroxyl groups of the support in a water-free solvent, has been used to obtain the VOx phase on SiO2 [22], [23], Al2O3 [22], [23] and TiO2 [22], [23], [24], [30] oxides.
In the present work the grafting technique was used for preparing vanadium containing catalysts supported on TiO2, which in turn was grafted on silica. Investigation of the chemico-physical features of the prepared catalysts was carried out by several techniques: XRD, DR UV–VIS, FTIR, TPR and O2 chemisorption. The catalytic behaviour of these V2O5/TiO2/SiO2 samples in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane was investigated in the temperature range 673–773 K.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Catalysts were prepared by grafting first TiO2 and then V2O5 on silica (Aldrich, with a specific area of 450 m2/g and Grace S432, with a specific area of 321 m2/g), previously calcined at 773 K for 2 h. The support was contacted with a solution of titanium tetraisopropylate in toluene. The density of the OH groups on the silica surface was determined by means of potentiometry and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) as previously reported [41]. The titanium alkoxide concentration was then calculated so as to obtain a TiO2 monolayer. The reaction was carried out at 383 K for 6 h under stirring, by refluxing toluene. The solid was recovered by filtration, washed with toluene, dried at 388 K, steamed for 2 h and finally calcined at 773 K (2 h). The procedure was repeated three times to obtain titania multilayers. The grafted TiO2/SiO2 supports were contacted with different solutions of vanadyl triisopropoxide in n-hexane at ambient temperature, during 24 h, under He flow. After reaction the samples were filtered, washed in n-hexane, dried, hydrolysed and calcined, as in the previous cases.
2.2. Catalyst characterisation
XRD patterns were recorded on a X3000 Seifert diffractometer equipped with a lithium fluoride monochromator on the diffracted beam. The scans were collected within the range of 4–44° (2θ) using Mo Kα radiation. Diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained on a UV–VIS scanning spectrophotometer Shimatzu AV2101, equipped with an integrating sphere, using BaSO4 as reference. UV–VIS spectra were recorded in the diffuse reflectance mode (R) and transformed to a magnitude proportional to the extinction coefficient (K) through the Kubelka-Munk function (F(R)). TPR profiles were obtained under the following conditions: sample weight 100–160 mg, heating rate (from 373 to 873 K) 7 K/min, flow rate 60 cm3/min, H2–N2 6% by volume. Prior to the determination of O2 uptake, the reduced samples were cooled down to 653 K under He flow (60 cm3/min). O2 chemisorption was achieved by dosing small amounts (0.15 cm3) of O2 over the pre-reduced catalysts. Doses were repeated until peaks of constant area were obtained.
Textural analysis was carried out on a Sorptomatic 1990 System (Fisons Instruments), by determining the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at 77 K. Before analysis, the samples were heated overnight under vacuum up to 473 K (heating rate=1 K/min). The specific surface area (SBET) was assessed by the BET method.
2.3. Catalytic runs
Experimental runs lasting 8 h were performed in a quartz-glass microreactor at P=1 atm and T=673–773 K (catalyst weight=0.25 g). Prior to the catalytic test, samples were activated in situ at 773 K for 6 h, under air flow (15 cm3/min). The reaction mixture contained 10 vol.% C3H8 and 5 vol.% O2 diluted in N2 (total flow rate=50 cm3/min). On-line GC analysis was carried out on a HP 6890, equipped with a capillary column HP PORAPLOT Q and with a thermoconductivity detector.
Blank runs, performed in the empty reactor at 773 K, allowed to rule out the occurrence of homogeneous reactions to a significant extent. Conversion and selectivity were defined as follows:
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterisation
The titanium and vanadium contents, the surface area and the oxygen to vanadium ratio for each catalyst are shown in Table 1. Expectedly, the surface area is quite high for all the catalysts. Only on the G(0.1) and G(0.2) samples surface vanadium is well dispersed (O/V=1); at higher V2O5 loadings (wt.%≥2), the O/V ratio abruptly goes down, indicating the agglomeration of vanadium species into larger particles. XRD patterns are presented in Fig. 1, for the two TiO2/SiO2 supports and for the A(10) sample, which contains the highest amount of vanadium. The spectral lines of TiO2 anatase are observed, indicating that titanium oxide is not well dispersed on the supports. Previous XPS results [42] showed that a “patchy monolayer” forms upon grafting; it is the top of the “monolayer” phase which grows, upon further addition of titania, instead of the occupation of the still available silica surface. The occurrence of such a mechanism also in the present case could explain the low dispersion of TiO2 revealed by XRD. A marked decrease in the titanium dispersion for samples containing more than a monolayer of TiO2 on silica was also observed by other authors [37].

Fig. 1. X-ray diffraction patterns of the TiO2/SiO2 supports and of the sample containing the highest amount of vanadium: (∗) anatase.
The XRD pattern of A(10) sample shows the reflections of the support only, indicating that the vanadium oxide species are X-ray amorphous. Since A(10) contains the highest amount of supported vanadium, it can be reasonably supposed that the same result holds for all the other catalysts. Moreover, the diffractogram of A(10) sample shows sharper peaks in comparison with the pure support, which seems to indicate an increase in the crystallinity degree. A similar result is reported for vanadia supported on amorphous aluminophosphates (AlPOs) [44], for which a partial crystallisation of AlPO-materials is observed at high vanadium concentrations.
Information about the nature of the vanadium active species in the catalyst samples can be obtained by means of DR UV–VIS. The maximum of the charge transfer bands is strongly influenced by the number of ligands in the environment of the central ion and gives information on the co-ordination of vanadium in the clusters. V5+ in an octahedral environment exhibits a charge transfer transition in the range from 400 to 480 nm, while for tetrahedrally co-ordinated V5+ the corresponding band occurs between 300 and 350 nm [4], [21], [30], [45], [46]. Finally, absorption bands in the region 270–300 nm are characteristic of V5+ in highly isolated tetrahedra [36], [45], [46].
DR UV–VIS analyses were performed on all samples and the results are reported in Fig. 2a and b. The contribution of the TiO2/SiO2 supports (which exhibit an intense absorption band around 260 nm) was subtracted from the recorded spectra of the vanadium-containing catalysts. Samples G(0.1,0.2,2) exhibit a single absorption band centred at 364 nm, which increases with the vanadium loading, assignable to non-isolated tetrahedral species of V5+(Fig. 3a). Samples A(3,5,10) also show the charge transfer transition of the V5+ aggregated tetrahedra at 368 nm. However, the rather broadened shape of the absorption peak suggests that a contribution of octahedral vanadium species, which is particularly pronounced for the A(5) sample, is also present at wavelengths higher than 400 nm. It is generally accepted that monomeric tetrahedral species predominate at low vanadia loadings. As the loading increases, they react to form clusters of tetrahedrally co-ordinated vanadium ions and than polymeric arrays which are octahedrally co-ordinated. The presence of the contribution at 430 nm on the samples A(3,5,10) is therefore easily understandable.

TPR with hydrogen is a useful technique to characterise the reduction behaviour of the surface active species on a catalyst. The ease of reduction is conveniently measured by the temperature of maximum hydrogen consumption (Tmax), which increases as the ease of reduction decreases. Besides the experimental conditions, factors concerned with the sample itself affect the value of Tmax, such as the nature of the surface species, their concentration and their accessibility. With regard to vanadium containing oxides, it has been suggested [21] that tetrahedrally co-ordinated V5+ species are more difficult to reduce compared with the octahedrally co-ordinated ones, because of the decreased availability of the stronger bonded oxygens. On the other hand, it is generally accepted [17], [24], [28] that the reducibility of the vanadium species is also affected by the crystal size: since the rate of reduction is limited by diffusion of lattice oxygen ions, smaller crystallites are reduced more rapidly than larger crystallites. It can be concluded that the final value of Tmax is the result of the competition of different phenomena.
TPR profiles for the V2O5/TiO2/SiO2 samples are reported in Fig. 3a and b. The TPD curve for the TiO2/SiO2 Grace is also reported in Fig. 3a. It can be observed that the support is only slightly reduced in the range of the investigated temperatures. In agreement with XRD results, the presence of crystalline V2O5 can be excluded since no peaks appear at temperatures ≥873 K, which are characteristic for pure vanadia reduction [24], [25]. All samples show broadened peaks, probably because of the heterogeneity of the adsorption sites and/or the different degree of agglomeration of the vanadium species at increasing vanadium content.
It can be noted from Fig. 3a that samples prepared on silica Grace show a single peak according to the results reported in the literature for low vanadium loading [17], [24], [25]. The temperature of maximum reduction seems to slightly decrease with increasing V2O5 wt.%, indicating an increase in the reducibility of the surface. An opposite trend was reported by other authors for V2O5/TiO2 systems [24], [25], [35], but a shift to lower Tmax was observed for vanadia supported on silica and alumina [17], [23] and for vanadia grafted on TiO2/SiO2 aerogels, calcined at 873 K [47].
A(3) and A(10) samples (Fig. 4b) also show a single peak with almost the same value of Tmax, but which is higher than for G(0.1,0.2,2) of about 20 K. For the A(5) sample the peak splits in two, the Tmax for the first being slightly lower, while for the second increases to about 823 K. DR UV–VIS spectra show that, besides the predominant tetrahedral vanadium species, a pronounced contribution of octahedral polymeric arrays is also present. It has been reported [21] that the average number of vanadium ions in a cluster unit increase from 3 to 10, while passing from a tetrahedral to an octahedral co-ordination. We could therefore attribute the second peak to the reduction of this kind of highly disordered vanadium oxide, which contains vanadia clusters of larger size.

3.2. Catalytic results
Propene, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide were the main products (partially oxygenated products were not observed). The catalytic activity was stable with time-on-stream for all the samples. The results are summarised in Table 2. It is well known that an oxide that is too difficult to reduce is inactive towards the oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. Accordingly, no catalytic runs were carried out on the TiO2/SiO2 supports, which did not undergo appreciable reduction (Fig. 3a). Because of their great differences in surface areas and vanadium dispersion, overall activity (As), defined as mmolC3,reacted/h/mmolvanadium), seems a convenient parameter for comparing the catalysts.

G(0.1) and G(0.2) samples show As values of one or two orders of magnitude higher than the other catalysts. However, despite the good dispersion of the surface species, conversions are low, due to the very low amount of supported vanadium. The overall activity as function of the amount of vanadium is reported in Fig. 4 for samples G(2) and A(3,5,10), whose dispersion values are comparable. The catalytic activity decreases with increasing vanadium loading. This can be reasonably due to a decreased accessibility of the active sites. The best catalytic results in terms of conversion and selectivity to propene are shown by A(5) catalyst, on which non-isolated and octahedral species are simultaneously present. It appears from the literature that, depending on the support, both isolated [1], [45], [46] and polymeric tetrahedral V5+ species [1], [4], [11], [38], [43] are active and selective sites in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, while vanadium in octahedral position is reported to have a higher activity, but a lower selectivity to propene [48]. At variance with such a clear-cut conclusion, present results for A(5) catalyst suggest that both non-isolated and octahedral V5+ species are responsible for catalytic activity.
A Mars-Van Krevelen redox-type mechanism [49] is generally invoked in the oxidative dehydrogenation reactions, the rate determining step being the breaking of the CH bond of the alkane molecule. The resulting species can either desorb or be further oxidised to carbon oxides. Its fate depends on both the binding energy of the lattice oxygen (which in turn depends on the ease and on the extent of reduction of the catalyst) and the desorption rate of the olefinic product. It is generally assumed that the olefin is present on the surface under the form of a π-complex. An electron transfer from the double bond area to the empty d-orbital of the metal ion is involved, as well as back donation from the metal d-orbital to the empty molecular orbital of the olefin. Back donation will be enhanced when the metal ion is in a lower valence state. Hence, as the reduction proceeds, the strength of the alkene bonding to the surface increases and the desorption of the olefin becomes unfavoured in comparison with its complete oxidation by lattice oxygen. It has been reported [9] that reduction of V/Ti catalysts with propane pulses gives mainly CO and CO2 as gaseous products, no propene being observed. This is also the case for V/Zr catalysts [43], where the amount of propene detected was negligible. Only when the catalyst reduction degree is low (i.e. in the presence of oxygen in the gas phase) propene is easily desorbed. At steady-state, the catalyst undergoes cyclic reduction and re-oxidation. The rates of the two processes are differently influenced by temperature, due to the higher activation energy of re-oxidation [9]. It seems that a key step in the re-oxidation cycle is the replenishment of oxygen vacancies [21], which requires the diffusion of the gaseous oxygen in the lattice [9]. An increase in temperature would enhance such a diffusion process, hence leading to a catalyst with a low reduction degree, which in turn favours propene desorption over its complete oxidation. According to this picture, a remarkable increase in selectivity occurs going from 673 to 773 K for all the catalysts.
Fig. 5 shows that CO/CO2 increases with the amount of vanadium up to 0.71 mmol/g (which correspond to A(5) sample) and then decreases, both at 673 and 773 K. The value of the ratio is higher at the highest temperature at any vanadium loading. It can be noted from Fig. 6, on which product selectivities are reported as function of vanadium content at 773 K, that selectivity to propene increases mainly at carbon dioxide’s expense, since the formed amount of CO changes very slightly with vanadium loading. A similar trend was observed at 673 K. It is also worth to point out that CO selectivity is almost constant with temperature. It has been postulated [8] on the basis of kinetic results that CO and CO2 are mainly formed from propene by parallel reactions of similar activation energies. The formation of carbon oxides directly from propane is only a minor contribution. Mori et al. [50] have shown that the difference in selectivity, in the butane oxidation reaction on vanadium oxide catalysts, was related to the difference in the catalyst structure. They proposed that a smooth V2O5 surface, with few defects, is formed on V2O5/TiO2 catalysts having low concentration of vanadium and that the number of surface defects increases with increasing vanadium content. They also suggested that the surface VO species at the surface defect produces both CO and CO2, while that in the smooth face leads to the selective formation of CO2.

Very recently, Chen et al. [51] showed that CO forms via secondary combustion of propene, while CO2 forms via this reaction and also via the direct combustion of propane. The rate constants for the formation of propane to either carbon dioxide (directly) or propene are of the same order, both being one order of magnitude lower than that for the transformation of propene to carbon oxides. They also suggested [15], [38], [52] that similar surface structures, e.g. VO or VOV bonds, are required for propane dehydrogenation and propene combustion, while the VOM (where M is the metal ion of the support) bond is responsible of the primary combustion reaction of propane. Present results seem in agreement with this picture. The highest amounts of CO2 are formed on G(0.1) and G(0.2) samples (at 673 K, carbon dioxide is the main product for both the above-mentioned catalysts), which contain a very low amount of vanadium. Due to the high dispersion of the surface species on these catalysts, it can be reasonably assumed that VOTi groups are exposed, leading to the formation of higher amounts of CO2, with respect to the other vanadium-containing samples.
