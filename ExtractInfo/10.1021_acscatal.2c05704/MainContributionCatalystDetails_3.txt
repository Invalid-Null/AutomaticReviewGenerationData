The document does not appear to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation to propylene. It focuses on propane and isobutane dehydrogenation to propene and isobutene over ZnO-based catalysts supported on different materials. While it mentions propane dehydrogenation, the main focus seems to be comparing propane and isobutane dehydrogenation over different catalysts rather than optimizing a specific catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It does not go into details about enhancing propane dehydrogenation performance.
