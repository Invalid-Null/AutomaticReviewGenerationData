First-Principles Design of a Highly Active and Selective V2CO2-Based Double-Atom Catalyst for Ethane Dehydrogenation to Ethylene
Graphical Abstract
A high activity double atom catalyst for the reaction of ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene.
Abstract
The electrocatalytic ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene reaction (EDH) offers an alternative to the traditional steam cracking method for sustainable ethylene production but suffers sluggish kinetics due to the inert C−H bonds. Herein, a novel strategy is proposed for designing efficient double-atom catalysts (DACs) via first principle calculations. We examined the C−H activation of methane by single-atom catalysts (SACs) and constructed activity maps using activation energy as the activity descriptor, where methane is the simplest probe molecule to establish trends in C−H activation. Particularly, due to the strong d-σ* coupling between ethane and Rh atoms, Rh2@V2CO2 presents excellent EDH performance with particularly low energy barriers (0.64 eV for the C2H6* to C2H5* step and 0.63 eV for the C2H5* to C2H4* step). This work not only demonstrates the possibility of developing novel DACs for EDH but also provides a new strategy for designing efficient DACs.
Introduction
Ethylene is an essential material in the chemical industry with great market demand, mainly for the production of synthetic fibers, rubbers, and plastics.1-3 The traditional ethane-to-ethylene process suffers from low selectivity, environmental pollution, and energy consumption.4, 5 Two alternatives to the traditional method are the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODH: C2H6+O2=2 C2H4+2H2O) and the electrochemical ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene reaction (EDH: C2H6=C2H4+2H++2e−), both of which can be carried out at low temperatures to reduce environmental pollution and energy consumption.6, 7 For the ODH reaction, the foreign oxygen may cause excessive oxidation of ethane as the reaction proceeds and reduce the selectivity of ethylene. In contrast, EDH allows the direct conversion of ethane to ethylene without the involvement of other reactants, which can avoid most of the problems caused by ODH.8, 9 Unfortunately, EDH suffers from sluggish kinetic challenges due to the presence of inert C−H bonds.10, 11 Thus, it is of particular interest to design an electrocatalyst for EDH with excellent stability, activity, and selectivity.
Currently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have been widely applied in electrocatalysis due to their superior catalytic performance and maximum atom utilization.12-16 For instance, the single Rh atom anchored in Cu(111) slab exhibited a lower kinetic barrier for the propane dehydrogenation, which is superior to the pure Cu(111) surface.17 Theoretically, the Mn atom doped on V2O3 was predicted to be a high-performance propane dehydrogenation catalyst.18 However, since alkane dehydrogenation involves multi-step dehydrogenation intermediate reactions, it is still difficult for the single active center to simultaneously break the multiple separate C−H bonds. To overcome this problem, a promising approach is to introduce another active site to activate the intermediate. Compared with SACs, double-atom catalysts (DACs) offer more active sites and interatomic synergy, which can minimize the reaction barrier.19-22 For example, the PtSn heteronuclear diatomic doped on CeO2 delivered better activity, and higher selectivity than Pt1-CeO2 for the production of propylene.23 So far, great efforts have been devoted to the design of DACs. However, most design principles use potential-determining steps as descriptors to screen out the ideal DACs, which is useful but inefficient. Thus, it is imperative to develop a viable strategy, which can simplify the design process.
Since MXene emerged in 2011 as a new type of 2D material, it has been widely applied in electrocatalysis, batteries, and capacitors due to its excellent electrical conductivity and chemical stability.24-28 The large specific surface area indicates that MXene can be an ideal substrate for atomically dispersed catalysts.29-32 Experimentally, a single Pt atom was successfully embedded in defective Ti3C2Tx, and exhibited excellent CO2 reduction reaction performance.33 In addition, NiNi and FeNi diatom dispersed on the Ti2CO2 surface were predicted to have high stability and favorable bifunctional oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen oxidation reaction (ORR/OER) activity.34 Although there are many precedents for transition atoms modified MXene materials as electrocatalysts, few studies on MXene-based atom catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation reactions.35-38 As a member of the MXene family, V2CO2 has been successfully synthesized, but the applications and properties of V2CO2 MXene in the field of atomic catalysts have not been fully explored.39, 40 Furthermore, vanadium-based oxides are widely used in alkane dehydrogenation reactions.18, 41 Therefore, it is interesting to explore the application of vanadium-based MXene loaded with transition metal (TM) atoms in the dehydrogenation reaction of alkanes.
Herein, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we doped a series of TM atoms on V2CO2 and analyzed the C−H activation of methane on the SACs surface, which is the simplest method to establish the C−H activation trends. First, we calculated the activation energies for the removal of the first hydrogen from methane on the SACs surface. As the suppression of the second H desorption is essential to obtain ethylene selectively, we further calculated the activation energies of CH3*-to-CH2*. According to the screening results, the Au@V2CO2 and Rh@V2CO2 SACs can satisfy the activity and selectivity requirements. Next, the underlying mechanism of the CH4 activation and the origin of the activity were demonstrated by Bader charge analysis and crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis. Following this, the structures of Au2@V2CO2 and Rh2@V2CO2 were constructed and the stabilities of these two candidates were examined through the adsorption energies and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, the Au2@V2CO2 DAC was excluded due to the significant structure distortion. Finally, the dehydrogenation process of Rh2@V2CO2 was calculated, which presented favorable EDH activity with energy barriers of 0.64 eV and 0.63 eV for the first H dehydrogenation and the C2H5*-to-C2H4* step, respectively.
Computational Methods
All calculations were performed by using periodic DFT periodic as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP).42-44 In this study, we performed all computations using a 4×4 supercell of V2CO2. The core electrons were modeled using the Projected Augmented Wave (PAW) approach.45 The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) was used to model the electron interactions.46 Plane-wave cutoff energy was set to 500 eV for all computations, and the convergence tolerances for residual force and energy were set to 0.03 eV Å−1 and 10−7 eV. The reciprocal space was sampled using the 2×2×1 and 4×4×1 k-points for geometry optimization and electronic structure calculations, respectively. To prevent the interaction between two periodic images, a vacuum space of at least 15 Å was applied in the z-axis direction. Considering the van der Waals interaction, the DFT-D3 correction as proposed by Grimme was adopted for all calculations.47 The Bader charge analysis was carried out to obtain the amount of charge transfer.48 The climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) was employed for the transition state energies.49, 50 To evaluate the stabilities, we tested the structures at 500 K using AIMD simulations in 10 ps with a time step of 2 fs.51 The VASPsol was used to calculate the implicit solvation model to illustrate the solute-water solvent interactions.52
The adsorption energies (Ead) of metal atoms (single or double) were calculated by the queation (Eq. [1])s:
(1)
where E and E are the total energies of the V2CO2 substrate with and without adsorbed atoms, respectively, ETM is the total energy of the isolated TM atom.
The energy barriers of alkane dehydrogenation were determined by the activation energy Ea, which is defined as(Eq. [2]):

Results and discussions
Structures and stabilities of TM@V2CO2
The relaxed lattice constants are a=b=2.888 Å for the V2C monolayer, which are in good agreement with previous computation values.53 Experimentally, O-terminated MXenes are always applied in electrocatalysis due to the thermodynamic stability of the structure and tunable surface chemistry.25, 30 However, the O-groups are inert to pre-reacted molecules. Hence, the addition of metal atomic sites to the surface to facilitate catalytic reactions is a feasible strategy. According to previous research,17 single-atom alloys composed of Pt, Rh, Au, and Cu elements have been predicted to show excellent performance in activating C−H bonds. Thus, we examined VIII and IB main group metal atoms adsorbed on the surface of V2CO2. Four different single-atom adsorption sites exist on V2CO2: top, bridge (bri), fcc, and hcp (Figure 1a).

The stabilities of all these atoms adsorbed on different sites are verified by the adsorption energies Ead (Eq. [1]). Notably, systems with Ead <0 eV can be considered thermodynamically stable, and smaller Ead values represent better stability of the systems.19, 54 As shown in Figure 1b, all candidates are above the evaluation criteria, which indicates that our strategy is reliable. Except for Au and Ag atoms, most metal atoms adsorbed on the fcc or hcp site result in lower adsorption energies, suggesting adsorption occurs more easily. Au and Ag atoms tend to adsorb on the top site with high adsorption energies, which may lead to the migration of adsorbed atoms. Furthermore, the adsorbed atoms on the bri site tend to migrate to the hcp or fcc site.
CH4 adsorption and activation
Determining an excellent DAC for EDH is mainly justified by the SACs which can satisfy the following aspects: (i) Appropriate adsorption energy of CH4 can guarantee sufficient CH4 activation and subsequent dehydrogenation process. (ii) Whether it can effectively promote the first H desorption from CH4 while suppressing the second hydrogen desorption. Herein, we first examined the C−H activation of methane by SACs, which can establish trends in C−H activation.
CH4 is first adsorbed on the electrode and followed by progressively electrochemically dehydrogenated to CH3*/CH2*/CH*/C*. The prerequisite for the dehydrogenation step is the adsorption and activation of the inert CH4. Thus, the adsorptions of CH4 on TM@V2CO2 were investigated. The results of our calculations demonstrate that Ead values for CH4 on these catalysts are negative (Table S1), suggesting that the adsorption of CH4 can be carried out easily at room temperature. In addition, Os@V2CO2 was excluded due to a dramatic change in the structure after the adsorption of CH4.
The calculated activation energy of the first C−H cleavage can reflect the tendency of H atoms to migrate from the active centers to neighboring O atoms, and Ea is obtained by the Eq. [2]. As shown in Figure 2 and Figures S1–8, among all the screened SACs, the activation energies of Au@V2CO2, Pt@V2CO2, and Rh@V2CO2 are 0.60, 0.59, and 0.58 eV, respectively, exhibiting excellent catalytic performance toward to the first dehydrogenation step. Furthermore, due to the strong interaction between CH4 and Ir, the C−H bond can be easily broken and the dehydrogenation reaction of Ir@V2CO2 from the initial state to the final state needs to overcome a small energy barrier, but H is more inclined to adsorb on Rh, leading to deactivation of the catalyst. As we have defined, an excellent EDH electrocatalyst must suppress the second H desorption. After identifying the promising candidates for C−H activation, we calculated the energy profile for the second dehydrogenation of CH3*-to-CH2* on Au@V2CO2, Pt@V2CO2, and Rh@V2CO2 (Figures 4b and S8). Notably, Au@V2CO2 and Rh@V2CO2 showed higher activation energy than that of Pt@V2CO2 (2.35, 1.83, and 0.38 eV for Au@V2CO2, Rh@V2CO2, and Pt@V2CO2, respectively). Based on these calculation results, Au- and Rh-based atomic catalysts are considered for further applications of dehydrogenation reactions.

Inspired by previous work,19 the σ molecular orbitals of CH4 donate electrons to the unoccupied d orbitals of TM atoms. Meanwhile, the occupied d orbitals back donation electrons to the σ* orbitals of CH4, forming partial occupation of the σ* orbital. This “donation-back donation” mechanism can strengthen the CH4 adsorption while activating the inert C−H bond. Charge density difference plots suggest that TM@V2CO2 can accept electrons from the CH4 while donating electrons back to the antibonding orbitals of CH4 (Figure 3). Four systems, including Au@V2CO2, Ir@V2CO2, Pt@V2CO2, and Rh@V2CO2 exhibit more charge transfer compared to other V2CO2-based SACs between TM atoms and CH4, which can remarkably activate the C−H bond, resulting in significant C−H bond elongation (1.14–1.23 Å, vs 1.09 Å for free CH4).

As shown in Figure 4a, the threefold degenerate t2 orbital possesses C−H bonding characters, while the unoccupied σ1* orbital possesses C−H antibonding characters. Compared with the free CH4, as methane is adsorbed on the surface of TM atoms, the localized CH4 molecular orbitals diffuse and shift down (Figures 4b-l). The σ molecular orbitals of CH4 donate electrons to the unoccupied d orbitals of TM atoms. Meanwhile, the occupied d orbitals back donation electrons to the σ* orbitals of CH4, forming partial occupation of the σ* orbital near the Fermi level.

We obtained the integrated-crystal orbital Hamilton population (ICOHP) between TM and C atoms by calculating the band states integral up to the highest occupied energy level (Figures 4 b-l).55 Notably, the positive and negative values of ICOHP correspond to the contributions of bonding and antibonding states, respectively. The calculated ICOHPs for Au@V2CO2, Ir@V2CO2, Pt@V2CO2, and Rh@V2CO2 are −1.80, −3.50, −2.29, and −1.31, respectively. Figure S9 presents that a more negative ICOHP value corresponds to a longer C−H bond. Particularly, there is an approximately linear relationship between ICOHP and C−H bond length difference with R2 of 0.90, suggesting a robust correlation between electron transfer and CH4 activation.
Ethane dehydrogenation on Rh2@V2CO2
Due to the single active site of SACs cannot simultaneously activate two independent C−H bonds of ethane, another active site was created to synergize with the original one. Based on the screening results, Au2@V2CO2, Rh2@V2CO2, and AuRh@V2CO2 were constructed. Before calculating the active performance, we examined the stability of these three candidates. Figure S10 illustrates the structure of Au and Rh adsorption sites for DACs, showing that Au and Rh diatoms are adsorbed on the top and hcp sites, respectively. The Ead of Au2@V2CO2 and Rh2@V2CO2 are calculated as −2.09 and −4.26 eV, respectively, indicating Au atom adsorption on the V2CO2 surface exhibits relatively weak interactions compared with Rh atoms. Furthermore, the calculated ICOHP values of AuRh@V2CO2 are −1.25 and −3.43 for Au−O and Rh−O, respectively (Figure S11), also illustrating the relatively weak interaction between Au and O atoms. This weak interaction may lead to the migration of the adsorbed atoms during the reaction. The bond length of the two metal atoms are 2.59, 2.51 Å, and 2.55 (for Au2@V2CO2, Rh2@V2CO2, and AuRh@V2CO2, respectively). Such interatomic interaction ensures interatomic electron transfer, which may result in catalytic performance superior to that of SACs.
The AIMD simulations were performed to further examine the thermal stabilities of Au2@V2CO2, Rh2@V2CO2, and AuRh@V2CO2 at 500 K for 10 ps with a time step of 2 fs. For the AIMD simulations, systems present narrow energy fluctuations and well-maintained geometric structures within the simulations time indicate thermodynamically stable. The results of both DACs are shown in Figure 5, where the geometric structure of Au2@V2CO2 changes dramatically, while the adsorbed atoms are still at the pre-optimized adsorption sites for Rh2@V2CO2 and AuRh@V2CO2, illustrating the thermodynamic stability of Rh2@V2CO2 and AuRh@V2CO2.

The EDH process can be simply described by two dehydrogenation steps. Starting with the adsorption of gas-phase ethane, followed by the fracture of the first and second C−H bonds to form 1-ethyl and 2-ethyl. According to our predictions, Rh2@V2CO2 and AuRh@V2CO2 are considered to be promising catalysts for ethane dehydrogenation. For AuRh@V2CO2, the Au atom migrates with the production of 1-ethyl due to the relatively weak interactions. On the contrary, Rh2@V2CO2 presents excellent stability and exhibits a low energy barrier for the formation of ethylene. As we can see in Figure 6a, the Rh2@V2CO2 DAC provides a favorable energy barrier for the first dehydrogenation step (0.64 eV) and a similar subsequent kinetic barrier for the C2H5*-to-C2H4* step (0.63 eV), exceeding most reported works (Table S2).

As illustrated in Figure 6b, due to a large amount of charge transfer between ethane and Rh atoms, ethane is significantly activated by Rh atoms. The transfer of the d electron of the Rh atom to the σ* orbital of the C−H bond leads to the elongation of the C−H, which can make the H atom easily desorbed from the ethane. Furthermore, we calculated the PDOS between the metal dimers and C2H6 to understand the underlying mechanism of C2H6 activation (Figure 6c). The strong interaction of the d orbitals of the Rh atom with the σ* orbitals of C2H6 results in the σ* orbitals shift down to near the Fermi level and being partially occupied. These strong d-σ* coupling allows the activation of the inert C−H bond.
To understand the effect of solventization on the reaction mechanism, we applied the implicit solvation model to study the EDH reaction pathway. As shown in Table 1, although the large Esolv (Eq. [3]) values of reaction intermediates, the magnitude of the overpotential (Eq. [4]) of the initial and final states of the implicit solvent model remains essentially keep up with that of the vacuum model. The subtle difference in overpotential implies that the implicit model is consistent with the vacuum model catalytic mechanism.56

Conclusions
In summary, we systematically examined the activation energy of methane dehydrogenation on V2CO2-based SACs and screened the active transition metal atoms that could activate the C−H bonds by DFT calculations. With the rational screening criteria of promoting the first dehydrogenation while suppressing the CH3*-CH2* step, the Au- and Ru-based systems were selected. The intrinsic mechanism of C−H bond cleavage was investigated by charge density difference and COHP, and a linear relationship between the ICOHP values and the C−H bond length difference was obtained. Based on the screened results, the homonuclear Au2@V2CO2 and Rh2@V2CO2 DACs were constructed. Furthermore, the stability of the DACs was surveyed by the adsorption energy values and AIMD simulations. According to the computed results, the Rh2@V2CO2 DAC can meet the needs in practical applications and shows outstanding activities for the first H dehydrogenation and the C2H5*-to-C2H4* step with favorable energy barriers of 0.64 eV and 0.63 eV, respectively. Our work not only develops an efficient electrocatalyst with high stability, activity, and selectivity for EDH but also provides novel insights for designing the DACs.
