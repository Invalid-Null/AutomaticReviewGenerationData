Non-thermal plasma in honeycomb catalyst for the high-throughput removal of dilute styrene from air
This study focused on the removal of styrene using a metal-coated monolith (MCM) catalyst integrated with non-thermal plasma. The MCM catalyst was prepared by depositing a ZSM-5 support impregnated with a combination of three metals (Co, Pd, La) on a practical-scale honeycomb monolith. A comparative study with a commercial metal-coated monolith (CMCM) of the same dimensions was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the MCM with respect to styrene removal. The plasma discharge in the monolith was characterized by measuring the voltage and current waveforms and optical emission spectroscopy (OES). The electric power of the plasma discharge largely depended on the metal loading, flow rate, and humidity of the feed gas. The removal efficiency of styrene (inlet concentration: 20 parts per million, volumetric (ppm)) was examined using both plasma catalytic oxidation (PCO) and thermal catalytic oxidation (TCO), to enable the effect of plasma to be clearly assessed. PCO with the MCM catalyst achieved styrene removal efficiency of nearly 100% at a specific energy input (SEI) of 40 J/L, whereas the CMCM catalyst achieved 92% removal for identical SEI. In comparison, TCO with the MCM and CMCM catalysts required high temperatures of 420 °C and 480 °C, respectively, for the complete removal of styrene. In addition, the CO2 selectivity of the MCM catalyst was higher at 83% compared with 75% for the CMCM at SEI of 40 J/L. The optimal silica binder content for the deposition of a robust washcoat layer was found to be approximately 5%.
1. Introduction
Air pollution is a global issue because of its catastrophic impact on the environment and human health. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are large groups of chemical compounds (such as styrene, toluene, aldehyde, and ketones) that are being released into the environment from various industrial and automobile sources and are extremely dangerous for the environment [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Many environmental problems such as photochemical smog, global warming and haze, and ground-level O3 are caused by VOCs, which affect humans by causing headaches, coughing, and cancer [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. The adverse effect of VOCs on the environment and living organisms has motivated many researchers to develop a system capable of efficiently degrading VOCs. Typical methods such as thermal oxidation [11], [12], catalytic oxidation [13], [14], photocatalysis [15], [16], adsorption [17], membrane separation [18], [19], and biodegradation [20] have low removal efficiency at room temperature, particularly when low concentrations of VOCs are being processed. On the other hand, non-thermal plasma (NTP), which is used at atmospheric pressure and at room temperature, is supposedly much eco-friendlier and energy-efficient when low concentrations of VOCs in the gas phase need to be removed [1], [5], [21], [22]. Plasma is characterized by the generation of high-energy electrons, which collide with the O2/H2O molecules to form highly active species such as ozone, O• and OH•, which can react with the VOCs. Decomposing VOCs using plasma alone has disadvantages such as low energy efficiency, the formation of unwanted by-products, and low selectivity towards CO2. However, these problems can be overcome by combining NTP with heterogeneous catalysis which eventually increases the selectivity of CO2, decreases the formation of by-products, and improves the energy efficiency [5], [23], [24], [25].
The decomposition efficiency of VOCs using NTP with catalysts mainly depends on the reactor configuration and the type of catalysts. Several types of NTP reactor configurations, such as corona discharge [1], [26], dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) [5], [22], [27], [28], [29], surface discharge [23], [30], [31], and gliding arc discharge [32], [33], are available for processing VOCs. Each one of these configurations has its advantages and disadvantages. Among the NTP reactor configurations, the gliding arc reactor consumes more power and the DBD and surface discharge reactors are not easily scalable to treat a large flow rate of contaminated gas. Hence, corona discharge with a honeycomb catalyst seems to be the most promising and practically feasible way to decompose VOCs present in a large flow rate of contaminated air. The corona discharge configuration is very simple and is composed of only high voltage and ground electrodes. A corona discharge has been reported [1], [34], [35], [36], [37] to be highly effective to decompose VOCs and for wastewater treatment and motivated us to choose this configuration over other NTP configurations.
The catalyst has also a huge impact on the plasma catalytic oxidation (PCO) of VOCs. Generally, pellet/powder type catalysts cause large pressure drops, which increase the operating cost required to maintain the flow rate. This problem is best solved by using honeycomb plasma as the most viable option because of the negligible pressure drop associated with this reactor. The low-pressure reaction conditions enhanced the attractiveness of using the honeycomb catalyst in this study. The removal efficiency, formation of by-products, and CO2 selectivity also depend on the type of catalyst used in the experiment, including the material that supports the catalyst in the plasma zone. In this regard, Al2O3, ZSM-5, and TiO2 are widely used as support materials because of their porous nature. A series of transition metals or metal oxides, such as manganese (Mn), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), palladium (Pd), and lanthanum (La), have been used as the active components. Abedi et al. [38] investigated the decomposition of chlorinated volatile organic compounds using NTP coupled with TiO2, ZnO, and TiO2-ZnO supported on granular activated carbon (GAC) and found the removal efficiency of the TiO2-ZnO/GAC composite to be higher. Van Drum et al. [10] used NTP combined with the CuO-MnO2/TiO2 catalyst to decompose toluene with an energy efficiency of 1.06 g/kWh, which was 35 times more energy-efficient than the use of plasma alone. Gómez et al. [39] used a tri-metal (Co-La-Ce) combination to increase the catalytic activity to decompose toluene and ethyl acetate using the thermal catalytic oxidation (TCO) process. Zhao et al. [40] studied a honeycomb-shaped PtSnNa/γ-Al2O3/cordierite monolith catalyst, where it was shown that the monolithic catalyst exhibited better catalytic performance such as stability and selectivity than that of classical granular catalyst. Tong et al. [41] designed and synthesized a novel PtSnNa/ZSM-5 monolith catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and compared it with granular catalyst. The catalytic activity was stable along with the reaction time and showed better catalytic activity than the granular catalyst.
This study aimed to optimize several parameters such as the binder concentration of the washcoating mixture for the application of ZSM-5 to the honeycomb monolith, the metal content by means of a simple impregnation method using the tri-metal (Co-Pd-La) to obtain the maximum discharge power without arcing, and to decompose styrene with higher removal efficiency. The performance of the tri-metal catalyst on the honeycomb monolith was compared with that of a commercial metal-coated monolith (CMCM) catalyst comprising Co, Pd, La, and Pt, under similar operating conditions. The performance of the catalysts was evaluated by assessing the efficiency of decomposing styrene using the PCO and TCO processes.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
The cordierite monolithic honeycomb used in this study had a cell density of 300 cpsi (cells per square inch) and was purchased from Ceracomb Co., Ltd., Korea. ZSM-5 (HSZ-822HOA) powder and Ludox HS-40 colloidal silica (40 wt% suspension in H2O) were purchased from Toson Corp., Japan and Sigma Aldrich, Korea, respectively. The BET surface area of the ZSM-5 was mentioned in the level as 330 m2/g. Cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Co(NO3)2.6H2O), and ethanol were purchased from Sigma Aldrich, Korea. Palladium (II) nitrate dihydrate (Pd(NO3)2.2H2O) was purchased from Kojima Chemicals Co., Ltd., Japan. Lanthanum (III) nitrate hexahydrate (La(NO3)2.6H2O) was purchased from Daejung Chemical and Metal Co., Ltd., Korea.
2.2. Mechanical stability test of the ZSM-5 coating layer
Ensuring a uniform and robust coating layer on the honeycomb monolith is the main goal when fabricating the monolith catalyst. Five samples with different binder concentrations were prepared. The slurry for washcoating was prepared using the ZSM-5, SiO2 binder, H2O, and ethanol. A total of 150 g of the slurry was prepared, and the ZSM-5 and binder together formed 20%. The compositions of all the slurries with the percentage of the components are given in Table 1. Uniform mixtures were obtained by stirring the slurries overnight (12 h) in the respective beakers that were sealed using paper film to prevent the ethanol from evaporating. The cordierite monolith was cut into cuboids with the size of (100 cells, 1.6 × 1.6 × 5 cm3). The cuboid samples were immersed in acetone for cleaning in an ultrasonic bath (JAC-4020, KODO Methodal Research Co., Ltd, South Korea) for 40 min. After that, the samples were placed in an oven at a temperature of 110 °C for 5 h to dry. Soon after drying, the weight of each sample was measured and noted. The average weight of the samples was found to be 7.1 g.

As mentioned above, five types of slurry were prepared with different binder concentrations. The dry monolith was immersed in the slurry for 3 min to obtain a thin coating layer. The monolith was subsequently blown by air (flow rate through a 6-mm tube: 10 L/min) to remove the excess slurry solution from the monolith channels to prevent them from being clogged. After that, the monolith was air-dried in an oven for 4 h at 110 °C. The ZSM-5 coating can be loaded onto the monolith several times and, in this study, the process was repeated four times. Finally, the monolith was calcined at a temperature of 550 for 5 h. After the calcination, all the coated monoliths were weighed and their dry weights were noted. Subsequently, the coated monoliths were immersed in distilled water and subjected to sonication for 30 min. After that, the monoliths were dried at 120 °C for 5 h in an oven and their weights were measured to determine the weight loss. The results are summarized in Table 2 and Fig. 1, where it can be seen that the binder content of 5% is appropriate for the robustness of the ZSM-5 coating layer.

2.3. Preparation of the honeycomb monolith catalyst
Five honeycomb monoliths with cylindrical shapes with a height of 50 mm and a diameter of 30 mm (volume: 35.3 cm3) were cut from a commercial honeycomb, of which the height and diameter were 50 and 93 mm, respectively. These honeycomb monoliths were coated with the slurry (15% ZSM-5, 5% binder, 40% water, and 40% ethanol) using the procedure discussed above. Three different metals, namely cobalt, palladium, and lanthanum, were used in the catalyst in a ratio of Co: Pd: La = 8.0:1.0:1.0. All the catalysts were prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation method. Four solutions containing the metals (Co: Pd: La = 8.0:1.0:1.0) were prepared to obtain the ZSM-5 coatings with different metal contents of 5%, 7%, 10%, and 12%. The solution was added dropwise onto both sides of the ZSM-5-coated monolith until the monolith became saturated with the solution. After saturation, the monolith was dried at room temperature for 2 h and then placed inside the oven at 95 °C for 3 h. These processes were repeated three times to consume the 45-mL solution. Finally, the ZSM-5 coated monoliths impregnated with the metals were calcinated at 550 °C for 5 h.
2.4. Apparatus and methods
The experimental setup and photographic images of the plasma discharge are shown in Fig. 2, where Fig. 2(a) shows the experimental setup for the corona discharge, Fig. 2(b) shows an image of the MCM catalyst with the corona plasma, and Fig. 2(c) shows an image of the CMCM catalyst with the corona plasma. For this work, the diameter and the height of the monoliths were 30 mm (3 cm) and 50 mm (5 cm), respectively, which were cut from the commercial bare and metal-coated monolith (93 mm (3 cm) and 50 mm (5 cm)) using cylindrical diamond coated cutter. Two perforated disk electrodes fabricated with stainless steel were used as the power electrode and ground electrode, respectively. The diameter and thickness of the electrode were 30 mm and 2 mm, respectively. The gap between the power electrode and monolith was 2 mm with no gap between the ground electrode and monolith. The plasma was generated by using a 400 Hz AC power source. The electrical data of the plasma were recorded using an oscilloscope (DPO 3034, Tektronix, USA) with a current probe (Model 2100, Pearson Electronic, USA) and a high-voltage probe (P6015A, Tektronix, USA). Dwyer flow meters (Dwyer Instruments, Inc., USA) were used to control the flow rates. Air containing water vapor was fed into the reactor by humidifying a portion of the air stream and then mixing it with another dry portion. The humidity of the gas flow was continuously monitored using a TES-1370 NDIR CO2 Temperature Humidity Meter. The concentration of styrene was measured using gas chromatography (GC) (Bruker 450-GC, USA). The instrument was equipped with 60-m long capillary column (BR-624 ms, Bruker, USA) along with a flame ionization detector (FID). The oven temperature was increased from 150 °C to 200 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min and N2 gas was used as the carrier gas at a rate of 6 mL/min. The temperature of the reactor was measured using a thermocouple (ED6-FKMAP4 NUX, South Korea). The TCO was carried out in an oven (Daeheung Science Co., DTF-50300, Korea). The CO2 selectivity and effluent gas analysis were accomplished using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) (FTIR-7600, Lambda Scientific, Australia). The surface morphology and presence of the metals on the monolith catalyst were confirmed using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Hitachi SU-70, Japan and HORIBA Scientific, Japan, respectively). The catalysts were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) (3rd Generation Empyrean, Malvern Panalytical, UK).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effect of metal loading on the discharge power
In honeycomb plasma, the presence of metal is highly important to generate uniform stable plasma along the honeycomb channel. A lower metal content generates less discharge power and excessively high metal content causes arcing. Hence, it is very important to optimize the metal loading such that maximum discharge power can be obtained without arcing. The effect of the metal content on the voltage and current waveforms and discharge power is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3(a) shows the voltage and current waveforms and Fig. 3(b) shows the discharge power corresponding to those conditions. The gas flow rate and water content were set to 10 L/min and 3%, respectively, with constant applied voltage of 30 kV (peak value) in each case. Since the voltage waveforms are overlap one another, higher current draws higher power. The lowest current and discharge power were obtained when the monolith was coated with only ZSM-5, as shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). The discharge power increased as the metal content on the monolith was increased. The 10% MCM exhibited the highest discharge power of 6.8 W. The MCM with 12% metal content experienced frequent arcing, with the result that no data were recorded, and 10% MCM was considered to be optimal. The CMCM delivered 7.7 W under the same condition. All subsequent studies were carried out using 10% MCM and CMCM. This 10% metal content corresponds to 0.75% on the based on the total weight of the prepared MCM.

Fig. 3. Effect of the metal content on voltage and current waveforms (a) and the discharge power under the same conditions (b) (flow rate: 10 L/min, Voltage: 30 kV, H2O: 3%).
After getting the clear information on the optimal metal loading for the MCM, the appropriate metal ratio was found on the basis of discharge power and styrene oxidation, as shown in Fig. 4. For this experiment, the gas flow rate and water content were kept constant at 10 L/min and 3%, respectively, with varying the applied voltage from 20 to 30 kV. Fig. 4(a) shows the effect of the metal ratio on the discharge power at various applied voltages. From the figure, it is seen that the change in the metal ratio had an influence on the discharge power. When the ratio of the metals was set to catalyst A, the discharge power increased from 3.2 to 6.8 W at the applied voltages of 20–30 kV. After that, the ratio was changed to catalyst B. At this condition, Pd content was increased with decreasing the La content, keeping the total metal content constant at 10%. The maximum discharge power obtained was 5.1 W at 24 kV. Beyond 24 kV, numerous arcing occurred, which made it impossible to further increase the voltage. From this experiment, the applied voltage was found to be very sensitive to the Pd content; hence, the Pd content was very important for this honeycomb corona discharge study. Increasing the Pd content created frequent arcing, and thus the metal ratio was again changed to catalyst C. In this case, the Pd content was decreased with increasing the La content and then fabricated the catalyst. With this catalyst, the discharge power increased from 2.4 to 5.8 W when the applied voltage was increased from 20–30 kV. There was no arcing observed with this metal ratio. Finally, the ratio of the metals was changed to catalyst D or Co-alone case. In this case, the discharge power increased from 2.1 to 5.0 W by increasing the applied voltage from 20 kV to 30 kV, which was lower than the previous ratios, justifying that the power increased in the presence of Pd and La. In addition, the catalyst prepared with 10% Pd-alone and 10% La-alone on the basis of the ZSM-5 wt cannot be used due to the arcing problem; thus, no data was recorded.

Fig. 4(b) shows the styrene oxidation obtained by changing the metal ratio. The inlet styrene concentration, total flow rate, and water content were kept constant at 20 ppm, 10 L/min, and 3%, respectively. At 30 J/L (see Fig. 4(b)), the catalysts B and D exhibited the highest and lowest catalytic activity, respectively. Even though the catalyst B showed the best catalytic activity (achieving the removal efficiency of nearly 92%), it did not achieve 100% removal efficiency at 30 J/L. The energy density achievable without arcing was also limited to 30 J/L with the catalysts B and D (see Fig. 4(a)). With the catalyst C, maximum energy density achieved was 35 J/L, and under this condition, the removal efficiency of styrene was reached 94%. Finally, 100% removal efficiency of styrene was obtained at an energy density of 40 J/L with the catalyst A. With this catalyst, enough energy density and good catalytic activity were obtained to remove 20 ppm of styrene from the diluted air, making it the best catalyst among the catalysts tested. Although the catalytic activity itself was the best for B, the catalyst A having a metals ratio of 8.0:1.0:1.0 was chosen for further study from the viewpoint of overall removal capability.
3.2. Surface morphology
The surface characteristics of the MCM were analyzed using FESEM and EDS, as shown in Fig. 5. The top view of the coated monolith can be seen in Fig. 5(a), which shows that the shape of the rectangular cells only changed slightly after coating with ZSM-5 and metal. The thickness of the coating layer was found to reach a maximum in the corners of the rectangular cells at around 116 µm (Fig. 5(b)). The average thickness of the coating layer in the middle of the cell is approximately 46 µm (Fig. 5(c)). Fig. 5(d) shows the surface morphology of the cell channel, with the deposited ZSM-5 and metal forming a rice-like structure on the monolith channels. The presence of metals was also confirmed using EDS. Fig. 5(e) shows the EDS scan area and Fig. 5(f) shows the map sum spectrum. The three metals namely Co, Pd, and La were also confirmed to exist with the EDS map sum spectrum, and their distribution over the surface can be seen in Fig. 5(g), (h), and (i), respectively. The results for the CMCM catalyst (FESEM, EDS analysis, and metal content analysis using ICP-OES) are available elsewhere [1]. From ICP-OES, the total metal content was found to be 0.23% (Co: 0.1%; Pd: 0.07%; Pt: 0.3%; La: 0.3%) based on the total CMCM weight.

Fig. 6 shows the XRD patterns of the MCM and CMCM catalysts. The XRD patterns of the monolith catalysts were in good agreement with the characteristic diffraction pattern of the cordierite phase. The XRD patterns of both of these monolith catalysts matched those of the cordierite phase (International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) file No. 00–012–0303) [1], [42]. Metals could not be detected in the CMCM catalyst because of the low concentration of metals. A small peak of CoO was detected at 42.3° for the MCM catalyst [43]. The presence of Pd and La was not confirmed using XRD as their concentration is very low compared to that of Co.

3.3. Catalytic activity of the catalysts
Fig. 7(a) shows the adsorption capability of the CMCM and MCM catalysts. The CMCM used γ-alumina as the catalyst support. The γ-alumina has a smaller surface area than the ZSM-5, which resulted in lower adsorption capability than the MCM. The adsorption capacity of the CMCM was determined to be approximately 203 µmol/g. In comparison, the MCM exhibited an adsorption capacity of 310 µmol/g.

Fig. 7. Variation of outlet styrene concentration (a), and thermal catalytic oxidation of styrene as a function of temperature (b) (flow rate: 10 L/min, H2O: 3%, C8H8: 20 ppm).
The catalytic activity of the catalysts was studied using TCO. Fig. 7(b) shows the evolution of the styrene oxidation with temperature for both catalysts. With the CMCM catalyst, the styrene oxidation began at a temperature of 210 °C, and under this condition, only 3% oxidation was found to occur. Oxidation of 100% of the styrene required a temperature of 480 °C. On the other hand, with the MCM catalyst, the styrene oxidation began at 180 °C. The MCM catalyst succeeded in oxidizing 100% of the styrene at a temperature of 420 °C. The TCO results indicated that the prepared MCM catalyst offers better catalytic activity compared with the CMCM catalyst. The main reason for this result was the metal content. As prepared monolith has more metal than that of CMCM, resulting in the higher catalytic activity of MCM.
3.4. Plasma catalytic oxidation of styrene
The decomposition of styrene with the MCM and CMCM catalysts was compared and investigated as a function of the SEI in the PCO process, as shown in Fig. 8(a). A comparison of the removal efficiency between bare monolith, MCM, and CMCM is shown in Fig. S1 with detailed discussion. The SEI of the bare monolith is only 10–12 J/L with poor removal efficiency, and it will not be discussed further. With the MCM, the removal efficiency increased from 44% to 100% when the SEI increased from 20 to 40 J/L. The reason behind this higher oxidation of styrene was mainly due to three important effects; (i) with higher energy density, the plasma was formed more uniformly inside the honeycomb catalyst, (ii) the energetic electron density increased with increasing the energy density, and (iii) the catalytic activity also increases at higher energy density. Higher energy density means that more energetic electrons are created in the plasma, which in turn leads to the increase in temperature as a result of more collisions to form more excited and ionic species [44]. The increase in temperature results in an increase in the catalytic activity, i.e, improved removal efficiency of VOCs. All these effects helped to decompose styrene from 44% to 100% when energy density was increased from 20 to 40 J/L. A similar energy density was applied to decompose styrene using the CMCM catalyst, but the decomposition was not similar. At an energy density of 20 J/L, the CMCM catalyst oxidized 41% of the styrene and, at an energy density of 40 J/L, the oxidation of styrene was found to be 92% complete. At even higher SEI of 45 J/L, the styrene oxidation using the CMCM was 95%. The main reason for this low conversion mainly due to the less catalytic activity of CMCM as the catalytic activity was already studied in the TCO section.

Fig. 8. Plasma catalytic oxidation of styrene as a function of SEI (a), and dependency of styrene oxidation on GHSV (b) (flow rate: 10 L/min, H2O: 3%, C8H8: 20 ppm).
Fig. 8(b) shows the effect of the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) on the oxidation of styrene using both the MCM and CMCM catalysts at a constant energy density and water content of 40 J/L and 3%, respectively. An increase in the GHSV caused the oxidation of styrene to decrease for both catalysts. At 17,000 h-1 GHSV, 100% and 92% of styrene were oxidized using the MCM and CMCM catalysts, respectively. The oxidation of styrene decreased to 77% and 65% when the GHSV increased to 27,000 h-1 with the MCM and CMCM catalyst, respectively. All of these changes are associated with the gas residence time. At constant pressure and temperature, increasing GHSV leads to a decrease in the gas residence time, in other words, the VOC molecules are only exposed to the catalyst for a short time. This short exposure time of styrene molecules to the catalyst surface was the main reason for the decrease in the styrene oxidation.
The CO2 selectivity is a very important parameter of the PCO process as it indicates the effectiveness of VOC removal. Normally, an increase in the CO2 selectivity decreases the formation of unwanted by-products or vice versa. Fig. 9 shows the CO2 selectivity as a function of the SEI using both the catalysts. The selectivity was increased with increasing the SEI for both the MCM and CMCM catalysts. The CO2 selectivity was measured to be 43% and 38% when the SEI was 20 J/L with the MCM and CMCM catalysts, respectively. This selectivity increased for both the catalysts when the SEI was increased; with the SEI of 40 J/L, the CO2 selectivity reached 83% and 75% using the MCM and CMCM catalysts, respectively, which is comparable with the literature [1], [5], [34], [45], [46], [47], [48]. The CO2 selectivity less than 100% means incomplete mineralization due to by-product formations [49]. Liu et al. [50] studied the formation of organic by-products and the related reaction mechanism for styrene and toluene removal using plasma catalytic oxidation, who identified phenol, benzoic acid, and benzaldehyde as by-products. Zhang et al. and Nguyen et al. [51], [52] also reported that several by-products could be formed during the plasma catalytic oxidation of styrene.

Fig. 10 shows the concentration of O3 in the effluent with and without the presence of 20-ppm styrene as well as the gas temperature as a function of the SEI for both the catalysts. In the absence of styrene in the feed gas, the O3 concentration increased from 7 to 24 ppm when the SEI was increased from 20 to 40 J/L using the MCM catalyst. In the SEI range, using the CMCM catalyst, the amount of O3 increased from 9 to 26 ppm. The O3 concentration was almost similar for both catalysts when there was no styrene in the feed gas. However, in the presence of styrene in the feed gas, no O3 was detected at the outlet when using the MCM catalyst. This is obviously because the O3 formed by the plasma was consumed for the oxidation of styrene and its intermediate products. When the CMCM catalyst was used, 3–4 ppm of ozone was detected at the outlet of the reactor in the presence of styrene at an energy density of 40 J/L.

3.5. Difference between two catalysts
The performance of the catalytic activity depends on several parameters such as support material, metal loading, surface morphology, and adsorption capacity. The catalyst support for the CMCM was γ-Al2O3. In comparison, the support for the MCM catalyst was ZSM-5. The reason behind the selection of ZSM-5 over γ-Al2O3 was that (i) ZSM-5 (330 m2/g) has higher surface area than γ-Al2O3 (180–250 m2/g), and (ii) ZSM-5 has better catalytic activity than γ-Al2O3 [52]. Owing to the high surface area, ZSM-5 was able to adsorb more styrene (see Fig. 7). The morphological difference also affected the removal efficiency. Fig. S2 shows the morphology of the surface of the MCM and CMCMs. The MCM catalyst shows the rice-like structure with random gaps between the particles, whereas the CMCM catalyst has no fixed shape and gap between the particles. The rice-like structure and gap between the particles increase the effective surface area and the catalytic activity. Besides, the metal loading in the catalyst is not the same from each other. The CMCM catalyst was composed of four metals as mentioned above while the MCM consisted of three metals. The most expensive but highly active Pt was not used for the MCM. Instead, the amount of Co was increased up to an appropriate level along with Pd and La. The prepared MCM catalyst has more metal loading (0.75%) than the CMCM catalyst (0.23%) based on their total weight. More metal loading provides more active sites, and in turn leads to an increased catalytic activity or an increased oxidation efficiency.
3.6. Spectroscopic studies
To identify the species generated by the plasma, optical emission spectra (OES) (OES, Maya 2000Pro, Ocean optics) were recorded in the presence of styrene. The concentration of styrene, water content, gas flow rate, and applied energy were set to 1000 ppm, 3%, 10 L/min, and 40 L/min, respectively. The OES data were recorded in the range of 200–600 nm for both the catalysts using similar conditions, as shown in Fig. 11. The tip of the optical fiber was 2 cm away from the outer surface of the quartz tube to record the data. The emission spectra were mostly dominated by the N2 species. The
process can be seen from wavelengths 280.2–497.6 nm. The
process can also be seen in the range from 325 to 586.4 nm. We expected to detect O species but owing to system limitations as well as lower energy density, O species could not be detected. OH species were detected at 295.2 and 390.4 nm, indicating their involvement in the oxidation process of styrene, as shown in the inset [28], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57]. The inset figure shows an expansion for improved visibility as these lines overlap with the N2 bands at 296.7 and 394.2 nm. In summary, the excited species from N2 and N2+, as well as the presence of OH radicals in the honeycomb plasma confirm their participation in the oxidation of styrene.

Fig. 12 shows the FTIR spectra of the effluent gas at the outlet of the honeycomb plasma in the presence and absence of plasma. For all the cases, the styrene concentration and gas flow rate were set to 700 ppm and 10 L/min, respectively. In the presence of plasma, the water vapor content and the SEI were set at 3% and 40 J/L, respectively. Dry air was used when taking the styrene spectrum (without plasma), to enable the absorbance peaks to be detected without any disturbance. The narrow peaks at 1495, 1633, and 1820 cm-1 are related to styrene. When the plasma was turned on and water vapor was injected into the reactor, these peaks were no longer visible or overlapped with those of the water. The broad styrene peak from 2967 to 3130 cm-1 can be seen in every case with different intensities. With the plasma turned on and in the presence of catalyst, the intensity of this broad peak decreased and two new peaks namely from 2254 to 2391 cm-1 (CO2) and from 2113 to 2248 cm-1 (CO) appeared. No other peaks were detected on the spectrum of the effluent.

4. Conclusion
In summary, the optimal binder concentration was determined for the robust washcoating of ZSM-5 onto the monolith. Based on the ZSM-5 loading, a maximum of 10% metal can be loaded to obtain the maximum plasma discharge power without arcing. Styrene was successfully oxidized using two different catalysts. The MCM catalyst with an energy density of 40 J/L achieved 100% removal, whereas under the same conditions, the CMCM catalyst successfully removed 92%. The styrene removal efficiency decreased with increasing GHSV. OES was used to demonstrate the generation of OH radicals by the NTP, confirming its involvement in the PCO process of styrene. In the presence of styrene, only 2–4 ppm of O3 was found in the outlet gas when the CMCM catalyst was used, whereas no ozone was detected when the MCM catalyst was used. The CO2 selectivity of was 83% and 75% at an energy density of 40 J/L using the MCM and CMCM catalysts, respectively.
