Water denitration over titania-supported Pt and Cu by combined photocatalytic and catalytic processes: Implications for hydrogen generation properties in a photocatalytic system
The present work provides a new approach to the water denitration process and a facile strategy of catalyst preparation for the efficient hydrogen generation. The main focus of the research reported here was nitrate removal from aqueous solutions and simultaneous hydrogen generation under UV-Vis-light irradiation. This is a very important aspect in case of practical applications, eliminating the external source of hydrogen. Aiming to get a deeper understanding on the role of surface structures (size and shape of nanoparticles) towards the reduction mechanism and to establish basic principles for an efficient process, Pt-Cu/TiO2 and Pt-Cu/TiO2 modified with well-defined Pt nanoparticles were employed. The synthesized materials were characterized using various physicochemical techniques and tested comparatively for: (i) nitrate catalytic reduction by hydrogen (dark reaction) and (ii) nitrate photocatalytic reduction by in-situ generated solar hydrogen. In order to enhance overall denitration reaction by combined photocatalytic and catalytic processes, photo-generated charges and in-situ generated H2 as reducing agent were used. Improvement of catalytic performances of nitrate hydrogenation reaction (~100% NO3¯ conversion) related to intimate contact between Pt and Cu was obtained. The in-situ generated H2 by water splitting over the studied catalysts reduces efficiently NO3¯ ions. Enhanced photocatalytic activity toward solar H2 production by deposited well-defined Pt nanoparticles (~10 nm) was achieved. In order to make possible decontamination of polluted waters using in-situ generated H2 under light exposure, the future optimization of such photo-catalytic systems looks promising.
1. Introduction
Nitrate (NO3¯) can be considered to be one of the most common problems regarding possible contaminants of groundwater. Water-soluble NO3¯ concentrations in the groundwater are rapidly increasing due to excessive fertilization in agriculture, industrial and domestic wastewater. Water pollution with nitrates results in eutrophication and could affect human health through various diseases (blue-baby syndrome, cancer, etc.) [1], [2].
One of the promising technologies capable of reducing NO3¯ to N2 by catalytic hydrogenation of nitrate, have been proposed for the first time by Vorlop et al. [3]. It was reported also [4], [5] the reaction mechanism based on catalytic reduction over bimetallic catalysts using a noble metal (Pd, Pt) and a transition metal (Cu, Sn, In) in the presence of hydrogen as the reductant [6], [7], [8]. Platinum-based catalysts have quite good activity and selectivity for nitrite reduction [9]. To reduce nitrate, it is necessary to activate the precious metal by addition of a promoting second metal [5], [9], [10]. The presence of Cu allows the conversion of nitrate to nitrite, while the further reduction of nitrite to nitrogen or ammonium occurs mainly on precious metal active sites (Pd) [9], [11], [12]. The metals may be present in the form of nanoparticles in order to expose a catalytically more active surface. Loading of TiO2 surface with noble metals such as Pt, Ag, and Au has been investigated from the early times of photocatalysis to increase the photocatalytic activity [13]. Some studies have pointed out the relevance of the structure and geometry of the metal particles in the final mechanism of nitrate reduction [10], [14], [15]. The ability of the (photo) catalytic process to succeed could largely depend on morphology of noble metal deposits (particle size and shape), therefore control of structural properties of metallic nanoparticles is critical to (photo)catalytic performances. Some studies have focused on photochemically produced hydrogen [16] or were concerned with understanding the effect of H2 generation on photoreduction of aqueous nitrate [17], [18].
The present work provides a new approach to the water denitration process and a facile strategy of catalyst preparation for the efficient hydrogen generation. We attempted to improve overall denitration process by using photogenerated charges and in-situ generated hydrogen as reducing agent. This is a very important aspect, because in case of practical application, there is no need for external hydrogen source. The technology becomes widely applicable and the operational costs can be thus reduced significantly. This research aims to tackle nitrate removal from aqueous phase by two approaches: (i) nitrate catalytic reduction by H2 in dark conditions and (ii) nitrate photocatalytic reduction by the in-situ generated solar H2. The present investigation aimed also to get a deeper understanding on the role of surface structures (size and shape of nanoparticles) towards the reduction mechanism and to establish basic principles for an efficient process.
For these purposes, (Pt-Cu)/TiO2 and (Pt-Cu)/TiO2 modified with well-defined Pt nanoparticles were synthesized, characterized using various physicochemical techniques and tested comparatively for nitrate photocatalytic and catalytic reduction reactions. The aim was to favor the selective reduction pathway of nitrate to molecular nitrogen. There are indications that in structure sensitive reactions N-N bond formation rates could be related to preferential orientation of platinum nanocrystal facets [19]. This principle should apply also to nitrate reduction to molecular nitrogen. The idea was to prevent the formation of ammonium ions (NH4+), which is known to be favored by deep hydrogenation of NO3¯ over nanometric sized Pt-Cu nanoparticles.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Catalysts preparation
Two methods of preparation were used: (i) successive impregnation of TiO2 support with metals precursors, and (ii) deposition of well-defined Pt nanoparticles obtained by the preparation procedure described elsewhere [20] onto previously impregnated bimetallic catalyst. In both cases, the calculated copper loading was 0.5 wt%. For comparison purposes, impregnated monometallic catalysts were prepared. The catalysts were prepared with support TiO2 P-25 (Aerosil, Japan, BET surface area 50 m2/g). The metal salts used for impregnation were chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate (H2PtCl6.6 H2O) and copper(II) nitrate trihydrate (Cu(NO3)2.3 H2O).
The first bimetallic catalyst, denominated as (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, was prepared by successive wetness impregnation of TiO2 support with the metals precursors (see Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. Scheme for the preparation of (Pt–Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2.
The desired amounts of Pt and Cu were 1.5 and 0.5 wt%, respectively, corresponding to Pt/Cu molar ratio of 1:1. The salts were dissolved in 0.5 mL water/g catalyst. In a first step, the TiO2 support was impregnated with H2PtCl6.6 H2O, dried at 80 °C for 1 h and then impregnated with Cu(NO3)2.3 H2O. The solid obtained was dried overnight at 80 °C and calcined in air at 400 °C for 2 h.
The second bimetallic catalyst, denominated as Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, was prepared by deposition of well-defined Pt nanoparticles (0.5 wt%) onto (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2. The colloidal Ptnp were prepared following the procedure reported by El-Sayed and coworkers [21]. This method allowed the control of size and shape of Pt nanocrystals [20]. The thermosensitive polymer used to control the structure and growth of the Pt nanocrystals have a triblock copolymer structure and consist in a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) middle block (PEG, Mn ≈4000 Da) and poly(NIPAM-co-TBAM) statistical copolymers as side chains (3 mol% TBAM in the initial monomer mixture), having molecular characteristics as previously described [20], [22]. First, the Pt nanoparticles were prepared by reduction of H2PtCl6.6 H2O precursor (10−4 M) with hydrogen in aqueous media in the presence of thermosensitive polymer (10−3 M). The molar ratio of polymer to metal cation (Pt4+) was 10:1. The reaction vessel was sealed tightly and kept in a thermostatic water bath at 34 °C for 20 h. After that, a certain amount of the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 sample was added to the reaction vessel. After stirring overnight, the homogenized slurry was filtered, dried at 80 °C for 3 h and calcined in air at 400 °C for 2 h to remove the protective polymer.
Additionally, monometallic 1.5 wt% Pt/TiO2 and 0.5 wt% Cu/TiO2 catalysts were also prepared for comparison purposes. The monometallic catalysts were prepared similarly to the bimetallic (Pt–Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst, by wetness impregnation, using H2PtCl6.6 H2O and Cu(NO3)2.3 H2O precursor salts, respectively. The monometallic catalysts will be labeled as Ptimp/TiO2 and Cuimp/TiO2.
2.2. Catalysts characterization
The synthesized (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalysts were characterized using high-resolution microscope, FEI Quanta 3D FEG, equipped with EDS Apollo X detector. The analyses were done in high vacuum mode, at an accelerating voltage of 20 kV with Everhart–Thornley secondary electron detector. Scanning electron micrographs and elemental mappings were obtained at a work distance 10 mm and a magnification factor between 10,000 and 100,000. The morphology, particle size and microstructure were analyzed by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), using a high-resolution microscope FEI Tecnai G2-F30 S-Twin. The particle size distribution was determined from TEM images.
The X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out with SPECS spectrometer with PHOIBOS 150 analyzer, using a non-monochromatic Al Kα radiation source (1486.7 eV) at 300 W. The charge compensation was realized by a flood gun of Specs FG15/40 type. The acquisition was operated at pass energy of 10 eV for the individual spectral lines and 50 eV for the extended spectra.
The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded with a Rigaku diffractometer type Ultima IV in parallel-beam geometry. The diffraction patterns were obtained in the 2θ range between 20° and 80°.
The diffuse reflectance UV-Vis spectra were recorded using a spectrophotometer Perkin Elmer Lambda 35, equipped with integrating sphere. The measurements were carried out at room temperature in the range 200–1100 nm, using spectralon as a reference. The reflectance measurements were converted to absorption spectra using the Kubelka-Munk function, F(R).
Photoluminescence (PL) analysis was performed on a JASCO FP-8300 spectrofluorometer using the 315 nm excitation line of xenon light. The PL spectra were recorded between 325 and 610 nm (100 nm/min scan rate).
Electrochemical measurements were performed with a PAR 273 A potentiostat, in a three-electrode glass cell by using a Ag/AgCl electrode (in saturated KCl) as reference and a platinum gauze as counter electrode. Photoelectrochemical tests at 1.5 AM light (1000 W m−2) were performed by means of a solar light simulator (Peccell-L01, Yokohama, Japan) equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp, in a glass cell provided with a quartz window.
For the electrochemical experiments, (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2/ITO and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2/ITO electrodes were obtained on conductive glass supports (ITO). Before modification, ITO substrates were successively washed in acetone, ethanol, and distilled-deionised water by sonication. 10 μL Nafion solution (5%), 320 μL isopropyl alcohol and 5 mg from each catalyst powder were mixed for one hour under ultrasonic stirring and then, appropriate amounts of the suspension were pipetted on the ITO substrates. Thus obtained working electrodes were dried in air at room temperature and in each case the catalyst loading was adjusted to 1 mg cm−2.
The exposed platinum surface area was estimated by CO pulse chemisorption performed at room temperature using a ChemBet-3000 Quantachrome Instrument equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Prior to CO chemisorption measurements, the catalysts were reduced with H2 at 400 °C for 1 h.
Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were carried out in a flow system with a Chembet 3000-Quantachrome Instruments apparatus equipped with thermal conductivity detectors (TCD). The reduction process was carried out between room temperature and 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 flowing the reducing gas mixture (5% H2 in argon with a flow of 70 mL/min).
2.3. Catalytic performance test
2.3.1. Catalytic hydrogenation of aqueous nitrate solution in dark conditions
The catalysts performance in the reduction reaction of the nitrate ions for the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalysts was evaluated. The monometallic Ptimp/TiO2 and Cuimp/TiO2 catalysts were also tested for comparative purposes. Prior to the catalytic runs, the materials were reduced in H2 at 400 °C for 1 h. The tests were carried out in a catalytic reactor with a capacity of 250 mL, equipped with a magnetic stirrer. In a typical catalytic reaction, 0.1 g of catalyst was added into the reactor containing 200 mL of 100 mg L−1 nitrate (NaNO3) aqueous solution. After 30 min of equilibration time, H2 was bubbled (30 cm3 min−1) into the solution containing the suspended catalyst and nitrate ions. The dark denitration reaction was performed at room temperature (25 °C). 2 mL of the aliquot suspension was periodically withdrawn (at every 30 min), filtered and studied for the progress of the nitrate reduction. The composition of each aliquot was analyzed using an ion chromatography system (Agilent ICS-900). The nitrate (NO3¯), nitrite (NO2¯) and ammonium (NH4+) ions were separated and quantified using the anionic and cationic columns of an ion chromatograph. The pH of the solution was determined by means of a digital pH meter. Three cyclic runs were carried out for selected catalyst in order to assess the stability. The second and the third runs were performed with the quantitative recovery of the catalyst used in previous run, after washing and drying 1 h, at 70 °C.
2.3.2. Photocatalytic nitrate reduction in water
The photocatalytic performance in the reduction reaction of the nitrate ions for the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalysts was evaluated using an immersion well photochemical reactor made of quartz (Photochemical Reactors LTD). 70 mL NO3− solution with the initial aqueous nitrate concentrations of 100 mg L−1 were agitated with the 0.030 g catalyst. The photochemical reactor was inner irradiated with a 125 W medium pressure mercury lamp. The lamp radiates predominantly 366 nm wavelength, as well as in the visible region (404–579 nm) with smaller amounts in the ultraviolet region (265–334 nm). The samples were continuously purged with flow of Ar to eliminate the dissolved oxygen. The concentration of nitrate, nitrite and ammonium in the solution after the photocatalytic reduction was analyzed using ion chromatogram ISC-900 Dionex. Three cyclic runs were carried out for selected catalyst in order to assess the stability. After washing and drying 1 h, at 70 °C, the recovered catalyst was successively subjected to the next run.
The selectivities to nitrite, ammonium, and nitrogen were calculated as ((1), (2), (3)):
(1)
S(NO2¯) = {(C(NO2¯)t / [(C(NO3¯)0 ̶ C(NO3¯)t]} x 100%
(2)
S(NH4+) = {(C(NH4+)t / [C(NO3¯)0 ̶ C(NO3¯)t]} x 100%
(3)
S(N2) = {(C(N2)t / [C(NO3¯)0 ̶ C(NO3¯)t)]} x 100%
where C(NO3¯)0 is the initial nitrate concentration, and C(NO3¯)t, C(NO2¯)t and C(NH4+)t are the residual concentration of nitrate, nitrite and ammonia after reaction for 4.5 h, respectively. The amounts of nitrogen were calculated by a mole balance, which is based on the assumption that no other side products are formed other than nitrite and ammonium.
The produced hydrogen during the photocatalytic reaction was also measured by analyzing the composition of the outlet gas stream every 30 min with a gas chromatograph equipped with TCD detectors (Buck Scientific 910). The H2 was separated and measured quantitatively using molecular sieve 5 Å column.
2.3.3. Photocatalytic water splitting
The photocatalytic water splitting reactions were performed over (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalysts, using the photochemical reactor made of quartz inner irradiated with the 125 W medium pressure mercury lamp at 18 °C (see 2.3.2 section). In a typical run, 0.030 g of catalyst was suspended into 70 mL of pure water. The reactor was bubbled under stirring with Ar (20 cm3 min−1) gas carrier. The composition of the carrier gas was measured every 30 min with a gas chromatograph equipped with TCD detectors (Buck Scientific 910). The hydrogen was separated on MS 5 column and then quantified. The cumulative H2 production data were calculated from the concentration data, assuming ideal-gas behavior. In order to assess the stability, cycled measurements of H2 generation of the selected catalyst were performed.

The SEM micrograph of (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 shows particles with uniform distribution, spherical morphology and slight agglomeration (Fig. 2-a). The SEM micrograph of Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 (Fig. 2-b) shows a higher degree of particles agglomeration.
EDAX provides localized elemental information in case of bimetallic nanoparticles. The presence of Pt and Cu was not directly observable, especially copper, due to the low metals loading on the TiO2 surface. However, EDX mapping (Fig. 2-a, b) and spectra (Fig. 2-a, b, c and d) confirmed the presence of Pt and Cu on the TiO2 surface. EDX quantitative elemental analysis of Pt and Cu in the areas presented in the Fig. 2-a, b gives a Pt/Cu atomic ratio of ~0.4 and 1.0 at% for (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, respectively. The percentage of copper found in the examined area is higher for (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 than that for Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2. The nanoparticles size of the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 was further investigated with TEM analysis.
The catalysts were characterized by TEM in order to evaluate the morphology and the nanoparticles size distribution. The morphology of the nanoparticles in both catalysts is revealed by TEM images shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 for (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, respectively. The particle size-distributions were estimated from TEM images (see Fig. 3 and Fig. 4).

Fig. 4. TEM images and their statistical histograms of Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2.
In the case of the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 sample (see Fig. 3), the particles appear uniformly distributed on the support. The TEM images from Fig. 3 show that TiO2 particles are in good contact with Pt and Cu nanoparticles. The resolution was insufficient to see the crystallographic orientation of the nanoparticles in order to detect the difference between Pt and Cu nanoparticles. The Cu nanoparticles could not be observed on the TiO2 support, probably because of their small size and the small contrast between copper and titania support. With reference to the XRD patterns and CO chemisorption measurements, particles of ca. 1 nm were most likely Pt components and the larger particles of 15–25 nm were postulated as anatase and rutile phase of the TiO2 support. More precisely, the Pt deposits have a narrow size distribution ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 nm with the average size being 1.07 nm (Fig. 3). In the case of calcined catalysts, the TiO2 particles with copper deposition appeared dark against the surface of TiO2.
Deposition of Ptnp on the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst leads to different size and distribution of Ptnp (see for example Fig. 4). The typical structure features of commercial P25 TiO2, consisting of irregularly shaped, ca. 15–25 nm in size crystalline aggregates, was maintained after Ptnp deposition. Regarding the metal species from the TEM image shown in Fig. 4, it is apparent that the Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 sample consisted of two types of Pt nanoparticles, with diameters of ca. 1–2 nm and of ca.7–10 nm, respectively.
The statistical histograms show that the mean diameters of smaller platinum nanoparticles of the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalysts are 1.07 nm (see Fig. 3) and 2.37 nm (see Fig. 4), respectively, which are in a good agreement with the size derived from CO chemisorption measurements. It can be assumed that due to the double calcinations, sintering of Ptnp took place, leading to an increase in their size [23], [24]. The mean diameter of larger Ptnp is 7.3 nm (see Fig. 4). Round-shaped particles of about 7–10 nm are dispersed over the TiO2 support. It is assumed that these are the obtained Ptnp by using the thermosensitive polymer in the preparation method (see 2.1 section).
The surface elemental composition and chemical state of catalytic materials was determined by X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). The XPS spectra evidenced that the elements: Ti, O, Pt, Cu, and C (as a typical contamination) were present on the surface of the TiO2-based catalysts. The surface elements contents (at%) estimated from XPS measurements are presented in Table 1. The results of XPS analysis for Ti, Pt and Cu are compiled in Fig. 5. The binding energies (BE) for decomposed peaks of Ti 2p, Pt 4 f, Cu 3p and Cu 2p core level from the XPS spectra over the reduced (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, Ptimp/TiO2, Cuimp/TiO2 samples and recovered (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 sample after testing the stability in the photodenitration reaction are listed in Table 2.

As shown in Fig. 5 A, all the samples give almost the same Ti 2p spectra with two peaks located at 458.9 ± 0.2 eV and 464.8 ± 0.05 eV, originating from the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 core levels, respectively, corresponding to Ti4+ [25]. Pt 4 f spectra were partially overlapped by the Cu 3p spectra (Fig. 5 B). The (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 sample has the largest half-width of the Ti 2p3/2 (2.14 eV) peak (Fig. 5 A-b). In the other samples it is ~ 1.6 eV and even lower. This shows that there is a specific surface morphology, namely a high local disorder in the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 sample.
For the recovered (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 sample after testing the stability in the photodenitration reaction, the binding energies (BE) values of the doublet 4 f of Pt, 71.92 (4 f7/2) and 75.25 (4 f5/2) eV, are slightly higher than the binding energy of metallic state (Pt0), but lower than that of Pt2+ in ordinary compounds, for example Pt(OH)2 (see Fig. 5 B-a and Table 2) [26], [27]. They are also much smaller than that of the Pt2+ in PtO or PtO2 oxide. Therefore it is possible to have metallic Pt involved in a charge transfer with the surrounding chemical environment. The BE value of the doublet 3p of Cu (Fig. 5 B-a), 74.58 (3p3/2) and 76.88 (3p1/2) eV, respectively indicates metallic state (Cu0). The BE value of the Cu 2p is 933 eV (3p3/2) (Fig. 5 C-a)) and Cu2+ specific shake-up satellites are missing; it can be stated that there is either Cu+ or Cu0 (the binding energies are very close) [28]. A further differentiation of the oxidation state of Cu could not be made due to the overlapping of the Auger Cu LMM peak and the Ti 2 s peak, so that no additional information was obtained. The surface content of Cu for recovered (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 sample decreases compared to (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 from 1.3 at% at 0.9 at%, while the surface atomic percentage of platinum remains the same (see Table 1).
For (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 sample, as in the case of recovered (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 sample, the doublet Pt4f from Fig. 5 B-b, 72.14 (4 f7/2) and 75.47 (4 f5/2) eV indicates a metallic Pt involved in a charge transfer with the surrounding atoms. The doublet 3p of Cu at 74.66 (3p3/2) and 77.03 (3p1/2) eV, respectively seems to indicate its metallic state (Fig. 5 B-b and Table 2).
From XPS spectra of Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 sample (Fig. 5 B-c) can be observed two states of Pt. The higher doublet Pt4f from Fig. 5 B-c, 71.05 (4 f7/2) and 75.35 (4 f5/2) eV indicates the usual metallic state. The other smaller peaks Pt4f from Fig. 5 B-c, with EB 72.35 (4 f7/2) and 75.71 (4 f5/2) eV are attributed to Pt2+ characteristic Pt(OH)2 or Pt0 in a charge transfer. The doublet 3p of Cu at 74.81 (3p3/2) and 77.19 (3p1/2) eV (see Fig. 5 B-c and Table 2), and 2p of Cu at 932.96 eV (Fig. 5 C-c and Table 2), respectively seems to indicate Cu0.
From Pt 4 f spectra of Pt imp/TiO2 sample (Fig. 5 B-d), can be observed three states of Pt. The first higher doublet Pt4f from Fig. 5 B-d at 71.22 (4 f7/2) and 74.74 (4 f5/2) eV indicates metallic state (Pt0). The second largest doublet Pt4f from Fig. 5 B-d at 72.68 (4 f7/2) and 76.08 (4 f5/2) eV indicates most likely Pt2+ characteristic of Pt(OH)2. The lowest doublet Pt4f from Fig. 5 B-d at 74.08 (4 f7/2) and 77.41 (4 f5/2) eV indicates Pt2+ characteristic of PtO oxide.
From XPS deconvoluted spectra of Cu imp/TiO2 sample (Fig. 5 A-e and Fig. 5 C-e), the doublet 3p of Cu at 74.94 (3p3/2) and 77.31 (3p1/2) eV and 2p spectral line of Cu at 932.96 eV, respectively were observed. These values indicate the metallic state of the copper. Starting from 940 eV, shake-up satellites characteristic of the multiple splitting from typical Cu2+ species appear slightly. So there may be traces of slight oxidation of Cu on the surface [26].
Cu2+ is completely missing in bimetallic catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5 C-(a-c), the binding energies of the Cu core line 2p3/2 were centered at about 933 eV, reflecting the presence of Cu0 in the supported bimetallic catalysts [26]. In bimetallic (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalysts, a red-shift of the binding energies of Cu 2p in comparison with monometallic Cuimp/TiO2 catalyst was observed. This change of binding energy of Cu 2p due to valence occupation change in the bimetallic catalyst clearly indicated an intimate contact between Pt and Cu [29]. In addition, especially for (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 sample, a more pronounced local disorder is found and that generates new catalytically active centers which leads to the improvement of the catalytic activity in the reduction reaction.
The crystalline degree and crystal structure of (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 samples were examined by XRD and the obtained diffractograms are shown in Fig. 6.

Fig. 6. X-ray diffraction patterns of (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalysts.
The XRD patterns of both catalysts are essentially similar with pure TiO2, which is composed of anatase (90%) (JCPDS card no. 00–021–1272) and rutile (10%) (JCPDS card no. 01–077–0441) crystalline phases. The average anatase crystalline size is of 15 nm. The rutile phase presents average crystalline sizes of 22 and 15 nm for (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, respectively. No sharp peaks for Pt can be observed in Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, indicating that Ptnp are well dispersed and their crystal size are very small, as observed in the TEM images. No characteristic peaks for Cu or Cu oxides were also detected in (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 or Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 due to their low loading and fine dispersion on the TiO2 surface. However, in case of (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, the small diffraction peak detected at 2θ of 39.8° can be indexed to the (111) reflection of face-centered cubic crystals of platinum (JCPDS card no. 01–087–0640).
3.2. Optical absorption properties of catalysts
The UV–Visible absorption spectra of (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 samples were measured at room temperature in the 200–1000 nm wavelength range. The impregnated Ptimp/TiO2 and Cuimp/TiO2 samples were also measured for comparison purposes. Pure TiO2 was taken as reference sample as depicted in Fig. 7.

The characteristic absorption of the TiO2 support (in the range from 200 to ~400 nm) [30] is dominant in all UV–Vis spectra. This sharp absorption band is attributed to the interband absorption of the original TiO2 [31]. An absorption peak at ~330 nm is present for all samples and is due to electronic transition from O2p to Ti3d. [32]. It can be seen that an apparent red shift of the absorption edge toward the visible light region for the samples containing Pt or/and Cu was achieved in this work.
For Cuimp/TiO2 sample a broad band located at wavelength higher than 600 nm appears and could be attributed to Cu (II) d-d transitions. This indicates the presence of copper in oxidized form, CuO on the titania surface [33], [34]. For Ptimp/TiO2 material an absorption tail in the range from 400 nm to around 600 nm was observed. This absorption could be explained in two ways. First, the absorption could be attributed to the surface plasmon resonance, since spherical nanoparticles of Pt show the characteristic peak absorption at 410 nm. Second, the Pt particles can produce some lower energy levels between valence band and conduction band. Some authors attributed them even to formation of Ti3+ [31], [35].
(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 sample exhibit the same feature as the Ptimp/TiO2 and Cuimp/TiO2, which could be indicate that no supplementary interaction between Pt-Cu or metals-support does not appear. The absorption tail in the 400– 500 nm region was attributed to the presence of Pt and the slight absorption band at wavelengths of 700–800 nm to the Cu d-d transition.
The Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst showed intense absorption at visible and NIR wavelengths, which increased slightly towards shorter wavelengths. The extended absorption is mostly attributed to presence of platinum. This is characteristic for supported Pt nanoparticles. This broad band is more intense, plausibly as a consequence of larger nanoparticles obtained for this sample [36]. A peak around 255 nm is observed corresponding to Pt0 nanoparticles [37]. When the Pt nanoparticles are formed, the absorption peak is shifted towards shorter wavelengths due to the small size of the particles (surface plasmon resonance-SPR of the Pt nanoparticles) [38]. For the Cu, the peak around 260 nm corresponds to Cu2+ ions in solution [39]. After reduction, a peak appears at 580 nm, typical of Cu0 nanoparticles [39]. The samples modified with Cu2+ ions also present a small absorption in the range of 650–800 nm due to their blue-green color.
The localized SPR of platinum nanoparticles typically range between 450 and 550 nm for larger particles [38]. The spectra of the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 show a decrease in absorption with larger wavelengths without any significant plasmon absorption maximum. Only a slight increase of the absorption around 420 nm is observed for Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2.
The energy band gap (Eg) values are determined from reflectance [F(R)] spectra using the Tauc plot [40], [41]. The value of Eg is obtained by extrapolating the linear part of the graphics (αhν)1/η vs hν (where α represent the absorption and hν is the energy of light) to the axis of the abscissa. The calculated band gaps values for the direct transitions (η = 1/2) of (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalysts and TiO2 as a reference are listed in Table 3.

Cuimp/TiO2 3.26
(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 3.26
Ptimp/TiO2 3.23

The energy band gap (Eg) value shifted to 3.26 eV and 3.03 eV for (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, respectively, lower energies than for pure TiO2 (Eg = 3.44 eV). Also, for comparison purpose, the band gap energy values of Ptimp/TiO2 and Cuimp/TiO2 catalysts, prepared similarly to the bimetallic (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst, are presented. In the case of impregnation-made catalysts, the band gap energy did not change much. It is observed the decrease of the energy values in the band gap of TiO2. A more pronounced decrease is observed in the case of samples prepared by depositing Ptnp on the substrate. This analysis reveals that Eg (TiO2) > Eg (Cuimp/TiO2) > Eg ((Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2) > Eg (Ptimp/TiO2) > Eg (Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2). So, the band gap narrowing favored a better photoactivity under visible component of light irradiation.
The room temperature PL emission spectra of the calcined (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 materials excited at 315 nm are displayed in Fig. 8. The corresponding spectra of the calcined Ptimp/TiO2, Cuimp/TiO2 and TiO2 samples are also included therein for comparison.

As can be easily noticed, the spectra of all the Pt and Cu-containing TiO2 follow the pattern of the unloaded TiO2. Thus, the peaks of relatively small intensity at 352 and 402 nm could be due to the photoinduced electron-hole recombination in conduction and valence band of TiO2 [42], while the peaks that appear at higher wavelength might be induced by the defects in TiO2 lattice such as oxygen vacancies and dopants [42]. The reduction of the intensities of the two well defined peaks at 430 and 442 nm suggests a decrease of the recombination rate at the trapping centers. There are several peaks in the blue region as follows: 460 nm (related to surface states), 465 and 470 nm (originating from different oxygen vacancies), 475 nm (emerging either from band edge emission or related to crystalline defects as oxygen vacancies), 484 nm (associated with charge transfer from Ti3+ to oxygen) and 494 nm (due to bound exciton) [42]. A significant decrease in the emission peak is observed with the loading of Pt and Cu onto TiO2 in the following order: TiO2 >Cuimp/TiO2 >Ptimp/TiO2 > (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 >Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2. This indicates that platinum and copper act as trapping centers. Moreover, the presence of both elements, platinum and copper, has enhanced the separation of photogenerated charges. Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 demonstrates the lower intensity PL signal, which means better improvement in charge separation (see Fig. 8). This result shows that deposition of Pt nanoparticles on the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 surface has a significant effect on TiO2 electronic structure.
The photoelectrochemical activity of (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalysts was checked in a 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution, in a potentiodynamic regime (sweep rate, 5 mV s−1) and the results obtained under chopped-light AM 1.5 illumination are shown in Fig. 9.

In both cases photoanodic effects were recorded and it appeared that Pt nanoparticles-modification led to a significant enhancement of the photocurrent (curve 2 in Fig. 9). It is also worthy of note that at above ca. 0.75 V the influence of the light is rather inconspicuous, indicating that, at high anodic potentials, photogenerated charge carriers no longer play a decisive role in the overall electrochemical process. It is reasonable to assume that the much significant photocurrent exhibited by the Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst (better illustrated by the inset in Fig. 9) is not only the result of its more intense adsorption within the visible light range (induced by the narrower band gap) but is also due to the presence of a higher amount of Pt that could act as electron-trapping sites, with beneficial effects on the charge carriers separation efficiency.
3.3. CO adsorption over metal surfaces
The number of active metal sites represents one of the most important parameters of bimetallic catalysts. Both CO chemisorption and electron microscopic measurements were used to determine active Pt site concentrations and particle size distributions, respectively. CO chemisorption can not be used to calculate the average bimetallic particle size since CO uptake provides an estimate only for the Pt component of the bimetallic particles. CO chemisorption can also be used to estimate metal dispersion. The Pt dispersion and particle size as well as other important parameters determined by CO pulse chemisorption are listed in Table 4.
Table 4. The Pt dispersion, the corresponding particle size and the metal surface area obtained from CO pulse chemisorption.

Ptimp/TiO2 39.98 1.93 0.72 – 52.00
Deposition of Ptnp on impregnated (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 sample resulted in marked decrease of the CO chemisorption amount from 33.8 μmol g−1 to 19.08 μmol g−1. There is also a slight decrease of the CO chemisorption amount from 39.98 μmol g−1 to 33.8 μmol g−1, so there is a decrease of the exposure of platinum active centers on the surface, possibly due to their blocking with impregnated copper.
The measurement of Pt dispersion by CO chemisorption shows the highest dispersion of 52% for the Ptimp/TiO2 catalyst (Table 4). Although it showed that the presence of Cu favors the dispersion of Pt species [43], under the present conditions, the Cu addition by impregnation causes a slight decrease of Pt dispersion to 43.96%. The Cu addition may cover a fraction of the platinum surface and lower the metal dispersion [44], [45]. However, in case of (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, the dispersion is quite high compared to the value obtained for the Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst. In the latter case the dispersion decreases dramatically when the platinum is deposited, reaching a value of only 18.61%. The result is in agreement with the observation in TEM images (Fig. 3, Fig. 4) that the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, which has higher Pt dispersion, has also smaller nanoparticles size compared with the Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst.
Decreasing the particle sizes results in improved dispersion and an increase in the number of active sites on the surface of the catalyst. These particle sizes, according to TEM images, are somewhat smaller than that derived from CO chemisorption. The discrepancy could have to do with the assumptions regarding CO adsorption stoichiometry and particle morphology made in the interpretation of the CO adsorption data. With TEM, only a limited number of specimens can be examined [46]. The Pt can be better dispersed on TiO2 than other metals, thus results in smaller particle size on the surface, subsequently more interfaces between supports and Pt clusters for the reactants, enhancing catalytic performances. It is known that bimetallic nanoparticles Pt-Cu with the alloy structure go on surface segregation [47].
3.4. Reduction behavior (H2-TPR)
The reducibility of platinum and copper on (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 freshly calcined bimetallic catalysts was studied with the aid of temperature programmed reduction (TPR). By measuring the consumption of hydrogen (due to the reduction of species in the catalysts) as a function of the temperature a reduction profile is obtained. The TPR measurements provide information on the reduction temperature for the catalysts, as well as whether the presence of two types of platinum nanoparticles changes the reduction temperature of the bimetallic catalysts. Theoretically, the copper content remains the same for the two bimetallic catalysts. The change occurs with regard to the second metal present, namely platinum, both in terms of content and size of nanoparticles.
The H2-TPR profiles of (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, and monometallic Ptimp/TiO2 and Cuimp/TiO2 samples are shown in Fig. 10.

In the case of (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, a sharp reduction peak at 48 °C and a broad reduction peak at 350 °C can be observed (Fig. 10). The H2-consumption peak at around 48 °C was associated to the reduction of PtOx crystallites to metallic Pt, and the peak at around 350 °C could be attributed to the reduction of the surface capping oxygen of TiO2 [48], [49], [50]. The supposed interaction between Pt and Cu has the effect of lowering the temperature at which copper is reduced, giving a main peak of reduction at around 48 °C. This shows the mutual influence of both elements and suggests that Pt and Cu each make the other more reducible.
Two main reduction peaks were also present for Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, a smaller peak at 60 °C and a second higher peak at 277 °C (Fig. 10). The two H2 consumption peaks were observed in the profiles at temperatures below 100 °C and ~300–400 °C, which can be attributed to the reduction of the small Pt nanoparticles and the reduction of the adjacent TiO2 by hydrogen spillover from the Pt nanoparticles, respectively [48]. It is well known that TiO2 is partially reduced to TiO2−x under hydrogen above 500 °; according to the literature [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], this reduction is at the origin of the strong metal support interaction (SMSI) effect. In a reducing atmosphere, the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ starts from about 400 °C.
From TPR profile for Ptimp/TiO2 (Fig. 10), it can be observed that the reduction of Pt species takes place in two main steps: a small reduction peak at ~84 °C and a larger reduction peak at ~278 °C which is attributed to the reduction of platinum oxide nanoparticles of various sizes [56]. The H2-consumption peak at around 84 °C is associated to the reduction of small and highly dispersed surface PtOx nanoparticles according to the Eq. (4).
(4)
PtOx+xH2→Pt+H2O
The second hydrogen consumption peak at 278 °C is assigned to the reduction of bulk platinum species (PtOx and PtO) in larger particles. The percentage of hydrogen consumed indicates that about 8% of PtOx nanoparticles are small and highly dispersed on TiO2 and 92% of PtOx is represented by large nanoparticles that are reduced during the TPR analysis (Fig. 10). It is known that the presence of Pt deposits promotes the reduction of TiO2 via a spill-over of hydrogen from Pt to the supports. Here, the effect occurs at temperatures of 400 °C and represents the reduction of TiO2, resulting in the formation of Ti3+ [57].
The mechanism proposed by Prins et al. [58], [59] suggests that the hydrogen atoms created through dissociative chemisorption of the hydrogen molecule on Pt nanoparticles, migrate over the TiO2 support surface through the spill-over process where they become a combination of protons and electrons. The electrons reduce the reducible cation of TiO2 support (Ti4+/Ti3+) (anionic lattice defects) and the protons bind to the surface oxygen anions surrounding the Ti3+ ions forming OH– (cationic lattice defects). The formation of Ti3+ produces some local electron enrichment on the metal support interface that can lead to an enhancement of the catalytic activity of supported nanoparticles. Titanium dioxide is partially reduced to TiO2−x by hydrogen at high temperatures according to (5), (6).
(5)
(6)
The number of reduced Ti ions is similar to the number of Pt atoms present in the catalyst and therefore, only those Ti cations under and/or surrounding the Pt particles are reduced.
In our case, namely Ptimp/TiO2, considering those mentioned above, the total quantity of Ti4+ reduced calculated from the hydrogen consumption maximum is 3.7% of TiO2 support. According to our calculations, 2.78% of Ti4+ is reduced to Ti3+ and therefore, only 74% of supported Pt promotes the reduction of Ti4+ through the spill-over process (see Table 5).
The hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) profiles carried out on Cuimp/TiO2 catalyst are also presented in Fig. 10. The reduction of Cu species takes place in two steps: a sharp and high reduction peak at ~200 °C and a smaller reduction peak at 428 °C, respectively. The reduction peak centered at ~200 °C is assigned to the reduction of predominantly small and highly dispersed CuO nanoparticles [60], whereas the peak at 400 °C reflects the reduction of bulk copper species (CuO and Cu2O) in larger particles to metallic copper [9]. Also, the low temperature reduction could be interpreted as the result of the TiO2 support enhancing the reducibility of the dispersed copper phase [61]. The minor hydrogen consumption at temperatures above 500 °C could be associated with TiO2 reduction, which shifts towards lower temperatures in presence of copper indicating enhanced reducibility properties of TiO2 interacting with copper species [62].
The quantitative analysis, the calculated H2 consumption of each reduction peak is presented in Table 5. Considering the total reduction of Pt (IV) and Cu (II) oxides, the H2 consumption of each reduction peak and corresponding quantity of copper oxides are calculated: 68% from the first reduction maxim and 32% for the second reduction peak (Table 5). We assume that all Cu is initially oxidized.
In the case of (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, the H2 consumption peak at 48 °C was associated to the simultaneous reduction of CuOx and PtOx species and strongly suggests that a synergetic effect takes place between the component metals [59]. The large hydrogen consumption can be observed for the oxidized (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 on which are fast reduced in the first process (sharp reduction peak) at the low temperature (48 °C). Pt and Cu act like a single compound with their nanoparticles highly dispersed on the support surface. The reduction temperature was much lower than the reduction temperature for pure platinum or copper catalysts, indicating an interaction between the platinum and the copper species, simultaneously reducing at up to 100 °C. Therefore, a greater electron density in Pt (induced by the presence of Cu) can lead to a weakening of the Pt-O bond and reducing more easily [63], [64]. By analyzing the quantitative hydrogen consumption for each of reducible component species (Table 5), it can be observed that only 57% of supported Pt promotes the reduction of Ti through the spillover process.
In the case of Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, the first reduction peak (60 °C) corresponds to the reduction of small PtOx nanoparticles interacting with the support. The second reduction peak (277 °C) corresponds to the simultaneous reduction of the large PtOx nanoparticles and of copper species not interacting with platinum. Unlike the previous sample, namely (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, the introduction of large Pt nanoparticles in the synthesis process leads to an increase in the reduction temperature of Pt species. As shown in the Fig. 10, the H2-TPR profiles carried out on Ptimp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 have a similar shape, with a small and broad reduction peak at 84 °C and 60 °C, respectively and a higher reduction peak at ~278 °C, which can be explained by the reduction of surface small platinum oxide nanoparticles and reduction of platinum species in larger particles, respectively.
The supposed interaction between Pt and Cu has the effect of reducing CuO to metallic copper and Cu2O, which is observed in the TPR profile of (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 samples. The differences observed between the reduction behaviour of the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 samples show that the increase in the amount of large Pt nanoparticles is associated with the strength of the Pt-support interaction. This fact is also observed due to the decreasing dispersion in CO chemosorption.
3.5. Catalytic and photocatalytic tests
3.5.1. Catalytic hydrogenation of aqueous nitrate solution in dark conditions
The major challenge for the implementation of catalytic systems to remove nitrates from water is to suppress the formation of nitrites and ammonia (byproducts). In order to evaluate the support effect, the SMSI impact, and the interactions between platinum and copper on dark catalytic denitration reaction, we investigated the denitration performance of bimetallic catalysts dispersed in aqueous nitrate solution. The monometallic catalysts were also studied for comparative purposes. First a blank experiment was performed without hydrogen bubbling in dark conditions by using the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 sample, but no significant catalytic activity was exhibited in the removal of nitrate from the aqueous solution within 4 h of reaction. The evolutions of nitrate, nitrite and ammonia ions concentrations and pH of the solution in nitrate reduction experiments in dark conditions with hydrogen bubbling in presence of (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, Ptimp/TiO2 and Cuimp/TiO2 catalysts are plotted as a function of time in Fig. 11.

The concentrations of the nitrate (a), produced nitrite (b) and ammonium (c), and pH (d) of the solution as a function of the reaction time over Ptimp/TiO2, Cuimp/TiO2, (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalysts. Reaction conditions: catalyst weight, 0.1 g; temperature, 25 °C; reactant, NO3¯, 200 mL; H2.
(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 has a better ability in nitrate removal. Production of nitrite or ammonia in drinking water as secondary product is undesirable. Although in the first 90 min the nitrate is almost completely removed (Figs. 11-a), 53.97 mg L−1 of NO2¯ (Figs. 11-b) and 9.82 mg L−1 of NH4+ (Fig. 11-c) are finally obtained. Fig. 12 shows nitrate conversions X(NO3¯) for (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptimp/TiO2 in dark denitration reaction in the presence of H2. Almost 100% nitrate conversion was reached within 150 min for (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst (Fig. 12).

In case of Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, even after 270 min, about 76.6 mg L−1 of NO3¯ (Fig. 11 a) remain unreacted, NO3¯ conversion being ~ 23% (Fig. 12). As byproducts, ~6 mg L−1 of NO2¯ and ~3 mg L−1 of NH4 + were obtained within 120 min, their values slowly rising to the final values of 6.6 mg L−1 of NO2¯ (Fig. 11 b) and 4 mg L−1 of NH4+ (Fig. 11 c).
During the nitrate reduction experiments in dark, the pH of the aqueous nitrate solution is measured (Fig. 11 d). The process pH directly affects the particle surface charges. In general, the isoelectric point or the point of zero charge (PZC) of TiO2 P25 lies between pH 6–7. The increase of pH is due to the increase of the negative surface charge, by the formation of OH¯ groups [65] and NH4+. The unwanted formation of ammonium is higher in the case of (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 compared to Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptimp/TiO2.
As shown in Fig. 11, the bimetallic (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst exhibit better catalytic nitrate reduction performance compared with corresponding monometallic Ptimp/TiO2 and Cuimp/TiO2 catalysts. The reduction of nitrate is quite different depending on the preparation conditions for the Pt-Cu catalysts, but it also depends on the combination of metal species on the surface (Fig. 11, Fig. 12 and Table 6). The Cuimp/TiO2 has no activity in the dark denitration reaction. This could be explained by a surface oxidation of copper in contact with air, leading to CuOx species.
To study the stability of the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst three cyclic runs were carried out. Each run lasted for 240 min. The variation of the nitrate concentrations expressed in mg L−1 is presented in Fig. 13. The nitrate conversion decreases slightly from 99.7% to 97.9%. After three cycles, only small change in activity can be detected, suggesting a good chemical stability of the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 sample.

Fig. 13. Nitrate reduction in dark conditions on (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 in three consecutive cycles.
In case of the Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst, the deposition of Pt nanoparticles (0.5 wt% theoretical loading) has unfavorable effect over the nitrate conversion. This decrease in NO3¯ conversion suggests that Pt is mainly deposited on the Pt-Cu nanoparticles, thus decreasing the number of active sites available. The platinum sites are necessary first to maintain copper in a metallic state and second to reduce intermediate nitrite. However, the final nitrite concentration for Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 has a much lower value compared to that obtained with (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst (Fig. 11 b). This could be an indication that the formation of active sites for NO2¯ reduction is more pronounced in the Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalysts. According to the TEM analysis in the case of Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 (Fig. 4), two different types of nanoparticles are observed, in terms of size and surface arrangement. It was shown that nitrite reduction occurs principally on noble monometallic sites [9]. The impregnated (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst is less selective to nitrogen (Table 6) compared to Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptimp/TiO2.
It has been shown [9], [66] that metallic copper could reduce nitrate and nitrite, according to a redox process, but deactivate rapidly since copper was passivated to form CuO or Cu2O in the water. In this way, it is assumed that the first stage of the denitration reaction is probably a redox reaction between metallic Cu and NO3¯ ions that leads to NO2¯ ions and to an oxidized form of copper. It can also be assumed that the NO3¯ ions are first reduced to nitrite ions (NO2¯) on the bimetallic Pt-Cu surface (Eq. 7). The supposed interaction between Pt and Cu is observed in the TPR profile of (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 samples (Fig. 10). The interaction between Pt and Cu seems to be more stronger in case of (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst. Thus, the oxidized copper is reduced again by the adsorbed hydrogen on Pt to metallic Cu.
(7)
Then, NO2¯ is reduced to NH4+ and N2. The distribution of Pt and Cu in the bimetallic particles could dictate the selectivity in the latter step. In case of Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptimp/TiO2 catalysts, in which platinum atoms predominate, NO2¯ is preferentially reduced into N2.
3.5.2. Photocatalytic nitrate reduction with the in situ-generated H2
We attempted to improve overall denitration process by using photogenerated charges and in situ generated hydrogen. In the absence of an organic hole scavenger we can expect an undesirably high level of nitrites obtained, so the presence of Pt which could ensure both the dissociation of H2 and the reduction of NO2¯ [7] becomes necessary to improve the photocatalytic performance. For the Pt-Cu-modified TiO2 photocatalysts, photogenerated electrons in the TiO2 should be transferred to the metal particles on the TiO2 surface, where they then reduce NO3¯ with H+, which are adsorbed on the surface of the metal particles [67]. According to this mechanism, the metals particles should be able to do this photogenerated electron transfer easily and to selectively activate NO3¯ and H+. Nitrate reduction and photocatalytic hydrogen evolution were simultaneously examined over (Pt-Cu)imp and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp deposited on TiO2. In order to explore the TiO2 support effect, photodenitration test under irradiation of UV-Vis light for 240 min by using the TiO2 sample calcined at 400 °C for 2 h were performed initially. No significant catalytic activity was found in terms of nitrate conversion, after 4 h of reaction.

The concentrations of the nitrate (a), produced nitrite (b) and ammonium (c) as a function of the reaction time under irradiation of UV-Vis light over (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalysts. Reaction conditions: catalyst weight, 0.030 g; temperature, 18 °C; reactant, NO3¯, 70 mL; Ar, 20 cm3 min−1; 125 W medium pressure Hg irradiation lamp.
In the case of (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, at the beginning of photocatalytic reaction can be observed that the concentration of nitrate decreased quite rapidly (Fig. 14 a), reaching the final value of ~13 mg L−1, but nitrite is also formed as quickly (Fig. 14 b), while only trace of ammonium appeared in solution (Fig. 14 c). For Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst, the photoreduction of nitrate occurred rapidly up to 120 min, after which the nitrate concentration slowly decreases to the final value of ~50 mg L−1. The same tendency is observed in the evolution of the nitrite and ammonium concentration, which stabilizes after 120 min at the values of ~45 and ~1 mg L−1, respectively.

Fig. 16. Nitrate photoreduction on (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 in three consecutive cycles.
As can be seen from Fig. 16, the catalyst performance is less affected in terms of nitrate conversion between the three cycles. The nitrate conversion decreases slightly from 86.8% to 82.4%. After three cycles, only small change in activity can be detected, suggesting a good photochemical stability of the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 sample, at least for the present reaction time. The stability of the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst was assessed by determining the amount of platinum and copper leached from the catalyst during the nitrate photoreduction by XPS analysis (see Table 1). There is no platinum leaching, and copper decreases slightly, probably by dissolving in aqueous solution (see Table 1). Therefore, it could be considered that the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst has a good stability in photocatalytic denitration reaction.
Table 7 presents the values of nitrate conversion and of nitrite, ammonium, and nitrogen selectivity of (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalysts after 4.5 h of photo-denitration reaction under irradiation of UV-Vis light.

For the denitration tests carried out under irradiation of UV-Vis light for 270 min the selectivity toward molecular nitrogen was poor, the main product of the nitrate reduction being the nitrite (Table 7). Almost 50% nitrate conversion was reached within 60 min for (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst, while the Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 reaches this value only after 270 min (Fig. 11). The nitrate conversion decreased almost twice after platinum deposition (Table 7). The influence of Pt on TiO2 photocatalysis is not always positive. Several groups have observed either negative effects or no significant impact from nanoparticles of Pt on TiO2 [68]. For example, Emilio et al. [69] showed that Pt particles on TiO2 could act as charge recombination centers. It has been reported that noble metal clusters such as Pd, Pt, and Ag of appropriate amount or size can efficiently trap the photoinduced electrons [70], [71], [72], [73]. In other cases, authors proposed that Pt blocked active sites on TiO2 [74]. However, metal coating will usually cause some new problems, resulting in a decrease in photocatalytic ability. One is the coverage and occupation of some semiconductor surfaces, decreasing the photoinduction efficiency; the other is that particle that are too large will become new recombination centers of photogenerated electrons and holes [75], [76], [77], [78].
Nitrates were rapidly reduced on the Pt−Cu bimetallic catalyst when both metals were in close contact [9]. Different platinum dispersions with respect to supports seem to be ascribed to strong metal-support interaction (SMSI), i.e. with increased SMSI, the particle size of the metal decreases and, consequently, the activity of corresponding catalyst increases [79], [80], [81], [82]. These results indicate that the smaller particle size of platinum, due to its higher dispersion on the support, results in forming a platinum surface phase, which has a positive effect on catalytic activity. The decrease in activity at larger particle sizes is to be expected, since too large particles, although possessing the appropriate crystal faces, possess too little Pt surface area [46].
Preview paper show that after illumination by a UV source, the adsorption of photons by TiO2 leads to the photo-generated electrons and holes. The photo-generated electrons are partly transferred to the metal particles (Pt, Cu or Pt-Cu). The electrons from metal particles mediate the reduction of protons into atomic hydrogen. Atomic hydrogen can follow two paths: i) it can recombine, thus generating hydrogen gas which is then desorbed or ii) participate in the nitrate reduction reaction, in the adsorbed phase [83]. The NO3¯ is reduced by the adsorbed hydrogen on Pt-Cu produced by the photoreduction of water under UV light irradiation (Eq. 8).

where h is the Planck’s constant and ν is the frequency of the radiation.
TiO2 in water generates reactive species (•OH radicals, O2- superoxide, OH¯, etc.) when irradiated with UV light. These reactive species can play important roles in the photocatalytic reaction mechanisms [84]. A significantly higher photoreduction of nitrate in water for (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 compared to that obtained for Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 could indicate that hydroxyl radicals hinder nitrate reduction, favouring nitrite reoxidation. The photogenerated electrons either reduce the nitrate or reduce the protons to produce H2, which eventually may reduce the nitrate [16].
The cumulative amount of H2 obtained in the photocatalytic denitration test under irradiation of UV-Vis light for the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalysts is presented in Fig. 17.

Fig. 17. Cumulative amount of generated H2 in the photocatalytic denitration test under irradiation of UV-Vis light over (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalysts. Reaction conditions: catalyst weight, 0.030 g; temperature, 18 °C; reactant, NO3¯, 70 mL; Ar, 20 cm3 min−1; 125 W medium pressure Hg irradiation lamp.
The rate of H2 evolution on the Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 was about 0.06 mmol h−1 gcat−1. There was no hydrogen formation with (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 in presence of NO3¯ ions. Two hypotheses have been advanced: either hydrogen is not generated or hydrogen is produced but consumed in the reduction of nitrate. As we shall see later on, the absence of H2 when (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 is used as catalyst is due to H2 consumption by reaction with NO3¯. This result is indicative that photogenerated H2 can be efficient reductant when the catalyst is able to activate H2. On the other hand, the Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 hydrogenation activity should be low, explaining the poor performance for NO3¯ reduction. The electrons were consumed to a greater extent for the H2 evolution (Fig. 17), because Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 is much less active for NO3¯ reduction. For (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, H2 was not detected in the gas phase at all, so it is assumed that all electrons were consumed to reduce NO3¯. It is visible that H2 was generated (Fig. 17) by a photocatalytic reaction over Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 (Eq. 9), and the formed H2, which was dissolved in aqueous nitrate solution, was used as a reductant for non-photocatalytic reduction of NO3¯ over both (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalysts.

It seems that the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst has the ability to use all the generated hydrogen to reduce nitrate, according to the (10), (11), (12):
(10)
NO3¯+5/2 H2→1/2 N2+2 H2O+OH¯
(11)
NO3¯+4 H2→NH4++H2O+2OH¯
(12)
3NO3¯+2 H2→3NO2¯+H2O+2OH¯
A low selectivity to ammonium ions is observed, especially in the case of the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst. Formation of undesirable NH4+ was suppressed to a low level (0.16% and 2.20% selectivity for (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, respectively). Unfortunately, as a result of the nitrate reduction reaction, an unwanted process takes place, the nitrate is largely converted into nitrites, with a higher affinity in the case of the Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst.
3.5.3. The photocatalytic activity for hydrogen generation under UV-Vis light irradiation in absence of NO3¯ ions
In order to evaluate the in-situ hydrogen production directly on the active sites of the catalyst we investigated the photocatalytic performance of bimetallic (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalysts for water splitting.
Photocatalytic water splitting consists of water decomposition into hydrogen and oxygen by reaction with photogenerated charge carriers. The width of the band gap and levels of the conduction and valence bands are important in the absorption process of photons to form electron–hole pairs. TiO2 modified with co-catalysts becomes active for water splitting. Then, crystallinity and particle size could influence to some extent the charge separation and migration of photogenerated carriers. And last but not least, the important points for the surface chemical reactions are active surface sites, surface area and the change in surface morphology. In general, H2 production from photocatalytic water reduction mainly occurs trough the reduction of H+ on active sites having added photoelectrons and the oxidation of a sacrificial agent on active sites enriched with photoinduced holes. A metal presence on the TiO2 surface can induce the transfer of photoexcited electrons from theTiO2 to the metal.
Fig. 18 summarizes the H2-generation curves obtained in the photocatalytic test for water splitting under irradiation of UV-Vis light for (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalysts.

Fig. 18. Cumulative amount of generated H2 in the photocatalytic test for water splitting over (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalysts. Reaction conditions: catalyst weight, 0.030 g; temperature, 18 °C; reactant, H2O, 70 mL; Ar, 20 cm3 min−1; 125 W medium pressure Hg irradiation lamp.
The rate of H2 production was taken as the slope of the straight lines of the produced amount (normalised per unit catalyst weight) vs. irradiation time plots. The obtained rate value of H2 production in the case of Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, are higher than that obtained in the case of (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2. This higher activity of the Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 photocatalysts (0.14 mmol H2 h−1 gcat−1) can be related to the positive role of the amount of noble metal. Higher amounts of hydrogen were produced after Pt deposition indicating the loading of Pt is necessary in increasing the possibility of taking over the photogenerated electrons, because Pt is an effective electron acceptor. The excited electrons from the valence band to the conduction band can migrate to Pt nanoparticles and then react with H+ ions adsorbed to form H2. The Pt nanoparticles on TiO2 surface produce a Schottky barrier, which facilitate the electron capture. Photogenerated electrons are effectively accumulated on Pt nanocrystal particles without recombining with holes [85]. In this way an enhancement of the photocatalytic activity in H2 production could take place [86], [87], [88].
Fig. 19 shows that (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 has also a good stability in cycled measurements of H2 generation in water splitting under irradiation of UV-Vis light after a reaction time of 12 h.

The H2 production was more favored with Pt nanoparticles deposition and seems to be sensitive to surface morphologies of Pt nanoparticles. This is due to the different mechanism which implies charge separation within TiO2 followed by electron trapping at surface Pt and Cu sites, the first being most abundant in catalyst Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2. It can be assumed that electrons/holes are generated deeper in the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 photocatalyst particle and do not contribute to the surface reactions.
On the other hand excessively small particles that were observed from the characterizations of TEM and chemisorption of CO for (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 had a weaker optical absorption compared to Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and could be richer in surface defects that promote recombination. Pt particles act as a Schottky barrier that traps photoelectrons and as active sites for the generation of H2. In this way, the number of surface Pt atoms should influence the photocatalytic performance of the catalysts. According to TPR (Fig. 10), (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 could be reduced at a lower temperature than Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2. This result showed that the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst had a higher electron density than Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2. However, further addition of Pt nanoparticles on (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 enhance the H2 evolution rate. The number of photons absorbed by the reaction system increased with an increase in the amount of Pt, resulting in an increased H2 evolution rate. Modifying the rate of the surface trapping reactions may play an important role in the efficiency of TiO2 for photocatalytic production of H2 [89]. Usually, the reactions are carried out in the presence of electron donors (sacrificial agents), but having no sacrificial agent here, platinum could lead to the accumulation of photo-generated electrons on the catalyst surface for its reaction with H+, leading to the formation of H2. Presence of metal ions influences the surface electronic characteristics of TiO2. As observed in XPS analysis, both (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 and Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 samples present metallic state of Pt and Cu elements on the surface. Platinum appears also to be involved in a charge transfer with the surrounding atoms. This charge transfer is much more pronounced in the case of Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 sample. Furthermore, Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 show Pt2+ characteristic state for Pt(OH)2 compound. This information could explain the enhanced photocatalytic activity for H2 generation.
Following the performed experiments and the obtained results, the advantage of using bimetallic catalysts can be emphasized. Compared to monometallic catalysts, bimetallic catalysts have been shown to enhance the separation of photogenerated charges as evidenced by the PL tests. TPR measurements suggest also that Pt and Cu each make the other more reducible with beneficial effect on the results obtained in catalytic and photocatalytic reactions. XPS analysis shows that platinum and copper appears to be in a low oxidation state, probably metallic state, the platinum being involved in a charge transfer with the surrounding atoms. In this way a synergistic effect was observed between the component metals for the bimetallic catalysts.
Table 8 shows some comparative catalytic performance results of the studied catalysts with other catalytic systems reported in the literature, although an accurate comparison is difficult because of different experimental conditions.

Given that the studies in this research were performed without the use of an organic hole scavenger, our future research aims at optimizing the photocatalytic system. The research of such a system for future possible applications for hydrogen production using sunlight and water as the hydrogen source can also be considered.
4. Conclusions
The point ideas established from the present research are as follows:
(1)
Overall denitration reaction improvement by combined photocatalytic (responsible for the in-situ H2 generation) and catalytic (accounting for reduction of nitrate by H2) processes, using photogenerated charges and in-situ generated H2 as reducing agent has been achieved.
(2)
Improved catalytic performance is related to intimate contact between Pt and Cu. Almost 100% nitrate conversion was attained within 150 min over the (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst in the catalytic reduction of nitrate in water with externally supplied hydrogen.
(3)
It has been found that the in-situ generated H2 by water splitting over the studied catalysts reduces efficiently nitrate ions. The efficient denitration photocatalysts are i) able to produce solar H2 by water splitting and ii) active to catalyze “dark” nitrate reduction with H2.
(4)
(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst has the ability to use all the in-situ generated H2 to reduce nitrates by the photocatalytic reaction. The (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst exhibits in the photocatalytic water nitrate reduction with the in-situ generated H2 a better conversion of nitrate compared to that obtained for Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2. XPS analysis shows that Pt and Cu are most likely in a low oxidation state, namely the metallic state, the platinum being involved in a charge transfer with the surrounding atoms. The synergistic effect observed between the component metals and a more pronounced state of local disorder can generate new catalytically active centers which lead to the improvement of the photocatalytic activity in the reduction reaction.
(5)
The photocatalytic activity toward solar H2 production is enhanced when well-defined Pt nanoparticles are deposited onto (Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2, obtained priorly by impregnation method. UV-Vis analysis revealed the decrease of the energy values in the band gap for this sample. The decrease of the band gap could contribute to a better photoactivity under visible component of light irradiation. The control of Pt nanoparticles deposition on support has been important for the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity. Ptnp-(Pt-Cu)imp/TiO2 catalyst with deposited Pt nanoparticles hindered ammonium formation.
The future optimization of such photocatalytic systems looks promising for possible decontamination of polluted waters and green energy production.
