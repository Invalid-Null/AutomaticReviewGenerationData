Promoted Activity of Surface Hydroxyls on γ-Al2O3 Mineral Dust with the Coexistence of SO2 and NH3
Abstract
Sulfate and ammonium formed on mineral dust can be mutually accelerated through the heterogeneous reactions of coexisting SO2 and NH3. However, little is known about the underlying mechanism, especially the pivotal reactive sites. Using combined Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations, the results show that, compared to that of SO2 or NH3 alone on the γ-Al2O3 surface, the increased level of formation of sulfate and ammonium can be attributed to the promoted activity of the surface-bridged hydroxyl with the coexistence of SO2 and NH3. In the specific mechanism, the O and H of the surface-bridged hydroxyl group are attacked by the adjacent SO2 and NH3, respectively, which directly enhances the formation of absorbed sulfite and ammonium, and indirectly facilitates the production of sulfate by oxidation of atmospheric O2. The proposed mechanisms can be broadly applied to other aluminum-based suspended dust particles, such as kaolinite, montmorillonite, and clay dust.

In recent years, China’s air quality has been improving rapidly upon implementation of strict emission control policy. (1−4) However, the annual average fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in many megacities are still much higher than the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline (5 μg/m3). (5,6) In PM2.5, sulfate (SO42–), nitrate (NO3–), and ammonium (NH4+) have always been the predominant inorganic constituents, often accounting for >50% of PM2.5 mass during haze events. (3,7,8) With the remarkable decrease in SO2 emission, the level of particulate SO42– has been obviously decreased. (3,7,8) However, interestingly, the decreased rate of SO42– concentration is much lower than that of SO2, indicating our knowledge of the mechanism of formation of particulate SO42– is incomplete, although extensive studies have been performed. (9) Contrary to SO42–, NH4+ has increasingly contributed to the PM2.5 concentration because of considerable NH3 emission in China. (7,10−12) Moreover, researchers found that an increased NH3 concentration can accelerate SO42– formation via homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions; in turn, the increase in SO2 concentration can also improve the formation of NH4+. (13−17) Therefore, an investigation of the coupling relationships between SO2 and NH3 is vital to understanding the mechanisms of formation of PM2.5 and providing a coupling control strategy for the key precursor pollutants.
Particulate SO42– can be formed through the homogeneous and heterogeneous oxidation of SO2 by various oxidants (OH radical, Criegee intermediates, H2O2, NO2, O3, etc.). (18−24) Particulate NH4+ is derived from gas-to-particle conversion of NH3 and can be viewed as the product of the neutralization of acidic components by NH3. (10,11,25) Modeling studies have shown that SO42– and NH4+ concentrations during heavy haze events were greatly underestimated (54.2% and 58.1%, respectively) considering only the homogeneous and aqueous oxidation pathways, while this discrepancy can be significantly reduced when the heterogeneous processes are incorporated into the models. (13) This indicated that heterogeneous media play a vital role in identifying the missing sources and understanding the mechanisms of formation of PM2.5. As one of the most abundant heterogeneous media in the troposphere, mineral dust (1000–3000 Tg/year) displays a lifetime of up to several weeks and thus can be transported over long distances of thousands of kilometers. (14) These features create very favorable conditions for heterogeneous transformation of multipollutants into secondary particles on temporal and spatial scales. Although many studies involving heterogeneous reactions on mineral dust have been performed, (26−30) few studies have paid attention to the coupling relationships of SO2 and NH3 on mineral dust except for those of He et al. (15−17) Interestingly, they found that, compared to the individual reaction of SO2 or NH3 on γ-Al2O3, the reactions of coexisting SO2 and NH3 contribute to the increased level of formation of SO32–/HSO3–, SO42–, and NH4+, (15−17) in which surface hydroxyls, defects, and surface reactive oxygen species on mineral dust are expected to be the active sites for SO2 and NH3 uptake. (14,31−39) However, a detailed mechanism and a quantitative description of thermodynamic and dynamic properties are difficult to determine straightforwardly by laboratory experiments, although they are the essential issues for understanding the synergistic phenomenon. In contrast, theoretical calculations are a powerful tool for illustrating the heterogeneous pathways and activation barriers at the molecular level. (31,33,40−44)
It is well-known that when a surface is created, coordination breaks and the dangling bonds appear at the surface. Thus, the perfect surface is usually unstable and surface reconstruction or adsorption of adsorbates in surroundings commonly occurs to minimize the surface free energy. The final stable surfaces could be quite different from that of the perfect one. However, despite often being overlooked, verifying the stability of the initial models in the beginning of theoretical calculations is important, because only reasonable initial models can ensure real results to provide an actual explanation for the experiment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first computational research to validate the rationality of the initial structures at the beginning of simulations in the atmospheric field. Here, using Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations, (45) we first illustrate the stability of the perfect, hydroxylated, and defect γ-Al2O3 surfaces to examine the stability of the γ-Al2O3 surface model and screen the stable one. Then, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, (46) we present molecular insight into the synergistic mechanism for the heterogeneous reaction of SO2 and NH3 on the γ-Al2O3 surface, aiming to elucidate the active sites, key intermediates, and synergistic formation pathways of SO32–/HSO3–, SO42–, and NH4+ on aluminum-based suspended dust particles. As the second most abundant constituent of mineral dust, Al2O3 (α-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3) comprises nearly 15% by mass of the total dust burden in the atmosphere. (14) The γ-Al2O3 model is selected here because of its large surface area, superior chemical properties, and superior thermal stability and is widely used as a proxy to explore the heterogeneous reactions of pollutant gases in a series of experimental studies. (14,33,42,43)
Numerous experimental studies found the (110) surface predominates with >70% of the total surface area of γ-Al2O3; (36,47,48) thus, the termination of the (110) surface is simulated in this study. In Figure 1a and Movie S1, for the perfect γ-Al2O3 (110) model, the top Al atoms are located at the surface in the initial structure. With Al10 as an example, the offset distance of Al atoms at the surface gradually increases over time and reaches 2.01 Å within a short simulation time of 1.00 ps. As a result, the top Al atoms at the surface from the original location move away from the surface and seem to diffuse into the vacuum, indicating that the perfect γ-Al2O3 (110) surface is highly unstable. It is easy to understand that dangling bonds are created with a high energy for the artificially cleaved γ-Al2O3 (110) surface. Thus, the surface reconstruction phenomenon lowers the high surface energy. For the hydroxylated and defect γ-Al2O3 (110) surfaces, the situations are totally different (Figure 1b,c and Movies S2 and S3). During the simulation, the offset distance of Al atoms at the surface is very small and always fluctuates from approximately −0.2 to 0.3 Å. At 10.0 ps, both structures persist, which illustrates the thermodynamic stability of both hydroxylated and defect surfaces is higher than that of the perfect one. Thus, it is reasonable to adopt hydroxylated and defect γ-Al2O3 (110) models but not the perfect surface as references for our research.

Previous experimental studies report that, when γ-Al2O3 is exposed to SO2, sulfite/bisulfite can be observed even in small amounts (Figures S1 and S2). (15) We, thus, explored their corresponding mechanisms of formation using periodic DFT calculation starting from five different adsorption configurations of SO2 on γ-Al2O3 (110) surfaces in Figure 2. Sulfite can be directly formed from the adsorption of SO2 on a reactive oxygen site (Figure 2a), in which the S atom in SO2 bonds to the surface reactive oxygen and the O atom in SO2 interacts with coordinatively unsaturated Al. The extremely negative adsorption energy (−2.22 eV) indicates a strong interaction between SO2 and reactive oxygen, which is mainly attributed to the high activity of surface reactive oxygen. Panels b1 and b2 of Figure 2 depict the physical adsorption of SO2 on surface hydroxyl group sites, in which the O atom in SO2 interacts with the adjacent H atom in the hydroxyl group to form a hydrogen bond and the S atom interacts with the adjacent O atom in another hydroxyl group by electrostatic binding. The corresponding adsorption energies for the weak interactions described above are −0.19 and 0.11 eV, respectively. Then, starting from the two structures described above, we further explore the pathways of formation of surface sulfite and bisulfite from the reaction of SO2 with surface terminal hydroxyl groups (Figure 3a,b). These reactions proceed via a hydrogen transfer mechanism; that is, an oxygen atom in a terminal hydroxyl group is attracted by SO2, and simultaneously, the hydrogen atom in this terminal hydroxyl group is transferred to the oxygen atom in the adjacent terminal hydroxyl group, which eventually leads to the formation of absorbed sulfite (Figure 3a) with H2O or bisulfite (Figure 3b) with a terminal OH group. The formation of sulfite occurs by a transition state with a low barrier of 0.17 eV (Figure 3a), and the formation of bisulfite is barrierless (Figure 3b). Both processes are exothermic by −0.37 eV, indicating that the formation of sulfite and bisulfite from the reaction between SO2 and surface terminal hydroxyl groups is both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable. Thus, the calculated results presented above provide perfect explanations for the experimental findings such as obvious negative signals for the consumption of terminal hydroxyl groups (3737 cm–1) and positive signals at 1080 and 964 cm–1 related to the formation of sulfite/bisulfite (Figures S1 and S2).

For the sake of clarity, the atoms that are not directly involved in the reactions are displayed as line models.
Moreover, to further confirm whether the formation of sulfite and bisulfite is also possible by the same mechanism involving surface-bridged hydroxyl groups, the reaction between SO2 and bridged hydroxyl groups is explored starting from the structures depicted in panels c1 and c2 of Figure 2. At first, SO2 is chemisorbed on the coordinatively unsaturated Al site with the release of 0.72 eV of energy (Figure 2c1) or 0.94 eV (Figure 2c2). Then, regardless of whether the hydrogen atom in the bridged hydroxyl group is transferred directly to the oxygen atom in SO2 (Figure 3c,d) or indirectly with the assistance of the adjacent bridged hydroxyl group (Figure 3c), the formation of sulfites (0.35 eV) and bisulfate (0.53 or 0.46 eV) through the hydrogen transfer reactions involving a bridged hydroxyl group is endothermic. Thus, the formation of both sulfite and bisulfate is thermodynamically unfavorable on bridged hydroxyl group sites. One can expect that obvious negative signals for the consumption of bridged hydroxyl groups (3700 cm–1) may be attributed to other processes, such as hydrogen bonding interaction with adsorbates (SO2, H2O, etc.). These results indicate that, compared to that on bridged hydroxyl group sites, the formation of sulfite and bisulfite on terminal hydroxyl groups is feasible; that is, the formation of sulfite/bisulfite depends on the types of hydroxyl groups on the γ-Al2O3 (110) surface. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the roles of different types of hydroxyl groups in the heterogeneous reaction of SO2 on the γ-Al2O3 (110) surface have been clearly distinguished.
Experimental studies found that the levels of sulfite and ammonium increased significantly with the coexistence of SO2 and NH3 compared to the presence of the individual gases on the surface of γ-Al2O3 (Figure S2). (15) Here, one thing that is very noticeable is that the intensity of the band assigned to the bridged hydroxyl group (3700 cm–1) decreased remarkably in contrast to that of the terminal hydroxyl group (3737 cm–1) when SO2 and NH3 coexisted. (15) In the case in which γ-Al2O3 is exposed to only SO2 or NH3, the intensities of the signals of hydroxyl groups are close to each other. The experimental results indicate that the promotion signals of sulfite and ammonium may be strongly associated with the consumption of a bridged hydroxyl group. However, to date, the underlying reason at the molecular level is unclear. Thus, the following calculations are conducted to uncover this mystery.
As shown in Figure 4, the reaction starts from the physical adsorption of NH3 on a bridged hydroxyl group in structure b (Figure 2) via hydrogen bonding interaction. This adsorption is spontaneous and exothermic (−0.81 eV). Then, the process proceeds through the cleavage of the O–H bond in the hydroxyl group with the assistance of SO2 and NH3; that is, the S atom in SO2 attacks the O aom in the bridged hydroxyl, leading to the simultaneous formation of a new O–S bond and a H–N bond. The energy barrier is 0.17 eV for the rate-determining step, which is low enough for this step to occur in the atmosphere. Subsequently, sulfite and ammonium are produced via the consumption of a bridged hydroxyl group with the coexistence of SO2 and NH3. As opposed to the situation of coexisting SO2 and NH3, sulfite formation is endothermic and nonspontaneous on bridged hydroxyl group sites in the absence of NH3 (Figure 3b). In addition, in the presence of only NH3, the formation of hydrogen bonds but not ammonium is observed between NH3 and surface hydroxyls (Figures S3 and S4). This may be due to the weak acidity of surface hydroxyl groups on the γ-Al2O3 (110) surface. This is consistent with the previous experimental results. (15) All of the results described above indicate that the synergistic formation of sulfite and ammonium is indeed related to the improved activity of surface-bridged hydroxyls. This promotion effect is mainly attributed to the abstraction of hydrogen by NH3 and simultaneous oxygen abstraction by SO2 from surface-bridged hydroxyls.

For the sake of clarity, the three-dimensional structure diagrams are displayed in panel b. All bond distances are given in angstroms.
We further explore the enhanced mechanism of sulfate formation in the presence of NH3, and the computed potential energy surfaces are shown in Figure 5. The reaction occurs via the oxidation of performed sulfite by O2 on the surface. First, O2 binds to the surface-bridged hydroxyl group by weak interactions of hydrogen bonds. Then, the peroxymonosulfate-like (HOOSO3*) intermediate is formed through a transition state (TS1) with an energy barrier of 0.88 eV, in which the bond between an O atom in O2 and a S atom in one of the surface sulfites tends to be connected. Then, intermediate HOOSO3* is transformed into sulfate via a transition state (TS2) with an energy barrier of 0.19 eV. Finally, the formation of sulfate is strongly exothermic (−4.35 eV). In TS2, the O–O bond in HOOSO3* tends to be cleaved and the O–S bond (S atom in another sulfite) tends to be formed. The higher barrier of 0.88 eV, compared to 0.19 eV, indicated that the process of intermediate HOOSO3* formation is the rate-determining step. This barrier can be overcome at ambient temperature; thereby, this reaction of sulfate formation in the presence of NH3 is kinetically favorable. However, with respect to the barrier (0.78 eV) in the rate-determining step without NH3 (Figure S5), the value of 0.88 eV is higher when NH3 is present. Considering the fact of the massively increased level of sulfite with the coexistence of NH3, we expected that improved sulfate formation could be attributed to the increased level of the reactant (absorbed sulfite) with NH3 rather than a decrease in the activation energy barrier. Furthermore, another possible channel of sulfate formed from the oxidation of sulfite by O2 on the surface with a defect site is also considered (Figure S6). The reaction proceeds via the following fundamental processes: (1) adsorption of O2 on a defect site, (2) dissociation of *O2 to from activated O, and (3) transfer of O to *SO3. Oxidation can occur by a barrierless (0.02 eV) mechanism. However, considering the rare amounts and unreproducibility of defect sites on the γ-Al2O3 (110) surface, the contribution of the channel described above to sulfate formation may not be important. Similarly, this channel is also strongly related to the amount of reactant (absorbed sulfite), which essentially depends on the degree of increase in the activity of surface-bridged hydroxyls from the systematic effect of SO2 and NH3. Taken together, the activity of surface-bridged hydroxyls promoted by the synergistic effect of SO2 and NH3 is vitally important for the formation of sulfate regardless of which pathways the reactions use.

Drawing support from the combination of molecular simulations and DFT calculations, this study provides crucial clues for the synergistic formation of sulfite, sulfate, and ammonium on the γ-Al2O3 surface at the molecular level. This could be attributed mainly to the promoted activity of surface-bridged hydroxyl with the coexistence of SO2 and NH3. The abstraction of oxygen by SO2 and hydrogen by NH3 from surface-bridged hydroxyl would directly improve the generation of sulfite and ammonium, simultaneously, indirectly enhance sulfate formation through the oxidation of sulfite by O2 on the γ-Al2O3 surface. The results highlight the importance of distinguishing the role of different types of surface hydroxyls for the follow-up studies on mineral dust, where surface hydroxyls are expected to be abundantly available. Note that the results presented above were gained on the basis of the stable model (such as the hydroxylated but not perfect Al2O3 model) after identification using first-principles molecular simulations, which provides a guarantee for obtaining more reasonable and realistic results.
As the third most abundant element in Earth’s crust, aluminum oxide (Al2O3) is a major component of soil and windblown mineral dust. (14) Hence, the heterogeneous synergistic effect of SO2 and NH3 on Al2O3 could be present on both mineral dust and the ground surface. More importantly, studies of real mineral dusts, for example, kaolinite, montmorillonite, and clay dust, reveal that Al-related surfaces rather than other metal surfaces are the most crucial active sites for adsorbing sulfate or activating SO2 to promote sulfate formation. (42,49) Thus, the proposed mechanisms from these simulations should be broadly applicable and may also help in better understanding the heterogeneous reaction on real mineral dust in the atmosphere. Additionally, 20–50% of the atmospheric loading of mineral dust aerosol stems from human activities, such as improper agricultural and grazing practices. (14,50) It is estimated that, by the year 2100, the production of mineral dust aerosol is anticipated to increase by 10% relative to its current level, due to the predicted increase in human activities and the expansion of dry areas. (51) The aging process involving mineral dust can change not only the migration and transformation of sulfur and nitrogen in the atmosphere but also the hygroscopicity and optical properties of mineral dust, which has an increasingly important impact on regional air quality and global climate change in the future.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
