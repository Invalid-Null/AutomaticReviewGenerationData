1. Introduction
Propene is a key chemical material of the petrochemical industry. It can be used to produce acrylonitrile, polypropylene, acrolein and acrylic acid. Nowadays, the propene is mainly obtained by steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha. And catalytic dehydrogenation of propane contributes marginally. However, propene from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking can not satisfy the expanding propene market. And compared with propane nonoxidative dehydrogenation, propane oxidative dehydrogenation is exothermic and no limitation of thermodynamic equilibrium [1]. But propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction is a challenge for catalysis research due to propane is less active than product propene. And deep oxidation reaction of the product leads to low selectivity. Many research works have been done to develop the catalysts with high selectivity [[2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]]. Among these catalysts, nickel molybdates catalysts have been considered as a promising candidate for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. However, the catalytic performance of Ni-Mo-O catalysts can not achieve the level of industrial application. In order to improve their catalytic performance, tremendous efforts have been dedicated including adding additives [13], loading on various supports [[14], [15], [16]], adjusting the ratio of Mo/Ni to change the phase structure of Ni-Mo-O catalysts [17]. With respect to the catalytic performance of Ni-Mo-O catalysts, the influence of phase structure on the catalytic performance have been investigated. Previous studies on the Ni-Mo-O catalysts with varying ratios of Mo/Ni have shown the phases including NiO, MoO3, NiMoO4 (α- and β-phase) and non-stoichiometric nickel molybdate [18]. For propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, the β-NiMoO4 phase was reported to be twice as selective to propene as α-phase [19]. However, α-phase can exist stably in room temperature while β-phase needs high temperature. Therefore, the catalysts with high β-NiMoO4 phase content should be synthesized for improving the selectivity of propene for propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. The nickel excess (Ni/Mo＞1) and the use of organic additives are the widespread way to prepare β-NiMoO4 phase materials [20].
In addition to the influence of intrinsic properties on the catalytic performance of Ni-Mo-O catalysts, the porous structure also shows some effects on the catalytic performance. It has been reported that the mesoporous nickel oxides are more active and selective than the bulk samples [21,22]. Compared with bulk materials, ordered mesoporous materials show some advantages on catalytic performance. The larger surface areas of mesoporous catalyst can offer more surface active sites for the reaction than that of bulk samples. Garreon et al. [23] have reported that mesoporous mixed cobalt-nickel spinel showed higher propane combustion conversion to CO and CO2 as compared to a conventional dense spinel due to the morphological and structural advantages such as larger surface area and mesoporous structure. Tüysüz et al. [24] reported that Cubic ordered mesoporous Co3O4 was found to be an excellent catalyst for low temperature CO oxidation, with the activity clearly depending on surface area and pore systems of the catalysts. Moreover, the mesoporous materials may expose different facets to bulk sample, which will influence the catalytic performance. Ma et al. [25] found the mesoporous Co3O4 with high catalytic activities for the trace ethylene oxidation because of the exposing of highly active{110} facets. The ordered mesoporous structure is favorable for the diffusion of reactants and products so as to avoid deep oxidation and coke formation. Bai et al. [26] reported mesoporous MnO2 catalysts with a special pore channel structure is benefical to the adsorption and diffusion of reactants and products. Lu et al. [27] reported a coking- and sintering-resistant Pd/Al2O3 catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane. The reason for coking-resistance is the size of the pore channels in the alumina much smaller than carbon filament. Shen et al. [28] found the mesopores can promote coke resistance during steam reforming of methane over ordered mesoporous Ni-Mg-Al oxides. Although the ordered mesoporous materials show unusual catalytic performance, the synthesis of ordered mesoporous binary metal oxides are still difficult compared with monometal oxides, due to the limitation of precursor. In a hard-templating synthesis process, metal precursors need to be filled into a hard template and convert to corresponding metal oxide, and then the hard template is removed by acid/base etching. Therefore, the precursors need to meet several requirements: Firstly, both of them should be highly soluble under moderate conditions. Secondly, conversion to the desired composition should be simple and with as little volume shrinkage as possible. Thridly, it should not chemically react with the hard template. Moreover, the templates should be easily and completely removed by chemical (leaching, combustion) or physical (thermal treatment) methods to obtain the true replicas [29]. In the preparation of ordered mesoporous Ni-Mo oxide, the difference on the Ni and Mo precursor makes it complicated for one-step synthesis method. Moreover, the surface Mo species can be leached both in alkaline conditions and HF, so the etching of silica template in hard template method may result in etching of some metal species, which will influence the catalytic performance of the mesoporous catalyst. In our previous work, ordered mesoporous NiMoO4 has been synthesized by hard template via vacuum nanocasting process and the surface area of mesoporous sample is several times higher than the bulk one. However, the catalytic performance has not been improved proportionally. One possible reason may be the etching of surface Mo species [30]. It has been reported that the surface MoO3 species is helpful for the catalytic performance of propane oxidative dehydrogenation [31]. Therefore, some other method should be used to avoid this phenomenon. In this work, two-step method has been used to prepare the Ni-Mo-O catalysts by firstly synthesis of ordered mesoporous NiO and then impregnation with Mo precursor. The solvent, organic additives and vacuum treatment is not needed in the preparation process. The catalysts with different ratios of Mo/Ni and different calcined temperatures were tested for propane oxidative dehydrogenation. Herein, we focused on revealing the changing process of phase structure and mesoporous structure with different ratios of Mo/Ni on the Ni-Mo-O catalysts. More importantly, the influence of phase structure and redox ability of Ni-Mo-O catalysts on the catalytic performance were investigated systemically.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals
All chemicals were used without further purification: tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, Innochem, 99%), n-butanol (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co., Ltd, ≥99.5%), P123 (Sigma-Aldrich), HCl (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co., Ltd, 36.0–38.0%), HF (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co., Ltd, ≥40%), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co., Ltd, ≥98.0%), phosphomolybdic acid hydrate (Innochem, 98%).
2.2. Catalyst preparation
KIT-6 hard template was prepared according to the procedure reported in the literature [32]. Briefly, 2 g of P123 was dissolved in 19 g of 2 M HCl and 57 g of deionized water to form a solution and the solution was stirred for 4 h at 35 °C. Subsequently, 2.92 g n-butanol was added and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. Then 6.42 g TEOS was gradually added to the solution and continuously stirred for 24 h. The resulting gel was placed into a Teflon autoclave and maintained at 100 °C for 24 h. The solid products were filtered, washed, and dried at 100 °C for 12 h, and calcined at 550 °C for 6 h. Finally, mesoporous KIT-6 template was obtained.
Ordered mesoporous NiO was prepared by hard template method via a solid-liquid route [33]. 2 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 1 g of KIT-6 were mixed and ground for 20 min in an agate mortar. And then the mixture was calcination at 500 °C for 5 h. The resulting sample was treated by 4% HF to remove KIT-6 template. Ordered mesoporous NiO support was obtained by washing with distilled water several times and drying at 60 °C for 12 h.
Ordered mesoporous Ni-Mo-O catalysts were synthesized by impregnation method. Stoichiometric phosphomolybdic acid hydrate was dissolved in 2 mL ethanol to form a solution. And then the solution was impregnated with 0.5 g of NiO support. The Ni-Mo-O samples with different Mo/Ni ratios were obtained after drying at 60 °C for 12 h and then calcination at 500 °C for 4 h. The Mo/Ni molar ratio of the catalysts were 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5, respectively. In order to investigate the influence of calcination temperature on the catalytic performance, the catalysts with Mo/Ni of 0.4 were calcined at 400, 500, 600 and 700 °C.
The bulk Ni-Mo-O catalyst were prepared with Mo/Ni of 0.4. 2 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O was ground for 20 min in an agate mortar and then calcination at 500 °C for 5 h to obtain the bulk NiO support. The impregnation of stoichiometric phosphomolybdic acid hydrate for preparation of bulk Ni-Mo-O catalyst is the same as the mesoporous catalyst.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
Texture parameters of NiO and Ni-Mo-O catalysts were investigated by nitrogen physisorption. Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at −196 °C were carried out on a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 porosimetry analyzer. The samples were degassed at 300 °C for 8 h prior to the measurements. The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method was utilized to calculate the speciﬁc surface areas. By using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) model, the pore size distributions were derived from the adsorption branches of isotherms, and the total pore volumes (Vt) were estimated from the adsorbed amount at a relative pressure P/P0 of 0.99.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Shimadzu XRD 6000 diffractometer using Cu Kα (λ = 0.15406 nm) radiation with a Nickel filter operating at 40 kV and 40 mA in the 2θ range of 10–80 ° at a scanning rate of 4°/min. The samples were ground and sieved by 320 mesh sieve.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken on JEOL JEM 2100 electron microscope equipped with a field emission source at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The samples were sonicated 20 min and well suspended in ethanol (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co., Ltd, ≥99.8%) prior to the measurements. Drops of the suspension were applied and after drying the fine particles were well dispersed on a copper grid coated with carbon.
Fourier-transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) were collected on an FTS-3000 IR instrument. The samples were mixed with KBr (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Beijing Co., Ltd, ≥99.5%, Sample: KBr = 1:100, mass ratio) and pressed into pellets. The spectra were collected in the range of 4000-400 cm−1 and KBr was used as background.
Particle size distributions of the catalysts were measured by using Malvern Nano 90 instrument. Three measurements were performed per sample.
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer PHI-1600 ESCA spectrometer using Mg Kα (hv = 1253.6 eV, 1 eV = 1.603 × 10−19 J) X-ray source. The binding energies were calibrated using C1 s peak of contaminant carbon (BE = 284.6 eV) as an internal standard.
Raman spectra were performed on a Renishaw inVia Reflex Raman spectrometer with a 532 nm laser at room temperature under ambient conditions. The in-situ Raman spectra of the catalysts were collected on a Renishaw inVia Reflex Raman spectrometer with a 532 nm laser. The sample of 5 mg (60–80 meshes) was placed in a small reactor to pretreat 30 min under 10%O2/He atmosphere (Dalian Special Gases Co., Ltd, 99.99%) at 100 °C and subsequently flushed at the same temperature for 0.5 h at N2 (Dalian Special Gases Co., Ltd, 99.999%) atmosphere to remove the O2 (Dalian Special Gases Co., Ltd, 99.999%) in the system. Afterword, the spectra were recorded with the changing of temperature at 10% O2/He atmosphere. Similarly, the in-situ Raman experiments during the reaction is recorded in the atmosphere of 10%C3H8/10%O2/He. The spectra were recorded at different points to ensure that the data collected were representative of the bulk powder.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken on a Quanta 200 F instruments using accelerating voltages of 5 kV. The samples for SEM measurements were dusted on conducting resin and coated with 10 nm Au prior to measurement.
Temperature-programmed reduction with H2 (H2-TPR) measurements were performed on a Quantachrome Autosorb iQ apparatus. 100 mg sample was pretreated at 300 °C for 1 h under O2 and subsequently cooled to 30 °C under He (Dalian Special Gases Co., Ltd, 99.999%). Afterwards, 10% H2/Ar flow (Dalian Special Gases Co., Ltd, 99.99%, 40 mL/min) was passed over the catalyst bed while the temperature was ramped from 30 to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The hydrogen consumption signal was monitored by a TCD. Before the outlet gases entering the TCD, a cooling trap was used to remove H2O.
2.4. Catalyst activity measurements
Propane oxidative dehydrogenation was performed in a quartz tubular micro-reactor at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst (100 mg) with particle size of 40–60 mesh was used to test the activity. The feed consisted of a mixture of C3H8/O2/Ar (C3H8, 99.999%, O2, 99.999%, Ar, 99.999%, Dalian Special Gases Co., Ltd) with a molar ratio of 1/1/8 with the total flow rate of 20 mL/min. The experiments were carried out in the temperature range of 500 − 650 °C. Feed and products were analyzed on-line by a gas chromatograph (SP-2100), equipped with FID detector. A Porapak Q column was used for the seperation of CO, CO2, C2H4, C3H6, C3H8. A methanizer with Ni catalyst was used to convert CO and CO2 to methane at 380 °C so as to be detected in the FID detector.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
3.1.1. Results of nitrogen adsorption–desorption
The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms and the pore size distribution are given in Fig. 1. NiO support exhibits isotherm of type IV which is characteristic for ordered mesoporous materials. And there are two hysteresis loops in the isotherm of NiO, which is corresponding to the two pore size in Fig. 1B. The pore size centered at 3.7 nm is approximately equal to the wall thickness of KIT-6 template. It is because the pore structures of KIT-6 parent material can be transferred to the solid structure of the generated NiO material, while the walls of the KIT-6 parent become the voids of the NiO replica. The pore size centered around 23.9 nm is caused by the interspace among spherical NiO secondary particles. The absence of the pore size distribution centered at around 11 nm and the narrow pore size distribution at 3.7 nm prove that NiO grows homogeneous in both channel systems of the double gyroid structure in the KIT-6 template [34]. The Ni-Mo-O catalysts also show a type IV isotherm. It can be concluded that the heat treatment processes after loading Mo do not lead to a collapse of the mesoporous structure in NiO support. But the height of the hysteresis loop decreases with the increasing of Mo loadings due to the reduction of the pore volume. It results from Mo deposition inside the mesopores. The mesopore size decreases from 3.7 nm to 3.4 nm for the catalyst with Mo/Ni ratio of 0.05, and it further decreases with the increasing of Mo loading amount, which indicates that part of Mo species enter into the mesopores. The size of pore formed by the interspace of the nanoparticles also decreases due to the crosslinking of the nanoparticles by loading Mo species.

On the basis of the adsorption/desorption isotherms, the textural properties of NiO and Ni-Mo-O catalysts were calculated by specific algorithms and they are shown in Table 1. Briefly, NiO has a BET surface area of 83.5 m2/g and a pore volume of 0.43 cm3/g. When NiO is loaded with small amount of Mo (Mo/Ni atomic ratio of 0.05), the surface area decreases to 67.8 m2/g and the pore volume of the sample decreased to 0.30 cm3/g. When NiO is loaded with large amount of Mo (Mo/Ni atomic ratio of 0.5), the surface area and pore volume show a significant decrease with surface area 8.7 m2/g and pore volume 0.06 cm3/g. This indicates that mesopores of NiO support were filled with a large amount of loaded Mo.

3.1.2. Results of SEM and TEM
Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of Ni-Mo-O catalysts with different Mo/Ni ratios. It can be seen that Ni-Mo-O catalyst shows the morphology similar to sphere and the size of the spherical particles is submicrometer scale. The size distribution of the particles is carried out by using a laser particle size analyzer. As shown in Fig. 2 inset, the size of the particles increases with the increasing of Mo loading amount. From the TEM images (as shown in Fig. 3), it can be seen that Ni-Mo-O samples with low Mo/Ni ratios (Mo/Ni atomic ratio of 0.05 and 0.1) exhibit highly ordered mesoporous structure (HRTEM is shown in Figure S2 A), confirming the successful synthesis of mesoporous NiO support by nanocasting method and the highly stable mesoporous structure of Ni-Mo-O samples after impregnation with Mo precursor and heat treatments. A clear morphology change has been observed from TEM images (Figure a–f) with the increasing of Mo/Ni ratios. It can be seen that the mesoporous channels are partly blocked due to the impregnation of Mo species, which causes that the mesoporous channel becomes unclear as shown in Figure S2 B. The loading of Mo into the mesopores of NiO support results in the more dense structure, which is in good agreement with the results of N2 physisorption. Moreover, the nanoparticles were crosslinked together with the high Mo loading, which is also demonstrated by the increasing of particle size as shown in Fig. 2 inset.

3.1.3. Results of XRD
XRD patterns of mesoporous Ni-Mo-O catalysts with different Mo/Ni ratios are shown in Fig. 4. All the catalysts show characteristic peaks of cubic NiO (Fm3m) at 2θ = 37.2°, 43.3° and 62.9°, which is assigned to (111), (200) and (220) crystal planes, respectively [35] (JCPDS Card No. 4-0835). For the Ni-Mo-O catalyst with Mo/Ni of 0.05, no peaks attributed to Mo oxide of Ni-Mo complex are observed, indicating that the Mo species are highly dispersed on the NiO support or existed in the form of amorphous phases. When the ratio of Mo/Ni increased to 0.1, the pattern shows a new characteristic peak at 2θ = 26.7° in addition to those peaks assigned to NiO. The new peak is attributed to a β-NiMoO4 phase. For the Ni-Mo-O catalyst with Mo/Ni of 0.2, the diffraction peaks at 2θ = 26.7° and 28.7° of β-NiMoO4 become obvious and there are some new peaks at 2θ = 23.5°, 27.4° and 34.0° appeared, which also assigned to the diffraction peaks of β-NiMoO4 according to the file 12-0348 of the JCPDS database. It is demonstrated the formation of β-NiMoO4 crystalline phase in Ni-Mo-O catalysts. For the Ni-Mo-O catalysts with high Mo/Ni ratios (Mo/Ni of 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5), the XRD patterns show some characteristic peaks at 2θ = 25.6°, 32.3° and 47.6° of α-NiMoO4 phase (JCPDS Card No. 31-0902), which can be matched to the peaks for (-112), (310) and (-204) crystalline planes, respectively [22].

Fig. 4. XRD patterns of mesoporous Ni-Mo-O catalysts: (a) Mo/Ni = 0.05, (b) Mo/Ni = 0.1, (c) Mo/Ni = 0.2, (d) Mo/Ni = 0.3, (e) Mo/Ni = 0.4, (f) Mo/Ni = 0.5. (◆ NiO □ β-NiMoO4 ♥ α-NiMoO4).
According to the XRD results, the crystalline structure of Ni-Mo-O catalysts changed with the increasing of the amount of Mo loading. The Ni-Mo-O catalyst with low Mo loading (Mo/No of 0.05) shows the NiO crystalline phase with some highly dispersed Mo species, while Mo/Ni ratio reached 0.3, the Ni-Mo-O catalysts shows the appearance of NiMoO4 with both α-NiMoO4 and β-NiMoO4 crystalline phase. Even with high Mo/Ni ratio in the Ni-Mo-O catalyst (Mo/Ni = 0.5), no phase of MoO3 appears, indicating that the Mo species diffused into the lattice of NiO crystalline phase to form NiMoO4 phase and no aggregate MoOx crystalline phase formed. It indicates the highly dispersed of Mo on the Ni-Mo-O catalysts which may be attributed to the large surface area of ordered mesoporous NiO support.
In general, β-NiMoO4 phase is metastable at room temperature and the transition from α-NiMoO4 to β-NiMoO4 need to a high temperature of 700 °C. But it is noticed in Fig. 4 that the NiMoO4 in Ni-Mo-O catalysts exist mainly in the form of β-NiMoO4. It is reported that the β-NiMoO4 phase was twice as selective towards the alkene as that of the α-NiMoO4 phase for propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene. Therefore, the Ni-Mo-O catalysts prepared with highly proportional β-NiMoO4 phase is favorable for the propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction.
3.1.4. Results of FT-IR
The FT-IR spectra of mesoporous NiO and Ni-Mo-O catalysts with different Mo/Ni ratios are shown in Fig. 5. The NiO shows no apparent band in the range of 600-1100 cm−1 on the spectrum. After loading Mo on the NiO support (spectrum a in Fig. 5), new absorption bands were detected at 800 and 881 cm−1, indicating some new vibration except for that of NiO. The bands at 800 and 881 cm−1 are attributed to tetrahedral coordination molybdenum and oxygen vibration of β-NiMoO4 [17]. According to the FT-IR result, although no observation of the peaks ascribed to β-NiMoO4 in the XRD results, the Ni-Mo-O catalyst with Mo/Ni of 0.05 also shows the vibration of β-NiMoO4, indicating the formation of amorphous or nanocrystalline β-NiMoO4 with the size below the XRD limit of detection. The difference of α-NiMoO4 and β-NiMoO4 on the structural type are that α-NiMoO4 contains molybdenum in an octahedral configuration and β-NiMoO4 contains molybdenum in a tetrahedral configuration. In the FT-IR spectra, the bands at 939 and 962 cm−1 are assigned to octahedral coordination molybdenum and oxygen vibration of α-NiMoO4 [36], while the bands at 800 and 881 cm−1 are attributed to tetrahedral coordination molybdenum and oxygen vibration of β-NiMoO4. These two bands are used to distinguish the two phases by the structural change from six coordinate molybdenum in the α-NiMoO4 to four coordinate molybdenum in the β-NiMoO4 [17]. When the Mo/Ni ratio reached 0.2 (spectrum c in Fig. 5), another two new bands appeared at 939 and 962 cm−1, indicating the formation of α-NiMoO4 in Ni-Mo-O catalysts. And the Ni-Mo-O catalysts exist in the form of NiO, α-NiMoO4 and β-NiMoO4.

3.1.5. Results of Raman
As shown in Fig. 6, no signals assigned to NiO were detected in the range of 650-1100 cm−1 of the NiO Raman spectrum owing to the inherent nature that even if well-crystallized NiO provides ill-defined Raman spectrum [37]. The spectrum (Fig. 6a) of Ni-Mo-O catalyst with Mo/Ni of 0.05 shows two weak bands at 947 and 959 cm−1. When the amount of Mo loading reached Mo/Ni of 0.1, these two bands become apparent and new bands at 827 and 902 cm−1 appear. The bands of 947, 902 and 827 cm−1 indicates the formation of β-NiMoO4 [38], while the band of 959 cm−1 attributes to the symmetric stretching modes of the terminal MoO bond of α-NiMoO4 [39]. For the Ni-Mo-O catalysts (Mo/Ni = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5), the Raman spectra show the bands at 959, 947, 912, 902, 893, 827 and 702cm−1. The band at 912 cm−1 has been assigned to the asymmetric stretching modes of the terminal MoO bond, and the band at 702 cm−1 has been attributed to the Ni-O-Mo symmetric stretch. These bands at 959, 912 and 702 cm−1 demonstrate the formation of crystalline α-NiMoO4 [39], which is consistent with the XRD results. The bands at 947, 902, 893 and 827 cm−1 indicated the formation of crystalline β-NiMoO4 [38]. Moreover, the absence of the bands at around 996, 817 and 667 cm−1 indicates the absence of crystalline MoO3.

According to the XRD, FT-IR and Raman characterization, although no NiMoO4 crystalline phase formed on Ni-Mo-O catalyst with Mo/Ni of 0.05, the vibration of bond on NiMoO4 are detected. It indicates that loaded Mo species diffused to the NiO lattice and the amorphous or small size NiMoO4 were formed in Ni-Mo-O catalyst with Mo/Ni of 0.05. With the increasing of Mo loadings, the crystalline NiMoO4 are detected with both α-NiMoO4 and β-NiMoO4. Compared with the α-NiMoO4, β-NiMoO4 shows a higher content, which is stable by the NiO support. The absence of MoOx indicates the high dispersion of Mo species on NiO support.
3.1.6. Results of XPS
Fig. 7(A) shows the XPS spectra of Ni 2p region for the NiO and Ni-Mo-O catalysts with different Mo/Ni ratios. The peaks at around 855 and 873 eV correspond to the spin-orbit split lines of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2. The peaks around 862 and 880 eV are assigned to the shakeup satellite structures of Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2. It is emphasized here that the analysis of Ni focused solely on the most intense Ni2p3/2 component because both the binding energies and quantitative measurements can be obtained more accurately. After deconvolution of the Ni2p3/2 peak, two peaks at 853.9 and 855.9 eV appear for NiO support. The peak at 853.9 eV can be ascribed to Ni2+, while the peak at 855.9 can be ascribed to Ni3+ species on the NiO surface [40]. The KIT-6 and NiO complex was formed during the calcination procedure. And the NiO lattice distortions formed in the junction of NiO crystalline and SiO2 template, which may results in the formation of Ni2+ vacancies. To keep the charge near the Ni2+ vacancies neutral, some of the Ni2+ ions were transformed to Ni3+. The peak of Ni 2p3/2 for pure NiO exhibits a peak at 853.9 eV. After loading with Mo, it shifts to higher binding energy (854.4 eV) for the Ni-Mo-O samples. The shift towards higher binding energy can be explained by the strong interaction between Ni and Mo due to the formation of the complex oxides NiMoO4 [41]. It is interesting to find that the relative intensity of the peak assigned to Ni3+ in NiO sample increases with the increasing of Mo/Ni ratios. It is due to the formation of NiMoO4 in Ni-Mo-O samples. The peak at 856.1 is also assigned to the Ni2+ in NiMoO4 except for the Ni3+ in NiO support. The increase of Mo loading amount results in the increasing of NiMoO4 content in Ni-Mo-O samples. Therefore, the intensity of the peak at 856.1 eV increases with the increasing of Mo/Ni ratios. According to the Ni 2p XPS results, it can be indicated that there are both NiO and NiMoO4 in the Ni-Mo-O samples and the Ni species exist in the form of Ni2+ and Ni3+.

With the aim of revealing the molybdenum oxidation state and obtaining certain insights into its coordination sphere, XPS spectra of Mo 3d region for the Ni-Mo-O catalysts with different Mo/Ni ratios are shown in Fig. 7(B). It can be seen that the Mo 3d energy region shows the typical spin-orbit splitting of the Mo 3d doublet (3d5/2 and 3d3/2). The Mo 3d5/2 spectra of catalysts exhibit only one peak at 232.5 eV. This signal is often attributed to Mo6+ species coordinated to oxygen groups [42], which indicates the Mo species in Ni-Mo-O catalysts exist in the form of Mo6+. The intensity of peak increases with the increasing of Mo/Ni ratio, indicating the increase of Mo species on the surface of Ni-Mo-O samples.
Fig. 7(C) shows the XPS spectra of O 1 s region for the NiO and Ni-Mo-O catalysts with different Mo/Ni ratios. As shown in the Fig. 7(C), the O1 s peaks of NiO are ﬁtted into three peaks at 529.4, 531.3 and 532.5 eV. The peak at 529.4 eV is assigned to the lattice oxygen (O2−) of NiO [43]. And the peaks at 531.3 and 532.5 eV are assigned to two kinds of chemisorbed oxygen (O- and O2-, respectively). For the Ni-Mo-O samples, the binding energies of lattice oxygen (O2−) increase to 529.9–530.2 eV, which is ascribed to the lattice oxygen of NiMoO4 [44]. It indicates that the NiMoO4 phase enriched in surface of the NiO support on Ni-Mo-O samples. And the peaks at 531.3–531.5 eV and 532.5–532.8 eV are assigned to two kinds of chemisorbed oxygen (O- and O2-, respectively). Table 2 summaries some of the XPS results. It is interesting to note that the ratios of the chemisorbed oxygen and lattice oxygen ((O-+O2-)/O2-) are distinctly different for Ni-Mo-O samples. The ratio decreases with the increasing of Mo/Ni ratio, indicating less chemisorbed oxygen species on the sample with high Mo/Ni ratio. Although the ratio of (O-+O2-)/O2- decreases with the increasing of Mo/Ni ratio, the ratio of O-/O2- almost keeps steady in all Ni-Mo-O samples. It is reported that the O- are active species for the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction [45] and O- shows higher selectivity than other oxygen species in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction over NiO catalysts [46]. Since O- is more stable than O2-, the former is expected to be more selective to propene for the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction [47].

The ratio of Mo/Ni obtained by XPS (Table 2) shows that the Mo/Ni ratio (XPS) increases with the increasing of nominal Mo/Ni ratio. But with low nominal Mo/Ni ratio (inventory of 0.05 and 0.1), the Mo/Ni ratio (XPS) is greater than the nominal Mo/Ni ratio. And with high nominal Mo/Ni ratio (inventory of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5), the Mo/Ni ratio (XPS) is less than the nominal Mo/Ni ratio, which indicates more Mo species diffuse into NiO lattice to form NiMoO4 phase in high Mo/Ni samples.
3.1.7. Results of H2-TPR
Fig. 8 shows the H2-TPR results. For pure NiO, three H2 consumption peaks at 352, 448 and 577 °C appeared. The two peaks at the relatively lower temperature can be attributed to the reduction of two types of Ni2+/Ni3+ species to metallic nickel [48]. The peak at the higher temperature might be caused by the different size of crystalline NiO [49]. After adding Mo species in NiO support, the peaks of Ni-Mo-O samples shift to high temperature compared with NiO, which indicates that the reducibility of the Ni species is inhibited by adding Mo species. This may be caused by the strong interaction of Mo and Ni. Because of the formation of NiMoO4 in Ni-Mo-O samples, there are two other peaks appeared in Fig. 8, which is caused by the reduction of NiMoO4. And with the increasing of Mo amount, the intensity of these peaks increases. Due to the Ni-Mo-O samples are composed of different phases including NiO, α-NiMoO4 and β-NiMoO4, the reductions of these phases overlapped with each other. It is in good agreement with the literature. [[50], [51], [52]] According to the H2-TPR results, it can be seen that the redox ability of Ni-Mo-O catalysts are apparently different. And it influences the catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation.

3.2. Catalytic performance for propane oxidative dehydrogenation to propene
Fig. 9 exhibits the propane conversion and propene selectivity at different temperatures for the mesoporous Ni-Mo-O catalysts. It can be seen from Fig. 9A that the propane conversion increases monotonically with increasing the reaction temperature. The Ni-Mo-O catalyst with Mo/Ni of 0.05 shows the highest propane conversion in the low temperature range (500–575 °C). And the conversion of propane decreases with the increasing of Mo/Ni ratios for the Ni-Mo-O catalysts with Mo/Ni to 0.3. However, it increases on Ni-Mo-O catalysts with Mo/Ni of 0.4 and 0.5. The conversion of propane over these catalysts in the temperature range 500–575 °C shows the following order: Mo/Ni 0.05> Mo/Ni 0.4> Mo/Ni 0.5> Mo/Ni 0.1> Mo/Ni 0.2> Mo/Ni 0.3, while in the temperature range of 600–650 °C it shows the following order: Mo/Ni 0.4> Mo/Ni 0.05> Mo/Ni 0.5> Mo/Ni 0.1> Mo/Ni 0.3> Mo/Ni 0.2. Fig. 9B shows the selectivity of propene at different temperatures over these catalysts. The selectivity of propene over Ni-Mo-O catalysts shows reverse regular with the propane conversion, in which the lowest selectivity has been obtained on the catalyst with Mo/Ni of 0.05. The propene selectivity increases with the Mo/Ni up to Mo/Ni of 0.3. And then it decreases on the Ni-Mo-O catalysts with Mo/Ni of 0.4 and 0.5. Moreover, the propene selectivity decreases with increasing the reaction temperature, indicating that the rate of propane combustion (side reaction occurring in parallel with the dehydrogenation) is higher than the rate of dehydrogenation [53]. Fig. 10 displays the dependence of propene selectivity as a function of propane conversion. Apparently, it demonstrates the inverse relation between selectivity and conversion, indicating the typical reaction network of propane oxidative dehydrogenation with parallel and consecutive hydrocarbon combustion. Fig. 11 shows the yield of propene at different temperatures over these catalysts. For the Ni-Mo-O catalysts, propane conversion increased, while selectivity to propene decreased with the increase of reaction temperature, resulting in a volcano plot of propene yield. It can be seen that the Ni-Mo-O catalyst with Mo/Ni of 0.4 shows the highest propene yield in the whole temperature range. The highest propene yield of 15.6% has been obtained on 600 °C. According to the activity results, it can be seen that the catalyst with appropriate Mo/Ni ratio shows the best catalytic performance. To further investigate the distribution of product, the selectivity of all the products has been listed in Table 3. It can be seen that for the catalyst of Mo/Ni 0.05, the COx selectivity exceed 50% in the whole temperature range, and the catalyst with lower Mo/Ni ratio the COx selectivity improved, indicating that the Mo oxides are more selective than Ni oxides. For the other catalysts, the selectivity of COx increases with the increasing of temperature, which indicates that the high temperature favors side reaction for producing the by-products. The catalytic performance for pure NiO and MoO3 is distinct difference (Figure S3). NiO shows a complete conversion at 500 °C with low propene selectivity, while the pure MoO3 shows low propane conversion even at high temperature (7.2% at 600 °C). In order to verify the stability of instrument and reproducibility of experiments, the experimental error was investigated over NiO catalyst by testing the catalytic performance for three times. The results are shown in Figure S4, which demonstrate that the experiments show fine repetition. In order to investigate the influence of mesoporous structure, the bulk Ni-Mo-O catalyst (Mo/Ni of 0.4) was also tested for propane oxidative dehydrogenation. As shown in Fig. 12A, the bulk Ni-Mo-O catalyst shows lower propane conversion and propene selectivity than mesoporous catalyst. The mesoporous catalyst shows higher propene yield than the bulk one (Fig. 12B). Because the phase of the Ni-Mo-O catalysts may be influenced by the calcination temperature, which will affect the catalytic performance. A series of Ni-Mo-O catalysts with Mo/Ni 0.4 was synthesized with different calcination temperature (400, 500, 600 and 700 °C) and the catalytic performance was tested for propane oxidative dehydrogenation. As shown in Fig. 13, the catalytic performance of Ni-Mo-O catalyst calcined at 400 °C shows higher propane conversion and lower propene selectivity than the other catalysts in the reaction temperature range from 500 to 550 °C.

3.3. The relationship between structure and redox of Ni-Mo-O catalysts and their catalytic performance
The selectivity of propene on Ni-Mo-O catalyst decreases dramatically over Ni-Mo-O catalyst with the increasing of reaction temperature, which indicates the CC bond cleavage side reaction is favored in Ni-Mo-O catalyst at high temperature (as shown in Table 3). As a consequence, the low propene selectivity at high propane conversion is achieved in these catalysts. Compared with bulk Ni-Mo-O catalyst, the mesoporous catalyst shows high propene selectivity. The reason is may be the high surface area, ordered mesoporous structure and the high β-NiMoO4 phase content on mesoporous sample as shown in Figure S5. For Ni-Mo-O catalysts, the phase structure influences their performance. And the redox property of these catalysts also plays an important role in the catalytic performance.
3.3.1. The influence of redox ability on the catalysis activity over Ni-Mo-O catalysts
The propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction on Ni-Mo-O catalysts usually follows the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, which is closely related to the redox ability or oxygen species of these catalysts. Compared with NiO catalyst, Ni-Mo-O catalysts shows lower activity in the propane conversion, which is due to the high redox ability on NiO (Fig. 8) and a large amount of chemisorbed oxygen species (Fig. 7C). As shown in Fig. 8, the reduction temperature for Ni-Mo-O catalysts shifts to high temperature compared with pure NiO. It results in a hindrance of first step of propane oxidative dehydrogenation (reduction of the catalyst surface) in Ni-Mo-O catalysts. As this step is generally considered to be a limiting factor in propane oxidative dehydrogenation, this could be one reason for the lower activity of the Ni-Mo-O catalysts compared with NiO [54]. But compared with NiO, the Ni-Mo-O catalysts shows higher selectivity to propene, which may be results from the relative weak redox ability of Ni-Mo-O catalysts.
3.3.2. The influence of the phase structure on the catalysis activity over Ni-Mo-O catalyst
For NiMoO4 with α-NiMoO4 phase and β-NiMoO4 phase, it shows different activity and selectivity on propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. The α-NiMoO4 phase is more active on propane conversion, while the β-NiMoO4 phase more selective to propene [18]. However, the stability of these two phases is different with the α-NiMoO4 phase stable from room temperature up to 650 °C and the β-NiMoO4 phase stable at T > 650 °C [55]. In this work, the NiMoO4 phase in Ni-Mo-O samples exists mainly in the form of β-NiMoO4 phase after calcination at 500 °C or higher temperature (Figure S6). But for the catalyst calcined at 400 °C, the main phases are MoO3 and NiO, no NiMoO4 phase is detected, which results in different catalytic performance in the temperature range from 500 °C to 550 °C.
Compared with NiMoO4 phase, the NiO phase is more active for undesired and over-oxidation product formation during propane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction. And in our experiments, the pure NiO sample shows a complete conversion at 500 °C, indicating a good ability of activation of CH or CC bond. while the pure MoO3 shows (Figure S3) low propane conversion even at high temperature (7.2% at 600 °C), which indicate the poor ability to activate propane molecules. It can be seen that catalysts with Mo/Ni of 0.2 and 0.3 shows higher propene selectivity than other catalysts. One of the reasons may be the large ratios of β-NiMoO4/α-NiMoO4 as shown in the Raman characterization (Fig. 6).
In order to investigate the influence of phase structure changing on the catalytic performance during the reaction process, in-situ Raman spectroscopy was used to characterize the changes during the reaction process. Fig. 14 shows the in-situ Raman spectra during the temperature-changing process in the atmosphere of O2/He for Ni-Mo-O catalyst with Mo/Ni of 0.4. The Raman spectrum at 200 °C shows the peaks of 946 and 956 cm−1, which are assigned to β-NiMoO4 and α-NiMoO4 phase, respectively. And with the increasing of temperature the intensity of peak at 946 cm−1 increases, while the peak of 956 cm−1 decreases. It indicates the transformation of α-NiMoO4 to β-NiMoO4. And the transformation temperature is clearly lower than the literature [55], which is promoted by NiO support. According to the catalytic performance result of the catalyst with Mo/Ni of 0.4, the transformation of α-NiMoO4 to β-NiMoO4 do not reversely decrease in propene selectivity with the increasing of temperature. It is because that the ratio of β-NiMoO4/α-NiMoO4 in this catalyst is mainly keep stable with the temperature beyond 500 °C. Moreover, these two peaks exhibits a red shift with these two peaks shifting to 938 and 943 cm−1, respectively, which is due to the thermal treatment [56]. It can be found that these two peaks shift back to 946 and 956 cm−1 when temperature was decreased to 200 °C.

There is no obvious change except the intensity of Raman band after the atmosphere changing from O2/He to C3H8/O2/He. And the catalyst shows high stability during the reaction with the increasing of reaction temperature, which is demonstrated by the similar Raman spectra with increasing temperature. Moreover, no coke deposition happened during the reaction.

The mesoporous structure is still intact after reaction according to the low angle XRD patterns (Fig. 16A) with the present of (211) reflection of Ia 3d symmetry in the sample.

Moreover, the phase structure stability is demonstrated by the XRD characterization (Fig. 16B) with no distinct diffraction peaks.

4. Conclusions
In this work, a series of ordered mesoporous Ni-Mo-O catalysts with different ratios Mo/Ni were prepared by two-step method. With the low loading amount of Mo, the Ni-Mo-O catalyst shows highly ordered mesoporous structure. With the increasing of Mo loading amount, the mesoporous structure becomes vague due to the formation of NiMoO4 phase on the surface and in mesopores of NiO support. And the ratio of β-NiMoO4/α-NiMoO4 changed on Ni-Mo-O catalysts with different ratios of Mo/Ni. The catalyst with Mo/Ni of 0.4 shows the highest propane oxidative dehydrogenation activity with the propene yield of 15.6% among these catalysts. The reasons may be from the high β-NiMoO4/α-NiMoO4 ratio, the mesoporous structure and the suitable redox ability.
