The given document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses isobutane dehydrogenation to isobutene using Pt-In based catalysts modified with different fluorides. It does not mention propane or propylene at all. The process is focused on converting isobutane to isobutene, not propane to propylene. Therefore, this document does not seem directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation.
