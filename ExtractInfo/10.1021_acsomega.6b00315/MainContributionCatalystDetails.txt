 Based on the multiple documents provided, I have synthesized the key information into the following XML output:

<output>
	<Relevance>No</Relevance>
</output>

The documents discuss the use of defect-laden hexagonal boron nitride (dh-BN) as a metal-free heterogeneous catalyst for hydrogenation of various olefins like propene, cyclohexene etc. However, they do not contain any information related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The focus of the research is on hydrogenation reactions using dh-BN, not on converting propane to propylene. Therefore, these documents are not relevant to propane dehydrogenation and an integrated XML summary cannot be provided. The <Relevance> tag has been set to "No" to indicate this.
