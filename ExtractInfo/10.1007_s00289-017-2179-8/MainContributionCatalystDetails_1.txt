The given document discusses the synthesis and characterization of fluorinated polyimide/TiO2 nanocomposites for enhancing the separation of four gases (ethane, ethylene, propane, and propylene). However, it does not pertain to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically. The document focuses on gas separation membranes and does not discuss converting propane to propylene via either PDH or ODH processes.
