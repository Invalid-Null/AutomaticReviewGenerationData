The provided document discusses propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) catalysts, but does not contain any details about a specific catalyst that represents a main scientific contribution for converting propane to propylene. The document provides a broad overview of ODH catalyst research and performance trends, but does not go into specifics on a particular catalyst composition, preparation method, structure, performance metrics, etc. that would be needed to extract the requested details. Since a specific catalyst is not presented as a key advance, I cannot provide the requested XML output.
