1. Introduction
More than 95% of all manufactured products rely on chemistry to solve a wide array of problems and provide unique properties for advanced materials. To achieve the highest production efficiency and lowest footprint 90% of chemical processes employ catalysts. Still, the chemical industry consumes 30% of global industrial energy, so improved catalysts and related energy efficiency advances are vital to sustainably employing the global energy supply [1], [2].
A recent global chemical industry technology roadmap describes the potential impact of continuous improvements, best practices, emerging technologies, and breakthrough advances to cut energy use and emissions (greenhouse gases (GHG), and other pollutants) [1], [2]. Improving the efficiency of olefin production, selectivity of partial oxidation reactions, and alternative routes to feedstocks are among the top opportunities highlighted.
The global chemical industry is in transition as it responds to changes in feedstock availability and type, local resource utilization, and feedstock logistics. In the U.S., the discontinuity of shale gas is prompting a huge wave of investment in state-of-the-art facilities. Ripples in the supply chain include reduced availability of C3, C4 hydrocarbons resulting in the advent of on-purpose plants for those intermediates. In Asia, the drive to use local resources and growth have accelerated coal to chemicals and use of stranded hydrocarbons. The Middle East is increasingly cracking naphtha due to limited availability of gas [3]. Europe is beginning to import natural gas liquids for chemical production, diversifying its reliance on naphtha [4]. Former (Fischer–Tropsch, Houdry process for butadiene) and new technologies (direct conversions) are now being tapped to meet a wide variety of needs across the supply chain [3].
These dramatic supply shifts and changing market needs present a unique opportunity to improve current processes and accelerate progress in future technologies (emerging, game-changers). In parallel, there is a remarkable opportunity to reduce the emissions footprint through a revitalization of industrial catalysis and related process R&D. It also gives an opening to apply advanced capabilities (modeling, high throughput, etc.) and an integrated approach to make step-changes in the understanding of fundamentals so technical hurdles can be lowered.
2. Materials and methods
Publically available data for catalyst impact on process efficiency is limited so a recent roadmap combined information from several complimentary sources [1], [2]. Information on the energy use and catalyst impact for the top 40 energy consuming catalytically relevant processes was gathered using a questionnaire sent to chemical manufacturers, catalyst manufacturers, and academic experts. The survey responses were augmented/verified using market research data from IHS Consulting, contact with industry experts, and discussions with licensors. Open literature was also used to provide a broad perspective. To compare processes on a similar basis, the specific energy use (SEC) was employed. This is the amount of energy, expressed in GJ/metric ton that an average facility would require to produce a specific product. The impact of catalysts and process improvements were considered as a whole since they are difficult to separate and the integration of efforts is important to emphasize. In this work, process refers to all steps (catalytic and non-catalytic) required to make a product.
Potential improvement opportunities beyond business as usual (BAU) were grouped by;
•
II, incremental improvements, small technology advances (e.g. more selective/durable catalysts, optimized reactors, etc.)
•
BPT, best practiced technologies, widespread deployment of the best technology demonstrated at scale
•
ET, emerging technologies, step-change advances that could realistically be commercialized (e.g. replacement of steam cracking by catalytic process, methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process)
•
Game-changers, paradigm shift in the process (e.g. omit intermediate steps, alternative feedstocks, changing basic mechanisms).
In this work, potential energy savings below are given in exajoules (1018 J, similar to quadrillion BTUs) and petajoules (1015 J) and GHGs are given in millions and billions of metric tons of CO2 equivalent (Mt CO2e, Gt CO2e respectively).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Industry-wide opportunities and impact
There are thousands of products made by the chemical industry, yet 18 products account for 80% of the energy use and 75% of the GHGs. Some 130 different processes can be used to make those 18 products signaling the complexity of technology use. Fig. 1 shows that five large-volume products dominate the energy use landscape. In this figure, the size of the bubble represents relative GHG emissions as millions of CO2e tons. Ammonia leads the way on energy use, which is understandable from a production volume perspective as 50% of the world's food production relies on ammonia-based fertilizers. While ethylene is primarily made by steam cracking today, there is progress on catalytic routes, including demonstration plants using catalysts for conversion of naphtha.

Fig. 1. Energy use of top 18 chemical products [1], [2].
The total energy used to make these top 18 products is expected to more than double in the BAU case as chemical production goes up 2–3 times to meet market needs (Fig. 2) such as in high growth renewables. The potential reductions across all segments noted above could nearly offset the growth. Here the BPT conservative scenario assumes a portion of plants upgrade to BPT whereas the optimistic assumes all plants (new and retrofits) achieve BPT.

The potential reductions in GHGs are shown in Fig. 3. Similarly, the GHG emissions are expected to climb as production grows globally. For some chemical processes, non-energy related GHG emissions are unavoidable as the chemistry instrinsically generates GHGs. Examples would be the stochiometric generation of CO2 during ammonia production from natural gas where 1 ton of CO2 is produced per ton of ammonia. This is represented by the black line in Fig. 3.

Compared to BAU, incremental improvements could reduce energy use 20% and GHGs 15% resulting in a savings of 5.3 EJ and 380 Mt of CO2e by 2050. Increased adoption of BPT (conservative case) could give an additional impact of 6.6 EJ and 560 Mt CO2e by the same time period. Yet, accelerated BPT adoption is not easy, straight-forward, or quick. The most cost-effective way to implement BPT is during the building of new facilities. Hence, during the current wave of facility construction and subsequent waves (likely with newer technology) it is important that the right investment environment exist for BPT adoption. With catalyst cycle times being years and the need to avoid downstream consequences, it can take more than 5 years just to adopt simple catalyst improvements (those without process changes).
Improvements in emerging technologies could add to the potential energy savings and emissions reductions. For example, the impact of replacing steam cracking by catalytic cracking for naphtha-based facilities is shown as the pink line in Fig. 2, Fig. 3. Catalytic olefin technologies can run at lower temperatures, have improved selectivity to desired products, and have lower coke deposits [5]. Recent progress has been made regarding traditional hurdles. Still, further improvements are needed before the technology becomes economically and technically attractive at scale. Emerging technologies face a daunting development path from the laboratory to industrial scale and the development risks are higher.
Game-changers re-invent the way something is done. As they entail much greater risk, have more unknowns, and are a much larger step-change in use of science and technology they can have development periods stretching across professional careers of many scientists and engineers. Initially, improvments in one area for game-changers can result in worse performance vs. BPT in another area. For example, renewable hydrogen can replace natural gas produced H2 for ammonia and methanol production [1], [2]. GHGs associated with production would go down, assuming renewable H2 results in negligible CO2, whereas the energy use would go up as the current efficiency of processes is worse than estabilished methods. Catalysis can play an essential role by enabling alternative reaction pathways. The impact of game-changers was not included in Fig. 2, Fig. 3 due to their uncertainty, but their impact can be found in the roadmap for several case studies.
Energy efficiency improvements across all segments could save as much as 13 EJ and 1 gigaton (Gt) of CO2e per year by 2050. That is more primary energy than used by the country of Germany in 2012. Achieving these deep energy and emissions cuts will require development and deployment of emerging technologies. Further step changes will require game-changers that make sweeping changes in the way that these top products are made. It will also require a revival in R&D for catalysis and separations for top chemical processes.
GHG emissions from chemical processes are strongly connected to the energy used as shown in the U.S. chemical industry data in Fig. 4 [6]. The GHG emissions have dropped considerably despite production increasing over this time period. The largest portion of the GHG emissions is from fuel and power usage. Hence, energy efficiency gains would lower the process GHG emissions footprint and contribute to a footprint reduction of the industry as a whole. VOC and NOx emissions have also been reduced over this time period [6] and improvements in efficiency and selectivity would lead to a lower footprint. Lower power needs/unit of production would also reduce NOx emissions as the majority of this pollutant comes from power production.

The improvement needs of across key chemical processes have been described previously and include a combination of specific process improvements and capability needs [7], [8], [9]. These prior reports and roadmap highlight the opportunities and while market transitions suggest some tailoring of the path the high-level recommendations are still valid. To make additional progress for top energy consuming reactions, next steps include clearly describing the fundamental hurdles in a way that R&D collaborations can consider how to address them and identifying a small number of processes with the highest potential for improvement vs. the effort needed.
3.2. Partial oxidation opportunities
In the lower left of Fig. 1 there are several oxidation processes (including PO, EO). It was noted earlier that many of the processes with large non-selectivity losses relative to theoretical energy use are related to over-oxidation to by-products [10]. While many of these oxidation processes utilize an alkene feedstock, starting with an alkane precursor may offer an economic advantage so there has been considerable research on direct alkane activation routes to chemical intermediates [11], [12]. These reactions are difficult to control from a selectivity perspective. Recent life cycle assessments (LCA) of two of these processes, propane to acrylic acid and acrylonitrile, suggest that both routes could decrease the environmental impact relative to propylene based routes once catalyst selectivities are improved [13], [14]. Propane related catalysis is covered here to illustrate the R&D status and opportunity for catalytic improvements. It should be noted that successful commercialization of propane activation to intermediates will only have limited impact on propylene consumption as more than 60% of propylene produced goes into polypropylene [3].
Propylene has traditionally been sourced from steam cracking or as a by-product from refining operations. The rapid development of North American shale gas has led to increased steam cracking of ethane, which results in less propylene by-product than naphtha cracking. Propylene demand growth is projected to outpace by-product production, and on-purpose propylene processes will be needed to bridge that gap [3]. While propane dehydrogenation (PDH) offers a solution for propylene availability and flexibility, propane conversion is equilibrium limited and the catalyst suffers from coking. For these reasons, propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH, Scheme 1) offers potential advantages over PDH, although it is still not industrially viable. Because the alkene is more reactive toward oxygen than the alkane, propylene yields from propane ODH are much lower than those in PDH, and improved propylene selectivity at higher propane conversions has been an area of considerable ODH catalyst and process R&D [11]. A fundamental hurdle here (highlighting R&D needs as mentioned in section 3.2) is “how can the higher reactivity of propylene vs. propane to oxygen be mitigated?” Routes to weaker binding of propylene have been noted along with requirements for reactor setups that would limit back mixing [15]. Viewed from the activation angle [16], a hurdle would be “how to activate the methylene C-H bond in propane in preference to the allylic CH in propylene?”

Scheme 1. Selective oxidation of propane.
A previous review of propane ODH catalysts pointed to the potential of mixed metal oxides containing vanadium, molybdenum, and tungsten as being suitable candidates for further performance optimization [11]. Kinetic studies suggest that those catalysts with more reducible metal centers tend to be more active and that less acidic metal oxides produce higher propylene yields due to more facile CH bond activation. However, strongly basic metal oxides can result in slower desorption of propylene, increasing the potential for further oxidation to COx [16]. Addition of promoter elements offers an additional lever for tuning catalyst performance, with electronegative promoters increasing catalyst activity while basic promoters offer a means to improve the propylene selectivity [17], [18]. As such, there is a large number of potential compositional targets to evaluate, and high throughput methods have been employed to synthesize and screen several catalyst families [19]. Utilization of this approach in a new catalyst discovery effort allowed the screening of binary combinations among 30 promoter elements for four mixed metal oxide families in less than three months (more than 1100 catalysts). Results for eight cases, two from each family, are shown in Fig. 5; the study was reported in more detail previously [19].

Fig. 5. Comparison of results for four discovery catalyst families for propane ODH [19].
Although a large compositional space was probed via high throughput testing, none of the catalyst formulations studied showed a step-change improvement over previously studied catalyst system. Of the various mixed metal oxide families, the molybdate family gave the best propylene yields under the screening conditions (400–450 °C, 10% O2, 30% propane). Further process optimization was done to better understand the performance characteristics of the formulations. Again under the process conditions explored, the molybdate family showed the highest selectivities to propylene especially under mild reaction temperatures and intermediate O2/C3H8 feed ratios. In general, the results show that while various promoters can be used to increase yield, selectivity and conversion are inversely related for the elemental compositions screened. While the high throughput work was done with unsupported bulk mixed metal oxides, recent assessments of the performance of highly dispersed VxOy type catalysts for propane ODH also pointed to the large performance gap that needs to be addressed for those systems to be industrially viable [15], [20]. Propane ODH remains an active area of research where identification of key hurdles and routes to lower them could accelerate progress. It is also an example of continued research to deploy technology with higher selectivity and lower emissions while driving for economic thresholds that would enable implementation.
Process intensification by linking propylene technologies may provide opportunities for further energy improvements. Since the boiling points of propylene and propane are very similar, separation of propylene from propane via distillation is capital and energy intensive. Integrated processes where the exit streams from either propane dehydrogenation or propane oxidative dehydrogenation feed directly into the first oxidation (acrolein) reactor in a current acrylic acid process may offer an opportunity to avoid the costly propylene separation step. For these applications, the ODH process is particularly well suited as the safety issues of either feeding H2 to an oxidation reactor and/or the need to separate H2 prior to the acrolein reactor could in principle be avoided [21]. In general, separation processes account for nearly 40% of the energy usage in the chemical industry [22] and developing novel alternatives to current separation processes offers further strategies to reduce energy and emissions in the chemical industry.
4. Conclusions
The chemical industry faces challenges in increasing its solutions for societal needs while minimizing the emissions and waste footprint. A recent global industry roadmap points the way to reducing energy use (13 EJ by 2050) and GHG emissions (1 gigatons by 2050) for 18 large volume processes via incremental improvements, best practiced technology, emerging technology and game changers. Investment and renewal in industrial catalysis is vital to realize these improvements. Hurdles in catalysis and downstream processing vary by process, but there are some commonalities such as separating products before additional reactions occur. Research in partial oxidations such as oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is providing insights to control the reaction and improve yield.
