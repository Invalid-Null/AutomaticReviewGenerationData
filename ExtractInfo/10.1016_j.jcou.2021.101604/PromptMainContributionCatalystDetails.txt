1. Introduction
The worldwide demand for olefins is growing as they are considered key components of the chemical industry [1,2]. Currently, the main processes for olefin production are steam cracking, fluid-catalytic-cracking (FCC), and catalytic dehydrogenation (DH). It has been predicted that the supply from refinery FCC and steam-crackers will not cover future demand. Nowadays, DH as an economically attractive technology fills the gap [1]. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is an energy-saving alternative to these technologies. Molecular oxygen effectively suppresses coke formation, which is a major obstacle in DH, but only low propene selectivities are obtained. Thus, the industrial implementation, e.g. of propane ODH, is still hampered owing to low propylene yields [2,3]. More recently, the potential of carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has been evaluated towards the problems of greenhouse-gas emissions and the increasing energy demand [[4], [5], [6]] e.g. by employing carbon dioxide (CO2) as a carbon source.
In the context of high-temperature ODH reactions, CO2 has received considerable attention as a mild oxidant, preventing deep oxidation thereby increasing olefin selectivities. [[7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]] Hence the use of CO2 as an oxidant in ODH is attractive due to its abundance but suffers from its chemical inertness. [7,9,10,13] Previous studies have shown that supported transition metal oxides like chromia [[14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]], gallium oxide [14], vanadia [[21], [22], [23], [24], [25]], as well as ceria-based systems [25,26] are catalytically active in propane ODH with CO2. The respective catalytic activity shows a strong dependency on the nature of the support. Michorczyk et al. systematically compared the activity of chromia deposited on different silica supports like conventional SiO2, hexagonal SBA-15, and cubic SBA-1 in the presence and absence of CO2. [17] In a subsequent study, the influence of chromium content deposited on SBA-1 was investigated in more detail [18]. For a loading of 7 wt. % Cr, a maximum conversion of 37.7 % and a selectivity of 85.0 % was reported at 550 °C. In situ UV–vis measurements performed during CO2 ODH provided insights into the redox behavior of the present Cr species, allowing for a mechanistic discussion of possible oxidative and nonoxidative pathways, showing that Cr6+ species were rapidly reduced to Cr3+/Cr2+. The authors proposed chromia in its oxidized state to operate in ODH, and reduced Cr sites to be responsible for nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane.
More recently, Ascoop et al. studied the ODH of propane over WOx-VOx/SiO2 catalysts, [27] both experimentally and theoretically, and proposed the reaction to proceed simultaneously via direct ODH and a two-step pathway, including propane dehydrogenation (DH) followed by the reversewater-gas shift reaction (rWGS). Nevertheless, owing to its complexity, the role of CO2 in ODH reactions and, in particular, its influence on the structural dynamics of the catalyst is largely unexplored. To further enhance the mechanistic understanding and to develop structure-activity relationships as a basis for a rational catalyst design, operando methods have been widely applied to ODH reactions. [[28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]] Recently, we have employed UV resonance Raman spectroscopy to elucidate the structural dynamics of supported vanadia catalysts during ethanol and propane ODH, demonstrating the high sensitivity of the technique for detailed catalyst and adsorbate characterization [33,[29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]]. The possibilities and limits of UV Raman spectroscopy in the context of heterogeneous catalysis have previously been discussed in reviews [[36], [37], [38]].
In this communication, we address mechanistic aspects of propane ODH over silica supported vanadia (VOx/SiO2) catalysts using CO2 as oxidizing agent. Operando UV resonance Raman spectroscopy is employed in combination with gas chromatography (GC) to elucidate the structural dynamics of the catalyst surface under propane ODH conditions, which is not accessible by visible laser excitation. To gain additional insight into the reaction mechanism, operando Raman spectra were also recorded during propane DH and the rWGS reaction. Based on our findings we discuss the role of the oxidizing agent in propane to propylene conversion.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Mesoporous silica SBA-15 was prepared as described previously in detail [39,40], by mixing 4.0 g of Pluronic P123 (EO20PO70EO20, BASF) with 120 mL of 2 M HCl and 30 mL deionized water in a polypropylene bottle at 35 °C and subsequent addition of 8.5 g of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, Sigma-Aldrich, 99 %). After heating in an oven at 85 °C for 24 h, the suspension was filtered and calcined at 550 °C for 12 h in ambient air by applying a heating ramp of 1.5 °C/min. For vanadium deposition on the silica SBA-15 support, incipient wetness impregnation [41] was employed, by mixing vanadium(V) oxytriisopropoxide (97 %, Sigma Aldrich) with anhydrous 2-propanol (99.5 %) in a glove box and drop-wise addition of the solution to the support while pulverizing in an agate mortar. Subsequently, the yellow powders were calcined in an oven at 550 °C for 12 h with a heating rate of 1.5 °C/min. This material will be referred to as VOx/SiO2. For the investigations 200–300 μm sieve fractions were used.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Nitrogen adsorption-desorption experiments were performed on a Nova Station A (Quantachrome Instruments). Prior to the measurements the samples were evacuated for 24 h at 150 °C. The specific surface area was determined based on nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms by applying the standard multipoint BET (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) model. Two charges were synthesized exhibiting surface areas of 604 and 617 m2/g, corresponding to a vanadia density of 0.6 V/nm2. Note that the two samples showed no significant differences in their properties.
UV–vis spectroscopic measurements were performed on a Jasco V-770 UV–vis/NIR spectrometer, employing a halogen and a deuterium lamp for excitation. Spectra were taken within 200−1100 nm at a resolution of 0.5 nm. SBA-15 was used as a white standard.
2.3. Catalytic tests
Catalytic tests were performed in a reactor (CCR1000, Linkam Scientific Instruments Ltd.) at temperatures between 320 and 593 °C after dehydrating the catalyst for one hour in helium, by a stepwise increase of the temperature without any re-oxidation steps. Two measurements were performed at each temperature. Specified temperatures are measured via a thermocouple at the bottom of the sample bed. The ceramic sample holder was loaded with about 15 mg of VOx/SiO2 sample on a ceramic fiber fleece. The reactor was applied in a fluidized bed mode [42], ensuring constant mixing of the particles from the hotter bottom to the cooler surface. The reaction feed consisted of 12.5 % C3H8/12.5 % CO2/He and 12.5 % C3H8/He at a total flow of 40 mL/min. Prior to reactive conditions, the catalysts were dehydrated for one hour. Gas-phase analysis was performed online using an Agilent 7890B Series gas chromatograph. The gas components were separated by two columns, a HP-Plot Q (30m × 0.535 mm × 40 μm) and a CP-Molsieve 5A (25 m × 0.53 mm × 50 μm), which are connected in series, followed by the detection via a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). The conversion and selectivity were determined based on the detected amounts of reactants and products (see Supporting Information). The carbon deficit was <3.6 % for DH and <1 % for ODH conditions.
2.4. Operando Raman spectroscopy
Raman spectra were recorded in a backscattering geometry on a triple-stage spectrometer (Princeton Instruments, TriVista 555) equipped with a nitrogen-cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Spec 10:2kBUV) and calibrated with mercury spectral lamp. The resolution of the spectrometer was 1 cm−1. The excitation was performed with 256.7 nm laser radiation using a titanium-sapphire (Ti:Sa) solid state laser (Indigo-S, Coherent) and anisotropic BBO and LBO crystals for frequency multiplication. The laser power was adjusted to 8.8–8.9 mW at the location of the sample. The use of a Linkam cell reactor in fluidized-bed mode prevented potential sample heating and/or damage caused by the UV laser excitation. Details of the Raman spectrometer can be found elsewhere. [33,43] The data was processed via Matlab R2015a, which included background subtraction, smoothing with a moving-average filter, and merging. The fit analysis of the vanadyl feature was performed by using Voigt functions.
For operando measurements, the output of the cell reactor was connected to the online gas chromatograph for continuous gas-phase detection. Prior to operando experiments a pretreatment procedure was applied. The catalyst was dehydrated for 1 h at 502 °C under oxidative conditions (12.5 % O2/He). Raman spectra were taken after increasing the temperature to 547 °C. After flushing the reactor and tubes with He, the catalyst was reduced with 7.5 % H2/Ar and pre-oxidized with 12.5 % CO2/He. Operando conditions consisted of 12.5 % C3H8/12.5 % CO2/He. Afterwards, the sample was regenerated under a flow of 12.5 % CO2/He. Operando conditions for propane DH consisted of 12.5 % C3H8/He and those for the rWGS reaction of 6.5 % H2/12.5 % CO2/Ar.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 depicts the temperature-dependent catalytic performance of the VOx/SiO2 catalyst in propane dehydrogenation with and without the presence of CO2 at a total flow rate of 40 mL/min. The catalyst shows catalytic activity between 450 and 600 °C with a maximum propane conversion of around 3 % for ODH and 5–6 % for DH. The larger DH values may be attributed to the higher He concentration in the feed, considering its high thermal conductivity; to this end, a dependence of sample temperature on the presence of the inert (He vs N2) was confirmed in separate experiments. At the above conversion levels, propene selectivities >92 % are detected. In order to determine the background activity, the procedure was repeated with an empty reaction cell, resulting in conversions <0.5 % with selectivities <52 %. During DH, ethane, ethylene, and methane were detected besides propylene and H2. The detection of significant amounts of CO during CO2 ODH is a strong indicator for the participation of CO2 in the overall ODH reaction (see SI). As the amount of converted propane exceeded the amount of converted CO2, either propane dehydrogenation occurs in parallel or a two-step pathway with DH followed by the rWGS reaction takes place. As indicated in Fig. 1, for the operando UV Raman experiments described in the following, a reaction temperature of 547 °C was chosen. Details of the catalytic performance under operando conditions are summarized in Table S1.

Lines are to guide the eye.
Fig. 2 depicts a series of in situ/operando UV Raman spectra (256.7 nm) of the VOx/SiO2 catalyst at a reaction temperature of 547 °C in different gas atmospheres. As a pretreatment (see experimental section), the catalyst was first dehydrated (O2/He), then reduced (H2/Ar) and finally re-oxidized (CO2/He) to prepare a reproducible reference state of the catalyst for propane ODH with CO2. The operando spectrum recorded under reaction conditions shows a distinct spectral signature, which is different to the reduced state (H2/Ar) and the oxidized state (CO2/He). The spectrum recorded after re-oxidation in CO2 (CO2/He, After) resembles that obtained prior to reaction (CO2/He, Prior), indicating that the starting state of the catalyst is largely restored. As a quantitative measure of reduction, analysis of the vanadyl (VO) feature at 1033 cm−1 reveals a decrease in intensity to 42 % for reducing (H2/Ar) and to 55 % for reaction conditions, as compared to the original state (O2/He). While the assignment of the vibrational features will be discussed in the following, we can state at this point that UV Raman spectroscopy has the sensitivity to detect structural changes of the catalyst as a function of the gas environment. Moreover, each catalyst state is represented by a vibrational signature specific to the applied gas composition.

Fig. 2. Operando 256.7 nm Raman spectra of the VOx/SiO2 catalyst. The experiment included a pretreatment procedure with 7.5 % H2 in Ar as described in the text. Reaction conditions consisted of 12.5 % C3H8/12.5 % CO2/He. The catalyst was re-oxidized with 12.5 % CO2/He before and after the reaction. For better visibility, the hydroxyl region is plotted with an offset.
To analyze the spectral profiles in more detail, Fig. 3 shows UV Raman spectra normalized to the vanadyl signal at 1033 cm−1 (a) and the signal at 608 cm−1 (b). This presentation allows a comparison of different catalyst states under oxidizing (O2 vs CO2) and reducing/reaction (H2 vs C3H8/CO2) conditions. As reference for both series, we use the spectrum in CO2/He prior to reaction. In the presence of CO2, typical gas-phase CO2 Raman signals are detected at 1264, 1285, 1388, and 1409 cm−1, which originate from a Fermi resonance (1285 and 1388 cm−1) and their corresponding hot band features (1264 and 1409 cm−1). [44] The Raman signals at around 860 and 2900 cm−1 (see Figs. 2, 3, and S2) can be attributed to gas-phase propane by comparison with the gas-phase spectrum of propane measured under the same conditions. The omnipresent signal at 1580 cm-1 originates from gas-phase oxygen contributions accumulated outside the in situ/operando cell. The region between 1700 and 3600 cm−1 is omitted from the following discussion as there are no further signals of relevance for the mechanistic discussion but is shown in the SI (see Fig. S2).

Spectra were normalized to VO. b) Direct comparison of the hydrogen-reduced state with the Raman spectrum obtained under operando conditions. The position of the D2 band of SBA-15 at 608 cm−1 was used as a reference point for normalization. For better visibility, the hydroxyl region is plotted with an offset.
The top panel of Fig. 3 depicts Raman spectra of the VOx/SiO2 catalyst in oxidizing gas atmospheres. The spectra are characterized by vanadia-related features at around 550/695, 915 (sh), 1033, and 1150 cm−1, which originate from VOV, VOSi (in phase interphase), VO, and VOM (MSi, V) (combination) stretching modes, respectively, as reported previously in the literature. [33] More detailed analysis reveals that there are additional features at around 465 and 1070 cm−1, which result from VOSi and VOSi (out-of-phase interphase) stretching, respectively, as discussed in detail before. [45] As a result of UV laser excitation at 256.7 nm, surface vanadia-related features are resonantly enhanced in comparison to the silica support, significantly increasing the sensitivity of Raman spectroscopy towards structural analysis of the surface vanadia species. From the UV Raman analysis in combination with UV–vis spectra we can conclude that under oxidizing conditions surface vanadia is mainly present as dispersed dimeric/small oligomeric species, while monomers cannot be excluded. Please note that we can rule out the presence of microcrystalline V2O5 due to the absence of its characteristic signals (e.g. 995 cm−1). [46,47]
To allow for a better comparison of the spectral profiles, the spectra in the top panel of Fig. 3 were normalized to the vanadyl (VO) signal, showing good agreement of the vanadia surface structure after oxidation of the catalyst using either O2 or CO2 as oxidizing agent, as probed by UV Raman. Turning to reducing/reaction conditions, the bottom panel of Fig. 3 compares the Raman spectrum of the VOx/SiO2 catalyst in H2/Ar (orange) and C3H8/CO2/He (red) atmosphere. During the hydrogen treatment, the catalyst is significantly reduced as indicated by the smaller VO intensity compared to the CO2/He reference spectrum, while the decreased VOV signals at around 550 cm−1 and 695 cm−1 are indicative of partial VOV bond breakage and thus a reduction in the degree of surface vanadia oligomerization. Upon exposure to H2/Ar, an additional feature at 3738 cm−1 is observed, which is readily assigned to SiOH stretching vibrations of isolated surface hydroxyl groups. [33,48] The operando Raman spectrum recorded during propane ODH (with CO2) represents an intermediate state between those referenced by the H2/Ar and CO2/He atmospheres. Interestingly, the degree of reduction appears to be related to the intensity of the SiO-H signal, which shows a small but reproducible dependence on the gas atmosphere. The presence of CO in the outlet gas phase suggests that CO2 is constantly re-oxidizing the catalyst during the reaction. Comparison of the operando Raman spectrum to that obtained in CO2/He (here “prior to reaction”), reveals a significant lower intensity within the region 430–800 cm−1, which corresponds to VOV and VOSi bonds. These findings are supported by the absence of carbonaceous species, which would be expected at around 1350 and 1600 cm−1. [49,50] For additional mechanistic insights also other reactions pathways (DH, rWGS) were investigated using UV Raman spectroscopy as described in the following.
Fig. 4 depicts operando UV Raman spectra (256.7 nm) of the VOx/SiO2 catalyst under DH and rWGS conditions at a reaction temperature of 547 °C. The catalytic performance is summarized in Table S1. Please note that during DH the catalyst turns immediately grey, which would largely prevent an operando analysis using visible Raman spectroscopy, in contrast to UV laser excitation. For DH, a higher conversion of propane molecules was observed as in the presence of CO2 (see Fig. 1). As shown in the top panel of Fig. 4, the operando Raman spectrum recorded under DH conditions strongly resembles the hydrogen-reduced state (H2/Ar), indicating that there are no major structural differences between the surface vanadia species. This is confirmed by the comparable vanadyl and hydroxyl signals. In contrast, in the presence of CO2, an intermediate state with structural differences is observed. As expected, under DH conditions, carbon deposits are detected at around 1600 cm−1 (see Fig. 4).

Fig. 4. Operando 256.7 nm Raman spectra of the VOx/SiO2 catalyst in a) propane DH (12.5 % C3H8/87.5 % He) and b) rWGS (6.5 % H2/12.5 % CO2/Ar), compared with the hydrogen-reduced and the re-oxidized state.
The rWGS experiment allows the comparison of the hydrogen-reduced state with and without CO2. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 4, the catalyst adopts an intermediate state under reaction conditions, somewhat similar to the ODH with CO2, which is further confirmed by the SiOH signal. We therefore conclude that CO2 constantly re-oxidizes the catalyst during the reaction. Based on the relative intensity of the vanadyl signal, the presence of hydrogen leads to a more reducing environment as compared to propane (see Fig. 3), which cannot be fully compensated by the presence of CO2.
These complementary operando experiments confirm that CO2 participates in the overall reaction network of the propane ODH with CO2. The conversion of propane may proceed via two reaction pathways, i.e., direct ODH (one-step) and DH coupled with a subsequent RWGS reaction (two-step), as the operando Raman spectra and the catalytic results are consistent with both channels.
3.1. Mechanistic discussion
In the following discussion, besides the role of CO2, we will address the question, whether the overall propane ODH reaction proceeds via a one-step (ODH) and/or a two-step (DH and rWGS) pathway. The catalytic data confirms that CO2 successfully participated in the overall ODH reaction over the VOx/SiO2 catalyst. During dehydrogenation without the assistance of CO2, almost no CO was detected. Hence, the observed CO production is related to the activation of CO2. Moreover, the amount of detected H2 was significantly reduced, indicating that either ODH and DH occur in parallel or that the mechanism follows a two-step pathway with a subsequent rWGS reaction.
According to the Raman experiments the hydrogen-reduced state can be related to surface vanadia species with low nuclearity, containing reduced vanadium (3+/4+) and possibly H attached to vanadyl and/or bridging oxygen, i.e., lattice oxygen, and even interface oxygen sites (VOSi) (see Fig. 5). In the context of re-oxidation with CO2, previous studies by Haija et al. [51] on CO2 adsorption on V2O3(0001) via temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (IRAS) are of interest. Below 200 K, CO2 adsorbed molecularly on vanadyl terminated V2O3(0001). Electron irradiation led to the removal of vanadyl oxygen and subsequent binding of CO2 to vanadium, forming surface CO2-species, resulting in the formation of vanadyl groups and CO. In this context, it is worth mentioning that, according to DFT results for VOx/SiO2 by Rozanska et al. [52], N2O is not able to re-oxidize V(+4) sites, a result which might be transferable to CO2. Based on these literature findings, it appears reasonable that re-oxidation of reduced vanadia occurs via CO2 adsorption on V3+ and recovery of the vanadyl bond, accompanied by CO formation. Considering recent work on re-oxidation of reduced VOx by CO2, this process is expected to be slow on the timescale of the operando experiment. [25,27] As a consequence, the vanadyl signal shows a decreased intensity during propane ODH with CO2 in comparison to the signal after CO2 re-oxidation (see Fig. 2). In contrast, during propane DH, a highly reduced vanadia catalyst is formed, showing a different spectroscopic signature (see Fig. 4). Thus, we can rule out the occurrence of ODH in parallel to DH (without further oxidation). Besides, CO2 treatment after propane DH was able to largely re-oxidize vanadyl (not shown). In fact, our operando spectroscopic findings are fully consistent with the parallel occurrence of both pathways, i.e., direct ODH (one step) and dehydrogenation followed by a reverse water-gas shift reaction (two step).

Fig. 5. Proposed reaction mechanism for propane ODH with CO2 over VOx/SiO2 catalysts.
Theoretical modelling by Ascoop et al. assumed VOV bridging oxygen of dimers to be responsible for the second H-abstraction from the initially formed propyl radical. [27] The presence of dimers/small oligomers is in agreement with our operando results. During reaction conditions, the amount of VOV decreased compared to the oxidized state (see bottom of Fig. 2), pointing to a decrease in the degree of oligomerization. These structural changes are proposed to be accompanied by the attachment of hydrogen atoms to vanadyl. Moreover, the presence of hydrogen in the reduced/reactive states of the catalyst surface was evidenced spectroscopically by the detection of silanol groups (SiOH), indicating the breakage of VOSi bond [53].
4. Conclusions
A detailed understanding of propane ODH is of academic and industrial interest. To gain direct mechanistic insight into propane ODH over VOx/SiO2 catalysts using CO2 as mild oxidant we employed operando Raman spectroscopy. We demonstrate the sensitivity of UV Raman spectroscopy to monitor the structural dynamics of the surface vanadia as a function of gas-phase composition and to provide mechanistic information on the overall propane ODH reaction network.
Switching from oxidizing to reducing/reaction conditions affects VO, VOV and VOSi bonds, whose oxygen atoms are responsible for the hydrogen abstraction during the reaction. Under reaction conditions, we observe mainly dimeric/small oligomeric vanadia species with part of the vanadyl reduced, which may support the increased selectivity by limiting the amount of oxygen inducing deep oxidation. Using CO2, vanadyl can be re-oxidized to the state prior reaction.
In comparison to propane ODH, during propane DH conditions the presence of carbon deposits and higher degree of reduction is observed, while the operando signature of the rWGS reaction rather resembles that of propane ODH. As CO2 is shown to enable vanadyl oxidation, our operando results are fully consistent with the occurrence of two parallel pathways, i.e., direct ODH (one step) and dehydrogenation followed by a reverse water-gas shift reaction (two step).
