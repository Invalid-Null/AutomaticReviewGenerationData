 Based on my analysis, this document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation to produce propylene. The document discusses a Pt-Sn alloy catalyst for the transformation of cyclohexene to benzene and cyclohexane, which does not involve propane or propylene.
