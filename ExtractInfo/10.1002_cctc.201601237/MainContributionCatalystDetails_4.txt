 on reviewing the document, this does not appear to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) for converting propane to propylene. The document focuses on developing reaction kinetics for partial oxidation and steam reforming of propane over rhodium/alumina catalysts. While propylene formation is briefly mentioned, the focus is not on optimizing propylene yield through PDH or ODH catalysis.
