Graphical Abstract
Another step in the dance: A multi-step surface reaction mechanism for partial oxidation and steam reforming of CH4 and C3H8 and oxidation of H2 and CO as well the water–gas–shift reaction over Rh/Al2O3 catalysts is presented.

Abstract
A multi-step surface reaction mechanism for partial oxidation and steam reforming of propane over Rh/Al2O3 catalysts is presented. The mechanism is also applicable to model reactions of the subsystems H2/CO/H2O/CO2/O2/CH4. A stagnation–flow reactor with a catalytically coated disk is used to determine the surface reaction rate and spatial concentration profiles on top of the catalytic plate using a micro-probe sampling technique. The reactor configuration facilitates one-dimensional modeling of coupled diffusive and convective transport within the gas-phase boundary layer coupled with detailed heterogeneous chemistry models of the zero-dimensional surface. The reaction system is studied at varying inlet concentrations and temperatures. The established reaction kinetics are furthermore tested by simulation of autothermal reforming of propane in an annular reactor previously described by Pagani.
Introduction
Propane is one of the most abundant species in natural gas (0.1–1.5 vol. %) used for domestic and industrial purposes.1 It can be liquefied at approximately 9 bar, which enables easy storage and transportation. Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is used as an alternative transportation fuel in many applications around the world.1, 2 Propane can also be used as chemical feedstock, for example, upon catalytic conversion to synthesis gas by either partial oxidation or steam reforming. Several catalysts such as Ni,3-5 Pt,6 Rh,7, 8 or bi-metals such as Ru-Ni, Mg-Ni9 are used for propane reforming. Rhodium in particular is a very suitable catalyst as shown literature first by Huff et al. in millisecond-contact-time reactors under auto-thermal operating conditions at 1273–1473 K.10 Similarly, Beretta and Forzatti have studied partial oxidation of propane over a Rh catalyst in an isothermal annular duct type reactor.11 Partial oxidation of C3H8 over Rh includes total oxidation and steam reforming of C3H8 in a subsequent way.
Silberova et al. studied partial oxidation and oxidative steam reforming of C3H8 over Rh impregnated Al2O3 foam catalysts.8a They found an optimal reaction temperature of 973 K for hydrogen production. Waller et al. determined a molar C/O ratio of 0.94 and temperatures above 1173 K as optimum for propane reforming and better catalyst stability at high temperatures (1023 K) due to decreased carbon formation propensity at high temperatures.12
Pagani et al.13 studied partial oxidation as well as steam reforming of propane over a 2 wt.% Rh/α-Al2O3 catalyst. The effects of the flow rate as well as the reaction temperature were investigated. The results were also used to derive a kinetic model considering the total, partial oxidation and steam reforming of C3H8, water gas-shift, reverse water-gas shift and methanation reactions as well as total oxidation of CO and H2. The model predicted the primary gas-phase species H2, CO, CO2, H2O. The experiments showed that C2H4 and C3H6 are formed only at the high temperature regimes. However, even at these high temperatures regimes, the concentrations do not exceed the ppm level. The experimental data of their thorough study were used for additional evaluation of the micro kinetic model proposed in our present study as discussed below.
Chueh et al. studied the partial oxidation of propane over Rh and Pt catalysts under fuel rich conditions.6 More specifically, the effects of catalyst morphological changes on the catalytic activity were examined. The catalytic measurements were carried out in a laboratory scale flow reactor at low temperatures, 723–923 K. The selective reaction paths between the total oxidation and the partial oxidation were found to strongly depend on the metal particle size. Complete oxidation rather than partial oxidation products was primarily observed on large particles.
Donazzi et al.8b studied the effect of pressure in the autothermal reforming of CH4 and C3H8 by resolving the temperature and species profiles axially. Initial C/O is varied between 0.85–0.82. The experiments were conducted over a 2 wt.% 400 cpsi monolithic Rh/α-Al2O3 catalyst at the pressure ranges of 1–4 bar. Their study showed that unlike for methane reforming, the effect of pressure can be significant for propane reforming. Increasing pressure increases the contribution of the gas-phase cracking to form CH4 and C2+ olefins which can further lead to coke formation. They also derived kinetic data to predict axial concentration and temperature profiles.
Zyryanova et al.14 studied low temperature propane reforming under steam rich conditions with a molar carbon/steam ratio of C/S=0.39 finding with full conversion of propane at the temperatures below 623 K reaching the equilibrium methane conversion.
Schädel et al. have studied steam reforming of C3H8 over a technical Rh/Al2O3 catalyst in a monolithic structure.15 By using the experimental data which are derived from a continuous-flow reactor, they extended a surface reaction mechanism for catalytic partial oxidation of methane by a global reaction step to account for conversion of propane.16 When Hartmann et al. modelled their experiments on partial oxidation of isooctane over rhodium-coated monoliths, a multi-step surface reaction mechanism for C1–C3 species was included, but the C3H8 reactions were not specifically evaluated.17
So far, no detailed surface reaction kinetics has been proposed for partial oxidation and steam reforming of C3H8 that includes kinetics for the subsystems of reactions of H2/CO/H2O/CO2/O2/CH4 over rhodium-based catalysts. For rhodium/alumina catalysts, we recently developed step-wise surface reaction kinetics for the oxidation of hydrogen18 and CO,19 water–gas–shift reaction,20 as well as oxidation and reforming of methane.21 In this hierarchical development procedure as summarized by Figure 1, the more complex reaction kinetics used the former developed kinetics of the subsystems without any modification under the constraint of thermodynamic consistency.

The hierarchical methodology of the development of the surface reaction kinetics.
In the present study, the 48-step mechanism of the H2/CO/H2O/CO2/O2/CH4 system21 is extended by additional 14 reactions to account for partial oxidation and steam reforming of propane. The initial reaction steps for propane oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation reactions are taken from Hartmann et al.17 The rate constants are further adjusted using spatially-resolved species concentration profiles in a stagnation flow on a catalyticylly (Rh/alumina) coated disk derived in the present work (Figure 11). This reactor concept has been especially design for studying heterogeneously catalyst gas-phase kinetics at ambient conditions, where the catalyst presents a zero-dimensional surface, i.e., the gas phase concentration and surface coverages do not depend on the radial local position of the catalytically coated disk.18, 22 The full kinetic scheme is furthermore tested by comparison of measured13 and numerically predicted concentrations at the exit of a Rh/Al2O3 coated annular flow reactor using the newly developed reaction kinetics.
Results and Discussion
The surface reaction mechanism for the system H2/CO/H2O/CO2/O2/CH4 over Rh/Al2O3 consisted of the reactions R1–50 as given in Table 1.21 It is extended by propane adsorption (R51) and desorption (R52) and six further reversible reactions for propane dehydrogenation and oxidation (R53–R62). The kinetic parameters of R53–R62 were adjusted on the basis of the measurements in the stagnation–flow reactor experiment as discussed below. Since no by-products, except CH4, were detected experimentally, reactions of desorption of further species such as C2H2, C2H4, and C3H6 were not included in the mechanism.

Partial oxidation of propane formed CH4 only at ppm level at the operating conditions considered in this study. Earlier studies by Silberova et al.8a, 23 measured CH4 selectivity to be less than 5 % below 1023 K at C/O=0.8. No CH4 formation was reported by Beretta and Forzatti11 under the reaction conditions of C/O=1.5 and temperatures below 1023 K. A more recent study by Pagani et al.13 showed methane concentration being less than 1 % within the temperature ranges of 573–1173 K over a Rh/α-Al2O3 catalyst for C/O=0.89. The methanation reaction may occur in steam reforming of propane strongly depends on the temperature and S/C ratio as within the temperature ranges of 773–873 K as shown for instance by Pagani et al.13
The main source for methanation in the reaction scheme presented here (Figure 1) is the adsorbed CH3 species that reacts with adsorbed hydrogen to form methane. The concentration of the gas-phase CH4 is sensitive to decomposition of C3H6(s) (R61) by which CH3(s) and C2H3(s) species are formed. This sequence relates methane formation to the steam reforming of propane.
The surface reaction kinetics is derived by fine-tuning of the kinetic parameters of R50–R62 to match the experimental results of the stagnation–flow experiments described below.
The nominal value of 1013 is the value calculated from transition state theory (kBT/ħ) with kB is being Boltzmann's constant and ħ is Plank's constant. The initial values of the activation energies are taken from literature.17
The reaction rates of gas-phase species which are measured on the catalyst surface are compared with the calculated reaction rates. Based on the sensitivity analysis, reaction rate parameters (pre-exponential factors and activation energies) of the specific reaction rates are altered within the range of their reference values. During this fine-tuning thermodynamic consistency is always obeyed using the procedure described elsewhere.24
Partial oxidation
The first set of experiments conducted studied the system under partial oxidation conditions, that is, the reactive feed consists of C3H8 and O2 [Eq. 1]. The molar C/O ratio and catalyst temperature are varied. The fuel compositions are chosen to yield stoichiometric, fuel-lean, and fuel-rich conditions (Table 2).

The total gas flow rate is measured to be 16.1 standard liter per minute (slpm), which corresponds to an axial flow velocity of 53 cm s−1 at 313 K at the reactor inlet. To avoid gas-phase reactions, the surface reaction temperature is kept below 973 K which is lower than the ignition temperature of gas-phase reactions.
The boundary-layer concentration profiles of O2, H2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C2H2, and C3H8 are detected simultaneously by means of the MS (for O2), H-Sense (for H2), and FTIR (for C containing species).
Comparisons of the numerical simulations and the experimental data are presented in Figures 5–6. At 823 K and C/O=1.0 (Case 1) no partial oxidation activity was detected. The only reaction products measured on the catalyst surface are the total oxidation products, i.e., CO2 and H2O. This was confirmed by numerical simulations as well (Figure 2). The catalyst always is at position “0”, the inlet approximately 2 cm on top of the catalytic plate, that is, far on the right side of all profiles as discussed in the Experimental Section (Figure 11). The boundary layer on the catalyst is 6 mm thick.

Increasing the reaction temperature to 873 K (Case 2) does not have a significant influence on the conversion of C3H8. However, product distribution significantly changes and the reaction yields the partial oxidation products, i.e., CO and H2. The reaction is kinetically controlled in this regime.
The effect of the inlet fuel composition is investigated by varying the molar C/O ratios (Table 2). Figure 4 reveals the profiles at fuel-rich conditions (C/O=1.25; Case 3) at 883 K. The reaction rate is mass transport limited at those conditions observable by the vanishing O2 concentration in the gas-phase close to the catalytic surface (position 0 mm). The diffusion of oxygen from the bulk flow (coming from the right side in the Figure) through the boundary layer to the catalytic surface is now the rate-limiting process. It should be noted that all these transport effects are included in the physical models used for the numerical simulation of the reactor.25 The consumption of C3H8 is decreased compared to Case 2. However, the product selectivity at these rich conditions does not vary significantly in comparison to the stoichiometric (in respect to partial oxidation) Case 2. Total combustion products of CO2 and H2O are the main reaction products. The methane formation rate is also in the same range as in Case 2. The main influence of decreasing the oxygen ratio is the rate of carbon formation on the surface. The formation of surface carbon and the deactivation of Rh surface were also observed experimentally by Huff et al.26
After a change in the reaction conditions between Case 2 and Case 3, steady-state conditions are achieved after 1 h, which is a considerably long reaction time. After the first 30 min, the mole fractions on the catalyst surface were measured. A sharp decrease in H2 and CO mole fractions and a slight increase in C3H8 mole fraction were noticed. The reactor was held at these conditions for further 30 min. After the boundary-layer was completely resolved, the microprobe was positioned at the catalyst surface again, and the mole composition was measured. By doing so, possible deviations in the boundary-layer mole fractions of the species, which are due to the deactivation during the measurements, were eliminated. The formation of carbon on the surface visually results in a color change on the catalyst surface as black spots appear on the catalyst surface. It is believed that a fast deactivation of the catalyst occurs at the beginning of the reaction within the first 30–40 min; afterwards, the reaction is stable and no further catalyst deactivation takes place. As result of the deactivation of the active metal surface area is decreased, expressed by a lower in the numerical simulation. As discussed below, the catalyst is regenerated before studying the next case.
Further measurements are carried out to examine the effect of the catalyst temperature on the product selectivity (Cases 4–6). As expected, increasing the temperature leads to higher synthesis gas yields. Although no large influence on the consumption rate of C3H8 was observed, the major difference between Case 2 and Case 4 consists in the measured gas-phase CO concentration profile. The CO2 concentration does not change significantly whereas the H2O concentration slightly decreases, 6.4 vol. % H2O and 5.2 vol. % H2O at the catalyst surface in Case 2 and Case 4, respectively. This observation implies a steam reforming reaction of C3H8 at 883 K.
Taking Case 4 as a baseline condition for 933 K, further measurements are carried out at varying fuel/oxygen ratios. The synthesis gas production yield is decreased by increasing the oxygen amount (Case 5, C/O=0.76) because the reaction yields more total oxidation products (CO2, H2O) than synthesis gas. The reaction rate of consumption of C3H8 is increased and the oxygen is completely consumed at the catalyst surface. In fuel-rich conditions (Case 6, C/O=1.23), the synthesis gas production is slightly increased compared to Case 4.
For all reaction conditions examined, good agreement is achieved between the experimental and the numerical data. Small differences between the measured and the predicted oxygen concentrations are visible. The deviations might be due to the sampling technique. At the catalyst surface, the position of the microprobe is visually adjusted in such a way that the relative position of the microprobe is zero and it touches the catalyst surface. However, the microprobe opening has a 15° angle.18 Thus, at the microprobe tip, it has a direct contact with the catalyst but it has an opening to surroundings outside the catalyst surface through the tip angle. Also, because a vacuum is used for sampling, it may cause sampling of small amount of oxygen molecules outside of the catalyst surface as well.
CH4 is measured to be the only a minor by-product. Under the reaction conditions investigated, the optimum operating conditions for partial oxidation of C3H8 are found for Case 4, in which the reaction is carried out with a stoichiometric amount of fuel and oxygen (C/O=1.0) at 933 K. Although, a higher synthesis gas production was observed for fuel-rich conditions (Case 6), the catalyst suffers of rapid deactivation due to the formation of surface carbon.
Steam reforming
As a second set of experiments to establish the kinetic parameters, steam reforming of C3H8 [Eq. 2] is studied under stoichiometric conditions (molar steam-to-carbon ration of S/C=1) at surface temperatures of 883 and 923 K (Table 3).

11.2 μl min−1 water is fed to an evaporator. The gas feeding lines and the evaporator are heated up to 423 K to avoid a possible condensation of the water. The total flow rate is calculated to be 18.9 slpm that corresponds to an axial gas velocity of 77 cm s−1 at the stagnation–flow reactor inlet at 423 K.
Comparisons of the experimental data and the numerical simulations are presented in Figures 7 and Figure 8. The simulation uses the kinetic scheme of Table 1 as in all other cases described in this paper without any modification.

A high synthesis gas production is observed at both reaction temperatures investigated. The main reaction products are CO and H2. CH4 and CO2 species are detected only at minor by-products. As in the partial oxidation measurements, no C2H2, C2H4 and C3H6 are detected. The boundary-layer is 6 mm thick for CO and C3H8, however, up to 8 mm for H2 due to its faster diffusivity.
Increasing the reaction temperature increases the consumption rate of C3H8 and H2O as well as the rate of synthesis gas production. In contrast to partial oxidation, the reaction rate is mainly kinetically limited, even at higher temperatures. Both reactants, C3H8 and H2O are sufficiently available at the catalyst surface.
Although a good agreement between the experimental data and the numerical simulations is achieved, the model slightly overestimates the CO2 concentration for both reaction conditions investigated. However, it is worth mentioning that the maximum CO2 concentration predicted by the numerical simulations was at ppm level (∼1500 at 923 K). Although CO2 was also experimentally detected by the FTIR, no accurate data analysis was possible since the amount was under the detection limit of the analytics.
Annular catalytic reactor
After developing the kinetic model using the experimental data of the profiles in the stagnation–flow reactor, the model is further tested against conventional lab-scale flow reactor experiments. The mechanism was used as is to numerically simulate the C3H8 partial oxidation experiment by Pagani et al.13 at varying C/O ratio and temperature at different C3H8 concentrations in the inlet feed stream.
Pagani et al.13 used an annular reactor containing a 2 wt.% Rh/α-Al2O3 coated inner ceramic tube, coaxially inserted into an outer quartz tube. The length of the catalytic layer is 20 mm. This configuration allowed gas to flow in the laminar regime under atmospheric pressure. The reaction was carried out with 1–4 vol. % C3H8 in the feed. The N2 diluted O2 content in the feed stream varied to adjust the C/O ratios between 0.5 and 0.89. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was varied between 2–6×106 Nl/(kgcath). This corresponds to inlet gas velocity 9.7–29.1 cm s−1 at 298 K and 1 bar. Numerical simulation of the system is performed by using the two-dimensional parabolic flow code DETCHEMCHANNEL.27 Figure 9 shows the comparison of the model-predicted and measured concentrations at the reactor outlet for C/O=0.5. Model predictions well agrees with the experimental data in terms of predicting the conversion as well as the species composition. At low temperatures, i.e., <773 K, the propane follows a total oxidation path. The fast consumption of O2 indicates that the process is O2 transport limited. The propane and oxygen is fully converted at this temperature regime. All products reach their equilibrium concentration at 873 K, thus the process is equilibrium limited under these conditions. By further increase of the temperature, the reverse water gas-shift reaction can be observed. This behavior becomes evident since the CO2 and H2 mole fraction decreases while CO and H2O mole fraction increases simultaneously.

The model is further tested for varying C3H8 concentrations in the inlet gas stream (Figure 10) The model captures the overall conversion and species concentrations; small differences occur for the prediction of H2O concentrations.

Comparison of model-predicted (lines) propane partial oxidation with experimental data (symbols) from Pagani et al.13 Inlet composition contains varying amounts of C3H8: 1 vol. % (orange), 2 vol. % (blue), 4 vol. % (black). The inlet O2 ratio is varied to adjust C/O=0.89. Total inlet feed is 2×106 Nl/(kgcath).
These small deviations can be attributed to the simulations conditions. The model assumes isothermal reactor conditions in a channel geometry. In the reference study of Pagani et al.,13 there is a maximum temperature difference of 15 K along the catalyst bed. However, the model assumes isothermal reactor behavior and does not consider temperature variations along the reactor.
Conclusions
A surface reaction kinetics is presented for simulation of partial oxidation and reforming of C3H8 over rhodium/alumina catalysts. Steady-state experiments are conducted to derive the kinetic parameters for the reactions involving conversion of propane by using a specially designed stagnation–flow reactor with a capillary technique to resolve species profiles on top of the catalyst.
The studied reaction temperature is selected to be below 973 K to avoid ignition of possible gas-phase reactions.11, 12 At temperatures below 873 K, the reaction yields only total oxidation products, i.e., CO2 and H2O. Increasing the temperature also increase the synthesis gas production yield. The results indicate that steam reforming reaction also takes place during partial oxidation of C3H8 at 883 K and C/O=1.0. At fuel-rich conditions, C/O>1.0, carbon formation was observed which causes catalyst deactivation.
The thermodynamic consistent mechanism is also applicable for a large variety of other subsystems of the conversion of H2/CO/H2O/CO2/O2/CH4/C3H8 over rhodium/alumina catalysts as shown in our previous studies.18, 20, 21
Further investigations are necessary at high temperature regimes at which gas-phase reactions can be coupled with the surface reaction mechanism. Additionally, the mechanism can be extended to include oxidation and reforming of further smaller hydrocarbons such as ethane, ethylene, and propylene.
Experimental Section
The experiments for deriving the kinetics parameter for the propane subsystem are carried out in the stagnation–flow reactor with a rhodium coated disk (Figure 11) under varying fuel compositions and catalyst temperatures.

Axisymmetric stagnation–flow field formation and sampling.
Stagnation flow reactor
The premixed inlet mixture, i.e., fuel and oxygen or steam, are fed to the reactor through a porous frit diluted by an Ar gas stream. All gases are dosed via mass flow controllers (MFC, Bronkhorst). For water, a liquid mass flow controller (MFC, Bronkhorst) is used and a microstructure nozzle evaporation technique is applied.28
The catalyst is coated on a flat stagnation disk, which is resistively heated by in-house manufactured heater made out of FeCrAl alloy. The heater is in direct contact with the catalyst surface (Figure 11). The catalyst surface temperature is measured by an R-type (rhodium-platinum) thermocouple. The axisymmetric stagnation flow field creates a boundary layer where the concentration of the species changes due to the diffusional effects in axial direction (distance to the catalytically coated disk) but not in radial direction.22a
The concentration profiles of the species within the boundary-layer are measured by a microprobe (capillary) sampling technique.18 The boundary layer profiles are resolved by moving the probe downward through the boundary-layer in steps of 0.5 mm starting from the position “0” (at the catalyst surface). The position of the microprobe in the boundary-layer is controlled by a step motor controller (Thermionics Northwest, Inc.).
A chemical ionization mass spectrometer (Airsense 500, V&F) with a quadrupole ion trap and an H2 sensor (H-Sense, V&F), which is an electron pulse ionization mass spectrometer, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) are used simultaneously to resolve the concentration profiles within the boundary layer. The operating pressure is selected to be 500 mbar. The boundary-layer profiles of the species are measured under steady-state conditions. For further details on the stagnation flow reactor used, it is referred to our earlier work.18
Catalyst preparation
A 5 wt.% Rh/Al2O3 catalyst is prepared for this study. Aqueous Rh rhodium (III) nitrate (Umicore) (9 wt.% Rh) is used as Rh source and boehmite (AlOOH) (20 % boehmite) is used to make the Al2O3 phase. The solutions are mixed to obtain 5 wt.% Rh/ Al2O3 on the catalytic surface. The solution is diluted with water and applied to the disk by the spin-spray technique to ensure a homogeneously distributed catalytic layer on the surface using a spray gun. The surface is dried at 403 K for 10 min and the procedure is repeated until the desired coating thickness of 100–130 μm is achieved. Figure 12 shows light electron microscopy (LM: Rechert MEF4A) images of the two catalytic disks. Since the Al2O3 substrate has a porous structure, the coating first fills its pores. The second, subsequently formed layer is roughly 30 μm thick and presents a rather flat surface. More details of the technique can be found elsewhere.18, 20

Light electron microscopy images of the catalyst cross sections.
The disk (5.5 cm in diameter) is manufactured using a high-temperature castable ceramic resin and hardener (COT Rescor 780, Cotronics Corporation). Appropriate amounts of resin and hardener are mixed to yield 100 g. The blend is well-mixed and molded in a silicon rubber form and subjected to an ultrasonic bath for 5 min for degassing of the blend. An R-type (rhodium-platinum) thermocouple with 0.2 mm thickness (Omega Newport) is embedded in the center of the stagnation surface during casting. The thermocouple enables direct measurement of the catalyst temperature.
The catalytically coated disk is calcined in air at 973 K for 2 h. Prior to the measurements, the surface is oxidized by 5 vol. % O2 diluted in Ar at 773 K for 2 h. The resulting rhodium oxide phase is reduced by 5 vol. % H2 diluted in Ar at 773 K for 2 h.
Catalyst characterization
The active metal surface area is measured by CO chemisorption to provide the active catalytic surface area needed as parameter in the numerical simulation.29
The used catalyst is characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi S570) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM; Philips CM200 FEG) in combination with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) (Figure 13). The SEM images reveal a porous alumina structure where Rh particles ∼100–150 nm diameter are attached to the surface. EDX mapping also shows that the Rh particles and Alumina are well dispersed on the surface.

Computational Section
Gas-phase reactions can be neglected for the mixtures and temperatures used in this study, hence chemical conversion occurs at the catalytic disk only.
The catalytic reactions are modelled using the mean-field approximation, i.e., the surface is characterized by coverages with adsorbed species. The surface exhibits no local variations in the stagnation flow configuration due to a radially uniform boundary layer, which is a significant advantage of this reactor setup in comparison to kinetic studies in integral reactors such as packed bed or channel flow reactors.
The molar reaction rates s˙k of adsorbed (reactions on the surface) and gas-phase species (adsorption and desorption steps) are then a function of the local coverage and the gas-phase concentrations at the gas-catalyst interface according to Equations 3-4.22a, 24b

Here, Ks is the number of surface reactions, νkj are the stoichiometric coefficients, cn and θn are the species concentrations and coverages, respectively. The surface site density, Γ, is the number of adsorption sites per surface area of the Rh particle, which is estimated to be 2.72×10−9 mol cm−2. The temperature dependent forward rate coefficients of (kfj) are written in the Arrhenius form. The thermodynamic consistency of the mechanism is established using the procedure by Tischer et al.24a. The net production rate of each chemical species in the gas phase is balanced with the diffusive flux of that species in the gas phase at steady-state conditions [Eq. 5] by assuming that no deposition or ablation of chemical species occurs on/from the catalyst surface:
(5)
The term Fcat/geo is used as a scaling factor for the active catalytic surface area Acatalyst and the geometric surface area Ageometric of the catalytic disk or the channel wall; Equation 6.
(6)
This area can be derived by CO chemisorption measurements.18 The internal mass transfer limitation due to finite diffusion in the catalyst coating (washcoat layer) is accounted for by an effectiveness factor, , which is based on the Thiele modulus. Since each chemical species involved in the complex reaction network of a multi-step kinetic scheme leads to a different effectiveness factor, the smallest factor being between zero (i.e., maximum transport limitation) and unity (i.e., no transport limitation) is always used.25
The modeling approach for a stagnation flow reactor with a catalytic surface is well documented by Kee et al.22a and the equations are also summarized in our previous studies.2518 For the numerical simulation of the reactor we applied our recently developed code DETCHEMSTAG,25 alternatively, the well-established computer code SPIN of the CHEMKIN software package30 can be applied. General introductions into coupling of surface chemistry and fluid flow can be found elsewhere.22a, 31
