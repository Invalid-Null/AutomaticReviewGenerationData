Graphical Abstract
Move over steam cracking! The oxidative cracking of n-butane over hexagonal boron nitride under O2-lean conditions gives high selectivity to ethylene and propylene with sparing amounts of CO and CO2. The oxidative cracking of hydrocarbons may provide an efficient route to the production of valuable building-block chemicals.
Abstract
In recent years, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as an unexpected catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. Here, the versatility of hBN was extended to alkane oxidative cracking chemistry by investigating the production of ethylene and propylene from n-butane. Cracking selectivity was primarily controlled by the ratio of n-butane to O2 within the reactant feed. Under O2-lean conditions, increasing temperature led to increased selectivity to ethylene and propylene and decreased selectivity to COx. In addition to surface-mediated chemistry, homogeneous gas-phase reactions likely contributed to the observed product distribution, and a reaction mechanism was proposed based on these observations. The catalyst showed good stability under oxidative cracking conditions for 100 h time-on-stream while maintaining high selectivity to ethylene and propylene.
Introduction
Light olefins such as ethylene and propylene are two of the most vital building blocks in the chemical industry because they are the starting point for many (co-)polymers, oxygenates, and other bulk chemicals. In 2017, the global market for ethylene and propylene stood at 170 and 130 Mt, respectively.1 Historically, the majority of light olefins have been produced through steam cracking of petroleum-derived naphtha.2 Despite the emergence of light olefin production through fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) or direct methods such as propane dehydrogenation (PDH), steam cracking remains the “workhorse” light olefin production technology.2-4 Steam cracker furnaces are typically operated in the temperature range of 850–900 °C to provide the energy for the pyrolysis of naphtha into lighter molecules resulting in process emissions of approximately 1.8–2.0 t CO2 per t ethylene from fuel consumption.5 Moreover, high reaction temperatures lead to coke deposition within the reactors, which must be periodically removed, leading to significant reactor downtimes. Therefore, the development of processes that require less energy and do not produce coke deposits could lead to significant cost-savings in the production of light olefins and is of interest to academic and industrial researchers.
The oxidative cracking of higher hydrocarbons to light olefins has the potential to be economically competitive with steam cracking.6 The exothermic oxidative cracking reaction lends itself to lower reaction temperatures than endothermic nonoxidative steam cracking. The heat generated during oxidative cracking may even enable autothermal reactor operation, reducing heat input during operation and thus decreasing fuel usage.7, 8 The incorporation of O2 within the feed also prevents the fast build-up of coke deposition.
Many catalysts have been studied for the oxidative cracking of hydrocarbons to light olefins, such as Li-doped metal oxides,9-12 metal oxychlorides,13 noble-metal-coated monoliths,7, 8, 14-16 supported Co catalysts,17-19 and supported Au catalysts.20-22 Many of these systems have substantial disadvantages, such as poor catalyst stability or reaction conditions that are not significantly different from those employed in nonoxidative cracking. The most significant drawback shared by all oxidative cracking catalysts explored thus far has been the undesired coproduction of CO2, which has been identified as the main bottleneck in achieving success in oxidative cracking technology.6
Leveles et al. investigated the kinetics and mechanism of the oxidative cracking of propane over a Li/MgO catalyst.10 They reported that the reactive oxygen species on the catalyst surface enable the energetically preferred secondary H-atom abstraction from propane to form isopropyl radicals, which, under nonoxidative conditions, can undergo unimolecular C−C cleavage to form ethylene and CH3.. Acting as a radical chain carrier, CH3. abstracts H. from propane to form either isopropyl or n-propyl radicals. The n-propyl radical can decompose into propylene and H.. Under oxidative conditions, the presence of O2 alters the radical pool in the gas phase. The reaction of O2 with propyl radicals forms propylene and HOO.. H-abstraction by HOO. from propane leads to propyl radicals and H2O2, and the subsequent decomposition of H2O2 to 2 .OH (chain initiation) adds to the pool of gas-phase radical chain carriers. The production of CO and CO2 (COx) mainly occurs through overoxidation pathways on the surface of the catalyst mediated by unselective reactive oxygen species.
In recent years, our group has shown that hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs), and other boron-containing catalysts exhibit high selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane, n-butane, and isobutane.23-25 In these studies, a variety of spectroscopic techniques such as Raman, IR, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that after exposure to reaction conditions, these boron-containing materials become functionalized with oxygen on their surface. We recently employed solid-state NMR spectroscopy to investigate boron nitride materials and demonstrated that the oxidized phase on used boron nitride catalysts can be denoted as B2(OH)2xO3−x (0≤x≤2), which contains the active site for ODH.26 During reaction kinetic studies of hBN-catalyzed ODH, it was revealed that the O2 partial pressure (P ) significantly influenced the observed product distribution.24 Performing the oxidation of n-butane at low P results in a product distribution that consists mainly of cracking products (e.g., methane, ethylene, propylene). Increasing the P resulted in increased selectivity to the primary ODH products 1-butene, cis-2-butene, and trans-2-butene.
Thus far, reports from our group and others have primarily discussed the role of the surface of hBN in the mechanism of alkane ODH.23, 24, 27-29 These contributions have demonstrated the importance of O2 activation on the hBN surface and that the resulting reactive surface oxygen species likely initiate dehydrogenation through H-abstraction from the gas-phase alkane. In a recent report evaluating mass- and heat-transfer phenomena in the hBN-catalyzed ODH of propane,30 we found that increasing catalyst dilution led to a significant increase in the rate of alkane consumption at a constant mass of catalyst, indicating that reactions in the gas phase make a substantial contribution to the reactivity of boron-containing catalysts. Because our findings were not consistent with a reaction in which the surface is mainly responsible for catalytic activity, we put forward the hypothesis that the oxidation of alkanes over hBN proceeds through a surface-initiated radical propagation reaction. This hypothesis is plausible given the evidence for such a mechanism has been put forward for other catalyst systems such as Li/MgO.
In this contribution, we investigate hBN for the oxidation of n-butane to produce ethylene and propylene. We chose n-butane to serve as a model hydrocarbon substrate in these studies so that the experimental results can inform the future investigation of more complex hydrocarbon feeds. The main objective in this study was to probe the role of various reaction parameters such as reactant partial pressures and temperature and their effect on activity and product distribution. By altering P and observing how the rate of formation of each product evolves, we show that the mechanism of oxidative cracking over hBN is likely similar to that of a previously studied cracking catalyst, which can be attributed to homogeneous gas-phase chemistry present in these systems. In comparison, hBN produces less COx, especially CO2. We also demonstrate that hBN does not exhibit any deactivation over the course of 100 h time-on-stream (TOS) despite low O2 availability to oxidize potential coke deposits.
Results and Discussion
Fresh hBN exhibits an induction period attributed to the oxidation of surface boron species.31 Prior to O2-lean oxidative cracking experiments, fresh hBN was activated under an O2-rich feed of 0.20 atm n-C4H10, 0.10 atm O2, and 0.70 atm N2 for 24 h at 550 °C. During activation under these conditions, n-butane conversion (X ) over hBN attained a value of 23.7 % before decreasing mildly and leveled off at a steady-state value of 20.3 % (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).
After catalyst pretreatment, we initially investigated if the selectivity trends observed at low P held at higher X . Our initial oxidative cracking experiments were mostly performed in the differential regime (X <10 %) to obtain valuable kinetic data.24 Because of the apparent O2 adsorption dependence, it is understood that O2-lean feeds lower alkane consumption levels. To overcome this, we employed higher reaction temperatures than those typically employed for hBN-catalyzed n-butane ODH under O2-rich conditions. A range of temperatures were tested at a P /P ratio of 16 and an inverse weight-hourly-space-velocity (WHSV−1) of 27.5 kgcat s mol −1. As the temperature increased from 475 to 575 °C, X linearly increased from 4.3 to 19.8 % whereas X increased from 36.2 to 76.6 %, at which it levelled off (Figure 1 a). The rate of C4 olefin production slightly increased at 500 °C but then decreased with increasing temperature (Figure 1 b). In this temperature range, the rates of methane and propylene production increased and maintained close to a 1:1 ratio, suggesting that they arise from the same C4 intermediate that decomposes into C3 and C1 fragments. The rate of ethylene formation was significantly higher than that of ethane, suggesting that under these conditions, the cracking of n-butane into C2 fragments primarily results in ethylene. Only a slight increase in the production of COx was observed.

Under O2-lean conditions, the substantial difference between the rates of formation of cracking products and C4 olefins with increasing temperature had a significant impact on selectivity. Over the examined temperature range, selectivity to ethylene and propylene increased from 18.5 to 24.5 % and from 25.4 to 45.2 %, respectively (Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). As the rate of production of cracking product outpaced that of C4 olefins, the combined selectivity to C4 olefins (1-butene, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene, isobutene, and 1,3-butadiene) substantially decreased from 45.7 to 7.8 %. The increase in reaction temperature also decreased COx selectivity, which remained under 2 %. This change in selectivity was not solely conversion-dependent because the product distribution at isoconversion was significantly shifted toward cracking products at higher temperature (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). We originally reported that under O2-rich conditions at lower temperatures, the product selectivity in the oxidation of n-butane was independent of temperature in the range of 440–480 °C.24 However, the reaction conditions employed here contribute to temperature-dependent reactivity trends.
Indeed, the results under O2-lean conditions contrast with those obtained under O2-rich conditions. With a P /P of 2:1 and the previously employed WHSV−1 of 27.5 kgcat s mol −1, C4 olefin production linearly increased with temperature from 475 to 575 °C, at which the rate started to decrease (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information). Over this range, the rate of formation of cracking products as well as CO increased. Therefore, enhanced selectivity to cracking products can be obtained at high temperatures under O2-rich conditions but with undesirable COx formation.
The influence of contact time was investigated at a P /P ratio of 16 at 550 °C. Although X increased from 7.8 to 17.2 % as WHSV−1 increased from 15.7 to 55.0 kgcat s mol −1 (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information), the product selectivities were not significantly altered. Therefore, both temperature and contact time can be increased to overcome lower alkane conversions under O2-lean conditions.
We then examined the influence of P /P on the product distribution to see if the trends observed at low alkane conversion were consistent with those at elevated conversion (Figure 2). For a valuable comparison, selectivity data were obtained at isoconversion by altering the feed conditions to the desired partial pressures and adjusting the contact time. As P /P increased, the selectivity to propylene and methane increased whereas that of ethylene remained relatively constant. Additionally, the selectivity to ethane became significant, suggesting that the production of ethane was directly related to P , as P was held constant. Most importantly, the selectivity to COx decreased with increasing P /P . Because the product distribution of the oxidation of alkanes over hBN is significantly affected by P , we hypothesized that the undesirable selectivity to COx from previously studied catalysts may have stemmed from nonoptimal reaction conditions. Because many of the catalysts in the literature are tested under an O2-rich feed (P /P <1), it was unclear how these catalysts would perform under a more optimized set of reaction conditions. Therefore, we synthesized a Li2O/Dy2O3/MgO catalyst based on a literature procedure9 with a nominal loading of 7.7 % Li2O and 7.3 % Dy2O3 and evaluated it in the oxidation of n-butane under O2-lean conditions. Investigating this catalyst at P /P of 16, we observed over a 30-fold increase in the CO2 selectivity at comparable X relative to hBN. This difference suggests that low COx selectivity is inherent to hBN and not only a consequence of decreased O2 availability in the feed. Apart from COx selectivity, the pattern in selectivity between hBN and Li2O/Dy2O3/MgO under O2-lean conditions is nearly identical. This similarity suggests that there exist commonalities in the mechanism of oxidative cracking between these materials, which we hypothesize to be the result of similar gas-phase contributions.

To gain further insight into the reaction mechanism in hBN-catalyzed oxidative cracking, we investigated the rate of formation of each product at varying P while maintaining constant n-butane contact time and ensuring that the reaction was under differential conditions (X <10 %). Under nonoxidative conditions (P =0), mostly cracking products were observed (Figure 3), consistent with unimolecular decomposition of butyl radicals in the gas phase. Only trace amounts of C4 olefins were detected, suggesting that O2 is essential for the production of ODH products under these reaction conditions. The rate of formation of C4 olefins sharply increased with increasing P over the entire range investigated. The rate of formation of methane decreased with a concurrent increase in the rate of formation of CO. This relationship suggested that CH3. species that formed during cracking can abstract H. from another gas-phase species to form methane or can be oxidized to CO in the presence of O2. The rate of formation of ethylene and propylene reached their maximum at approximately P =0.02 atm. Any increase in P beyond this value only increased the production of ODH and COx products at the expense of the formation of cracking products.

To provide more insight into the formation of butenes in the oxidative cracking of n-butane, the rate of formation of each C4 olefin in addition to the ratio of 1-butene/2-butenes was investigated as a function of P (Figure S6 in the Supporting Information). The ratio of butene isomers (1-butene/trans-2-butene/cis-2-butene) gives information on the nature of the second H-abstraction. A statistical distribution, 3:1:1, implies that the second H-abstraction to form the olefin is entropically controlled, whereas a thermodynamic distribution, 1:1:1, implies that it is energetically controlled.32, 33 In our experiment, the 1-butene/2-butenes ratio was between 1.14–1.23, close to our previously reported value of approximately 1.3–1.4 under slightly different reaction conditions.24 These values are closer to a statistical distribution, signifying that the second H-abstraction is most likely entropically controlled. Because the formation of C4 olefins substantially increases with P , we believe that the second H-abstraction is performed in the gas phase with very reactive abstracting agents with no energetic preference for primary or secondary H atoms, which is why we observed a statistical distribution.
Similarities in the product distribution between hBN and Li2O/Dy2O3/MgO (see above) led us to investigate the influence of P on the rate of formation of products in the latter system. This study revealed very similar trends in the rate of product formation under differential conditions between these catalysts (Figure S7 in the Supporting Information). The most significant difference was that the production of CO2 was more substantial over Li2O/Dy2O3/MgO than with hBN. These similar trends in product formation rates allowed us to surmise that the cracking reactions of alkanes over these materials have closely related mechanisms. Because the surfaces of these materials are presumably quite different in nature, identical gas-phase reactions occurring in both systems could explain the analogies in product distributions.
A gas-phase reaction network that accounts for our experimental observations is presented in Scheme 1. The fate of the radical species formed during the reaction depends on the presence of O2. The pathways independent of O2 (numbered in black in Scheme 1) predominate under O2-lean conditions. Regardless of P , we propose that the reactive B−O moieties on the surface abstract the energetically preferred secondary H-atom to form secondary n-butyl radicals (1). Under O2-lean conditions, the majority of these radicals decompose to form propylene and CH3. (2), according to the β-scission rule.34 CH3. acts as a chain carrier, which forms CH4 upon abstraction of H. from n-butane to form primary or secondary n-butyl radicals (3).35 Primary radicals undergo β-scission to form an ethyl radical and ethylene (4). The ethyl radical forms ethane upon H-abstraction of n-butane (5) or can eject H. to form ethylene (6), the latter reaction providing the reasoning for ethylene comprising the large majority of the C2 selectivity under all tested conditions.36

Proposed gas-phase mechanism in the oxidation of n-butane over hBN. The reactions are numbered in black or red for pathways not dependent or dependent on gas-phase O2, respectively (see text).
With addition of O2, new reaction pathways are accessible (numbered in red in Scheme 1). The reaction of alkyl radicals with O2 to form alkylperoxy adducts is well established in the literature.37-39 The decomposition of these adducts results in the formation of an olefin and HOO.. Thus, the reaction of secondary n-butyl radicals formed at the catalyst surface with O2 forms 1-butene, trans-2-butene, and cis-2-butene (7). HOO., like CH3., further reacts with n-butane molecules to form additional alkyl radicals (4). The H2O2 formed in this step generates 2 .OH upon decomposition (8); .OH becomes the main chain carrier under oxidative conditions.10 In addition to the nonoxidative processes described above, the primary butyl radical can react with O2 to form 1-butene (9). The presence of O2 also affects the fate of the alkyl radicals formed from C−C cleavage. CH3. can oxidize to COx (10), and the ethyl radical forms ethylene upon H-abstraction (11), explaining the loss of ethane production with increasing P . Further studies are required to provide insight into the radical species present in the oxidation of hydrocarbons over hBN. Recently, Luo et al. employed synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry (SVUV-PIMS) to characterize the radical species present in the oxidation of methane and ethane over Li/MgO.40 Species analogous to those suggested here, such as alkylperoxy radicals, were detected. This technique may prove to be valuable for the study of the oxidation of alkanes over boron-containing catalysts as well.
Catalyst stability is an important concern when establishing novel oxidative cracking catalysts. Nonoxidative cracking catalysts suffer from deactivation owing to coke deposition and oxidative cracking catalysts deactivate from degradation of the active phase through evaporation or phase change. hBN has been shown to be highly stable for up to 300 h in the ODH of ethane at 530 °C.28 Because O2-lean feeds were used to favor selectivity to light olefins, coke deposition may play a more significant role as O2 availability to oxidize carbon species is decreased. After the initial O2-rich treatment of hBN described above, the stability of hBN was investigated for an extended TOS under O2-lean conditions. The X and product selectivity of hBN for 100 h TOS at 550 °C with a P /P of 16:1 and WHSV−1 of 55.0 kgcat s mol −1 is shown in Figure 4. No loss of activity was observed in this period; moreover, a slight increase in X from 11.5 to 13.7 % with TOS was observed. High selectivity to ethylene (24.2 %) and propylene (43.9 %) was maintained over the course of the experiment, and total COx selectivity remained at 1.2 %.

Despite the lack of deactivation in the TOS experiment, coke deposition was still assessed through Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Fresh hBN catalysts were treated for 48 h at 550 °C with a feed of 0.20 atm n-butane with P of 0.0125 or 0.10 atm. Additionally, contact time was altered to achieve different levels of X . Raman spectroscopy revealed that catalysts treated under conditions of limited O2 availability (i.e. low P and/or high X ) exhibited two D bands (disordered carbon) at 1180 and 1280 cm−1 in addition to a G band (graphitic carbon) at 1600 cm−1 (Figure S8 in the Supporting Information).41 These bands were less pronounced under O2-richer conditions, suggesting that coke deposition was hindered by high O2 availability. TGA of the catalysts under flowing air was then used to quantitatively determine the amount of coke present after each treatment (Figure S9 in the Supporting Information). After the initial loss in mass on spent catalysts owing to dehydration from 100 to 300 °C, the loss of mass owing to the oxidation of coke deposits at 500 to 700 °C showed that no more than 0.25 wt % of the catalysts was comprised of coke deposits. Raman spectroscopy was used to evaluate the catalyst that underwent the largest mass decrease in the oxidative TGA analysis and previously exhibited the largest evidence for coke deposition in the Raman experiment (P =0.0125 atm, X =82 %). The post-TGA spectrum indicated that these bands significantly decreased in intensity after treatment of the material in flowing air, confirming that these bands can be correctly assigned to coke deposition and that the coke can be oxidatively removed. Although we have no indication that these minor coke deposits affect the catalyst performance at lab scale, they may become an issue with longer TOS at pilot scale.
Conclusions
Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has been established as a selective catalyst for the oxidative cracking of n-butane to lighter olefins. The adjustment of the reactant feed from O2-rich to O2-lean alters the product distribution in the oxidation of alkanes over hBN from primarily butenes [oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) products] to ethylene and propylene (cracking products). Lowering the O2 concentration in the feed also reduces the selectivity to COx to less than 2 % in most cases. Increasing the reaction temperature allows for enhanced rates of production of cracking products. The rate of product formation as a function of P provides evidence for what we hypothesize to be a surface-initiated gas-phase radical mechanism, further supported by observations that the previously studied Li2O/Dy2O3/MgO catalyst shares very similar trends in product formation rates. We propose a reaction mechanism for oxidative cracking over hBN that accounts for our observations in selectivity and rates of formation. There is evidence of slight coke deposition in used samples, but there is no observed catalyst deactivation.
Because other boron-containing catalysts (B4C, WB, NiB) with oxidized surface boron species catalyze the ODH of alkanes with the same selectivity as hBN,25 we envision that these materials will follow the same trends in reactivity observed for hBN when evaluated for their performance in oxidative cracking. Therefore, boron-containing materials are a highly versatile platform for selective hydrocarbon oxidations, and new materials can be engineered to meet the needs of new oxidative technology.
Although current hydrocarbon cracking processes are well established, their high emission of CO2 necessitates the development of environmentally benign technology. Here, we demonstrate that hBN is able to produce light olefins selectively at milder temperatures than steam cracking with an order of magnitude less CO2 selectivity than previously studied oxidative cracking catalysts. Moreover, the tunability in product distribution with simple adjustment of process parameters enables the flexible production of olefins in a given market. The understanding of the parameters involved in the production of ethylene and propylene from n-butane over hBN can inform future studies investigating the oxidation of more complex hydrocarbon feeds as we investigate more efficient routes to valuable chemicals.
Experimental Section
Catalytic testing
Fresh hBN was obtained from Sigma–Aldrich and not further chemically treated prior to catalytic testing. The powder was pelletized, crushed, and sieved to collect particles of 425–600 μm in diameter to limit any potential mass-transfer effects. The collected hBN (≈300 mg) was loaded into a quartz tube reactor (9 mm inner diameter) undiluted and supported on a bed of quartz wool approximately 1 inch in length in the middle of the tube. A quartz rod was placed beneath the catalyst bed to reduce dead volume and minimize the potential for homogeneous gas-phase reactions past the catalyst bed. Flowrates of n-C4H10 (instrument-grade, Matheson), O2 (UHP, Airgas), and N2 (UHP, Airgas) were controlled by using three mass-flow controllers (Bronkhorst) calibrated to each individual gas to allow total flow rates of 40–140 mL min−1 and WHSV−1 values ranging from 15.7–55.0 kgcat s mol −1. All reactions were performed at a Ptot of 1 atm. The temperature was controlled by using a thermocouple inserted into the middle of the catalyst bed.
Exposure of fresh hBN to the reaction conditions results in an induction period of approximately 18 h before steady-state activity is achieved; therefore, each catalyst was pretreated under identical conditions prior to the collection of reported data. Fresh hBN was heated to 550 °C under a flow of 20 mL min−1 O2 and 20 mL min−1 N2. After the temperature stabilized, the gas flow was changed to a mixture of 2:1:7 n-C4H10/O2/N2 at a flow rate of 80 mL min−1, and the catalyst was treated under these conditions for 24 h. The temperature and gas flow rates were then adjusted to give the desired reaction conditions.
The H2O produced from the reaction was condensed by using a thermoelectrically cooled condenser held at −5 °C. The dried reactor effluent was monitored by using an on-line μGC (Inficon Micro GC Fusion Gas Analyzer) equipped with three GC modules and three micro thermal conductivity detectors. O2, N2, CH4, and CO were analyzed by using a Rt-Molsieve 5A column, CO2 was analyzed by using an Rt-U-Bond column, and all hydrocarbons with the exception of CH4 were analyzed by using an Rt-Alumina Bond/Na2SO4 column. Reported experiments showed the carbon balance closed within ±5 %.
Material synthesis
The Li2O/Dy2O3/MgO catalyst was synthesized based on a literature procedure.9 To achieve a nominal loading of 7.7 wt % Li2O and 7.3 wt % Dy2O3 on MgO, LiNO3 (1.8 g, Sigma–Aldrich), Dy2O3 (0.37 g, Strem Chemicals), and MgO (4.2 g, Aldrich) were added to 18 MΩ H2O (250 mL), and the resultant slurry was stirred for 2 h. The mixture was then evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, dried at 100 °C overnight, and then ground and treated under flow of air for 2 h at 200 °C. The material was ground again and then heated under a flow of air to 750 °C at a rate of 4 °C min−1 and held at 750 °C for 3 h. The powder was then prepared and tested as described for hBN, with the pretreatment performed at 575 °C.
Thermogravimetric analysis
TGA was performed by using a Mettler Toledo DSC/TGA 1 Thermogravimetric Analyzer. Used catalyst (≈70–100 mg) was deposited into a ceramic 150 μL crucible. The change in mass was monitored over time as the sample was heated at 10 °C min−1 from ambient temperature to 900 °C under an air flow of 40 mL min−1.
Raman spectroscopy
Raman spectra were recorded by using an Invia Reflex Raman Microscope (Renishaw) equipped with a λ=785 nm laser. All measurements were performed under ambient conditions by using pelletized samples without dilution. Typically, 60 scans of 1 s in duration were averaged. The spectra were recorded between 600–1700 cm−1 by using the WiRE software package (Renishaw).
