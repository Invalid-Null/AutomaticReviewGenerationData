Designing single-site alloy catalysts using a degree-of-isolation descriptor

Abstract
Geometrically isolated metal atoms in alloy catalysts can target efficient and selective catalysis. However, the geometric and electronic disturbance between the active atom and its neighbouring atoms, that is, diverse microenvironments, makes the active site ambiguous. Herein, we demonstrate a methodology to describe the microenvironment and determine the effectiveness of active sites in single-site alloys. A simple descriptor, degree-of-isolation, is proposed, considering both electronic regulation and geometric modulation within a PtM ensemble (M = transition metal). The catalytic performance of PtM single-site alloy is examined thoroughly using this descriptor for an industrially important reaction, propane dehydrogenation. The volcano-shaped isolation–selectivity plot reveals a Sabatier-type principle for designing selective single-site alloys. Specifically, for a single-site alloy with a high degree-of-isolation, alternation of the active centre has a great impact on tuning selectivity, validated by the outstanding consistency between experimental propylene selectivity and the computational descriptor.

Main
The regulation of electronic properties and geometric features on extended solid surfaces is indispensable in the pursuit of advanced catalysts. A landmark example is isolated metal atom geometries as a strategy1, which typically plays its role via suppressing undesired structure-sensitive reactions or promoting the desorption of target products2,3,4,5,6,7. Using this strategy, single-atom alloys (SAAs) and intermetallic alloys (IMAs), both classes of single-site catalysts, are becoming a thriving research field because they access unprecedented catalytic behaviour in a variety of chemical reactions6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Specifically, for the highly active Pt-based catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), breaking large Pt ensembles into isolated Pt sites to regulate the adsorption configuration and the subsequent reaction is critical to enhance the selectivity of the target product propylene3,5,13. However, different interactions between the active atom and its neighbouring atoms result in diverse microenvironments of active sites, which makes the geometrically isolated site not necessarily effective or efficient14,15. The importance of rationally adjusting microenvironments of active sites can be clearly seen in previous works that report Au-, Ag- and Cu-alloyed Pd single-atom catalysts for semi-hydrogenation of acetylene, showing great distinction in the selectivity of ethylene (25%, 80% and 85%, respectively)16,17,18. Therefore, to legibly describe and manipulate the microenvironment of active sites, rather than merely focusing on the isolated atom geometries, is of vital importance, especially for stepping across trial-and-error approaches to rational catalyst design.
Herein, we introduce a methodology to describe the microenvironment and determine the effectiveness of active sites in a Pt-based alloy catalyst for the industrially important PDH reaction, whose target product propylene has been experiencing steady demand growth over recent decades19,20,21. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we construct specific models to separately identify the electronic regulation and geometric modulation of the Pt site within the PtM ensemble, and thereby define a simple descriptor, ϕ. It depicts the degree of Pt–C repulsion, corresponding to a kind of isolation effect, and is thus called degree-of-isolation. Manifesting a moderate degree-of-isolation, PtZn IMA is the optimal catalyst, which reveals a Sabatier-type principle for designing selective single-site alloys, and the superior experimental performance of PtZn IMA has been reported recently13,22,23,24. Typically, for IMAs with a high degree-of-isolation, alternation of the active centre has a great impact on tuning selectivity, validated by the synthesized PtMn IMA catalyst that exhibits more than 93% selectivity of propylene at the propane conversion of ~49% at 600 °C.
Electronic regulation of Pt site
The mutual influence between electronic and geometric structures restricts the comprehension of electronic regulation and geometric modulation for the active site in PDH. To investigate the electronic regulation of the Pt site, the geometric effect is minimized. Here, three group VIII metals (Fe, Co and Ni), which have similar atomic radii, were selected as alloying elements. The close-packed surfaces (110) of PtFe, PtCo and PtNi with body-centred tetragonal phase (P4/mmm), and (111) of Pt3Fe, Pt3Co and Pt3Ni with face-centred cubic phase (Fm\({\bar{3}}\)m), were chosen, for which the difference in Pt–Pt interatomic distance is within 0.15 Å (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a). Our calculations show that the d-band centre25,26 of Pt becomes more negative when more electrons transfer from M to Pt (Fig. 1b,c). Moreover, both properties can present a linear correlation with the electronegativity difference (Δχ) between Pt and M (Fig. 1c). Consistently, Miedema27 has proposed a similar correlation between the electron transfer and Δχ.

In the PDH reaction, the difference between propylene desorption energy and its further dehydrogenation energy barrier can be used to estimate the selectivity28,29,30. As Δχ increases, the additional electrons on Pt populate the antibonding orbital of the Pt–C bond, leading to a gradual weakening of the bond and more unstable adsorption for both di-σ and π adsorbed propylene (C3H6) (Fig. 1b,d and Extended Data Fig. 1b). Likewise, previous studies29,30,31,32 show that enriching the electron density or downshifting the d-band centre of the active site can weaken the adsorption of adsorbates and benefit selectivity. This circumstance could be easily understood because C3H6 is an electron-donating group: nucleophilic sites on the catalyst will repel its adsorption and vice versa. When taking an electron-donating group, methyl (CH3), as a detector33, we find that a larger Δχ leads to more antibonding states of the Pt–C bond, demonstrating Δχ to be a useful tool to quantify Pt–C repulsion (Fig. 1e). However, the atomic radius of M can differ greatly among a series of alloys with diverse microenvironments, and this possibly causes a tensile or compressive strain, which can fine-tune the electronic properties of alloys34. To gain further evidence, we then elucidate the impact of radii among 3d transition metals. The mole ratio (k = cM/cPt) is introduced as a constant term to differentiate alloy composition. Unsurprisingly, Δχ shows a linear relationship with the electron transfer from M to Pt, and relates to the antibonding occupancy of the Pt–C bond (Extended Data Fig. 1c). After multiplying Δχ by the normalized radius (rM/rPt) the electronic regulation of the Pt site is described more accurately, and a larger value of (rM/rPt)Δχ corresponds to stronger Pt–C repulsion (Fig. 1f,g). Therefore, we could use the (rM/rPt)Δχ directly obtained from physical chemistry handbooks to describe the electronic interaction between Pt and M in an alloy and predict how the Pt site is regulated.
Geometric modulation of Pt site
To investigate geometric modulation of the Pt site quantitatively, the disturbance of electronic structure is preferably eliminated. Thus, two slab models, PtZn(110) and PtZn(101) with various geometric structures but a similar electronic environment, were established (Extended Data Fig. 2). Figure 2a shows that the activation energy of the undesired side reaction, C3H6 dehydrogenation, increases linearly with elongating interatomic distance of the nearest neighbour of Pt (Δd). By contrast, the distance cannot strongly affect the activation energy of propane (C3H8) or propyl (C3H7). Namely, the first (8–7) or the second (7–6) C–H bond cleavage of propane as the rate-determining step29 is insensitive to the geometric structure, while the C3H6 dehydrogenation step (6–5) is structure-sensitive. Accordingly, the transition state (H–C3H5) of the C3H6 dehydrogenation step maintains a distance of ~1.66 Å between the detached H atom and the C atom (Fig. 2b). For this elementary step, we further study how Δd influences the activation energy from the viewpoint of bonding. This shows that the elongation of Δd is the key to weakening the Pt–C bond in the transition state, which signifies that Δd, a geometric feature, can be utilized to measure Pt–C repulsion, and thereby evaluate the ability to suppress the undesired dehydrogenation of C3H6 (Fig. 2b).

Volcano-shaped isolation–selectivity plot
Investigation of the electronic regulation and geometric modulation of the Pt site illustrates that (rM/rPt)Δχ and Δd can quantify Pt–C repulsion from the electronic and geometric viewpoints, respectively. By altering the degree of Pt–C repulsion, the interaction between adsorbates and surfaces will be varied. Considering that the repulsion is a kind of isolation effect, a descriptor, called degree-of-isolation, is proposed. Given that the alloying elements involve M from 3d to 5d, the number of electron shells of M is also included in this descriptor. Therefore, degree-of-isolation for the single-site alloy is defined as follows:
$$\phi = (r_{\mathrm{M}}/r_{\mathrm{Pt}})\Delta \chi \, \Delta d/n$$ (1)
where n is the number of electron shells of M.
On the basis of the definition, the larger ϕ is, the more strongly the Pt site repulses adsorbates. The volcano-shaped isolation–selectivity plot reveals a Sabatier-type principle for designing selective single-site alloys, underscoring that moderate Pt–C interaction contributes to the optimal performance (Fig. 3a). It provides a direct approach and more intrinsic insight to evaluate selectivity, which is complex to determine using two variables in competition, regarding the desorption and the further dehydrogenation of propylene. Here, these two variables are replaced by a single variable, degree-of-isolation. Representatively, PtZn IMA, manifesting a moderate ϕ (~0.5), is predicted to possess superior performance in PDH, which has been reported experimentally13,22,23,24. It is also in line with common sense that elements in group IB/IIB boost selective catalysis. Moreover, Fig. 3a clearly indicates that geometrically isolated sites may not be catalytically effective, as single-site alloys with diverse microenvironments possibly lead to Pt–C repulsion that is either too strong or too weak.

A fundamental understanding of why the volcano-shaped curve appears is also established. For simplification, we classify these single-site alloys according to the adsorption geometry of propenyl (C3H5), which is a model precursor of coke formation in the PDH reaction and sensitive to the microenvironment of active sites3,29. The influence of ϕ is found to be clearly embodied in the transformation of the most stable adsorption configurations of C3H5 on PtM (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 3). Note that the M on the right of the periodic table (for example, group IB elements) are more inert than those in groups IIIB to VIII, giving rise to fairly strong M–C repulsion (Fig. 3b). Meanwhile, these elements form PtM alloys on the left slope of the volcano, with a relatively moderate Pt–C interaction, making C3H5 interact with the surface via a single Pt–C bond. By contrast, rather weak Pt–C and M–C repulsion coexist in other alloys on the left slope of the volcano, permitting C3H5 to be stabilized at a bridge site consisting of Pt and M atoms. At this stage, the selectivity gradually increases as ϕ becomes larger.
When further looking at PtM alloys on the right slope of the volcano, it is found that they exactly contain those M on the left and middle of the periodic table (group IIIB to VIIB). For M belonging to groups IIIB–VIB, C3H5 is prone to contacts with M atoms because of both strong Pt–C repulsion and weak M–C repulsion. As a result, C3H5 is stabilized at a more stable hollow site (two M atoms and one Pt atom) and generates a downshift of selectivity with increasing ϕ, except for M in group IIIB bringing about a total transformation of the active centre from Pt to M (Extended Data Fig. 3). Here, we only focus on alloys comprising Pt as the active centre, so M in group IIIB is not discussed thoroughly. Group VIIB metal, in the middle of the periodic table, which refers only to Mn, is not particularly inclined to act as an adsorption site, and consequently C3H5 contacts with a single Pt atom. Such alternation of the active centre has a strong impact on tuning selectivity, indicating PtMn as a selective catalyst.
Experimental synthesis, characterization and PDH performance
To validate the screening result, SiO2-supported Pt and PtMn IMAs are synthesized. The formation energy of PtMn IMA is calculated to be −0.91 eV, implying its favourable synthesis. A set of diffraction peaks (40.5° and 45.5°) correspond well to the standard powder X-ray diffraction patterns of intermetallic PtMn (P4/mmm, body-centred tetragonal) (PDF 04-001-2842)35 after 600 °C reduction (Fig. 4a,c). Aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (AC-HAADF-STEM) imaging further reveals the presence of geometry-isolated Pt atoms in the structurally ordered [PtMn4] motifs (rectangle-framed motifs), featuring the alternating bright Pt column and darker Mn column contrast on [110] planes (Fig. 4f,g). The fast Fourier transform shows superlattice diffraction patterns, which implies the formation of ordered PtMn IMA (Supplementary Fig. 1m). The two atomic plane distances are measured as 0.208 and 0.227 nm, in agreement with the lattice spacing of intermetallic PtMn along the [110] and [101] directions. The comparison of surface energies for low-index surfaces, which includes (100), (110) and (111), also shows that the (110) surface is the most stable with the lowest surface energy (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2). Energy dispersive spectrometry elemental mappings of PtMn nanoparticles are also obtained (Supplementary Fig. 1g–k), showing a homogeneous distribution of Pt and Mn. These results clearly demonstrate the formation of structure-ordered PtMn IMA after H2 reduction. After its synthesis, the structure of PtMn also tends to be maintained owing to the high segregation energy of either Pt or Mn to the surface (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 4). We also conduct ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations at 873 K within the NVT ensemble using both slab and particle models, further validating the stability of PtMn (Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6). Comparatively, without Mn addition, Pt (Fm\(\bar 3\)m, face-centred cubic) (PDF 04-0802)36 is formed, as shown in the X-ray diffraction patterns (Fig. 4a,c) and the AC-HAADF-STEM imaging (Fig. 4d,e). The two atomic plane distances are measured as 0.229 and 0.199 nm, consistent with the lattice spacing along the [111] and [200] directions.

The electronic states of this PtMn ensemble are further monitored using in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. After H2 reduction, Pt is reduced to metallic Pt0 for PtMn/SiO2 and Pt/SiO2. In comparison, for PtMn/SiO2, the binding energy of Pt0 in the Pt 4f7/2 peak is 70.4 eV, lower than that over Pt/SiO2 (70.7 eV). This indicates the electron transfers from Mn to the 5d band of Pt and the formation of electron-rich Pt in the PtMn ensemble37, which is consistent with the theoretical prediction (Figs. 1f and 4h and Supplementary Fig. 3).
During reaction, the propylene selectivity of PtMn IMA (93%) for PDH is markedly improved when compared with pure Pt (73%) (Fig. 4i). The distribution of side product is also thoroughly investigated, which shows that the C3-to-C2 path way surpasses the C3-to-C2-and-C1 pathway over PtMn, leading to a higher ethane selectivity when compared with methane (Supplementary Figs. 4–9). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and AC-HAADF-STEM images show that the structure of PtMn IMA is maintained after reaction, which is consistent with the result of AIMD simulations (Supplementary Fig. 10 and Extended Data Figs. 5 and 6). Raman spectra of the spent catalysts further indicate that the coke amount and graphitization degree (the calculated ratio of the intensity of the D peak and G peak (ID/IG) that ascribed to coke D (disorder) and G (graphite) modes, respectively) of PtMn/SiO2 is substantially lower than that over Pt/SiO2 (Supplementary Fig. 11). Note that PtMn IMA, displaying remarkable initial performance, deactivates gradually in the long-term test, while PtZn IMA13 has the lowest deactivation rate in a list of representative Pt-based catalysts (Supplementary Fig. 12 and Supplementary Table 3). As they show similar structural stabilities (Extended Data Figs. 4–6 and Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14), this can be attributed to the superior selectivity of PtZn, which has a moderate ϕ, demonstrated by the volcano-shaped relationship between ϕ and propylene selectivity, both theoretical and experimental, among a series of PtM single-site alloys (Figs. 3a and 4j, Extended Data Fig. 7 and Supplementary Fig. 15). Consequently, PtZn preferentially avoids side reactions such as coking, and contributes to a stable performance during reaction when compared with PtMn, which emphasizes the Sabatier-type principle for designing selective single-site alloys. The reason for the deactivation of PtMn is also investigated. It is found that low-coordination sites (for example edge and corner sites) facilitate coke formation and contribute to the deactivation at the initial stage of catalysis (Extended Data Fig. 8). Moreover, HAADF-STEM images of the catalysts before and after 50 h reaction indicate that the particle size of PtMn grows from 1.1 ± 0.3 nm to 1.8 ± 0.5 nm, which may be the main reason for catalyst deactivation at the later stage (Supplementary Fig. 16).
Extension and applicability of degree-of-isolation
The degree-of-isolation, defined as (rM/rPt)Δχ Δd/n, can be divided into two terms. One is electron dependent, named ϕe, and is the product of rM/rPt, Δχ and 1/n. Another is a geometric feature, Δd. We can easily envision that the selectivity of alloys with similar geometric features will depend on ϕe itself. A remarkable example is SAA catalyst, with active metals highly dispersed in more inert host metals, whose geometric feature can be identified as a constant. Moreover, adsorbates are not inclined to contact with the inert host metal, which manifests strong M–C repulsion, corresponding to the left-hand side of the volcano-shaped curve. As ϕe increases, the selectivity should improve. A good linear relationship between ϕe and experimental ethylene selectivity does exist for Au-, Ag- and Cu-alloyed Pd SAA catalyst in the semi-hydrogenation of acetylene16,17,18, indicating that the concept of degree-of-isolation has the potential to be applied in other catalytic systems (Extended Data Fig. 9a). The experimental selectivity of propylene in PDH presents a similar relationship with ϕe for subsurface alloys, which have the same Pt-skin structure, and Fe, Co or Ni as alloying elements in subsurface regions38 (Extended Data Fig. 9b).
Conclusions
Designing efficient catalysts is paramount to the development of selective catalytic processes. Here, taking PDH as a model reaction, the electronic regulation and geometric modulation of the Pt site are separately investigated to extract fundamental principles for catalyst design. By defining a simple descriptor called degree-of-isolation, the microenvironments of the geometrically isolated sites are clearly described, indicating whether the active site in single-site alloys is catalytically effective. The established volcano-shaped isolation–selectivity plot highlights the Sabatier-type principle for designing selective single-site alloys, predicting PtZn, with moderate Pt–C repulsion, as the most promising catalyst, whose superior experimental performance is validated by previous research. Moreover, the active centre obviously changes from the left side to the right side of the volcano-shaped curve, stressing the great impact on selectivity via alternation of the adsorption configuration, which is confirmed by the successful construction of a selective Pt site in PtMn IMA. The concept of degree-of-isolation also has potential to be used in other catalytic systems and alloys. This work sheds light on advancing the field of catalyst engineering from trial and error to rational design and specifically calls for more emphasis on the description and manipulation of the catalytic microenvironment.
Methods
Computational methods and models
The calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package39 using the projector augmented wave method40 and the generalized gradient approximation41 in the form of the Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals corrections42. The planewave basis sets were converged at a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV for each slab model, of which the bottom two layers were fixed. The close-packed surfaces are chosen for calculation. For magnetic elements or alloys, spin-polarized DFT calculations were specially employed. An atomic force convergence criterion of 0.02 eV Å−1 was used to identify optimized geometries. For PtM(110), a (2 × 2) supercell with five layers was used. A (5 × 3 × 1) k-point grid was applied to PtSc(110) and PtZr(110). A (4 × 3 × 1) k-point grid was applied to PtY(110) and PtHf(110). A (3 × 3 × 1) k-point grid was used for other IMAs. For PtMn(101), PtFe(101), PtCo(101), PtNi(101), PtAg(101) and PtPd(101), a (2 × 3) supercell with five layers was used, along with a (3 × 3 × 1) k-point grid. For PtZn(101), a (2 × 3) supercell with five layers was used, along with a (4 × 4 × 1) k-point grid. For Pt3M(111), a (4 × 4) supercell with four layers was used, along with a (3 × 3 × 1) k-point grid. For 5d metals, a (3 × 3 × 1) k-point grid was used. A (4 × 4) supercell with four layers was used for Hf(001), Re(001), Os(111), Ir(111), Pt(111) and Au(111). A (3 × 2) supercell with five layers was used for Ta(110) and W(110). For 4d metals, a (4 × 4) supercell with four layers, corresponding to a (3 × 3 × 1) k-point grid, was used, except for Nb(110), which used a (2 × 2) supercell with five layers and a (5 × 3 × 1) k-point grid. For 3d metals, Sc(001) and Ti(001) were modelled by a (3 × 3) supercell with six layers, corresponding to a (5 × 5 × 1) k-point grid. For V(110) and Cr(110) a (2 × 2) supercell was used, while a (2 × 3) supercell was used to model Fe(110). The thickness for these was five layers, and a (5 × 5 × 1) k-point grid was applied. A (4 × 4) supercell with four layers was used to model Mn(111), Co(111), Ni(111) and Cu(111), corresponding to a (3 × 3 × 1) k-point grid. Transition states were determined with the climbing-image nudged elastic band method and the dimer method43,44. For all energy diagrams, the energy of C3H8 in the gas phase is taken as reference and the energies of intermediates are corrected with H2 in the gas phase. The adsorption energy of C3H6 is defined as (Etotal − Eslab − EC3H6), where Etotal is the total energy of the slab with C3H6 adsorbed and Eslab is the energy of the clean slab, while EC3H6 refers to the energy of C3H6 in the gas phase. The alloy formation energy is evaluated using the bulk energy of the alloy and pure metal. Entropic contributions were calculated according to Campbell’s method45, accompanied by the calculation of zero-point energy, to convert potential energy into Gibbs free energy. All the kinetic and thermodynamic analyses were carried out at 873 K with 0.28, 0.15 and 0.04 atm partial pressures for H2, C3H8 and C3H6, respectively. Atomic charges were computed using Bader charge analysis46. COHP analysis was performed with the LOBSTER 3.2.0 package47,48. The periodic natural bond orbital formalism developed by Dunnington and Schmidt49 was applied using Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package software to analyse surface chemical bonding via natural bond orbitals.
Catalytic testing
Catalytic tests were performed in a quartz fixed-bed reactor with 8 mm inner diameter and 24 cm length at atmospheric pressure. 250 mg catalyst with particle size of 20 to 40 meshes was packed inside the quartz tubular reactor. The sample was first heated to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 and maintained at 600 °C for 1.5 h in flowing 18 vol.% H2/N2. Afterwards, a mixture of C3H8, H2 and N2 (16:16:68 vol.%) was fed at a rate of 50 ml min−1. The WHSV of propane was around 4 h−1. The gas products were analysed using an online gas chromatograph (2060) equipped with a flame ionization detector (Chromosorb 102 column) and a thermal conductivity detector (Al2O3 PLOT column). The propane conversion and selectivity for propylene were calculated from equations (2) and (3) respectively:
$${\mathrm{Con.}}\left( \% \right) = 100 \times \left( {\left[ {{\mathrm{F}}_{\mathrm{C3H8}}} \right]_{\mathrm{inlet}} - \left[ {{\mathrm{F}}_{\mathrm{C3H8}}} \right]_{\mathrm{outlet}} }\right)/\left[ {{\mathrm{F}}_{\mathrm{C3H8}}} \right]_{\mathrm{inlet}}$$ (2)
$${\mathrm{Sel.}}\left( \% \right) = 100 \times \left[ {{\mathrm{F}}_{\mathrm{C3H6}}} \right]_{\mathrm{outlet}}/\left( {\left[ {{\mathrm{F}}_{\mathrm{C3H8}}} \right]_{\mathrm{inlet}} - \left. {{\mathrm{F}}_{\mathrm{C3H8}}} \right]_{\mathrm{outlet}}} \right).$$ (3)
Structural characterization
The X-ray diffraction measurements were performed on a Bruker D8 diffractometer operating at 200 mA and 40 kV, employing graphite-filtered Cu Kα as the radiation source. The data points were collected by step scanning with a rate of 6° min−1 from 2θ = 10 to 80°. The crystallite size (d) of copper was calculated with the X-ray broadening technique using the Scherrer equation:
$$d = 0.89\lambda /\left( {B\,\cos \theta } \right).$$ (4)
Here, λ is the wavelength of the radiation source (0.15418 nm), B is the half-width of the strongest diffraction peak in radians and θ is its diffraction angle.
The AC-STEM images were characterized on a JEOL JEM-ARM200F at the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Tianjin University and an FEI Titan Cubed Themis G2 300 at Tianjin University of Technology. The sample powder was ultrasonically dispersed in deionized water and deposited on a cooper grid coated with an ultrathin holey carbon film.
In situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis was performed in a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB 250Xi photoelectron spectrometer using monochromated X-ray irradiation Al Kα (hν = 1,486.6 eV) and a 180° double focusing hemispherical analyser with a six-channel detector. The binding energy of the photoemission spectra was calibrated to the Si 2p peak with binding energy 103.5 eV. After this calibration the low-intensity adventitious carbon peak was in the range 284.0–284.8 eV. Reduction of samples was performed in an ultrahigh-vacuum-connected high-pressure gas cell. The samples were heated in 10% hydrogen diluted in Ar (5 ml min−1 H2 and 45 ml min−1 Ar, total pressure 1 bar) flow from room temperature to 600 °C with a change rate of 10 °C min−1 and then left for 60 min for reduction. The photoelectron spectra were recorded after ultrahigh-vacuum transfer of the samples to an analyser chamber without contact with the atmosphere.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
