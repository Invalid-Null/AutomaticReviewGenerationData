The document does not seem to be relevant, as it does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The document examines dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2, but does not mention conversion of propane to propylene. Since propylene production through PDH or ODH is not the focus, the document does not appear directly relevant.
