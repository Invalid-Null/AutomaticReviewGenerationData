Tetraethylenepentamine-grafted polyacrylonitrile-poly(methyl methacrylate) hollow fibers for low concentration CO2 capture at ambient temperature
In this work, a new type of solid amine sorbent was developed for low concentration CO2 capture at ambient temperature. Polyacrylonitrile(PAN)-poly(methyl methacrylate)(PMMA) porous hollow fibers were firstly prepared by a wet-spinning process. Tetraethylenepentamine(TEPA) was then grafted onto the porous structure of the hollow fibers. The amine modified hollow fibers denoted as TEPA@PAN-PMMA were characterized by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermo-gravimetric analysis(TGA), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller(BET), and scanning electron microscopy(SEM) methods. Performance of the TEPA@PAN-PMMA for CO2 capture was evaluated by passing a 0.3% CO2-N2 gas mixture through the porous matrix of the hollow fibers at ambient temperature. The highest CO2 adsorption capacity reached up to 1.50 mmol g−1 for dry feed, and 3.00 mmol g−1 for wet feed, respectively. Cyclic CO2 adsorption-desorption test indicated that the TEPA@PAN-PMMA sorbents are stable and regenerable.
1. Introduction
Nowadays, the increasing concentration of atmospheric CO2 is one of the most pressing environmental concerns (Yang et al., 2008, Herzog, 2011). Leaving environmental concerns aside, not many people realized the toxicity of CO2, because the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is low (National Oceanic and Atomospheric Administration (NOAA)). However, CO2 could be harmful and needs to be removed from confined spaces, such as manned spacecraft, space station, submarines and deep submerger, where CO2 concentration can reach 5000 ppm (Satyapal et al., 2001). Thus, CO2 capture in confined space is a critical technique.
In the past decades, techniques were developed to remove CO2 from confined space, such as alkali metal oxides (LiOH, soda lime, and K2O), aqueous amine solutions, and solid amines. The primary CO2 sorbent used to remove CO2 in confined space was LiOH (Mao et al., 2006). Although the static CO2 adsorption rate is high, the regeneration processes are not practical. Soda lime was widely used in medical and in refuge chamber for CO2 adsorption (Du et al., 2018). It still has disadvantages, such as, low efficiency, high dust outflow rate. KO2 was employed in confined space to remove CO2 by developing oxygen candles, which can achieve both supply of oxygen and removal of CO2, however, the reaction process is too fast to control, thus, it is not suitable for long-term CO2 adsorption (Gao et al., 2015). Amine has active moiety for CO2 adsorption via chemisorption at low temperature (<100 °C) (Choi et al., 2009, Sanz-Pérez et al., 2016). To date, aqueous amine solutions have been applied to capture dilute or ultradilute CO2 on a large scale (Drage et al., 2009, Rao and Rubin, 2002, Stewart and Hessami, 2005), however, high toxicity, equipment corrosion and high energy requirement for regeneration are some of their drawbacks. Scientific community keep pursuing new CO2 sorbents, which have high capacity, easy operation, environment-benign nature, low production cost, low energy requirement for regeneration, and high physicochemical stability.
Among the new CO2 sorbents, amine-grafted sorbents are potentially suitable for CO2 capture, they show great CO2 capture performance at low temperature (Choi et al., 2009, Sanz-Pérez et al., 2016). In these CO2 sorbents, mesoporous silica (Belmabkhout et al., 2010, Lee and Park, 2015, Zhao et al., 2019), carbonaceous materials (Younas et al., 2016, Chen et al., 2013, Kumar et al., 2015), and metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) (Liu et al., 2011, Shekhah et al., 2014, Zulys et al., 2020) are used as the supports, amines are covalently incorporated into the pore space or onto the pore surface as a strategy to minimize the leaching and improve the thermal stability. Jones et al. prepared the first amine-grafted CO2 sorbent, a robust hyperbranched aminosilicas by reacting mesoporous silicas with aziridine, which were applied to capture CO2 from simulated air (0.04% CO2-N2). The advantage of this CO2 sorbent is high capacity and multicycle stability(Hicks et al., 2008, Choi et al., 2013). Zhou et al. reported a class of amine-grafted organic porous polymers, which have high CO2 capacity, high stability, and low generation cost (Lu et al., 2012). The best MOF for CO2 capture at low concentration reported to date is Mg2(dobpdc) (H4-dobpdc = 4,4′-dihydroxy-(1,1′-biphenyl)− 3,3′-dicarboxylic acid), when coordinated with ethylene diamine and dimethyl ethylene diamine, which have CO2 capacity of 2.83 mmol g−1 and 3.00 mmol g−1 respectively (Lee et al., 2014a, McDonald et al., 2015). These amine-grafted CO2 sorbents have the advantages of easy operation, environment-benign nature, and low energy requirement for regeneration when compared with sorbents. However, there are still some challenges before their extensive commercialization, such as, high production cost, low stability, and low efficiency.
Due to low production cost, tunable pore volume and porosity, self-supported structure, easy to scale up, and high efficiency, hollow fibers have been utilized as membranes in various application (Babu and Koros, 2019, Rezaei et al., 2013, Darvishmanesh et al., 2011, Tan et al., 2008, Feng et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2014a, Wang et al., 2019, Pati et al., 2020, Chen et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2017a, Wang et al., 2015, Song et al., 2021, Pati et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2018, Maneerung et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2016a, Sun et al., 2006, Kathiraser et al., 2013a, Kathiraser et al., 2013b, Maneerung et al., 2014, Yang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2017b, Wang et al., 2016b, Wang et al., 2014b, Yang et al., 2013). We hypothesize to combine the advantages of hollow fiber membranes and solid amine to develop a hollow fiber solid amine with low production cost, high stability, moreover, the hollow fiber solid amine has lower pressure drops at high flow rates along with heat transfer (Darunte et al., 2017).
Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) was applied to prepare hollow fibers, because it is a cheap and good candidate for preparing porous structure. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) could not be fabricated to hollow fiber, however, it could be added into dope solution of PAN to prepare PAN-PMMA composite hollow fiber (Abidin et al., 2020). The ester groups on PMMA are more reactive than nitrile groups on PAN, treated with amines under same condition, more amines would be grafted on the composite hollow fiber, thereby increase the CO2 capacity. Tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) was chosen as the grafting amine, which contains primary (-NH2) and secondary (-NH-) amines, moreover, TEPA-grafted sorbents exhibit higher CO2 adsorption capacity compared to other amine-grafted sorbents (Su et al., 2010).
In this work, TEPA-grafted hollow fibers were prepared by reaction of amine groups with functional groups on the surface of hollow fibers. Their structures, morphologies were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Their dry and humid CO2 capacities, and N efficiencies were investigated by a lab-designed gas adsorption-desorption system.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All the chemicals are commercial available. PAN (Mw = 1.5 × 105 g mol−1) and PMMA (Mw = 1.5 × 105 g mol−1) were applied to prepare hollow fiber. Polyethylene glycol (PEG-2000) was chosen as pore-forming additive. N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), TEPA, propanol were used without any further purification.
2.2. Preparation of TEPA-grafted hollow fibers
To produce spinning dope, firstly, polymer powder (PAN or PAN-PMMA) was dissolved in NMP, the solution was stirred at room temperature for 24 h, and then PEG-2000 was added as pore-forming additive (Tsai et al., 2008). The solution was stirred another 24 h to obtain a homogeneous solution. After that, the dope was kept overnight to degas and eliminate the trapped bubbles. Finally, the dope was transferred into an ISCO syringe pump for spinning. The hollow fibers were spun by a wet-spinning process. Both the dope solution and bore fluid were conveyed by their individual ISCO pumps and co-extruded from a spinneret. The bore fluid was NMP. After being extruded, the pristine hollow fibers traveled through an air gap, entered into a water coagulant bath where the phase inversion took place. The hollow fibers were collected and immersed into deionized water for two days to remove the residual solvent, and then dried under vacuum. Table S1 lists the detailed dope compositions and spinning conditions. The obtained hollow fibers were denoted as PAN or PAN-PMMA.
TEPA-grafted hollow fibers were prepared by reacting TEPA with as-spun hollow fibers. Under protection of N2, hollow fibers were immersed into a solution of TEPA and propanol (w/w 1:2). The solution was heated to make amine groups react with functional groups on the surface of hollow fibers. After grafting, the hollow fibers were washed by deionized water and ethanol, respectively, and then dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 4 h to remove the residual solvent. The obtained TEPA-grafted hollow fibers were denoted as TEPA@PAN or TEPA@PAN-PMMA.
The grafting degree (Gd, %) is calculated based on the following Eq. (1).

where m0 (g) is the weight of hollow fiber before grafting TEPA, and m1 (g) is the weight of hollow fiber after grafting TEPA.
2.3. Characterization
The chemical bonds were investigated by using a FT-IR spectrometer (Nicolet Magna-IR 750) at scanning range from 4000 to 500 cm−1. The thermal stability of hollow fibers was studied by a TGA instrument with a 2050 thermo-gravimetric analyzer. The analysis was carried out with a rate of 10 °C min−1 at temperature ranging from 50° to 800°C. N2 was used as both purge gas and protection gas (50 mL min−1). The specific surface area, pore volume, and mean pore diameter of the hollow fibers were measured with a Micro ASAP 2460, the samples were degassed by heating at 100 °C prior to analysis. The surface morphologies of the hollow fibers were observed by a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Gemini SEM-500, Germany). Cross sections of the hollow fibers were fractured in liquid nitrogen and coated with platinum via sputtering before analysis.
2.4. Adsorption and desorption measurements
Simulation of CO2 capture was performed on a lab-designed gas absorption-desorption system as schematically shown in Fig. 1. The adsorption column (300 mm effective length, 20 mm internal radius) was made of glass and jacketed for the purpose of thermal control. In the column, a bunch of TEPA-grafted hollow fibers were assembled. A N2 flow was fed into the hollow fibers from the inlet, and then the column was heated to 80 °C, to activate the hollow fibers. After cooling to ambient temperature, the N2 flow was switched to a simulated confined space atmosphere (0.3% CO2-N2 gas mixture), the flow rate was 400 mL min−1. The outlet was monitored by an IRME-G infrared gas analyzer, the CO2 concentration was measured and continuously recorded. Water vapor could also be introduced into the gas stream by passing through a water bubbler, which containing CO2 saturated deionized water. To regenerate the hollow fibers, a N2 flow (400 mL min−1) was fed into at 80 °C for 60 min. To evaluate the cyclic stability of the hollow fibers, such an adsorption-desorption procedure was repeated.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Grafting condition optimization
Grafting conditions were carefully screened on PAN hollow fibers. Since these reactions involve amines, N2 protection was necessary. At the beginning, PAN hollow fibers were directly immersed into neat TEPA, however, swelling happened under heating. In order to minimize the swelling effect on PAN hollow fibers, TEPA had to be diluted by solvent. Due to boiling point and viscosity, propanol was chosen as the solvent, a solution of TEPA and propanol (w/w 1:2) was used as grafting agent. The relationship between reaction temperature and grafting degree is shown in Fig. 2, increasing the reaction temperature would lead to a higher grafting degree. After 14 h, the highest grafting degree was achieved at the boiling point of propanol. Prolong the reaction time, the increase of grafting degree is not obvious. Thus, 14 h would be the appropriate reaction time.

3.2. Characterization of TEPA grafted hollow fibers
To confirm that TEPA has been grafted onto hollow fibers, the FT-IR spectra of hollow fibers before and after grafting TEPA were collected. In Fig. S1, the FT-IR spectrum of the PAN hollow fiber is identical to that reported in literature (Yang et al., 2010). The absorption band at 2940 cm−1 is assigned to the stretching vibration of C–H groups. The absorption band at 2245 cm−1 is ascribed to the stretching vibration of CN groups. Compared with PAN hollow fiber, new peaks are found in TEPA@PAN hollow fibers, the characteristic absorption bands center on 3380 cm−1, corresponding to the stretching vibration of N–H groups, and the intensity of these bands increased with the grafting degree from 3.0% to 58.2%. In addition, a broad band at 1568 cm−1 along with a weak band at 1646 cm−1, attributing to the bending vibration of N–H. Bands at 1305 and 1163 cm−1 demonstrate the formation of C–N bonds, which confirmed the reaction between PAN hollow fiber and TEPA. In Fig. S2, PAN-PMMA hollow fiber has a strong band at 1729 cm−1, corresponding to the stretching vibration of CO on ester group. For TEPA@PAN-PMMA hollow fiber, new peaks are found. The characteristic absorption bands center on 3275 cm−1, corresponding to the stretching vibration of N–H groups. In addition, a new band is observed at 1672 cm−1, attributing to the stretching vibration of CO on amide group, which confirmed the reaction of PMMA with TEPA. The band at 1305 cm−1 and an intensified band at 1150 cm−1 demonstrate the formation of C–N bonds, which confirmed the reaction of TEPA with PAN and PMMA.
TGA analysis was used to test thermal stability of TEPA-grafted hollow fibers. As shown in Fig. 3, PAN hollow fiber exhibited high thermal stability and a single-step decomposition at about 300 °C. Thermal analysis of PAN-PMMA hollow fiber indicated PMMA has no effect on its thermal stability. In TGA curve of TEPA@PAN hollow fiber (Gd = 58.2%), two distinct weight loss steps were observed at 150 °C and 280 °C. The weight loss between 150 °C and 280 °C could be attributed to the degradation of grafted TEPA, which indicating TEPA was grafted onto the hollow fiber. In TGA curve of TEPA@PAN-PMMA hollow fiber, the weight loss before 100 °C could be attributed to desorption of solvents, other two distinct weight loss steps were observed at 150 °C and 250 °C. The weight loss between 150 °C and 250 °C could also be attributed to the degradation of grafted TEPA. TGA curves of TEPA-grafted hollow fibers indicated these TEPA-grafted hollow fibers are stable under regeneration temperature.

The adsorption-desorption isotherms of N2 were collected at 77 K to study the effect of TEPA on the pore structures of hollow fibers. The specific surface area of samples was determined by Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method based on the adsorption isotherms. The total pore volume was calculated by converting the adsorption amount of N2 into its liquid volume. Table 1. shows that the addition of PMMA into hollow fiber leads to a decrease in surface area and pore volume, average pore diameter as well. After grafting TEPA onto hollow fibers, smaller surface area and pore volume were observed, which agrees with amine-grafted materials reported in literature (Rezaei and Jones, 2014). In TEPA@PAN hollow fibers, the surface area and pore volume decreased with grafting degree, it could be attributed to the blockage of the pore entrance by TEPA.

Fig. 4. illustrates the morphologies of PAN and PAN-PMMA hollow fibers. Asymmetric structures consisting of dense skin layer on the outer surface were observed. This may be attributed to the phase inversion rate, when the dope solution contacted the external coagulant, due to the direct contacts of dope solution with water, the phase inversion near the outer surface of the hollow fiber was much faster than that near the inner surface of the hollow fiber, thus, a dense skin layer was formed on the outer surface. PAN-PMMA hollow fiber has a thicker wall than PAN hollow fiber, it could be explained by the viscosity variation of the dope solution. With the addition of PMMA, the viscosity of dope solution was increased (Shi et al., 2008), the viscosity of the dope solution has an influence on hollow fiber structure, the dope solution with higher viscosity has thicker wall (L.-Y. Wang et al., 2019). Apart from the wall thickness, PAN and PAN-PMMA hollow fibers both show similar finger-like cross section morphology, however, their inner surface morphologies are different. With the addition of PMMA, the amount of macrovoids on the inner surface increased, Huang reported a similar surface phenomena (Ma et al., 2012). Compared with PAN hollow fiber, PAN-PMMA hollow fiber has larger circular macrovoids on inner surface. The reason could be the shrinking of PMMA during the phase inversion process. Fig. 4 also shows the morphologies of TEPA-grafted hollow fibers. Their cross section morphologies and outer surface seem to be preserved after treatment with TEPA, however, their inner surface are different from their pristine hollow fibers. For TEPA@PAN hollow fiber, the amount of macrovoids on inner surface increased, and the macrovoids are larger than on PAN hollow fiber. For TEPA@PAN-PMMA hollow fiber, the amount of macrovoids on the inner surface decreased, the macrovoids are larger than on PAN-PMMA hollow fiber.

3.3. CO2 adsorption
Under room temperature, the CO2 adsorption capacities of the TEPA-grafted hollow fibers were studied at the concentration of 0.3% CO2-N2, which represents the mean concentration of the gas commonly found in confined space. In order to elucidate the relationship between grafting degree and CO2 capacity, The CO2 adsorption capacities of TEPA@PAN hollow fibers with different grafting degree were evaluated. Fig. 5 shows the effect of grafting degree on the CO2 capacity and N efficiency. The CO2 adsorption capacities were 0.86, 1.01, 1.32 mmol g−1, with grafting degree of 15.1, 39.4, 58.2 wt%, respectively. It could be found that the CO2 capacity increase with grafting degree, but the N efficiency continuously decreases. For TEPA@PAN hollow fibers with low grafting degree, the amine moieties were more dispersible, making the active groups (–NH2 and –NH–) more available. However, when the grafting degree increases, amine moieties would begin to conglomerate within the pore, leading to a poor distribution, and once the pore space was nearly saturated with amine moieties, mass diffusion limits considerably affect the adsorption process, thus, CO2 could not easily access to the available active groups, which leads to a decrease in N efficiency (Yao et al., 2013).

Fig. 5. Dependence of CO2 capacity and N efficiency of TEPA@PAN hollow fibers on the grafting degree.
In TEPA@PAN hollow fibers, the CO2 capacity is mainly determined by the grafting degree, and less dependent on the specific surface area, some remaining pores could ensure the diffusion of CO2 in the sorbent(Chen et al). Increase the TEPA grafting degree in some certain could increase the CO2 capacity. The results in Table 2 indicate that adding PMMA into hollow fiber could improve the grafting degree, thereby, increases the CO2 capacity. The CO2 capacity of TEPA@PAN-PMMA hollow fibers (1.50 mmol g−1) is higher than TEPA@PAN hollow fibers (1.32 mmol g−1).
Table 2. CO2 capacities and N efficiencies of TEPA-grafted hollow fibers at ambient temperature.
Hollow fiber sample Gd (%) Nd (%) dry Γs (mmol g−1) Nh (%) humid Γs (mmol g−1)
TEPA@PAN 58.23 21.42 1.32 21.10 2.60
TEPA@PAN-PMMA 74.85 18.93 1.50 18.93 3.00
When CO2 sorbent is being developed, the effect of moisture on CO2 capacity has to be investigated. The breakthrough curves for CO2 adsorption on TEPA-grafted hollow fibers in the absence and presence of moisture are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. S3. The N efficiencies, dry and humid CO2 capacities of TEPA-grafted hollow fibers are listed in Table 2. In the absence of moisture, the CO2 breakthrough time of TEPA@PAN-PMMA hollow fibers is 14.7 min, while the corresponding time increases to 27.5 min, which means that moisture has a positive effect on CO2 capacity of this sorbent. The total CO2 capacity of TEPA@PAN-PMMA hollow fibers in the presence of moisture is 3.00 mmol g−1, which is 100% higher than the value in dry condition. The mechanisms of CO2 capture are shown in Fig. S4, as reported in literature (Caplow, 1968, Danckwerts, 1979), in the absence of moisture, the mechanism for amines reacting with CO2 requires one CO2 molecule and two amine moieties to give an ammonium carbamate. In the presence of moisture, the mechanism for amines reacting with CO2 requires one CO2 with one amine moiety to give bicarbonate. Thus, the enhancement of CO2 capacity in the moisture could be explained by the generation of bicarbonate instead of carbamate.

Many studies have concentrated on the removal of CO2 from confined space. Zhao et al. demonstrated that activate carbon loaded with K2CO3, could be used to remove CO2 from confined space, the CO2 capacity was 1.01 mmol g−1 (Guo et al., 2015). Long et al. reported a polyethylenimine impregnated HP2MGL CO2 sorbent, which exhibited adsorption capacity of 1.96 mmol g−1 for 400 ppm CO2 and 2.13 mmol g−1 for 5000 ppm CO2 (J.T. Wang et al., 2015). Some typical amine-grafted sorbent used for removing low concentration CO2 reported in the literatures to date are summarized in Table 3. Under similar conditions, TEPA@PAN-PMMA could provide higher adsorption capacity than other amine-grafted CO2 adsorbents reported.

3.4. Regeneration
The regenerability of CO2 sorbent is another important parameter for a long-time operation. To access the regenerability of TEPA-grafted hollow fibers, cyclic CO2 adsorption-desorption test of TEPA@PAN-PMMA hollow fibers were carried out. Within each cycle, a N2 flow was fed into the porous matrix at 80 °C to regenerate the hollow fibers. In Fig. 7, the regenerability of TEPA@PAN-PMMA hollow fibers is demonstrated in 6 repetitive cycles. The results show that the decrease of CO2 capacity was mostly taking place in the first cycle. The decrease of CO2 capacity may be due to the strong chemical interaction between amine moieties and CO2, which leads to an incomplete desorption. The cyclic CO2 adsorption-desorption performance reveals that TEPA@PAN-PMMA hollow fibers are stable, with only 8% lost in the absorption capacity after 6 cycles.

4. Conclusions
In this work, a new type of solid amine CO2 sorbent was prepared by grafting TEPA on hollow fibers. The characterization showed TEPA has been successfully grafted on the surface of the hollow fiber. The simulation of CO2 adsorption results indicate that TEPA@PAN-PMMA hollow fibers possess good adsorption performance at low concentration under ambient temperature. The CO2 adsorption capacities reached up to 1.50 mmol g−1 for dry feed, and 3.00 mmol g−1 for wet feed, respectively. Besides their CO2 adsorption capacities, TEPA@PAN-PMMA hollow fibers possess good stability and regenerability, 6 adsorption-desorption cycle tests were carried out, and only 8% decreased in CO2 adsorption was observed. Owing to their favorable characteristics for CO2 adsorption from low concentrations, the TEPA@PAN-PMMA hollow fibers may be a promising and cost-effective sorbent for CO2 removal from confined space.

Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
