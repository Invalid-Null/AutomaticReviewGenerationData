Abstract
PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts were prepared with co-precipitation method at different pH values (X = 6–12), with the aim of investigating the effect of pH value on their catalytic performance for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. It was found that the co-precipitation pH value could strongly influence the crystalline phase, the specific surface area, the surface morphology, the distribution of surface acidity, the reduction properties of the metal phase, the surface chemical state, the distribution of metal particles, and coke formation, giving rise to different catalytic performance. All the results reveal that the catalyst prepared at pH 8 shows the best catalytic performance; it possesses the primary crystal phase of periclase (MgO) and the highest specific surface area of support, the lowest fraction of strong acidic sites and In0 species, the strongest interaction between the metal phase and support, the highest Pt dispersion (41.6%), the best distribution of Pt particles with the smallest Pt particle size (1.8 nm), and the lowest coke amount. Furthermore, the highest once-though yield of 0.37 mol propylene can be obtained over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8, in which 0.60 mol propane is consumed in a whole dehydrogenation reaction period (28 h).

1. Introduction
In recent years, there has been growing interest in the production of propene by a propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process, since propene is an important raw material for the production of commodity and specialty chemicals [1], [2], [3], [4]. Currently, many studies in PDH are devoted to developing novel catalysts such as ceria-based catalysts [5], Al–Cu catalysts [6], Co/SiO2 catalysts [7], and In2O3–Ga2O3–Al2O3 catalysts [8]. ZnO-modified ZSM-5 (or Y) zeolites [9] and [Fe]ZSM-5 [10] catalytic systems based on novel materials are reported to be considerable catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. However, compared with other catalysts, Pt-based catalysts are still considered as the most promising catalysts used in propane dehydrogenation process, even if with very low Pt content [11], especially with indium as a promoter to further improve catalytic performance [12], [13], [14].
The textural properties of the support materials, such as specific surface area, acid–base properties, and thermal stability, can influence the catalytic performance of Pt-based catalysts for the PDH process [15], [16]. During the past several years, many attempts have been made to investigate the support materials of catalysts for the PDH reaction, such as Al2O3, MgO, SiO2, Zr2O, spinel MgAl2O4 (or ZnAl2O4), and calcined hydrotalcite or hydrotalcite-like materials [12], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. Of all these supports, calcined hydrotalcite (Mg(Al)O) or hydrotalcite-like materials were especially attractive due to their moderate basic characteristics, high thermal stability, and high metal dispersion [23], [24], [25]. Our previous work investigated the influence of Mg/Al molar ratio in Mg(Al)O-x materials prepared by a co-precipitation method on the properties of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-x catalysts, demonstrating that Mg(Al)O material with a Mg/Al ratio of 4:1 was the optimal support material for the PDH reaction [13].
It is well known that various synthesis conditions such as identity of precursor, preparation methods, preparation temperature, molar ratios of metals, and preparation pH value have significant effects on the structural properties of support materials [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. In particular, the pH value in the co-precipitation step is known to be a key factor in the successful design of catalysts. Jeong et al. [32] have prepared a series of Cu/ZnOX catalysts by a co-precipitation method with variation of pH value (X = 6–10), and they clarified the effect of pH value on the catalytic properties and activity of Cu/ZnOX for alcohol-assisted low-temperature methanol synthesis from syngas. Meshkani et al. [33] investigated the influence of pH value on the structural and catalytic properties of Fe–Cr–Cu catalysts prepared by co-precipitation in the high-temperature water gas shift reaction. Jung et al. [34] reported a kind of γ-Bi2MoO6 catalyst and probed the effect of pH in the preparation of the catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butene to 1,3-butadiene. Furthermore, the effects of pH in the preparation of Ni9Fe3Bi1Mo12O51 [35] and ZnFe2O4 [36] catalysts were also verified by them. Based on these reports, it can be noted that no investigation of the effects of pH value in the preparation of Mg(Al)O materials on Pt-based catalysts for the PDH reaction has been reported. This current situation invites us to carry out a systematic study in this field.
The objective of this work is to clarify the effect of pH value in the preparation of Mg(Al)O supports via a co-precipitation method on the properties of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts. The Mg(Al)O-pX supports were synthesized by a co-precipitation method with a variation of pH value, and then bimetallic PtIn catalysts supported by these materials were applied to the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction. Various methods of characterization such as XRD, BET, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), TEM, H2 TPR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), CO chemisorption, temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), thermogravimetry (TG) and NH3 TPD analyses were employed to discuss the correlations between the catalytic properties and performance of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Calcined hydrotalcite (referred to as Mg(Al)O) was prepared by a co-precipitation process and subsequent heat treatment with Mg(NO3)2·6H2O and Al(NO3)3·9H2O as precursors, as described in detail in our previous work [14]. In the preparation process, the solution pH was set at 6, 8, 10, and 12, respectively. The obtained support materials were denoted as Mg(Al)O-pX, where X represents the solution pH value in the preparation process.
PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts were prepared using the same routine as in our previous work [14], and the content of Pt and In in all the catalysts was fixed at 0.6 and 1.5 wt.%, respectively. All the raw materials were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China).
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The XRD patterns of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts were collected on a Bragg–Brentano diffractometer (Rigaku D/Max-2000) with monochromatic Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The textural properties of samples were measured by N2 adsorption–desorption at liquid nitrogen temperature with an automatic analyzer (NOVA 4000, Quantachrome, USA). The morphologies of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts were examined by FESEM (HITACHI S-4800) operated at 5.0 KV. NH3 TPD measurements were implemented to analyze the surface acidity of catalysts. The TEM images of the as-synthesized catalysts were captured with a JEM-2010 microscope operated at 200 kV. H2 TPR experiments were implemented in a programmable temperature system. The XPS of the prereduced PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts was recorded on a Perkin–Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA using Al Kα radiation. The binding energies (BE) were calibrated using the C1s level at 284.8 eV as an internal standard. The Pt dispersion of the prereduced PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts was determined by CO chemisorption on an autosorb-iQ unit (Quantachrome, USA). The spent catalysts were analyzed by TG tests and TPO experiments to describe their coking behaviors. The details of all the characterization experiments can be referred to from our previous work [13], [14].
2.3. Propane dehydrogenation reaction
2.3.1. Catalytic activity measurement
The propane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out in a fixed-bed quartz reactor with 0.3 g fresh catalyst at 620 °C and 0.1 MPa. Prior to the dehydrogenation reaction, the catalyst was reduced with H2 at 580 °C for 2.5 h. Then a feed flow consisting of H2, C3H8, and Ar (H2/C3H8/Ar molar ratio = 7:8:35, WHSV = 3.3 h−1) was added to the reactor. A gas chromatograph (GC, SP-6890) equipped with a FID detector and an AT-PLOT PORA-Q capillary column was employed to analyze the products. The propane conversion and propylene selectivity were calculated from the total number of carbon atoms balance [14].
2.3.2. Calculation of turnover frequencies
On the basis of the dispersion of exposed Pt species in the catalyst, the TOF value was calculated according to the equation
(1)
where Xpropane is the propane conversion, Fpropane is the flow rate of propane in mol min−1, mcat is the amount of catalyst, XPt is the Pt loading in the catalyst, DPt is the dispersion of Pt, and MPt is the molar weight of Pt (195.1 g mol−1).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effect of pH on the structural properties
3.1.1. X-ray diffraction evaluations
Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts prepared at different co-precipitation pH values. All the catalyst samples exhibit well-crystallized patterns; the crystalline phases observed were identified by the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS). From Fig. 1, the characteristic peaks ascribed to spinel MgAl2O4 and periclase (MgO) can easily be observed in PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p6 catalyst prepared under weak acidic condition (pH 6). In contrast, when the Mg(Al)O materials were synthesized under alkali conditions (pH 8, 10, and 12), MgO seems to be the primary crystal phase in the catalysts. These observations suggest that the MgAl2O4 phase can be obtained by the initial preparation of co-precipitation in acidic environment. Additionally, it is interesting to find that PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8 and PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p10 catalysts (prepared at pH 8 and 10) present a minor XRD peak at 2θ = 35°, attributed to meixnerite (Mg6Al2(OH)18·4H2O) [37]. However, no peak appears at this position in the diffraction of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p12 catalyst. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that increasing pH value enhances the intensity of peaks corresponding to the MgO phase when the supports are prepared in an alkali environment, indicating that more crystal phase MgO is formed.

3.1.2. N2 adsorption/desorption
To determine the textural properties of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts, low-temperature N2 adsorption/desorption experiments were implemented. As depicted in Fig. 2a, a type IV isotherm with an obvious H2 hysteresis loop according to IUPAC is present, indicating typical mesoporous materials. The pore size distribution shown in Fig. 2b, as calculated by the BJH method from the desorption branch of the isotherm, displays that all the catalysts contain mesopores with a pore size of 2–5 nm. On the basis of the adsorption/desorption isotherms, the textural properties were calculated and are summarized in Table 1. It can be noted that the specific surface area (SBET) of the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p6 catalyst (102.9 m2/g) is markedly lower than those of the catalysts prepared in alkaline environments. Under alkaline conditions, the increase of –OH groups leads to an increase of negative charge on the surface. Thus an electrostatic repulsion force is established, and more mesopores are formed [29], resulting in a relatively higher SBET than that of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p6 catalysts prepared under acidic conditions. As exhibited in Table 1, the specific surface areas of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts are evidently lower than those of Mg(Al)O-pX supports (Table S1 in the Supplementary Material). This could be attributed to the introduction of the metal components into the mesoporous channels of Mg(Al)O-pX supports during the impregnation process [38]. It is clear that the Mg(Al)O-p8 support has the highest SBET value, and the lowest value is noted over the Mg(Al)O-p6 support. Moreover, as exhibited in Fig. 2b, the pore diameter (Dp) of the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p6 catalyst is distinctly larger than those of other samples. The smallest Dp can be observed over the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8 catalyst.

3.1.3. Scanning electron microscopy analysis
The surface morphology of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts was observed by FESEM analysis, and the micrographs are presented in Fig. 3. Typical mesoporous materials can be noted, which are characteristic of solids consisting of aggregates or agglomerates of particles forming pores. With the variation of the co-precipitation pH value from 6 to 10, the flakelike structure gets much clearer. The clearest slit-shaped pores ascribed to nanoflakes interleaving with each other can be found over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p10 catalyst. Zeng et al. [39] reported a similar structure of Mg–Al-LDH (Mg/Al = 3:1) materials. In contrast to the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p10 sample, as the pH value further increases to 12, the flakelike morphology becomes inconspicuous. Therefore, it is believed that the co-precipitation pH value can strongly affect the surface morphology of catalysts.

3.1.4. NH3 temperature-programmed desorption investigation
To investigate the influence of co-precipitation pH value on the acidity of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts, NH3 TPD analyses were conducted. As depicted in Fig. 4, the NH3 TPD profiles of all the catalysts display a similar shape consisting of three peaks, I, II, and III, in the ranges 190–210, 290–310, and 490–510 °C. As is known, the NH3 desorption in the three regions is regarded as weak, medium, and strong acid sites, respectively [13]. A semiquantitative comparison of the acidic strength distribution is summarized in Table 2, which is achieved by fitting the NH3 TPD curves using the Gaussian deconvolution method. From Table 2, it is found that the temperatures of maximal peak intensity (TM) are almost constant regardless of the co-precipitation pH value, while the peak areas and fractions vary greatly with the pH value. It is clearly found that the total number of acid sites decreases dramatically with increasing pH value, and the total acidity on the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p6 catalyst is much higher than on the other samples (pH ⩾ 8). The results can be explained by spinel MgAl2O4 only appearing over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p6 catalyst, leading to its having the highest total acidity. The existence of MgO can reduce the acidity of the catalysts with pH from 8 to 12 [15]. With respect to the fraction of the strong acid peak, the value increases with the increase of co-precipitation pH from 8 to 12, and the highest fraction can be noted over the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p6 sample among all the catalysts. It has been reported that side reactions can easily be catalyzed by strong acid sites [40], [41], which is adverse to the propane dehydrogenation reaction. Therefore, the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8 catalyst prepared with a co-precipitation pH of 8, which possesses the lowest fraction of strong acid sites, can effectively restrain the undesired side reactions for propane dehydrogenation.

3.1.5. H2 temperature-programmed reduction investigation
To determine the effect of co-precipitation pH value on the reducibility and interaction of the metal components, H2 TPR experiments were carried out and the corresponding curves of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts are illustrated in Fig. 5. It can be clearly observed that all the catalysts present a broad reduction peak with a maximum located at 450–550 °C (peak II) and a shoulder placed at lower temperature (peak I). A single high-temperature peak at ∼ 700 °C (peak III) is also noticeable. As reported previously [13], the peaks I, II, and III are attributed to the reduction of Pt species, the co-reduction of Pt–In, and the reduction of support, respectively. As regards the low-temperature peaks, peaks I and II are incorporative for the catalyst with the co-precipitation pH of 6, suggesting a stronger Pt–In interaction. As the pH increases from 8 to 12, the reduction temperature of peak II gradually shifts to the lower values (540 → 485 °C), indicating that the interaction between the metal components and the support weakens. In this circumstance, a slightly stronger Pt reduction peak can be observed over the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8 catalyst than over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p10 and PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p12. This phenomenon implies that relatively larger amounts of Pt oxide species can be reduced for PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8 catalyst. Moreover, with respect to the high-temperature reduction zone (peak III), the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p6 catalyst exhibits the obviously strongest signal values. One possible explanation is that, over this sample, the existence of spinel MgAl2O4 phase leads to the reduction of more Al cations. As a result, the reduction properties are different depending on the pH value employed during the co-precipitation step.

3.1.6. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis
To investigate the chemical state of metal components, XPS analyses were implemented. Although the most intense photoemission lines of platinum are those arising from Pt4f levels, this energy region is overshadowed by the strong Al2p peak, and thus the Pt4d lines are analyzed instead [42], [43]. The prereduced catalysts present an asymmetric broad Pt4d5/2 peak with binding energy 315.0–345.0 eV in Fig. 6. Interestingly, the spectra of different prereduced catalysts can overlap well, indicating that the chemical states of Pt species on the catalysts surfaces vary little with co-precipitation pH value. Fig. 7 shows the XPS spectra in the In3d5/2 region for various prereduced catalysts before reaction, with a summary of the semiquantitative results in Table 3. In In3d5/2 region spectra, the broad peaks can be decomposed into two well-defined peaks, which can be assigned to the zerovalent and oxidation state of In species on the surface of the catalysts [13], [40], respectively. From Table 3, it is obvious that the highest fraction (67.2%) of indium is in the oxidized state for the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8 catalyst, and an opposite phenomenon can be observed over the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p6 sample. Our previous work [13], [14] indicated that a large amount of In(0) could block Pt active sites, which is adverse to the PDH reaction. As can be seen from Table 3, for each sample, the In0/In3+ molar ratios of the catalyst before and after reaction show little difference. This is in accordance with our previous work [14], which reported that PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p10 catalyst exhibited a stable In0/In3+ molar ratio as the reaction proceeded. The fitting curves of the catalysts after reaction are available in Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Material. In addition, the superficial Mg/Al and In/Pt ratios are listed in Table 3. It can be seen that the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p6 catalyst exhibits the lowest Mg/Al ratio, which can be explained by the spinel MgAl2O4 phase only existing over this sample (XRD investigation), leading to a relatively high proportion of Al atoms. As the pH value varies from 8 to 12, the Mg/Al ratio of the catalyst gradually increases. It is in accordance with the XRD results that more crystal phase MgO is formed. Taking In/Pt ratios of different catalysts into consideration, all the In/Pt ratios are clearly higher than the value (4.2) calculated from the Pt and In precursors. This suggests enrichment of In on the surface of the catalysts. Similar results were also found in previous studies [44], [45].

3.1.7. Effect of pH value on metal distribution
To determine the influence of co-precipitation pH value on the distribution of metallic particle, the TEM images of different catalysts were collected. Fig. 8 shows the TEM images and the corresponding particle size distributions of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts prepared at different co-precipitation pH values (X = 6–12). It can be noted that the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p6 sample exhibits the largest mean Pt particle size, 4.8 nm (listed in Table 4); then the Pt particle size reaches the smallest value of 1.8 nm at pH 8 and gradually grows with the increase of co-precipitation pH value from 8 to 12. At the same time, a relatively narrow distribution of metallic particle sizes can easily be observed over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8 catalyst. These findings demonstrate that the variation of co-precipitation pH value triggers marked differences in the distribution and size of metallic particles, and the catalyst prepared with pH value 8 possesses the best distribution and the smallest mean size of Pt particles. CO chemisorption experiments were also carried out to further confirm the metallic particle distribution; the CO uptake and Pt dispersions are shown in Table 4. It can be seen that the CO uptake and Pt dispersions of different catalysts are contrary to the variation trend to dPt as the co-precipitation pH value. The highest Pt dispersion (41.6%) and the largest CO uptake (12.8 μmol/gcat) can be observed over the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8 catalyst. It can be explained that the Mg(Al)O-p8 support possesses a relatively higher SBET value (Table S1 in the Supplementary Material), leading to better diffusion and dispersion of Pt species [14]. Additionally, TPR analysis verifies stronger chemical interactions between Pt, In, and support (discussed in Section 3.1.5) for the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8 sample, which affects the degree of Pt sintering during calcination and the properties of surface-active metal [46], [47].

3.2. Effect of pH value on catalytic performance
The PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts were subjected to the propane dehydrogenation reaction for 28 h. Our previous work [14] reported that the variation of propane conversion during the long reaction can be divided into three stages, (1) ascent stage, (2) stable stage, and (3) descent stage, which are ascribed to the activity induction, stability, and deactivation of the catalyst, respectively. To investigate the effect of pH value on the catalytic performance, propane conversion and propylene selectivity with the variation of co-precipitation pH value are displayed in Fig. 9. As can be seen from Fig. 9a, the initial propane conversion is lowest (32.7%) for the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p6 sample, and the value attains the highest point (51.7%) for the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8 sample, whereas the initial propane conversion goes down gradually with the further growth of co-precipitation pH. Clearly, the highest and final propane conversions present a variation trend similar to that of the initial propane conversion with the increase of co-precipitation pH value from 6 to 12. The TOF values of different catalysts are calculated for the exposed Pt atoms and included in Table 4. It can be noted that the TOF values (5 min) exhibit a variation regularity similar to that of the Pt dispersions with the variation of co-precipitation pH value. The highest TOF value can be found over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8, indicating that the catalyst displays the high efficiency of Pt when it is prepared at pH 8. For all samples, quick deactivation of PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalysts is observed, which is attributed to the agglomeration of Pt particles, the disappearance of meixnerite crystals, the collapse of catalyst structure, and the formation of a large amount of coke on the active sites [14]. As regards the propylene selectivities summarized in Fig. 9b, it is found that the initial and the highest stable values of propylene selectivity exhibit a regularity similar to that for the propane conversion. As shown in Fig. 9b, the propylene selectivity increases in the initial 3 h and then remains basically stable (above 95.0%) after attaining the highest point. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the best catalytic performance can be obtained over the catalyst prepared with a co-precipitation pH value of 8. The final propane conversion still is above 58.9% after 28 h reaction. Nevertheless, relatively bad catalytic performance is observed over the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p6 catalyst.

Compared with monometallic Pt catalyst (shown in Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Material), the bimetallic PtIn catalyst exhibits higher-level catalytic performance because of the presence of In. In moieties may decrease the acidity of the catalysts, facilitate the reduction of Pt species, and stabilize Pt active sites by forming the sandwich structure of Pt–In2O3–support [13], [14]. In2O3 on the catalyst surface remains stable, and the In0/In3+ molar ratios of the catalyst before and after the reaction show little difference. This is different from previous work [12], [48], which may be due to low In content and a different preparation process of the catalysts in this work.
It is well known that the coke formed during the reaction can cover the active metal sites, which is a major reason for catalyst deactivation [49], [50]. After 28 h of propane dehydrogenation reaction, TPO and TG measurements of the spent catalysts are carried out to investigate coke analysis. It can be seen from Fig. 10 that all the TPO curves of the spent catalysts present two successive peaks, which are attributed to coke on the metallic active sites (at ∼500 °C) and on the supports (at ∼650 °C) [14], [51]. It is clear that for the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p6 catalyst, most of the coke deposits cover the active sites, corresponding to the quick deactivation in Fig. 9a. After pH value is increased to 8, the coke amount on the active metal sites sharply decreases and the coke on the support increases. With further increase of pH to 10–12, the coke formed on the active sites increases and the transference from active sites to the support gradually weakens. These results can be ascribed to the change of Pt particle size in relation to pH values: the absorbed species with smaller Pt particles are more mobile and easily migrate to the support [52], [53]. Moreover, the low-temperature peak for PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8 presents a relatively lower temperature than other catalysts, meaning that the deposited carbon is the most reactive [54]. Coke quantitative analysis (Table 4) is in good agreement with TPO results, which shows that the amount of coke over the spent PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p6 catalyst (20.5%) is much higher than over the other three samples. After pH value increases to 8, an obviously decreased coke amount can be observed. Moreover, the amount of coke over the catalysts prepared in an alkaline environment slightly increases with the increase of pH from 8 to 12.

Fig. 10. TPO profiles of the different catalysts.
The duration of the catalytic activity above 50% is proposed to measure the catalyst stability. Fig. 11 shows the catalytic stability of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation reaction as a function of pH value. Obviously, the stable time (CA > 50%) is shortest (21 h) at the low pH value of 6, whereas the longest time (28 h) can be obtained at a suitable pH value of 8. The results indicate that the catalyst prepared at pH 8 possesses the optimal catalytic stability, and the catalytic activity can remain at a high value (above 50%) during the entire dehydrogenation reaction process.

Fig. 12 displays the once-though propylene yields during the entire 28 h reaction as a function of pH value. The amount of propane consumption in the whole process is 0.6 mol. As shown in Fig. 12, the once-though propylene yield decreases in the following order: pH 8 (0.37 mol) > pH 10 (0.35 mol) > pH 12 (0.33 mol) > pH 6 (0.32 mol). It is obvious that the catalyst prepared at pH 8 possesses the highest propylene yield. These results suggest that a suitable pH value during the co-precipitation process can effectively increase the propylene yield.

3.3. Correlations between pH value, structural properties, and catalytic performance
The XRD results have confirmed that the co-precipitation pH value influences the crystal phase of supports. When the solution in the co-precipitation process is weakly acidic (pH 6), spinel MgAl2O4 and periclase (MgO) coexist over the catalyst, while the meixnerite (Mg6Al2(OH)18·4H2O) phase appears over the catalyst prepared at pH 8 and 10. It has been reported [14] that the catalyst over the meixnerite crystal phase can provide better catalytic performance than that over MgO. This can reasonably explain that the catalysts prepared at pH 8 and 10 display relatively better catalytic performance than other catalysts. An attempt has been made to correlate the pH value with the textural parameters (Table S1 in the Supplementary Material) of the supports. The lowest SBET of the Mg(Al)O-p6 support may be one of the reasons for the low catalytic activity of the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p6 catalyst. Mg(Al)O-p8 and Mg(Al)O-p10 supports have similar and higher SBET values, and Mg(Al)O-p12 has a much lower SBET value. The catalytic performances of the catalysts are closely related to the variation of the SBET values of the supports with respect to pH value. It can be explained that the better diffusion of Pt species in the catalyst with higher SBET support can lead to more active sites. Furthermore, the NH3 TPD results have proved that the different pH values significantly affect the distribution of the acid sites over the catalysts. As shown in Table 2, the catalyst prepared at pH 6 possesses the greatest fraction of strong sites, which can be associated with the lowest initial propylene selectivity (Fig. 9b). However, the smallest fraction of strong sites can be observed over the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8 catalyst, corresponding to the optimal catalytic activity and the highest initial propylene selectivity. TPO and TG analyses coincide well. PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8 possesses a relatively small amount of coke, whereas the largest amount of coke can be noted over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p6. The result may be a reason for the catalytic stability differences (Fig. 11). As regards H2 TPR investigation, the relatively great amounts of Pt oxide species can be reduced for the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8 catalyst, correlated with the best catalytic activity(shown in Fig. 9a). Moreover, the interaction between metal components and support (M–S interaction) weakens when the pH value changes from 8 to 12, in good agreement with the variation of catalytic stability. With respect to XPS analysis, the prereduced PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p6 catalyst shows a large fraction of In0 species, which is obviously greater than other catalysts prepared at pH 8–12. This result leads to the lowest initial propane conversion of the catalyst prepared at pH 6 because the In0 species is adverse for the PDH reaction. TEM investigation and CO chemisorption also certify that pH values can greatly affect the metal particle distributions and Pt dispersions. As depicted in Fig. 8 and Table 4, the Pt particle size of the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p6 catalyst with the lowest Pt dispersion (32.7%) has markedly larger mean metallic particles than those of the other catalysts with co-precipitation pH values of 8–12, corresponding to the worst catalytic performance. However, the best metal particle distribution with the highest Pt dispersion (41.6%) and the smallest Pt particle size of 1.8 nm, favorable to the PDH reaction, can be obtained over the catalyst prepared at pH 8, which is in line with the best catalytic performance.
4. Conclusions
In this work, PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts were prepared by a co-precipitation method with varied pH values (X = 6–12), with the aim of investigating the effect of pH value on the catalytic performance of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. It is found that the co-precipitation pH value could strongly influence the crystalline phases, specific surface areas, surface morphologies, distribution of surface acidity, reduction properties of the metal phase, surface chemical states, distributions of metal particles, and coke formation, giving rise to the different catalytic performance of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-pX catalysts for different pH values. All the results reveal that the catalyst prepared at pH 8 shows the best catalytic performance, possesses a suitable crystal phase and specific area, the lowest fraction of strong sites and In0 species, the strongest interaction between the metal phase and support, the highest Pt dispersion (41.6%), and the best distribution of Pt particles with the smallest Pt particle size (1.8 nm). In addition, the smallest amount of coke (12.4%) can be observed over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8 after reaction. Furthermore, the highest once-though yield of 0.37 mol propylene was obtained over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-p8, when 0.60 mol propane was consumed in a whole dehydrogenation reaction period (28 h).
