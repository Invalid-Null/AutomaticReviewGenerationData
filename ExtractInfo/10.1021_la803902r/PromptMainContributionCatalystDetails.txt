Degradable Nanogels as a Nanoreactor for Growing Silica Colloids
Abstract
Degradable nanogels with cleavable disulfide bonds were designed and used as a catalytic template, providing an alkali microenvironment. Well-defined hybrid silica colloids could be obtained by hydrolyzing tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in the nanogels. The size of silica colloids was found to be dependent on the size of the nanogels. After the removal of nanogels through reduction with 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), mesoporous silica colloids with a rough surface were obtained. The mesoporous structure of the colloids after reduction was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), surface area analysis, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). This work also provides an effective route for the preparation of mesoporous silica nanostructures, which may find wide applications as catalyst templates and drug carriers.

Biological systems employ molecular self-assembly as a ubiquitous method of creating very complex and functionally efficient architectures for establishing biochemical networks. (1) In these networks, chemical reactions usually occur in a strictly confined space with high efficiency. (2) These reactions are usually realized by using well-defined reaction environments that vary from relatively simple nanometer-sized systems, such as enzymes, (3) to micrometer-sized complex assemblies, such as cells. (4) Inspired by biological counterparts, there is growing interest in designing various nanoreactors from the notion of “green chemistry” as well as the expectation of increasing the efficiency of chemical conversions from the laboratory bench to industrial scale. (5) Much work has been reported recently in these fields, and various types of nanoreactors have been proposed, such as nanocapsules based on micellar (6) and vesicular (7) assemblies that are built from low-molecular-weight molecules and macromolecular blocks as well as the use of biomacromolecules (i.e., viruses). (8)
Nanogels with internally cross-linked polymer chains have attracted much attention because of their potential application in various fields, including drug delivery (9) and encapsulation of metals (10) and enzymes. (11) Nanogels have been prepared by traditional methods via microemulsion, (12) inverse miniemulsion, (13) and self-assembly of biopolymers. (14) Although some effort has been expended on the exploration of other applications of hydrogels (e.g., some colloidal nanocomposites or nanoporous silica was obtained by using templates of nanogels or bulk hydrogels, respectively (15-17)), the use of nanogels as nanoreactors has been relatively undeveloped.
In this study, we describe a novel method of synthesizing degradable nanogels via the Michael addition reaction of triethylenetetramine (TETA) or tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) to N,N′-bis(acryloyl)cystamine (BAC). Well-defined nanogels that comprise cleavable S−S bonds and amine groups in their network were fabricated. The disulfide bonds could be degraded rapidly by reducing with DTT, and the amine groups would offer a basic microenvironment in the confined space of the nanogels. Then, the amine-catalyzed hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) would happen in the confined space of the nanogels; subsequently, monodisperse silica particles could be prepared. Because of the inherent cleavable property of disulfide bonds contained in the nanogels, mesoporous silica spheres could be obtained by removing the nanogels.

Materials and Methods
Cystamine dihydrochloride was purchased from Acros and used as received. TETA, TEPA, sodium hydroxide, TEOS, CH3OH, CH2Cl2, 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), and acryloyl chloride were purchased from Shanghai Chemical Reagent Co. and used as received. Deionized water was used in this work.
FT-IR spectra were recorded on an Avatar 360 spectrometer. Samples were pressed into potassium bromide (KBr) pellets. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Unity 300 MHz spectrometer, and TMS was used as an internal standard. The size distribution of nanogels and silica spheres was determined by a particle size analyzer (Nano-ZS ZEN3600). The morphologies of hybrid silica spheres and mesoporous silica spheres were observed on a transmission electron microscope (JEM-100CXa) at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV and a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi JEM-2010) at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV, respectively. X-ray diffraction patterns were measured using Cu Ks radiation (λ =1.5406 Å) on a D8 advance X-ray diffractometer (Bruker). TGA was performed on a TG209 instrument (NETZSCH Co., Germany) under a nitrogen atmosphere from 25 to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The specific surface area of the samples was measured on a surface area analyzer (ST-3000, China) with N2 gas as an adsorbate. The specific surface area of the sample was calculated by using a standard reference material supplied by the manufacturer.
Synthesis of N,N′-Bis(acryloyl)cystamine
In a 250 mL three-necked flask equipped with a thermometer and two 50 mL dropping funnels, cystamine dihydrochloride (17.4 g, 0.075 mmol) dissolved in 60 mL of water was added. After the mixture was cooled to 0−5 °C in an ice bath, a solution of acryloyl chloride (15 mL, 0.225 mmol) dissolved in dichloromethane (30 mL) and a solution of sodium hydroxide (12 g, 0.3 mmol) in 30 mL water were simultaneously added dropwise to the flask under stirring over a total time span of 1 h. The temperature was kept at 0−5 °C. After the completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The raw product was recovered according to the following procedure. The organic phase was separated from the aqueous layer, and the water was extracted with dichloromethane. The collected organic phases were dried over Na2SO4. The suspension was finally filtered off, and the solid was discarded. The solvent was removed in vacuum, and the raw product was washed with water and dichloromethane several times. Finally, N,N′-bis(acryloyl)cystamine was purified by crystallization from ethyl acetate.
Preparation of Nanogels
The nanogels were prepared via the polyaddition of amines to N,N′-bis(acryloyl)cystamine. A typical procedure was as follows. In a two-necked 50 mL flask equipped with a thermometer and two 50 mL dropping funnels, N,N′-bis(acryloyl)cystamine (100 mg, 0.38 mmol) was dissolved in 8 mL of methanol. The solution was degassed by bubbling with N2. The temperature was controlled at 50 °C. Then triethylenetetramine (28 μL, 0.19 mmol) dissolved in 24 mL of water was added dropwise to the flask with a 50 mL dropping funnels. The reaction was carried out under vigorous stirring for 24 h. Afterwards, the obtained nanogels were purified by dialysis (molecular weight cut off of 8000−12 000 g mol−1) against distilled water for 2 days, and the water was refreshed twice daily during this period.
Amine-Catalyzed Hydrolysis of Tetraethyl Orthosilicate in the Nanogels
The purified nanogels were subsequently used for TEOS hydrolysis without centrifugation. The above nanogels were transferred to a two-necked 50 mL flask equipped with a thermometer and a 50 mL dropping funnel. Tetraethyl orthosilicate (500 mg, 2.4 mmol) dissolved in 10 mL of methanol was added dropwise to the flask. The reaction was stirred vigorously and carried out for 24 h at 50 °C. Finally, the obtained silica spheres were purified by dialysis against distilled water/methanol for 2 days, and the solvent was refreshed twice daily during this period. For the degradation of the nanogels, excess DTT was added, and stirring was continued at room temperature, followed by dialysis to remove excess DTT.

Synthesis of BAC Monomers and Nanogels
BAC was synthesized on the basis of a classical reaction involving the N-acrylation of cystamine dihydrochloride with acryloyl chloride. Because of the poor solubility of cystamine dihydrochloride in organic solvent, the reaction was carried out in the mixture of water/dichloromethane. The neutralization of cystamine dihydrochloride proceeded simultaneously with N-acrylation of cystamine dihydrochloride in the water/dichloromethane interface. A molar ratio 3/1 acryloyl chloride/cystamine dihydrochloride was used to ensure complete reaction. The structure of BAC was characterized by 1H NMR. The spectrum is in good agreement with the proposed structure, and the detailed peaks assignment may be found in Figure S1 in Supporting Information.
Very recently, poly(β-aminoester) with pendant primary amine was synthesized via the polyaddition of N-Boc-protected diamine to 1,4-butanediol diacrylate, following by the removal of the N-Boc protective group under anhydrous acidic conditions. (18) Herein, the application of this reaction is extended to the fabrication of novel degradable nanogels by the polyaddition of TETA (or TEPA) to BAC. Because 1 mol of amines could react with 2 mols of the acrylate group in the Michael addition procedure, the molar ratio of amine to acrylate must be strictly kept at 1:2 to obtain the nanogels. The concentration of the reactant is another important factor in preparing the nanogels. High concentration would lead to bulk hydrogel, whereas too low a concentration might lead to un-cross-linked polymers.
Size and Morphology of the Nanogels
The average size of the nanogels at 25 °C is around 190 nm with a low PDI of 0.15 obtained from the particle-size analyzer (Figure 1). TEM observation shows that the nanogels had a regular spherical shape with a size of around 50 nm. The average size from TEM observation is smaller than that obtained from the particle analyzer. Nanogels absorb large amounts of water and exhibit a swollen state in aqueous solution as a result of their hydrophilic network. The shrinkage of the nanogels under TEM observation is mainly ascribed to the collapse of the network accompanied by the evaporation of the absorbed water.

Hybrid Silica Colloids and Their Morphologies
Stober et al., (19) in 1968, reported pioneering work in the synthesis of spherical and monodisperse silica colloids from aqueous alcohol solutions based on the hydrolysis of silicon alkoxides in the presence of ammonia as a catalyst. In the current work, silica colloids were prepared by using the nanogels as a catalytic template. Here, how organosilicate hydrolyze in the microenvironment of the nanogels and what would be fabricated is an important issue. In the course of the reaction, the solution became turbid, indicating the formation of silica colloids. The TEM image (Figure S2-a in Supporting Information) shows that the size of the resulting silica colloids is around 190 nm with a very narrow distribution, which is in good agreement with the size of nanogels used as the nanoreactor. In addition, the TEM image shows that the shells of the silica colloids are relatively smooth. A high-magnification image (Figure S2-b in Supporting Information) also shows that the silica colloids have a core−shell structure, and the shell layer exhibits reduced contrast, suggesting a lower density of the material.
Interestingly, a small quantity of the silica colloids with a small core and a collapsed shell were also found. As seen from TEM images (Figure S2-c,d in Supporting Information), it seems that their shells collapsed onto the carbon grid. Such a deformation of silica colloids might be attributed to the drying process before the TEM observation. However, the shells of most silica colloids are rigid enough to maintain the 3D spherical structure after drying. The above TEM observations suggest that the hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate occurs preferably inside the nanogels. A similar finding was also reported by Pastoriza-Santos et al. (20) for the fabrication of gold nanoparticles in thermoresponsive microgels with a different strategy. The core−shell structure of the silica particle might be ascribed to the solubility discrepancy between the components (i.e., BAC and TETA) of the nanogels. Because the solubility of TETA is much higher than that of BAC, more BAC would be inclined to exist inside the nanogels, which is favorable to the residence of hydrophobic TEOS. This difference might make more TEOS hydrolyze inside the nanogels, subsequently leading to the core−shell structure of the silica colloids in the TEM observation. It was also found that the size of silica colloids is dependent on the size of the nanogels. For example, smaller silica colloids (Figure S2-e in Supporting Information) were obtained when the concentrations of TETA and BAC were reduced by half. A similar reduced size (Figure S2-f in Supporting Information) was also found if TETA was replaced with TEPA while keeping the other condition. Thus-prepared silica colloids are termed hybrid silica colloids, and a schematic illustration of the formation of hybrid silica colloids is shown in Figure 2.

Structure Characterizations of the Hybrid Silica Colloids
The structure of the hybrid silica colloids was characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy. As shown in Figure S3 in Supporting Information, intense absorption bands attributed to the silicate (Si−O) asymmetric stretching vibration of hybrid silica colloids is observed between 1000 and 1300 cm−1. In addition, a broad band centered at 955 cm−1 from the Si−O stretching of silanol (Si−OH) groups confirms unpolymerized silanols in the particles. In addition, the band centered around 800 cm−1 is associated with the symmetrical Si−O stretching vibration. However, the band centered at 1633 cm−1 is assigned to the water bending commonly found in this region. (21) This band is overlapped with the absorbance of C═C groups in BAC. However, absorption bands centered at 1550 and 1440 cm−1 are observed and are attributed to the bending mode of N−H and the asymmetric bending vibration of C−H in nanogels, respectively, indicating the existence of nanogels in silica colloids. After calcination at 400 °C for 24 h, these absorptions disappear but other peaks do not change.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which characterizes the decomposition behavior of the samples during heating, was used to analyze the content of the organic component in the hybrid silica colloids. Figure S4-a (Supporting Information) shows the decomposition behavior of hybrid silica colloids. The TGA result shows that the weight loss of these colloids is divided into three phases. The initial 6.8% weight loss at 0−100 °C, which corresponds to the first peak in the differential thermogravimetry (DTG) curve, is ascribed to the evaporation of the water absorbed in the colloids, further confirming the existence of water, which is in agreement with FT-IR characterization. A further 24% weight loss at 100 °C−400 °C, corresponding to the second peak in the DTG curve, is attributed to the decomposition of the nanogels. In addition, a little weight loss (about 2%) is observed at 400−600 °C and is accompanied by the condensation of silanol groups. Thus, the content of nanogels is calculated to be around 25.7 wt % in hybrid silica colloids. Thermogravimetric analysis of the silica colloids after treatment with DTT was further characterized (Figure S4-b in Supporting Information), and it was found that very low weight loss at 100−400 °C (<3%) was observed, indicating that most of the organic part has been removed.
Mesoporous Properties of the Obtained Silica Colloids
Different from the traditional micellar or vesicular systems, which are difficult to remove, the nanogels with cleavable S−S bonds in the networks would be degradable. In this study, 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), an effective reducing reagent for S−S bonds, was used to destroy the network of nanogels. After reduction with excess DTT, the morphologies of the hybrid silica colloids were further monitored by TEM observation (Figure 3). It is found that silica colloids are still uniform and spherical. However, compared with the colloids before reduction, the silica shells are rough (Figure 3b). Images at higher magnification (Figure 3c,d) show that wormlike pores exist in the silica colloids. Using bulk hydrogel as the pore-formation agent has been reported by Kurumada. (16, 17) Silicas with mesoporous structure were fabricated to arise from the nanoscopic meshlike structure of template gels.

Further evidence of the mesoporous properties of the as-prepared materials could be provided by the nitrogen absorption characterization. The specific surface area of these silica colloids was calculated to be 245.4 m2/g. The mesoporous property of the colloids after reduction was also confirmed by X-ray diffraction as presented in Figure S5 in Supporting Information. The results show no distinguishable peak in the wide-angle region (10−40°), suggesting that the products are pure mesoporous phases without bulky crystals, whereas an obvious peak in X-ray diffraction from 1.0 to 1.7° centered at 1.24° in the low-angle region reveals the existence of mesopores. The d value, corresponding to the intense reflection peak, is calculated to be in the range of 5.1 to 8.4 nm. Compared with the traditional mesoporous silica colloids fabricated by the hydrolysis of organosilicate in alkaline aqueous media with the help of various surfactants that serve as structure-directing agents, (22) our study provides a different method by using degradable nanogels as a template. This method is expected to fabricate other mesoporous colloids on the basis of other hydrolysis reactions such as tetrabutyl titanate and so forth, providing the potential in the catalysis template. One can also using other functional silica precursors co-condensed with TEOS in the hydrolysis procedure to fabricate functional silica colloids that may be useful in drug delivery, absorption separation, and so forth.

We have demonstrated the synthesis of mesoporous silica colloids by using degradable nanogels as a catalytic nanoreactor, which provides an alkali microenvironment. The size of the silica colloids was found to be dependent on the size of the nanogels. After the removal of the nanogels under a reducing condition, well-ordered mesoporous silica colloids with rough shells were obtained. This method would be feasible for fabricating mesoporous colloids on the basis of other hydrolysis reactions such as that for tetrabutyl titanate.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
