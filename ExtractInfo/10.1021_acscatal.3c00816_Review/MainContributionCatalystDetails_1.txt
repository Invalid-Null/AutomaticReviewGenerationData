 Based on the analysis of the supplied document, the main scientific contribution is focused on a review of metal-molecular sieve catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The document does not present experimental results for a specific new catalyst, but rather summarizes recent advances in PDH catalysts based on molecular sieve supports like ordered mesoporous silica (OMS), zeolites, and hierarchical zeolites. Since no single new catalyst is the focus, I am unable to provide the detailed information requested about composition, performance metrics, etc. for the output. The key relevant information from the review is summarized below:
