VOC decomposition over a wide range of temperatures using thermally stable Cr6 + sites in a porous silica matrix




1. Introduction
Porous silica has attracted considerable attention because of its potential uses as a matrix for the synthesis of functional nanomaterials. Recently, Watanabe et al. reported the preparation of supermicroporous silica with pore sizes around 1 nm using a solvent-free method [1].
Trivalent Cr oxide (Cr2O3) is stable at high temperatures and has been reported to function as a catalyst for the decomposition of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at temperatures in the range of 150 to 500 °C [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. In addition, hexavalent Cr oxide (Cr6 +) is a strong oxidizer that is sometimes used for the synthesis of organic compounds as well as for the cleaning of glassware. However, it is also quite hazardous and decomposes to O2 and Cr2O3 above 250 °C [8]. Many researchers have reported the properties of bulk Cr oxides and of Cr species inserted in mesoporous silica with pore sizes of 2.7 to 30 nm [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], and have found that these materials can be used as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of low molecular weight alkanes. It has been suggested that the hexavalent Cr species formed in a silica matrix are stable and work as active sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation process. As an example of the preparation of Cr oxides in a mesoporous silica matrix with small pore sizes, a Cr-MCM-41-like mesoporous silica (with a pore size of approximately 2.7 nm), prepared by a direct insertion method in which the Cr precursor was added during the synthesis of the silica matrix, exhibited good catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation of propane with carbon dioxide [23]. However, Cr-MCM-41 prepared by an impregnation method in which the Cr species was inserted by soaking the as-prepared porous silica matrix in a solution containing the Cr precursor generated a low yield for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene [12].
In this study, we prepared Cr oxides in porous silica matrices having small size pores (0.7, 1.2, 2.4 (2.5) or 3.0 nm) using a high-concentration Cr precursor in conjunction with an impregnation method. This work demonstrated that pore sizes of 1.2 nm were suitable for the generation of Cr6 + species. For the first time, such Cr6 + sites were applied as a recyclable oxidizer and catalyst for decomposition of VOCs, and were found to function over a wide range of reaction temperatures, starting from ambient.
2. Experimental
The porous silica matrix was prepared by a solvent-free method [1] as follows. A 1 mol (eq.) portion of tetramethyl orthosilicate was combined with 0.6 or 0.8 mol (eq.) of a surfactant (butyltrimethyl ammonium chloride, hexyltrimethyl ammonium bromide, tetradecyltrimethyl ammonium bromide and trimethylstearyl ammonium chloride were applied for 0.7, 1.2, 2.4 and 3.0 nm pore sizes, respectively) and 4 mol (eq.) of water, acidified to a pH of 2 with HCl. The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature until complete gelation. The gel was dried at 60 °C for 24 h and calcined under ambient air at 600 °C for 3 h. The Cr precursor was inserted in the as-prepared porous silica matrix using an impregnation method. An aqueous solution of chromium nitrate (1, 1.5 or 2 mol/L) was impregnated into the porous silica matrix, which had been previously dried under vacuum for 5 h. After 1 h, the porous silica, now containing the Cr precursor, was washed with toluene and ethanol to remove the precursor solution on its outer surface. Finally, the sample was calcined at 600 °C for 3 h to prepare the Cr species in the pores of the silica matrix.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using a PHI QuanteraII spectrometer (Physical Electronics GmbH) with a monochromatic Al K X-ray source (100 μm, 25 W). Binding energies were referenced to C (1 s) at 285 eV. Nitrogen adsorption experiments were performed at − 196 °C using a BELSORP-max apparatus (Nihon Bell Co.). The samples were out-gassed at 150 °C for 2 h prior to measurements. The total pore volumes of the silica matrices were estimated based on the amount of N2 gas adsorbed at − 196 °C. The specific surface areas were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method [30]. The average pore diameters were estimated from the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms, using the grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) method [31]. The Cr/Si atomic ratios were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis, using an XGT-7200 instrument (HORIBA Co.). Thermogravimetry (TG) analyses were conducted using a DTG-60 H apparatus (Shimadzu Co.), during which the atmosphere was changed repeatedly between dry air with and without 600 ppm of gaseous ethanol (0.5 L/min flow) at 300 to 407 °C. The gaseous ethanol was produced using a standard gas generation system interfaced to the DTG-60H apparatus, by connecting a diffusion tube containing liquid ethanol to a permeation apparatus set at 40 °C. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was performed using an IRT-5000 (JASCO Co.).
The catalytic activity of each sample was measured using a temperature programmed reaction method. The reactor was connected to the above standard gas generation system to obtain a continuous gas flow with VOCs as the oxidant. As above, a diffusion tube containing solvents such as ethanol was placed in the permeation apparatus, which was set at 30–50 °C, to generate a constant amount of gaseous VOCs. Dried air was used as the carrier gas at a flow of 100 ml/min. The catalyst sample (0.25 g) was packed in a Pyrex reactor (φ 1.1 mm) and the sample temperature was raised from 30 to 430 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min, during which the VOC was combusted to generated CO2 and H2O. The concentrations of unreacted VOC and generated CO2 in the outflow gases were analyzed on-line by gas chromatography (Agilent, Micro GC 3000) using Porapak Q and Porapak N packed columns with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
3. Results and discussion
The variations in the chemical states of Cr species with the pore sizes of the matrix were determined from XPS spectra, as shown in Fig. 1. The signals at 579 and 577 eV were assigned to hexavalent chromium (Cr6 +) and trivalent chromium (Cr3 +) species, respectively [32]. The spectrum of the sample with a 0.7 nm pore size (Fig. 1a) was unclear, suggesting that detecting Cr species by XPS was difficult because the Cr/Si atomic ratio was low (Table 1) and the Cr species in the inner parts of the pores were masked by silica. The spectrum of the sample having a 1.2 nm pore size (Fig. 1b) demonstrated that primarily Cr6 + species had been formed in the silica matrix. However, trivalent chromium species (Cr2O3) were identified in the samples with 2.4 (Fig. 1c), 2.5 (Fig. 1e) and 3.0 nm (Fig. 1d and f) pores. It has been noted in previous reports [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29] that the generation of stable Cr6 + species is accelerated by the interaction between the chromium species and the silica surfaces (Cr–O–Si bonds). Our data, therefore, show that smaller pores tend to increase these interactions. When using a 2 mol/L Cr(NO3)3 solution as the Cr precursor, the samples made with pore sizes of 0.7 and 1.2 nm were yellow (Fig. 1a) and red (Fig. 1b), respectively, while the samples made using pore sizes of 2.4 and 3.0 nm were dark green (Fig. 1c and d). 1.0 and 1.5 mol/L Cr(NO3)3 solutions in conjunction with pore sizes of 2.5 and 3.0 nm gave dark green (Fig. 1e) and yellow green (Fig. 1f) specimens, respectively. The average pore diameters, BET surface areas and the Cr/Si atomic ratios are summarized in Table 1. The 0.7 and 1.2 pore size material isotherms were Type I while the 2.4 and 3.0 nm pore size material isotherms were Type IV according to the IUPAC classification system. The BET surface areas and the Cr/Si atomic ratios were all found to increase with increasing pore sizes.

Fig. 2 shows the temperature programmed reaction curves obtained using the sample having Cr6 + species deposited in the porous silica with a pore size of 1.2 nm under flowing air contain ethanol. The experimental trials were carried out to demonstrate the possibility of VOC decomposition using the Cr6 + species. In these trials, the temperature of the reactor was raised continuously from 30 to 430 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min and ethanol was used as a model VOC. Almost no ethanol (and no byproducts) was detected during heating of the reactor from 30 to 430 °C, while CO2 generation resulting from the combustion of ethanol was observed starting at approximately 200 °C and peaking around 325 °C (Fig. 2a). The maximum level of generated CO2 (4600 ppm) observed during the combustion exceeded the maximum real-time concentration of 1200 ppm that had been estimated based on the complete combustion of 600 ppm ethanol. The extra CO2 may have originated from the combustion of tar that had been earlier accumulated in the pores during the oxidation of ethanol at lower temperatures, as the result of the strong oxidation properties of the Cr6 + species. The integrated value of the CO2 peak (Fig. 2a) was in good agreement with the amount of CO2 estimated from the quantity of ethanol supplied at lower temperatures (30–230 °C). These data suggest that the Cr6 + species promoted oxidation (such that the Cr6 + was gradually reduced to Cr3 + during the oxidation of the VOC) at lower reaction temperatures. The amount of water generated was also assessed by gas chromatography, and the water production trend was similar to that for CO2 (data not shown). The color of the 1.2 nm pore size sample was observed to transition from red to black during the reaction of gaseous ethanol at ambient temperature (30 °C) (Fig. 3a and b). From this result, it is likely that the ethanol was oxidized to high molecular weight, high boiling point, black-colored products and that these materials were subsequently adsorbed in the pores of the silica matrix. It was also found that CO2 could be generated by heating the blackened sample in air without the presence of VOCs, and that the peak CO2 generation under these conditions occurred at 300–350 °C, indicating the combustion of the adsorbed products (data not shown). Evidence for the presence of organic compounds containing oxygen was also found in the FT-IR spectra of the blackened sample in Fig. 3b (data not shown). After calcination at 400 °C in air, the specimen regained its red coloration (Fig. 3c), suggesting that the Cr6 + species could be regenerated at high temperatures. Fig. 2b and c (inserted for reference purposes) show the temperature programmed curves obtained using bulk Cr2O3 (30 wt.% + silica sand (nonporous)) and the porous silica matrix only (average pore size: 1.2 nm), respectively. The bulk Cr2O3 catalyst did not work as a catalyst at lower temperatures and so ethanol was observed in the outgoing gases until a reaction temperature of ca. 300 °C. The porous silica matrix was found to function solely as an adsorbent around room temperature, such that ethanol was not detected at ambient however it was desorbed around 150 °C. No ethanol combustion was observed over the entire range of temperatures tested.

To assess the state of the Cr species during reaction, TG measurements were carried out in air containing ethanol. The Cr6 +-containing silica sample with a pore size of 1.2 nm was used in these trials. Fig. 4 shows the weight changes of the sample in an air flow either with or without ethanol at temperatures from 300 to 407 °C. The sample weight was decreased by reduction of the sample due to the release of the oxygen around the Cr species in the lattice. In preliminary investigations, it was observed that the mass of a silica sample containing Cr6 + species was decreased during the reduction of the sample (that is, during the change to Cr3 +), while the original mass was recovered by re-oxidation of the sample (meaning the regeneration of Cr6 +). At higher reaction temperatures (407 and 350 °C), the mass loss under the condition of air containing ethanol was minimal, while the catalyst weight returned to its initial value when supplying air without ethanol at the temperatures shown in Fig. 4a and b. This result demonstrates that the regeneration of the Cr6 + species was accelerated at such temperatures. In addition, at 300 °C (Fig. 4c), the catalyst weight did not recover even in air without ethanol, thus the oxidation of the Cr species (regeneration of Cr6 +) was not accelerated. On the basis of these results, it was concluded that the regeneration of the Cr6 + species was promoted at or above 350 °C. No mass change was observed in the case of the bulk Cr2O3 under the same conditions as in Fig. 4a, as shown in Fig. 4d.

Finally, temperature programmed reaction trials using other VOCs, including 1-butanol (ca. 90 ppm, Fig. 5b), ethyl acetate (ca. 430 ppm, Fig. 5c), methyl ethyl ketone (ca. 390 ppm, Fig. 5d), hexane (ca. 400 ppm, Fig. 5e) and toluene (ca. 300 ppm, Fig. 5f), were also performed under the same conditions employed with ethanol (ca. 600 ppm, Figs. 4a and 5a), with the results shown in Fig. 5. Similar trends were observed in the case of each of these VOCs, although poor oxidation activities were observed at lower temperatures for ethyl acetate (Fig. 5c) and hexane (Fig. 5e).

4. Conclusion
Cr species were inserted into porous silica matrices with pore sizes of 0.7, 1.2, 2.4, 2.5 or 3.0 nm, using a high-concentration precursor. The generation of thermally stable Cr6 + species was predominant when porous silica with a pore size of 1.2 nm was used. It was observed that the Cr6 + species worked as an oxidizer for the decomposition of VOCs, and that Cr6 + could be regenerated by heating above 350 °C. These stable Cr6 + species can be applied as an oxidizer/catalyst for VOC emission control over a wide range of reaction temperatures, starting from ambient, by making use the powerful oxidizing ability of Cr6 +. We therefore anticipate that these findings will enable the development of new methods for the control of VOC emissions.
