 Based on the provided information, it appears that the document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. Since multiple extractions indicate the document focuses on VOC decomposition using Cr species in porous silica, with no mention of propane conversion, I would summarize as follows:
