Zirconia-Supported MoOx Catalysts for the Selective Oxidation of Dimethyl Ether to Formaldehyde:  Structure, Redox Properties, and Reaction Pathways
Abstract
Dimethyl ether (DME) reacts to form formaldehyde with high selectivity at 500−600 K on MoOx−ZrO2 catalysts with a wide range of MoOx surface density (0.5−50.1 Mo/nm2) and local structure (monomers, oligomers, MoO3 crystallites, and ZrMo2O8). Reaction rates (per Mo-atom) increased markedly as MoOx surface density increased from 2.2 to 6.4 Mo/nm2 and two-dimensional polymolybdates and MoO3 clusters became the prevalent active species. The rate of incipient stoichiometric reduction of MoOx−ZrO2 samples in H2 also increased with increasing MoOx surface density, suggesting that catalytic turnovers involve redox cycles that become faster as the size and dimensionality of MoOx domains increase. DME reaction rates (per Mo-atom) decreased as MoOx surface densities increased above 6.4 Mo/nm2, as MoO3 and ZrMo2O8 clusters with increasingly inaccessible MoOx species form. On MoOx and ZrMo2O8, areal reaction rates reach a constant value at MoOx surface densities above 10 Mo/nm2, as the exposed surfaces become covered with the respective active species. ZrMo2O8 surfaces were more reducible in H2 than MoOx surfaces and showed higher areal reaction rates. Reaction rates were nearly independent of O2 pressure, but the reaction order in DME decreased from one at low pressures (<40 kPa) to zero at higher pressures (>60 kPa). DME reacts via primary pathways leading to HCHO, methyl formate, and COx, with rate constants k1, k2, and k3, respectively, and via secondary HCHO conversion to methylformate (k4) and COx (k5). Primary HCHO selectivities (and k1/(k2 + k3) ratios) increased with increasing MoOx surface density on MoOx-containing samples and reached values of 80−90% above 10 Mo/nm2. Kinetic ratios relevant to secondary HCHO reactions (k1/[(k4 + k5)CAo]; CAo inlet DME concentration) also increased with increasing MoOx surface density to values of ∼0.1 and 0.8 on MoOx and ZrMo2O8 structures (at the constant inlet DME concentration CAo), respectively. Thus, increasing the coverage of ZrO2 surfaces with MoOx or ZrMo2O8 leads to more selective structures for HCHO synthesis from DME.

1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Many recent studies have addressed the conversion of methane to chemicals and transportation fuels. 1-6 An attractive route to chemicals involves the selective conversion of methane to formaldehyde2,7-12 and the subsequent conversion of formaldehyde to larger molecules containing C−C bonds. Formaldehyde (HCHO) synthesis via direct oxidation of methane with O2 leads to low yields, because of fast sequential HCHO decomposition and combustion reactions. Most previous studies have reported HCHO yields below 5%,7-10 but HCHO yields as high as ∼18% have been recently reported.5,11,12 As a result, indirect routes for methane conversion to chemicals and liquid fuels are industrially practiced; for example, formaldehyde is produced via the synthesis of methanol from synthesis gas (H2/CO) and its subsequent oxidative dehydrogenation to HCHO. Here, we report an alternate route to HCHO via the selective oxidation of dimethyl ether (DME) produced from H2/CO mixtures.
Fe−Mo oxides and Ag-based catalysts 13,14 are currently used for methanol oxidation to HCHO. The pathways and catalyst requirements for this reaction have been widely studied. 14,15 Lattice oxygen atoms are used in rate-limiting steps involving hydrogen abstraction from adsorbed methoxide species (CH3O-δ). These methoxide species can also be formed via cleavage of weak C−O bonds in DME (CH3OCH3), 16,17 but previous reports consist of only a few patents. 18-22 The limited scope of these previous reports reflects the historically higher cost of DME relative to methanol; direct synthesis gas routes to DME, however, have been recently developed and they provide more favorable thermodynamics and economics than methanol synthesis. 23-25 A potential DME distribution infrastructure in some developing countries and the benign properties of DME as a fuel24,25 also render it attractive as an alternate intermediate for the synthesis of chemicals currently produced from methanol.
These considerations led us to examine the catalytic chemistry of DME and specifically its oxidative conversion to HCHO on supported metal oxides. Well-dispersed domains of metal oxides, predominately present as two-dimensional structures, provide an effective balance between reactivity and accessibility of oxide surfaces. Our preliminary studies identified MoOx and VOx as the preferred active oxides. 26 MoOx domains supported on Al2O3, ZrO2, or SnO2 showed high primary HCHO selectivities (80−98%). 26,27 HCHO formation rates on these catalysts were significantly higher than previously reported,18-22 even at temperatures much lower than in these earlier studies.
Here, we describe a detailed study of the reducibility, structure, and catalytic properties of ZrO2-supported MoOx samples with a wide range of MoOx densities; surface densities were varied by changing the Mo content and the thermal treatment conditions. These samples consist of MoOx domains of varying size and dimensionality or of surface layers of MoOx−ZrO2 mixed oxides, depending on the thermal treatment and the MoOx surface density. This study addresses the structural and site requirements for primary and secondary pathways relevant to DME oxidation reactions. It also explores the redox nature of the catalytic sequence involved in HCHO synthesis and the fundamental relationships among the size, structure, and reducibility of MoOx domains and their catalytic reactivity.

2.1. Synthesis of Catalytic Materials. MoOx/ZrO2 was prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of precipitated ZrO(OH)2 with aqueous (NH4)2Mo2O8 solutions (99%, Aldrich). 28,29 ZrO(OH)2 was prepared via precipitation of zirconyl chloride solutions (98%, Aldrich) at a pH of 10, maintained constant by continuous addition of NH4OH (29.8%, Fisher Scientific). The precipitated solids were washed with a NH4OH solution of pH ∼8 until Cl ions were no longer detected by AgNO3 in the filtrate and then dried overnight in ambient air at 393 K. The impregnated solids were also dried overnight in ambient air at 393 K and then treated in flowing dry air at 723, 773, or 873 K for 3 h. The Mo content was set by the Mo concentration in the impregnating solution.
These MoOx/ZrO2 samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and UV−visible, Raman, X-ray absorption near-edge (XANES), and fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopies.28,29 BET surface areas were measured using N2 at its normal boiling point. MoOx surface densities are reported as Mo/nm2 using the measured Mo contents and BET surface areas. Table 1 shows a summary of the Mo contents, BET surface areas, and surface densities for the samples used in this study.

2.2. Stoichiometric Reduction of MoOx/ZrO2 in H2. Reduction rates of MoOx/ZrO2 were measured using H2 as the reductant and a Quantasorb surface area analyzer (Quantachrome Corporation) modified with electronic mass flow controllers. MoOx/ZrO2 samples (10 mg Mo) were placed in a quartz cell (4 mm-i.d.) containing a quartz thermowell in contact with the samples. The temperature was increased linearly from 298 to 1253 K at 0.167 K s-1 in flowing 20% H2/Ar (1.33 cm3s-1) (Matheson UHP). The H2 content in the effluent was measured by thermal conductivity after the H2O formed during reduction was removed from the effluent stream using a 13X molecular sieve trap held at ambient temperature. The conductivity detector response was calibrated from the complete reduction of CuO powders (99.995%, Aldrich). Reduction rate constants were obtained from the initial rates of H2 consumption using previously reported kinetic analysis protocols. 30,31
2.3. Dimethyl Ether Catalytic Oxidation Rates and Selectivities. Dimethyl ether reaction rates and selectivities were measured in a fixed-bed quartz microreactor using MoOx/ZrO2 samples (0.3 g) diluted with quartz powder (1.0 g) in order to avoid temperature gradients within the catalyst bed. Samples were treated in flowing 20% O2/He (0.67 cm3 s-1) for 1.5 h at 723, 773, or 873 K before catalytic measurements. Catalytic rates and selectivities were measured at 453−553 K, typically using a mixture of DME (80 kPa; 99.5%, Praxair), O2 (18 kPa), and N2 (2 kPa) (Praxair, certified O2/N2 mixture). For kinetic measurements, DME, O2, and H2O partial pressures in the reactant stream were varied in the ranges 5−80 kPa, 5−40 kPa, and 0−15 kPa, respectively. Homogeneous DME reactions were detected only above 593 K in empty reactors. Water was added to DME/O2 reactant mixtures by passing a controlled flow of 20% H2/He over a bed of CuO/Al2O3 (13 wt %, Aldrich) held at 623 K in order to combust all the H2 to H2O using the lattice oxygen atoms in CuO. All transfer lines after the introduction of H2O were kept above 393 K in order to prevent condensation.
The reactor effluent was analyzed by on-line gas chromatography (Hewlett-Packard 6890 GC) using a methyl silicone capillary column (HP-1, 30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness) connected to a flame ionization detector and a Porapak Q packed column (80−100 mesh, 1.82 m × 3.18 mm) connected to a thermal conductivity detector. Methanol, formaldehyde (HCHO), methylformate (MF), CO, CO2, H2O, and traces of dimethoxymethane (DMM) were the only products detected. Detailed HCHO calibrations were carried out in order to ensure that neither decomposition nor oligomerization of HCHO occurred in the transfer lines, the on-line sampling valve, or the chromatograph injector or column.
Reaction rates and product selectivities were measured as a function of DME conversion, which was varied through changes in reactant flow rate between 1.5 and 10 cm3 (STP)/g s-1. DME conversion levels were kept below 10% and DME reaction rates and selectivities were extrapolated to zero residence time in order to obtain primary reaction rates and selectivities. DME reaction rates and selectivities are reported in two ways. One method considers CH3OH as a reaction product, while the other lumps any CH3OH formed with unreacted DME and considers selectivities on a CH3OH-free basis. The latter approach seems appropriate in view of the available pathways for DME−CH3OH interconversion and for CH3OH conversion to HCHO. All selectivities are reported on a carbon basis as the percentage of the carbon atoms in the reacted DME appearing as each product.

3.1. Effects of Reactant Residence Time. DME conversion rates are shown in Figure 1 as a function of reactant residence time at 513 K on 20.7% MoOx/ZrO2 (21MoOx/ZrO2 in Table 1) (treated in air at 773 K; 6.4 Mo/nm2 surface density). The ZrO2 support in this sample is predominately covered by two-dimensional polymolybdate species.28,29 DME conversion rates decreased slightly with increasing residence time as a result of the weak H2O inhibition effects discussed below. The primary DME reaction rate was 12.2 mol/g-atom Mo-h. CH3OH, HCHO, methylformate (MF), dimethoxymethane (DMM), and COx (CO + CO2) were detected in the reactor effluent. The selectivity for the predominant HCHO product decreased with increasing residence time and DME conversion (Figure 1), while methylformate, dimethoxymethane, and COx selectivities concurrently increased. The selectivity to CH3OH was essentially independent of residence time. The primary selectivities to CH3OH (23.0%), HCHO (57.1%), MF (15.5%), DMM (0.3%), and COx (4.1%) were all nonzero, indicating that these products can be formed directly from DME.
Figure 1 DME reaction rates and selectivities as a function of reactant residence time at 513 K on 21MoOx/ZrO2 (6.4 Mo/nm2) treated at 773 K (80 kPa CH3OCH3, 18 kPa O2, 2 kPa N2).
Figure 2 shows the effects of residence time on DME conversion rates and selectivities at 513 K on 44MoOx/ZrO2 treated at 873 K (50.1 Mo/nm2). This sample consists predominately of ZrMo2O8 and ZrO2.28,29 The primary products and the effects of residence time on DME conversion rates were similar to those observed on 21Mo/ZrO2 (6.4 Mo/nm2; Figure 1), which contains predominately two-dimensional polymolybdate structures. The effects of residence time on HCHO selectivities were much weaker on 44Mo/ZrO2 (50.1 Mo/nm2) than on 21Mo/ZrO2 (6.4 Mo/nm2). Thus, it appears that ZrMo2O8 structures catalyze secondary HCHO reactions less effectively than the polymolybdate domains prevalent in 21Mo/ZrO2 (6.4 Mo/nm2) (cf. Figures 1 and 2).
Figure 2 DME reaction rates and selectivities as a function of reactant residence time at 513 K on 44MoOx/ZrO2 (50.1 Mo/nm2) treated at 873 K (80 kPa CH3OCH3, 18 kPa O2, 2 kPa N2).
CH3OH selectivities remained almost constant with changes in residence time on all catalysts. CH3OH appears to form in a parallel path, possibly involving hydrogen transfer among the methoxide species also involved in HCHO formation. In view of these parallel pathways and of the catalytic routes available for the concurrent dehydration and oxidative dehydrogenation of CH3OH, we consider CH3OH products as part of the DME reactant pool and we report hereinafter rates and selectivities on a CH3OH-free basis.
3.2. Effects of CH3OCH3, O2, and H2O Concentrations on Reaction Rate and Selectivity. The effects of varying CH3OCH3, O2, and H2O partial pressures on DME conversion rates and selectivities were examined on several MoOx/ZrO2 (3.5, 6.4, 8.4, and 50.1 Mo/nm2) samples with MoOx or ZrMo2O8 structures. The observed kinetic responses were very similar on all samples. Here, we show detailed kinetic results only on 44MoOx/ZrO2 (50.1 Mo/nm2; treated at 873 K); this sample contains predominately ZrMo2O8.
Figure 3 shows primary DME conversion rates and primary selectivities to HCHO, MF, and COx at 493 K and 9 kPa O2 as a function of DME partial pressure (10−80 kPa) without water in the reactant mixture. Primary DME conversion rates increased almost linearly with DME partial pressure from 10 to 40 kPa, and then more weakly at higher DME pressures, until reaction rates became nearly independent of DME pressure above 60 kPa. This behavior suggests surface saturation by one or more DME-derived reactive intermediates as DME pressure increases. Primary MF (14.8%) and DMM (1.0%) selectivities were almost independent of DME pressure, while primary COx selectivities decreased from 6.0% to a constant value of 1.5% as the DME pressure increased from 10 to 40 kPa. Concurrently, HCHO selectivities increased from 78.3 to 82.7% (Figure 3).
Figure 3 Effect of DME partial pressure on primary DME reaction rates and selectivities to HCHO, MF, and COx at 493 K on 44MoOx/ZrO2 (50.1 Mo/nm2) treated at 873 K (9 kPa O2, 1 kPa N2, He balance).
The effects of O2 partial pressure were examined at DME pressures of 20 and 80 kPa (Figure 4a,b), which correspond to regimes in which DME reaction orders are near-first and -zero, respectively (see Figure 3). Primary DME conversion rates at 20 kPa DME were unaffected by O2 partial pressure in the range 5−40 kPa (Figure 4a). An increase in O2 pressure from 5 to 20 kPa at 80 kPa DME led to a slight increase in primary DME conversion rates (Figure 4b); thus, reaction rates are nearly independent of O2 partial pressure throughout this DME concentration range. Primary selectivities were also essentially unaffected by O2 partial pressure (Figure 4). The addition of water (15 kPa) to DME/O2 reactant mixtures at levels higher than those prevalent during DME reactions led to a decrease in DME conversion rates (from 1.4 to 1.0 mol/g-atom Mo-h) without significant changes in primary selectivities (Figure 5). These water inhibition effects are consistent with the small decrease in DME conversion rates observed with increasing reactant residence time and DME conversion (Figures 1 and 2).

3.3. Effects of MoOx Surface Density on DME Reaction Rate and Selectivity. The structure of the MoOx domains present on MoOx/ZrO2 depends on MoOx surface density and thermal treatment.28,29 X-ray diffraction and UV−visible and Raman spectroscopic studies have shown that MoOx/ZrO2 samples contain two types of MoOx structures. For surface densities above 5 Mo/nm2 and thermal treatments at 873 K or higher temperatures, samples contain predominately ZrMo2O8 structures; similar treatments led to two-dimensional polymolybdates and MoO3 crystallites (denoted as MoOx structures) for samples with lower surface densities.28,29 At all surface densities, MoOx/ZrO2 samples treated in air at 723 or 773 K contained predominately two-dimensional polymolybdates and MoO3 crystallites.28,29 The structural evolution of MoOx domains from monomolybdates, to two-dimensional polymolybdates, and ultimately to three-dimensional MoO3 crystallites was confirmed by the monotonic decrease in the UV−visible edge energy observed with increasing MoOx surface density.28
Figure 6a shows the effects of MoOx surface density and of the concurrent structural and compositional changes on primary DME reaction rates (per Mo-atom). On samples containing predominately MoOx structures, these rates increased with increasing MoOx surface density; they reached a maximum value at ∼6.4 Mo/nm2, and then decreased at higher Mo surface densities. On ZrMo2O8 species, DME reaction rates decreased monotonically as the MoOx surface density increased from 8.4 to 50.1 Mo/nm2. At each (nominal) surface density, ZrMo2O8 samples showed higher rates (per Mo-atom) than MoOx/ZrO2 samples consisting of polymolybdate domains and MoOx clusters. Treatment of 11MoOx/ZrO2 at 873 K led to a 2-fold increase in DME reaction rates relative to those measured after treatment at 723 or 773 K (Figure 6a), even though Mo surface densities were essentially unchanged by this treatment (3.2−4.5 Mo/nm2) (Table 1).
Figure 6 Dependence of primary DME reaction rates normalized per Mo atom (a) and per catalyst surface area (b) on MoOx surface density for MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts (pretreated in air at 723 K (□), 773 K (○), and 873 K (▵, ▴)) (513 K, 80 kPa CH3OCH3, 18 kPa O2, 2 kPa N2).
DME reaction rates normalized per (BET) total surface area are shown in Figure 6b for all samples. These rates increased monotonically with increasing MoOx surface density and reached a constant value of 0.08 mmol/m2-h at surface densities above 6.4 Mo/nm2 for MoOx species (two-dimensional polymolybdates or MoO3 crystallites). These areal rates were unaffected by surface density on ZrMo2O8-containing samples (0.45 mmol/m2-h), but they were significantly higher than on samples containing MoOx species.
The effects of MoOx surface density and local MoOx structure on primary selectivities are shown in Figure 7a−c. On MoOx-containing samples, primary HCHO selectivities increased with increasing MoOx surface density and they reached a value of ∼90% for surface densities above 10 Mo/nm2. HCHO selectivities on ZrMo2O8 species were slightly lower (∼80%); they were not influenced by MoOx surface density (Figure 7a). Methylformate selectivities on MoOx-containing samples decreased with increasing surface density to a constant value of ∼7% for surface densities above 10 Mo/nm2. On ZrMo2O8 samples, methylformate selectivities were very similar (∼15%) at all Mo surface densities (8.4−50.1 Mo/nm2) (Figure 7b). Primary COx selectivities decreased to ∼4% at Mo surface densities above 10 Mo/nm2 on MoOx samples; they were also ∼4%, but they were not influenced by MoOx surface density on ZrMo2O8 samples (Figure 7c).
Figure 7 Dependence of primary selectivities to HCHO (a), MF (b), and COx (c) on MoOx surface density for MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts (pretreated in air at 723 K (□), 773 K (○), and 873 K (▵, ▴)) (513 K, 80 kPa CH3OCH3, 18 kPa O2, 2 kPa N2).
Our recent transient and isotopic studies, taken together with the observed zero-order O2 dependence of DME rates and selectivities (Figure 4a,b), suggest that DME reactions occur via a redox mechanism using lattice oxygen atoms at rates apparently limited by C−H bond cleavage in adsorbed methoxide (CH3O*) intermediates. 32 C−H bond activation in CH3O* species would involve the incipient reduction of MoOx structures and the formation of low steady-state concentrations of reduced centers, which are continuously reoxidized by O2 in order to complete a catalytic turnover. Therefore, the strong observed effects of MoOx surface density and structure on DME reaction rates may reflect the ability of MoOx domains to undergo local reduction during each catalytic turnover. This proposal is confirmed by measurements of the reducibility of MoOx/ZrO2 samples reported in the next section, which show a parallel increase in the rates of stoichiometric reduction in H2 and of catalytic DME oxidation as MoOx surface density increases.
3.4. Reduction Rates of MoOx/ZrO2 Samples in H2. Reduction rates of MoOx/ZrO2 in H2 were measured from the incipient rate of hydrogen consumption and oxygen removal as the sample temperature increased from 298 to 1253 K. The incipient reduction rates in H2 for a given metal oxide reflect the removal of a few oxygen atoms, leading to surfaces with an extent of reduction similar to that prevalent during steady-state catalytic reactions involving redox cycles, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes. 31,33 The stoichiometric reduction of oxides with H2 involves H2 dissociation and the formation of surface OH groups similar in structure to those formed via H-abstraction from methoxy groups during HCHO synthesis from methanol or DME on oxide surfaces.
Figure 8a shows H2 reduction rates for MoOx/ZrO2 samples treated in air at 873 K. Two reduction peaks are apparent and their relative intensities are consistent with the sequential reduction of Mo6+ to Mo4+ and of Mo4+ to Mo0.31,34,35 The low-temperature peak shifts from ∼730 K to ∼685 K as the MoOx surface density increased from 0.5 to 8.4 Mo/nm2. An additional shoulder appears at ∼645 K for the sample with 8.4 Mo/nm2 (Figure 8a), but the same 21MoOx/ZrO2 sample treated at 723 K (5.6 Mo/nm2) or 773 K (6.4 Mo/nm2) lacks this feature. This feature corresponds to the reduction of Mo6+ to Mo4+ in Mo−O−Zr structures present in ZrMo2O8, which forms only after treatment at 873 K. These data suggest that the rates of Mo6+ to Mo4+ reduction steps are higher on larger MoOx structures than on smaller ones; they are also higher on ZrMo2O8 domains than on polymolybdate structures.
Figure 8 (a) Temperature-programmed reduction profiles for MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts treated at 873 K in air; (b) initial H2 reduction rate at 623 K as a function of MoOx surface density and MoOx structure for MoOx/ZrO2 samples (pretreated in air at 723 K (▴), 773 K (·), and 873 K (▪)).
In-situ X-ray absorption studies during reaction have shown that few reduced Mo4+ centers (<5%) are present during DME reactions at 513 K on these samples.32 Thus, the very initial stages of Mo6+ to Mo4+ reduction steps are most relevant to the redox dynamics required in catalytic DME reactions. We have previously reported an analysis protocol for the kinetics of these incipient reduction processes;30,31 these methods are used here in order to extract initial H2 reduction rates. These rates are reported in Figure 8b as a function of MoOx surface density for samples treated at 873 K, for 21MoOx/ZrO2 treated at 723 and 773 K, and for 11MoOx/ZrO2 treated at 773 K (3.5 Mo/nm2). In samples with low surface densities (0.5−6.4 Mo/nm2) and containing predominately MoOx monomers and oligomers, initial H2 reduction rates increased markedly with increasing surface density (Figure 8b), except for 11MoOx/ZrO2 treated at 873 K (4.5 Mo/nm2), which showed a higher reduction rate than all other MoOx-containing samples. The ZrMo2O8-containing sample (8.4 Mo/nm2, treated at 873 K) showed a higher reduction rate than those containing predominately oligomeric MoOx structures (Figure 8b).
4. Discussion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The nonzero primary selectivities for CH3OH, HCHO, MF, DMM, and COx (Figures 1 and 2) show that these products can be formed directly from dimethyl ether. Primary HCHO products react in secondary reactions that lead to a decrease in HCHO selectivity with increasing residence time. The concurrent increase in methylformate and COx selectivities implicate these species as products of secondary HCHO reactions. The small effects of residence time on CH3OH selectivities indicate that CH3OH is less reactive than HCHO or DME on these catalysts. DME hydration reactions do not appear to be responsible for the formation of CH3OH, because CH3OH formation rates are unaffected by the increase in H2O concentration that accompanies an increase in DME conversion. Instead, it appears that CH3OH forms via hydrogen transfer between CH3O* adsorbed species, with the ultimate formation of one CH3OH and one HCHO molecule.32 Similar selectivity trends were observed on samples containing MoOx and ZrMo2O8, suggesting that primary and secondary reaction pathways are similar on ZrMo2O8 and MoOx domains.
The observed effects of residence time on selectivity are consistent with the reaction pathways shown in Scheme 1. These pathways include primary DME reactions to form CH3OH, HCHO, MF, and COx, and reactions of HCHO (to MF and COx) and of MF (to COx). DMM formation from DME is not included in the kinetic analysis, because of the low DMM selectivities observed (<1%). The weak effects of residence time on CH3OH selectivity led us to neglect secondary reactions of CH3OH in our kinetic analysis.
Scheme 1:  Reaction Network for Dimethyl Ether Reactions on MoOx-Based Catalysts
At low DME and O2 conversions, DME and O2 concentrations are essentially independent of residence time and at the low H2O concentrations prevalent at these DME conversions, the inhibiting effects of water on reaction rates (Figure 5) can be neglected. For the DME (80 kPa) and O2 (18 kPa) pressures of this study, reaction rates for each primary DME reaction in Scheme 1 can then be assumed to be pseudo zero-order in DME and O2 (Figures 3 and 4b) and given by
where ri is the rate of reaction i per Mo atom and ki is the pseudo zero-order rate constant for reaction i.
The kinetics for secondary HCHO reactions to form MF and COx (Scheme 1) are likely to show a complex dependence on DME partial pressure. The nearly constant DME partial pressure along the catalyst bed allows the rates of these secondary reactions to be expressed only as a function of the concentration of the primary product involved in a given secondary reaction, which increases as DME conversion increases along the catalyst bed:
In these equations, rj is the rate of reaction j per Mo atom and kj is the pseudo first-order rate constant for reaction j, and CB is the HCHO concentration. The dependence of HCHO selectivity (CH3OH-free basis) (SB) at relatively low DME conversions is then given by
in which SB° is the primary HCHO selectivity, CAo is the inlet DME concentration, and υ is the g-atom Mo/inlet molar DME rate (g-atom Mo-s/mol DME) (see details in Appendix). The values of k1, k2, and k3 can be estimated from the primary rates for HCHO, MF, and COx formation (CH3OH-free). The value of [(k4 + k5)CAo] can be obtained from the dependence of SB on υ given by eq 7.
HCHO selectivities and yields depend on the relative rates of primary reactions that form HCHO, MF, and COx and of secondary HCHO reactions that also form MF and COx (Scheme 1). The k1/(k2 + k3) ratio provides a measure of the primary selectivity to HCHO, while the k1/(k4 + k5) ratio reflects the relative rates of primary HCHO formation and of secondary HCHO reactions to form MF and COx. The k1/(k4 + k5) ratio can be reflected by the k1/((k4 + k5)CAo) ratio for a given inlet DME concentration, CAo. Higher values of k1/(k2 + k3) and of k1/((k4 + k5)CAo) lead to higher HCHO selectivities at all DME conversion levels. Taken together, these two kinetic parameters determine the maximum attainable HCHO yields in DME oxidation reactions.
Figures 9a and 9b show the effects of MoOx surface density on k1/(k2 + k3) and k1/((k4 + k5)CAo) values, respectively. As MoOx surface density increases in MoOx-containing samples, k1/(k2 + k3) values initially increased and then reached a constant value (∼8) at surface densities above 10 Mo/nm2. On ZrMo2O8-containing samples, k1/(k2 + k3) values were ∼4 and they were unaffected by MoOx surface density (8.4−50.1 Mo/nm2). These trends in rate constant ratios parallel those discussed earlier for primary HCHO selectivities on MoOx/ZrO2 as a function of MoOx surface density for samples with the two predominant types of MoOx species (Figure 7a).
Values of k1/((k4 + k5)CAo) ratios increased to constant values of ∼0.09 and ∼0.80 as the MoOx surface density increased on MoOx and ZrMo2O8 samples at the constant CAo, respectively (Figure 9b). Thus, it appears that exposed ZrO2 surfaces favor secondary HCHO reactions to form MF and COx; these secondary reactions do not appear to reflect the presence of Mo−O−Zr structures, which become less abundant as MoOx domains grow with increasing MoOx surface density, because ZrMo2O8 surfaces actually show much lower secondary reaction rates. The k1/((k4 + k5)CAo) ratios on ZrMo2O8 domains are much larger than on MoOx domains and they lead to the weaker effects of residence time on HCHO selectivity observed on ZrMo2O8 surfaces compared with MoOx surfaces (Figures 1 and 2). These effects of MoOx surface density and MoOx domain structure differ somewhat from those reported for propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) on MoOx/ZrO2.28 In that case, ZrMo2O8 domains led to higher ODH areal rates and to higher COx selectivities in both primary and secondary oxidation reactions. Also, first-order rate constants for propene combustion (k3‘) were much higher than for propane dehydrogenation (k1‘) (k1‘/k3‘ ∼ 0.03)28 on ZrMo2O8, while primary HCHO synthesis rate constants (k1) are similar to those for secondary HCHO reactions (k4+ k5) on ZrMo2O8. This reflects, at least in part, the relative energies of the bonds involved in DME and alkane primary and secondary reactions. While the allylic C−H bonds in propene (361 kJ/mol) are much weaker than the secondary C−H bonds in propane (401 kJ/mol), the difference in the dissociation energy for C−H bonds in DME (389 kJ/mol) and HCHO (365 kJ/mol) are smaller than between propane and propene (24 vs 40 kJ/mol). Also, while propene is expected to bind more strongly than propane on Lewis acid sites (Mo6+) because its π-bond makes it more basic than propane, the lone-pair electrons of oxygen in DME lead to its stronger adsorption on acid sites relative to HCHO.14,36,37 Taken together, the molecular properties of reactants and products in these two reactions appear to account for the higher attainable yields for oxidative reactions of DME compared with similar reactions of propane.
Figure 9 Dependence of k1/(k2 + k3) ratios (a) and k1/((k4 + k5)CAo) ratios (b) (CAo:  inlet CH3OCH3 concentration) on MoOx surface density for MoOx/ZrO2 catalysts (pretreated in air at 723 K (□), 773 K (○), and 873 K (▵, ▴)) (513 K, 80 kPa CH3OCH3, 18 kPa O2, 2 kPa N2).
In contrast with the strong dependence of k1/(k2 + k3) and k1/((k4 + k5)CAo) values on MoOx surface density, these two kinetic parameters did not change significantly with changes in the partial pressures of DME, O2, and H2O. These changes in k1/(k2 + k3) values led to the small parallel effects on primary HCHO selectivity observed with changes in DME, O2, and H2O pressures shown in Figures 3−5. The k1/((k4 + k5)CAo) values increased from 0.26 to 0.31 and from 0.28 to 0.34 with increasing the DME and H2O partial pressures in the range 10−80 kPa and 0−15 kPa, respectively; the k1/((k4 + k5)CAo) values remained almost constant (∼0.27) as the O2 partial pressure changed from 5 to 40 kPa. This indicates that HCHO selectivities and maximum attainable yields at a given DME conversion level depend only slightly on the partial pressures of DME, O2, and H2O.
The activity of surface sites on MoOx domains for DME oxidation to HCHO depends sensitively on the structural evolution induced by an increase in the MoOx surface density (Figure 6a,b). The predominant presence of MoOx monomers and two-dimensional oligomers in MoOx/ZrO2 samples with surface densities below 6.4 Mo/nm2 exposes most MoOx species at surfaces, where these species are accessible to reactants. As a result, the measured DME reaction rates (per Mo atom) represent turnover rates (per exposed MoOx). These turnover rates increase with increasing MoOx surface density (0.5−6.4 Mo/nm2) (Figure 6a), indicating that the reactivity of MoOx surfaces increases as the size and dimensionality of MoOx domains increases. These higher turnover rates parallel the higher initial H2 reduction rates (per Mo atom) measured for larger domains (Figure 8b). The more facile reduction of larger domains, and the consequently faster catalytic redox cycles, reflect more effective delocalization of the negative charge by these larger domains. These electronic effects also lead to lower absorption edge energies in the UV−visible spectrum of larger domains, as a result of the effectiveness of larger domains in delocalizing the electrons transferred from the oxygen atoms to the metal centers in the electronic transition responsible for the absorption edge in the UV−visible spectrum.33
DME reaction rates (per Mo) decreased with increasing surface density in more densely packed surfaces (>6.4 Mo/nm2) (Figure 6a), in which polymolybdate and three-dimensional MoO3 crystallites become the predominant structures. DME reaction rates decreased with increasing nominal MoOx surface density on ZrMo2O8 throughout the entire surface density range (8.4−50.1 Mo/nm2) (Figure 6a). On both MoOx and ZrMo2O8 structures, this reflects the nucleation of three-dimensional clusters, which render an increasing fraction of the MoOx species inaccessible to reactants by placing them within crystallites. The surface density required for maximum rates (per Mo) on MoOx-containing samples (6.4 Mo/nm2) is slightly higher than the theoretical polymolybdate monolayer value (∼5.0 Mo/nm2). 38 This reflects a compromise between the lower accessibility and the higher reactivity of MoOx surfaces as the size and dimensionality of MoOx domains increase.
MoOx surface density effects on areal DME reaction rates (Figure 6b) confirmed these conclusions. Areal rates and primary HCHO selectivities both reached constant values at Mo surface densities of ∼10 Mo/nm2 on both MoOx (0.08 mmol/m2-h; 90%) and ZrMo2O8 (0.45 mmol/m2-h; 80%), but the rates are significantly higher on ZrMo2O8 surfaces. These constant values indicate that all exposed surfaces contain predominately MoO3 and ZrMo2O8 species with active surface structures, the kinetic behavior of which is unaffected by further increases in size or dimensionality. This could reflect a similar surface reactivity for two-dimensional and three-dimensional MoOx structures, or merely the predominant contribution from polymolybdate monolayers on ZrO2 or surface layers of ZrMo2O8 to the exposed surfaces , without significant contributions from any large MoO3 crystallites also present. The higher areal rates measured on ZrMo2O8 samples are consistent with their more reducible nature, as shown by the rate of their stoichiometric reduction in H2 (Figure 8b). The more reducible nature of ZrMo2O8 appears to reflect a structure consisting of two-dimensional networks of alternating MoO4 tetrahedra and ZrO6 octahedra (corner-shared), which differs markedly from the layers of corner-sharing MoO6 octahedra in MoO3 crystallites. The atomic connectivity between Mo6+ and the less electronegative Zr4+ cations in ZrMo2O8 may favor the electron transfer and the activation of Mo−O bonds during the reduction in H2 and the DME reaction.
Figure 10 shows the observed parallel increase in primary DME reaction rates (per Mo atom, at 513 K) and initial reduction rates in H2 (per Mo atom, at 623 K) with increasing MoOx surface density. These data correspond to samples in which most Mo species are exposed at surfaces, because only then catalytic reaction rates and reduction rates reflect their respective surface reaction rates. These data clearly show that the effects of domain size and the differences between MoOx and ZrMo2O8 surfaces in HCHO synthesis from DME arise from the varying ability of such species to reduce as part of the kinetically relevant C−H bond activation steps within catalytic cycles. Similar trends were observed for DME reactions on MoOx species on other supports27 and on dispersed VOx domains. 39 These correlations between the reducibility of the active oxides and their activity parallel similar effects reported for other oxidation reactions involving MoOx and VOx lattice oxygen atoms and Mars-van Krevelen redox cycles, such as the oxidative dehydrogenation reactions of alkanes30,31,33,40 and alcohols.15,41-43

ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Dimethyl ether conversion to formaldehyde occurs with high selectivity at ∼500 K on MoOx−ZrO2. Reaction rates are significantly higher than those reported previously in the patent literature. The catalysts used consist of MoOx oligomers and ZrMo2O8. Dimethyl ether reaction rates (per Mo atom) increase markedly with increasing MoOx surface density in the 2.2 to 6.4 Mo/nm2 range as two-dimensional polymolybdate domains grow and ultimately form MoO3 clusters. The rates of reduction of these materials in H2 increase in parallel with increasing MoOx surface density, suggesting that redox cycles and kinetically relevant reduction steps are involved in dimethyl ether reactions and that the rate of such steps increases with increasing reducibility of MoOx domains. Reaction rates are nearly zero-order in O2, while the dependence on dimethyl ether decreases from first-order at low pressures (<40 kPa) to zero-order at higher pressures (>60 kPa). These kinetic dependences are consistent with this proposal. Above 6.4 Mo/nm2, reaction rates decrease with increasing surface density because MoO3 and ZrMo2O8 (after treatment in air at 723−773 and 873 K, respectively) with increasingly inaccessible MoOx species form. Reaction rates (per BET surface area) approach constant values as exposed surfaces become entirely covered with active MoOx or ZrMo2O8. The latter are more reducible in H2 than MoOx surfaces and show higher areal HCHO synthesis rates. DME reacts directly to form HCHO, methyl formate, and COx, with pseudo zero-order rate constants k1, k2, and k3. Methylformate (k4) and COx (k5) also form in secondary reactions of HCHO. The primary formaldehyde selectivity (and the relevant kinetic ratio, k1/(k2+ k3)) increases with increasing MoOx surface density on MoOx-containing samples and reaches values of 80−90% above 10 Mo/nm2. The kinetic ratio describing the extent of secondary reactions (k1/((k4 + k5)CAo)) also increases with increasing MoOx surface density to values of ∼0.1 and 0.8 on MoOx and ZrMo2O8 structures (at the constant inlet DME concentration CAo, respectively. It appears that more selective active sites form as ZrO2 surfaces become increasingly covered with MoOx or ZrMo2O8 structures, which leads to more selective structures for the synthesis of HCHO from dimethyl ether.

The conversion of DME (A) in a plug-flow reactor for the reaction scheme in eqs 1−4 is given at relatively low conversions (or at any conversion in the zero-order reaction regime) by
where
The solution to this equation is
The HCHO concentration (CB) and molar rates (FB) are given by
where FAo is the inlet molar DME rate and the rate constants are those for eqs 5 and 6 in the text. At relatively low DME conversions, changes in the total number of moles can be neglected and eq A3 becomes
in which CAo is the inlet DME concentration and the inlet HCHO concentration is assumed to be zero. The solution to this equation is
The HCHO selectivity (SB) (CH3OH-free basis) is then given by
When the observed selectivity changes as a result of changes in υ are small, a series expansion of the exponential to second-order term two gives
where the primary HCHO selectivity SB° (CH3OH-free basis) is
The primary selectivity is obtained from the y-intercept of a HCHO selectivity vs υ plot; the slope of the plot is − (1/2)(k4 + k5)CAo, from which the reported values of [k1/(k4 + k5)CAo] are readily obtained.

        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
