The provided document does not contain information related to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The document focuses on kinetics and catalyst deactivation studies of propane dehydrogenation to propylene over a Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. However, it does not provide details on catalyst composition, performance metrics, or feed composition that are necessary to extract the requested information. While propane dehydrogenation is mentioned, the core focus is on modeling conversion data to estimate kinetic parameters, not on evaluating a novel catalyst or process design for PDH or ODH.
