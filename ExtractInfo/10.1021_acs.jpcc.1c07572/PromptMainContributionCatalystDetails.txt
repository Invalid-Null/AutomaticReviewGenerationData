Mechanism of Selective Hydrogenation of 4-Nitrophenylacetylene Using Pt–Zn Intermetallic Nanoparticles: The Role of Hydrogen Coverage
Abstract
Selective hydrogenation of the nitroaromatics containing other reducible functional groups is very important, but the mechanism still remains controversial. Inspired by recent work on the excellent transformation of 4-nitrophenylacetylene into 4-aminophenylacetylene using the Pt–Zn intermetallic nanoparticles as catalysts (Nat. Commun. 2019, 10, 3787), theoretical investigations have been performed to unravel the mechanism. Both the positive Zn species and the moderate hydrogen coverage were found to profoundly affect the adsorption structures and the bonding strength of the functional groups, thus dramatically affecting the adsorption selectivity. In contrast to the bare surface that the hydrogenation of the −C≡C group competes with the −NO2 group, the overall barrier for the hydrogenation of the −NO2 group on the 12H–PtZn (022̅) model is 0.90 eV, much lower than those of the −C≡C group for various intermediates by at least 0.28 eV, well explaining the experimental observation of the very high selectivity and conversion. The computational results strongly support that the pre-adsorbed hydrogen greatly changes the adsorption modes of the reactants and alters the reaction mechanism and, therefore, should be carefully evaluated for the hydrogenation of nitroaromatics on metal surfaces.

Hydrogenation is one of the most important chemical processes in modern industries because it is estimated that about 25% of chemical transformations include one hydrogenation process or more, and thus, the development of effective catalysts for target reactions is among the most intensive topics in catalysis. (1) Moreover, in fine chemical industries, the selective hydrogenation of one substrate with two or more functional groups is very important but remains a huge challenge. As key building blocks for many fine chemicals, including pharmaceuticals, surfactants, agrochemicals, and so on, the aromatic amines are produced from the corresponding nitroarenes, (2) which are usually structurally decorated with many different functional groups such as alkene, alkynes, ketones, aldehydes, making it a great challenge for chemoselective hydrogenation. For example, 3-nitrostyrene is considered as one of the most challenging substrates, and its chemoselective hydrogenation is regarded as a probe reaction because the −C═C group is much easier to be adsorbed and then reduced over many catalysts than the −NO2 group. (3) Noble metal-based catalysts are widely applied in heterogeneous catalysis because of their high activities; however, these traditional catalysts have problems differentiating the functional groups in one substrate. The low reaction selectivity using monometallic Pt/C, Pd/C, and bimetallic Au–Pt, Au–Pd can be greatly enhanced when the Au nanoparticles are supported on TiO2 or Fe2O3, mainly because the supports show high selective adsorption over the −NO2 group. (4,5) Clearly, the adsorption modes and selective adsorption of the −NO2 group greatly determine the selectivity of the hydrogenation for the functionalized nitroarene. Following this idea, many strategies, including the design of bimetallic catalysts such as Pt–Zn intermetallic nanoparticles, have been carried out to alter the electronic properties of the surfaces in order to obtain proper surface acidity/basicity for the potential catalysts. (1,6−17)
To our surprise, the mechanism for the selective hydrogenation of the nitro group from nitroaromatics still remains controversial, although many theoretical works have been performed. A simple reactant model such as nitrobenzene was usually adopted to represent the nitroaromatics containing reducible functional group, for example, −C═C, when density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to unravel the reaction mechanism. (18−24) Recently, Corma and co-workers (18) reported that the activation barrier for the activation of the −C═C bond (styrene was used as a model) is lower than that for the nitro group (nitrobenzene was used as the model) using Ni(111) as the catalyst model, which is controversial to the experimental results that the selectivity is above 80% for the hydrogenation of 3-nitrostyrene to 3-vinylaniline. However, their kinetic calculations combined with experiments imply that the hydrogenation of the −C═C bond is thermodynamically not favored on Ni, and the reaction rate is greatly dependent on the concentration of reactants and H2. These results hint that the bare metal surface model is not able to give the correct mechanism.
4-Nitrophenylacetylene (4-NPA) has two functional groups, that is, −NO2 and −C≡C, and thus, it is highly challenging to transform 4-NPA to 4-aminophenylacetylene (4-APA), which are important intermediates of fluorescent labels and antitumor agent Erlotinib. (8,25) Very recently, Han and co-workers (26) developed an interesting catalyst with PtZn intermetallic nanoparticles supported on hollow nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (HNCNTs), and the experimental results show that a surprisingly high conversion of over 99% and selectivity of 98% were achieved for the selective hydrogenation of 4-NPA to 4-APA, much superior to the Pt isolated single atomic sites and Pt nanoparticles on HNCNTs. However, the reaction pathways were not comprehensively investigated because only the first hydrogenation steps for the two competing groups of 4-NPA were investigated based on one model of 4-NPA/PtZn (022̅), which was found to be insufficient for two reasons. On the one hand, different adsorption structures should be well considered according to the calculations in this study. On the other hand, the previous reports show that the first hydrogenation step is not the rate-determining step for the hydrogenation of nitroarenes using many catalysts. (18,20−24) A few studies reported all the elementary steps for the reduction of nitro groups from nitroaromatic reactants. (18,23) To our surprise, complete reaction pathways for the nitro group and the other bearing functional group (such as −C═C and −C≡C) using a single substrate were not reported on metal surfaces, whereas nitrobenzene and styrene were usually adopted as models to represent the nitro and C═C groups of nitroaromatics, respectively.
The bare metal surface model bears weakness in the hydrogenation reactions due to the neglect of the hydrogen coverage or other species, usually leading to overbinding of the reactants and the products, thus rendering the exploration of the true reaction pathways at the experimental conditions. (27−32) For example, Wang et al. (28) reported that the hydrogen coverage profoundly changes the energy profile compared to that on a clean Pd(111) surface and induces a selectivity reversal from furan as the main product to furfuryl alcohol, suggesting that the hydrogen coverage is important to correctly unravel the hydrogenation mechanism. Therefore, it is vital to consider the hydrogen coverage in order to correctly understand the reaction mechanism. Herein, a catalyst model with a reasonable H coverage is proposed. Then, the whole reaction pathways for the chemoselective hydrogenation of 4-NPA are obtained, and the energy barriers for the hydrogenation of −C≡C and −NO2 groups are analyzed, based on which the reaction mechanism is discussed.

All of the DFT calculations were performed using the PBE functional, (33) with the long-range dispersion correction included within Grimme’s scheme (DFT-D3), (34) as implemented in VASP codes. (35−38) A kinetic energy cutoff of 450 eV and the k-point Monkhorst–Pack grid of 8 × 8 × 8 were employed to optimize the lattice parameters of the PtZn bulk. The optimized parameters are a = b = 4.023 and c = 3.494 Å, in good agreement with the experimental values of a = b = 4.025 and c = 3.450 Å. (26) The main exposed surface of intermetallic Pt–Zn in experiments is PtZn (022̅), (26) which was thus adopted as the catalyst model in our simulations with the top two layers allowed to relax, while the bottom three layers fixed to mimic the bulk. A 3 × 4 supercell containing 60 Pt and 60 Zn atoms was adopted for the catalyst model, and the first Brillouin zone was modeled by a k-point mesh of at least 2 × 2 × 1 based on the testing calculations, as shown in Tables S1 and S2. The vacuum for the slab was set to at least 12 Å for all of the calculations. The spin-polarized calculations were performed and found to have a negligible effect on the energies. The structures were relaxed until the force on each ion was less than 0.03 eV/Å. The climbing nudged elastic band (39) method combined with the improved dimer method (40) was employed to search the transition states, which were further confirmed to possess only one imaginary frequency. All of the intermediates were computed to have all real frequencies. The adsorption energy (Eads) was computed as

where the Etot, Esurface, and Emolecule energies are for the molecule adsorbed surface, surface, and isolated molecule, respectively. The more negative value of the adsorption energy indicates stronger adsorption strength between the substrate and the surface. The adsorption energy for a pair of H atoms is defined with the H2 molecule as the reference energy. For the reaction profiles, the energy for each state was corrected by adding the Gibbs energy computed at 313 K by

where the ZPE, Uvib, and Svib energies represent the zero point energy, vibrational internal energy contribution, and the vibrational entropy, respectively. (41) The Bader charges (42) and the values for the integrated projected crystal orbital Hamilton population (IpCOHP) up to the Fermi level were computed to evaluate the bond strength. (43,44) For the electronic structure calculations, the 4 × 4 × 1 k-point mesh gives reliable IpCOHP values.

3.1. Hydrogen Adsorption Behavior on the Catalyst Model
It is well known that Pt is an excellent catalyst for dissociating the H2 molecule as well as other H sources, and most of the previous investigations ignore the influence of H coverage on the metal surfaces. Recent advances have shown that the H coverage has a great impact on the adsorption behavior of the reactants and intermediates formed during the reactions. (28) Herein, the adsorption behavior of H* was first evaluated on the PtZn (022̅) surface before building the H-covered catalyst model. Different from the Pt(111) surface that the Pt atop is the only site for H adsorption, there are several different adsorption sites on the PtZn(022̅) surface, and thus, it is necessary to understand the adsorption behavior of hydrogen. As shown in Figure 1, three different adsorption configurations were optimized for a pair of H*, that is, Hb for the bridge site between Pt and Zn atoms, HPt for the atop site of Pt, and HZn for the atop site of Zn, with adsorption energies of −0.92, −0.78, and −0.06 eV, respectively. The values indicate that the bridge sites between the Pt and Zn arrays are the ideal sites for the occupation of the dissociated H, with the bond lengths dPt-H and dZn-H of 1.67 and 1.86 Å, respectively. The Bader charge analyses show that the charges of Pt and Zn atoms at the top layer of pristine PtZn(022̅) are −0.54 and 0.49 |e|, respectively. Each H atom at the Hb site obtains 0.16 electrons from the surface and thus is negatively charged (H–). As a comparison, the H on the Pt(111) surface is positively charged with each H atom losing 0.03 electrons to the surface, and the adsorption energy of H2 is more negative of −1.18 eV on Pt(111). The different charge states of the adsorbed H on Pt(111) and PtZn(022̅) should mainly be due to the fact that the existence of Zn significantly alters the population of the electron density on the metal surface. The relatively weaker adsorption affinity for H– on PtZn may facilitate the hydrogenation reactions, of which the phenomenon has been reported on the surface of CeO2 with oxygen vacancies that the H– at the Ce site is more active. (45,46)

The Pt, Zn, and H atoms are represented by blue, gray, and white balls, respectively. The isosurface value is 0.005 e/Å3 for the charge density difference plot, where the yellow and red colors represent the electron accumulation and depletion, respectively.
To build a reasonable model for the H-covered PtZn(022̅) surface, the differential H adsorption free energy proposed by Nørskov et al. was calculated, (47) and the details are given in Supporting Information. As shown in Figure 1d, we have calculated the values as a function of the H coverage on the PtZn(022̅) surface. Both PBE and PBE-D3 were used to evaluate the evolution of the differential H adsorption free energies on the PtZn(022̅) surface, while the revised PBE (RPBE) functional was used by Nørskov et al. The PBE based results are systematically more positive than the PBE-D3 based results by about 0.1 eV, and the evolution trend of the free energy as a function of the H coverage is similar. At low coverage, the free energy for H is negative, lower than −0.2 (−0.1) eV with the PBE-D3 (PBE) functional, indicating that the H tends to adsorb on the surface. As the coverage increases up to one monolayer, the ΔGH* value becomes more positive gradually. When the coverage is over one monolayer, an abrupt increase of the differential free energy occurs, leading to a value of zero and 0.1 eV for ΔGH* obtained by PBE-D3 and PBE functionals, respectively. Overall, the results based on the two functionals suggest that it is thermodynamically unfavorable for additional H adsorption on the surface with one monolayer of H because the differential H adsorption free energy becomes positive. Therefore, it is reasonable to adopt the 1 monolayer H (12 H atoms)-covered surface as the catalytic model in this study.
The diffusion pathways for H atoms on the surface were also investigated. There are two typical diffusion pathways for H atoms, the path a (Figure 1a) is from one Pt site to the neighboring Pt site with a small diffusion barrier of only 0.11 eV (Figure 1e) and the path b is Pt → Zn → Pt with a much larger diffusion barrier of 1.15 eV. The higher barrier for path b is not surprising because the adsorption strength for H at the Zn site is much weaker. The low energy barrier for H diffusion between Pt sites suggests that the dissociated H atoms can easily diffuse on the metal surface at the mild condition and reacts with the adsorbed species including various intermediates and the generated −OH groups during the reactions. The −OH group is formed during the hydrogenation of the −NO2 group via the cleavage of O–N bonds, and then, the −OH group reacts with the H* at the surface forming H2O molecules. As shown in Figure S1, the OH group occupies the bridge site between Pt and Zn atoms, and the H* attacks the −OH group with a small energy barrier of 0.56 eV. The activation energy is also much smaller than the reported value of 0.93 eV on the Ni(111) surface, (18) suggesting that the formation of H2O is much easier on the PtZn(022̅) surface.
3.2. First Reaction Step of Hydrogenation on the Bare Surface
The possible stable adsorption configurations of the 4-NPA molecule on the bare surface of PtZn(022̅) were first investigated to understand its adsorption behavior. As shown in Figure 2a, each layer in the model consists of two different arrays, that is, Pt and Zn arrays, and the different layers have an AB stacking pattern. Two similar stable adsorption structures A1 and A2 were obtained for 4-NPA on the surface with nitro group bonds to two Zn sites but with different orientations along the x-axis, and thus, these two structures are different due to the asymmetry of the surface. Both of the two structures A1 and A2 have a parallel adsorption pattern with the linear 4-NPA molecule along with the x-axis, where all of the functional groups interact with the surface. For structure A1, the −NO2 group bonds to the Zn sites with bond lengths of 2.09 and 2.06 Å, and the N–O bond lengths increased by 0.07 and 0.08 Å compared to those in the isolated 4-NPA molecule. The −C≡C group bonds to the metal surface with C–Zn and C–Pt bond lengths of 2.66 and 2.10 Å, respectively, and the −C≡C bond length increases by 0.04 Å due to its adsorption. Besides, four carbon atoms (C2, C3, C5, and C6; see Figure 2 for labels) from the benzene ring bond to two Pt atoms with bond lengths from 2.20 to 2.78 Å. Similarly, for structure A2, all of the functional groups of the 4-NPA molecule also bond to the metal surface. The multiple bonds between the 4-NPA molecule and the metal surface indicate that there is a strong interaction between them. Indeed, the computed adsorption energies of 4-NPA in structures A1 and A2 are very close to each other, with values of −2.60 and −2.64 eV, respectively. The Bader charge analyses show that there are 0.83 and 0.81 electrons transferred from the surface to the 4-NPA molecule, respectively, for structures A1 and A2. To further quantify the bond strength of C2–Pt in structures A1 and A2, the IpCOHP values were computed to be −2.69 and −2.37, respectively, much larger than the value of −0.62 for the hydrogen-covered catalyst model, further confirming the strong interaction between the benzene ring and the surface. Note that the structure A2 is the same as the model used by Han et al. (26) Besides the two parallel adsorbed patterns, two vertical adsorption structures (Figure S2) were also obtained via the −NO2 group bonding to the Pt–Zn (an adsorption energy of −1.06 eV) and Zn–Zn (an adsorption energy of −0.79 eV) sites, respectively, and the other model with −C≡C bonding to two Pt atoms has an adsorption energy of −2.33 eV. The much stronger adsorption energies for structures A1 and A2 suggest that they are the main adsorption models on the PtZn(022̅) surface. Note that the adsorption of 4-NPA on the monometallic Pt(111) surface is much stronger, indicating that the positive Zn species in intermetallic PtZn dramatically weakens the adsorption of 4-NPA (Figure S4).

Starting from the two structures A1 and A2, the first hydrogenation steps were both calculated and compared. For each case, the important intermediates were calculated as shown in Figure 2b, and the most favorable hydrogenation reaction pathways for the nitro group and alkynyl group were compared, as shown in Figure 2c. For structure A1, the energy barrier is 0.59 eV for the first hydrogenation step of the nitro group, smaller than the value of 0.75 eV for the first hydrogenation step of the alkynyl group. By contrast, for structure A2, the first reaction barrier of 0.67 eV for the nitro group is larger than that of 0.49 eV for the alkynyl group, of which the relative energy barrier is inverse to that based on structure A1. This comparison suggests that the relative energy barriers for the nitro and alkynyl groups are changed based on the two different configurations with very similar adsorption energies for the 4-NPA molecule. Additionally, complete reaction pathways should be established in order to determine the hydrogenation selectivity of the 4-NPA. However, only one adsorption structure (structure A2) was adopted in the previous report, and the complete reaction pathways are missing, (26) and thus, further investigations are needed to unravel the reaction mechanism for the high selectivity of 4-NPA using the PtZn intermetallic compound in experiments.
3.3. Stabilities and Adsorption Behaviors on the 12H–PtZn(022̅) Surface
It is well known that the H2 molecule can be easily dissociated into H* on the noble metal surfaces, and thus, the surfaces should be covered with a certain amount of H* under the experimental conditions. Wang et al. reported that the hydrogen coverage induces conformational effects on the activity and selectivity of furfural on Pd(111). (28) In this regard, the effect of the H coverage on the reaction mechanism was evaluated in the present study. The adsorption energies of various adsorption modes of the 4-NPA molecule on the 12H–PtZn(022̅) surface were first calculated and compared to those based on the bare surface. As shown in Figure 3, a parallel adsorption mode with a linear 4-NPA molecule along the y-axis was found to be the most stable configuration and labeled as structure B. It is necessary to note that the orientation of the 4-NPA molecule in structure B is different from that in structures A1 or A2, where the linear 4-NPA molecule is located on the surface along the x-axis. As shown in Figure 3a, the 4-NPA molecule in structure B lies between two neighboring arrays of hydrogen atoms, where the repulsive interaction between the 4-NPA and the H-precovered metal surface is minimized. In contrast, when the 4-NPA is placed along the x-axis of the H-precovered surface (similar to structure A1 or A2), the repulsive interaction between the 4-NPA and the surface would be much larger due to the steric hindrance between the precovered H atoms and the 4-NPA. For structure B, due to the precovered H atoms on the surface, the benzene ring does not bond to the metal atoms on the surface, which is different from the case of the bare surface. The nitro group bonds to Zn and Pt sites with bond lengths of 2.07 and 2.42 Å for O2–Zn and O1–Pt bonds, respectively. The alkynyl group bonds to Zn and Pt sites with corresponding bond distances of 2.55 and 2.18 Å, accompanied with an increased bond length of 0.03 Å for the −C≡C bond. An adsorption energy of −1.99 eV for structure B is more positive than the value of −2.64 eV of structure A1 (bare surface), in line with less electrons of 0.53 |e| transferred from the surface to the 4-NPA molecule in structure B, of which the charge density difference plot is shown in Figure 3e. In addition, an IpCOHP value of 0.62 for C2–Pt in structure C is also much smaller than the value of 2.69 in structure A1, as a result of its much longer distance of 2.81 Å, which contributes to the weaker interaction between the adsorbate and the metal surface. Besides the structure B, three different structures (C, D, and E) with the 4-NPA molecule vertical to the surface were obtained. In structure C, the 4-NPA molecule adsorbs on the surface with −C≡C bonding to the Pt–Pt sites, and the adsorption energy is −1.86 eV. For the other two structures D and E, the nitro group of 4-NPA bonds to the Zn–Zn and Zn–Pt sites, respectively, with adsorption energies of −1.01 and −0.86 eV. Therefore, the structure B with 4-NPA parallelly adsorbed on the surface of 12H–PtZn(022̅) is energetically most stable.

Several different adsorption configurations of 4-NPA on the surface of the 12H–PtZn(022̅) catalyst model, (a) structure B parallel to the surface, (b) structure C vertical to the surface with −C≡C bonding to Pt sites, (c) structure D vertical to the surface with the nitro group bonding to two Zn sites, and (d) structure E vertical to the surface with the nitro group bonding to Zn and Pt sites, as well as their charge density difference plots (e–h) with an isosurface value of 0.005 e/Å3. The unit for adsorption energy given in parenthesis is eV. The yellow and red colors represent electron accumulation and depletion, respectively.
To further understand the dynamic behavior of the catalyst models used in this study, AIMD simulations were performed using NVT ensemble at 313 K with a time step of 1 fs, and a total simulation time of 10 ps was carried out for each system. The 12H–PtZn(022̅) model was simulated first. The results show that the surface is quite stable, as reflected by the stable temperature and the total energy as a function of the simulation time. The trajectory for a selected pair of Pt–H atoms as shown in Figure 4a indicates that the bond distance between the adsorbed H atom and the Pt atom is in the range of 1.50–1.85 Å, confirming that the H-covered catalyst model is stable at the experimental conditions. Furthermore, the same AIMD simulation was performed for the structure B. The trajectory analysis shows that the 4-NPA molecule moves only slightly around the adsorption site during the simulations. As depicted in Figure 4, the O2–Zn bond varies from 1.8 to 2.5 Å, while the O1–Pt bond varies in a wider range of 2.1–3.4 Å, suggesting that the breaking of the O1–Pt bond occurs several times (e.g., 1.2, 3.1, and 7.0 ps) during the 10 ps simulations. The three snapshots as shown in Figure 4b–d during the simulations confirmed that the 4-NPA molecule is overall stable on the surface during the simulation time (e.g., t = 0.2 and 10.0 ps), while the breaking of the O1–Pt bond occurs with a distance up to 3.43 Å at t = 1.2 ps, as shown in Figure 4c. These observations agree well with the relatively weaker bond strength of the O1–Pt bond as reflected by its IpCOHP values, which will be discussed in the next section. Overall, the abovementioned results indicate that structure B is a reasonable catalyst model, which was used as the starting configuration for hydrogenation.

3.4. Reaction Pathways for Hydrogenation of 4-NPA on the 12H–PtZn(022̅) Surface
The important intermediates during the hydrogenation reactions on the 12H–PtZn(022̅) surface are shown in Figure 5, the elementary reaction steps are shown in Table 1, and the energy profiles are shown in Figure 6. Considering the two O atoms, labeled as O1 and O2 from the nitro group, bond to the Pt and Zn atoms, respectively, H attacking the two different O atoms gives rise to two different reaction pathways. The calculations show that the H attacking the O1 is much more favorable, with an energy barrier (TS1-2) and reaction energy of 0.36 and 0.13 eV, respectively, giving rise to the formation of CH≡C-Ph-NOOH (IM2). In contrast, the attacking of H at the O2 site leads to the cleavage of N–O2(Zn) with a much higher energy barrier of 1.06 eV (Figure S3) and is thus kinetically unfavorable. The origin for the cleavage of the N–O2(Zn) is probably due to the strong adsorption strength (large IpCOHP value) between O2 and Zn, which will be discussed later, thus rendering its breaking. The hydrogenation of IM2 is diverged into two main competing reaction pathways, that is, steps 2–3 and 2–4, corresponding to the formation of CH≡C-Ph-NO (IM3) and CH≡C-Ph-N(OH)2 (IM4). For the elementary reaction steps, as shown in Figure 6, an energy barrier (reaction energy) of 0.77 (−1.34) eV for the steps 2–3 is higher than that of 0.56 (0.19) eV for the steps 2–4, suggesting that it is kinetically more favorable for the formation of the −N(OH)2 group, which was also considered as an important intermediate using other catalysts. (18) The further hydrogenation following the IM4 is the cleavage of the −N(OH)2 group into −NOH and −OH groups accompanied with an energy barrier of 0.70 eV, giving rise to the formation of IM5 (CH≡C-Ph-NOH). However, the pathway including the formation of IM3 (CH≡C-Ph-NO) is more favorable when the overall barrier is evaluated because the IM3 is thermodynamically much more favorable than the intermediate of IM4 by 1.53 eV. As shown in Figure 6, the competing pathway of IS → IM2 → IM4 → IM5 has an overall barrier of 1.02 eV, higher than that of 0.90 eV for the main reaction pathway of IS → IM2 → IM3 → IM6, of which the value of 0.90 eV is also the overall barrier for the whole hydrogenation reaction of the 4-NPA.

For the main reaction pathway, the hydrogenation of the −NO group (IM3) to the −NHO group (IM6) has to overcome a barrier of 0.55 eV, followed by its hydrogenation into the −NHOH group (IM7) with a large barrier of 0.74 eV. Next, the dissociation of the −NHOH group leads to the formation of the CH≡C-Ph-NH intermediate (IM9) with a low barrier of 0.26 eV, of which the process is exothermic by 1.35 eV. Then, CH≡C-Ph-NH2 is obtained by the final hydrogenation reaction to IM9 via steps 9–10, with a large barrier of 0.76 eV. The dissociation for the chemically adsorbed 4-APA (FS) into physically adsorbed 4-APA (FS-g) is an endothermic process with a value of 0.51 eV and thus should proceed under the reaction conditions in experiments. The recovery of the 12H–PtZn(022̅) surface (a relative energy of −6.65 eV) is an exothermic process, as shown in Figure 6. Overall, among all of the elementary reaction steps in the main reaction pathway, the reaction steps 2–3, 6–7, and 9–10 are accompanied with relatively higher energy barriers of 0.77, 0.74, and 0.76 eV, respectively. The main reaction pathway is the sequential hydrogenation of the nitro group in 4-NPA; CH≡C-Ph-NO2 → CH≡C-Ph-NOOH → CH≡C-Ph-NO → CH≡C-Ph-NHO → CH≡C-Ph-NHOH → CH≡C-Ph-NH → CH≡C-Ph-NH2. This process is different from the hydrogenation of the nitrobenzene on Pt(111) and Ni(111), where the Ph-N(OH)2 and PH-N intermediates are formed during the reactions, respectively. (18) Note that the overall energy barrier of 0.90 eV along the main reaction pathway is relatively higher than the value of 0.75 eV on Pt(111) by 0.15 eV. (23)
The hydrogenation of the alkynyl groups for several intermediates during the main reaction pathway was also evaluated. As shown in Figure 7, the first hydrogenation step for each of the intermediate CH≡C-Ph-NO2, CH≡C-Ph-NOOH, CH≡C-Ph-NO, CH≡C-Ph-NHO, CH≡C-Ph-NHOH, CH≡C-Ph-NH, and CH≡C-Ph-NH2 was computed, and the results show that the energy barriers are in the range of 1.18–1.53 eV, all of which are much higher than the overall barrier of 0.90 eV as discussed above by 0.28–0.63 eV. Therefore, it is kinetically unfavorable for the hydrogenation of the alkynyl groups from the intermediates along the main reaction pathways.

3.5. Origin of the Chemoselective Hydrogenation
As discussed above, upon the consideration of the hydrogen coverage on bare PtZn(022̅), a decreased reaction barrier for the first hydrogenation step of the nitro group and an increased reaction barrier for the first hydrogenation step of the −C≡C group were found on the 12H–PtZn(022̅) surface. To gain insights into these changes, the projected COHP (pCOHP) analysis was performed to characterize the bonding strength, where the interaction between two neighboring atoms is quantitatively described by IpCOHP values, as shown in Figure 8. For the bare PtZn(022̅), the IpCOHP values of the two bonds of O1–Zn and O2–Zn are −3.83 and −3.63 in structure A1, and the values are −3.75 and −3.38 for structure A2, respectively. In contrast, in structure B, a similar IpCOHP value of −3.78 was obtained for the O2–Zn bond, while a much smaller IpCOHP value of −2.71 was found for the O1–Pt bond, indicating relatively weaker bond strength for the O1–Pt bond and thus is easier to be hydrogenated. This difference originates from the different adsorption structures of the 4-NPA molecule on different catalyst models. For the bare PtZn(022̅) surface, a pair of positively charged Znδ+ sites strongly bind the two Oδ− atoms of the nitro group in both structures A1 and A2. In contrast, the nitro group binds to a pair of Znδ+ and Ptδ− sites in the 12H–PtZn(022̅) (structure B) with weaker adsorption strength, leading to the lower energy barrier for the first hydrogenation step. On the other hand, a −C≡C bond distance of 1.279 Å in structure B is shorter than those of 1.291 and 1.294 Å in structures A1 and A2, in line with the stronger bond strength as reflected by the larger IpCOHP value of −15.34 for −C≡C in structure B and relatively smaller IpCOHP values of −15.11 and −15.12 for −C≡C in structures A1 and A2 accordingly. Therefore, a higher energy barrier was required for the activation of −C≡C in H pre-adsorbed model. In conclusion, the H coverage changes the adsorption structure of 4-NPA molecule, giving rise to a weaker O1–Pt bond and a stronger −C≡C bond, such that an obviously enhanced selectivity was achieved.

The density of states for several intermediates was computed, and the results indicate that the major difference should arise from the nitro group. Therefore, the pCOHP curves for IS and IM2 states were calculated and plotted, as shown in Figure S7. For both IS and IM2 states, the energy levels of antibonding states for the N–O1 bond shift to lower energies compared to that in the 4-NPA molecule, leading to more antibonding states below the Fermi level, which should decrease the stability of the nitro group. In contrast, no antibonding state was below the Fermi level for the C≡C group in IS and IM2 states, suggesting that the stability of the C≡C bond is less affected. The dramatic change of the energy levels corresponding to the nitro group should be responsible for its relatively lower energy barriers for hydrogenation than those of the C≡C bond in various intermediates as discussed in the last section.
4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
The selective hydrogenation mechanism of 4-NPA was investigated and compared for the two different models, that is, the bare PtZn(022̅) surface and the H-covered surface 12H–PtZn(022̅). The computational results show that the 12H–PtZn(022̅) is a more reasonable model for modeling the reaction mechanism of the chemoselective hydrogenation for the 4-NPA molecule, with which the computational results well explain the experiments. The pre-adsorbed hydrogen atoms tend to occupy the bridge sites between Pt and Zn atoms, thus rendering the adsorption of 4-NPA at a pair of Pt and Zn sites rather than two Zn sites, giving rise to relatively weak adsorption energy compared to that on the bare surface. The DFT results show that the 4-NPA molecule is parallelly adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst and slightly distorted because both the nitro group and the alkynyl group bond to the exposed Pt and Zn sites while not to the benzene ring due to the steric hindrance between the benzene ring and the pre-adsorbed H atoms on the surface. The complete reaction pathways reveal that the overall energy barrier for the hydrogenation of the nitro group is 0.90 eV, much smaller than the energy barriers of 1.18–1.53 eV for the side pathways activating the alkynyl group for the intermediates. The results presented in this study strongly support that a reasonable H-covered metal surface should be considered in order to unravel the reaction mechanism for hydrogenation reactions of various nitroaromatics on noble metal and non-noble metal surfaces, which should be a general phenomenon.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
