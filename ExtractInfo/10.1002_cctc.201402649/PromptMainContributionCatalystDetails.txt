Real-Time Quantitative Operando Raman Spectroscopy of a CrOx/Al2O3 Propane Dehydrogenation Catalyst in a Pilot-Scale Reactor
Graphical Abstract
How to spy on your pilot: A combined operando UV/vis–Raman spectroscopy approach has been developed to monitor in a quantitative manner coke deposits at the top and bottom of a pilot-scale reactor filled with CrOx/Al2O3 extrudates during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane.
Abstract
Combined operando UV/vis–Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the deactivation of CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst extrudates in a pilot scale propane dehydrogenation reactor. For this purpose, UV/vis and Raman optical fiber probes have been designed, constructed and tested. The light absorption measured by operando UV/vis spectroscopy was used to correct for the effect of catalyst darkening. This makes operando Raman spectroscopy a quantitative technique to follow the formation of coke deposits on-line during the first hour of catalytic propane dehydrogenation process. The probe was used to study the coke deposition at the top and bottom of the reactor. Differences in the rate of coke deposition were observed, which were related to the local temperature of the catalyst bed. The chemical nature of the coke deposits formed on a catalyst extrudate, as expressed by the D1/G ratio, was independent of reaction time as well as of the position of the catalyst extrudate within the reactor bed.
Introduction
The increasing importance of shale gas production as a source of energy has initiated significant changes in the petrochemical industry.1 In addition to methane, significant amounts of light paraffins are obtained from these deposits, which has resulted in a steep drop in the prices of these compounds. As oil prices remain high, naphtha crackers are, therefore, being converted to ethane crackers in the USA for the production of ethylene. As the former installations produce significant amounts of propylene, and the latter do not, this has resulted in a shortage of propylene and consequent increased prices. At these market conditions, the production of propylene by the dehydrogenation of propane has become commercially very attractive, which is highlighted by the announcement of dozens of new installations.
Two processes have been applied industrially for the dehydrogenation of propane, namely the Catofin and Oleflex processes.2 The former uses a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst in a fixed bed reactor. Catalyst deactivation is a clear issue for this system and takes place first and foremost by coke deposition. Carbon deposits on the catalyst are necessary on one hand, as the heat generated during the regeneration step is used to run the endothermic reaction. On the other hand, the catalyst performance drops as active sites become covered by coke. Secondly, excessive heat generation during the regeneration step may result in incorporation of the active Cr-species into the bulk of the material for the chromium catalyst, which irreversibly deactivates the catalyst material. Therefore, it is important to carefully control the dehydrogenation–regeneration cycling operation.
Operando Raman spectroscopy has been used to study the formation of coke deposits on catalyst materials, and has proven to be a non-invasive method to investigate the chemical nature of carbon deposits formed on catalyst materials at reaction conditions.3 In principle it is a quantitative technique, as the intensity of the scattered Raman light is directly proportional to the amount of scattering molecules. However, depending on the degree of coloration of the catalyst solid, part of the scattered Raman light will be absorbed. This means that as the catalyst material deactivates by coke deposition, the self-absorption of the Raman signal becomes more prevalent as the catalytic solid becomes increasingly black. This results in an overall decrease of the Raman intensity collected, making quantitative use of the technique difficult, if not impossible.4
Fortunately, as was shown by Tinnemans et al., changes in the value of the diffuse reflectance (R∞) of a catalytic solid can be directly used to correct for the self-absorption of the Raman signal.5 Operando diffuse reflectance UV/vis spectroscopy is the tool of choice to obtain the value of R∞ at reaction conditions. Indeed, the relationship between diffuse reflectance and the observed Raman intensity can be described by Equation (1):
(1)
For which Ψ∞ is the observed Raman intensity for a powdered sample of infinite thickness, ρ the coefficient of Raman generation, I0 the intensity of the incident laser light and s the scattering coefficient. For the above equation to remain valid, the scattering coefficient has to remain constant during the experiment. Furthermore, as this formula is derived from the Kubelka–Munk equation, the correlation between absorption and the concentration of light absorbing species breaks down at very high values for light absorption, which means at very low values of R∞.6
By using this approach, Tinnemans et al. have studied the deactivation of a CrOx-based dehydrogenation catalyst in a lab-scale reactor during the dehydrogenation of propane by simultaneously collecting operando Raman spectroscopic data and the diffuse reflectance R∞ by UV/vis spectroscopy. In this way, the process of coke formation was studied in a quantitative manner. This approach was taken one step further by Bennici et al., who developed an expert catalytic reactor control system for a lab-scale reactor, where the dehydrogenation-regeneration cycling was completely controlled by on-line operando spectroscopic methods.7 More specifically, the regeneration process was started when a specific amount of coke was measured, and halted again when the coke was combusted.
Inspired by these promising results, we have opted to up-scale this operando approach to the level of a pilot-scale reactor, in which holes were introduced for inserting spectroscopic optical fiber probes. Recently, we have described the use of operando UV/vis probes to study the deactivation of mm-sized CrOx/Al2O3 extrudates during the dehydrogenation of propane in a pilot-scale reactor.8 By collecting operando UV/vis spectra, differences in the rate of coke deposition and combustion were observed as a function of catalyst bed height. Here, we further this analysis by showing the design, construction and testing of an optical fiber probe for conducting operando Raman spectroscopy in a pilot-scale reactor.
The Raman and UV/vis probes were used to examine the formation of coke deposits on the catalyst material during two consecutive propane dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. Two identical experiments were performed, where the R∞ obtained by operando UV/vis spectroscopy in one experiment was used to correct the operando Raman spectra obtained in a second experiment for the effect of self-absorption. In this way, quantitative information about the process of coke deposition was obtained at the top and bottom of the catalyst bed.
Results and Discussion
For the operando UV/vis probe, six optical fibers guide photons from the light source to the catalyst sample, where the diffusely reflected light is guided back to an UV/vis spectroscope. The optical fibers are encapsulated in a ceramic tube, which is inserted in a metallic casing that is fixed to the reactor. To prevent fouling of the probe tip, nitrogen is passed through the UV/vis probe. Details of this probe can be found in a recent publication.8 The UV/vis probes proved to be an excellent tool to study the deposition of coke on catalyst extrudates, and the flow of nitrogen along the length of the probe did not interfere with this darkening process.
In contrast, the design of the operando Raman probe is considerably more sophisticated. As photons come in contact with the catalyst sample under study, they can be scattered either elastically (Raleigh scattering) or inelastically (Raman scattering). Since the inelastic scattering of photons is a relatively rare process, a high flux of photons is required to generate a strong enough Raman signal. For this reason, the operando Raman probe has to be constructed in such a way that it can focus a bundle of laser light on the sample and collect the backscattered Raman signal. In addition, a series of lenses, filters and mirrors are present inside the probe to isolate the Raman signal.
In Figure 1, a schematic display and a photograph are shown of the newly designed Raman probe. Laser light (λ=532 nm) enters the Raman probe through an optical fiber and is converted into a parallel beam by a lens, after which it passes through a band-pass filter that only transmits light of λ=532 nm. In this way, the Raman signal of the SiO vibrations of the fiber is filtered out. The light then travels along the length of the probe through a dichroic window to a lens fixed at the tip of the probe, which focuses the laser light on the catalyst sample. Backscattered light is collected and converted to a parallel beam by the same lens. From this direction, the dichroic filter functions as a mirror, and through another mirror the light passes through a long-pass filter assembly, which only allows Stokes shifted light through. A third lens then focusses the Raman signal on an optical fiber, which is connected to the spectrometer. The probe is inserted in a metal casing, which is fixed to the reactor. A Teflon ferrule is used for the connection between the probe and the metal casing, so the position of the probe relative to the casing, and, therefore, the catalyst bed, can be adjusted. This allows for the focusing of the probe on the catalyst sample.

The green arrows show the pathway of the laser light, while the red arrows show the pathway of the collected Raman signal through the probe.9
As fouling of both the operando UV/vis and Raman probe may be an issue, a small flow of N2 is passed over the length of the probe into the reactor. This will prevent propylene and other reactants from entering the probe. For the Raman probe, an additional sapphire window is placed at the tip of the probe to prevent fouling. Small holes have been drilled in the edge of this window, where the nitrogen can enter the reactor.
However, as the catalyst bed is heated, catalyst extrudates may change position owing to, for example, thermal expansion of the reactor. This can result in a loss of focus, which makes the collection of Raman spectra difficult if not impossible. To avoid this problem, a sample holder is used, in which a single catalyst extrudate is fixed. The sample holder is attached to the thermowell inside the reactor. A schematic, as well as pictures of this sample holder are shown in Figure S1 in the Supporting Information. The sample holder is designed in a way that minimal contact is made with the extrudate under study.
A detailed Scheme and photograph of the pilot-scale reactor are shown in Figure 2. The reactor is inserted in a three-staged oven consisting of six 500 W heating units. It is filled with 0.5 kg of CrOx/Al2O3 extrudates and 14 cm of inert stainless steel balls at its extremities. Three thermocouples are inserted in a thermowell, which measure the temperature of the catalyst bed. Two UV/vis optical fiber probes and one Raman optical fiber probe are inserted in the pilot-scale reactor, to study the catalyst bed at different heights. Several parts of the operando Raman probe, such as the Teflon O-ring and the optics inside the probe, cannot withstand the high temperatures of the dehydrogenation reaction. As the probe is mostly made out of stainless steel, which conducts heat very well, external cooling is required. For this reason, a jet of air is used to cool the probe at the point where it exits the reactor.

Detailed scheme and photograph of the pilot-scale reactor used to study the deactivation of CrOx/Al2O3 extrudates during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. Two operando UV/vis and a single Raman optical fiber probe were used to study the catalyst bed under true reaction conditions with on-line GC analysis. The most important parts of the set-up are indicated in the legend.
For the first propane dehydrogenation experiment, two cycles, which consist of 6 h of propane dehydrogenation followed by ≈4 h of regeneration were performed at 550 °C. During this experiment, the two operando UV/vis optical fiber probes were positioned in the upper two reactor opening slots and the operando Raman optical fiber probe was placed in the third opening slot at the bottom of the catalyst bed. In Figure 3, the obtained catalytic data are shown, as well as the temperature profiles measured by the three thermocouples located in the thermowell. Initially a conversion of propane of 49 % is achieved, which slowly drops over the course of the cycle to approximately 39 %. During the same period, the selectivity towards propylene increases from 76 to 89 %. Additionally, erratic behavior of the selectivity is observed, which can be explained by fluctuations in temperature of the catalyst bed. The heating system of the catalyst bed overcompensates for the loss of heat due to the endothermicity of the dehydrogenation reaction. As the temperature increases, side reactions, such as cracking and hydrogenolysis, become more prevalent, resulting in a drop in selectivity. An additional temperature effect is observed during the first minute of the dehydrogenation cycle, as the temperature of the catalyst bed quickly increases to 580 °C, after which it quickly drops again to 550 °C. This is likely caused by the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ by the hydrocarbons in the feed.

In the top two graphs, the selectivity (S, red) and conversion (X, black) are shown of the first (left) and second (right) propane dehydrogenation cycle for the first dehydrogenation experiment. In the bottom figure, the temperature profiles as measured by the three thermocouples at the top (black) middle (red) and bottom (blue) of the catalyst bed.
The operando Raman and UV/vis spectroscopic data collected during this experiment are shown in Figure 4. With the two operando UV/vis optical fiber probes installed, absorption bands corresponding with the d–d transitions of Cr3+, at λ=300, 450 and 620 nm, are observed at the start of the dehydrogenation step. Over the course of the propane dehydrogenation cycle, the absorption increases gradually, as the bands of the Cr3+ species become obfuscated by coke species. This darkening takes place rapidly during the first hour of the reaction, after which no changes in the spectra are observed because the catalyst has become completely black. This process of darkening starts with a 20 min delay at the top of the reactor, which is possibly related to the temperature of the catalyst bed, which has dropped below 550 °C during this period. In the operando Raman spectra collected at the bottom of the reactor bed during this experiment, two typical Raman bands corresponding with coke deposits are observed. The G band (1590 cm−1) corresponds with the ring vibration of a perfect graphitic lattice, while the D1 band (1320 cm−1) corresponds with ring vibrations of defects and edges of the graphitic lattice.10 The intensity of both Raman bands increase equally during the first 20 min, after which it drops again, most likely due to the increasing absorption of the Raman laser light by the (darkening) catalyst material.

In the top and middle graphs, the operando UV/vis spectra collected by the UV/vis optical fiber probes located at the top and middle of the reactor are shown. In the bottom graphs, the operando Raman spectra are shown collected at the bottom of the catalyst bed. In Figure S3, a few spectra that summarize the evolution of the UV/vis and Raman spectra are shown.
Operando Raman and UV/vis spectra were also collected during the subsequent regeneration step. As is shown in Figure 5, the catalyst darkening, as measured by UV/vis spectroscopy, as well as the typical coke bands in the Raman spectra disappear rapidly as the coke is combusted during the regeneration step. The time where the coke is combusted depends on the height of the catalyst bed. Indeed, the spectral features corresponding with coke deposits disappear after 80 min at the top, 120 min in the middle and 180 min at the bottom of the catalyst bed. In other words, coke combustion gradually travels as a front from the top to the bottom of the reactor bed.

Operando Raman and UV/vis spectra of a CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst obtained over time during the first (left) and second (right) regeneration step for the first dehydrogenation experiment. In the top and middle graphs, the operando UV/vis spectra collected by the UV/vis optical fiber probes located at the top and middle of the reactor are shown. In the bottom graphs, the operando Raman spectra are shown collected at the bottom of the catalyst bed. In Figure S3, a few spectra that summarize the evolution of the UV/vis and Raman spectra are shown.
In the second dehydrogenation-regeneration experiment the Raman probe is located at the top socket of the reactor bed, with the two UV/vis optical fiber probes being located at the middle and bottom sockets of the pilot-scale reactor. All the other experimental conditions are the same. The activity data, temperature profiles and operando Raman and UV/vis spectra collected during two dehydrogenation cycles are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S3 and S4).
As the trends observed during the two experiments are very similar we can use the darkening, as measured by operando UV/vis spectroscopy in the first propane dehydrogenation experiment, to correct the operando Raman spectra collected in the second propane dehydrogenation experiment and vice versa. In other words, as the operando Raman and UV/vis spectra are collected at both the top and the bottom, the combination of the two experiments provides quantitative information of the rate of coke deposition at both the top and bottom of the catalyst bed.
The first step of this analysis was to determine the average absorption between λ=566.5 and 586.6 nm in the operando UV/vis spectra, which is the energy of the Raman scattered photons (the laser light has a wavelength of 532 nm, which equals 18 800 cm−1; the Raman bands of coke are located between 1150 and 1750 cm−1, which is 17 650 and 17 050 cm−1, or 566.5 and 586.6 nm respectively). The average value of absorption in this region of the operando UV/vis spectra is determined and converted into diffuse reflectance, which is used to calculate G(R∞) using Equation (1). The average value for absorption is used, to minimize effects of noise in the spectra.
At the top of Figure 6, the values of G(R∞) for both cycles at the top and the bottom of the catalyst bed are shown. G(R∞) decreases during the first 30–40 min of the dehydrogenation reaction, to reach a stable value close to 0. This means that after 40 min, almost no light is reflected back from the catalyst sample and that additional darkening is not measured anymore. As additional coke deposition cannot be measured at this point, this amount of coke can only be determined quantitatively during this initial period. The resulting operando Raman spectra after applying the UV/vis correction are shown in the middle and bottom graphs of Figure 6. For the top probe (graphs to the left), the D1 and G Raman bands start to appear 20 min into the dehydrogenation reaction, which then rapidly increase, and continue to do so for the following 55 min. It is important to mention that this quantitative approach cannot be used to study the combustion of coke deposits, since the darkening cannot be determined accurately at the start of the dehydrogenation step. Furthermore, the combustion of coke is a relatively rapid process, taking place in a few minutes, during which only a few operando Raman spectra can be collected.

(middle) UV/vis corrected operando Raman spectra for the first hour of the first propane dehydrogenation cycle at the top and bottom of the catalyst bed; and (bottom) UV/vis corrected operando Raman spectra for the first hour of the second dehydrogenation cycle at the top and bottom of the catalyst bed.
The actual intensity of the Raman bands obtained during different experiments cannot be compared directly, as the probe will be positioned slightly differently with respect to the catalyst extrudate. This will result in differences in the quality of the spectra obtained, including the intensity of the Raman bands. However, the rate at which the intensity of the Raman bands increases can be compared. In Figure 7, the corrected intensity of the G Raman band measured at both locations of the catalyst bed during both cycles are shown as a function of time. As shown in the Figure, the rate of coke deposition is different for the top and bottom of the pilot-scale reactor. At the top, no coke is deposited during the first 20 min, after which the amount of coke rapidly increases; at the bottom of the reactor the intensity of the G Raman band increases almost linearly in time during the first 50 min. The temperature of the catalyst bed as measured by the thermocouples at the top and bottom of the catalyst bed are also shown. During the first 20 min-on-stream, the temperature of the catalyst bed is significantly lower at the top of the reactor bed compared to the bottom of the reactor bed. During this period, no coke deposition is observed by operando Raman spectroscopy at the top of the reactor. Between the 20th and 40th minute of the dehydrogenation cycle, however, the reverse is true, as the temperature at the top is higher. This means that coke deposition is very fast at the top, while it is a more gradual process at the bottom of the reactor bed. This clearly implies a connection between the rate of coke deposition, and the temperature of the catalyst bed.

Corrected intensity of the G Raman band (blue) and the reaction temperature (black) plotted vs. the reaction time for the first hour of both dehydrogenation cycles for the top and bottom of the catalyst bed.
The chemical nature of the coke deposits is expressed as the ratio of the intensity of the two Raman bands, the so-called D1/G ratio, and the results obtained are shown in Figure 8. To accurately determine the intensity of the Raman bands, the spectra have been deconvoluted in a set of four bands, as demonstrated by previous work.10 It is clear that the value of the D1/G varies a lot in the consecutively measured operando Raman spectra. Other than this noise, however, the ratio measured at the top and bottom of the reactor bed is not clearly different. Furthermore, no clear changes as a function of reaction time are observed. The average value of the D1/G ratio obtained is 0.84. Summarizing, this means that the chemical nature of the coke deposits formed on an industrial-like CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst extrudate during propane dehydrogenation is independent on its location in the catalyst bed, or the time it has been exposed to propane.

(right) D1/G ratios as a function of reaction time are shown for all operando Raman spectra collected, both at the top (black) and bottom (red) of the catalyst bed, for both the first (square) and second (circle) dehydrogenation cycle. This analysis has been performed on the uncorrected Raman spectra.10
Conclusions
The design, construction, and testing of an operando Raman probe is described, which could be inserted in a pilot-scale reactor to study the process of coke deposition on CrOx/Al2O3 extrudates during the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. The probe is made as such that a flow of N2 can be used to cool the probe and keep the tip clear of coke deposits. Furthermore, the probe can be moved with respect to the catalyst bed, for focusing purposes.
In addition to the Raman probe, two UV/vis probes were used to study the catalyst bed during two consecutive propane dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles. By performing an identical experiment while switching the position of the two types of optical fiber probes, the obtained information by the UV/vis and Raman spectroscopic probes can be combined to determine the type and amount of coke formed at different heights of the catalyst bed for the first hour of the dehydrogenation cycles. Differences in the rate of coke deposition were observed as a function of catalyst bed height, which are related to changes in the temperature of the catalyst bed. At higher reaction temperatures, the rate of coke deposition was increased, while the chemical nature of the coke deposits, as expressed by the D1/G ratio, is independent of catalyst bed height and reaction time. In addition, the combustion of the coke deposits could be visualized by the operando spectroscopic probes, and it took place as a reacting front, travelling down the length of the catalyst bed.
It should be clear that the developed pilot-scale reactor set-up, including the Raman and UV/vis operando spectroscopy probes, will be useful for studies on many other catalytic reactions, and, therefore, the approach has a much larger application field than the catalytic dehydrogenation system described in this work.
Experimental Section
The pilot-scale reactor was filled with approximately 500 g of CrOx/Al2O3 extrudates, with 14 cm of inert stainless steel balls (diameter of 6 mm) at the reactor’s extremities. The catalyst extrudates have a diameter of about 3 mm and a length of 3–8 mm. They consist of 20 wt % of Cr (which is a mixture of Cr3+ and Cr6+) and 1 wt % of Na on a Al2O3 support. The Raman optical fiber probe is connected to an Ava-Raman-532TEC spectrometer that is equipped with a 532 nm laser light source. Spectra are collected with 10 s acquisition time and 10 accumulations. The two UV/vis optical fiber probes are both connected to a deuterium-halogen light source and an Avaspec 2048 UV/vis spectroscope, and spectra are collected every 100 s, with an acquisition time of 50 ms and 100 accumulations. The dehydrogenation reaction is performed at approximately 550 °C at a pressure of approximately 1.5 bar. A flow of 5000 mL min−1, consisting of 10 vol % of propane in N2 (WHSV=0.1 h−1), is passed over the catalyst bed over a period of 6 h. The outlet of the reactor is connected with a GC equipped with a FID (Porabond-Q column) and a TCD (Carboxan column) detector for analyzing the composition of the resultant gas flow. After the dehydrogenation step, the coke formed on the catalyst is burnt off by flowing a mixture of O2 (140 mL min−1) and N2 (2200 mL min−1) at the same temperature. The regeneration is stopped when no more COx is detected by GC analysis. The reactor is then flushed with nitrogen and a second dehydrogenation cycle is started. The temperature of the top, middle and bottom of the catalyst bed is continuously monitored by three thermocouples inserted in a thermowell in the catalyst bed.
