Influence of the Au–Ti Active Site of the Titanosilicate MWW Zeolite on the Catalytic Activity of Ethane Dehydrogenation in the Presence of O2
Abstract
The titanosilicate zeolite with a MWW topology structure was synthesized by the atom-planting method through the dehydrochlorination of the hydroxyl group in the deboronated ERB-1 zeolite (D-ERB-1) and TiCl4, and Au was further loaded with the deposition precipitation method to apply for the ethane direct dehydrogenation (DH) and dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of O2 (O2-DH). It was found that Au nanoparticles (NPs) below 5 nm exhibited good activity for ethane direct dehydrogenation and O2-DH. The addition of titanium can not only anchor more Au but also make Au have a more dispersed homogeneous distribution. The ethane O2-DH catalytic performances of Au-loaded Ti-incorporated D-ERB-1 (Ti-D-ERB-1) were compared to those of Au-loaded ZnO-D-ERB-1 and pure silicate D-ERB-1. The results confirm that ethane O2-DH catalyzed by Au–Ti paired active sites is a tandem reaction of catalytic ethane DH and selective H2 combustion (SHC) of generated H2. According to the experimental results and calculated kinetic parameters, such as the activation energy of DH and SHC reaction heat of O2-DH, SHC catalyzed by the Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 catalyst containing the Au–Ti active site can not only break the ethane dehydrogenation thermodynamic equilibrium limitation to improve the ethylene yield but also suppress the CO2 and CO selectivity.

Ethylene is one of the basic raw materials for the production of many chemicals, such as styrene, polyethylene, and ethylene oxide. (1−7) Traditional commercial ethylene production has relied on steam cracking of petroleum naphtha, but the increased consumtion demand for ethylene calls for new ethylene production pathways. (8) The extraction of shale gas brings a great deal of methane, ethane, and other light alkane products, and the use of ethane dehydrogenation to replace the conventional ethylene production method is economically promising. (9−11) However, ethane direct dehydrogenation (DH) is an endothermic reaction. A considerable ethylene yield cannot be obtained at low temperatures, and there are many byproducts at high temperatures. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) with co-feeds of oxidants and alkanes has received much attention to increase the yield of ethylene while reducing the reaction temperature. (12) The catalytic activity for ODH of ethane with O2 (O2-ODH) by MoVTeNb oxide, NiOx, and VOx catalysts can be conducted at low temperatures, but the low selectivity toward ethylene with co-production of CO2 and operation safety is a common problem. (13) Ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 (CO2-ODH) can be considered as the tandem reaction of catalytic ethane direct dehydrogenation and reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) conversion of generated H2 with CO2. (14,15) The chemical loop oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane with O2 was performed with the sequential process of autothermal pyrolysis and catalytic dehydrogenation followed by selective H2 combustion (SHC) with O2 or active oxygen carrier. (16) The SHC process can break the thermodynamic limitation of alkane DH, and SHC as the exothermal reaction can compensate for the endothermal reaction of alkane DH, which also inhibits the formation of coke deposits with generated H2O. (17,18)
Au-based catalysts have received wide attention in many catalytic fields, such as their ability to catalyze the RWGS (19,20) and the reaction of H2 with O2 to form H2O2 in the epoxidation of propylene. (21−24) Recently, it has been found that Au-based catalysts are also active in catalyzing the dehydrogenation of ethane and propane. (20,25−27) The activity of these catalysts depends upon the Au loading amount, particle size, and strong interaction between Au and supports. (28) The Au/ZnO catalyst prepared by Tóth et al. (26) shows good activity in ethane CO2-ODH, and electronic transfer between n-type ZnO and Au can promote the activation of CO2. The Au/Ce0.9Y0.1 catalyst prepared by Xie et al. (29) can promote the RWGS reaction in ethane CO2-ODH to improve the ethane conversion. The multiple catalytic performances of Au catalysts can motivate more distinction to further extend ethane dehydrogenation with more tandem reactions to improve the Au-based catalyst activity and stability.
The Au/Ti-YNU-1 and Au/Ti-MCM-36 catalysts prepared with Au nanoparticles by Jin et al. (21) can catalyze the formation of H2O2 intermediates from H2 and O2 in the epoxidation reaction. Ti-YNU-1 and Ti-MCM-36 belong to MWW structure zeolites, which are synthesized from borosilicate zeolite ERB-1 with a MWW structure by changing the layer structure and the Ti species doped in zeolites. The formed TiO2 species can anchor Au and make gold uniformly dispersed, and the prepared catalysts have stable catalytic activity. ERB-1 was discovered by Millini et al. (30) in 1988 with a double-layer structure with a high specific surface area and 12-member ring (MR) half-cup cavity hydroxyl groups on its zeolite surface. (31) The acid treatment ERB-1 zeolites can exfoliate the MWW layer structure to expose more 12-MR half-cup cavity hydroxyl groups and deboronization to generate more hydroxyl nests. Meanwhile, the hydroxyl groups and nests in the ERB-1 MWW zeolite structure are more favorable to incorporate other elements, such as the Ti active site, to the zeolite through the atom-planting method with the reaction of dehydrochlorination. (32)
In this paper, the MWW structure zeolite precursor ERB-1 was hydrothermally synthesized, and then deboronated ERB-1 containing hydroxyl nests was obtained by acid treatment. Titanosilicate was prepared by the atom-planting method through the reaction of TiCl4 with the hydroxyl groups. Au nanoparticles (NPs) were further loaded on the carrier by the deposition precipitation (DP) method. The optimal loading and particle size of Au NPs in the ethane DH reaction were determined. Ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of O2 (O2-DH) for Au NPs supported on different supports was compared to investigate the different catalytic mechanisms of Au–Ti and Au–ZnO active sites. The product selectivity difference between ethane O2-DH with ethane thermal oxidation and DH was compared, and the corresponding ethane DH reaction activation energy and reaction heat were calculated through the iso-conversional kinetic method to discriminate the different reaction mechanisms.

Preparation of Catalysts
Synthesis of MWW Zeolites
The ERB-1 precursor [ERB-1(P)] was synthesized according to the synthetic method of Millini et al. (30) Usually, the hydrothermal synthesis method was used, with piperidine as the templating agent and meteorological nanosilica and boric acid as the silicon and boron sources, respectively, in the molar ratio of Si/B/piperidine/H2O = 1:2:1.4:19. ERB-1 was formed by ERB-1 precursors after calcination at 823 K for 5 h. Deboronated ERB-1 (D-ERB-1) was obtained by subjecting ERB-1 to acid treatment. (32) Typically, ERB-1 was mixed 1 g/50 mL with 8 M HNO3, condensed and refluxed at 373 K, and kept for 24 h. Then, D-ERB-1 was obtained by calcination at 823 K for 5 h after filtering and washing to neutral. Ti-D-ERB-1 was prepared by the atom-planting method with TiCl4 vapor as the titanium source, and the reaction of TiCl4 vapor with D-ERB-1 was performed in a vertical quartz tube reactor with N2 as the carrier gas at 773 K for 3 h. (32) ZnO-D-ERB-1 was prepared using the impregnation method. The detailed synthesis process is shown in the Supporting Information.
Synthesis of Nanoparticle Size Gold Samples
Gold was loaded in the zeolite by the deposition precipitation method. (21) Usually, the desired loading amount of HAuCl4·3H2O (99.99%, Alfa Aesar) solution was diluted in deionized water (solid–liquid ratio = 1 g/50 mL), and the solution pH value was adjusted with 0.1 M NaOH to pH 6 at 323 K for 3 h. Then, the Ti-D-ERB-1 support was added and with 0.1 M NaOH solution to adjust to pH 9. The suspension was then filtered, and the filter cake was washed with deionized water. The pH was measured using a pH meter until the last filtrate had pH 7, and the filter cake was dried at 323 K for 12 h. The samples were named y wt % Au/Ti-D-ERB-1, where y represents the theoretical value of the gold loading on this catalyst. y values of 0.3, 0.7, and 1 represent the concentration of Au3+ in solution in deposition precipitation corresponding to different loading amounts, respectively. Au/D-ERB-1 and Au/ZnO-D-ERB-1 were also prepared with a loading of 0.7 wt %.
The Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 samples with both Au loadings of 0.7 wt % but different Au particle sizes were prepared using 0.1 M NH3·H2O solution and the DP treatment time at 323 K with pH 6 for 3 h and further pH 9 for 7 and 12 h. The prepared samples were named Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 (NH3-7) and Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 (NH3-12), and the obtained samples were filtered and dried as the above samples. The 0.7 wt % Au-loaded Ti-D-ERB-1 with the small particles was prepared with NaOH solution and was named 0.7 wt % Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 (NaOH).
Catalyst Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the samples was performed on a D-MAX 2500/PC diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation working at 100 mA and 40 kV. Its scanning angle was 5–80°. Using the N2 adsorption–desorption method, the N2 adsorption isotherm was tested at 77 K using a Gemini VII 2390 autoanalyzer. The total specific surface area (SBET) was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method, and the total pore volume (Vtotal) was calculated at a relative N2 pressure of 0.99. The ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectra were measured on a Hitachi UH-4150 spectrometer using BaSO4 as a reference, equipped with a diffuse reflective sphere, and the measurement range of the instrument was 200–800 nm. The Raman data were tested using a HORIBA-EVA micro confocal Raman spectrometer with a spectral resolution of 2 cm–1. A He–Cd exciter with an exciter wavelength of 325 nm and an output power of 50 mW was used. Electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) in a JEOL JXA-8200 electron probe was used for elemental analysis. Elemental analysis of atoms was determined using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) in a Vario EL III CHNSO instrument. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization uses an electron beam on JEM-2100A and JEM2100F instruments.
Testing in situ infrared (IR) [diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT)] was performed in Nicolet 6700 and Harrick with a collection range of 3200–4000 cm–1, and samples were pretreated in an Ar atmosphere at 673 K for 2 h before testing. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was measured using a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB Xi+ spectrometer with non-monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-rays. An analyzer with an energy step of 0.05 eV, 118 eV, and an operating pressure of 10–9 mbar was used to record the spectra. The C 1s peak of 284.8 eV was combined with an energy reference.
Catalyst Activity Testing
Catalyst activity tests were performed on a fixed bed reactor using a quartz tube reactor, and each experiment was loaded with 0.4 g of uncalcined catalyst and placed in the constant temperature zone of the reactor while filled with quartz wool and quartz. Before the start of each experiment, the catalyst was purged with a mixture of 30 mL/min N2 and 10 mL/min H2 for 2 h at 923 K and atmospheric pressure, followed by a 30 min purge using 30 mL/min N2 alone. A final purge with a mixture of 30 mL/min N2 and 10 mL/min O2 for 2 h was used to activate the catalyst. Finally, the catalyst was purged with 30 mL/min N2 for 1 h to complete the pretreatment of the catalyst. After pretreatment, for ethane direct dehydrogenation, the gas was switched to a mixture with a volume flow ratio of C2H6/N2 = 2:5 and a total flow rate of 14 mL/min. For CO2-ODH, the reaction conditions were T = 923 K, C2H6/CO2 = 2:5, and total gas flow = 14 mL/min. For the RWGS reaction, the reaction conditions were T = 923 K, H2/CO2 = 2:5, and total gas flow = 14 mL/min. For O2-DH, the volume flow ratio of the gas mixture was C2H6/O2/N2 = 8:4:10 and a total flow rate of 22 mL/min. The temperatures were 923–973 K, and the pressures were all at atmospheric pressure. The used catalyst was calcined in air for 1 h at 923 K and then purged with N2 for 1 h, allowing the catalyst to be regenerated.
A gas chromatograph (GC Fuli 9790II) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD), equipped with a KB-PLOT Q 30 m capillary column and a TDX-01 packed column, respectively, was used for the online analysis of the products. The molar fraction of each component was calculated by the external standard method, and the mass fraction of each component was used in the calculation of the molar fraction. Finally, the mass fraction was used to calculate the selectivity and ethane conversion of the product. In DH and O2-DH, the corresponding equations for their calculations are as follows, where y is the molar fraction of the component and F is the molar flow of the material:

Calculation of Reaction Activation Energy and Heat
With the same reaction conditions, the product yield can be used to calculate the corresponding elementary step reaction rate for catalytic direct dehydrogenation. The activation energy of the reaction is calculated according to the iso-conversional method by taking the temperature interval from 923 to 973 K with product yields for several different catalysts.
Meanwhile, in the temperature range of 923–973 K, using the Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 catalyst, if the ethane O2-DH reaction can be considered as a sequential step of catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane and SHC of generated H2, the ethylene yield is higher than the equilibrium ethane yield of ethane dehydrogenation under the same reaction conditions. In the O2-DH reaction, the heat of the reaction for the formation of ethylene is calculated from the Van’t Hoff equation with the produced ethylene yield according to the reaction equilibrium constants. The activation energy of the side reaction of ethane oxidation to CO and further to CO2 with the irreversible reaction can also be calculated with the iso-conversional method

Characterization of Au-Based Catalysts
Confirmation the Structure of the MWW Zeolite and the State of Incorporated Ti and Au Species
The structures of the synthesized Au-based catalysts were characterized by XRD, as shown in Figure 1. All samples were calcined in air only before XRD characterization, and the characteristic peaks corresponding to the MWW structure at 7.1°, 7.9°, 25.1°, and 26.1° did not change significantly, indicating that the basic structure of MWW was retained in all samples. (32) Comparing ERB-1 and D-ERB-1, the peak shape of D-ERB-1 is basically the same but the peak intensity is slightly reduced, which indicates that the layered structure of D-ERB-1 is not destroyed after acid treatment. Ti-D-ERB-1, Au/Ti-D-ERB-1, and Au/ZnO-D-ERB-1 still retain the basic structure of MWW after loading TiO2 and ZnO on the surface of the zeolite. No diffraction peaks of TiO2 and ZnO were observed, indicating that they were well-dispersed. All samples retain their zeolite diffraction peaks after Au loading, and the diffraction peaks of metal Au (2θ = 38.2°) are unidentifiable, which is due to the good dispersion and low loading of the samples loaded by the deposition–precipitation method. The above results show that the basic structure of MWW is well-preserved after loading TiO2 and ZnO, and the loaded Au NPs are well-dispersed on the zeolite surface.

Figure S1 of the Supporting Information depicts the results of N2 adsorption isotherms, with SBET and Vtotal as shown in Table 1. The isotherms of ERB-1, D-ERB-1, and Ti-D-ERB-1 are typical type I isotherms, corresponding to the microporous structure. Meanwhile, the MWW structures of Ti-D-ERB-1 and ZnO-D-ERB-1 remained unchanged after doping Ti and Zn by atom-planting and impregnation methods, and SBET and Vtotal remained the same as those of D-ERB-1, indicating that the introduction of Ti and Zn did not change the microstructure of the catalyst, in agreement with the XRD results.

The results of the characterization of TiO2 and ZnO using ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy are shown in Figure 2. The UV–vis band at 210–220 nm is attributed to the charge transfer from O2– to Ti4+ in tetrahedral (Td) coordination, and the UV band at 260 nm is attributed to the charge transfer from O2– to Ti4+ in octahedral (Oh) coordination. As shown in Figure 2, all Ti-containing samples have a characteristic peak of Ti(IV) in the Td environment at 220 nm, almost no characteristic peak of Oh at 260–270 nm, and a very obvious characteristic peak of TiO2 at 350 nm. (21) For the Au/ZnO-D-ERB-1 sample, it has a weak peak at 265 and 375 nm, which corresponds to the presence of ZnO in the pore channel and large crystalline ZnO on the surface of the zeolite. (33) Au was immobilized on the carrier in the form of hydroxide or oxide, and all became Au NPs after calcination. The UV–vis absorption spectrum of Au has a distinct absorption band near 500–600 nm, (21) and the different peak heights at 500–600 nm represent the different sizes of Au NPs. Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 (NH3-12) exhibited the highest peak at 500–600 nm, representing the largest size of its Au NPs.

TiO2 and ZnO were further characterized using Raman spectroscopy, as shown in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information. Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 has characteristic peaks at 290, 402, and 631 cm–1, indicating the possible production of some TiO2. At the same time, Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 has a very distinct absorption peak at 480, 530, and 1107 cm–1, which is generally considered to be a stretching vibration of Ti(IV), (34,35) which is consistent with the UV–vis results that Ti was incorporated into the MWW structure with zeolite framework Ti and extraframework TiO2. Au/ZnO-D-ERB-1 has a peak at 311 and 507 cm–1, which represents the presence of ZnO species in the sample. (36)
The elemental contents of Ti, Zn, and Au were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), where the results are summarized in Table 1. The loaded Au particle size distribution results of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are represented in Figure 3 and Figure S3 of the Supporting Information. Ti species loaded using the atom-planting method had a loading of about 2.8 wt %, while Zn loaded using the impregnation method had a loading of 2.96 wt %. Meanwhile, the actual Au loading amount of Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 with different loading amounts is close to the theory calculated loading amount, and the loaded Au particle size of Au NPs is similar to the particle size of about 2–7 nm, as shown in panels A and B of Figure S3 of the Supporting Information. For catalysts with the same theoretical loading amount but different Au particle sizes, the actual loadings were similar but the particle sizes were in the order of Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 (NaOH) < Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 (NH3-7) < Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 (NH3-12), as shown in panels C and D of Figure S3 of the Supporting Information.

Figure 3. TEM spectra of (A) Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 (NaOH), (B) Au/D-ERB-1, and (C) Au/ZnO-D-ERB-1 fresh catalysts.
For the Au-based catalysts with different carriers, the theoretical loading amounts were all 0.7 wt % and the actual loading amounts of Au were D-ERB-1 < ZnO-D-ERB-1 < Ti-D-ERB-1. It can be seen from Figure 3 that the Au NPs of Au/D-ERB-1 have a larger particle size and the Au NPs of the samples of Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 and Au/ZnO-D-ERB-1 have a smaller particle size and are around 5 nm. TEM and EDS elemental mapping after the O2-DH reaction are shown in Figures S4 and S5 of the Supporting Information. In Figure S4 of the Supporting Information, the particle size of all catalysts increased to varying degrees after the reaction and the Au NPs of Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 (NaOH) only increased in size by about 1 nm and dispersed well (Figure S6 of the Supporting Information). This illustrates the good anchoring effect of Ti to Au. In addition, it can also be seen from EDS elemental mapping (Figure S5 of the Supporting Information) that Ti and Zn are well-dispersed on the zeolite.
Synthesis Mechanism for Incorporating Ti by the Atom-Planting Method and Anchoring Au Nanoparticles by the Deposition Precipitation Method
Figure 4 shows the in situ DRIFT spectra of the individual samples. In comparison of the samples of ERB-1 (Figure 4a) and D-ERB-1 (Figure 4b), D-ERB-1 shows a broad peak between 3420 and 3620 cm–1, which is attributed to the deboronization of borosilicate zeolite ERB-1 after acid treatment, resulting in plenty of hydroxyl nests. A sharp peak at 3700–3740 cm–1 is characteristic of silanols, and it is clear that D-ERB-1 has a high content of hydroxyl nests and silanols. (14,32) In comparison of D-ERB-1 to Ti-D-ERB-1, the two characteristic peaks of Ti-D-ERB-1 weakened after Ti loading. It is attributed to the reaction of TiCl4 with the hydroxyl nests, the removal of hydrogen chloride, and the successful doping of titanium atoms into the zeolite framework structure of D-ERB-1 by occupying the positions of hydroxyl nests and silicon hydroxyl groups. (32)

As mentioned earlier, Ti-D-ERB-1 can better anchor Au NPs. When Au is loaded using the DP method, the pH of the solution reaches below the isoelectric point (IEP) of the carrier, so that the carrier is positively charged. The HAuCl4 solution formed a large amount of Au[(OH)3Cl]− or Au(OH)4– with the addition of NaOH, which carried negative charges and attracted and bound together with the positively charged carriers. (24) Meanwhile, the IEP value of the silica carrier is about 2–3, and the high pH leads to more negative charges on the surface of the carrier, while TiO2 has an IEP of about 6–7, generating more positive charges on the surface of its carrier. In comparison to D-ERB-1 with a large amount of Si elements in the framework, Ti-D-ERB-1 containing TiO2 generates a positive charge and Au[(OH)3Cl]− or Au(OH)4– adsorbs more easily. (22,24) Therefore, the addition of Ti species is essential for the dispersion of Au particles. (23,24) In conclusion, the hydroxyl nests of D-ERB-1 can disperse uniformly on the surface of zeolites of TiO2 with the atom-planting method, which can stably homogeneously anchor Au NPs by the DP method.
Discrimination the Different Metal–Support Interactions between Au–Ti and Au–ZnO Active Sites
The surface binding behavior of Au on Ti-D-ERB-1 and ZnO-D-ERB-1 was analyzed by XPS, as shown in Figure 5. The Au 4f7/2 (Au 4f5/2) XPS peak is located at 83.7 (87.6) eV. For Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 and Au/D-ERB-1, the binding energy of Au 4f7/2 is 83.7 eV. (20) Meanwhile, for the Au/ZnO-D-ERB-1 sample, the XPS peak of Au 4f7/2 can be clearly seen at 84.1 eV for the Au/ZnO-D-ERB-1 sample, although the XPS peak of Au 4f5/2 is buried in the XPS peak of Zn 3p3/2. In comparison to Au/Ti-D-ERB-1, Au/ZnO-D-ERB-1 has a higher binding energy value relative to Au 4f7/2 of Au/D-ERB-1. At the same time, as shown in panels c and d of Figure 5, the binding energy of Zn 3p3/2 changes from 89.3 to 89.1 eV after Au loading. Zn 2p1/2 is similarly shifted, as shown in Figure S7 of the Supporting Information. In summary, Au 4f7/2 and Zn 3p3/2 of the Au/ZnO-D-ERB-1 sample are significantly shifted, and this change in binding energy is attributed to the strong metal–support interactions (SMSIs) between ZnO and Au. When Au and ZnO particles are attached together, electron transfer from Au particles, like ZnO, occurs at the Au–ZnO interface. (25) The XPS peak of ZnO shows a higher binding energy as a result of the influence of Au on ZnO. The binding energy of Au 4f7/2 of Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 does not change much, indicating that the interaction between Au and TiO2 is not obvious.

Direct Dehydrogenation of Ethane
Direct Dehydrogenation of Ethane of the Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 Catalyst with Different Au Loading Amounts
Panels A and B of Figure 6 show the catalytic activity of Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 with different loading amounts for the ethane DH reaction after 60 min of reaction. Under the same conditions, ethane conversion autothermal pyrolysis is only 0.8%, and the catalyst significantly improved the ethane conversion and retained the high ethylene selectivity. With the loading of Au from 0.3 to 0.7 to 1 wt % at 923 K, the conversion increased by about 10%. With the increase of active site Au NPs, the ethane dehydrogenation also increases, which represents the superior C–H bond activation ability of the catalyst, and there was a significant increase in conversion when the Au loading was increased from 0.3 to 0.7 wt %, but the increase in conversion was not significant when the loading was increased again to 1 wt %. Therefore, 0.7 wt % is the optimal loading amount of Au. From this result, it is clear that Au is an active site for ethane dehydrogenation.

Direct Dehydrogenation of Ethane of Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 with Different Loaded Au Nanoparticle Sizes
It is well-known that the size of Au NPs is a key factor affecting the catalytic performance in many reactions. Meanwhile, many scholars have prepared 0–6 nm Au NPs catalysts with good catalytic activity in ethane DH and CO2-ODH reactions. (25−28) Thus, the activity of ethane direct dehydrogenation was also tested in the same conditions for Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 samples with similar Au loading amounts and different Au particle sizes, and average activity results during the first reaction for 60 min for all catalysts are shown in panels C and D of Figure 6. All samples exhibited high ethylene selectivity at 923–973 K, accompanied by a small amount of methane production. As seen from panels C and D of Figure 6 and Table S1 of the Supporting Information, at 973 K, the activity sequence of ethane conversions for different catalysts is shown: Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 (NaOH) > Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 (NH3-7) > Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 (NH3-12). Meanwhile, the particle sizes of Au NPs were from small to large: Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 (NaOH) < Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 (NH3-7) < Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 (NH3-12). It can be seen that, for Au-based catalysts, the size of Au NPs has an important effect on the activity of the catalyst, with smaller particles resulting in higher ethane conversion. In summary, the loading of Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 catalysts and the size of Au NPs have significant effects on the activity of direct dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene.
The regenerated 0.7 wt % Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 catalyst performance results are shown in Figure S8 of the Supporting Information. It is obvious that the activity of the catalyst refreshed significantly after regeneration, suggesting that carbonaceous deposition on the catalyst may have contributed to the reduced catalyst activity, which can be regenerated.
Comparison the Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 Catalytic Performance of Ethane Dehydrogenation in the Absence or Presence of O2
The sample with the smallest Au nanoparticles, Au/Ti-D-ERB-1, was tested for the activity of O2-DH in the same reactor, and the result after the reaction is stabilized as shown in Figure 7. In ethane DH, the dehydrogenation products are ethylene and methane, but in O2-DH, CO and CO2 were also detected. Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 showed good activity in O2-DH, with a significant increase in ethane conversion but a decrease in ethylene selectivity compared to ethane DH. For the byproduct, there is a small increase in methane selectivity before and after the addition of O2. Therefore, it can be concluded that, for the Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 catalyst, the ethane conversion and the ethylene yield were greatly improved after the introduction of O2, and both CO and CO2 were detected.
Figure 7
Figure 7. Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 (NaOH) direct dehydrogenation of ethane versus ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of O2: (A) 923 K and (B) 973 K.
At the same time, Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 was tested for a long time under the conditions of ethane dehydrogenation with oxygen addition, and the test results are shown in Figure S9 of the Supporting Information. The catalyst was slightly deactivated during the 10 h run, and the reaction reached a steady state at about 8 h, with 31% ethane conversion and 75% ethylene selectivity obtained after stabilization. In comparison to the ethane direct dehydrogenation (Figure S8 of the Supporting Information), the addition of O2 not only increased the activity but also made the catalyst much more stable, which was attributed to the elimination of coke with the addition of O2.
Furthermore, the blank experimental results of the ethane thermal oxidation in the presence of O2 were compared to those of O2-DH with Au/Ti-D-ERB-1. The thermal oxidation of ethane in O2-DH obtained lower ethylene selectivity and higher CO2 selectivity. However, the ethane conversion is greatly improved with the Au-loaded catalyst, and ethylene is the main product, with only a small amount of CO and CO2 existing. It was found that the selectivity of CO2 decreased from 53% for the thermal oxidation of ethane to 13% for O2-DH with a catalyst, while the ethylene selectivity is 25% higher for catalytic O2-DH than thermal oxidation. These phenomena confirmed that the improved ethylene yield from ethane by O2-DH is the catalytic effect of the Au-loaded catalyst. It has been confirmed that the Au-loaded catalyst can activate C–H bonds for ethane direct dehydrogenation. Meanwhile, in the O2-DH reaction, both oxidants, CO2 and O2, which may react in tandem with H2, are present. It has been reported that the Au-loaded catalysts can promote ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene with the addition of CO2 for consuming H2 through the RWGS reaction with the prepared catalysts, such as Au/CeO2, Au/TiO2, and Au/ZnO. (20,25−27) On the other side, it is possible that O2 can improve ethane dehydrogenation further through SHC by consuming H2 during the reaction with the catalyst. (37,38)
The O2-DH reaction of ethane can generate CO2 and H2, and the possibility of them proceeding with the RWGS reaction and contributing to increasing ethane conversion was tested for Au/Ti-D-ERB-1. For the test of the RWGS reaction, CO2 and H2 were catalyzed by Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 at the same reaction condition as the corresponding CO2-ODH reaction, and Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 can convert 35% of CO2 to CO, as shown in Figure S10 of the Supporting Information. Furthermore, the ethane conversion did not increase significantly after the introduction of CO2 compared to the activity of ethane direct dehydrogenation. However, the selectivity of CO was detected to be greater than 90% under this reaction condition, which indicated that CO was converted from CO2. Note that the selectivity of CO at this point is calculated on the basis of CO generated versus CO2 converted. Therefore, although Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 can catalyze the RWGS reaction under the ethane CO2-ODH reaction condition, the effect of the RWGS to improve the ethane conversion and ethylene yield is not obvious. The reason for the increased ethane conversion and ethylene yield of Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 in O2-DH compared to ethane direct dehydrogenation may be due to the SHC reaction during the reaction and, thus, the consumption of H2.
Influence of Selective H2 Combustion on Ethane Dehydrogenation with Au–Ti Paired Active Sites in the Presence of O2
Catalytic Mechanism of the Au–Ti Paired Active Site for Tandem Reaction of Ethane Dehydrogenation with Selective H2 Combustion
To compare the catalytic effect of Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 in O2-DH, Au/D-ERB-1 and Au/ZnO-D-ERB-1 samples containing ZnO were prepared and compared under the same test conditions, and the results of the activity are shown in Figure 8. Au/D-ERB-1 exhibited the lowest ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity at 923 K, accompanied by a large amount of CO2 production. Au/ZnO-D-ERB-1 showed higher ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity than Au/D-ERB-1, while Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 showed the highest ethane conversion and higher ethylene selectivity and the lowest selectivity for CO and CO2. The lower catalytic performance of Au/D-ERB-1 can be due to its lower loading and larger particle size of the loaded Au particle.
Figure 8
Figure 8. Comparison of O2-DH of different samples: (A) 923 K and (B) 973 K.
Because the loadings and particle sizes of their Au NPs of Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 and Au/ZnO-D-ERB-1 are relatively close, it can be deduced that the difference in ethane conversion and product selectivity for these two Au-loaded catalysts comes from the different effects of ZnO and TiO2 for grafting the Au nanoparticles. The XPS results of Au and ZnO in Figure 5 show that Au–ZnO in Au/ZnO-D-ERB-1 has a strong SMSIs, while Au–Ti pairs have less electron transfer phenomenon and no significant electronic effect. It has been reported that, in the presence of CO2, Au interacts with the n-type semiconductor ZnO electronically to generate negatively charged CO2 and H2 for the RWGS reaction to improve ethane dehydrogenation. (26) The ethylene yield of Au/ZnO-D-ERB-1 was significantly enhanced in comparison to Au/D-ERB-1, which was attributed to the electronic effect of Au–ZnO, in agreement with the results in the literature. (25,26) However, the good catalytic performance for the highest ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity for Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 compared to Au/ZnO-D-ERB-1 should exclude the effect of the electron transfer effect in the O2-DH reaction. It has been reported that Au with particle sizes smaller than 5 nm can be anchored in zeolite containing a tetrahedral-coordinated Ti-containing MWW zeolite, and Au–Ti pairs with Au particle sizes below 5 nm have a higher activity to generate H2O2. (39,40) In the epoxidation reaction, H2 reacts with O2 to generate H2O2 intermediates in the presence of Au NPs as the catalysts, which then migrate to the Ti(IV) site of the carrier to form titanium hydroperoxide species, which form epoxides with other substances. (21−24) For the Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 (NaOH) catalysts, the Au particle size prepared with the DP method was mostly distributed below 5 nm, which can also catalyze the O2 reaction with H2 generated during dehydrogenation in the O2-DH reaction condition. However, at the higher temperature, the generation of H2O2 does not seem possible, which can immediately decompose to H2O in this reaction condition.
Meanwhile, the ratio of H2 to C2H4 detected in the products of DH and the O2-DH reaction for 60 min was calculated, and the results are summarized in Table S2 of the Supporting Information. In the ethane direct dehydrogenation, the ratio of H2/C2H4 is close to 1, indicating H2 and C2H4 in the product. In the O2-DH reaction, only a small amount of H2 was monitored with a H2/C2H4 ratio of only 0.06 when using the Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 catalyst, indicating that a large amount of H2 was consumed. In addition, the H2/C2H4 ratios of both Au/D-ERB-1 and Au/ZnO-D-ERB-1 were larger than that of the Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 catalyst, indicating that H2 of Au/D-ERB-1 and Au/ZnO-D-ERB-1 was not completely consumed. In combination with its higher ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity, the catalytic effect of Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 was again demonstrated to be due to its priority to catalyze the H2 SHC reaction.
Therefore, in ethane O2-DH, the Au–Ti active sites on the surface of the Ti-D-ERB-1 surface may catalyze not only the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene but also the reaction of H2 with O2 to form H2O2, which is decomposed to H2O in a high temperature. These effects further promote the SHC reaction and shift ethane dehydrogenation equilibrium to increase the ethane dehydrogenation conversion and suppress the ethane thermal oxidation to CO and CO2.
The ratio of O2 in the ethane O2-DH reaction was adjusted from 4 to 2 to 1 mL to investigate the reaction mechanism for generation of C2H4, CO, and CO2 under the condition of a constant total gas flow rate and constant ethane flow rate at 923 K with Au/Ti-D-ERB-1, and the catalytic results are shown in Figure S11 of the Supporting Information. As shown in Figure S11A of the Supporting Information, the ethane conversion decreases as the O2 ratio decreases, while the selectivity of ethylene increases. Moreover, the selectivity of CO2 decreases significantly, eventually to 7%. This phenomenon shows that, in the O2-DH reaction, O2 reacts with H2 preferentially, and as the proportion of O2 decreases, H2 produced by ethane dehydrogenation consumes most O2 through the SHC reaction; therefore, the selectivity of the ethane thermal oxidation product CO2 is gradually reduced. In addition, the selectivity of CO is increasing while CO2 is decreasing as the proportion of O2 decreases, which indicates that CO is a partially oxidative product from ethane or ethylene during the thermal oxidation process. Therefore, for the O2-DH reaction with Au/Ti-D-ERB-1, on the one hand, C2H6 is dehydrogenated by Au nanoparticle active sites to C2H4 and H2, and O2, which has a preference to react with H2, undergoes the SHC reaction. On the other hand, ethane can also be thermally oxidized by O2 to form CO, and CO can be further oxidized to CO2 with an excess amount of O2. The reaction mechanism diagram of ethane O2-DH is shown in Figure S12 of the Supporting Information.
Kinetics Distingush the Activity Difference between Au–Ti and Au–ZnO Active Sites by the Distinction of Ethane O2-DH with Thermal Oxidation and DH Reaction
As mentioned before, catalytic O2-DH with Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 is a tandem reaction with the Au active site for ethane dehydrogenation, and resulting H2 undergoes the SHC reaction with O2. Thermal oxidation can be considered as the side reaction to generate CO2 and CO. To highlight the catalytic effect of Au–Ti active sites in O2-DH, the product yield difference between O2-DH and the corresponding product yield of thermal oxidative dehydrogenation and direct catalytic ethane dehydrogenation was calculated. Table 2 represents the difference in the yields of C2H4 and CO2 and the ratio of the yields of C2H4 to other byproducts. The ethylene yield difference (YC2H4,diff) for each catalyst was positive, indicating that the catalytic activity of the catalysts in O2-DH was not a simple addition of thermal oxidative dehydrogenation and direct catalytic ethane dehydrogenation. At the same time, the difference in the yield of CO2 was negative (YCO2,diff), indicating that the catalyst significantly reduced the yield of CO2. From the value of YC2H4,diff of each catalyst, it can be seen that the numerical value of Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 is the largest in these three catalysts. Therefore, the catalytic effect of Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 was also most obvious during these catalysts for O2-DH. In summary, the highest YC2H4,diff and lowest YCO2,diff for Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 also support the consumption that Au–Ti combined dehydrogenation and SHC were superior to other catalysts for O2-DH.

cca is shorthand for use with catalysts.
Moreover, Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 has the highest ratios of YC2H4/YCO2 and YC2H4/YCO among the three catalysts. This also confirms that the Au–Ti sites are superior to other catalysts for promoting the SHC reaction in O2-DH. The ratios of YC2H4/YCO2 and YC2H4/YCO increased after increasing the reaction temperature. Therefore, with the increased temperature, the effect of Au–Ti may be more pronounced. However, the increase of thermal cracking activity for CH4 generation increased with the increase of the temperature. Therefore, the selectivity of CH4 increases and the ratio of YC2H4/YCH4 decreases.
Kinetic calculations were performed to further explore O2-DH over the catalyst. In O2-DH, the conversion of Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 (NaOH) was higher than the DH equilibrium conversion at the corresponding temperature, (8) indicating that the thermodynamic equilibrium of ethane dehydrogenation was broken after the SHC reaction after the addition of O2. Because the ethane conversion of O2-DH is already higher than the ethane direct dehydrogenation equilibrium conversion at the same temperature, according to the Van’t Hoff equation, the apparent reaction heat of C2H4 dehydrogenation (ΔH) was calculated for O2-DH according to the ethylene yields of different catalysts in the temperature range of 923–973 K. This process is composed of ethane dehydrogenation and the sequential SHC reaction. In addition, the apparent activation energies of the two tandem reactions of ethane oxidation to CO and further oxidation to CO2 were also calculated as irreversible steps based on the CO and CO2 yields in the temperature range of 923–973 K. Apparent activation energies of DH were also calculated. These results of the reaction activation energy calculation are shown in Table S3 of the Supporting Information.
It can be seen that, without a catalyst, the apparent activation energy barriers of autothermal pyrolysis of C2H6 to C2H4, thermal oxidation of C2H6 to CO, and further thermal oxidation of CO to CO2 are 286.1, 306.7, and 109.7 kJ mol–1 respectively. Although the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene is the endothermal reaction, the SHC reaction is the exothermal reaction. SHC consumed H2 generated by dehydrogenation and shifted the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward the product side, resulting in more propensity to generate C2H4 during the reaction. The calculated apparent ethane dehydrogenation reaction heat is the composed reaction heat with the sequential reaction of ethane dehydrogenation and SHC. Therefore, with the catalyst, the coupling reaction heat decreased. The loaded Au catalysts with different carriers show different catalytic performances for these tandem reaction components. Although the Au dehydrogenation activity is similar, the structure–activity relationship of Au with the different carriers has a different influence on the SHC reaction. Obviously, the Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 catalyst has the lowest apparent reaction heat, indicating that the heat supplement effect is more obvious for the SHC exothermal reaction with of Au–Ti active sites, which also indicates the good catalytic effect of Au–Ti active sites in the SHC reaction. It can be seen from Table S3 of the Supporting Information that, with the catalyst, the apparent activation energy for generating CO is significantly higher than that for generating C2H4. For Au/Ti-D-ERB-1, the energy barrier for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene is only 106.7 kJ mol–1, which is lower than the apparent activation energy barrier for CO generation (306.7 kJ mol–1). This indicates that, in the presence of the Au-loaded catalyst for the O2-DH reaction, the reaction is more inclined to generate C2H4 and only a small amount of CO is generated. In addition, the activation energy of CO2 is lower than that of C2H4, but the actual CO2 selectivity is much lower than that of C2H4. This indicates that the formation of CO is the rate-controlling step for the formation of CO2, and the reaction is also kinetically controlled. This also fully shows that the generation of CO2 requires further oxidation of CO, which is consistent with the above results.
Conclusion

Borosilicate zeolite ERB-1 with MWW topology was synthesized by hydrothermal synthesis, and deboronated D-ERB-1 was synthesized by post-treatment. Then, Ti-D-ERB-1 was prepared by the atom-planting method with TiCl4 from D-ERB-1. Then, loading of Au was performed by the deposition–precipitation method, and the effects of different loading amounts and particle sizes of Au-containing catalysts on ethane dehydrogenation were investigated. The suitable loading of Au nanoparticles was found to be 0.7 wt %. Meanwhile, the results showed that Au NPs smaller than 5 nm had the highest ethane dehydrogenation activity. In the O2-DH reaction, the addition of O2 significantly improved the C2H6 conversion of the Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 catalyst and had higher selectivity for the main product C2H4. This is attributed to the fact that the addition of O2 improves the SHC reaction for H2 generated by dehydrogenation, which can shift the dehydrogenation equilibrium toward the product side and result in more tendency to generate C2H4 during the reaction. The Au–Ti site in Au/Ti-D-ERB-1 has higher ethane O2-DH activity compared to Au/D-ERB-1 and Au/ZnO-D-ERB-1 catalysts. The reaction mechanism of Au–Ti paired active sites in O2-DH was explored. On the one hand, Au–Ti can catalyze ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene and hydrogen, while on the other hand, Au–Ti can further catalyze SHC of hydrogen, which suppresses incomplete oxidation of ethane to CO and further complete oxidation to CO2 and promotes dehydrogenation of C2H6 to C2H4. These phenomena were further confirmed with the quantitative calculation of the kinetic parameters and activity difference between O2-DH with catalytic ethane DH and thermal oxidation.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
