The provided document discusses the influence of Au-Ti active sites of a titanosilicate MWW zeolite on the catalytic activity for ethane dehydrogenation in the presence of O2. It does not mention propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically. Therefore, this document does not seem directly relevant to advances in PDH or ODH catalysts.
