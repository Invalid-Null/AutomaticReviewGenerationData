 Unfortunately, this document does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation based on my assessment. The document discusses ethanol conversion to syngas via catalytic partial oxidation over rhodium catalysts. It does not mention propane, propylene, or any propane dehydrogenation processes. Therefore, I cannot extract the requested information related to propane dehydrogenation catalysts or processes from this manuscript.
