1. Introduction
Catalytic Partial Oxidation (CPO) of hydrocarbons and alcohols is a prominent technology for syngas production [1,2]. CPO has some advantages with respect to the economically viable Steam Reforming (SR) as it has faster start up and does not require an external heating source due to its relatively high exothermicity [[3], [4], [5]]. As a matter of fact, the process can be carried out in simple compact reactors, being the feed modulated in such way to balance exothermic and endothermic kinetics to achieve autothermal regime [[6], [7], [8], [9]]. Studies on the CPO optimization are being extensively performed on methane-rich resources as conventional natural gas, flare gas and shale gas, due to the ever increasing demand of H2 in large-scale processes like methanol and ammonia synthesis, which account together for more than 260 million metric tons/year [[10], [11], [12], [13]].
Even though the consolidation of CPO technology still faces bottlenecks to be dealt with, as the catalytic deactivation by coke formation, sintering of the active phase with temperature, formation of localized hot spots and the need of upstream units to separate O2 from air or downstream units to separate N2 from syngas [14,15], according to Basini and co-workers [16] the result of years of R&D is heightening CPO towards the industrialization phase, being the main advantages i) technical and operational simplicity, ii) flexibility towards feedstock composition and production capacity, iii) reduction of energy consumption leading to lower C-footprint.
These same factors make the CPO technology especially suitable to small-scale processes, where rapid dynamic response, stringent volume constraints and energy efficiency are crucial; these include both fuel processors for stationary applications (such as fuel cells or combined heat and power systems), and on board syngas generators serving a variety of uses such as H2 injection in the combustion chamber, reduction of catalytic aftertreatment units, fueling of Auxiliary Power Units [14]. In this respect, the increasing penetration of bioethanol in the market of transportation fuels, also makes ethanol autothermal reforming via CPO process an interesting area of research [[17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]].
The stoichiometric ethanol partial oxidation is slightly endothermic (Eq. 1) and, accompanied by the total combustion of ethanol (Eq. 2), the autothermal process can be achieved. Steam reforming of ethanol and water gas shift (Eq. 3 and 4) are also relevant reactions to be considered in the global process of ethanol conversion to syngas:

Salge and co-workers [22] demonstrated the feasibility of the partial oxidation of ethanol in milliseconds contact time adiabatic reactors. Several metals supported on γ-alumina (Rh, Pt, Pd, Rh-Pd and Rh-Ce) were tested, feeding ethanol and ethanol-water mixtures. Rapid vaporization and mixing allowed to minimize homogeneous reactions and thus the formation of carbon, acetaldehyde, ethylene and total combustion products [23]. Under the conditions used in the experiments, surface reactions dominated and the results were interpreted based on the prevailing mechanism reported in the literature, according to which ethanol activation on metals proceeds via adsorption as an ethoxy species, decomposition to surface carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen species and rapid recombination and desorption of H2 and CO [24,25]. Rh catalysts were reported to be mostly selective to syngas and more stable among the investigated noble metals. Schmidt’s group extended the application of the millisecond-contact time CPO reactors to different alcohols (methanol and 1 and 2-propanol), in the presence of Rh and Rh-Ce catalytic systems [21]. On Rh-Ce, selectivity towards H2 was always higher than 70 %, being it strongly dependent on the structure and size of the alcohol and the presence of the promoting specie. Cerium oxide acted as a promoter in these experiments and suppressed significantly the yield of side-reaction products as oxygenates and olefins.
Cavallaro and co-workers [26] also studied ethanol partial oxidation on Rh/Al2O3. Metal sintering was pointed out as a major issue of such a formulation and was attributed to the existence of a local hot spot on the catalytic surface resulting from the autothermal process.
The effect of different metals and supports was studied by Chen et al. [27]. They showed that ZrO2, CeO2, Al2O3 and La2O3 play an important role on product selectivity and ethanol conversion and that Ir/La2O3 and Rh/La2O3 significantly suppressed the formation of undesired by-products as CH4, ethylene and acetaldehyde.
A significant advancement in the comprehension of chemical pathways and kinetics of the catalytic partial oxidation of ethanol in adiabatic reactors was obtained by Livio and co-workers [28], by applying the spatially resolved sampling technique thus collecting axial concentration profiles, as well as surface and gas phase temperature profiles during CPO experiments over Rh/α-Al2O3 coated monoliths. It was shown that, similarly to the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, also the CPO of ethanol gives rise to two active zones inside the catalytic channels: an initial oxy-reforming zone, where the O2 reaches complete consumption, and a reforming zone, where the steam reforming of the fuel is the dominating reaction. It was also shown that the final reactor temperature and the extent of ethanol conversion are strictly dependent on the C/O ratio of the feed and that the oxygen atom within the hydroxyl group was not as effective as molecular O2 in the conversion process. Moreover, it was shown that both upstream from the catalytic monolith and in the inlet zone, side products such as methane, ethylene, acetaldehyde were formed and could be explained by the gas-phase reactivity of feed.
In this work, the study of ethanol CPO in Rh-coated monoliths was further extended by applying the axially resolved sampling technique. Focus of the present investigation has been on the long-term stability of the reactor performance. H2O co-feed was herein explored as a potential strategy for contrasting C-deposition phenomena, recognized to be a major source of activity loss and thermal drift of the reactor.
2. Experiments and methods
2.1. Catalysts preparation
2% Rh/α-Al2O3 powders were obtained starting from the initial calcination of a commercial γ-Al2O3 (Sasol PURALOX Sba-200), at 1100 °C for 10 h, with a heating ramp of 1 °C/min and a cooling ramp of 2 °C/min. The thermal treatment resulted in the BET surface area of 8 m2/g, the porous volume (Hg porosimetry) of 0.21 mL/g.
Then Rh was added via incipient wetness impregnation technique using a Rh(NO3)3 solution (Chempur, 15.11 % wt. Rh). After impregnation, the powders were dried overnight at 110 °C. For the preparation of the slurry, the impregnated powders were mixed in a PTFE jar with H2O, HNO3 as dispersant and zirconia balls and the system was ball-milled for 24 h at constant rotational speed of 60 rpm. The amounts of H2O and HNO3 per mass of catalyst powder were equal to 1.4 mmol HNO3/gpowder and 1.7 mL H2O/gpowder. At the end of the ball-milling, a homogeneous and stable suspension was obtained.
In this work, catalytic monoliths were prepared using cordierite (2MgO∙2Al2O3∙5SiO2) 400/7 honeycomb monoliths cut in the shape of cylinders with 1-inch diameter and about 4 cm length; the monoliths were dipped into the slurry, then removed, and the remaining excess of the latter was blown away with compressed air (p =7 bar). The monoliths were finally flash-dried in an oven at 280 °C for 20 s. A certain length of the monolith was left uncoated; this part can be exploited as front or back heat shield depending on the assembly of the reactor. In the present ethanol-CPO experiments, the uncoated part of the monolith was always placed downstream from the catalytic layer, thus acting as back heat shield (BHS). The same arrangement was used elsewhere [28].
The coated monoliths were tagged as NE5 and NE6 and their properties are reported in Table 1. Both monoliths were prepared from the same slurry and comparable catalyst loadings were obtained.

2.2. CPO tests
Fig. 1 shows the reactor assemblage where the catalyst was first loaded in a quartz tube (ID =1 inch, length =12 cm) in between two inert monoliths. The front monolith (15 ppi open-cell foam monolith, 1 cm length) was placed 1 cm upstream the catalyst, to promote the reactant mixing. The back monolith (400 CPSI inert cordierite monolith, 3 cm length) was located 2−3 cm downstream from the end of the catalyst and was used to reduce the axial heat loss. The quartz pipe was then loaded in an AISI 316 L stainless steel tube (the vessel of the reactor), equipped with inlet Swagelok fittings and an outlet flange for the connection of the gas lines. Quartz-fiber mat was used to wrap the monolith and prevent any gas leakage in between the monoliths and the quartz tube. External insulation was obtained by a thick layer of wrapped quartz wool.

Two deactivated fused silica capillaries (Agilent) were alternately inserted in a central channel of the catalyst from the upstream side and could slide along the axial coordinate, controlled by a linear stage actuator (Zaber® T-LA). The first capillary (ID 530 μm, OD 670 μm) is sealed at one end and was used to host an optical fiber or a K-type thermocouple. The optical fiber (Polymicro, FVP300), which has a 45° angled tip, conveys the radiation from the catalyst wall towards an infrared pyrometer (Impac Infrtherm, IGA5-LO) as explained by Donazzi et al. [29]. Instead, the K-type thermocouple measures the gas-phase temperature. The second capillary (ID 200 μm, OD 360 μm), opened at both ends, was used to acquire gas samples, which were analyzed with an Inficon MicroGC Fusion chromatograph, in order to determine the gas phase concentration of different species [8,30]. The dimensions of the capillary and the low suction flow rate were selected to minimize the disturbance of the flow field inside the channel. Besides, drawing the samples from the reactor inlet (the cold side) counter-currently to the reacting flow prohibits any reaction inside the capillary as the gases are quenched by the incoming cold reactants [31]. The chromatograph was equipped with two fused silica columns: Rt®-Molsieve 5A, which uses argon as carrier gas, and Rt®-Q-Bond which uses helium. The used analysis method includes a temperature ramp which allows optimal separation of the species. At each axial position, three samples were analyzed, and the mass balances typically closed between 0.95 and 1.05.
The reliability of the measurement technique was systematically verified by comparing each experimentally measured oxygen concentration profile with a calculated profile setting the oxygen consumption to be governed by mass transfer limitations, as it is commonly accepted in the literature [32].
The reactor was fed with a mixture of air, complementary nitrogen, water and ethanol. All the experiments were performed with a constant flow rate of 10 N L/min and a fixed C/O ratio of 0.65, changing the water molar fraction in the feed (YH2O = 0−0.1). The C/O ratio, Eq. 5, was defined following the same definition presented in [28], being the molar flow of carbon of ethanol divided by the molar flow of oxygen in both ethanol and air.

A Gilson Minipuls 3 peristaltic pump delivered the C2H5OH/H2O liquid mixture into an evaporator, which consisted of a 40 cm long 1 in. pipe, filled with random packings, located inside an oven. The oven was set to ensure that the evaporated liquid-air mixture had a temperature of 100 °C at the entrance of the reactor. The C2H5OH/H2O liquid mixtures were prepared on mass basis to provide the required molar concentrations in the feed.
To light off the reactor in the absence of a heating source, the procedure adopted in previous works was followed [8]. It consists of two phases; the catalyst is preheated by the catalytic combustion of hydrogen by feeding to the reactor a 6% v/v hydrogen and 3% v/v oxygen in nitrogen mixture with a flow rate of 5 N L/min. Once the temperature observed by a rear thermocouple reaches a value of about 220 °C, the inlet mixture of the reactor is switched to the effective CPO feed mixture. The light-off transient lasts about 30 min due to thermal capacity of the whole reactor assembly; thus, temperature and composition measurements are collected after reaching the steady state condition.
2.3. Temperature programmed oxidation - TPO
The TPO tests were performed on the coated part of the monoliths, divided into 3 segments (0−7 mm, 7−12 mm, 12−21 mm). Samples were cut from the central channels of each segment to ensure a catalyst mass of 0.02 g. The samples were crushed into small pieces, then packed inside the quartz reactor (I.D. = 7 mm) in between quartz wool beds. The reactor was connected to a rig for standard activity tests and placed inside an oven. The TPO test consisted of heating the sample from ambient temperature to 700 °C with a rate of 2 °C/min while flowing air at 30 N mL/min. The outlet gases were analyzed with an Agilent 3000A Micro gas chromatograph, equipped with a molecular sieve column and a PlotQ column. The CO2 flow rate produced by the combustion of the surface C-species was measured (μmol/min). Products were analyzed every 180 s.
2.4. Thermodynamic analysis
Equilibrium compositions were calculated by Gibb’s free energy minimization using a home-made code written in Matlab R2018b language. The analysis was performed at constant enthalpy and pressure (adiabatic reactor), by assigning an inlet temperature of 100 °C and varying the C/O ratio and the molar fraction of water in the feed. The analysis included the gas phase species
and the possible formation of solid graphitic carbon.
The assumption of adiabatic conditions involved the simultaneous solution of the enthalpy balance (6) and the determination of the

The thermodynamic analysis of the system C2H5OH/O2/H2O/N2 was performed in order to determine the effect of feed composition, thus a parametric analysis on the effect of the C/O ratio and the ratio R (defined by Eq. 7) was performed. Notably, the definition of R in this work is such that H2O was treated as a complementary gas, added to the air/ethanol feed, similarly to the extra N2 feed.
(7)
This reflects the method of the catalytic testing were various H2O feed content were explored by keeping constant the ethanol and air flows, as well as the total flow rate; thus, water co-feed was always associated with an equal decrease of the dilution N2 feed.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Results of the thermodynamic analysis
The major objective of the thermodynamic study was the identification of feed conditions such that the expected adiabatic temperature did not exceed the threshold of catalyst deactivation by sintering (850−900 °C, in our experience) and the formation of solid C was avoided. The results are shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, in terms of calculated adiabatic temperature and product yield (moles of product per mole of ethanol) at varying feed C/O ratio in the range 0.5−1.0. Notably, the predicted ethanol conversion is complete in all the explored conditions.

Fig. 3. Thermodynamic calculations: Effect of R ratio on the adiabatic temperature and equilibrium species’ molar fraction.
For a fixed R ratio (R = 0.5) and inlet temperature T = 100 °C, Fig. 2 shows the important effect of C/O ratio on the adiabatic temperature; a strong decline is evaluated in the range C/O = 0.5 – 0.75, while a more moderate decline is predicted in the range of fuel rich feeds. The effect of H2O co-feeding on the calculated adiabatic temperature is moderate; but a decreasing effect is especially appreciated at the highest C/O ratios.
The important change of the temperature profile slope passing from low to high C/O ratios is consistent with a major change of the product distribution since fuel rich conditions are associated with the increasing formation of solid carbon among the equilibrium products.
Regarding the product distribution, throughout the entire range of C/O ratios, the calculated H2 yield increases with the increase of H2O content. This trend is paralleled by CO2, while it is accompanied by a drop of the CO yield and of the net production of H2O, consistently with the displacement of the of the water gas shift equilibrium due to H2O addition. The yield of H2 and CO pass through maxima at C/O ratios in between 0.70−0.75, depending on the water feed content. Indeed, the increase of C2H5OH percentage towards C/O = 1.0 causes a drastic decrease of the syngas yield due to the formation of solid carbon. However, the increase of H2O content enlarges the C/O window in which solid carbon is suppressed.
In order to understand the thermal effect of dilution with N2, thermodynamic calculations were performed by parametrically varying the ratio R from 0.25 to 1, while keeping H2O concentration equal to 5% in the feed and inlet temperature T = 100 °C. The increase of R caused an important decrease of the adiabatic temperature in the entire range of C/O ratio. This results in lower H2 and CO yields and increased formation of CH4 and C. The dilution with N2 also reduces the safe C/O feed ration where no C is formed.
Based on the equilibrium calculations, the working conditions of the present study were selected in order to keep the reaction system far from the conditions that thermodynamically favors coke formation, and to obtain a trade-off between maximization of syngas production and minimization of hot-spot temperatures while keeping the temperature high enough to relieve the kinetic burden; thus, the effect of H2O co-feed was studied by keeping the R ratio equal to 0.5 and the C/O ratio equal to 0.65. The explored feed compositions are presented in Table 2.

3.2. Benchmark methane CPO test

The obtained profiles are qualitatively similar to the results found in previous studies from our and other groups [9,29,31,33] dealing with the CPO of CH4 and higher hydrocarbons. Typically, two reaction zones are distinguished: the inlet oxy-reforming zone, where oxygen is still present in the gas phase, and the downstream reforming zone, where oxygen is totally converted. In the oxy-reforming zone an overlap of oxidation and reforming reactions on the catalyst surface is realized, leading to a steep increase of the temperature and the formation of a hot-spot. Then the reforming reactions occurring in the reforming zone contribute to lower the temperature and increase syngas productivity. Modelling analyses taking into account the kinetics of the heterogeneous reactions (independently derived) and the correlation of gas-solid heat and mass transport in monolith channels have shown that oxygen consumption is fully controlled by its diffusion rate (thus the radial mass transport) while methane consumption proceeds under mixed chemical-diffusive control [34]. Once the oxygen is completely consumed by the oxidation reactions, the fuel continues to react with water, via a steam reforming reaction, thus producing hydrogen and carbon monoxide. As a result of the overlap between exothermic reactions and endothermic reforming reactions, the temperature of the solid phase, measured by the pyrometer through the optic fiber, is expected to exhibit a maximum at the entrance of the monolith (in the oxy-reforming zone) and to further decline (in the reforming zone) down to the adiabatic equilibrium temperature and the full equilibration with the gas-phase temperature profile, measured by the thermocouple.
In this study, as shown by the temperature and concentration profiles in Fig. 4, the temperature profiles of solid-phase and gas-phase were flat along most of the monolith length with only a modest growth of a hot spot, much less intense than that observed in previous studies; besides, axial concentration profiles were very steep at the very entrance of the reactor and equilibrium mole fractions were reached in the first 5 mm of the catalyst. Thus, the two zones are not clearly distinguishable, but a unique short reaction zone is detected. This behavior can be explained by the high amount of the active catalyst related to the increased thickness of the coating as explained by Beretta et al. [34]. This measure was taken to minimize the risk of deactivation in the ethanol campaign, based on previous experience with liquid hydrocarbons representative of transportation fuels [32].
It is finally observed that at the catalyst outlet, the pyrometer signal has a sudden drop since the tip of the optical fiber collects the radiation from the surrounding surfaces of the reactor, which are at lower temperature [28]. The temperature measured by the thermocouple downstream the monolith decreases as well, but at a lower extent, because of the cup mixing phenomena, that is, the mixing of gases of the central and outer channels which might be colder due to some residual heat dispersion of the system. The thermal efficiency α of the reactor (Eq. 8) was evaluated to verify the adiabatic operation of the process.

In Eq. 8,

The thermal efficiency of the reactor for all the performed experiments in this study, methane and ethanol CPO, was α > 0.95 in line with values proposed by Livio and co-workers [28], which indicated that the reactor operated in a condition very close to the adiabatic one.
The methane CPO test was repeated after every ethanol test and the obtained results were compared with the initial benchmark test to evaluate the effect of ethanol CPO on the catalyst stability as explained in the following sections.
3.3. Effect of H2O co-feed on ethanol CPO
Tests of ethanol CPO with and without H2O co-feed were carried out on monoliths NE5 and NE6 respectively with an inlet flow rate of 10 N L/min and a C/O ratio of 0.65, in line with the results of the thermodynamic study. The H2O co-feed tests were performed in the following order: (i) test with 10 % H2O co-feed and measurement of the temperature profile, (ii) test with 10 % H2O co-feed and measurement of the concentration profiles, (iii) test with 3% H2O co-feed with measurement of temperature profiles, (iv) test with 3% H2O co-feed and measurement of concentration profiles. The dry tests were performed on the other monolith (NE6) where a test was performed with the measurement of the temperature profiles followed by another test with the measurement of the concentration profiles, then the same sequence was repeated again to evaluate the effect of the catalyst deactivation on the temperature and the concentration profiles.
The spatially resolved temperature profiles of these experiments are presented in Fig. 5. They are selected among the four repetitions that were collected for every working condition.

The temperature profiles obtained for dry ethanol CPO was in line with previous findings in the literature [8,9,28]. Here, the co-feed of H2O did not seem to affect significantly the thermal behavior. The intensity and the position of the hotspot was similar as in the H2O-free system. Additionally, the temperature measured at the end of the catalytic layer were in line with the adiabatic equilibrium values obtained by the thermodynamic calculations.
As the experiments were performed with a higher oxygen concentration than the stoichiometric partial oxidation (C/O ratio of 0.65), ethanol was almost completely converted in all the experiments. Fig. 6 shows the effect of water co-feed on the integral performance of the reactor, obtained during the T-measurement tests by sampling the product mixture downstream from the reactor. The water co-feed had a significant effect on reaching complete ethanol conversion and improving the hydrogen production.

The axial concentration profiles of the reactants and the main products that were measured in the dedicated experiments are plotted in Fig. 8 in terms of molar fraction of all the detected gas-phase species. In close analogy with the case of methane CPO, also in ethanol CPO oxygen was consumed within the same characteristic length of about 5 mm from the entrance as presented in Fig. 7 comparing the normalized oxygen profiles for ethanol CPO and methane CPO at different feeding C/O ratio. The complete overlapping between the profiles measured with the different fuels confirms that oxidation reactions proceed under full mass transfer control and are thus insensitive to the nature of the fuel and verifies that the measurement technique has minor impact on the results. As reported in the Experimental section, the profiles match well with model predictions of O2 consumption under condition of full mass transfer control, providing further confidence on the reliability of the results.

Ethanol consumption, instead, occurred along a more extended length (about 10 mm) by a combination of total oxidation and steam reforming; it is worthwhile emphasizing that, under O2 mass transfer limitation, the concentration of O2 at the gas-solid interface drops to zero and steam reforming reactions can proceed, thus producing CO and H2 still in the presence of O2 in the bulk phase. The ethanol consumption rate was faster than that of the observed rate by Carrera et al. [9] for iso-octane CPO and n-octane CPO; this can be partly explained by the higher diffusivity of ethanol in the gas mixture (DC2H5OH/ Air / DC8H18/Air = 1.8 according to Fuller et al. correlation [35]). Oxidation reactions involving H2, CO and ethanol at the catalyst entrance were responsible for the observed peak of H2O and the step increase of CO2 concentration, while the onset of reforming reactions at the very catalyst entrance was responsible for the sudden increase of H2 and CO concentration.
Beside the main products of the process, acetaldehyde, ethylene, methane and minor amounts of ethane were also observed. Results are reported in Fig. 9. In all the cases, a peak of concentration was observed in the initial part of the monolith channel; thus, all the by-products were formed at the reactor inlet and then rapidly consumed. Only in the case of methane a non-null concentration was measured downstream of the peak until the end of the channel. These results are qualitatively similar to those found in the past when studying the CPO of propane and the CPO of n-octane and iso-octane. In those experiments, the formation of hydrocarbon species was explained by the onset of homogeneous reactions (due to the local temperature rise) and the rapid consumption was associated with the consecutive steam reforming on the catalyst surface. The present observations appear very close and related to the same phenomenology. They are also in line with previous studies that related their formation homogenous reactions, but did not exclude possible contributions from the surface chemistry [28]. Noncatalytic oxidation and pyrolysis of ethanol are in fact known to produce acetaldehyde, methane and ethylene as the main products [22,28,36]. On the other hand oxidative and acidic functionalities of the Rh/Al2O3 catalyst might also justify heterogenous routes for the formation of the byproducts; an oxidative dehydrogenation route could contribute to the production of acetaldehyde, while ethylene production could be partly due to the acidity of the Al2O3 support acting as a catalyst for the ethanol dehydration [37]. Methane can be produced in the first millimeters of the monolith via homogenous cracking reactions of ethanol and acetaldehyde [22,28,37]. Traces of ethane and diethyl ether were observed in the study performed by Hebben et al. [6], but diethyl ether was not observed in the present work, likely due to lower C/O ratio herein explored. Although the kinetic scheme behind the formation of such species and the relative role of homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions is not entirely understood at the moment, clearly all the species were rapidly consumed by steam reforming on the catalyst surface and further converted into syngas. In the case of methane, the additional contribution of methanation reaction is believed responsible for the non-null measured concentrations at the end of the catalytic channel (in analogy with the above-mentioned studies with other fuels) [8,28].

Fig. 9. Concentration profiles for the CPO of C2H5OH with H2O co-feed – Acetaldehyde and light hydrocarbons; C2H5OH = 11.2 %, C/O = 0.65, Tin = 100 °C, flow rate = 10NL/min.
As presented in Fig. 8, the overall reaction process was practically complete within 10 mm, i.e. less than half of the coated length, and a close approach to equilibrium was reached. as revealed by the flattening of all the concentration profiles. It is worth mentioning that the compositions of the product stream measured downstream from the reactor were slightly different from those measured at the end of the monolith but within the central channel; in fact, integral measurements of composition revealed that ethanol was not completely converted. For instance, 96 % conversion of ethanol was measured downstream from the reactor in the water-free experiment (Fig. 6), while total conversion was measured at the end of the catalytic channel by the sampling system (Fig. 8). This can be explained by the cup-mixing effect that has been already observed in previous studies by Livio et al. [28]; where the outer channels may be colder due to some residual heat dispersion of the system and the kinetic limitations affect the efficiency of steam reforming reactions. The effect is more evident for the byproducts whose downstream cup-mix concentration is nonzero. The molar fractions of all the species measured throughout the reactor's axial coordinate as well as the values measured downstream the reactor are presented in Fig. 8, Fig. 9.
H2O co-feed, as presented in Fig. 8, seems to have no effect on the molar fraction profiles of the reactants, C2H5OH and O2. However, on increasing the water concentration in the feed, a significant increase of the H2 concentration and a drop of the CO concentration were observed, which is likely associated with an increased extent of the water gas shift reaction, resulting also in higher concentration of CO2. The spatial profiles obtained for H2O showed an initial production of H2O in the oxidation zone followed by a progressive consumption downstream resulting in net H2O production except for the test performed with 10 % H2O co-feed, where a net consumption was observed. Fig. 8 shows the effect of H2O co-feed in the concentration profiles of the byproducts of the process. Acetaldehyde was observed before the catalyst inlet, in line with previous studies [28] where the required temperature to onset the gas phase reactions was reached by heat radiation from the frontal face of the monolith. H2O co-feed seems to have no effect on this phenomenon or on the axial concentration profile of the acetaldehyde.
Focusing on the other byproducts the increase of H2O content limited their formation which could be correlated to the capability of water in quenching the gas phase reaction reducing the production of these species and/or the promotion of the local reaction rates towards syngas. The presence of these species, although for very short times, could have an impact on the formation of C-species on the surface.
3.4. Effect of H2O co-feed on the catalyst stability: T-profiles in reference CH4-CPO tests
The limited intensity of the hot spot in ethanol CPO (the maximum solid phase temperature for the H2O co-feed tests did not exceed 850 °C) suggests that major sintering does not occur during the experiments. However, the stability of the catalyst was verified in a more stringent way by periodically repeating a standard CH4 CPO tests during which axial temperature profiles (with both the pyrometer and the thermocouple) and integral outlet composition were measured. The CH4 CPO tests were performed after each ethanol experiment. Panels A and B of Fig. 10 present the profiles measured by the pyrometer and thermocouple in between the experiments with water co-feed, for a total time on stream of about 50 h. After such a time frame, the growth of a hot spot in CH4 CPO was distinctly observed, but it remained below 800 °C both on the surface and in the gas-phase.

As recalled above, the hot spot is formed as a result of the superposition of the exothermic oxidation and endothermic steam reforming process. The catalyst deactivation has no effect on the released heat flux, since the rate of O2 consumption reactions is extremely high and entirely governed by mass transfer; instead, catalyst deactivation limits the reaction rate of CH4 steam reforming, thus the heat consumption term, being it under partial chemical kinetic control. Some loss of activity was thus experienced by the catalyst during the 50 h of time on steam in ethanol CPO conditions.
The same experiments were performed in the absence of water co-feed. The results of temperature measurement in analogous periodic CH4 CPO tests is reported in the panels C and D of Fig. 10 (solid phase and gas phase profiles, respectively). A much more pronounced growth of temperatures was measured at the reactor entrance and the hot spot temperature close to 900 °C were registered after about 35 h on stream in dry ethanol CPO conditions. Thus, a process of catalyst deactivation accompanied the dry ethanol CPO campaign.
Coke deposition was believed a possible source of surface deactivation and was verified by TPO analyses of the unloaded catalysts.
3.5. TPO analyses
In order to characterize quantitatively and qualitatively the carbonaceous structures formed on the aged catalysts, the spent catalytic monoliths used in the H2O co-feed and the dry experiments were subject to temperature programmed oxidation (TPO). Here, for each monolith, a sample from each of the three segments, presented in Fig. 11 and Table 3, was oxidized in air monitoring the amount of CO2 produced up to 700 °C as previously explained.

The TPO profiles are reported in Fig. 12 and the integral data on C quantification are reported in Table 4. By examining the molar flow rates of the CO2 released for each catalyst (accounting for the catalyst loading) as a function of temperature, both systems showed two peaks of CO2 production for the three samples. The first peak was at about 280 °C and, based on the literature, can be correlated with the oxidation of relatively non-structured carbon and/or carbon deposited on the catalytic sites, accelerating the deactivation process. On the other hand, the second peak of carbon oxidation was found at 580 °C and can be correlated with the gasification of relatively more complex carbon structures and/or carbon located on the acidic sites of the support, far from the Rh sites [38].

From Table 4, it is possible to observe that the total amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst tested under the dry conditions (NE6) is higher than that deposited on the catalyst tested under water co-feed (NE5) even though NE5 monolith was kept onstream for a time period 50 % longer than NE6 catalyst (51.5 h for NE5 vs. 34.5 h for NE6). Additionally, the obtained results for the dry ethanol experiments show that the amount of carbon deposited on the first segment (Oxy-Reforming Zone) is significantly higher than the second and the third segments which is contradicting with our previous experience with i-octane and n-octane CPO [39].
H2O co-feed apparently suppressed significantly the formation of carbon deposits at the entrance of the monolith and diminished the intensity of the lower temperature CO2-peak at the very beginning of the monolith. This effect can be associated with the reduced molar concentrations of the cracking by-products observed in the axial concentration profile experiments performed with water co-feed with respect to the dry experiments; both lower concentration of ethylene in the gas phase and lower concentration of surface carbon species suggest improved steam reforming and gasification reactions.
3.5.1. Hypotheses on carbon formation mechanism
Although the a-priori global thermodynamic analysis predicted no formation of solid carbon for the selected working conditions, the TPO analyses revealed the accumulation of carbon species on the surface of both tested catalysts. An a-posteriori local analysis was performed to evaluate the thermodynamic potential towards solid carbon formation considering the actual gas-phase temperature and gas-phase composition measured along the reactor axis.
The existence of a thermodynamically feasible route to C formation was thus verified. For simplicity we herein take the reaction of methane cracking (Eq. 9) as representative route to C. The approach to equilibrium of the reaction was evaluated through the reaction quotient KP/KEQ (Eq. 10).

As reported in Fig. 13, values below 1 were found at the reactor inlet for the three experiments, where methane formation was detected; a thermodynamic potential to methane cracking is thus present. Such a driving force is mitigated in the water co-feed experiments (Kp/Keq closer to 1), which was in fact accompanied by growing H2 concentrations and decreasing CH4 concentrations.

Although a more comprehensive analysis including at least a C removing step, e.g. via gasification: C+ H2O ⟶ CO + H2, shows that the presence of C is not thermodynamically favored, still the existence of a chemical potential for the formation route opens the possibility that an unbalance between rate of formation and rate of consumption of surface C species can kinetically control the effective accumulation of C.
It seems also reasonable that at increasing H2O concentration, the kinetic factors become less favorable to C accumulation.
4. Conclusion
CPO experiments with ethanol/air/N2 and ethanol/air/water/N2 mixtures were performed over Rh-coated honeycomb monoliths. In the presence of H2O, the integral performance was characterized by close approach to thermodynamic equilibrium with complete conversion of reactants and improved selectivity to syngas.
The use of the axially resolved, in-situ sampling technique allowed to investigate the effect of H2O co-feed more deeply. Experiments performed with H2O co-feed showed a more rapid formation of H2 at the catalyst inlet resulting in higher H2/CO ratio due to the increased extent of the water gas shift reaction. Despite the substantially unchanged thermal behavior, a significant drop of the cracking species such as CH4 and C2H4 was detected in the initial part of the reactor. This suggests a promotion of the consecutive reactions of steam reforming of these hydrocarbon species on the catalyst surface. Besides, the presence of these species, although limited at very short contact times, could have an impact on the formation of carbon species on the surface of the monolith, leading to the deactivation of the catalyst.
A local thermodynamic analysis considering the actual gas-phase temperature and gas-phase composition measured along the reactor axis verified the existence of a thermodynamically feasible route to C formation via the cracking of the byproducts of the process. C formation was evaluated by performing temperature programmed oxidation analyses over samples of aged catalyst, scanning different zones of the monoliths, representative of the oxy-reforming, and the reforming zones; thus, in a way, an axial resolution of the surface C-content was also obtained. Lower amount of carbon had deposited on the catalyst tested with water co-feeding compared with the other catalyst tested with dry ethanol in this study. The stability of the catalyst was found to be much higher with the co-feed of water, and this is evident from the limited growth of the hot spot temperature in the reference methane CPO tests time on-stream.
H2O co-feed appears to be a promising strategy for improving the stability of Rh catalysts under an autothermal fuel processing conditions.
