Abstract
A series of carbon-supported CuCo oxide catalysts (Cu-Co/C) were prepared via the combination methods of impregnation and pyrolysis using Co-doped Cu-based metal organic framework (Cu3(BTC)2·3H2O, Cu-BTC) precursor. Physicochemical properties of prepared catalysts were characterized by using various technologies and toluene was chosen as the probe molecule to evaluate their catalytic performance. Results revealed that the successive calcination in Ar and air was conducive to the formation of 3D porous carbon matrix and homogeneous elemental dispersion. The Cu-Co/C catalysts with spinel structure exhibited higher catalytic activity than that of Cu-500/C material. Moreover, CuCo0.5/C material exhibited superior catalytic durability and water resistance in catalytic oxidation of toluene. The excellent catalytic performance of CuCo0.5/C was mainly related to large specific surface area, high amounts of surface chemisorbed active oxygen and high ratio of Co2+/Co3+.

1. Introduction
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as the main air pollutants have been attracted more and more attention owing to their tremendous hazardous to the environment and the human health [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. Among various strategies proposed for VOCs elimination, the catalytic oxidation of VOCs into harmless CO2 and H2O has been highlighted as one of the most effective and economical pathways due to its low-energy consumption and less harmful reaction by-products [6,7]. A variety of catalysts including noble metal-based catalysts and transition metal oxides are utilized to remove VOCs with different catalytic performances [[8], [9], [10]]. Although noble metal-based materials exhibit outstanding performance for catalytic removal of VOCs at low temperature, their susceptibly poisoning and high cost have limited their widely applications [5,[11], [12], [13], [14], [15]]. Therefore, transition metal oxides have been considered as the alternative for VOCs oxidation due to their relatively low cost, superior reducibility and anti-poisoning ability [9,[16], [17], [18], [19]]. Among, Cu has some interesting physicochemical properties because of its 3d electronic configuration [16]. Cu-based materials can promote a variety of reactions in broad applications including catalytic organic transformations [9,20], preferential CO oxidation (or CO removal from water-gas shift reaction) [21,22] and NH3-SCR [23], mainly due to their accessible oxidation states and high redox potential [16]. Previous studies reported that Cu-based catalysts also displayed superior catalytic performance in the removal of VOCs [[24], [25], [26]]. For instance, Cu/γ-Al2O3 catalyst has higher catalytic activity in toluene oxidation than that of Me/γ-Al2O3 (Me = Mn, Fe, V, Mo, Co, Ni, and Zn). The toluene conversion of Cu/γ-Al2O3 was 90% but others were much <90% at 320 °C, which was due to the well-dispersed copper surface phase on the γ-Al2O3 [25]. Four different metal oxides (CuO, CoOx, FeOx, NiO) supported carbon materials were prepared and found that CuO/activated carbon with the lowest reduction temperature exhibited the best catalytic performance for toluene elimination [26].
Moreover, the intrinsic activity of mixed oxide catalysts (e.g., spinel-based, hydrotalcite-based, cordierite-based, hexaaliminate-based, and perovskite-based materials) also plays an important role in determining their catalytic performance in VOC elimination [27]. Among these catalysts, spinel-based catalysts have attracted much attention because of their excellent catalytic stability and low cost [27,28]. Some studies have been reported that the CuCo spinel materials are efficient catalysts for VOC degradation [27,29,30]. Zhang et al. found that spinel MCo2O4 (M = Co, Ni, and Cu) hollow mesoporous spheres exhibited high catalytic activity in total oxidation of acetone and their catalytic activities followed the sequence of CuCo2O4 > NiCo2O4 > CoCo2O4 [27]. Kim and co-workers proposed that the ordered mesoporous spinel MCo2O4 (M = Ni, Zn, and Cu) catalysts exhibited excellent catalytic activity in methane oxidation and their catalytic activities ranked in the sequence of CuCo2O4 > ZnCo2O4 > NiCo2O4 [29]. Binh et al. claimed that the nano-spinel CuCo2O4 catalyst had higher catalytic activity than that of MnCo2O4 and NiCo2O4 in total oxidation of toluene [30].
In addition to the intrinsic activity, the supports of catalysts including activated carbon [31], Al2O3 [32], zeolite [33], SiO2 [7] also play the critical role in determining the catalytic activity for VOC elimination. The support provides a large surface area over which active sites are dispersed efficiently that can prevent particle aggregation. Furthermore, the support can also provide enough space for proceeding the catalytic reaction. It is found that the catalysts derived from metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have enhanced their structure and active site properties that can promote catalytic activity for VOC oxidation [34,35]. The organic ligands in MOFs transformed into 3D porous carbon matrix and nanoparticles (metal or metal oxide) wrapped with carbon can be obtained by pyrolysing the MOF precursors directly. Therefore, the 3D porous carbon matrix is conducive to the distribution of element. Although catalysts derived from MOFs can effectively catalytic oxidation of VOCs, the catalytic activity of monometallic catalysts derived from MOFs such as Cr2O3-M [34], Co3O4-MOF [36] was lower than that of the bimetallic catalysts derived from MOFs as MnOx/Cr2O3 [34], Ru/Co3O4-MOFs [36] and MnOxCeO2 [37].
The Cu-BTC as precursor for synthesizing of catalysts has been investigated for catalytic oxidation of CO and selective catalytic reduction of NO with NH3 [23,38], but its applications in VOCs degradation are scarcely reported. The preparation of Cu-BTC was very facile and the Cu-BTC precursor can provide both the support and the active substance, which possess a large number of copper sites, providing it with powerful catalytic performance in low temperature range [39]. Herein, a series of Cu-Co/C catalysts with different Co/Cu molar ratios were prepared via the combination methods of impregnation and pyrolysis using Co-doped Cu-BTC as the precursor. The physicochemical property and catalytic performance of all prepared materials were extensively studied. CuCoo.5/C exhibited the best catalytic activity and excellent water vapor resistance and long-term stability. This study will provide a promising strategy for catalytic oxidation of VOCs based on MOF precursor.
2. Experimental
2.1. Chemicals
1,3,5-benzene tri-carboxylic acid (98%) was purchased from Aladdin Company (Shanghai, China). Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (99%), enthoal (≥ 99.7%) and toluene (≥ 99.5%) were supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Co(NO3)2·6H2O (≥ 99%) was purchased from Shandong Xiya Chemical Industry Co. Ltd. (Shandong, China).
2.2. Material preparation
2.2.1. Synthesis of Cu-BTC
Cu-BTC was synthesized via the solvothermal method. Typically, 0.95 g of Cu(NO3)2·3H2O was dissolved in 12 mL of ultra-pure water; meanwhile, 0.43 g of 1,3,5-benzene tri-carboxylic acid was dissolved in 12 mL of ethanol. These solutions were mixed and stirred for 30 min, and then transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and heated at 120 °C for 12 h. After cooling naturally to room temperature, the product was separated by centrifugation and washed by ethanol and water for several times and then dried at 80 °C overnight to obtain the Cu-BTC material.
2.2.2. Synthesis of catalysts
The Cu-BTC powder was firstly calcinated at 500 °C (1 °C/min) for 2 h in Ar stream by using tubular furnace, and then the obtained power was further calcinated at 500 °C (1 °C/min) for 2 h in air by using box furnace to obtain the Cu-500/C sample. The Cu-Co/C catalysts were obtained by thermal decomposition of Cu-BTC precursor impregnated with cobalt ions. 0.4 g of Cu-BTC powder was impregnated into 100 mL of ethanol solution contained predetermined amount of Co(NO3)2·6H2O (Co/Cu molar = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7). The mixture was stirred for 6 h and the ethanol was removed by rotary evaporator at 50 °C. The obtained powder was further dried at room temperature overnight. Afterward, the dried powder was also firstly calcinated at 500 °C (1 °C/min) for 2 h in Ar by using tubular furnace and further calcinated at 500 °C (1 °C/min) for 2 h in air by using box furnace. The obtained samples with different Co/Cu molar ratios of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 were designated as CuCo0.1/C, CuCo0.3/C, CuCo0.5/C and CuCo0.7/C, respectively. The dried powder after only calcination at 500 °C (1 °C/min) for 2 h in air by using box furnace were labeled as Cu-500/air, CuCo0.1/air, CuCo0.3/air, CuCo0.5/air and CuCo0.7/air. And the catalysts including CuCo0.1/air, CuCo0.3/air, CuCo0.5/air and CuCo0.7/air were designated as Cu-Co/air catalysts.
2.3. Catalytic performance
The catalytic oxidation of toluene was carried out in a fixed bed reactor (i.d. = 6.0 mm; length = 415 mm) equipped with a thermocouple temperature controller. In each test, 0.3 g of catalyst (40–60 mesh) was used and the total flow rate was 200 mL·min−1 (weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) = 40,000 mL·g−1·h−1). The pre-treatment was carried out under a N2 flow for 2 h, after which the gas switched to O2 and N2 mixture (O2: N2 = 1: 4) with toluene concentration of 1000 ppm. When running the catalytic test, the catalyst was heated with a heating rate of 5 °C·min−1 and kept at each temperature point for 20 min. To investigate the effect of water on the catalytic activity, 5 vol% or 10 vol% of H2O was introduced by passing the feed stream through a water saturator at a certain temperature. The effect of WHSV (20,000, 40,000, and 60,000 mL·g−1·h−1) on catalytic oxidation of toluene was further evaluated. The catalytic efficiency was monitored by analyzing the toluene concentrations in the inlet and outlet of the reactor by an on-line gas chromatograph (GC-9890) equipped with a FID detector. The conversion of toluene (Xtoluene) was calculated as Eq. (1),
(1)
where [toluene]in and [toluene]out represent the toluene concentrations in the inlet and outlet gas, respectively.
The reaction rate (r, mol·gcat−1·s−1) was calculated as Eq. (2),
(2)
where Wcat represents the catalyst weight (g); Vtoluene is the toluene gas flow rate (mol·s−1).
For kinetics studies, the oxidation of toluene under excess oxygen obeys to the first-order kinetics mechanism [34], which was calculated as Eq. (3),
(3)
where Ea, r, k and A is the apparent activation energy (kJ·mol−1), reaction rate (mol·gcat−1·s−1), rate constant (s−1) and pre-exponential factor, respectively.
2.4. Catalyst characterizations
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired with an X'Pert ProMPD diffractometer (X'Pert Pro, PANalytical B.V., Holland) with a Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) beam. The particle morphology was observed by using a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) (S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEM-2010, JEOL, Japan). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) data was measured at 77 K on a surface area and pore size analyzer (ASAP2460, Micromeritics, USA). The elemental composition and content were determined with an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) (Gene-sisXM2, EDAX, USA), Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) (5100 DV, Agilent, USA) and Elemental Analyzer (Vario max cube, Elementar, Germany). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses were tested on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (ESCALAB250, Thermo Scientific, USA) with aluminum Kα radiation. H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and O2 temperature-programmed desorption (O2-TPD) experiments were performed on a Micromeritics Autochem 2920 apparatus. For H2-TPR, the catalyst (100 mg) was pre-treated in a flow of He/Ar at 300 °C for 30 min. Then the catalyst was heated from 50 to 800 °C (10 °C·min−1) under a flow (30 mL·min−1) of 5 vol% H2/Ar with the concentration of hydrogen continuously monitored using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). For O2-TPD, 100 mg of catalyst was initially pre-treated at 300 °C for 1.0 h in Ar/He (30 mL·min−1) and then cooled to room temperature. It was pretreated for 40 min in 5 vol% O2/He (30 mL·min−1) again and removed excess O2 by Ar/He (30 mL·min−1) for 40 min. Finally it heated up to 650 °C in pure He gas (30 mL·min−1) with a heating ramp of 10 °C·min−1.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Crystal structure
The XRD patterns of Cu-BTC and prepared catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. The Cu-BTC exhibited its typical diffraction peaks, which were consistent with that reported in previous work [40]. According to the result of thermogravimetric analysis for Cu-BTC, the totally decomposition of organic framework in Ar was observed at a temperature above 350 °C [23]. During this process, the organic part of Cu-BTC was converted into amorphous carbon because of the carbonization reaction. Meanwhile, the copper ions could be reduced into copper nanoparticles by carbon. In this study, the copper was oxidized into CuO nanoparticles again when the sample was calcinated in air at 500 °C. Therefore, the MOF structure completely disappeared after calcination and only new species of CuO appeared. The diffraction peaks with 2θ of 35.5°, 38.7°, 48.7°, 53.5°, 58.3°, 61.5°, 65.8°, 67.9°, 72.4° and 75.0° corresponded to the (002), (111), (202), (020), (202), (113), (022), (113), (311), and (004) reflections of CuO, respectively (PDF # 45-0937) [41]. With the doping of cobalt, some new diffraction peaks appeared. The diffraction peaks of catalysts at 2θ of 19.0°, 31.3°, 36.9°, 44.8°, 59.3° and 65.2° could be well identified as the (111), (220), (311), (400), (511) and (440) planes of the CuCo spinel metal oxides (CuxCo3-xO4) [27,42], which could improve the catalytic performance [43]. The intensity of CuxCo3-xO4 peaks increased with the increasing of cobalt content.

3.2. Micromorphology
Fig. 2 shows the FE-SEM images of prepared materials. Cu-BTC had a typical octahedral structure with a very smooth surface, similar to previous literature [44]. The size of octahedral crystallite was about 18 μm. The Cu-Co/C catalysts were prepared by two steps of calcinations in different atmospheres that were beneficial to maintain the original shape of Cu-BTC. Although Cu-500/C catalyst retained the same octahedron shape and size, the surface of the octahedron shape became porous, indicating that the 3D porous carbon matrix was formed after the thermal annealing process. After doping of cobalt, the number of small particles on the surface increased with the increasing of Co content. Especially for the CuCo0.7/C catalyst with the largest of Co content, the larger particles appeared on the surface with a compact aggregation of many interconnected particles. These particles belonged to spinel cubic metal oxides that were formed by a drastic reaction of copper and cobalt during the calcination process at high temperature according to the XRD results (Fig. 1). Moreover, take CuCo0.5/C as an example, the presence of nanocrystal with different sizes in the catalyst was confirmed by TEM image (Fig. 2). As shown in HRTEM image of CuCo0.5/C, the lattice fringes of 0.232 nm could be indexed to the (111) crystal planes of CuO [45] and the lattice fringes of 0.467 nm could be assigned to (111) crystal planes of CuxCo3-xO4, which were consistent with the result of XRD analysis. As shown in Fig. 2, the homogeneous dispersion of elemental components for all catalysts was confirmed by elemental mapping. The 3D porous carbon matrix retained the same shape as that of the Cu-BTC, which could improve the catalytic activity. The Co/Cu ratios measured by EDS and ICP-OES are documented in Table 1. It indicated that the Co/Cu ratios of prepared catalysts were basically consistent with the theoretical values in the process of preparing the catalysts. The contents of carbon in the catalysts were in the range of 33.9–46.2 wt% (Table 1), which proved that carbon as a support existed in the catalyst. Moreover, the FE-SEM images of Cu-500/air and Cu-Co/air catalysts showed that only calcination in air led to evident collapse into various sizes of particles. It indicated that the pyrolysis directly in air was very violent. However, the carbon was still existed in the Cu-500/air and Cu-Co/air catalysts, and the contents of carbon were in the range of 32.7–46.8 wt%. Obviously, the successive pyrolysis in Ar and air was mild, which was conducive to the formation of 3D porous carbon matrix.

3.3. Structural property
Fig. 3 shows the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms and pore size distribution of prepared materials. All the catalysts exhibited irreversible type-IV nitrogen sorption isotherms with H3-hysteresis loops in relative pressure (P/P0) of 0.5–1.0, suggesting that these catalysts were mesoporous materials [46,47]. The specific surface area, pore volume and pore diameter of all catalysts are shown in Table 1. The specific surface area of all catalysts derived from Cu-BTC precursor decreased a lot due to loss of their organic network after calcination compared to that of origin Cu-BTC. The specific surface area and pore volume increased with the increasing of Co content and CuCo0.5/C achieved the maximum point. The increase in specific surface area could be realized owing to the increase in a large fraction of mesopores. According to the FE-SEM results, larger particles appeared on the surface of CuCo0.7/C with a compact aggregation, which could explain its decrease in specific surface area and pore volume compared to that of CuCo0.5/C material.

3.4. Surface chemical status
The influence of addition of different contents of Co on chemical state of catalysts was investigated by XPS. Fig. 4a shows the O1s XPS spectra of Cu-Co/C catalysts. The peak at the lowest binding energy of 529.9 eV could be attributed to the lattice oxygen species (Olatt) [48]. The peak at binding energy of 531.5 eV was assigned to the surface chemisorbed active oxygen species (Oads) [49]. The peak at binding energy of 532.3 eV had been reported as residual carbon species O-C-O-C- and absorbed oxygen species from surface hydroxyl or adsorbed water species (Ow) [50]. The Oads/Olatt molar ratios were determined based on the area fitted curve peaks of O 1 s XPS spectra and were listed in Table 1. It could be found that the Oads/Olatt decreased in the following order of CuCo0.5/C > CuCo0.7/C > CuCo0.3/C > CuCo0.1/C > Cu-500/C. CuCo0.5/C has the highest Oads/Olatt molar ratio compared with that of the other catalysts, implying more surface chemisorbed active oxygen species and oxygen vacancies within CuCo0.5/C catalyst [51]. It had been proved that excellent oxygen mobility was very important to deep oxidation of toluene [24]. Fig. 4b also shows the O1s XPS spectra of Cu-Co/air. The Oads/Olatt molar ratios of Cu-500/air, CuCo0.1/air, CuCo0.3/air, CuCo0.5/air and CuCo0.7/air were 0.27, 0.30, 0.35, 0.43 and 0.41, respectively, which were lower than those of Cu-500/C, CuCo0.1/C, CuCo0.3/C, CuCo0.5/C and CuCo0.7/C, respectively.

The Cu 2p3/2 XPS spectra of prepared catalysts are shown in Fig. 4c. The main peak of Cu 2p3/2 at 934.5 eV was attributed to Cu2+ species with their satellite peaks around 942 eV [24]. The peak of Cu 2p3/2 at 933.4 eV corresponded to reduced copper species (Cu+ and Cu0) [52,53]. The binding energies of Cu+ and Cu0 in Cu 2p were extremely close and difficult to distinguish [54]. As shown in Fig. 4d, the Cu LMM Auger lines were further investigated. The board feature of the Cu LMM Auger kinetic energy spectra consisted of two kinds of Cu species. The peaks in the Auger kinetic spectra of 917.8 and 912.9 eV corresponded to the Cu2+ and Cu+ species, respectively [52,53,[55], [56], [57], [58]]. Therefore, the peak of Cu 2p3/2 at 933.4 eV was assigned to Cu+. As shown in Table 1, the Cu2+/Cu+ molar ratios were determined based on the area fitted curve peaks of Cu 2p3/2 XPS spectra and were listed in Table 1. The proportion of Cu2+/Cu+ for CuCo0.5/C was also much higher than that of the other catalysts. More Cu2+ in the catalyst could effectively enhance the catalytic performance for the deep oxidation of toluene [24].
The Co 2p spectra of prepared catalysts are shown in Fig. 4e. Two spin-orbit doublets accompanied by shake-up satellite peaks could be observed, suggesting the presence of two cobalt species including Co2+ and Co3+ cations [59]. The main peaks of Co 2p3/2 at 779.8 eV and Co 2p1/2 at 794.8 eV were attributed to Co3+, while the peaks of Co 2p3/2 at 780.9 eV and Co 2p1/2 at 796.5 eV were assigned to Co2+ [60]. As shown in Table 1, the surface Co2+/Co3+ molar ratios varied in the range of 1.12–3.02, indicating that Co2+ was the dominant species in the catalysts. CuCo0.5/C catalyst showed a higher concentration of Co2+, which could be an indication of oxygen vacancies close to surface, corresponding to the superior intrinsic catalytic activity [61,62].
The C 1 s spectra of prepared catalysts are shown in Fig. 4f. There were two peaks: one weak peak at 288.2 eV, representing O-C=O, and an intense peak at 284.8 eV that represents the CC [63]. This result also indicated that the carbon as the support in the catalyst.
3.5. Reducibility
Fig. 5 displays the H2-TPR profiles of prepared catalysts. A shoulder at 251 °C that overlapped with a main reduction peak was observed in Cu-500/C catalyst. The shoulder could be attributed to the reduction of small CuO crystallite [64]. The strong and overlapped reduction peaks of Cu-Co/C catalysts could correspond to the reduction of Cu2+/Cu+ to Cu0 and Co3+ to Co2+ [64,65]. The main reduction peaks of Cu-Co/C catalysts were observed at 230–241 °C, which was at least 10 °C lower than that of Cu-500/C catalyst. A further shift to a lower temperature for the main reduction was observed when the cobalt content increased. It indicated the strong interaction between surface CuCo spinel and CuO, which improved the reducibility of CuO. CuCo0.5/C had the lowest reduction temperature among all Cu-Co/C catalysts. However, CuCo0.7/C exhibited the highest reduction temperature as a result of the largest metal oxide particles with the highest cobalt content. Moreover, H2-TPR profiles of CuCo catalysts exhibited a weak reduction peak in 320–550 °C, indicating the reduction of Co2+ to Co0 [65].

3.6. Oxygen species distribution
In generally, the desorption capacity of oxygen species followed the process of O2(ad) → O2−(ad) → O−(ad) → O2−(lattice) [27,66]. The different surface oxygen species over catalysts were measured by O2-TPD. As depicted in Fig. 6, the obvious peaks of prepared catalysts centered at around 95 °C corresponded to the liberation of surface physically adsorbed oxygen species (O2(ad)). The desorption peaks over all catalysts at 305, 296, 290, 278 and 288 °C for Cu-500/C, CuCo0.1/C, CuCo0.3/C, CuCo0.5/C and CuCo0.7/C were attributed to surface chemisorbed active oxygen species (O2−(ad) and O−(ad)). The surface chemisorbed active oxygen species might offer a higher catalytic activity in oxidation reactions [67]. The desorption amount of surface chemisorbed active oxygen species was calculated according to the desorption peaks over O2-TPD profiles. As shown in Table 1, the desorption amount of surface chemisorbed active oxygen species over different catalysts decreased in the order of CuCo0.5/C > CuCo0.7/C > CuCo0.3/C > CuCo0.1/C > Cu-500/C. This result indicated that CuCo0.5/C had the highest amount of surface chemisorbed active oxygen species, which was agreed with the variation in the molar ratios of Oads/Olatt obtained by O 1 s results (Fig. 4a). The desorption peaks in temperature range of 457–512 °C were assigned to the release of surface lattice oxygen species (O2−(lattice)). The relatively low onset temperature of O2– species desorbed over all catalyst reflected the mobility and/or activity of lattice oxygen [67].

3.7. Catalytic activity
Fig. 7a displays the catalytic activity of toluene oxidation over Cu-500/C, CuCo0.1/C, CuCo0.3/C, CuCo0.5/C and CuCo0.7/C materials. Obviously, toluene conversion increased with the increasing of reaction temperature. Completely toluene conversion was achieved over all catalysts below 380 °C with only CO2 and water products. Compared to the catalytic performance of Cu-500/C, the Cu-Co/C catalysts had an obvious promotion in catalytic activity of toluene oxidation. With the further increasing of Co content, the catalytic activity of CuCo0.7/C was no longer enhanced. Considering the above characterization results, more spinel CuxCo3-xO4 existed in CuCo0.7/C was not further contribute to catalytic activity because of the compact aggregation of larger particles. Furthermore, the carbon balance was higher than 99% in the inlet and outlet streams for all Cu-Co/C catalysts. According to the above results, a number of parameters, such as the surface chemisorbed active oxygen species, specific surface area, reducibility, surface Cu2+ and Co2+, are thought to affect the catalytic performance. As shown in Fig. 8a and b, the surface chemisorbed active oxygen species, surface Co2+ and specific surface area correlated positively to the toluene oxidation activity for Cu-500/C, CuCo0.1/C, CuCo0.3/C, CuCo0.5/C and CuCo0.7/C materials. The T90 of these materials for toluene oxidation increased with the decreasing of Oads/Olatt ratio, Co2+/Co3+ ratio and specific surface area, respectively. From Fig. 8c, the Cu2+/Cu+ ratio and temperature of reduction peak did not correlate to the performance of toluene oxidation. For instance, the CuCo0.7/C sample possessed a higher catalytic activity than Cu-500/C, CuCo0.1/C, CuCo0.3/C, but also exhibited the highest reduction temperature. Similarly, the T90 for toluene oxidation increased with the decreasing of Cu2+/Cu+ ratio except the T90 of CuCo0.7/C. As a result, the catalytic performances of prepared catalysts were mainly related to specific surface area, surface chemisorbed active oxygen and Co2+/Co3+ ratio.

The variation of space velocity was also performed to investigate the influence on catalytic activity of toluene oxidation over CuCo0.5/C. As shown in Fig. 7b, the catalytic activity of CuCo0.5/C decreased gradually with the increasing of WHSV from 20,000 to 60,000 mL·g−1·h−1. This distinguishing catalytic activity over CuCo0.5/C with respect to WHSV was due to the shorter contact time between toluene molecule and catalyst at higher WHSV, which reduced the catalytic activity. To conveniently compare the catalytic activities of catalysts, the values of T10, T50 and T90 were summarized in Table 2. The overall catalytic activities followed the sequence of CuCo0.5/C > CuCo0.7/C > CuCo0.3/C > CuCo0.1/C > Cu-500/C. Fig. 7c shows the catalytic activity of toluene oxidation over Cu-500/air, CuCo0.1/air, CuCo0.3/air, CuCo0.5/air and CuCo0.7/air materials, which was lower than that of Cu-Co/C catalysts. For instance, the value of T90 of Cu-500/air, CuCo0.1/air, CuCo0.3/air, CuCo0.5/air and CuCo0.7/air was 370, 314, 277, 256 and 263 °C, respectively, which was higher than that of Cu-500/C, CuCo0.1/C, CuCo0.3/C, CuCo0.5/C and CuCo0.7/C, respectively. The Oads/Olatt molar ratio was one of the important factors in the catalytic reaction. Therefore, the low amounts of surface chemisorbed active oxygen of Cu-Co/air and Cu-500/air led to low catalytic performance.

Therefore, 3D porous carbon matrix of Cu-Co/C catalysts improved the catalytic activity. The catalytic activities of representative CuCo based catalysts for toluene oxidation were summarized in Table 3. Obviously, the catalytic activity of CuCo0.5/C was much better than the reported catalysts except the 53Cu26Co oxide material probably due to its much lower toluene concentration and space velocity. Especially, although the specific surface area (297 m2/g) of 40%(Cu0.25Co0.75)/SBA-15 was much larger than that of CuCo0.5/C, its catalytic activity was lower than that of CuCo0.5/C. It could also be concluded that the 3D porous carbon matrix of CuCo0.5/C improved the catalytic activity.

The reaction rate was much more persuasive to clarify the intrinsic activity of a catalyst. As shown in Fig. 7d, the order of reaction rates was consistent with the catalytic activity. The CuCo0.5/C material displayed better catalytic performance than that of the other catalysts. Especially, as shown in Table 2, the reaction rate of CuCo0.5/C was 23 times higher than that of Cu-500/C at 240 °C. The apparent activation energy (Ea) was also introduced to compare the catalytic activity of catalysts, as the catalyst with a lower Ea value would facilitate toluene oxidation more readily. Arrhenius plots derived from the formula (Eq. (3)) at low toluene conversion (< 10%) were adopted, which was not influenced by materials migration or phase change. As shown in Fig. 7e and Table 2, the Ea values increased as follows: CuCo0.5/C < CuCo0.7/C < CuCo0.3/C < CuCo0.1/C < Cu-500/C. CuCo0.5/C exhibited the best catalytic activity for toluene oxidation with the lowest Ea value.
3.8. Catalytic stability
Since CuCo0.5/C had the best catalytic activity among all synthesized catalysts, it was selected as a model catalyst for further stability test. The results of time-on-stream reaction experiment are shown in Fig. 9a. The performance of toluene oxidation was stable during two times circulation with the time-on-stream reaction for 10 h in between, which illustrated that the heating and cooling processes had a negligible impact on CuCo0.5/C material and demonstrated its good catalytically durability. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 9b, the conversions of toluene could be well-maintained at around 90% and 50% with the time-on-stream reaction for 40 h. The presence of water vapor in environment had been known to exert a great influence on catalytic activity of a catalyst for VOC oxidation in practical applications. The long-term durability tests of CuCo0.5/C under dry and humid conditions had been studied. As shown in Fig. 9c, the toluene conversion was about 100% at 265 °C without water vapor. When 5 vol% H2O was introduced into the reaction system, the toluene conversion slightly decreased to about 95% during the activity test for 10 h. Subsequently, the toluene conversion decreased from 100% to 90% with the addition of higher concentration (10 vol%) of water vapor. Once the water vapor was stopped, the catalytic activity could rapidly return to its original level. Thus, the water vapor in the reaction system indeed caused a deactivation of CuCo0.5/C for the catalytic oxidation of toluene owing to the competitive adsorption of toluene and water molecules on the surface active sites. However, the CuCo0.5/C had a superior stability and tolerance in the presence of water vapor compared with that of other catalysts in the previous studies [4,34]. As shown in Fig. 9d, the used CuCo0.5/C catalysts after stability tests were determined by XRD, which showed that the used CuCo0.5/C materials kept the same intensity of characteristic Bragg peaks as that of the fresh one, suggesting that both CuCo spinel and CuO were very stable. This result was responsible for the good stability of CuCo0.5/C.

3.9. Proposed reaction mechanism
The Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism is used to illustrate the oxidation process of toluene [68]. The adsorbed toluene and surface chemisorbed active oxygen played a significant role in the catalytic reaction. The oxidation process of toluene was divided into two parts. In the first step, the adsorbed toluene reacted with surface chemisorbed active oxygen in the catalyst, which led to the reduction of the metal oxide. In the second step, the reduced metal oxide was oxidized again by oxygen in the gas phase. As a result, the toluene was catalytic oxidized in the progress of reduction and oxidization. Therefore, the oxidation and reduction sites played an important role in the catalytic performance from the reaction mechanism. The cycle of redox must be accompanied by the change of metal valence in the catalysts, which had been further studied by the following analysis.
According to the above result, the surface chemisorbed active oxygen, Co2+/Co3+ ratio and specific surface area were the main factors that greatly affected catalytic performance. Fig. 10 shows the XPS comparison of the fresh and used CuCo0.5/C. As shown in Table 1, there was an obvious increase in the proportion of Co2+/Co3+ and a decrease in the ratio of Cu2+/Cu+. This was the result of bimetallic synergy that led to the redox reaction. However, there was no much change of surface chemisorbed active oxygen, which also indicated that CuCo0.5/C had a good stability. In addition, large specific surface area of CuCo0.5/C contributed to more exposed metal sites. Therefore, all these factors promoted the catalytic reaction according to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism.

4. Conclusions
In this work, Cu-Co/C catalysts had been successfully synthesized through pyrolysis of Co-doped Cu-BTC precursor at 500 °C by successive calcination in Ar and air. The 3D porous carbon matrix with homogeneous dispersion of element was formed for all prepared catalysts after the thermal annealing process. Both the reaction rate and catalytic activity increased as CuCo0.5/C > CuCo0.7/C > CuCo0.3/C > CuCo0.1/C > Cu-500/C. Moreover, the CuCo0.5/C had a good stability and tolerance in the presence of water vapor. The catalytic performance of CuCo0.5/C was much better than that of other catalysts because of large specific surface area, more surface chemisorbed active oxygen species and high ratio of Co2+/Co3+.
