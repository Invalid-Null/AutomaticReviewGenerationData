 Unfortunately, this document does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation, as it focuses on the conversion of ethylene to propylene. The catalyst Ni(0.1)/deAl-Beta that is discussed utilizes ethylene as the feed and does not involve propane conversion. While propane dehydrogenation is mentioned briefly in the introduction, the scientific contributions of this work do not pertain to propane conversion.
