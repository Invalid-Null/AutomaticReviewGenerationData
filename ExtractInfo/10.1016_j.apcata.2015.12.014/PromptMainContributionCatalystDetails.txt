1. Introduction
Acrylonitrile is industrially produced by the catalytic ammoxidation of propylene also known as SOHIO process [1]. In 2013, worldwide production of acrylonitrile reported as 6 million tons from propylene/propane [2]. Poly acrylonitrile is the major component of several industrial textile fibers synthesized from acrylonitrile monomers. It is also copolymerized with vinyl chloride to produce a wool like fibers which are used for blankets and sweaters. The future global demand-supply gap cannot be fulfilled by acrylonitrile-propylene based process alone due to the price increase of propylene feed-stock. Alternative feed stock based acrylonitrile synthesis can help to accomplish the upcoming demands for acrylonitrile fiber. Propane is more abundant and less expensive feed-stock compared to propylene, which can be directly converted into acrylonitrile by catalytic ammoxidation process [3], [4], [5], [6]. An efficient catalyst composition is necessary to achieve acrylonitrile in useful yields from propane. Principally, two types of catalyst compositions are reported in the literature on propane ammoxidation (i) Mo–V–Nb–Te–O (ii) V–Sb–W/Al2O3. In the present study, our focus is on complex V–Sb–W/Al2O3 catalyst for propane ammoxidation. Further, the propane ammoxidation performance of V–Sb catalyst was improved by using excess amount of antimony oxide which, exists as Sb2O4 in the final catalyst [7].
Nilsson et al. [8], [9] extensively studied V–Sb, V–Sb–Al and V–Sb–W/Al2O3 catalysts for propane ammoxidation reaction. According to the authors, propane adsorption followed by dehydrogenation to propylene and subsequent nitrogen insertion step to form acrylonitrile takes place on V-sites. Addition of Al and Sb primarily isolate V-sites to a suitable degree to avoid degradation of propane, propylene and ammonia. And incorporation of W tunes the V-sites in a direction that helps to improve the acrylonitrile formation. These authors [8] further reported rutile type of Sb(V,W)O4 active phase for V1.0–Sb5.0–W1.0/50%Al2O3 catalyst in propane ammoxidation. Recently, Mamedov studied the propane ammoxidation on W doped V–Sb/Al catalyst. According to the author the improved ACN selectivity was due to the higher adsorption ability for NH3 on W–V–Sb/Al surface compared to V–Sb/Al [10]. Centi et al. [11] have studied the propane ammoxidation on VO2P2O7, V–Ti mixed oxide, V–Sb and Fe–Sb catalysts. They found high activity and ACN selectivity on vanadium phosphate and vanadium antimonite catalysts. Mikolajska et al. [12] have studied the vanadium phosphorus mixed oxides supported on Al2O3 for propane ammoxidation. The authors attributed the high activity of VPO to V+5 site stability and tuned acid-base properties on Al2O3 support. Bilde et al. [13] described the catalytic behavior of thermally induced Sb2O3 spread on V/Al catalyst in the propane ammoxidation and the greater acrylonitrile selectivity was endorsed to V–Al–SbO4 rutile phase. Therefore, all the above studied catalysts in the propane ammoxidation showed the significant role of Al as an element in the active phase and/or as a support. Accordingly, catalysts of different performance can be obtained depending on the type of alumina precursor used. Thus, it is essential to study the characteristics and performance of V–Sb–W/Al2O3 catalyst obtained through different alumina precursors for propane ammoxidation.
Vanadium and molybdenum sites can be isolated to a certain extent by incorporation of phosphorous (P) and P also improves the acidity moderately which intern minimizes the complete oxidation of propane using VPO and V–Mo–P–O [10], [11], [12], [14] catalysts. Keeping this in mind, in the present work, the influence of phosphorous addition and Al2O3 prepared from different alumina precursor on V–Sb–W phase was examined with the catalyst composition of V1.0–Sb3.5–P0.5–W1.0/50% Al2O3. The preparation method and the V–P–Sb–W atomic composition was adopted from the US patent obtained by Brazdil and Guttmann [7]. The physico-chemical characteristics of these catalysts was analyzed by BET-pore size method, XRD, NH3-TPD-mass, XPS and HAADF-EDS techniques and correlated to propane ammoxidation activity and acrylonitrile selectivity.
2. Experimental
2.1. Reagents
Ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3, assay ≥ 98%), antimony oxide (Sb2O3, assay ≥ 99%), Aluminum hydroxide dried gel (Al(OH)3), ammonium tungstate ((NH4)2WO4, assay ≥ 99.99%), di ammonium hydrogen phosphate ((NH4)2HPO4, assay ≥ 99%), Aluminum chloride (AlCl3·6H2O, assay ≥ 99%), ammonia solution (NH4OH, 30 wt.%) and Nitric acid (HNO3 60%) were purchased from ACROS chemical suppliers and used without further purification. The preparation method and the V–P–Sb–W atomic composition was adopted from the US patent obtained by Brazdil and Guttmann [7].
2.2. Catalyst preparation A
V–Sb–P–W (1:3.5:0.5:1 atomic ratio) containing 50% Al2O3 produced from aluminum hydroxide dry gel precursor (this considered as a base catalyst).
Step-1: 3.81 g of ammonium metavanadate was dissolved in 90.0 cm3 of hot (80 °C) deionized water and followed by the addition of 16.6 g of Sb2O3 to this solution. The resulting slurry was refluxed for 17 h under continuous stirring. The color of the mixture turned to gray-green.
Step-2: 47.88 g of aluminum hydroxide (dried gel) was added to 140.0 cm3 of 10% acetic acid and stirred for 3 h to form a homogeneous suspension. The suspension was kept under continuous stirring for 3 h. No gelling was observed. The pH of the slurry recorded as 6.0.
Step-3: 9.23 g of ammonium tungstate was dissolved partially in 20 cm3 of deionized water and to this 5 cm3 of di ammonium hydrogen phosphate (2.15 g) solution was added.
The slurry obtained from step-1 was slowly added to step-3 solution under continuous stirring. Later, the step-2 suspension was added to this solution quickly under continuous stirring. The excess water was evaporated under continuous stirring on a preheated oil bath at 120 °C. The resultant solid was dried in a preheated oven at 120 °C overnight in static air.
2.3. Preparation B
V–Sb–P–W (1:3.5:0.5:1 atomic ratio) containing 50% Al2O3 produced from aluminum chloride precursor.
Aluminum chloride was used instead of aluminum hydroxide (dry gel) in step-2 and reaming procedure was identical to preparation A.
Step-2: 47.8 g of AlCl3·6H2O was dissolved in 2.5 m3 of deionized water. In another beaker 77.0 cm3 of 12N ammonia solution was diluted with deionized water to 500 cm3 and quickly added to the AlCl3 solution under continuous stirring. As formed white gelatinous precipitate (pH 8.0) was aged for overnight. The resultant precipitate was separated by means of filtration and washed thoroughly with deionized water to remove the Cl− ions. Further, 47.0 cm3 of 10% acetic acid solution was added to the gel and the remaining steps were identical to preparation A.
2.4. Preparation C
V–Sb–P–W (1:3.5:0.5:1 atomic ratio) containing 50% Al2O3 produced from aluminum nitrate (aluminum hydroxide dry gel + HNO3) precursor.
Synthesized, aluminum nitrate was used instead of aluminum hydroxide (dry gel) in step-2 and reaming procedure was identical to preparation A.
One hundred and forty cubic centimeter of 60% HNO3 was added to 48 g aluminum hydroxide (dried gel) and the resulting solution temperature was maintained at 80 °C under continues stirring until the color of the solution turns to clear yellow which, is indicative of aluminum nitrate formation. Here, the resultant solution was weakly acidic (pH 5.0) due to the presence of excess HNO3. The remaining steps were identical to preparation A.
Further, the powder samples were pelletized and sieved to 0.5–2.0 mm size and calcined at 350 °C, 5 h followed by 610 °C for 3 h under static air conditions.
For example, V–Sb–P–W (1:3.5:0.5:1 atomic ratio) containing 50% Al2O3 catalyst produced from aluminum hydroxide (dry gel) precursor denoted as AlH, likewise, for aluminum chloride precursor as AlC and aluminum nitrate precursor as AlN.
2.5. Catalyst characterization
The BET surface area and pore size distribution of calcined samples used in the present study were determined by using Quantachrome Nova Station adsorption equipment at liquid nitrogen temperature after out gassing the samples at 200 °C under the flow of N2 for 2 h.
The X-ray patterns of the samples used in the present study were obtained on a EQUINOX 1000 inel XRD instrument using Co Kα = 1.7902 Å with X-ray source generator settings at 40 kV and 30 mA and real time acquisition for 2θ = 110°. The FTIR analysis of calcined AlN, AlH and AlC samples were performed on a Bruker Vertex 70/70 v FTIR spectrometer using a KBr pellet method.
High angle angular dark field (HAADF)-scanning transmission microscopy (STEM) and energy dispersive X-ray (EDS) analysis with focused/parallel beam results of calcined samples were collected on Tecnai 200 kV D1234 SuperTwin microscope with camera length of 97 cm.
Ammonia Temperature Programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) experiments were conducted on ChemBET Pulsar Automatic Chemisorption Analyzer (Quantachrome Instrument). Mass analysis was performed using ThermoStar™ GSD 320 quad core mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer, Germany). The typical mass fragments input as follows: m/z = 16 (NH2), m/z = 17 (NH3), m/z = 18 (H2O), m/z = 28(N2), m/z = 30 (NO) and m/z = 44(N2O). In a typical experiment, catalyst sample of 100 mg was placed in a quartz cell and pretreated at 200 °C in He flow (10 cm3 min−1) for 2 h. Subsequently, the temperature of the sample was brought to 50 °C and saturated with 5 vol.% NH3-N2 for 1 h. Eventually, the sample was flushed with He flow (10 cm3 min−1) for 1 h. Desorption of probe gas was performed over the temperature range of 50–600 °C at a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1.The desorption stream was analyzed simultaneously using a TCD and mass detector by means of an automated split valve.
XPS results of calcined samples in a tablet form was collected on SPECS GmbH high vaccum multi-technique surface analysis system equipped with Al-monochromatic X-ray source. The charge neutralization was done with low angle energy electron flood gun. The reported result was based on C1s reference at 285.0 eV.
2.6. Propane ammoxidation procedure
Propane ammoxidation was performed in a 12.7 mm quartz reactor with wall thickness 1.13 mm. 4.6 g of catalyst with particle size 0.5–2.0 mm was charged between the two layers of quartz wool in the middle of the reactor. The bed height was about 8 cm. Quartz thermo well with 6.35 mm was inserted axially through the catalyst bed from the bottom of the reactor to monitor the reactor temperature. Another thermocouple was inserted from the top of the reactor to monitor the inlet feed temperature. Catalytic tests were performed in the temperature range of 490–530 °C at the total feed flow rate of 100 SCCM with W/F = 2.8 gcat s ml−1 (STP). The feed composition with 19.11% oxygen, 12.74% ammonia and 6.37% propane balanced helium was studied under the reaction conditions. All the connections leading and leaving from the reactor was maintained at 250 °C to avoid the condensation of acrylonitrile polymer. Blank tests were also performed under similar reaction conditions.
The product stream was analyzed by HP 6890 GC equipped with FID and TCD detectors with single oven programming. Non hydrocarbons of 1 ml injection volume (O2, N2, N2O, CO, CO2, NH3 and H2O) were analyzed by TCD equipped with Molseive and Porapak N columns with 10 port GSV control column reversal technique. Hydrocarbons of 0.25 ml injection volume (methane, ethane, ethylene, propylene, propane, acetonitrile, acrylonitrile, acrolein and acrylic acid) were analyzed using FID equipped with Porapak QS. The GC detectors and columns were pre calibrated with certified standard gas mixtures obtained from Abdulla Hashim suppliers, Saudi Arabia. The reported results were within the sample standard devastation of ±1% mass. Small amount of HCN formation was reported on V–Sb/Al2O3 and V–Sb–W/Al2O3 catalyst [7], [9], [13] hence HCN was not analyzed in the present study. The total selectivity for acetonitrile, acrolein and acrylic acid was found in between 3 and 6% in the present study. The carbon balance falls in the range of 95–98%. The conversion, selectivity and yield was calculated based on these formulae:
where CR is the ratio of the carbon atoms in the product to the number of carbon atoms in the propane.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. BET surface area and pore size distribution study
The nitrogen physisorption isotherms, pore size distribution histogram and BET surface area information of AlN, AlH and AlC with 50% Al loading was presented in Fig. 1 and Table 1. The result reveals the clear influence of alumina precursor on BET surface area, pore volume and pore size of the catalyst samples. Fig. 1 illustrates the pore size DFT area histogram with tri model pore distribution. All the three catalysts showed few number of micro and narrow sized mesopores in the pore width rage of 12–20 Å and 20–40 Å, respectively. The large size mesopores were distributed in the range of 40–100 Å on AlN and AlH with average pore width of 53 and 65 Å, respectively. On the other hand, wide spread distribution of large size mesopores (40–200 Å averaged at 80 Å pore width) observed on AlC. The maximum mesopore volume of 0.275 cc/g was obtained on AlC followed by AlH (0.228 cc/g) and AlN (0.200 cc/g). Fig. 1 inset displays the type-IV isotherm for all the three samples which is the characteristic feature of mesopore capillary condensation with mono-multi layer adsorption [16]. The shift in the hysteresis loop with respect to relative pressure under similar physisortion conditions indicates the mesopore size variation in the samples. The decreasing order of estimated BET surface area for these samples as follows: AlC (192.0 m2/g) > AlH (181.0 m2/g) > AlN (174.0 m2/g). The result shows that Al2O3 produced from AlCl3 generates greater BET surface area, large size mesopores with high volume. This might be associated with different degree of interaction between Al2O3 and the active species.

3.2. XRD study
Fig. 2 displays the X-ray pattern for fresh AlN, AlH and AlC samples. The fresh AlC catalyst was partially X-ray crystalline and the degree of crystallinity found to be higher in fresh AlN and AlH catalysts under similar XRD conditions (2 h of analysis, 30 mg of each catalyst). In all the three samples, X-ray patterns pronounced due to AlPO4 [PDF 01-088-1680] and γ-Al2O3 [PDF 00-050-0741] phases. The addition of phosphorous to V–Sb–W/Al2O3 catalyst generated aluminum phosphate (AlPO4) by the interaction of phosphorous with alumina precursor during the catalyst synthesis and/or thermal pretreatment. Further, the Al2O3 obtained from aluminum chloride precursor showed broad X-ray patterns compared to Al2O3 synthesized from aluminum hydroxide and aluminum nitrate. The broadening of X-ray pattern indicates the presence of dispersed/small sized Al2O3 crystallite. In all the three catalysts vanadium exists as -VO2 [PDF 01-071-0289], antimony present in the form of Sb2O3 [PDF 01-075-1565]/Sb2O4 [PDF 01-071-0564] and W exists as WO3 [01-088-0545] phase. Similar phases were reported by Guojuna et al. [15] for fresh V–Sb3–W/Al2O3 catalyst. However, there were few differences observed in the X-ray pattern of the studied catalysts with respect to alumina precursor used. Aluminum nitrate primarily produces Sb2O4 and an unknown phase, whereas, aluminum hydroxide principally produces Sb2O3, Sb2O4 and an unknown phase in the final catalyst. On the other hand, aluminum chloride primarily produces Sb2O4 phase in the final catalyst. The variation in the intensities and FWHM for V, W and Sb phases in all the three catalyst indicates the difference in the crystallite size/dispersion of V–Sb–W related phase on their corresponding Al2O3. No X-ray patterns detected for V–P–O related phases. It is clear from the XRD results that the phase growth and direction was influenced by the alumina precursor in V–Sb–W/Al2O3 catalyst.

3.3. FTIR study
Fig. 3 illustrates the FTIR results of fresh AlN, AlH and AlC catalysts. A broad infrared band observed in the finger print region of 400–1050 cm−1 with shoulders at 600, 725, 800, 880, 1130 and 1625 cm−1 for all the three samples. The shoulder at 600 cm−1 was attributed to symmetric vibration of Sb2O3 [17] and/or related to AlO4/AlO6 vibrations [18]. The shoulder at 800 cm−1 associated with WOW bending vibrations [17]. The band at 1130 cm−1 ascribed to PO stretching vibration for PO4 group in AlPO4 [19]. The shoulders appeared at 725 and 880 cm−1 were attributed to VO vibrations in VO2 and V4O9 species, respectively [20]. Further, the broad nature of finger print band cannot eliminate the presence of other VO (923 and 1005 cm−1) vibrations in these catalysts. The FTIR results are in agreement with XRD data.

3.4. HAADF/EDS study
Fig. 4 demonstrates the HAADF/EDS analysis of fresh AlN, AlH and AlC, catalysts. EDS analysis of these samples accomplished under focused beam unless otherwise stated. Fig. 4a and b displays 4 types of particle morphologies for AlN and AlH samples. They are nebulous, warm like, patch and near pyramidal type particles. EDS analysis of nebulous as well as warm like well-structured particles revealed as aluminum oxide. These are aggregated nano particles characterized by Al–O–Al linkages. EDS analysis of patches revealed the presence of V, Sb, W and oxygen components after excluding Al which comes from support Al2O3. Interestingly, the patches existed close to each other and chained to form a triangular shape on the surface of Al2O3. The approximate width of each patch in AlH found to be in the range of 60–80 nm with length 100–250 nm. However, for AlN the individual patch found to be much bigger compared to AlH and AlC with 100–120 nm width and 125–300 nm length. Further, EDS analysis of near pyramidal shaped particles revealed the presence of Sb, W and O components and the corresponding particle composition was comparable to -Sb0.15(WO3) [21]. In addition, the unknown phase X-ray patterns (Fig. 2) for AlH and AlN at 2θ = 23.0 and 56.0° are also comparable with -Sb0.15(WO3) X-ray patterns [21]. The size of these particles found to be in the range of 100–200 nm. On the other hand, only two different particle morphologies obtained on AlC catalyst (Fig 4c). The nebulous type mainly ascribed to aluminum oxide and patch type particles were associated with V, Sb, W and oxygen components (Fig. 4c, EDS graph). For AlC, the individual patch width and length exists in the range of 20–60 nm and 80–200 nm, respectively. The patch type morphology was also observed by Nilsson et al. [8] for rutile type Sb(V,W)O4 phase in V1.0Sb5.0W1.0/50% Al2O3 catalyst. However, those patches were irregular unlike the present study. Thus, we believe that the patches in this study with V, Sb, W and O components might be associated with a kind of rutile phase. The average EDS composition of five selected triangular patches for AlN, AlH and AlC samples are listed in Table 1. The parallel beam EDS analysis of selected slots revealed P along with Al, V, Sb, W and oxygen components for all the three samples. The result suggests that P is coming from the surrounding AlPO4 (as evidenced by XRD) present in the final catalyst. Further, the chloride existence on AlC (Table 1) was likely due to the residue of AlCl3. The HAADF/EDS result suggests the surface enrichment in V–Sb–W phase on Al2O3 synthesized from alumina chloride precursor. Whereas, V–Sb–W and Sb–W–O related phase existed on Al2O3 synthesized from aluminum nitrate and aluminum hydroxide precursor.

3.5. XPS study
Table 2 presents the surface compositions of V 2p3/2, Sb 3d3/2, P2p, W 4d5/2 and Al 2p for fresh AlN, AlH and fresh/spent AlC catalysts. After subtracting W 5s and V 3s binding energy (BE) from the Al 2p XPS signal, it showed BE at 74 ± 0.1 eV indicates the presence of Al+3 species. For, P 2p the BE recorded at 133 ± 0.1 eV attributed to P+5 species in all the three samples. After subtracting the Sb 3d5/2 and V 2p1/2 signal from O1s XPS signal, the shirley deconvolution generated a pair of signals at 530.5 and 532.8 eV. The earlier signal related to lattice oxygen (O−2) and the later one ascribed to isolated (O−) oxygen species. The O1s BE for AlPO4 reported at 532.8 eV [22]. According to the Ref. [23], V 2p3/2 XPS signal for bulk V2O5 (V+5) was narrow and appeared at 517.2 eV with 1.2 eV full width half maxima (FWHM). For bulk VO2, V 2p3/2 BE and FWHM was reported as 516 and ≈2 eV, respectively. The broad nature of V 2p3/2 signal in VO2 (V+4) and V2O3 (V+3, FWHM > 3 eV) was associated with multiplet configurations in the photoemission final states related to the core hole-3d electron interactions [23]. In the present study, the FWHM for V 2p3/2 measured greater than 3 eV in all the three catalysts. After shirley deconvolution of V 2p3/2 (V 2p1/2 to V 2p3/2 peak ratio 1:2) signal, it exhibits mainly V+5 and V+4 species on the surface of Al2O3. The V+4 recorded BE was in the range of 516.1–516.3 eV and for V+5 it was in the range of 517.2–517.4 eV for all the three catalysts. However, the V2p1/2 signal showed FWHM of 2.0 eV and it was merged with O 1s/Sb3d5/2 signal. Therefore, it was very complex to fit one more peak through shirley deconvolution to see the possibility of V+3 species on Al2O3 in all the three catalysts.

The shirley deconvolution of Sb 3d3/2 was based on the peak ratio of 2:3 between Sb 3d3/2 and Sb 3d5/2. All the three catalysts majorly showed Sb+4 species with small portion of Sb+5 species in the BE range of 540.3–540.4 eV and 540.5–540.9 eV, respectively. Nilsson et al. reported Sb 3d3/2 BE at 540.4 eV for Sb2O4 and at 540.8 eV for Sb2O5 [24]. WO3 showed the W 4d5/2 BE at 247.7 eV and the BE of WO2 in Sb(W,V)O4 rutile phase reported at 246.5 eV [8]. In this study, the BE of W4d5/2 recorded in the range of 247–247.4 eV which is intermediate between WO3 and WO2 BE. The results suggest the presence of W+6 and W+4 species in all the three catalysts.
Among the fresh catalysts AlC showed higher alumina content near the surface (Table 2) which indicates the greater dispersion of V, Sb and W oxides [8] on its surface. The result are in good agreement with XRD and pore volume data. According to the authors [25], the redox process between V+5 and Sb+3 generates the reduced V+4/V+3 species and oxidized Sb+4/Sb+5 species under the catalyst calcination conditions. In the present study, the surface existence of V+4/+5, Sb+4/+5 and W+4/+6 species in different concentrations (Table 2) suggest the presence of active V–Sb–W phase to a different extent on the surface of Al2O3 synthesized from aluminum nitrate, aluminum hydroxide and aluminum chloride precursors.
3.6. NH3 TPD mass (MS) study
In general, acrylonitrile selectivity depends on ammonia sorption ability of the surface active sites on the employed catalyst for the propane ammoxidation reaction. In the present study, thermally induced NH3 sorption results on AlN, AlH and AlC catalysts are present in Fig. 5a. These measurements provide an important information about the nature of surface active sites on V–Sb–P–W/Al2O3 catalyst. Fig. 5a shows two distinct desorption peaks for all the three catalysts. The first peak pronounced in the temperature range of 150–350 °C with peak maxima around 225 °C. The later broad desorption appeared in the temperature range of 340–500 °C for AlN and AlH samples. On the other hand, for AlC the later desorption was extended in the temperature range of 300–580 °C. The earlier desorption was due to the acid sites of weak strength and the later desorption was associated with acid sites of moderate/strong strength on V–Sb–P–W/Al2O3 catalyst. Among the studied catalysts, the maximum ammonia desorption was observed on AlC (185 μmol gcat−1) over AlH (178 μmol gcat−1) and AlN (160 μmol gcat−1) samples. The acid strength of Al2O3 was strongly enhanced by the incorporation of Cl− into or on the surface during the impregnation with solutions containing chloride precursors of an active component or by deposition of AlCl3 [26]. Therefore, we strongly believe that the enhancement of the acid strength on AlC was associated with residual Cl− on its surface and/or in the bulk of catalyst as established by XPS and EDS.

The corresponding TPD mass signals with m/z = 16 (–NH2), 17 (NH3), 18 (H2O), 28 (N2), 30 (NO) and 44 (N2O) was recorded for AlN, AlH and AlC catalysts. Fig. 5b shows two mass signals for NH3 (blue line) in the temperature range of 50–450 °C and 540–600 °C for all the three samples. The first mass signal showed peak maxima at 180 °C with a shoulder at 325 °C. And the second signal showed peak maxima at 565 °C. The mass signal at 180 °C ascribed to physisorbed NH3 and the signal appeared at 325/565 °C attributed to chemisorbed NH3 on the surface of the V–Sb–P–W/50% Al2O3 catalyst. The mass signal observed for –NH2 (Fig. 5b, redline) species was identical to NH3 mass signal in terms of temperature range and maxima. The results indicate that the similar nature of catalyst surface sites performing unchanged ammonia desorption and ammonia oxidation to some extent to form –NH2 species. One of the ammonia degraded product water (H2O) showed three mass signals in the temperature range of 80–180 °C (peak maxima at 130 °C), 190–540 °C (peak maxima at 360 °C) and 540–600 °C (peak maxima at 565 °C) for all the three samples (Fig. 5b, green line). The formation of water at 130 °C was due to adsorbed NH3 reacts with very active and weekly existing O− and O2− species on the catalyst surface. Whereas, the water formed at 360 and 565 °C might be associated with adsorbed NH3 reacts with lattice oxygen diffusing from the bulk up to the surface of the catalyst.
Further, oxidation of adsorbed –NH2 species produces degraded products like N2 and NOx. The N2, NO and N2O product distribution on AlN, AlH and AlC catalysts are present in Fig. 5c. For AlN, the N2 and N2O mass signal observed at signal maxima 140, 325, 410 and 550 °C. It is noteworthy, that nitric oxide (NO) formation was not detected on this catalyst and the reason for it is unknown at this moment. On the other hand, N2, NO and N2O mass signal observed at signal maxima 140, 225, 325 and 550 °C on AlH catalyst. However, on AlC only two mass signal maxima recorded for N2, NO and N2O at 125 and 550 °C. In addition, a steady mass signal proceeds without registering any peak maxima in the temperature range of 225–500 °C for N2 and N2O on AlC catalyst. The results indicate that the moderate/strong acid sites have very wide distribution on AlC to decompose the adsorbed –NH2 species. Whereas, the moderate/strong site distribution (200–500 °C) was more prominent on AlN and AlH and hence desorbed considerable amount of –NH2 decomposed species such as N2 and N2O. Thus, the residual chlorine tuned the moderate/strong acid site density and distribution on AlC which intern influence the acrylonitrile selectivity. It was reported that the lattice oxygen participates in the formation of the surface intermediate –NH2 and both lattice and weekly adsorbed oxygen species (O2− and O−) are active for the conversion of the intermediate (–NH2) into N2 and NOx [27]. It is notable that the O 1s XPS surface composition for AlN and AlH showed high amount of lattice and isolated oxygen species (O2− and O−) compared to AlC.
3.7. Catalytic activity
Fig. 6a–c shows the ammoxidation reactant (propane, O2 and NH3) conversion and (ACN, C3H6, COx and C1+C2) product selectivity results on AlN, AlH and AlC catalysts in the temperature range of 490–530 °C at W/F = 2.8 gcat s ml−1. Bulk AlPO4 employed as a catalyst for the ammoxidation of 2-methyl pyrazine to 2-cyanopyrazine and its minor catalytic activity was attributed to its acid sites of weak strength [28]. In the present work, AlPO4 contribution for propane ammoxidation can not be ruled out. The bulk of V1.0–Sb3.5–P0.5–W1.0 catalyst showed O2, propane and NH3 conversion of 90, 40 and 95% respectively, with 20% slelctivity to propylene and 8% selectivity to ACN at 530 °C. Among the supported catalysts, the maximum conversion of O2 (85%), propane (76%) and NH3 (60%) was observed on AlC at 530 °C. Propane and O2 conversion was increased with increase in the reaction temperature for all the three catalysts. The increasing order of O2 and propane conversion for the studied catalysts as follows: AlH < AlN < AlC. On the other hand, NH3 conversion decreased with increase in the reaction temperature as shown in Fig 6a–c. This was associated with high degree of reduction of the catalyst due to high COx formation and as a consequence poor surface oxygen availability lead to insufficient ammonia oxidation. According to Nilsson et al. [8] NH3 conversion decreased with increase in C3-product (C3H6 and ACN) selectivity. Essentially, the greater propane conversion on AlC was associated with active surafce enriched in V–Sb–W phase. However, the slight increase in the propane and O2 conversion on AlN over AlH might be associated with prominent Sb–W–O related phase as established by HAADF/EDS.

Fig. 6. Catalytic activity results on (a) AlN (b) AlH and (c) AlC samples. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
Reaction conditions: catalyst weight 4.6 g, particle size 0.5–2.0 mm, W/F = 2.8 gcat s ml−1, feed composition: 19.11% oxygen, 12.74% ammonia and 6.37% propane balanced helium.
Among the catalysts, AlH showed maximum selectivity to propylene (21%) followed by AlN (17%) and AlC (5%) at 490 °C (Fig. 6a–c, gold colour line). The other proapne/propylene degarded products such as CH4 and C2H4 formation was found to be high on AlN and AlH compared to AlC (Fig. 6, purple line). The maximum COx selectivity of 38% was obtained on AlN followed by AlC (26%) and AlH (23%) at 530 °C (Fig. 6a–c, red line). The slight decrease in the COx selectivity on AlH compared to AlC was associated with its low propane and O2 conversions. It is clear from the result that AlN and AlH surface with V–Sb–W + Sb–W–O related phase was capable of doing propane dehydrogenation as well as propane/propylene degradation. Nilsson et al. [8] have also reported greater slectivity to C1 + C2 products on Sb-W/Al catalyst due to propane/propylene degradation.
The maximum ACN selectivity of 28% was observed on AlC over AlH (22%) and AlN (13%) at 530 °C in Fig. 6a–c (pale blue line). According to Ref. [8] the acrylonitrile yield/selectivity increased with increase in propane conversion on V–Sb–W/Al2O3 catalyst. To some extent, the lower propylene yield on AlC was endorsed to its higher selectivity to acrylonitrile. The lower slectivity for acrylo nitrile on AlN and AlH was attributed to degartion of adsorbed NH3 to N2/NOx to a greater extent as established by the NH3 TPD mass results (Fig. 5c). On the otherhand, higher adsorption ability for NH3 in the presence of residual chloride followed by facile nitrogen insersion on AlC led to higher ACN selectivity. The presence of chloride plays an important role for the reforming process on Pt–Al2O3 catalysts [29]. The catalytic activity data in Fig. 6a–c clearly demonstrates the better catalytic properties of AlC compared to AlH and AlN catalysts.
Fig. 7 illustrates propane conversion versus ACN yield on AlN, AlH and AlC catalysts in the temperature range of 490–530 °C at W/F = 2.8 gcat s ml−1. The maximum ACN yield of 21.5% was observed on AlC at 530 °C. Whereas, AlH and AlN showed 14 and 9% of ACN yield respectively, at 530 °C. The greater ACN yield on AlC was associated with (i) active surface enriched in V–Sb–W phase (ii) high adsorption ability for NH3 followed by facile nitrogen insersion tendency on chlorinated Al2O3 precipitated from AlCl3.

Fig. 7. Propane conversion versus ACN yield on AlN, AlH and AlC samples.
Reaction conditions: temperature 490–530 °C mentioned in brackets in graph, catalyst weight 4.6 g, W/F = 2.8 gcat s ml−1, feed composition: 19.11% oxygen, 12.74% ammonia and 6.37% propane balanced helium.
3.8. Catalyst stability study
The stability of the AlN, AlH and AlC catalysts are studied for 10 h at 510 °C with W/F = 2.8 gcat s ml−1 and the results are presented in Fig. 8. Among the catalysts, AlC showed steady ACN yield for 6 h, whereas, AlH and AlN showed 4 h of consistentcy towards ACN production under the studied propane ammoxidation conditions. The gradual decrease in the ACN yield might be associated with loss of chloride during the catalytic process for AlC and or deactivation due to the water generated in the reaction. The other possibility for decrease in the ACN yiled might be associated with agrregrated or large V–Sb–W crystallite on AlN and AlH as evidenced by fresh/spent catalyst X-ray patterns. The catalytic results in the present study appear rather unproductive in terms of acrylonitrile yield, however, they can be of interest if a process integrated with recycling of the reaction feeds which usually take place in an industrial application. Further, the AlC catalytic aspects can be improved by feeding CCl4 as a precursor of the surface chloride promoter for this reaction. The present catalytic results are compared with other catalytic systems such as Ca–Bi–Mo [30], Mo–V–Nb [31], V/AlGaPO4 [32] and Fe–Bi/SiO2 [3] studied for propane ammoxidation. About 15% propane conversion with 28% ACN selectivity was obtained on Ca–Bi–Mo catalyst at 500 °C. High amounts of acetonitrile (19%) with small portion of ACN (9%) and propylene (4%) formation was observed on Mo–V–Nb–O catalyst at 500 °C. At 5 wt.% V loading the galium phosphate catalyst only showed 20% propane conversion with 10% ACN selectivity at 500 °C. The Fe–Bi catalyst showed only 10% yield of ACN with 20% propane conversion at 500 °C. In the present study, V–Sb–P–W/Al2O3 catalyst showed 20.5% ACN yield at 510 °C and it can be improved by changing the feed composition and contact time.

Fig. 8. Stability studies on AlN, AlH and AlC samples.
Reaction conditions: temperature 510 °C, catalyst weight 4.6 g, W/F = 2.8 gcat s ml−1, feed composition: 19.11% oxygen, 12.74% ammonia and 6.37% propane balanced helium.
The plausible propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile, COx and NOx pathways based on Fig. 6, Fig. 7 and NH3TPD mass results are discussed here. The decrease in the propylene selectivity followed by improved ACN selectivity (or yield) with respect to reaction temperature suggests the ACN formation through propylene route for all the three catalysts. The detection of acrolein/acrylic acid in the reaction stream (Section 2.6) further strenthens the propylene oxidation to acrolein/acrylic acid route. In addition, NH3 sorption and –NH2 species formation (mass analysis, Fig 5b) on V–Sb–P–W/Al2O3 catalysts in the reaction temperature zone indicates the possible nitrogen insersion in acrolein/acrylic acid to produce ACN. Hence, the sucessive route for conversion of propane to ACN associated with: propane to propylene to acrolein/acrylic acid to ACN on V–Sb–P–W/Al2O3 catalysts. The decrease in the C1 + C2 product selectivity followed by improved COx slectiivty with respect to reaction temperature suggests COx formation through the decomposition of C1 + C2 products to some extent in parallel on V–Sb–P–W/Al catalysts. The COx and hydrocarbon (C1 + C2 products) formation through propane/proylene degradation was also observed on V–Sb–W/Al2O3 catalyst [27], [8]. Based on NH3 TPD mass results, the formation of N2, NOx and H2O indicates the parallel decomposition of ammonia on V–Sb–P–W/Al2O3 surface under propane ammoxidation conditions.
Fig. 9a shows the X-ray pattern of spent AlN, AlH and AlC smples. Identical X-ray pattern pronounced in spent and fresh AlN and AlH catalysts due to γ-Al2O3, AlPO4, VO2, WO3, antimony oxide and an unknown phases. The results indicate that during the propane ammoxidation the surface changes were limited on AlN and AlH. This might be associated with large size crystals of V–Sb–W and Sb–W–O related phase. On the other hand, the spent AlC (Fig. 9a) retains AlPO4 and γ-Al2O3 phases after the propane ammoxidation. However, Sb2O4, VO2 and WO3 related pattern were minimized, instead a broad pattern was observed in the 2θ range of 26–40°. The broad X-ray pattern indicates the small size/dispersed particles of Sb2O4, VO2 and WO3. Nilsson et al. [8] reported the rutile phase (Sb0.9V0.9−xWxO4) enhancement in V1.0–Sb5.0–W1.0/Al2O3 catalyst after the propane ammoxidation. The result suggest the rearrangement of oxide phase near the surface during the propane ammoxidation on AlC. To know more about the surface changes on spent AlC, the sample was further analyzed by HAADF/EDS and XPS techniques. Fig. 9b clearly shows the scattered patches of V–Sb–W particles and the results are in agreement with spent XRD data. The spent AlC XPS surface composition is listed in Table 2. The results indicate the surface enrichment of vanadium and antimony species on spent AlC over its fresh counterpart. This might be associated with diffusion of oxide from bulk to surface during the propane ammoxidation process and generated more active surface compared to AlN and AlH catalysts.

4. Conclusions
•
Nebulous and warm like morphology was observed for Al2O3 synthesized from aluminum hydroxide and aluminum nitrate precursors. On the other hand, only nebulous Al2O3 observed for aluminum chloride precursor.
•
Enrichment in V–Sb–W phase was observed on nebulous Al2O3. Whereas, Sb–W–O related phase was observed on warm like Al2O3.
•
High sorption ability for ammonia on Al2O3 synthesized from AlCl3 was likely due to the presence of residual chloride on its surface and/or in the bulk of the catalyst.
•
Among the precursors studied, Al2O3 synthesized from AlCl3 showed maximum catalytic activity in terms of propane conversion (76%) and ACN yield (21.5%) at 530 °C.
•
AlH and AlN generates the surface with large size V–Sb–W and Sb–W–O related phase which intern performs the propane dehydrogenation to propylene followed by its degradation to COx. The low adsorption ability for ammonia and prominent formation of NOx on AlH and AlN further indicates the nitrogen insersion step was slow in the intermediate molecule of propane to yield ACN.
