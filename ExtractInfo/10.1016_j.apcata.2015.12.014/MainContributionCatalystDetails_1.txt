 Based on the details provided in the document, this does not appear to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The document discusses propane ammoxidation to acrylonitrile using V-Sb-P-W/Al2O3 catalysts. Ammoxidation involves the reaction of propane with ammonia and oxygen to produce acrylonitrile, which is different from propane dehydrogenation to propylene.
