 Based on the document, this does not appear to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses using cobalt grafted onto silica as a catalyst, but does not mention conversion of propane specifically. There are no details provided on propane conversion, selectivity, or yield. Therefore, I cannot extract the requested information.
