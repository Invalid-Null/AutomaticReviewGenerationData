Location and structure of coke generated over Pt–Sn/Al2O3 in propane dehydrogenation
Abstract
Pt and Pt–Sn/alumina catalysts were prepared by either an incipient wetness impregnation or co-impregnation method, and their deactivation behavior, coke structure and coke location in propane dehydrogenation were investigated by XRD, XPS, TPO and reaction tests. The XRD and XPS measurements confirmed that coke structure over all spent catalysts was pregraphite-like carbon, which presents at 2θ = 25° in XRD patterns and binding energy = 283.9 eV in XPS spectra. In the TPO results, along with Sn contents, oxidation peak of coke was shifted to a higher temperature, which can be interpreted that coke formed during the reaction was mainly located on the support in the case of Pt–Sn/alumina because coke generated on metal surfaces was readily transferred to the support in the presence of Sn. This would be responsible for high tolerance of Pt–Sn/Al2O3 to catalyst deactivation.
1. Introduction
Most of the propylene consumed in the petrochemical industry is produced with ethylene in a naphtha cracking center. As the demand for propylene is growing faster than ethylene demand, the net result is a shortfall of propylene supply from steam cracking relative to demand. Hence, a shortfall is made-up by “on-purpose” propylene from propane dehydrogenation. Propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction and conversion is limited by thermodynamics. Higher conversion rates will require either higher temperatures or lower pressures [1]; commercially viable conversion requires reaction temperatures above 500 °C [2]. At high temperatures, parasitic reactions such as oligomerization to heavier compounds, cracking to lighter hydrocarbons, skeletal isomerization, aromatization, alkylation of the formed aromatic rings, and formation of carbonaceous deposits lead to rapid loss of activity and lower yields [3].
Catalysts used for propane dehydrogenation are based on Pt/γ-Al2O3 because of its low activity for hydrogenolysis; however, this catalyst is susceptible to deactivation by coke deposits occurring under high temperature reaction conditions [4], [5]. To improve the coke tolerance of the supported platinum catalyst, many reaction modifications have been explored. Hydrogen was added into the propane feedstock to suppress the tendency of over-dehydrogenation [6]. Supported Pt catalysts were modified by adding a second metal (Sn, Pb, Zn, Ga) [7], [8], [9], [10] and/or alkali metal (Li, K, Na) [11]. Some rare earth metals (La, Ce) were also used to promote the supports (Al2O3, SiO2) by enhancing their thermal stability and electronic effects [12]. Although Sn is one of the most efficient promoters, deactivation due to coke formation is not completely eliminated, and the catalysts still have a short lifetime and require regeneration to restore activity. Another approach has been the use of non-acidic supports that lead to fewer cracking and polymerization reactions compared with acidic supports [13], [14], [15].
Coking behavior over supported catalysts leads to decreased catalytic activity by two mechanisms: poisoning of the active sites or limiting access of the reactants to the active sites due to partial or complete blockage of pores by coke. Both deactivation modes can occur simultaneously, although one of the two mechanisms is usually predominant [16]. To regenerate the catalysts, the coke is removed through oxidation at high temperatures that result in metal sintering or support degradation. Therefore, understanding the process of coke deposition on the catalysts is important in improving catalyst performance and optimizing catalyst regeneration.
As a promoter, Sn has been suggested to modify the electronic and geometric properties of Pt [17]; however, the role of Sn in Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, a subject of debate for many years, remains elusive [18], [19]. For example, an increase in coke content is usually obtained when Sn is added into a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst [20], [21], [22]. In contrast, a decrease in coke content was reported on bimetallic Pt–Sn/Al2O3 compared to its counterpart Pt/Al2O3 [23], [24], [25]. In this work, we tried to investigate the influence of Sn addition on the structure and location of coke formed in propane dehydrogenation over Pt–Al2O3 catalysts. Propane dehydrogenation was performed in a fixed-bed reactor to monitor the deactivation behavior of the catalysts. The coke structure was identified using XRD and XPS; the coke location was revealed by TPO.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Mesoporous alumina was synthesized by a sol–gel method. Typically, 6.0 g of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, Aldrich) was added to a mixture containing 525 ml of deionized water and 225 ml of ethanol (Aldrich) under vigorous stirring at 60 °C for 20 min. Then, 10 ml of ammonium hydroxide was added to the solution, and 30 g of aluminum tri-sec-butoxide (Aldrich) was added dropwise while stirring. The resulting mixture was held at 60 °C and continued stirring for 3 h. After filtration, the product was washed with ethanol and dried in air at 25 °C for 12 h. The product was calcined in an air flow by heating from room temperature to 550 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min and holding at 550 °C for 6.0 h. More information on the procedure for synthesis of mesoporous alumina can be found in the literature [26].
Pt loadings on alumina were prepared using the incipient wetness impregnation technique. Bimetallic catalysts (1% Pt–0.29% Sn, 1% Pt–0.53% Sn, 1% Pt–1.67% Sn) were prepared by a co-impregnation technique. Metal loading percentage is the weight percentage of metal loaded to catalysts per total catalyst. Precursor (H2PtCl6·6H2O and/or SnCl2) was dissolved in a solution of 1 M HCl. Then, one aliquot of 200 μl of precursor was evenly dispersed over calcined alumina, and this procedure was repeated until the ratio of liquid to support was 1 ml/g. Catalysts were dried at room temperature for 24 h in a vacuum hood before drying at 100 °C for 12 h in an oven. Calcination was performed at 450 °C for 6 h from room temperature to 450 °C with a ramp of 1 °C/min.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Coke on spent catalysts was measured by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TA Instruments Q50). Approximately 10.0 mg of spent catalyst was charged into the sample pan, and then was heated to 700 °C at a rate of 40 °C/min in a flow of air. The coke content, based on a dried sample of each catalyst, was calculated after subtracting the water content.
Isotherm and pore size distribution of the reduced catalysts were characterized by the nitrogen sorption technique (Micromeritics ASAP 2020). The samples were degassed before analyzing under vacuum at 300 °C for 4 h and measured at −196.15 °C on an automatic analyzer. From the desorption branch, the pore size distribution was calculated by using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model. Textural properties of the samples measured by N2-sorption are listed in Table 1.
Table 1. Textural properties of the reduced catalysts measured by N2-sorption.

1% Pt-fresh 253.5 0.79 8.52
1% Pt–0.29%Sn-fresh 230.0 0.62 7.83
1% Pt–1.53%Sn-fresh 184.0 0.52 7.96
1% Pt–1.67%Sn-fresh 243.5 0.65 7.50
Coke structure on spent catalysts was characterized by the XRD technique. The diffraction patterns were obtained on a Rigaku D/MAX-2200 powder X-ray diffractometer using a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.15418 nm). The X-ray tube was operated at 35 kV, 20 mA, and the 2θ angle was scanned from 10 to 100° (step wise 0.02°) at a speed of 2°/min.
An XPS study of fresh and spent catalysts was carried out on a Thermo VG Scientific ESCALAB-250 instrument with an excitation source of AlKα radiation. Besides a scan range from 0 to 1200 eV binding energy for identification of all detectable elements, detailed scans for chemical state identification and quantification were also obtained. Because the most intense line, the Pt 4f7/2 doublet, completely overlapped with the Al 2p line from the Al2O3 support, the Pt 4d5/2 line was used for identification of the chemical state. The binding energy of the Al 2s line from Al2O3 at 119.0 eV was used as an internal reference for calibration. To determine the binding energy, the peaks were fitted with Gaussian curves after a background correction. The assignment of peaks was interpreted based on the NIST X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Data base, Version 3.5 [27].
2.3. Catalytic deactivation test
Dehydrogenation of propane was tested in a quartz fixed-bed reactor flow system at atmospheric pressure. For all experiments, the catalyst (100 mg) was previously reduced with a flow (50 ml/min) of pure H2 at 600 °C for 2 h and purged to remove H2 gas remaining in the reactor for 10 min with a flow (100 ml/min) of N2. Then the reaction mixture consisting of N2 (100 ml/min) and C3H8 (30 ml/min) was fed into the reactor at 600 °C. The flow rate of each gas was controlled by a mass-flow-controller that had been previously calibrated. Beginning 1 min from the start of the reaction, the product of the reaction was sampled at time intervals and analyzed by gas chromatography (YOUNG LIN-Acme 6000 GC). A flame ionization detector and a 30 m × 0.53 mm HP-PLOT Al2O3 “KCl” capillary column were used to detect and separate each component in the product.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Deactivation rate and coke content
The propane dehydrogenation reaction was performed at 600 °C and atmospheric pressure for 160 min on stream. The influence of platinum loading and a second metal on propane conversion and propylene selectivity is shown in Fig. 1. The amount of coke deposited on each catalyst was quantified by TGA analysis as shown in Table 2.

Coke content (wt.%) 9.37 8.03 7.97 6.18
Deactivation rate, n 0.44 0.45 0.42 0.087
To compare the deactivation rate among the catalysts, we took the mathematical model from the previous report that gave the following equation [28]:
where xt is the conversion of propane in the moment t, x0 is the initial conversion, and the ratio xt/x0 is the relative activity. The deactivation rate of the catalyst can be calculated by utilizing the above equation. A higher absolute value of “n” is a faster catalyst deactivation rate. After linear regression, the values for “n” were derived from the slopes of fitting curves as summarized in Table 2.
Catalytic activity and propylene selectivity, in general, increase in the following order: 1% Pt < 1% Pt–0.29% Sn < 1% Pt–0.53% Sn < 1% Pt–1.67% Sn. The best coke tolerance is found with the 1% Pt–1.67% Sn catalyst which had the slowest deactivation rate and lowest coke content.
On the 1% Pt catalyst, propane conversion decreases dramatically and propylene selectivity increases sharply after a few minutes on stream. This observation indicates that coke deposition leads to deactivation and coke on the surface of the catalyst acts as a promoter that poisons the sites responsible for side reactions. When tin was added into platinum supported on alumina catalyst, propane conversion as well as propylene selectivity increased. This result is in agreement with numerous previous studies that suggest tin promotes platinum-supported catalysts by increasing platinum dispersion that leads to higher conversion [29], [30], [31]. An improvement in platinum dispersion is also found when other second metals, such as cerium or zinc, are added into the platinum-supported catalyst [8].
In the case of 1% Pt–1.67% Sn catalyst, the valent states of tin and its influence on the electronic properties of Pt were identified by XPS and are shown in Fig. 2. Two peaks in Fig. 2a with binding energies of Sn (3d5/2) at 484.3 and 486.1 eV correspond to Sn(0) (zero-valent) and Sn(II, IV) (mixture of di-valent and tetra-valent), respectively. The binding energies of Pt (4d5/2) in Fig. 2b without and with tin addition are located at 314.2 and 314.4 eV, respectively. Our results agree with previous XPS measurements that indicate a fraction of tin in the zero-valent state and probable formation of intermetallic species with Pt in the reduced Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst [32], [33].

High coordination sites on Pt particles (terraces, steps) are active sites for C–H and H–H bond breaking while low coordination sites (kinks, edges) are highly active sites for C–C bond scission [34], [35]. It has been suggested that tin is selectively distributed at the low coordination sites on rhodium [36] and nickel surfaces [37]. Therefore, we expect the role of tin on the platinum surface to be similar to that on rhodium or nickel surfaces. In a previous study, tin was found at the more energetic sites on the surface of platinum particles supported on hydrotalcite as observed by in situ CO-FTIR [38]. Because tin inhibits the low coordination sites on platinum particles which are responsible for side reactions producing coke precursors, the addition of tin into the platinum catalyst reduces the coke content and deactivation rate on the bimetallic Pt–Sn catalyst.
3.2. Coke structure
Fig. 3 shows the XRD pattern of fresh and spent catalysts of 1% Pt and 1% Pt–1.67% Sn. Four patterns from (a) to (d) display three distinct peaks at 2θ = 38, 46, and 67°, which agree with the standard for γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS No. 29-1486). These peaks have obviously strong intensities indicating that γ-Al2O3 has a good crystallinity. The platinum, tin, and intermetallic phases are not detected in the fresh and spent catalysts. This indicates either that Pt, Sn, and intermetallic species are well dispersed on the γ-Al2O3 after reduction and are not sintered after reaction or that the small crystallite size is below the limit of XRD detection. The similarity of the gamma phase of Al2O3 in the XRD patterns between fresh and spent catalysts indicates that the structure of the alumina support did not change after the reaction.

One characteristic peak in the XRD, the so-called peak of coke, located at 2θ = 25° (d = 3.56 Å) from 1% Pt-spent and 1% Pt–1.67% Sn-spent catalysts, is the main difference between the patterns of the fresh and spent catalysts. For all spent catalysts, the spacing of the line at 2θ = 25° (d = 3.56 Å) is greater than the line corresponding to graphite carbon (d(0 0 2) = 3.35 Å). This kind of coke can be considered to be a carbon type called “pregraphite-like carbon”. This characterization shows that the coke on Pt and Pt–Sn/Al2O3 has a certain degree of organization which was also observed in a previous study of the hydrocarbon reforming process over a Pt-supported alumina catalyst [39].
More information on the nature of the coke species, the C 1s spectra from XPS over 1% Pt-fresh and 1% Pt-spent catalysts and 1% Pt–1.67% Sn-fresh and 1% Pt–1.67% Sn-spent catalysts are shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, respectively.

On 1% Pt-fresh and 1% Pt–1.67% Sn-fresh catalyst, the C 1s spectrum is composed of five peaks that correspond to the signals from dehydrogenated carbon species (DHC) (∼282.4 eV) [40], carbon bonded to C or H in adventitious hydrocarbon (∼284.6 eV), hydrogenated carbon species in aliphatic polymers CxHy (∼285.7 eV), oxidized carbon in ketone groups –CO (∼287.2 eV), and oxidized carbon in carboxyl groups O–CO (∼289.2 eV) [41]. After the reaction, one new peak with a binding energy at ∼283.9 eV appears in the XPS spectra from 1% Pt-spent and 1% Pt–1.67% Sn-spent catalysts. The dominant percent area of this peak in the XPS spectra indicates that the surfaces of the spent catalysts are almost completely covered by these species.
The binding energy of some transition metallic carbides such as Fe3C, Mo2C, WC, and Cr7C3 has a value in the range of 283.1–283.9 eV [27]. Consequently, it can be deduced that the binding energy at 283.9 eV on 1% Pt-spent and 1% Pt–1.67% Sn-spent catalysts may derive from platinum carbide. However, the solubility of carbon in bulk Pt is very low, and solubility requires the high temperature (∼1700 °C) and long contact time (∼12 h) [42] that exceed reaction temperature in this study. We suggest that the C 1s peak at 283.9 eV on 1% Pt-spent and 1% Pt–1.67% Sn-spent catalysts does not originate from platinum carbide as a small amount of carbide compound with Sn (zero-valent) would probably also be formed. Consequently, the 283.9 eV band is an unusual binding energy of coke which probably comes from the carbon structure known as “pregraphite-like carbon” as was previously mentioned in the XRD characterization. This lower grade of graphite order has a certain degree of organization as shown in the XRD patterns. The pregraphite-like carbon was also observed in the C 1s XPS spectra with a binding energy at 283.2 eV during the conversion of methane to benzene over a Mo/H-ZSM-5 catalyst [43]. From the XRD and XPS analyses, we believe that the coke on the Pt–Sn/Al2O3 has the same structure as on the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst; consequently, the addition of Sn has no influence on coke structure.
3.3. Coke location
The TGA technique allows a determination of the coke location on supported metal catalysts, and the results are shown in Fig. 6. Two successive peaks are observed in the TGA profile of 1% Pt-spent catalysts after deactivation for 160 min on stream. The TGA profile was fitted using Gaussian curves to determine the temperature of the first and second oxidation peaks (at the shoulder). At least two peaks are observed in the TPO profile of the four spent catalysts and the portion of the peaks is dependent on Sn contents; the oxidation temperatures of the main peaks are shifted from 465 to 513 °C.

Generally, in paraffin dehydrogenation process at high temperature, the TPO profile of spent Pt/Al2O3 catalyst consists of two peaks corresponding to two locations of coke. The first (lower temperature) and second peaks (higher temperature) are assigned to coke located on the metal and on the support, respectively. The electronic properties of the Pt surface are changed by the addition of tin, which decreases the strength of the bond between the adsorbed hydrocarbon species and the platinum surface. This electronic effect leads to a transfer of coke from the metal to the support and therefore to differences in the coke locations between the catalysts [44].
In our study, it is observed that the peak positions of coke oxidation in TPO profiles are systematically shifted to higher temperatures along with Sn contents. Accordingly, the presence of Sn induces the shift of coke oxidation temperature to higher because Sn addition accelerates the transfer of coke to the support. Our observation is very similar to the data reported by Liwu et al. [44] that investigated dynamic process of carbon deposition on Pt and Pt–Sn supported alumina catalysts used for dehydrogenation of n-butane with H2 adding in the feedstock. These results indicate that the fraction of coke on Pt metallic phase is suppressed significantly after Sn is added to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. The spillover of coke from Pt metallic phase to the support plays an important role in catalytic stability as the encapsulation of Pt metallic phase by coke diminishes by Sn addition and the higher portion of active sites on Pt metallic phase in the 1% Pt–1.67% Sn catalyst keep alive during the reaction [45].
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, Sn modifies the electronic properties of Pt allowing better coke tolerance and a catalytic performance comparable to monometallic catalysts. XRD and XPS analyses reveal that coke from all spent catalysts had the same pregraphite-like carbon structure and was not affected by Sn addition. Tin addition leads to transfer of coke from the metal to the support, with the ratio of coke fraction on the metal to support deceasing significantly. The lowest coke content on the 1% Pt–1.67% Sn catalyst is due to inhibition of Sn on low coordination sites on the Pt surface.
