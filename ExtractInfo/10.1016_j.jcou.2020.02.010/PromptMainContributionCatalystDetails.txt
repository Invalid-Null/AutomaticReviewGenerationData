1. Introduction
Propene is a very important raw material for the industrial chemical production such as polypropene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, etc. [1]. Propane dehydrogenation is currently considered to an appealing strategy for scalable production of propene. The direct dehydrogenation of propane is usually catalyzed by Pt- and Cr2O3-based catalysts. High temperature is typically demanded for achieving high propane conversion because of the thermodynamic equilibrium limit. Unfortunately, this would result in poor propene selectivity and undesirable cokes, due to CC bands are more readily to crack as compared with C–H bands at high reaction temperature [2]. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with oxygen (O2-ODHP) is an exothermic reaction, which can reduce the energy consumption and eliminate the deposited carbon, but inevitably lead to the over-oxidation. In contrast, CO2 as a weak oxidant could limit deep oxidation [3,4], and thereby enable preferable propene selectivity at high propane conversions. Up to now, considerable researches have been focused on the exploitation of efficient catalysts for CO2-based oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP) to propene. Among these catalysts, bi-functional materials, e.g., zeolite-loaded transition metals or metal oxides have displayed enhanced activity and selectivity through the cooperative interaction between active metal sites and porous support [3,5]. Considering the coupling effect of reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) pathway with dehydrogenation reaction, a composite oxide catalyst with high densities of surface acidity and basicity was also designed to achieve high propane conversion [6,7] In addition, a membrane system was currently exploited to improve the catalytic performances by shifting the reaction equilibrium.
The active components of reported catalysts are mainly composed of V-, Mn- and Ce-based catalysts with multiple redox states and IIIA oxides (e.g. Ga2O3 and In2O3) [[8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]]. Besides the commonly used oxides, nitride compounds constitute another important series of heterogeneous catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane [[18], [19], [20], [21]]. Hermans et al. reported that the BN nanotubes and hexagonal BN exhibited unique and exceptional catalytic performances in the O2-ODHP at reaction temperature lower than 490 °C [22]. This finding demonstrated that the nitride compounds possessed potential catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes. Recently, Li et al. discovered that the commercially available GaN fine powders showed relatively high selectivity and stability for the conversion of alkanes to benzene under mild conditions [23,24]. However, the distribution and large particle size of GaN in the reaction system would restrict the effective contact of active sites with the reactant alkanes, which might mostly account for the low yield of the target product. Based on these researches, we infer that GaN might be an active phase for the activation of C–H bonds of light alkanes in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. In addition, GaN is a non-toxic and non-noble metal material and can replace toxic Cr-based or precious Pt-based catalysts in the industrial propene production via the dehydrogenation of propane.
It is well known that the particle size and dispersion of active phase play a major role in its catalytic performances. Accordingly, the synthesis of small-sized and well-dispersed GaN nanoparticle catalyst is one of the key factors for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. The conventional routes to prepare GaN particles mainly include the thermal treatment of metallic gallium or gallium oxides/hydroxide with NH3, the solvothermal decomposition of urea-complex of gallium precursor, the sol-gel and the molecular-beam-epitaxy growth methods [[25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]]. Unfortunately, most of these reported approaches caused several serious problems such as high cost, severe equipment corrosion, time-consuming, environment pollution and higher reaction temperature of 800 °C. Herein, we reported a facile route to prepare pure GaN and GaN supported on Q-x (SiO2 support with varying pore size) catalysts for the first time by using gallium nitrate hydrate and melamine as the Ga precursor and N source, respectively. The effects of synthetic parameters on the crystal structures of gallium species were systematically investigated. Upon being used in CO2-ODHP, the GaN/Q-x catalysts show good activity and high propene selectivity as well as excellent stability.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials
All reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Gallium nitrate hydrate and melamine were obtained from Macklin Inc., China. The feed gases including C3H8 (99.99 %), CO2 (99.99 %) and N2 (99.99 %) were supplied by Longteng Chemical Co., Ltd., China. Q-x (x = 3, 15, 30 and 50) supports and their porous parameters were received from Fuji Silysia Chemical Ltd., Japan (details are listed in Table S1 in supporting information). The commercially available Q-3 supports were further characterized by a Hitachi SU-8020 microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyzer (Fig. S1). The analysis indicates that the sphere-like Q-3 is composed of pure SiO2.
2.2. The preparation of GaN
Typically, a certain amount of gallium nitrate hydrate and melamine solids were mixed and thoroughly grinded in an agate mortar. For comparison, these two precursors were also ultrasonically dispersed in methanol and subsequently dried at 100 °C overnight. Afterwards, the ground mixture or dried white solid was calcined at 800–900 °C in 20 mL min−1 of N2 flow rate for 1–8 h. After being cooled to 550 °C, the N2 flow was switched to air and further calcined for 1 h. The final sample (obtained by the solid grinding method unless it was specified) was designed as GaN-m-n-t with m, n and t representing the mass ratio of melamine to gallium nitrate hydrate (0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4), the heating temperature and the calcination time, respectively. For instance, the sample prepared at the mass ratio of melamine/gallium nitrate hydrate = 4/1, and calcined at 800 °C for 1 h in N2 and subsequent at 550 °C for 1 h in air was labeled as GaN-4-800-1.
2.3. The preparation of GaN/Q-x catalysts
Basically, the melamine and gallium nitrate hydrate at a mass ratio of 0.5 were dispersed into a beaker containing 15 mL of methanol, and then the Q-x (x = 3, 15, 30 and 50) support was added. After that, the mixture was sonicated at room temperature for 10 min, and then dried at 100 °C for 10 h in an oven. The dried white powder was transferred into a corundum crucible and subsequently heated to 800 °C over 10 h in N2 and held at this temperature for 1 h. Finally, it was calcined at 550 °C for 1 h in air to remove carbon residue. The obtained catalysts were denoted as y-GaN/Q-x, where y refers to the content of GaN (1, 3, 5, 10 and 20 wt %) loading on Q-x support.
2.4. Catalyst characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) data were recorded on a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα radiation (40 kV and 40 mA). The nitrogen adsorption-desorption measurements of samples were carried out at −196 °C on a BelSorp-Max instrument. Prior to the analysis, the sample was degassed at 300 °C for 8 h under vacuum. The surface area was calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. The morphologies and microstructures of samples were characterized by a Hitachi SU-8020 field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and a JEM-2100 transmission electron microscopy (TEM), respectively. High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) observation and selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of representative catalyst were performed on a Tecnai G2 F20 apparatus operating at 200 kV. The particle size distributions of GaN were determined by measuring randomly selected particles from SEM images. Elemental analysis was performed on a Vario EL III elemental analyzer. The coke amount of used catalyst was determined by thermogravimetric (TG) analysis on a Q600SDT apparatus. The sample was heated to target temperature at a ramping rate of 10 °C min−1 in air. The ultraviolet and visible (UV–vis) diffuse reflectance spectra were taken on a Lamda 950 spectrometer (PerkinElmer) with BaSO4 as the reflectance sample. The spectra were recorded at room temperature in the range from 200 to 800 nm. The Raman spectra of used catalysts were acquired on a confocal microprobe laser Raman spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) equipped with an argon-ion laser at the excitation wavelength of 532 nm at ambient temperature. Temperature-programmed oxidation of oxygen (O2-TPO) of used catalyst was carried out on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 instrument and the CO2 signal was detected with a mass spectrometer (HPR-20 EGA). Temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD) and temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) were detected by a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 chemisorption analyzer with a thermal conductivity detector. The Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) spectra of pyridine adsorption was acquired on a Bruker VERTEX70 spectrometer with a gas cell. Each spectrum of sample was obtained by subtracting the corresponding base spectrum.
The feed gas mixture (the molar ratio of CO2/H2/He = 1/1/2) pulse experiment was performed at 600 °C on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 analyzer connected with a Hiden QIC-20 mass spectrometer. First, 0.1 g of catalyst was placed into a U-type quartz reactor and then the temperature was heated to 600 °C over 60 min in He flow. After holding at this temperature for 30 min to stabilize the baseline, a consecutive 0.5 mL of pulse gas was injected and reacted over the catalyst. The temporary signal changes for effluent gases were monitored by scanning the ions of CO2 (m/z = 44), CO (m/z = 28), H2O (m/z = 18) and H2 (m/z = 2).
2.5. Catalytic activity evaluation
The activity, selectivity and stability of all catalysts were measured in a fixed-bed stainless steel tubular reactor (8 mm i.d and 300 mm in length). For each run, 0.2 g of catalyst (40–60 mesh) diluted with 0.5 g of quartz sand (40–60 mesh) were placed in the middle of the reactor. The total feed gas mixture (30 mL min−1) with molar composition of C3H8/CO2/N2 = 1/2/7 passed through the catalyst bed. The existing stream (target product: C3H6; by-products: CH4, C2H6, C2H4) was analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC-9560) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector. A blank run without the catalyst revealed that the homogeneous reaction of the starting feed reactants could be ignored under the experimental conditions. The conversion, selectivity and yield of catalyst were calculated as follows:
C3H8 conversion = (FinC3H8 - FoutC3H8)/(FinC3H8) × 100 %,
C3H6 selectivity = (FoutC3H6)/(FinC3H8 - FoutC3H8) × 100 %,
C3H6 yield = C3H8 conversion × C3H6 selectivity × 100 %,
where FinC3H8, FoutC3H8 and FoutC3H6 are the molar flow rate of propane inlet, propane outlet and propene outlet, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Effects of the synthetic conditions on the formation of GaN
The effect of calcination temperature on the crystal structures of gallium species was first investigated. The corresponding XRD patterns of obtained samples are shown in Fig. 1a. When the calcination temperature is 700 °C, the characteristic diffraction peaks of prepared sample are assigned to Ga2O3 with low crystallinity [31]. If the calcination temperature was increased to 800 and 850 °C, 2θ at 32°, 35°, 37°, 48°, 57°, 64°, 69° and 71° of obtained two samples were indexed to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (112) and (201) diffraction peaks of pure GaN with hexagonal wurtzite structure, respectively [25]. Upon further increasing the calcination temperature to 900 °C, the characteristic peaks of metallic Ga appeared except for the main GaN phase, which implied the coexistence of GaN and Ga species in sample. So, the suitable calcination temperature for preparing GaN are within 800–850 °C. The effect of mass ratio of melamine to gallium nitrate hydrate on crystal structure of GaN was also studied (Fig. S2a). It was found that if the mass ratio of melamine to gallium nitrate hydrate was lower than 0.5, no characteristic diffraction peaks of GaN was identified, while excessive amounts of melamine seemed to have no distinguishable effect on the crystallinity of GaN. Moreover, the effect of calcination time on the GaN crystallinity is shown in Fig. S2b. It can be seen that the peak intensity of GaN sample gradually increased with increasing the calcination time from 1 to 8 h. This suggests that the prolonged calcination time is beneficial to the improvement of GaN crystallinity. In addition, the XRD patterns of samples obtained by the solid grinding and methanol-assisted dispersion of melamine and gallium nitrate hydrate are shown in Fig. S2c. The diffraction peaks of these two samples are almost the same, indicative of the usability for GaN synthesis via either the solid grinding or the methanol-assisted dispersion routes. However, after being supported on Q-x support, there is no distinguished characteristic peaks of GaN in XRD patterns when the loading amount of GaN is less than 20 wt % (Fig. 1b), possibly due to the low content and uniform dispersion of GaN species [32].

3.2. Morphologies and structures of obtained samples
The SEM images of GaN prepared in different conditions are shown in Fig. S3. It can be seen that the spherical-shaped GaN nanoparticles closely arranged into clusters with different sizes. Indeed, GaN nanoparticles aggregated to a larger degree with an increase of calcination temperature from 800 to 850 °C (Fig. S3a and b). By comparison, the average particle size (Da) of GaN slightly increased as the calcination time was prolonged (Fig. S4). However, the change in the mass ratio of nitrogen to gallium precursors did not have a significant effect on the size of GaN nanoparticles (Fig. S4). Likewise, no distinct difference in shape was observed for both GaN-4-800-1 samples prepared via the solid grinding and the methanol-assisted dispersion routes (Fig. S3a and i), which further confirmed the possible replacement of solvent-assisted dispersion by physical mixture route in the GaN preparation process. In addition, the signals of Ga and N elements were evenly distributed in the obtained GaN sample (inset in Fig. S5a), indicating the homogenization of Ga-N bonds. An extremely O signal was also present in the EDX diagram and XPS spectrum (Fig. S5b), probably because of the chemisorbed water on sample surface [33].
From Fig. 2a and c, we can see that GaN-4-800-1 sample with the particle size around 20 nm were stacked into large aggregations. The inset of Fig. 2d shows the well-resolved lattice distance of 0.19 nm, which could be attributed to (102) crystal plane of wurtzite-structured GaN [34]. At the same time, the diffuse rings of GaN-4-800-1 sample are concentric, evidencing its polycrystalline structure (inset in Fig. 2c). Moreover, a slight amount of amorphous carbon on the edge of the as-synthesized sample was distinct in Fig. 2b (marked with a red circle), but which completely disappeared after being heated in air (Fig. S6). This indicated that the formed carbon species (<2 wt % from elemental analysis) on GaN surface could be burnt off through the post-treatment without destructing GaN crystalline structure. In fact, the oxidation-resistant ability of GaN sample was also tested with TG analysis (Fig. S7a). It can be seen that the weight loss of GaN sample was negligible before 600 °C excluding the moisture removal and carbon combustion, while the sample weight gradually increased by increasing the heating temperature above 650 °C due to partial oxidation of GaN in air flow. In addition, there is no remarkable difference in the position of XRD characteristic peaks for GaN-4-800-1 before and after calcination treatment in air (Fig. S7b). This proves that suitable heating treatment in air has little effect on the crystal structure of obtained GaN. Thus, the as-formed GaN could be further purified by a facile heating treatment lower than 650 °C in air, which can effectively eliminate carbon residue in sample and avoid undesired oxidation. Fig. 2e displays that GaN nanoparticles with size less than 10 nm were well dispersed on Q-3 support. According to this feature, GaN/Q-3 catalyst was expected to exhibit much better catalytic performances in contrast with the bulk GaN.

The textural properties of samples were determined by nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements, and the corresponding structural parameters were listed in Table S1. It can be seen that GaN-0.5-800-1 displays the typical type III isotherm with an H3 hysteresis loop (Fig. S8a), indicative of its considerable mesoporous and/or macroporous structure [35]. The corresponding pore size distribution also depicts the porosities almost within the mesoporous domains (Fig. S8b). The interstitial porosities between interconnected GaN nanoparticles are mainly responsible for this porous nature. GaN-0.5-800-1 sample exhibits a specific surface area and pore volume of 25 m2 g–1 and 0.1 cm3 g–1, respectively. Fig. 3a shows the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of 5-GaN/Q-x (x = 3, 15, 30 and 50). Clearly, the specific surface areas of Q-3 and Q-15 supports remain nearly similar before and after loading GaN. In contrast, considerable increase in the surface areas occurred to Q-30 and Q-50, probably owning to the most distribution of GaN nanoparticles inside their pores. Furthermore, the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra of GaN-0.5-800-1, Q-3, and 5-GaN/Q-3 were presented in Fig. 3b. The band-gap values of these samples were accordingly determined by the linear extrapolation of the high slope of the corresponding curves (insert of Fig. 3b). The absorption peak position of pure GaN-0.5-800-1 and 5-GaN/Q-3 are 350 and 232 nm, and the corresponding band gap was increased from 3.1 to 3.4 eV, which further confirmed that the GaN particle size was dramatically reduced after being supported on Q-3 support.

3.3. Catalytic performance testing for CO2-ODHP
Fig. 4a shows the catalytic performance comparison for CO2-ODHP over GaN-0.5-800-1, Q-3 and 5-GaN/Q-3 catalysts with the presence of CO2. Obviously, the catalytic activity for the propane conversion was remarkably increased from 11 % for pure GaN to 31 % for 5-GaN/Q-3 catalyst. Furthermore, both bare Q-3 and pure GaN alone exhibit extremely poor propane conversion and low selectivity towards propene. However, the catalytic performances of GaN nanoparticles were greatly improved upon being dispersed on Q-3 support, which directly implied the synergetic interaction between GaN species and Q-3 support. The enhanced catalytic properties of 5-GaN/Q-3 were attributed to more medium-strong acidic sites (surface coordinately unsaturated Ga3+ species) of small-sized GaN [14,37] and efficient affinity to CO2 in nanopore-rich Q-3 support (Figs. S9).

Fig. 4. Catalytic performance comparisons of control catalysts (a), 5-GaN/Q-x (x = 3, 15, 30 and 50) (b), and y-GaN/Q-3 (y = 1, 3, 5, 10 and 20) (c) at 600 °C with the molar ratio of C3H8/CO2/N2 = 1/2/7, and dependence of CO2 on catalytic properties of 5-GaN/Q-3 at a given temperature of 600 °C (d).
Generally, the catalytic performances of supported catalyst strongly depend on the dispersion of active species, which is closely related to the type of support. Fig. 4b shows the effect of Q-x (x = 3, 15, 30 and 50) support on the catalytic activity of GaN for CO2-ODHP. It can be seen that all 5-GaN/Q-x catalysts display a similar propene selectivity of ca. 93 %, while the 5-GaN/Q-3 shows the highest propane conversion of 31 %, possible due to its larger support surface area of 550 m2 g−1. In this regard, SBA-15 with much larger surface area of 707 m2 g−1 supported the same amount of GaN was expected to exhibit much better activity. However, GaN species loaded on SBA-15 only affords a comparable propane conversion with that on Q-15 support (not shown). This results from the more narrow nanopores in Q-3 which possess stronger CO2 affinity ability (Fig. S9) because of its enhanced adsorption potential in contrast to mesoporous SBA-15 or Q-x (x = 15, 30 and 50), which favors the RWGS reaction and thus enables an excellent catalytic activity in CO2-ODHP.
In addition, the effects of GaN loading amount on catalytic properties of samples are displayed in Fig. 4c. It is found that 5-GaN/Q-3 gave the highest propane conversion despite high propene selectivity for all y-GaN/Q-3 (y = 1, 3, 5, 10 and 20) catalysts during the tested 10 h. When the GaN loading amounts are as low as 1% and 3%, these catalysts may have insufficient active sites and therefore low catalytic activities. The propane conversion reached the maximum value as the GaN loading amount was increased to 5%, but gradually decreased with further increasing the loading amount of GaN to 10 % and 20 %. This is because that appropriate amounts of gallium species (ca. 5%) could be well dispersed in Q-3 support and exposed substantial active sites. However, the excessive loading easily caused undesired growth of GaN particles in 10-GaN/Q-3 and 20-GaN/Q-3, and thus led to low activity due to the decrease in the number of unsaturated gallium species [38]. So, the optimal loading content of GaN on Q-3 support is 5%. It is worth noting that the 5-GaN/Q-3 catalyst exhibits a good propane conversion (31 %), a high propene selectivity (93 %) and a high propene yield (29 %), which is superior to those obtained from most of previously reported catalysts in CO2-ODHP (Table S2). In addition, the equilibrium conversions of propane and the composition of CO, C3H6, H2 and H2O formed in final products at 100–800 °C with the molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 = 2/1 were calculated (Fig. S10). It is found that the equilibrium conversion of propane is ca. 32 % at 600 °C under atmospheric pressure, being close to the value that obtained on 5-GaN/Q-3 catalyst.
The catalytic performances for direct dehydrogenation and CO2 oxidation dehydrogenation of propane over 5-GaN/Q-3 catalyst are also illustrated in Fig. 4d. In most cases, the propane conversion in CO2 atmosphere was greatly improved as compared with that (23 %) in direct propane dehydrogenation process over 5-GaN/Q-3 catalyst, meanwhile the selectivity to propene was also slightly enhanced. This might result from the promotion action of RWGS reaction [39,40], confirmed by the pulse experiment that the signals of CO and H2O appeared accompanied with the consumption of injected CO2 and H2 (Fig. 5a). In such a way, both propane conversion and propene selectivity could be immediately enhanced almost as soon as a suitable amount of CO2 was introduced into the reaction system (Fig. 5b). Moreover, the maximum value of propane conversion was increased from 26 % to 31 % with increasing the CO2/C3H8 molar ratio from 1/1 to 2/1, but which decreased to 23 % upon further increasing the molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 to 4/1 due to the possible competitive adsorption of propane with excessive CO2 molecules [6,41]. Therefore, the activity of 5-GaN/Q-3 catalyst in CO2-ODHP could be optimized by adjusting the molar ratio of CO2/C3H8 = 2/1 during the whole reaction process.

3.4. The role of CO2 and reaction mechanism
The stability and regeneration of catalyst were also considered for a potential application as an industrial catalyst. Fig. 6a shows that 5-GaN/Q-3 catalyst offers a propane conversion of 22 % with the propene selectivity of 86 % even after 40 h. Moreover, the activity of used catalyst after 20 h could return to its initial value after regeneration treatment (Fig. 6b). It is well known that undesirable coke deposited on active sites is the main reason for catalyst deactivation in CO2-ODHP [[42], [43], [44]]. Herein, the used 5-GaN/Q-3 catalyst was closely inspected through HRTEM, and some carbon species were clearly observed on the surface of catalyst (Fig. 2f). Furthermore, the used 5-GaN/Q-3 catalysts tested in different reactant gas mixture were analyzed with TG. It is found that 9.6 wt % of carbon combustion occurred to used 5-GaN/Q-3 catalyst without CO2, while the value is 5.7 wt % for the used 5-GaN/Q-3 catalyst with CO2 (Fig. 7a). This indicated that CO2 could effectively inhibit the carbon deposition on the surface of catalyst during the reaction process, as further confirmed by much less peak area of CO2 signal in O2-TPO profile for the used catalyst with CO2 (Fig. S11). To further check for the nature of carbon species in used catalyst, Raman spectra of these two catalysts were illustrated in Fig. 7b. Two peaks at 1350 and 1610 cm−1 could be ascribed to D-band (amorphous carbon) and G-band (graphitic carbon), respectively [45]. The intensity ratio of D-band to G-band can be used to evaluate the graphitization degree of deposited carbon species. It is found that higher proportion of graphitic carbon was deposited over used 5-GaN/Q-3 catalyst with CO2. As a result, CO2 plays a positive role in limiting carbon deposition in CO2-ODHP, while the corresponding deposited coke with a higher graphitization degree was formed on the surface of catalyst.

The possible reaction mechanism for CO2-ODHP over GaN/Q-x catalysts was also proposed in Fig. 8. Surface coordinately-unsaturated Ga3+ species in GaN sample would act as Lewis acidic sites for activating the C–H bonds in propane, derived from the pyridine FTIR and NH3-TPD analyses (Fig. S12). The heterolytic dissociation process for propane initiated in an energetically-favorable alkyl adsorption way [23]. Then, the C–H bonds were weakened and broken due to the strong local polarization between Ga3+ and N3− ions, accompanying by the formation of propene and H2. The generated H2 was finally consumed mainly through the RWGS reaction. In the whole process, narrow-nanopores-rich Q-3 support could afford more available medium-strong basic sites (terminal hydroxyl groups), stronger affinity to CO2 molecules and higher CO2 adsorption, thus promoting the dehydrogenation activity. As a result, the acid-base cooperative interaction between GaN and Q support might account for the catalysis mechanism.

4. Conclusions
The GaN nanoparticles can be prepared via a facile solid-phased reaction with gallium nitrate hydrate and melamine as the gallium and nitrogen precursors, respectively. The crystal structure of prepared GaN is highly dependent on the synthetic conditions. The obtained GaN nanoparticles are active for catalyzing the CO2-ODHP and their catalytic performances were remarkably improved upon being dispersed on Q support. In particular, 5-GaN/Q-3 catalyst shows a high propane conversion of 31 % with a propene selectivity of 93 % and excellent reusability through an easy calcination treatment in air. It was proposed that the synergetic interactions of small particle size and well dispersion of GaN and efficient affinity to CO2 in the nanopores of Q-3 support contribute to the enhanced catalytic performances. More important, the inherent catalytic activity of the low-cost and commercial available Q supported GaN make it possible for its large-scale synthesis and potential industrial application in CO2-ODHP. Further work is currently undergoing to probe the possible reaction pathways over GaN-based catalyst.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
