Synthesis of C4- and C5-olefins by novel alkane dehydrogenation with H2S co-feeding
In our previous study, an iron-supported silica (Fe/SiO2) catalyst exhibiting excellent activity toward propane dehydrogenation with hydrogen sulfide (H2S) co-feeding was identified. This study investigated the potential application of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst for the dehydrogenation of relatively larger molecules, such as iso-pentane (iso-C5), n-pentane (n-C5), and n-butane (n-C4). The reactivity evaluation showed that Fe/SiO2 exhibited a high activity toward iso-C5 dehydrogenation with H2S co-feeding, producing iso-amylenes, such as 2-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-2-butene, and isoprene. The total C5-olefin yield obtained using the Fe/SiO2 catalyst was higher than that obtained using Co/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts. When Fe/SiO2 was applied to the dehydrogenation of n-C4 and n-C5 with H2S co-feeding, C4- and C5-olefins were obtained, respectively, with relatively high selectivities. In particular, the Fe/SiO2-catalyzed n-C4 dehydrogenation exhibited greater selectivity than iso-C5 and n-C5 dehydrogenations; the product of the n-C4 dehydrogenation was stable for 20 h.
1. Introduction
Isoprene, or 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene, is an important monomer used in the production of synthetic rubber, fine chemicals, and resins. In particular, rubber synthesized from isoprene has physical properties similar to that of natural rubber and is known as “natural synthetic rubber.” The annual production of isoprene is approximately 0.8 million metric tons, and its annual demand is expected to reach 1.6 million tons by 2030 [1], [2]. Isoprene is mainly produced by the extraction and separation of pentane (C5) fractions from the effluent gas obtained during the steam cracking (SC) of naphtha. However, the amount of isoprene produced is highly dependent on the demand for ethylene, because ethylene is the main product of SC. Moreover, ethylene production from inexpensive shale gas may reduce the number of SC operations, resulting in decreased isoprene production. Isopentane (iso-C5), one of the compounds obtained in the SC fractions, has a low utilization value. Therefore, iso-C5 dehydrogenation (C5H12 → C5H8 + 2H2) could be an attractive alternative process to produce isoprene.
Diolefins, such as isoprene and butadiene, can be produced using the following two methods: (1) a one-step dehydrogenation reaction in which the alkanes are directly converted to diolefins; (2) a two-step process in which the mono-olefines are first produced, and then subsequently dehydrogenated to diolefins. Specifically, in the two-step process, iso-C5 is first dehydrogenated to produce 2-methyl-1-butene, which is then further dehydrogenated in the next step to obtain isoprene. The advantage of the two-step process is that an appropriate catalyst can be used in each step, allowing the selective synthesis of the desired product [3], [4]. On the contrary, Shell Co. Ltd. and ExxonMobil Co. Ltd. produce isoprene via the one-step dehydrogenation of a mixture of iso-C5 and iso-pentene, owing to its cost effectiveness [5], [6], [7].
In recent years, many studies have reported the excellent catalytic activities of vanadium oxide, gallium oxide, tungsten oxide, indium oxide, and iron phosphide for the dehydrogenation of low-carbon-number alkanes, such as ethane and propane [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. However, only a few catalysts have been reported for the dehydrogenation of alkanes with high carbon numbers, such as iso-C5. Armendariz et al. investigated the catalytic performance of Pt-Sn supported on Mg-Al-O mixed oxide for the dehydrogenation of iso-C5 [15]. The Pt-Sn catalyst exhibited a conversion rate of 36%, a total selectivity of 82% for iso-amylenes (2-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-2-butene, and 3-methyl-1-butene), and a total selectivity of 8% for other C5-olefins including isoprene, indicating the selective dehydrogenation of iso-C5 to iso-amylenes. The dehydrogenation of iso-C5 in the presence of oxygen is called oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH, C5H12 + O2→ C5H8 + 2 H2O), which is more advantageous than simple dehydrogenation, because it is an exothermic reaction with no equilibrium constraints. Valenzuela et al. reported the excellent dehydrogenation performance of a vanadium catalyst supported on MgO for the ODH of iso-C5, with a 22% conversion rate, 19% isoprene selectivity, and 22% iso-amylene selectivity [16]. Although the isoprene and iso-amylene selectivities are relatively high at low temperatures, the selectivities for the CO and CO2 by-products increase with increasing temperature in the ODH of iso-C5. To suppress the increase in selectivity of the COx by-products, a fluidized-bed dehydrogenation system was developed, and the C5-olefin selectivity was enhanced [17].
Metal sulfides have attracted attention as catalysts for the selective dehydrogenation of C4-alkanes [18], [19], [20]. It was assumed that the metal sulfides activate the C–H bond in alkanes without breaking the C–C bond, thereby suppressing the side reaction of alkane cracking and achieving highly selective dehydrogenation. However, these metal sulfides lose their lattice sulfur (S2-) owing to the reducing atmosphere in the reaction system. The loss of S2- in metal sulfides can be avoided by using excess hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which has the unique property of decomposing into H2 and S2- on various metal components [21]. In the petrochemical industry, hydrodesulfurization is performed to remove sulfur species from petroleum products; a large quantity of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas is produced during this process. This H2S is generally removed using the Claus process (2H2S + O2 → 2S +2H2O). However, the global sulfur supplies would exceed their demand by approximately five million metric tons, which is more than twice the current level of sulfur oversupply. Sulfur is chemically reactive and acid producing, and the chemical waste management of excess sulfur can become a major problem for the petroleum industry. Proactive management of sulfur waste can help the oil and gas industry by producing large quantities of sulfur and providing access to untapped sulfur resources. The effective use of H2S is expected to reduce the chemical waste of sulfur compounds [22].
Our research group has investigated the effect of H2S co-feeding on propane dehydrogenation to avoid the loss of S2- in metal sulfide catalysts [23], [24]. The catalytic performances of silica-supported Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Mn were investigated, of which the Fe-, Co-, and Ni-loaded catalysts showed good dehydrogenation performances. In particular, the iron-based catalyst (Fe/SiO2) exhibited a high dehydrogenation activity and high selectivity toward propylene production.
In this study, we applied the Fe/SiO2 catalyst for the dehydrogenation of iso-C5 to produce C5-olefins, which are valuable materials for isoprene production. The catalytic performance of Fe/SiO2 was then compared to that of other transition metal (Co, Ni) catalysts. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst were carried out to investigate the reactivity and the bulk and surface properties of the catalysts. To consider the role of H2S on dehydrogenation performance, DFT calculation was performed for identifying reaction mechanism on the Fe/SiO2 catalyst. In addition, we investigated the potential application of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst for the dehydrogenation of relatively larger alkanes, such as n-pentane (n-C5) and n-butane (n-C4).
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The Fe/SiO2 catalyst was prepared using an impregnation method. The SiO2 support (JRC-SIO-4) was supplied by the Catalysis Society of Japan. After 6 h of immersion in distilled water (2 g), 1.6237 g of iron (III) nitrate nonahydrate was added, and the mixture was stirred for another 2 h. Subsequently, the catalyst slurry was dried at 80 °C. The iron-based catalyst was then calcined at 500 °C for 1 h. For the preparation of Co- and Ni-based catalysts, cobalt (II) nitrate hexahydrate and nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate were used as precursors, respectively. The precursors were dissolved in distilled water, followed by the impregnation of the catalytic components on the SiO2 support. The loading of transition metals (Fe, Co, and Ni) was 10 wt%.
2.2. Evaluation of catalyst performance
A fixed-bed reactor was used to evaluate the catalytic performance. After the catalyst was installed at the center of the reactor tube, the temperature was raised to 600 °C under a helium (He) atmosphere. Then, the Fe/SiO2 catalyst was pre-sulfurized with a mixed gas (H2/H2S/He = 2.5/2.5/45 ml·min−1) at 600 °C for 30 min. The reaction temperature was then set to 550–600 °C under atmospheric pressure, and subsequently, the composition of the reaction gas was set to iso-C5/H2S/He = 5/x/45-x ml·min−1 (x = 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10). The reaction and product gases were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC) and a flame ionization detector (FID) (columns: VZ-7, TC-BOND Alumina/Na2SO4). (1), (2) were used to calculate the conversion rate of iso-C5 and the yield of each component.

2.3. Characterization of the catalysts
The amounts of deposited carbon and sulfur species in the catalyst after the reaction were measured using an element analyzer (Flash EA 1112, Thermo Fisher Electron Inc., USA). During the measurement, 1.5 mg of the catalyst was placed in an aluminum foil cup. The amounts of deposited carbon and sulfur species in the catalyst were measured by increasing the 25–950 °C at a ramping rate of 30 °C·min−1. The amounts of coke and sulfur species deposited on the catalyst were calculated based on the COx and SOx gases detected by the GC-FID-methanizer. The crystalline structure of the prepared catalyst was determined by XRD analysis using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å, Ultima IV; Rigaku Inc., Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 40 kV and a current of 40 mA. The XRD measurements were conducted at a scanning speed of 2.0° min−1 and a step size of 0.01° step−1. All diffraction peaks of the sample were characterized using standard crystallographic data. To investigate the oxidation state of the sulfur species on M/SiO2 (M: Fe, Co, Ni) catalysts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; Axis Ultra DLD; Shimadzu Inc., Japan) was performed using monochromatic Mg Kα radiation. Peaks of S2p and C1s were recorded at a binding energy interval of 0.1 eV. The binding energy was referenced to C1s = 284.7 eV. The residual gas pressure in the spectrometer chamber was close to 10−9 mbar during data acquisition. The obtained XPS spectra were characterized by fitting Gaussian curves to the peaks after background subtraction.
2.4. DFT calculation
The nudged elastic band (NEB) calculation is performed to estimate the reaction barrier by assuming the starting and ending states of the reaction. The calculations were carried out using Quantum ESPRESSO and Advance/NanoLabo, employing the pseudopotential method of plane-wave basis functions and GGA-PBE as the exchange-correlation functional. The parameters of the calculation, such as the cutoff energy of the wave function/charge density and the k-point sampling, were optimized in the calculation. These calculation conditions were shown in each data.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic performance of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst
The effect of reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of Fe/SiO2 during iso-C5 dehydrogenation with H2S co-feeding was investigated. Fig. 1(a) shows the product yields of the dehydrogenation at reaction temperatures of 550–600 °C, and Fig. 1(b) summarizes the conversion rate, total yield of the C5-olefins, and selectivity of the reaction toward C5-olefins. Fig. 1(c) shows the selectivity of the produced C5-olefins. To highlight the effect of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst, the data of the dehydrogenation reaction performed without the catalyst are also shown in Fig. 1(a). Although C5-olefins were not obtained in the absence of the catalyst, C5-olefins, such as isoprene, and iso-amylenes, such as 2-methyl-1-butene and 2-methyl-2-butene, were produced in the presence of Fe/SiO2. It was assumed that the Fe/SiO2 catalyst did not produce C1–C4 molecules, because the decomposed-product yield of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst was approximately the same as that produced under the blank reaction. The formation of C5-olefins was accelerated by increasing the reaction temperature; however, the total selectivity of C5-olefins slightly decreased because the decomposition reaction was more accelerated than the dehydrogenation of iso-C5. As shown in Fig. 1(c), by increasing the reaction temperature, the selectivity for isoprene increased with a decrease in the selectivity for 2-methyl-1-butene and 2-methyl-2-butene. This result suggests that the sequential dehydrogenation of mono-olefins progressed with an increase in temperature, resulting in the formation of isoprene with a relatively high selectivity at 600 °C.

Fig. 2(a) shows the product yields of the dehydrogenation at the H2S:iso-C5 ratios of 0.5–2.0, and Fig. 2(b) summarizes the conversion rate, C5-olefin yields, and selectivity. The C5-olefin yields increased with an increase in the H2S/iso-C5 ratio. The highest C5-olefin yield was obtained at the reaction temperature of 600 °C and an H2S/iso-C5 ratio of 2. The stability of Fe/SiO2 was evaluated under these conditions for approximately 400 min, as shown in Fig. 2(c). It is noted that the carbon balance and sulfur balance was almost 100% during the reaction, as shown in Fig. S1 (C5 olefins yield and carbon/sulfur balance with reaction time). The yields of the iso-amylenes and isoprene increased with the reaction time after approximately 100 min. In our previous study, we observed an induction period during propane dehydrogenation. The propylene yield increased as the reaction progressed with time, owing to the formation of active sites on the Fe/SiO2 surface [23], [24]. This formation of active sites may have caused the induction period. The performance after the induction period was relatively high and stable. Fig. S2 compares the catalytic performance of Fe/SiO2 during C5 dehydrogenation with those of the Cr/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn catalysts, which are known to be effective in dehydrogenating alkanes. The Fe/SiO2 catalyst displayed a higher stability and a lower amount of coke deposition than the Cr/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn catalysts. The performance of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst was compared to the some reported catalyst for C5 dehydrogenation [15], [16], [25]. Fig. S3 shows the conversion of iso-C5, selectivity to C5 olefines, yield of C5 olefines and space time yield (mmol·g-cat−1·h−1). The Fe/SiO2 catalyst is inferior to Pt-based catalyst in terms of catalytic activity, but the Fe/SiO2 catalyst is comparable to the other reported catalysts. In addition, the Fe/SiO2 catalyst has higher durability performance than other reported catalysts. Rostrup-Nielsen reported the phenomenon of coke deposition, one of the factors that deactivate alkane dehydrogenation on metal sulfides, by evaluating the steam reforming of methane [26]. The presence of sulfur on the catalyst surface decreases the rate of carbon formation, rather than the rate of the reforming reaction by blocking the sites required for carbon nucleation. Furthermore, isoprene is prone to coking on the surface of the catalyst, however isoprene on the sulfide catalyst surface could be easily desorbed. Fig. S4 shows energy diagram for the isoprene desorption from FeS (001) calculated by DFT measurement. The desorption barrier was 0.199 eV (19.2 kJ·mol−1). Considering this value, it can be inferred that isoprene was easily desorbed from the catalyst surface, resulting in a small amount of coke formation. Hence, the carbon deposition was less likely to occur over the Fe/SiO2 catalyst than dehydrogenation. This phenomenon stabilized the dehydrogenation of iso-C5 in the presence of H2S.

Fig. 3(a), (b), and (c) show the conversion rate of iso-C5, the total yield of C5-olefins, and the yield of C4-olefins as decomposition products over 200 min in the presence of the Fe/SiO2, Co/SiO2, and Ni/SiO2 catalysts, respectively. There was no significant difference between the conversion rates of each catalyst during the 200 min of reaction. However, the yield of C5-olefins showed a decreasing trend with the Co/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts, whereas C5-olefins were produced consistently in the presence of Fe/SiO2. Moreover, the Co/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts afforded higher yields of decomposition products than the Fe/SiO2 catalyst. Considering that the conversion rate did not differ significantly among the catalysts, it was assumed that the generated C5-olefins were decomposed into C4-olefins over the Co/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts. In our previous study, we investigated the reaction properties of the M/SiO2 (M: Fe, Co, Ni) catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane [23]. The decomposed product of ethylene was produced when Co or Ni catalysts were used. We speculated that propylene underwent hydrogenolysis (C3H6 + H2 → CH4 + C2H4) on the surfaces of the Co and Ni catalysts. In this study, the C5-olefins are expected to be decomposed by hydrogenolysis to form C4-olefins.

3.2. Effect of H2S on iso-C5 decomposition
It is evident from Fig. 1, Fig. 2 that the iso-C5 feedstock decomposed in the gaseous phase, which led to a decrease in olefin selectivity. Thus, in order to investigate the effect of H2S co-feeding on the pyrolysis properties of iso-C5, the reaction temperature and H2S/iso-C5 ratio were varied. Fig. 4 shows the product yields at different H2S/iso-C5 ratios at 550, 575, and 600 °C. The product yields increased with increasing H2S/iso-C5 ratios in the reaction temperature range of 550–600 °C. Increasing the reaction temperature also increased the product yield. In particular, when the H2S/iso-C5 ratio was 2 and the reaction temperature was 600 °C, the iso-C5 conversion was more than 40%. Generally, the thermal pyrolysis of alkanes proceeds via the formation of gas-phase radical species. Hence, one of the reasons for the increase in the conversion rate with increasing H2S/iso-C5 ratio is the formation of radical species derived from H2S. The thermal pyrolysis of alkanes in the presence of H2S can be explained using (3), (4), and (5). First, an alkanethiol is formed, followed by the production of hydrocarbon components by the decomposition of thiols [27], [28], [29], [30].

where R and R´ represent the alkyl groups, and the radical species are indicated by *. In this study, iso-C5 reacted with H2S and decomposed into the radical species to produce lower hydrocarbons. This decomposition of the radical species in the gaseous phase was accelerated by the increase in the H2S/iso-C5 ratio, producing more decomposition products. As for the product distribution, isobutene accounted for more than 50% of all the products. Thus, the reaction enthalpy for the decomposition of iso-C5 to C2–C4 products, such as ethylene, propylene, isobutene, and 2-butene, was estimated via a radical pathway. The reaction equations and reaction enthalpies are listed in Table 1. The enthalpies were calculated based on the method reported by Yun [31]. Fig. S5 shows the energy change in the elementary step for the enthalpy calculation of the iso-C5 radical decomposition. Notably, the radical position of each molecule was not considered in this calculation method. As shown in Table 1, the formation energies of isobutene, trans-2-butene, and cis-2-butene decomposed from iso-C5 radicals were particularly lower than those of ethylene and propylene. These results suggest that the amount of C4-olefins obtained by the decomposition of iso-C5 was more than those of ethylene and propylene. Among the C4 olefins, the amount of isobutene produced was higher than that of trans-2-butene and cis-2-butene, even though trans-2-butene and cis-2-butene are more stable, as shown in Table 1. This is because the formation of isobutene proceeds by β-elimination via a tertiary radical of iso-C5, whereas that of trans-2-butene and cis-2-butene proceeds by β-elimination via a secondary radical. As tertiary radicals are generally more stable than secondary radicals, isobutene was obtained at a higher yield than other decomposition products.

Compared to iso-C5, which contains a tertiary carbon, n-butane (n-C4) and n-pentane (n-C5) with no side chains and secondary carbons might produce olefins more selectively by suppressing thermal decomposition in the gaseous phase. Fig. 5(a), 5(b), and 5(c) show the conversion rate and olefin selectivity in the dehydrogenation of iso-C5, n-C5, and n-C4, respectively. The detailed products were shown in Fig. S6. The reaction was carried out at 550 °C with a H2S/feed material ratio of 1. Contrary to our expectations, the conversion rates and selectivity toward olefins were not different in the dehydrogenations of iso-C5 and n-C5. However, in the dehydrogenation of n-C4, a higher selectivity toward C4-olefins was observed. Additionally, high dehydrogenation activity was maintained for 20 h during n-C4 dehydrogenation. The dehydrogenation of n-C4 progressed more selectively than that of iso-C5 because the pyrolysis of n-C4 was less likely to occur in the gaseous phase. Moreover, the gas-phase reaction of n-C5 dehydrogenation progressed for a longer duration than expected. This might have occurred because n-C5 contains more secondary carbons and more β-cleavage sites in the molecule than does the n-C4 molecule. Therefore, the use of alkanes with a lower number of branches and β-cleavage sites as raw materials suppressed the decomposition of alkanes in the gaseous phase, producing olefins with a high selectivity during dehydrogenation with H2S co-feeding.

3.3. Physicochemical properties of the M/SiO2 (M: Fe, Co, Ni) catalysts
The Fe/SiO2 catalyst showed better dehydrogenation performance than the Co/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts. The high activity of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst was investigated by characterizing it from the viewpoint of bulk structure, bulk composition, and surface state.
Fig. 6 shows the XRD patterns of the as-prepared catalyst, the pretreated catalyst after H2 and H2S co-feeding at 600 °C, and the catalyst after the dehydrogenation of iso-C5 with H2S co-feeding at 600 °C. Fig. 6 also shows the chemical compositions of the sulfides calculated from the sulfur contents of the Fe/SiO2, Co/SiO2, and Ni/SiO2 catalysts. Metal oxides were observed on the surfaces of as-prepared Fe/SiO2, Co/SiO2, and Ni/SiO2 catalysts, whereas the sulfide phase was observed after pretreatment. The oxide phase on the catalysts was transformed into the sulfide phase by the sulfidation pretreatment. As a result, Fe1-xS (iron-deficient phase), Co9S8 (sulfur-deficient phase), and Ni9S8 (sulfur-deficient phase) were observed on the surfaces of the Fe/SiO2, Co/SiO2, and Ni/SiO2 catalysts, respectively. The sulfide phase in the Fe/SiO2 catalyst was observed even after the dehydrogenation of iso-C5 with H2S co-feeding. Moreover, there were no significant differences between the XRD patterns of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst obtained after pretreatment and after the dehydrogenation with H2S co-feeding. However, the sulfur-deficient phases of Co/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 were converted into equimolar amounts of CoS and NiS, respectively. Fig. S7 shows the stable phases of the Fe, Co, and Ni components in a simulated reaction performed in the range of 25–700 °C. At the reaction temperature of 600 °C, the stable phases of Fe0.877S, CoS and CoS1.333, and NiS were observed for the Fe, Co, Ni components, respectively, which corresponded well with the XRD results. The compositions of the Fe, Co, and Ni sulfides calculated by elemental analysis were compared with those determined using XRD patterns. Here, the composition of Fe/SiO2 agreed well with that attributed to the thermodynamically stable phase of Fe0.877S, whereas that of Co and Ni contained excess sulfur.

XPS was performed to determine the oxidation state of the S species in the Fe/SiO2, Co/SiO2, and Ni/SiO2 catalysts. Fig. 7(a), (b), and (c) show the deconvoluted XPS spectra of S2p on the catalysts after dehydrogenation with H2S co-feeding. In the XPS spectra of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst, the lattice S2- peaks were only observed at 161.3 eV (2p3/2) and 162.6 eV (2p1/2). For the Co/SiO2 catalyst, the disulfide ion (S22-) peaks were observed at 162.4 eV (2p3/2) and 163.8 eV (2p1/2), in addition to the peaks of the lattice S2- species. For the Ni/SiO2 catalyst, the polymeric sulfur species peaks were observed, in addition to those of S22- and lattice S2-. The formation of disulfides on the surfaces of the Co/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts can be explained using Eq. (6) [32].

Here, M represents metal components (Co and Ni), MS represents the sulfide, and MS2 corresponds to the disulfide. For Co- and Ni-based catalysts, the disulfides were formed near the catalyst surface, whereas the catalyst interior was composed of the metal sulfide phase. This is because only a small amount of metal ions diffused to the outer surface of the catalyst from the interior. Moreover, after the formation of disulfide on the surface, the metal component did not easily diffuse from the inside of the catalyst toward the surface, which may have led to the formation of disulfides on the surface of the catalyst and the sulfide phase in the bulk of the catalyst. According to Bastow et al., the diffusion constant of Ni in NiS was DNi = 7 × 10−4exp(−18300/RT), and the diffusion constant of NiS2 is estimated to be approximately 10−3 times that of NiS [33]. This result implies that metal diffusion from the interior to the surface is unlikely to occur, producing different phases at the surface and bulk of the catalyst. The formation of disulfide and polymeric sulfur phases on the catalyst surface may cause excess sulfur deposition on the Co/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts, as shown in Fig. 7. In the case of Fe/SiO2, even if FeS2 is formed, it is known to decompose thermally into the iron-deficient pyrrhotite (Fe1-xS); this decomposition is further accelerated by the reductive atmosphere [34]. Thermodynamically, the formation of FeS2 is less likely to occur than that of CoS2 and NiS2; only an iron sulfide phase is observed (Fig. S7(c)). According to a previous study, the disulfide phase is known to actively cause C–C bond cleavage [35]. In disulfide materials such as CoS2 and NiS2, weak metal–sulfur bond strengths such as those of Co–S and Ni–S increase the electron density (basicity) around the neighboring sulfur atoms. These basic sites may cause C–C bond dissociation in hydrocarbons. Hence, for the Co/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts, the C5-product probably decomposed by hydrogenolysis, followed by the production of isobutene. However, no active species for the decomposition of C5-olefins were formed on the Fe/SiO2 catalyst, resulting in a selective dehydrogenation performance.
3.4. Relation between induction period and bulk/surface state of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst
An important question to address is why the induction period was observed in dehydrogenation with co-feeding H2S on the Fe/SiO2 catalyst. The XRD and XPS measurements were performed to identify the change of bulk and surface state during dehydrogenation with co-feeding H2S. Fig. 8(a) and (b) and (c) respectively show the XRD patterns and XPS spectra of Fe2p3/2 and S2p peak of the Fe/SiO2 catalyst before and after the dehydrogenation of iso-C5 with H2S co-feeding (H2S/iso-C5 = 2) at 600 °C. The reaction time was varied from 0 to 120 min, which was corresponded to the time for induction period in dehydrogenation of iso-C5 with H2S co-feeding. It is noted that the XPS spectra of Fe2p3/2 was deconvoluted into three peaks for divalent Fe cation bonded with sulfide ion (Fe(II)-S), trivalent Fe cation bonded with sulfide ion (Fe(III)-S), and satellite peak. Table 2 shows the area ratio of sulfide ion to iron cation (S/Fe) on the catalyst surface, which was calculated using XPS spectra of iron (sum of Fe(II)-S, Fe(III)-S, and satellite) and sulfide ion. As clearly seen in Fig. 8(a), there is no change in the XRD patterns when the reaction time is increased, suggesting that the bulk structure of iron sulfide did not change during dehydrogenation. On the other hand, it could be seen that the magnitude of the iron peak did not significant change, but the sulfur peak, which is corresponded to lattice sulfide, became smaller with reaction time. In actual, the area ratio of S/Fe was decreased with reaction time, indicating that the sulfur ion in the catalyst was released to the gas phase via H2 reduction (H2 + S2- → H2S) or oxidative dehydrogenation of iso-C5 (C5H12 + S2- → C5H10 + H2S). By releasing sulfide ion from the catalyst surface, iron cation was exposed to the reaction atmosphere, and followed by the appearance of high activity for the dehydrogenation of iso-C5. The induction period was derived from the formation of active surface on the Fe/SiO2 catalyst.

3.5. Role of H2S on iso-C5 dehydrogenation on the Fe/SiO2 catalyst
To consider the role of H2S on the catalyst, the effect of the addition of H2S on the dehydrogenation performance was confirmed. The catalytic performance test involved the following method: firstly, dehydrogenation of iso-C5 with co-feeding H2S was conducted, followed by purging of the surface adsorbate using flowing He; secondly, dehydrogenation was carried out without co-feeding H2S, followed by purging and desorption of the surface adsorbate (mainly physically adsorbed H2S on the catalyst); subsequently, dehydrogenation with co-feeding H2S was conducted again. Lastly, dehydrogenation with co-feeding H2 was conducted after purging of the surface adsorbate using He. Fig. 9 shows C5 olefins yield over the Fe/SiO2 catalyst with reaction time. The olefins yield reached as high as 45.7%; however, it significantly decreased when the co-feed of H2S was stopped. When H2S was co-supplied again to the dehydrogenation, the catalytic yield to all olefins was recovered to about 44.4%. On the other hand, Under the co-supply condition of H2, few C5 olefins were obtained. H2S has a profound effect on the dehydrogenation performance. The role of H2S was considered from the viewpoint of the reaction mechanism. Fig. 10 shows energy diagram of C-H dissociation of iso-C5 to C5 monoolefine of 2-methyl-1-butene over FeS(001) surface, calculated by DFT theory. The result showed that the activation energy of 1st C-H dissociation of iso-C5 is 0.65 eV (=63.0 kJ·mol−1), which was low enough to be comparable to that of noble metals. On the other hand, the activation energy of the subsequent C-H dissociation was 0.80 eV (=77.4 kJ·mol−1), indicating a relatively large activation energy. The reason for the large activation energy of 2nd C-H dissociation might be transition state of C5H11 intermediate on the catalyst surface, in which C5H11 molecule was the distorted state as shown in the schematic image in Fig. 10. While, the activation energy for the decomposition of H2S in the gas phase (H2S→H*+SH*, The symbol ”*” means radical species) is 4.58 eV (=441.9 kJ·mol−1) as shown in Fig. S8. This activation energy was considerably larger activation energy, compared to C-H dissociation of iso-C5, which was estimated as an extremely slow reaction rate. However, when radicals are once formed, the rate at which they react with other chemical species is extremely fast, and the overall reaction is considered to proceed at a sufficient rate even if the concentration of radicals in the gas phase is about ppm-order. It is speculated that the SH radical species generated accelerates 2nd C-H abstraction from the C5H11 intermediate via Rideal-Eley mechanism, producing a high activity for dehydrogenation of iso-C5. Ho et al., reported the highly-active dehydrogenation catalyst of the Fe-incorporated MFI zeolite (H-[Fe]ZSM-5) catalyst [31]. The H-[Fe]ZSM-5 catalyst showed a selective and active for dehydrogenation of propane, in which the reaction mechanism was involved in radical cation intermediate. In this reaction system, the interaction between the generated SH radical species and C-H dissociation on iron sulfide might accelerate the dehydrogenation performance in the H2S co-existence dehydrogenation atmosphere.

4. Conclusions
Dehydrogenation of iso-C5 with H2S co-feeding was carried out in the presence of Fe/SiO2, Co/SiO2, and Ni/SiO2. The Fe/SiO2 catalyst showed high reactivity, yielding iso-amylenes and isoprene. The amount of C5-olefins produced over Fe/SiO2 was higher than that produced over the Co/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts. Dehydrogenations of n-C4 and n-C5 alkanes with no tertiary carbons were also performed with H2S co-feeding. A highly selective n-C4 dehydrogenation was achieved over the Fe/SiO2 catalyst with stable performance for 20 h. The physicochemical characterization of Fe/SiO2, Co/SiO2, and Ni/SiO2 showed that a disulfide phase was formed on the surfaces of the Co/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 catalysts, which led to a less selective performance. However, only the sulfide phase was observed on the Fe/SiO2 catalyst, enabling a highly selective dehydrogenation because of the suppression of the decomposition reactions.
