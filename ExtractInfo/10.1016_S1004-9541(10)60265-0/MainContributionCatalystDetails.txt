The documents provided do not contain relevant information about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation catalysts. They focus on modeling and simulation of coke combustion regeneration for a Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst used in propane dehydrogenation, but do not provide details on catalyst composition, performance metrics, or enhancements. As none of the documents discuss improvements to propane dehydrogenation catalysts, a unified XML summary is not applicable.
