The supplied document does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation to propylene. While it mentions propane dehydrogenation briefly, the focus seems to be on ethane dehydrogenation to ethylene. The catalysts examined are for converting ethane to ethylene, not propane to propylene. Therefore, I cannot extract the requested information about improvements to propane dehydrogenation catalysts, conversion, selectivity, or other metrics.
