 Unfortunately the provided document does not appear to discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The document focuses on enhancing Re2O7/Al2O3 catalysts for propylene production via the metathesis reaction between ethylene and 2-pentene. Since propane dehydrogenation is not mentioned, I cannot extract the requested information about a PDH or ODH catalyst.
