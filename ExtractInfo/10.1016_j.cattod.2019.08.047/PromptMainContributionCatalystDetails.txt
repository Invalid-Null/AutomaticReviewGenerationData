1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the main building blocks for petrochemicals. It is an important raw material for production of chemicals and polymers including polypropylene, acrolein, acrylic acid, propylene oxide, as well as for a large variety of industrial products [1,2]. Steam cracking of naphtha or gas oil is the traditional production process. As the process is an endothermic process, it usually requires high temperature to obtain high olefins yield. Current studies on propane dehydrogenation as an alternative route for propylene production mostly focuses on the preparation of high-efficiency catalysts to improve a desirable yield of propylene and suppress coke formation [[3], [4], [5], [6], [7]].
Commercial propane dehydrogenation catalysts have been relied on PtSnK/Al2O3 for decades because of their high activity and high selectivity to propylene [[8], [9], [10]]. However, catalytic deactivation due to coking is still unavoidable and frequent regeneration to restore the catalytic activity is necessary [11]. The stability of Pt-Sn catalysts in alkane dehydrogenation reaction has been improved by doping additional promoters such as Zn [12,13], Ga [14,15], and In [15,16]. The primary roles of these promoters are to improve the thermal stabilities of supports and to modify the acidic/basic properties of supports and metal-support interactions [[17], [18], [19]]. Furthermore, the addition of these promoters may modify bond strength of chemisorbed hydrocarbons, which formed to alloys with Pt [15,[20], [21], [22], [23], [24]]. Compared to Pt-Sn catalysts, bimetallic PtIn showed narrower particle size distribution and more homogenous in composition and was found to be more stable in alkane dehydrogenation [[25], [26], [27]].
Mg(Al)O or hydrotalcite has received considerable attention as an efficient support for Pt-based catalysts for light alkane dehydrogenation owing to their moderately basicity, high thermal stability, as well as the capability of enhancing Pt particle dispersion due to the presence of Al cations on the support surface [[28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]]. According to the previous study by Akporiaye et al. [30], it was verified that Pt-Sn supported on calcined Mg(Al)O performed the superior catalytic activity, propylene selectivity, and lifetime stability than the conventional Al2O3 supported catalysts. Ke Xia et al. [34] reported a series of PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalysts synthesized by successive impregnation method to optimize the preparation conditions of Mg/Al molar ratios that resulted in the best catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation. Subsequently, PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalysts were investigated by Li-Ling Shen et al. [35] with the aims of understanding the effects of calcination temperature of Mg(Al)O support on the structure/activity relationship of catalysts. Furthermore, Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O with hydrotalcite-like supports prepared by substituting Al with In cations via co-precipitation method showed better catalytic activity, high alkene selectivity [25,33]. The XANES, EXAFS and high- resolution TEM were employed to verify that part In3+ cations were reduced and the resulted zero-valent promoter formed PtIn alloy particles. From these studies, the optimized parameters for preparation of PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalysts were suggested to be Mg/Al molar ratio 4, pH 8, and calcination temperature 600 °C. In addition, our previous study showed the effect of In loadings (0.2–1.0 wt.%) on the 0.3 wt.% Pt catalysts prepared by co-impregnation in the propane dehydrogenation at 550 °C [36]. The results showed that the proper In addition of 0.6 - 0.8 wt.% greatly enhanced catalyst activity and selectivity. However, In addition at 0.6 wt.% was chosen for further study in order to avoid the thermodynamic limitation.
In this study, the bimetallic PtIn catalysts supported on a synthesized Mg(Al)O support with the Mg/Al = 3 were prepared by different preparation methods namely co-precipitation, co-impregnation, and successive impregnation with Pt and In loading at 0.3 and 0.6 wt.%, respectively. As a reference, a monometallic Pt/Mg(Al)O was also prepared and their catalytic performances were evaluated in the propane dehydrogenation reaction at 550 °C under atmospheric pressure. The spatial distribution of Pt within the catalysts was observed from the transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were used as primary tools to observe the PtIn interaction and/or the formation of PtIn alloys. The NH3-TPD experiments were used to investigate the acid properties of the catalysts. The types and amount of coke formed on the spent catalysts were also investigated by temperature program oxidation (TPO).
2. Experimental
2.1. Mg(In)(Al)O and Mg(Al)O supports preparation
In-modified Mg(Al)O support, Mg(In)(Al)O was synthesized using the following procedure. First, an aqueous solution (500 mL) of Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (102.4 g, Sigma-Aldrich, 98–102%), Al(NO3)3·9H2O (50.0 g, Sigma-Aldrich, 98.5%) and In(NO3)3·xH2O (0.52 g, Sigma-Aldrich, 99.99%) was mixed with an aqueous solution (500 mL) of Na2CO3 (28.3 g, EMD Chemicals Inc., 99.5%) and NaOH (37.8 g, Fisher Scientific, 98.3%). These two solutions were mixed by dropwise addition to maintained the pH of mixture at about 10 and kept at 60 °C, then the mixture was aged at room temperature for 18 h. The precipitate was filtered, washed with deionized water until pH 7 was reached and dried overnight at 110 °C. Subsequent calcination in air to 600 °C at 2 °C/min for 8 h to obtain the calcined support, which we describe as Mg(In)(Al)O. Mg(Al)O was also prepared in a similar manner.
2.2. Catalysts preparation
All of bimetallic PtIn catalysts with the same Pt and In loading (0.3 wt.% and 0.6 wt.%, respectively) were prepared by different methods as following: co-precipitation ‘Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O’, co-impregnation ‘PtIn/Mg(Al)O’ and successive impregnation ‘Pt-In/Mg(Al)O’ methods. Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O was prepared by impregnation method with H2PtCl6 solution using calcined Mg(In)(Al)O (synthesized by co-precipitation process) as a support. PtIn/Mg(Al)O was prepared by co-impregnation method with InNO3 and H2PtCl6 solutions using calcined Mg(Al)O support. In case of Pt-In/Mg(Al)O, catalyst was prepared by using the successive impregnation method. The calcined Mg(Al)O support was firstly impregnated with an InNO3 aqueous solution, followed by an H2PtCl6 solution. For reference, the Pt/Mg(Al)O was also prepared by impregnation method with H2PtCl6 solution for comparative study. After each impregnation step or method, the catalysts were dried at room temperature for 2 h, then dried in an oven at 110 °C overnight and finally calcined in air at 550 °C for 3 h.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
The BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) surface area was performed with nitrogen as adsorbate at −196 °C after pre-treatment of the samples at 200 °C under nitrogen flow. For determination of the multi-point method surface area, the samples were examined from nitrogen adsorption by using Micrometrics Chemisorbs 2750. The pore structural data were analyzed by BJH (Barrett–Joyner–Halenda) method using Halsey equation for multilayer thickness. The total pore volume data were analyzed by BJH method cumulative desorption pore volume. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) (Optima 5300 DV, PerkinElmer Inc.) was used to obtain the chemical composition of the synthesized material. To obtain the concentrations, all of catalysts were digested by hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid and nitric acid. X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) was used to analyze the crystallinity and the structure of a catalyst. The refraction or diffraction of the X-rays was monitored at various angles with respect to the primary beam X-ray diffraction analysis using an X-ray refractometer, SIEMENS XRD D5000, with Ni-filtered CuKα radiation in the 2θ range of 20 to 80° with step size of 0.02° and an acquisition time of 0.5 s per step. CO-Pulse Chemisorptions of Pt active sites were performed in a Micromeritic ChemiSorb 2750 automatic system attached with ChemiSoft TPx software. Platinum dispersion was determined by pulsing carbon monoxide over the reduce catalyst. Approximately 0.1 g of catalyst is placed in a quartz tube, incorporated in a temperature-controlled oven and connected to a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Prior to chemisorptions, the catalyst was reduced in a flow of hydrogen (50 ml/min) at 550 °C for 1 h. Afterwards, the sample was cooled down to 40 °C with helium flow and hold for 1 h for removing the physical adsorption of carbon monoxide. Afterwards, the pulse injections of carbon monoxide were conducted over the reduced catalyst until saturation of carbon monoxide. NH3-TPD experiments were carried out to analyze the acidic properties of the catalysts using a Micromeritic Chemisorb 2750 apparatus. Prior to NH3 adsorption, 0.1 g sample was pretreated at 500 °C for 1 h under He flow. After cooling to 40 °C, NH3 was adsorbed using a flow of 15 vol % NH3/He for 0.5 h and then purged with flowing He for 1 h. The NH3 desorption was performed in He with a heating rate of 10 °C/min and the NH3 desorption profiles were registered with a thermal conductivity detector. The reducibility and reduction behavior of the prepared catalysts were investigated by H2-TPR. The samples were pretreated under Ar flow at 500 °C for 1 h to remove a moisture, then being cooled down to temperature at 50 °C. Subsequently, the TPR profiles were recorded under the 10% H2/Ar flow from 50 °C to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. The amount of hydrogen uptake was determined by measuring the areas of the reduction profiles obtained from a Micromeritic Chemisorb 2750 automated system attached with ChemiSoft TPx software. The temperature-programmed desorption of C3H6 measurements (C3H6-TPD) were implemented to determine the interactions between propene and catalysts. All the catalysts were pretreated under He flow at 500 °C for 1 h to, then being reduced in situ under hydrogen atmosphere at 550 °C for 1 h. The catalysts were saturated with propene at 40 °C, and then purged with flowing He for 1 h. The C3H6 desorption was performed in He with a heating rate of 10 °C/min to 500 °C. During desorption, a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was employed to record the TPD profiles. The surface electronic states of the catalyst samples after reduction were investigated by XPS using an AMICUS X-ray photoelectron spectrometer with a Mg Kα X-ray as a primary excitation and a KRATOS VISION2 software. XPS element spectra were acquired with 0.1 eV energy step at a pass energy of 75 eV. The binding energies (BE) were calibrated using the C1s level at 285.0 eV as an internal standard. The TEM images of catalysts were carried out by a JEM-2010 microscope operated at 200 kV. The reduced samples were dispersed in ethanol by ultrasonic, and then a small drop of this solution was placed onto carbon film coated copper grids and dried before testing. Coke formation was determined by the TPO experiments. Approximately 0.3 g of spent catalyst was placed in the quartz tube. The 1% O2/He gas mixture was passed through the system at a flow rate of 25 cm3/min. The temperature was raised to 600 °C with a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The effluent stream was sampled every 5 min on-line using an Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatograph equipped with a TCD detector.
2.4. Propane dehydrogenation reaction
The dehydrogenation of propane was performed in a fixed bed stainless steel reactor with size of 0.75 inch. under atmospheric pressure. Approximately 1.5 g of catalyst was placed in the stainless-steel reactor and reduced under H2 flow (50 cm3/min) balanced with N2 (50 cm3/min) at 550 °C for 1 h followed by purging for 30 min in N2 to remove the H2. Subsequently, pure propane in gas phase was fed into the reactor at 20 cm3/min at a reaction temperature 550 °C. The reaction was carried out for 5 h time-on-stream (TOS). The reactants and products were analyzed on-line using an Agilent 7820A gas chromatograph equipped with a packed column HP-PLOT Al2O3 “M” deactivated (50 m with 8 μm ID) and a flame ionization detector (FID). The propane conversion and products selectivity were calculated in the basis of weight calculation by using the following equations:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. The catalytic performances of PtIn catalysts in propane dehydrogenation
The propane dehydrogenation was carried out at 550 °C and atmospheric pressure for 5 h. Fig. 1a and b shows propane conversion and selectivity to propylene within 2 reaction – regeneration cycles of the different catalysts. The monometallic Pt/Mg(Al)O showed inadequate conversion, stability, and poor selectivity to propylene along the 5 h time on stream with the initial conversion, final conversion, and selectivity to propene of 12.4%, 1.3% and 79.4% respectively. For the In-modified Pt catalysts, the initial and final conversion of propane monotonically increased in the order: Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O > PtIn/Mg(Al)O > Pt-In/Mg(Al)O. The Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O with In-modified Mg(Al)O support prepared by co-precipitation exhibited the highest catalytic performance and stability among all the prepared catalysts. The initial propane conversions of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O was 24.2, which was close to the equilibrium conversion of propane dehydrogenation at almost 30% at 550 °C [37]. Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O and PtIn/Mg(Al)O were also tested for another reaction – regeneration cycle. It can be seen that the propane conversion of Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O and PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalysts greatly decreased during entire the 2nd reaction cycle while the propylene selectivity slightly decreased to about 96%. The final propane conversion of 1st and 2nd cycles for Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O were 16.3% and 13.8%, respectively while the final propane conversions for PtIn/Mg(Al)O were 14.8% in 1st cycle and 10.7% in 2nd cycle. Meanwhile, the In/Mg(Al)O showed poor activity and selectivity of 0.8-0.9% and 50.6–55.1%, respectively. It can be observed that the initial propane conversion slightly increases for 2nd cycle. However, the final propane conversion clearly decreased after the 2nd cycles of reaction – regeneration process. It verified that the In-modified Pt catalysts exhibited the higher activity and selectivity to propene than the monometallic Pt catalyst due to the undesired side reactions for propane dehydrogenation such as cracking and hydrogenolysis were suppressed. These results are in agreement with our previous study [36], which suggested that the catalytic activity and propylene selectivity were improved by using a proper amount of In doping for propane dehydrogenation.

3.2. Characteristics of the different catalysts
The chemical compositions and textural properties of all catalysts are listed in Table 1. Table 2 shows the Pt dispersion and the average Pt particle size of all catalysts. The Mg/Al ratios of support were similar at 3:1 for all the prepared catalysts with Pt and In contents of 0.3 and 0.6 wt.%, respectively. The specific surface area (SBET) of all catalysts were about 104.3 to 141.3 m2/g with the pore volume (Vp) and pore diameter (Dp) of 0.21 to 0.26 cm3/g and 4.5–4.6 nm, respectively. It can be observed that the SBET and Vp of the Pt-In/Mg(Al)O (104.3 m2/g and 0.21 cm3/g, respectively) were markedly lower than those of the catalysts prepared by the other methods. It might be attributed to the introduction of the metal components into the channels of Mg(Al)O support during each step of the successive impregnation process with possible channel modulation [38]. To determine the Pt dispersion of catalysts, CO-pulse chemisorptions of Pt active sites were performed. As exhibited in Table 2, Pt dispersion of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O was higher than the other catalysts. It has been reported that doping In promoter could improve the dispersion of Pt particles and prevent them from sintering [24,34,39]. The TEM images of the catalysts and the corresponding particle size distributions of Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O, PtIn/Mg(Al)O, and Pt-In/Mg(Al)O catalysts are presented in Fig. 2. The average metal particle size of Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O, PtIn/Mg(Al)O, Pt-In/Mg(Al)O and Pt/Mg(Al)O were 0.91, 0.94, 1.14 and 1.31 nm, respectively. The average metal particle size decreased with the addition of In as compared to the monometallic Pt catalyst. It is suggested that In-modified Pt catalysts are favorable to the more uniform distribution of bimetallic PtIn particles.

With the aims to identify the crystallization phase presented in the catalysts prepared by different methods, X-ray diffraction analysis was conducted. The XRD patterns of the PtIn catalysts are depicted in Fig. 3. The crystalline phases observed were identified by the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS). All of the PtIn catalysts exhibited periclase (MgO) as a primary crystal phase. In addition, multiple minor peaks located at 2θ = 36.7°, 44.3°, 59.4° and 65.2° were found in the XRD patterns of the PtIn catalysts, which matched with the characteristic peaks that are specific to spinel MgAl2O4. It can be observed that the spinel MgAl2O4 of Pt-In/Mg(Al)O was evidently more apparent than the others. This may be due to the more calcination steps during successive impregnation process led to relatively more characteristic spinel MgAl2O4 phase. These results indicated that the spinel MgAl2O4 crystal phase provided inferior catalytic performance than that of periclase MgO. Dominant periclase and small spinel MgAl2O4 crystals can be clearly verified that the catalytic activity of the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O and PtIn/Mg(Al)O were higher than the Pt-In/Mg(Al)O. Moreover, no characteristic peaks of Pt or In species were observed, probably due to the high dispersion on the supports or very small metal particles [40].

Fig. 3. XRD patterns of the different catalysts.
The acidic properties of the catalysts were investigated by NH3-TPD and the results are displayed in Fig. 4. All the catalysts showed a similar appearance consisting of three desorption peak regions at (I) 117–125 °C, (II) 165–180 °C, and (III) 233–267 °C. According to the other PtIn/HT catalysts reported in the literatures [34,35], these peaks could be inferred to weak and medium acid sites. A semi-quantitative comparison of the acid distribution was obtained by fitting the NH3- TPD curves using the Gaussian deconvolution method and is summarized in Table 3. Addition of In to the monometallic Pt catalyst over synthesized Mg(Al)O using different methods slightly decreased the sum of the total peak areas. The Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O exhibited the lowest TM of all desorption peaks at 117, 165 and 233 °C. The temperature of maximal peak intensity (TM) for all the desorption peaks shifted to lower temperature for all the In-modified Pt catalysts especially for the higher temperature peak (peak III) that was shifted from 267 °C for monometallic Pt/Mg(Al)O to 233 °C for Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O. Moreover, it can also be observed that the higher temperature peak (peak III) area fraction slightly decreased. The Pt-In/Mg(Al)O displayed higher acid strength with the higher temperature peak (peak III) at 264 °C, compared to the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O and PtIn/Mg(Al)O at 233 and 235 °C, respectively. Thus, the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O exhibited the lowest fraction of strong acidic sites. It is suggested that the higher propylene selectivity of the PtIn catalysts was related well with the lower acid strength of the catalysts.

The effect of different preparation methods on the Pt-In modified Mg(Al)O catalysts was further investigated by H2-TPR. Fig. 5A shows the TPR profiles of In-modified Mg(Al)O support by using the co-precipitation and incipient wetness impregnation methods with denoted as Mg(In)Al)O and In/Mg(Al)O, respectively. It can be observed that both of Mg(In)(Al)O and In/Mg(Al)O displayed a main reduction region at temperature around 480 °C and above 500 °C. The lower reduction region was considered to be the In reduction region and the later reduction region was assigned to the reduction of the some In reduction with the Mg(Al)O support. As depicted in Fig. 5B, the monometallic Pt catalyst showed a low reduction temperature peak centered at 250 °C, which was assigned to the reduction of platinum species on the surface. The second peak located at 410 °C was assigned to the reduction of platinum species with a stronger interaction with the support [[41], [42], [43]]. For the In-modified Pt catalysts, the higher reduction peak from 418 °C of the Pt-In/Mg(Al)O greatly shifted to 478 °C for Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O. It is suggested that a fraction of In initially being reduced with Pt at the temperature above 418 °C, possibly leading to the reduction of some In oxides into the metallic state. Moreover, the increase of hydrogen consumption in higher Pt reduction region was also observed, which could be due to the In alloying with Pt [36,44]. A shift of the second reduction region to higher temperature possibly led to strengthen the metal – support interaction, resulting in higher catalytic performances for propane dehydrogenation reaction.

Fig. 6 shows the XPS spectra corresponding to In3d5/2 region for fresh Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O, PtIn/Mg(Al)O and Pt-In/Mg(Al)O catalysts after reduction at 550 °C. After the deconvolution of the spectra, two In species were obtained at about 444.3–444.6 and 445.8–445.9 eV, corresponding to the different indium species. The lower binding energy was attributed to the formation of the zerovalent or metallic In [[45], [46], [47]], whereas the higher binding energy was ascribed to the oxidation state of In species on the surface of the catalysts. The semi-quantitative XPS results of different catalysts after the 1st and after 2nd reaction - regeneration cycles are summarized in Table 4, the percentages of the oxidation state of In species of fresh catalysts for Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O, PtIn/Mg(Al)O and Pt-In/Mg(Al)O catalysts were 60.8, 55.4, and 50.7%, respectively. The percentages of oxidation state of In species of PtIn/Mg(Al)O and Pt-In/Mg(Al)O were distinctly lower than Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O catalyst, which the Pt-In/Mg(Al)O exhibited the highest fraction of metallic In. After 2nd reaction – regenertation cycle, it was observed that the In0/In3+ ratios of PtIn catalysts increased in a similar trend with the percentages of metallic In (In0). The increase of In0/In3+ ratio of was slightly higher on Pt/Mg(In)Al)O than PtIn/Mg(Al)O. However, a higher In0/In3+ ratio was found on the PtIn/Mg(Al)O in each cycle compared to Pt/Mg(In)Al)O. It verified that the larger amount of metallic In0 or In0/In3+ ratio resulted in lower catalytic activity and stability along the reaction process. According to a number of previous studies [34,48], In has a similar influence as Sn assistant. Shi et al. [49] proposed that Sn in a metallic state (Sn0) may be a poison to propane dehydrogenation reaction. These results were in agreement with other studies [44,50] that In0 content attributed to the physical blockage of active sites, which is disadvantage for propane dehydrogenation. The In/Pt ratio of Pt/Mg(In)Al)O, PtIn/Mg(Al)O and Pt-In/Mg(Al)O were 3.7, 4.3 and 5.8, respectively. After 2nd reaction – regenertation cycle, the In/Pt ratio of Pt/Mg(In)Al)O and PtIn/Mg(Al)O increased to 5.0 and 6.4, respectively. The In/Pt ratios from XPS results were higher than the bulk In/Pt ratio of 3.4 calculated from Pt and In precursors, suggesting the enrichment of In on the surface of the catalysts and the effect of repeated reaction – regeneration cycle on the In/Pt ratio. Similar results were also observed in a number of previous studies [51,52].

To further explore the diversities of reaction selectivity, the interaction of propylene with the catalysts was analyzed by C3H6-TPD, and the corresponding desorption profiles are shown in Fig. 7. It has been reported that the desorption temperature is related to the extent of interaction between propylene and the catalysts [[53], [54], [55]]. As depicted in Fig. 7, the desorption peaks of all catalysts displayed a similar sharp peak in the range of 239–268 °C with the highest desorption peak of Pt-In/Mg(Al)O at the temperature of 268 °C. The desorption peak of Pt/Mg(In)Al)O was relatively lower than the PtIn/Mg(Al)O with 239 and 243 °C, respectively. These results suggested that Pt/Mg(In)Al)O weakened the adsorption of propylene compared to the other two catalysts, preventing the deep dehydrogenation of propylene converting into higher-order dehydrogenation products [53,55], and coke formation. For this reason, Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O exhibited the highest selectivity to propylene and lowest coke formation, which diminished the catalytic deactivation.

Coke formation is one of the important factors for catalyst deactivation, which can cover and block the active metal. TPO was used to investigate the amount and nature of coke formed on the used catalysts. The typical TPO profiles of used catalysts are shown in Fig. 8. The used catalysts were collected after performed in the propane dehydrogenation at 550 °C for 5 h TOS. All the spent catalysts showed two successive peaks of carbon dioxide intensity representing two different carbon deposits. Generally, the first peak at low temperature located at around 366–388 °C are mainly to the carbon deposits that cover the active metal. The second peak at high temperature located at around 420–509 °C represents the carbon deposits that located on the external surface of the support [56]. For the monometallic Pt catalyst, Pt/Mg(Al)O showed mainly combustion peak with the highest amount of coke at about 388 °C. It is clear that coke deposits mainly covered on the active sites, corresponding to quick deactivation. The combustion peaks of the In-modified Pt catalysts shifted to lower temperature and strongly decrease of coke amount on the active metal. According to the previous study by Sun et al. [25], alloying of Pt with In greatly reduced the coke produced on the surface of PtIn nanoparticles and migrated to the support during alkane dehydrogenation. It suggests that the In-modified Pt catalyst significantly reduced the amount of coke formation, particularly on the active sites which diminished the catalytic deactivation, resulting in better catalyst stability.

To reasonably explain the structure-activity relation of catalyst, the model for catalyst formation mechanism from different preparation routes is proposed in Fig. 9. The addition of In to monometallic Pt catalysts leads to the formation of intermetallic alloy nanoparticles, which performed the superior catalytic performance for alkane dehydrogenation compared to the monometallic Pt catalyst [34,53]. As revealed by the H2-TPR and XPS results, Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O exhibited strong metal – support interaction in the higher reduction region and displayed more fraction of oxidation state of In species than those of the PtIn/Mg(Al)O and Pt-In/Mg(Al)O catalysts. It can be proposed that Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O with Mg(In)(Al)O hydrotalcite-like supports prepared by substituting Al with In cations via co-precipitation method exhibited well-dispersed Pt–In alloy nanoparticles. In species incorporation inside the LDH structure (Mg(Al)O) after calcination could be partially reduced by dissociated H atom from In3+ into Inδ+. These moderately mobile Inδ+ species transported to interact with the reduced Pt atoms/clusters on the surface and established alloying of Pt with In [57]. The co-impregnation (PtIn/Mg(Al)O) and successive impregnation (Pt-In/Mg(Al)O) methods also led to the formation of PtIn alloy nanoparticles with more metallic In0 which is inferior for catalytic performances in the propane dehydrogenation [34,48,49].

4. Conclusions
In this study, the In-modified Pt supported on hydrotalcite Mg(Al)O catalysts prepared by co-precipitation, co-impregnation, and successive impregnation with Pt and In loading at 0.3 and 0.6 wt.% were systematically compared in the propane dehydrogenation at 550 °C. All In-modified Pt catalysts exhibit higher propane conversion and stability, compared to the monometallic Pt catalysts With the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O showed the best catalytic performance with 24.2% initial propane conversion and 98.2% propene selectivity. The TPR and XPS measurements verified that the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O with In-modified Mg(Al)O support prepared via co-precipitation method strengthened the metal-support interaction and led to more Pt-In alloy formation compared to the others, resulting in improved catalytic performances and stability. PtIn/Mg(Al)O and Pt-In/Mg(Al)O resulted in larger fraction of metallic state (In0), which is disadvantageous to the propane dehydrogenation. Compared to the Pt-In/Mg(Al)O, the weaker adsorption of propylene were obtained on the Pt/Mg(In)(Al)O and PtIn/Mg(Al)O, resulting in the prevention of the deep dehydrogenation. Moreover, the In-modified Pt catalysts significantly reduced the amount of coke formation, particularly on the active sites which diminished the catalytic deactivation.
