1. Introduction
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) catalysts for converting ethane to ethylene began receiving attention in the late 1970s after Journal of Catalysis published an article titled, “The Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane over Catalyst Containing Mixed Oxide of Molybdenum and Vanadium” followed by a prodigious amount of advances in the 1980s; in part due to substantial research being conducted on remote natural gas [1], [2]. The selectivity and conversion to ethylene are the two parameters commonly used to measure the catalyst productivity. Fig. 1 displays a variety of catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethane (C2-ODH) including the M1 catalyst. The original M1 catalyst was refined at ABB Lummus in the early 2000s and achieved high selectivity at high conversion [3].

The discovery of an abundance of North American shale gas over the past decade has resulted in an enormous growth in US tight oil and shale gas production. A steep decrease in the US dependence on foreign energy resources coupled with new opportunities for US manufacturing is causing growth across the petrochemical industry [4]. Ethylene, the lightest olefin, is an organic intermediate used for manufacturing many downstream chemicals such as polyethylene, ethylbenzene, 1,2-dichloro-ethane, ethylene oxide, ethanol, polyvinyl acetate and many more important chemicals. Polyethylene, the most common plastic used worldwide, is the most notable end product of ethylene accounting for nearly 60% of the capacity. In the US, 90% of the manufactured ethylene is produced from natural gas and accounts for 20% of the worlds capacity. Worldwide, conventional steam pyrolysis (CSP) is the current means for producing ethylene. CSP is a non-catalytic, high temperature, and low pressure process that thermally cracks a feedstock of ethane, propane, or liquid fuels. The choice of feedstock depends greatly on geographic location, cost, and availability of hydrocarbons. The process is extremely energy and capital intensive, yielding many byproducts, requiring extensive separations and purification [5].The US has transitioned mostly to a gas feedstock for crackers due to the abundant supply of low cost ethane. In the US, ten additional ethane cracker expansion projects are driving the steep increase in ethylene capacity. Global ethylene capacity is 160 MTPA and is projected to reach 179 MTPA by 2018 [5].
Aspen HYSYS is used to simulate and compare the respective CSP and C2-ODH plant design. Preliminary Techno-Economic Analyses (TEA) shows the superiority of C2-ODH over conventional methods for producing ethylene. Required netback (RNB) is an economic approach commonly used for assessing the attractiveness of new vs current technology (top cat paper ref). RNB is based on calculation of the Cost of Production (COP). COP is based on variable costs, fixed costs, cash costs, capital investment, capital recovery. The current spot or contract prices are greater than the COP of new technologies then the new technology shows potential. If the COP of a new technology is less than the cash costs of a current technology, then shutdown economics are achieved [6].
1.1. Options for the reactor and reaction specifics
From an engineering standpoint there are basically 3 options in the design of a reactor to achieve the high yields and manage the heat of reaction. The use of an adiabatic fixed bed reactor with a cold feed was removed as an option due to the potential for safety issues associated with the passive control of the exotherms. Consequently, the main options studied with ASPEN-HYSYS to date are listed below. The stoichiometry and activation energy input into the model was determined from the patent literature. Temperature and pressure were input into the model based on the laboratory data reported in the patent examples. Assuming a pseudo-first order reaction, the conditions used for the analysis are listed below.
▓▓▓▓▓Inlet temperature:▓▓▓325C
▓▓▓▓▓Inlet pressure:▓▓▓▓▓4 atm
▓▓▓▓▓Pre-exponential
▓▓▓▓▓parameter(A)▓▓▓▓▓ 1e9

▓▓▓▓▓By-products▓▓▓▓▓▓ up to 5% CO2; trace quantities of acetylene and acetic acid used in the modeling
Sensitivity analyses using these numbers are easily accommodated in the modeling work and are used to assess the viability of the various case studies. The various options for reactor designs are as follows:
a
Packed tubular reactors in series
1.
Tubes with internal diameters of 1–1.5 in. and 5–7 m in length are packed with the M1 catalyst. The target is to achieve about 25% conversion of ethane within each reactor. Due to the frictional pressure drop in each reactor, the partial pressure of ethane will be decreased in subsequent reactors. Consequently, the temperature will need to be higher to maintain the 25% conversion target. Additionally, latter reactors may require a more complex heat recovery system since the boiler feed water coolant (BFW) may exceed the critical temperature and pressure. A super critical water coolant system (SCWC) similar to that used in nuclear reactor/power generators is being considered for that function.
2.
Feeds with ethane/ethylene and limiting pure oxygen feed delivered via inter-reactor injection
3.
Ethane and ethylene serving as diluents. Ethylene is reported to not undergo secondary reactions. By-products will track with unreacted ethane to the next reactor in series.
4.
The number of tubes is similar to that required in the conventional ethylene oxide reactions, and be as many as 20,000 tubes. This reactor system has been in-place and studied for decades.
b
Short packed beds with intercoolers
1.
Similar to the packed tubes, in this option oxygen is limiting and is extinguished by the end of each stage. In this case the effluent of each reactor stage is removed and cooled externally. Once the heat of reaction is recovered the reactor stream is returned to the reactor and enters the next reactor stage. This is continued until the desired conversion is achieved. Again due to frictional pressure drop, the partial pressures decrease towards the end of the reactor and in order to maintain reactivity, temperatures need to be increased and the SCWC system may be required.
c
Cold shot reactors
1.
This option is similar to the reactor design used for the conversion of synthesis gas to methanol. Heat management is accomplished by the injection of a cold stream containing additional oxygen at several positions during the axial run of the reactor. A sparger may need to be imbedded in the catalyst bed to distribute the reactants and avoid channeling. The heat transfer mechanism is direct quench rather than indirect quench and therefore the level (temperature) at which the energy will be recovered will be lower and the overall plant will become less efficient and may not reach the envisioned E-0 conditions.
Multiple trains are not included in the analysis because it is expected that each reactor could provide several hundred millions of pounds per year of product. Additionally, it should be scalable by adjustment of the number of tubes. There are no other unit operations or equipment in the process that will be limiting. It will probably be prudent to have several parallel reactors either as a parallel unit to adjust the capacity as needed or perhaps as a spare.
2. Overview of C2-ODH
2.1. Chemistry
A gas stream of ethane and oxygen are reacted over the optimized M1 catalyst and form ethylene, water, and traces of carbon oxides at temperatures less than 400C and 1–2 atm3. The catalysts disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,250,346 include oxides of molybdenum: MoaXbYc, where X = Chromium, Manganese, Niobium, Tantalum, Titanium, Vanadium and/or Tungsten, Y = Bismuth, Cerium, Cobalt, Copper, Iron, Potassium, Magnesium, Nickel, Lead, Antimony, Silicon, Tin, Thallium, and/or Uranium [7]. Catalyst preparation is key to achieving high selectivity at high conversion to ethylene. Catalyst preparation is described in World Patent No. 2010115108 The refined M1 catalyst has been demonstrated at a Technology Readiness Level of 3 for over 1000 h of operation.
2.2. Process
Scheme 1 shows a block flow of the C2-ODH process. The process has the potential to only contain 3-major sections as shown in Scheme 1 – a heating & cooling network, a reactor, and a membrane. Ethane is preheated to approximately 200C and fed with limited oxygen to the ODH reactor. Pure oxygen is used rather than air to avoid downstream removal of nitrogen. Ethane and ethylene are used as diluents due to lack of secondary reactions with ethylene. Inter-bed oxygen injections ensure operation occurs safely. Based on the current Aspen HYSYS modeling of laboratory data, a tubular reactor design, similar to an Ethylene Oxide reactor, offers the most potential for managing the heat generated by the exothermic gas phase reaction. The reactor effluent containing ethylene, unreacted ethane, water, and carbon oxides are cooled and water is recovered. This charge gas is sent to conventional separations units. Novel membranes being developed by Compact Membrane System have the ability to separate alkenes from alkanes and are being considered for application [8]. If needed, carbon dioxide can be scrubbed, or adsorbed from the reactor effluent. C2-ODH could potentially be an add-on reactor unit to conventional ethylene plant and existing distillation/fractionation columns could be used for purification. The limited amount of byproducts and almost stoichiometric chemistry of C2-ODH creates a grade of ethylene with high enough purity that can be used downstream for processing for example ethylbenzene.

2.3. Reactor design considerations
In order to manage the heat and provide conversion of ethane, a tubular reactor in series, with a shell-side coolant is used. One to four tubular reactors in series, with complete consumption of oxygen per reactor, can be run isothermally using a shell-side coolant to control the exotherm in the reactor. At the exit of each reactor, oxygen is injected and ran to extinction in each set of bundles, while also ensuring each module is operating safely outside of the explosion limits. Oxygen consumption across the first bed is shown in Fig. 2.

Fig. 2. Oxygen Consumption Module 1.
The first set of bundles is 4-m long with one thousand 1.25-in tubes; the reactor length increases for each subsequent reactor to maintain conversion. The conversion achieved per bed is 25%. The feed compositions for each bundle is listed in Table 1.

Oxygen 0.125 0.118 0.187 0.049
Ethylene 0.000 0.214 0.410 0.766
Water 0.000 0.214 0.410 0.766
The reactants are modelled using first order kinetics with the assumption that ethylene does not undergo secondary reactions. This assumption is based on initial data for the M1 catalyst. The M1 catalyst allows for a mixed C2 feed due to the refractory nature of ethylene. A tubular design allows for high temperature energy recovery from the heat of reaction; avoiding large exotherms and inter reactor cooling. The residence time in each of the tube bundles is approximately 5 s. The inlet pressure is approximately 900 kPa with a tubeside pressure drop of 70–100 kPa. As more ethane is consumed, the rate of reaction decreases as the pressure drops in each series of packed tubes. In order to maintain the rate of reaction, the temperature of the shell-side coolant is increased as shown in Table 2 for each reactor, along with the packed tubes inlet and outlet temperatures.
Table 2. Shell-side coolant temperatures for each module.
Tubular Module Shell-Side Tube-Side
Empty Cell
Coolant Temperature Inlet Temperature Exit Temperature
1 345 174 357
2 345 347 384
3 390 367 390
4 470 404 471
The first bed has a coolant temperature of 345C to initiate the reaction by raising the temperature in the packed tubes. The temperature needed to maintain the reaction rate in the fourth bed gets too high and therefore separations and a recycle stream can be used after the second or third module. If less modules are used and a recycle stream is added, the temperature of the coolant can be kept relatively low and less expensive coolants may be used.
2.4. Heat management options
An advantage of a shell-and-tube design is the energy level is maintained in the system by using a coolant and therefore expensive intercooling is not needed. BFW-steam systems are typical coolants but are not viable due to the critical temperature of water, 374C. If one set of bundles is used with a large recycle, steam could be created on the shell-side and recovered. If two sets of bundles are used, a heat transfer oil such as, Dowtherm A, could be used but has a maximum cooling temperature of 400 °C. After two-three bundles, the coolant temperature is expected to exceed 400 °C, requiring a coolant able to run above that temperature. Above 400 °C, supercritical steam, used for cooling in nuclear reactors, is an option. The design follows similar to SCWC where circulating water pumps pressurize water above its critical pressure, which are fed to the shell side of the reactor, heated, and serves as a coolant. A turbine may then be used in a modified Rankine Cycle to convert captured heat. Other options include, thermoelectric coolers, heat pumps, and molten salt but all are expensive. Additionally, molten salt is difficult to manage as it requires expertise to avoid freeze-ups and line ruptures.
If a packed bed reactor design is used, cold shots or intercooling could be used to control the exothermic reaction. Heat can be recovered and integrated but energy levels are lost. The exotherms and temperatures needed to maintain the reaction are too high for C2-ODH therefore requiring a large recycle. A tubular reactor with shell side cooling maintains the energy level by running isothermally and controlling the shell side coolant.
3. Process intensification of C2-ODH
The processing for C2-ODH is minimal compared to that of CSP. Across the CPI, the separation and purification of products account for a majority of the energy consumed by chemical and manufacturing plants. Approximately half of the US industrial energy usage is due to chemical separations [9]. The high selectivity and conversion of the ODH reaction limits the byproducts created which reduces the number of separation unit operations needed. Scheme 2 shows the unit operations of conventional plants and of a C2-ODH plant. Gas crackers reduce the number of unit operations by 30% compared to liquid crackers. C2-ODH reduces the amount of unit operations by 80% compared liquid crackers.

Scheme 2. CSP vs ODH unit operations.
C2-ODH plant aligns well with conventional technologies, allowing for easy adoption and application. If a C2-ODH reactor is built as an add-on unit for conventional plants, traditional separations units, such as distillation, may be used while further separations are developed.
A comparison of CSP and C2-ODH energy efficiency and productivity are displayed in Table 3. A significant increase in energy efficiency is in part due to the elimination of unit operations, reduction in separations needed, and moderate operating temperatures. The overall energy efficiency of ODH indicates a 50% improvement over CSP. As C2-ODH is an exothermic reaction, the furnace energy for the endothermic conventional process is eliminated. The compression energy needed for CSP is reduced by 83% for C2-ODH due to better yields and component state.

Endothermic 0

Overall Energy Efficiency 2700 1300 kJ/kg
Rather than traditional distillation, the ethane-ethylene separation is could be done via a membrane at near ambient temperatures. Compact Membrane Systems is developing a facilitated transport membrane (FTM) for separating alkenes from alkanes. A facilitated silver transport membrane has the potential to cut energy, capital, and operating costs as conventional olefin/paraffin cryogenic distillation separations are extremely energy and cost intensive. Olefin/paraffin membrane separations have been studied for decades with increasing interest and developments in increasing selectivity and stability of ion-exchange membranes. The construction of propane dehydrogenation units around the world has led to recent developments pertaining to propane/propylene separations. Ethane/ethylene separations. The silver particles facilitate the transport of soluble olefins across the membrane with high selectivity yielding a high purity olefin permeate. The C2-ODH reactor effluent compositions are synergistic with optimal membrane feed compositions; water saturation has shown increased permeability ratio of ethylene to ethane [8].
If a membrane is used, minimal, if any, separations are needed before the reactor effluent enters the membrane because the reactor effluent composition integrates well with the desired membrane feed composition. It operates at near ambient temperatures and is capable of separating out high purity products (90+%) which has significant economic impact on energy savings compared to cryogenic distillation. An ethane recycle may be added for optimal recovery.
4. Economics
A standard required netback analysis was performed for CSP and ODH technologies using the processing information provided from Aspen HYSYS. This required netback is a cost of production and is used to compare the price of ethylene versus the current spot price or contract price.
Cost of production is based on variable, fixed, and cash costs. Variable costs are the raw material and utilities costs; they depend on the amount of ethylene produced. Fixed costs are costs sustained regardless the amount of ethylene produced. The fixed costs include labor, supervision, foremen, maintenance materials, insurance, direct overhead, and plant overhead. Cash costs are the sum of fixed and variable costs. Capital recovery corresponds to the total cost to cover cash costs and a profit, using a certain rate of return (13.5% ATROI). Table 4 shows the economics and potential savings that can be achieved by building a C2-ODH plant [10].
Table 4. Economics of CSP vs C2-ODH.
Economics CSP ODH Units
Capacity 1 1 MTPA
Plant Capital Cost 1530 695 $$ MM USD
Capital Recovery 0.38 0.17 $ USD/kg C2H4
Fixed Cost 0.14 0.07 $ USD/kg C2H4
Variable Cost 0.23 0.17 $ USD/kg C2H4
Cost of Production 765 421 $ USD/T C2H4
Economic Margin 435 779 $ USD/T C2H4
Shutdown economics of emerging technologies is used by industries to lower risk associated with building plants with new technology. Shutdown economics occurs when new technology is so economically attractive that the capital recovery is less than the cash costs of an existing plant. Therefore, the existing plants are unable to pay for cash costs because the new technology can achieve a profit at a lower price. As a result, the shutdown of the existing plant occurs. Shutdown economics are achieved for C2-ODH with or without using conventional separations units coupled with an ODH reactor.
5. Further studies and applications
Further experiments proving the refractory nature of ethylene is important as it plays a role as a diluent in the reactor. Oxygen flammability studies must be conducted to ensure safety in the design of the reactor. ODH using an M1 catalyst has further applications to a multitude of hydrocarbons other than ethane [4], [11], [12]. Additional studies on the application of ODH using the M1 catalyst [6] are listed below:
1)
Ethylbenzene to Styrene Monomer
2)
2-Methyl-2-Butene to Isoprene
3)
Mixed C4’s to 1,3-Butadiene
4)
Isobutane to Isobutene
5)
Propylene and Ammonia to Acrylonitrile and Acetonitrile
The US market for producing specialty petrochemicals is growing and gaps are forming from the transition from liquid crackers to gas crackers. Scheme 3 is a list of possible end products, coupling conventional technology with ODH technology, revealing a new CPI [4], [11], [12].

6. Conclusions
Ethylene is a commodity chemical with a growing capacity worldwide. CSP is the current method for producing ethylene from an either gas or liquid feedstock depending on location. The economics for CSP expressed, as margins, are extremely attractive yet C2-ODH shows potential for achieving shutdown economics of current CSP plants. C2-ODH uses the M1 catalyst to selectively dehydrogenate ethane and produce ethylene at low temperatures and pressures. The moderate conditions, nearly stoichiometric yields, and membrane separation of C2-ODH contribute to lowering the capital, operating, and energy costs. The chemical processing industry accounts for a large portion of the world’s carbon footprint; C2-ODH has the potential to drastically reduce the carbon footprint of the top petrochemical produced globally. C2-ODH is a simple, highly selective, exothermic process with the potential to revolutionize the chemical processing industry (CPI).
