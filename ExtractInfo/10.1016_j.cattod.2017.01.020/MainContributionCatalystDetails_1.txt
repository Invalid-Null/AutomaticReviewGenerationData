 Unfortunately the provided document does not seem to discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The document focuses on the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene using an M1 catalyst. Since propane dehydrogenation is not discussed, I will output that this document is not relevant and will not include the detailed analysis requested.
