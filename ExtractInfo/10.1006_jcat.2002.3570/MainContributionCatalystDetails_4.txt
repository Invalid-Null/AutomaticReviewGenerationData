 Based on the provided document, this does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane on alumina-supported vanadia catalysts. While propane ODH is mentioned, the focus seems to be on analyzing the effect of vanadia catalyst structure and surface density on ODH activity and selectivity for both ethane and propane, rather than specifically propane dehydrogenation.
