 Based on the document, this does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane and propane on alumina-supported vanadia catalysts. While propane is mentioned, the focus seems to be comparing the catalytic properties for ODH of ethane vs propane, rather than specifically on advancing PDH or ODH of propane to propylene.
