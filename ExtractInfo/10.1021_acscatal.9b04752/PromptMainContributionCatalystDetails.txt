Reducibility and Dispersion Influence the Activity in Silica-Supported Vanadium-Based Catalysts for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane: The Case of Sodium Decavanadate

Abstract
Calcined silica-supported sodium decavanadate (Na6V10O28/SiO2) is more active for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP) than the thermodynamically stable α-polymorph of sodium metavanadate (α-NaVO3/SiO2) and the silica-bound, site-isolated terminal vanadium oxo [VO4]/SiO2 benchmark catalyst. Calcination of Na6V10O28/SiO2 in air at 600 °C leads to a mixture of Na1+xV3O8, interacting with the silica support, and the metastable polymorph of sodium metavanadate, β-NaVO3. The formation of β-NaVO3 at this temperature is unexpected as β-NaVO3 supported on silica and calcined at the same conditions transforms into α-NaVO3. At 450 °C (temperature of the ODP reaction) in an inert atmosphere, Na6V10O28/SiO2 transforms predominantly to the reduced phase α′-NaV2O5 that displays poor activity in ODP. However, the deactivated material recovers the high activity of calcined Na6V10O28/SiO2 after ca. 3 h time on stream (TOS) or after 1 h in air (450 °C). This observation is consistent with the proposed link between the high catalytic activity in ODP and the reducibility of a V phase as neither the catalytic performance nor characteristic Raman bands of α-NaVO3/SiO2 and [VO4]/SiO2 change significantly in an inert atmosphere at 450 °C. Vanadium K-edge operando X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and in situ Raman mapping show that the oxidation of α′-NaV2O5 to a mixture of Na1+xV3O8 and β-NaVO3 occurs under ODP conditions within several minutes. In contrast, the initial activity recovers within hours (depending on the conditions), and it is explained mostly by slow redispersion of the Na1+xV3O8 phase on SiO2.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP, eq 1) is an “on-purpose” propene production technique that has several advantages relative to nonoxidative dehydrogenation of propane (PDH, eq 2). In particular, ODP is exothermic, it requires lower operating temperatures (ca. 400–500 vs 550–700 °C), features reduced coking due to the cofeeding of O2, and it avoids thermodynamic product limitations (e.g., 37% at 550 °C for PDH). (1−3) However, a yet unsolved challenge in the ODP using V-based catalysts is overoxidation, i.e., the preferred oxidation of propene over propane, that hampers achieving high propene selectivities at high propane conversions. (1−5)

Supported vanadium oxide catalysts are among the most active (3) and most studied (5) ODP catalysts. However, the yield of and the selectivity to propene under ODP conditions are not yet sufficiently high to allow an industrial deployment of this technology. (3)
Solid-state 51V NMR, (6−10) in situ X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES), (11,12) UV–vis, (12−14) and in situ Raman studies with 18O isotopic labeling (15,16) have shown that, below a monolayer coverage, supported V2O5 species exist as [VO4] sites, i.e., surface-bound terminal oxo V5+ species ((−O)3V═O), (17) as long as the support (TiO2, ZrO2, Al2O3, etc.) is dehydrated. Oligomeric [VO4] sites form at an increased vanadium loading, leading to a surface monolayer of vanadia or, at even higher loadings (>8–9 V nm–2 for oxide supports except for silica), (3,18−23) V2O5 nanoparticles, although properties of the support (composition, specific surface area, and synthesis method) also influence the nature of V surface species. (19,20,22−25) In general, the formation of V2O5 nanoparticles (>3 nm) correlates with reduced catalytic activity of V-based ODP catalysts. (3) V2O5 nanoparticles start to form on silica even at a submonolayer coverage (2.6–3.3 V nm–2). (19,20,24,25) However, the addition of a sodium promoter improves the dispersion of vanadia on SiO2, allowing for ca. 8.6 V nm–2, while still avoiding the formation of V2O5 (∼6.2 wt % V, 0.4 wt % Na+), thereby enhancing ODP space–time yield (STY) in such promoted catalysts until crystalline V2O5 and sodium metavanadate start to form at Na+ loadings of <0.4 and >1 wt %, respectively. (19) In addition to influencing the dispersion, a slight decrease in the turnover frequency (TOF) after promotion with sodium was observed for VOx/SiO2, presumably due to an interaction between Na+ and vanadyl sites resulting in a weaker V═O bond. (26) Furthermore, it has been reported that alkali metal dopants (Li, Na, and K) decrease the activity of alumina-supported vanadium-based ODP catalysts, (27) presumably, by decreasing the reducibility of V sites that operate via a redox mechanism involving V5+ as the initial state and V3+ or V4+ intermediates. (3,5,28−37)
This work aims to provide insight into the relationship between structure, reducibility, dispersion, selectivity, and activity of sodium vanadate-based ODP catalysts. Silica was utilized as a support due to its inertness (19) (Al2O3, ZrO2, or CeO2 might react with a vanadium precursor forming AlVO4, ZrV2O7, or CeVO4, respectively) (3) and to minimize the X-ray absorption by the support to facilitate the operando XANES study (vide infra). To this end, sodium decavanadate clusters, i.e., Na6V10O28, were dispersed on silica and calcined in air at 600 °C, yielding a mixture of β-NaVO3 and Na1+xV3O8 interacting with the silica support (this calcined material is denoted Na6V10O28/SiO2). The ODP activity of supported β-NaVO3, a metastable polymorph of NaVO3, has so far remained unexplored because the transformation of β-NaVO3 to α-NaVO3 occurs at lower temperatures than commonly used for ODP (in bulk materials at ca. 400 °C, Figures S1 and S2). (38)
We report that the specific activity of Na6V10O28/SiO2 is, respectively, 45 and 24% higher than that of α-NaVO3/SiO2 and the [VO4]/SiO2 reference catalysts at identical V loadings. This activity trend correlates with the higher reducibility of Na6V10O28/SiO2 as it readily converts to the α′-NaV2O5 phase on SiO2 (formal oxidation state of 4.5) under N2 flow at 450 °C. The easy reducibility could be linked to lower activation energies for accommodating various oxidation states and coordination geometries of the catalytic cycle for ODP. Experiments using operando XANES and in situ Raman scattering mapping show that the reduced α′-NaV2O5 phase is quickly reoxidized to β-NaVO3 and Na1+xV3O8 (in approximately 12 min) in ODP conditions. However, recovering the high activity of Na6V10O28/SiO2 takes ca. 3 h under reaction conditions, and it correlates, according to in situ Raman mapping and ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results, with the redispersion of Na1+xV3O8 and β-NaVO3 on the silica with time on stream (TOS). Only subtle changes in the pre-edge peak intensity and position in operando V K-edge XANES data were observed after the fast oxidation stage, which further reinforces the assertion that the redispersion of Na1+xV3O8 and β-NaVO3 with TOS (ca. 3 h) is the major driver for improving the catalytic activity of the reduced material with time on stream.

Incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) of an aqueous solution of Na6V10O28 onto silica (Aerosil 300, calcined at 600 °C, 286 m2 g–1) gives Na6V10O28/SiO2(IWI) with 2.0 wt % V loading as determined by inductively coupled plasma (ICP) analysis, corresponding approximately to 1 V nm–2, which is well below the monolayer coverage limit of ca. 2.6 V nm–2 for silica using IWI. (12) Since the nature of the surface vanadium species changes with dehydroxylation, (39) we treated Na6V10O28/SiO2(IWI) under a flow of synthetic air at 500 °C and then handled this dehydroxylated Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air) material for further characterization without exposure to air (such materials are labeled throughout the manuscript using subscript notations of the dehydroxylating temperature and the dehydroxylating gas).
Probing Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air) by 51V MAS NMR reveals several characteristic signals including a peak at −515 ppm assigned to β-NaVO3 (vanadium sites in a distorted trigonal bypiramidal geometry, TBP, Figure 1a). (40) The formation of the metastable β-sodium metavanadate polymorph in preference to the thermodynamically stable α-sodium metavanadate (vide infra) was unexpected. In addition to the peak at −515 ppm, there is a broad peak at ca. −600 ppm, reminiscent of crystalline Na1+xV3O8 that also gives a broad peak at around −590 ppm (Figure 1a). A reference material containing Na1+xV3O8 on silica at the same vanadium loading displays, after calcination and dehydration (Na1+xV3O8/SiO2(500-air)), a similar broad feature but is shifted further upfield, at ca. −615 ppm. While these peaks are similar in crystalline Na1+xV3O8 as well as in Na1+xV3O8/SiO2(500-air) and Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air), the peak positions in silica-supported materials are shifted upfield with respect to crystalline Na1+xV3O8 by approximately 25 and 10 ppm, respectively, suggesting an interaction between sodium trivanadate and SiO2. The nature of this interaction is likely related in both silica-supported materials, and the observed stronger upfield shift for Na1+xV3O8/SiO2(500-air) relative to Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air) (Figure 1a) could be caused by the presence of β-NaVO3 in Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air) or be due to the different Na/V ratios in these supported samples. We tentatively attribute the broad peaks at ca. −600 ppm in Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air) and −615 ppm in Na1+xV3O8/SiO2(500-air) to [VO4]/SiO2 sites interacting with Na+ cations because a similar feature was also observed as a broad shoulder at ca. −610 ppm in α-NaVO3/SiO2(500-air). The latter material displays a major peak of crystalline α-NaVO3 at −577 ppm (vanadium sites in a distorted Td environment, (40)Figure 1a). Note that this characteristic peak of α-NaVO3 is not clearly observed in Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air) or Na1+xV3O8/SiO2(500-air). At last, while the reference [VO4]/SiO2(500-air) (2.1 wt % V by ICP, ca. 1 V nm–2) features a broad peak at ca. −710 ppm (8,25) (Figure 1a), the interaction of [VO4]/SiO2 with Na+ was reported to shift this peak downfield to −675 ppm at a Na/V molar ratio of 0.2. (19) The difference in the peak position for [VO4]···Na+ sites observed in this work and in the literature could be due to the different nature and amount of the sodium phase used. (19)

23Na MAS NMR spectrum of Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air) shows two major peaks similar to those found for Na1+xV3O8/SiO2(500-air), indicating similar sodium environments in these two materials. However, the intensity of a more deshielded peak at −16 ppm in Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air) is increased compared to that in Na1+xV3O8/SiO2(500-air), and this is explained by the overlapping 23Na signal of the β-NaVO3 phase that is present in Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air) (Figure 1b). The splitting of the main peak of crystalline Na1+xV3O8 at around −21 ppm into two Na environments in Na1+xV3O8/SiO2(500-air) is in accordance with the interaction between Na1+xV3O8 and the silica surface, likely forming Na+···O═V(OSi≡)3 sites. Consistent with 51V MAS NMR results, no peak of α-NaVO3 is detected in Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air). 23Na MAS NMR of α-NaVO3/SiO2(500-air) shows two Na sites, as expected from its crystal structure. (40) However, the two Na peaks broaden and their ratio changes in α-NaVO3/SiO2(500-air) compared to that in crystalline α-NaVO3, possibly owing to the interaction of Na+ with the vanadyl [VO4]SiO2 sites, as mentioned above.
The Raman spectrum of Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air) shows characteristic bands that are assigned to crystalline β-NaVO3 (945 cm–1, VO2 symmetric stretching) (38) and sodium trivanadate Na1+xV3O8 interacting with silica (737 and 804 cm–1). The band at 804 cm–1 could be attributed to the V–O–V linkage bridging VO5 and VO6 units via a corner-sharing oxygen atom, by analogy to isostructural Li1+xV3O8 (Figure 1c). (41) However, this band is shifted by 7 cm–1 relative to that of the unsupported Na1+xV3O8 (811 cm–1). In addition, the band at 737 cm–1 has a notably higher intensity in Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air) and Na1+xV3O8/SiO2(500-air) than that in crystalline Na1+xV3O8, which might be due to the interaction of Na1+xV3O8 with silica. Based on the previous isotope labeling study of Li1+xV3O8, it is likely that the bands at 737 and 804 cm–1 (Figure 1c) originate from vibrational modes involving the sodium ion motion. (42) The characteristic band at 992 cm–1 (V═O stretching vibration in VO5 polyhedra) (41,42) is also observed in Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air), Na1+xV3O8/SiO2(500-air), and unsupported Na1+xV3O8 (see Figure S3 for the full range spectra). (12) Isolated vanadium oxo (V═O) sites in [VO4]/SiO2(500-air) give rise to a sharp peak at 1039 cm–1. (4,15) Such a sharp peak is observed neither in the Raman spectrum of Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air) nor in that of Na1+xV3O8/SiO2(500-air). However, the latter observation does not exclude the presence of [VO4]···Na+ sites in these two materials. (43)
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of Na6V10O28/SiO2 (exposed to air during the sample transfer) shows that the silica surface contains areas covered with small nanoparticles of ca. 2 nm in diameter, containing V and Na according to line scan analysis and areas without nanoparticles but with homogenously distributed V and Na according to EDX mapping (Figure 1d). We tentatively ascribe the areas of homogeneous distribution of Na and V to Na1+xV3O8, which is highly dispersed on the surface of silica. Given that the β-NaVO3 phase shows no shifts in 51V MAS NMR and Raman spectroscopy between the unsupported material and Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air), and given that β-NaVO3 is detected by these experimental techniques also in Na6V10O28/SiO2 exposed to air (Figures S3 and S4), the observed nanoparticles are ascribed to β-NaVO3. We note that obtaining high-resolution TEM data from small nanoparticles to confirm their structural assignment was hampered by their sensitivity to high doze rates of the electron beam.
Turning now to X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), the normalized intensity of the pre-edge peak in the V K-edge XANES spectra increases when the symmetry of the ligand sphere around the vanadium atom changes in the following order: octahedral (Oh), distorted octahedral, square pyramidal (SP), distorted tetrahedral, and tetrahedral (Td, Figure 1e). (12) Therefore, the intensity and the position of the pre-edge peak can be used to probe the (average) coordination environment around the V atom. (12,44) The dependence of the pre-edge peak intensity and its position on the coordination environment of V is shown in Figure S5. The V and Na K-edge XANES spectra of Na6V10O28/SiO2 are represented well by a linear combination fitting of β-NaVO3 and Na1+xV3O8/SiO2 references (Figures S6 and S7), in agreement with the results of NMR and Raman spectroscopy analyses of the dehydrated and hydrated samples. Unsupported β-NaVO3 was chosen as a XANES reference because silica-supported β-NaVO3 transforms to α-NaVO3 after calcination at 600 °C (Figure S8). (38)
To conclude, ssNMR, Raman, TEM, and XANES analyses indicate that Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air) and Na6V10O28/SiO2 materials contain β-NaVO3, likely present in the form of small nanoparticles, as well as sodium trivanadate Na1+xV3O8 interacting with the silica support in the dehydroxylated material. This interaction likely forms Na+···[VO4]/SiO2 species and/or oligomeric vanadia or vanadate structures. While the exact nature of these sites requires a separate study, it should be noted that the calcination of unsupported Na6V10O28 under identical conditions does not lead to β-NaVO3 but instead gives a mixture of Na1+xV3O8 and α-NaVO3, according to in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments (Figures S9 and S10), highlighting how the silica support influences the decomposition pathways of Na6V10O28. Figure 1f presents the crystal structures, vanadium coordination environments, and characteristic spectroscopic signatures of the discussed materials and summarizes the analyses above.
Remembering that V sites supposedly undergo a redox cycle during the ODP, we used thermal pretreatment in N2 at 500 °C as a test to probe the ease of reduction of the prepared V-based materials. We found that the thermal treatment of Na6V10O28/SiO2 in a N2 flow (500 °C, 1 h, material denoted Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-N2)) induces a redox reaction between β-NaVO3 and Na1+xV3O8/SiO2 that forms a reduced α′-NaV2O5 phase. Raman spectroscopy provides the clearest evidence for the presence of α′-NaV2O5 in Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-N2), revealing an intense band at 968 cm–1, characteristic of α′-NaV2O5, and no bands owing to Na1+xV3O8 and β-NaVO3 (Figures 1c and S3). (45−47) However, note that Raman spectroscopy is more sensitive to particles in preference to highly dispersed surface structures due to the lower Raman cross section for the latter species; (39) therefore, some Na1+xV3O8/SiO2 may remain in Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-N2). Consistent with these results, 51V MAS NMR shows that Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-N2) contains no peak at −515 ppm, characteristic of β-NaVO3, while a broad peak at ca. −600 ppm shifts to −615 ppm, which is very close to the position of peaks in Na1+xV3O8/SiO2(500-air) (Figure 1a). Since we obtained no 51V MAS NMR signal from the unsupported paramagnetic α′-NaV2O5, (48) the broad feature at −615 ppm is likely due to remaining Na1+xV3O8/SiO2 species that were not paramagnetically bleached by α′-NaV2O5. The 23Na MAS NMR spectrum of Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-N2) reveals a new Na environment with a peak position similar to that of α′-NaV2O5 (−48 ppm) along with the disappearance of the peak due to β-NaVO3. The intensity of the more deshielded Na environment at −16 ppm in Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-N2) is significantly decreased compared to that in Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air) (Figure 1b). According to V K-edge XANES, the in situ-prepared Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) material (here, we used 450 °C, which is the temperature of the catalytic ODP experiment) is more reduced and features a lower normalized height of the pre-edge peak compared to that of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-air) (edge energies of 5481.9 and 5482.7 eV and normalized pre-edge peak heights of 0.67–0.76, respectively; Figure 1e). Both changes (intensity and position of the pre-edge feature) are consistent with the formation of reduced α′-NaV2O5 with vanadium sites in a square-based pyramid (SP) geometry. In general, α′-NaV2O5 features VO5 units as layers sharing edges and corners in the a–b plane with equivalent V atoms of an average oxidation state of +4.5 (Figure 1f). (48−50) To summarize, our data suggest that β-NaVO3 reacts with dispersed Na1+xV3O8 in Na6V10O28/SiO2 when heated up in an inert atmosphere to 450–500 °C, yielding reduced α′-NaV2O5 (likely accompanied by the release of oxygen). In contrast to reduction under a N2 atmosphere that is observed only for Na6V10O28/SiO2, in the more reducing conditions of H2 temperature-programmed reduction experiments, all three catalysts are reduced (Figure S11).
The catalytic activity of the prepared materials for the ODP was compared at 450 °C (C3H8/air = 2:5, at weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) = 6.8 h–1 based on the propane flow rate) using either air or a N2 pretreatment (Figure 2a). Typical propane conversions at 450 °C were between ca. 1 and 9% for the four WHSVs studied (5.1–13.6 h–1). At the same conversion (4.3%), Na6V10O28/SiO2(500-air) showed a higher productivity (0.41 kgC3H6 kgcat–1 h–1) compared to that of [VO4]/SiO2 (0.16 kgC3H6 kgcat–1 h–1) at a slightly lower selectivity (70 vs 76%, Figure 2b). It is worth mentioning that our selectivity and productivity data for the benchmark catalyst [VO4]/SiO2, presented in Figure 2b, match well the literature data for this catalyst. (2) Interestingly, we observe that Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) has a significantly lower initial specific activity compared to that of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-air) (ca. 0.5 vs 3.3 mmol C3H6 mol V–1 s–1 with respective selectivities to propene at 79 and 62%, Figure 2a). We tentatively ascribe the high selectivity to propene (at a low conversion of ca. 1.5%) to remaining small amounts of highly dispersed Na1+xV3O8 sites on silica. However, the activity of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) increases with time on stream, while the selectivity to propene drops, reaching the performance of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-air) after ca. 3 h, both in terms of propane conversion and propene selectivity (Figure 2c). This catalytic data suggests the evolution of α′-NaV2O5 in Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) to the same active species as those in Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-air). Comparison of the 51V and 23Na MAS NMR spectra of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-air) and Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) after 4 h TOS reveals features of β-NaVO3 and Na1+xV3O8/SiO2 (Figures S12 and S13). As the reaction mixture contains both a reductant (hydrocarbons, CO) and an oxidant (O2), an additional catalytic test was performed using only air treatment after the N2 pretreatment to verify whether the catalytic activity of the calcined sample would be recovered faster after air treatment. Indeed, the exposure of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) to air for 1 h at 450 °C completely recovers the catalytic activity, reforming β-NaVO3 and Na1+xV3O8/SiO2 (see Figures S14 and S15 for catalytic and Raman spectra, respectively).

In a sharp contrast, α-NaVO3/SiO2 and the reference catalyst [VO4]/SiO2 show little change in activity or selectivity in ODP, displaying stable performances independent of the pretreatment conditions (at an identical nominal V coverage of ca. 1 V nm–2; see Figure 2a for the initial activity and Figures S16 and S17 for changes of activity and selectivity with TOS). Furthermore, according to Raman spectroscopy, neither α-NaVO3/SiO2 nor [VO4]/SiO2 undergoes structural changes upon N2 treatment at 450 °C (Figure S18). Among the air-pretreated catalysts, [VO4]/SiO2 has the highest selectivity toward propene (74% at 2.5 mmol C3H6 mol V–1 s–1), while α-NaVO3/SiO2 shows the lowest initial activity and propene selectivity (1.8 mmol C3H6 mol V–1 s–1 and 30%, respectively, Figure 2a).
To obtain insight into the evolution of the oxidation state and coordination environment of vanadium during the activation period of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) under ODP conditions, an operando V K-edge XANES experiment was conducted using a capillary flow reactor while monitoring the composition of the effluent gas with a compact GC and a time resolution of 3 min per chromatogram (WHSV ca. 9.7 h–1, Figure 2d–f). Exposure of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) to the feed gas at 450 °C rapidly shifts the edge position to higher energies (from 5481.9 to 5482.6 eV) and increases the normalized pre-edge peak height (from 0.67 to 0.81) within the first 12 min of TOS (initial stage, Figure 2d). This is explained by the fast reoxidation of α′-NaV2O5 to Na1+xV3O8/SiO2 and β-NaVO3. After this rapid reoxidation, the catalytic activity continues to rise with TOS, approximately for the next 3 h. Overall, the operando XAS results are very similar to the experiment in a laboratory packed-bed reactor that used a lower WHSV of 6.8 h–1 (Figure 2c and Figure S19). The changes in the XANES spectra with TOS after 12 min are very subtle and, yet, can be visualized by the difference XANES spectra obtained by subtracting the current XANES spectrum from the last spectrum in the operando experiment, i.e., after TOS = 242 min at the point of maximum activity (Figure 2e). The coordination environment of the V atom and its correlation to the pre-edge peak height and absorption energy position indicate that Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) evolves in the ODP experiment, reaching ultimately values that are typical for vanadate ions in a distorted Td environment (Figure 2f). Overall, the operando XANES experiment suggests that the local structure of the V atoms in Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) changes rapidly with TOS, consistent with the fast reformation of oxidized Na1+xV3O8 and β-NaVO3 species. As a consequence, it is conceivable that the significantly slower process that is responsible for the restoration of the catalytic activity of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) proceeds at a different length scale (nano/micrometer rather than atomic scale) and possibly involves changes in the dispersion of vanadium species on the silica support.
To probe the validity of this hypothesis, we followed the structural evolution of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) during the ODP using in situ Raman mapping (Linkam CCR1000 cell maintained at 450 °C for 12 and 240 min under a reactive gas flow, Figure 3a). In total, 342 points (380 × 360 μm2) separated by 20 μm were used, and Raman maps were prepared based on the intensity of the characteristic peaks of α′-NaV2O5, β-NaVO3, and Na1+xV3O8/SiO2 phases (Figure 3b). The intensity of the Raman band in the range of 967–969 cm–1 was used for the mapping of the α′-NaV2O5 phase. The maximal intensities of Raman bands in the ranges of 937–942 and 760–815 cm–1 were used for the β-NaVO3 and Na1+xV3O8/SiO2 species, respectively. For higher signal-to-noise ratios, all spectra were acquired at room temperature (RT) after cooling down the catalyst under ODP conditions and switching to a N2 atmosphere at room temperature (RT) for data acquisition. Due to the adsorption of water produced during ODP on the catalyst surface upon cooling to RT, there is a 3–5 cm–1 red shift in the bands of β-NaVO3 phase and a 20–65 cm–1 blue shift for the bands of Na1+xV3O8 species (Figure 3b). The intense Raman signal due to α′-NaV2O5 in Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) disappears completely after 12 min TOS, in agreement with the fast oxidation of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) observed by operando XANES. The disappearance of α′-NaV2O5 after 12 min TOS coincides with the formation of β-NaVO3 as well as Na1+xV3O8/SiO2. After 240 min TOS, the signal intensities due to β-NaVO3 and Na1+xV3O8/SiO2 had increased, suggesting a higher dispersion at this point.

(a) In situ Raman mapping (after cooling down to room temperature) of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) with TOS of the ODP of propane; (b) Raman spectra at selected points (A, B, and C; for locations, see the middle left panel in (a)); and (c) TEM-EDX of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) at 0, 12, and 240 min TOS at 450 °C, propane/air = 2:5, and total flow rates of 2.1 and 21 mL min–1 for the in situ Raman and catalytic experiments, respectively. For each measurement, a fresh Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) catalyst was used and the reacted catalysts were cooled down to room temperature under a reactive gas atmosphere.
Following the morphological evolution of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) with TOS by ex situ TEM-EDX mapping with selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) reveals that Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) (0 min TOS, i.e., directly after the N2 pretreatment) contains an agglomerated phase containing Na and V, which is assigned to α′-NaV2O5 based on the spectroscopic characterization discussed above (Figure 3c, top panel). After 12 min TOS, associated with a partial recovery of the catalytic activity, nano- and even microsized rods appear on the silica support (Figure 3c, middle panel). SAED analysis of such a crystal reveals that its diffraction pattern can be indexed to that of Na1.164V3O8 oriented along the [102] zone axis (Figure 3c, middle panel and inset, and Figure S20). While the formation of microsized rods clearly indicates a poor dispersion of the trivanadate phase after 12 min TOS, we note that both Raman spectroscopy and EDX mapping were performed at room temperature, which might have exacerbated the poor dispersion due to crystal growth while cooling down the specimen to room temperature. However, after 240 min TOS, the rods had nearly disappeared (only scarce nanorods of ca. 100 nm were detected during the survey of various specimen areas), confirming that the redispersion of Na and V took place on the silica support during the 3 h activation stage. These results of Raman spectroscopy and TEM-EDX mapping are also consistent with similar 21Na and 51V ssNMR spectra of Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-N2) and Na6V10O28/SiO2(450-air) after 240 min TOS.
Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In summary, the calcination in air of the sodium decavanadate precursor Na6V10O28 on SiO2 yielded the metastable β-NaVO3 phase and Na1+xV3O8 interacting with the silica support. This catalyst exceeds the activity of the reference catalysts [VO4]/SiO2 and α-NaVO3/SiO2 by 24 and 45%, respectively. In contrast to α-NaVO3/SiO2 and [VO4]/SiO2 that are structurally stable under inert gas conditions, β-NaVO3 and Na1+xV3O8/SiO2 in Na6V10O28/SiO2 react when heated to 450–500 °C under N2, yielding a reduced phase, α′-NaV2O5. This process is reversible, and under the conditions of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane or in air, α′-NaV2O5 transforms back to β-NaVO3 and Na1+xV3O8/SiO2. However, the oxidation under ODP conditions occurs rapidly, within 12 min, and gives large crystallites of Na1+xV3O8 that slowly redisperse on the support with TOS (ca. 3 h), increasing the number of the exposed active sites and thereby enhancing catalytic activity. Our results confirm the key roles of dispersion and reducibility; the latter is relevant, given the redox mechanism of the ODP reaction on vanadium-based ODP catalysts. The work to delineate the contributions from Na1+xV3O8/SiO2 and β-NaVO3 to the enhanced activity of Na6V10O28/SiO2 is currently underway in our laboratory.

    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
