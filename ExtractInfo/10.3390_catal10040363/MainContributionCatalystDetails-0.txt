 Unfortunately I do not have multiple extractions from the same document to synthesize. The provided documents focused on oxidative dehydrogenation of n-octane, not propane dehydrogenation. Since none of the documents were relevant, I do not have any data to aggregate into a unified XML output. Please provide relevant propane dehydrogenation documents containing extractable catalyst details so I can demonstrate summarization and XML formatting of the key information. I'm happy to synthesize findings once given applicable source material.
