 Based on my analysis, this document does not contain information directly related to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) for converting propane to propylene. The document focuses on partial oxidation of propane using CO2 as an oxidant over Ru-doped CeO2 and ZrO2 catalysts. While some propylene formation is mentioned, it does not appear to be the primary focus.
