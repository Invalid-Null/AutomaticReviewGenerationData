 Based on my analysis of the document, this study does not seem directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation for converting propane to propylene. The document discusses the partial oxidation of propane using CO2 as an oxidant over Ru-doped CeO2 and ZrO2 catalysts, but does not mention dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
