Abstract
Co-based catalysts have attracted much attention for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) because of their low price, environmental friendliness, and high activity, while the synthesis of anti-reduction Co species to suppress cracking side reactions to realize high-performance PDH is critical. In this work, different Co species over Silicalite-1 are synthesized via modulating heat-treatment atmosphere and investigated for PDH systematically. In comparison with O2-included calcination catalyst, the TOF of Co-S-1-Ar (41.9 h−1) for PDH is about nine times that of Co/S-1-Air (4.6 h−1). According to the combined characterizations, it is confirmed that the highly dispersed tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework with Lewis acid sites over Co-S-1-Ar is responsible for the superior PDH performance, while bulk aggregated Co3O4 species in Co/S-1-Air has much lower catalytic performance. Through in-situ FT-IR characterization, it is revealed that Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar is incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework via replacing the silanol nests of Silicalite-1, in which the Co precursors are driven by Ar to reach the silanol nests highly dispersed and then further anchored by silanol nests and incorporated Silicalie-1 framework with Co2+ species under high temperature calcination, and the other oxygen-free calcination atmosphere, such as H2 and vacuum, are also intensified to be practicable.

1. Introduction
Propylene is a vital and basic building block in petrochemical industry, which could be used for the synthesis of various chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, and acrylonitrile etc [1, 2]. Currently, the primary processes for the production of propylene are fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha, while they suffer from high-energy consumption, low propylene selectivity and could not meet the increasing demand for propylene. In recent decade, with the development of shale-gas and nature gas hydrate extraction technology, raw material propane becomes more abundant and cheaper, correspondingly, propane dehydrogenation to propylene (PDH) is considered as one of the most promising routes to obtain propylene with the advantages of high propylene selectivity [1, 3]. Nowadays, two industrialized PDH production processes, the Catofin (Lummus) and Oleflex (UOP) technologies are mainly relied on Cr- and Pt-based catalysts, respectively [3, 4]. However, the high price and easy agglomeration of Pt and the environmental toxicity of Cr greatly restrict the further development of the PDH technology. Correspondingly, the development of environmentally friendly and low-cost catalysts is widely investigated, while they still present a much lower catalytic performance [5]. Hence, the development of low cost, highly active and environmentally benign PDH catalyst is increasingly urgent [6].
Due to the earth abundance and low toxicity of Co, as well as the high-efficiency activating C-H, Co-based catalysts are attracting more and more attention in PDH [7], [8], [9]. However, not all Co species possess prominent catalytic activity for PDH. It is reported that the states of active sites valence and metal dispersion are critical since they could affect the catalytic performance and product selectivity greatly. As for the Co-based catalysts in PDH, it is reported that the tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species over Al2O3 [10], [11], [12], [13] and SiO2 [14], [15], [16], [17] show high propylene selectivity and catalytic activity, while CoOx clusters and Co3O4 particles would result in severe side reactions including propane cracking and generating coke. Because of the existence of H2 in PDH reactive atmosphere, the maintenance of stable cobalt species in reaction process is vital and challengeable, unstable cobalt species such as Co3O4 and CoO species are very easy to be reduced and would further result in decreased catalytic performance. Recently, Dai et al [13] reported the isolate Co2+ species stabilized by the γ-Al2O3 matrix via one-step hydrothermal method, in which the Co2+ species exhibited anti-reduction and had excellent PDH catalytic performance. Besides, Yang and Xie et al [18, 19] synthesized the Fe and Zn species incorporated into the framework of MFI zeolite by hydrothermal route and applied to alkane dehydrogenation reaction, the stabilized of Fe and Zn species by zeolite framework facilitated the catalytic activity. Recently, we hydrothermally synthesized the atomically dispersed Co2+ sites incorporated into a Silicalite‑1 zeolite framework successfully, which showed highly catalytic stability and coking resistance in a 3560 min time-on-stream [14], while the hydrothermal method is more complicated compared with conventional incipient wetness impregnation method. Subsequently, we are continuously considering developing facile strategies to isolate and stabilize Co species effectively from aggregation. Catalyst synthesized via changing the calcination atmosphere seems to be an effective way. Recently, Dai and Peeters et al. reported the fundamental role of the heat-treatment atmosphere in the Sn-based zeolite catalysts, in which the inert gas or vacuum calcination atmosphere promoted the Sn sites into the framework of dealuminzation Beta, while the air calcination atmosphere resulted in the generation of extra-framework SnOx species on the catalyst [20, 21]. In addition, Jeon et al. reported that different Co species distribution over Co/Al2O3 catalyst could be obtained by changing the supported Co precursor heat-treating atmospheres with O2, Ar and H2, respectively, and Co/Al2O3-H2 shows superior performance compared with Co/Al2O3-O2 and Co/Al2O3-Ar, which is due to the highest ratio of Co2+ species stabilized in CoAl2O4 under H2 treatment atmosphere [22].
In this work, Co-based Silicalite-1 precursor is synthesized via solid-phase grinding (SPG) of Co precursor and Silicalite-1, followed by further heat-treated at 550 °C under oxidative atmosphere (air) or oxygen-free atmosphere (Ar, 5%H2/Ar and vacuum) to obtain Co/S-1-Air, Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum catalysts, respectively. It is found that Co-S-1-Ar shows superior catalytic performance with the TOFCo of 41.9 h−1 for PDH, which is nine times that of Co/S-1-Air (4.6 h−1), and the catalytic performance over Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum via the oxygen-free calcination atmosphere are similar with that of Co-S-1-Ar. Systematic characterizations including XRD, ICP-OES, TEM, N2 physisorption, NH3-TPD, Py-IR, H2-TPR, UV-Vis, Raman, XPS, TG as well as in situ FT-IR are used to reveal the nature of high PDH catalytic performance in Co-S-1-Ar. And it is demonstrated that the enhanced catalytic activity over Co-S-1-Ar is attributed to the highly dispersed tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ species incorporated into the zeolite framework via replacing the silanol nests under oxygen-free heat-treatment. This work explores the effects of different heat-treatment atmospheres in Co-S-1 for PDH and reveals the formation process of Co2+ species during the oxygen-free heat-treatment, which provides a new insight into the development of high-performance PDH catalyst design.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
2.1.1. Synthesis of Silicalite-1
Silicalite-1 was synthesized with molar composition 1.0 SiO2: 0.18 TPAOH: 18 H2O under conventional hydrothermal conditions at 170°C for 2 days as described previously. Afterward, the as-synthesized precursor was centrifuged and washed with deionized water, and then dried at 80°C for 8 h. Finally, it was further calcined at 550°C for 6 h in air with heating rate 1°C·min−1 to obtain the final product Silicalite-1.
2.1.2. Preparation of Co-based Silicalite-1 catalysts
Co-based Silicalite-1 catalysts were synthesized via solid-phase grinding (SPG). In a typical synthesis, an appropriate amount of Co(NO3)2·6H2O and Silicalite-1 were mixed and manually grounded for 60 min in a pestle and mortar. Then the mixed precursor was pretreated with different gas atmosphere (Ar, air, 5%H2/Ar and vacuum) (50mL·min‑1) at room temperature for 30 minutes and heated to 550°C (1°C·min‑1) for 6 h in a quartz tube inside a tubular oven. The final obtained catalysts via oxygen-free calcination atmosphere (Ar, 5%H2/Ar and vacuum) and air calcination atmosphere were labeled as xCo-S-1-y and xCo/S-1-y, respectively, where x refers to the mass percentage of Co (x = 0.6, 1.6 and 2.4), y represents the heat-treatment gas atmosphere, including air, Ar, 5%H2/Ar and vacuum. If no special mentioned, the mass percentage of Co is 1.6wt%.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on a Rigaku Smartlab diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation and a nickel filter in the 2θ angle range from 5 to 90o at 35 kV and 25 mA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were recorded by a FEI Talos F200X at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Inductively coupled plasma optic emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) was performed on an iCAP-7000 Plus series spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher). Nitrogen physisorption was carried out on an ASAP 2020 (Micrometrics) instrument at 77 K after outgassing the samples for 6 h under a vacuum at 300°C. The UV-Visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-Vis) were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2400PC spectrophotometer using a BaSO4 plate as a reference. UV-Raman spectra were recorded on a UV-RAMAN100 Raman spectrometer made by Beijing Zolix Instruments Co., Ltd. A 244 nm line of a LEXEL laser of a He-Ge laser was used as the excitation source. XPS spectra were obtained on an ESCAlab250xi electron spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) with monochromatic 150 Wal Kα radiation, and the reported binding energies were calibrated against the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV.
The temperature-programmed experiments were tested on an AutoChem II 2920 instrument (Micrometrics) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. In a typical H2-TPR analysis, 100 mg of the catalyst was pretreated with He (30 mL·min−1) for 1 h at 300 °C, followed by cooling down to 50°C; then the sample was reduced in a flow of 5% H2/Ar mixture (20 mL·min−1) from 50 to 850°C with a heating rate of 10°C·min−1. In the NH3-TPD experiment, samples of 100 mg were pretreated at 600°C under He (30 mL·min−1) for 1 h, The adsorption of NH3 was carried out at 50°C for 1h, followed by purging with helium at 100°C for 2 h to remove physisorbed NH3 from the catalyst surface. The TPD profile was recorded at a heating rate of 5°C·min−1 from 100 to 550°C. For the C3H8-TPD, 100 mg of each sample was pretreated at 600°C for 1 h under 30 mL·min−1 5% H2/Ar and then cooled to 50°C; then, the sample was exposed under C3H8 flow (30 mL· min−1) for 30 min until saturation, followed by purging with He for 30 min to remove physisorbed C3H8. The temperature was then ramped to 600°C at 10°C·min−1 and held for 1 h until complete desorption of C3H8.
Py-IR characterization methods were performed using a BRUKER TENSOR II spectrometer (Xianquan Industrial and Trading Co., Ltd.). The sample was pressed into self-supporting disks. Then, the sample was evacuated at 450°C for 1h in the vacuum (6.3E-7 mbar), and the sample cell was cooled down to room temperature. Pyridine vapor was introduced into the sample cell for 30 min at room temperature. The FITR spectra of all the samples were taken after the sample cell was evacuated at elevated temperatures (50-200°C).
In-situ FT-IR experiments were collected on a Nicolet iS50 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Typically, the sample was transferred into the Praying mantis in situ cell (Harrick Scientific Product). Ar was fed into the cell with a flow rate of 20 mL·min−1. The cell temperature was increased to 300 °C (10 °C·min−1) and maintained, then the FT-IR spectra of catalyst was collected after subtracting background spectrum.
2.3. Catalytic performance evaluation
Propane dehydrogenation was performed in a quartz fixed-bed reactor with 7 mm inner diameter. In a typical experiment, a mixture of 50 mg of catalysts and 250 mg of quartz sand of 40-60 mesh was loaded in the reactor. Before the reaction, the catalyst was pretreated with 10 mL·min−1 5% H2/Ar at 600°C for 2 h. Then a reaction gas mixture (10 mL·min−1 5% C3H8/Ar and 10 mL·min−1 5% H2/Ar) was passed through the fixed-bed quartz reactor. Finally, the reactor was heated to the desired temperature and the outlet products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (GC-2014, Shimazu, Japan) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a TCD detector to detect hydrogen. The C3H8 conversion, the selectivity of C3H6 and TOFCo were calculated according to the following equations:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterizations
Fig. 1A shows the XRD patterns of the synthesized samples. Both Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air samples show the characteristic peaks of MFI structure at 8.0o, 8.9o, 23.2o, 23.9o and 24.3o [23, 24], suggesting that the structure of MFI is maintained after calcination at different atmospheres. No diffraction peaks of Co3O4 species (PDF#43-1003) are observed on both Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air samples, indicating that the Co species on both prepared samples are highly dispersed or the crystal sizes of Co species is lower than the detection limitation of XRD. The nitrogen adsorption isotherms of Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air are shown in Fig. 1B. It could be found that both Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air samples exhibit the typical adsorption behavior of microporous material with a type of I isotherm [25]. And the total pore volumes, specific surface area, microporous volume and mesoporous volume over Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air are also comparable (Table 1).

Fig. 2A and F show the TEM images of prepared samples. It is found that both Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air present a uniform size of about 150-200 nm. Moreover, no evident Co particles or clusters are detectable in the TEM images of Co-S-1-Ar catalyst compared with obvious CoOx clusters on the Co/S-1-Air catalyst, which indirectly indicates that the Co species are possibly incorporated into the Silicalite-1 zeolite framework over Co-S-1-Ar. The further elemental mapping results show that Si, O and Co elements in Co-S-1-Ar are dispersed homogeneously in comparison with the aggregation of CoOx particles of Co/S-1-Air, indicating that Co species is uniformly dispersed on the Co-S-1-Ar.

The catalyst acidity is characterized by NH3-TPD, as shown in Fig. 3A. It could be found that Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air catalysts exhibit NH3 desorption peaks at 100-550 °C and 300-500 °C, respectively, indicating that the Co-S-1-Ar shows weak and medium strong acid sites in comparison with slight medium strong acid sites of Co/S-1-Air [26]. The further quantitative analysis in Table 1 indicates the total amount of acid sites (0.09 mmol NH3·g−1) over Co-S-1-Ar is three times that of Co/S-1-Air (0.03 mmol NH3·g−1). In addition, the corresponding acid types over these two catalysts are further identified by Py-IR, as shown in Fig. 3B and Table S1. In comparison with Co/S-1-Air, the IR spectra of Co-S-1-Ar at various temperatures after pyridine desorption all present a higher intensity of the absorption band at around 1450 and 1610 cm−1 corresponding to the Lewis acid sites, demonstrating that Co-S-1-Ar has stronger Lewis acid sites[27,28].

3.2. Catalytic performance evaluation
The catalytic performance of PDH over Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air as a function of time on stream are evaluated, as shown in Fig. 4. The carbon balance remains above 98% in all experiments, as shown in Fig. S1. It could be found that the propane conversion of the Co-S-1-Ar catalyst reaches about 27% initially and then decreases to about 23% after 600 min time on stream, while the Co/S-1-Air catalyst shows a much lower propane conversion of about 5%. On the other hand, it is noted that the propylene selectivity of Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air catalysts in the initial 60 min increases from 88% to 95%, 75% to 85%, respectively, and then keeps stable during the next 540 min time on stream. The highly propylene selectivity over Co-S-1-Ar could be ascribed to the presence of superior stable Co species in comparison with that of Co/S-1-Air, which is demonstrated by subsequent characterizations. In addition, to further reveal the catalytic performance difference of these two catalysts, the propylene yield and TOFCo are calculated and compared with previous reports, as shown in Fig. 4B, Fig. S2, Fig. S3 and Table S2. Assuming that all cobalt atoms are active sites, the TOFCo of Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air at time 600 min are 41.9 and 4.6 h−1, respectively, indicating that the TOFCo of Co-S-1-Ar is about nine times that of Co/S-1-Air and is higher than those obtained in most previous reports (Fig. S3 and Table S2). Above PDH catalytic result demonstrates that the Co supported Silicalite-1 via Ar-calcined atmosphere could improve PDH catalytic activity significantly in comparison with air-calcined atmosphere. In addition, the further catalyst stability of Co-S-1-Ar is evaluated during 50 h on stream, as shown in Fig. S4, which demonstrates that Co-S-1-Ar has highly catalytic stability in PDH.

TOFCo of Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air is calculated at time 600 min with reaction conditions: 0.050 g of catalyst, 20 mL·min−1 5 vol % C3H8/Ar, 20 mL·min−1 5 vol % H2/Ar, 550°C.
3.3. The natural of Co species
In order to reveal the natural difference of PDH catalytic performance over Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air, systematic characterization techniques are used to clarify the chemical state of Co species. Firstly, H2-TPR is adopted to evaluate the reduction behavior of Co species in both catalysts, and the H2 consumption versus temperature plot is shown in Fig. 5. It is noted that two obvious peaks at 354 and 414 °C appear over Co3O4 samples, corresponding to the reduction of Co3O4 species to CoO species and the further reduction of CoO species to Co species, respectively [13]. For the Co/S-1-Air catalyst, a salient peak is observed at 337 °C, corresponding to the reduction of Co3O4 species to CoO species [28, 29]. However, a different reduction curve is obtained on the Co-S-1-Ar catalyst where a barely visible peak exists at 417 °C, demonstrating that almost all Co species are difficult to be reduced, which could be ascribed to the incorporation of mostly Co species into Silicalite-1 zeolite framework, resulting in the anti-reduction of Co species over Co-S-1-Ar catalyst. And it is noted that the activation and reaction temperature in current reaction condition is 600 °C and 550 °C, respectively, hence the Co species in Co-S-1-Ar should remain stable during the whole catalytic reaction.

The coordination states of Co species in both catalysts are further analyzed by the UV-Vis and UV-Raman characterizations, as shown in Fig. 6. From the UV-Vis spectra results in Fig. 6A, both Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air catalysts show adsorption bands at about 210 and 260 nm, which are corresponding to the structure of MFI topology [30]. Hence, it is confirmed that the calcination atmospheres do not affect the structure of MFI based on the UV-Vis and XRD characterization results. It is noted that two absorption peaks located at around 470 and 741 nm attributed to Co3O4 species are observed in Co/S-1-Air catalyst [16]. While Co-S-1-Ar exhibits three absorption peaks at approximately 520, 592 and 649 nm, which are associated with the Co2+ ions in a tetrahedral geometry [14, 17], suggesting the mainly existence of the tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ in Co-S-1-Ar catalyst. Additionally, UV-Raman spectra result of these samples is shown in Fig. 6B, both Co/S-1-Air and Co-S-1-Ar show obvious adsorption bands at about 380 and 808 cm−1, corresponding to the structure of MFI typology [31, 32]. The Raman bands at 465, 521, 613 and 680 cm−1 appear in Co/S-1-Air catalyst [31], which are assigned to Co3O4 species on the Co/S-1-Air. While the Co-S-1-Ar catalyst is dominated by framework Co2+ sites with the characteristic bands at 1076 and 1160 cm−1 [33, 34], in accordance with previous UV-Vis results.

The XPS technique could be used to analyze the surface Co oxidation states and relative concentrations, and the corresponding Co 2p XPS results of Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air catalysts before and after the reaction are shown in Fig. 7, Fig. S5 and Table S3. To compare the effect of different calcination atmospheres on the Co valence state more straightly, a curve-fitting procedure of photoelectron peaks is performed, and the specific fitting parameters are shown in Table S4. The XPS spectrum of broad Co 2p3/2 peak is deconvoluted into the two peaks at 780.0 eV and 781.2 eV, corresponding to Co3+ and Co2+ species, respectively [35]. And it is noted that the proportion of Co2+ species in Co-S-1-Ar surface is 100%, which indicates that the Co2+ content dominates in the surface of Co-S-1-Ar. In addition, the proportion of Co2+ species over spent Co-S-1-Ar catalyst after reaction maintains unchanged, which indicates that this Co2+ species is very stable and is possibly attributed to the incorporation of Co sites into the framework of Silicalite-1 zeolites. On the other hand, as for Co/S-1-Air catalyst in Co 2p XPS, two obvious peaks at 780.0 eV and 781.2 eV corresponding to Co3+ and Co2+ species are observed in the fresh Co/S-1-Air, and the proportion of Co3+/Co2+ is 44/56, indicating that mainly Co3O4 species exists in the fresh Co/S-1-Air catalyst. And after 600 min time-on-stream, the Co species on spent Co/S-1-Air is mainly dominated with Co2+ species with the increased peak band at 781.2 eV, suggesting that partially Co3+ species is reduced to Co2+ species in the spent Co/S-1-Air catalyst, and these Co2+ species are not well-dispersed and cannot exert its full dehydrogenation capacity during the PDH reaction. The XPS result is well consistent with previous H2-TPR, UV-Vis and UV-Raman results.

In addition, it is reported that C3H8 adsorption behavior would affect the catalytic performance, and the more propane adsorbed by the catalyst, the better catalytic performance is obtained with more reaction time generally [14]. Correspondingly, C3H8-TPD experiment over both two catalysts are investigated, as shown in Fig. 8. It could be found that only one propane desorption peak at 92 °C and 110 °C appears over Co/S-1-Air and Co-S-1-Ar, which is ascribed to the adsorption of C3H8 to corresponding Co2+ species [14]. And the further quantitative analysis of C3H8 adsorption content over Co-S-1-Ar catalyst is about four times that of Co/S-1-Air catalyst. The high C3H8 adsorption amount over Co-S-1-Ar catalyst suggests the existence of framework Co2+ species is beneficial to absorb more C3H8 molecules.

Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that the Co species of Co-S-1-Ar are mainly distributed in the form of tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ in Silicalite-1 framework, which could effectively adsorb C3H8 and are superior stable during current catalytic conditions. While the Co species of Co/S-1-Air mainly exist in the form of Co3O4 species, which are extremely unstable and easily reduced. According to the above investigation, it is revealed that the Co2+ species is the active sites of PDH, and different calcination atmospheres could alter the presence of Co species, further resulting in different PDH catalytic performance.
3.4. The characterization of spent catalysts
According to previous PDH catalytic result in Fig. 4, the propylene selectivity of Co-S-1-Ar and Co/S-1-Air calcined in different atmospheres is different, in addition to the by-products such as CH4, C2H4 and C2H6, and another by-product coke cannot be ignored [36, 37]. The amount of coke in the catalyst after 600 min time-on-stream is measured by TG, as shown in Fig. 9A. Assuming that the catalyst weight loss from 100 °C to 800 °C is coke, it could be found that the coke content over Co/S-1-Air-used is 4.05%, which is higher than that of Co-S-1-Ar-used (2.83%). In addition, Raman spectroscopy is also used to characterize the corresponding coke, as shown in Fig. 9B. It is obviously that Co/S-1-Air-used shows a higher peak intensity at about 1600 cm−1 [38], corresponding to coke deposition, in comparison with that of Co-S-1-Ar-used, which indicates that more coke is generated over Co/S-1-Air-used, in accordance with previous TG result. It is reasonable to infer that the presence of a small amount of unstable Co sites in Co-S-1-Ar results in a few coke deposition and slight decreased conversion of C3H8 during time on stream according to H2-TPR characterization in Fig. 5, but as for the Co/S-1-Air catalyst, the easier reduction of Co3O4 species to metallic Co would facilitate to generate more coke. Moreover, Fig. S6 A and F show the TEM images of the Co/S-1-Air-used and Co-S-1-Ar-used catalysts, and Fig. S6 B-E, G-J show the elemental mapping of the Co/S-1-Air-used and Co-S-1-Ar-used catalysts. No obvious coke is observed in Co-S-1-Ar-used, and after the reaction, the Co species still maintained good dispersed. However, a mass of coke could be observed in Co/S-1-Air-used and some Co species are migrated to the catalyst surface, indicating the unstable Co species in Co/S-1-Air, which could be ascribed to the reduction of Co3O4 species to the unstable Co2+ or metallic Co species, resulting in further weak interaction between Co species and zeolite support.

3.5. The influence of Co content
In order to further optimize the catalytic performance over Co-S-1-Ar, different Co content including 0.6wt%, 1.6wt% and 2.4wt% are investigated, and the corresponding PDH catalytic results is shown in Fig. 10. With the incremental Co content from 0.6Co-S-1-Ar to 1.6Co-S-1-Ar and 2.4Co-S-1-Ar, the corresponding initial C3H8 conversion increases from 9.3% to 27.7% and 36.0%, respectively, while the deactivation rate of 2.4Co-S-1-Ar is the highest (0.0927 h−1) with the decreased conversion from 36.0% to 18.2% in 600 min time on stream. Meanwhile, it is noted that the propylene selectivity over 0.6Co-S-1-Ar and 1.6Co-S-1-Ar is higher than 95%, while the propylene selectivity over 2.4Co-S-1-Ar is lower than 83%.

In order to investigate the essential root of different catalytic performance over Co-S-1-Ar with different Co content. H2-TPR and UV-Vis characterization results are shown in Fig. 11. From the characterization result of H2-TPR in Fig. 11 A, no obvious H2 reduction peak is observed over 0.6Co-S-1-Ar and 1.6Co-S-1-Ar catalysts, indicating the superior stable Co species correspondingly. As for the 2.4Co-S-1-Ar catalyst, a reduction peak appears at 315 °C, which could be ascribed to the reduction of Co3O4 species. On the other hand, the UV-Vis characterization results are shown in Fig. 11B. It could be found that all these Ar-calcined catalysts present three obvious absorption bands at approximately 520, 592, and 649 nm, suggesting the existence of mainly tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ in the catalysts. However, it is noted that the 2.4Co-S-1-Ar exhibits a weak peak at approximately 750 nm, which is ascribed to the partial Co3O4 species. According to the followed in-situ IR characterization in Section 3.6, it is confirmed that Co species is incorporated into zeolite framework via replacing the silanol nests of Silicalite-1, while the silanol nests over Silicalite-1 is limited. Hence, the content of Co incorporated into Silicalite-1 is restricted, and partial Co species over 2.4Co-S-1-Ar catalyst exists with extra-framework Co3O4 species, which is easily to be reduced to metal Co species, further resulting in the rapidly decreased catalytic performance.

3.6. In-situ investigation into the synthesis of Co2+ in Co-S-1-Ar
To reveal the generation process of Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar under Ar calcination atmosphere, in-situ FT-IR and TG characterizations are adopted correspondingly. Firstly, TG is used to determine the decomposition temperature of Co supported Silicalite-1 precursor after solid-phase grinding, as shown in Fig. S7. It could be found that the catalyst mass keeps almost unchanged when the temperature is higher than 250 °C, indicating that the Co precursor has decomposed completely. Correspondingly, 300 °C is adopted to investigate the generation of Co2+ process over Co supported Silicalite-1 precursor under the Ar calcination atmosphere via in-situ FT-IR characterization, and all the IR spectra have subtracted the background spectrum, as shown in Fig. 12A. With the extension of IR spectra collected time, a broad peak at about 3500 cm−1 assigned to the silanol nests decreases gradually, and it becomes stable after 180 min [5, 39]. In addition, the further IR spectra in the hydroxyl stretching in Fig. 12B shows that the intensity of absorption band at 3500 cm−1 corresponding to silanol nests decreases with Co-S-1-Ar << Co/S-1-Air < Silicalite-1, which could be inferred that the silanol nests of Silicalite-1 is condensed more during Ar calcination. Recently, Jeno et al. reported the effects of the heat-treatment atmosphere on Co species in Co/Al2O3 catalyst, and it is concluded that Co species over both the Co/Al2O3-O2 and Co/Al2O3-Ar catalysts via O2 and Ar atmosphere calcination possess are mainly Co3O4 species, which is different from current investigation that Co precursor over Silicalite-1 zeolite heat-treated with Ar and Air atmosphere results in different Co species, demonstrating that the Ar calcination atmosphere is not a key factor in the transformation of Co precursors into Co2+ species in Al2O3 support [22]. The difference between literature report and current investigation is the abundance silanol nests in Silicalite-1 zeolite based on the IR characterization. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the Ar calcination atmosphere drives the Co precursors to be highly disperse over Silicalite-1, and then the Co species are further anchored by the silanol nests, and finally leading to the formation of the tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ species in the Silicalite-1 framework over Co-S-1-Ar. Nevertheless, in the presence of heat treatment of air, Co precursors would be oxidized to Co3O4 species and aggregate correspondingly [40, 41], which results in the difficulty in anchoring Co species by silanol nests over Co/S-1-Air.

In order to further clarify the effect of calcination atmosphere on the generation of Co species. Different Co supported Silicalite-1 precursor pretreatment environments including vacuum and hydrogen calcination atmosphere are used to synthesize Co-Silicalite-1 catalysts. From the UV-Vis characterization results in Fig. S8, it could be found that three absorption peaks at approximately 520, 592, and 649 nm are observed over Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum catalysts, respectively, in accordance with Co-S-1-Ar catalyst, suggesting the existence of the tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ species in Silicalite-1 zeolite framework, which is different from that of Co/S-1-Air mainly with Co3O4 species. The further PDH catalytic results over Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum are shown in Fig. S9, it could be found that both these two catalysts show high propylene yields similar to Co-S-1-Ar, which is obviously higher than that of Co/S-1-Air. Above investigation indicates the oxygen-free calcination atmosphere would facilitate the transformation of Co species into the Co2+ species over Silicalite-1, while the oxygen included calcination atmosphere results in the generate of Co3O4 species.
4. Conclusions
In summary, series of Co supported Silicalite-1 catalysts were prepared with different calcination atmosphere including oxidative atmosphere (air) or oxygen-free atmosphere (Ar, 5%H2/Ar and vacuum). The oxygen-free calcined catalysts Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum show excellent catalytic performance for PDH, which is nine times that of Co/S-1-Air prepared by air calcination atmosphere in terms of TOFCo. According to the systematic characterizations, it is found that mainly tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ species in Silicalite-1 framework over Co-S-1-Ar, Co-S-1-H2 and Co-S-1-Vacuum, which shows high Lewis acid sites and propane adsorption properties, exhibiting superior catalytic activity for PDH. While extra-framework Co3O4 species exist over Co/S-1-Air, which is extremely unstable and easily reduced, resulting in the low propane conversion and propylene selectivity. The further in-situ FT-IR reveals the formation mechanism of Co2+ species over Co-S-1-Ar, in which the Co precursors are driven by Ar to reach the silanol nests highly dispersed under high temperature, and Co species are further anchored by silanol nests and incorporated into Silicalite-1 framework with Co2+ species, and the other oxygen-free calcination atmosphere, such as H2 and vacuum, are also intensified. This work provides a facial strategy to prepare catalysts with different metal chemical valence state.
