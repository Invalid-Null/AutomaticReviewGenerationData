Propane dehydrogenation over a Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst: transient kinetic modeling of propene and coke formation
Abstract
The kinetics of propane dehydrogenation to produce propene over a Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst has been investigated over the temperature range of 525–575 °C at atmospheric pressure. The reaction rate of coke formation and its influence over catalyst deactivation has been studied. A Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism provides the best fit for the reaction, while a monolayer–multilayer mechanism is proposed to model the coke growth. Furthermore, this model was able to predict coke formation under conditions far from those employed in the experiments used to obtain the kinetics.
1. Introduction
Forecasts for basic alkenes [1] indicate that the growth rate of propene demand will surpass that of ethene until the year 2005, in spite of the fact that ethene consumption is anticipated to double by 2015. Consequently, naphtha cracker operators are seeking options that enable process flexibility and raise propene/ethene production ratios without affecting ethene output. Therefore, it is essential to study now processes involving the production of light alkenes from alkanes.
Until the last 20 years [2], the most important ways to obtain propene were the steam cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks and refinery conversion processes (e.g. fluid catalytic cracking, visbreaking and coking). The increasing demand for propene derivatives throughout the 1980s, especially for polypropylene, outstripped the availability from these established sources, and processes for the “on-purpose” production of propene by the dehydrogenation of propane from natural LPG fields have been developed commercially. Moreover, there are other paths to obtain the alkene like oxidative dehydrogenation [3], [4], [5], [6] or metathesis [7].
Propane dehydrogenation (1) is an equilibrium limited and highly endothermic reaction that is generally carried out at 530–630 °C and atmospheric pressure using platinum [8] or chromium [9] catalysts.
(1)
The main problems associated with dehydrogenation of alkanes are the formation of coke (coking) and low chain hydrocarbons (cracking). Coking leads to catalyst deactivation and cracking decreases reaction selectivity.
Oxides obtained from co-precipitation are widely used in chemical industries as catalysts for the selective oxidation of hydrocarbons and aromatics, dehydrogenations and isomerations due to their acid and dehydrogenating sites. Cr2O3/Al2O3 as a dehydrogenating catalyst has been known since the pioneering work of Frey and Huppke [10], [11]. Subsequently, numerous papers have been published in the literature on CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3 and CrOx/ZrO2 catalysts. It is supposed that active sites for dehydrogenation are Cr3+, although Cr2+ also has an influence [12]. Moreover, adding an alkaline metal to the catalyst structure can benefit its selectivity, reducing the cracking reactions and the coke formation.
Although this reaction has been widely studied, the majority of these works are partial kinetics studies [8], [9], [13], [14] or based on the oxidation state or on the nature of chromium in the reaction [15], [16], [17]. Only Larsson et al. [18] have combined the kinetics of propane dehydrogenation using a simple power law model with deactivation produced by coke formation.
In this work, we present a mechanistic kinetic model for the dehydrogenation, the coke formation and its influence over catalyst deactivation using a Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, in order to perform this reaction in a two zone fluidized bed reactor [19]. To design and optimize the most suitable reactor, a kinetic model that describes accurately the behavior of the system under a variety of conditions is required.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst
In all the experiments performed, a commercial Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, supplied by Nikki Chemical, was used. Table 1 shows the most important specifications of this dehydrogenation catalyst.

Before the reaction, the catalyst was:
•
ground and sieved to a particle size of 160–250 μm;
•
calcined in air at 650 °C;
•
treated under seven reaction–regeneration cycles during 30 min each at 600 °C to obtain an aged and stable catalyst [20], [21].
2.2. Thermogravimetric system
Coke formation experiments were performed in a thermogravimetric system, under several different conditions. The thermogravimetric system used was a commercial set from C.I. Electronics Ltd., Model K2 vacuum head, designed for a maximum weight of 5 g. Reproducibility of 10 μg is guaranteed. Weight measurement was registered in a computer with a speed of 100 data/min. The reactor feed contained propane diluted in nitrogen. All the streams were mass flow controlled (Brooks). The range of operating conditions was as follows: temperature, 525–575 °C; catalyst mass, 20 mg; total feed flow rate, 100 cm3 (STP)/min.
2.3. Fixed bed reactor
The kinetic reaction study was carried out using an 8 mm internal diameter tubular quartz reactor inside an electrical furnace. The temperature was measured by a thermocouple inside a quartz thermowell, at the center of the catalyst bed, which contained 200 mg of Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst. A PID controller maintained temperature variations within ±0.5 °C of the set point. The reactor feed contained propane diluted in argon. All the streams were mass flow controlled (Brooks). The temperature was varied from 525 to 575 °C. The exit gases were analyzed by online gas chromatography (CE Instruments Model GC-8000TOP) equipped with two detectors (TCD and FID) and two columns (Chromosorb P AW 23% SP-1700 80/100 and molecular sieve 10 Å 80/100).
2.4. Fluidized bed reactor
Experiments using a fluidized bed reactor were performed to check the ability of the proposed model to predict coke formation. A 2.5 cm internal diameter tubular quartz reactor, with a porous quartz plate as gas distributor, was used. The temperature was measured by a thermocouple inside a quartz thermowell, at the center of the catalyst bed, which contained 25 g of catalyst. The reactor feed contained propane diluted in argon. All the streams were mass flow controlled (Brooks). The exit gases were analyzed by online gas spectrometry (Balzer, Model Omnistar 200) equipped with an ionic detector (Faraday Cup) and a secondary electron multiplier (SEM). The operating temperature was between 575 and 600 °C, and the total feed flow rate was 375 ml (STP)/min.
2.5. Fitting
Once the kinetics have been calculated, the suitability of the models to represent the kinetic data can be assessed. To choose the best kinetic model between those proposed, the model selection criteria (MSC) [22] has been used for each of the next described models. The MSC is computed as:
(2)
where j is the number of experimental points, p the number of parameters and
the weighted mean of the experimental observations.
The MSC is useful because it takes into account the number of parameters of a given model and, therefore, allows a comparison of different models.
Fittings were performed with commercial software Scientist® that employs the Levenberg–Mardquardt algorithm. The plug flow reactor was approached by a finite difference approach.
3. Experimental results
3.1. Dehydrogenation of propane
Several sets of experiments have been performed in the fixed bed reactor, varying the feed composition and temperature.
Fig. 1 shows the outlet molar flow of all species involved in the reaction. The main products are propene and hydrogen, but ethene and methane appear also as cracking products. Propane conversion and selectivity to propene (Fig. 2) decreases with time due to deactivation by coke deposition that apparently only affects the dehydrogenation reaction, but not the cracking.

Fig. 2. Conversion of propane and selectivity to propene as a function of time for different temperatures. W/F=14 g h/mol; QT=150 cm3 (STP)/min; propane/argon ratio=0.5.
The effect of temperature upon propane conversion and selectivity is very marked. Conversion increases quickly with temperature, dehydrogenation and cracking are both very endothermic reactions and, as a result, a small rise in temperature produces a large increase in conversion. The effect of temperature on catalyst deactivation is also very striking; activity decreases initially faster at high temperatures. Selectivity to propene (Fig. 2) decreases with temperature probably because its effect is greater over cracking than over the dehydrogenation reaction.
Fig. 3 shows the effect of the feed composition for a given spatial time. The propane conversion decreases slightly when propane concentration increases, which could suggest an order of propane reaction slightly lower than 1. The selectivity to propene also decreases slightly with propane concentration.

3.2. Coke formation
Thermogravimetric experiments have been carried out, varying the feed composition and temperature.
Fig. 4 shows the variation with time of coke formation at different temperatures. The trend of coke content with time has two zones, more or less differentiated depending on the temperature. At 525 and 550 °C, in the first initial zone, the rate of coke formation decreases with time and is higher than in the second one, where the rate of formation remains nearly constant. At 575 °C, the first zone almost disappears. These results suggest that in the initial zone coke formation deactivates itself when the catalyst surface becomes coked, after this a residual coking activity remains constant in the second zone. Similar trends have been pointed out by Peña et al. [20], [21] for butane dehydrogenation on Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst and by van Sint et al. [8] for propane dehydrogenation on Pt/α-Al2O3 catalyst.

A very strong influence of the reaction temperature on coke formation can also be observed in Fig. 4. In the second zone, the coke formation rate increases markedly with temperature. At the final time shown in Fig. 4, five times more coke is formed at the highest temperature studied (575 °C) than at the lowest (525 °C).
In Fig. 5, the influence of the propane concentration in propane–argon mixtures is shown. There are no appreciable effects in the conditions studied. The apparent reaction order of the coking process with respect to the propane concentration is very low. This effect has also been observed by van Sint et al. [8]. This is a counter-intuitive result, not easy to explain. It may be hypothesized that due to the strong propene adsorption (as will be shown later) the surface coverage is close to unity in all the experimental conditions, and thus the coke formation by ethane polymerization results independent of the propane concentration in the gas phase.

4. Kinetic modeling
The kinetic modeling has been developed following several steps. In the first step, the data obtained in the fixed bed reactor were fitted to a power law model and different mechanistic models assuming a simple deactivation model. In the second step, thermogravimetric experiments were fitted to different coke formation models. Statistical parameters of the fitting were used to discriminate between the proposed models in both the steps. Finally, in the third step, the best kinetic models obtained previously were used to calculate the effect of coke formation over deactivation and the kinetic parameters.
4.1. Dehydrogenation of propane
Different models have been tested in order to obtain the best fit for the dehydrogenation kinetics: a power law model and Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanisms. In all cases, the cracking reaction has been fitted to a power law rate expression with first order relative to propane.
In this work, several rate equations have been tested, as shown in Table 2. The first corresponds to a power-law equation. The others are derived from Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanisms. The first, LHWW-1, supposes that adsorption equilibrium constants for propane and propene have the same order. The second, LHHW-2, assumes that propane adsorption is negligible. After combining reaction and adsorption equilibrium and performing the active sites balance, the equations shown in Table 2 for each mechanism are obtained.

LHHW 1
LHHW 2
To choose between the reaction kinetics proposed, it was decided, as a first approach, to fit all kinetic data using a simple and empirical deactivation model. This avoids potential errors resulting from extrapolating data to initial time to obtain initial rates. The model combines exponential activity–time obtained by Dumez and Froment [23] (a=exp(−αCc)) and the coke–time relationship proposed by Voorhies [24] (Cc=Atn). Thus, the activity–time relationship is given by:
(3)
where α is given by α=α0e−Ea(1/T−1/T0) and n a fixed value which does not depend on temperature. The use of this activity–time relationship allows us to employ all the conversion–selectivity data and not only those from the extrapolation to 0 time.
As may be seen in Table 3, the best fitting obtained (best MSC value) was for the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism (LHHW-2) that accounts for inhibition by propene due to adsorption. This is the chosen model and agrees with the equation proposed by Wan and Chu [25] for a ZnO/silicalite catalyst. Mechanistic model is better than the potential model. In agreement with the chosen model, the equilibrium constant value obtained for propene adsorption is very high. Furthermore, the activation energy of thermal cracking is greater than for the propane dehydrogenation (Table 5), in agreement with what is expected for a gas phase phenomenon versus a catalytic process. A small standard deviation of kinetic parameters is obtained due to the large quantity of experimental data, which contributes to more precise results from a statistical point of view.

In all the temperature range, propane conversion and selectivity to propene was well predicted with the model.
4.2. Coke formation kinetics
The models used in this work to describe coke formation were previously developed by Peña et al. [20], [21], Romero et al. [26], Rodrı́guez et al. [27] and van Sint et al. [8]. This model, called the monolayer–multilayer coke growth model (MMCGM) was first formulated by Nam and Kittrell [28] and generalized by Corella and Monzón [29]. In the generalized model, coke content in the catalyst versus time can be described taking into account a simultaneous formation of coke over the surface of the catalyst and a multilayer coke deposition. Therefore, the total coke formation velocity must be described as the addition of monolayer and multilayer coke growth.

, with T0 being the reference temperature, h the kinetic order for monolayer coke formation, and n and m the kinetic orders for coke formation in multilayer.
The same values tested by Monzón et al. [30] for the kinetic orders (h, n and m) in previous kinetic studies on coke formation have been used. Table 4 shows the integrated equations for those values. Model 1, which shows the best MSC value (Table 3), has been chosen for the third step of the fitting.

h = 1
n = 1
m = 0

Model 2
h = 2
n = 0
m = 0

Model 3
h = 2
n = 1
m = 2
The fitting results show that the activation energy for the monolayer formation is smaller than that for multilayer, which agrees with the fact that monolayer growth over the catalyst surface is catalyzed. In agreement with the postulated model, most of the monolayer coke is deposited in the first reaction instants (Fig. 4). Simultaneously, multilayer coke is deposited over the existing coke, the rate depending on the monolayer coke concentration. The physical meaning of the model is also coherent with the experimental observations: it forecasts a constant growth of coke from the moment when all the monolayer coke has been deposited. It should be noted that experiments at different temperatures can be fitted with the same value of Cmax, which means that final covering of the catalyst surface with monolayer coke is the same for each temperature. This model does not consider the effect of the reaction atmosphere in the coke formation. As will be shown later, the prediction of the model are satisfactory, in spite of this simplification. It may be expected that the model prediction will fail if a large amount of hydrogen is feed to the reactor, as is usually done in several industrial processes. Under such operating conditions the coke formation will be decreased. Therefore, the above equation are only useful when no hydrogen is fed with the propane.
4.3. Deactivation model
After having chosen the best kinetic mechanism, the next objective was to find the relationship between the coke content in the catalyst and the propane dehydrogenation activity. According to the mechanistic model, only monolayer coke would promote deactivation. This involves that after all the monolayer coke was formed, the catalyst had a remaining activity. However, experimental activity–time results prove that activity decreases with time, even after the monolayer has been formed. This suggests that multilayer coke also deactivates. The existence of catalytic activity even after all the surface has been covered by coke can be explained by some catalytic activity of the coke itself, as has been found by several authors [31].
Two deactivation equations have been tested, a potential equation and an exponential equation.

All the experiments can be fitted with the same values for α1 and α2 which means that the effect of coke over deactivation is independent of temperature; multilayer coke also causes deactivation but of a smaller order than monolayer coke (α1>α2). In Fig. 1, Fig. 4, the model predictions have been plotted (product molar flow and coke content in catalyst, respectively, as a function of time) and the good agreement with the experimental data can be verified.
5. Model checking
The model resulting from the fit of the data obtained under different conditions should have predictive capabilities. Three experiments were designed with the following aims:
•
To check the model applicability at a different temperature and in a different reaction system to those employed in obtaining the kinetic data.
•
To check if the model predicts how much activity is recovered after a partial catalyst regeneration.
•
A third experiment was done, to obtain additional proofs of the strong propene adsorption.
All the experiments were carried out in the fluidized bed reactor in order to have an isothermal system.
In the first experiment, propane dehydrogenation was performed at 600, 25 °C higher than the maximum temperature employed to obtain the kinetic model. After reaction during 30 min, the coke was oxidized with O2 while the exit gases were analyzed (Fig. 7) with a mass spectrometer until no COx were detected. The total coke formed from this experiment was 0.029 g coke/g catalyst, while the model prediction was 0.0306 g coke/g catalyst. Thus, the prediction error was approximately 5%. This confirms the reliability of the model to predict the coke content, even in a different reaction system from that employed to obtain the kinetic data.

In the second experiment, propane dehydrogenation was carried out at 575 °C during 60 min. Coke content in the catalyst was calculated using the kinetic model. Then, the catalyst was partially regenerated, using an amount of O2 smaller than the stoichiometric to consume all the coke. The reaction time corresponding to this remaining amount of coke was calculated and the reaction was performed again with this partially regenerated catalyst. The conversion and yield to propene as a function of time coincide in both the experiments (Fig. 8), taking into account the time displacement calculated previously.

The third experiment aimed to experimentally check the propene adsorption. To this end, the reaction was performed in a fluidized bed reactor (T=550 °C, total flow=350 cm3 (STP)/min), and the gas feed was suddenly changed to pure argon. The concentration of propane and propene at the reactor exit was followed by mass spectrometry. Fig. 9 shows the normalized concentration values (mass spectrometer signal divided by the signal in the reaction conditions) of both the compounds. It may be seen that, whereas, propane is quickly removed from the reactor, the signal corresponding to propene decreases much more slowly, which suggests that propene is being strongly adsorbed on the catalyst. This result provides an independent check of the reaction mechanism deduced from the kinetic analysis.

6. Conclusions
A kinetic model for the process of propane dehydrogenation over a Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst has been developed. Extensive experimental work has been performed to obtain the kinetic parameters involved in the reaction, in the coke formation and in the activity–coke content relationship. A Langmuir–Hinshelwood model with strong adsorption of propene has been chosen as it provides the best fit to describe the reaction kinetics. A monolayer–multilayer coke growth model has been proposed to describe coke content in the catalyst as a function of time. The relation between coke content in the catalyst and catalyst activity has also been studied and determined with the activity being related with both monolayer and multilayer coke. This complete model explains well the qualitative and quantitative observations presented in this work. Also, employing the kinetic parameters obtained gives a satisfactory prediction of coke formation and catalyst regeneration in additional experiments. Independent experiments confirm the strong propene adsorption predicted by the kinetic model.
