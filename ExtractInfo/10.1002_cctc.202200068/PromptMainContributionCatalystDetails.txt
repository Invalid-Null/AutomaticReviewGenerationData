Oxygen-Functionalized Boron Nitride for the Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane – The Case for Supported Liquid Phase Catalysis
Graphical Abstract
Oxygen functionalization: In this study two oxygen functionalization strategies of boron nitride are discussed. The functionalized materials were applied as catalyst for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Via different analysis methods the transformation process of the catalysts was investigated and a diboron trioxide melt was detected as active species.
Abstract
Boron and boron containing materials have created a new class of catalysts for the highly selective conversion of light alkanes to building block olefins. Boron oxide species seem to play an essential role for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. For boron nitride they are created through an induction process under reaction conditions. It is still not obvious how different kinds of oxidative pre-activation influences the observed activity and selectivity. Here we compare two different oxygen activation strategies of boron nitride, a classical activation by calcination at different temperatures and ball-milling with varying rotation velocity. These treatments allow to control the amount of introduced boron oxide species from 0.2 to 17.5 wt.-%, as quantified by alkalimetric titration. The catalytic experimental data together with the pre, post as well as in situ characterization, give insights how the catalyst's surface changes under reaction conditions. On this backdrop it can be deduced that molten boron oxide predominantly acts as catalyst under reaction conditions, and boron nitride as catalyst support.
Introduction
Beside ethylene, propylene is the second most important organic chemical intermediate. In 2017, 110 million tons of propylene were produced mainly by steam cracking and direct dehydrogenation of propane.1 The production of C2 to C3 olefins is one of the most energy intensive sectors of the chemical industry.2, 3 Many important industrial compounds, like polypropylene, propylene oxide, isopropanol, acetone, are produced by chemical transformations starting with propylene.4 In the near future, a rise in demand of propylene up to 20 % is predicted.5 In the short term, the shifting raw material base from crude oil to natural shale gas sources and steam cracking will result in new product ratios with an ethylene yield favored at the expense of propylene.6, 7 In consequence the gap between propylene supply and demand will increase, and on purpose processes gain more and more interest.8 In the long term and within a circular economy new routes towards olefins are needed and the dehydrogenation of alkanes is a promising option. With low energy consumption and process robustness in mind, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) seems to be a promising alternative, as the exothermic reaction exhibits no thermodynamic limitations while coking is supressed.9 However, total oxidation to CO2 as well as CO is the most challenging part for this reaction system.10
In 2016, Grant et al. discovered that boron nitride exhibits a high olefin selectivity up to 91 % at a propane conversion about 14 %.11 This work initiated a renaissance for boron containing catalysts in the oxidative dehydrogenation of C2 to C4 alkanes.12-14 Beside boron nitride also metal borides, boron carbide, silicon boride and elemental boron are catalytically active for the ODHP.15, 16 Furthermore, the main side products are not CO2 or CO, but ethylene, which plays an important role as high demand chemical, too.17
Until now, the active sites of boron-based catalyst systems are still unclear. From a macroscopic point of view the consumption rate of propane follows a second order kinetic whereas the oxygen dependency may be described by an Eley-Rideal kinetic, assuming that only oxygen adsorbs on the catalyst's surface.11, 18 This is in contrast to the Mars van Krevelen mechanism for reducible transition metal oxide catalyst systems. Here, lattice oxygen activates the alkane via a C−H-cleavage. The hydroxide species formed on the metal surface recombine with a neighboring hydroxyl group to form water.8 This water molecule desorbs from the catalyst surface, reducing the metal center. A fast reoxidation of the surface by oxygen follows (zero order to oxygen and first order dependence to propane).19 Love et al. investigated the surface transformation of boron nitride via 11B solid state NMR. They found out that dynamic boron hydroxide oxide B(OH)xO3−x (0 <x <3) surface species were formed during the ODHP.20 The surface species or transformation processes of boron as well as boron oxide supported on silica were investigated, either. In comparison to boron nitride a different surface composition change was observed.21 Primarily meta-type borate chains were detected and a loss of boron species after the ODHP took place, indicating a formation process of volatile boron esters.22 Depending on the reaction conditions and the catalyst or supporting material different borate structures like isolated BO3- and BO2(OH)-groups or boroxol ring structures are generated.23
In contrast to what is known about amorphous boron or boron oxides, different works reported that an activation process or induction period is necessary for boron nitride, suggesting that the active phase is built during this period.24 Zhou et al. investigated the activation by different gas phases before the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE).25 Hydrogen, oxygen, water and an ethane-oxygen mixture were used for activation, but only applying a mixture of alkane and oxygen resulted in an active catalyst.25 Beside a gas phase activation, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) was modified implementing oxygen groups by a sodium assisted hydroxylation route.26 The catalyst's activity for the ODHE as well as ODHP was increased by hydroxylated hBN from 5 to 20 % conversion.27, 28 Also, ball-milled BN was used to catalyze the ODH of ethane to ethylene.29 All these studies show a successful oxidation of boron nitride and subsequently an enhanced catalytic activity, which strongly indicates that BOx-groups play the essential role during the ODH. Theoretical simulations also support the assumption that an oxygen activation is the key step for the catalytic activity.30, 31 In conclusion, the surface is highly dynamic during the oxidative dehydrogenation, and building the active species strongly depends on the catalyst precursor, its pre-treatment and the reaction conditions.32
To study the influence of the pre-treatment, in this work two very different strategies for oxygen functionalization of boron nitride were employed. i) The activation by calcination at varying temperature and ii) a ball-mill treatment at varying rotation velocity. The materials after the activation were tested for activity and selectivity in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Pristine and spent catalysts were characterized by XRD, DRIFTS, DSC, ICP-OES, and physisorption to evaluate the influence of the pretreatment on the resulting surface oxygen functionalization. In situ XRD was carried out to observe the dynamic change of the catalyst's crystallinity. Furthermore, an alkalimetric titration was employed for this kind of catalysts, to determine the degree of oxygen-coordinated boron atoms. Interestingly, comparison of the two different activation procedures allowed to shade light on the open question whether boron nitride can be seen as a catalyst functionalized with surface groups or ‘just’ as a supporting material for a catalytically active liquid boron oxide. The latter seems to be the case, and the pre-activation has a strong influence on the build-up of the liquid boron oxide layer.
Results and Discussion
Oxygen functionalization after pretreatment
Pristine hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) was activated via ball-milling and calcination in air. Figure 1a–d illustrate XRD patterns and DRIFTS analyses of the ball-milled (Figure 1a,b) and thermally activated (Figure 1c,d) samples. The XRD patterns up to 860 °C could be assigned to that of hBN, whereas calcination above 900 °C led to oxidation and formation of boron- and oxygen-containing compounds. The (310)-reflection at 27.8°/2θ and the (420)-reflection at 39.9°/2θ correspond to reflections typical for boric acid and diboron trioxide, but the diffraction reflections at 26.9°/2θ and 41.6°/2θ indicate remaining hBN (Figure 1b). No reflections that belong to either boron oxide or boron hydroxide were observed for ball-milled boron nitride (Figure 1a). The DRIFT spectra (Figure 1c) present two vibrations that appeared after the ball-milling activation: A B−O-stretching mode at 1190 cm−1 and a B−O-deformation mode at 885 cm−1. They might be due to the presence of tetrahedral entities, like [BO4]−anions in polyborates. This indicates not only an oxygen functionalization on boron nitride edges but also a rearrangement of B−O-surface groups to form a network of borates via hydrogen and oxygen bonds.33 The same vibrations were visible for calcined hBN (Figure 1d). The surface area increased slightly from 16 m2 g−1 (pristine hBN) to 27 m2 g−1 (BN_450 rpm) which could be explained by a broader particle size distribution caused by ball-milling (Table S2). In comparison to oxygen activation via calcination, the surface area was smaller due to sintering and agglomeration effects (Table S2). It decreased from 16 m2 g−1 (pristine hBN) to 3 m2 g−1 (BN_940 °C).

While XRD and DRIFTS characterization indicate an oxygen functionalization in a qualitative way, a quantification of the oxygen-coordinated boron degree is missing. Therefore, in this study the alkalimetric titration (Scheme 1) was tested to determine the degree of oxygen- coordinated boron species (BO-coor.). The method is based on a complex reaction between polyvalent alcohols with two hydroxyl groups in cis-position and B-OH-groups (Scheme 1).34

Figure 2a and b represent exemplary titration curves as well as the mass fraction of oxygen coordinated boron species. Pure hexagonal boron nitride contains primary and secondary amino groups and some hydroxy groups. For pristine boron nitride suspended in deionized water, a pH-value of 8.4 was reached, indicating that the amino groups are responsible for the basic surface property.35 The alkalimetric titration with mannite formed borate anions and protons that led to a pH-value of 3.5 to 4 as starting point for the titration. A sharp equivalent point at a pH-value between 7 and 9 was reached. Employing this titration method showed for the ball-mill oxidation a number of boron oxide species that related to the rotation velocity (Figure 2a). This is in accordance with findings from Namba et al. employing XPS.36 In total, a content of oxygen-coordinated boron of 0.2 to 0.8 wt.-% resulted after ball-milling. For the calcination activation, a trend was seen, too: With higher temperatures the fraction of boron oxide increased from 0.5 to 17.5 wt.-% (Figure 2b), which also corresponds to literature values.37

Catalytic testing
The activated samples were employed as catalysts for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Figures 3a–d represent the conversion rates and selectivities of the modified catalysts in comparison to pristine boron nitride. At the chosen reaction conditions, pristine boron nitride showed a conversion of approximately 5 % and a propylene selectivity of 40 % (Figure 3a and b). Even in the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane pristine BN led to a poor selectivity for ethylene.29 However, in comparison to the literature the propylene yield was quite low.11, 16 Interestingly, the oxygen-activated boron nitride catalysts showed a higher conversion, up to 40 %. Both activation strategies resulted in a higher olefin selectivity with propylene as main product. Furthermore, even at a low WHSV (1.4 gC3H8 gcat−1 h−1) total oxidation seemed to be suppressed. The propylene selectivity reached, regardless which activation strategy was used, approximately 80 %. The main side product was ethylene with selectivity ranging from 10 to 15 %. For ball-mill activated catalysts, a high reaction rate at the beginning was observed, before a strong deactivation started. A possible explanation is the functionalization by oxygen at hBN edges, which could be responsible for the high activity. Due to the missing regeneration of these active sites a deactivation occurred. Chaturbedy et al. documented this deactivation process, too.38 After 15 h time on stream (TOS) the conversion became 10 to 20 % for all of the ball-milled samples. Nevertheless, the selectivity to form propylene did not change with respect to the reaction time.

In contrast to boron nitride activated by ball-milling the calcined samples showed a nearly steady-state catalyst activity. The catalyst conversion increased in dependence to a higher calcination temperature, apparently due to the higher amount of boron oxide species (Figure 2b). Furthermore, the total oxidation reactions yielding CO or CO2 were more suppressed after calcination activation.
Characterization of spent catalysts
To clarify which circumstances are responsible for the strong influence of the pre-treatment on the resulting surface oxygen functionalization of the catalyst and thus the reaction rate and deactivation behavior, XRD, DRIFTS, physisorption and alkalimetric titration measurements were carried out for the spent catalysts. Figures 4a and b represent the XRD-patterns of the spent catalysts. In contrast to the pristine ball-mill activated boron nitride the (310)-reflection of boron oxide was visible after the reaction. This indicates a further oxidation of the catalyst during the ODHP as well as a change in the type of oxygen functionalization: Primarily, surface oxygen groups were generated during the ball-milling process. After the ODHP, also crystalline boron oxide domains could be detected. Generating a crystalline boron oxide structure during the ODHP depends strongly on the reaction setup and on the pretreatment. Tian et al. did not identify any crystalline boron oxide species, whereas other groups also observed XRD patterns with reflections they assigned to boron oxide species.29, 39 The DRIFT analyses also indicated transformations of the B−OH stretching mode at 3200 cm−1 (Figure 4c) and of the B−O-stretching vibration at 1190 cm−1 for ball-mill activated boron nitride.10 Furthermore, the band at approx. 1600 cm−1 increased, which may be assigned to the H−O−H bending mode of adsorbed water.40, 41 It seems that adsorbed water caused by sample storage in air desorbed during the reaction, while no further water was adsorbed at reaction temperatures. For ball-mill activated hBN the B−OH-stretching vibration and H−O−H bending vibration increased in intensity during reaction, but this was not the case for materials activated through calcination (Figure 4d). A decrease of the B-OH stretching vibration occurred during the heating procedure because boric acid were dehydrated (Figure 4d). The B−O-stretching vibration increased. This indicates that additional boron oxide was generated. Pristine boron nitride neither showed the formation of crystalline boron oxide nor that of surface boron oxide groups. A small decrease of the surface area after the reaction was detectable. Agglomeration effects may be responsible for this (Table S2).

Titration of all spent catalysts was used to examine the quantitative changes in oxygen functionalization. While for pristine boron nitride, no oxidation during the reaction was observed, both pre-treated materials showed an increase in oxygen content during the catalysis (Figure 5a and b). For calcined samples, a constant increase of approx. 3 to 5 percentage points was observed. For the ball-milled samples, the prior correlation of the amount of oxygen-coordinated boron atoms and the rotation velocity was no longer observed after catalysis.

Correlation of initial and steady state catalytic activity to characterization results
The characterization of the pristine catalysts showed that the two different activation procedures allow to vary the starting amount of boron oxide species in a broad range. Furthermore, the calcination procedure led to crystalline boron oxide species whereas the ball-milling treatment caused predominantly the formation of oxygen surface groups. These results further showed that the type of activation strongly influences catalytic activity as well as selectivity. Additionally, the time-dependent activity data suggest that a dynamic change of the surface chemistry and the morphology during ODHP takes place while the time scale of these changes differs significantly between both oxygen functionalization methods. All materials exhibited a higher degree of boron oxide species after the utilization as ODHP catalyst determined by titration. The XRD analyses indicated crystalline boron oxide species after the catalysis, even for ball-mill activated boron nitride, while pristine ball-milled BN lacked any sign of boron oxide in the XRD pattern. Difference-DRIFT spectra showed, that depending on the activation method during the reaction, the BO- as well as BOH-stretching vibrations increased (for ball-milled BN) or decreased (for calcined BN) depending on the applied activation procedure.
For further discussion, the propane consumption rate per catalyst area was determined at the start (first point) and at the end (last 2 h TOS) of catalytic tests. In this context, the rate per catalyst area at the start of the experiment could be correlated with the pristine materials, while the propane consumption rate at the end of the catalytic tests could be correlated with the characterization results of the spent catalysts. In Figure 6a and b, the consumption rates per catalyst area of the first measuring point are plotted versus the amount of oxygen coordinated boron species per catalyst area on the pristine materials, while in Figure 7a and b the average rate of the last 2 h TOS is correlated with the amount of oxygen coordinated boron species per catalyst area of the spent catalysts. For the initial rates (Figure 6), a trend towards higher activities with higher initial boron oxide content resulted and the oxygen-coordinated boron species determined by titration seemed to correlate with the number of active sites. Figure 6b shows the same correlation for the calcined activated materials, whereas a linear dependency of the initial activity from the amount of boron oxide species was observed. Compared to boron nitride catalysts activated by ball-milling, the gradient was significantly lower. An explanation could be that the surface boron oxide groups per area are more active as the bulk boron oxide groups per area (Table S2).

The red line represents a guide for the eye. Pristine boron nitride (marked with a blue cross) was not included in the trend.
The steady state catalytic activity differed from the initial one. The ball-milling activation ended up in a catalyst deactivation which seems to depend on sintering effect of ball milled catalysts. A higher rotation velocity may lead to smaller particles which sinter at elevated temperatures. The decrease of the specific surface area of the spent ball milled catalyst underpins this theory (Table S2) Nevertheless there is still a trend visible if the number of oxidized boron species and the consumption rate is divided by the catalyst area (Figure 7a). Interestingly the spent catalyst BN_255 rpm has a BET area of 7 m2 g−1 but shows the highest catalytic activity. In comparison to ball mill-activated boron nitride, the calcined catalysts showed no catalytic deactivation over 15 h TOS (Figure 7b). Even though a further oxidation of boron nitride took place (Figure 5b), the propane consumption rate at the end of the experiment was nearly identical to the initial rate. In consequence, the linear correlation of propane consumption rate in the last 2 h TOS and the amount of boron oxide species determined by titration of the spent catalysts remained in place. Compared to the ball-mill-activated BN, a higher amount of boron oxide species seems to be necessary to consume an equal amount of propane, indicating that not all active sites are accessible towards propane activation.
Influence of the pre-activation procedure on the time scale of liquid boron oxide film formation
The correlation of the initial and steady state catalytic activity with the characterization results indicates that two different kinds of active sites exist and that the formation process of these sites strongly depends on the pre-activation. Boron oxide surface groups, primarily formed by ball-milling, are highly active towards oxidative propane dehydrogenation due to their ability of propane C−H-activation. In situ FT-IR spectroscopy indicated that B−O-centers are able to react as active sites for ODHP by hydrogen abstraction even at temperatures as low as 450 °C.12, 21, 42 However, B-OH groups formed at reaction conditions are not stable towards further dehydration and also inactive to ODHP.32 A theoretical DFT-simulation also postulated that the C−H-cleavage of propane is energetically easier as the regeneration of the B-OH-site.43 This is why a ball-milling activation process results in a catalyst deactivation. In contrast, pre-activation via calcination leads directly to a catalytic steady state. Bearing in mind the characterization results of the spent ball-milled catalysts (Figure 4a and c), a shift of the surface groups and a formation of crystalline boron oxide is highly probable. On a time scale of 15 h TOS it appears that surface boron oxide groups are transformed into crystalline boron oxide species. Because of the lower amount of crystalline boron oxide in the ball milled boron nitride sample, this transformation process would explain the high catalytic activity that was observed at the beginning as well as the catalyst deactivation, leading to the low activity during the last 2 h TOS. In contrast to this, a homogeneous catalytic active liquid layer of molten diboron trioxide would explain the achievement of a catalytic steady state for the calcined boron nitride catalysts. In order to confirm the hypothesis of a supported liquid phase catalysis (SLPC) in case of BN catalyzed ODHP, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and in situ XRD measurements were carried out.
For the DSC analyses, boric acid was utilized as reference material, showing three endothermic processes in a temperature range between 140 °C and 200 °C. The onset-temperatures of these processes are pictured in Figure 8. The first endothermic process at 141 °C could be assigned to the transformation of boric acid to metaborate, while the second signal indicated a transformation from metaboric acid to pyroboric acid.44 The third peak indicated the decomposition of pyroboric acid to diboron trioxide.45 The temperature of the last step ranges from 160 °C to 360 °C.46 Crystalline diboron trioxide exhibits a melting point of 450 °C whereas amorphous diboron trioxide starts softening around 325 °C while complete fluidization is reached at 450 °C.47 Since no sharp signal was detected by DSC measurements at 450 °C, it was concluded that the diboron trioxide formed during the DSC experiments was amorphous. Prior to the catalytic experiments, only the BN samples that were calcined contained boron oxide species (Figure 8a), whereas ball-milled as well as pristine BN showed no endothermic processes in the temperature region between 140 °C and 200 °C, indicating the absence of crystalline boron oxide species. Figure 8b) presents the DSC-results after the catalytic experiments. Again, no endothermic processes between 140 °C and 200 °C became visible for spent pristine BN showing that no boron oxide had been formed during the ODHP. However, two endothermic peaks are visible for the ball-milled BN (Figure 8b) which are not present for the pristine catalyst, therefore indicating that ball-mill activated BN was oxidized during ODHP, and boron oxide was formed.

DSC results of pristine BN, BN_225 rpm and BN_940 °C before (a)) and after (b)) catalytic experiments. To evaluate the endothermic processes, boric acid was analyzed as reference material.
This can be seen as evidence that oxygen activated boron nitride forms bulk boron oxide upon exposure to ODHP conditions.
In order to verify that amorphous diboron trioxide was present at reaction conditions an in situ XRD study of a calcined boron nitride catalyst was carried out. Figure 9a) presents the heating of the catalyst. The changes assigned to phase transitions of boron oxide are consistent with the DSC results (Figure 8a). At first boric acid is transformed to metaboric acid, which was detected by XRD at 150 °C (Figure 8a). Above this temperature, the reflections of metaboric acid disappear. In accordance with the results from the DSC experiments it can be assumed that the metaboric acid is first transformed to pyroboric acid and afterwards to diboron trioxide. Because of the amorphous state of diboron trioxide (as discussed in the context of the DSC measurements) no Bragg-reflections were observed. Figure 9b) shows the results for the in-situ XRD analysis. Interestingly, an increased background signal between 15°/2θ and 25°/2θ was observed (Figure 9b). To verify that this increasing background signal can be assigned to an amorphous diboron trioxide phase, the heating process under nitrogen was repeated with pure boric acid as a reference. At a temperature of 300 °C a similar increasing background signal was detected, too (Figure S2). After 6 h TOS, the gas flow was switched from propane and oxygen to nitrogen again to cool the reaction setup. During this cooling process, small reflections of metaboric acid were observed at 150 °C and reflections of boric acid appeared below 100 °C. This observation is another strong evidence, that amorphous diboron oxide must be present above 200 °C, which is hydrated to form crystalline metaboric acid and boric acid.

Using in situ XRD analysis, we concluded an amorphous diboron trioxide phase being present during the ODHP. Since the reaction temperature lies above the melting range of diboron trioxide, it appears reasonable to assume that this phase is present in form of a melt.
Based on the sum of characterization methods for two pre-activations routines two different pathways towards the finally forming liquid boron oxide phase can be concluded and are visualized in Scheme 2. Different oxygen functionalization, introduced by ball-milling and calcination can be seen as the starting point. Ball-mill activation (blue marked area, Scheme 2) leads primarily to oxygen surface groups (Figure 1a). At the beginning of the ODHP reaction these B−O groups are able to perform a hydrogen abstraction of propane, which explains the high initial catalytic activity of the ball-mill activated boron nitride (Figure 3a). However, under reaction conditions, B-OH groups are not stable towards further dehydration. With higher TOS, more B-OH-groups are split off, resulting in boron oxide structures and partial catalyst deactivation. At a reaction temperature of 530 °C, diboron trioxide is present as an amorphous liquid phase. The XRD pattern (Figure 4a) of the spent ball-mill activated samples points out, that after the catalytic testing crystalline boric acid is present. Because of the low amount of boron oxide species at the beginning of the catalytic experiments and after ODHP (Figure 5a), the amount of molten boron oxide at reaction conditions is rather low. In consequence, ball-mill activated hBN passes through two different catalytic states. Firstly, the catalytic origin is based on the surface B−O-groups generated by ball-milling, and secondly a supported liquid phase catalysis with liquid boron oxide is formed, which is in accordance with the literature that the presence of a single active site is improbable.49

Oxidation and transformation mechanism of boron nitride during the ODHP proposed a) for ball-milled, activated hBN and b) for calcined hBN. At pathway a) the boron oxide melt is generated during the ODHP, whereas the melt already exists at the beginning of the reaction at pathway b).
The green marked area in Scheme 2 symbolizes the transformation process of calcined boron nitride. In comparison to the ball mill activated boron nitride a calcination above 900 °C induces the formation of crystalline boron oxide species (Figure 1b). First, B-OH groups are dehydrated during heating process (Figure 4d), (indicated by the decrease of B-OH-stretching vibration) which leads to a crosslinking of boron oxide units. This dehydration processes is also documented by Venegas et al. by a mass loss in terms of water of activated boron nitride.50 At a temperature above 450 °C, this cross-linked network begins to melt. Because of the higher degree of oxidation (see. Figure 2a) the thickness of the molten layer is higher, and probably surrounds the boron nitride particles. We presume that an oxygen functionalization via a calcination procedure leads directly to a liquid phase. This assumption is affirmed by Liu et al., who impregnated diboron trioxide on boron phosphate and observed a melting process, too.51
Because of the necessary pre-activation of boron nitride, which is mentioned in various publications24, 52, evidence of a dynamic surface composition of the catalyst during the ODHP and the presented results, the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is catalyzed by a supported liquid boron oxide phase at reaction temperatures above 450 °C. Taking further into account, that pristine boron nitride does not form a boron oxide layer and shows a completely different selectivity profile during the ODHP at the same reaction conditions it is obvious, that a liquid boron oxide phase is responsible for the high selectivity to olefins of pre-activated boron nitride.
Conclusion
Here, we compared two strategies of oxygen activation of hexagonal boron nitride. Via an alkalimetric titration it was possible to quantify the molar amount of boron oxide species of pristine and spent catalysts. It was found that, depending on the hBN oxygen functionalization, different boron oxide groups were generated. The different nature of these groups correlated to the catalytic activity. Ball-mill activated hBN showed a high propane conversion (40 %) at the beginning, and then a rapid deactivation took place (10–20 %), whereas calcined hBN had a constant activity (up to 25 % propane conversion). Even at a low WHSV (1.4 gC3H8 gcat−1h−1) the selectivity to olefins of all activated boron nitride samples reached approximately 90 %. With the aid of DSC and in situ XRD characterization an amorphous diboron trioxide phase was detected for both type of oxygen functionalized boron nitride catalysts. When pristine boron nitride was utilized as catalyst, neither a high selectivity to olefins nor a boron oxide phase was observed. Regarding the melting point of diboron trioxide (450 °C) and our results, we postulate that after an induction period boron nitride ends up in a catalytically active liquid boron oxide melt which is responsible for the high olefin selectivity in the ODHP. Therefore, the ODHP catalyzed by boron species can be seen as supported liquid phase catalysis.

The total volume of the balls corresponded to 26 mL. After ball-milling, boron nitride was washed 3-times with deionized water. The samples are named as BN_rotation velocity, e. g. BN_150 rpm.
Hexagonal boron nitride (0.5 g) was calcined at different temperatures (800 °C to 1000 °C) in a muffle furnace (L 97 R, Nabertherm) in air for 2 h with a heating ramp of 300 K h−1. The samples are named as BN_calcination temperature, e. g. BN_900 °C).
Catalyst testing
For a typical catalytic test a quartz reactor (4 mm ID) was filled with approximately 250 mg activated boron nitride. Reactions were carried out at 530 °C with a total volume flow of 10 mL min−1 (standard pressure and temperature (STP)) (molar ratio 3/2/5 C3H8/O2/N2), (WHSV 1.4 gC3H8 gcat−1 h−1). The exhaust gases were analyzed using a gas chromatograph (DANI 86.10) equipped with an alumina BOND/MAPD column (Restek) and a flame ionization detector. A FT-IR-spectrometer (Alpha, Bruker) was employed to detect combustion products. The blank measurement at these conditions indicates only a minor propane conversion under 2 %, which can be neglected (Figure S1). All experiments show no mass or heat transport limitations. The calculations are listed in the supplementary information (S8), too
Material characterization
X-ray powder diffraction. The crystallinity of the activated BN samples was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku Miniflex equipped with a D/tex Ultra detector (CuKα, 40 kV, 0.03 mm Ni-filter).
In situ X-ray powder diffraction. In situ XRD was carried out using an Empyrean (MalvernPanalytical) with a PreFIX modul (BraggBrentanoHD), a PIXcel1D-detector and reactor chamber XRK 900 (Anton Paar). Measurements occurred in Bragg-Brentano geometry with CuKα radiation. Each diffractogram was measured 10 : 23 min. The total volume flow was 20 mL min−1 (STP) (molar ratio 3/2/5 C3H8/O2/N2). The mass of the catalyst was 50 mg.
Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy. The surface chemistry was investigated by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) using a Bruker Vertex 70 XSA spectrometer with a MCT detector. Potassium bromide (Sigma Aldrich) or the pristine activated catalyst was used as reference. The resolution was 2.0 cm−1.
Alkalimetric titration. The titration was carried out with a 0.1 N KOH solution as titrant. 20 to 50 mg of the BN sample were solved in 0.2 M mannite aqueous solution under sonication for 2 min. An automated titrator (Mettler Toledo T 50) equipped with a pH-electrode (DGI-111-SC) controlled the titrant dosage. With the aid of ICP-OES analysis, the titration method was validated. The relative deviation between titration and ICP-OES results was below 8 %, which confirmed that the proposed titration method is a viable method for the quantification of boron oxide species (Table S1).
Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). For the preparation of the ICP-OES analysis, the synthesized BN samples were dissolved in a mixture of nitric acid (HNO3, 65 vol.-%, Acros Organics), and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 32 vol.-%, Alfa AESAR) in a volumetric ratio of 1 : 3. To ensure that boron oxide was solubilized and BN remained insolubly, the acid-containing dispersion was rested for 24 h at room temperature. Afterwards, deionized water was added to a total volume of 25 mL. A volume of 10 mL was separated and diluted with 40 mL of deionized water to a total volume of 50 mL. The ICP-OES analysis was carried out with an Optima 2000DV (Perkin Elmer).
N2-Physisorption. The specific surface area was evaluated by Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) method using nitrogen adsorption (Quadrasorp, Quantachrome) at 77 K. Before analyzing, the sample was dried at 350 °C for 18 h at 0.02 mbar.
Difference scanning calorimetry. For the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis (NETZSCH DSC 204 F1 Phoenix) a heating ramp of 10 K min−1 until 585 °C under argon gas flow was chosen. The sample mass was 5 to 10 mg and an alumina crucible was used.
