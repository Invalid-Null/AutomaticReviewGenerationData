Abstract
The mesoporous Sn-SBA-15 (SSF) with varied pore size from was synthesized by changing the hydrothermal temperature, and used to disperse the PtSn oxides (PtSn/SSF) through a typical incipient wetness impregnation method. The pore size had the profound effects on porosity, particle size, the redox property, dispersion and surface chemical state etc. by applying N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, XRD, HRTEM, TPR, H2-chemisorption, XPS and in situ CO-DRIFT etc. techniques. The catalytic deactivation was mainly caused by sintering of active phase and coke deposition which was identified and quantified by combining Raman and TG analysis. The optimal pore size in this study was 8 nm, corresponding to the sample PtSn/SSF#8 over which the highest propane conversion of 46.9% and the least coke 16.8 mgC/gcat. were achieved.

1. Introduction
Light olefins including ethylene and propylene are important building block molecules for the synthesis of downstream chemical products and intermediates [1]. Taking propylene as an example, it is the basic raw material of the three major synthetic materials, of which the largest amount is used to produce polypropylene. Propylene is traditionally produced as a by-product by the cracking of naphtha and coal [2], which cannot meet the expanded market demand anymore. On the other hand, the exploit of unconventional natural gas like shale gas provides abundant and cheap light alkane sources [3]. The main production propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction becomes very effective and competitive due to the following advantages such as single feed (propane), single product (propylene), wide source of raw materials, and low cost [4, 5].
The commercial processes of propane dehydrogenation mainly include the Oleflex process developed by UOP and Catofin process held by CB&I Lummus, where Cr/Al2O3 and Pt−Sn/Al2O3 [6] are used in the two processes, respectively. Cr-based catalysts are toxic, the use of it would bring negative effect on environment. Platinum-based catalysts are widely used to catalytic dehydrogenation of propane because of the characteristics of higher activity, and much lower carbon deposition rate than that of chromium-based catalysts though the cost is higher [7], [8], [9]. The challenges are still from the improvements of coke resistance and anti-sintering of active sites under the reaction conditions since propane dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction. The former affects the number of active sites and the catalytic stability, the latter is conducive to structure-sensitive side reactions that would reduce the selectivity of propylene. To prepare platinum-based catalysts with high stability, good activity, resistance to carbon deposition, historians have made a lot of contributions in exploring carriers, additives, preparation methods [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. The results showed that the type of carrier had a significant impact on catalytic activity and stability. It has been reported that platinum-based catalysts with mesoporous molecular sieve as the carrier showed better performance in the dehydrogenation reaction than those using traditional Al2O3 or SiO2 carrier thanks to the virtue of ordered pore structure, higher thermal stability and higher specific surface area [15], [16], [17]. Compared with other mesoporous materials such as SBA-3, MCM-41, SBA-15 is favored in the field of catalysis due to its special pore structure and pore size, thicker pore walls and better thermal stability [18, 19]. The addition of Al into SBA-15 could enhance the strong acid sites of the catalyst and benefit to the activation of CH bonds [20], [21], [22]. The surface of MgAl2O4 was wrapped with silica [23] to form a core-shell structure, which can introduce appropriate amount of acid centers and reduce the particle size of platinum clusters to improve the overall performance of catalyst. The effects of additives such as Sn, V, Ce, Fe, Y and Ge on the dispersion of active sites and their catalytic performance had been investigated [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. Especially, the metal Sn was usually introduced into Pt-based catalysts as promotor, it could keep the Pt nanoparticles from aggregating and improve the propylene selectivity. Moreover, it was reported that the metallic Sn could also act as active sites for propane dehydrogenation and exhibit comparable catalytic performance to PtSn-based catalysts [30, 31]. Adding additive can change the interaction between the active sites and the support, which further affected the dispersion of the active components. The support with a large specific surface area is in favor with the migration of carbon deposit, which could reduce the amount of coke on active metal and thus prolong the life of catalyst. Since the support structure has a significant impact on the catalyst performance, the pore size effect of the support Sn-SBA-15 on propane dehydrogenation would be focused in this work on the basis of our previous work [26], which has indicated the In promoted InPt/SSF had attractive performance on propane dehydrogenation as the In additive improved the reduction of surface Pt oxides and stabilized the metallic Pt under the reaction conditions, which consequently led to the improvements in both propane conversion and propylene selectivity.
In current work, the Sn-SBA-15 was synthesized through hydrothermal method under different temperatures to obtain carriers with different pore size, which were then used to disperse the active sites to get the catalyst. Combining with various characterization techniques to investigate the effect of pore size on structure, redox, dispersion of the active sites of PtIn/Sn-SBA-15 catalyst and the performance of propane dehydrogenation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Mesoporous Sn-SBA-15 (SSF) with Sn content of 0.5 wt.% was synthesized by one-pot hydrothermal method according to the procedure reported in the literature [32], the pore diameter was tuned by varying the hydrothermal temperatures (70, 100, 120, 140 °C), the resulting supports were marked as SSF#x (x = 5, 8, 11 and 14, representing the average diameter determined by N2 ad/desorption isotherms). The supported PtIn/SSF#x catalysts with Pt loading of 1 wt.% and In loading of 1 wt.% were prepared by co-impregnation method using H2PtCl6•6H2O and In(NO3)3•6H2O as the precursors of Pt and In, respectively. The solvent was evaporated at 80 °C, then dried at 100 °C for 12 h, and finally calcined at 500 °C for 4 h in static air.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The textural properties of both mesoporous support and catalyst were analyzed by the low-temperature nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms on a Quantachrome Nova 1000e apparatus. The sample was first degased at 300 °C for 3 h in vacuum environment. The specific surface area was calculated according to the BET (Brunaue-Emmett-Teller) equation, the total pore volume and average pore size distribution were calculated using the BJH (Barett-Joyner-Halenda) method.
The crystalline phase was analyzed on a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer (Cu Kα, 40 kV, 35 mA, λ = 1.5406 Å) in the range from 10° to 90° with steps of 3.6 °/min.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a XSAM 800 spectrometer using Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) to check the chemical state of catalyst surface, the C 1 s (284.6 eV) peak from adventitious carbon was used as a reference.
CO probed Diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared (CO-DRIFT-IR) was carried out on a Thermo Scientific Nicolet-iS50 FT-IR spectrometer with a MCT detector. The sample was first pretreated at 350 °C in a He flow (10 mL/min) for 1 h. The background spectrum was subsequently recorded after cooling down to 30 °C. A pure CO (99.99%) flow (10 mL/min) was introduced to saturate the sample for 1 h, which was afterwards switched to He flow (10 mL/min) to remove the free CO molecules. The cell was purged in He flow for 60 min to get the time-resolved spectra.
H2 temperature-programmed desorption (H2-TPD) characterization was implemented on Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 equipped with a quartz U-type tubular reactor and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). 100 mg of the sample was loaded into the center of the quartz reaction tube and pre-reduced in H2/Ar flow (10 vol.% H2 in Ar, 30 mL/min) at 500 °C for 2 h, consequently cooled down to 50 °C. The TPD was finally proceeded from 50 to 800 °C.
H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiment was performed on a TP5080 system (Tianjin Xianquan, China). 100 mg of catalyst was loaded into the center of quartz reactor (i.d.: 4 mm), and pretreated at 300 °C in N2 atmosphere (30 mL/min) for 1 h to remove the impurities. After cooling down to 50 °C, the reductive atmosphere H2/Ar (5 vol.% H2 in Ar, 30 mL/min) was switched to start the TPR test. The hydrogen consumption curves were recorded from 50 to 700 °C with a ramp of 5 °C/min.
The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a Q500 V6.4 Build 193 analyzer to quantify the deposited coke. The spent catalyst was heated from 50 to 800 °C in diluted air with a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
Raman spectra were measured on the Thermal Fisher DXR apparatus (wavelength of laser beam: λ = 455 nm) equipped with a CCD detector. The Raman shift was recorded in the range of 50−3000 cm−1.
The transmission electron microscope (TEM) was characterized on the FEI Talos F200S Super-X apparatus with the acceleration voltage of 220 kV.
2.3. Catalytic reaction of propane dehydrogenation
The propane dehydrogenation reaction was evaluated in a conventional fixed bed reactor under atmospheric pressure. Typically, 0.2 g of catalyst diluted with 1.8 g of quartz sand were placed in the isotherm zone of reaction tube (i.d.: 10 mm, length: 200 mm). The catalyst was first reduced at 600 °C for 2 h, and then cooled down to 580 °C for the reaction. The feedstock composed of propane and argon (molar ratio 1:4) passed the catalyst bed at a flow rate of 30.0 mL/min (WHSV= 4.05 h − 1). The products and unreacted propane were analyzed online by GC-3000B equipped with a packed column (Paropak Q, o.d. 3 mm × 3 m) and thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The propane conversion
and main product selectivity
were calculated in the following equations:
Where
and
are the molar quantity of propane at inlet and outlet, respectively; ni represents the molar quantity of the carbonaceous compounds such as CH4, C2H4, C2H6 and C3H6, ni-C corresponds the number of carbon atom in each product.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Porous structure of support and catalyst
Fig. 1(A) showed the N2 ad/desorption isotherms of different supports, all of them belonged to type IV isotherm according to IUPAC classification with H2 hysteresis loop [33], which were the characteristics of mesoporous material. Hydrothermal temperature exhibited its significantly effect on porous structure. The capillary condensation SSF#5 took place in the range of relative pressure from 0.60 to 0.76, which gradually shifted to higher relative pressure zones: 0.62∼0.80 for SSF#8, 0.66∼0.88 for SSF#11 and 0.68∼0.98 for SSF#14, implying the uniformity of pore became worse under the higher treatment temperature. The evident difference could be further observed from pore size distribution in Fig. 1(B), high temperature caused the formation of pores with larger diameter, and widened the distribution zones.

The isotherms and pore size distribution as shown in Fig. 2 kept almost unchanged after loading Pt and In oxides, suggesting that the pore structure did not change significantly. The quantified surface area, pore volume, and average pore size of the bare support and the catalysts were listed in Table 1. It can be seen that the specific surface area of support SSF gradually decreased from 603.8 m2/g for SSF#5 to 300.3 m2/g for SSF#14 with the hydrothermal temperature varied from 70 to 140 °C, which was related to the growth of crystals at different hydrothermal temperatures and a partial destruction of highly ordered hexagonal pore structure [34]. On the other hand, the specific surface area lost by different extent after supporting Pt and In oxides, which was strongly dependent on pore structure. Comparing with the bare supports, the lost surface area followed the decreasing order: PtIn/SSF#5 (9.7%) > PtIn/SSF#8 (6.0%) > PtIn/SSF#11 (4.0%) > PtIn/SSF#14 (0.5%). Concerning the pore volume and pore size, the values were comparable after supporting. One can conclude that the support with small diameter like SSF#5 and SSF#8 might be partially blocked by the active sites, which resulted in the loss of specific surface area. However, the unchanged pore volume and pore diameter suggested that the active phases could be homogeneously dispersed on support.

3.2. Crystalline phase
XRD analysis was carried out the reduced catalysts and the patterns were gathered in Fig. 3, showing a broad diffraction peak between 20 and 30°, which was attributed to the typical reflection of amorphous silica [35]. The diffraction peak at 2θ of 39.6° could be found in all catalyst, they were ascribed to the metallic Pt because of the reduction of Pt oxides, specially the intensity of it for sample PtIn/SSF#8 was weaker. The diffraction peaks originated from additive In and Sn species were not observed, which may be as the result of the low loading and/or high dispersion state on catalyst surface.

The HRTEM was further carried out on the reduced catalysts to verify the morphology and distribution of metal species, the images together with particle size distribution were gathered in Fig. 4, showing clearly the highly ordered two-dimensional hexagon mesoporous structure from the support SBA-15 [36]. The metal species like black dots located randomly on catalysts, but no evident aggregation of particles could be observed.

It has been reported that the metal phases may include platinum-indium alloy, platinum cluster and indium oxide on the surface of carrier after reduction [37]. The lattice d-spacing of samples a, b, c and d were 0.392, 0.399, 0.392 and 0.391 nm, respectively, corresponding to the reflection from (222) plane of metallic Pt [38, 39]. The result indicated the presence of Pt0 and confirmed the XRD findings as well. However, the platinum-indium alloy or Indium species were not detected, which might be caused by its well dispersion.
Scherrer's equation was applied to estimate the crystallite size of metallic Pt in reduced and spent catalysts [40], it was 7.3 nm in sample PtIn/SSF#5 according to the results in Table 2, dropped down to 5.4 nm in PtIn/SSF#8. When the pore size continued getting bigger, it increased to 6.8 in PtIn/SSF#11 and reached maximum of 7.6 in PtIn/SSF#14. HRTEM provided a powerful and visual solution to analyze the metallic particles, and their size could be directly measured.

The particle size distributed differently (Fig. 4) depending on the varied pore size of catalyst. During the process of drying, platinum crystallites from small droplet containing Pt was formed, the pore size had a significant influence on the size of platinum crystallites inside the pores of support. The average size for each sample was listed in Table 2, showing the quite close values to those estimated by XRD.
3.3. Surface analysis by xps
The chemical state of surface elements was investigated by XPS measurement which was performed on the reduced catalysts. The In3d and Pt4f spectra were depicted in Fig. 5. The In species contained two types of chemical states in all samples, metallic In0 at the binding energy of ca. 443.9 eV, and In3+ at the binding energy of ca. 445.1 eV [27]. While their fraction was strongly dependent on pore size. The metallic In was the minority phase in sample PtIn/SSF#5, taking up around 28.6% which increased sharply by nearly 2 times to 54.2% for the sample PtIn/SSF#8, and finally reached 69.2% for the sample PtIn/SSF#14 (Table 3). These results suggested that the reduction of metal oxides was significantly affected by the pore size of SBA-15 support. The catalyst with wider pore size was in favor of the reduction of indium oxides, the similar results could be also observed for platinum oxides. The spin-orbit splitting of Pt made the XPS spectrum show two main peaks (Δ=3.35 eV) of Pt4f between ca. 80 eV and 68 eV, corresponding to the Pt4f7/2 at ca. 70.7 eV and the Pt4f5/2 at ca. 74.1 eV. The metallic Pt (ca. 71.1 eV) and the oxidative states including Pt2+ (ca. 72.2 eV) and Pt4+ (ca. 74.9 eV) were detected [41, 42], suggesting that the Pt oxide was only partially reduced. The quantification in Table 3 revealed that the percentage of Pt° changed gradually changed from 40.4% to 64.6% as the pore size changed from 5 nm for PtIn/SSF#5 to 14 nm for PtIn/SSF#14. In addition, it could be found that from In3d XPS spectra that the binding energy of In3+ species shifted to higher side by 0.6∼0.7 eV when the average pore size was higher than 5 nm. Correspondingly in the Pt4f spectra, the binding energy of Pt4+, Pt2+ and Pt0 species shifted to higher side by different extent. These results may imply that the In3+ species and the Pt species with low valence especially the transition state of Pt2+ existed strong interaction with the support, which facilitated the reduction of Pt and In species. As a result, a metallic In and Pt rich surface was obtained. In addition, a peak (gray dashed line) between 74 and 75 eV could be observed for all samples, it is normally originated from the Al2p spectrum. The presence of it was probably due to the contaminant during the analysis since Al element was not included in the catalysts.

PtIn/SSF#14 0.13 0.07 69.9 29.9 30.7 69.3 18.5 16.9 64.6
The surface composition was reported in Table 3, showing a different distribution of elements distribution, especially for the metal cations. PtIn/SSF#5 and PtIn/SSF#8 had the identical surface content of Pt (0.08%) which reached the top on PtIn/SSF#11 (0.14%) and then slightly declined on PtIn/SSF#14 (0.13%). As far as the surface In content was concerned, it gave a maximum value of 0.11% on sample PtIn/SSF#5, then decreased to 0.09% on PtIn/SSF#8 and PtIn/SSF#11, finally to bottom of 0.07% on PtIn/SSF#14. Obviously, the effect of pore size on metal species distribution was different.
3.4. Surface chemical environment of pt species by in situ co-drift
In situ DRIFT technique offers a more precise technique to detect the surface Pt species using CO as a probing molecule. The spectra obtained after 30 min evacuation were depicted in Fig. 6, mainly showing two overlapped peaks between 2100 and 1950 cm−1 which was usually ascribed to the adsorbed CO on metallic Pt [43, 44]. The bands located at ca. 2027 and ca. 2000 cm−1 were assigned to the linear-bonded CO on low coordinated Pt and PtIn alloy, respectively. The signal of CO absorbed on pure metallic Pt located at ca. 2090 cm−1 which shifted to lower wavenumber side significantly in our cases. The red shift was normally caused by i) higher dispersion of metal species and/or ii) electron transfer from In to Pt, the enhanced electron density of Pt species strengthened the Pt-CO (d-π) bonds through π back donation. These results were similar to those in NiIn alloy. The weak bands between 2200 and 2100 cm−1 was ascribed to the linear adsorption of CO on Ptδ+ (δ≥1). No evident band could be found in the range from 1900 to 1800 cm−1 originated from CO adsorbed on Pt in bridged form, suggesting that the Pt was well isolated by In species [45].

3.5. Reducibility determined by H2-TPR
The interaction between metal oxides and support was checked by H2-TPR, the hydrogen consumption curves were gathered in Fig. 7. The reduction of Pt species occurred at relative low temperature below 250 ℃ which combined the two processes from Pt4+ via Pt2+ to Pt0 state for the all samples. The resulting hydrogen consumption in Table 4 showed comparable values for PtIn/SSF#5 and PtIn/SSF#8 (86.6 vs 85.3 μmol/gcat.), it increased slightly to 89.7 μmol/gcat. for PtIn/SSF#11 and reached maximum of 102.3 μmol/gcat. for PtIn/SSF#14. The results suggested that the different pore size did change the reduction behaviors of Pt species, but catalyst with bigger pore size could have larger number of Pt species to be reduced.

PtIn/SSF#11 89.7 172.3 262.0
PtIn/SSF#14 102.3 307.7 410.0
PtIn/SSF#8 exhibited considerable hydrogen consumption of 140.0 μmol/gcat. between 250 and 550 °C, it was nearly 10 times as high as that for PtIn/SSF#5 (14.6 μmol/gcat.). This stage presented overlapped peaks which were probably assigned to the stepwise reduction of In species. It shifted to higher temperature side, indicating the enhanced interaction between metal and support as the pore size getting wider [46, 47]. In the meantime, the hydrogen consumption rose to 172.3 μmol/gcat. for PtIn/SSF#11 and to the maximum of 307.7 μmol/gcat. for PtIn/SSF#14, showing significant effects from pore size. Few hydrogens were consumed above 550 °C, which could be assigned to the reduction of strongly interacted Pt species. Obviously, these results were well agreement with the XPS findings: i) more Pt4+ species were reduced for the sample with bigger pore size, while the proportion of it fluctuated within 10%, ii) similar phenomenon was also observed for In species whose reduction was significantly affected by pore size, the ratio of In3+ species lost more than 40%. Especially for sample PtIn/SSF#5, In3+ species were really hard to reduce.
3.6. Desorption behaviors by H2-TPD
H2-TPD was used to determine the H2 adsorption/desorption behavior of the catalyst, the desorption profiles were gathered in Fig. 8, showing mainly two desorption regions: i) the one between 50 °C and 200 °C corresponded to the H2 desorbed from metallic platinum, and ii) the other one between 450 °C and 800 °C was probably assigned to spillover hydrogen instead of strongly chemisorbed hydrogen and hydrogen in subsurface layers of platinum due to the its quite large quantity [48, 49] which could be clearly seen from Table 5.

PtIn/SSF#11 0.7 80.7 81.4 22.7

Additionally, PtIn/SSF#5 and PtIn/SSF#8 exhibited the largest but comparable H2 desorption capacity (∼108 μmol/gcat.), especially in the high-temperature region, indicating that the metallic Pt particles uniformly distributed. Whereas for the samples PtIn/SSF#11 and PnntIn/SSF#14, the spillover hydrogen peaks became gradually wide with attenuated intensity, implying that the adsorption of hydrogen on catalyst weakened. It was likely related to the formation of bigger metallic particles on sample with wider pore [50].
It has been reported that the Pt site conducted directly on support was favorable for the hydrogen adsorption at low temperature, and was responsible for the hydrogenolysis reaction and carbon deposition reaction. While the Pt site isolated by Indium oxide from the support surface absorbed a larger amount of hydrogen at high temperature and was more beneficial to the propane dehydrogenation reaction [51]. Based on this point of view, the PtIn/SSF#5 and PtIn/SSF#8 catalysts possessed stronger capacity of hydrogen spillover thanks to the higher dispersion of metallic Pt particles (see Table 5). On the contrary, PtIn/SSF#11 and PtIn/SSF#14 catalysts had the least H2 adsorption capacity, implying that the metal particles in the catalysts become more unstable.
3.7. Catalytic evaluation on propane dehydrogenation
The effect of pore size on propane dehydrogenation was studied and the catalytic performances were reported in Table 6. The catalytic evaluation on support SSF#8 were also carried out as a reference, showing quite low conversion of propane (<3%) and low selectivity of propylene (44.9%). The performances were significantly improved through loading the PtIn species. What could be seen from it is that as the pore size changed, the initial propane conversion (X0) was different and followed the decreasing sequence: PtIn/SSF#8 (46.9%) > PtIn/SSF#11 (42.5%)> PtIn/SSF#5 (41.5%) > PtIn/SSF#14 (37.3%). The catalyst deactivated differently after reacting for 7 h, the final conversion of propane (Xf) gave the similar trend, whereas the extent increased gradually from 8.0% to 15.8% when pore size changed from 5.0 nm for PtIn/SSF#5 to 14 nm for PtIn/SSF#14. On the other hand, the selectivity of propylene stabilized always at ca. 99.0%, suggesting that the deactivation of catalyst was mainly caused by the loss of active sites due to coke deposition. The catalytic reaction results obtained on the similar Pt/PtSn supported on (metal-doped) silicious molecular sieves were collected and gathered in Table 7, it could be found, regardless of the differences in reaction conditions, that our results in present work was comparable to those achieved on PtSn/Fe-S1 catalyst [41].

The catalytic stability was performed on PtIn/SSF#8 catalyst, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity within 60 h time on stream were depicted in Fig. 9(left). The catalyst underwent a fast deactivation in first 6 h, the propane conversion changed from ca. 46% to ca. 32%, the propylene kept at ca. 95%. It dropped down slowly to ca. 25% between 6 and 20 h, whereas the propylene selectivity lost greatly ca. 82%, which implied that the reaction pathway changed. The sintering of active site was probably responsible for that. After this period, both the propane conversion and propylene selectivity kept roughly stable at ca. 23% and ca. 80%, respectively. The catalyst regeneration was carried out every 4 h, and five reaction-regeneration cycles were proceeded, the results were reported in Fig. 9(right). The propane conversion exhibited globally decreasing trend in first 6 h, which was quite similar to the long-term test. Concerning the propylene selectivity, it held nearly constant in cycle 1, the trend was duplicated in cycle 2. The continuous loss of activity meant that the inreversible deactivation occurred due to the sintering of active sites, assuming that the deposited coke was removed during the regeneration process. Fortunately, the sintering was too weak to affect the propylene production. The propane conversion then maintained at around 25%, and the propylene selectivity did not give an obvious downward trend in cycle 3, 4 and 5, which demonstrated that the catalyst got a steady state.

3.8. Characterization of spent catalysts
The spent catalysts were further characterized to explore the catalytic deactivation. The crystalline phase analysis in Fig. 10 gave two another diffraction peaks at 46.1°and 67.2° besides the one at 39.6° all of which originated from metallic Pt. The diffraction peaks at 30.9° and 32.4° became visible after reaction, suggesting the presence of In2O3 (PDF#22–0336). The aggregation of metallic Pt site took place under the reaction conditions as the crystallite size increased by more than 60% for each catalyst from Table 2. However, the smallest Pt particle was still detected in sample PtIn/SSF#8.

Raman spectroscopy was used to identify the type of carbonaceous species, the absorption peaks at 1350 cm−1 and 1590 cm−1 in Fig. 11 were usually considered as D band and G band, representing the in-plane defects and disordered carbon, and the graphitic carbon species, respectively [56, 57]. Normally, the intensity ratio of the D band to the G band was the important indicator of measuring the degree of graphitization of carbon materials. The ID/IG results of all samples were reported in Table 6, showing a decreasing order as: PtIn/SSF#14 (0.67) > PtIn/SSF#11 (0.66) > PtIn/SSF#8 (0.63) > PtIn/SSF#5 (0.59). The ratio changed in a narrow range between 0.59 and 0.67, such a trend suggested that the graphite form carbon was the majority in the deposits and it was much easier to generate on catalyst with smaller pore size. That was saying that propylene was firstly converted into oligomers and aromatics which was afterwards deeply dehydrogenated to form graphite carbon on catalyst surface. These results indirectly indicated the good ability of dehydrogenation, a high selectivity of propylene was gain over these catalysts.

The deposited coke was further quantified by running TG analysis in diluted oxygen atmosphere, the weight loss process was recorded and depicted in Fig. 10. Usually, the weight loss below 300 °C was due to the removal of physisorbed water and impurity. The combustion of coke took place above 300 °C which was strongly dependent on the type of carbonaceous species. The quantified results were shown in Table 6. Generally speaking, the all samples had a good performance in coke resistance as the quantity of coke was small and varied in a small range from 16.8 to 45.1 mgC/gcat.. While the quantity of coke did not change regularly with the change of catalyst pore size, the minimum number of coke was formed on sample PtIn/SSF#8.
4. Discussion
In general, metallic Pt was considered as the active center for propane dehydrogenation reaction. The hydrothermal temperature could change the structural properties of the carrier, thereby affecting the catalytic performance of the catalyst by altering the dispersion and redox etc. properties of active components. The BET characterization demonstrated the wider pore could be formed with higher hydrothermal temperature treatment conditions, leading to the gradual decrease in the specific surface area as the increased pore diameter. When the sample quantity of Pt and Sn species were loaded on silica support, the one with small pores lost more species surface area (cf. Table 1) due to the probably partial filling. Nevertheless, the pore size exhibited its significant impact on particle size of Pt species, the minimum value was obtained on sample PtIn/SSF#8, which was implied by XRD and HRTEM characterizations (cf. Table 2). The smaller pore like the support SSF#5 might hinder the diffusion of metallic cations during the impregnation and even thermal treatment. On the other hand, the bigger pores like the supports SSF#11 and SSF#14 facilitated the mobility of metal species and finally aggregated to bigger Pt particles. The dispersion of Pt species decreased from 77.2% to 18.3% as the pore size changed from 5 to 14 nm (cf. Table 5), indicating that the support with small pores was good to disperse the metal species, which was associated with its higher specific surface area. Although the higher dispersion was gained on catalyst with smaller pores, however, the reduction process became more difficult as less hydrogen was consumed in TPR (cf. Table 4). Such a result was further confirmed by XPS analysis as the metallic Pt (Pt0) in surface Pt species increased from 22.4% to 32.4% (cf. Table 3), the surface content of metallic Pt therefore finally followed the increasing order as PtIn#SSF5 (0.018%) < PtIn#SSF8 (0.020%) < PtIn#SSF11 (0.041%) < PtIn#SSF14 (0.042%). These properties were correlated with reaction data in order to understand the difference in catalytic activity, it was hard to present some kind of descriptors among them except the crystallite size, which was shown in Fig. 12. The highest initial conversion of propane (46.9%) was obtained on PtIn#SSF8 which contained the smallest Pt particle (5.4 nm). The Pt particles aggregated during the reaction, resulting in the catalytic deactivation. But the Pt particle size was still the smallest (9.0 nm) among the spent catalysts, correspondingly, the propane conversion was still at the top level (42.9%) in the end. Obviously, the sintering of active metal phase took place during the reaction. Coke deposition was another factor causing the catalytic deactivation according to the Raman and TG analysis (cf. Table 6). The pore size of catalyst showed it important role in improving the coke resistance, the best performance was obtained on sample PtSn/SSF#8.

5. Conclusion
The support Sn-SBA-15 (SSF) with varied pore size from 5 to 14 nm was successfully synthesized through changing the temperature of hydrothermal treatment. The loading of Pt and In oxides caused the loss of specific surface area especially for the sample with small pore size like PtSn/SSF#5, which was probably associated with the aggregation of metal species, resulting the smallest particles were formed on PtSn/SSF#5 from XRD and HRTEM characterizations. Pore size affected significantly the redox property of catalysts, PtSn/SSF#5 consumed the least hydrogen (101.2 μmol/gcat.) although it exhibited the best dispersion of active phases (77.2%), which was related to the particle size and specific surface area. Such a truth was further evidenced by XPS, the metallic Pt0 and In0 gradually increased with increased pore size. The essential factor to determine the propane conversion was the size of active phase, the smaller one was more conducive to convert propane whatever for the initial or final conversion. As a result, the highest initial propane conversion of 46.9% was achieved on PtSn/SSF#8. Additionally, the pore size of catalyst also showed its impacts on catalytic deactivation due to the sintering of active phase and coke deposition.
