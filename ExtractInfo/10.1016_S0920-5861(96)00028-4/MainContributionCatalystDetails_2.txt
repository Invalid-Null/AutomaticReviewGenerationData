The given document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically for the conversion of propane to propylene. While it examines metal cations in alkane reactions catalyzed by modified H-ZSM5, including propane conversions, it does not focus on PDH or ODH for propylene production. Therefore, I have indicated that the document is not directly relevant.
