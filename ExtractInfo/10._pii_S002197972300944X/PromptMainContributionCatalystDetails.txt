AbstractAbstract
Porous alumina has been widely used as catalytic support for industrial processes. Under carbon emission constraints, developing a low-carbon porous aluminum oxide synthesis method is a long-standing challenge for low-carbon technology. Herein, we report a method involving the only use of elements of the aluminum-containing reactants (e.g. sodium aluminate and aluminum chloride), sodium chloride was introduced as the coagulation electrolyte to adjust the precipitation process. Noticeably, the adjustment of the dosages of NaCl would allow us to tailor the textural properties and surface acidity with a volcanic-type change of the assembled alumina coiled plates. As a result, porous alumina with a specific surface area of 412 m2/g, large pore volume of 1.96 cm3/g, and concentrated pore size distribution at 30 nm was obtained. The function of salt on boehmite colloidal nanoparticles was proven by colloid model calculation, dynamic light scattering, and scanning/transmission electron microscopy. Afterward, the synthesized alumina was loaded with PtSn to prepare catalysts for the propane dehydrogenation reaction. The obtained catalysts were active but showed different deactivation behavior that was related to the coke resistance capability of the support. We figure out the correlation between pore structure and the activity of the PtSn catalysts associated with the maximum conversion of 53 % and minimum deactivation constant occurring at the pore diameter around 30 nm of the porous alumina. This work offers new insight into the synthesis of porous alumina.

1. Introduction
Porous alumina is a crucial industrial catalyst support utilized in various processes such as alkane dehydrogenation and catalytic reforming, accounting for approximately 60 % of all total catalyst supports due to its customizable porous structures and exceptional thermal and chemical stability[1], [2], [3]. The pore structure of alumina is crucial in heterogeneous catalysis, where the macropores facilitate mass transfer and mesoporous pores improve active metal dispersion[4], [5], [6].
To date, in order to tune the porosity of alumina, a large number of synthesis strategies have been reported, including hydrothermal[7], precipitation[8], sol–gel[9], evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA)[10], etc. The common strategy is to use the template (organic surfactants or hard templates) to copy and reserve the pore structure during the synthesis. Ma et al.[11] used yeast cell as bio-template to synthesize the alumina possessed a specific surface area of 343 m2/g and macroporous structure with sizes of 1.53 μm. Martins et al.[12] synthesized alumina with macropores from 0.1 to 6 μm and mesopores from 8 to 10 nm by integrating the sol–gel process with micelles of poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) block copolymer and oil droplets of decahydronaphthalene as dual pore templates. However, removal of templates causes additional waste and environmental pollution. Carbon emissions are the primary cause of global warming and have been recognized as a serious threat to human health and sustainable development. China is under great pressure to cut carbon emissions, as it is the world's largest carbon emitter. Although many works about the synthesis processes of alumina without template were reported, the sizes of mesopores were usually below 10 nm[13], [14], [15]. Wang et al. used Al2SO4 and NH4HCO3 to prepared alumina with a specific surface area of 504 m2/g and bimodal pore size distribution at 4 nm and 30 nm, but the roasting process would release ammonia gas[16]. As a consequence, we urgently need to develop low-carbon and mild synthesis technology for porous alumina with mesopore over 10 nm.
The precipitation method has attracted much attention because of its low cost and easy industrial scaling up[17], in which inorganic aluminum-containing salts are used, basic sodium aluminate and acidic aluminum chloride, aluminum nitrate, or aluminum sulfate undergo acid-base neutralization reaction, also called cation–anion double hydrolysis (CADH) reaction[18]. This CADH reaction allows the rapid and convenient synthesis of alumina using inexpensive sodium aluminate solutions and achieves high yields without the need for pH adjustment. For example, Bai et al.[19] had conducted much research about CADH reaction to prepare mesopore alumina with high surface area (371 m2/g) and narrow pore size distribution by using P123 as template via NaAlO2 and Al(NO3)3 reacting at 80 °C. By using a modified CADH method at 75 °C, Yang et al.[20] selected water glass as the pore-expanding agent to achieve the improvement of pore volume (1.20 cm3/g) and surface area (480 m2/g). Though certain progress on the synthesis of mesoporous alumina with a high surface has been made, there remains difficulty in the synthesis of porous alumina with large pores and high pore volume by a simple method under mild conditions.
In the field of silica synthesis, a highly porous SiO2 was obtained via the precipitation of silica from sodium silicate by sulfuric acid in the presence of sodium chloride. The function of NaCl was as the coagulating agent and preventing macro-gel formation[21], [22]. Considering the product was NaCl in the reaction of AlCl3 and NaAlO2, we innovatively developed a salt-assisted surface charge driven synthesis method of large pore alumina by introducing NaCl to sodium aluminate and aluminum chloride reaction system at room temperature. The advantages of using this inorganic agent are that it can adjust the particle aggregation rate and assembly mode in the precipitation process, so as to adjust the pore structure of the product. Using NaCl does not introduce additional impurities and can be easily removed by water extraction to obtain low-sodium alumina. In comparison with the syntheses using surfactants, our synthetic route is more economical and environmentally friendly. The use of such large pore alumina as the catalyst support for propane dehydrogenation reaction indicates the great tolerance for carbon deposition.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Chemicals
Aluminum chloride hexahydrate (AlCl3·6H2O, CAS: 7784–13-6) was purchased from Aldrich. Sodium aluminate (NaAlO2, CAS: 1138–49-1) and ethanol were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. All chemicals were of analytical grade and were used directly upon receipt without any treatment.
2.2. Salt-assisted synthesis of alumina
2.414 g aluminum chloride hexahydrate was dissolved in 20 mL deionized water under vigorous stirring at 25 °C until dissolved. 2.459 g sodium aluminate was dissolved in 60 mL deionized water at 25 °C, then sodium chloride was added to the sodium aluminate solution. After stirring for 20 min, aluminum chloride solution was pumped into the mixture solution using a syringe pump with a pumping rate of 3 mL/min, the obtained mixture solution was aged for 24 h at a varied temperature under vigorous stirring. After aging, the white slurry was filtered and washed with deionized water and ethanol. The product was dried at 50 °C for 12 h. Eventually, the alumina product was obtained after calcining at 600 °C in static air for 2 h with a heating rate of 1 °C/min. The alumina synthesized at 25 °C and calcined at 600 °C was named Al2O3-X, and the corresponding precursor was labeled as AlOOH-X, where X stands for the mass ratio of NaCl to H2O. For example, the alumina sample synthesized by adding 8 g sodium chloride was named Al2O3-0.10. The sample synthesized at 0 °C, 25 °C, and 80 °C with the mass ratio of NaCl to H2O of 0.10 was named Al2O3-0.10-T, where T stands for the synthesis temperature.
2.3. Preparation of supported PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts
Alumina-supported catalysts (PtSn-Al2O3-X) containing 0.5 wt% platinum and 0.8 wt% tin were synthesized by incipient wetness co-impregnation method using H6PtCl6·6H2O and SnCl2·2H2O as precursors. Typically, a moderate amount of precursors were dissolved in ethanol. After impregnation, the samples were kept at 25 °C for 2 h and then dried at 50 °C for 10 h. It was then calcined for 4 h in 20 % O2/N2 at 500 °C.
2.4. Catalyst tests
The catalytic performance was tested in a tubular fixed-bed quartz reactor (i.d. = 8 mm) at atmospheric pressure. The temperature of the reactor was controlled by a Yudian AI temperature controller (XMYE-8000). Reaction condition I: before the reactivity test, the catalyst was heated to 618 °C with a rate of 10 °C/min in 20 vol% H2/N2 and retained at 618 °C for 2 h. After the pretreatment, the reaction mixture of C3H8 (62 vol%) and H2 (38 vol%) was fed at a total flow of 4.8 mL min−1. A portion of 100 mg of catalyst was used in each experiment. A reaction gas mixture with a certain volume ratio was passed through the catalyst bed at 618 °C. Reaction condition II: before the reactivity test, the catalyst was heated to 590 °C with a rate of 10 °C/min in 20 vol% H2/N2 and retained at 590 °C for 2 h. After the pretreatment, the reaction mixture of C3H8 (16 vol%) and H2 (20 vol%) was fed in N2 at a total flow of 50 mL min−1. A portion of 100 mg of catalyst was used in each experiment. A reaction gas mixture with a certain volume ratio was passed through the catalyst bed at 590 °C. The products were analyzed using an online gas chromatograph. Alumina packed and molecular sieve 5A columns were used to determine the amount of N2, C4H10, C4H8, C3H8, C3H6, C2H4, C2H6, and CH4 in the products. The propane conversion and selectivity of the products were calculated using the following equations:

A first-order deactivation model was used to evaluate the catalyst stability:
where Xinitial and Xfinal, represent the conversion measured at the start and the end of an experiment, respectively, and t represents the reaction time (h), kd is the deactivation rate constant (h−1). Higher kd values were indicative of rapid deactivation, that is, low stability.
2.5. Catalyst characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was conducted on a PANalytical X'Pert3 Powder diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). The texture was carried out on a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 adsorption analyzer. Based on the adsorption data in the relative pressure range of 0.05–0.3, the specific surface area was calculated using the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images and Scanning Electron Microscope Energy Dispersive System (SEM-EDS) were conducted by a Hitachi S-4800 instrument, the voltage at the time of the test was 20 kV and the current was 20 μA. The lens was 15 mm away from the sample surface. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) tests and Zeta potential measurements were obtained by a Malvern Zetasizer NanoZS instrument at 25 °C. The actual sodium content was determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) at Optima2000DV. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) were examined on a JEOL JEM-F200 and operated at an accelerated voltage of 200 kV. H2 temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and NH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) were performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) detector. Thermogravimetric (TG) analyzer STA 449 F3 (NETZSCH) was used to determine the amount of coke deposited, flowing a mixture of 20 % O2 in N2 at 20 mL min−1 and oxidized from ambient temperature to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The CO2 concentrations were monitored by online mass spectrometry (MS). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra of thin films of aluminate solutions between KBr plates were collected on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrometer with 4 cm−1 resolution.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology and structural properties
The XRD patterns of the precursors AlOOH with different amounts of NaCl introduced were shown in Fig. 1a. The obtained precursors were boehmite phase (JCPDS Card no. 001–0774) with low crystallinity, also named pseudo-boehmite, in which the mole ratio of water to aluminum is 1.4–2.0. Apart from the first peak corresponding to (0 2 0) planes, all diffraction peaks were ascribed to the pseudo-boehmite with different crystallinity, no other crystalline phases (such as sodium chloride) were detected, indicating that NaCl could be efficiently removed by washing procedure. Since when only one to three layers were stacked in the c direction, the (0 2 0) reflection naturally shifted to about 10° because the boehmite layers appeared at longer distances[23], [24]. However, when the mass ratio of NaCl to H2O was 0.022, the intensity of the diffraction peaks increased slightly compared to the pseudo-boehmite sample without NaCl addition. As more NaCl was used (the mass ratio of NaCl to H2O was 0.05), the intensity of the diffraction peaks gradually decreased and the diffraction lines broadened, indicating a decrease in the crystallinity of the pseudo-boehmite samples. It was easy to observe that the (0 2 1) and (0 3 1) reflections shifted to a small angle as the peak breadth increased, while the (0 5 1)/ (2 0 0) reflections shifted to a larger angle. These shifts indicated that Na cation might insert into the lattice of pseudo-boehmite. TG profiles of AlOOH-0 and AlOOH-0.10 demonstrated they were pseudo-boehmites containing abundant interlayer water (Fig. S1a).

Fig. 1. The XRD patterns of (a) AlOOH and (b) Al2O3 were prepared by varying the amount of NaCl added.
Fig. 1b showed that all the reflection peaks of alumina were in good agreement with cubic γ-Al2O3 (JCPDS no.10–0425), indicating that all the precursors had been transformed into γ-Al2O3 during the calcination process. The broad diffraction peaks revealed the small crystals composed in the alumina were nanoscale. It could be found that the crystallinity of the resulting alumina decreased gradually when the mass ratio of NaCl to H2O exceeded 0.05. Taking the reflection (1 2 0) as the reference, the crystal size was calculated and listed in Table 1. When the mass ratio of NaCl to H2O was 0.10, the crystal size started to decrease, indicating that the primary particle of alumina was influenced by the introduction of extra NaCl.

Nitrogen adsorption–desorption technique was applied to examine the textural properties of alumina. Fig. 2a showed that the isotherms of all samples were type IV with H3 type hysteresis loop according to the classification of IUPAC, which was characteristic of mesoporous materials[25]. The hysteresis loop of the sample Al2O3-0 was in the P/P0 range of 0.5–1.0, and shifted to high relative pressure in the isotherm of Al2O3-0.022, Al2O3-0.05 and Al2O3-0.10, corresponding the P/P0 range of 0.7–1.0, 0.75–1.0, 0.8–1.0 respectively, suggesting the particles aggregated into large mesopores and small macropores after adding NaCl in the synthesis system[26]. While the hysteresis loop of the Al2O3-0.15 was in the P/P0 range of 0.7–1.0. Fig. 2b showed their pore size distribution (PSD) curves obtained from the adsorption branch of the isotherm using the Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method. The PSD curve of Al2O3-0 gave the most probable pore size of 15 nm, the PSD curve became more concentrated and larger after the introduction of NaCl, in the samples of Al2O3-0.022, Al2O3-0.05 and Al2O3-0.10, corresponding the most probable pore size was around 20, 21 and 30 nm, respectively (Fig. 2c). However, the most probable pore size of Al2O3-0.15 decreased to 15 nm, which might be because the excess electrolyte led to dense packing between particles. Furthermore, the texture parameters of all materials were tabulated in Table 1. It could be found that once sodium chloride was added, the BET surface area of these samples increased from 292 to 402 m2/g, and the pore volume climbed up to 1.96 cm3 g−1 with the mass ratio of NaCl to H2O of 0.022 and then decreased with more NaCl. The bulk density showed opposite changes to pore volume, first decreasing from 0.196 to 0.100 g/cm3 and then increasing (Fig. 2d). In summary, porous alumina with a high surface area and large pore structure was successfully prepared with the mass ratio of NaCl to H2O of 0.022–0.15, exceeding most of the textual properties of Al2O3 in previous reports (Table S1)[19], [20], [27], [28], [29].

As shown in Fig. 3, SEM observation revealed that the morphology of the yield products consists of a large number of small particles. Without the extra addition of NaCl during the synthesis, the product consisted of a disorderly accumulation of particles with irregular morphology (Fig. 3a). The morphology was unchanged when the mass ratio of NaCl to H2O was 0.01–0.022 (Fig. 3b, c). But when the mass ratio of NaCl to H2O exceeded 0.05, the coiled plate-like primary particles assembled in an interleaved way, which resulted in more voids in the particles (Fig. 3d-f). AlOOH-0 was more dense stacking between layers than the samples prepared with NaCl added. After calcining at 600 °C in the static air, AlOOH transformed into alumina. SEM images of other multiples were shown in Fig. S2 and S3. Only formless morphology was observed in Al2O3-0 (Fig. 4a). As introducing sodium chloride, the topography of the product changed obviously. Al2O3-0.01 and Al2O3-0.022 were formed with porous wrinkled sheet-like packing morphology (Fig. 4b, c). When the mass ratio of NaCl to H2O was 0.05–0.10, the wrinkled sheet-like particles assembled into a honeycomb-like three-dimensional porous structure (Fig. 4d, e). Although there were abundant macropores in sample Al2O3-0.15 (Fig. 4f), the pores were no longer uniform. SEM-EDS elemental mapping demonstrated that some chlorine elements remained in the synthesized sample (Fig. 4g, h, Table S2 and S3). Surprisingly, sample Al2O3-0 had more chlorine content than Al2O3-0.10, suggesting that Al2O3-0 was positively charged to adsorb chloride ions. Subsequently, the content of sodium was measured by ICP and determined as 0.26 wt% and increased to 0.29 wt% when the mass ratio of NaCl to H2O was 0.10, other samples were determined as less than 0.26 wt%, and all of them were ascribed to low sodium alumina (Table S4). In order to investigate the influence factor of the morphology, we used other electrolytes including Na2SO4 and KCl. The products were formed with subspherical small particles and their crystalline phase was an amorphous pseudo-boehmite (Fig. S4). We considered SO42- and K+ might adsorb on the specific crystal plane of the primary particles hindering the process of crystal growth and resulting in poor crystal phase and irregular morphology of the final product[30], [31]. Hence, both cation and anion affected the morphology of the alumina.

To further clarify the pore structure difference between these samples, the TEM measurements of Al2O3-0.10 and Al2O3-0 were conducted and the images were presented in Fig. 5. The results showed that Al2O3 exhibited nanosheets interact randomly into networks, and the morphology of the nanosheets was leaflets with winkle structures of which the lengths were different and the widths were between 1.95 and 4.75 nm. The TEM observation of the two samples was similar, but the former (Fig. 5a) showed low aggregation degree than the latter (Fig. 5b). In the sample Al2O3-0, nanosheet particles formed higher density clusters with large connect areas, while for sample Al2O3-0.10, nanosheet particles interconnected to construct much more porous regions. Hence, we considered that a suitable amount of NaCl led to colloidal particles aggregating and combining instantaneously, conducive to the increase of porosity and the improvement of specific surface area. STEM images were collected to display the topographical features of Al2O3-0 (Fig. 5c) and Al2O3-0.10 (Fig. 5d). Both samples were highly porous, and Al2O3-0 exhibited non-uniform pores and sheet-like morphology laterally stacked at the edges with a higher density. On the contrary, Al2O3-0.10 showed uniform pores and sheet-like particles crossing each other, it is what made up the larger pore volume and constructed the higher surface area.

3.2. Growth mechanism of alumina
On the basis of the abovementioned results, we hereby concluded the salt-assisted surface charge driven synthesis method for the preparation of honeycomb-like Al2O3, as presented in Scheme 1. The FT-IR spectra of sodium aluminate solution with different amounts of NaCl added were shown in Fig. S1b, the adsorption peak at 880 and 550 cm−1 were attributed to the Al-O-Al vibration of the dimer Al2O(OH)62- corresponding to the tetrahedral aluminum, the adsorption peak at 770 cm−1 was attributed to the Al-O-Al vibration of the Al(OH)4- corresponding the octahedral aluminum, the peaks at 880 and 550 cm−1 enhanced with the adding of NaCl, but the peak at 720 cm−1 weakened, revealing that Al(OH)4- converted to Al2O(OH)62- gradually[32].

In the early stage, before the precipitation of aluminum hydroxide, the small aluminum-based oligomers self-assembled into colloidal particles. The surface of colloidal particles was not uniformly charged. Places with more negative charges would attract other colloidal particles with positive charges to compensate for the charge. The charge was balanced and larger particles were formed by electrostatic force orientation assembly. When AlCl3 was introduced into the sodium aluminate solution, the colloidal surface would adsorb chloride ions to form micelles
. When enough chloride ions were present in the initial reaction environment, Cl- would be adsorbed to the colloidal surface until the surface potential reached saturation, at which point the crystal construction was completed. When a large amount of sodium chloride was present in the reaction system, the colloid double layer was compressed, the repulsive force between colloid particles decreased, and the stability became worse. According to the model of Hewage[33], we calculated the electric double-layer repulsion potential (Fig. 6a), the attractive van der Waals energy (Fig. 6b) and the total interacting energy of nanoparticles (Fig. 6c). The solution parameters related to the samples were shown in Table 2. The interaction energy profile showed a significant energy barrier of the attractive van der Waals forces that needed to be overcome when the mass ratio of NaCl to H2O was 0.01, with a 1.8 × 10−18 J barrier at a 2 nm separation distance. In other samples, the introduction of a suitable amount of NaCl would accelerate the assembly process, resulting in a disorderly aggregation of tiny colloidal particles that had no time to grow along a certain direction[34]. Fig. 6d showed the first derivative of the electric double-layer repulsion potential. With the increased amount of NaCl added, the first derivative gradually increased suggesting the electric double-layer repulsion potential decreased faster. The primary nanocrystals were quickly assembled into nanosheet particles. As the reaction progressed, nanosheets started to aggregate in an intertwined way. Driven by reduced surface energy, the edges of sheet particles were curled up for assembly. As the sodium chloride electrolyte accelerated the rapid assembly of primary particles, the colliding particles aggregated and instantly combined to produce a highly porous, curved AlOOH aggregate. In the sight of thermodynamics, the solubility of the precipitation would increase and the relative supersaturation would decrease, thus the nucleation rate increased and led to smaller grains size. Under the action of coagulation of electrolytes, numbers of primary crystal nuclei aggregated and grew into secondary particles, in which many pore structures were lapped. The more primary particles, the more connected holes. Hence, the BET surface area and pore volume increased. The reaction of large molecules and hydrogen ions (reaction (7), (8), (9), (10) had high steric hindrance, which was conducive to the precipitation crosslinking into a gel. After washing with ethanol and drying at 50 °C, the large pore in the product was retained.

3.3. Effect of precipitation temperature
To investigate the effect of reaction temperature on Al2O3, we conducted the precipitation at 0 °C and 80 °C with the mass ratio of NaCl to H2O of 0.10. The XRD patterns (Fig. 7a) showed that these samples all exhibited pseudo-boehmite phases with different crystallinity. The crystallinity of pseudo-boehmite increased with the increase in temperature, and the bayerite crystal phase appeared at 80 °C (JCPDS No. 20–0011). It was generally believed that there were two simultaneous mechanisms of dehydration and condensation in the aging process[35]. At low temperature, the nucleation rate and aggregation rate of the crystalline ions were slow, thus forming amorphous precipitation. At high temperature, excessive grain growth rate led to good crystallization. Correspondingly, the crystal form of alumina became complete gradually with the increase in synthesis temperature (Fig. 7b). Their nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms and the pore size distributions were obtained in Fig. 7c, d. With increasing synthesis temperature to 80 °C, the volume and size of mesopores reduced to 0.65 cm3/g and 6.5 nm. The decrease in specific surface area and pore volume might be due to the perfect crystallinity produced by the rapid particle aggregation rate. The detailed structure parameters of alumina synthesized at different temperatures were shown in Table 3.

3.4. Propane direct dehydrogenation performance
We took the high surface area and large pore volume Al2O3 as the catalyst support. Following the literature[36], PtSn-Al2O3-0, PtSn-Al2O3-0.05, and PtSn-Al2O3-0.10 catalysts were prepared, which showed similar activity (Fig. 8a and Fig. S5a). Being oriented to industrial applications, we carried out a test under high-temperature reaction conditions (Reaction condition I). Fig. 8b revealed their conversion curve. In the beginning, the initial conversion of all samples closed to 53 %. The conversion rate of PtSn-Al2O3-0.10 declined slowly in the first 15 h and then dropped severely to 35.95 % after the 30 h test. As for the control sample, the conversion rate decreased rapidly throughout the 30 h reaction time. The 30 h conversion ranked in the following order: PtSn-Al2O3-0.10 (35.95 %) > PtSn-Al2O3-0.15 (33.54 %) > PtSn-Al2O3-0.05 (31.83 %) > PtSn-Al2O3-0.022 (30.14 %) > PtSn-Al2O3-0 (29.68 %). The variation trend of propylene yield was consistent with the conversion rate. PtSn-Al2O3-0.10 had the highest yield and the most stable selectivity for propylene (Fig. S5b, c). The carbon deposition of used catalysts was characterized by TG-MS (Fig. 8c, d), the amount of carbon deposition on PtSn-Al2O3-0.10 catalyst (32 %) was higher than that on PtSn-Al2O3-0 (28 %). Previous studies demonstrated that moderately strong acids catalyzed cracking and isomerization side reactions leading to coke formation during dehydrogenation[37], [38]. The location of the coke position was investigated by monitoring CO2 concentration on MS. The peak at 550–700 °C was attributed to the coke deposited on the support, suggesting that only a little coke was located on the metal[39]. TEM images showed the dispersion of Pt particles on the support of Al2O3-0 and Al2O3-0.10 (Fig. S6a and b), Pt particles were small with an average size of 1.6 nm in PtSn-Al2O3-0.10, while there were several large particles in PtSn-Al2O3-0, which might be related to the number of hydroxyl groups on the surface. After the reaction of 30 h, the Pt particle size grew up to 5 nm and 11 nm respectively (Fig. S6c and d). The five cycles of the regeneration experiment suggested catalysts gradually declined in conversion rate (Figure S7). The XRD pattern of the spent catalysts exhibited the diffraction peaks of γ-Al2O3, indicating the crystallinity of the supports had not changed (Figure S8). We considered that the catalyst deactivation was caused by carbon deposition and the sintering of active components.

Different active behaviors of catalysts were related to the structural characteristics and chemical properties of catalysts. To determine the strength and amount of the surface acid of support, NH3-TPD was performed with ammonia as the probe molecule, and the results were shown in Fig. 9a. Generally speaking, the desorption peak of NH3 occurred in the temperature range of ∼ 170 °C, ∼ 220 °C, and ∼ 310 °C, which corresponded to the changes of NH3 desorption from low acid, medium acid, and strong acid respectively. In comparison, the amount of NH3 desorbed from Al2O3 was sorted as follows: Al2O3-0 < Al2O3-0.022 < Al2O3-0.05 < Al2O3-0.15 < Al2O3-0.10. The corresponding results of NH3-TPD were shown in Table S5. The weak acid of the synthesized alumina by the addition of NaCl decreased sharply, while the medium and strong acids increased. The aggregation rate of primary Al2O3 nanocrystals was calculated, and it was found that the amount of surface acid was positively correlated with the grain aggregation rate (Fig. S9a)[40]. Therefore, the increase in surface acidity was consistent with the increase in specific surface area and the decrease in grain size of the alumina. We selected three samples to carry out the pyridine-infrared adsorption tests. The bands at 1449 cm−1, 1492 cm−1, and 1613 cm−1 were attributed to pyridine coordinated to Lewis acid sites. Besides, the band at 1450 cm−1 attributed to Brønsted acid sites was not detected in all samples (Fig. S9b)[41]. To study the redox properties and the metal and support interaction, H2-TPR was tested and the profiles were exhibited in Fig. S9c. Of the two peaks on the curve, one was the reduction peak of Pt-Sn at 216 °C, and the other was the reduction peak of SnOx at 450 °C[42]. As observed, the results showed that the interactions between Pt and Sn were affected by different supports prepared by the use of additional NaCl. The trend of change of coke content was consistent with the deactivation constant of PDH catalysts (Fig. 9b). The coke content of the catalyst from the alumina prepared with additional NaCl increased than that of PtSn-Al2O3-0. This was similar to the tendency of pore diameter and acid sites of support (Fig. 9c, d). Interestingly, PtSn-Al2O3-0.10 with stronger acid sites exhibited high activity and stability despite accumulating more carbon deposits during the reaction, which could be related to the large pore structure of the support[43].

Subsequently, we selected four reaction time 3 h, 10 h, 20 h, 30 h to compare the effect of pore diameter, acid sites of the support on the catalyst performance (Table 4). The performances of five catalysts were similar after 3 h test and showed a volcanic trend after 10 h test. The volcanic trend gradually became obvious after 20 h. The catalyst prepared by the support with the most probable pore size of 30 nm and the most acidic sites showed the best activity and stability. The pore structure of the catalysts before and after the reaction were shown in Table S6. It could be seen that the loss of specific surface and pore volume of the catalyst PtSn-Al2O3-0.10 was the smallest. Coke-deactivated catalysts usually follow three mechanisms, namely, site coverage, pore narrowing, and pore blockage[44], [45], [46]. Some researchers thought that the catalysts with higher connectivity, larger volume-averaged pore radius, and narrower pore-size distribution can accommodate carbon deposits[43], [47], [48]. As mentioned above, Al2O3-0.10 had higher specific surface area, larger pore size and narrower pore-size distributions, which was conducive to high dispersion of active components and mass transfer of products. This sample had a high capacity to accept coke deposition and exhibited good performance as a PDH catalyst support.

4. Conclusion
Using the coagulation effect of electrolytes, we developed a salt-assisted surface charge driven synthesis method to synthesize wrinkled sheet-like alumina with a high specific surface area of 412 m2/g, large pore volume of 1.96 cm3/g, and concentrated pore size distribution at 30 nm. The method was environmentally friendly and not involving extra foreign impurities and organic templates. The salt effect changed the nucleation processes leading to the nucleation rate increase and grain size decrease. The related calculation suggested the concertation of electrolytes affected the interaction energy of colloid particles and the aggregate behaviors of AlOOH primary particles. After undergoing nucleation and growth aggregation in the presence of salt, alumina with elevated pore structure was obtained. The pore structure of the product was affected by the type and concentration of electrolyte and precipitation temperature. The propane dehydrogenation performance of the catalyst prepared by our method proved higher catalytic activity than that of the carrier synthesized without adding salt. The alumina with a large specific surface area to disperse the active phase, large pore size (30 nm) to facilitate the mass transfer, large pore volume to tolerate coke, and abundant acid sites to anchor metal display the best activity. This study provides an easy and controllable synthesis of high surface area and large pore alumina for catalysis.
