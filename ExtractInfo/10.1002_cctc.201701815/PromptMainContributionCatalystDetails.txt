Tetrahedral Nickel(II) Phosphosilicate Single-Site Selective Propane Dehydrogenation Catalyst
Graphical Abstract
Phosphate dispels nickel's catalytic demons: Single-site tetrahedral NiII phosphosilicate is highly stable and selective in propane dehydrogenation. The NiII−OSi bonds activate the alkane C−H bonds and make the NiII sites catalytically active, whereas the Ni−OP bonds prevent the reduction of NiII to Ni0 under the dehydrogenation conditions and help to achieve high stability and selectivity.
Abstract
Silica-supported Ni catalysts usually show poor stability, low selectivity, and short lifetime in high-temperature alkane dehydrogenation reactions owing to the reduction to Ni0 nanoparticles under the reaction conditions. The introduction of a phosphate ligand to silica-supported NiII provided single-site tetrahedral NiII phosphosilicate as a stable and selective propane dehydrogenation catalyst. The NiII−OSi bonds activate the C−H bonds of propane and make the NiII sites catalytically active, whereas the Ni−OP bonds prevent the reduction of NiII to Ni0 under the dehydrogenation conditions and help to achieve high stability and selectivity.
Nickel has a number of readily available oxidation states commonly invoked in catalysis. In addition to the commonly seen Ni0/NiII catalytic cycles, easy accessibility to NiI and NiIII allows different modes of reactivity and radical mechanisms. Thus, Ni catalysts have been extensively used in cross-coupling,1 oligomerization,2 hydrogenation, and reforming reactions.3 However, compared with its group 10 counterparts, especially Pt, Ni does not find broad application in high-temperature (>500 °C) light-alkane dehydrogenation reactions.4 Under these conditions, supported Ni catalysts are reduced to Ni0 nanoparticles, which usually show poor stability, fast coke deposition, high methane selectivity, and low alkene selectivity.5 To improve the stability and selectivity, several Ni-based catalysts have been studied, including NiSn,6 NiS,7 and NiP for the isobutane dehydrogenation reaction.8 NiAu bimetallic catalysts have been studied for the more challenging propane dehydrogenation reaction.9 For each of these, the active state is metallic Ni. By modifying the surface composition and structure of the Ni catalysts, selectivity to propylene can indeed be improved, but fast deactivation is still observed. To the best of our knowledge, high stability and selectivity have not been achieved for the propane dehydrogenation reaction with the use of Ni catalysts.
Ni0 forms many stable alkene complexes with synergistic alkene→Ni donation from the occupied alkene π orbital to the empty d orbitals of Ni and Ni→alkene backdonation from the occupied Ni d orbital to the empty alkene π* orbital. In many cases, strong olefin bonding comes mainly from Ni→alkene backdonation, whereas the relative contribution of alkene→Ni donation is much smaller. On the contrary, NiII–alkene complexes are much less common owing to weak NiII–alkene bonding.10 We anticipate high stability and selectivity can be achieved for alkane dehydrogenation by keeping NiII catalysts from reducing to Ni0 under the reaction conditions, which will facilitate alkene desorption and thus increase alkene selectivity. We envisioned that introduction of a phosphate ligand would help to keep NiII, and this choice was made on the basis of several reasons: 1) Ni−OP bonds should be more resistant to cleavage than Ni−OSi bonds in the presence of H2, which should help to prevent reduction; 2) H3PO4 is a stronger acid than silica surface OH groups, and it should be able to react with Ni−OH or Ni−OSi bonds to form Ni−OP bonds; 3) although stronger than silica surface −OH groups, H3PO4 is a weak acid, and the presence of P−OH groups in the catalyst should not lead to oligomerization or cracking of the olefin products; 4) nickel phosphate is thermally very stable.
On the basis of this hypothesis, we first synthesized SiO2-supported NiII, Ni/SiO2, by using strong electrostatic adsorption, which was successfully used in the synthesis of Zn/SiO2 and Co/SiO2 catalysts.11 At pH 11, the surface hydroxy groups are deprotonated, and Ni(NH3)62+ cations are electrostatically adsorbed on the surface, which ensures the isolation of NiII owing to the self-limiting nature of the reaction. Single-site NiII/SiO2 was obtained after thermal removal of the NH3 ligands at 300 °C. Atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) analysis suggested that Ni was well dispersed on the SiO2 surface with a density of approximately 0.6 Ni nm−2. Ni-P/SiO2 was synthesized by incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) of an excess amount of a H3PO4 (2 equiv. to Ni) solution to Ni/SiO2 followed by heating at a rate of 5 °C min−1 to 600 °C in air (Scheme 1). AAS analysis of Ni-P/SiO2 confirmed that the Ni density on the surface remained at approximately 0.6 Ni nm−2.

Synthesis of SiO2-supported NiII catalysts.
As expected, Ni remained in the +2 oxidation state after thermal removal of the NH3 ligands at 300 °C, as confirmed by an X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) edge energy of 8342.1 eV and the pre-edge energy of 8333.1 eV. Ni2+ also remained in Ni-P/SiO2 with an edge energy of 8342.8 eV and a pre-edge energy of 8333.0 eV (Figure 1; see also Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). The 0.7 eV shift in the edge to higher energy is consistent with the introduction of the more electron-withdrawing phosphate ligand. The energies and calculated areas of the pre-edges for Ni reference compounds with Oh and Td coordination geometries and the catalysts are summarized in Table 1 (Table S1 and Figure S2). Square planar is very common for d8 NiII, which typically shows a very small pre-edge area (<2×10−2 eV) and a well-resolved strong 1s–4pz transition.12 However, it is not observed in the spectrum of either Ni/SiO2 or Ni-P/SiO2. The pre-edge area of NiO is 3.8×10−2 eV, which is consistent with its octahedral geometry, whereas the larger pre-edge areas of Ni/SiO2 and Ni-P/SiO2 of 4.2 and 5.6×10−2 eV are consistent with a tetrahedral geometry in which d–p mixing can occur to help increase the probability of the dipole-forbidden 1s–3d transition. Also consistent with the tetrahedral geometry, the pre-edge energies of Ni/SiO2 and Ni-P/SiO2 are very close to that of the tetrahedral reference compound Ni(PPh3)2Cl2 and are approximately 0.5 eV below that of octahedral NiO owing to the fact that the energy levels of the half-filled t2 orbitals in the tetrahedral geometry are lower than those of the eg orbitals in the octahedral geometry.

As shown in the extend X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra in Figure 1 b, the smaller Fourier transform (FT) magnitudes at approximately R=1.5 Å (phase uncorrected distance for Ni−O bonds) of Ni/SiO2 and Ni-P/SiO2 are consistent with the four-coordination Td geometry compared with the six-coordination geometry of NiO and Ni3(PO4)2. For the NiO spectrum, the second-shell peak at R≈2.6 Å corresponds to Ni–Ni scattering, whereas for Ni/SiO2, the signal at R≈2.7 Å corresponds to Si scattering from the SiO2 support, as suggested by wavelet analysis, which provides a correlation of the R and k-space data (Figure 2).13 For NiO, the Ni scattering features are centered at R≈2.6 Å and k≈7.0 Å−1, whereas for Ni/SiO2 the Si scattering paths produce features centered at R≈2.7 Å and k≈5.0 Å−1. No significant Ni–Ni scattering contribution is observed, which is consistent with the formation of well-dispersed NiII on the silica surface. An even smaller second-shell signal at R≈2.6 Å is observed in the spectrum of Ni-P/SiO2, and wavelet analysis suggests that the contribution is centered at k≈4 Å−1. Quick decay of the EXAFS signal at higher k suggests that the Si/P shell has higher structural disorder. Different from the Ni3(PO4)2 spectrum, no higher shell above R=3 Å is observed in the spectrum of Ni-P/SiO2, which is also consistent with high Ni dispersion.

Wavelet analysis of the XAS data with Morlet mother wavelet.
Bond lengths and coordination numbers were obtained by fitting the EXAFS data (Figure S3), and the results are summarized in Tables 2 and S2. For Ni/SiO2, 3.5±0.5 oxygen atoms were determined at R=2.03 Å in the first shell, and 4.4±0.9 Si atoms at R=3.24 Å were determined in the second shell. The best fit for Ni-P/SiO2 suggests a slightly shorter Ni−O average bond length at R=1.99 Å, which is consistent with the expected formation of stronger Ni−OP bonds. The fit of the second shell included both Si and P atoms, and an average distance of 3.18 Å was obtained. Note that the mean-square disorder of 0.010 Å2 is much higher than that in Ni/SiO2, which is consistent with the higher structural disorder suggested by wavelet analysis. Surface P−OH groups ( =3670 cm−1) were detected in the diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra, along with free silanol (Si−OH) groups ( =3745 cm−1), which is consistent with the proposed reaction between Ni-OSi and H3PO4 to generate Si−OH.14 The difference IR spectrum between Ni-P/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 is consistent with the presence of phosphate on the catalyst surface (Figures S4 and S5).15

The catalytic performances of Ni/SiO2 and Ni-P/SiO2 were investigated at 600 °C for the dehydrogenation of C3H8 (Figures 3, S6, and S7). High stability was observed with an initial conversion of approximately 18 %, and the conversion dropped to approximately 16 % after 3 h on stream. Another stability test was performed with the same C3H8 space velocity but by co-feeding H2, for which the reduction of NiII would be more likely to occur. Ni-P/SiO2 still showed high stability under the strong reducing conditions, and the conversion of C3H8 dropped from 14 to 12 % after 3 h on stream. On the contrary, Ni/SiO2 deactivated very fast and lost its activity in 30 min under the same reaction conditions. High C3H6 selectivity was also observed for Ni-P/SiO2, and the selectivity to C3H6 reached 90 % at 10 % C3H8 conversion, whereas only 60 % selectivity to C3H6 was observed for Ni/SiO2. At 5.5 % conversion without co-feeding H2, the turnover frequency (TOF) for the production of C3H6 on Ni-P/SiO2 was calculated as 2.9 h−1, which is similar to that reported for other SiO2-supported 3d and 4p single-site catalysts under similar reaction conditions.11, 16 In addition, Ni-P/SiO2 was also active for the propylene hydrogenation reaction, the microscopic reverse of the propane dehydrogenation reaction, at 200 °C with a TOF of 0.35 h−1. Although calcium–nickel phosphate was used for the dehydrogenation of n-butene and ethylbenzene, it was not active for the dehydrogenation of butane or propane,17 which suggested that a catalyst with Ni−OP bonds but no Ni−OSi bonds could only activate allyl and benzyl C−H bonds. For comparison, we synthesized a tetrahedral NiII catalyst with four Ni−OP bonds, Ni/P-SiO2, which was achieved by impregnation of an excess amount of H3PO4 on SiO2 prior to the adsorption of NiII ions (Figure S3, Tables S1 and S2). Ni/P-SiO2 was not active for the dehydrogenation of propane under the same reaction conditions. These results suggest that Ni−OSi bonds are crucial for activating alkane C−H bonds for dehydrogenation and H−H bonds for hydrogenation at low temperatures (e.g., 200 °C).

Results of the catalytic dehydrogenation of C3H8 at 600 °C: a) stability and b) selectivity (see the Supporting Information for experimental details).
To probe further the possible structural changes of the catalysts under the dehydrogenation conditions, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was performed for Ni/SiO2 and Ni-P/SiO2. No changes were observed in either the XANES or the EXAFS spectra of Ni-P/SiO2 after 1 h on stream, as shown in Figure 4; however, the formation of Ni0 nanoparticles was observed in the XANES and EXAFS spectra of Ni/SiO2, as expected. The introduction of a phosphate ligand to the SiO2-supported Ni catalyst successfully prevented the reduction of NiII during the dehydrogenation of C3H8 at 600 °C and, thus, achieved high stability and high selectivity to C3H6. To investigate further its stability against reduction, Ni-P/SiO2 was treated with H2 at 700 °C for 30 min. A shift in the edge to lower energy as well as a decrease in both the Ni−O and Ni−Si/P scattering peaks was observed (Figure 4 c, d); this suggested partial reduction of NiII, which is consistent with previous reports.18 A good linear combination fit (R factor=2×10−4) was obtained by using the XANES spectra of Ni2P and Ni-P/SiO2, which suggests 34 % of NiII was reduced to Ni2P, whereas the other 66 % remained as NiII.

The reaction of SiO2-supported NiII with H2 likely occurs following the mechanism shown in Scheme 2.11a, 16a–16d Heterolytic cleavage of the H−H and Ni−O bonds generates O−H and Ni−H bonds. Further Ni−O bond cleavage may occur in the presence of H2 or following O−H reductive elimination to generate Ni0 [Scheme 2, Eq. (1)]. The first Ni−OSi bond can be cleaved at approximately 200 °C, as suggested by the propylene hydrogenation reaction. Under the dehydrogenation conditions, all of the Ni−OSi bonds in Ni/SiO2 are cleaved, which generates Ni0. In Ni-P/SiO2, the Ni−OSi bonds are cleaved under the reaction conditions, but the Ni−OP bonds are more resistant to heterolytic cleavage [Scheme 2, Eq. (2)] and do not cleave. These results are consistent with our hypotheses that high stability and selectivity could be achieved by introducing a phosphate ligand to preclude NiII from undergoing reduction.

Reaction of SiO2-supported NiII catalysts with H2.
In summary, we designed and synthesized a silica-supported NiII phosphosilicate catalyst by employing a two-step process involving strong electrostatic adsorption of NiII followed by impregnation of a H3PO4 solution and thermolysis. Atomic absorption spectroscopy, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and IR spectroscopy analysis allowed assignment of highly dispersed Td NiII sites on the surface, which showed high stability and high selectivity to propylene at 600 °C owing to the presence of both NiII−OSi and NiII−OP bonds, for which the former activated the alkane C−H bonds and the latter precluded NiII from undergoing reduction under the reaction conditions. This study has thus opened new avenues to the rational design of highly stable and selective high-temperature dehydrogenation catalysts not previously possible.
