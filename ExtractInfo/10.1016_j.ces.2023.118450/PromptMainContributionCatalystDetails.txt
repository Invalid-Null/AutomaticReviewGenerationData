Abstract
Pt-based catalysts as one of the most used industrial catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis, it is essential for the on-purpose catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH). Here, the highly dispersed PtCe clusters are constructed by high-silica Beta zeolite as support to improve the catalytic stability and propylene selectivity in the PDH reaction. The defect sites derived from silanol nests are responsible for dispersing PtCe clusters inside the channels of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite, while the trace Al sites play an important role in further stabilizing the active site structure by regulating the metal-support interaction. The closely associated Pt and Ce species are critical to embody the outstanding catalytic activity (propane conversion of ∼42.2%, propylene selectivity of ∼91.9%) with excellent stability (deactivation constant: 0.013 h−1) at 550 °C. This work proposed an efficient strategy for designing stable PtCe bimetallic clusters by utilizing silanol nests and Al sites to regulate the metal-support interaction synergistically.

1. Introduction
The on-purpose propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as one promising way for the industrial-scale production of propylene has gained increasing attention in recent years, due to the heavy demand in the feedstock market for propylene (Chen et al., 2021, Monai et al., 2021, Qu and Sun, 2022, Wang et al., 2022). In this field, Pt catalysts have irreplaceable advantages such as efficient C–H bond activation rather than C–C bond, longer reactive longevity, and environmental friendliness (Dai et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2022, Nakaya et al., 2020). But solely Pt-supported catalysts easily agglomerate into large Pt particles, leading to rapid activity loss and low propylene selectivity as the result of metal sintering and coke poisoning on the active sites (Jesper et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2021). To alleviate these issues, one of the most effective way to inhibit carbonaceous formation is to construct bimetallic catalysts by introducing the second metal species for combining with the neighboring Pt sites (Motagamwala et al., 2021). However, the harsh PDH reaction conditions are still a great challenge to the thermal stability of the catalysts (Wu et al., 2021, Ren et al., 2022), mainly manifested as the sintering of the active metals.
The thermal stability of propane molecule dictates that the activation process of PDH requires tremendous energy (ΔHθ298 = 124.3 kJ·mol−1, 500–700 °C) (Dai et al., 2021, Jesper et al., 2014, Zhu et al., 2022). The harsh reaction conditions put forward a great requirement for catalyst performance. Therefore, it is important in terms of avoidance of adverse reactive pathways and structural design of the catalytic sites. Typically, the metal species supported on the substrates containing Al can provide a stronger metal-support interaction in comparison with pure siliceous supports (Dai et al., 2021, Zhu et al., 2021, Yu et al., 2020). But the surface exposed Al sites of Brönsted (B) acid sites are beneficial to the undesired side reactions (Gao et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2021). In other words, part of the Al sites play a role in stabilizing the active sites, whereas excess Al sites play the role of side-reaction sites that are detrimental to the selectivity. Moreover, the dispersion of active metal species also should be taken into consideration during the design of PDH catalysts. Lately, the bimetal-siliceous zeolite catalysts represent one of the most promising PDH catalysts for its unique pore structure, which is beneficial for achieving the high-dispersed active sites and tunable metal-support interaction (Zhang et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2021, Camacho-Bunquin et al., 2018). The typical way is to introduce the post-transition metal elements (e.g., Sn, Zn, Ga, In, Fe, etc.) for synthesizing co-catalysts (Li and Wang, 2021, Chen et al., 2021, Shi et al., 2015, Zhang et al., 2022). The emerging pre-transition metal elements (e.g., Ce, La, Y, etc.) as co-catalysts are also investigated due to their specific catalytic properties and a simple regeneration process (Park et al., 2021, Ryong Ryoo et al., 2020, Li et al., 2018, Zhu Chen et al., 2021), however the development is hindered by the fact of synthetic challenges. Specifically, the low chemical potential energy of the pre-transition metal oxides requires a high reduction temperature to enable alloy formation, as well as necessitating atomistic migration of rare-earth elements (REE) by the silanol nests inside the channels of the siliceous zeolite. To date, only limited quantity of strategies has been proposed to improve the dispersion of rare-earth species, in anticipation of reducing the reduction temperature via enhanced reduction potential energy. Ryoo et al. (Ryong Ryoo et al., 2020) develop a method for synthesis of the mesoporous Si-MFI zeolite topological structure rich in silanol nests through eliminating the framework Ga from Ga-MFI zeolite. The bonding forces between Si-OH groups and REE species are favorable to achieving atomic dispersed REE-MFI, it furtherly integrates with Pt species to produce alloy. Though the aimed catalyst shows excellent catalytic performance and stability for PDH, the role of minimum Ga remained in the framework still to be investigated. Moreover, the cumbersome post-synthesis steps weaken the structural stability of metal-zeolite catalysts (Xie et al., 2021). Hence, a combination of framework Al sites and silanol nests to synergistically regulate the metal-support interactions may be an efficient way to address the difficulties of synthesizing the Pt-REE nanoalloy catalysts.
Herein, we utilize high-silica BEA topology zeolites to construct a stable PtCe nanoalloy catalyst for PDH reaction. It reveals that the different catalytic performance is caused by the regulation of metal-support interactions between PtCe species and supports. The optimal 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst showed excellent catalytic performance because the well dispersed PtCe species formed stable structure of PtCe nanoalloys, which is attributed to the dense silanol nests and trace Al sites of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite. This study gives a guidance for the design of high-performance and stable high-silica bimetal-zeolite catalyst in PDH reaction.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Catalysts preparation
The low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio zeolite of H-type Beta (nominal SiO2/Al2O3 = 25, Nankai University Catalyst Co., Ltd., the actual SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is 39, denoted as Beta-39) was calcined at 550 °C for 12 h to completely remove the organic template agent before using. The middling SiO2/Al2O3 ratio zeolite of H-type Beta (nominal SiO2/Al2O3=(150, 250), Rao Dong New Material Co., Ltd., the actual SiO2/Al2O3 ratio are 145 and 200, denoted as Beta-145 and Beta-200). The high-silica Beta zeolite (Zhejiang Twrd New Material Co., Ltd., denoted as Beta-557) of actual SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is 557, the value is acquired from ICP-OES analysis. The pure-silica Beta (noted as Beta-∞) zeolites’ synthetic procedure involves the post-synthesis of the Beta-557 zeolites through the dealumination process. Typically, putting 5 g of high-silica Beta-557 with an actual SiO2/Al2O3 moral ratio of 557 into 100 mL of 13 M HNO3 (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) aqueous solution, and then stirring vigorously in an oil bath at 80 °C for two days. Finally, after washing with deionized water until neutral, the producing powers were placed in an oven at 80 °C overnight to dry and recorded as Beta-∞. Moreover, the synthesis of S-1 support was based on the protocol in the literature (Sun et al., 2020).
The PtCe-supported catalysts were synthesized by using Pt(NH3)4(NO3)2 (Pt, 50% basis, Sigma-Aldrich) and Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (AR, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) as Pt and Ce sources, then they were dissolved in appropriate amounts of deionized water and loaded on different supports by the co-impregnation method. The loading of Pt is nominally fixed at 0.5 wt%, while the nominal loadings of Ce are 0.5 wt%, 1.0 wt%, 2.0 wt%, and 4.0 wt%. The prepared samples were dried overnight in an oven at 80 °C and calcined in air at 400 °C for 2 h. The monometallic 0.5Pt/Beta-557 and 0.5Ce/ Beta-557 samples were also obtained using similar synthetic methods.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The data of the actual metal loading of the catalysts before and after the PDH reaction were obtained by iCAP 7000 instrumentation (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Powder XRD diffraction spectra were acquired using an Ultimate III diffractometer (Rigaku, Japan) with a scan rate of 10° per minute in the 2θ diffraction interval of 5 and 80° by employing Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). The TEM images of the catalysts were recorded with an FEI Talos F200S G2 transmission microscope (USA) at 200 kV. The elements' information was analyzed by an X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system. 29Si MAS NMR experiments were tested on a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer (JEOL ECZ600R, Japan）equipped with a 14.09 T superconducting magnet and a 3.2 mm double-resonance MAS probe (JEOL RESONANCE Inc., Japan). The infrared (IR) spectrum was performed on an IS-10 FT-IR spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher, USA). The X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) experiments were carried out on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα source conducted at 200 W and referenced to the Si 2p lines at 103.5 eV.
The H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and all the temperature-programmed desorption (C3H8-TPD, NH3-TPD, and C3H6-TPD) experiments were tested on an AutoChem II 2920 analyzer (Micromeritics, USA) with a TCD. For the H2-TPR experiments, the flowing He was first injected into the 0.2 g fresh samples at 400 °C for 0.5 h before reduction. After cooling down, the flowing gas was switched to 30 mL/min 10% H2/Ar and heated up with a ramp rate of 10 °C/min from 100 to 800 °C. In all the chemisorption experiments of C3H8-TPD, NH3-TPD, and C3H6-TPD. Firstly, 100 mg of each sample was reduced under inflowing 10% H2/Ar at 700 °C for 2 h and cooled down to 50 °C. Then, a constant of 30 mL/min 5% C3H8/Ar or 10% NH3/He or 5% C3H6/Ar flow gas was introduced into the reduced products to achieve saturation adsorption of C3H8 or NH3 or C3H6 for 0.5 h. Finally, after removing the physisorbed substances exposed to flowing He, the program process begins to ramp from 100 °C to the final temperature at 10 °C/min until complete desorption.
Dispersion of surface Pt sites was studied by applied CO pluse chemisorption method (Li et al., 2021) on a BELCAT-B analyzer (MicrotracBEL, Japan). For each test, 50 mg sample was reduced with 100 mL/min H2 at 700 °C for 1 h, then switched to 30 mL/min He and cooled down to 400 °C for 0.5 h. After cooled to 50 °C, CO was admitted to the sample by injection pulses of 10 vol% CO/He until the consumption peaks became stable.
DRIFTS-CO experiments were investigated on a Nicolet iS50 infrared spectroscopy (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). First, 20 mL/min of Ar flowing gas was introduced into the catalysts for 0.5 h at 300 °C. Second, as the temperature of the cell (Harrick Scientific Product) drops to room temperature, the collection of background spectra begins. Then, the gas switches to a mixture gas of 10% CO/Ar (20 mL/min) for reaching saturation adsorption of CO. Finally, beginning to collect the DRIFTS-CO spectrum under purging with Ar gas.
The TGA experiments of the samples were heated at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min to 800 °C in 30 mL/min flowing air. The coke deposition of the spent catalysts was taken on a thermal analyzer (Mettler Toledo, USA) and DXRxi Raman microscope with 532 nm laser wavelength (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA).
2.3. Catalyst testing
PDH catalytic activity tests were taken in an atmospheric pressure fixed bed reactor. 0.1 g of catalyst and 0.5 g of quartz sand with 40–60 mesh were mixed thoroughly and then filled into a 0.6 mm quartz tube with a thermocouple to the midpoint of the mixture. Typically, prior to testing, the catalyst was pre-reduced under 5.0% H2/Ar (20 mL/min) at 700 °C for 2 h, and then switched to Ar gas (20 mL/min) and cooled down. To begin testing the catalyst was purged with Ar for 1 h at 550 °C of 0.1 Mpa. The reactant feed is 2.5% C3H8 and 2.5% H2 for a total flow rate of 40 mL/min with balance Ar (Wu et al., 2021, Liu et al., 2016, Escorcia et al., 2020). All output compounds are detected using a Shimazu GC-2014 online chromatography (HP-AL/S column, 0. 53 mm i.d., 15 µm film, 50 m) equipped with one FID detector. The carbon balance (CB) is determined based on the ratio of the sum of the C moles in all outputs excluding coke to the sum of C moles in the feedstock of each catalytic test. The carbon balance (CB), conversion of propane (XC3H8), selectivity of propylene (SC3H6), propylene yield (YC3H6), specific activity, and deactivation constant (KD) (Dai et al., 2020, Rimaz et al., 2019) was calculated followed as:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis of highly dispersed PtCe cluster catalysts
The ICP-OES was used to determine the actual element contents of the synthesized materials. As presented in Table S1, the amounts of Al sites on the primitive Beta-39, Beta-145, Beta-200, Beta-557, and Beta-∞ zeolites are 1.913%, 0.543%, 0.408%, 0.143%, and 0.051% respectively, corresponding to the molar ratios of SiO2/Al2O3 in order of 39, 145, 200, 557, and 1431. Moreover, the Pt and Ce loadings of the PtCe-based zeolite catalysts are approaching nominal loading values.
The bulk phase structure of all fresh samples was investigated by the XRD. As shown in Fig. S1A, the typical characteristic diffraction peaks of the parent Beta-39, Beta-557 and Beta-∞ samples, identify the structure are well-crystalline BEA topology (Wang et al., 2022). For all the fresh PtCe-based catalysts (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1B), no diffraction peaks associated with Pt species or CeO2 are detected due to the high dispersion degree of the metal species. Furthermore, no peaks at 28.5, 33.1, 47.5, and 56.3° corresponded to the CeO2 phase (PDF#34–0394) could be observed with the increase of loaded Ce.

Fig. 1. XRD patterns of the fresh catalysts.
The dispersion of the PtCe particles on the fresh 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalysts was examined by TEM. As given in Fig. 2 and Fig. S2, no visible PtCe particles can be observed, presuming that maybe most of the metal species are highly dispersed at inside the channels of the zeolite. Combined with the EDS mapping and line scan results (Fig. 2C-D), the Pt and Ce species are uniform dispersed on the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst. In XPS spectra of the fresh 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst, the weak characteristic peaks of the Ce3+ and Ce4+ mixture exist in the Ce 3d spectra (Fig. S3). The absence of the corresponding Pt 4f signal in the XPS spectrum is since Pt species are mainly confined within the zeolite pores (Figs. S3-4). The Ce 3d peak disappeared after the reaction in the spent 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst, possibly because the surface Ce species alloyed with Pt and fell into the interior of the pore channels.

3.2. Catalytic performances among the PtCe-based catalysts in PDH
It is favorable to expose more catalytic sites on the catalyst surface via the strong metal-support interactions that readily existed between metal species and Al sites. Therefore, the Beta-39 with low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is used as support to load 0.5Pt0.5Ce for obtaining a highly dispersed PtCe-based catalyst. Although it exhibits high conversion of propane (71.1%) at initial state, it is accompanied by rapid deactivation (deactivation constant: 0.141 h−1) and relatively poor propylene selectivity of 81.2% (Fig. 3). This phenomenon indicates that it is difficult to anchor well-dispersed metal species by only relying on individual Al sites on the surface. The loss of Pt sites leads to a rapid decrease in catalytic activity. Thus, the Beta-39 with low SiO2/Al2O3 ratio is not suitable supports for applied in this reaction.

(A) Conversion of propane, (B) propylene yield, (C) specific activity, and (D) the deactivation constants and the average values of propylene selectivity. The detailed propylene selectivity, carbon balance, and linear fit of KD are summarized in Figs. S5-13. Test conditions: prior to testing, 0.1 g of catalyst was pre-reduced under 5.0% H2/Ar (20 mL/min) at 700 °C for 2 h, and then switched to Ar gas (20 mL/min) and cooled down. To begin testing the catalyst was purged with Ar for 1 h at 550 °C of 0.1 Mpa. Reactant feed: 2.5% C3H8 and 2.5% H2 for a total flow rate of 40 mL/min with balance Ar.
Surface-exposed Al sites are also recognized as side-reaction sites of cleavage and polymerization. Therefore, the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite with minimal Al sites are chosen for constructing the PtCe-based catalyst, it retaining the strong interaction between Al sites and metallic species. As shown in Fig. 3, the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst shows an excellent catalytic performance of 42.2% propane conversion and 91.9% propylene selectivity without obvious deactivation (deactivation constant: 0.013 h−1). It is worth noting that the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst can be regenerated for 140 h of PDH reaction by a simple oxygen calcination process, demonstrating it has superior regenerative performance. For comparison, the end yield of propylene of 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-39 catalyst is 33.0%, which is lower than that of the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst (end yield of propylene: 35.7%). Additionally, the catalyst stability of 0.5Pt/Beta-557 is poor, due to its rapid deactivation (deactivation constant: 0.103 h−1) (Fig. 3 and Fig. S14B). It could be inferred that the sintering of Pt sites occurs on the 0.5Pt/Beta-557 catalyst during catalytic process. While the 0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst shows inactive in PDH testing (Fig. S14C). These variations in PDH performances among the monometallic Pt/Ce and bimetallic PtCe catalysts illustrate that the generating of stable structure of PtCe bimetallic sites on 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst.
The above demonstrated that the introduced Ce species well changed the structure of the Pt sites. Thus, an appropriate increase of the amount of Ce might be beneficial for improving the dispersion of Pt sites. However, as presented in Fig. 3, the increasing of doped Ce plays an opposite effect, not only reducing the catalytic activity but also leading to faster deactivation. Based on the CO chemisorption experiments, it can be seen that the decrease in dispersion and exposed Pt surface area with the increase of Ce introduction (Fig. S15), implying that excessive Ce introduction may cover the surface Pt active sites, keeping a good alignment with the propane conversions of these catalysts. Thus, only the appropriate number of Ce can be helpful for forming an optimal structure of PtCe bimetallic sites, and this phenomenon is worth exploring further in the future.
The optimized 0.5Pt0.5Ce bimetallic composition was also supported on the dealuminated Beta-∞ and pure-silica S-1 zeolites to study the influence of Al sites on the catalytic performance. As a controlled catalyst of the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-∞ (Fig. 3), its PDH performance is unsatisfactory, exhibiting a fast deactivation (deactivation constant: 0.092 h−1) with low selectivity (propylene selectivity of ∼77.5%). For the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/S-1 catalyst (Fig. S14D), the initial propane conversion is 40.7%, which is close to that of the optimal 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst. However, its propylene selectivity is 70.9%, accompanied by apparent deactivation (deactivation constant: 0.028 h−1). As demonstrated by CO pulse experiments and TEM imaging (Figs. S16-17), the Pt dispersion of the pre-reduced 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-∞ catalyst is 32.5%, while that of the spent catalyst is 27.1%. This suggests that sintering occurs under reaction conditions, leading to an uneven distribution of PtCe particles on the catalyst surface, due to the weak metal-support interaction between PtCe particles and Beta-∞ support. To further prove the significance of proper amount of Al sites, the supplemented 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-(145, 200) catalysts with medium SiO2/Al2O3 ratios for contrast, as presented in Figs. S18-19. For 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-145, the initial propane conversion is ∼47.9%, and the selectivity is ∼78.4% with a deactivation constant of 0.098 h−1. In the case of 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-200, the initial propane conversion is ∼44.6%, while the propylene selectivity is ∼82.0% and with a rapid deactivation. Compared with 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-39 catalyst, the initial propane conversions of the both 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-(145, 200) catalysts decreased obviously, corresponding to the reduced number of surface Al sites. Their poor catalyst stabilities are associated with the agglomeration of active particles and can be supported by TEM (Figs. S20-21).
The catalyst regeneration is often served as an important indicator for assessing the nature of catalysts. From Fig. S22, despite the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst exhibits a very slow deactivation after suffering from 60 h of PDH reaction. But it is still worthwhile to regenerate the catalyst by a simple 5% O2-burning process. The catalyst after six regenerations by O2-burning process can be restored to a superior PDH activity (Fig. S23). It is also worth mentioning that the catalytic performance of 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 is superior to that of many Pt-based catalysts reported in the literature (Table S2).
3.3. Co-regulation of metal-support interactions
The structure evolutions of the surface groups on the zeolites are used to disclose the formation procedures of PtCe particles by FT-IR spectroscopy (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. S24, the bands at 3765 and 3675 cm−1 belonged to Al-OH groups, while the band at 3724 and 3600 cm−1 attributed to an isolated internal Si-OH group and bridging hydroxyls Si-OH-Al, respectively (Jean-Philippe Nogier et al., 2009, Dijkmans et al., 2015). For the Beta-(145, 200) zeolites, the bands at 3675 and 3511 cm−1 are associated with the surface Al-OH vibrations and dense silanol groups (Fig. S25), respectively. This result indicates that both Beta-(145, 200) zeolites are rich in surface Al species and silanol nests. Likewise, the FT-IR spectrum of the high-silica Beta-557 zeolite exhibits three kinds of hydroxyl stretching at ∼3511, ∼3675 and ∼3728 cm−1, at the same time as the dealuminated Beta-∞ zeolite is absence of the peak at ∼3675 cm−1. The two major bands at ∼3728 and ∼3511 cm−1 are related to the isolated internal Si-OH group and the hydrogen-bonded Si-OH groups of the silanol nests, respectively (Park et al., 2021, Xie et al., 2021, Yeh and Gorte, 2016, Zhu et al., 2017). The extra peak at ∼3675 cm−1 of the primitive Beta-557 is ascribed to the surface Al-OH vibrations (Cheng et al., 2019, Xu et al., 2019), according to the presence of minimum Al. Whereas the dealuminated Beta-∞ zeolite lacks the peak at ∼3675 cm−1, indicative of Al-OH vibrations, while the primitive Beta-557 exhibits this peak. This suggests that after the dealumination process with 13 M HNO3 aqueous solution for 48 h, the surface Al sites on Beta-∞ are likely to be completely eliminated, and most of the residual Al (0.051%) may not be accessible to PtCe particles, which is further supported by the trace acidity of Beta-∞ (Fig. S26). Notably, after introducing Pt species, the peak of the Al-OH groups at ∼3675 cm−1 on the 0.5Pt/Beta-557 catalyst is disappeared, indicating the solely Pt species are interacted with the Al sites in the form of the Al-O-Pt linkages. However, the intensity of the peaks at ∼3675 cm−1 significantly increase in the Ce species introduced catalysts of 0.5Ce/Beta-557 and 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557, which may ascribe to the Ce-OH species (Tang et al., 2019). Moreover, the intensity of ∼3511 cm−1 of the 0.5Ce/Beta-557 and 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalysts are decreased obviously, indicating the strong interaction between Ce species and silanol groups. It is reported that the abundant silanol nests inside the channels of the zeolites are beneficial for atomistic migration of Ce species and furtherly alloyed with Pt to generating of PtCe alloy (Park et al., 2021, Ryong Ryoo et al., 2020). To sum up, the interaction between PtCe and both silanol groups and Al sites is existed in 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst in comparison to Beta-39 and Beta-∞ supports.

Fig. 4. (A) FTIR spectra of prepared samples in hydroxyl stretching region and (B) 29Si MAS NMR spectra.
The 29Si MAS NMR spectroscopy analyses were applied to further verify the state of the metal species of the catalysts. As shown in Fig. 4B, the bands around −103.0 ppm are associated with the framework Si-OH groups (Si(OSi)3(OH), Q3) of defect sites (Xie et al., 2021, Zhu et al., 2017, Kim et al., 2017). The other three isotropic resonance bands at around −111.5, −113.0, and −115.7 ppm are assigned to framework Si(SiO)4 species (Q4) (Zhu et al., 2017, Kim et al., 2017, Zhang et al., 2021). Comparing 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst with the corresponding primitive Beta-557; it reveals that only a minor decrease in these intensity of the Q3 and Q4 as loaded with PtCe species owing to its low metal loading.
The resulting metal-support interactions between Pt/Ce and supports were investigated by H2-TPR, as depicted in Fig. 5. The TPR profile of 0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst exhibits one broad peak centered at ∼657 °C, corresponding to the reduction of lattice oxygen in CeO2 (Wang et al., 2016, Ma et al., 2014). As for 0.5Pt/Beta-557, a peak observed at ∼502 °C is attributed to the reduction of PtOx particles inside the channels, and which is interacted weakly with the support (Chen et al., 2019, Qiu et al., 2019, De Cola et al., 2006). However, there is no distinguishable reduction peak appearing in the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-39 and 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-∞ catalysts. As known that pre-transition metal elements (e.g., Ce, La, Y, etc.) have a low chemical potential energy (Park et al., 2021, Ryong Ryoo et al., 2020, Li et al., 2018, Zhu Chen et al., 2021), which makes them difficult to reduce. Therefore, the formation of PtCe alloys requires abundant silanol nests to assist in achieving highly dispersed Ce sites and thereby reducing its reduction temperature. Combining with the FT-IR and H2-TPR results suggest that Beta-(39 or ∞) zeolites have only single Al sites or silanol functional groups, which are not conducive to the formation of highly dispersed PtCe clusters, as supported by the subsequent TEM. As a result, the reduction temperature of larger Ce species is too high to be reduced. Additionally, the absence of reduction peaks in the H2-TPR curves (Fig. S27) for 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Al2O3 and 0.5Pt0.5Ce/S-1 can be attributed to their similar surface functional groups to those of 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-39 and 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-∞. Comparatively, the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 shows two H2 consumption peaks, where the first one at ∼485 °C is assigned to the reduction of Pt oxide, and the second one near ∼638 °C is ascribed to the reduction of CeO2, both may be jointly engaged into the formation of PtCe alloy. It is worth mentioning that the reduction positions of Pt and Ce species shifting down to lower temperatures are due to the highly dispersed Pt on the surface of CeO2, which commonly accelerating the reduction of Ce species. Meanwhile, the added Ce species can also lead to greater reducibility of Pt oxide, as the previous reported (Wang et al., 2022, Yu et al., 2006). Thus, the benign metal-support interactions of 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst leads to a decline of the mutual reduction temperatures of Pt and Ce species. In contrast, there is almost no detectable signal of H2 consumption over the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-(145, 200) catalysts, due to the high reduction temperature of the Ce particles (Fig. S28). These results highlight the importance of both the appropriate Al-OH sites and abundant silanol functional groups in synergistically regulating the metal-support interaction of the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst.

3.4. The discussion on the catalytic site structures
The structure of active metals of the spent catalysts was identified by TEM characterization. The spent 0.5Pt/Beta-557 catalyst is used to elucidate the role of added Ce species for improving Pt dispersion (Fig. 6A-C). It can be observed that the large Pt particles appear at the spent 0.5Pt/Beta-557, due to the aggregation of Pt particles under harsh conditions. The interplanar distance of 1.90 Å is classified as a metallic Pt (2 0 0) crystal facet (PDF#04-0802). Additionally, the PtCe particles of 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-39, 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-145, 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-200, and 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-∞ catalysts show a non-uniform distribution on the catalyst surface, but the particle size is decreased significantly, indicating the promoter of Ce could efficiently break the Pt-Pt bond (Fig. 6D-F and Fig. S17). As regards the spent 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst (Fig. 6 and Fig. S29), no evident particles could be observed at low magnifications of the TEM images. When magnifying the magnifications of TEM images, the shadowy but highly dispersed Pt/Ce metal species are seen on the spent 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst. Considering the particles are distributed on the inner pores, which undoubtedly increases the difficulty of the TEM analysis. However, such an apparent change of particle sizes on the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst before and after reaction, and in connection with the H2-TPR result of the spent 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst (Fig. S30), it can be speculated that Pt and Ce species have already formed an intimate interaction under reductive atmospheres and furtherly lead to the production of PtCe nanoalloy particles. To further clarify the morphology of PtCe particles, the spent 2.0Pt2.0Ce/Beta-557 catalyst is also used to investigate the structural relationship between Pt and Ce species (Figs. S31-34). Combined with the XPS results of Pt4f, it shows that the valence state of the Pt species on the spent 2.0Pt2.0Ce/Beta-557 catalyst is Pt0. The apparent shifts of 0.4 eV on the binding energies of Pt0 species of the both 2.0Pt2.0Ce/Beta-39 (72.0 eV) and 2.0Pt2.0Ce/Beta-557 (71.6 eV) catalysts indicate different metal-support interactions existed on them. Moreover, the about ∼2 nm PtCe clusters are uniformly dispersed on the surface of 2.0Pt2.0Ce/Beta-557 catalyst. The well-defined ∼2.20 Å lattice stripes may correspond to the (0 0 2) crystal plane of PtCe alloy (PDF#19–0295). The results of EDS mapping and line scan (Figs. S29, 34) imply that Pt and Ce species are closely located and highly homogeneous in spatial distribution. Furthermore, the distribution of PtCe clusters of 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst after six-regeneration still maintains a high dispersion as indicated by TEM (Figs. S35-36), demonstrating that PtCe species have the superb redispersion capability. For comparison, the significantly aggregating of Pt/Ce species existed on the spent 0.5Pt0.5Ce/S-1 catalyst, which shows that pure siliceous S-1 zeolite is difficult to anchor PtCe particles (Fig. S37). As indicated above, it can be deduced that the proper number of surface Al sites and an abundance of silanol nests are necessary for the formation of highly dispersed PtCe clusters. At the same time, the XRD patterns of the spent catalysts are similar to those before reaction (Fig. S38), indicating that the bulk structure of the catalysts has not changed macroscopically.

Accessibility of the active sites is studied by C3H8-TPD. As seen in Fig. 7, when Pt/Ce species are introduced, it is difficult to detect noticeable changes of the adsorption behaviors on the catalysts containing Al sites. The comparison with Beta-39, and Beta-557 zeolites reveals that the broad bands located at ∼184 °C are assigned to the adsorbed propane on Al sites of the supports, at the same time as the adsorption signal belonging to active sites may be too weak to be found. Furthermore, the desorbed peak of the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst is much weaker than that of the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-39 catalyst. In order to furtherly clarify the adsorption properties of the active sites for the reactant, the Beta-∞ zeolite without the influence of framework Al sites is designed to load the PtCe. As seen, there is no visible peak for the Beta-∞ zeolite. However, a weak and broad peak are shown on the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-∞ catalyst, which is ascribed to the propane adsorbed on the catalytic active sites. The semi-quantitative analysis of C3H8 uptake is shown in Table S3, the amounts of C3H8 uptake on the active sites is in the order of 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-39 (14.96 mmol/gcat.) > 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-∞ (10.68 mmol/gcat.) > 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 (4.90 mmol/gcat.), which is in good line with the propane conversions of them. Combined with the C3H8-TPD and TEM results, it can be inferred that the main signal of propane adsorption is the contribution of Al sites, which is responsible for the side reactions; Whereas only a small fraction of the adsorption signal belongs to catalytic sites with the different dispersions, which corresponds to the on-purpose catalytic conversion of propane to propylene.

To explore the influence of metal-support interactions on the structures of Pt catalytic sites, in situ DRIFT-CO using CO as a probe molecule was conducted for the adsorption on Pt site surfaces. As seen in Fig. 8A, the bands of 2065 and 2077 cm−1 are detected on the 0.5Pt/Beta-557 catalysts before and after pre-reduction, respectively. The shift of on-top bonded CO upon the Pt sites of the pre-reduced 0.5Pt/Beta-557 catalyst is attributed to the large and high coordinated Pt nanoparticles. As a comparison, the wavenumbers of linear adsorption of CO of 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-39 catalysts before and after pre-reduction are 2071 and 2074 cm−1 (Fig. 8), and the minor shift of the pre-reduced counterparts is due to the agglomeration Pt sites. Noteworthy, the weak peaks of the fresh and pre-reduced 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-39 catalysts are observed at 1940 cm−1, which are attributed to the CO bridge-bonded on the continuous Pt sites. Moreover, the linear adsorption bands of the fresh and pre-reduced 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-39 catalysts are accompanied by a faint shoulder peak appearing at 2120 cm−1, implying the presence of oxidized Pt species. According to the previous report that Pt oxide is not the active sites for PDH reaction, only the metallic Pt0 sites are responsible for the heterogeneous cleavage of C–H bonds (Zhou et al., 2020). In the case of both fresh and pre-reduced 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalysts, there is only one linear adsorption peak of CO, corresponding to the isolated Pt site. Furthermore, the linear CO adsorption of the dealuminated 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-∞ catalyst before reaction is consistent with that of the fresh 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557. However, for the pre-reduced 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-∞, a new CO linear adsorption peak is observed at 2047 cm−1. The evolution of CO linear adsorption on the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-∞ catalyst is associated to the changed metal-support interactions due to the lack of Al. Hence, the trace Al sites play an important role in regulating the electronic structure of the Pt catalytic sites.

3.5. The anti-coking capability of the catalysts
The surface acidic properties of the as-synthesized samples were analyzed by NH3-TPD, as displayed in Fig. 9. As a control, the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/S-1 catalyst has no detectable NH3 desorption signal (Fig. S39A), indicates the very low acidity of the pure siliceous S-1. While the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is also designed for illustrating the acidity generated by the framework Al sites. Two overlapping NH3 desorption peaks around 202 and 374 °C of the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/γ-Al2O3 catalyst are shown in Fig. S39A, which are attributed to weak acid sites and medium strong acid sites (Wang et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2020). Thus, two distinct desorption peaks appeared at 213 and 373 °C of H-type of the parent Beta-39 zeolite, which are corresponding to the weak and medium strong acid sites from the Al species (Fig. 9A) (Wu et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2019), respectively. After introducing Pt and Ce species to construct 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-39 catalyst, the whole amount of acid sites upon 213 and 373 °C of 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-39 (1.790 mmol NH3·gcat.-1) increases compared with Beta-39 (1.625 mmol NH3·gcat.-1) (Table S4). However, a weak NH3 molecules adsorption signal appears in the primitive Beta-557 (0.239 mmol NH3·gcat.-1), 0.5Pt/Beta-557 (0.200 mmol NH3·gcat.-1), 0.5Ce/Beta-557 (0.322 mmol NH3·gcat.-1), and 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 (0.335 mmol NH3·gcat.-1) (Table S4 and Fig. 9B). However, compared with the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557, hardly detectable NH3 adsorption of the Beta-∞ (0.048 mmol NH3·gcat.-1) and 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-∞ (0 mmol NH3·gcat.-1) after dealumination. This apparent difference in the acidity is due to the zeolite supports with different SiO2/Al2O3 ratios and the excessive Al sites usually accompanied by undesired side reactions for PDH. Moreover, the amount of surface acid sites on PtCe-based catalysts increases with the number of added Ce species (Fig. S39B and Table S4). The excessive Ce content leads to a stronger acidity, which may lead to the production of carbon deposition and present a rapid deactivation. Therefore, the extremely minimum acidity of the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst can well suppress carbonaceous formation.

The adsorption/desorption behavior of products upon the catalyst surface commonly plays a key factor in affecting selectivity and stability. Thus, the C3H6-TPD experiment was performed. As indicated in Fig. 10, two overlapping peaks at 196 and 273 °C are observed on the Beta-39 and 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-39. In the case of Beta-557, two broad propylene desorption signals are seen in the temperatures of 274 and 419 °C. In comparison with the dealuminated Beta-∞, there is no obvious propylene desorption signal. Thus, it can be deduced that the two peaks of Beta-557 are associated with the strong adsorption propylene on the different Al sites. Furthermore, as for the 0.5Pt/Beta-557 catalyst, the introduction of Pt attenuated the intensity of the desorption peak at 274 °C, and the second peak shifts down from 419 to 353 °C. However, the faint desorption signals are found in the 0.5Ce/Beta-557, 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557, and 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-∞ catalysts, suggesting that the surface Al sites of Beta-557 are covered by introduced Ce species, compared to the primitive Beta-557. In a nutshell, the introduced Pt/Ce species do not completely cover the Al sites of 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-39 catalyst (Table S5), and the exposed Al sites is responsible for the coke deposition and poor propylene selectivity. However, for the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst, the incorporation of metal species that can almost completely cover the strongly adsorbed propylene sites of Al sites on the surface of the Beta-557 support, which contribute to the low amount of carbon deposition, supported by the latter analysis of TGA and Raman.

To identify the capability against the coke deposition under realistic reaction conditions, the spent samples were conducted by TGA and Raman analysis. From Fig. S41A, a controlled experiment illustrates that the 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst exhibits slight loss curves, demonstrating that the minor Al sites do not result in severe carbonaceous formation. Comparatively, distinctly weight loss curve decreases appeared at the spent 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-39 catalyst, due to the exposed Al sites on the zeolite surface, which is adverse to the release of propylene. Furthermore, no stretching vibrations of the carbonaceous species associated with D and G bands are found in the Raman spectrum (Fig. S41B), implying that the amounts of the coke are too low to be detected. In summary, the metal-supported high-silica zeolite catalysts are beneficial to achieving high propylene selectivity and longer catalytic longevity.
4. Conclusion
A strategy for the synergistic modulation of metal-support interaction by the together utilization of appropriate Al and support-defect sites has been realizing to construct highly dispersed PtCe cluster catalysts for PDH reaction. The 0.5Pt0.5Ce/Beta-557 catalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance of 42.2% propane conversion and 91.9% propylene selectivity, as well as the robust structure of catalytic sites allow for a low deactivation constant of 0.013 h−1. In addition, the good redispersion of the pre-transition Ce element makes the catalyst maintain good catalytic activity after six regenerations of up to 140 h of reaction time. Because the defect sites on the surface of the high-silica Beta-557 are responsible for anchoring highly dispersed Ce sites, and furtherly alloying with neighboring Pt atoms to form stable PtCe alloys. On the other hand, the high dispersion of Al sites enhances the interaction between PtCe clusters and support. The metal-support modulation method provides a valuable reference for the construction of stable and regenerable pre-transition element alloy catalysts, at the same time as expanding the potential scope of PDH industrial catalysts.
