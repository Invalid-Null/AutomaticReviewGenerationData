Effect of La addition on catalytic performance of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation
Abstract
PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalysts with different amounts of lanthanum were prepared by sequential impregnation method, and characterized by XRD, nitrogen adsorption, NH3-TPD, FT-IR, TPR, H2-TPD, XPS and TPO techniques. It was found that the La species were well dispersed on the internal and external surfaces of ZSM-5 zeolite. With a little addition of La, the catalyst acidity decreased slightly and the active sites of the catalyst were stabilized, which resulted in the increased catalytic selectivity and stability. In PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst containing 1.4% La, the stability of catalyst reached the best state and the catalytic selectivity was at the maximum. The average yield of propene was about 35.2% over 80 h for the reaction of propane dehydrogenation at 590 °C. However, as the La content increased, the character of Pt active sites changed obviously and the amount of Lewis acid sites increased, which in consequence decreased the catalytic activity and selectivity. Results from XPS analysis indicated that the addition of La could inhibit the reduction of tin species. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments showed that suitable loading of La could prevent the catalyst from coking effectively, whereas the opposite effect was observed when the content of La was excess.

The addition of La can have obvious influence on catalytic performance of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. It is found that suitable content of La can improve the catalytic stability and selectivity to propene effectively. However, the opposite effect is observed when the loading of La is excessive. In order to discuss the possible reasons, the catalysts are characterized by several techniques and particular emphasis is focused on the changes of catalytic acidity and character of Pt active sites by the modification of La.
1. Introduction
Bimetallic platinum–tin catalysts are widely used in the process of propane dehydrogenation. It is known that the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of increasing importance because of the growing demand for propene [1], [2]. However, the deactivation of the catalyst due to coke formation is inevitable because of the rigorous reaction conditions [3]. Therefore, many efforts have been made to improve the catalytic selectivity to propene and the resistance to coke deactivation. It has reported that introducing a third metal is a feasible way to solve the problems [4], whereas the stability of this catalyst is still relatively poor. Recent studies have investigated the support effect on catalytic behavior of Pt–Sn catalysts for propane dehydrogenation, supports such as silicon nitrides, clinoptilolite zeolites and CIT-6 have been studied [5], [6], [7].
ZSM-5 zeolite is a member of crystalline microporous aluminosilicates with low aluminium content. Due to the specific framework structure and the low aluminium content ZSM-5 zeolite has special properties and is used widely in many important industrial processes like catalytic aromatization [8], hydroisomerization [9] and disproportionation [10]. On the other hand, there is growing interest in developing platinum-impregnated HZSM-5 zeolite for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. Grasselli et al. [11], [12] used 0.7 wt% Pt-Sn-ZSM-5 in catalytic dehydrogenation (DH) of light paraffins combined with selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) process and achieved a near-equilibrium propene yield of 25% at 550 °C. Our previous work [13], [14], [15], [16], [17] discussed the effect of promoter and reaction conditions on catalytic performance of PtSn/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and found that PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst with suitable amount of Na showed relatively high propane conversion and propene selectivity.
In order to further improve the catalytic property of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, changing the catalyst acidity and the character of Pt active sites is very important. As is well known, the role of lanthanides on alumina support can improve its thermal stability [18]. Moreover, the existences of lanthanides can strongly modify the TPR profiles of supported noble metals [19] and improve the Lewis acidity of alumina [20], thus affecting the catalytic properties of PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst obviously. Angel et al. [21] systematically studied the effect of lanthanum on catalytic properties of bimetallic PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts and pointed out that the catalytic performances of PtSn/γ-Al2O3–La catalysts were mainly depended on the preparation methods used. Li et al. [22] investigated PtSnLa/γ-Al2O3 catalysts prepared by Pt–Sn bimetal cluster and conventional impregnation for propane dehydrogenation and concluded that the catalytic stabilities were improved by introducing lanthanum into the above-mentioned catalysts. However, the dispersive status of La species on Pt–Sn catalysts supported on different carrier may result in the variant behaviors, which may affect on the catalytic performance significantly.
In the present study, PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalysts with different amounts of lanthanum were prepared and used for propane dehydrogenation. The catalysts were studied by several techniques, including XRD, nitrogen adsorption, NH3-TPD, IR spectrum of adsorbed pyridine, TPR, H2-TPD, XPS and TPO. Particular emphasis was focused on the changes of acidity and character of Pt active sites in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst by the modification of lanthanum. All the results were correlated with a corresponding catalytic reaction of propane dehydrogenation. This can provide us with important information to understand the effect of La addition on supported metallic catalyst.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalysts were prepared by sequential impregnation method. The powder H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 120) was impregnated in an aqueous solution of 0.123 M La(NO3)3 at 80 °C for 4 h to obtain 0, 0.7, 1.4, 2.1 and 2.9 wt% La, then dried at 80 °C for 3 h under air flow. Afterwards, the samples were impregnated at 80 °C for 4 h in solutions mixture of 0.033 M H2PtCl6, 0.153 M SnCl4 and 0.427 M NaCl. Finally the prepared catalysts were dried at 80 °C for 3 h. The nominal compositions of the each sample were 0.5 wt% for Pt, 1.0 wt% for Sn, and 1.0 wt% for Na, respectively.
To obtain larger and more resistant particles, the prepared samples were fully agglomerated with 5.0 wt% alumina during the process of pelletization. About the effect of alumina binder on catalytic property of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst has been reported elsewhere [13]. After totally dried, the catalysts were calcined at 500 °C for 4 h, then dechlorinated at 500 °C for 4 h in air containing steam and finally reduced under H2 at 500 °C for 8 h. Catalysts used during this investigation were abbreviated as PtSnNaLa(x)/ZSM-5, where x represented the amount of La in the catalyst (wt%).
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the different samples were obtained on a XD-3A X-ray powder diffractometer coupled to a copper anode tube. The Kα radiation was selected with a diffracted beam monochromator. An angular range 2θ from 5° to 40° was recorded using step scanning and long counting times to determine the positions of the ZSM-5 peaks.
N2-adsorption studies were used to examine the porous properties of each sample. The measurements were carried out on Micromeritics ASAP 2000 adsorptive and desorptive apparatus, and all the samples were pretreated in vacuum at 350 °C for 15 h before the measurement. The specific surface area was obtained using the BET method. The microporous volume was calculated from the t-plot method.
Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) optical emission spectrometry was used for the determination of the La content in each catalyst. The measurements were performed with a JA1100 inductively coupled plasma quantometer, and the sample was dissolved in a mixture of HF and HNO3 acids before the measurement.
Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements were carried out to determine the acid properties of zeolites by using ammonia as an adsorbate. About 0.15 g of sample was placed in a quartz reactor and saturated with ammonia at room temperature. TPD was carried out from 100 to 550 °C with a heating rate β of 10 °C min−1 and with helium (30 ml min−1) as the carrier gas.
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of adsorbed pyridine were recorded using a Nicolet-510P apparatus. The samples were pressed into thin wafers and placed in a Pyrex glass cell equipped with CaF2 windows. The samples were pretreated in situ at 300 °C for 1 h under vacuum (10−6 Torr) and then cooled to room temperature. Afterward, the pyridine was passed over the sample for 30 min and the pyridine adsorption spectra were recorded after desorption at 150 °C for 1 h.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was measured with the same apparatus as that of NH3-TPD. Prior to the TPR experiments, the catalysts were dried in flowing N2 at 400 °C for 1 h. 5% H2/N2 was used as the reducing gas at a flow rate of 40 ml min−1. The rate of temperature rise in the TPR experiment was 10 °C min−1 up to 650 °C.
Hydrogen TPD of the different samples was performed on the apparatus that described for TPR for 0.15 g of the sample placed in a quartz reactor. The catalyst was pre-reduced in flowing H2 at 500 °C for 1 h. When cooled to room temperature, desorptions were programmed at 10 °C min−1 to 700 °C in flowing N2.
X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurements were performed with ESCALB MK-II equipment of VG instruments (UK) using non-monochromatic Mg Kα 1253.6 radiation. All samples were reduced in situ under hydrogen at 500 °C for 1 h. Then the spectra were recorded at room temperature in a vacuum better than 5 × 10−9 mbar. The binding energy values of the XPS signals were calibrated by using the Si 2p peak at 102.9 eV as reference [23].
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) was measured with the apparatus as the same as H2-TPD. About 0.05 g of sample was placed in a quartz reactor at room temperature, then heated up to 700 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1 in a 5%O2/He mixture (30 ml min−1).
2.3. Catalytic reaction
Propane dehydrogenation was carried out in a conventional quartz tubular micro-reactor. The catalyst (mass 0.2 g) was placed into the center of the reactor. Reaction conditions were as follows: 590 °C for reaction temperature, 0.1 Mpa pressure, H2/C3 = 0.25 (molar ratio) and the propane weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) is 3.0 h−1. The reaction products were analyzed with an online GC-14C gas chromatography and the conversion of propane and selectivity of alkenes or alkanes were defined as follows:
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of catalysts
Fig. 1 shows the typical XRD patterns of the different samples. The similarity of the XRD patterns between the pure ZSM-5 and the different catalysts indicates that the original structure of ZSM-5 zeolite is not destroyed during the process of impregnation. According to the previous results [13], [14], [16], [17], the platinum species were well dispersed on the external surface of the catalyst and part of Na and Sn species could enter the main channels of ZSM-5 zeolite. Taking into account that the average diameter of La3+ (0.119 nm) is less than that of ZSM-5 pore mouth, it is reasonable that part of La3+ cations may enter the main channels of ZSM-5 zeolite during the process of impregnation. In comparison with the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 pattern, the intensities of peaks of PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 below 10° 2θ decrease as the La species loading increases. Generally, the low-angle XRD intensities in the pattern of ZSM-5 are sensitive to the presence of any species inside the channels [24]. Therefore, the decreases of peak intensity of low-angle in the pattern of PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 also imply the entrance of La species into the channels. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1, crystalline phases of lanthanum oxides are not detected in the different catalysts. This may indicate that some lanthanum oxides as small particles (in general, the particles smaller than 3 nm cannot be detected by XRD [24]) dispersed on the external surface of ZSM-5 zeolite, or even penetrated into the channels of ZSM-5 zeolite as much smaller species during the treatment.

The contents of La, BET surface areas and microporous volumes of parent PtSnNa/ZSM-5 and the PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 with different La loadings are presented in Table 1. It is obvious that the contents of La in all PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalysts reduce after the impregnation. While the BET surface areas and the microporous volumes of the PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalysts decrease as the La content increases. These results again imply that some La species may enter into the channels and the other La species are highly located on the external surface of ZSM-5 zeolite.

The loading of lanthanum on PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst can influence the catalyst acidity obviously. NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and NH3 uptake of the different catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 and summarized in Table 2, respectively. There are two peaks of ZSM-5 zeolite, one is low (about 240 °C, peak I), corresponding to the desorption of the adsorbed NH3 on weak acid sites [25] and the other is at high temperature (about 450 °C, peak II), corresponding to the desorption of the adsorbed NH3 on strong BrÖnsted acid sites [26], [27]. In a comparison, a distinct decrease of ammonia desorption at low temperature, and almost no ammonia desorption at high temperature are observed in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, indicating that the addition of sodium can neutralize the strong acid sites preferentially. When the content of La is in the range of 0.7–1.4 wt%, the acid amount of the catalysts decrease (Table 2), and the acid intensities of the weak acid center become weaker continuously for the ammonia desorption temperature moves towards the lower range. Similar effect was also observed by Sugi et al. [28] and they suggested that the role of La could reduce the support acidity. However, with the continuous addition of La (2.1%), an increase of the peak area is observed. Furthermore, this tendency becomes more apparent when the La loading is 2.9 wt% and some acid sites of moderate intensity appear, implying that the excessive addition of La increases the catalyst acidity obviously.

Pyridine adsorption IR spectroscopy is another powerful technique for measuring and distinguishing the acidic sites on a zeolite surface. Fig. 3 shows the pyridine adsorption behaviors of the different samples. Generally, the two bands at about 1450 and 1540 cm−1 are assigned to pyridine molecules adsorbed on Lewis acid sites and BrÖnsted acid sites, respectively. In addition, the absorption band at 1488 cm−1 is assigned to the absorption of pyridine on the both acid sites [14], [16], [19]. It is clear that ZSM-5 zeolite presents three pyridine absorption bands at about 1450, 1488 and 1540 cm−1, showing that Lewis acid sites and BrÖnsted acid sites are all presented. In the case of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, the intensity of Lewis acid sites decreases sharply and relatively no band at about 1540 cm−1 is observed, meaning that the promoter of sodium is in preference to neutralize the BrÖnsted acid sites. As for PtSnNaLa(0.7%)/ZSM-5 and PtSnNaLa(1.4%)/ZSM-5 catalysts, the intensities of Lewis acid sites decrease continuously. This may be due to the formation of some basic sites at the external surface of the ZSM-5 zeolite by the modification of La [29], [30]. However, the intensity of these acid sites is stronger in the spectrum when the content of La is 2.1 wt%, and this tendency becomes more evident for PtSnNaLa(2.9%)/ZSM-5 catalyst. These facts reveal that the excessive addition of La increase the amounts of Lewis acid sites obviously. The possible reason for this behavior may be due to the acidic properties of lanthanum ions. It should be noted that La3+ cations are also weak Lewis acid sites, which can interfere in density of these acid sites measurements, since at least some of the acid sites can be attributed to La3+. Meanwhile, the entrance of La species into the channels of zeolite ZSM-5 can interact with the bridging hydroxyl groups, thus decreasing the BrÖnsted acid sites of the catalysts [31]. Nevertheless, in our experiments, the amounts of BrÖnsted sites in the parent PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst are little, which induce the changes of these acid sites cannot be clearly observed. Obviously, the results of Pyridine adsorption are consistent with the findings of NH3-TPD.

The loading of La can have an obvious influence on the interactions between the metal and the carrier of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst. Hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) is an effective technique, which can provide information on the character of these interactions. Fig. 4 shows the H2-TPR profiles of the different samples before their reduction. It is clear that PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst presents a peak, whose maximum is placed at 250 °C, and also two other peaks at about 430 and 570 °C. Generally, the signal at 250 °C is ascribed to reduction of Pt species, whereas the high-temperature peaks represent reduction of Sn4+ to Sn2+ and Sn2+ to Sn0, respectively [14], [16], [17]. In the catalysts containing 0.7% and 1.4% La, no obvious changes in the shape of TPR profiles are observed. However, with the continuous addition of La (2.1%), the reduction peak area of Pt species increases. Concerning PtSnNaLa(2.9%)/ZSM-5 catalyst, this change tendency becomes more distinct and the peak temperature shifts towards the lower range obviously, indicating that the character of Pt has changed effectively and more amounts of Pt species have been reduced. According to the previous studies [21], lanthanum in successive impregnation (SI) catalyst could stabilize the platinum in an oxidation state, Pt2+, which in consequence increased the signal of hydrogen consumption for Pt species. At the same time, lanthanum possesses the effect of electron-pushing [32], which is advantageous to the density conglomeration of electronic charge on the surface of Pt, thus promoting the reduction of Pt species. Based on these findings, it can be presumed that the reduction of Sn species can be much easier with the excessive content of La. This is because in these cases, more amounts of hydrogen are consumed for the reduction of Pt and these gases have been activated, and they can be desorbed with the increase of temperature, which is favorable for the reduction of Sn species. That is to say, the existence of Pt can notably assist the reduction of tin species [33]. However, as shown in Fig. 4, no obvious changes in the reduction peak area and temperature of Sn species are observed, suggesting that the addition of La can inhibit the reduction of tin species. Similar phenomena were also observed by Li et al. [22].

It has been proposed that two kinds of active Pt species exist on the external surface of Pt based catalyst [34]. One dominates the low temperature H2 adsorption, while the other can adsorb more H2 at high temperature. Therefore, when the hydrogen adsorption is carried out from 500 °C to the room temperature, both of the two active Pt sites can adsorb the hydrogen so that the complete H2-TPD profile may be obtained.
As shown in Fig. 5, there are a hydrogen desorption peak at low temperature and some high temperature hydrogen desorption peaks for PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst. It is worthy noting that there is no obvious changes in the hydrogen desorption peak at low temperature when the loading of La is 0.7% and 1.4%, whereas the decrease of this desorption peak is found with the continuous addition of La. Based on the above TPR analysis, this can be ascribed to the change of Pt active sites, thus decreasing the amounts of adsorbed hydrogen. On the other hand, compared with the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, the addition of La (0.7%) increases the hydrogen desorption at high temperature. Moreover, this tendency becomes more apparent when the content of La is 1.4%. Generally speaking, the hydrogen desorption peaks at high temperature are usually thought to be spillover hydrogen and the M/A (M: the metallic active sites; A: the accepter of spillover hydrogen) interface is the most important one to influence this [15]. Accordingly, suitable content of La can strengthen the interfacial interactions between the metal and the support. In these circumstances, hydrogen can be dissociated to H atoms at the surface of Pt active sites and they may overflow to the surface of adjacent Pt oxides or the other Pt oxides that interact strongly with the carrier. In this way, the spillover hydrogen can promote the reduction of Pt oxides and the active sites of the catalyst can be stabilized, which is advantageous to the reaction. However, a decreased amount of hydrogen desorption is observed with higher La content (2.1%). Continuous addition of La (2.9%) makes this change tendency more distinct, demonstrating that the excessive addition of La weakens the interfacial interactions between the platinum and the carrier. This is because the catalysts with higher La loading diminish the character of Pt active sites, which results in the decreased amounts of dissociated H atoms. Consequently, the spillover hydrogen is suppressed to some extents.

Further characterization of our catalysts is carried out by XPS in order to obtain information about the oxidation state of the metal phase (Sn) on the surface. Fig. 6 shows the Sn3d XPS region for the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 (Fig. 6(1)) and PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 (Fig. 6(2) and (3) for 1.4% La and 2.9% La, respectively) catalysts and the measured binding energies of the Si2p, Al2p, Sn3d5/2 and La3d5/2 levels are summarized in Table 3 after deconvolution of the spectra.

It should first be noted that, in all spectra, the component at binding energies of 485.9, 486.1, and 486.2 eV for the catalysts modified with 0, 1.4, and 2.9% lanthanum, respectively, is associated with a reduced tin phase, either in the metallic (Sn0) or in the alloyed (SnPtx) state [35]. Obviously, this signal is shifted towards higher binding energies with the increase of La loading. The reason of this behaviour is that the amount of Pt2+ species increases at higher La content, thus promoting the transfer of electron from tin to platinum. On the other hand, two other signals can be observed at 487.6 and 488.6 binding energies for PtSnNa/ZSM-5 sample, corresponding to SnO and/or SnO2. Unfortunately, discrimination between SnO and SnO2 is not possible by means of the XPS studies alone [36]. Therefore, the only conclusion from these experiments is that most amount of tin exists exclusively in oxidized form. When the content of La is 1.4% (Fig. 6(2)), these two peaks are found at 487.5 and 488.7 eV binding energies, corresponding to oxidized tin (SnO and/or SnO2). From the data compiled in Table 3, the presence of Sn0 (27%) is slightly higher than that of PtSnNa/ZSM-5catalyst (25%), suggesting that most of the tin remains in the oxidized state. As for the spectra of PtSnNaLa(2.9%)/ZSM-5 catalyst (Fig. 6(3)), the peaks placed at 487.6 and 488.6 eV binding energies. From Table 3, it is clear that the proportion of these oxidized tin species (SnO and/or SnO2) changes little with increasing La loading from 0% to 2.9%, showing that an almost constant proportion of oxidized tin species in PtSnNaLa/ZSM-5 catalyst exists irrespective of La loadings. This fact suggests that the promoter of lanthanum plays as the role of anti-reducing agent and the possibility of Pt–Sn alloy formation is little in our experiments.
3.2. The performance of the catalysts
Fig. 7 shows the catalytic activities of the different catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane with H2 at 590 °C. Respect to PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, propane conversion decreases from 40.6% to 34.6% after reaction for 5 h. This is related to the coke produced during the reaction, which can cover the Pt active metal. In contrast to this, PtSnNaLa(0.7%)/ZSM-5 catalyst presents the higher initial reaction activity and stability. With the 1.4% addition of La, this tendency becomes more obvious and the final conversion is 37.2%. However, the opposite effect is observed with the increase of La loading. In the case of PtSnNaLa(2.9%)/ZSM-5 catalyst, the initial propane conversion drops to 39.9% and the activity decay is more important. Comparing with PtSnNaLa(1.4%)/ZSM-5 catalyst, the catalytic activity decreases about 15.2% after the reaction. These results indicate that the promoter of La can have obvious impact on the catalytic properties of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. To explain these, it should be noted that the catalysts are bifunctional and the two active centers of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 (the metal particle and the acid site) may work collaboratively [37]. In this way, an optimum ratio between the number of active sites and the number of acid sites should exist. As commented before, the active sites are stabilized from PtSnNa/ZSM-5 to PtSnNaLa(1.4%)/ZSM-5 catalysts and the catalytic acidity decreases slightly at the same time. Therefore, the initial matching between the metallic function and acid function of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst is improved. From Fig. 7, It is clear that the PtSnNaLa(1.4%)/ZSM-5 catalyst possesses the best ratio between the number of active sites and the number of acid sites. However, with the continuous addition of La, the character of Pt active sites has changed obviously. In these cases, the surface of ZSM-5 zeolite may be covered by La2O3 layer. As a result, the multiple interactions between Pt, SnOx and La2O3 can coexist and the catalytic performance can be affected certainly because these interactions between the three components are considered to be responsible for the stabilization of Pt in its oxidized state [20]. In other words, more amounts of Pt can be stabilized in Pt2+ state with the excess addition of La, which diminishes the character of Pt active sites, and simultaneously the increase of catalyst acidity is inevitable due to the acidic properties of lanthanum ions (Fig. 3). Therefore, the initial matching between the metallic function and acid function in PtSnNaLa(1.4%)/ZSM-5 catalyst would be destroyed effectively, which is disadvantageous to the reaction. Meanwhile, the decrease of the BET surface area can also significantly affect the catalytic behavior in the dehydrogenation of propane.

The corresponding propene selectivitiy of the different samples is shown in Fig. 8. It is clear that the selectivities to propene increase gradually with the time on stream. Obviously, this is also related to the formed coke, which can synchronously suppress the side reactions to be carried out. Suitable addition of La results in the obvious increase of the selectivity to propene, which reaches a maximum when the content of La is 1.4%. However, an obvious decrease of the selectivity to propene is observed with the continuous addition of La. For PtSnNaLa(2.9%)/ZSM-5 catalyst, this value is even lower and reaches 95.7% after reaction for 5 h. These findings suggest that the suitable content of La in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst would be favorable for the production of propene.

To explain these, it should be noted that on PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst platinum is the only active metal and propene is only formed on the metal by dehydrogenation, the main cracking product (ethene) is mainly formed from cracking on the carrier and the ethane is formed by hydrogenolysis of propane and by hydrogenation of ethene, with both reactions taking place on the metal [38]. Furthermore, on HMFI zeolite the dehydrogenation and cracking of propane are assumed to proceed through carbonium-ion intermediates [39]. The higher acid sites generally promote the subsequent cracking reaction of the initially formed C3+carbenium ions. Therefore, the changes of catalytic acidity and Pt active sites are responsible for the selectivity to propene. Little addition of La decreases the acid amount of the catalyst, inhibiting the side reactions to be carried out, so that the selectivity to propene increases. On PtSnNaLa(1.4%)/ZSM-5 catalyst, this phenomenon becomes more apparent. However, with the continuous addition of La, the acid amount of the catalyst increases and the character of metallic function changes. Hence, the amount of produced propene decreases and side reactions can be carried out relatively easily. Thus, the decrease of propene selectivity is inevitable.
To further assess the performance of PtSnNaLa(1.4%)/ZSM-5 catalyst, a comparison with the parent PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst by using a recycle reaction is made. As shown in Fig. 9, it is clear that the initial propane conversions increase after catalyst regeneration. However, propane conversions decrease with the process time. It is interesting to note that the deactivation rate of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst is much faster than that of the PtSnNaLa(1.4%)/ZSM-5 catalyst with the increase of recycle number. In the fifth cycle reaction, the propane conversion decreases about 16.8% in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst in contrast to that of the fresh one after reaction for 5 h. While, the corresponding propane conversion decreases only about 6.3% in PtSnNaLa(1.4%)/ZSM-5 catalyst, indicating that the remarkable stability of dehydrogenation in recycle reaction is obtained over PtSnNaLa(1.4%)/ZSM-5 catalyst. Yu et al. [40] investigated the effect of Ce addition on Pt–Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation and obtained the similar results.

Regeneration conditions: catalyst regeneration was performed by oxidative treatment using pure air (40 ml min−1) for 2 h at 500 °C. Then, the catalyst was reduced in flowing pure hydrogen (40 ml min−1) for 4 h at 500 °C. (1) Fresh; (2) first cycle; (3) second cycle; (4) third cycle; (5) fourth cycle.
A stability test of the PtSnNaLa(1.4%)/ZSM-5 catalyst is also carried out. The propane conversion and the selectivity to propene as a function of the reaction time are shown in Fig. 10. The selectivity to propene increases relatively quickly in the initial period and then becomes smooth, a high value (97.4%) is obtained in the overall process. On the other hand, only a small deactivation rate is observed in the overall process. The mean yield of propene is about 35.2% during the course of the reaction for 80 h. According to our previous work [15], the capacity of ZSM-5 supported catalyst to accommodate the coke is much better than the catalyst that supported on γ-Al2O3, thus improving the catalytic stability. The possible reason may attribute to the larger surface area and the particular character of channels of ZSM-5 zeolite.

3.3. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) analysis
As mentioned before, in our experiments platinum particles disperse highly on the external surface of the catalyst, and the carbon deposits produced during the reaction can cover the active metal, which is the main reason of the catalyst deactivation. After the reaction, the temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) profiles of the corresponding catalysts are shown in Fig. 11. It can be seen that two successive peaks representing two different carbon deposits are displayed in TPO profile. Generally, the carbon deposits corresponding to the first peak at low temperature are mainly the ones that cover the active metal, while the second peak at high temperature represents the ones that located on the external surface of ZSM-5 zeolite [13].

From Fig. 11, it is clear that for PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, most of carbon deposits cover the active metal and a small proportion of carbon deposits cover the external surface of the carrier. Concerning PtSnNaLa(0.7%)/ZSM-5 and PtSnNaLa(1.4%)/ZSM-5 catalysts, the amounts of coke that cover the active metal decrease effectively, which is advantageous for the reactant gas to contact the active sites, thus improving the catalytic stability. Meanwhile, the disappearance of the coke at high temperature suggests that the synergic effect of sodium and lanthanum can totally inhibit the coke formation on the carrier. However, when the content of La is 2.1%, an obvious increase of coke locating on the surface of active metal is found. Furthermore, this tendency becomes more apparent at the higher La loading (2.9%), which decreases the catalytic stability significantly (Fig. 7). Following Afonso et al. [41], the coke formation on the catalyst involves several processes: (1) successive dehydrogenation/cyclization of alkyl chains; (2) n-alkane oligomerization; (3) Diels–Alder type reactions. Olefins are primary precursors of the mechanism of coke formation. The intrinsic acidity of the support can promote the undesirable reactions such as cracking/isomerization, thus increasing the carbon deposits. As analysis above, when the content of La is in the range of 0.7–1.4%, the catalyst acidity decreases continuously and the interfacial interactions between the metal and the support are strengthened, which results in the decreased amounts of coke and the enhanced reaction stability. It is well established that both the factors point to the support and particularly the Pt-support interface as an important factor in determining the stability of the supported Pt catalysts [33]. However, with the continuous addition of La, the catalytic acidity increases, especially for PtSnNaLa(2.9%)/ZSM-5 catalyst. Therefore, the amounts of coke increase, even though the character of metallic Pt has been changed. Any way, in these circumstances the main factor to influence the coke formation is the acid amounts of the catalyst.
4. Conclusions
The addition of La has obvious impact on catalytic performance of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. La species are well dispersed on the internal and external surfaces of ZSM-5 zeolite. When the content of La in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst is low (0.7% and 1.4%), the catalyst acidity decreases slightly and the active sites can be stabilized, thus improving the initial matching between the metallic function and acid function in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst, which is advantageous to the reaction. Among these catalysts, PtSnNaLa(1.4%)/ZSM-5 catalyst posses the best stability and selectivity. The mean yield of propene is about 35.2% over 80 h for the reaction of propane dehydrogenation.
However, at high La contents, the “metallic” character of Pt is diminished and the catalyst acidity increases evidently, which destroy the previous matching in PtSnNaLa(1.4%)/ZSM-5 catalyst. Consequently, the decreased catalytic activities and selectivities are observed. Results of XPS show that the addition of La can inhibit the reduction of tin species in the catalysts. Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) experiments show that suitable content of La can prevent the catalyst from coking effectively, whereas the amounts of coke increase with the excessive loading of La. In summary, suitable addition of La in PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst is favorable for the dehydrogenation of propane, whereas the opposite effect is existed when the content of La is excess.
