Tuning partially charged Ptδ+ of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts toward superior propane dehydrogenation performance†
An experimentally obtained volcano-type curve is observed for propane dehydrogenation over a group of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts on various supports. The oxidation state of Ptδ+ active sites via charge transfer with supports plays a determining role in enhancing the activity.
With the growing consumption of fossil fuel, traditional propylene production technologies, e.g., steam cracking of naphtha and fluid catalytic cracking, cannot meet the demands for propylene. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) as a highly efficient propylene production technology has been widely commercialized.1–3 Supported Pt-based catalysts are the most commonly used catalysts in industrial PDH processes due to their outstanding affinity for paraffinic C–H bonds. However, these commercialized Pt-based catalysts still suffer from their high prices and coking problems.4,5 For future development of catalysts with higher performance, several fundamental issues need to be addressed, e.g. the optimal geometric and electronic structures for catalyzing PDH, the relationship between the catalytic performance and the structural properties, the mechanism of main and side reactions, etc.3,6,7
Recently, single-atom catalysts (SACs) have become a frontier in heterogeneous catalysis and exhibit novel catalytic performance.3,8,9 For Pt-based dehydrogenation catalysts, SACs could maximize the Pt atom utilization efficiency and increase the selectivity mainly due to their unique geometric effects.10–15 Although SACs seem to have a very simple structure, the local coordination environments of the active metals are actually very complex, which, in turn, will change their electronic state and catalytic performance.16,17 The electronic effect induced by the dopants on supports is important as a new electronic state become available in the large band gaps, which may be involved in charge-transfer processes for promoting catalysis.18,19 A systematic study of fine-tuning the electronic properties of supported single metal atoms is highly desired for tailoring SAC catalytic performance.
Here, a group of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts was fabricated on different supports such as activated carbon (AC), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), silica-based support G-6, TiO2, and CeO2. Using different supports is an effective method to tailor the electronic state via the charge transfer between the atomically dispersed Pt catalysts and various supports as ligands. Because of the simplicity of the SAC geometric structure, the structural property–performance relationship was established by correlating their catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation with the oxidation state of Ptδ+.
Table S1† shows the detailed physical properties of the prepared samples. The BET surface areas, average pore diameters, and pore volumes of the catalysts are distributed in the range of 16.8–1397 m2 g−1, 3.2–42.9 nm, and 0.03–1.35 cm3 g−1, respectively. Despite the great differences in the textural properties, it can be noted that the physical properties of the supports have a negligible effect on the dispersion of particles due to the low loading of Pt. The Pt dispersion of the five catalysts is estimated to be >99% by CO chemisorption characterization, which shows that Pt particles are highly dispersed on all supports, similar to our previously reported atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 catalyst.12
As shown in Fig. 1, the intuitive structures of the five freshly reduced Pt catalysts were determined by using HAADF-STEM. At low magnification, the images show the morphologies of different supports, and no nano-sized Pt particles is observed. In the images at high magnification, the catalysts are observed to show a large number of single Pt atoms on the five support substrates, which are indicated by the yellow circles in the figures.

Infrared spectroscopy for CO adsorption is another powerful characterization method to accurately identify atomically dispersed Pt particles from the nanoparticles and to determine the number of metal 5d electronic states. As shown in Fig. 2(a), the CO-DRIFTS spectra only have a high-frequency band at 2094, 2096, and 2100 cm−1 on Pt/G-6, Pt/TiO2, and Pt/CeO2, respectively, corresponding to the linearly bonded CO on single Ptδ+ ions, originating from the coordination of single-atom Pt with O atoms on the surface of supports.9,12 The band of the bridged CO species adsorbed on neighbouring Pt atoms at lower frequencies (∼1830 cm−1) is not present in all oxide-supported catalysts. This again suggests that no detectable Pt nanoparticles exist on the samples, which is consistent with the CO chemisorption and HAADF-STEM results. It should be noted that a blue shift from 2090 to 2100 cm−1 can be observed for these three samples. The increasing frequency of the CO peak on the Pt species suggests that the atomically dispersed Pt atoms have a small number of 5d electronic states which weaken the Pt(5d)–CO(2π*) bonding through π back-donation, reflecting more obvious charge transfer from the atomically dispersed Pt particles to supports.20 However, performing CO-DRIFTS on carbon-supported catalysts is challenging due to the strong light absorption of the carbon supports.

XPS measurements of the five freshly reduced catalysts were performed to directly probe the electronic properties of the supported Pt atoms. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the Pt 4f spectra exhibit two clear doublets from the spin–orbital splitting of the 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 states.21 The Pt 4f spectra were deconvoluted using a non-linear least-squares algorithm with a Shirley baseline and a Gaussian–Lorentzian combination, and the relative distributions of the Pt species over the five catalysts are summarized in Table S2.† The Pt 4f7/2 BE shifted towards higher values, and the proportion of the high-valence Pt4+ species gradually increased, implying a gradually increasing Pt normalized oxidation state, in the order Pt/AC, Pt/CNTs, Pt/G-6, Pt/TiO2, and Pt/CeO2 catalysts.22 Zhu et al. reported that the charge carried by the O ion (qO) has a good linear scaling relationship with the charge carried by the single metal ion (qM) at the M1–O site, where electron transfer occurs between single metal atoms and neighbouring O atoms.23 The O 1s core-level XPS spectra of oxide-supported catalysts are shown in Fig. 2(c). Clearly, with the increasing valence of Pt, a shift of the O 1s binding energy toward lower values occurred, indicating that Pt atoms carry more positive charges through electron transfer between the metal and the neighbouring O atoms owing to the enhanced metal–support interaction. The oxidation state of atomically dispersed Pt particles on Pt/CeO2 is the most positive. Those data agree excellently with the CO-DRIFTS results, which show that the electronic configurations of atomically dispersed Pt species are adjustable using the different local environments of the dispersed metals with the surrounding donor atoms from the support.
Propane dehydrogenation was carried out to estimate the catalytic performance of the five freshly reduced Pt catalysts. It should be noted that all blank supports have no activity (Fig. S1†). The catalytic performance with the time of stream is shown in Fig. S2.† The catalytic performance of atomically dispersed Pt catalysts as a function of the normalized oxidation state of Ptδ+ is plotted in Fig. 3(a). The TOF, propylene selectivity, and stability index show a volcano-type dependence with the normalized oxidation state of Ptδ+. Similar trends are also observed in the catalytic performance as the function of a peak shift of Pt2+ and Pt4+ (Fig. S3†). For all the above curves, the atomically dispersed Pt/G-6 catalyst has the highest activity, propene selectivity, and stability for propane conversion, located closer to the top of the curve, where the TOF and selectivity are 5.34 s−1 and 99.2%, respectively. Compared with the previously reported atomically dispersed 0.1% Pt/Al2O3 catalyst (4.08 s−1), the reactivity of Pt/G-6 was further improved and approximately 10-fold higher.12

The stability index (Φt) is defined as the ratio of the final conversion (Xt) to the initial conversion (X0). (b) The long-term test of the Pt/G-6 catalyst.
According to our previous work, positively charged platinum centers, Ptδ+, favor the preferential adsorption of propane, weaken propylene adsorption, and prevent its deep dehydrogenation, which enhance the activity and selectivity.12 Zhao et al. also reported similar results that the single Pt atom having the most positive charges by transferring charge to the support is the most active for C–H bond activation in PDH.24
However, when the oxidation state of Ptδ+ further increases, the TOF starts to decrease. The average Pt oxidation state on the Pt/TiO2 and Pt/CeO2 catalysts are too high, which may also end up with gradually inert catalytic centers for reactions owing to stronger metal–support interaction.25,26
In addition, Zhu et al. proposed that the Pt–O sites were identified as the active sites for dehydrogenation, instead of the Pt1 atom. The adsorption energies of H on top of the O ion (ΔEH@O) could be calculated to evaluate the O reactivity and used as a reactivity descriptor.23 This study showed that the reactivity of the O ion was enhanced with a decreased number of electrons, and the TOF for PDH exhibited a volcano-type curve with increasing binding strength of H to the O ion, which indicates that too strong H bonding makes the adsorbed H the rate-controlling intermediate, resulting in a negative effect on the PDH rate. Considering that most dispersed metal atoms on oxide-supported SACs are coordinated by the neighbouring oxygen anions in the form of Pt–O, the electronic structure of the Pt atoms is determined by the electron density of O via a charge-transfer mechanism. Herein, the neighbouring O atoms become more electron-abundant with the increasing oxidation state of Ptδ+, resulting in poor reactivity. These results imply that, besides the dominant electronic effect of the active metal, the local environment provided by the support itself might also influence the activity to a certain extent. Therefore, a moderate oxidation state of Ptδ+ existing in a suitable local coordination environment is the key to prepare SACs with high reactivity and selectivity. The atomically dispersed Pt/G-6 with the optimal positively charged Ptδ+ exhibits an increasingly excellent TOF, as well as a higher propylene selectivity, which ensures a decent reaction rate whilst allowing the favorable desorption of the reaction of intermediate species.8
As shown in Fig. 3(a), all five catalysts exhibit superior selectivity to propylene (>93%), which is a unique property of the atomically dispersed Pt catalysts in PDH.12 It was reported that the selectivity to propylene over nano-sized monometallic Pt is usually under 80%.5 When Pt particle achieves atomic-level dispersion, the absence of Pt–Pt sites can effectively inhibit some undesired side reactions (e.g., C–C breaking) which require the combination of multiple Pt sites, improving the propylene selectivity. Therefore, the possible adverse effect of strong adsorption of propylene on more positively charged Pt sites is eliminated by the geometric effects of SACs. This strategy has also been successfully utilized on some single-atom alloy catalysts to improve propylene selectivity.6,13 Other than the properties of the active metal, the properties of the catalyst carrier also influence the propylene selectivity for PDH reaction. It is well known that the acidity of the oxide support can catalyze secondary reactions of PDH, such as isomerization, cyclization and hydrocracking reactions, and deteriorate propylene selectivity.5 Earlier, Yoon and co-workers reported that NM − 2δM values can serve as a scale for surface acidities.27 This method has been adopted here to calculate the acidity of oxide supports (detailed information in Table S3†). The results show that the selectivity decreases with an increase of support acidity (Fig. S4†), (Table S4†) clearly showing the influence of the surface acidity on the propylene selectivity. Meanwhile, when decreasing the selectivity, the stability of the catalysts also decreases, possibly due to the formation of more carbon deposits on the catalyst surface.
The SACs are hard to stabilize owing to the high surface free energy of the small particle size. Increasing the interaction between the metal and the support is an effective method to develop stable catalysts and prevent atoms from aggregation. Analysis of the five spent catalysts by HAADF-STEM (Fig. S4†) reveals that Pt/G-6, Pt/TiO2, and Pt/CeO2 have no visible Pt aggregation, which verifies that the supported Pt still remains highly dispersed after the reaction. However, pronounced Pt nanoparticles can be observed in the spent Pt/AC and Pt/CNT. For carbon-based materials, π bonds readily serve as π-coordinating sites interacting with metals.28 However, the π–d orbital interaction on the surface of the carbon-based supports is usually not strong enough under harsh catalytic conditions, especially at an extremely high temperature for PDH, easily leading to the formation of small metal nanoparticles.29 This result shows that metal atoms are much less stable on “weak” supports like carbon than on “strong” supports like TiO2 and CeO2. Therefore, Pt/AC and Pt/CNT have the lowest stable index (Fig. 3(a)).
Further, the long-term test was carried out on the Pt/G-6 catalyst (Fig. 3(b)), which shows good activity and stability without an obvious decrease after the 40 h reaction, while an excellent propylene selectivity (>99%) is retained during the test. The amount of deposited coke was quantitatively determined by TG in oxygen and nitrogen atmospheres, respectively. The discrepancy of the weight loss in the O2 and N2 atmospheres is due to the nonvolatile pregraphite-like carbon, which can be easily gasified in O2 rather than in N2, as previously reported.30 Compared with the atomically dispersed Pt/Al2O3 (ca. 1.5 wt% coke amount), Fig. S5† shows that the coke amount of the spent Pt/G-6 catalyst is further reduced to 0.63 wt%. And the difference in the weight loss between O2 and N2 is negligible, implying a lower graphitization degree of the accumulated coke, which is consistent with the properties of the atomically dispersed catalyst.12 The multiple Pt–Pt sites existing in Pt-based catalysts are known to be active for deep dehydrogenation of propylene, cracking, and the subsequent secondary reaction of the coke (e.g., isomerization, cyclization, etc.).31 The selectivity and stability of the catalyst depend on whether the product propylene directly desorbs or undergoes these undesired side reactions. When Pt particles achieve atomic-level dispersion, the multiple Pt–Pt sites basically disappear, and the relatively separate Pt atoms can effectively inhibit these undesired side reactions.5 Therefore, the propene selectivity increases, and the coking rate decreases. These results unambiguously show that the distinct electronic properties of Pt due to the different local coordination environments tuned by the supports play a vital role in achieving a remarkably high activity and stability.
In summary, a relationship between the catalytic performance and electronic properties of Pt active sites was established in terms of the oxidation state of Ptδ+ by using atomically dispersed Pt catalysts on various supports in PDH. Based on the change of the local environment of atoms, remarkably high catalytic activity and propylene selectivity were achieved by tuning the oxidation state of Ptδ+via charge transfer. This work provides new opportunities for the rational design of atomically dispersed Pt-based catalysts by controlling the electronic properties of supported active metal sites.
