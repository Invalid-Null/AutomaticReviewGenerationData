Recent Progress in Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Alkane (C2–C4) to Alkenes in a Fluidized Bed Reactor Under Mixed Metallic Oxide Catalyst
Short-chain olefins are the important feedstock for the chemical industries. The selection of a proper catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reaction is critical. Here, the study summarized different catalysts by physicochemical techniques such as BET surface area, Raman spectroscopy, and temperature programmed reduction (TPR). The BET analysis of different catalysts gives an optimum value of active and metal loading catalysts for optimum alkenes selectivity. From different Raman spectroscopy analyses, the study pointed out the factor responsible for varying mono vanadate and poly vanadate formation. From TPR analysis of different catalysts, this study pointed out the factors that varied on increasing or decreasing temperature and the effect on the selectivity of alkenes. The effect of different operating conditions was studied. Without catalyst regeneration after each ODH run, the catalyst under the study shows stable behavior and increases the selectivity of the desired product. The CREC riser simulator was used for ODH of propane and ethane, while two zones of fluidized bed reactor (TZFBR) and ICFBR reactors were used for ODH of butane. From the study of MoO3/MgO catalyst, it was observed that TZFBR have high selectivity of butadiene than CFBR and fixed bed reactor. It was concluded that the catalyst VOx–Nb/La-ɣAl2O3 has high conversion (20.1%) of ethane and good selectivity of (85.7%) of ethylene, while in ODH of propane and butane the catalyst 7.5 VOx/ɣAl2O3·ZrO2 (1:1) and MoO3/MgO have high selectivity of propane and 1,3-butadiene respectively. This review will help researchers in decision making for the selection of proper catalyst for ODH of alkane to alkenes.
1 Introduction
Short-chain olefins, such as ethylene and propylene, are the most significant reactants in the polymer and petrochemical industries [1, 2]. Butanes including 1-butene, 1,3-butadiene, and 2-butene are the most important feedstock for rubber and plastics industries due to their special mechanical properties [3, 4]. Processes used for olefins productions include thermal cracking, fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC), hydrogenation, and oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) [5, 6]. Thermal cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) account for 70% and 28% of total olefins production; these processes have serious drawbacks i.e. highly endothermic, required high temperature, coke formation due to which process shutdown occurs, and thermodynamic limitation [7, 8]. Catalytic hydrogenation of light alkanes such as propane and butane accounts for large production of olefins because it provides a route for obtaining olefins from poorly reactive and low-cost alkanes. It also has drawbacks of thermodynamic constraints i.e. coke formation [9, 10], and not feasible for ethane because it required a high temperature of > 800 °C [11]. Catalyst deactivation by coke formation is also a major problem in propane and butane dehydrogenation process. The coke formation in VOx/Al2O3 catalysts leads to catalyst deactivation, whereas the selectivity of olefin increases [12].
To solve the above limitations, the ODH process is the best option for olefins production because of an exothermic nature and low temperature requirements [13, 14]. A fruitful result can be obtained by the selection of a proper catalyst to increase the product selectivity [15, 16]. A proper catalyst must have properties including fluidizable, stable under repeated oxidation/reduction cycle, avoid agglomeration, mechanically stability, environmentally friendly, and cheap [17]. Catalysts can be categorized into supported and unsupported catalysts. The supported catalysts prioritize unsupported catalysts because of high metal dispersion with that surface area and increase in the number of active sites. For instance, TiO2-supported VOPO4 catalysts give greater ethylene selectivity than the unsupported VO2x and (VO)2 P2O7 catalysts. The supported catalyst properties varied due to changes in pH of catalyst, calcination temperature, dryer temperature, and duration of time for each process [13, 18]. ODH has great importance but still, there are future challenges for high scale production of alkenes such as complete combustion which increase the selectivity of COx, removal of heat of reaction, and fluidizable stable catalyst [19,20,21].
There are various factors including temperature, residence time, successive alkane injection without catalyst regeneration, and relative velocity that have significant influence on the ODH process and change in the operating conditions changes the selectivity and conversion. Furthermore, the main factor in the design of a reactor for the ODH process is to control excess oxygen supply because of excess oxygen the reaction proceeds toward complete combustion due to which high selectivity of byproduct is obtained [22]. For design purposes, several different types of reactor systems for ODH of alkanes are discussed in the literature the main two types are fixed and fluidized bed reactors [23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35]. As ODH is an exothermic process, temperature control is very important for the high selectivity of desirable products, In this regard, a fluidized bed reactor was found to be the better option compared to fixed bed reactor [14, 36, 37].
In this study, the importance of the ODH process for olefins production using paraffin as a feedstock in a fluidized bed reactor was discussed. Furthermore, a comparative study of catalysts used in the ODH process of alkane to alkenes including ethane to ethylene, propane to propylene, and butane to butylene were critically discussed and summarized. Different catalysts were summarized by physicochemical techniques such as BET surface area, Raman spectroscopy, and temperature programmed reduction (TPR). Furthermore, the factors affecting to the ODH of alkane to alkene including temperature, residence time, and successive alkane injection without catalyst regeneration, relative velocity, and oxygen/butane ratio were critically analyzed. Finally, different reactor system designs for ODH of alkane to alkene were briefly discussed. This review will help researchers in decision making for the selection of proper catalyst for ODH of alkane to alkenes and will help attract the attention of the researcher for further enhancement in this field of research.
2 Catalyst Characterization
2.1 Catalysts in ODH of Ethane to Ethylene
2.1.1 BET Analysis
The surface area plays a vital role in the activity of a catalyst; it changes by doping or impregnation of active sites on the catalyst support. As by 1 wt% Ce doping coupled with Vd impregnation decrease the ɣ-Al2O3 (support) surface area from 296 to 146 m2/g [38]. The surface area of ɣ-Al2O3 is decreased from 141 to 24 m2/gm of the catalyst after impregnating of vanadium and niobium oxide [39], with impregnation of vanadium and molybdenum species it changes to 80 m2/gm of catalyst. It also affects the pore volume of the catalyst and changes it from 0.75 to 0.39 cm3/g [40]. Results for ZrO2 and VOx impregnation reduce surface area from 141 to 24.1 m2/gm of the catalyst [41]. For activated Al2O3, it reduces surface area from 237.9 to 205 m2/g after impregnation of V2O5 of 15 w% (1). The decrease in surface area is due to the impregnating species which block some of the support area [17, 41].
2.1.2 Raman Analysis
The Raman spectra show the oxide formation in the catalyst, on analyzing the Al2O3, it does not show any spectra because of the ionic nature of the Al–O [41,42,43]. The study showed that increasing the metal loading on the supported catalyst (approximately 10%) will increase the formation of poly vanadate species [43, 44]. As Ce wt% increases in support catalyst, the Raman spectra increase showing the formation of mono vanadate and poly vanadate species [45, 46].
2.1.3 TPR/TPO Analysis
Oxidative dehydrogenation reaction can be easily understood by TPR/TPO analysis [38]. Repeatedly measured TPR gives information on oxygen-carrying capacity and the redox property of a catalyst [40]. The higher H2 reduction of Nb promoted VOx/La-ɣ-Al2O3 catalyst (79 cm3/g) which attributed to the better dispersion of VOx and having the additional capacity of carrying lattice oxygen though. TPR results showed the catalyst reduction, reoxidation, and activity enhancement after Nb addition [47]. Importantly, analysis of TPR that with increasing in Ce content in VOx/Ce-ɣ-Al2O3 catalyst the TPR peaks shifted toward higher temperature which means that by doping more Ce surface became more stable, which required high temperature for reduction [48]. Literature shows that by Ce doping the reducibility of catalyst decreases [38]. VOx–MoOx/ɣ-Al2O3 catalyst estimated that 82% of metal loading is for repeated reduction and reoxidation process [17]. The oxygen-carrying capacity decreases after increasing the ZrO2 on the supported catalyst (VOx/ɣ-Al2O3–ZrO2) [40].
2.2 Catalyst in ODH of Butane to Butylenes
2.2.1 BET Analysis
Loss of surface area in the catalyst is related to the sintering of nanoparticles during catalytic reaction [49, 50]. These changes occur in surface area is being calculated by BET analysis, such as the catalyst with Mo–V–MgO surface area changed from 71.3 to 48 m2/g, MgO fresh surface area was 52.48 m2/g and after used value reduced to 22.45 m2/g [51]. V/MgO catalyst surface area was 25.3 m2/g after the calcined sample [52, 53]. The dopant of a doped catalyst also affects the surface area in use condition as compared to an undoped catalyst, the MgO doped catalyst has a higher surface area after reaction compared to undoped by this shows that the doped catalyst is also resisting sintering and stabilize [49, 50].
2.2.2 Raman Analysis
Raman spectra play role in the demonstration of graphite formation related to the catalyst calcined temperature, the Mg–V–MgO catalyst is calcined by 640 °C and 720 °C, graphite particle was observed in 640 °C calcined catalyst and not be observed in 720 °C, this graphite particle seems to be the part of coke formation [51]. Raman spectra demonstrate that the catalyst doped with different metals had a different structure and catalytic activity such as the Ca, Sr, and Ba had orthovanadate phase and difficult to reduce, the redox cycle would not be complete and having low activity [49, 50].
2.2.3 TPR/TPO Analysis
The crystallinity and diffusional resistance of a catalyst play a role in temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), in light of the above statement the MoO3/MgO catalyst display a higher reduction temperature in the TPR diagram, because of higher diffusional resistance and larger crystal formation [54]. The crystallinity plays a role in the reduction peaks of catalyst as the Ca, Ba and Sr doped catalyst was difficult to reduce as compared to Mg-doped catalyst because of the orthovanadate crystalline phase [49, 50]. TPR analysis indicates that increasing in doping of Mo on V–MgO will increase the reduction temperature due to which the activity of the catalyst decreases because of reducing the number of active sites on the catalyst [55].
2.3 Catalyst in ODH of Propane to Propylene
2.3.1 BET Analysis
Analysis of VOx/Al2O3 catalyst, BET surface area change by increasing the percentage of active catalyst (VOx/) as 5% V/Al2O3 surface area is 188.64 m2/g, 7% V/Al2O3 have 179.27 m2/g and 10%V/Al2O3 have 153 m2/g [56, 57]. This decrease in surface area is because of the active catalyst located inside the channel system and maybe the blocking of support pores by the active catalyst and maybe the formation of crystalline phases [58]. Changes in support catalyst also affect the surface area as V/Al2O3 has 109 m2/g, V/SiO2 has 300 m2/g, and V/TiO2 has 51 m2/g surface area, etc. [59]. Now the comparison in BET surface area of simple and modified support catalyst is such as 2.5% V/ɣ-Al2O3 have 200 m2/g and 2.5%V/ZrO2-ɣ-Al2O3 have 128 m2/g etc. [60].
2.3.2 Raman Analysis
Raman spectroscopy analyzes that the structure and dispersion of VOx surface area are dependent on surface density, the surface vanadia species will be more polymerized with increasing loading of the active catalyst [43].The good selectivity of propylene is related to a high proportion of mono vanadate and poly vanadate species for this, the catalyst VOx/CaO-ɣ-Al2O3 (1:1) and VOx/CaO-ɣ-Al2O3 (1:4) is examined and VOx/CaO-ɣ-Al2O3 (1:1) shows highest propane conversion and propylene selectivity [61].
2.3.3 TPR/TPO Analysis
TPR/TPO is important for oxygen-free ODH characterization it will demonstrate the expected capacity of reducibility and regeneration of a catalyst, with increasing reaction temperature the conversion of propane and the selectivity of propylene increases, and the CO2 selectivity decreases, by adding the CaO compounds, it increases the oxygen-carrying capacity of VOx/CaOɣ-Al2O3 catalyst [61]. The hydrogen consumption is related to the active catalyst loading and metal adding to the supported catalyst, in light of the above the VOx/ZrO2ɣ-Al2O3 catalyst consumes more H2 than the catalyst without ZrO2, it was concluded that by increasing vanadium and metal loading to the supported catalyst the O2 releasing is in a more controlled manner [62], which is result in a high propylene selectivity [61].
3 Effect of Operating Conditions
The following Tables 1, 2, and 3 show the operating conditions for ODH of ethane, butane, and propane in a fluidized bed reactor. Change in the operating conditions changes the selectivity and conversion. The effect of different operating parameters on selectivity and conversion is shown below. For ODH of ethane and propane, a CREC riser simulator was used. First of all the reactor basket was loaded with the required amount of catalyst, then the leakage of the vacuum box and reactor were checked through Argon flow. After this, the reactor temperature was increased and when the temperature reached the desired conditions the reactor was depressurized and ON the impeller at the required speed and injected the feed [11, 17, 18, 60, 61]. VOx/ɣ-Al2O3ZrO2 (1:1) and VOx/c-Al2O3 catalyst in ethane ODH and VOx/ɣ-Al2O3ZrO2 in propane ODH used the lattice oxygen instead of surface oxygen, in the presence of lattice oxygen the selectivity of the alkenes is increased as compared to the surface oxygen because in case of surface oxygen a large amount of oxygen is available and the reaction goes toward the complete combustion and increase the selectivity of undesired product The V/MgO catalyst was studied in both ICFB and quartz fluidized bed reactor [33, 61, 63].

4 Factors Affecting the ODH of Alkane
4.1 ODH of Ethane
4.1.1 Effect of Temperature
Figure 1 shows the effect of temperature on the ODH of ethane to ethylene. The major product in this reaction is COx, C2H4, and C2H6 [47]. From Fig. 1, it was observed that the conversion is increasing and selectivity was decreasing with the temperature. But in the case of VOx/ɣ-Al2O3ZrO2, the selectivity of the ethylene is increasing at high temperatures. it is due to the control availability of the lattice oxygen. It was also observed that due to the addition of ZrO2 and Ce with the VOx/ɣ-Al2O3 catalyst increased the selectivity and conversion. It was concluded that the VOx/ɣ-Al2O3ZrO2 (2:1) catalyst has greater ethylene selectivity.

4.1.2 Effect of Time
Figure 2 shows the effect of time on the conversion of ethane and the selectivity of ethylene in a fluidized bed reactor. Generally, it was concluded that the conversion is increasing and selectivity is decreasing with time. But the selectivity of ethylene was increased with time in case of using VOx/ɣ-Al2O3ZrO2 (2:1) catalyst. This is due to the proper control of metal-support interaction by the edition of ZrO2 as a promoter to the VOx/ɣ-Al2O3ZrO2 catalyst. It was also observed that VOx/ɣ-Al2O3ZrO2 (1:1) has greater conversion and lower selectivity as compared to the VOx/ɣ-Al2O3ZrO2 (2:1) catalyst [40, 64].

4.1.3 Effect of Ethane Injection With and Without Catalyst Regeneration
The literature study shows that the conversion of ethane and selectivity of ethylene remains stable in the presence of catalysts shown in Table 1. The stable behavior of these catalysts is also shown by their TPR/TPO results [38, 40, 47]. When ethane is fed to the reactor without catalyst regeneration for some consecutive run, the conversion was decreased and ethylene selectivity was increased. Initially, ethane conversion was increased but after the first cycle, there was a sharp decrease in the conversion because of the availability of oxygen. The fresh catalyst has greater lattice oxygen but with used lattice oxygen will decrease [65].
4.2 ODH of Propane
4.2.1 Effect of Temperature
Figure 3 shows propane conversion and propylene selectivity as a function of temperature. The experiment was conducted using a fluidizable catalyst and after each ODH run, the catalyst was regenerated by using air [57, 61]. From Fig. 3, it was observed that with increasing temperature the conversion of propane and selectivity of propylene will increase, the increase in selectivity of propylene means that the selectivity of CO2 is decreasing. The VOx/CaO-ɣ-Al2O3 (1:1) catalyst shows high conversion and selectivity than VOx/CaO-ɣ-Al2O3 (1:4) and VOx/CaO because of low acidity [61].

4.2.2 Effect of Residence Time
Figure 4 shows propane conversion and propylene selectivity as a function of time. Figure 4 shows that for all catalysts the conversion of propane is increasing with time while the selectivity of propylene is increasing with time by using the 7.5VOx/ɣ-Al2O3ZrO2 catalyst and decreases by using other catalysts. The VOx/CaO-ɣ-Al2O3 (1:1) has high propylene selectivity than VOx/CaO-ɣ-Al2O3 (1:4) because of moderate acidity. The VOx/CaO also has greater propylene selectivity than VOx/CaO-ɣ-Al2O3 (1:4) catalyst [61].

4.2.3 Effect of Successive Propane Injection Without Catalyst Regeneration
The ODH of propane is carried out in a fluidized bed reactor using a heterogeneous catalyst. The literature study shows that without catalyst regeneration after each ODH run the propane conversion will be high at the first propane injection and then it will decrease continuously. This decrease in conversion after the first injection is due to the combustion of lattice oxygen present on the catalyst. The first injection is mainly influenced by the reactive and weakly bounded oxygen which gives complete combustion. The selectivity of propylene will be low at the first injection but after the first injection, there will be a sharp increase in the selectivity of propylene because of a decrease in the selectivity of COx. So it is concluded that to obtain maximum ethylene selectivity a certain degree of reduction of catalyst will be needed [38, 40, 57, 61].
4.3 ODH of Butane
4.3.1 Effect of Oxygen/Butane Ratio
Figure 5 shows the effect of the oxygen butane ratio on the conversion and selectivity of butane and 1,3-butadiene. The experimental results are in agreement with the model proposed for ODH of butane. According to the model with an increase in oxygen/butane ratio, the conversion will increase and selectivity will decrease. The decrease in the selectivity of 1,3-butadiene means the selectivity of Cox and butane is increased [66]. In Fig. 5, the catalysts 640 and 720 mean that one catalyst is calcinated at 640 °C and another at 720 °C. It was observed that catalyst 720 shows the highest selectivity of 48% than that catalyst 640 of 44%. The MoO3/MgO and V2O5/MgO catalysts show almost the same selectivity by using CFBR. The MoO3/MgO and V2O5/MgO catalysts show the highest selectivity in the TZFB reactor than CFBR [54].

Full size image
4.3.2 Effect of Temperature, Time, and Relative Velocity on ODH of Butane
According to an experimental study that the conversion of butane increases with temperature while the selectivity of C4 (butene and 1,3-butadiene) is decreasing at high temperatures. The experimental results are also in agreement with the proposed model [22, 53, 54, 66, 67]. The MoO3/MgO catalyst shows high selectivity and conversion in the TZFB reactor than in CFBR operating under the same temperature range [54].
In the case of time dependence on selectivity and conversion, the experimental study opposed the proposed model. According to the experimental study, the selectivity and conversion are decreasing with time using lattice oxygen. In the presence of an anaerobic condition, the catalyst V/MgO shows that the selectivity of butene is increasing and the selectivity of butadiene is decreasing [22, 53, 54, 66, 67].
The relative velocity also affects the conversion of butane and the selectivity of olefins. Relative velocity must in such a range to obtain optimum solid mixing. The catalyst Mo-v-MgO (720) shows the maximum butadiene selectivity at the 1.8 relative velocities and a further increase in relative velocity decrease the selectivity of butadiene [22, 53, 54, 66, 67]. The catalyst V/MgO study shows that butane conversion and olefins selectivity both decrease with the increase in relative velocity [53].
5 Summary of Performance Comparison of the ODH Catalysts
The Tables 4, 5, and 6, shows the comparison of different literature based on operating temperature, conversion, and selectivity for the ODH ethane, propane, and butane respectively. It was found that the addition of Nb with the VOx-/La-ɣAl2O3 catalyst increases the conversion and selectivity. Furthermore, the addition of ZrO2 with the VOx/ɣAl2O3 catalyst also increases the conversion (11–11.45%) and selectivity (82–90%). In the case of ODH of ethane, VOx–Nb/La-ɣAl2O3 catalyst shows a high conversion of 20.1% and good selectivity of 85.7% at the temperature of 550 °C, as shown in Table 4. The conversion and selectivity for the propane and propene was presented in Table 5. The catalyst 7.5 VOx/ɣAl2O3ZrO2 was tested under the complete and incomplete combustion of propane and it was concluded that under the complete combustion the catalyst 7.5 VOx/ɣAl2O3ZrO2 show maximum selectivity of 93% and conversion of 25% [62]. Moreover, in the case of propane, 7.5VOx/ɣAl2O3ZrO2 (1:1) catalysts show high selectivity of ethylene up to 94%. The ODH of butane and selectivity of 1,3-butadiene was shown in Table 6. The catalyst V/MgO was tested under a different environment (anaerobic and oxygen-free environment) and a different fluidizable reactor (ICFBR and TZFBR). In the case of butane, MoO3/MgO catalysts show high selectivity of 1,3-butadiene [22, 53, 54, 66, 67].

6 Different Reactor System Design for ODH
In this literature review, the ODH of ethane and propane was carried out in the CREC Rise simulator developed by de Lasa as shown in Fig. 6a. It is a small-scale laboratory reactor used for the evaluation of catalysts. CREC rise simulator has two major parts upper and lower parts. The main components of CREC rise simulator are (a) impeller (7000 rpm), (b) vacuum box (1000 ml), (c) cooling jacket, (d) thermocouple port, (e) syringe, (f) heaters. The vacuum box is directly connected to the GC for the final product analysis. The vacuum box is also connected with the reactor utilizing four automatic control valves which give a signal about the termination of reaction for the pre-specified reaction time. The main advantages of the CREC rise simulator are (a) control isothermal conditions, (b) required a very small amount of catalyst, (c) minimized mass transfer limitation [33, 61, 63, 65].

Figure 6b shows the two-zone fluidized bed reactor (TZFBR) for the ODH of butane. The reaction occurred in the reduction zone and the regeneration of the reduced catalyst occurred in the oxidation zone. The TZFBR has the following main component (a) 25 cm long quartz tube, (b) distributor plate, (c) movable axial quartz probe. The main variables in TZFBR are (a) temperature, (b) relative velocity, (c) oxygen/butane ratio [22, 53, 54, 66, 67]. The MoO3/MgO catalyst study concluded that TZFBR shows high butadiene yield than CFBR and Fixed bed reactor [54]. The V/MgO catalyst was also studied in the interconnected fluidized bed reactor (FBR). ICFBR has high control of the flow of solid and large circulation of solid than the TZFBR [53].
7 Conclusion
In this study, the oxidative dehydrogenation of alkane (C2–C4) to alkenes in a fluidized bed reactor was presented with focus of mixed metallic oxide catalyst. Different catalysts were summrized by physicochemical techniques such as BET surface area, Raman spectroscopy, and temperature programmed reduction (TPR). The BET analysis of several catalysts showed an optimal value of active and metal loading catalysts for maximum alkene selectivity. The higher selectivity of alkenes was due to the greater proportion of mono and poly vanadate species on the catalyst; various metals added to the catalyst affected its activity. Increasing a catalyst's reduction temperature reduced its activity, which eventually affected alkene selectivity. The metal loading, crystallinity phase, and diffusional resistance of a catalyst all contributed to an increase in reduction temperature. In ODH of ethane, the addition of ZrO2 and Ce with VOx/ɣAl2O3 catalyst increased the conversion and selectivity of ethane and ethylene, respectively. The catalyst VOx/ɣAl2O3ZrO2 (2:1) showed a greater conversion of ethane and high selectivity of ethylene than catalyst VOx/ɣAl2O3ZrO2 (1:1). In ODH of ethane, the catalyst VOx–Nb/La-ɣAl2O3 showed a high conversion of 20.1% and good selectivity of 85.7%. Due to moderate acidity, the VOx/CaO-ɣAl2O3 (1:1) catalyst achieved high selectivity and conversion than the VOx/CaO-ɣAl2O3 (1:4) catalyst in ODH of propane. In ODH of propane, the 7.5 VOx/ɣAl2O3ZrO2 (1:1) catalyst achieved high selectivity of 94%. Furthermore, with successive feed injections without catalyst regeneration, selectivity was observed to be increased. Finally, the highest selectivity of butadiene (80%) was obtained in ODH of butane by utilizing the catalyst MoO3/MgO.
It is anticipated that in the near future, a highly efficient and affordable reactor configuration with an exceptional performance level catalyst will offer the key for final industrial deployment of butane and other ODH processes as an alternative to conventional direct dehydrogenation. Therefore, the key to generating commercially acceptable alkene yields is the combination of appropriate reactor architecture and a selective catalyst system.
