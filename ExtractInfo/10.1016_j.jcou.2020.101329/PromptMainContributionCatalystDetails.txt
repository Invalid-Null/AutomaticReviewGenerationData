CO2 Assisted Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene over Fluidizable MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 Catalysts
Abstract
This study investigated the catalytic performance of a novel fluidizable MoO3 supported on La2O3-γAl2O3 composite for oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene with and without CO2. The La2O3-γAl2O3 composites were synthesized by a coprecipitation method, while the active MoO3 was deposited by an incipient wetness impregnation approach. The incorporation of La2O3 controlled both the acidity and reducibility of the catalysts, as revealed by NH3-TPD and H2-TPR analysis, respectively. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms analysis indicated the mesoporous pore size distribution of the catalysts. The ODH of propane experiments were developed in a fluidized CREC Riser Simulator by feeding propane with or without CO2. The performance of the synthesized catalysts was found to be a function of the La2O3 content of the support. In general, the propane conversion declined slightly, while propylene selectivity increased with the increasing La2O3 content. It was hypothesized that the presence of basic La2O3 reduced the acidity and the non-selective sites of γ-Al2O3, which were responsible for deep oxidation of propylene and propane. Among the studied catalysts, MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O31:2 displayed the highest propylene yield of 28.2 % at 600 ℃ in the absence of CO2. However, a superior yield of 35.2% was achieved over the same catalyst by the introduction of CO2-admixture in the feed at 550 ℃.
1. Introduction
In recent years, the global demand for light olefins (i.e. ethylene, propylene and butenes) has been increasing significantly. Among the short chain olefins, propylene is the most important feedstock in the petrochemical and chemical industries for the production of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, cumen, phonol, iso-propylic alcohol, propylene oxide and several other variety of propylene derivatives [1][2][3]. The projected annual global propylene demand by the year of 2030 is approximately 160 million metric tons [4][5]. The estimation also shows that there is a gap between propylene demand and supply, which is likely to grow further in the near future [6][7]. Over 80 % of the current world propylene supply is obtained as secondary product of the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of vacuum gas oil and steam cracking of naphtha and other hydrocarbons. The remaining 20% of the propylene supply is mainly derived from the on-purpose processes such as dehydrogenation of propane, oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, olefins metathesis and methanol-to-propylene [8][9]. The dynamics of propylene supply from the FCC processes is related to the price of gasoline. As the demand for gasoline decreases, the refineries are forced to cut down production, which affects the propylene supply [10]. Severe coke formation is another issue related to FCC based propylene production. On the other hand, steam cracking is an energy intensive process, which accounts for almost 40% of the total annual energy consumption in the petrochemical industries. The steam cracking process also suffers from coke formation and it significantly contributes to the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere [11][12][13]. In order to address the aftermentioned issues, several innovative technologies have been explored to produce propylene from alternative sources [14].
The dehydrogenation of lighter alkanes, mainly obtained from refinery gas, natural gas, as well as shale gas, which has recently gained much attention as an alternative to produce propylene with higher yields and lower costs than those of the conventional processes [15]. However, the dehydrogenation of the short-chain alkanes is a high temperature process, given the reactions involved are endothermic and limited by the thermodynamic equilibrium. In addition, the process conditions are favorable for thermal cracking of both propane and propylene to undesired lighter hydrocarbons. It also contributes to severe coke formation, which leads to catalyst deactivation and production losses [16][17].
In this regard, oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of low molecular weight hydrocarbons is a more promising approach, as the reactions involved are exothermic and occur at relatively lower temperatures. The coke formation is also minimal due to presence of oxygen. There is no issue of thermodynamic equilibrium limitations because of the formation of water as a byproduct [18][19]. However, the control of olefin selectivity in the ODH is challenging due to the possibility of successive oxidation of the feed and the desired products in presence of gas phase oxygen. The high flammability of the hydrocarbons/oxygen mixture is also a major concern for possible runaway reactions [20][21]. To address these limitations, the present research group has been investigating a novel circulating fluidized bed ODH process, which uses lattice oxygen of the metal oxide catalyst (instead of gas phase O2) for oxidative dehydrogenation reactions [22][23]. Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the gas phase O2 free ODH process. In this approach, the lattice oxygen of the catalyst plays a crucial role on hydrogen abstraction from the alkanes by its reduction in oxidation state along with water formation. The reduced catalyst can be regenerated in air by circulating them into another reactor, called catalyst regenerator and recycle back for next the cycle reaction [24][25]. With some encouraging results, this route is also susceptible to the deep oxidation of feed/product into COx, which could be further decreased by using CO2 in the feed as a soft oxidant.

The feeding of CO2 also helps to tackle the formation of undesired COx reaction towards their thermodynamic minima [26][27]. On the other hand, co-feeding of CO2 favors the desired ODH reactions by abstracting H2 through reverse water gas shift reaction, and helps to minimize coke formation via Boudouard reaction [28][29][30]. Furthermore, the high heat capacity of CO2 also contributes to subside the cracking reactions by eliminating hot spots [29][30]. Interestingly, CO2 is a cheap feedstock and its utilization in ODH will contribute to the global efforts on the reduction of greenhouse CO2 gas emission[31][32]. In the light of these merits, oxidative dehydrogenation of short-chain alkane using CO2 as a mild oxidant has been arousing significant research interests [33][34]. However, the major challenge of CO2 utilization arises from its low reactivity due to thermodynamic stability. Only an efficient catalyst and appropriate reaction conditions could activate the CO2 molecule to interact with propane to give high propylene yields [35][36].
Therefore, the development of a suitable catalyst that can contribute to high propane/CO2 conversion with high propylene selectivity/yields is the outstanding challenge. An efficient catalyst should be able to activate the C-H (of hydrocarbons) and O-C-O (CO2) bonds effectively towards the desired products, propylene and water. In the search of feasible catalysts for ODH, several transitional metals oxides such oxides of molybdenum, vanadium, chromium, gallium, indium and some other metals supported on silica, zeolite and mesoporous alumina have been studied [37]. There are two major aspects in development of a selective oxidative catalyst for oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes, including, (i) the redox properties - the lattice oxygen of transitional metal oxide catalyst are more effective and selective than molecular oxygen as an oxidizing agent and (ii) isolated active sites – to minimize the successive oxidation of the products [38].
The durability and the activity of a metal oxide catalyst can be enhanced by using a suitable support. Among common support such as Al2O3, SiO2 and TiO2, Al2O3 appears to be more promising due to its mild acidity and favorable textural properties. Although γAl2O3 possesses the desired characteristics as a support material for redox active metals, it is prone to sintering and phase transformation at high temperatures [[39], [40], [41]]. The addition of a second metal oxides such as La, Ce, Zr to γAl2O3 can improve the thermal stability and activity of the catalysts [40,42]. Lanthanum oxide is recognized as one of the outstanding basic material used for most reactions to enhance and improve the basic strength of catalyst [43]. The addition of lanthanum also improves the fluidizability of the catalyst, the surfaces area, thermal stability, the CO2 adsorption capacity, reducibility, dispersion of metal as well as the capability to reduce the acidity of the support [[44], [45], [46], [47]]. Supported vanadium-based catalyst is considered among the most active and studied catalyst for ODH [48,49]. However, they suffer a drawback of poor selectivity due to complete oxidation of reactant/products with high VOx loading. On the other hand, Mo-based catalyst are innocuous, comparatively less expensive, and have therefore received a great deal of attention for oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons due to its exceptional selectivity towards desired product [50][48][51][52]. The mechanism involves abstraction of hydrogen from the methylene group most probably by the terminal M=O bond to form surface hydroxyl group and an adsorbed iso-propyl. Propylene is generated by hydride elimination from iso-propyl and a second hydroxyl group is formed leading to the reduction of molybdenum oxide and formation of water [53]. The promotional effect of molybdenum was confirmed in the works of Alasiri et al. [54] and Nayak et al. [55]. They found that the increase of the molybdenum content improved the catalyst performances by increasing amount of propane adsorbed which in turn enhances the conversion. There has been a number of research on the utilization of supported molybdenum oxide for the ODH of propane to propylene using gas phase oxygen as oxidizing agent [56][57]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no studies reported in the open literature that investigated the use of CO2 as a mild oxidant in ODH of propane over MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 catalysts.
With this background on the desired characteristics of an efficient catalyst, the present study investigated the MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane using CO2 as a mild oxidant. The catalyst support system with varying ratio of La2O3/γAl2O3 was synthesized by the coprecipitation technique. The active MoO3 phase was impregnated on the mixed La2O3/γAl2O3 support by an incipient wetness approach. The CO2 assisted ODH of propane was carried out in a fluidized CREC Riser Simulator at atmospheric pressure and at varying temperature (525-600℃). The stability of the catalyst, effect temperature, effect of CO2, effect of La2O3/γAl2O3 ratios have been investigated.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The La2O3-γAl2O3 composite supports were prepared by a coprecipitation technique, with La2O3/γAl2O3 ratio of 1:3, 1:2 and 1:1. The major steps of the catalyst synthesis are depicted in Fig. 2.

In synthesis, the desired quantity of La(NO3)3.6H2O) and Al(NO3)3.9H2O were dissolved in deionized water and the solution was placed on a hot plate at 40 ℃ with continuous stirring. A buffer solution containing (NH4)2CO3 and NH3.H2O at a pH of 8.5 was added to induce precipitation. The precipitated material was aged for two hours, dried at 120℃ for two hours and then calcined at 500℃ for six hours [58].
The MoO3 were deposited on the La2O3-γAl2O3 support by an incipient wetness impregnation technique. In this method, a desired amount of ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (equivalent to 10 wt % Mo loading) was dissolved in deionized water that matched with the total pore volume of the support, thereafter, the La2O3-γAl2O3 support was added to the solution [59]. The mixture was stirred continuously for 3 hours to achieve homogeneous mixing. The resultant paste was dried at 120℃ for six hours and then calcined at 500℃ for six hours under GC quality air stream [57]. In all catalysts, the Mo loading was maintained at 10 wt % and the synthesized catalysts are identified as (i) MoO3/γAl2O3, (ii) MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O31:3, (iii) MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O31:2 and (iv) MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 1:1.
2.2. Characterizations
2.2.1. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)
The XRD was carried out to identify the crystalline phases and the phase composition of the synthesized catalysts. In this regard, an analytical diffractometer called Rigaku MiniFlex equipped with Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.15406 nm) at 40 kV and 30 mA was employed. The catalyst was scanned with a 2θ range between 10 – 90 using a scanning speed of 3°/min and a step size of 0.02. The obtained diffractions were compared with Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) files package for phase identification.
2.2.2. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
The characteristics of the functional groups present on the support/catalysts were identified by FTIR analysis using a Nicolet 6700 Thermo Fisher Scientific analyzer. For each analysis, about 3 mg of the powdered synthesized support/catalyst sample was mixed with about 400 mg KBr to form a uniform mixture. The mixture is then placed in a pelletizer, pressed in to a self-supporting disc of about 1.2 cm by applying pressure. The pressed sample was pretreated at high vacuum pressure (residual pressure < 10-3 mbar) and degassed for 1 h at 150, 300 and 500 ℃ to remove moisture and other contaminants before proceeding to spectra recording. The FTIR spectrograms were recorded in the ranges of 400-4000 cm-1 spectrum.
2.2.3. SEM-EDX Analysis
The surface morphology of the synthesized catalysts with different La2O3/γAl2O3 ratios were conducted by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis, using a JEOL-SEM analyzer. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy was used for the elemental analysis of the catalysts. In a typical analysis, the sample was initially spread on a stub that was covered with copper. The sample was coated with gold to enhance image quality with high visibility at magnification of one million times. The measuring and recording of the spectrum were done at room temperature.
2.2.4. Nitrogen Adsorption Isotherms
The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and the pore volume of the prepared catalysts (the textural properties) were measured by using N2 adsorption-desorption analysis in a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument. The experiments were conducted using 0.1 g of the catalyst sample. Before analysis, the sample was degassed at 200 ⁰C under elevated vacuum pressure for 2.5 hours to remove any moisture or contaminants that might have been present in the sample. After degassing, the sample holder was moved to the analysis port, where it was placed in a liquid nitrogen bath to maintain constant 77 K temperature. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were recorded between relative pressure of 10-6 to 1. The specific surface area and pore volume of the samples were calculated using multipoint BET and BJH (Barrett, Joyner, and Halenda) methods, respectively.
2.2.5. Raman Spectroscopy
A Horiba Raman spectrometer fixed to a confocal microscope was used to identify the molecular structure of the synthesized catalyst. For each analysis, about 0.5 g of the sample was dehydrated with dry air at 773 K for about one hour and then cooled down to room temperature before the spectra collection [60]. In analysis, the catalyst sample was excited by using a 532 nm ion laser and spectrograms were recorded in the range of 200-1200 cm-1.
2.2.6. Temperature Program Desorption (NH3-TPD)
The total acidity and the acid site distribution of the synthesized catalysts were measured by NH3-TPD analysis using a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 analyzer. For each analysis, 0.1 g of catalyst sample was loaded in a U-shaped quarts tube, which was then fitted to the sample port. The sample was degassed and reduced by flowing a gas stream of 10% H2 (balanced He) at 500 ℃. The reduced sample temperature was then brought back to 120℃ under helium flow. The catalyst was then saturated with ammonia at 120 ℃ by flowing a gas containing 5.5 % NH3 (balanced He) at a rate of 50 ml/min. The system was then flushed with helium at 100 ℃ at a rate of 50 ml/min to remove unabsorbed ammonia on the catalyst surface. For NH3-TPD analysis, the catalyst bed temperature was raised from 120 to 750 ℃ at a rate of 10 ℃/min. The quantity of desorbed ammonia was recorded by using a thermal conductivity detector (TPD).
2.2.7. Temperature Programmed Reduction (H2-TPR)
A Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 analyzer was used to accomplish the H2-TPR analysis. For each experiment, 0.1 g of catalyst sample was loaded in a U-shaped quartz tube, which as then fitted to the sample port. The sample was initially pretreated by circulating a gas mixture containing 5 % O2 (balanced He) at 500℃ for one hour. The system was then brought back to room temperature by flowing argon, which also flushed out of any adsorbed/trapped oxygen molecule in the system. The H2-TPR was conducted by using a gas stream of 10% H2 (balanced He) at a flow rate of 50 ml/min, while the system temperature was increased from room temperature to 850 ℃ at heating rate of 10 ℃/min. The reduction of the catalyst sample was measured by a calibrated thermal conductivity detector (TCD), which is capable of detecting the variation in the H2 concentration in the effluent gas stream due to the reduction process.
2.3. Catalyst Evaluation
The CO2 assisted ODH of propane experiments were carried out in a batch scale fluidized CREC Riser Simulator (CREC- Chemical Reaction Engineering Center) [61]. Fig. 3 shows the schematic diagram of the experimental set up involving the CREC Riser Simulator. The catalyst evaluation runs were carried at four reaction temperatures (525, 550, 575 and 600 ℃) and for a reaction time of 30s. All the experiments conducted using same 0.2 g of catalyst. After catalyst loading, the reactor was purged with argon in order to avoid any interference of ambient oxygen (air). The system was heated to the desired reaction temperature and the vacuum box pressure reduced to 3 psi (20.7 kPa) by using a vacuum pump. The catalyst was fluidized by turning the high-speed impeller located on top of the reactor basket. At his stage CO2 and propane was injected into reactor by using an airtight syringe. After pre-specified reaction period, the 4-port valve connecting to the vacuum box was automatically opened and transferred the entire reactor products into the vacuum box instantly. The conditions inside the vacuum box ensured the termination of the reactions. The product from the vacuum box was analyzed by an online GC (Agilent 7890A) equipped with both TCD and FID analyzer. The TCD (6Ft 1/8 2 mm HayeSep Q 80/100 Ni) detected the permanent gases such as CH4, CO, CO2 and H2 while the FID (HP AL/S (8 μm) analytical column: 25 m ×0.32 mm) detects CH4, C2H6, C2H4, C3H8, C3H6 and other hydrocarbons [22]. The product analysis data was further processed to calculate propane conversion (

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Catalyst Characterizations
3.1.1. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD)
Fig. 4 displays the crystalline structures of the synthesized support (γAl2O3) and the prepared MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 catalysts with varying La2O3 to Al2O3 ratios and 10% MoO3. The cubic structured crystalline phases of bare γAl2O3 before MoO3 loading appeared at 2θ angles of 37, 45 and 67°, as suggested by JCPDS card no. 10-0425 [62] [63]. The MoO3/γAl2O3 sample (without La2O3) showed two weak diffraction peaks at 2θ angles of 45° and 67° that were attributed to the presence of crystalline γAl2O3 [64][65]. These two peaks (45° and 67°) gradually diminished upon incorporation and increase of the amount of La2O3, as observed in MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 samples. On the other hand, the peak at 37° completely disappeared when La2O3 was introduced to the catalyst sample. These recessions may be due to the partial coverage of γAl2O3 by well dispersed La2O3 phase and/or the decrease of the size/crystallinity of γAl2O3 to no-detectable limits [66].

The small diffraction peaks (110) and (040) at 2θ angles of 23° and 25.7° indicated the presence of orthorhombic phase of MoO3 (JCPDS 35-0609) [67][68]. The peaks at 23° and 25.7° appeared to increase slightly in intensity as the amount of La2O3 increased. This may be due to the formation of molybdenum aggregate as a result of the reduction in surface area caused by La2O3 addition. The weak diffraction peaks observed for all the synthesized catalyst at 23 and 25.7° was an evidence that the molybdenum oxide was well dispersed over the support [53]. All the diffraction peaks were dominated by both γAl2O3 and MoO3 as no diffraction peak corresponded to La2O3, which supposed to be positioned at 2θ of 35°. This observation suggests that La2O3 appeared as an amorphous and well dispersed phase on the catalyst surface or may be below the detection limit of the XRD [69][70]. The other phases due to the interaction of the metal oxide with each other (such as Al2(MoO4)3) were not observed. It can therefore be considered that reaction between molybdenum and the support γAl2O3 and/or is La2O3 is negligible at the calcination temperature of 500℃ [71].
3.1.2. SEM and EDX
The SEM images of the synthesized catalysts reveal that the molybdenum oxide was well supported and distributed on the catalyst (Fig. 5 (a-f)). This indicates the potential availability of high contact area and active sites for both adsorption and desorption of reactants and products [72]. The SEM images also showed irregular shape and size of the dispersed particles on surface. The incorporation of La2O3 to γAl2O3 did not affect the morphology as the irregular shape and size of particle is maintained in all the catalyst. However, the addition of MoO3 to the La2O3-γAl2O3 support formed a new layer of particles on the surface of the support. The MoO3 layer increased and formed cluster as the amount of La2O3 in the support increased. This observation is consistent to the XRD results where the molybdenum peaks increased as the lanthanum content in the support increased.

In order to verify the surface elemental composition of the catalyst, the energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) analysis was conducted. The EDS image of γAl2O3 showed the elements of pure gamma alumina whiles the EDS image of MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 1:1 confirmed the presence of MoO3 and La2O3 that were added to the samples by wet impregnation and coprecipitation, respectively.
3.1.3. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)
The surface chemical bonding of the synthesized materials was analyzed by solid phase FTIR. The IR spectra was examined between the wavelength of 450 to 4000 cm-1, as shown in Fig. 6. The bands between 564 to 1000 cm-1 were related to pure γAl2O3. All the catalysts displayed similar spectra with little or no shift in wavenumber. This observation can be attributed to the fact that there was little of no interaction between the support and the active species (MoO3), as observed in the XRD results [57]. For all samples, bands centered around 3500 and 1638 cm-1 were attributed to flexing vibration of O-H group stretch and the bending vibration of H-O-H group from the water that was physisorbed or chemisorbed on the catalyst support by hydrogen bonding. It is interesting to note that the band intensity at 3500 and 1638 cm-1 has a direct connection with the samples specific surface area. For example, the intensity at 3500 cm-1 for MoO3/Al2O3 (212.64 m2/g) was higher than all the lanthanum containing catalyst (the higher the lanthanum content the smaller the specific surface area) [58]. The MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 1:1 catalyst displayed a band at 1463 cm-1, which was due to the stretching of La-O vibration bond that confirmed the formation of La2O3 [73].

3.1.4. N2 Adsorption-desorption Isotherms
Fig. 7 (I) displays the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, while Fig. 7 (II) presents the pore size distribution of the synthesized catalysts. All the synthesized samples showed similar isotherms – consisting of the common phases: (i) monolayer adsorption, (ii) multilayer adsorption and (iii) capillary condensation (Fig. 7(I)). The shape of the adsorption/desorption curves suggested that all synthesized catalysts exhibited type IV adsorption isotherms, which was unequivocally attributed to mesoporous solids (Fig. 7(I)). The H2-type hysteresis loop of the isotherms indicated the existence of bottleneck-like mesopore. The pore size analysis (Fig. 7(II)) of the synthesized catalysts indicated unimodal pore size distribution within the range of 20-100 Å (Fig. 7(II)). The calculated average pore diameter of the samples ∼ 9.0 nm, which was within the standard mesoporous pore range of 2-50 nm of IUPAC classification [74]. The presence of mesoporous property and the absence of any micropore improved the diffusion (mass transport) of reactants and products in and out of the active site.

The textural characteristics of the synthesized materials with various La2O3/γAl2O3 ratios are summarized in Table 1. One can see that the specific surface area of unmodified MoO3/γAl2O3 was 212 m2/g, which decreased gradually with increasing the La2O3 loading. The total pore volume also decreased with increasing the La2O3 content. This observation was attributed to pore blockage by the additional amount of La2O3. A similar observation was reported by Frey et al 2011 [69][75]. The surface area of carbon nanofiber significantly decreased when La2O3 was incorporated into the material structure. The average pore diameter of the synthesized catalyst was increased with increasing the La2O3, which was again related to the blockage of the small pores. The highest La2O3 containing catalysts maintained relatively high surface area (> 73 m2/g), large pore diameter (>4.4 nm) and relatively large pore volume (>0.1 cm3/g). All these properties were the indication of a well-formed mesoporous material that enhanced the excellent dispersion of the active metals on the support.

3.1.5. Raman Spectroscopy
Fig. 8 presents the Raman analysis of the prepared catalysts within the range of 50-1200 cm-1. The peak at Raman shift of about 995 cm-1 attributed to stretching vibration of terminal Mo = O in two dimensional polymolybdates. The intensity decreased slightly with increasing the La2O3 contents. This corresponded to crystalline MoO3, which corroborate with the results obtained in the XRD analysis [76]. Peaks at 820 and 665 cm-1 indicate the presence of Mo-O-Mo stretch in the polymeric or crystalline structure of molybdena species. Mo-O-Mo deformation was observed at a band of 158 cm-1 [53][77]. The bands at 379 and 335 cm-1 are Mo = O bending, which decreased with increasing La2O3 contents. The Raman bands at 665, 820 and 995 cm-1 matched orthorhombic MoO3. The monoclinic of MoO2 bands at 461, 495, 571, 589 and 744 cm-1 were not observed [78]. The weakest attached bridging oxygen atoms in Mo-O (long distance bond of 195 pm) appeared along the c-axis unlike the shorter bonds in Mo = O along the a-axis and b-axis (167 and 173 pm respectively). This observation suggests that the superior production of oxygen in MoO3 can be towards the c-axis. Consequently, it can be anticipated that there will be a displacement of atomic Mo along the terminal oxygen in the b-axis direction due to the loss of the b linking oxygen. As a result, the terminal oxygen bond in the a-direction is weakened [79] [80].

3.1.6. H2–Temperature Programmed Reduction
The redox property of the ODH catalyst plays a crucial role in the activation of light alkane to alkene. H2-TPR is a useful tool used to study the reducibility of the catalysts and the amount of lattice oxygen available for reaction. The TPR profiles of the synthesized catalysts show two distinct peaks, which can be ascribed to the sequential reduction of MoO3 to MoO2 and subsequently to Mo [81] (Fig. 9).

The peak between 100 - 450 ℃ (α) is attributed to the reduction oligomer of MoOx or small clusters of MoOx, while the high temperature reduction peak, positioned about 700 - 750 ℃ (β) was due to reduction of monomeric species of MoOx [82]. Among the studies catalysts, MoO3/γ-Al2O3 reduced with an onset temperature of 345 ℃ and a reduction maximum at 400 ℃, which indicates the reduction from Mo6+ to Mo4+ [83]. The addition of La2O3 shifted the lower temperature reduction peak from 400 ℃ to 450 ℃, indicating that the reduction from Mo6+ to Mo4+ was faster with the catalyst without La2O3 content (MoO3/Al2O3) or there was a decrease in reducibility of M6+ to M4+ as a result of the La2O3 incorporation. The reduction peak at high temperature was almost same (760 ℃) for all the catalysts except for MoO3/La-γAl2O3 1:1, which has its second reduction peak around 645 ℃. This clearly indicate that, the addition of La2O3 tend to improve the reducibility of the catalyst at higher temperatures. The second reduction peak for catalyst MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 1:2, MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 1:3 and MoO3/γAl2O3 is attributed to the reduction of Mo4+ to Mo0+.
Table 2 shows the percentage H2 uptake of the different series of catalyst synthesized. At lower reduction temperature, MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 1:1 recorded the highest amount of H2 (46.2%) consumed whiles MoO3/γAl2O3 recorded the lowest percentage reduction of 21%. This indicate that, at lower temperature, MoO3/ La2O3-γAl2O3 1:1 is capable of giving up more lattice oxygen as compared to MoO3/γAl2O3. However, at higher reduction temperatures, the catalyst without La2O3 (MoO3/γAl2O3) showed the maximum reducibility (71.1%). This can be attributed to the fact that, the lattice oxygen MoO3/γAl2O3 were readily available at higher temperatures. Therefore, the addition of lanthanum to the catalyst support enhanced both the catalyst reducibility and oxygen carrying capacity.

3.1.7. NH3-Temperature Programmed Desorption
The acid-base characterization of a catalyst demonstrates its essential role in terms of catalyst performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. An optimum acid-base characteristics (moderate acid-base site strength) is a key to secure high olefin selectivity during the ODH of propane reactions. The NH3-temperature programmed desorption is used to evaluate the strength and the availability of acid sites for adsorption on the catalyst. Ammonia can easily be adsorbed to acidic sites of a catalyst due to its basic nature. The increase in the desorption temperature is directly proportional to the strength of acidity of the catalyst [84]. The strength of acid site on a catalyst can be grouped according to the temperature of NH3 desorption as strong (500-600 ℃), intermediate (300-500 ℃) and weak (120-300 ℃) [85]. The product of desorption is mainly NH3 with no traces of N2, NO and N2O indicating that there was no reaction on the catalyst surface. On a plot of acidity against temperature, the area under the curve gives an idea the relative amount of acid site present, that is, the lager the NH3 desorption area, the higher the amount of acid site (the strong acid site of a catalyst is identified by desorption of NH3 at higher temperatures) [86]. NH3-TPD profiles of the synthesized catalysts are shown in Fig. 10, while Table 3 summarize the acidity of the catalysts. One can see that all the catalysts displayed two distinct peaks at low and elevated temperatures indicating the presence of two types of acid sites. All catalyst samples have almost the same initial peak temperature centered at 200 ℃, which corresponds to the desorption of chemisorbed ammonia at weak to moderate acidic site of the catalyst. The amount of weak to moderate acid site of the catalyst was related to the area under the curve at lower temperatures (100-400℃) which was almost the same for all the samples. The high-temperature reduction peaks are associated with the strong acid sites. In general, the amount of strong acid sites and the peak temperature of the samples decrease as the amount of La2O3 added to the alumina support increases (in the case of MoO3/γ-Al2O3, the maxima peak temperature was centered at 650 ℃, which decreases to 610 and 580 ℃ for MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 (1:3) and MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 (1:1) respectively. This can be attributed to the presence of lanthanum in the support that creates Al-O-La species as a result of the inter-diffusion of AL3+/La3+ cation that modifies and reduces the acidity of the catalyst [87]. In summary, the ranking of the synthesized catalyst in order of acidity was found to be MoO3/γAl2O3 > MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O31:3 > MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O31:2 > MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O31:1 (Table 3). This shows that the distribution of acidity was not the same for all the catalyst. The acidity of the synthesized catalyst decreased as the amount of La2O3 added to the support increases as results of the formation of a La2O3 basic monolayer also this may be due to the decrease in surface area.

3.2. Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane with Lattice Oxygen
The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane experiments were conducted with MoO3/γAl2O3 and MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 catalysts using a fluidized CREC Riser Simulator under gas phase oxygen free conditions. In order to ensure the reproducibility of the catalytic results, the experiments were repeated and the mole balance were carried out based on the hydrocarbons and COx (CO2+CO). The overall mole balance were consistently closed with a standard deviation of ± 5 %, indicating an acceptable range of experimental error. Table 4 summarizes the typical product distributions of the ODH of propane using lattice oxygen of the catalysts. One can see from the table that propylene, ethylene and COx (CO2+CO) were the major products under the studied reaction conditions. In addition, a small fraction of methane and ethane were also observed as undesired products. No coke was detected on the catalyst, as confirmed by TGA analysis of the spent catalysts. Both the propane conversions and product selectivity significantly varied with the variation of the catalyst composition, the reaction temperature and introduction of CO2 with the feed. In case of CO2 assisted ODH experiment, the CO2 selectivity was calculated after deducting the feed CO2. The 0% CO2 selectivity recorded means that, CO2 was not generated in those reactions as a results of deep oxidation, ie, the amount of CO2 fed was approximately same as the amount in the product stream.

Therefore, careful selection of the after mentioned parameters are very important in order to maximize the desired propylene/ethylene selectivity and minimize the complete combustion to produce CO2, as a waste product. The preliminary experiments also indicated that the catalyst with high La2O3/γAl2O3 ratio of 1:1 was not favorable for propylene selectivity in the absence of CO2. Consequently, this catalyst was not included in the further evaluation. In order to investigate the effects of CO2, the ODH of propane experiments were conducted both with and without injection of CO2 with the feed.
3.2.1. Propane conversion and products selectivity without CO2
Fig. 11 shows the conversion of propane at different reaction temperatures using various catalysts. One can see that the conversion of propane increased with increasing reaction temperature, which was consistent to the reduction behavior of the catalysts, as observed in H2-TPR analysis (Fig. 9, Table 2). With increasing reaction temperature, the lattice oxygen of the catalysts activated and easily reacted with increased number of propane molecules. Consequently, the propylene conversion increased with temperature. The endothermic nature of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane was also favored by the increasing reaction temperature. When compared among the catalysts, the conversion of propane slightly decreased with the La2O3 containing catalysts. The highest propane conversion of 75% (at 600 ⁰C) was achieved with unpromoted MoO3/γAl2O3 catalyst, which decreased to 64% as La2O3 was introduced in the catalyst (MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 1:2). A similar decreasing trend of hydrocarbon conversion was also reported in Liu et al [88] due to the incorporation of La2O3 in the catalysts. In general, the decrease in conversion of propane can be correlated to the reduced acidity, decreased oxygen carrying capacity and lower specific surface area of the La2O3 containing catalysts, as observed in NH3-TPD analysis (Table 3), H2-TPR analysis (Table 2) and BET surface area measurements (Table 1), respectively. The higher acidity and BET surface area of MoO3/γAl2O3 catalyst allowed increased number of propane molecule to interact with the active sites of the catalyst, resulting in higher propane conversion.

Regarding the desired products selectivity, one can clearly see that the incorporation of La2O3 enhanced the selectivity of propylene and ethylene significantly (Fig. 12, Fig. 13). Although, the selectivity of propylene decreased with reaction temperature, it was balanced by ethylene and COx (CO2 + CO) selectivities (Fig. 13, Fig. 14). Combination of cracking and oxidative dehydrogenation of propylene to ethylene and deep oxidation of propylene/ethylene to COx were the possible routes of decreasing propylene selectivity with increasing reaction temperature. Generally, the high reaction temperature favors both the cracking and deep oxidation reactions given the catalyst become more active towards these reactions at high temperature [89]. The H2-TPR and the Raman analysis of the catalysts also confirmed the availability of highly reducible metal oxides at relatively higher temperatures because of weakening binding energy of the lattice oxygen. This weakly bonded surface oxygen sites are primarily responsible for deep oxidation of propane and propylene/ethylene to COx. Consequently, COx selectivity increased as the propane conversion increased, while the opposite trends were observed between propane conversion propylene selectivity. The relation between the propylene selectivity and reaction temperature can be further established by comparing the effects of La2O3 in the catalysts, as it also influenced the reducibility and acidity of the catalysts. Among the evaluated samples, MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 1:2 showed highest propylene selectivity (83% at 575 ℃) and lowest COx selectivity (15.5% at 575 ℃). It appears that the La2O3/γAl2O3 ratio of 1:2 controlled the non-selective sites on the catalyst, which were responsible for excessive cracking and deep oxidation. The balance of acidity also played an important role in determining propylene selectivity, as high acidity of the catalyst promotes cracking to give undesired products. The incorporation of La2O3 decreased the acidity of the samples and the La2O3/γAl2O3 ratio of 1:2 provided the moderate acidity of MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 1:2 contributing for the its high propylene selectivity [90].

The CO2 (Fig. 14a) and CO (Fig. 14b) selectivities appeared to be decreased with the increase of La2O3 content in the catalysts. The highest selectivities of CO2 and CO were found with unpromoted MoO3/γ-Al2O3, while the lowest CO2 and CO selectivities were measured with MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 1:2. The CO2 and CO selectivities were also consistent to the high propylene selectivity of the MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 1:2 catalyst. On the contrary, the unpromoted MoO3/γAl2O3 sample showed higher COx (CO2+CO) selectivity and lower propylene selectivity. These observations can also (in addition to less amount of weakly bonded oxygen) be attributed to the reduction in the acidity of the catalyst due to the introduction of La2O3 as shown in the NH3-TPD analysis report (Table 3). The acidic nature of CO2 enabled its adsorption on the basic sites of La2O3 of the mixed La2O3-γAl2O3 support, which minimized interaction of propane/propylene with these sites for deep oxidations [91][92][93]. Consequently, the adsorption of CO2 on the non-olefin selective sites not only helped to minimize the products oxidation, but also increased propylene selectivity by keeping them away from deep oxidation [94][95] [96] [97].
3.2.2. Effects of CO2 in the Feed
In order to demonstrate the effects of CO2 in the feed, experiments were conducted with excess amount of CO2 co-injected with propane. In this regard, the MoO3/La2O3-γAl2O3 1:2 catalyst was considered, as it showed the highest propylene selectivity and lowest CO2 selectivity with an appreciable level of propane conversion, as discussed above. Fig. 15 compares the propane conversion at various reaction temperature with and without the addition of CO2 in the feed. Interestingly, the propane conversions significantly increased when CO2 was co-fed along with propane. The superior propane conversion in the presence of CO2 was attributed to the direct interaction between propane and CO2 to form propylene and CO and water as by-products. The reverse water-gas shift reaction may also be a contributing factor to the high propane conversion as well as olefin selectivity as seen in Figs. 15, 16 and 17. In addition, the injected CO2 could also have facilitated the insitu catalyst re-oxidation, which eventually contributed to the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (further discussion to follow). The contribution of Boudourd reaction to CO formation was most likely minimal; as it required higher reaction temperature (> 680 ℃) and pressure than the employed reaction temperature (525-600 ℃) and pressure (1 atm) of this study [98],[99] [100].

Concerning the desired product selectivity, one can see that both propylene and ethylene selectivity were significantly higher with CO2 co-fed experiments than the experiments without CO2, except at 600 ℃ (Fig. 16, Fig. 17). The addition of CO2 in feed could have blocked the non-selective electrophilic sites, which contributed to the formation of undesired products [101][102]. The excess CO2 in the reaction mixture also influenced the thermodynamic equilibrium of the complete oxidation reactions to minimize further oxidation of propylene to CO2. On the contrary, at 600 ℃ deep oxidation dominated the oxidative dehydrogenation, consequently the selectivity of propylene and ethylene dropped.
In order to better understanding the effects of CO2, one should consider the following possible reactions steps during the ODH of propane with lattice oxygen of the catalysts in absence/presence of CO2:

In the context of above reaction schemes, one can consider three major roles of CO2 with the feed: (i) influence on the thermodynamic equilibrium of the complete oxidation reactions to minimize CO2 formation, (ii) direct interaction with propane to give propylene (Eq. 11), and (iii) re-oxidizing the oxygen depleted catalysts (Eq. 16). In addition, CO2 may also contribute to dehydrogenation of propane by converting hydrogen via reverse water gas shift reaction (Eq. 12 an Eq. 13) and oxidize carbon by Boudouard reaction (Eq. 14). In order to ascertain these facts, the following experiments were conducted with successive propane injection without catalyst re-oxidation followed by combined CO2 and propane injection. During the successive propane injection, the catalyst gradually reduced to oxygen deficient system, while the combined CO2/propane injection allowed the catalyst to re-oxidize upon interaction with CO2.
3.2.3. Successive Propane Injections – Without and With CO2
Fig. 18 presents the propane conversion and propylene selectivity for seven successive propane injections without catalyst regeneration by air circulation (as done in the previous experiments). The first five consecutive runs were conducted by injecting propane only, without catalyst regeneration, while in the last two experiments, propane was co-fed with CO2 at propane/CO2 ratios of 1:2 and 1:3, respectively. The highest propane conversion of 42% was obtained in the first injection, as the catalyst was at fully oxidized state. Following the first injection, the propane conversion gradually decreased to 33% within five injections. The initial high propane conversion was ascribed to the availability of weakly bonded surface lattice oxygen of the fully oxidized catalyst, which contributed to the activation of C-H bond of propane to give propylene and carbon oxides. The decrease in propane conversion during the following injection was due to the depletion of the surface and lattice oxygen of the catalyst. On the other hand, the propylene selectivity increased from an initial 33% to 42% during the successive propane injections. The increase in propane selectivity in the consecutive propane injection was attributed to major contribution of the lattice oxygen, given the surface oxygen gives complete oxidation products. In the first injection, the catalyst was fully oxidized and it contained weakly bonded surface oxygen, which was more selective to deep oxidation of propane and propylene. In the following injections, the depletion of the non-selective lattice oxygen helped to increase the propylene selectivity. Panov et al. [103] reported that electrophilic nature of the weakly bonded surface oxygen of the catalysts were responsible for complete oxidation. On the other hand, the nucleophilic nature of the strongly bonded lattice oxygen contributed to selective oxidation of hydrocarbon to desired olefin products.

Fig. 18. Propane conversion and selectivity of propylene over MoO3/γ-Al2O3 in consecutive propane injection without catalyst regeneration. The first 5 consecutive injections are propane only, the 6th and 7th are C3H8 with CO2 in ratio 1:2 and 1:3 respectively.
During the last two injections (i.e. runs 6 and 7), propane was co-fed with CO2 to demonstrate the effects of CO2. One can clearly see that the introduction of CO2 increased the propane conversion from 33 % to 35 % and propylene selectivity from 42 % to 45 %. After the seventh injection, the propane conversion and propylene selectivity further increased to 36% and 48%, respectively because of the increased CO2 concentration in the reaction mixture. This is an indication that CO2 has promotional effects on propane ODH as it influences the thermodynamic equilibrium of the complete oxidation reactions to minimize CO2 formation, CO2 reacts directly with propane over the catalyst surface to produce propylene, and re-oxidizes the oxygen depleted catalysts [104][35][105]. Thus, CO2 may be acting as an adsorbate, which covers the non-olefin selective sites of the catalyst to minimize oxidation of propylene. Again, the increase in propane conversion in the presence of CO2 may also be partly attributed to the reverse water-gas shift reaction (Eq. 13), which consumes H2 generated from direct propane dehydrogenation (Eq. 12) to enhance the propylene selectivity as the forward reaction is favored.
Table 5 compares the performance of the catalyst of the present study with the catalysts reported in the open literature for the ODH of propane to propylene with CO2. In this regard, propane conversion, propylene selectivity and yields were considered. Zhang et al. [14] reported a propane conversion of 48%, a propylene selectivity of 86% using Cr/ZSM-5 catalyst with a propane to CO2 ratio of 1:2 at 500 ℃. In addition, Xie et al. [106] investigated the use of 7% Cr-ZrO2 for the ODH of propane to propylene in CO2 environment and they reported a propylene yields of 40.5%. Michorczyk et al [107] and Yun et al. [108] reported a propylene yields of 32% and 23%, respectively for the application of chromium-based catalyst for the ODH of propane in the presence of CO2 as soft oxidant. Although, chromium-based catalysts showed good activity, they are prone to deactivation due to coke deposition, and pose health related problems due their toxicity [109]. The aforementioned factors are some of the main reasons for the active search for alternative catalyst system to substitute the chromium-based catalyst for alkane ODH. From the present work, we can confidently propose molybdenum-based catalyst as one of the suitable alternatives as they also possess relatively high catalytic activity for propane ODH with CO2 coupled with high stability.

4. Conclusion
This study employed fluidizable MoO3/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 catalysts with varying La2O3 content for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 as a soft oxidant. It was found that the incorporation of La2O3 moderates the surface acidity of the catalyst sample, improves its reducibility, and enhanced its overall performance on the ODH of propane with or without CO2. In general, propane conversion declined slightly while propylene selectivity increased with increasing La2O3 content. It was also observed that the basic La2O3 hindered the non-olefin selective sites of γ-Al2O3, which are responsible for deep oxidation of propylene and propane. MoO3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst displayed the highest propane conversion in the absence of CO2 in the propane ODH experiment which was attributed to its suitable acidity, texture and morphology. However, the incorporation of La2O3 enhanced the propylene selectivity and decreased the formation of undesired products. The presence of CO2 in the feed showed considerable influence on the catalytic activity as well as the propylene selectivity which may be due to its poisoning effect by blocking the non-olefin selective sites available on the catalyst. This study also demonstrates that CO2 is capable of partially re-oxidizing reduced catalyst by replacing the selective lattice oxygen which improves olefin selectivity. Finally, the synthesized catalysts displayed high olefins (ethylene and propylene) selectivity and significant stability over a number of consecutive reactions cycles and could be used in an industrial fluidized bed reactor.

    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
