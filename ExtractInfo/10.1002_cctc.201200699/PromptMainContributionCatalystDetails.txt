Enhancing Oxidative Dehydrogenation Selectivity of Ceria-Based Catalysts with Phosphorus as Additive
Graphical Abstract
Rise to the top: A series of phosphated ceria catalysts were studied and presented an increase in oxidative dehydrogenation selectivity with respect to pure ceria, mainly at the expense of total oxidation selectivity. Thus, the selectivity to propene was approximately 74 % with surface-phosphated catalysts and 62 % with bulk-phosphated catalysts.
Abstract
Surface- and bulk-phosphated ceria catalysts were prepared and studied in propane oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) at 823 and 873 K. The catalysts were characterized by N2 adsorption at 77 K, XRD, TEM, and diffuse reflectance IR Fourier transform (DRIFT), Raman, X-ray photoelectron (XPS), and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopies. Both series of catalysts presented an increase in the ODH selectivity with respect to pure ceria mainly at the expense of total oxidation selectivity. Thus, the selectivity to propene was approximately 74 % with surface-phosphated catalysts and 62 % with bulk-phosphated catalysts. For the surface-phosphated samples, P is confined to the surface and subsurface regions of the ceria particles, whereas P is also dispersed in the bulk of the oxide in the bulk-phosphated samples. Finally, all the characterization techniques led us to the conclusion that Ce4+ cations that interact with P are responsible for the observed increase in the ODH.
Introduction
Propene has known a steady increase in demand over the last decade as it is the raw material for the production of polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and other important products.1, 2 More than 60 % of propylene is used for the production of polypropylene, a material with a wide range of applications from textiles to medical sutures and piping systems, the demand of which has also known a steady increase over recent years.3
The main procedure to produce propene is steam cracking, which is one of the most energy consuming processes in the chemical industry. Fluid catalytic cracking and propane dehydrogenation are also used but to a lesser extent.4 Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane may offer a promising alternative for the production of propene compared to traditional methods. ODH has the advantage of an exothermic reaction without thermodynamic limitations and with a low risk of catalyst deactivation through coking because the reaction is performed in an oxidative environment. A wide variety of catalytic systems has been proposed for this reaction, the most studied of which are based on V5–16 or Mo.17–25 Though scarcely studied, other transition-metal-based catalytic materials could exhibit comparable catalytic efficiencies.26–36 Although it has been intensively studied for a long time, the conventional ODH of propane is still far from industrial application.37 The main difficulty to obtain high propene yields by the ODH of propane arises from the higher reactivity of propene than propane, which makes propene prone to further oxidation to produce COx. Nevertheless, ODH is already used in industry to convert propane into propene in a two-step process. For example, in the STAR (steam active reforming, Uhde) process, a conventional dehydrogenation step is followed by an oxidation step in which O2 is admitted to the system to convert H2 into water, which shifts the equilibrium of the dehydrogenation reaction to the products side.38
To be effective, a catalyst needs first of all to be selective (i.e., to produce minimal amounts of undesired products) and its activity is the second concern. To meet the selectivity challenge, Grasselli and Callahan39 considered active-site isolation as a basic approach. Active-site isolation is a model based on the idea that selective oxidation requires a smaller amount of O2 than total oxidation. Accordingly, the limitation of oxygen availability around the active site determines a decrease of the selectivity toward total oxidation in favor of selective oxidation.40 The original model developed for the U-Sb-O catalyst41, 42 showed that the dissolution of a redox-active component (uranium oxide) in a redox-stable matrix (antimony oxide) at an optimum dilution led to an increased selectivity for acrolein in the selective oxidation of propene.
Another approach considered to increase the selectivity in the partial oxidation was the decrease of the mobility of the lattice oxygen. A high mobility of the lattice oxygen is one of the key features of metal oxides that are used as total oxidation catalysts.43
The aim of this study was to investigate how these approaches fit into the selective oxidation of propane by using ceria as a base material. Ceria, as a result of its high lattice-oxygen mobility, high oxygen-storage capacity, and ease of exchange of surface lattice-oxygen with gas-phase oxygen44, 45 appeared to be a good catalyst candidate for total oxidation reactions.46 Therefore, one of the goals of this study was to limit the oxygen availability around the active site or/and the oxygen mobility in the lattice of the solid. Notably, a relatively large variety of ceria-based materials has already been studied as catalysts for selective oxidation.47
The incorporation of other cations into the lattice of ceria has been the object of numerous studies over the last two decades. It has been shown that dopants can increase the stability of ceria toward sintering, and the addition of Zr to form ceria-zirconia solid solutions is the most prominent example.48 Upon doping with lower valence cations such as Ca2+,49 La3+,50 or Gd3+,51 an increase in the oxygen-storage capacity can be obtained owing to the formation of oxygen vacancies as a result of the incorporation of these cations into the lattice of ceria. It has also been shown that the total oxidation activity of ceria can be increased with the aid of dopants that enhance its oxygen-storage capacity.52–54 On the other hand, it has been shown that metal-doped ceria materials can be used as catalysts for selective H2 oxidation from a mixture of H2, propane, and propene. These catalysts are stable and display a range of oxidation activities and selectivites, which are strongly dependent on the type and amount of dopant.55, 56
The addition of P to metal oxides and supported-metal-oxide-based catalysts has been shown to improve their catalytic performances in the ODH of light alkanes,57–62 but there is not yet a consensus on the nature of the effect that leads to this improvement as the role of P is dependent on the system to which it is introduced. Thus, in the case of surface-phosphated silica and alumina, DFT calculations have shown that the presence of P decreases the activation energy of the rate-limiting step of the catalytic reaction by approximately 10 kcal mol−1.57 For Cr/TiO2 catalysts, the addition of P was reported to isolate Cr3+ in octahedral sites, which was thought to be responsible for the improved catalytic performances.58 For chromium oxide supported on P-modified alumina, the interaction between P and surface-dispersed chromate species weakens the CrO bond and retards their aggregation to Cr2O3, which leads to an increased selectivity to propylene.62 In the case of V2O5 supported on TiO2, the interaction between P and V species affects the reducibility of V, which led to a better selectivity for the ODH of propane.59 The exact role of P was unclear in alumina-supported and unsupported MoOx with V and P additives. However, the formation of the isolated patches of Mo and V oxo species has been suggested.60 For unsupported MoOx, the presence of P seems to be responsible for the formation of a [PMo11V] heteropolyanion in which a more intimate interaction between V and P occurs to lead to better catalytic performances.61
In the specific case of ceria, it was previously reported that the deposition of phosphate groups in quantities large enough to generate the formation of superficial cerium(III) phosphate (monazite) favors an increase in the selectivity of ODH for isobutane to isobutene.63 This was assigned to the lower redox ability of CeIV in interaction with the CePO4 phase.64 It was also suggested that contamination of ceria by P blocks the Ce4+/Ce3+ redox couple, which decreases the lattice-oxygen mobility through the formation of CeOP bonds.65–68 Based on this state of the art we investigated the effect of doping ceria with P on the selectivity of the ODH of propane by using two different preparation routes.
Results and discussion
Catalyst preparation and characterization
Surface-phosphated ceria catalysts 0.01P@CeO2, 0.1P@CeO2, 0.3P@CeO2, and 0.9P@CeO2 were prepared by the addition of solutions of NH4H2PO4 at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.9 m, respectively, to finely ground ceria powder.
Bulk-phosphated ceria catalysts 0.5P-CeO2, 1P-CeO2, 2P-CeO2, and 4P-CeO2 with P/(P+Ce) atomic ratios of 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04, respectively, were prepared by the addition of specific amounts of NH4H2PO4 to a concentrated ammonia solution that was then used for the precipitation of ceria.
The mean of the energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses used to measure the chemical compositions of the catalysts is presented in Table 1. As expected, for the surface-phosphated samples, the P content in the catalysts was higher for the samples phosphated with a more concentrated NH4H2PO4 solution. For the bulk-phosphated samples, a good correspondence between the nominal and experimental P/(P+Ce) ratio was measured.

The surface areas of the solids are given in Table 1. For the surface-phosphated samples, the surface areas slightly decreased with increasing P content, which is in accordance with previously reported results.63, 65 For the bulk-phosphated samples, no correlation can be made between the P content and the evolution of the surface area.
The XRD patterns of pure ceria and surface-phosphated samples are displayed in Figure 1. For all the solids, reflections that correspond to well-crystallized cubic CeO2 fluorite were observed (PDF # 34-0394). Much weaker reflections that correspond to cerium(III) phosphate (PDF # 83-0652) were also observed in 0.9P@CeO2. Figure 2 displays the XRD patterns of the bulk-phosphated ceria samples and pure ceria for comparison. Notably, only reflections that correspond to the pure CeO2 phase were observed in these samples, which may indicate a good dispersion of P in the ceria.

The diffuse reflectance IR Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra of the surface- and bulk-phosphated samples are displayed in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. The signals in the region of 1700–1200 cm−1 correspond to the vibrations of the superficial bi-coordinated carbonate species (≈1320 and 1550 cm−1) and the superficial OH groups (≈1635 cm−1).69, 70 The presence of carbonate species is rather usual in ceria and related materials and is determined to be from the adsorption of atmospheric CO2 onto the basic sites of these materials.71 For the surface-phosphated solids, the signals at approximately 1320 and 1550 cm−1 decreased in intensity with increasing P content, which suggests a decrease in the basicity. In the case of the bulk-phosphated samples, however, the intensity of the peaks associated with the surface carbonate species remained almost constant upon the addition of P irrespective of its content. This could be good evidence for the small extent of the presence of P on the surface of the material.

Raman spectroscopy provided complementary information. Figure 5 illustrates the Raman spectra of pure and of some phosphated ceria samples. All spectra present a prominent band at approximately 465 cm−1, which corresponds to the triply degenerate F2g Raman active mode of the fluorite structure and can be viewed as a symmetric breathing mode of the O atoms around the Ce ions.72 In line with the XRD analysis, the lines at 969, 990, and 1051 cm−1 account for the presence of the CePO4 phase in 0.9P@CeO2.65 On close inspection, one can observe that the line at 969 cm−1, although very weak, is also present in the Raman spectrum of 0.3P@CeO2. The absence of any reflection assigned to the CePO4 phase in the XRD pattern may be evidence for the existence of very small crystallite sizes of this phase in 0.3P@CeO2. None of the bulk-phosphated ceria samples presented lines in the Raman spectra that indicate the presence of CePO4.

The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) of the Ce 3d3/2 and Ce 3d5/2 core levels of selected solids are presented in Figure 6. According to thoroughly accepted convention,73, 74 the six peaks (three pairs of spin-orbit doublets) present in the spectrum of pure CeIV oxide were labeled in order of decreasing energy as U′′′, U′′, U (corresponding to the Ce 3d3/2 level) and V′′′, V′′, V (corresponding to the Ce 3d5/2 level). The spectrum of pure CeIII oxide presents four peaks (two pairs of spin-orbit doublets) which are labeled in order of decreasing energy as U′, U0 (corresponding to the Ce 3d3/2 level) and V′, V0 (corresponding to the Ce 3d5/2 level). If both CeIII and CeIV species are present in an oxide, the resulting spectrum is a superposition of all of these ten features. The values of the characteristic binding energies of these ten features present in the XPS spectra of CeIII and CeIV were taken from Ref. 75 The isolated U′′′ peak is a fingerprint of CeIV and can be taken as a semiquantitative index of the reduction of ceria.65 The intensity of this peak appears to decrease with increasing P content for both the surface- and bulk-phosphated solids. Another characteristic of a pure CeIV oxide is a well defined valley between the V and V′′ peaks. As shown in Figure 6, this valley becomes less pronounced with increasing P content for both the surface- and bulk-phosphated samples owing to the increase in the intensity of the V′ feature, characteristic of CeIII. It is apparent that the increase of the P content produces a reduction of the cerium oxide, which is in agreement with previous studies.63, 65, 67

A comparison of the P/Ce ratios obtained from XPS and EDX revealed that for all samples, P was concentrated in the surface and subsurface regions. However, for bulk-phosphated samples, the P/Ce ratio obtained from XPS was smaller than that of surface-phosphated samples at similar concentrations of P determined by EDX (Figure 7).

TEM micrographs of surface-phosphated 0.9P@CeO2 and bulk-phosphated 4P-CeO2 materials are presented in Figure 8. In contrast with those of the bulk-phosphated ceria, the particles in the surface-phosphated ceria are more agglomerated, which is in line with the lower surface area observed for this sample. This may be a result of the higher surface P content in 0.9P@CeO2.

In conclusion, the physicochemical characteristics of the two series of catalysts suggest that P is concentrated in the surface and subsurface regions of the ceria particles irrespective of the way they were synthesized and the loading of P. However, for the bulk-phosphated catalysts, the P content is lower in the surface and subsurface regions than that of the surface-phosphated samples with a similar P concentration.
Catalytic testing
The catalytic performances of the prepared catalysts in the ODH of propane are presented in Table 2. For all the catalysts, the conversion of propane increased with the reaction temperature and, except for CeO2, the selectivity to propene decreased to the benefit of cracking products and, especially, COx. For all of the studied catalysts, the sum of the selectivities to COx and CH4 was always higher than that of ethylene. This suggests that, in this temperature range, the total oxidation products were formed not only from C1 species that result from the cracking of propane but also by the direct oxidation of propane or further oxidation of propene.

For the surface-phosphated samples, the selectivity to propene increased with increasing of P content to reach a plateau at P contents higher than 0.8 at % (at %=atomic percent, Table 2). Thus, for 0.3P@CeO2 and 0.9P@CeO2 in which the CePO4 phase becomes detectable by Raman spectroscopy, the selectivity for ODH remained almost unchanged but was more than double that of pure ceria. Notably, the increase in ODH selectivity was achieved mainly at the expense of total oxidation selectivity. At the same time, the addition of P to ceria led to a decrease of the catalytic activity, however, a further increase of its content led to an increase of the catalytic activity, which passes through a maximum at a P content of 0.8 at % (0.3P@CeO2). These results suggest that for surface-phosphated samples, the active and selective sites for ODH are Ce4+ cations that interact with P, which was suggested in a previous study.63 Once the amount of phosphate groups in the surface and subsurface region of ceria is high enough, CePO4 begins to nucleate, and the addition of more P leads to the growth of CePO4 crystals.67 Taking into consideration that the interaction of Ce4+ cations with phosphate groups is the cause of the reduced oxygen mobility and reduced oxygen-storage capacity,67 the correlation between the increased selectivity and P content may thus be explained. However, the selectivity for ODH of the surface-phosphated samples does not pass through a maximum value at a certain P content, which would be expected for a catalyst that fully obeys the site-isolation principle.40 This suggests that Ce4+ species isolation takes place only at a low P content, whereas at P contents higher than 0.8 at % (at which CePO4 begins to nucleate) new catalytic sites selective for the ODH reaction were formed. Notably, CePO4 that contains Ce4+ species as impurities has also been shown to be a selective catalyst for the ODH of isobutane.76
The stability of the surface-phosphated catalysts was evaluated in the reaction for an on-stream time of 40 h. Figure 9 presents the evolution of the conversion and selectivity for the 0.1P@CeO2 catalyst. These data demonstrate that the catalysts maintained their catalytic activity under the reaction conditions for the 40 h of on-stream reaction.

For the bulk-phosphated solids, an increase in the ODH selectivity is also observed with increasing P content, mainly at the expense of total oxidation selectivity (Table 2). However, the increase is smaller than that observed for surface-phosphated samples, probably because of the lower surface concentration of Ce4+ cations that interact with P. These data suggest that this interaction provides the selective catalytic sites, which is in line with both the surface chemical analysis (Figure 1) and the DRIFT spectra (Figures 3 and 4). As in the case of surface-phosphated ceria, the catalytic activity decreased upon addition of P to the ceria, but a further increase of the P content led to an increase of the activity/selectivity, which confirms that the association of Ce4+ cations with P corresponds to the active sites.
Different behavior was observed for 4P-CeO2, which has the highest quantity of P in the bulk-phosphated series. At both reaction temperatures, an oscillating behavior was observed. High conversions corresponded to high total oxidation selectivity, whereas low conversions corresponded to high ODH selectivity. This effect could be justified by the formation of coke deposits on the surface of the catalyst, which grow until they are burned off by the gas-phase O2 to produce CO2 and give rise to the observed increase in total oxidation selectivity. The accumulation of coke deposits on the catalyst are likely caused by a decrease in lattice-oxygen mobility because of the presence of P in a higher quantity.67 The reduced lattice-oxygen mobility would determine a slow reoxidation of the catalytic sites, which would lead to adsorbed hydrocarbonate species.
The influence of the propane conversion on the propene selectivity has been studied over CeO2, 0.3P@CeO2, and 2P-CeO2 at 823 K and a propane-to-oxygen molar ratio of 2, by varying the volume hourly space velocity (VHSV) in the range 3000–12 000 h−1 (Figure 10). As expected, for the three catalysts the selectivity to propene decreased with increasing conversion. At isoconversion, the highest propene selectivity was observed for 0.3P@CeO2 and then decreased following the order 0.3P@CeO2>2P-CeO2>CeO2. The extrapolation to zero conversion led to nonzero but very low selectivity for cracking products for all the catalysts, which indicates that they were among the primary products, likely a result of the relatively high reaction temperature. In the case of CeO2, the same extrapolation revealed that both propene and CO2 are primary products in comparable amounts. For 2P-CeO2, the main primary product is propene with minor amounts of CO2, whereas only propene is the primary oxidation product for 0.3P@CeO2. These results suggest that, for CeO2 the total oxidation product (CO2) was formed by both the direct oxidation of propane and further oxidation of propene, whereas for the phosphated samples, CO2 was formed by the further oxidation of propene rather than by the direct oxidation of propane.

Conclusions
The addition of P to ceria and its increased content produces an increase in propane ODH selectivity at the expense of total oxidation selectivity for both surface- and bulk-phosphated ceria catalysts. The deactivation of the ceria catalyst and the formation of active sites selective for ODH that consist of Ce4+ cations that interact with P are the main causes for the observed increase in ODH selectivity.
The isolation of Ce4+ species occurs only at a low P content, whereas CePO4 starts to nucleate and new catalytic sites selective for ODH were formed at a high P content.
Bulk doping ceria with P did not produce homogeneous materials. In this case, the increase in the selectivity was smaller than of the surface-phosphated samples, most likely a result of a lower surface concentration of Ce4+ cations that interact with P. This was most probably associated with a decrease of the lattice-oxygen mobility.
Experimental Section
Catalyst preparation
Ceria was prepared according to a procedure inspired by the literature.77 Thus, a solution of Ce(NO3)3 was added dropwise to a large excess of concentrated ammonia solution. After precipitation, the obtained hydroxide was centrifuged and washed repeatedly until the supernatant remained opalescent after centrifugation. The separated solid was dried for 12 h at 373 K and calcined for 6 h in air at 973 K (heating rate of 2 K min−1).
Surface-phosphated ceria was prepared by adding to finely ground ceria powder (2 cm3) solutions of NH4H2PO4 (4 cm3) at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, and 0.9 M. The resulting suspension was stirred for 30 min, left to settle, and then the clear solution was removed by decantation. The remaining wet solid was dried for 12 h at 373 K and calcined for 6 h in air at 973 K (heating rate of 2 K min−1). The obtained solids were labeled as 0.01P@CeO2, 0.1P@CeO2, 0.3P@CeO2, and 0.9P@CeO2, respectively.
Bulk-phosphated ceria were prepared by adding specific amounts of NH4H2PO4 to a concentrated ammonia solution that was used for the precipitation of ceria. Solids with P/(P+Ce) atomic ratios of 0.005, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04 were prepared. The resulting precipitates were centrifuged and washed repeatedly until the supernatant remained opalescent after centrifugation. The solids were then dried for 12 h at 373 K and calcined for 6 h in air at 973 K (heating rate of 2 K min−1). The solids were labeled as 0.5P-CeO2, 1P-CeO2, 2P-CeO2, and 4P-CeO2, respectively.
Catalyst characterization
The chemical composition of the ceria and phosphated ceria samples was determined by EDX by using a Cambridge Stereoscan 260 apparatus. N2 adsorption isotherms were recorded at 77 K by using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 surface area and porosity analyzer. The samples were outgassed at 473 K for 12 h before analysis.
Powder XRD patterns were recorded by using a Shimadzu XRD-7000 diffractometer using CuKα radiation (λ=1.5418 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA) at a scanning speed of 2° min−1 in the 20–90° 2θ range.
Raman spectra were recorded at room temperature by using a Horiba Jobin Yvon - Labram HR UV/Vis-NIR Raman Microscope Spectrometer equipped with a DL 785–100 laser. The samples were excited at 514 nm. Spectra acquisition consisted of five scans in the 150–1500 cm−1 range.
DRIFT spectra were measured by using a Thermo Electron Nicolet 4700 FTIR spectrometer with a Smart Accessory for diffuse reflectance measurements. The IR spectra were recorded in the 4000–400 cm−1 range at a resolution of 4 cm−1. The final spectra corresponded to an accumulation of 400 scans each and were recorded at room temperature. The samples were not subjected to any prior heat treatment or degassing.
XPS was performed by using a surface science cluster (Specs) in which the analysis chamber was equipped with a 150 mm Phoibos hemispherical electron energy analyzer, a dual anode (Mg/AlKα) X-ray gun, a monochromatized (AlKα/AgLα) X-ray source and a high power UVS 300 UV lamp. A flood gun operating at 1 eV electron energy and 100 μA electron current was employed to ensure sample neutralization for all measurements. The base pressure in the system was in the 10–10 mbar range. Monochromatized AlKα radiation was used (1486.74 eV). The analyzer operated in fixed analyzer transmission (FAT) mode with a pass energy of 30 eV; the estimated combined (source+analyzer) resolution was approximately 1.15±0.05 eV. The C 1s spectrum was used to calibrate the energies with the assumption that the inherent contamination C 1s feature occurs at 284.6 eV. The P/Ce surface atomic ratio was determined by comparison of the amplitudes of the P 2s and Ce 4p intensity lines and by using tabulated atomic sensitivity factors (ASF).78 It was assumed that the Ce 4p ASF was 1.2, which was obtained by simply scaling the electron number from the ASF of 2 for Ce 4d (one assumes that the photoionization cross-section and the analyzer detection efficiency are nearly the same as the binding energies are close). The P 2s line intensity ASF was 0.21. By using the Ce 3d lines with ASF of approximately 10, similar results were obtained, but these might be also affected by the stronger difference in kinetic energies.
TEM (Philips TEM-CM100) operating at 80 keV was used to determine the morphology of selected phosphated ceria particles. Samples for TEM were prepared by dispersing the phosphated ceria in ethanol and with ultrasonication for 20 min, 100 μL of the mixture was placed onto a carbon-coated (300 mesh) grid.
Catalytic testing
The catalytic ODH of propane was carried out by using a fixed-bed quartz tube down-flow reactor operated at atmospheric pressure. A diagram of the reactor is presented in Figure S1. The internal diameter of the reactor tube was 15 mm. 1 cm3 of catalyst was always used. The catalyst was supported by quartz wool. The axial temperature profile was measured by using an electronic thermometer placed in a thermowell centered in the catalyst bed. The reactor temperature was controlled by using a chromel-alumel thermocouple attached to the exterior of the reactor. Quartz chips were used to fill the dead volumes before and after the catalyst bed to minimize potential gas-phase reactions at higher reaction temperatures. Blank tests were performed without a catalyst (with quartz instead of the catalyst bed) to confirm that homogeneous reaction was negligible in the test conditions. The gas mixture that consisted of propane and air in a 1:2.5 molar ratio (propane-to-O2 molar ratio=2) was fed into the reactor at a VHSV of 9000 h−1. The reaction temperature was varied between 823 and 873 K. For each catalytic test, the reactor was set to the desired temperature with a flow of reactants, and the system was allowed to stabilize for about 1 h at the reaction temperature before the first product analysis was performed. Each run was performed over 2–3 h. The reaction products were analyzed by using a ThermoFinnigan GC equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD), a CTR I column, a flame ionization detector (FID), and an alumina column. Propene, carbon oxides (CO2 and minor amounts of CO), and cracking products (ethylene and minor amounts of methane at 873 K only) were the products formed under the reaction conditions. In addition, separation on a DB-5 column with FID confirmed the absence of any oxygenates. The carbon balance based on the products listed was always greater than 96 %. Conversions of propane and product selectivities are expressed as mol % on a carbon atom basis calculated as:,
