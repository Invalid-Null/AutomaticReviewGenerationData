Abstract
The dehydrogenation of propane to propylene on bimetallic PtIn supported on calcined hydrotalcite, PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T, was investigated with the aim of understanding the effects of calcination temperature of hydrotalcite (MgAlO) on the structure/activity relationship of catalysts. The results showed that the highest catalysis reactivity and propylene selectivity were achieved over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 catalyst, which was improved obviously compared to our previous studies. The SEM images showed that all PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts had the flake structure collapsing constantly with the increasing calcination temperature of supports, which resulted in the change of textural properties of catalysts and the formation of more stable structure. Calcination temperature of support had obvious effect on the surface acid sites of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts, and PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 sample exhibited the lowest fraction of strong acid sites that were extremely unfavorable for facilitating propane dehydrogenation reaction. Besides, PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 catalyst had the smallest average metal particle size as well as the largest specific surface area. XPS revealed that enhancing the interaction between indium and support was conductive to promoting the reduction of platinum. H2-TPR data suggested that the low-temperature reduction peak of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 was related to the unique catalytic behavior in the initial stage of propane dehydrogenation reaction. It can be concluded that PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 catalyst possessed the largest surface area, the lowest fraction of strong acidic sites and In0 species, the best reducibility and distribution of Pt particles with the smallest Pt particle size, and the lowest coke amount corresponding to the best catalytic performance.
1. Introduction
Currently, the dehydrogenation of propane can be achieved by two different reaction pathways. Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) is intensively researched due to its thermodynamically favorable pathway. For this route, the generally studied catalysts are vanadium- and cerium-based oxides [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. In such a process, one oxidative gas (usually CO2, N2O, or O2) as the oxidant is co-fed to partly oxidize propane to propylene [8], [9]. Nevertheless, this approach is faced with the problem of deep oxidation, even combustion of the hydrocarbons. The second one, non-oxidative dehydrogenation, is an endothermic pathway with equilibrium limitation and has been widely studied. Thus this reaction needs high-temperature and low-pressure to achieve a high propylene production. Although Pt-based catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation owing to coke formation and deposition on active sites [10], they are still generally used for the direct dehydrogenation of alkane because of its excellent activity [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. Many efforts were paid to enhance the stability, activity, and selectivity of Pt-based catalysts [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. It is reported that the synergistic effects between two metals could provide enhanced performance in comparison with their monometallic ones due to special physical and chemical properties [10], [11], [26], [27], [28]. A wide range of the second metals, such as Re, Ru, Ce, Zr, Zn, Ga, Sn and In, were employed to modify Pt to form different types of intermetallic structure [29], [30]. Pt-Sn based catalysts are quiet efficient and well-known catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation to alkene in these Pt-based bimetallic materials, and several reviews provided a detailed discussion about a series of Pt-Sn catalysts [10], [11], [28], [31], [32]. Additional, several studies showed that anther metal In was introduced to bimetallic Pt-Sn materials or directly doped into γ-Al2O3 support to form multimetallic catalysts such as PtSnIn/C, PtSnIn/xCa-Al and PtSn/xIn-Al [33], [34], [35]. Liu et al. found that the addition of In into bimetallic PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts not only could maintain the catalytic activity and propylene selectivity, but also could suppress the hydrogenolysis reaction during propane dehydrogenation process [34]. Most investigations were focused on the effects of PtSn and PtIn catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 or carbonaceous materials, but few works were devoted to investigating the effects of hydrotalcite supported PtIn on propane dehydrogenation. The properties of catalysts not only depend on the composition of metal precursors but also are determined by the catalyst synthesis procedure. Besides, PtIn catalysts have also been found to be more homogeneous in composition than PtSn particles and be more stable for propane dehydrogenation [36].
The support composition for bimetallic catalysts influences the sintering of metal particles and the formation of coke on the support itself. It has been reported that non-acidic materials such as alkali-doped alumina, spinels, and calcined hydrotalcite could minimize the adsorption of alkene and the formation of coke. Thereinto, Mg(Al)O is particularly desirable because it is moderately basic as well as thermally stable and is capable of enhancing Pt particles dispersion due to the presence of Al cations on the support surface [11], [36], [37], [38], [39]. Our previous studies illustrated the mechanism of activity induction and deactivation of the PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalysts. The influences of Mg/Al molar ratio and pH value in preparing Mg(Al)O supports on the properties of catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction were also studied in detail. It was found that the catalytic activity of catalysts was closely related to the metal particle size, the state of coke deposition, the specific surface area and the crystalline phase of the catalyst. Furthermore, it was reported that the PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalyst with the Mg/Al molar ratio of 4:1 prepared in pH value of 10 had nanoflake-like structure, the largest surface area, the highest Pt dispersion and harmonious acid-base properties, and thus exhibited the highest propane conversion and propylene selectivity [40], [41], [42].
In this work, we further explored the effects of different calcination temperatures of Mg(Al)O support on the properties of PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction. A series of state-of-art characterizations were employed to explore the relationship of structure and catalytic performance of PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of catalysts
Hydrotalcite was prepared by the coprecipitation method, as described in detail in our previous work [40]. In the course of synthesis, the pH value was controlled at about 10. Then the obtained materials were ground and then calcined for 10 h in air at different temperatures of 600 °C, 700 °C, 800 °C and 900 °C to obtain different supports. The calcined supports were named as Mg(Al)O-T, where T presented the calcination temperature.
The PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts were prepared by successive impregnation method. The detailed preparation process was described in our previous studies [40], [41], and the loadings of Pt and In were 0.6 and 1.5 wt% respectively.
2.2. Catalyst characterizations
2.2.1. XRD
X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterizations of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts were performed on a Bragg-Brentano diffractometer (Rigaku D/Max-2000) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at 40 kV and 30 mA. The samples were scanned from 20 to 80° of 2θ at a rate of 2°/min.
2.2.2. Low temperature N2 adsorption/desorption
The textural properties of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts were tested by N2 adsorption-desorption at liquid nitrogen temperature with an automatic analyzer(NOVA 4000, Quantachrome, USA). Firstly, the samples were degassed for 4 h at 300 °C. Then the specific surface areas of samples were calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, and the pore size distribution was determined by the method of Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH).
2.2.3. FESEM
The morphologies of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts were examined using a field emission scanning electron microscopy(FESEM, HITACHIS-4800) operated at 5.0 kV.
2.2.4. NH3-TPD
The temperature-programmed desorption(TPD) of NH3 measurements were conducted to calculate the surface acidity of catalysts. About 0.1 g of sample was pretreated at 400 °C for 1 h under a helium flow (30 mL/min), before which was cooled to 120 °C and saturated with adsorbed gas. In the process of desorption, a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to record the TPD profiles from 120 to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
2.2.5. TEM
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of catalysts were carried out by JEM-2010 microscope operated at 200 kV. The reduced samples were dispersed in ethanol by ultrasonic, and then a small drop of this solution was placed onto carbon film coated copper grids and dried before testing.
2.2.6. CO chemisorption
The Pt dispersions of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts were determined by CO chemisorption on Autosorb-iQ unit (Quantachrome, USA).
2.2.7. H2-TPR
The H2-TPR experiments were implemented to analyze the reduction capacity of samples in programmable temperature system. Prior to TPR analysis, the fresh catalyst (∼0.2 g) placed in quartz reactor was pretreated in an argon flow (15 ml/min) at 500 °C for 1 h. When the reactor was cooled to room temperature, the argon was switched to a mixed flow (hydrogen and argon). After the baseline was stabilized in the mixture at 25 °C for 60 min, the reactor was heated from room temperature to 800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Finally, H2 consumption was recorded using thermal conductivity detector (TCD) cell.
2.2.8. XPS
X-ray photoelectron spectrometer was used to measure the surface metal states of reduced catalysts on a Perkin-Elmer PHI 5000C ESCA using Al Kα radiation. The binding energies (BE) were calibrated by the C1s level at 284.8 eV as an internal standard.
2.2.9. TG
The coke deposition analysis of the spent catalysts was carried out by thermogravimetric analysis on an LCT thermogravimetric analyzer (DTG-60H), which was operated from room temperature to 800 °C at a rising rate of 20 °C/min.
2.3. Propane dehydrogenation reaction
2.3.1. Catalytic activity measurement
The propane dehydrogenation reactions were carried out in a fixed-bed quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 8 mm. After the catalyst (0.3 g) was heated from room temperature to 580 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min in argon flow, it was reduced for 2.5 h at 580 °C in H2. Afterward, the propane dehydrogenation was performed at 620 °C with the feed flow including H2, Ar, and C3H8 (H2/C3H8/Ar molar ratio = 7:8:35, WHSV = 3.3 h−1). The reaction off-gas flow was analyzed by a gas chromatography apparatus (GC, SP-6890) equipped with a FID detector and an AT-PLOT PORA-Q capillary column [41].
2.3.2. Calculation method of catalyst dehydrogenation performance
The propane conversion and propylene selectivity were calculated as follows:
where C3H8 in and C3H8 out presented the contents of propane in feed and exit steams respectively, C3H6 out was the content of propylene in exit steam [40].
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural characterizations and acid-base properties
Fig. 1 showed the XRD patterns of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts. Apparently, when the calcination temperature of supports increased from 600 °C to 800 °C, the major characteristic peaks of catalysts had no evident variation and could be ascribed to periclase MgO [11], [36], [38]. However, in the XRD patterns of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-900, new diffraction peaks of spinel MgAl2O4 were detected. In addition, the diffraction peak intensity of periclase MgO increased with the increase of calcination temperature. It was verified that there was an increase in crystallite size calculated by the Scherrer equation with the increase of calcination temperature [43], [44]. Moreover, no characteristic peaks of Pt or In species were detected, probably due to the high dispersion on the supports or very small metal particles [45].

The NH3-TPD measurements were used to determine the acid properties of catalysts. The NH3-TPD profiles of different samples were displayed in Fig. 2 and the semiquantitative results were summarized in Table 1. The NH3 desorption features of all catalysts showed four broad peaks: the weak acid sites (peak I) centered at about ∼212 °C, the medium strong acid sites (peak II and peak III) in the region of 300–600 °C and the last one (peak IV) corresponding to strong acid sites [39], [46]. As can be seen, Table 1 showed very similar values for PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 and PtIn/Mg(Al)O-800, and PtIn/Mg(Al)O-700 and PtIn/Mg(Al)O-900, respectively. Shen had reported that Mg(Al)O samples had similar acidity for the calcination temperature of 600–800 °C [47]. At the same time, it was worth noting that the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-900 catalyst possessed the highest total amount of strong acid sites (calculated from the strong acid desorption peak area). This result may be related to the presence of spinel MgAl2O4. It was known that the Al cations occupied the octahedral sites in hydrotalcite before calcination, and there was a transition of Al3+ from octahedral to tetrahedral sites upon calcination at elevated temperature. That was related to the formation of spinel phase in the samples calcined at 900 °C [47]. In addition, high calcination temperature would facilitate the transition of Al3+ and high Aloctahedral/Altetrahedral ratio resulted in the stronger acidity [47]. From Fig. 2, the desorption peaks of medium-strong acidity moved to a higher temperature as calcination temperature increased, indicating that acidity of catalysts increased. It was generally accepted that the side reactions were mainly catalyzed by strong acid centers [48]. Compared to the others, PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 sample with the lowest calcination temperature of carrier exhibited the lowest fraction of strong acid sites.

3.2. Physical characterizations
The low-temperature N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distributions of catalysts were shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3(a), all the catalysts exhibited a type Ⅳ isotherm with hysteresis loops of type H4 (according to IUPAC), which were correlated with slit-shaped pores due to layered structure [49]. Besides, according to the capillary condensation theory, the higher relative pressure of the starting point of hysteresis loop implied that the sample had larger pore size. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-900 sample exhibited the largest pore size among all the samples. The specific surface areas (SBET), pore volumes (Vp), pore sizes (Dp), calcination temperature of carriers and metal loadings were listed in Table 2. The specific area of catalyst was an important factor because the catalytic reaction occurred on the surface and was very sensitive to calcination temperature [39]. From Table 2, the increasing calcination temperature of supports caused a significant decrease of SBET. For example, the largest SBET of 242.9 m2/g of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 decreased to 165.8 m2/g for PtIn/Mg(Al)O-900 catalyst. This result correlated well with the XRD results [44]. However, the Vp and Dp values of catalysts had an increasing trend, which was contrary to the SBET values. Meantime, the pore size distributions of catalysts indicated that the samples were all mesoporous materials with irregular pores. These data were related to the structural properties of catalysts, as discussed below.

Fig. 4 illustrated the scanning electron micrographs of catalysts with different calcination temperatures of supports. With the increase of calcination temperature, the evident changes in the surface morphologies were observed for the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts. As reported previously, all the catalysts exhibited a similar nanoflake structure interleaved with each other and the slit-shaped pores except for PtIn/Mg(Al)O-900 [41]. The surface morphologies were in good agreement with the analysis obtained by low-temperature N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 sample showed the clearest nanoflakes. However, when the calcination temperature increased from 700 to 800 °C, the edges of flake structure in catalysts collapsed gradually, which resulted in the blockage of more slit pores. Moreover, much more surface nanoflakes of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-800 were covered by debris compared to PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 and PtIn/Mg(Al)O-700 catalysts. As for PtIn/Mg(Al)O-900 sample, the flakelike morphology became indefinable and some reticular structures were reformed. These results were in accordance with the decrease of surface areas of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts and indicated that the structures of supports encountered damage as the calcination temperature increased [50].

3.3. TEM characterization and redox behaviors of catalysts
Fig. 5 showed the TEM images of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T, and the particle size histograms of black spot observed in TEM images. The black spots were assigned to Pt particles on Mg(Al)O-T supports. In addition, the average Pt size, Pt dispersions, TOF values and average rC3H6 of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts were summarized in Table 3. The small Pt particles about 0.5–7 nm in diameter isolated from each other were observed in the TEM images, and the average Pt particle size increased slowly with the growing calcination temperature in Table 3. Besides, Pt dispersions, TOF values and average rC3H6 of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts presented an opposite trend compared to the average Pt particle size. Apparently, PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 sample exhibited the smallest average Pt particle size. This result was in good agreement with SEM images and the results of textural properties. With the increase of calcination temperature for the supports, the nanoflake structure of Mg(Al)O-T gradually collapsed and specific surface areas decreased increasingly, which led to the accumulation of Pt particles so that the average particle diameter increased gradually [51]. In general, the smaller average Pt particle size was, the better Pt particles dispersed was observed, which was more beneficial to improve the catalytic activity. For the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 sample, the largest surface area was also advantageous to enhance the Pt dispersion.

The reduction properties of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts were studied by H2-TPR and shown in Fig. 6. It can be seen that three reduction peaks were observed in the TPR profile of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 catalyst. The first peak appeared at ∼350 °C, the second one was at ∼560 °C, and the highest temperature peak was at ∼670 °C. The peak at the lowest temperature was assigned to the reduction of Pt species with the highest hydrogen consumption [33], [34], indicating that much more platinum oxides can be reduced by H2 at rather lower temperature. It had a great effect on the initial stage of propane dehydrogenation reaction. Comparing the other samples with PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 catalyst, the reduction temperature of platinum oxides shifted to a higher temperature at ∼440 °C, implying that the interaction between metal and support was enhanced so that Pt species were difficult to be reduced. This result was in accordance with TEM images in Fig. 5. The smaller average Pt particle size and the higher Pt dispersion were in favor of the reduction of Pt species at lower temperature. Simultaneously, it was supposed that the platinum oxides were very sensitive to the surface areas of supports The second broad hydrogen consumption peaks can be attributed to the co-reduction of Pt and In species, due to the similar reduction temperature regions of monometallic Pt and In catalysts [40]. When the calcination temperature of supports increased to 800–900 °C, the co-reduction peaks shifted from 560 °C to 580 °C. It can be explained that some more stable species such as spinel MgAl2O4 was formed in supports with the increase of calcination temperature, which was consistent with the results of XRD. Therefore, Pt and In species were stabilized by a strong interaction with the supports, indicating that overhigh calcination temperature of support went against promoting the co-reduction of platinum and indium oxides. On the other hand, the increase of co-reduction temperature also can be explained by the spillover phenomenon of hydrogen. As the lower calcination temperature facilitated the dispersion of Pt species, more platinum oxides were reduced at lower temperature and began to absorb dissociative hydrogen [43]. During the co-reduction process, the left platinum and indium species on the catalysts created hydrogen adsorption and dissociation sites. The generated atomic hydrogen migrated to the regions containing platinum and indium, and reduced these metals more easily than the ones in the molecular form. This conclusion was in accordance with the particle size histograms of black spot observed in TEM images. Finally, the peaks at the highest temperature were ascribed to the reduction of Al3+ in supports. With the rise of calcination temperature, the hydrogen consumption of Al3+ increased gradually. For PtIn/Mg(Al)O-800 and PtIn/Mg(Al)O-900 catalysts, the latter two peaks overlapped with each other, which may be related to the strong acid sites on the surface of catalysts increased with the grow of calcination temperature.

The effects of the calcination temperature of supports on the surface composition and oxidation state of metals on the catalysts were studied by XPS. The XPS spectra for In3d5/2 of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts after reduction were shown in Fig. 7. There were two peaks at ∼444.1 eV and ∼445.2 eV corresponding zerovalent and oxidation state of In respectively on the catalysts [41]. The peaks were analyzed by deconvoluting the peaks with Gaussian curve fitting method. The semiquantitative results were summarized in Table 3. It can be seen that Al content and In(3+)/In(0) ratios on the surfaces of catalysts decreased gradually with the rise of calcination temperature; while Mg content and the surface Mg/Al ratios presented an opposite trend. That can be explained in terms of the structural properties of supports. The effect of Mg/Al molar ratio on the structure and properties of PtIn/Mg(Al)O had been illustrated in our previous work [41], proving that only appropriate Mg/Al molar ratio could optimize the distribution of strong acid fraction on the surface of catalysts. According to the XPS analysis and NH3-TPD results, the percentage of strong acid sites increased with the increase of surface Mg/Al molar ratio. In addition, the decrease of surface Al content may be related to the reform of crystalline phase. The surface Mg contents of all the samples did not have significant differences, while the surface Al content of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-900 catalyst was obviously less than that of the others in Table 4. The data corresponded to XRD results. The XRD patterns of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T sample only presented the characteristic peaks of MgO for temperature of 600–800 °C, and the Al3+ in the sample was highly dispersed in the structure of MgO. While in the XRD patterns of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-900, new diffraction peaks of spinel MgAl2O4 were detected. It can be speculated that more Al element entered into the framework of supports to form more stable spinel MgAl2O4 when support was calcined at 900 °C so that the surface aluminum content of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-900 catalyst decreased. Furthermore, the previous work demonstrated that high content of In(0) would jam Pt active site. The sample of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 presented the highest surface In(3+)/In(0) ratio in Table 3, indicating that the increasing calcination temperature facilitated the reduction of In species and was disadvantageous to propane dehydrogenation reaction.

3.4. The effect of calcination temperature of supports on catalytic performances
The catalytic activity of the supported PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts for propane dehydrogenation was shown in Fig. 8. From Fig. 8(a), the propane conversion over PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts differed considerably for propane dehydrogenation reaction. Compared with PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600, the reaction process over other catalysts could be divided into three stages: the activity induction period, stable period and stage of inactivation [40]. For PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600, the propane conversion in the initial 10 h time on stream was about 69.0% accompanied with the highest propylene selectivity of 98.0%, which was far superior to other catalysts and showed the best catalytic activity. In the meantime, in the initial reaction period of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600, the propane conversion process turned into the stable period immediately instead of undergoing the activity induction period. This result may be related to the reduction of Pt species shifting to a lower temperature at around 350 °C. Hence platinum oxides can be reduced easily and more active sites were formed, which promoted the growth of propane conversion tremendously. Besides, PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 catalyst possessed the largest specific surface area, the lowest fraction of strong acidic sites and In0 species, the smallest Pt particle size (1.0 nm), the highest Pt dispersion (46.7%) and TOF values, and the highest average rate of propylene production during the whole reaction process. All these results accounted for that PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 sample with the best catalytic performance. PtIn/Mg(Al)O-700 and PtIn/Mg(Al)O-800 showed the similar propane conversion and propylene selectivity, and PtIn/Mg(Al)O-900 exhibited the worst catalytic performance. In stable period and stage of inactivation, the propane conversion of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 decreased more quickly; while the propylene selectivity of all the catalysts kept stable in the whole process of reaction. It showed that although reducing calcination temperature of supports was disadvantageous to maintain the stability of catalysts, which improved catalytic activity dramatically. This conclusion may be explained that since reaction temperature (620 °C) exceeded the calcination temperature of 600 °C for PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600, with the reaction time going, support structure could partly collapsed, which resulted in slit pore blockage, active sites coverage, and coke deposit so that the catalyst started inactivation seriously.

3.5. Coke analysis
The amounts of deposited coke on the spent catalysts were quantitatively determined by TG in an oxidizing environment, and the mass loss profiles were shown in Fig. 9. From these profiles, all the samples showed two thermal weight loss stages: below 250 and at about 450 °C, respectively. The first one corresponded to the release of interlayer water and the other weight loss centered at about 550 °C was caused by the burning of coke deposits on the catalyst [46], [52]. It can be observed that the amount of coke deposition followed the order PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 (13%) < PtIn/Mg(Al)O-700 (15%) < PtIn/Mg(Al)O-800 ≈ PtIn/Mg(Al)O-900 (19%). The increasing calcination temperature was contributed to the higher amount of coke deposits. This result was mainly due to the enhancement of strong acid acidity when the calcination temperature of supports was above 700 °C. The increase of strong acid sites promoted side reactions such as fracture of carbon–carbon bonds and coking so that the coke deposits produced, covered and blocked the active metals during the reaction, which was the main reason for the catalyst deactivation. The lowest amount of coke deposits on the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 catalyst was observed, suggesting better anti-coking ability.

3.6. Correlations between calcination temperature of supports and catalytic performance
The duration of catalytic activity (above 60%) as a function of calcination temperature of supports was shown in Fig. 10. It was clear that the stable time of propane conversion above 60% of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 was the longest. With the increase of calcination temperature, the stable time of propane conversion above 60% decreased significantly. For PtIn/Mg(Al)O-900, propane conversion was below 60% during the whole reaction process. It can be concluded that the optimal catalytic stability was obtained when the support was calcined at 600 °C. Fig. 11 showed the once-though yield of propylene during the entire 31 h reaction period as a function of calcination temperature of supports. The consumption amount of propane in the whole reaction process was 0.66 mol. Apparently, PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 sample possessed the largest propylene yield. The once-though propylene yield decreased constantly as the calcination temperature increased, consistent with the previous result. These results indicated that the calcination temperature of support at 600 °C was suitable to increase the propylene yield.

3.7. The reaction-regeneration cycles of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 catalyst
The most active catalyst, PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600, was selected for the reaction-regeneration cycles after reaction for 31 h. The spent catalysts were regenerated by air purge oxidation, and the catalyst was then reduced in H2 at 580 °C again. From Fig. 12, it can be seen that the propane conversion decreased gradually in each cycle, while the propylene selectivity experienced an hour of induction period to reach a stable value at about 93% during each cycle. Besides, both the initial and the final propane conversions decreased evidently in each cycle. At the same time, the downtrend of propane conversion became faster as the regeneration cycle went on. Finally, after 5 reaction-regeneration cycles, the initial and the final propane conversion still achieved 64.6% and 45.6% respectively, and the propylene selectivity kept at 93.1%.

4. Conclusions
On this basis of our previous work, the influences of different calcination temperature of supports on the of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-T catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction were investigated in detail. The synthesized catalysts were characterized with several state-of-the-art methods. The reactivity-performances of the catalysts were analyzed. The results illustrated that the calcination temperature in preparing Mg(Al)O support markedly influenced the properties of PtIn/Mg(Al)O catalysts for propane dehydrogenation reaction. The XRD, low-temperature N2 adsorption/desorption and FESEM characterizations showed that with the increasing calcination temperature, the nanoflake structure interleaved with each other collapsed constantly and then resulted in the change of textural properties of catalysts and the formation of a more stable structure. As the In(3+)/In(0) ratios on the surface of catalysts decreased slowly, the reduction peak of Pt species shifted to a higher temperature, revealing that enhance the interaction between In and support was conductive to promoting the reduction of platinum. H2-TPR data indicated that increasing calcination temperature enhanced the interactions between Pt species and support. The PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 exhibited the best catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation reaction with the calcination temperature of support at 600 °C. The calcination temperature of supports within the range of 700–800 °C had little effect on the activity of the resulted catalysts. As the calcination temperature of support increased to 900 °C, the PtIn/Mg(Al)O-900 showed the worst catalytic activity. The catalyst of PtIn/Mg(Al)O-600 was tested for the reaction-regeneration cycles to explore the regenerability. The results showed that after 5 regeneration cycles, the initial and the final propane conversion still achieved 64.6% and 45.6% respectively accompanied with the propylene selectivity of 93.1%.
