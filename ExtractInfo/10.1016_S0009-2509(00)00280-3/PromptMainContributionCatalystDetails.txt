Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane for propylene production — comparison of catalytic processes
Abstract
A comparison between three different process concepts — autothermal oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, isothermal oxidative dehydrogenation over a V2O5/TiO2 catalyst and the commercial non-oxidative dehydrogenation process of UOP — were performed. The optimal reaction conditions with respect to yield of propylene were derived from literature data for the UOP-process and the autothermal oxidative dehydrogenation. For the isothermal oxidative dehydrogenation over the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst, the optimal reaction conditions were derived based on a kinetic model, which was developed for this purpose. The comparison of processes was focused on the total mass and energy balances and included the steps of catalytic reaction, product separation, propane recycle and product purification. If exclusive propylene production is the objective, both oxidative process variants do not reveal an alternative to the non-oxidative propane conversion neither for consumption of energy nor raw material. On the contrary, if olefins are the desired products, the autothermal oxidative propane conversion might compete with the commercial non-oxidative process while the isothermal oxidative dehydrogenation does not show any advantage.
1. Introduction and objectives
The propylene demand, mainly for production of polypropylene, acrolein and acrylic acid, increases at a higher rate than the demand for ethylene and other light olefins co-produced in the traditional processes such as steam cracking and FCC of natural gas and oil fractions. Since 1980s, the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is a topic of commercial as well as scientific interest as the better understanding of these reactions allows exploitation of cheap and abundant resources and selective production of propylene. Despite the apparent simplicity of the reaction, propane dehydrogenation is an extremely complex process as it is a highly endothermic reaction, favored at high temperature and thermodynamically limited by equilibrium. Thermal cracking side reactions favored by high temperatures, significantly affect the stability of propylene and alkenes produced. Thus, coke is deposited on all dehydrogenation catalysts, causing the drop in their activity. As a consequence, a frequent regeneration and complicate reactor concept are required. The heavy thermodynamic and kinetic constrains have stimulated the search for better solutions.
An alternative process is oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODP), which is an exothermal reaction and not limited by equilibrium. Two different concepts which are related to different types of catalysts are presently investigated:
1.
The combination of the exothermic propane oxidation with the endothermic thermal dehydrogenation of propane as it was suggested by Schmidt et al. and Forzatti et al. for Pt-catalysts (Beretta, Forzatti & Ranzi, 1999; Beretta, Piovesan & Forzatti, 1999; Yokoyama, Bharadwaj & Schmidt, 1996; Bharadwaj, Yokayama & Schmidt, 1996) and by Buyevskaya et al. for rare-earth oxide catalysts (Buyevskaya & Baerns, 1998; Buyevskaya, Wolf & Baerns, in press). The main idea of this process is to overcome thermodynamic limitations and to avoid the stage of catalyst regeneration by operating with an exothermal reaction using molecular O2 or air. This autothermal reactor operation still suffers from some drawbacks like the loss of valuable co-product H2 which is transformed to water and the low selectivity as a result of preferred formation of carbon oxides and C–C-bond scission at high temperature. The highest propylene yield achieved up to now by autothermal dehydrogenation amounts to about 20%.
2.
The second mode of oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is based on redox-type catalysts which are already active below 500°C. Over these catalysts propylene is formed via a heterogeneous Marsvan–Krevelen mechanisms. Compared to the autothermal reaction concept higher selectivity is obtained (Baerns & Buevskaya, 2000).
In the present study, an analysis of the kinetic limitations of the propylene yield for both catalytic concepts was performed in order to estimate the potential of these alternative processes.
A benchmark study concerning the overall mass and energy balances was performed by comparing three process concepts:
Variant A: the existing UOP-technology for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (Venkataraman, Chan & Boston, 1990).
Variant B: a process of autothermal oxidative dehydrogenation based on a Pt/Al2O3-catalyst according to Beretta et al. (1999).
Variant C: a process based on a 1%V2O5/TiO2-catalyst representing the redox-concept.
The evaluation of the UOP-process and the autothermal oxidative process was based on literature information. To allow a comparison with the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over a redox-type catalysts, a kinetic model was developed for the 1%V2O5/TiO2-catalyst and used to predict the optimal conditions for isothermal reactor operation with respect to yield propylene. The results of this kinetic study are summarized in the Section 2.
2. Catalytic performance of the V2O5/TiO2-catalyst
2.1. Experimental kinetic data
Kinetic data were obtained in a tubular catalytic fixed-bed reactor and the feed gas was diluted to a high extent with inert N2 to preserve isothermicity. The temperature was varied between 673 and

The experimental kinetic data do reveal the typical behavior of a selective oxidation reaction over a redox-type catalyst.
High propylene selectivity is observed at low conversion of propane and especially at low partial pressure of oxygen at the reactor inlet, i.e., propylene is the exclusive primary product formed by interaction with lattice oxygen of the catalyst. If the partial pressure of oxygen increases non-selective oxygen species (O2,ads) are formed at the catalyst surface which do promote the COx formation as well. Moreover, an increasing residence time leads to a drop of the propylene yield due to consecutive propylene oxidation.
2.2. Reaction scheme and kinetic parameters for the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst
Reaction scheme , , , , , , reflects the phenomenological findings of experimental kinetic data with the primary heterogeneous formation of propylene in step 1 and its consecutive degradation via steps 4–6 due to the stepwise interaction with lattice oxygen. (Surface species are denoted by brackets.) The primary combustion of propane on adsorbed oxygen species is described by step 8:

(7)
For kinetic data evaluation, the reactor was described as an isothermally operating tubular plug-flow reactor. Assuming steady-state conditions for the reaction and the validity of the perfect gas law, the material balance for the gas-phase species (C3H8,O2,C3H6C2H4,CO,CO2,H2, and H2O) is
This system of differential equations was integrated numerically by a Gear algorithm.
No rate-determining reaction step was supposed for the derivation of rate equations of surface reaction steps. For the steady state of the reactor, the mass balance of the surface species yields a system of non-linear equations since the differential term must be zero:
The steady-state surface coverage 6i (for
resulted from the numerical solution of this set of non-linear equations and the balance of normalized surface coverage 6i of the oxide surface. Furthermore, it was assumed that oxygen absorption is, in principle, equilibrated. Thus, the surface coverage by adsorbed oxygen O2,ads is a linear function of the oxygen partial pressure.
Concentration of the adsorbed species CH2,ads was calculated based on the quasi-steady-state assumption (Bodenstein's principle). The kinetic parameter obtained by the fitting procedure are summarized in Table 1.

Based on the kinetic model the maximum yield which can be achieved in an isothermal reactor was calculated by simultaneous optimization of the residence time, temperature and partial pressure of propane and oxygen. Accordingly, the following optimal values were predicted for this catalyst type: reaction
, total pressure
.
Under these conditions, a maximum yield of propylene of 8.5% is expected in an isothermal reactor. Compared to the value of propylene yield of 14.4% reported by Forzatti et al. for autothermal reactor operation (Beretta et al., 1999) the predicted maximum yield over the V2O5/TiO2-catalyst is significantly lower. However, at low propane conversion, much higher selectivities can be obtained by the heterogeneous propane formation over the redox-type catalyst.
3. Process simulation
The three processes (UOP-process, autothermal ODP over Pt/Al2O3 and isothermal ODP over V2O5/TiO2) were simulated by ASPEN PLUSTM. The process scheme included the reactor described by model RSTOIC (stoichiometric reactor), the products separation and purification. The general set-up of separation was taken from literature information (Kirk-Otmer, 1980). Since the overall mass and energy balance is determined decisively by the separation concept, it is described in more detail in Section 3.1.
3.1. Product separation and purification
The separation of the reaction products is based on the cooling of the reaction mixture, the condensation of the product from the inert gas and the effective rectification of raw propylene. The scheme of the unit operation is summarized in Fig. 4. These operations are identical for both oxidative and non-oxidative processes; i.e., the mass and energy balances can be compared. The feed is mixed with a refluxed inert stream (1) and heated and compressed (2) up to the reaction temperature and pressure (Fig. 4). The reaction mixture is fed into reactor (3). The product is consequently cooled and dried in a system of heat exchangers (4) and molecular sieves (5). Water-free gas stream is compressed (6) and cooled (7) in at least 6 steps up to
. The light products are condensed. The inert gas is separated from the liquid products (8) and mixed with again the reactant feed. The raw product is a mixture of propylene, CO, CO2 and light hydrocarbons (ethylene, methane, etc.). It is purified in the system of 2 up to 3 rectification columns (9). The final product purity reaches polymer grade,

3.2. Set-up of process simulations
The calculation of the system of the non-linear algebraic equations, which describes the mass and enthalpy balances of the proposed processes (Venkataraman et al., 1990) was performed by ASPEN
.
The following assumptions were supposed:
•
liquid and gas phases are ideally mixed,
•
on every stage of rectification column, the phase equilibrium is obtained,
•
heat losses are neglected,
•
chemical reaction takes place only in gas phase.
The simulations were performed with the following input set-up:
•
Calculation precision:
.
•
Maximal number of iteration: 100.
•
Gas–liquid equilibrium: NRTL equation.
3.3. Reaction conditions considered in the process simulation
Reaction conditions for the different process variants which were chosen for process simulation are summarized in Table 2. For the non-oxidative UOP-process (variant A in Table 2) literature data of conversion and selectivity with the corresponding values for concentration of reactants and temperature were taken (Baerns & Buevskaya, 2000; Cavani & Trifiro, 1995; Pujado & Vora, 1990).

For the autothermal oxidative dehydrogenation over Pt/Al2O3 optimized values for reactant concentration and inlet temperature as suggested by Forzatti et al. (Beretta et al., 1999) were used (variant B). Isothermal reactor operation was assumed for the V2O5/TiO2 catalyst (variant C). The respective operation temperature, pressure and propane and oxygen concentration optimal reaction conditions were obtained by our kinetic model mentioned above.
3.4. Results of process simulation
The comparison of oxidative and non-oxidative processes is based on the assumption that both processes have the identical apparatus, and the same propylene production rate of
propylene
. The difference between oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation variant lies in the mass flow of the feed, the chemical reactions and the product composition and the separation effort.
The production capacity as well as the purity of the product aimed at was the same for each process simulation. The simulation results are shown in the Table 3. The compression pressure was supposed to be
and the total efficiency of rectification column was 100 theoretical stages (TS) in variant A, 100 TS in variant B and 130 TS in variant C. The average reflux was assumed to be 5.

Reactant dilution, catalyst activity and selectivity determine the energy balance of the processes. In principle, the main part of the heat is used for the purification of the product.
The pre-heating of the feed and consequently the rectification of propane rich propylene stream appears to be very unfavorable in process C compared to variants A and B (see Table 3 and Fig. 4, unit op. 2, 8, 9).
Due to the lower selectivity of propylene in variants B and C compared to variant A, a higher amount of propane has to be used per kg product and, consequently, has also to be heated and compressed (see Table 3 and Fig. 4, unit op. 2, 6). This, in turn, leads to a higher demand of cooling water in both ODP processes (Table 3 and Fig. 4, unit op. 4).
On the other hand, it has to be emphasized that the autothermal oxidative process B shows high selectivity to the ethylene as well (see Table 2).
Taking now into account olefins as desired products, the ranking of energy balances of processes A, B and C significantly changes. The simulation results are illustrated in Table 4. The new comparison seems to favor variant B which shows a selectivity to olefins of approx. 65%. With such a selectivity value, the total energy consumption per kg olefin is nearly 3 times lower for autothermal oxidative process (variant B) compared to the commercial UOP-process (variant A).

However, variant C (V2O5/TiO2 catalyst) cannot compete at all with the other two concepts. The energy consumption is significantly higher than for cases A and B due to the high effort in propane/propylene separation and the non-sufficient generation of reaction heat.
For both ODP variants B and C the exploitation of propane is unsatisfying compared to case A. However, variant B might compensate this disadvantage partially by its comfortable energy balance for olefin production.
Following these results, the oxidative propane dehydrogenation over Pt/Al2O3 is a process with a lower energy consumption than the non-oxidative one. The extent of savings are mainly determined by the selectivity of propane conversion.
Thus, for decision about efficiency of the process set-up (A or B) both the energy and raw product costs have to be taken into account.
4. Conclusions
Two different objectives have to be considered for ranking the feed and energy efficiency of non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (UOP process), autothermal and isothermal oxidative dehydrogenation of propane: (a) Propylene production and (b) total olefin production. If exclusive propylene production is the objective the oxidative process variant do not reveal an alternative to the non-oxidative propane conversion for both consumption of energy and raw material. Contrary, if total olefin production is considered the autothermal oxidative propane conversion might compete with the commercial non-oxidative process while the isothermal oxidative dehydrogenation does not show any advantage.
