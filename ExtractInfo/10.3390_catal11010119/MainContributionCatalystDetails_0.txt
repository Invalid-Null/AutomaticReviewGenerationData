 Based on the information provided in the document, this does not appear to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) to produce propylene. The document focuses on chemical looping oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CL-ODHP) using oxygen carriers. While propane is converted to propylene, the process utilizes lattice oxygen from the oxygen carrier rather than direct dehydrogenation of propane or oxidative dehydrogenation using molecular oxygen.
