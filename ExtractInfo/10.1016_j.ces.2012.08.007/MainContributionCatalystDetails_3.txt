 Unfortunately the provided document does not seem to discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The document focuses on ethane oxidative dehydrogenation over a NiNb mixed oxide catalyst. Since propane conversion is not mentioned, I cannot extract the requested information about propane dehydrogenation performance and advancements.
