Investigation of engineering aspects in ethane ODH over highly selective Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox catalyst
Abstract
A wide range of operating variables is investigated in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction over Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox mixed oxide catalyst. Ethane to oxygen ratio C2H6/O2=2 and feed composition of 10% C2H6/5% O2 were selected as the best trade-off between optimum selectivity and acceptable ethane conversion level. Although suppressing oxygen partial pressure was found to increase ethylene selectivity, a minimum oxygen concentration is required in order to maintain the catalyst in oxidized state. Staged oxygen admission leads to an increase in ethylene selectivity but in expense of ethane conversion, as confirmed by experimental and simulation results. Regarding reactor configuration, preliminary testing under fluid bed conditions proved quite promising. Finally, Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox mixed oxide presented satisfactory stability, as proven both by 100 h on stream stability test and by subjection to a steaming procedure after which the catalytic performance was not deteriorated.

1. Introduction
Ethane oxidative dehydrogenation is an alternative method to directly produce ethylene from ethane minimizing the important environmental and economic restrains associated with the conventional steam cracking method. Despite intense research activity through the last decades, the fact that there is still relatively long distance to cover between experiment and industrial implementation bespeaks the technical challenge of a successful commercial application that requires innovative integration of both catalyst and process advances (Brazdil, 2006, Cavani et al., 2007, Cavani, 2010, Corberán, 2009). Apart from an efficient catalyst, able to selectively activate ethane C–H bonds to ethylene at relatively low temperatures and at the same time minimize COx formation, operating conditions, oxidation medium, reactor type and reactants contact mode have been identified as critical factors for ethane oxidative dehydrogenation (Cavani et al., 2007).
Alternative reactor concepts have been therefore proposed and studied for selective oxidation reactions generally (Lintz and Reitzmann, 2007) and specifically for the oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes (Ahchieva et al., 2005, Beretta et al., 2001, Dons et al., 2004, Hamel et al., 2008, Hamel et al., 2011, Lemonidou and Machli, 2007, Lobera et al., 2011, López et al., 2008, Milne et al., 2006, Milne et al., 2010, Rodriguez et al., 2009, Rodriguez et al., 2010, Rodríguez et al., 2011, Steinfeldt et al., 2005). The majority of these studies investigate in a theoretical level the implementation of multitubular fixed bed (López et al., 2008) and membrane reactors for ethane (Hamel et al., 2008, Lobera et al., 2011, Rodriguez et al., 2009, Rodríguez et al., 2011), propane (Hamel et al., 2008) or n-butane (Milne et al., 2006, Milne et al., 2010) ODH reaction while only few include experimental work (Ahchieva et al., 2005, Beretta et al., 2001, Dons et al., 2004, Hamel et al., 2008, Lemonidou and Machli, 2007, Steinfeldt et al., 2005). Multitubular fixed bed reactors are extensively used for exothermic reactions such as ethane ODH, employing thousands of small diameter tubes immersed in a shell through which a proper coolant flows (Lintz and Reitzmann, 2007, Rodriguez et al., 2009, Rodríguez et al., 2011). However, since heat transfer is much more efficient and the constraints of explosion limits are less critical in fluidized bed than in fixed beds, attempts have been made to use fluidized bed reactors in partial oxidations in order to reduce the temperature of hot spots. On the other hand, besides special requirements on the catalyst such as resistance to abrasion, fluidized beds have the disadvantage that selectivity can be reduced due to back-mixing of the porous-catalyst even if plug flow is prevailing in the gas phase. In addition, the formation of gas bubbles leads to by-pass effects that reduce the conversion of the reactant (Lintz and Reitzmann, 2007).
Due to the fact that coexistence of alkanes and O2 leads to undesired combustion reactions, several studies have explored approaches that minimize O2 concentrations. Alkane to oxygen ratio is considered as means to control the degree of oxidation of solid oxide catalysts mainly based on vanadium and thus to obtain higher selectivity to the desired alkene (Gao et al., 2002). Lower O2 concentrations can be maintained throughout the reactor length via staged O2 introduction by oxygen transport membranes (Hamel et al., 2008, Hamel et al., 2011, Lobera et al., 2011, Milne et al., 2006, Milne et al., 2010, Rodriguez et al., 2009) or multiple injection points (Fang et al., 2011, Hamel et al., 2011, López et al., 2008). Extrapolating the concept of minimum oxygen admission leads to the so-called the redox-decoupling or the cyclic operation mode, which separates the two steps of a Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, i.e. reduction of the catalyst by the hydrocarbon through lattice oxygen consumption and catalyst re-oxidation by gas phase oxygen (see for example (Creaser et al., 1999; Grabowski et al., 2002; Kondratenko et al., 2005; Sugiyama et al., 2005)). In the case of propane ODH, such an operation was reported to improve olefin yield in some papers (Ballarini et al., 2004, Creaser et al., 1999), whereas no beneficial effect was recorded in other studies (Ballarini et al., 2003, Lemonidou and Machli, 2007).
In such operation modes, but as well as in the conventional ODH process, catalyst stability is a critical factor. Catalyst stability may be influenced by a variety of factors, such as catalyst poisoning, strong adsorption of reaction intermediates, catalyst fouling due to coke formation, thermal degradation (Trimm, 1997). It is thus absolutely necessary to establish the lifetime of the catalyst under question under reaction conditions.
Although a number of published papers have dealt with all of the above mentioned design and operation aspects, each individual study focuses more or less on a specific aspect by conducting experiments and/or theoretical studies with a certain catalytic system. The scope of this research paper is to explore the effect of all the above parameters on the catalytic performance over a specific material, aiming to quantify the parameters that determine catalyst performance and lifetime. Over the past few years our group has extensively studied ethane ODH and introduced Ni0.85Nb0.15 mixed oxide as a highly active and selective catalyst (Heracleous and Lemonidou, 2006a, Heracleous and Lemonidou, 2006b, Heracleous et al., 2007, Skoufa et al., 2012), exhibiting an ethylene yield of 46% at 400 °C (Heracleous and Lemonidou, 2006a). In-depth structural characterization led to the identification of two distinct phases: a NiO-rich, crystallized phase with Nb cations incorporated in the NiO lattice, which retains its original crystallographic structure, identified as Ni–Nb solid solution and a highly distorted Nb-rich phase formed upon insertion of Nb cations in areas of high density cationic deficiency of the host NiO (Heracleous and Lemonidou, 2006a, Heracleous and Lemonidou, 2006b, Heracleous et al., 2007). More recently, this Ni–Nb solid solution was identified as the key component for the high ethylene selectivity of the Ni0.85Nb0.15 catalyst, as the insertion of even a small amount of Nb drastically decreases the electrophilic oxygen species responsible for the total oxidation reactions (Skoufa et al., 2012).
The objectives of the present study are to define the optimum range of operating conditions regarding feed composition (ethane to oxygen ratio and reactant mixture density), explore the influence of reactor type and oxidant admission mode and finally determine the long time performance of the selective Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox catalyst.
2. Experimental part
2.1. Catalyst preparation/ characterization
The mixed Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox oxide was prepared by the evaporation method according to the procedure previously reported (Heracleous and Lemonidou, 2006a). Namely, aqueous solutions containing the appropriate amounts of nickel nitrate hexahydrate (Merck) and ammonium niobate oxalate (Aldrich) were mixed and heated at 70 °C under continuous stirring for 1 h to ensure complete dissolution and good mixing of the starting compounds. The solvent was then removed by evaporation under reduced pressure, and the resulting solid was dried overnight at 120 °C and calcined in synthetic air at 450 °C for 5 h.
The solid catalyst was characterized as to the specific surface area and crystal structure by means of N2 adsorption at 77 K using the multipoint BET analysis method and X-ray diffraction method respectively.
2.2. Reactivity studies in ethane oxidative dehydrogenation
The catalytic activity and selectivity were measured in a suitable bench scale test unit equipped with a quartz fixed bed reactor (0.9 cm ID). The catalyst particles were diluted with equal amount of quartz particles of the same size to achieve isothermal operation. The total height of the catalyst bed was 2 cm. The temperature in the middle of the catalytic bed was measured with a coaxial thermocouple. Prior to each experiment the catalyst was activated in a 10%O2/He flow at 450 °C for 30 min. Unless mentioned otherwise, the composition of the reaction mixture used was 10% C2H6/5% O2/85% He and the W/F ratio was kept constant at 0.24 g s/cm3. The reaction products were analyzed on line by a PerkinElmer gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Two columns in a series-bypass configuration were used in the analysis: a Porapak Q and a MS 5 A. The main reaction products were C2H4, CO2 and H2O. The concentration of CO as well as that of oxygenates was under detection limits. Ethane conversion and selectivity to the reaction products were calculated on a carbon basis. Closure of the carbon mass-balance was better than ±1%. The contribution of gas-phase initiated reactions was tested by conducting experiments using an empty-volume reactor. The conversion of ethane at these experiments was lower than 1%, confirming that gas-phase reactions are negligible at the experimental conditions used for the activity tests.
2.2.1. Effect of feed composition
All experiments were contacted in a fixed bed quartz reactor, in the temperature range 300–400 °C. For the determination of the effect of C2H6/O2 ratio three different compositions of the reaction mixture were tested, 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1 respectively, achieved with 10% constant ethane partial pressure and varying oxygen concentration (balance He). For the impact of the total reactants pressure (density of reactant mixture) on the activity and selectivity of the reaction, three different compositions of the reactant mixture were used: 20% C2H6/10% O2, 15% C2H6/7.5% O2 and 10% C2H6/5% O2 (balance He). Finally, the effect of C2H4 and CO2 presence in the reactant mixture was investigated by adding C2H4 or CO2 respectively in a standard reactor feed of 10% C2H6/5% O2/ He at 350 °C.
2.2.2. Effect of reactants admission mode
For the investigation of staged oxygen admission, the case of a double catalytic bed was experimentally studied. At the first catalytic bed, a reactant mixture composition of 10% C2H6/2.5% O2/He was used as a feed. The outlet composition of this first bed was then used as feed to the second bed, with simultaneous addition of 2.5% O2. A multiple staged oxygen admission was further simulated based on the previously reported (Heracleous and Lemonidou, 2006b) kinetic model of ethane ODH over the Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox mixed oxide, using Matlab software. At each stage/catalytic bed the catalyst weight was optimized in order to achieve complete O2 conversion and the C2H6/O2 ratio was kept constant and equal to 10.
The possibility of redox-decoupling operation was investigating by conducting Temperature Programmed Reaction (TPRe) experiments over NiNbO. The experiments were performed under steady flow conditions in a specially designed apparatus allowing fast response times. A U-shaped quartz reactor was used, equipped with a coaxial thermocouple for temperature monitoring. The catalytic sample (50 mg), initially activated in a 10% O2/He flow at 450 °C for 30 min and subsequently cooled down to room temperature, was heated up to 600oC in a 5% C2H6/He flow (50 cm3/min) at a constant rate of 10 °C/min. The reactor exit was monitored on-line by a quadrupole mass analyzer (Omnistar, Balzers) following (m/z) fragments 2 (H2), 18 (H2O), 24 (C2H4), 28 (CO), 30 (C2H6), 40 (Ar) and 44 (CO2).
2.2.3. Effect of reactor type
The effect of reactor configuration as a means to maximize ethylene yield was investigated through experiments in a fluidized bed reactor using the experimental setup described above for fixed bed experiments with appropriate adjustments. The reactants were fed via a quartz distributor at the bottom of the same quartz reactor that was described above. The gases were passed through a cyclone to remove solid particles. Catalyst particles in the range of 45–105 μm showed good fluidization behavior. Inert quartz particles were added to act as a coadjutant of fluidization, having similar particle size to that of the catalyst used. Approximately 1.6 g of catalyst and quartz mixture were used (0.4 g of catalyst and 1.2 g of quartz). The height of the catalyst bed was 3 cm. The reacting mixture composition and the catalyst pretreatment conditions were the same as in the fixed bed. The minimum fluidization velocity, calculated theoretically and also confirmed experimentally, was equal to 0.67 cm/s. Both the effect of temperature at a constant superficial velocity equal to 1.65Umf and the effect of superficial velocity on the catalyst activity/ selectivity at 350 °C were investigated, maintaining bubbling bed flow conditions using a total flow of 40–100 cm3/min. The reacting mixture composition and the catalyst pretreatment conditions were the same as in the fixed bed.
2.2.4. Catalyst stability
The catalyst deactivation was investigated under fuel-rich conditions (almost complete oxygen conversion). The composition of the reaction mixture used was 10% C2H6/5% O2/85% He and the W/F ratio was kept constant at 0.24 g s/cm3. Ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity were constantly monitored for 100 h on stream at 400 °C. Experimental data were obtained every 30 min by means of the online GC system described above.
The effect of water on catalyst stability was investigated by subjecting Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox catalyst to a 75% H2O/25% He flow at 450 °C for 2.5 h and 5 h. The catalyst was subsequently tested in ethane ODH reaction (10% C2H6/5% O2/85% He, W/F=0.24 g s/cm3, T=300–400 °C).
3. Results-discussion
3.1. Effect of feed composition
3.1.1. C2H6/O2 ratio
The activity and selectivity of the NiNbO mixed oxide catalyst in the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction as a function of ethane-to-oxygen ratio was explored under steady state conditions between 300 and 400 °C. Oxygen partial pressure was varied, whilst ethane partial pressure was kept constant and equal to 10% (balance helium).
Ethane conversion is plotted in Fig. 1 as a function of temperature. Increasing C2H6/O2 ratio leads as expected to lower ethane conversions. Initial ethane conversion at 300 oC is only slightly affected by the C2H6/O2 ratio variation, but as the temperature increases the effect becomes more obvious as oxygen is depleted in the reaction mixture. At 400 °C, a stepwise decrease of 25% in ethane conversion is recorded as the C2H6/O2 ratio changes from 1:1 to 2:1 to 3:1. On the other hand, as expected, O2 conversion increases with increasing C2H6/O2 ratio (Fig. 1).

The high selectivity of the NiNbO catalyst is further enhanced by appropriate tuning of the oxygen content in the reaction mixture. As shown in Fig. 2, increasing C2H6/O2 ratio leads to a significant increase in selectivity towards ethylene. In particular, a change in C2H6/O2 ratio from 1:1 to 3:1 leads to a 10% increase of the initial selectivity in ethylene, indicating that lower O2 levels hinder the oxidation of ethane to CO2 and promote the selective conversion of ethane feedstock to ethene. The result is in line with previous kinetic studies (Table 1) (Heracleous and Lemonidou, 2006b), demonstrating that oxidation reactions leading to CO2 formation have a strong dependence on oxygen, as indicated by the relatively high reaction order with respect to O2. In conclusion, the C2H6/O2 ratio of 2:1 seems to be the best trade-off between high selectivity and satisfactory conversion.

3.1.2. Effect of reactants pressure
Taking into account the above results and selecting C2H6/O2=2 as the optimum ratio, the effect of the reactants' partial pressure was investigated by conducting experiments in the 300–400 °C temperature range with the following reaction mixture compositions: 20% C2H6/10% O2, 15% C2H6/7.5% O2, 10% C2H6/5% O2 (balance He). In all cases, total flow and W/F ratio were kept constant (Ft=100 cc/min, W/F=0.24 g s/cm3). The impact of introducing a denser reactant mixture in the catalytic reactor on ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity at 300 °C and 400 °C is shown in Fig. 3. Ethane conversion does not seem to be significantly affected by increasing reactants' partial pressure, while on the other hand ethylene selectivity slightly decreases. To shed more light on the above results, the response of ethane and oxygen consumption rates and ethylene and carbon dioxide production rate to the density of the reactant mixture at 400 °C is depicted in Fig. 4. As expected, an increase in the reactants' partial pressure leads in general to a linear increase in all consumption/ formation rates. This increase can explain the fact that ethane conversion remains largely unaffected, despite the fact that actually more ethane is inserted in the reactor. However, the effect of total reactants pressure is not the same on all reactants/products. Based on the previously extracted power-law kinetics (Heracleous and Lemonidou, 2006b) reproduced in Table 1, the power of the total reactants' partial pressure in the primary oxidation of ethane to carbon dioxide is higher than that in oxydehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. Thus, an increased ethane and oxygen partial pressure causes a higher relative increase in CO2 than C2H4 formation rate (Fig. 4), according to the selectivity results (Fig. 3). It should be stressed, however, that despite a slight decrease in ethylene selectivity, introducing a denser reactant mixture in the catalytic reactor leads to increased ethylene productivity in terms of ethylene production rate per catalyst weight.

3.1.3. Effect of C2H4 and CO2
In industrial reactors, the presence of large amounts of reaction products often inhibits or promotes the course of the reaction. Fig. 5 illustrates the impact of increasing amounts of C2H4 and CO2 in the reaction feed on C2H6 conversion. The presence of ethylene seems to hinder ethane activation, since ethane conversion decreases. As ethylene partial pressure in the feed increases, the extent of ethylene oxidation reaction consequently increases in expense of ethane consumption. Taking one step further, one could deduce that ethylene competitively adsorbs on ethane activation catalytic sites, as has already been proposed in previous mechanistic studies of ethane ODH over the NiNbO system (Heracleous and Lemonidou, 2006b).

On the other hand, the presence of CO2 has a milder effect on C2H6 conversion, as shown in Fig. 5. In fact, the presence of carbon dioxide as a by-product has no important impact on ethane conversion, considering the fact that, due to high ethylene selectivity, under reaction conditions CO2 concentration is much lower than the values used for this study.
3.2. Effect of reactants admission mode
3.2.1. Staged oxygen admission
According to the results presented above, a relatively high value of ethane to oxygen ratio is required in order to minimize the unselective reactions of primary ethane and secondary ethylene combustion. Moreover, according to the previously developed kinetic model (Table 1), high oxygen partial pressures favor CO2 formation. Nevertheless, at a given temperature, lowering oxygen levels in the reactant mixture leads to reduced ethane conversion. Based on the above, staged oxygen admission in the catalytic reactor could be used as a means to ensure a high ethane to oxygen ratio while keeping oxygen partial pressure at the required level for a satisfactory ethane conversion. The double bed concept with intermediate oxygen admission was studied experimentally by conducting two separate experiments in which the outlet stream composition of the first experiment was used as feed in the second experiment with the addition of oxygen. A schematic representation of the experimental setup is depicted in Fig. 6a.

Fig. 6. Schematic representation of the double bed concept with intermediate oxygen admission: experimental conditions and results over Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox mixed oxide.
As shown in Fig. 6a, almost complete oxygen conversion is practically achieved in the first catalytic bed, with a 24% ethane conversion. The outlet of the first bed was used as inlet in the second bed, with parallel addition of another 2.5% O2. In this second reactor, ethane and oxygen conversion was 24% and ∼100% respectively. C2H6 conversion remains almost the same in both beds, as a result of the counteracting of (a) lower C2H6/O2 ratio that leads to higher conversion levels and (b) C2H4 presence in the feed inhibiting ethane consumption. An overall comparison of the two operational modes (single versus double bed) is presented in Fig. 6b, where the single bed corresponds to catalyst weight equal to the sum of the two beds. Staged oxygen admission at inlet and in the middle of the reactor leads to an increase of ethylene selectivity from 76% to 79% but in expense of ethane conversion.
In an attempt to yield more generalized information concerning the concept of multiple oxidant admission as an alternative reactor setup for ethane ODH, a multiple staged oxygen admission was further simulated with Matlab, based on the developed kinetic model of ethane ODH over the NiNb mixed oxide (Heracleous and Lemonidou, 2006b). Starting with 10% C2H6 at the reactor inlet, at each stage/catalytic bed the catalyst weight was optimized in order to achieve complete O2 conversion, while keeping the C2H6/O2 ratio constant and equal to 10. Table 2 summarizes the computational results. After seven successive catalytic beds and/or oxygen entry points, a C2H6 conversion of 49% and an increased C2H4 selectivity of 83% were achieved, as compared to the base case of single bed operation. However, in order to compare the above results with the single staged O2 admission, one should take into consideration that approximately seven times more catalyst was needed (5.6 g compared to 0.8 g for the single bed reactor). Overall, the results point out to the fact that high selectivity at high conversion levels can be achieved with the concept of staged oxygen admission, at the expense of high reaction rates and reactor simplicity.

3.2.2. Cyclic feed (redox/decoupling operation)
Based on the above conclusion that monitoring oxygen partial pressure could -under certain operating conditions- lead to enhanced ethylene yield, it could be envisaged that the complete separation of the two steps in the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism – catalyst partial reduction induced by ethane oxidation via catalyst lattice oxygen and catalyst re-oxidation by gaseous oxygen – could also improve the catalytic performance. The above concept was investigated by Temperature Programmed reaction TPRe experiments using ethane feed and monitoring the reactor outlet with mass analyzer. As shown in Fig. 7, which shows the profiles of C2H6 consumption and product formation with programmed increase of temperature, no ethane activation occurred until ∼460 °C. At this temperature, a sharp decrease of C2H6 signal was monitored, followed by CO2, H2O and H2 evolution. Ethane signal does not appear again until ∼500 °C. At this temperature, CO2 and H2O signals disappear and the evolution of CO and a second peak of H2 are monitored. Judging from the above signal profiles, it can be deduced that a number of oxidation, dehydrogenation and reforming reactions take place in the absence of gas phase oxygen over NiNbO mixed oxide. In particular, the formation of CO2 and H2O indicates the occurrence of oxidation reactions, taking place by consumption of the catalyst lattice oxygen. At the same time, dehydrogenation of ethane also takes place. The above reactions lead to fast catalyst reduction and reforming reactions catalyzed by metallic Ni commence at ∼500 °C. As temperature increases ethane conversion decreases probably due to the accumulation of coke on the catalyst surface, as further evidenced by subsequent oxidation of the sample. It is worth mentioning that the above experiment was repeated using different feed composition and/or catalyst weight in order to minimize ethane conversion; however at these conditions the catalyst was immediately reduced by ethane leading to undesired reaction products, as Ni0 is generally known to catalyze reforming reactions followed by H2 formation.

Nickel oxide is an easily reduced oxide. H2-Temperature Programmed Reduction (H2-TPR) studies conducted and published in several works (e.g. Heracleous and Lemonidou, 2006a, Li et al., 2009, Schuurman et al., 1997, Wu et al., 2006) point to a complete reduction of nickel oxide at temperatures between 300°–420 °C. Introduction of a second non-reducible metal was found to facilitate NiO reduction (Heracleous and Lemonidou, 2006a, Heracleous and Lemonidou, 2010), leading to even lower reduction temperatures. According to our previous findings, Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox mixed oxide presents a reduction maximum at 360 °C (Heracleous and Lemonidou, 2006a). It is thus well established that at temperatures as high as 450 °C, NiNbO catalyst is easily reduced by ethane leading to Ni0 formation, providing a satisfactory explanation for the almost immediate “runaway” towards undesired reaction pathways when ethane feed is used. Similar results were also observed over the less easily reduced MoO3/Al2O3 catalyst at elevated temperatures (>600 °C) when C2H6/He was used as feed in temperature programmed experiments (Heracleous and Lemonidou, 2004). To conclude, operating in a redox-decoupling mode does not seem to appear as an option over NiNbO mixed oxide catalyst. Although suppressing oxygen partial pressure was found to increase ethylene selectivity, a minimum oxygen concentration is required in order to maintain the catalyst in oxidized state.
3.3. Fluidized bed operation mode
As mentioned in Section 1, the use of fluidized bed reactor offers significant advantages since it improves process safety and allows very good control of the reaction temperature. NiNbO catalyst was tested in a fluidized bed reactor and the results were compared to those obtained under fixed bed operation conditions. For the determination of the catalytic activity of as a function of temperature, the superficial gas-phase velocity was kept constant and equal to u=1.65Umf, while different superficial velocities were used in order to achieve different conversion levels at constant tempeature and account for ethylene selectivity. As shown in Fig. 8, although the two operation modes (fixed versus fluidized bed) cannot be directly compared to one another since they are conducted under totally different flow conditions, the employment of fluidized bed conditions did not result in any important changes regarding ethane conversion and selectivity towards ethylene. In particular, ethylene selectivity remains practically the same compared to fixed bed operation mode indicating that no important backmixing phenomena take place that would favor ethylene oxidation. According to Klose et al., the comparison of different types of reactor for the ethane oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, resulted in almost identical profiles of selectivity versus conversion plots for fixed and fluidized bed of V2O5/γ-Al2O3 catalyst (Ahchieva et al., 2005). Similarly, results reported in (Lemonidou and Machli, 2007) showed that propane conversion and selectivity to propylene follow the same trend as under fixed bed conditions with increasing reaction temperature for V2O5–MgO/TiO2 catalyst in propane ODH. To conclude, preliminary testing of the NiNbO catalyst under fluid bed conditions proves quite promising. It is also worthy to note that even though the catalyst was not subjected to any special pretreatment, NiNbO catalyst was resistant to attrition phenomena, as no catalyst microrparticles were collected in the cyclone placed in the reactor exit for at least 5 h on stream.

3.4. Catalyst stability
The stability of the NiNbO mixed oxide catalyst with time on stream was investigated under fuel-rich and high conversion conditions, since the industrial aim is to operate at complete oxygen conversion, in order to minimize separation costs. A C2H6/O2 ratio equal to 2, with 10% C2H6/5% O2 mixture composition was used and the temperature was kept constant at 400 °C. In general, NiNbO presents a satisfactory stability with time on stream. After 88 h under fuel-rich and high conversion conditions, the catalyst only slightly deactivates, as conversion decreases from 40% to 36%, as shown in Fig. 9. At the same time, oxygen conversion was reduced about 10% (not shown). Remarkably, this slight deactivation of the NiNbO catalyst does not involve almost any change in selectivity towards ethylene. Major losses in ethylene selectivity would render the catalyst inappropriate for industrial use. The NiNbO mixed-oxide however seems to preserve its ability to selectively convert ethane to ethylene with time on stream.

Fig. 9. Long time performance of Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox catalyst (400 °C, C2H6/O2 ratio=2, 10% C2H6/5% O2/He).
At 88 h the catalytic system was subjected to 15% O2/He flow for 30 min at 450 °C in an attempt to regenerate/reoxidize the catalyst. The temperature was reduced back to 400 °C under helium flow and the stability test was then resumed maintaining the experimental conditions described above. As shown in Fig. 9, oxygen treatment did not have any significant effect on the catalytic behavior. This indicates that catalyst slight deactivation does not involve nickel oxide reduction or at least that this phenomenon is not the determining factor for catalyst deactivation.
A specific surface area of 51 m2/g was measured for the used sample, significantly lower than that of the fresh NiNbO sample, as shown in Table 3. Although a ∼40% reduction in surface area was recorded, the porosimetry study showed no change in the pores diameter. Instead, a reduction in the total pore volume was observed (from 0.34 cm3/g to 0.20 cm3/g), indicating no change in the pore structure but loss of part of the pores. This loss may be partly responsible for the observed reduction in surface area. At this point, it is worthy to notice that the level of ethane conversion decrease is lower than expected by the decrease in surface area, indicating that the occurrence of other structural changes during 100 h TOS is possible. Moreover, Fig. 10 illustrates the diffractograms obtained for the used catalytic sample, plus that of fresh catalyst as a reference. Apart from the multiple diffraction lines attributed to the quartz particles, the used sample exhibits diffraction lines identical to the fresh catalytic sample, corresponding to a NiO-like phase. This indicates that no new phase was formed after 100 h on stream, at least within the XRD detection limits, unlike previous observations by Millet et al. (Savova et al., 2010), where the formation of crystalline NiNb2O6 was evidenced. Finally, TGA analysis of the used catalyst in air flow (not shown) confirmed that no significant coke formation took place during 100 h time on stream. It was also once again confirmed that the slight deactivation of the catalytic material was not due to reduction, since no weight increase was recorded.

Fig. 10. XRD patterns of fresh, used in stability test and after steaming for 2.5 and 5 h Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox samples.
During ethane oxidative dehydrogenation, ethylene production is accompanied by the formation of equimolar amount of water, while water is also produced by the unselective oxidation of ethane and ethylene. Generally, steam could constitute a deactivation factor, causing severe morphological changes to the solid catalyst (Forzatti and Lietti, 1999). Accelerated deactivation processes are in several cases used in order to study catalyst deactivation (Trimm, 1997). In the present study, in an attempt to quantify the effect of water on catalyst stability the fresh NiNbO catalyst was subjected to steam treatment (75% H2O/25% He flow at 450 °C for 2.5 h and 5 h) and was then tested in ethane ODH reaction.
The NiNbO samples after 2.5 h and 5 h of steaming, designated as NiNb-s2.5 and NiNb-s5 respectively, were characterized after the steam treatment to account for any changes in morphology, and the results are tabulated in Table 3. A significant surface area reduction was recorded for both 2.5 and 5 h of steaming (Table 3). Moreover, the formation of small NiNb2O6 crystallites was evidenced by X-ray diffraction analysis in both samples (Fig. 10). The catalytic results are shown in Table 3. Selectivity towards ethylene appears slightly enhanced after the steaming procedure, while ethane conversion slightly decreases over both samples. However, beneficial structural changes might also be induced by the steaming procedure, since once again the level of ethane conversion decrease is lower than expected by the decrease in surface area.
Overall, NiNbO mixed oxide proved to be a relatively stable catalyst, since no important deactivation phenomena were recorded after 100 h TOS. Moreover, the catalytic performance of NiNbO in ethane ODH remained practically unaffected after severe steam treatment. The latter conclusion becomes of particular importance taking into consideration that steam is preferably used as a diluent in industrial processes.
4. Conclusions
The scope of this research paper was the investigation of engineering aspects affecting ethylene production in ethane ODH over Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox catalyst. A wide range of operating variables has therefore been investigated, including ethane to oxygen ratio and reactant mixture density, influence of the reactor type and oxidant admission mode.
Concerning the effect of feed composition, it was found that ethylene selectivity is enhanced by the use of C2H6/O2 ratios higher than 1. The above results are in accordance with power-law kinetic data, according to which lower O2 levels hinder the oxidation of ethane to CO2 and promote the selective conversion of ethane feedstock to ethene. Furthermore, introducing a denser reactant mixture in the catalytic reactor leads to increased ethylene productivity in terms of ethylene production rate per catalyst weight. However, the relative increase in CO2 than C2H4 formation rate induced by higher reactant mixture partial pressure, causes a slight reduction in ethylene selectivity. Ethane to oxygen ration C2H6/O2=2 and feed composition of 10% C2H6/5% O2 were selected as the best trade-off between optimum selectivity and acceptable ethane conversion level. Moreover, it was found that ethane ODH products (CO2 and C2H4) have a mild effect on C2H6 conversion.
Reactants admission mode as means to maximize ethylene yield was also investigated. Operating in a redox-decoupling mode does not seem possible over Ni0.85Nb0.15 mixed oxide catalyst. Although suppressing oxygen partial pressure was found to increase ethylene selectivity, a minimum oxygen concentration in the reactant mixture is always required in order to maintain the catalyst in oxidized state. On the other hand, experimental and modeling results showed that enhanced ethylene selectivity with high conversion can be achieved with intermediate oxygen injections at optimized bed lengths. In particular, with seven O2 entry points and C2H6/O2 ratio equal to 10 kept constant at each stage, a conversion of 49% with an ethylene selectivity of 83% can be achieved.
Considering reactor type, preliminary testing of the NiNbO catalyst under fluid bed conditions proves quite promising. When employing fluidized bed operation ethylene selectivity remains practically the same compared to fixed bed operation mode, indicating that no important backmixing phenomena take place that would favor ethylene oxidation.
Finally, Ni0.85Nb0.15Ox mixed oxide presented satisfactory stability, as proven both by 100 h on stream stability test, where no important catalyst deactivation took place, and by subjection to a steaming procedure after which the catalytic performance was not deteriorated.
