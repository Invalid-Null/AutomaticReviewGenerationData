Vanadium Oxo Organometallic Species Supported on Silica for the Selective Non-oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane
Abstract
The molecular complex [V(═O)(Mes)3] (1) reacts with silica partially dehydroxylated at 700 °C (SiO2-700) to afford [(≡SiO)V(═O)(Mes)2] (2) as the major surface species, while a bis-grafted surface species [(≡SiO)2V(═O)(Mes)] (3) is obtained on SiO2-200. These surface species were characterized by DRIFT, Raman, 1H, 13C, and 51V solid-state NMR, and XAFS spectroscopy and show an activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane at 500 °C. The bipodal surface organometallic complex displays a higher selectivity in propylene in comparison to the monopodal species.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propylene is one of the major intermediates in the chemical industry (1) and is generally obtained as a coproduct from steam cracking of heavier hydrocarbons. Because of the increasing demand of propylene, (2) several on-purpose methods for its production have been developed, such as olefin metathesis, (3-6) methanol to olefin, (7, 8) and catalytic dehydrogenation of propane over a heterogeneous catalyst. (9, 10) Dehydrogenation reactions can be performed under oxidative or non-oxidative conditions. The most common path in industrial plants is a straight dehydrogenation (Oleflex process), without O2, but this reaction suffers from some problems. The main issues are limitation in equilibrium conversion, high heat requirements, deactivation of the catalyst (and so the necessity to regenerate it), and formation of byproducts due to cracking of propane. (11) On the other hand, non-oxidative dehydrogenation catalysis often affords higher selectivity to the desired alkene, avoids CO2 formation, and produces valuable hydrogen.
Most of the catalysts are based on supported transition-metal systems. For instance, supported noble-metal particles with or without promoter have been widely used. (12-15) On the other hand, a rather important and less expensive class of heterogeneous dehydrogenation catalysts involving group V and VI isolated metal centers (Cr, V) supported on conventional materials (silica, alumina, titania) has a central role in an industrial context. (16, 17)
For example, the chromium system has been extensively studied, and the active sites are believed to be chromium in its tri- or divalent state. (18-20) Nevertheless, the mechanism of the C–H activation of propane and propylene release by β-H elimination is still a matter of debate. (21) Previous research efforts have shown that the activity of this reaction depends on the size of the metal oxo units: when CrOx is deposited on high-surface-area supports, the activity of the catalyst increases with the chromium dispersion. (18) This suggests that CrOx units with different degrees of oligomerization and connectivities to the support show different catalytic behavior. Surface chromium sites may be present as either monomeric or polymeric species. Consequently, high loadings are often required.
Conversely, vanadium(V) oxide supported on silica, alumina, or titania show promising activities in catalytic light alkane dehydrogenation. (11, 21-25) These vanadium catalysts are generally prepared via impregnation or sol–gel processes using oxovanadium(V) complexes. (26, 27) However, as observed for their chromium counterparts, the classical preparation methods yield a mixture of monomeric, dimeric, and polymeric VOx species on the surface, which prevents a reliable identification of the active sites. Nevertheless, the active specie has been proposed to be an isolated vanadium center on the surface bearing an oxo ligand in its coordination sphere. (28-30) Many attempts to characterize the surface active site of supported VOx species using spectroscopic techniques for bulk systems such as XAFS and 51V MAS NMR led to inconsistent results. (31-38) This active center is in low concentration in classical heterogeneous catalysts, thus further hampering their characterization along with the determination of the mechanism and of the initiation and deactivation steps. The preparation of well-defined “single site” supported metal oxo catalysts therefore presents a significant scientific interest, especially for non-oxidative dehydrogenation, (22) which has been poorly described. The structural uniformity inherent to molecular organometallic precursors will lead to well-defined supported vanadium oxo catalysts by surface organometallic chemistry (SOMC). Furthermore, Stair and Marks recently probed the influence of the structure of vanadium organometallic precursors onto the nuclearity and mode of interaction with θ-Al2O3 upon their grafting. (39)
In this paper, we investigate the reactivity of [V(═O)(Mes)3] (Mes = 2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) (40-42) with silica, as a continuation of our ongoing study on supported metal oxo complexes (43, 44) as models for industrial catalysts. These well-defined surface species have further been characterized by DRIFT, solid-state NMR, UV–vis, Raman, and XAFS spectroscopy and studied in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in a continuous-flow reactor.

General Procedure
All experiments were carried out using standard air-free methodology in an argon-filled glovebox, on a Schlenk line, or in a Schlenk-type apparatus interfaced to a high-vacuum line (10–5 Torr). Solvents were purified and dried according to standard procedures. [V(═O)(Mes)3] was synthesized in two steps according to published methods. (40-42) Elemental analyses were performed at Mikroanalytisches Labor Pascher. Released compounds during the grafting were performed on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 series II gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector and HP5 column (30 m × 0.32 mm). Transmission infrared spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 5700 FT-IR using an infrared cell equipped with CaF2 windows, allowing in situ studies. Typically 16 scans were accumulated for each spectrum (resolution 4 cm–1). Diffuse-reflectance infrared spectra were collected by a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR spectrophotometer in 4 cm–1 resolution. An airtight IR cell with CaF2 window was applied, and the final spectra comprise 64 scans. Confocal Raman spectra were acquired using the 488 nm line of an Ar ion laser (Melles Griot). The excitation beam was focused on the sample by a 50× working distance microscope, and the scattered light was analyzed by an air-cooled CCD (Labram HR, Horiba Jobin Yvon). The fluorescence was subtracted from the spectra for clarity. Diffuse-reflectance UV–vis spectra in the range 200–850 nm were taken on a PerkinElmer λ1050 UV–vis–near-IR spectrophotometer adapted with the Praying Mantis optical unit provided by Harrick. The samples were diluted in dry BaSO4, and the spectra were recorded against a BaSO4 baseline. An airtight cell with quartz windows was used.
Solution NMR spectra were recorded on an Avance-300 Bruker spectrometer. All chemical shifts were measured relative to residual 1H or 13C resonances in the deuterated solvent: C6D6, δ 7.15 ppm for 1H, 128 ppm for 13C. Solid-state NMR spectra were acquired with an Avance II 800 spectrometer (1H, 800.13 MHz; 13C, 201.21 MHz; 51V, 210.30 MHz). For 1H experiments, the spinning frequency was 20 kHz, the recycle delay was 5 s, and 16 scans were collected using a 90° pulse excitation of 3 μs. The 13C CP MAS spectrum was obtained at a spinning frequency of 20 kHz, with a recycle delay of 5 s, and 10312 scans were collected. Optimal resolution was achieved using the PISARRO decoupling at an rf field strength of 70 kHz and with a decoupling pulse unit of 45 μs, corresponding to 0.9τR (where τR is the rotor period). The Hartmann–Hahn conditions were optimized with a ramped radio frequency (rf) field centered at 50 kHz applied on protons, while the carbon rf field was matched to obtain the optimal signal. The contact time was set to 10 ms. The same CP and decoupling conditions were used for the acquisition of the two-dimensional HETCOR spectrum. The number of collected scans was limited to 688, with a recycling delay of 5 s and 50 t1 increments in the 1H dimension, leading to a total experimental time of 48 h. Chemical shifts are given in ppm with respect to TMS as external reference for 1H and 13C NMR. The 51V MAS NMR spectrum was recorded using a single pulse excitation with a small pulse angle (π/8). Two spinning rates were used to determine the isotropic chemical shift. Further experimental details are given in the corresponding figure captions. The 51V chemical shift was referenced with respect to crystalline V2O5 used as an external standard (δ −609 ppm). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments were performed on a Bruker EXELSYS spectrometer at room temperature. A microwave frequency ν of 9.813 GHz and a power of 30 mW were used. The relative spin concentration and the g factor were calculated using g mark as an internal standard. The reactor cell for EPR measurements was made of quartz (4 mm i.d.) and was normally charged with 0.01 g samples. X-ray absorption spectra were acquired at the A1 beamline of the DORIS ring, DESY, in Hasylab, Hamburg, Germany (project no. I-20110747EC), at room temperature at the vanadium K edge, with a double-crystal Si(111) monochromator detuned 70% to reduce the higher harmonics of the beam. The spectra were recorded in the transmission mode between 5.3 and 6.5 keV. In the edge area, spectra were acquired from 5435 to 5540 eV with 0.5 eV monochromator steps. The molecular complexes homogeneously mixed with dry BN and the supported V samples were packaged as pellets within an argon-filled drybox in a double-airtight sample holder equipped with Kapton windows. This type of cell has already been used for air-sensitive compounds. (45, 46) Energy calibration was performed by using the spectrum of the V calibration foil (K edge 5465.1 eV), recorded simultaneously for each sample. The spectra analyzed were the results of four such acquisitions, and no evolution could be observed between the first and last acquisition. The data analyses were performed by standard procedures, using in particular the program Athena (47) and the EXAFS fitting program RoundMidnight, (48) from the “MAX” package, using spherical waves.
The program FEFF8 was used to calculate theoretical files for phases and amplitudes based on model clusters of atoms. (49) The value of the scale factor, S02 = 0.77, was determined from the k1, k2, and k3·χ(k) spectra of a reference compound, a sample of the molecular complex V(O)(mesityl)3 diluted in BN and carefully mixed and pressed as a pellet (one oxygen at 1.58(1) Å and three carbons at 2.05(2) Å in the first coordination sphere, with further carbon atoms, six at 3.06(3) Å and six at 3.35(4) Å).
The refinements were performed by fitting the structural parameters Ni, Ri, and σi and the energy shift ΔE0 (the same for all shells). The fit residue, ρ (%), was calculated by the formula
As recommended by the Standards and Criteria Committee of the International XAFS Society, the quality factor, (Δχ)2/ν, where ν is the number of degrees of freedom in the signal, was calculated and its minimization considered in order to control the number of variable parameters in the fits. The fits were conducted by first considering the coordinated ligands of the complexes and then by adding further backscatterers in order to improve the fits. For both silica-supported complexes 2 and 3, considering only the first sphere, one oxo ligand was considered and the coordination numbers of O (siloxy) and C (mesityl) ligands were set free to vary in noninteger values with one constraint (NO + NC = 4.0 for VV), in order to reduce the number of variable parameters in the fit but also to consider, for instance, the possibility of mixtures of mono- and bis-siloxy species in both preparations. Satisfactory fits were obtained with values in agreement with the foreseen coordination numbers, within the error margins, for the monosiloxy-supported vanadium complex 2 on SiO2-700 (one oxo (1.58(2) Å), 1.1 ± 0.4 for NO (theory, 1; 1.78(3) Å) and 1.9 ± 0.4 for NC (theory, 2; 2.02(3) Å)) and the bis-siloxy-supported vanadium complex 3 on SiO2-200 (one oxo (1.59(2) Å, 1.9 ± 0.3 for NO (theory, 2; 1.79(3) Å) and 1.1 ± 0.3 for NC (theory, 1; 2.08(3) Å)). In both cases the important decays of (Δχ)2/ν justified taking into account a third type of backscatterer in the fit of the first coordination sphere of these complexes (oxo, O and C) in comparison to fits with only two shells. Further improvements of the fit were carried out with integer values for neighboring numbers for silica-supported complexes 2 and 3. The inclusion of a supplementary shell with silicon did not lead to statistical improvements of the fits.
Preparation and Characterization of 2 and 3
Prior to the grafting reactions, the molecular precursor [V(═O)(Mes)3] (1) was synthesized in two steps. (40, 50) A mixture of 1 (300 mg, 0.70 mmol) and SiO2-(700) (2 g) in pentane (10 mL) was stirred at 25 °C for 2 h. After filtration, the solid, 2, was washed five times with pentane and the liquid was transferred into another reactor in order to quantify mesitylene evolved during grafting by using p-xylene as internal standard. The resulting red powder was dried under vacuum (10–5 Torr). Analysis by gas chromatography indicated the formation of 503 μmol of mesitylene during the grafting (0.9 ± 0.1 mesitylene/V). Anal. Found: V, 1.40; C, 5.63. 1H MAS NMR (800 MHz): δ 6.3, 2.5, 1.9 ppm. 13C CP MAS NMR (200 MHz): δ 143, 137, 125, 23, 19 ppm. The same procedure was employed for SiO2-200 to yield 3, with formation of 607 μmol of mesitylene during the grafting (1.9 ± 0.1 mesitylene/V). Anal. Found: V, 1.64; C, 3.06. 1H MAS NMR (800 MHz): δ 6.4, 2.5, 2.0 ppm.13C CP MAS NMR (200 MHz): δ 143, 136, 124, 24, 19 ppm.
In Situ Characterization of the Formation of 2 and 3 by IR Spectroscopy
SiO2 (around 20 mg) was pressed into an 18 mm self-supporting disk, adjusted in a sample holder, and introduced into a glass or quartz reactor equipped with CaF2 windows. The supports were dehydroxylated at 200 or 700 °C. Complex 1 was impregnated at 25 °C in pentane onto the silica disk. After 2 h of reaction, subsequent washings, and drying, an infrared spectrum was recorded.
Catalyst Evaluation
The catalytic performance of propane conversion was carried out in a stainless steel continuous-flow reactor (Ptotal = 1 bar, T = 500 °C, total flow rate 5 mL min–1 (20% of propane in argon), catalyst 1 g). The gases were purified with a column of molecular sieves and activated Cu2O/Al2O3 and controlled by Brooks mass flow controllers. The catalyst was charged in the glovebox. A four-way valve allowed isolation of the charged catalyst in the reactor from the environment and extensive purging of the tubes before the reaction. The products were determined by an online HP 6890 GC instrument equipped with a 50 m KCl/Al2O3 column and FID.

Vibrational Spectroscopic Studies of the Grafting of VO(Mes)3 on Silica
Silica pellets were used to follow the grafting reaction using transmission IR spectroscopy. The band attributed to isolated silanols νOH at 3747 cm–1 on SiO2-(700) almost fully disappeared, in agreement with the expected silanolysis reaction (Figure 1a). The weak band centered at 3600 cm–1 is the result of OH vibration modes from residual silanols in interactions with aromatic moieties (Figure 1a), causing red shifts of 140–150 cm–1 with an almost doubled half-width. (46, 51) Concomitantly, two groups of bands appeared in the 3200–2700 and 1600–1300 cm–1 regions, assigned respectively to νCH, δCH, and aromatic C–C vibrations from the perhydrocarbyl ligands. The IR vibration band of the V═O being hidden by the silica network’s own vibrations, we relied on Raman spectroscopy. In Figure 1b, the Raman spectra of 1 and 2 are compared. Both spectra are very similar. A characteristic broad line of medium intensity is observed around 1035 cm–1 for 2, assigned to the stretching mode of the V═O moiety. (39, 52-55) In comparison, 1 features a band at 1029 cm–1. (50) The lines at about 1700–1100, 900, and 500–620 cm–1 result from mesityl-related modes. However, a notable difference between both spectra is the broadness of the 1035 cm–1 band in 2, related to the presence of Si–O–V in the grafted sample. (56-63)

Figure 1. (left) IR spectra of silica2-700 (a) and sample after grafting of OVMes3 on SiO2-(700) (b). (right) Raman spectra of molecular OVMes3 and sample after grafting on SiO2-(700).
A similar observation is obtained when 1 is grafted on a SiO2-(200) disk (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The main difference is the presence of a larger amount of remaining silanols which are probably in interactions with perhydrocarbyl ligands, resulting in a broad band extending from 3740 to 3250 cm–1.
The irreversible disappearance of the free νSiO-H band and the appearance of νCH and δCH bands and the presence of mesitylene in the liquid phase are in full agreement with a chemical grafting of OVMes3 on silica.
Mass Balance Analyses
In order to establish the mass balance of the grafting of 1 with silica, the reaction was carried out by impregnation. A pentane solution of 1 in excess was impregnated at 25 °C on amorphous silica (Evonik, Aerosil 200) previously partially dehydroxylated under vacuum (10–5 mbar) at 700 °C (SiO2-(700)) or 200 °C (SiO2-(200)). Upon reaction the initially white material yields the red solids 2 and 3, respectively.
First, in the case of SiO2-(700), the V loading obtained is 1.4 wt %, which corresponds to 0.27 mmol of V/g of silica (Table 1). This is also in agreement with the previous IR data, which suggest that all of the silanols have been virtually consumed during the grafting process. During this step, 0.9 equiv of mesitylene per grafted V is released, and the solid obtained, 2, contains around 1.9 mesityl ligands according to elemental analysis. All of these data are therefore consistent with the formation of a monografted surface complex as a major species, which can be tentatively formulated as [(≡SiO)V(═O)(Mes)2] (2) (Scheme 1). Second, in the case of SiO2-(200), this impregnation method also gives a red solid, 3, with a slightly higher vanadium loading, ca. 1.6 wt %, that corresponds to 0.31 mmol of V/g of silica (SiO2-(200)). Carbon elemental analysis of the solid 3 along with the mesitylene released is consistent with the bis-grafted V complex [(≡SiO)2V(═O)(Mes)], surrounded by an average of 0.9 mesityl ligand. Conversely, 0.65 mmol (2.1 × 0.31) of OH/g of silica has been consumed, while SiO2-(200) contains 0.86 mmol of OH/g, and therefore some OH groups (24%) have not been consumed during this process. A similar phenomenon has already been observed for grafting of bulky organometallic complexes on silica. (64)

UV–Vis Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy
The UV–vis spectrum of 2 comprises multiple absorption bands from 600 to 200 nm (Figure 2). Note that the absence of any absorption in the d → d transition part of the spectrum strongly suggests that the grafted vanadium species is in the highest oxidation state. (65) The broad peak in the visible region (λmax 467 nm) can be assigned to the ligand to metal charge transfer (LMCT) originating from the mesityl ligands. Further absorption in the UV region extending from 350 to 200 nm corresponds to typically a π → π* transition of the aromatic ligand (66, 67) and O → V charge transfer. (29, 54)
Figure 2
Figure 2. UV–vis spectrum of 2.
The energy edge (Eg) derived from the O → V charge transfer peak (determined from the intercept of the [F(R∞)hν]2 vs hν plot in the low-energy rise) reflects the degree of vanadia polymerization. (68) This value is extrapolated to be 4.1 eV for 2, suggesting that the vanadium sites are present as monomers on the surface. (39)
Similar UV–vis spectrum has also been observed for 3 (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Apart from the blue shift in the peak in the visible domain (λmax 442 nm), the rest of the spectrum is virtually the same (Eg = 4.1 eV).
Solid-State NMR Spectroscopy
The high-field solid-state 1H magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR spectrum of 2 displays three signals at 1.9, 2.5, and 6.3 ppm, which correspond respectively to the Mepara, Meortho, and Harom protons of the mesityl ligand (Figure 3a). Accordingly, the 1H–1H DQ MAS spectrum (Figure 3b) features two main correlations A and B, which associate Harom (no on-diagonal signal as expected for an isolated C–H fragment) with respectively Mepara and Meortho. The relative intensity of these signals is in agreement with a 2:1 ratio between the ortho and para Me groups. Furthermore, these methyl moieties give rise to on-diagonal signals featuring a weak correlation (C on Figure 3b).
Figure 3
Figure 3. 1H MAS (a) and 1H–1H DQ MAS (b) NMR spectra of 2 (800.13 MHz, 20 kHz spinning frequency).
The 13C CP/MAS NMR spectrum presents five signals at 19, 23, 125, 137, and 143 ppm (Figure 4b). Furthermore, 2D 1H–13C HETCOR MAS NMR spectroscopy has been performed to assign these peaks. Short contact times (1 ms) have been chosen in order to only detect the protons directly attached to a carbon. Under these conditions, the 2D HETCOR spectrum of 2 shows three strong correlations between proton and carbon signals (δ(1H), δ(13C)): 1.9, 19; 2.5, 23; 6.3, 125 ppm (Figure 4c). The first two signals are assigned to the methyl group in para and ortho positions, whereas the last signal corresponds to the C–H of the aromatic ring. The peaks at 137 and 143 ppm are assigned to the C–CH3 quaternary carbons. The V–C signal of 2 and 3 could not be detected under these conditions. This signal was undetectable even for the molecular complex 1 in CD2Cl2 (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The 1H and 13C spectra of 3 (1/SiO2-(200)) is similar to that of 2 (Figure S4, Supporting Information), except that the signals of the 13C CP/MAS spectrum of 3 are somewhat lower. EPR spectroscopy has excluded the presence of paramagnetic species in the samples (2 and 3). Hence, the lower signal-to-noise ratio of 3 is due to the presence of only one mesityl ligand attached to the vanadium center.
Figure 4
Figure 4. 1H MAS (a), 13C CP MAS (b), and 1H–13C HETCOR (c) NMR spectra of 2 (11.75 T).
51V MAS NMR reveals a signal with an isotropic chemical shift of 412 ppm (Figure 5), as determined by variation of the spinning frequency, which represents an upfield shift of 408 ppm in comparison to the molecular complex (Figure S5, Supporting Information), which resonates at 879 ppm. This result is consistent with the formation of a monopodal surface species on silica-700. In fact, such an upfield shift has been observed in the homogeneous chemistry of V(═O)(CH2SiMe3)3, which is shifted from 1205.7 to 627 ppm upon reaction with triphenylsilanol to form V(═O)(CH2SiMe3)2(OSiPh3). (69) An upfield shift from the free complex to the monografted species (from 0 to −292 ppm) has also been observed for the formation of a monosiloxy surface species by the grafting of VOCl3 onto silica. (27) A similar trend has also been observed in the molecular system (51V NMR −325 ppm for VO(OtBu)Cl2) when a chloride ligand is replaced by a σ oxygen donor. (70) This trend toward higher field has been attributed to a change from a purely σ-donating ligand by one with better π-donating ability. (71) However, no clear signal has been observed for the bipodal 3. The same phenomenon has also been observed by Hermans et al. during the thermal restructuring of vanadium(V) oxo chloride supported on silica and can be explained by a lack of rotation of the vanadium fragment. (72)

X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
XANES Analysis
Normalized V K-edge XANES spectra of the [V(Mes)3·thf] molecular complex, VIV(O)SO4(H2O)x, the [V(═O)(Mes)3] molecular complex 1, and silica-supported species 2 and 3, as well as the vanadium metal calibration foil, are shown in Figure 6. In the spectrum of 1, there is a prominent pre-edge peak. This pre-edge feature arises from electronic transitions from 1s core levels to the empty 3d levels, more or less 4p hybridized by the ligands. These electronic transitions become electric dipole allowed in the absence of an inversion center. In this case, the loss of symmetry permits partial overlapping and mixing of the unfilled d states of the metal with the 4p orbital of the metal. Several studies of the V K-edge XANES features have considered the pre-edge intensity as well as its absolute position to determine both the vanadium oxidation state and its symmetry. (73-75) The position of the pre-edge peak only is generally insufficient to evaluate accurately the vanadium oxidation state. For the different vanadium compounds studied, the position and intensity of the main pre-edge peak along with the position of the edge are reported in Table 2. For complexes 1–3, the position at 4.1–4.7 eV of the intense pre-edge peak from the energy of the foil K-edge, and its high intensity (1.19 to 0.71), are consistent with those observed in other four-coordinated V(V) materials. (74) In addition, the main K edges of the VO(mesityl)3/silica samples are shifted by ca. 18 eV to higher energy relative to the foil, within the range of K-edge energies reported for known V(V) compounds. (73)

EXAFS Analysis
The recording and analysis of the V K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of the molecular vanadium complex 1 and of the supported species resulting from the grafting of 1 onto SiO2-(700) and SiO2-(200) were carried out in order to assess their structure.
For 2, i.e. 1 supported onto SiO2-(700) (Figure 7 and Table 3), the results agree with the following coordination sphere around V: one oxygen atom at 1.57(1) Å attributed to an oxo ligand, ca. one oxygen at 1.78(2) Å attributed to a siloxy ligand (V–OSi≡ σ bond) from the surface, and ca. two carbons at 2.02(2) Å attributed to σ-bonded carbon atoms of mesityl ligands. This is consistent with bond lengths found by XRD for vanadium(V) complexes: V═O (1.575(4) Å) and V–C (2.021–2.080 Å) for O═V(mesityl)3, 1; (50) V═O (1.564(4) Å) and V–O (1.761(4) Å) for [O═V(OC6H3-2,6(i-Pr)2)3]; (76) V═O (1.5933(15) Å) and V–O (1.7906–1.8108 Å) for [O═V(OMe)L] (L = (R,R)-bis(2-phenylethanolato)-(R)-1-phenylethylamine); (77) V═O (1.596(2) Å) and V–O (1.751–1.800 Å) for oxo[O-acetyl-p-tert-butylcalix[4]arenetrihydroxylato]vanadium(V). (78) Similar parameters were obtained when fitting the k3·χ(k) spectrum. Furthermore, the fit was improved (decrease of the quality factor (Δχ)2/ν, from 8.3 to 3.6) when considering a further layer of ca. four backscattering C atoms at 3.01(3) Å, assigned to the closest nonbonding carbons in the aromatic cycle of the mesityl ligands, and ca. four backscattering C atoms at 3.27(3) Å, assigned to the two ortho methyls of each mesityl ligand. The consideration of a silicon shell with or without these further carbon shells did not lead to a statistical improvement of the fit.

Similarly, for 3, supported onto SiO2-(200) (Figure 8 and Table 4), the results agree with a coordination sphere around V composed of one oxygen atom at 1.59(1) Å attributed to an oxo ligand, ca. two oxygens at 1.79(1) Å attributed to siloxy ligands (V–OSi≡ σ bonds) from the surface, and ca. one carbon at 2.08(2) Å attributed to the σ-bonded carbon atom of the mesityl ligand. As in the case of 2, the fit was improved (decrease of the quality factor (Δχ)2/ν, from 5.5 to 3.6) when considering a further layer of ca. two backscattering C atoms at 3.02(5) Å and ca. two backscattering C atoms at 3.31(5) Å. The consideration of a silicon shell with or without these further carbon shells also did not lead to a statistical improvement of the fit.

Catalytic Properties
The reaction of non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (Scheme 2) involves C–H activation, followed by β-H elimination, and finally liberation of propylene and hydrogen.
Scheme 2
Scheme 2. Non-Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane
Because of the high stability of the C–H bond of propane, this reaction is strongly endothermic (ΔH° = 124 kJ mol–1). Moreover, this reaction is equilibrium limited; hence, in order to increase the yield of propylene, a suitable catalyst along with high temperature, low pressure, and dilution of propane in a gas mixture are necessary. (79) Considering these parameters, byproducts such as lighter alkanes and coke can be minimized.
To determine the catalytic performance, the different compounds were probed in the catalytic non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (20% in argon) to propylene in a flow reactor at 1 bar (Figure 9). At a flow rate of 1 mL min–1 of propane and 4 mL min–1 of argon, the reactor was heated from room temperature to 500 °C at a rate of 5 °C min–1. Both surface vanadium species (2 and 3) show similar catalytic performances. Propylene and byproducts are first observed after reaching a temperature of about 400 °C, and due to the endothermic nature of the process, the heating is remarkably slowed down. The byproducts are mainly methane, ethane, and ethylene. At 500 °C, an initial conversion of up to 17% was obtained. Then, the catalysts undergo a slow deactivation and the conversion converged toward 12% (for 3, 9% for 2) after 1 week on stream. The slightly higher activity at extended reaction times may indicate that the bigrafted species is much less prone to forming inactive, oligomeric species that would result from sintering. A negligible quantity of coke is observed at the end of the reaction. After an initial equilibration, the reaction is selective toward propylene (83% for 2; 90% for 3). Selectivity in propylene remained constant with time on stream. The present catalysts prepared by SOMC show higher activity and selectivity to propylene in comparison to V2O5/SiO2, which was reported by Takahara et al. (22) The main reason is most likely due to the presence of multiple inactive (oligomeric) vanadium species on the surface of V2O5/SiO2 prepared classically by aqueous impregnation. Current results also demonstrate that SOMC can provide selectively isolate vanadium sites on the surface and enhance the catalytic performance in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane.

The determination of the mechanism and of the nature of the active species in each step is of high interest. However, these key issues cannot be addressed with our current ex situ characterization techniques. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to believe that the mechanism involves an initiation by C–H activation of propane on the V–mesityl precursor, giving V–propyl species and releasing mesitylene. Then, a β-H transfer occurs to give a V–H and a coordinated propylene. The last step comprised release of propylene and hydrogen after a new C–H activation of propane. Such a reaction pathway has already been documented for the reactivity of alkanes with supported metal hydride catalysts. (80, 81) A second mechanistic pathway may involve cleavage and reconstruction of the V–O bond during the propane activation and product release, as described for the chromium(III) system. (19) This latter mechanism is consistent with earlier reports. First, Harlin et al. observed an increased activity of supported V2O5 in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of n-butane and isobutane after reduction of the catalyst and, thus, related the activity to the reduced valence state of vanadium, either VIV or VIII. (82) The presence of VIII in particular has been demonstrated by Chen et al., who showed the presence of V2O3 by XRD after dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene under nitrogen at 550 °C. (83) Second, further to this finding, Takahara et al. suggested the cleavage of the V–O bond with a concomitant formation of V–O–H sites adjacent to the VIV/VIII, possibly hydride, species when silica-supported V2O5 is reduced under H2. (22) VIV/VIII species are responsible for the dehydrogenation, whereas V–O–H acidic sites are believed to be responsible for the formation of carbonaceous deposits observed in the course of their study. Advanced operando techniques and theoretical calculations will offer additional insights into the reaction mechanism.
Conclusion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In conclusion, we have synthesized supported oxovanadium(V) complexes by surface organometallic chemistry of OVMes3 on SiO2-(700) and SiO2-(200). The resulting respective monopodal [(≡SiO)V(═O)(Mes)2] and bipodal [(≡SiO)2V(═O)(Mes)] have been characterized by elemental analysis and IR, Raman, UV–vis, solid state NMR (1H, 13C, 51V), and XANES/EXAFS spectroscopy. The prepared complexes are active catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene, without O2, with selectivity and activity higher than those for the classical V2O5/SiO2. Thus, site isolation proved to have a beneficial impact on the catalytic performance of these materials in comparison to classical catalysts. Most particularly, the formation of carbonaceous species is strongly minimized in comparison to V2O5 supported on silica, which presents V–O–H acidic sites responsible for the coke formation.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
