 Based on the multiple document extractions provided, it appears the documents are not relevant to propane dehydrogenation research. All extractions indicate the documents focus on modeling char particle combustion, not propane dehydrogenation or conversion of propane to propylene. 

Since the documents do not contain information pertinent to propane dehydrogenation, I have marked the relevance as "No" and left the rest of the XML structure blank, as follows:
