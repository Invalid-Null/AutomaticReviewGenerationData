ZnO Nanoclusters Supported on Dealuminated Zeolite β as a Novel Catalyst for Direct Dehydrogenation of Propane to Propylene
Graphical Abstract
Catalysts with Zing: Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite can be obtained via a two-step post-synthesis method, showing much better catalytic performance for direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene than that on raw Hβ zeolite.
Abstract
Small ZnO nanoclusters supported on dealuminated β zeolite were prepared and evaluated for catalyzing direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH), exhibiting high catalytic performance. N2 sorption, XRD, TEM, 27Al and 28Si MAS NMR, IR, XRF, DR UV-vis, XPS, and NH3-TPD techniques were employed to characterize the physicochemical properties of this novel catalyst system. It is found that the Zn species can be accommodated in the vacant T-atom sites of dealuminated β zeolite due to the reaction of aqueous zinc acetate solution with silanol groups, and thus, producing massive small ZnO nanoclusters as active phases in PDH. Additionally, dealuminated β zeolite can greatly depress side reactions attributable to the absence of strong acid sites, thereby guaranteeing high catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability. As a result, the optimal catalyst of 10 wt% Zn loaded on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits a high initial propane conversion of around 53 % and a superior propylene selectivity of about 93 % at a space velocity of 4000 cm3 gcat−1 h−1, together with the high stability and satisfactory reusability. This study may open a new way to design and synthesize highly active PDH catalysts with high selectivity and stability.
1 Introduction
Propylene is a vital building block in petrochemical industry, which can synthesize numerous high-valued chemical products such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile and so on.1,2,3,4 The traditional ways of producing propylene, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC), cannot produce enough propylene to meet with the market demand ascribed to the depletion of petroleum. Due to the rich source of propane and the great price gap between propane and propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (PDH) has been regarded as one of the most effective ways. The traditional catalysts of PDH reaction are Pt and CrOx based catalysts,5,6 while the former is costly and the latter is noxious. Moreover, both of them are prone to deactivate in a very short time. Thus, the exploit of alternative catalyst systems is of great importance.
Numerous novel catalyst systems such as Zn, Sn, Co, Ga and carbon based catalysts have been reported for catalyzing PDH,3,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 which are void of shortcomings typical of commercial CrOx and Pt based catalysts. Among them, Zn based materials are found to be one of the most promising catalysts due to the low price, environmental-friendly-ness and high catalytic performance in PDH.10,14,15 Several studies have verified that isolated Zn2+ and Zn(OH)+ species are the catalytically active sites in PDH,16,17 while very few investigations put attention on the catalytic activity of small ZnO clusters or nanoparticles. It is reported that ZnO supported on Al2O3 could serve as Lewis acid sites (LAS), which can efficiently catalyze PDH.14 In accordance with previous reports, small ZnO nanoclusters (SN ZnO) are capable of activating C−H bond,18,19 suggesting its potentially catalytic ability for PDH. However, active ZnO nanoclusters are very small and unstable, especially under harsh operation conditions.20 Fortunately, zeolites can provide well-ordered pore structure, as well as steady and antacid conditions for dispersing and anchoring ZnO nanoclusters. In addition, the microporous zeolites are able to tailor the size of ZnO nanoclusters. Therefore, zeolite is one of the best suitable hosts for the preparation of SN ZnO. For instance, Wang et al.21 prepared sub-nanometric ZnO clusters in the micropores of zeolite L by using the incipient wetness impregnation method. Li's group22 encapsulated ZnO clusters inside the channel of zeolites including HZSM-5 and HY. However, all the reports indicated that only a small quantity of ZnO clusters could be introduced into the zeolite frameworks, and most of Zn species would be aggregated on the external surface of zeolite into bulk ZnO. So, the exploitation of new methods to obtain more SN ZnO in zeolite framework is very necessary.
β zeolites are BEA-type featuring three-dimensional structure with 12-ring channel systems, and have larger pores than those of ZSM-5 zeolites.23 The acidity of BEA-type β zeolites can be easily adjusted by eliminating lattice Al atoms from the framework.24,25,26,27,28 Moreover, the left vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups in β zeolites after dealumination could accommodate and anchor metal species,29,30,31 attributable to the reaction between metal species and silanol groups.32,33 It has been reported the exchanged Zn2+ ions or Zn(OH)+ species in Al-containing zeolites are active for catalyzing PDH.16,34,35 The issue of this kind of catalysts is that a large proportion of Zn species is prone to form macrocrystalline ZnO on the external zeolite surface, and thus SN ZnO with catalytic potential are hard to be obtained.16 Although the dealuminated β zeolite is free of framework Al atoms, the vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups can disperse and stabilize the introduced metal species.28,36,37 When the loading amount is low enough, metal heteroatoms can even be entirely incorporated into vacant T-atom sites to form mononuclear active sites.38,39 Therefore, it can be speculated that the dealuminated β zeolite as support might obtain highly-dispersed and small-sized ZnO species.
Herein, the SN ZnO catalysts supported on dealuminated β zeolite were prepared via two-step post-synthesis method involving dealumination and conventional impregnation procedures. It is revealed that the SN ZnO supported on dealuminated β exhibited high catalytic activity, selectivity and stability for PDH. The systematic characterizations and a comparison with raw Hβ support indicate the important role of SN ZnO located in the dealuminated β zeolite. Also, the function of silanol groups in dispersing and forming SN ZnO was clarified. Further, the reaction pathway of PDH over this catalyst was proposed.
Experimental Section
Catalyst Preparation
Hβ zeolite with SiO2/Al2O3 molar ratio of 60 was provided by Tianjin Shenneng Sci-Tech Co., Ltd. The Hβ zeolite was treated with concentrated nitric acid solution (13 mol L−1) at 100 °C for 10 h to get rid of the framework Al atoms, followed by washing with distilled water for several times, and then drying at 100 °C overnight. The obtained product was named as DeAlβ. Afterward, 1 g of DeAlβ zeolite was added into the zinc acetate solution with desired Zn content and stirred at room temperature for 12 h. The mixture was dried at 80 °C overnight, and subsequently calcined in air at 600 °C for 6 h with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The as-prepared samples were denoted as Znβ-x, where the x refers to the weight percent of Zn content (x=3, 7, 10, 20). For comparison purpose, ZnHβ with 10 wt% of Zn content, using the raw Hβ zeolite as support, was synthesized by the same method to that of Znβ-x catalysts.
Catalyst Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded on a Rigaku D/MAX-2500 (Mini FlexII) using Cu-Kα radiation. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEOL JSM-2800 microscope at 200kV. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were measured on a Bruker Tensor 37 with the technique of KBr pellet, and the spectrum range was from 4000 to 400 cm−1. Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra of samples were carried out a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrometer with 128 scans at a resolution of 2 cm−1. Diffuse reflectance UV-vis (DR UV-vis) spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV2450, and BaSO4 was used as an reference.
N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms were recorded on a Quantachrome NOVA 2000e sorption analyzer at 77 K, and all the samples were degassed at 200 °C over 7 h before the measurement. The ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) profiles were obtained from a Quantachrome CHEMBET-3000 analyzer, consisting of a U-shaped tubular micro-reactor which was placed inside an electrical furnace. Typically, 100 mg of the sample was pretreated with He at 600 °C for 1 h, then the sample was cooled to 80 °C. NH3 adsorption was performed by switching the He flow to NH3 gas and then keeping at 80 °C for 30 min. Afterward, the reactor having loaded sample was purged with He to remove the adsorbed NH3 from 80 to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed on a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al-Kα X-ray source (1486.6eV). The metal elements were detected using X-ray fluorescence (XRF, Rigaku Supermini). Solid-state magic angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were performed on a Bruker Advance III 400WB spectrometer at resonance frequencies of 104.3 MHz for 27Al and 79.5 MHz for 29Si NMR.
Catalytic Activity Testing
The catalytic tests of PDH over the as-prepared catalysts were performed in a quartz fixed-bed microreactor (inner diameter, 6 mm) at atmospheric pressure. 0.3 g of catalyst particles were hold in isothermal zone of the microreactor with two quartz wool plugs. A thermocouple fixed at the isothermal zone was used to measure the operation temperature. Then, the effluent products were transferred into an on-line gas chromatograph (SP-6800 A6), which was equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The following reaction conditions were settled in the catalytic test: reaction temperature, 600 °C; the total flow rate of gas reactant, 20 cm3 min−1 (5 vol% propane and a balance of nitrogen). The propane conversion (Cpropane), propylene selectivity (Spropylene), propylene yield (Ypropylene) and carbon balance were calculated as follows:
2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Preparation of SN ZnO Supported on Dealuminated β Zeolite
The XRD patterns of Hβ zeolite, DeAlβ, Znβ-10, ZnHβ-10 and standard ZnO are shown in Figure 1. For Hβ zeolite, the sharp diffraction peaks indicate the well-crystallized structure. Noticeably, the structure of Hβ zeolite remains unchanged after the dealumination and subsequent impregnation with zinc acetate solution, though unavoidably the crystallinity slightly reduces because of the elimination of framework Al atoms and the incorporation of Zn species. The position of the main diffraction peak at 2θ around 22.6°, corresponding to d302 spacing, has slightly shifted within different samples. The d302 value of the fabricated materials obtained from the corresponding 2θ value (Table 1), decreases from 3.9417 Å (Hβ, 2θ=22.54°) to 3.9346 Å (DeAlβ, 2θ=22.58°), indicating the contraction of BEA matrix after the dealumination procedure. Then, the d302 spacing increases to 3.9448 Å (Znβ-10, 2θ=22.52°), evidencing the expansion of the framework of DeAlβ zeolite caused by the incorporation of Zn species.30 With respect to Znβ catalysts with different Zn loading amounts (Figure S1), in addition to the diffraction peaks of β zeolite, three new peaks at 2θ=31.78°, 34.44° and 36.25° attributed to hexagonal phase ZnO (JCPD No. 35–1451) can be seen when the Zn loading is up to 20 wt%, which indicates the growth of Zn oxides with the increase of the Zn loading amount. The diffraction lines corresponding to hexagonal phase ZnO are not observed in Znβ-10, in contrast, which can be easily identified in ZnHβ-10 (Figure 1b). Although the Zn loading amount is identical (10 wt%), more macrocrystalline ZnO formed in ZnHβ-10 catalyst while more amorphous or well-dispersed ZnO species are present in Znβ-10 based on the corresponding XRD patterns.

[a] SBET is the specific BET surface area; [b] Vtotal is the total pore volume determined at P/P0 = 0.98.
The textural properties of β zeolite before and after dealumination, and Zn species introduction were studied by N2 sorption method (Figure S2 and Table 1). It is notable that Hβ, DeAlβ, Znβ-3, Znβ-7 and Znβ-10 have similar BET surface areas (445–480 m2/g) and total pore volumes (0.339–0.380 cm3/g), revealing the well preserved pore structure upon the two-step post-synthesis procedure. When the Zn loading is up to 20 %, the specific surface area and total pore volume are significantly reduced, ascribing to the formation of bulk ZnO which can block access to partial inner micropores.19,40
The 27Al MAS NMR spectroscopy was employed to verify the elimination of Al atoms after dealumination procedure. In Figure 2a, the characteristic peak at 54 ppm corresponding to tetrahedrally coordinated Al species progressively decreases, indicating almost all lattice Al atoms have been eliminated from the zeolite framework.41 In addition, no peak at 0 ppm related to extra framework octahedral Al can be observed, further suggesting the negligible content of Al atoms after dealumination. Accordingly, the generation of silanols occurs during the dealumination process.28,36 The 29Si MAS NMR spectra of the selected samples are shown in Figure 2b. The spectrum of raw Hβ zeolite shows the peaks centered at −103, −106 and −110 ppm, corresponding to the framework Si(OSi)3(OH), Si(OSi)3(OAl) and Si(OSi)4, respectively.42 Upon the dealumination, the peak at −103 ppm has no obvious change while the peak at −106 ppm almost disappears, further evidencing the removal of Al atoms from the framework. The introduction of Zn species into DeAlβ zeolite causes the weakening of the peak at −103 ppm, indicating the interaction between Zn species and SiOH in these Si(OSi)3(OH) species.25 The broad peak at −110 ppm in Hβ splits into two sharp peaks centered at −110 and −112 ppm in DeAlβ, ascribing to the generation of two types of surroundings of Si atoms in the framework Si(OSi)4 species.42 Then, the introduced Zn in DeAlβ can modify the silicon environment in Si(OSi)4, and thus, leading to the change of the two peaks at −110 and −112 ppm. The new emerging peak at −115 ppm in DeAlβ is another characteristic signal of Si(OSi)4 species at different crystallographic sites.36,43 The incorporation of Zn species doesn't influence its intensity, because that the Zn species cannot interact with this kind of Si(OSi)4 species due to the absence of hydroxyl.43 This result shows that the concentrated nitric acid can remove lattice Al from the zeolite framework, and the supported Zn species have interaction with the silanol groups in DeAlβ zeolite.

The structural properties of Hβ, DeAlβ, Znβ-10 and ZnHβ-10 catalysts were also characterized by IR. The FT-IR spectra of Hβ and DeAlβ samples exhibit the similar bands (Figure S3a), indicating the dealumination procedure did not disrupt the characteristic structure of zeolite. The existence of a mass of silanol groups in DeAlβ is proved by the characteristic band at 968 cm−1, as shown in Figure S3b, which is attributable to the stretching vibration of Si−O corresponding to uncoupled SiO4 tetrahedral with a hydroxyl group.39,44 The intensity of this band is very weak in Hβ, while it is more intense in DeAlβ, revealing the presence of T-atom sites associated with silanol groups which are generated upon the dealumination of Hβ zeolite.45 This band nearly disappears after the Zn species introduction, indicating the consumption of silanol groups which is caused by the reaction between Zn species and the hydroxyls of silanol groups. Further, Figure S4 displays the DRIFT spectra in the hydroxyl stretching vibration region of Hβ, DeAlβ and Znβ-10. The bare Hβ zeolite shows two characteristic bands at 3740 and 3600 cm−1, related with isolated terminal silanol (Si(OH)) and bridging hydroxyl groups (Si(OH)Al), respectively.46 After the dealumination procedure, the 3600 cm−1 band corresponding to Al species disappears due to the removal of framework Al atoms. Meanwhile, a new and broad band at 3460 cm−1 can be detected, indicating the formation of vacant T sites in the framework. This band is derived from the formation of silanol groups with hydrogen-bonded SiOH groups in vacant T sites. After loading with Zn species, the band at 3740 cm−1 becomes weak, indicating that Zn species bind to terminal oxygen atoms and even replace the silanol groups to some extent. Moreover, an intensive reduction of the 3460 cm−1 band is observed, revealing the Zn species are mainly boned to the silanol groups in vacant T sites.47
The acidic properties of β zeolite before and after acid treatment and the Zn incorporation were evaluated by the mean of NH3-TPD technique. As shown in Figure 3a, the raw Hβ zeolite shows two major NH3 desorption peaks centered at about 230 and 450 °C, revealing the existence of weak and strong acid sites, respectively.48 The NH3 desorption peaks disappear after the removal of framework Al atoms, indicating that both types of acid sites have been eliminated. After the introduction of Zn species, the broad peak appearing at the range of 200 to 450 °C can be ascribed to the generation of LAS, which is linked to the anchoring of Zn species to hydroxyls in zeolite framework.22,49,50 Compared with that of Znβ-10, the NH3 desorption peak intensity of ZnHβ-10 is much stronger, due to the remained strong acid sites. Concretely, a quantitative analysis on the LAS density of Znβ catalysts with different Zn loadings, can be determined from the NH3 desorption amounts calculated from the NH3-TPD curves in Figure 3b. The amounts of Lewis acid sites decrease as the order of Znβ-10 (0.032 mmolNH3/g) > Znβ-7 (0.023 mmolNH3/g) >Znβ-3 (0.016 mmolNH3/g) > Znβ-20 (0.015 mmolNH3/g), indicating that the most LAS can be obtained in Znβ-10 catalyst.

In order to identify the distributions of Zn species in Znβ-10 and ZnHβ-10 catalysts, TEM measurement was carried out. From the TEM images of ZnHβ-10 shown in Figure 4a-b, distinct ZnO nanoparticles can be easily observed in ZnHβ-10, and the size of the ZnO particles is up to tens of nanometers. As for Znβ-10, no ZnO particles can be seen in Figure 4c, while a small number of ZnO nanoparticles with uniform particle sizes smaller than 5 nm can be discerned in the high magnification image (Figure 4d). Although Zn species are dispersed well in both DeAlβ and Hβ supports, the surface ZnO particles in DeAlβ are obviously smaller than that in Hβ. As shown in Figure S5, the particle sizes of surface ZnO in Znβ-10 and ZnHβ-10 catalysts are mainly distributed in 2.9±1.5 and 7.3±4.0 nm, respectively. Although partial large ZnO particles are inevitably formed on the surface, it still can be used to demonstrate that the DeAlβ can favor the dispersion of Zn species. The low-resolution TEM image of Znβ-10 in Figure 4e exhibits the homogeneous contrast, indicating the uniform distribution of Zn species in Znβ-10. Besides, the homogeneous distribution of Si, O and Zn elements can be observed on the corresponding element mapping images (Figure 4f). Especially, the Zn image confirms the homogeneous dispersion of Zn species throughout the whole zeolite. Additionally, very weak Al signal can be observed in Figure 4f, indicating that most of Al species have be wiped off. Therefore, after acid treatment, β zeolite becomes a positive support for the dispersion and formation of SN ZnO.

The DR UV-vis spectroscopy is an effective method of distinguishing the chemical environment of Zn species on zeolite support. So, the DR UV-vis analysis was performed and the spectra are presented in Figure 5. The spectra of Hβ and pure ZnO were regarded as references. The absorption band of 368 nm corresponds to the band gap width of macrocrystalline ZnO is resulted from the charge transfer of ligand-to-metal from O2− to Zn2+.51,52 The broad and intense absorption band at 368 nm of pure ZnO validates it well. This band in ZnHβ-10 is much stronger compared with that in Znβ-10 (Figure 5a), suggesting the high content of macrocrystalline ZnO in ZnHβ-10. The bands at 195 nm can be assigned to the charge transfer transitions of Zn species with lattice O2− in zeolite framework, thus which are regarded as the distinguishing proof of Zn species in or bonded to the framework of zeolite.35,53 In contrast to ZnHβ-10, the intensity of band at 195 nm in Znβ-10 is much stronger, indicating that there are more ZnO clusters or Zn2+ bonding to the framework of DeAlβ zeolite.51 The DR UV-vis spectra of Znβ with different Zn loadings are also displayed in Figure 5b. With the increase of Zn loading amount, the band located at 368 nm becomes more intensive because crystalline ZnO are growing on the external surface. Although it has the weakest band of 368 nm in Znβ-3, the band at 195 nm corresponding to the incorporated Zn species shows much lower intensity than that of Znβ-10 due to the low Zn loading amount. When the Zn loading amount exceeds 10 wt%, the band of 195 nm becomes weaker again, attributable to more Zn species forming into bulk ZnO rather than bonded ZnO clusters. According to the intensity of band at 195 nm, it can be anticipated that there are much more bonded Zn species in the zeolite framework of Znβ-10 than that of Znβ-3, Znβ-7 and Znβ-20.

The XPS analysis was used to analyze the electronic states of Zn species in the selected samples, and the results are showed in Figure 6. The Zn 2p binding energies of 1021.6 and 1044.9 eV in Znβ-10 and ZnHβ-10 samples, are obviously higher than that of pure ZnO. Due to the lower electronegativity of Zn compared to Si atom, the introduced Zn species are more positively charged in Zn-O−Si bands than in Zn-O−Zn bands, leading to the chemical shift towards higher location.48,54 However, the Zn 2p spectra cannot differentiate the Zn2+ chemical environment within Znβ-10 and ZnHβ-10 samples. Fortunately, the existent states of the Zn species can be discerned by the Auger Zn LMM spectra, as shown in Figure 6b, which are more sensitive to the difference in the Zn chemical environment in comparison with the Zn 2p spectra. The difference of the kinetic energy peak locations can be attributed to the Zn2+ species in different electronic environment.55 Compared with that of ZnHβ-10, the lower kinetic energy of 985.6 eV of Znβ-10 catalyst suggests that there are more Zn species have interaction with lattice O atoms in zeolite framework.

2.2 Catalytic Performance
The duration of PDH test was fixed to 6 h since that the deactivation rate and tendency of propane conversions and propylene selectivities could be observed over all the samples. The calculated values of carbon balance are about 95 % for Znβ-10 catalyst, as shown in Figure S6, verifying the correctness of the analytical determinations examined for the test. The catalytic performance over all the prepared catalysts are given in Table 2. The catalytic performance of ZnHβ-10 is unsatisfactory with a low propane conversion less than 20 %, as shown in Figure 7a. In addition, the propylene selectivity of ZnHβ-10 is very low, only 7.6 % at the beginning of reaction, verifying the occurrence of severe side reactions. However, the Znβ-10 shows an initial propane conversion of about 53.3 % at 600 °C, which is much higher than that of ZnHβ-10. Noticeably, the propylene selectivity of Znβ-10 is up to 92.9 % at the beginning of reaction and stabilizes at around 97 % after 2.5 h on stream. The activity results obviously indicate that the dealumination treatment render β zeolite become a very positive support of Zn catalyst in PDH reaction.

The activity tests of PDH over Znβ catalysts with different Zn loading amounts were carried out, and the propane conversions and propylene selectivities achieved over these catalysts are presented in Figure 8. As discussed above, the Znβ catalysts show very high selectivity to propylene. The effect of Zn loading in Znβ catalysts on the propane conversion is significant, especially after the activity tests were performed at 600 °C for 6 h (Figure 8a). At the beginning of the reaction, with the increasing Zn loading on DeAlβ from 3 to 10 wt%, the propane conversion progressively increases from 37.9 % to 53.3 % and the propylene selectivity slightly decreases from 95.6 % to 92.9 %. However, it is difficult to determine the TOF parameters due to the high propane conversions. When the Zn loading is up to 20 %, the propane conversion has an evident reduction, ascribed to the formed bulk ZnO which is inactive and can cover active sites. Overall, the optimal Znβ-10 shows superior catalytic performance with the initial propane conversion as high as 53.3 % at a high propylene selectivity of 92.9 %. After 6 h on stream, the propane conversion reduces to 37.9 %, while the propylene selectivity keeps steady at about 97 %. Noticeably, such an ideal catalytic performance of Znβ catalyst in PDH is superior to that of a large majority of previously reported catalyst systems (Table S1).

In order to evaluate the reusability of this catalyst, the regeneration treatment of Znβ-10 catalyst after 6 h of reaction at 600 °C was performed, and the result is shown in Figure 9. The propylene yield on the fresh catalyst decreases from 51.2 % to 31.1 % after 6 h on stream. Then, the air was introduced at 600 °C for 2 h to remove carbon species deposited on the catalyst. The propylene yield decreases to 38.0 %, lower than that of the fresh catalyst, indicating the original activity of the catalyst could not be fully recovered. The recovery of catalytic activity after the first regeneration can be ascribed to the removal of formed coke, and the decrease of it is may be caused by the loss of some active sites. After the second regeneration procedure, the catalytic performance is almost restored. Anyway, as to what causes the trivial loss of activity during 6 h on stream, it still needs further investigation. Generally, the Znβ-10 catalyst possesses good reusability, indicating its great potential of application in commercial process of PDH.

2.3 Discussion
According to the Si/Al atom ratio (37.3) of raw Hβ zeolite determined by XRF (Table S2), the approaching saturation of framework Zn2+ in DeAlβ zeolite is supposed to be at Si/Zn ratio of around 37.3,34,56 thus excess Zn loadings must form ZnO clusters covering the framework Zn2+. If only the isolated Zn2+ are active sites, when the Si/Zn ratio is less than 37.3, the catalytic activity would decrease due to the formation of ZnO clusters. However, the decrease of Si/Zn ratio of 5.32 in Znβ-3 to 2.9 in Znβ-10 (Table S2) greatly improves the catalytic performance, suggesting the formed ZnO clusters are also catalytically active sites for PDH. Referencing to previous reports,8,15 a simple reaction mechanism is proposed and drawn in Scheme 1. It can be speculated that propane dissociative adsorption takes placing on the constrained SN ZnO surface.40 The isopropyl group and dissociated H atom are bonded to Zn2+ and the adjacent O atom, respectively. Then, propylene is formed through the β-H cleavage of the adsorbed isopropyl species. Finally, the active sites are recovered after the H2 molecular is released, and the reaction pathway is completed. Figure 10 illustrates the possible formation procedure of ZnHβ-10 and Znβ-10 catalysts. Directly loading Zn species on Hβ zeolite can cause a part of Zn species form bulk ZnO, which are inactive for PDH.16 Upon the dealumination procedure, almost all framework Al atoms of Hβ zeolite have been wiped off, and massive vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups are created. After loading with Zn species, ZnO particles can be well accommodated into vacant T-atom sites in the DeAlβ framework, and thus, producing into a large amount of SN ZnO with the catalytic capacity for PDH in Znβ catalyst.

So, the dealumination of Hβ zeolite makes a good condition for forming and anchoring SN ZnO. As shown in Figure 1a and Figure 2b, the Zn species are successfully incorporated into the DeAlβ zeolite framework. Moreover, the IR and 28Si MAS NMR results demonstrate that ZnO clusters are in or bonded the supercages of T-atom sites where there have been acidic sites, proving silanol groups really play an important role in obtaining SN ZnO. There are still a fraction of large ZnO particles can be observed on the DeAlβ surface (Figure 4), but the EDS mapping clearly demonstrates the Zn species in Znβ-10 are dispersed well throughout the whole support. Moreover, the TEM image of Znβ-3 catalyst shows no ZnO particles, as shown in Figure S7, indicating that the Zn is completely located in the zeolite framework when the Zn loading amount is low. The new emerging NH3 desorption peak in Znβ catalysts (Figure 3) confirms that the incorporated SN ZnO possess the character of LAS, which are active for catalyzing PDH. Further, the DR UV-vis and XPS results confirm that the highly dispersed SN ZnO bonded to the DeAlβ framework are derived from the interaction between Zn species and silanol groups. This work indicates that dealuminating β zeolite is an attractive method to generate silanol groups which can be employed to interact with Zn complex, and thus, a lot of active SN ZnO can be obtained in DeAlβ.
The catalytic performance of Zn supported on raw Hβ and DeAlβ supports are evaluated in PDH (Figure 7), and the influence of Zn loading amounts on the catalytic activity is exhibited in Figure 8. The optimal catalyst of Znβ-10 exhibits high propane conversion and great propylene selectivity compared with the ZnHβ-10 and other Znβ catalysts. The initial propane conversion of Znβ catalysts with different Zn loadings has perfect linear relationship to the corresponding NH3 desorption amounts (Figure S8), which is in consistence with the LAS density. Noticeably, the LAS are derived from the bonded SN ZnO, it thereby can be concluded that the catalytic activity of Znβ is dependent on the content of bonded SN ZnO. As for the Zn-containing Hβ, a small amount of bonded SN ZnO can be created, while most of Zn species exist on the zeolite surface in the form of macrocrystalline ZnO (Figure 1b). Excess Zn loading or using raw Hβ as support lead to weak catalytic performance ascribed to the formation of inactive bulk ZnO.16 Additionally, the dealuminated β zeolite is almost free of strong acid sites, effectively reducing side reactions. Thus, the propylene selectivity of Znβ-10 catalyst can be greatly enhanced. With massive active SN ZnO and free of strong acid sites, Zn supported on dealuminated β zeolite exhibits excellent catalytic performance in the propylene production. Moreover, the optimal Znβ-10 catalyst possesses great reusability (Figure 9), indicating its great potential in industrial application.
3 Conclusions
The dealuminated β zeolite, possessing a great deal of vacant T-atom sites associated with silanol groups, can be used as an ideal support for obtaining well-dispersed SN ZnO by the host-guest interaction. On the whole, the created vacant T-atom sites are in favor of constraining SN ZnO in the zeolite framework, and thus reducing the possibility of inactive bulk ZnO formed on the external surface of zeolite. The highly dispersed SN ZnO in or bonded to the zeolite framework as LAS are catalytically active sites in PDH. In addition, the absence of strong acid sites in the dealuminated β zeolite after removing Al atoms can reduce side reactions to a great extent. So the Zn catalyst supported on DeAlβ zeolite, with a large number of catalytically active SN ZnO and free of strong acid sites, showing high catalytic activity and excellent propylene selectivity in PDH. Strikingly, the catalytic capacity of SN ZnO on the dealuminated zeolite in PDH is the first time to be reported, and thus, opening a wide avenue for the design of Zn based dehydrogenation catalysts.
