Self-adaptive structure and catalytic performance of the Pt–Sn/Al2O3 propane dehydrogenation catalyst regenerated by dichloroethane oxychlorination†
Oxychlorination regeneration is an important and effective regeneration method for Pt based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. Cl2 and HCl are usually adopted as the chlorine source, which may jeopardize equipment and impair health seriously. A safer and less corrosive chlorine source, dichloroethane, is applied to oxychlorination regeneration of a series of Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts after oxidation treatment. The catalysts are characterized by H2-TPR, CO-DRIFTS, HAADF-STEM, XPS, and UV-vis DRS and their catalytic performances are also tested. It's found that the catalyst structures are self-adaptive for catalyzing the propane dehydrogenation reaction during the oxidation and oxychlorination treatment, in which Sn species combines with the alumina support in the ionic state and Pt is highly dispersed through an oxychloroplatinum complex. Pt migrates to sites having a stronger interaction with the support, leading to higher activity and selectivity. The performance of the regenerated catalyst is a function of oxychlorination conditions, indicating the possible influence of the coordination of chloride species with Pt on catalytic performance.
Introduction
The noble metal platinum is widely used for catalyzing the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction due to its excellent alkane C–H bond activation ability and lower C–C bond cleavage activation ability.1–3 Some PDH processes based on Pt catalysts, e.g., Oleflex, STAR etc., have been commercialized and achieved good economic benefits.4,5 However, Pt catalysts suffer from coking problems as the dehydrogenation reaction proceeds and need to be frequently regenerated. Some strategies have been proposed to increase the anti-coking ability and catalytic performance of Pt based catalysts, which include adding promoters,6–10 support modification or replacement10–14 and regulating the size of platinum.15–17 It seems that a large amount of research efforts is still needed to achieve thorough prohibition of coking on Pt based catalysts.
In a commercialized PDH process, Oleflex®, for instance, the cokes could be totally removed by high-temperature oxidation treatment. However, Pt particles may sinter in such an environment and cause deactivation of the catalyst.18–21 Then, the catalyst is further treated in a mixed atmosphere of Cl2 and O2 to re-disperse Pt and recover its catalytic performance.4,5
The use of halogen species to boost redispersion is commonplace and has been in existence for decades, in which chlorine is primarily used for redispersion.22–25 HCl has been extensively studied as the chlorine source by some researchers26–28 and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) has been proved as an effective dispersant of Pt as well.29 However, because of the strong toxicity of CCl4 and the corrosiveness of HCl, the application of these chlorides is restricted. Duan et al.30 employed XRD, HRTEM and XPS to elaborate the function of halogenated alkane C–X (X = Cl, Br, I) bonds to re-disperse Au particles. In some research, dichloropropane was used to study oxychlorination regeneration of Pt-Re/Al2O3 and Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts for catalytic reforming.31,32 In this work, low toxicity and corrosive dichloroethane containing rich C–Cl bonds was selected as the chlorine source for oxychlorination regeneration.
Sn is the most widely used and intensively studied promoter for supported Pt catalysts. In general, Sn improves the Pt catalyst selectivity to propylene and simultaneously reduces carbon deposits and extends the catalyst life. Notably, from the geometric point of view, the formation of a platinum–tin alloy and the partial covering of platinum particles by tin species result in the creation of smaller platinum ensembles.33 Another effect of Sn addition is the modification of the electronic properties of platinum.34 Though Pt–Sn/Al2O3 has been used in the Oleflex® process for decades, there are few studies on the role of Sn in the oxychlorination regeneration process of Pt–Sn catalysts. Arteaga et al.32 found that the presence of Sn reduced the formation of the oxychloroplatinum surface complex, PtIVOxCly, during the regeneration process and the diffusion of SnO2 on the support hindered the mobility of the complexes and the redispersion of Pt. Choi et al.28 found that hydrochloric acid treatment of the Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst (similar to oxychlorination) could promote the formation of a Pt3Sn alloy, which was beneficial to the propane dehydrogenation reaction.
This study aimed to examine the effect of tin addition on the oxychlorination regeneration of Pt–Sn/Al2O3. The performance and structure of Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts with different amounts of Sn were tested before and after oxychlorination regeneration. The existence and relative amount of the surface complex PtIVOxCly, a key species for redispersion, was also monitored. Based on these results, the effect of oxychlorination on the catalyst structure and performance and the underlying reasons are discussed.
Experimental
Catalyst preparation and treatment
The catalyst support Al2O3 was obtained by calcining pseudo-boehmite in an air atmosphere at 1100 °C for 4 h. The bimetallic catalyst Pt–Sn/Al2O3 was prepared by the co-impregnation method, in which H2PtCl6·6H2O (AR, Sinopharm) and SnCl4·5H2O (AR, Sinopharm) were used as the precursors of platinum and tin. After impregnation, the samples were aged overnight at room temperature, and dried for 8 h at 120 °C in an oven and then calcined in air at 500 °C for 3 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1. According to the method mentioned above, Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts with a Pt loading of 0.27% (wt%) and Sn loadings of 0%, 0.03%, 0.13% and 0.54% were prepared. The fresh catalysts were named Fresh-0Sn, Fresh-0.03Sn, Fresh-0.13Sn and Fresh-0.54Sn, respectively.
The catalyst sintering process (oxidation treatment) was conducted as follows: the sintering of the fresh catalyst was carried out in an air atmosphere for 4 h at a temperature of 600 °C, which is higher than the reaction temperature used in this study. The sintered catalysts were named as Sinter-0Sn, Sinter-0.10Sn, Sinter-0.13Sn, Sinter-0.54Sn, respectively.
The catalyst regeneration process (oxychlorination treatment) was conducted as follows: 0.1 g of the sintered catalyst was loaded in a reactor, and the temperature was elevated at 10 °C min−1 to the regeneration temperature, 500 °C. Then the mixture of oxygen (12 vol%) and argon was fed at a total flow of 80 mL min−1. At the same time, an advection pump was utilized to continuously add dichloroethane at a stable rate of 0.05 mL min−1. The samples after oxychlorination treatment were named Re-0Sn, Re-0.03Sn, Re-0.13Sn and Re-0.54Sn, respectively.
Catalyst test
The PDH reaction was performed in a fixed reactor (μBenchCat, Altamira Instruments, USA), which was equipped with a quartz tube with an inner diameter of 6 mm and heated by an electric furnace. Before the reaction, 0.1 g of the catalyst was loaded into the quartz tube and the catalyst was reduced in flowing hydrogen (20 mL min−1) at 550 °C for 100 min. Then, the temperature was raised to 575 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under an argon atmosphere. Afterward, the mixture of propane, hydrogen, and argon (the ratio of the volume flow of H2 to C3H8 was 0.55) was fed into the reactor, whose flow rate was 100 mL min−1, yielding a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of propane of 17.9 h−1. The effluent gas was analyzed with an online gas chromatograph with a TCD detector (Panna A91, China).
The conversion of propane and the selectivity for propene were calculated by following formulas (1) and (2), and the turnover frequency (TOF) was calculated using formulas (3):

Catalyst characterization
N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms were obtained using an ASAP2020 (Micromeritics, USA) to characterize the catalysts' properties such as the specific surface area, pore volume and pore size distribution. H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) and CO chemisorption experiments were all carried out using an AutoChem II 2920 analyzer (Micromeritics, USA). Diffuse reflectance UV-vis spectroscopy was conducted under atmospheric conditions using a Lambda 950 (Varian, USA) equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory to study the catalysts' surface layer species. The wavelength range varied from 200 to 600 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of all the samples were collected using a Bruker D8 Advance A25 diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5406 Å) operated at 40 kV and 30 mA. The data sets were acquired in step-scan mode over the 2θ range 10–80° and a scanning speed of 5–10° min−1. An ESCALAB 250Xi X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) (Thermo Scientific, USA) was used to characterize the valence state and binding energy of the Pt and Sn elements in the catalyst with monochromatic AlKα radiation at a power of 300 W, but before XPS characterization, the catalyst samples were pre-reduced in situ with H2. High-angle circular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were taken using a JEM-2100F scanning transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) operated at a 200 kV accelerating voltage, a 0.23 nm point resolution, a 0.14 nm line point resolution, a maximum magnification of 1.5 million times, and a ±35°(X)/±30°(Y) tilt angle. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken using an S4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, Japan) with an SE2 detector. The diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFT) study was carried out using a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FT-IR spectrometer (PerkinElmer, USA) equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled MCT detector. The DRIFT spectra were recorded at a temperature of 30 °C, a spectral resolution of 4 cm−1, an accumulation of 32 scans and a scanning range of 4000–400 cm−1. The catalyst powder (∼50 mg) was first reduced in flowing hydrogen (20 mL min−1) at 200 °C for 0.5 h and subsequently cooled down to 30 °C in argon at a flow rate of 20 mL min−1, followed by recording of the background spectrum. Then, the sample was exposed to CO (20 mL min−1) at 30 °C for 15–30 min to ensure the steady-state conditions and subsequently purged with argon at a flow rate of 20 mL min−1 until no more gas-phase CO was detected; then, this FT-IR spectrum was collected for analysis. Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) was performed to determine the amount of coke using a Pyris 1 instrument (PerkinElmer, USA) operated in air. The sample was dried at 120 °C for 30 min before the analysis, and then the temperature was increased to 800 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. The amount of Cl residing on the samples was determined using a Dionex Aquion RFIC ion chromatograph (Thermo Scientific, USA).
Results and discussion
Catalyst morphology and crystal phase
XRD patterns and SEM images of the Al2O3 support are shown in Fig. 1. As shown in Fig. 1a, the Al2O3 support prepared here exhibits diffraction peaks from two different crystal structures, i.e., α-Al2O3 at 25°, 35°, 43°, and 57° (PDF NO#46-1212) and θ-Al2O3 at 31°, 32°, 37°, 40° and 67° (PDF NO#35-0121). Therefore, the prepared Al2O3 support contains θ and α mixed crystal phases. From the SEM image (Fig. 1c), it can be seen that the morphology of the prepared alumina shows irregular blocks and spherical particles with different sizes. No apparent variations of the morphology can be observed on the catalysts after oxidation and oxychlorination treatment (images not shown here).

The catalyst with a Sn loading of 0.13 wt% was subjected to XRD characterization, and the spectra are shown in Fig. 1b. The diffraction peaks of platinum at 39°, 46° and 68° overlapped with the characterization peaks of alumina.35 There is no sign of diffraction peaks for the Sn metal, Sn oxides and complexes.36 It can be seen that all the catalysts have a broad diffraction peak at around 22°, which may belong to the amorphous substrate glass. Compared with the spectrum of the alumina support, the diffraction peaks of alumina in the catalyst are basically the same, which shows that the high-temperature oxidation and the oxychlorination treatment have a negligible effect on the crystal structure of alumina.
The nitrogen adsorption isotherms and pore size distributions of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 2 and the textural properties are listed in Table 1. The typical type IV isotherm with a hysteresis loop of type H3 can be observed in all the samples, which indicates that the pores are mesoporous and macroporous and the pore structure is very irregular.37 These pore structural properties were maintained after the oxidation and oxychlorination regeneration process. However, after oxychlorination, the BET surface area of the catalysts increased slightly and their average pore sizes decreased, suggesting that the fine pore structure was altered due to the dispersion of the catalyst surface species.

CO-chem was used to characterize the dispersion of Pt before and after catalyst regeneration. The results are listed in Table 1. The distributions of Pt particles were determined by HAADF-STEM and the images are shown in Fig. 3. The measured average particle sizes are shown in Table 1. Though the average particle sizes calculated from the electron microscopy images are slightly different, usually smaller, from those determined by CO-chem, the overall trend is basically the same. A possible explanation of this phenomenon is that part of the Pt surface is occupied by Sn, which causes the decrease of the CO adsorption amount.

From Fig. 3, it can be seen that Pt is highly dispersed on the support. For the prepared fresh catalyst with a low Sn loading, the distribution of Pt on the catalyst surface is relatively uniform. When the Sn content increases to 0.54 wt%, the small particles begin to agglomerate and grow into larger particles. After the oxidation treatment, the particles of the sintered catalyst are obviously larger and the particle distribution is narrower. From the CO-chem and STEM results, it can be found that the Pt particle size is significantly reduced after oxychlorination regeneration and very close to those of fresh catalysts, indicating the feasibility of oxychlorination to disperse large Pt particles.
UV-vis DRS results
The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of oxychlorination treated Pt catalysts with different Sn contents are shown in Fig. 4. A very broad peak centered at around 340 nm can be found for Re-0Sn and Re-0.03Sn. This peak can be attributed to PtIVOxCly existing on the surface of the catalyst formed after the dichloroethane oxychlorination treatment. Lietz et al.38 reported that four bands in the UV-vis spectra can distinguish PtIVOxCly species, which were the band at 285 nm induced by charge transfer transitions involving Pt and bands at 335, 375, and 475 nm indicating d–d transitions. Passos et al.39 and Mozer et al.40 also reported that the Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited similar spectra with a band at 340 nm associated with PtIVOxCly. The prominent peak at 340 nm diminishes in samples with a higher Sn content, Re-0.13Sn and Re-0.54Sn, which indicates that the existence of Sn is not conducive to PtIVOxCly generation in the oxychlorination process, which may hinder the Pt redispersion. This is a possible explanation for the change of the Pt particle size determined from the HAADF-STEM images. Arteaga et al.32,41 illustrated that ionic Sn hindered both catalyst sintering during oxidation and redispersion during oxychlorination, which is consistent with our experimental results. Although the formation of PtIVOxCly was reduced when Sn was added to the samples, the existence of Sn itself is also beneficial for the dispersion of Pt;42,43 as can be seen from Table 1 the Fresh-0.03Sn and Fresh-0.13Sn samples have a smaller Pt size than that of Fresh-0Sn. It is well known that the mobility of Sn is higher under high temperature and it would be easy to disperse Sn on the support surface,42,44 which is helpful for anchoring Pt during the oxychlorination process.

H2-TPR results
The H2-TPR results are shown in Fig. 5. In general, a low-temperature peak (∼210 °C) and a high-temperature peak (360–400 °C) are found on the fresh series samples, which corresponds to reduction of Pt oxides with a strong metal–support interaction and the reduction of the oxychloroplatinum complex PtIVOxCly, which is reported to have a strong interaction with alumina.45–48 There is no reduction peak for the Sn component in the fresh Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst (usually at 450 °C and 680 °C),17 which manifests that the Sn species interact strongly with the carrier and are difficult to reduce.
Fig. 5 H2-TPR spectra of catalysts with different Sn loadings. (a) Catalysts of 0 Sn, (b) catalysts of 0.03 Sn, (c) catalysts of 0.13 Sn, (d) catalysts of 0.54 Sn.
Among the sintered catalysts, except for Sinter-0.13Sn, no other catalyst showed obvious reduction peaks, besides a weak broad peak between 400 and 500 °C. The disappearance of reduction peaks at low temperature indicates that the Pt species migrate to anchoring sites with a stronger interaction with the carrier and are hard to reduce.
The catalyst after oxychlorination regeneration shows a reduction peak at 400–435 °C, which is tentatively ascribed to the reduction of PtIVOxCly. With the increase of Sn content, the reduction peak first shifted to a high temperature (414 °C → 435 °C) and then to a low temperature direction (435 °C → 423 °C). The shift of the latter case indicates a weaker interaction with alumina in the Re-0.54Sn sample. Therefore, although the addition of Sn hinders the formation of PtIVOxCly, an appropriate amount of Sn can enhance the interaction between PtIVOxCly and alumina. After the sintering–regeneration process, the desorption peak of hydrogen on metallic Pt disappeared, and the peak temperatures found for the four samples are higher than those for the corresponding fresh and sintered catalysts, attesting that the loading sites of the Pt species migrated and finally anchored to stronger interaction sites. This change in the load position is beneficial to improving the catalytic performance and stability.
CO-DRIFTS results
CO-DRIFTS was carried out to characterize the structure change before and after regeneration of the catalyst and the results are shown in Fig. 6. For Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, the low frequency band at 1750–1900 cm−1 is ascribed to the bridge adsorption of CO on the surface of Pt and the high frequency band at 2030–2100 cm−1 is ascribed to the linear adsorption of CO on the surface of Pt.48–51 For the Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst, the characteristic peak at 2070 cm−1 is the result of the superposition of CO on the bimetallic catalyst Pt adsorption center and Sn adsorption center.
Fig. 6 CO-DRIFTS spectra of catalysts with different Sn loadings.
All the catalysts exhibit obvious infrared adsorption peaks at 2050–2100 cm−1. The peak intensity of the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst without Sn is significantly stronger than that of Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts. In particular, for the fresh Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, there are 4 characteristic peaks at 2045 cm−1, 2071 cm−1, 2091 cm−1 and 1833 cm−1, where the characteristic peaks at 2071 cm−1 and 2091 cm−1 correspond to the linear adsorption on the platform positions of Pt metal particles; the characteristic peak at 2045 cm−1 corresponds to the linear adsorption on corner and step positions of Pt metal particles,52 while the characteristic peak at 1833 cm−1 corresponds to the bridging adsorption of CO. With the increase of Sn content, the intensity of the bridge adsorption peak gradually weakened, revealing that the addition of Sn to the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst can eliminate bridging adsorption and reduce the accumulation of Pt. The peak height and peak area of the superimposed peak at 2070 cm−1 also gradually decrease with the increase of the Sn content, demonstrating that the addition of an appropriate amount of Sn has a “dilution” effect on the agglomeration of Pt atoms, and it does show a significant geometric effect.
XPS results
XPS was carried out to characterize the changes in the valence states of Pt and Sn before and after catalyst regeneration and the results are shown in Fig. 7 and 8. Since the characteristic peaks of Pt 4f and Al 2p have an overlapping range,15,53 the peak of Pt 4d is selected to determine the valence state of Pt on Al2O3. The spectra of all of the samples could be resolved into three peaks with binding energies (B.E.) of 316.8–318.5, 314.6–315.6, and 311.5–313.0 eV, which could be assigned to the presence of Pt4+, Pt2+, and Pt0 species, respectively.54 The curve-fitting results are shown in Table S1.† It can be seen that the Pt species of all the catalysts exist on the surface in both metallic and oxidized forms. In fresh catalysts, with the increase of the Sn content, the proportion of species in oxidation states Pt4+ and Pt2+ decreases, indicating that Sn can alloy with Pt and keeps Pt in zero valence. After sintering, the proportion of metallic Pt0 species increases with the increase of Sn, but when the Sn content is 0.54%, the proportion decreases instead, demonstrating that high temperature sintering separates the metal components of Pt and Sn. After oxychlorination regeneration, the proportion of metallic Pt0 species is significantly reduced, signifying that the oxychlorination process destroys the alloy, resulting in highly dispersed single metal particles. In addition, compared with the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, the binding energy distribution of the Pt regeneration catalysts is more concentrated, especially for the Pt4+ species, whose binding energy gradually shifts to the negative direction with the increase of the Sn content. The increase of Sn will reduce the valence of Pt in the regeneration process and hinder the Pt charge transfer and thereby may hinder the occurrence of redispersion. The higher the Sn content, the stronger the hindering effect. At the same time, the Sn 3d5/2 orbital was subjected to peak separation processing to study the valence state and composition change, and the results are shown in Fig. 8. It is generally believed that53–56 the characteristic peaks of the binding energy of oxidation states Sn4+ and Sn2+ appear at 486.5–488.5 eV and 495.0–496.5 eV, and the characteristic peaks of the binding energy of Sn0 or the Sn–Pt alloy appear at 485.5 eV and 494.5 eV. For the fresh catalyst, when the amount of Sn is low, it mainly exists in the form of the oxidized state, while the Sn0 species appears when the Sn loading is 0.54%. Combined with the results in Fig. 7, this shows that the Pt–Sn alloy does appear leading for a catalyst activity decrease. For the sintered catalyst, the Sn0 species appeared in the catalyst with a Sn content of 0.13%, while the Sn0 component in the catalyst with a Sn content of 0.54% was significantly reduced, which may be due to the reorganization of the bimetal during the sintering process, and the Sn in the Pt–Sn alloy phase is segregated. The characteristic peak positions of the two catalysts with Sn contents of 0.13% and 0.54% showed negative migration, the Sn0 phase disappeared, and the characteristic peak intensity was also enhanced, demonstrating the reduction of Sn0 after regeneration. For the regeneration catalyst, the binding energy position of SnOx in the catalyst migrates to the high energy direction with the promotion of the Sn content, manifesting the increase of SnOx components, but too much SnOx covering the support will hinder the migration of Pt.41,57 In the oxychlorination regeneration process, the loading sites of the Sn species also migrate, the Sn species are more uniformly dispersed in alumina and the formation of the Pt–Sn alloy is reduced.

Catalytic performance
The results of the catalytic performances of the fresh catalysts and those after oxidation and oxychlorination treatment are shown in Fig. 9. It's well known that the propene selectivity of PDH over supported Pt catalysts is strongly size dependent. Zhang et al.15 found that the selectivity to propene and can only reach >90% when Pt is atomically dispersed. For the fresh catalysts, it's found that all the samples have fairly high propene selectivity, indicating that Pt is well dispersed. The Fresh-0Sn catalyst shows the lowest propene selectivity, which should be attributed to the existence of multiple Pt–Pt sites, as shown in the CO-DRIFTS characterization results. These sites are thought to be the active sites for side reactions, e.g. cracking, deep dehydrogenation etc.1,58,59 With the addition of Sn to the sample, the selectivities of Fresh-0.03Sn, Fresh-0.13Sn and Fresh-0.54Sn increase due to the geometric and electronic effects of Sn.60–63
Fig. 9 Performances of catalysts with different Sn loadings before and after regeneration; reaction conditions: Wcat = 0.1 g, T = 848 K, WHSVC3H8 = 17.9 h−1 and C3H8/H2/Ar = 11 : 6 : 33.
After oxidation treatment, the conversion decreased while the selectivities of Sinter-0Sn, Sinter-0.03Sn and Sinter-0.13Sn increased. Although the conversion decreased, the calculated TOF for propane conversion (shown in Table 1) on these catalysts actually increased. During the oxidation treatment, surface chlorine species and hydroxyl groups are partly removed from the support surface and the sites for anchoring Pt and/or Sn species also change28 and, therefore, the structural properties and catalytic performance change as well. From the characterization results stated above, it's found that the multiple Pt–Pt sites and the Pt species with a weak interaction with the carrier diminish due to the mobility of the Pt and/or Sn species. It turns out that the evolvement of the structure during oxidation treatment is beneficial for the enhancement of the catalytic performance. The propane conversion over the Sinter-0.54Sn catalyst is exceptional for the sintered catalysts, increasing to 25.1% initial propane conversion, which might be attributed to the segregation of Sn in the alloy phase during the oxidation treatment and the exposure of more Pt active sites as shown in the CO chemi-sorption results. The beneficial effect of Sn on the catalytic performance can also be ascertained by the increase of the selectivity, not only because Pt is highly dispersed with the help of Sn, but also the existence of Sn could weaken the adsorption strength of propene and reduce the deep dehydrogenation and cracking of propene.
For the regenerated catalyst, the propane conversion and propene selectivity of all the four catalysts increased and exceeded those of the fresh- and sinter-serial catalysts, indicating that the structural properties of these Pt based catalysts are suitable for catalyzing the PDH reaction after oxychlorination treatment. During the treatment, the Pt and Sn species are well re-dispersed (refer to Fig. 3 and Table 1) and have stronger interactions with the support as shown in the TPR results. It seems that the structures of these catalysts have self-adaptability for recovering the catalytic performances. During the treatment, metal species are mobile on the carrier surface until they are captured by anchoring sites with stronger interactions, which provides a suitable coordination environment of Pt for catalyzing PDH. It should be mentioned that the catalytic performance of the catalyst will reach a stable value after about 3 times oxychlorination treatment, indicating that an equilibrium particle size distribution may be obtained (refer to ESI† Fig. S2).
However, it should be noticed that such self-adaptability is valid within a certain range of treatment conditions. Our research results (not shown here) suggest that this reversibility could be maintained as long as the oxidation temperature is not higher than about 600 °C, under which the support structure might be destroyed. Le Normand et al.27 studied the redispersion of sintered 0.6–1.0 wt% Pt/Al2O3 catalysts under HCl/H2O/O2/N2 atmospheres and the EXAFS results suggest that Pt atoms can be present on the support either in the form of small rafts containing Cl and O atoms or in relatively large metallic particles covered by Pt(OH)4Cl2 species. The oxidation of supported Pt-based catalysts under harsh conditions will generate a bimodal distribution of Pt particle sizes and more Pt particles with larger sizes exist when the interaction between Pt and support decreases.64,65 When a large amount of these Pt particles formed, the active metals on the catalyst surface could hardly be fully re-dispersed.65
The existence of an apparent activity difference between the fresh and regenerated catalysts can be seen from Fig. 9, though these two series of samples have similar surface structures and electronic properties as verified from XPS and CO-DRIFTS characterization results. The amount of Cl on different samples are all around 1.0–1.1 wt% (refer to Table S2†).Therefore, the activity difference should originate from the different local coordination environment of Pt. Zhang et al.66 found that with the increase of time for dechlorinating a PtSnNa/catalyst, the interactions between Pt and Sn species on the catalyst surface changed remarkably, leading to the loss of catalytic activity, which indicates that introduction of an optimal amount of chlorine species by oxychlorination treatment is needed to keep the most suitable structure for catalyzing PDH.67
To verify this deduction, the one variable at a time method was used to explore the effect of regeneration temperature, oxygen concentration and dichloroethane flow rate on the initial catalytic performance of Re-0.13Sn. The results are shown in Fig. 10. It can be seen that the initial propane conversion over the Re-0.13Sn sample is a function of the regeneration conditions. The highest propane conversion, 35.3%, is obtained when the sintered catalyst is generated under the following conditions: temperature 475 °C, oxygen concentration 12 vol%, and EDC flow rate 0.03 mL min−1. These conditions are different from those for oxychlorination of a commercial catalyst,52 indicating that the local coordination environment of Pt and the catalytic performance are influenced by not only the catalyst composition but also the regeneration conditions.
Fig. 10 Initial propane conversion on catalysts regenerated under different conditions (based on oxygen concentration: 12%, EDC feed rate: 127 μmol min−1, oxychlorination time: 40 minutes, temperature: 500 °C).
The amount of deposited coke on the catalyst was quantitatively determined by TG (the TG spectra are shown in ESI† Fig. S2). The coking amounts on the Fresh-0Sn, Fresh-0.03Sn, Fresh-0.13Sn and Fresh-0.54Sn catalysts are 1.35 wt%, 1.28 wt%, 1.25 wt% and 0.70 wt%, respectively, and becomes 1.45 wt%, 1.28 wt%, 1.09 wt% and 0.75 wt% on Re-0Sn, Re-0.03Sn, Re-0.13Sn and Re-0.54Sn, respectively. The selectivity to coke, defined by the coke amount divided by the total amount of propane converted, decreases, which is consistent with the increase of propene selectivity.
Conclusions
In this work, the regeneration of Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalysts with different Pt/Sn ratios by EDC oxychlorination reaction was investigated. The structural characterization results and catalytic performance confirmed that EDC oxychlorination treatment is effective for Pt particle re-dispersion and Pt–Sn/Al2O3 catalyst regeneration. During the oxychlorination treatment process, Pt and Sn are mobile on the carrier surface and self-adaptively form the final catalyst structure, in which the Sn species combines with the alumina carrier in the ionic state and Pt is highly dispersed through an oxychloroplatinum complex. When the loading of Sn is low, the Sn species may hinder the spreading of Pt complexes over the alumina surface. The performance of the regenerated catalyst is a function of the oxychlorination conditions and coordination of Cl with Pt should be considered, except for the carrier surface properties and catalyst compositions, for achieving the optimal structure for catalyzing PDH.
