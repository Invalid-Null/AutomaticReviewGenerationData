 Unfortunately, based on the multiple extractions provided, the document does not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation catalysts. All extractions indicate the document focuses on investigating faujasite zeolite catalysts for paraffin cracking reactions using propane, rather than optimizing propane dehydrogenation specifically. Since no details are provided about propylene yields, propane conversion to propylene, or the presence of oxidizing agents, I cannot extract meaningful data about PDH or ODH catalyst advancements. The unified XML output is:
