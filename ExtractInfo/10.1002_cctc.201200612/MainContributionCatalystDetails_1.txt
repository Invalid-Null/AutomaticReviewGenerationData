 Based on the supplied document, this does not appear to be related to propane dehydrogenation. The document focuses on investigating the influence of extraframework aluminum species on the acidity and catalytic activity of faujasite zeolites towards paraffin cracking, specifically using propane as a probe molecule. While propane conversion is examined, the emphasis is on cracking rather than dehydrogenation. No oxidizing agent appears to be present in the feed.
