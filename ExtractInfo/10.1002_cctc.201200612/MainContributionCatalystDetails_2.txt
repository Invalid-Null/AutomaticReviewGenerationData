 Based on the details provided in the document, this does not appear to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses the catalytic cracking of propane over faujasite zeolite catalysts, but does not specifically focus on dehydrogenation to produce propylene. No propylene yields or propane dehydrogenation rates are reported. Therefore, I have no specific information to extract about a propane dehydrogenation catalyst.
