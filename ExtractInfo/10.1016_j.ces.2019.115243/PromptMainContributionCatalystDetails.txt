Highlights
•
Propane pyrolysis was accelerated by the presence of phenyl radicals.
•
Increased propylene yields were resulted from increased concentration of isopropyl radicals.
•
Decreased propylene selectivity was found in favor of methane and ethylene.
•
Increased methane and ethylene selectivity was due to accelerated secondary reactions converting propylene.
Abstract
Phenyl radicals generated from nitrobenzene were introduced as hydrogen abstraction agents to accelerate propylene formation from propane pyrolysis. Neat propane pyrolysis and propane pyrolysis facilitated by phenyl radicals were carried out between 550 °C and 650 °C. Our experiments showed that phenyl facilitated pyrolysis gave higher propane conversion over neat reactions, with yields of all main products increased. However, propylene selectivity in phenyl facilitated pyrolysis decreased in favor of methane and ethylene. Results from detailed kinetic modeling showed that the formation of normal propyl and isopropyl radicals was accelerated due to increased hydrogen abstraction of propane by phenyl radicals. Decreased propylene selectivity in phenyl facilitated pyrolysis was resulted from the increased rates of secondary reactions converting propylene into ethylene and methane. Our work demonstrates that a suitable free radical could facilitate propane pyrolysis for higher propylene yields. However, the balance between propylene yields and selectivity remains a major challenge.
1. Introduction
Access to new supply of light alkanes (methane, ethane, propane, and butane) from shale deposits is one of the most exciting developments in the United States during the past decade (Kerr, 2010, Stevens, 2012, Wang et al., 2014). The relative abundance and low price of shale-derived alkanes gives the U.S. manufacturers a decisive competitive edge over other countries for petrochemical production (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2016). This shale evolution also initiates a shift of ethylene production from oil-based naphtha to shale-derived ethane (Sattler et al., 2014b). The fact that ethane-based steam cracking reactors are more inexpensive to build and more efficient to operate than their naphtha-based counterparts also accelerates this shift. Ethane cracking, however, produces very little propylene. Typical propylene to ethylene production ratio in mass from ethane cracking is 0.02, as opposed to 0.5 from traditional naphtha cracking (Wittcoff et al., 2004). Consequently, the shift from oil-derived naphtha to shale-derived ethane for ethylene production results in a growing gap of propylene demand.
Several on-purpose propylene (OPP) technologies have been developed to overcome this challenge (Bruijnincx and Weckhuysen, 2013). The most common OPP technology is propane dehydrogenation (PDH), in which propane is catalytically dehydrogenated to produce propylene and hydrogen (Nawaz, 2015). The major research effort on PDH has focused on finding an optimal catalyst to increase propylene yields, propylene selectivity, and catalyst lifetime (Deng et al., 2014, Sattler et al., 2014a, Schweitzer et al., 2014, Zhang et al., 2014). Two families of catalysts have shown the best promise: (1) supported platinum catalysts (Lee et al., 2014, Sattler et al., 2014b), and (2) chromium oxide catalysts (Jibril, 2004, Mentasty et al., 1999). UOP’s Oleflex process (Bhasin et al., 2001) and CB&I Lummus’s Catofin process (Craig and Spence, 1986) have been developed and commercialized based on these two catalyst families. New catalyst formulations such as vanadium oxides (Eon et al., 1994, Khodakov et al., 1998), gallium oxides (Michorczyk and Ogonowski, 2003), and carbon-based catalysts (Qi and Su, 2014) have been continuously explored to achieve better performance. Despite significant progress in catalytic PDH, a number of limitations exist, including catalyst deactivation, high cost, particularly on Pt, and environmental concerns associated with the use of heavy metals.
Recently, an experimental and kinetic modeling study on n-butane and i-butane pyrolysis at various pressures has shown that the branched structure of i-butane leads to a high propylene selectivity during pyrolysis (Li et al., 2018). However, only trace amount of butanes is available in shale deposits while propane can be obtained at around 1–2 mol% (Sattler et al., 2014b). Propane pyrolysis without any catalysts could be a simple approach to decompose propane for propylene production. However, high temperature (>700 °C) is required to break the strong C–H and C–C bonds (410 and 370 kJ/mol, respectively) (Hidaka et al., 1989, Layokun and Slater, 1979, Zou and Zou, 1986), leading to significantly low propane conversion without the use of catalysts. In addition, the lower dissociation energy of the C–C bonds than that of the C–H bonds results in low propylene selectivity from propane pyrolysis than that from catalytic propane dehydrogenation. One possible approach to improve propylene yields from propane pyrolysis is to accelerate the cleavage of the C–H bonds. This could be achieved using catalysts or by providing additional free radicals as hydrogen abstraction agents so that the formation of propyl radicals, the precursors leading to propylene, is more favorable. It is well known in combustion chemistry that hydroxyl radicals can abstract hydrogen from alkanes to accelerate the formation of alkenes (Tuazon et al., 2003, Tully et al., 1986, Droege and Tully, 1986, Altarawneh et al., 2011). In atmospheric chemistry, alkoxy radicals are also known to abstract hydrogen atoms from alkanes to produce alkenes (Zhao et al., 2003, Francisco et al., 2002, Griller and Ingold, 1974, Paul et al., 1978). However, these radicals are also very reactive towards the produced alkenes, eventually oxidizing them into carbon dioxide. As a result, the yields of alkenes in these reaction systems are typically low.
The ideal candidate radicals for accelerating propane conversion into propylene should be more reactive in abstracting hydrogen atoms from propane than from propylene. In this work, phenyl radicals generated from nitrobenzene were examined as hydrogen abstraction agents in propane pyrolysis to accelerate the formation of propylene. Nitrobenzene was chosen to generate phenyl radicals because of its low C–N bond energy (295.8 kJ/mol), compared to higher C–H bond energy (472.2 kJ/mol) of benzene, C–CH3 bond energy (426.8 kJ/mol) of toluene, and C–O bond energy (463.6 kJ/mol) of phenol (Luo and Kerr, 2012). A plug flow reactor operated at a temperature range between 550 and 650 °C was used for this reaction. The effect of nitrobenzene partial pressure and reaction temperature on propane pyrolysis was investigated. A detailed kinetic model was also used for the interpretation of the experimental results. The results obtained from this exploratory work could lead to future applications of any easily generated free radicals in hydrocarbon pyrolysis for the enhancement of conversion and the manipulation of product yields.
2. Experimental methods
2.1. Pyrolysis reaction
Propane pyrolysis experiments were carried out in a continuous plug flow reactor between 550 °C and 650 °C at atmospheric pressure. The reactor consists of a quartz tube with a length of 11 in., an outer diameter of 0.5 in., and an inner diameter of 0.375 in. The quartz tube was placed in a furnace with a heating zone of 9.0 in. in length. A type-K thermocouple (OMEGA, KMQSS-062U-12) was positioned in the middle of the reactor to monitor the reaction temperature. Propane (Airgas, 99%) was introduced through a gas line with a length of 13 in. at a flow rate between 0 and 35 mL/min. Nitrogen (Airgas, 99.998%) was used as a balance and carrier gas so that the total flow rate stayed constant at 53.5 mL/min. The propane and nitrogen flow rates were controlled by flow meters (Porter VCD-1000). Nitrobenzene (Acros Organics, 99%) was delivered by a syringe pump (KD Scientific) through a liquid line with a flow rate between 9.25 and 37.5 µL/min. Both gas and liquid lines were heated by heating tapes (McMaster-Carr, 4550T133) at a constant temperature of 250 °C. Propane and nitrobenzene vapors were mixed before being fed into the reactor. The products of every 15 min interval were collected in two ice–salt traps at –30 °C downstream of the reactor and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC). The average values of 4 time-on-stream data (i.e., over a period of 1 h) were reported in the figures, and the standard deviation of the 4 runs was used as error bars.
2.2. Products identification and quantification
Identification of the reaction products was achieved using a Shimadzu GC2010 Plus GC equipped with a mass spectrometer (MS). The samples were injected into the GC/MS system equipped with a Shimadzu SH-RXi-5Sil MS column (30 m). High purity helium (99.999%, Airgas) was used as a carrier gas in the column with a constant flow rate of 88.8 mL/min. The inlet temperature of the GC was set at 285 °C. The programmed temperature regime for the GC oven was: start at 35 °C, hold for 7 min, ramp up to 185 °C at 7.5 °C /min, and ramp up to 285 °C at 20 °C/min. The temperature of the MS detector was set at 285 °C.
Quantification of the reaction products was achieved using a Shimadzu GC2010 Plus GC with a flame ionization detector (FID). The samples were injected into the GC/FID system equipped with a Shimadzu Rxi-5ms column (15 m). The GC was programmed with the following inlet operating parameters: high purity helium carrier gas set at a constant flow pressure of 22.1 kPa, inlet temperature set at 285 °C, and split injection mode with split ratio of 150. The detector temperature was set at 285 °C, with an air flow rate of 400 mL/min, a hydrogen gas flow rate of 40 mL/min, and a makeup gas flow rate of 30 mL/min. The GC oven was programmed with the following temperature regime: start at 35 °C, hold for 7 min, ramp up to 87.5 °C at 7.5 °C/min and hold for 2 min, ramp to 185 °C at 7.5 °C/min, and ramp to 285 °C at 20 °C/min. To determine the flow rates of NO and NO2 in the product stream, atomic balances of nitrogen and oxygen were performed assuming that the loss of nitrobenzene mass in the product stream solely consisted of nitrobenzene–derived products detected by FID and undetectable NO and NO2. Since two atomic balance equations (one for nitrogen and one for oxygen) could be set up for each experiment, the two unknown quantities (i.e., NO and NO2 flow rates in the product stream, respectively) could be readily solved.
Yields and selectivity of propane–derived products are calculated on per carbon basis as:
(1)
(2)
where ni and Fi are number of the carbon atoms and molar flow rate of the propane–derived product i in the product stream, respectively. Similarly, yields of nitrobenzene–derived product j are calculated on per mass basis as:
(3)
where mj is the mass flow rate of nitrobenzene–derived product j and mnitrobenzene is the mass flow rate of unreacted nitrobenzene in the product stream.
2.3. Kinetic modeling
To elucidate the reaction pathways in detail, kinetic modeling of the reaction system was performed. The Lawrence Livemore n-heptane combustion mechanism (Curran et al., 1998), which contains 654 species and 2827 reactions, was used to describe the pyrolysis of the light hydrocarbons. For reactions related to nitrobenzene, 4 reactions involving 5 additional species were added, as tabulated in Table 1. Specifically, Reaction (1) describes the cleavage of C–N bonds of nitrobenzene to form phenyl and NO2 radicals. The frequency factor (A) and activation energy (Ea) of the reaction were obtained from Gonzalez et al. (1985). Reactions (2), (3) depict hydrogen abstraction from propane by phenyl radicals to form normal propyl radicals (n-C3H7) and isopropyl radicals (i-C3H7), respectively. The activation energies of the reactions were set based on Park et al. (2004). Representative frequency factor for hydrogen abstraction reactions was set following the recommendation by Kruse et al. (2001). Reaction 4 describes decomposition of NO2 radicals to form NO, with parameters obtained from the GRI-Mech 3.0 methane combustion mechanism with NOx chemistry (Smith et al., 1999). Note that the parameters used in the kinetic model were entirely obtained or estimated from the literature without fitting the experiment data. The final reaction mechanism used for the simulations in this work consists of 659 species and 2831 reactions, which is provided in the Appendix along with the thermodynamic data of the species.

Plug Flow Reactor Module in ANSYS Chemkin 17.0 was used to simulate our experimental setup. This module is suitable for modeling the gas flow in the quartz reactor, since the flow in the quartz reactor is laminar, with a very small Reynolds number of ~1.22. Consequently, the hydrodynamic entry length is estimated to be 0.023 in. and the thermal entry length is estimated to be 0.016 in, both of which are much smaller than the length of the heated zone (9 in.) of the quartz reactor. Since our experiments were conducted at a constant temperature, the simulations assumed that the whole process was isothermal instead of adiabatic and the endothermic effects of propane pyrolysis were assumed to be unimportant.
3. Results and discussion
Fig. 1 depicts the effect of reaction temperature on product distributions for neat and phenyl facilitated propane pyrolysis. At 550 °C, the conversion of neat propane pyrolysis reached only approximately 3% (Fig. 1A). When the reaction temperature increased to 600 and 650 °C, the conversion increased to approximately 5% and 15%, respectively. Propylene had the highest selectivity at approximately 45% regardless the temperature examined (Fig. 1B). When propane pyrolysis was facilitated by phenyl radials, the conversion of propane was significantly higher, reaching approximately 15% at 550 °C, 25% at 600 °C, and 35% at 650 °C, respectively. Methane, ethylene, and propylene were found as the major products and their yields all increased in the presence of nitrobenzene compared to neat pyrolysis. The selectivity of propylene in phenyl radical facilitated pyrolysis, however, decreased from approximately 50% to approximately 30% at 550 °C in favor of methane and ethylene. The same decrease in propylene selectivity in favor of methane and ethylene was also observed at 600 and 650 °C.

Fig. 2 compares rate constants of the three propane pyrolysis initialization reactions. Reaction A is the cleavage of propane C–C bonds to produce C2H5 and CH3 radicals. Reactions B and C are the cleavage of C–H bonds to produce n-C3H7 and i-C3H7 radicals, respectively (along with H radicals). The rate constants (k) of all three reactions increased with increasing temperature, consistent with the temperature effect on propane conversion shown in Fig. 1. The rate constant of C–C bond cleavage (Reaction A) was higher than that of C–H bond cleavage (Reactions B and C) regardless of the temperature. This suggests that C–C bond cleavage is the more dominant initialization reaction in propane pyrolysis. The produced C2H5 and CH3 radicals from Reaction A can further abstract hydrogen from propane to form i-C3H7 and n-C3H7 radicals, which are the precursors for propylene. In the presence of additional hydrogen abstracting radicals, such as phenyl radicals, the formation of i-C3H7 and n-C3H7 radicals is dramatically accelerated. As illustrated in Fig. 2, hydrogen abstraction from propane using phenyl radicals has a much lower activation energy (Reaction D), meaning that temperature has little effect. This explains the increase in propane conversion and propylene yields in phenyl facilitated propane pyrolysis.

The effect of nitrobenzene partial pressure on product yields and selectivities at 600 °C is shown in Fig. 3. In our experiments, nitrobenzene partial pressure was varied between 0 and 0.17 bar. Propane partial pressure was kept constant at 0.6 bar and inert nitrogen was used as the balance gas so that the total pressure was constant at 1 atm. Our results showed that the yields of all products (Fig. 3A) increased with increasing nitrobenzene partial pressure. This can be explained by the fact that more phenyl radicals were produced with increasing nitrobenzene partial pressure, which resulted in higher concentrations of n-C3H7 and i-C3H7 radicals and increased product yields. However, the selectivity of propylene was found to decrease with increasing nitrobenzene partial pressure in favor of ethylene and methane (Fig. 3B). This trend is agreeable with the modeling results, shown as curves in the figures. To gain a fundamental understanding of the origin of increased propane conversion yet decreased propylene selectivity, flux analyses of the reactions involving major products (C2H4, CH4, C3H6) was conducted.

Fig. 4 shows model predicted major fluxes associated with the reactions involving ethylene production at the end of the reactor. All reaction rates increased with the presence of phenyl radicals. The model suggests that n-C3H7 radicals account for 86% and 77% of the formation of ethylene in neat and phenyl facilitated propane pyrolysis, respectively. Since the formation of n-C3H7 radicals was accelerated by the presence of phenyl radicals, the additional production of n-C3H7 radicals in phenyl facilitated propane pyrolysis resulted in increased ethylene yields. The second most dominant reaction pathway leading to ethylene formation is decomposition of propylene assisted by hydrogen radicals, with methyl radicals (CH3) as the second product. This explains why the decreased selectivity of propylene in phenyl facilitated propane pyrolysis was accompanied by increased selectivity of ethylene and methane.

Model predicted fluxes of reactions involving methane production at the end of reactor are shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that all reaction rates are positive, suggesting that no reactions consume CH4 due to its stability. Increased concentration of phenyl radicals in phenyl facilitated propane pyrolysis results in increased CH4 yields. Moreover, CH4 formation is exclusively through CH3 radicals, part of which is produced from propylene (second reaction in Fig. 5). This explains that increased propane conversion in the presence of phenyl radicals led to increased methane selectivity and decreased propylene selectivity in our experiments.

Fig. 6 shows model predicted fluxes of reactions involving propylene production in neat and phenyl facilitated propane pyrolysis. The reaction rates in phenyl facilitated propane pyrolysis all increase due to higher radical concentrations. The primary radical to produce C3H6 is i-C3H7, which also consumes propylene to form C3H8 and allyl (C3H5-A) radicals. However, the model suggests that about 65% of the C3H5-A radicals convert back to C3H6, with the remaining 35% lead to the production of molecules C4 or larger. Neglecting the reaction pathways involving C3H5-A, Fig. 6 shows that the major pathways responsible for the net consumption of C3H6 are the production of C2H4 and CH3 radicals, which explains the increased selectivity of ethylene and methane and decreased selectivity of propylene in the presence of phenyl radicals in our experiments.

Fig. 6. Model predicted reaction rates for C3H6 production in phenyl facilitated propane pyrolysis and neat propane pyrolysis.
Based on the above flux analyses, major reaction pathways of phenyl facilitated propane pyrolysis are sketched in Fig. 7. The initialization of propane pyrolysis involves either C–C bond breakage to form CH3 and C2H5 radicals or C–H bond breakage to form H and n-C3H7 or i-C3H7 radicals. These radicals formed from the initialization reactions can further abstract hydrogen atoms from propane to produce n-C3H7 and i-C3H7 radicals. When the phenyl radicals produced from nitrobenzene are present, they can abstract hydrogen atoms from propane much more easily, which accelerates the formation of n-C3H7 and i-C3H7 radicals (red arrows). Although n-C3H7 radicals can be converted into propylene, they mainly decompose into C2H4 and CH3 radicals that lead to CH4 (blue arrows). Both n-C3H7 and i-C3H7 radicals lead to the production of C3H6 (green arrows), which can be partly converted into C2H4 and CH3 radicals (pink arrow) and C4 hydrocarbons via allyl (C3H5-A) radicals. Overall, this reaction mechanism suggests that the decreased propylene selectivity in phenyl facilitated propane pyrolysis is due to the increased rates of secondary reactions converting C3H6 into C2H4 and CH4, a result of increased concentrations of n-C3H7 and i-C3H7 radicals.

Fig. 8 shows the yields of nitrobenzene–derived products in the presence or without the presence of propane during pyrolysis. Increased reaction temperature has a positive effect on nitrobenzene conversion and product yields. Phenol, benzene, NO2, and NO were found as the major products, which were produced from nitrobenzene pyrolysis. The mechanism of forming these products is discussed in McCarthy and O’Brien (1980). Specifically, the direct cleavage of aromatic–nitrogen bonds gives NO2 and phenyl radicals, which lead to benzene via subsequent hydrogen abstraction. On the other hand, the rearrangement of the atoms of nitro groups produces aromatic–oxygen bonds instead of aromatic–nitrogen bonds. This atom rearrangement initiates the removal of NO from the nitro groups and produces phenoxyl radicals, which lead to phenol via subsequent hydrogen abstraction. Minor products including indole, diphenylamine, benzonitrile, and propylbenzene were found with yields lower than 1%, which are not shown in Fig. 8. Coupling products from nitrobenzene and propane decomposition, such as ethylbenzene, toluene and styrene, were also found, suggesting the existence of free radical recombination between nitrobenzene–derived phenyl radicals and propane–derived hydrocarbon radicals. These reactions, however, were not included in our kinetic model for simplicity due to their relatively low reaction rates, which were found to only contribute to less than 1% reduction in methane, ethylene, and propylene yields.

4. Conclusions
Neat propane pyrolysis and pyrolysis facilitated by phenyl radicals were performed in a plug flow reactor with a temperature range between 550 °C and 650 °C. The results showed that propane conversion and products yields all increased in the presence of phenyl radicals. Higher nitrobenzene partial pressure resulted in higher propane conversion and product yields. However, decreased propylene selectivity in favor of ethylene and methane was observed. The results from detailed kinetic modeling agreed well with experiments results, and it is suggested that higher concentrations of i-C3H7 and n-C3H7 radicals were produced in phenyl facilitated propane pyrolysis. The increase in n-C3H7 radical concentrations led to increased formation of ethylene and methane, and the increase in i-C3H7 radical concentrations led to increased formation of propylene. However, higher concentrations of n-C3H7 and i-C3H7 radicals also led to accelerated secondary reactions converting C3H6 into C2H4 and CH4 and decreased propylene selectivity. Our work demonstrates that in the presence of a suitable radical, propane conversion could be enhanced and propylene yields could be increased. The balance between increased propylene yields and decreased propylene selectivity, however, remains a major challenge.
