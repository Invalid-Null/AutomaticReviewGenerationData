1. Introduction
Production of propylene from abundant and less valuable propane via oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) has received considerable attentions in the past two decades [[1], [2], [3]]. This ODH reaction provides a thermodynamically favorable route to produce propylene with significant advantages over the current commercial route, which requires high reaction temperatures and encounters problems associated with propane cracking and catalyst coking [4]. To achieve high efficacy, a wide range of metal-oxide catalysts have been explored, and vanadia-containing catalysts are evaluated to be the best ones for the ODH of propane [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. In particular, Mg-V-O mixed oxides, due to their superior activity and propylene selectivity, have been intensively studied in the ODH of propane [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]] since the pioneering work of Kung and co-workers [25].
Three crystalline Mg vanadates, MgV2O6, α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8, are mainly identified in the Mg-V-O oxides, depending on their Mg/V molar ratios and preparation procedures [11]. MgV2O6 consists of highly distorted VO6 octahedra jointed by edges [26], while α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8 contain corner-shared and isolated VO4 tetrahedra, respectively [[27], [28], [29]]. The catalytic performances of Mg-V-O oxides in the ODH of propane depend strongly on their compositions and structures, but with controversial conclusions concerning the active and selective phases. Kung and co-workers [10,25] prepared a series of Mg-V-O catalysts by impregnation of MgO with aqueous solutions of ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) and achieved selective ODH of alkanes on the Mg3V2O8-containing oxides. Thus, they suggested that Mg3V2O8 was more selective than α-Mg2V2O7 because of its less reducible oxygen atoms in the isolated VO4 tetrahedra than the bridging oxygen atoms of V-O-V units in α-Mg2V2O7 [30]. In contrast, Volta et al. [11] found that Mg3V2O8 catalyzed propane oxidation to dominantly form carbon oxides (COχ), whereas α-Mg2V2O7 behaved as the most active and selective phase for the ODH of propane to propylene. They attributed the superior ODH performance of α-Mg2V2O7 to the ability of its corner-shared VO4 tetrahedra in the V2O7 units in stabilizing V4+ sites associated with oxygen vacancies [31], consistent with their observation that α-Mg2V2O7 possesses a greater number of labile surface anions than MgV2O6 and Mg3V2O8 [17]. Rybarczyk et al. also found that α-Mg2V2O7 was more active and selective than Mg3V2O8 from the comparison of their ODH performances at low propane conversions (< 3%) [20]. Differently, Delmon and coworkers [15,16] argued that the V-Mg-O catalysts used in the ODH of propane always consisted of different phases, and thus the catalytic properties could be attributed not to any individual phases, but to the synergism between the different phases. For example, they found that the selectivity of Mg3V2O8 was improved by its coexistence with α-Mg2V2O7 or even with MgO in the ODH of propane, and explained such synergetic effects by a remote control mechanism [16].
These contradictory results might be arisen from the different preparation procedures for the Mg-V-O catalysts or ODH reaction conditions employed by the different authors, as mentioned by Rybarczyk et al. [20], leading to the observed discrepancies in the catalyst components or the propane conversions. The ODH of propane proceeds via a combination of parallel and sequential oxidation reactions [[32], [33], [34], [35], [36]], as shown in Scheme 1, in which propylene is a primary ODH product while COx (CO and CO2) can form via primary combustion of propane or secondary combustion of propylene. Such complicated reaction network reflects the strong effect of the propane conversion on the ODH activity and propylene selectivity, which consequently requires the rigorous measurement of these kinetic data when comparing the intrinsic properties of the Mg-V-O catalysts in the ODH of propane.

To address these problems, pure crystalline MgV2O6, α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8 phases as well as their physical mixtures are prepared in this work, and their structures are characterized before and after the propane ODH reactions. The active redox sites on the Mg-V-O catalyst surfaces are quantified by anaerobic titration with ethanol as a probe molecule, as reported in the literature [[37], [38], [39]], to estimate their turnover frequencies (TOF) in the ODH of propane. Moreover, the kinetics of the primary propane dehydrogenation and combustion reactions, and secondary propylene combustion reactions (Scheme 1) is analyzed, following the method reported by Khodakov et al. [32], which render it possible to compare the intrinsic activity and selectivity of the different V-Mg-O catalysts and consequently to understand the structural requirements for the ODH of propane to propylene.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Three Mg vanadates, MgV2O6, α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8, were prepared by the citrate method described by Gao et al. [40]. Briefly, ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3, Sinopharm Chemical, A.R.) and citric acid (C6H8O7·H2O, Sinopharm Chemical, A.R.) were dissolved in water and heated to 333 K to form a dark green solution, to which magnesium nitrate (Mg(NO3)2·6H2O, Sinopharm Chemical, A.R.) was added under stirring with Mg/V molar ratio of 1/2, 2/2, and 3/2, respectively. Afterwards, the resulting solution was evaporated below 333 K under reduced pressure until a viscous gel was formed, followed by drying at 353 K for 24 h and then a calcination in an air flow (40 mL/min) at 823 K for 6 h. The produced Mg-V-O powder was finally ground and sieved to retain particles with diameters of 180–250 μm.
The biphasic Mg-V-O mixtures with equimolar amounts, MgV2O6+ α-Mg2V2O7, MgV2O6+ Mg3V2O8, and α-Mg2V2O7+ Mg3V2O8, were prepared generally as follows. The two Mg vanadate components were mixed and ground thoroughly before sonication for 30 min in n-hexane. After evaporation of n-hexane under reduced pressure, the mixtures were dried at 393 K overnight. The obtained mixtures were denoted as MP, PO and MO, in which M, P and O represent Mg metavanadate (MgV2O6), Mg pyrovanadate (α-Mg2V2O7) and Mg orthovanadate (Mg3V2O8), respectively. In the similar procedure, a mechanical mixture of Mg3V2O8 and MgO was also prepared by mixing Mg3V2O8 with MgO (240 m2/g) that was prepared by a published method [41].
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The specific BET surface areas of Mg-V-O oxides and MgO were determined by nitrogen physisorption at 77 K using an ASAP 2010 analyzer (Micromeritics) and with a multipoint BET analysis method. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded at a scanning rate of 2°/min on a Rigaku D/Max-2000 diffractometer (Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å, 40 kV, 100 mA). Raman spectra were measured on a Senterra dispersive Raman spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with an Olympus confocal microscope and a charge-coupled device (CCD) detector. The Raman spectra were collected in the 200–1200 cm−1 range with a visible laser excitation at 532 nm in air.
Diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra were taken on a Perkin 650 s spectrophotometer equipped with a 150 mm integrating sphere. A sample chamber containing a unit heater, a thermocouple and a gas flow system was employed in the measurement. Generally, Mg vanadates were first purged by a 20% O2/He flow (50 mL/min) at 723 K for 1 h to remove water and other adsorbates, then cooled to room temperature in a He flow (30 mL/min). The spectra of the dehydrated Mg vanadates were recorded at room temperature in a He atmosphere with the certified reflectance standard (Spectralon, Labsphere) as a reference. The obtained reflectance spectra were converted to absorption spectra using the Kubelka–Munk function, and absorption edge energies (Eg) were calculated by the intercept of a linear fit to the absorption edge, as previously described by Barton et al. [42].
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies (XPS) of Mg vanadates were recorded on an Axis Ultra photoelectron spectrometer (Kratos, UK) with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray (hν = 1486.6 eV) source and an emission current of 15 mA under a pressure of approximate 5 × 10−9 Torr. The binding energies for V 2p3/2 were referred to the adventitious C 1s peak at 284.8 eV, and the surface Mg/V atomic ratios of Mg-V-O catalysts were calculated from the intensities of Mg 2s and V 2p3/2 peaks using the atomic sensitivity factors of the spectrometer.
Temperature-programmed reduction of Mg vanadates in H2 (H2-TPR) was performed on a ChemBET pulsar TPR/TPD analyzer (Quantachrome). Mg vanadates containing about 3 mg V were diluted with silica and placed into a quartz tube (I.D. = 4 mm), then heated to 1323 K in a 10% H2/Ar flow (50 mL/min; Beijing Huayuan, certified mixture) at a constant rate of 10 K/min. Changes in H2 concentration in the exit stream was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) after removing H2O with P2O5 power. The detector response was calibrated using the reduction of pure CuO powder (Beijing Chemicals, >99.0%) under the identical conditions.
The numbers of surface redox sites of Mg vanadates were measured by temperature-programmed surface reaction of C2H5OH (C2H5OH-TPSR) on a home-made apparatus connected to an online mass spectrometer (Hiden, HPR 20). Typically, 400 mg of Mg vanadate was placed in a tubular reactor (I.D. = 6 mm) and treated at 773 K for 0.5 h in a 20% O2/He flow (40 mL/min) to remove the adsorbed water and other adsorbates. The dehydrated sample was further purged with a He flow (40 mL/min) for 1 h at 673 K to remove gaseous O2 molecules and the weakly adsorbed oxygen species on the sample surface. Then, the sample was cooled to 353 K in the same He flow before exposure to a mixture of 9.8 kPa ethanol vapor in He (30 mL/min) for 1 h. Afterwards, the ethanol-saturated sample was purged fully by a He flow (40 mL/min) at 353 K and then heated to 873 K at a rate of 10 K/min in the He flow. Reactant and possible reaction products, including CH3CHO, C2H4, C2H5OC2H5, H2O, CO and CO2, desorbing from the Mg-V-O catalyst surface were continuously monitored by a mass spectrometer with multiple m/e ratios. The responses of mass spectrometer to acetaldehyde and other products were calibrated by the pulses of the corresponding chemical into the He flow (40 mL/min) connected to the mass spectrometer.
2.3. Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane
The ODH of propane to propylene was performed in a continuous flow fixed-bed quartz reactor (I.D. = 6 mm) under ambient pressure using 30–250 mg catalysts (180–250 μm) diluted by 1.2 g quartz sand with the similar particle sizes to prevent temperature gradients. The reaction temperatures were varied from 753 K to 813 K, monitored by a K-style thermocouple placed in the center of catalyst bed. Catalysts including Mg vanadatas and their biphasic mixtures were first treated at 823 K for 1 h in a 20% O2/N2 flow (30 mL/min) prior to the introduction of reactants, which consisted of propane (99.99%, 9.12 kPa), oxygen (99.999%, 1.52 kPa) and balance N2 (99.999%). Reactants and products in the reaction outlet were collected and analyzed with an on-line GC (Shimadzu GC-2014). A porapak Q column (80–100 mesh, 3 m × 4 mm) and a 5 A molecular sieve column (60–80 mesh, 3 m × 4 mm), both of which were connected to a TCD, were used to separate and quantify propane, propylene, and permanent gases such as O2, N2 and COx; while a HP-PLOT/Q capillary column (30 m × 0.53 mm × 40 μm) connected to a flame ionization detector (FID) was used to analyze CH4, C2H4, C3H6, C3H8 and oxygenates. Typically, propane and oxygen conversions were controlled below 2.5% and 10%, respectively, by varying the flow rates of feed gases between 75–200 mL/min. A blank test with quartz sand and feed gases of 75 mL/min at 813 K showed that the propane conversion was below 0.1% in the absence of any Mg-V-O catalysts, suggesting negligible contribution from quartz powder and propane gaseous reactions under the reaction conditions in this work.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural characterization of Mg-V-O catalysts
Specific surface areas for both fresh and used Mg-V-O oxides after propane ODH reaction at 793 K are listed in Table 1. The surface areas for fresh MgV2O6, α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8 were 3.0, 5.8 and 32.4 m2/g, respectively, which changed slightly after ODH reaction (i.e., 3.3, 7.5 and 29.7 m2/g, respectively). For the mechanical mixtures, MP (MgV2O6 + α-Mg2V2O7) and PO (α-Mg2V2O7 + Mg3V2O8), their surface areas remained essentially identical before and after propane ODH reaction, in agreement with the corresponding theoretical values estimated by the mass weighted average of the two individual components. However, the surface area of MO (MgV2O6 + Mg3V2O8) decreased obviously from 15.6 to 10.7 m2/g after propane ODH reaction, and both values were much lower than the theoretical values (20.0 and 18.5 m2/g, respectively), suggesting the changes in the phases for the mixture of MgV2O6 and Mg3V2O8 after pretreatment and propane ODH reaction, as indeed evidenced from the XRD and Raman results below.

MP, PO and MO represent the equimolar mixtures of MgV2O6 + α-Mg2V2O7, α-Mg2V2O7 + Mg3V2O8, and MgV2O6 + Mg3V2O8, respectively.
As shown in Fig. 1, fresh MgV2O6, α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8 only exhibit the diffraction peaks of their respective pure phases (JCPDS card No. 71-1651, 31-0816 and 37-0351, respectively). No change in their XRD patterns was observed after propane ODH reactions at 793 K, suggesting the structural stability of the Mg vanadates. For the biphasic Mg-V-O mixtures, both MP and PO show the identical XRD patters before and after reaction, comprising only the diffraction peaks of the two individual components, implying that intimate contact of α-Mg2V2O7 with MgV2O6 or Mg3V2O8 under the reaction conditions did not form any new Mg-V-O phase. In contrast, a new phase of α-Mg2V2O7 (marked as * in Fig. 1) appeared in the biphasic mixture of MgV2O6 and Mg3V2O8 after pretreatment at 823 K, and the peak intensity became stronger after the propane ODH reaction. The appearance of α-Mg2V2O7 was probably derived from the solid reaction occurring at the boundary of MgV2O6 and Mg3V2O8 at high temperatures, and resulted in the significant decrease in the surface area of the mixed sample, especially after the propane ODH reaction. Moreover, the intensities of the reflection peaks, corresponding to α-Mg2V2O7 in the mixture of MgV2O6 and Mg3V2O8, increased rapidly with increasing treatment temperature from 753 K to 823 K (Fig. S1), suggesting the favorable formation of α-Mg2V2O7 phase at higher temperatures, irrespective of the propane ODH reaction.

These XRD results for the fresh and used Mg-V-O catalysts are confirmed by their Raman spectra (Fig. 2). MgV2O6 shows three strong bands at 923, 837, and 733 cm−1, α-Mg2V2O7 at 949, 902, 874 and 847 cm−1, and Mg3V2O8 at 862 and 830 cm−1, verifying the purity of these Mg-V-O phases [40]. No band at 994 cm−1, characteristic of VO vibration in V2O5, was detected in the fresh and used Mg vanadates, indicating the absence of V2O5 in these samples. The Raman spectrum for the MP or PO mixture shows only the corresponding features of its two individual components, and retains almost intact after catalytic tests at 793 K. In contrast, new Raman bands appeared at 949 and 902 cm−1 for the MO mixture before and after the ODH reaction, reflecting the formation of α-Mg2V2O7 phase, in accordance with the above XRD results.

XPS spectra of the fresh and used Mg vanadates as well as their biphasic mixtures are shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. S2, respectively, and the surface V/Mg atomic ratios estimated from the XPS data are summarized in Table 1. The binding energy (Eb) value of 517.3 ± 0.1 eV corresponding to the V 2p3/2 peak of V5+ species [16,20] was observed for all the fresh Mg-V-O catalysts, and changed slightly after catalytic reactions (Fig. S2). The absence of V 2p3/2 peak between 515.1–516.1 eV assigned to the reduced V3+ or V4+ species indicates the overwhelming V5+ species on the surfaces of the Mg-V-O catalysts. The surface component analysis shows that V/Mg ratios were 2.53, 1.25 and 0.85 respectively on the surfaces of the fresh MgV2O6, α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8, which kept almost constant after propane ODH reactions but still lower than their bulk components, suggesting that propane ODH reactions did not essentially lead to the enrichment of V5+ species on the surfaces of the Mg-V-O catalysts. As for the biphasic mixtures of the Mg-V-O samples, no significant change in either the Eb values or the surface V/Mg ratios, even for the MO mixture with the formation of α-Mg2V2O7 during pretreatment prior to the ODH reaction, was detectable, indicating that spreading of one Mg-V-O phase on the other one did not occur in these mixtures of the Mg-V-O catalysts in the ODH of propane.

The reducibility of the Mg-V-O catalysts was probed by H2-TPR. As shown in Fig. 4a, the Mg-V-O catalysts exhibit single reduction peaks, ascribed to the reduction of V5+ to V3+ by H2, with peak temperatures at 1100 K, 1058 K and 1030 K respectively for MgV2O6, α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8. It is known that the initial reduction stages of vanadium oxides are most relevant to the redox cycles required for the ODH of propane, since previous fundamental studies by Chen et al. [34,43] have revealed that only few lattice oxygen atoms (< 5%) of the supported VOχ are involved in the steady-state propane ODH reactions, and that thorough reduction of V5+ to V4+/V3+ would not occur due to the rapid oxidation of the reduced V4+/V3+ centers by O2. In view of this, H2 consumption rates at the initial reduction stages of the Mg-V-O catalysts, when less than 5% V5+ species are reduced, are plotted in Fig. 4b against temperature. The H2 consumption rates for MgV2O6, α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8 at 873 K are 1.03, 0.22 and 0.13 μmol H2/m2/s, respectively, indicating that Mg3V2O8 is least reducible among the three Mg vanadates, which accords with their measured propane ODH rates, as discussed in the next section.

The local structures of vanadium cations in Mg-V-O oxides were examined using the UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopies because of their sensitivity towards the coordination environment of metal atoms. As presented in Fig. 5, MgV2O6 shows three main absorption bands at 231, 328 and 386 nm, attributed to charge transfer (CT) transition in the distorted VO6 octahedral units of MgV2O6 [13]. These CT bands were shifted to 220, 277 and 323 nm for α-Mg2V2O7 with increasing magnesium content from MgV2O6 to α-Mg2V2O7, in agreement with the reported CT transition characteristics of VO4 tetrahedra connected via VOV bonds [13,44]. For Mg3V2O8, the UV–vis bands were further shifted to 222, 267 and 306 nm, which can be assigned to the electronic transition of isolated and tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ [14]. Apart from the structural discrimination of different Mg vanadates, an accurate description of the electronic properties of vanadium centers by the adsorption edge energies were also derived from their UV–vis spectra, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. S3. The Eg values for Mg3V2O8, α-Mg2V2O7 and MgV2O6 were 3.34, 3.30 and 2.65 eV, respectively. Such a decline in the Eg values, as the structural units of the Mg vanadates change from the isolated VO4 tetrahedra to the oxygen-bridging V2O7 dimers, and further to the distorted VO6 octahedra, is consistent with the reported decreasing trend of Eg for the supported VOχ species with increasing their polymerization degree [45].

The densities of surface active redox sites on Mg-V-O oxides can be quantitatively determined by the selective oxidation of methanol, ethanol and other small molecules as chemical probe reactions [46]. Compared with methanol, ethanol has a higher adsorption constant on vanadium oxides and readily forms ethoxides at a near saturation coverage [47]. Acetaldehyde, which is formed following a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involving the consumption of surface lattice oxygen atoms [[48], [49], [50]], is the primary dehydrogenation product in the ethanol selective oxidation. In particular, ethanol ODH reactions catalyzed by Mg-V-O oxides at 473 K produce acetaldehydes with a selectivity higher than 95% in literature [51] and our experiments (not shown here).
Fig. 6 displays the representative C2H5OH-TPSR spectra for α-Mg2V2O7. Acetaldehydes, ethylene and water were detected by MS with the absence of CO and CO2 in the anaerobic C2H5OH-TPSR process. Acetaldehyde is the only detectable product, accounting for the number of the surface active redox sites in the anaerobic C2H5OH-TPSR. Ethylene formed via an acid-catalyzed pathway does not contribute to the number of active redox sites. According to the amount of the desorbed acetaldehyde, the estimated densities of active redox sites (expressed as the number of surface active redox sites per unit surface area of the catalyst) for MgV2O6, α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8 were 1.48, 1.14 and 0.55 O*/nm2, respectively. In addition to the quantified density of active redox sites, the desorption features of acetaldehyde in the C2H5OH-TPSR profiles can also reflect the oxidative reactivity of the Mg-V-O in the propane ODH reaction, since the ODH reactions of ethanol and propane both occur via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism, and are kinetically relevant to the activity of lattice oxygen atoms on the Mg-V-O oxides [47,49]. The peak temperatures (Fig. S4) of the desorbed acetaldehyde for MgV2O6, α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8 were 497 K, 506 K and 512 K, respectively, suggesting the less oxidative reactivity of Mg3V2O8, compared with MgV2O6 and α-Mg2V2O7.

3.2. Catalytic activity and selectivity
The ODH of propane follows Mars-van Krevelen reaction mechanism [[32], [33], [34]], in which propane reacts with lattice oxygen atoms to form propylene with a rate constant k1 or COx with a rate constant k2. Propylene can also undergo further oxidation to COx with a rate constant k3, as depicted in Scheme 1. At low propane and oxygen conversions, the concentrations of both reactants change slightly after they flow through the catalyst bed. Thus, assuming pseudo-first-order kinetics for propane ODH and combustion of propane and propylene [32], rates can be written as
(1)
r1 = k1 [C3H8]
(2)
r2 = k2 [C3H8]
(3)
r3 = k3 [C3H6]
where rates (r) are expressed in terms of turnover frequencies (TOF) by normalizing activities to per surface active redox site. The initial rates of r1, r2 and r3, as well as the corresponding rate constants of k1, k2 and k3 were obtained by extrapolating rates and selectivities to zero residence time, as previously described by Khodakov et al. [45,49].
The rate constant of k1 can also be given as a function of the apparent activation energy (ΔE1) and the entropy (ΔS1) of propane ODH reaction [35].
(4)
where kB is the Boltzmann constant and h is the Planck’s constant; ΔE1 and ΔS1 are the apparent activation energy and entropy for the primary propane ODH reaction, respectively. By expressing k1 in logarithmic form, Eq. (4) becomes
(5)
from which, the values of ΔE1 and ΔS1 can be estimated. In a similar way, the apparent activation energies and entropies for the propane and propylene combustion reactions can be obtained.
3.2.1. ODH of propane on Mg vanadates
Fig. 7 shows the dependence of propane conversions and turnover rates (normalized to per active surface redox site) on the bed residence time for the propane ODH reaction on Mg3V2O8. Propane conversions increased linearly with increasing the bed residence time, while the turnover rates of propane remained almost constant, indicating that influences from the mass transfer of both reactants and products were negligible under the reaction conditions in this work. With prolonging residence time, a decline in the propylene formation rates and an increase in the COx formation rates were also observed, consistent with the well-established reaction pathways of propane ODH involving the competitive steps of the primary formation of propylene and its secondary combustion to COx (Scheme 1).

Fig. 8a shows the effect of reaction temperatures on the activities of the three Mg vanadates. The initial propane ODH rates for MgV2O6, α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8 at 773 K decreased sequentially from 0.072 s−1, 0.062 s−1 to 0.049 s−1, which is in parallel with their initial reduction rates in H2 (Fig. 4b). Such correlation between the propane ODH rates and H2 reduction rates of the Mg-V-O oxides reflects the fact that both propane ODH reactions and H2-TPR processes follow the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism involving the abstraction of active lattice oxygen species on the Mg-V-O surfaces [52,53]. Clearly, easier removal of lattice oxygen atoms from the distorted VO6 octahedron of MgV2O6 led to the observed higher propane ODH rates, compared to α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8. Such difference in the ODH rates for these Mg vanadates can also be explained by the different absorption-edge energies of their V species. It has been proposed that oxygen-to-metal electronic transition share some common features with primary propane dehydrogenation because of the dissociation of CH bonds via the corresponding transition states requiring electron transfers from lattice oxygen atoms to metal centers [43]. Indeed, the decreasing sequence of propane ODH rates for MgV2O6, α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8 at a given temperature is in accordance with the increasing trend in their Eg values (Table 1). The preferable CT transition processes within the dimeric V2O7 tetrahedral units, compared with those in the isolated VO4 units, might have contributed to the higher propane turnover rates on α-Mg2V2O7 than on Mg3V2O8.

Fig. 8. Dependence of the initial propane ODH rates (a) and C3H6 selectivities (b) on reaction temperatures in the range of 753–793 K (9.12 kPa C3H8, 1.52 kPa O2, balance N2).
Initial propylene selectivities, reflecting the ratio of rates for primary propylene formation to primary propane combustion [32], are displayed in Fig. 8b as a function of temperature. At 773 K, they were 85.6%, 94.6% and 96.3% for Mg3V2O8, MgV2O6 and α-Mg2V2O7, respectively. This is consistent with the declining trend in the values of k2/k1 (Fig. 9a), which represents the rate ratio of primary propane combustion to propane ODH reactions. These results suggest that α-Mg2V2O7 is intrinsically more selective than MgV2O6 and Mg3V2O8, similar to the reported results for the supported vanadium oxides that dimeric V5+ species are more selective than the isolated V5+ species for alkane ODH reactions [32,35,43]. These measured initial selectivities are substantially related to the difference (ΔE12) between the apparent activation energies for propane ODH (ΔE1) and those for propane combustion (ΔE2). The estimated values of ΔE1 and ΔE2 are listed in Table 2, and the values of ΔE12 (ΔE12 = ΔE1 – ΔE2) were -15.6, -30.5 and 16.4 kJ/mol, respectively, for MgV2O6, α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8. The more negative ΔE12 for α-Mg2V2O7 means the preferable propane ODH over its combustion reaction on α-Mg2V2O7, leading to the highest propylene selectivity and the lowest k2/k1 on α-Mg2V2O7 among the three Mg vanadates.

Rate constants were obtained from propane ODH reactions at 793 K. Conditions: 9.12 kPa C3H8, 1.52 kPa O2, banlance N2.
Despite of the favorable propane ODH reaction on α-Mg2V2O7, its initial propylene selectivities decrease from 96.4% to 94.9% as temperature increased from 753 K to 813 K, with an increase in its k2/k1 from 0.038 to 0.053. A similar trend is also observed for MgV2O6, but the reversed one holds for Mg3V2O8. The values of k2/k1 for Mg3V2O8 decreased from 0.18 to 0.15 as temperature increased from 753 K to 813 K, and the initial propylene selectivities, although still lower than those for the other two Mg vanadates, increased from 84.6% to 87.0%. The different response of the initial propylene selectivities and k2/k1 values to temperature can also be explained by the estimated activation energies for propane oxidation. Larger ΔE2 (120.2 kJ/mol) than ΔE1 (89.7 kJ/mol) on α-Mg2V2O7 indicates that propane combustion reaction with a higher activation barrier is more sensitive to temperature, and thus higher temperatures would lead to a larger k2/k1 and a lower propylene selectivity for α-Mg2V2O7. Vice versa, the reversed trend was observed for Mg3V2O8 because of the higher apparent activation energy (98.6 kJ/mol) required for propane ODH than that (82.2 kJ/mol) for propane combustion.
Although the ΔE1 for α-Mg2V2O7 (89.7 kJ/mol) is only 8.9 kJ/mol lower than that for Mg3V2O8 (98.6 kJ/mol), a two times larger value of k1 was measured for α-Mg2V2O7 (Table 2) than that for Mg3V2O8. This implies that pre-exponential factors might contribute differently to the values of k1, in addition to the apparent activation energies. The pre-exponential factor is a function of entropy (ΔS), and reflects the sum of the adsorption entropy of propane on active O* sites and the entropy for further formation of the transition-state species in the ODH of propane [35]. It has been demonstrated that activation of the adsorbed propane species on the dimeric V sites is much more preferential than that on the isolated V sites, because the former process is accompanied by the single electron reduction of the two adjacent V sites (V5+ to V4+) requiring lower energy than the latter with the double electron reduction (V5+ to V3+) of the isolated V site [36]. Different catalytic sites are clearly involved in the cleavage of CH bond via interaction with the lattice oxygen atoms in the ODH of propane on the three Mg-V-O oxides with different structures, leading probably to the different configurations of the transition states on the dimeric V2O7 and isolated VO4 structures. However, the estimated values of ΔS 1 for α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8 catalysts were very similar, being −172.4 and −166.9 J/mol/K, respectively, which thus can’t provide distinguishable information about the reaction transition states on the different structures. Note that even the primary propane ODH process involves many elementary reactions; the obtained apparent entropy may not be directly related to the kinetically relevant steps.
The ratios of rate constants for propylene combustion to propane dehydrogenation (k3/k1) as a function of temperature are plotted in Fig. 9b. The values of k3/k1 for the three Mg-V-O catalysts (6.08–9.75 at 773 K) are greater than unity, indicating that propylene combustion proceeds much more rapidly than propane dehydrogenation. At a given temperature, the measured values of k3/k1 decreased in the sequence of MgV2O6, Mg3V2O8 and α-Mg2V2O7. The highest k3/k1 for MgV2O6 implies the predominant secondary propylene combustion reaction on it, which would lead to the lowest propylene selectivity, especially at high propane conversions. The lower k3/k1 for α-Mg2V2O7 than that for Mg3V2O8 suggests the less favorable propylene combustion on α-Mg2V2O7, as further explained by the difference (ΔE13 = ΔE1 – ΔE3) in the apparent activation energies for propane ODH (ΔE1) and propylene combustion (ΔE3). The values of ΔE13 for MgV2O6, α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8 were 21.5, 14.4 and 20.3 kJ/mol, respectively. The lowest value of ΔE13 for α-Mg2V2O7 should be responsible for the measured smallest k3/k1, rendering it to be the most selective Mg-V-O phase in the ODH of propane. By contrast, the lowest ΔE3 (42.6 kJ/mol) and largest k3/k1 for MgV2O6 imply that it catalyzes severe propylene combustion reactions, causing it nonselective for propane ODH reactions, as previously reported in literature [15,16].
The monotonous decrease of k3/k1 for the Mg-V-O catalysts with temperature also reflects the difference in the activation energy for the propane ODH and propylene combustion reactions. It is known that activation of CH bonds is kinetically relevant to both the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and the consecutive propylene oxidation, but less energy is required to break an allylic CH bond of propylene than that for the dissociation of a methylene CH bond of propane [36,54]. The dissociation energy for methylene CH bonds in propane is 401 kJ/mol, 40 kJ/mol higher than that for allylic CH bonds in propylene (361 kJ/mol) [35]. Therefore, higher temperatures would favor primary ODH of propane to propylene over the subsequent propylene combustion, leading to the observed decreasing k3/k1 values as temperature increases (Fig. 9b).
k2/k1 and k3/k1, derived from the kinetic analysis of propane ODH reaction network, could explicate well the measured propylene selectivities of Mg-V-O catalysts at a given propane conversion. k2/k1 is closely related to the initial propylene selectivity, determining propylene selectivities at low propane conversions (e.g., less than 2.5% in Fig. S5a), due to the insignificant contribution to the overall selectivities from the secondary propylene combustion under such conditions. k3/k1 determines largely the selectivities at high propane conversions, because of the relatively less contribution from propane direct combustion under such conditions caused by the small ratios of k2/k1 (<0.15) and large k3/k1 (>6) for the Mg-V-O catalysts. The highest propylene selectivities were indeed observed on α-Mg2V2O7 at about 20% propane conversions (Fig. S5b), suggesting that α-Mg2V2O7 with low k2/k1 and k3/k1 is the most selective Mg-V-O phase for propane dehydrogenation reactions [40].
3.2.2. Synergetic effect between biphasic Mg vanadates
Synergetic effect is generally defined as the promotion in the catalytic performance for a biphasic or multiphasic mixture with respect to its individual components [55]. This can be explained by several possibilities, including cooperation of different active sites, formation of active interfaces between different phases, surface contamination, and dispersion of one phase on the other [[55], [56], [57]]. For example, such effect on both selectivity and yield has been reported in the ODH of propane [15,16] and cyclohexane [58,59] when Mg3V2O8 is coexisted in intimate contact with α-Mg2V2O7 or MgO. However, none of the above possibilities has been clearly identified to be responsible for the observed promotion effects in biphasic Mg-V-O samples. Carrazán, et al. [16] tried to explain it by a remote control mechanism based on the oxygen spillover from one phase to the other, but no convincing evidence was provided to support their hypothesis.
Next, we tend to closely compare the intrinsic catalytic properties of the Mg-V-O catalysts in the ODH of propane, essential for asserting the synergetic effect. For simplicity, the initial activity is expressed as the rates per unit of surface area of catalysts (nmol/m2/s). In this case, the theoretical rate (r) and selectivity (S) of a mixture can be expressed as its area weighted values, defined by
(6)
(7)
where ri and si correspond to the rate and selectivity for each individual component of the mixture at the same propane conversion, while xi represents the surface area percent of an component in the mixture.
Naturally, if the measured initial rate and selectivity for a mixture are much higher than the theoretical values, synergetic effect exists; otherwise, there is no synergetic effect between the different components. The measured initial propane conversion rates, propylene selectivities, and the rate constant ratios of k2/k1 and k3/k1 for the mixed catalysts are listed in Table 3. Rates and selectivities for the MP and PO biphasic mixtures were very close to the theoretical values within the experimental error (∼10%), irrespective of the propane ODH reaction temperature (at 753 K or 793 K), suggesting no significant synergetic effect between the different phases on rates or selectivities. In addition, both k2/k1 and k3/k1 for the two biphasic mixtures usually fell between the values for each component, providing no any evidence for the promoting effects. These experimental data were in agreement with the previous characterization results that no any new phases, dispersion and migration of one phase on the other, or surface contamination was detected, suggesting the absence of the synergetic effect within MP and PO catalysts in the ODH of propane. Differently, for the MO mixture, MgV2O6 reacted with Mg3V2O8 under reaction conditions to form a new phase of α-Mg2V2O7, as confirmed by XRD and Raman characterization (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Formation of α-Mg2V2O7 led to a significant improvement in the catalytic performance of the MO mixture, and both rates and propylene selectivities at 793 K increased from the theoretical value of 86 to 292 nmol/m2/s and of 88.1% to 93.6%, respectively.

These observations offer more rigorous insights into the synergetic effects of the biphasic Mg-V-O mixtures in the ODH of propane. Gao et al. [15] suggested the possible synergetic effect between the Mg-V-O phases based on the promoted selectivity of Mg3V2O8 by a coexisting α-Mg2V2O7 phase. However, such suggestion needs to be reexamined because their reaction data were not collected within kinetically controlled regime [15]. Consequently, conversions and selectivities obtained under such conditions did not reflect the intrinsic catalytic performances of the employed Mg-V-O oxides. Carrazán et al. [16] also stated the synergetic effect between α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8, according to the obtained higher catalytic performances of the mixture relative to the corresponding theoretical values. However, this conclusion is debatable because they calculated the theoretical values by the weighted sum of conversion or selectivity for each component in the biphasic mixture. They employed same mass weight for α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8 to evaluate their catalytic performances in propane ODH reaction. As a result, the propane conversions and propylene selectivities varied greatly from 41.3% and 15.1% for α-Mg2V2O7 to 8.7% and 10.7% for Mg3V2O8 at 773 K, respectively [16]. At such largely different conversions, expression of the theoretical selectivities for the α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8 mixture as the mass weighted sum of values is apparently inappropriate. Similar problems also exist in the concluded synergetic effect between α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8 in the ODH of hexane on the Mg-V-O oxides [58]. Such problems are mainly related to the known effect of the secondary combustion reaction of propylene [32], which thus requires the estimation of intrinsic reaction rates and selectivities strictly within the kinetic region, especially for probing the synergetic effects of the biphasic mixtures in the ODH of propane.
Regarding the Mg3V2O8 and MgO mixture, our experimental data in Table 3 shows no promotion in both propane conversion rates and propylene selectivities compared with the pure Mg3V2O8 phase, indicative of no synergetic effect in the mixture of Mg3V2O8 and MgO for the ODH of propane. By contrast, Gao et al. stated a synergetic effect between Mg3V2O8 and MgO when comparing the catalytic performances of the Mg3V2O8 and MgO mixed oxides prepared by a chemical citrate method with that of the pure Mg3V2O8 phase [15]. However, the promoting effects should be explained by the observed decrease in the size of the Mg3V2O8 crystallites rather than the synergetic effect between Mg3V2O8 and MgO, as evidenced from their much broader XRD peaks in the mixture with MgO after calcination [15]. Such explanation is also consistent with the previous report that smaller Mg3V2O8 crystallites are much more active and selective than the larger particles in the ODH of propane [21].
4. Conclusions
Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane has been examined on MgV2O6, α-Mg2V2O7 and Mg3V2O8 catalysts as well as on their biphasic physical mixtures. Their intrinsic activities and selectivities for the propane ODH reaction reveal that α-Mg2V2O7 consisting of dimeric V2O7 units are much more active and selective than Mg3V2O8 containing isolated VO4 tetrahedra in the ODH of propane. MgV2O6 favors combustion reactions in spite of its high activity for propane conversion, but it is not a selective Mg-V-O phase for the formation of propylene. α-Mg2V2O7 is the most selective Mg vanadate with low rate constant ratios of k2/k1 and k3/k1, while MgV2O6 composed of distorted VO6 octahedra is not selective for propane ODH reaction because of its high k3/k1 value. From comparison of the biphasic Mg-V-O mixtures of MgV2O6 + α-Mg2V2O7, α-Mg2V2O7 + Mg3V2O8, and Mg3V2O8 + MgO with the corresponding pure Mg-V-O crystallites in the ODH of propane, it is clear that there is no synergetic effect between these different phases on their intrinsic activities and selectivities. The observed superior rates and selectivities on the mixture of MgV2O6 and Mg3V2O8 are arisen from their solid-state reaction to form α-Mg2V2O7 at high temperatures during the ODH reaction.
