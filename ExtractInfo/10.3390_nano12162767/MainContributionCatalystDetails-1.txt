 Based on the multiple document extracts provided, I am unable to synthesize a cohesive and comprehensive summary in the requested XML format. The extracts indicate the documents discuss magnesium vanadium oxide materials as cathode materials for rechargeable aqueous magnesium ion batteries, but do not contain details directly related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. As such, there is insufficient relevant information to populate the XML template fields for catalyst composition, conversion, selectivity, stability, yields, reaction conditions, etc. I would need documents that provide substantive technical details on propane dehydrogenation specifically in order to generate a complete XML summary output. The current extracts focus on battery materials and do not have enough pertinent details for propane dehydrogenation research.
