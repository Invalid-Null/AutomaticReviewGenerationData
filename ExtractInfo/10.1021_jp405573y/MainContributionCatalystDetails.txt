 Unfortunately, the provided extractions do not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation research. All the documents focused on measuring UV absorption cross sections of water molecules and did not mention anything about propane conversion to propylene. Since there are no extractions with pertinent details, I will indicate the document is not relevant in the XML output:
