The given document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically. Though it mentions dehydrogenation of alkanes in general, including propane, it does not focus on conversion of propane to propylene or discuss any specific catalysts for PDH or ODH. The main content is about strategies for integrating direct dehydrogenation (DDH) with selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) to improve the conversion and selectivity of DDH. But it does not go into details of any catalyst for converting propane to propylene. Therefore, this document is not directly relevant to PDH or ODH.
