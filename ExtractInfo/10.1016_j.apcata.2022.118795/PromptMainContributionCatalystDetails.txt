Effect of CO2 on activity and coke formation over gallium-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation
This work investigated the effects of support and CO2 co-feeding on the activity and coke formation over gallium-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The prepared catalysts were characterized by XRD, NH3-TPD, CO2-TPD, O2-TPO, pyridine-IR, Raman and tested in CO2 assisted propane dehydrogenation. The results revealed Ga/HZSM-5 as a highly active and carbon resistant catalyst, more so in the presence of CO2. The structure of coke species was investigated and found to be different over these gallium based catalysts as characterized by O2-TPO and Raman techniques. Coke formation behavior is shown to be directly related to the acid density and strength as well as the topological structure of the support. Moreover, the introduction of CO2 leads to an increase in propane conversion and a decrease in coke selectivity over Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts, although coke species become more graphitic in nature. Lastly, PDH reaction with different co-feeding agents (H2, CO2 and O2) were performed and the results indicate CO2 co-feeding yields the highest propane conversion and lower coke deposition, exhibiting a good application prospect.
1. Introduction
Propene is an essential building block for the synthesis of bulk chemicals and polymers [1], [2], [3], [4]. Light olefins have been traditionally produced as a by-product from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking [5]. As the increase in demand for propene continues to outpace these conventional supply routes, the importance of “on-purpose” propene technologies to close the gap becomes more evident [6]. Catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) provides the highest propene yield and is the most commercially implemented of the likes of MTO/MTP (methanol to olefins/methanol to propene) and olefin metathesis [6], [7].
The PDH reaction is highly endothermic and is thermodynamically limited [1]. To attain economically profitable yields, commercial operations are performed at high temperatures ranging from 500 to 700 °C and low pressures [1], [7]. The biggest challenge at such high temperatures is controlling unwanted side reactions that lead to carbon formation, which is the main catalyst deactivation route [5]. The introduction of transition metal or basic dopants are found to effectively reduce the carbon formation over platinum-based catalyst due to the enhanced alloy formation in the view of catalyst design [8], [9], [10]. Recently, oxidative propane dehydrogenation with CO2 (ODPC) has been regaining some traction as a solution to the major drawbacks of PDH [2]. Utilizing this “soft oxidant”, which is nearly 100 times less oxidizing than O2, is attractive for avoiding over-oxidation of reactants to COx and a loss of propene selectivity [2], [11]. In addition, the use of CO2 is advantageous over O2 from an operations point of view as (i) the formation of explosive mixtures is avoided, (ii) risks of run-away are mitigated, and (iii) hot spots are minimized due to the “soft oxidant’s” high heat capacity and ability to effectively dissipate heat [12].
In the view of thermodynamics, the use of CO2 not only enhances olefin production and addresses the main challenges in PDH, but also contributes to the abatement of the greenhouse gas (GHG) via its reduction to a more valuable product, CO [13], [14]. Unfortunately, the thermodynamic stability of CO2 and the need for very different catalytic sites for C−H cleavage and CO2 activation means finding a suitable catalyst can be challenging. The most widely investigated catalysts for ODPC are supported oxides of cromium [15], [16], [17], indium [18], [19], [20], gallium [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29] and vanadium [30], [31], [32]. The activity of these metal oxides is generally attributed to their redox activity (cromium and indium), where CO2 re-oxidizes the metal center filling its lattice O vacancy, completing the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism [11], [12]. One of the important factors influencing the reaction is the balance between acid and base functionalities required for the activation of the alkane and CO2, respectively [2]. The influence of the support on these acid-base properties and the distribution of catalytic sites is thus another important factor to consider. Typically, high surface area SiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, mixed oxides, and zeolite are used as supports [2].
Gallium-based catalysts for ODPC have been reported to operate via heterolytic cleavage of propane and CO2 activation instead of a redox mechanism [26], [33]. To date, the effect of CO2 co-feeding on the catalytic behavior of Ga2O3-based catalysts in ODPC has been widely studied. For example, Xu et al. showed that CO2 is mainly consumed via the reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) reaction over Ga2O3/TiO2 [22], while on Ga2O3/HZSM-5 [29], CO2 is mainly consumed via the reverse Boudouard reaction, contributing to the enhanced stability of the catalyst. More specifically, Xu et al. reported an increase in activity for Ga2O3/TiO2 and a decrease in activity for Ga2O3/ZrO2 and Ga2O3/Al2O3 upon CO2 addition [22]. A negligible activity for Ga2O3/SiO2 and Ga2O3/MgO was observed due to the lack of acid sites on these catalysts. The differences in activity are thus partly attributed to the different interactions between the gallium species and their corresponding support. Another challenge is thus the competitive adsorption of CO2 which leads to the displacement of propane adsorbed on basic sites [22]. This highlights the importance of tailoring acid-base properties for optimal catalyst performance. More recently, Shao et al. revisited support and loading effects for gallium-based catalysts during ODPC [28]. They concluded that the support and Ga2O3 loading are critical as they directly influence the textural properties, chemical state and dispersion of gallium species, and the acid-base properties of the catalysts. However, most of the work mentioned above is focused on the activity aspect, and a systematic study of the role of CO2 co-feeding on activity, selectivity, coke formation, and time on stream stability for PDH over gallium-based catalysts is still lacking.
Therefore, in this work, the effects of support and CO2 co-feeding on the activity and coking behavior of gallium-based catalysts for PDH were studied. The systematic synthesis and activity testing of 5 wt % gallium oxide on different supports (Al2O3, SiO2, HZSM-5, ZrO2, TiO2), coupled with detailed bulk and surface characterizations, such as XRD, Raman, NH3- and CO2-TPD, O2- and CO2-TPO, helps unravel the factors determining intrinsic activity and coke selectivity. In addition, catalyst performance of the highly active 5%Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) catalyst was investigated under different atmospheres (co-feeding CO2, H2 and O2) in view of practical application.
2. Experimental
2.1. Support preparation
The ZrO2 support was prepared using Zirconium (IV) oxynitrate hydrate (ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) and urea (99%, Sigma-Aldrich). Typically, 11.3363 g ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O was added into 45 mL H2O and stirred for several hours at room temperature to get solution A. 18 g urea was dissolved in 30 mL H2O to get solution B. Afterwards, solution B was added into solution A dropwise and stirred for 1 h. The solution was then transferred to an autoclave and crystallized at 180 °C for 24 h. After crystallization, the product was obtained by filtering, washing, drying at 120 °C overnight, followed by calcination at 550 °C for 4 h. Other supports including SiO2 (Sigma-Aldrich), γ-Al2O3 (NorPro), SIRAL 40 (Al2O3/SiO2 =60/40, Sasol), TiO2 (Sigma-Aldrich), HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40 and 140) (Zeolyst) were obtained from commercial suppliers.
2.2. Preparation of Ga/support catalyst
A series of Ga/support catalysts were prepared via wet impregnation. Gallium (III) nitrate hydrate (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the precursor for the gallium-based catalysts. The precursor materials were used as purchased without further purification. In a typical synthesis, 3 g support was firstly dispersed in 20 mL ethanol and 0.6686 g Ga(NO3)3·xH2O was dissolved in 5 mL ethanol. After that, the Ga(NO3)3·xH2O ethanol solution was added into the support/ethanol mixture dropwise under stirring at 100 °C until ethanol was completely evaporated. Finally, the obtained product was dried at 120 °C overnight followed by calcination at 550 °C for 4 h. The theoretical gallium oxide weight loading (calculated based on Ga2O3) was fixed at 5 wt % and is denoted as 5 %Ga/support catalysts. Moreover, XGa/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40) catalysts, where X = 1, 2.5, and 7.5 wt %, were also prepared by the same method.
2.3. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a diffractometer (Kristalloflex D5000, Siemens) with Cu Kα radiation. The powder XRD pattern was collected in a 2θ range from 10° to 90° with a step size of 0.02° and 30 s dwell time per angle.
The BrunauerEmmettTeller (BET) surface area of samples was determined from N2 physisorption at − 196 °C (Tristar II, Micromeritics). Prior to the measurement, the sample was degassed at 300 °C for 3 h to eliminate volatile and physiosorbed molecules from the surface.
Temperature programmed desorption of NH3 and CO2 (NH3-TPD and CO2-TPD) were performed (Autochem II 2920, Micromeritics) to evaluate the acidic and basic properties of catalysts. The catalyst (0.1 g) was firstly heated to 550 °C in He flow (60 mL·min−1) and kept for 1 h, to remove adsorbed compounds, followed by cooling down to 120 °C for NH3-TPD or CO2-TPD. Afterwards, the catalyst was exposed to a flow of 4 vol % NH3 in He (60 mL·min−1) or CO2 (60 mL·min−1) for 30 min followed by flushing in He flow (60 mL·min−1) for 2 h to remove excess adsorbed NH3 or CO2. Lastly, the reactor was heated to 900 °C with a heating ramp of 10 °C·min−1 in He flow (25 mL·min−1) for NH3-TPD or 60 mL·min−1 for CO2-TPD. Desorbed NH3 and CO2 were detected by an on-line mass spectrometer (ThermoStar GSD 300, Pfeiffer Vacuum) at the atomic mass unit (AMU) of NH (15) and CO2 (44) respectively. The He signal was used as an internal standard for the quantification of MS data.
Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was performed on a scanning electron microscope (JSM-5400, Jeol) to determine the surface gallium loading of prepared Ga/support catalysts. Every catalyst was measured for three times and the average loading was used.
Pyridine-IR measurements were performed on an IR-spectrometer (Nicolet 6700, Thermo Scientific) to distinguish the Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites of the catalysts. Prior to the measurement, the catalyst was degassed in Ar flow at 550 °C for 1 h. After that, the catalyst was mixed with KBr and pressed into self-supporting wafers. Pyridine was adsorbed at room temperature until saturation followed by evacuation to remove physiosorbed pyridine. Finally, the IR-spectrum of adsorbed pyridine was recorded.
Spent catalysts were characterized by temperature programmed oxidation in CO2 (CO2-TPO), performed in the same setup as the TPD measurements. The spent catalysts obtained from time on stream stability tests were heated to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C·min−1 in a flow of CO2 (60 mL·min−1). The oxidation product (CO) was detected by an on-line mass spectrometer (ThermoStar GSD 300, Pfeiffer Vacuum) at the AMU of CO (28) and a TCD detector. Unavoidable interferences due to overlapping fragments were resolved by a signal correction. Since CO and CO2 produce the same fragment at m/z 28, a signal correction factor was used to obtain the CO signal. The correction factor was determined by flowing pure CO2 through an empty reactor and recording the ratios between the fragments. The He signal was used as an internal standard for the quantification of MS data.
Temperature programmed oxidation in O2 (O2-TPO) was performed in-situ after each catalytic test. Firstly, the spent catalyst was cooled down to room temperature in Ar flow (100 mL·min−1) after time on stream stability test. Then, the catalyst was heated to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C·min−1 in a flow of 5 vol % O2 in Ar (200 mL·min−1). Oxidation products (CO and CO2) were detected by an on-line mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 300) at the AMU of CO (28) and CO2 (44) respectively.
Spent catalysts were also characterized by Raman to distinguish the type of coke species. Measurements were performed (Raman RXN1 Analyzer, Kaiser) using an excitation source of 532 nm. The laser spot size was about 1–2 mm with an exposure time of 45 s
2.4. Catalytic tests
The catalysts were tested in a tubular quartz reactor with an internal diameter of 7 mm positioned inside a three-zone electric furnace for propane dehydrogenation with CO2 at atmosphere pressure. Typically, 0.1 g catalyst (100–200 µm) diluted with 0.5 g α-Al2O3 (the mass ratio of dilution and catalyst is 5 for all catalytic tests) of the same size were mixed and placed in the middle of reactor. The temperature of the bed was measured with a type-K thermocouple, axially positioned in the center of the catalyst bed. Thermal mass flow controllers (EL-Flow, Bronkhorst) were used to control the inlet gas flow rates. The catalyst was firstly heated to 550 °C in Ar flow (40 mL·min−1) for 1 h, and then treated in 10 vol % H2/Ar flow (120 mL·min−1) for 30 min. After that, the catalyst was then flushed in Ar flow (40 mL·min−1) for 10 min. Lastly, a flow of reaction mixture (CO2:C3H8:Ar=1:1:8, Ftotal=150 mL·min−1) was introduced over the catalyst. The rate of propene formation was calculated under propane conversions less than 15 %. In another set of experiments, CO2 assisted PDH activation energy was measured at three different reaction temperatures (500, 525 and 550 °C) under the kinetic regime. RWGS activity was tested in the same setup with a feed composition of CO2:H2:Ar=1:1:8 at 600 °C and the catalyst amount is 0.2 g.
Long term stability tests were performed to evaluate the time on stream stability and coke formation behavior of the different Ga/support catalysts at 600 °C. The catalyst amount was varied from 0.1 to 0.5 g (5 %Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40): 0.1 g, 5 %Ga/ZrO2: 0.25 g, 5 %Ga/Al2O3: 0.3 g, 5 %Ga/SiO2: 0.5 g) with a total flow rate of 150 mL·min−1 aimed to reach a similar initial propane conversion. Moreover, the effect of CO2/C3H8 ratio on the time on stream stability was also investigated based on Ga/HZSM-5 catalyst. For these experiments, 0.2 g of catalyst was used with a total flow rate of 150 mL·min−1 with the same C3H8 concentration (10 vol%).
Considering carbon precursors are initiated from the olefin product, propene decomposition was investigated, with and without CO2, over both HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) and 5% Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40). Experiments were performed with 0.1 g of diluted catalyst, which was first pretreated as outlined above, then exposed to a reactive mixture of 10 vol % C3H6 , 10 vol % CO2, and Ar (W/FC3H6 = 11.9 kgcat s molC3H6–1, CO2/C3H6 = 1 or 0 in the absence of CO2, internal standard Ar) for 30 mins, before a TPO test.
Propane dehydrogenation with different co-feeding agents (CO2, H2 and O2) were performed with a catalyst amount of 0.2 g and a total flow rate of 150 mL·min−1 under the same concentration of C3H8 (10 vol%) and co-feeding agents (10 vol%).
The products from the catalytic tests were detected by an on-line gas chromatograph (Thermo Scientific™ TRACE™ 1310 Gas Chromatograph) equipped with Al2O3/KCl, Molsieve 5 Å and HayeSep N columns for the detection of hydrocarbons, permanent gases (O2, N2, CH4, Ar and CO), CO2, H2 and He, respectively. Flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors were used for quantification. The initial activity was measured after 32 min on stream. The carbon balance for all catalytic tests is above 90 %. The role of internal and external mass transfer limitations as well as heat transfer limitations could be discarded on the basis of dimensionless criteria.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Textural and surface properties of Ga/support catalysts
A series of 5 %Ga/support catalysts were firstly characterized by XRD and the result is shown in Fig. 1. Diffraction patterns corresponding to α- or β-Ga2O3 could not be detected for all Ga/support catalysts due to the low loading of gallium. Specifically, gallium-supported on HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40 or 140) with different gallium loadings (Fig. S1) only showed the characteristic diffraction patterns of the MFI structure. This indicates that the gallium species are well dispersed on the surface of HZSM-5 support. When the supports are γ-Al2O3 or SIRAL 40, the corresponding diffraction patterns of γ-Al2O3 were observed. The XRD patterns of 5 % Ga/ZrO2 indicate the as-prepared material is monoclinic phase of ZrO2. However, 5 % Ga/SiO2 exhibits a broad pattern with 2 theta degree ranging from 20 to 30, verifying the amorphous structure of SiO2. Moreover, 5 %Ga/TiO2 indicats an anatase phase of the TiO2 support.

The surface area of different Ga/support catalysts was also measured and the results are listed in Table 1. Among these catalysts, 5 %Ga/SIRAL40 has the highest surface area (458 m2·g−1), however, the lowest surface area (13 m2·g−1) is measured for 5 %Ga/TiO2. All the HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40 or 140) supported catalysts have comparable surface areas ranging from 360 to 400 m2·g−1. Furthermore, the surface content of different gallium-based catalysts was characterized by EDX (Table 1). The actual gallium oxide weight loading on support γ-Al2O3, SIRAL 40 and SiO2 is very close to the theoretical one (5 %). Similarly, the actual gallium loading over the Ga/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40) catalysts with gallium oxide loading of 1 %, 2.5 % is close to their corresponding theoretical one. However, for the other supported catalysts, the actual gallium loading is lower than 5 % which may be caused by the loss of gallium species during catalyst preparation and/or uneven distribution of gallium species on these supports.

The acidic properties of the different Ga/support catalysts were characterized by NH3-TPD, and the results are shown in Fig. 2(a). As observed, these catalysts show very different NH3 desorption profiles. When gallium is supported on HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40 or 140) or SiO2, two distinct peaks centered at 240–300 °C and 400–550 °C, which are attributed to the weak and strong acid sites, can be clearly observed. However, gallium-based catalysts supported on Al2O3, SIRAL 40 or ZrO2 exhibit only one main NH3 desorption peak centered at around 250 °C. Ga/TiO2 did not show any NH3 desorption, highlighting its negligible acid density. The calculated amount of adsorbed NH3 over these catalysts is listed in Table 1. The NH3 density of Ga/support catalyst decreases with the order 5 %Ga/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40) > 5 %Ga/SIRAL 40～5 %Ga/γ-Al2O3 > 5 %Ga/SiO2 > 5 %Ga/ZrO2 > 5 %Ga/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=140) > 5 %Ga/TiO2. It is important to notice that the acid density is similar among Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts with different gallium loading. The acid properties of gallium-supported catalysts and their corresponding supports were also compared in Fig. S2. The acid density of supported catalysts after gallium loading is lower than the counterpart support except for 5 %Ga/SiO2. The increase of acid sites based on SiO2 upon gallium loading could be explained as new acid sites are formed results from the interaction between gallium species and the surface of SiO2. It is also interesting to find that for Ga/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40) catalysts, the weak acid density (centered at 235 °C) is almost unchanged. The decrease of total acid density mainly comes from the decrease of strong acid sites originated from the bridge hydroxyl groups between Si and Al atoms. The ion-exchange between hydrogen and gallium species during the catalyst synthesis process could explain the decrease of strong acid density.

Fig. 2. (a) NH3-TPD and (b) CO2-TPD profiles of different Ga/support catalysts.
Apart from acidic properties, the basic properties of different Ga/support catalysts were also investigated by performing CO2-TPD, and the results are shown in Fig. 2(b). Among these catalysts, 5 %Ga/γ-Al2O3 exhibits the highest CO2 desorption capacity (66.89 μmol∙g−1) with a maximum desorption rate at around 190 °C. 5 %Ga/ZrO2 shows a moderate CO2 adsorption capacity followed by 5 %Ga/SIRAL 40. The CO2 desorption temperature for the above three catalysts are very similar, ranging from 175 to 190 °C, indicating a close CO2 adsorption strength. However, the CO2 adsorption density over Ga/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40 or 140) with different gallium loadings, Ga/TiO2 and Ga/SiO2 catalysts is very low. The calculated amount of CO2 adsorbed on the different gallium-based catalysts is shown in Table 1.
3.2. Initial activity of Ga/support catalysts
The prepared Ga/support catalysts were tested under ODPC conditions and their initial rates of propene formation are compared in Fig. 3. Among these catalysts, the 5 %Ga/HZSM-5 catalyst with a Si/Al ratio of 40 showed the highest rate of propene formation (0.615 mmol·g−1·min−1) at 550 °C. 5 %Ga/ZrO2 showed moderate activity and gallium-based catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3, SIRAL 40, SiO2 and HZSM-5 (Si/Al=140) showed comparable activity. However, 5 % Ga/TiO2 was found to be almost inactive. The catalytic results indicate that the support significantly affects the activity of gallium-based catalysts during ODPC, which is related to the basic properties of catalyst to some extent since the stronger adsorption of CO2 can hinder the adsorption of propane and then affect PDH activity. Ga/γ-Al2O3, Ga/ZrO2 and Ga/SIRAL 40 exhibit a relatively higher adsorption capacity of CO2 (Fig. 2(b)), however, the PDH activity of these catalysts is lower than that of Ga/HZSM-5 catalyst with lower CO2 adsorption density. It is worth mentioning that bare HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40) showed about 40 times lower activity (0.015 mmol·g−1·min−1) than 5 %Ga/HZSM-5, indicating that the introduction of gallium species are responsible for the observed activity, which is related to the formation of new highly active sites. Furthermore, the effect of gallium loading on the rate of propene formation was also investigated over Ga/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40) catalysts. The results show that the rate of propene formation firstly increases with gallium loading and reaches the highest with a gallium oxide loading of 5 wt%. Further increasing the loading, however, leads to a drop of activity. The relationship between activity and loading could be explained by the compromise between the increase in of number of active sites and decrease in gallium dispersion. With the increase of gallium loading, the number of Ga sites increase, however, large gallium particles may be formed under even higher loading. The size of gallium particles on the support was characterized by STEM, however, we were not able to detect the gallium oxide particles using STEM (not shown) due to the poor contrast and high dispersion, as supported by the XRD diffraction patterns. Therefore, there exists an optimal gallium loading for achieving the highest activity per gram catalyst. In addition, the rate of propene formation per mmol gallium is also compared (Fig. S3). Similarly, the gallium-based catalysts supported on HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40) show much higher activities than those with other supports, and 1 %Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) shows the highest rate per mmol gallium. The difference in the activity of Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) with different gallium loadings and different supports also indicates that the formation of highly active site could be related to the interaction between gallium species and the support.

3.3. Active site and kinetic analysis
In order to figure out how the support affects the activity during ODPC over gallium-based catalysts, the activation energy of different Ga/support catalysts was measured. The activation energy over these catalysts varies from 92 to 173 kJ·mol−1 (Fig. 4(a)). Fig. 4(b) shows a good linear dependence between ln(r) and 1/T over these gallium-supported catalysts. Among these catalysts, HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) supported gallium catalysts show lower activation energies (92～108 kJ·mol−1) than that of other Ga/support catalysts. It is worth noting that 5 %Ga/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=140) shows a comparable activation energy (108 kJ·mol−1) to that of 5 %Ga/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40) (92 kJ·mol−1), indicating that the type of active site on Ga/HZSM-5 is similar. However, in the case of γ-Al2O3, SIRAL 40 and ZrO2 supports, the gallium-supported catalysts have a relatively higher activation energy (153～173 kJ·mol−1), while 5 %Ga/SiO2 catalyst has a moderate activation energy (116 kJ·mol−1). The variation of activation energies over different Ga/support catalysts indicates the active site over these catalysts is different and this difference might be related to the interactions with the support. Therefore, the higher activity obtained over Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) catalysts may result from the lower activation energy compared with other Ga/support catalysts. It is worth mentioning that the bare HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) support exhibits a much higher activation energy than the corresponding gallium-supported one (154 vs 92 kJ·mol−1), further suggesting the formation of new active site upon gallium introduction. This also explains why the rate of propene formation over the bare HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) support is much lower than that of 5 %Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) (Fig. 3).

Furthermore, in order to further understand support effects on the activation energy of Ga/support catalysts, three representative catalysts (Ga/SiO2, Ga/γ-Al2O3, Ga/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40)) were characterized by pyridine-IR to distinguish the Brønsted and Lewis acidic sites of the catalysts. Three types of acid sites existed on Ga/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40) catalyst (Fig. S4), the pyridine adsorption peaks centered at 1544, 1456 and 1444 cm−1 were assigned as Brønsted acid site (BAS), strong Lewis acid site (LAS) Ga+ and weak or sterically shielded LAS, respectively [27]. However, only LAS is observed on Ga/γ-Al2O3, and 5 %Ga/SiO2 shows similar characteristic peaks as Ga/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40) except for a much smaller BAS peak. The B/L ratio over Ga/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40) is calculated and the value is 0.16 according to method described in literature [35]. For comparison, pyridine-IR spectra were collected for the corresponding bare supports of these three catalysts, where the peak related to Ga+ species disappears for all supports, further confirming the presence of Ga+ species. As reported in the literature, Lewis−Brønsted acid pairs [GaH]2+ species on Ga/HZSM-5 catalyst show high activity towards the activation of propane [27], [36], [37], [38]. However, when the support is γ-Al2O3 or SiO2, only Lewis acid characteristics of gallium species (Ga+ and GaxOy) with lower C−H activation ability or less Lewis−Brønsted acid pairs are formed (Fig. S4). This can explain why the Ga/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40) catalyst shows the lowest activation energy and highest rate of propene formation. Though 5 %Ga/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=140) also has a low activation energy, the concentration of [GaH]2+ species is lower than that of 5 %Ga/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40) due to the limited exchange capacity of gallium species for the former catalyst with lower acid density (Table 1), leading to a lower ODPC activity than the latter catalyst.
3.4. Effect of support on time on stream stability and coke formation
The time on stream stability of different Ga/support catalysts was assessed and the results are shown in Fig. 5(a). Four representative 5 %Ga/support catalysts (support: HZSM-5(Si/Al=40), Al2O3, SiO2 and ZrO2) were selected for the study of stability and coke formation. Fig. 5(a) shows a steady decrease in propane conversion with time on stream for all catalysts. Among these catalysts, the deactivation rate Kd over 5 %Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) is the lowest (0.0046 min−1), 5 %Ga/Al2O3 and 5 %Ga/SiO2 show a moderate and comparable deactivation rate (Table 2). However, the activity decreases rapidly over the ZrO2 supported gallium catalyst. The sharp decrease of activity for 5 %Ga/ZrO2 is not only caused by coke formation blocking the active sites, but also induced by the presence of CO2, which could react with O2- to form carbonates or block the coordinated unsaturated zirconium sites, resulting in a decrease of number of active sites [39]. Fig. S5 showed the linear regression of initial deactivation data using Eq. (7) for different Ga/support catalysts. In addition, the selectivity to propene, the rate of propene formation and the rate of CO formation over the Ga/support catalysts are shown in Fig. 5(b) and Fig. S6 respectively. 5 %Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) was found to show the lowest propene selectivity (40 %) and highest propene formation rate. This is due to the higher propane conversion and side reactions, such as cracking and aromatization, occuring at the same time, resulting in a decrease of propene selectivity. It is worth noting the rate of CO formation over 5 %Ga/ZrO2 is the highest among these catalysts. Furthermore, Fig. S6(c) shows the relationship between the rate of propene formation and the rate of CO formation over the above catalysts. It is clearly showed that propene formation rate increases linearly with CO formation rate for all Ga/support catalysts. The dependence of propene formation rate and CO formation rate is fitted with a linear equation, the result of which showed that 5 %Ga/SiO2 and 5 %Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) exhibit a relatively higher slope value, indicating the contribution of propene formation upon CO2 introduction toward the overall propene formation is more prominent than the other two catalysts. Meanwhile, 5 %Ga/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40) was tested under RWGS reaction conditions at 600 °C, the results show a stable CO2 conversion about 7 % and the rate of CO formation about 0.23 mmol·g·min−1 with on stream (Fig. S7), further proving the occurrence of the RWGS reaction under ODPC condition.

b
Rcoke is calculated by the ratio of area at higher temperature and lower temperature in Fig. S8.
Furthermore, the spent catalysts after 315 min on stream stability test were characterized by O2-TPO to determine the amount of coke formed and type of coke species. Fig. 5(c) shows the O2-TPO profiles of these spent catalysts and peak deconvolution results are also displayed in Fig. S8. These results clearly indicate the type of coke species and coke amount are different over these spent catalysts, and the calculated amount of coke and peak temperature at the highest CO2 formation rate are summarized in Table 2. It is found all the spent catalysts, except for 5 %Ga/ZrO2, exhibit two CO2 formation peaks: the peaks at lower temperature (500–600 °C) and higher temperature (630–670 °C) ranges corresponding to different degree of graphitization coke species [28], [40]. However, only one peak centered at 446 °C is observed for 5 %Ga/ZrO2 catalyst, indicating the formation of one type of less aggregated coke species. In addition, the ratio of highly aggregated and less aggregated coke species (Rcoke) was also calculated. The higher the Rcoke value, the higher the degree of coke species aggregated. 5%Ga/SiO2 was found to show the highest Rcoke, followed by 5 %Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40), 5 %Ga/Al2O3 and 5 %Ga/ZrO2. This result indicates highly aggregated coke species tend to form on 5 %Ga/SiO2 and 5 %Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) catalysts, which may be caused by the existence of strong acid sites over these two catalysts, however, only weak acid site was found on 5 %Ga/Al2O3 and 5 %Ga/ZrO2 catalysts (Fig. 2(a)), resulting in a lower Rcoke. Although 5 %Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) has higher strong acid density compared with 5 %Ga/SiO2 (Fig. 2(a)), the shape-selectivity effects resulting from the unique microporous structure of the former catalyst effectively retards coke formation [41], [42]. This is supported by the fact that the amount of coke formation over spent 5 %Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) catalyst is the lowest even though the propane conversion and yield of propene are the highest. By comparing 5 %Ga/Al2O3 and 5 %Ga/ZrO2catalysts with only weak acid sites, it was found T1 and Rcoke are both higher over the former catalyst, indicating the type of coke species is also determined by the number of weak acid sites. Therefore, the aggregated degree of coke species on spent catalysts is influenced by acid properties (strong and weak acid sites) and topological structure of catalyst together. Meanwhile, the integrated coke selectivity was also calculated according to Eq. (6) to compare the anti-coking stability of different Ga/support catalysts. These results further proves that HZSM-5 support shows the lowest coke selectivity after Ga addition compared with other supports (Table 2). Combined with the catalytic data showed in Fig. 5 and Fig. S6, it was concluded that 5 %Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) catalyst exhibits the highest propane conversion, propene formation rate and superior time on stream stability.
In order to further study the type of coke species, the spent catalysts were also characterized by Raman and the results are shown in Fig. S9. 5 %Ga/Al2O3 and 5 %Ga/ZrO2 catalysts shows two obvious peaks centered at 1350 and 1610 cm−1, which are ascribed to D (amorphous carbon) and G (graphitic carbon) bands, respectively [43], [44]. It could be found the ratio of G band area and D band area for 5 %Ga/Al2O3 is higher than that of 5 %Ga/ZrO2, indicating the former catalyst contains more graphitic carbon species, which is in accordance with TPO results (Fig. S8, Table 1). Unfortunately, the peak of D band and G band over 5 %Ga/SiO2 and 5 %Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) are not obviously detected. Nevertheless, the Raman characterization results of coke on 5 %Ga/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40) showed the structure of coke is different from those on other supports, indicating a different coke formation behavior which is related to its textural structure and acid properties.
It is interesting to check whether the coke species of spent catalysts could be removed by CO2 to enhance the time on stream stability under ODPC condition. Thus, we performed CO2-TPO test over these spent catalysts and the results are shown in Fig. S10. All the spent catalysts was found to show a CO2 consumption peak at around 800 °C, indicating the removal of coke species after catalytic tests by CO2 is probably not possible due to the lower reaction temperature (600 °C). This does not however exclude possible coke precursor removal in the presence of CO2 under reaction conditions.
3.5. Effect of CO2 on activity, selectivity and coke formation
Since HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) supported gallium catalysts showed the superior catalytic propene formation rate and time on stream stability, the effect of CO2/C3H8 ratio (0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4) on the catalytic performance and coke behavior were investigated over 5 %Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) catalyst. The initial propane conversion is much higher (at least 10 %) under the condition of CO2 co-feeding compared with PDH reaction (Fig. 6(a)). The enhancement in propane conversion under CO2 co-feeding condition may be attributed to the consumption of H2 via the RWGS reaction (Fig. S7), enhancing the forward reaction rate. In addition, the deactivation rate in PDH is about two times higher than that of CO2 co-feeding conditions (Table 3), indicating the introduction of CO2 could retard the deactivation of catalyst. Fig. S11 showed the linear regression of initial deactivation data using Eq. (7) over 5 %Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) catalyst under different CO2/C3H8 ratio. This conclusion could also be proved by the plot of propene yield and time on stream, it is clearly shown that the propene yield under PDH conditions decreases faster than that of CO2 co-feeding conditions, and the higher the CO2/C3H8 ratio, the more stable the propene yield with time on stream (Fig. S12(a)). However, after CO2 co-feeding, the selectivity to propene decreases compared with PDH, which may be result from the higher propane conversion (Fig. 6(b)). Moreover, the rate of CO formation increases with CO2/C3H8 ratio. Because the CO is mainly produced from the RWGS reaction (Fig. S7), the higher the CO2 concentration, the higher the rate of CO formation (Fig. S12(b)). It is worth noting that dry reforming of propane could be excluded since the ratio of rate of CO formation and rate of CO2 consumption is close to 1 (Fig. S12(c)).

b
Rcoke is calculated by the ratio of area at higher temperature and lower temperature in Fig. S13.
Furthermore, O2-TPO of spent catalysts after 315 min on stream stability test were also performed to characterize the coke behavior. Two obvious peaks of CO2 formation could be detected under the conditions of CO2 co-feeding, however, only one CO2 formation peak was found under PDH condition (Fig. 6(c)). The two CO2 formation peaks are attributed to different coke species, the ones at lower temperature (560～580 °C) and higher temperature (650～690 °C) are corresponding to less and highly degree of graphitization coke species respectively [28], [40]. It is worth mentioning that Rcoke under CO2 co-feeding condition is higher than that of PDH, and the higher the CO2/C3H8 ratio, the lower the Rcoke, which is probably because of decreased amount of formed propene (Fig. S12(a), Fig. S13) since propene is regarded as the coke precursor. The larger the amount of propene formed, the higher the possibility of oligomerization reaction occurred. This could also be indirectly proved by the relationship between Rcoke and formed propene amount shown in Fig. S14, the larger the amount of propene formed, the higher the Rcoke value. Similarly, the coke selectivity under the reaction conditions with and without CO2-feeding was also compared according to Eq. (6). Table 3 shows that the coke selectivity under CO2 co-feeding conditions is lower than that of pure PDH except for the condition of CO2/C3H8 equals to 0.5. Combined with catalytic results, these enable us to conclude the introduction of CO2 in the PDH reaction could enhance the time on stream stability and decrease the coke formation.
Furthermore, the spent 5 %Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) catalysts tested in the presence (CO2/C3H8 =4) and absence of CO2 in PDH were characterized by Raman to determine the type of coke species, and the results are displayed in Fig. S15. Though the two peaks related to D and G bands are not well resolved, it still could be seen that under CO2 co-feeding conditions, the ratio of G band area and D band area is higher than that of PDH, indicating the formation of more graphitic carbon species under CO2 co-feeding, which is in accordance with the TPO results (Fig. 6, Table 3). A similar result was also observed on SiO2 supported GaN catalyst that higher proportion of graphitic carbon was formed in the presence of CO2 in PDH [44]. In addition to Raman characterization, these two spent catalysts were also characterized by CO2-TPO aimed to check whether the formed coke species after catalytic test could be removed by CO2. Fig. S16 suggests that a CO2 consumption peak appears at about 800 °C, indicating the removal of coke species of spent catalyst by CO2 is quite difficult. Actually, the reverse Boudouard reaction is a highly endothermic reaction (ΔH=172 kJ·mol−1) with higher reaction barrier, therefore, higher reaction temperature is required to overcome this activation energy. Also, it is interesting to note that the temperature required for coke elimination in CO2 flow is much higher than of O2 due to the fact that CO2 is a moderate oxidant (Fig. 6(c), Fig. S16). Since the temperature of coke removal by CO2 is much higher than the reaction temperature (600 °C), the formed coke on catalyst is probably couldn’t be removed by CO2 under reaction condition. However, the coke selectivity is largely decreased after CO2 co-feeding (Table 3).
In addition to TPO of spent catalysts, we investigated the amount and reactivity of carbon deposits on the supports, in the absence of gallium oxide. Considering carbon formation over acid sites originates from propene, we investigated propene decomposition, with and without CO2, over both the HZSM-5 support and 5 %Ga/HZSM-5 sample. Table S1 shows the amounts of carbon deposited over the samples under the aforementioned conditions. 5 %Ga/HZSM-5 showed a higher amount of coke formation compared with the bare HZSM-5 support, and the introduction of CO2 rarely influenced the amount of coke formation for both HZSM-5 % and 5 %Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts. TPO profiles of these supports (Fig. S17(a)) show that the presence of CO2 has no effect on the amount and reactivity (peak maxima ~625–635 °C) of carbon formed on the support under propene decomposition conditions. The TPO profiles of the 5 %Ga/HZSM-5 samples (Fig. S17(b)), however, exhibited a different behavior. Although the amount of carbon deposited in the presence and absence of CO2 are very similar (Table S1), the reactivity is different. The introduction of the gallium species leads to the appearance of a main peak at around 560–570 °C, as well as a shoulder peak at 450 °C. Additionally, a shoulder peak appears at around 630 °C for Ga/HZSM-5 under propene decomposition conditions in the presence of CO2. We can thus conclude that the presence of CO2 leads to the formation of less reactive carbon, similar in nature to that deposited on the support in the absence of gallium species. Considering the enhanced catalyst stability under PDH conditions with CO2 co-feeding, it is possible that CO2 helps migrate carbon species to the support, preventing gallium sites deactivation via carbon blocking.
3.6. Effect of co-feeding agents on catalytic performance
From the above discussion, we concluded that CO2 co-feeding could effectively enhance the time on stream stability and decrease coke selectivity. Here we systematically compare the activity, selectivity and coke behavior during PDH under different co-feeding agents (H2, O2 and CO2) over 5 %Ga/HZSM-5(Si/Al=40) catalyst. Catalytic results show that the highest initial propane conversion is obtained over the condition of CO2 co-feeding followed by H2 co-feeding and O2 co-feeding (Fig. 7(a)). Because H2 is the product of PDH, the introduction of H2 in PDH will decrease the reaction rates, leading to a lower propane conversion. Contrary to H2, CO2 will react with H2 via the RWGS reaction allowing more products to be formed (Fig. S7). However, oxidative propane dehydrogenation with O2 is an exothermic reaction and is not favorable at such higher temperature (600 °C). Apart from propane conversion, H2 co-feeding condition shows the highest propene selectivity and the lowest value is found under CO2 co-feeding condition (Fig. S18(a)). The difference in propene selectivity may come from the different propane conversion and reaction pathways. It is worth noting that H2 co-feeding exhibits the highest propene yield, however, O2 co-feeding exhibits the lowest (Fig. S18(b)). Therefore, the optimal operation condition for propene production is H2 co-feeding over 5 %Ga/HZSM-5 catalyst.

In addition, the spent catalysts after 315 min on stream test were also characterize by O2-TPO. It is clearly seen that the spent catalyst upon H2 co-feeding has the largest amount of coke and the temperature for coke removal is high (～630 °C) compared with the temperature required for carbon removal under CO2 co-feeding condition, which shows two obvious peaks of CO2 formation (Fig. 7(b)). The highest coke formation under H2 co-feeding condition could be related to the highest propene yield (Fig. S18(b)). Moreover, the peak at lower temperature disappears under the condition of O2 co-feeding, indicating this kind of coke species is not stable in the presence of O2 flow at 600 °C. However, the highly aggregated coke species related to peak at higher temperature (～640 °C) could not be removed under the reaction condition.
4. Conclusions
This work demonstrates that the kinds of support (Al2O3, SIRAL 40, SiO2, HZSM-5, ZrO2, TiO2) significantly affects the activity and coke selectivity for PDH over gallium-based catalysts. Among these supports, HZSM-5 supported catalysts showed the highest propane conversion and lowest coke selectivity. The highest activity obtained on Ga/HZSM-5 (Si/Al=40) is attributed to the formation of active [GaH]2+ species and lowest activation energy, and the coke behavior is closely related to the acid properties (strong and weak acid density) and topological structure of support. In addition, the co-feeding of CO2 is found to increase the activity and decrease the coke selectivity over the superior 5 %Ga/HZSM-5 catalyst. The enhancement of propane conversion in the presence of CO2 could be attributed to reduced backward reaction rate upon H2 consumption through the RWGS reaction or a modification of the active sites. Importantly, CO2-TPO results indicate that coke already formed on catalyst after catalytic test is hardly removed by CO2 via the reverse Boudouard reaction due to fact that the temperature of CO2 consumption appears at very high temperature (～800 °C). Thus, the positive effect of CO2 introduction on coke elimination is probably due to (1) carbon precursors migration to the support and/or (2) modification of gallium active sites. Furthermore, by comparing the catalytic performance of PDH reaction with different co-feeding agents (H2, CO2 and O2) over Ga/HZSM-5 catalysts, CO2 co-feeding was found to show the highest propane conversion, however, the highest propene yield and coke formation were obtained with H2 co-feeding.
