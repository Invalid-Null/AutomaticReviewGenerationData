Chromium oxide supported on MCM-41 as a highly active and selective catalyst for dehydrogenation of propane with CO2
Abstract
Incipient wetness technique was used for a preparation of MCM-supported chromium oxide materials with a Cr loading ranging from 0.7 to 13.7 wt%. The obtained samples were characterized by XRD, UV–vis-DRS, H2-TPR and BET, and tested as catalysts in dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The catalytic reaction was studied in a flow apparatus at 773–923 K. All the tested catalysts exhibited a good catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. The best results were achieved over the sample containing 6.8 wt% of Cr. In this case, the selectivity to propene was above 80%, while the conversion of propane increased from 21% (at 773 K) to 62% (at 923 K). The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene was found for all the studied catalysts. This effect was discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reaction of CO2 with H2 as well as H2-TPR experiments after regeneration of the reduced catalyst with pure CO2. It was suggested that one of reasons of a higher yield of propene observed in the presence of CO2 compared to that measured in the absence of CO2 was coupling of the dehydrogenation of propane with the reverse water–gas shift reaction.

1. Introduction
Propene is one of the most important chemicals used in chemical industry. From the point of view of the number of its applications it could be compared to ethene.
Nowadays, a majority of propene is obtained as one of the products of steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking. Additional sources of propene are dehydrogenation of propane, olefin metathesis and natural gas-based processes. The significance of the latter processes has gradually increased due to an imbalance between propene and ethylene production growth rate (both produced as co-products) resulting in a gap in a propene supply. The strong demand on propene stimulates the studies focused on development of new methods of propene production from alternative substrates and an improvement of the propene yield from the existing processes.
The dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 has been recently studied as an alternative route to the equilibrium-controlled dehydrogenation. It has been shown that in this new process propene can be obtained with a higher yield than in the commercial one. It has been demonstrated that CO2 improves the yield of propene by two independent pathways. CO2 can participate as an oxidizing agent in the following redox cycle:
(1)
C3H8 + MeOx ⇌ C3H6 + MeOx−1 + H2O
(2)
CO2 + MeOx−1 ⇌ CO + MeOx
Such redox mechanism has been proposed for the chromium [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], manganese [10], [11], vanadium [12] and iron [13] oxide-based catalysts. On the other hand, CO2 can play a role in a removal of hydrogen produced in the dehydrogenation of propane (3) by the reverse water–gas shift reaction (4).
(3)
C3H8 ⇌ C3H6 + H2
(4)
CO2 + H2 ⇌ CO + H2O
The reduction of partial pressure of hydrogen shifts the dehydrogenation equilibrium towards the propene formation. Such promoting role of CO2 was proposed to explain a high yield of propene observed over the gallium oxide-based catalysts [14], [15], [16], [17].
It should be kept in mind that the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 has an ecological impact, because it represents the methods for chemical CO2 utilization. In this process CO2 is reduced to CO, which is more valuable as a reactant for chemical industry.
Among all the studied oxide catalysts, the supported chromium oxide-based materials have been pointed out as the most promising ones due to their high catalytic activity. However, in some papers it has been shown that character of the support strongly affects the dehydrogenating properties of the chromium oxide-based catalysts. Thus, over the CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst, which is commercially used in the process of dehydrogenation of light alkanes, the catalytic activity was inhibited by CO2 [1], [2], [6]. The unfavorable effect of CO2 was also observed in the presence of CrOx/ZrO2 system [5], while over CrOx/SiO2 or CrOx/(oxidized diamond), CO2 exerted a promoting effect on the catalyst performances.
It has been recognized that a Cr dispersion is an important factor responsible for the catalytic activity in the propane dehydrogenation in the presence and absence of CO2. De Rossi et al. [18], [19] have proposed that mononuclear Cr3+ species with two coordinative vacancies dispersed on the surface of support are very active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes. These species predominate at low Cr loadings, while at higher loadings less active polymeric species as well as crystalline Cr2O3 are also present. Moreover, in the latter cases not all Cr atoms are accessible to reactants, what has also negative effect on the catalytic activity.
It could therefore be concluded that in order to enhance the activity of chromium oxide-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2 a dispersion of chromium oxide species as high as possible should be achieved. For this reason, more attention has been recently paid on high surface area materials as the supports for dispersing of chromium species. Different siliceous mesoporous sieves, like: MCM-41 [6], [7], [8], SBA-15 [5] or MSU-x [3] have been extensively studied due to their high surface areas (600–1100 m2 g−1), uniform pore size and relatively high thermal stability.
In the present paper, we have reported the catalytic activity of MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts obtained by the conventional impregnation method in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence and absence of CO2. The role of CO2 is discussed on the basis of temperature-programmed reaction of CO2 with H2 and H2-TPR experiments.
2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of MCM-41-based catalysts
MCM-41 support was prepared under basic conditions at room temperature using n-hexadecyltrimethylammonium chloride (HTMACl) as a surfactant and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, Aldrich) as a silica source. A typical synthesis procedure was as follows: Solution A was prepared by mixing of 45.3 cm3 of HTMACl (25 wt% aqueous solution, Aldrich), with 523 cm3 of distilled water, and then 44.0 cm3 of an aqueous solution of ammonia (25 wt%, Polish Chemical Reagents, POCH) was added. The solution was stirred for 10 min and then 48.6 cm3 of TEOS (solution B) was added under vigorous stirring. The molar composition of the obtained gel was TEOS:HTMACl:NH3:H2O = 1:0.16:2.7:150. The stirring was continued for 1 h at room temperature. The resulting solid was filtered off, washed with distilled water and dried in air at 353 K for 6 h. The template was removed from the synthesized samples by heating them up to 873 K at a rate of 2 K min−1 and subsequent calcination at 873 K for 12 h in air.
All the catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness method. Typically, 1 g of dry MCM-41 was treated with 4.2 cm3 of an aqueous solution containing the desired amount of chromium (III) nitrate (Polish Chemical Reagents, POCH). The impregnated samples were dried at room temperature overnight, then heated at 353 K for 6 h and finally calcined at 873 K for 3 h in air. These catalysts are designated as CrX/MCM-41, where x expresses the total chromium content in wt% of Cr.
Pure α-Cr2O3 (Polish Chemical Reagents, POCH) was calcined at 873 K for 3 h in air (before H2-TPR measurements).
2.2. Characterization
XRD patterns were recorded in two ranges of 1–10° and 10–70° (2θ) at room temperature, using a Siemens D5005 instrument operated at 40 kV and 60 mA, equipped with a Cu Kα X-ray source.
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were measured at 77 K using a Micrometrics ASAP 2010 instrument. The samples were degassed at 625 K before measurements. Specific surface areas were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method within the relative pressure range P/P0 = 0.05–0.25. Pore size distributions were calculated from the branch of the adsorption curve using the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model. Pore volumes were obtained from the volumes of nitrogen adsorbed at P/P0 = 0.95 or vicinity.
Diffusion reflectance UV–vis spectra were taken on a Thermo Evolution 600 instrument at room temperature. The spectra were recorded within the wavelength range of 220–850 nm using BaSO4 as a standard.
H2-TPR analysis were performed using Ar/H2 gas mixture (90/10 vol%). The total flow rate of the feed was 30 cm3 min−1. Before experiment the sample (100 mg) was preheated in a stream of dry argon at 873 K for 30 min, and then cooled to room temperature. The sample was heated at 5 K min−1 to the final temperature of 873 K. The H2 consumption was measured by a thermal conductivity detector and NiO was used as a reference for the calibration of H2 consumption.
The mechanism of the RWGS process was studied by temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) of CO2 with H2. The measurements were performed in a flow microreactor system equipped with a QMS detector (Prevac). Prior to the TPSR experiment, a sample (100 mg) was outgassed in a flow of pure helium at 873 K for 30 min. Subsequently, the microreactor was cooled down to about 343 K. TPSR was performed using CO2/H2/He gas mixture with the ratio of 1:1:4 and total flow rate of 12 cm3 min−1. The experiment was carried out with a linear heating rate of 10 K min−1 up to the final temperature of 923 K. The reactants and all possible products of reaction were continuously monitored by the QMS detector. The signal of the helium line served as the internal standard to compensate fluctuations of the operating pressure.
The TPSR of CO2 (99.95 vol%) with H2 (99.995 vol%) was also carried out in sequences of experiments with H2-TPR. Both the TPSR of CO2 with H2 and H2-TPR experiments were done for the same sample of the catalyst using CO2/H2(83/15 vol%, total flow rate 30 cm3 min−1) and Ar/H2 (90/10 vol%, total flow rate 30 cm3 min−1) mixtures, respectively. Before the tests the catalyst was preheated in a dry Ar (Linde 99.998 vol%) stream at 873 K for 30 min, and then cooled to room temperature. The H2 consumption was measured by a thermal conductivity detector. Both Ar and CO2 were additionally purified using a deoxidizer.
2.3. Catalytic tests
The dehydrogenation of propane was carried out in a flow-type quartz reactor packed with 0.5 g of the catalyst (grain size 0.2–0.3 mm). The feed was a mixture of C3H8:CO2(He) at a molar ratio of 1:5 with a total flow rate of 30 cm3 min−1. Prior to the catalytic run, the catalyst was preheated in a dry He stream at 873 K for 30 min. Subsequently, temperature of the reactor was adjusted to a required value and the catalytic test was initiated. The products and unreacted substrates were analyzed using two gas chromatographs. One of them was equipped with a column (3 m × 3 mm) packed with Porapak Q and a flame ionization detector (for hydrocarbons analyses). The second chromatograph was equipped with a column (3 m × 3 mm) packed with Carboxen 1000 and a thermal conductivity detector (for H2, CO and CO2 analyses). All of the catalytic results presented in this paper correspond to the initial state of process (after 10 min-on-stream). Conversion of propane (Cp), yield of propene (Yp) and selectivities to hydrocarbons products (Si) were calculated according to the following equations:
where ai is the number of carbon atoms in the compound i and ni is a number of moles of the compound i. The calculations do not consider the conversion of propane to coke, as its instantaneous formation is time-dependent and difficult to estimate. The conversion of propane to coke estimated independently by temperature-programmed oxidation for the catalyst kept by 3 h in stream of propane was below 2%.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalysts characterization
Fig. 1a and b shows the XRD patterns obtained for pure and Cr-modified MCM-41 in two different regions of 2θ angles. In the 2θ range of 1–10° three well-resolved diffraction lines are observed (Fig. 1a). These lines are indexed to the (1 0 0), (1 1 0) and (2 0 0) reflections, characteristic for hexagonal mesostructure. The intensity of these diffraction lines for the Cr-containing materials decreases as the Cr content increases. However, even in the case of the catalyst with the highest Cr loading (Cr13.7/MCM-41) three diffraction lines are still observed, indicating that the well-organized mesoporous structure of the support was remained during impregnation by the incipient wetness method and subsequent calcination.

In the 2θ range of 10–70°, the diffraction lines, corresponding to the crystal phase of α-Cr2O3 are detected (Fig. 1b). These lines are present in the XRD patterns of the samples with the Cr content higher than 3.4 wt%. The absence of the diffraction lines characteristic for α-Cr2O3 phase in the XRD patterns of the samples with lower Cr loadings may be explained either by a high dispersion of this phase on the MCM-41 support or by a detection limit of XRD technique. Moreover, it is known that even if Cr3+ salts are used for impregnation, the calcination of the sample in air atmosphere results in a partial oxidation of chromium species present on the surface of support into higher valence states [20], [21], [22], [23]. Effectiveness of the Cr3+ oxidation strongly depends on the nature of support and Cr loading. On the surface of the calcined silica-supported chromium oxide catalysts the Cr6+ species have been detected for all the Cr-containing samples. However, at low loadings (below saturation coverage) the Cr6+ species were found to be dominant, whereas above the saturation coverage α-Cr2O3 was formed. The surface composition influences the color of the supported catalyst. Yellow color is characteristic to monochromates, orange to polychromates, while green and blue colors indicate the presence of Cr3+ and Cr2+ species, respectively. The color of the calcined catalysts studied in the present paper changed from bright yellow over pale yellow to dark green with the Cr loading increasing from 0.7 to 13.7 wt%.
An existence of different kinds of chromium oxide species on the MCM-41 surface was confirmed by UV–vis-DR spectroscopy. Fig. 2 shows the UV–vis-DR spectra of the calcined MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts. Two main absorption bands at 270 and 365 nm and one shoulder band at about 440 nm appear for all the samples. These peaks were assigned to Cr6+–O2− charge transfer transition of chromate species [18], [24], [25]. The spectra of the catalysts with the Cr content above 3.4 wt% show additionally two bands at 470 and 600 nm due to the A2g → T1g and A2g → T2g transitions of Cr3+ in octahedral symmetry, respectively. These absorption bands do not appear in the spectra of the Cr0.7/MCM-41 and Cr2.1/MCM-41 catalysts, indicating that Cr6+ species are predominant in the case of the catalysts with a low Cr content.

The reduction effects measured for the studied catalysts depend on the Cr loading. In the case of Cr0.7/MCM-41 catalyst, two reduction maxima at 594 and 685 K were observed. The presence of two peaks could be ascribed to reduction of Cr6+ species differently interacting with the silica support [3], [21]. On the contrary, the TPR profiles of the catalysts with the higher Cr loadings show only one reduction maximum in the temperature range of 590–690 K. An increase in the Cr content above 3.4 wt% of Cr results in an appearance of additional low-temperature reduction maximum at about 553 K. The location of this maximum coincided well with the low temperature reduction maximum observed for calcined α-Cr2O3, which is assigned to reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+ [26] or Cr2+ [27] species dispersed on α-Cr2O3. Therefore, the presence of low temperature maximum confirms an existence of α-Cr2O3 in the catalysts with Cr loading above 3.4 wt%.
The calibration of the detector signal allowed us to calculate the consumption of H2 (μmol H2 g−1) and the ratio of H2/Crtot (Table 1). The H2 consumption increases with the Cr loading up to 6.8 wt% of Cr and then decreases for the catalyst with the highest Cr content, whereas the ratio of H2/Crtot drops dramatically from 1.46 to 0.37 as the Cr loading is increased from 0.7 to 13.7 wt% of Cr. This strong decrease of the H2/Crtot ratio with the increase of Cr loading is due to the formation of crystalline α-Cr2O3. A similar drop of the H2/Crtot ratio with the increase of Cr loading has been observed in the case of chromium oxide systems deposited on various supports (Al2O3 [26], [28], TiO2 [28], ZrO2 [29] or SiO2 [27], [28]). However, the ratios of H2/Crtot obtained for the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts are higher compared to those measured for the SiO2-supported catalysts. It is most likely that this difference is caused by a high surface area of MCM-41 favoring a formation of Cr6+ species.

The textural properties of the calcined samples were characterized by low-temperature adsorption of nitrogen. The calculated specific surface areas, pore volume and average pore size are presented in Table 1. Mesoporous MCM-41 and the Cr/MCM-41 catalysts show a uniform pore size distribution with the pore diameter within the very narrow range between 2.7 and 2.9 nm as calculated by the BJH method. The specific surface area and pore volume decrease gradually with an increase in the Cr loading. These continuous limitations of the textural parameters with the increase of the Cr content are caused mainly by the pore blockage. Moreover, as it has been mentioned above the deposition of Cr on the surface of MCM-41 leads to a decrease in the intensity of the diffraction lines observed in 2θ range of 1–10°. This indicates a small destruction of the structural regularity of the mesoporous structure, which in turn influences the textural properties. However, even in the case of the material with the highest Cr loading, the SBET is only about 23% lower than that of MCM-41.
3.2. Dehydrogenation activity
It is well known that the chromium oxide-based catalysts are active in the oxidative and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons. Therefore, it is not surprising that the CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts exhibit a good catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 as well.
An effect of the chromium loading on the initial conversion of propane and selectivity to propene at 823 K is presented in Fig. 4.

Fig. 4. Variation of the initial conversion of propane (■), carbon dioxide (●), and selectivity to propene (▴) with Cr content in the dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2. Reaction conditions: temperature = 823 K; CO2:C3H8 molar ratio = 5:1; catalyst weight = 0.5 g; reaction time = 0.17 h.
The conversion of propane and carbon dioxide steeply increases with an increase of the chromium loading and reaches maximum for the catalyst containing 6.8 wt% of Cr. A further increase in the Cr loading results in a decrease of both reactants conversion. This can be explained either by pores blocking or by a formation of less active, crystalline α-Cr2O3. The formation of α-Cr2O3 in the samples of Cr6.8/MCM-41 and Cr13.7/MCM-41 was detected by XRD (Fig. 1.) and confirmed by UV–vis-DRS measurements (Fig. 2.). On the other hand, the dehydrogenating activity is proportional to the concentration of high-oxidation state Cr species. The UV–vis-DRS and H2-TPR results clearly show that on the surface of the calcined catalysts with a low Cr content (Cr0.7/MCM-41, Cr2.1/MCM-41 and Cr3.4/MCM-41) the Cr6+ species predominate. Moreover, the H2-TPR studies reveal that the number of Cr6+ species increase up to 6.8 wt% of Cr, similar as the catalytic activity increases. Several studies have revealed that the Cr6+ species generate the dehydrogenation activity [18]. The Cr6+ species are not stable under the dehydrogenation conditions and they are reduced to Cr3+/Cr2+ species at the beginning of the reaction. These low-oxidation state Cr species have been proposed to be catalytically active in the dehydrogenation of light alkanes [18], [27], [30], [31].
Furthermore, the influence of the Cr loading on the yield of propene in the presence and absence of CO2 was investigated. Fig. 5 shows relationships between the yield of propene obtained in the presence (
) and absence of CO2 (YHe), and their ratio (
) as a function of the Cr loading.

(×) with Cr content. Reaction conditions: temperature = 823 K; CO2(He):C3H8 molar ratio = 5:1; catalyst weight = 0.5 g; reaction time = 0.17 h.
The yield of propene is always higher in the presence of CO2 than in the inert gas atmosphere. A similar promoting effect of CO2 was reported previously for the chromium oxide-based catalysts obtained by impregnation of commercial silica with Cr(NO3)3 [1], [2], [9]. Moreover, a clear correlation between the Cr loading and promoting effect of CO2, measured as the ratio of the yield of propene in CO2 to that in an inert gas atmosphere (
), was found. It was shown that the highest
ratio was found for the catalyst with the lowest Cr loading [1], [9]. We observed a similar correlation in this study. However, the effect of the Cr loading on the
ratio was less significant than that observed over the SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalyst. This could be explained by the difference in the dehydrogenating activity of the silica-based materials. The conversion of propane over the Cr–O/MCM-41 catalyst is approximately twice that over the Cr–O/SiO2. Thus, over the Cr–O/MCM-41 catalyst the dehydrogenation reaction is closer to equilibrium limitation. In the consequence the promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene is lower in the presence of the Cr–O/MCM-41 material.
Fig. 6 presents the variation of the catalytic performance with the reaction temperature. The conversion of propane and carbon dioxide increases with raising temperature (Fig. 6a). The yield of propene also rises within the studied temperature range, however slower than the conversion of propane. This effect should be attributed to an acceleration of the side reactions at high temperatures.

Reaction conditions: CO2:C3H8 molar ratio = 5:1; catalyst weight = 0.5 g; reaction time = 0.17 h.
Fig. 6b shows the variation of selectivity to all the hydrocarbon products with the reaction temperature. The main product is propene, which is obtained with the selectivity of 82–90% within the temperature range of 773–923 K. In addition to propene, also light hydrocarbons (methane, ethane and ethene) are formed. These by-products appear as a result of cracking and hydrocracking reactions, which are facilitated at high temperatures. The reaction temperature influences also the molar ratios of the main products (Fig. 6c). It is clear that the ratio of CO/C3H8 rises more steeply with temperature compared to the ratio of H2/C3H8, suggesting that the reaction of CO2 with H2 or C3H8 is facilitated at higher temperature. Moreover, the presence of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in the products mixture may suggest that in the presence of CO2, propene is produced simultaneously in the dehydrogenation and oxidative dehydrogenation reactions. The direct participation of CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over the MCM-41 supported chromium oxide catalysts has been recently proven [6]. It has been proposed that this alternative propene formation pathway is the main reason of the higher propene yield observed in the presence of CO2. However, several studies concerning dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene [32], [33] and isobutane [34] suggested the existence of the synergistic effect between the dehydrogenation and reverse water–gas shift reactions. Our pervious study has revealed that over the SiO2-supported chromium oxide catalysts the higher yield of propene could be also caused by simultaneous consumption of hydrogen (formed in the dehydrogenation) in the RWGS reaction [35]. Taking into account such possibility the activity of all the samples in the RWGS reaction as well as regenerative properties of CO2 were tested in the next section.
3.3. Role of CO2
The catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction was studied using temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR) of CO2 with H2. The products of this reaction: H2O and CO were monitored by QMS during heating of the catalysts in stream of CO2/H2/He mixture (Fig. 7).

Fig. 7. TPSR of CO2 with H2 over MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts. Reaction conditions: CO2:H2:He molar ratio = 1:1:4; 10 K min−1; catalyst weight = 0.1 g.
Over all the studied materials, the reaction between CO2 and H2 started at about 550 K. In the spectrum presented the main line m/z = 18 attributed to H2O one broad peak was observed at around 720 K. This peak can be assigned to reduction of Cr6+ species by H2. The intensity of the H2O and CO signals increase dramatically with the increase of temperature, indicating that the rise of temperature accelerate the reaction between CO2 and H2. Furthermore, the MS signals related to H2O and CO increase with the increase of Cr content up to 3.4 wt% of Cr and than only slightly with further increase of the Cr content. This suggests that the dispersed chromium species are more active in the RWGS reaction compared to agglomerated ones. A similar correlation exists between the dehydrogenation activity and the Cr content. It should therefore be concluded that the dispersed Cr species are responsible mainly for high yield of propene in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2.
The studies on the mechanism of RWGS and forward WGS (water–gas shift) reactions over the oxide catalysts suggest that these reactions may proceed by the surface redox mechanism or by the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism involving surface intermediates [36], [37], [38]. Recently, Ohishi et al. [33] have proposed that over the CrOx/MCM-41 catalysts, the RWGS reaction occurs via the redox mechanism. In this system Cr3+ species are successively reduced to Cr2+ ones by H2 and then reoxidized by CO2. The reduction of Cr3+ to Cr2+ is promoted over silica-support, which facilitates electron fluctuations, necessary for the reduction [20]. Moreover, Cr2+ formation is enhanced for the sample with low Cr content due to high dispersion of the active phase [20], [27].
Fig. 8 shows the results of TPSR of CO2 with H2 and H2-TPR experiments performed for the Cr6.8/MCM-41 catalyst. The goal of these studies was investigation of the oxidative properties of CO2.

TPSR conditions: CO2:H2 molar ratio = 5:1; 10 K min−1; catalyst weight = 0.1 g. TPR conditions: 10% H2 in Ar; 10 K min−1; catalyst weight = 0.1 g. Regeneration conditions: 0.5 or 1.5 h on CO2 stream, total flow rate of CO2 = 30 cm3 min−1.
The series of TPSR/TPR experiments (curves 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5) reveal that the Cr6+ species present in the calcined Cr6.8/MCM-41 catalyst are reduced in the mixture of H2/CO2. Moreover, the H2-TPR experiment (curve 3) after second TPSR of CO2 with H2 cycle (curve 2) shows that the catalyst surface is almost completely reduced. However, the H2-TPR experiment performed after regeneration of the reduced catalysts in a flow of pure CO2 (curves 4 and 5) reveal a small oxidation effect. This effect increases with an increase of regeneration time (Fig. 8b), suggesting that CO2 exhibits very weak oxidative properties. Similar poor oxidative abilities of CO2 were reported previously [1], [6]. This suggests that over the MCM-supported chromium oxide catalysts, the RWGS reaction may also proceed by redox cycle.
4. Conclusions
The MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts obtained by the impregnation method, exhibit a good catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of propane with CO2. Over the most active Cr6.8/MCM-41 catalyst the yield of propene and selectivity to propene are 34.9% and 88.5%, respectively at 823 K.
The high catalytic activity of the chromium oxide based materials both in the dehydrogenation and RWGS reactions is related to the presence of dispersed chromium species. The Cr6+ species dispersed on the surface MCM-41 are precursors for the catalytically active Cr species at lower oxidation states (Cr2+/Cr3+).
The promoting effect of CO2 on the yield of propene observed over the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts is not only attributed to the direct oxidation of propane (oxidative dehydrogenation) but also can be related to a facilitation of simple dehydrogenation by its coupling with the RWGS reaction. The high catalytic activity of the MCM-41-supported chromium oxide catalysts in the RWGS reaction is the additional reason of the observed higher yield of propene.
