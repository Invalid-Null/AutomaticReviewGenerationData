The document discusses the use of surface organometallic chemistry and thermolytic molecular precursors to prepare well-defined heterogeneous catalysts, including single atom sites and supported metal nanoparticles. However, it does not specifically mention propane dehydrogenation or the conversion of propane to propylene. The catalysts and reactions discussed are not directly related to PDH or ODH.
