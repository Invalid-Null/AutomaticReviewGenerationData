Chemical looping oxidative propane dehydrogenation controlled by oxygen bulk diffusion over FeVO4 oxygen carrier pellets
Abstract
The oxygen distribution and evolution within the oxygen carrier exert significant influence on chemical looping processes. This paper describes the influence of oxygen bulk diffusion within FeVO4 oxygen carrier pellets on the chemical looping oxidative propane dehydrogenation (CL-ODH). During CL-ODH, the oxygen concentration at the pellet surface initially decreased and then maintained stable before the final decrease. At the stage with the stable surface oxygen concentration, the reaction showed a stable C3H6 formation rate and high C3H6 selectivity. Therefore, based on Fick’s second law, the oxygen distribution and evolution in the oxygen carrier at this stage were further analyzed. It was found that main reactions of selective oxidation and over-oxidation were controlled by the oxygen bulk diffusion. C3H8 conversion rate kept decreasing during this stage due to the decrease of the oxygen flux caused by the decline of oxygen gradient within the oxygen carrier, while C3H6 selectivity increased due to the decrease of over-oxidation. In addition, reaction rates could increase with the propane partial pressure due to the increase of the oxygen gradient within the oxygen carrier until the bulk transfer reached its limit at higher propane partial pressure. This study provides fundamental insights for the diffusion-controlled chemical looping reactions.

1. Introduction
The chemical looping is a technology that decouples one chemical reaction into multiple sub-reactions with the help of circulating solid intermediates [1]. This technology intensifies the reactions and reduces the exergy loss simultaneously, making it a suitable replacement for processes like fuel combustion or reforming [2], [3]. A typical chemical looping process usually uses oxygen carriers to separate the reaction into reduction and oxidation. In general, the oxygen carrier is reduced by providing its lattice oxygen for the reactant, and then, the reduced carrier is exposed to an oxidant (usually oxygen) to replenish the lattice oxygen. The re-oxidated carrier is transferred back to the reduction reactor to continue the redox cycle [4], [5]. Therefore, the chemical looping process could be versatile by tailoring the oxygen carrier. Several chemical looping processes have been proposed, such as combustion (CLC), reforming (CLR), oxidative coupling (CL-OCM), and dehydroaromatization (CL-DHA) [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17].
The chemical looping process could also be applied to propane dehydrogenation, which is known as chemical looping oxidative propane dehydrogenation (CL-ODH) [18], [19]. This process is considered as a potential supplement to alleviate the gap between the supply and demand of propylene [20]. Unlike catalytic reactions with costly platinum or toxic chromium catalysts, CL-ODH enhances the dehydrogenation process with the help of tailored oxygen carriers [21]. Propane molecules adsorb on the surface of the oxygen carrier and react with surface lattice oxygen to form propylene. Meanwhile, lattice oxygen ions in the bulk of the oxygen carrier diffuse to the surface to replenish the lattice oxygen consumed during the surface reaction or evolve into more active oxygen to produce CO2 [2], [22]. The surface reaction and lattice oxygen ions diffusion coincide during the reaction [2], [17], [23]. As a result, like most chemical looping reactions, both the bulk oxygen behavior and the surface reaction influence the dehydrogenation process, which can be considered as the key to controlling the reactant conversion and the selectivity of the desired product [24]. Several works focus on tuning the reactivity of lattice oxygen to improve the selectivity of the desired product. For example, the doping strategy has been widely used to adjust the lattice oxygen activity, which helps match the oxygen diffusion with the surface reaction and ease the over-oxidation [8], [18]. The surface modification has also been applied to the oxygen carrier to adjust the surface properties, such as changing the surface buffer to facilitate the bulk-surface coupling or varying the property of the active site to enhance the selective oxidation ability [25], [26]. Although plenty of studies focus on the relationship between the surface reaction and bulk oxygen transfer, there is still a lack of quantitative analysis of this process. The kinetic study provides a quantitative tool to recognize this process [27].
The solid-state models are broadly adopted to describe the chemical looping process. The main idea of the solid-state reaction model is to analyze the conversion of the oxygen carriers and select the reaction model to describe the entire reaction according to the Hancock-Sharp method [28], [29], [30]. These models are widely used to study the chemical-looping processes that mainly focused on the mass loss behavior of the oxygen carriers [31], [32], [33]. Although the solid-state reaction model could describe the mass loss process based on the thermogravimetry (TG) data, it is difficult to reflect intrinsic oxygen bulk diffusion and the surface reactions, which could result in the discrepancy between the selected model and actual processes.
For gas–solid reaction, when the bulk transfer of oxygen is much faster than the surface reaction, the oxygen concentration inside the carriers varies uniformly during the reaction [34]. Therefore, it is possible to model this surface-controlled reactions by considering the oxygen content within the oxygen carrier. Yang et al. [35] established the CL-ODH model network based on previously proposed oxygen co-feeding propane dehydrogenation scheme. They substituted the surface oxygen coverage with an exponent decay model to reflect the oxygen change during the reaction [36], [37]. Due to its simple form and accurate gas product predictions, this reaction network has already been applied in CFD simulations for further scale-up design [38]. This method could also be extended to combustion or gasification over NiO and CuO carriers [39], [40], [41], [42], [43].
The bulk transfer of oxygen species can also play a critical role in determining overall performance, when the gas diffusion inside oxygen carriers needs to be considered. Several improvements for solid state models and surface reaction models have been proposed to cope with the complex situations and describe the changes in oxygen carriers. Chen et al. [44] modeled multi-step phase transition in oxidation of Fe-based oxygen carriers with solid-state model, then stringed each step up by considering the effect of gas diffusion as “circuit analysis”, extending the applicability of the series and parallel models to any phase transition system. The shrinking core model (SCM) has been proposed to consider the influence of gas diffusion within the gas film and the oxygen carrier on the gas–solid reaction [45], [46], [47]. Some chemical looping reactions involved more complex phase change or surface reaction processes, which require further improvement to the original gas–solid phase reaction model. Riley et al. [48], [49] used in-situ XRD to investigate the phase transition of the oxygen carrier during H2 and CO reduction of CuFeAlO4 and H2 reduction of CuO-Fe2O3-Al2O3, and modified the surface reaction models with “grain model” assumption to represent how the gas diffusion influenced parallel phase transition process inside the oxygen carriers. Although these kinetic models and mathematical methods could consider the influence of reactant gas and the conversion of oxygen carriers, there is still a challenge in interpreting the relationship between bulk oxygen loss and gas-phase product, especially for oxygen diffusion-controlled reactions [50], [51], [52], [53], [54]. Li et al. [34], [55] analyzed the surface reaction process for H2 and CO combustion on modified CaMnO3 and Fe2O3 using DFT calculations to establish the governing equations. These equations revealed how the surface oxygen-related active site changed during the reaction, which could be considered as the boundary condition and substituted into the bulk transfer equation established based on Fick’s second law. The studies suggest that the distribution and evolution of the oxygen species within the oxygen carrier particle should be further analyzed in details, which is of critical importance for the selective oxidation of propane with the chemical looping process.
This study describes the oxygen bulk transfer within the FeVO4 oxygen carrier pellets during the CL-ODH. The structural evolution of the oxygen carrier is characterized and the CL-ODH performance is examined at 350 °C as selectively oxidative dehydrogenation and over-oxidation reactions are main reactions. Fick’s second law was adopted to model the oxygen bulk diffusion behavior and analyze the influence of the bulk diffusion on the conversion and selectivity of the reaction. In addition, the oxygen loss behavior combined with the elemental conservation analysis is further examined for gaseous products. Furthermore, the effects of the partial pressure of propane on the oxygen transfer within the oxygen carrier and performance of the CL-ODH are discussed in detail.
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Oxygen carrier powders and pellets synthesis
The FeVO4 oxygen carrier powders used in this study were synthesized with the following steps [56]. First, 5 grams of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Aladin, 99.9%) and 2.5 grams of Citric Acid (Fuxing, 99.5%) were mixed and fully dissolved in 80 °C de-ionized water, as solution A. At the same time, 1.5 grams of NH4VO3 were added to 80 °C of de-ion water, and the mixture was gently stirred until the NH4VO3 was thoroughly dissolved to be solution B. After that, solution B was quickly added to solution A to form a mixture. This mixture was heated to 80 °C and stirred until all water was evaporated. Finally, the mixture was dried at 90 °C and ambient atmosphere for 24 hours before being calcinated at 600 °C for 4 hours.
The FeVO4 oxygen carrier pellets used in this study were synthesized with the following steps. First, the well-prepared FeVO4 oxygen carrier powders underwent 300 MPa tablet compressing for about 5 minutes to form thin and compact slabs. Then the thin slabs were calcinated at 550–600 °C for seven days to form compact FeVO4 bulks. The density of the bulk FeVO4 was 4.5 g·cm−3. After that, all the bulks were crushed and sieved to obtain particles with the diameter mainly distributed around 0.04 cm.
2.2. Oxygen carrier pellets characterization
The pellet size was characterized with a Mastersizer 3000 Ultra-high-speed intelligent particle size analyzer. The specific surface area and Brunner − Emmet − Teller (BET) analysis were conducted with a Micromeritics TriStar 3000 analyzer.
The ex-situ X-ray Diffraction (XRD) was used to determine the phase of the carrier pellets with various reduction time. The pellets were first milled into powders and then placed in a curve-shaped cell for characterization. The tests were performed on a powder XRD (Rigaku Smartlab), and a scanning range of 10° to 90° (2θ) with a step rate of 5(°)·min−1 under 15 kV accelerating voltage and 40 mA filament current was used to obtain the XRD pattern.
The in-situ XRD was used to record the phase change process during reduction. The pellets were first milled into powders and then placed in a curve-shaped cell for characterization. The test was performed on an in-situ powder XRD (Rigaku Smartlab). 5 ml·min−1 C3H8 and 15 mL·min−1 N2 were introduced into the in-situ cell during the test, and a scanning range of 15° to 75° (2θ) with a step rate of 5(°)·min−1 under 15 kV accelerating voltage and 40 mA filament current was used to obtain the XRD pattern. The pattern collection frequency is once per 20 minutes.
The scanning electron microscope energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM-EDS) was used to investigate the pellets' surface topography and the surface oxygen concentration. Analysis was performed using the Apreo S LoVac Field Emission scanning electron microscopy. The topography was collected with fixed magnified times of 6500 and 12000, respectively. The voltage and working distance of 15.0 kV and 8.0 mm were fixed to obtain the EDS spectra. Elemental mappings of various components presented on the surface (Fe, V, and O) were obtained by exposing the surface or the cross-section of the reduced oxygen carrier to the electron beam. The distribution of elements was obtained first, with point scanning later to determine the O/Fe ratio across the detected surface [44]. Multiple scans were conducted to obtain an average value selected to represent the surface oxygen concentration. To eliminate the oxygen detected on the carbon conducting resin used to ensure the adhesion of the sample to the microscope stub and represent the average distribution of elements, a moderate area on the surface was detected on each sample. Although the precision of EDS results was limited in providing quantitative information for the element with an atomic number smaller than 11, for example, the O element, the main task of EDS element mapping was to reveal the quantitative trend as the reaction proceeded. In order to compensate for this effect, the O/Fe ratio is rescaled to a scalar from 0 to 1 using measured minimum and maximum values as criteria, and the collected Fe/V ratio is directly shown with raw data [44].
The propane temperature programmed surface reaction (C3H8-TPSR) was used to determine surface reactions that occurred at different temperatures. The test was performed on Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 Chemisorption Analyzer and Hiden HPR-20 QIC Mass Spectrometer. 0.15 grams sample was pretreated under 40 ml·min−1 N2 at 300 °C for 1 hour, and then cooled down to ambient temperature. The analysis was carried out in a 55% C3H8/N2 mixture (40 ml·min−1) from 30 °C to 600 °C at 10 °C·min−1. The output products (C3H8, C3H6, CO2, CH4, H2, and H2O, m/e equals to 29, 41, 44, 16, 2 and 18, respectively) were measured via mass spectrometer (MS).
Carbon element analysis was carried out with a ThermoFisher DeltaV Advantage element analyzer to evaluate the coking on all oxygen carriers.
2.3. Thremogravity (TGA) and gas-phase components analysis
The oxygen carrier reduction experiments were carried out using TGA (Setaram Themys). Mass flow controllers inside the TGA were used to control the flow rate of the reactant and carrier gases injected into the reaction chamber. Oxygen carrier pellets of about 0.15 grams were put in a crucible placed at the bottom of the chamber near the gas outlet for each experiment. The samples were dried at 350 °C for 60 min under nitrogen flow, and then treated with a mixture of propane and nitrogen flow at room temperature for 90 min to avoid the influence of absorbed moisture and gas exchange inside the chamber during the reduction. Afterward, the temperature inside the chamber was raised to the target temperature with the maximum allowed rate (100 °C·min−1) to minimize the reduction during the heating process. The 25%, 32.5%, 40%, 47.5%, 55%, 62.5%, 70%, and 77.5% (mol) propane with nitrogen were used during the reduction with the elimination of mass transfer limitation as mentioned in Supplementary Material. The total flow rate was kept at 72 ml·min−1 for all experiments to ensure the influence of external mass transfer could be ignored. The sample mass and temperature were recorded as a function of time, and the degree of reduction of the pellets,
, was calculated using the following expression:

and
refer to the mass of fresh sample and fully reduced samples which reaches the thermodynamic limit, respectively. So, with the definition of Eq. (1),
and
means the pellets are fresh and spent oxygen carriers, respectively.
To monitor the gas-phase components during the reduction process, a portable, fast gas chromatography (Agilent 490 Micro GC) with two minutes sampling interval is connected to the outlet of the TGA through a gas sampler. The sampler sampled the tail gas at a temperature of about 120 °C at the entries. The TGA-GC assembly as shown in Fig. 1 was calibrated with the method provided in Supplementary Material. The gas-phase components produced along with the oxygen carrier pellets reduction were quantified with GC. The acquired GC data were further analyzed with TGA results to establish the relationship between the gas component formation and the mass loss of carriers.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Reaction performance and pathway of the oxygen carriers
Eight sampling points P1 − P8 (starting at 2400 seconds and ending at 10800 seconds, with a 1200 s interval between each point) were determined and listed in Table S5. Meanwhile, eight copy of identical compact FeVO4 carrier pellets were prepared and marked as 1–8, each weighing 150 mg; afterward, the samples were placed in the crucible inside the TG and reduced to its corresponding sampling point under the condition of 55% (mol) C3H8 using method mentioned in Section 2.3 in sequence. The GC was switched on once reduction begins to collect gas component concentrations. The concentrations were further converted to reaction rates using Eq. (S29). The texture and physical properties of each used sample at P1 − P8 were further characterized, and in-situ XRD experiment was also conducted to determine the phase change of FeVO4 under the propane atmosphere to verify the XRD results from spent samples.
Fig. 2 shows the reaction performance and properties of P1 − P8 pellet samples. From an overall perspective, the reaction experienced several stages. The mass-loss rates increased at the initial reaction, following a decrease in the later part. The main gas products remained CO2 and C3H6, with negligible amounts of CH4, C2H4, C2H6, and CO as side products during the entire reaction. However, the reaction rates for each gas component varied differently as the reaction proceeded, causing the volcanic profile of propane conversion and the increase of propylene selectivity (as shown in Fig. S12(a)). In order to study the overall reaction process, we broadly divided the reaction process into four stages based on the mass loss rate shown in Fig. 2(a), surface element ratio shown in Fig. 2(b), surface reaction rates shown in Fig. 2(c), and XRD results in Fig. 2(d).

At the first reaction stage, the mass loss rate kept increasing (Fig. S12(d)), which reflects an accelerated reduction process in the bulk phase. The surface O/Fe ratio decreased rapidly, but the V/Fe ratio remained stable, which also suggests the decline of the oxygen concentration during the first reaction stage. The XRD results in P1 and P2 show that the pellets stayed in the original triclinic P1̅ crystal structure as the fresh pellets during this reaction stage. Although the surface reaction rates kept increasing, the proportion between the CO2 formation rate and the C3H6 formation rate decreased, causing the increase of propylene selectivity (as shown in Fig. S12(a)).
At the second stage, the mass loss and the corresponding reduction of pellet samples started to slow down. In contrast, both the surface O/Fe ratio and V/Fe ratio remained constant, indicating a constant surface oxygen concentration. The pellets remained triclinic P1̅ crystal structure although the half of available lattice oxygen had already depleted as present in TG data. The C3H8 reaction rate started to decrease, with the stable propylene formation rate and the decrease of CO2 formation rate. This difference among rate changes led to the decrease of propane conversion and further increase of propylene selectivity. The oxygen carrier pellets kept losing oxygen until the initial phase could not be maintained.
At the third stage, the mass loss continued to slow down. The V/Fe ratio remained the same compared to the further decreased O/Fe ratio. Notably, the crystal structure of the pellets is changed from the triclinic P1̅ crystal structure to the rhombohedral and cubic inverse spinel structures. The C3H6 formation rate started to decline at this stage and the overall reaction rates continued decreasing. The phase change of the pellets was also verified with the in-situ XRD result (Fig. S13). At the final stage, the mass loss continued to slow down until the end of the reaction.
The difference between surface and bulk oxygen concentration created a concentration gradient inside the pellet. This gradient affected the bulk oxygen loss rate and surface reaction rate, causing different reaction behaviors at different stages. At the first stage, the surface O/Fe ratio kept declining, which can be attributed to the consumption of surface oxygen by the surface reactions. Meanwhile, with the consumption of the surface oxygen, the oxygen concentration gradient inside the oxygen carrier increased, resulting in an increased diffusion rate of oxygen ions. However, the surface oxygen concentration continued declining as there was insufficient oxygen diffusion from the bulk due to the low concentration gradient between the surface and the bulk. At the second stage, the surface reaction and oxygen bulk diffusion rate finally reached equilibrium and the surface O/Fe ratio remained stable, which indicates that the surface oxygen concentration of the oxygen carrier could be seen as relatively constant. Since the oxygen originated from bulk and the surface oxygen concentration remained constant, the concentration of bulk oxygen kept decreasing, which leads to the decrease of gradient between bulk and surface. The declined gradient further slowed the oxygen transfer and supply, causing the C3H8 conversion rate to decrease. The reaction entered the third stage after most available oxygen was exhausted. Due to further oxygen depletion from the metal oxide lattice, the lattice started to reorientate, causing the formation of cubic inverse spinel structures with iron and vanadium cations filling in the lattice and traceable rhombohedral structure, as shown in Eq. (2). The phase change caused additional oxygen to be released to the surface, causing the deceleration of the bulk reduction and surface reaction. At the final stage, the phase change cannot be observed. Oxygen slowly depleted from the oxygen carrier to the thermodynamical restriction and the reduction ended, and the surface O/Fe ratio had little change.
(2)
The physical property changes of oxygen carriers were further characterized to construct a bulk oxygen loss kinetic model. The surface morphology characterization and BET results in Fig. S10(b) and Table S3 showed that the surface of the fresh oxygen pellets was compact while the SEM showed an intact surface. The surface remained almost compact before the end of the second reaction stage, although a few little pores were forming on the surface (Fig. S10(c)). As the reaction proceeded, the oxygen carriers started to change. The drastic lattice reorientation led to the formation of pores appearing on the surface (Fig. S10(d)). Despite the intense phase change, the pellet size distribution remained the same during the entire reaction at around 400 μm (Fig. S11).
3.2. Oxygen carrier reduction kinetic analysis for the second reaction stage
At the second reaction stage, the texture and physical properties of the oxygen carrier pellets remained relatively constant. Properties, including the oxygen concentration at the surface of the oxygen carrier, the oxygen diffusion coefficient of the oxygen carrier, the compactness of the oxygen carrier, and the geometry of the oxygen carriers did not change during this stage. Meanwhile, the selective oxidation reaction over oxygen carrier became dominant over the over-oxidation reaction. In addition, the propylene selectivity kept increasing. Therefore, this reaction stage is further studied to reveal the relationship between the oxygen migration in bulk and the selective oxidation over the surface in the chemical looping reaction.
3.2.1. Kinetic analysis of oxygen carrier reduction
The coupling of surface reaction and bulk diffusion controls the chemical looping process. We quantified this process with a criteria called “specific regime parameter”, as described in Supplementary Material. When the diffusion of a pellet with a relatively small specific regime parameter (L < 0.3) is fast enough, and the surface oxygen exchange controls the reaction. As the specific regime parameter (0.3 ≤ L < 30) increases, both the diffusion and the surface oxygen exchange contribute to the reaction, which is called the mixed regime. When the specific regime parameter is large enough (L ≥ 30), the diffusion dominates the reaction. In this study, the specific regime parameter is estimated based on TG data and is larger than 30 as shown in Supplementary Material, which suggests that, at the second stage, the reaction is controlled by the diffusion of oxygen within the bulk of the pellet [57].
To analyze the distribution and migration of oxygen within the pellet, a kinetic model was constructed to model the oxygen loss process of oxygen carriers at the second reaction stage. The oxygen concentration on the surface of the oxygen carrier was constant, and the oxygen concentration in bulk decreased during the second reaction stage. As a result, the overall oxygen behavior could be described by Fick's second law [58]:
(3)
Because there was already concentration distribution inside the oxygen carrier
, and the surface concentration remained
during the reaction. Based on the above analysis, the boundary conditions and initial conditions of the equation can be obtained with Eqs. (4), (5):
(4)
(5)
The oxygen concentration inside the oxygen carriers at the second reduction stage can be solved with Eq. (6) under conditions described in Eq.(4) and Eq. (5):
(6)
The key to solving the equation is the initial oxygen concentration distribution,
. It relates to how the first reduction stage proceeded. However, the oxygen carriers underwent dynamic changes in the surface oxygen concentration and the bulk oxygen ion transfer in the first reduction stage, making it difficult to establish an analytical extensional model to represent the process and determine the initial oxygen concentration distribution for the second reaction stage. In addition, the expression is complicated with the non-uniform initial oxygen concentration distribution, making it difficult to conduct the subsequent parameter fitting. As a first approximation, we could assume an oxygen carrier with a uniform oxygen concentration (
) in the bulk and the surface has the concentration
, while oxygen loss process of this assumed oxygen carrier was closed to the analytical extension of the specific solution deduced by Eq.(6). With continuous loss of oxygen, the oxygen loss process of the assumed oxygen carrier at the specified time ranges from
to
can reflect the TG data of the real oxygen carrier.
As Fig. 3 shows, the measured mass loss curve was the blue one presenting a mass loss from
to
. The assumed oxygen carriers started to lose mass at time
with an initial mass of
. The assumed oxygen carriers were reduced to
following the red mass loss curve. If the parameter combination of
,
, and
could be determined to make the red line coincide with the blue one as much as possible in the second reduction stage from
to
, then we could replace the original expression with the mass loss expression of the assumed oxygen carriers and complete the simplification. The boundary and initial conditions for the mass loss process of the assumed oxygen carriers in the second reaction stage are shown in Eqs. (7), (8).

Combined with Fick's second law, we could solve the bulk oxygen distribution of the assumed oxygen carriers:
(9)
The mass loss expression could be acquired by doing volume integral for the entire particle with Eq. (10):
(10)
The results of SEM-EDS determined the start and end times of the second reaction stage with the consideration of the constant oxygen concentration over the surface of the oxygen carrier. The start time of the second reaction stage was 3600 s and the end time was 6400 s at 350 °C and 55% (mol) C3H8 conditions. The nonlinear curve fitting can solve the parameters inside Eqs. (9), (10) with the measured mass loss data in the second reaction stage. We solved the parameters using Curve-Fitting Tools in MATLAB® for the chosen samples, and the results are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the mass loss data fit well with the proposed model in the second reaction stage. We also performed the SEM-EDS cross-section line mapping of the P2 and P3 samples and compared the results with the calculated oxygen distribution in the bulk. The broad match suggests that the proposed model could reasonably reflect the oxygen distribution in the bulk. The carbon element analysis results in Table 2 also show no sign of cocking during the enitre reaction process.

After the model validation, we further derived the distribution of oxygen based on the proposed model, with the results in Fig. 5. We can observe the concentration gradient inside the oxygen carrier pellet from Fig. 5(a) and (b). According to the previous study [57], this suggests the diffusion-controlled reaction. The r bulk diffusion limits the surface reaction, which is also in agreement with the calculation of characteristic length as shown in Fig. S8 and 9. Previous studies discussed this similar effect by attributing it to a sub-surface buffer connecting the bulk and the surface [18], [59]. The bulk oxygen was transferred to the sub-surface. The sub-surface maintained a quasi-stable status due to the natural diffusion properties and supplied the surface with oxygen flux to keep the selective surface reaction stable.

3.2.2. Oxygen consumption over surface reaction
We could further analyze the surface reaction based on the reduction kinetic analysis and gas component data. Fig. S20 shows the propane conversion and propylene selectivity during the second reaction stage. The conversion rate decreased throughout the second reaction stage while the selectivity increased. To reveal the changes of conversion and selectivity, the contribution of oxygen flux from bulk diffusion is further discussed using thermogravimetric relaxation analysis and elemental conservation methods.
The involvement of elemental oxygen in the reaction is determined. The oxygen in bulk diffused to the surface and were consumed on the surface. Based on the diffusion model, the oxygen consumption rate in the second reaction stage could be calculated as follows:
(11)
where
was the molar mass of the oxygen element, and
was the amount of oxygen carrier pellets. The
was the oxygen concentration gradient on the surface, which could be derived by differentiating the oxygen concentration expression:
(12)
In order to further analyze the oxygen consumption, we needed to determine the reactions occurring on the surface first. We performed the C3H8 TPSR, the 30% (mol) C3H6 reaction tests, and the carbon content characterization for fresh and spent carriers. As the C3H8 TPSR results showed (Fig. 6(a)), the main products for the CL-ODH at 350 °C were C3H6, CO2, and H2O. H2 and other alkane products appeared at a temperature higher than 370 °C. Accordingly, propylene is the product of selective oxidation of propane, and carbon dioxide is the product of over-oxidation of propane [60]. In addition, the C3H6 reaction test also proved that the oxidation of C3H6 could also be ignored (Fig. 6(b)). We can confirm that the selectively oxidative dehydrogenation and over-oxidative reaction were the dominant surface reactions at 350 °C. Because of the contribution of the oxidative side reaction and catalytic reaction being negligible, the surface oxygen consumption analysis only took the following two reactions into account:

Reaction (2).
The oxygen consumption rate for generating each main product was calculated by combining the main product formation rate with Reactions (1), (2). These oxygen consumption rates were compared with model-derived oxygen flux and the differentiated TG (DTG) result to clarify the outflow pathways of the oxygen inside the carriers.
As shown in Fig. 7(b) and (c), the total oxygen consumption coincided with the model-derived oxygen flux, which suggests that all oxygen that diffused to the surface of oxygen carriers participated in the surface reaction. Fig. 2(c) shows that the propylene formation rate was relatively stable for the second reaction phase, with the CO2 generation rate gradually decreasing. These led to a stable oxygen consumption rate for selective dehydrogenation and a declining oxygen consumption rate for over-oxidation, as shown in Fig. 7(a) and (b). Concerning the constant surface oxygen concentration in the second reaction phase and the previous research by J. Harber and other researchers, it can be confirmed that surface oxygen could participate in selective oxidation [61], [62], [63]. The surface oxygen concentration was in dynamic balance because of the selective dehydrogenation depletion and the bulk supplement to the surface lattice. However, part of the oxygen would diffuse through the surface without being filled in the surface lattice and later transformed into oxygen with more active oxidation capability, causing the over-oxidation. As the reaction proceeded, the surface oxygen consumption did not change due to the adequate supplement from the bulk. The decline of the total oxygen diffusion during the second reaction stage led to fewer oxygen diffusing through the surface. As a result, less oxygen took part in the over-oxidative reaction, and the CO2 generation rate decreased with the selectivity increasing gradually along with the second reaction stage.

Because the propylene selectivity was closely related to the oxygen consumption for selective oxidation and over-oxidation, the oxygen consumption ratio of over-oxidation to selective oxidation is defined to quantify the contribution of oxygen. As shown in Fig. 8, during the second stage, the selectivity of propylene increased linearly as the oxygen consumption ratio decreased, which broadly agrees with the above analysis. The selectivity increased by only about 20%, with the oxygen consumption ratio dropping dramatically to 1/3 of its original. In addition, although the selectivity was relatively high (Fig. 8(a)), more oxygen was still consumed by the over-oxidative reactions according to the oxygen consumption ratio (Fig. 8(b)). Therefore, in the further study, to increase the propylene selectivity, the oxygen carrier should provide much more proportion of the available oxygen to participate in selective oxidation instead of over-oxidation.

3.3. The effect of the C3H8 concentration in the second reaction stage
We conducted reactions under different propane concentrations to illustrate the effect of the C3H8 concentration. Fig. S14 shows the actual mass loss profile and the corresponding second stage model fitting profile, with Table S4 showing the model parameters during the second reaction stage. Combined with the XRD results, SEM-EDS, and gas-phase product compositions presented in the Supplementary Material (Fig. S16 and S17), it can be considered that the oxygen carriers underwent a similar reaction path under various C3H8 concentrations. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S18, the time duration ratio of stage II to stage III remained constant with various propane concentrations, which further proved the similarity of the reaction path.
However, the propane concentration significantly influenced the reaction performance at the second reaction stage. As shown in Fig. S19, the C3H6 and CO2 formation rates increased as the propane concentration increased when the propane concentration was less than 62.5% (76 kPa). The rate remained relatively stable as the propane concentration beyond 62.5%. In order to interpret the segmentation-like gas product formation rates, we calculated the surface oxygen concentration from the TG fitting results
and compared it with the oxygen bulk transfer rate at the start of the second reaction stage, as shown in Fig. 9(a).

The oxygen bulk transfer rate increased as the C3H8 partial pressure increased below 76 kPa, which led to the surface oxygen concentration decreases. However, as the propane concentration continued to increase beyond 76 kPa, the bulk transfer rate was relatively stable, and the surface oxygen concentration remained unchanged. Previous studies have revealed that the oxygen transport process generally includes the formation of vacancies, transfer of the oxygen ion or cation ion through interstitial or vacancies mechanism, and the consumption of the transported species [21], [64], [65]. These processes were likely limited by the thermodynamic limit once the rates of the processes mentioned above were fast enough [66], [67]. When the C3H8 partial pressure reached 76 kPa, the oxygen transfer could not be further accelerated due to the thermodynamic limit, leading to a stable bulk transfer rate regardless of the C3H8 partial pressure increase.
The rate of selective oxidation was related to the surface oxygen concentration and C3H8 partial pressure. In addition, the oxygen consumed by the oxidation were replenished by the bulk transfer to maintain the surface oxygen concentration stable. When the C3H8 partial pressure was below 76 kPa, although the oxygen concentration at the surface experienced a minor decrease from about 0.06 mol·cm−3 to about 0.054 mol·cm−3 with the increase of C3H8 partial pressure, the rate of selective oxidation could still be increased by the significant increase of the C3H8 partial pressure. In addition, the oxygen available for the over-oxidation increased, resulting in the increase of over-oxidation reaction rate. It could be also found that the oxygen consumed by selective oxidation increased much slower than that for the over-oxidation with the increase of C3H8 partial pressure. As a result, the selectivity to propylene dropped significantly as the C3H8 partial pressure increased.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, the chemical looping oxidative propane dehydrogenation process controlled by oxygen bulk diffusion over FeVO4 oxygen carrier pellets was studied. The evolution of FeVO4 oxygen carriers was classified into four stages based on the reaction performance and structural changes. The oxygen concentration at the surface of the oxygen carrier decreased at the first stage, maintained stable at the second stage, and kept decreasing afterwards. The second stage with the constant oxygen concentration at the surface also showed stable C3H6 formation rate. Therefore, the oxygen distribution and evolution within the oxygen carrier at the second stage were analyzed based on the Fick’s second law. It was observed that this chemical looping reaction was controlled by the oxygen bulk diffusion, which agreed with the comparison between bulk diffusion and surface reaction. The C3H8 conversion rate kept decreasing during the second stage due to the decrease of the oxygen flux caused by the decline of oxygen gradient within the oxygen carrier, while the C3H6 selectivity increased due to the decrease of over-oxidation. In addition, the performance test and characterization results showed that the evolution of oxygen carriers experienced similar stages, but the reaction rates changed significantly. With the increase of propane concentration, the reaction rates increased, and then remained constant when the bulk transfer reached its own limit at higher propane partial pressure. This study provides fundamental insights for diffusion-controlled chemical looping reactions and guidance for rationally design of oxygen carriers for chemical looping processes in the future.
