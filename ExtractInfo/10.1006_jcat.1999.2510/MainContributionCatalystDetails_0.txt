The given document discusses oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on vanadium oxide catalysts, not propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically for conversion of propane to propylene. The document focuses on identifying kinetic and mechanistic aspects of the oxidative dehydrogenation pathways on the catalysts, rather than evaluating catalyst performance for propylene production. Since the focus is not on PDH or ODH for propylene production, the details requested in the template are not applicable.
