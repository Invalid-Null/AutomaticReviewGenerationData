 Unfortunately this document does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses mild dealumination of faujasite zeolites and probing the accessibility and reactivity of protons in sodalite cages, but does not specifically focus on converting propane to propylene via PDH or ODH processes. As such, I am unable to extract the requested information about catalyst composition, performance metrics, or process conditions related to PDH or ODH.
