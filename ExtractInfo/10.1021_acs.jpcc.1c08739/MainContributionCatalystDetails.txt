 Unfortunately the provided documents do not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. All the documents focus on the oxidation of methane to formaldehyde and methanol and do not discuss propane conversion at all. Since there are no extracts related to propane dehydrogenation research, I cannot provide a synthesized summary.
