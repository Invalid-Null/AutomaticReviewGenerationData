This paper does not focus on propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The paper examines CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane over MoOx catalysts supported on reducible CeO2â€“TiO2. It does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or conversion of propane to propylene.
