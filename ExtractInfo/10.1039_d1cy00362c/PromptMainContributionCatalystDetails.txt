CO2-assisted ethane oxidative dehydrogenation over MoOx catalysts supported on reducible CeO2–TiO2†
Supported MoOx on mixed CeO2–TiO2 was investigated for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) using CO2 as a mild oxidant. Raman spectroscopic characterization of the synthesized catalysts under dehydrated conditions suggested that surface MoOx species prefer to anchor on the crystalline domains of TiO2. Upon increasing the amount of CeO2 in the mixed oxide support, significant spectral changes were observed, especially in the ∼900–950 cm−1 region where Mo–O–M bonds are expected. The catalytic behaviors of Mo as opposed to pure support materials were distinct. As the ceria content in the support increased, MoOx catalysts promoted oxidative dehydrogenation pathways via the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism, while pure supports appeared to favor ethane direct dehydrogenation. Investigation of structure–function relationships via in situ Raman spectroscopic efforts revealed that adding ceria not only changed the redox properties of the support but also improved those of the deposited amorphous MoOx species. We also show that upon incorporation of ceria into the support, CO2 directly participates in the reoxidation of the dispersed MoOx species during catalysis. This effect was distinct from the participation of CO2 in the reverse water gas shift reaction. Operando Raman spectra revealed that the presence of CO2 prolonged the existence of the 930 cm−1 feature which appears to correlate well with the relative contribution of the oxidative versus non-oxidative pathway in ethane dehydrogenation.
Introduction
Catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of low molecular weight alkanes has been increasingly gaining interest as an alternative to the direct thermal dehydrogenation route1,2 towards the production of the corresponding olefins. Among olefins, ethylene (C2H4) comprises a valuable intermediate in the petrochemical industry. In light of the recent shale gas revolution,3 abundant ethane (C2H6) resources serve as the stepping stone and strong incentive for academic and industrial communities to advance and evolve research strategies for the production of ethylene.
The requirements of modern catalytic processes for ODH of ethane demand a paradigm shift where rational design of materials directly aims to guarantee high selectivity to olefins by improving redox properties, hampering consecutive olefin overoxidation, limiting coke formation, or enhancing in situ coke removal pathways.4 Utilizing carbon dioxide (CO2) as an oxidant in ODH (eqn (1)) has been recognized in recent years as a promising alternative approach that offers an attractive solution to severe total oxidation of ethylene, resulting in higher selectivity to desired products.5 Since CO2 is the greatest contributor to global climate change, identification of selective reaction pathways in ODH involving CO2 can potentially improve the performance of this important reaction while simultaneously reducing its carbon footprint. Besides hampering olefin overoxidation, other added benefits on the use of CO2 in oxidative dehydrogenation routes comprise a) the in situ release of the heat of the reaction due to the oxidation of the abstracted hydrogen,6 b) the enhanced olefin production through the shift of the equilibrium alkane conversion due to the consecutive reverse water gas shift (RWGS), c) the improved stability of catalytic materials due to CO2 participation in coke removal mechanisms7 and d) the potential of generating H2/CO mixtures through dry reforming with a ratio adequate for the Fischer–Tropsch process.8,9

It is generally accepted that the alkane ODH reaction over several families of supported metal oxide catalysts is strongly dependent on the intrinsic acid–base properties and/or redox properties of the catalysts used, as well as the interaction between active sites and support materials.10–14 These effects have spurred research focusing on the rational engineering of catalyst supports either via doping or mixing different metal oxides with the goal of tuning the aforementioned properties in a desirable manner.10,13,15,16 Besides support effects, post-modification of these supports by depositing secondary active sites in order to improve either the selectivity to olefins or to enhance material stability in conventional ODH with O2 (eqn (2)) has also been carried out.10,17

However, the aforementioned effects are not clear in the case of ODH with CO2 if one takes into account the complex reaction network that can occur simultaneously.18 In addition, the reaction mechanism and role of CO2 as an oxidizing agent in ODH still remain elusive. The majority of studies revealed that oxygen-assisted ODH over many classes of supported metal oxides occurs via a Mars–van Krevelen (MvK)17,19,20 mechanism with the participation of lattice oxygen (eqn (3) and (4)).
C2H6 + M–O → C2H4 + H2O + M–νo (3)

On the other hand, many reports concerning CO2-assisted ODH have demonstrated the combination of direct dehydrogenation (DH) (eqn (5)) and reverse water shift (RWGS) (eqn (6))15,18,21–23 as the primary reaction pathways.
C2H6 → C2H4 + H2 ΔH° = +136.4 kJ mol−1 (5)
CO2 + H2 ↔ CO + H2O ΔH° = +41.2 kJ mol−1 (6)
Additionally, in situ coke removal via the reverse Boudouard21,22,24 mechanism (eqn (7)) and catalyst re-oxidation by CO2 splitting21,25 (eqn (8)) have also been proposed to address i) the complex reaction network and ii) the role of CO2 in promoting catalyst stability.
CO2 + C → 2CO (7)
M–νo + CO2 → M–O + CO (8)
However, the dearth of concrete evidence about the different reaction pathways occurring simultaneously in CO2-assisted ODH over a wide range of catalyst materials hinders our ability to establish a directional methodology for material improvement at the molecular level.
Among investigated catalysts, dispersed metal oxides such as MoOx, WOx, VOx, etc., supported on TiO2 (ref. 11 and 14) have been highlighted to be catalytically active materials for C–H activation, which is the rate limiting step in ODH of ethane. In addition, the physicochemical properties of TiO2 can be modified via the incorporation of CeO2.26–28 It is also noteworthy to mention that mixed CeO2–TiO2 supports have shown improved reactivity in other selective oxidation reactions such as the oxidation of dichloroethane.29 In this work, we study the performance of ODH of ethane over MoOx deposited on TiO2 and mixed CeO2–TiO2 supports. This study focuses on unraveling the effect of MoOx loading as well as the nature of the composition of the mixed CeO2–TiO2 support on the CO2-assisted ODH of ethane. Efforts are made to understand possible competing ethane conversion pathways and how CO2 affects the relative performance of different catalysts. In situ and operando Raman spectroscopy is utilized in an attempt to develop novel structure–reactivity correlations.
Experimental
Materials and synthesis of catalysts
Ce(NO3)3·6H2O (99.99%), Ti(OCH2CH2CH2CH3)4 (97%), TiO2 (99.9% Degussa P25), and (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (99.98%) were purchased from Evonik. Mixed CeO2–TiO2 was synthesized by following a sol–gel method as reported elsewhere.29,30 In the sol–gel synthesis, typically, solution A was prepared by vigorously stirring a mixture of 10 g Ti(OC4H9)4, 3 mL of CH3COOH and 40 mL of C2H5OH. The pH of the solution was then adjusted to 2–3 via dropwise addition of HNO3. For solution B, an amount of Ce(NO3)3·6H2O was dissolved in 4 mL of deionized H2O and 20 mL of C2H5OH. Solution B was then added dropwise into solution A under vigorous stirring to form a transparent, homogeneous solution. The resulting solution was aged at room temperature for 1 h and then was heated up to 70 °C at which it was kept for 2 h in order to form a gel. The concentration of solution B was varied to modify the Ce content of the final material. The gel was dried at 70 °C for 72 h and the remaining solid underwent calcination at 600 °C in the presence of 100 ml min−1 air for 4 h with a ramp rate of 2 °C min−1. The synthesized CeO2–TiO2 mixtures were labeled as xCeTi, where x was formulated as:
Molybdenum oxide species were deposited on P25 and mixed CeO2–TiO2 supports by wet impregnation. A pre-calculated amount of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O that leads to a final atomic density within 1–5 Mo per nm2 was dissolved in 40 mL of deionized H2O to form a transparent solution. 1 g of the prepared oxide support was then added into the solution. This slurry mixture was then dried in a rotary evaporator at 40 °C under reduced pressure before being calcined at 600 °C for 4 h. The final catalysts were labeled as yMo/xCeTi.
Characterization methods
The crystallinity and phase composition of synthesized CeO2–TiO2 samples were analyzed by using X-ray diffraction measurements (XRD). The analysis was carried out with a PANalytical Philips X'Pert X-ray diffractometer equipped with a Cu-Kα source at 40 kV and 40 mA and angular incidence 2θ between 20° and 90° with 0.05° steps and 2.0 s per step. Silicon was used as an external standard reference to determine any possible peak shift.
The specific surface area of the prepared oxide support was estimated through the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method using a Quantachrome Autosorb-1 instrument. The BET measurements were carried out under cryogenic conditions after degassing the samples at 150 °C for 3 h.
The absorbance properties of the purchased P25 and prepared CeO2–TiO2 were characterized using UV-vis spectroscopy. Diffuse-reflectance UV-visible spectroscopy was carried out in a Thermo Scientific Evolution 3000 spectrophotometer equipped with a Harrick Scientific Praying Mantis diffuse reflectance accessory. Spectra were scanned between 190 nm and 1100 nm in intervals of either 0.5 nm or 2.0 nm. The absolute reflectance standard was collected using a Spectralon® disk.
Raman spectroscopy studies were carried out using a HORIBA LabRAM HR Evolution high spatial and spectral resolution spectrometer. The incident beam (532 nm, 80 mW) was directed on the samples and focused by a 50× long-working distance objective. The power of the laser was maintained below 5 mW at the location of the sample via neutral density filters. For the in situ Raman measurements, the laser line was directed into a reaction cell (Harrick Scientific Products Inc.) and relevant reaction mixture flow was provided via mass flow controllers (Alicat Scientific). To further secure temperature control and ensure thermal stability, only a very thin layer of sample was loaded into the sample holder of the Harrick cell. This helped us to avoid a large temperature gradient between the spot, where the thermocouple is located, and the surface of the sample. Collection of the scattered light was achieved with an air-cooled (−75 °C) open electrode 1024 × 256 pixel CCD. The acquisition time and the total number of accumulations were varied within the ranges of 5–20 s and 10–60, respectively.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were acquired with a JEM-2010F (JEOL, Japan) transmission electron microscope equipped with a field emission gun emitter.
For the H2-TPR measurements, 0.06 g of samples were loaded into a U-shaped reactor and pretreated with air at 600 °C to dehydrate the materials. The reactor was cooled down to 25 °C and flushed with pure Ar. The temperature of the reactor was then ramped up to 650 °C with a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 under a 40 mL min−1 flow of 2% H2 in Ar. The H2 consumption during the experiment was monitored by an online Cirrus 3 MKS mass spectrometer.
Catalytic studies
The catalytic performance of all the synthesized materials was evaluated with a continuous gas flow system through a quartz tube reactor (4 mm ID). Typically, 200 mg catalyst was diluted with 800 mg quartz sand before being loaded into the reactor. The reactor was placed inside a resistively heated ceramic furnace with external temperature control, and the catalyst bed temperature was measured with a K-type thermocouple placed in direct contact with the catalyst bed. The complete configuration of the experimental setup used can be found in our previous work. The reactor was then heated up to 600 °C in an air flow to ensure a fully oxidized state. The reactor was then flushed with a 50 mL min−1 flow containing pure nitrogen in 10 minutes to ensure that no O2 remained in the gas lines that could affect the initial time-on-stream data. A mixture of reactants, containing 5% C2H6, 5% CO2, and 90% N2, was then mixed and stabilized with by-pass before being fed into the reactor. Product analysis was performed via an in-line microGC (Agilent 490) equipped with an MS5A column (CH4, CO and H2) and PoraPlot Q column (CO2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, C3H8). Conversion of C2H6, selectivity to C2H4, and yield of C2H4 were calculated respectively as follows:

Results and discussion
Physicochemical characteristics and structural implications of surface species
The prepared CeO2–TiO2 supports were characterized via BET, Raman and UV-vis spectroscopy as well as XRD in an effort to identify the basic structural properties of pure and mixed oxides, before impregnation with the active phase; relevant results are shown in Table S1 and Fig. S1 of the ESI.† The BET surface area analysis of xCeTi samples showed that at low CeO2 content, a negligible difference was observed as compared to pure commercial titania (P25), while at higher CeO2 content an increase was observed. Even though XRD and Raman characterization techniques highlight anatase as the main phase present, the visible light absorbance measured in UV-vis spectroscopy revealed the presence of a second oxide. A closer look at the Raman and XRD results underscores that there is a gradual decrease in the crystallinity of the anatase phase in the support materials which is also responsible for the increased surface area upon increasing CeO2. Analysis of the XRD data shows that as more ceria was incorporated into the support, the crystallite size of the anatase phase is reduced. This observation is consistent with literature data concerning CeO2–TiO2 mixed oxides and has been ascribed to the prevention of agglomeration of anatase by ceria.27,30–32 In addition, the Raman spectra of all the pure mixed supports that were used did not show any vibrational bands characteristic of crystalline CeO2 nanoparticles, thus highlighting the relatively good dispersion of the CeOx component in the mixed phase.
Raman spectroscopic studies of dispersed molybdena species on common oxide supports and with different atomic density loadings have indicated that the MoOx saturation capacity is around 5–6 atoms per nm2.33 There is a wealth of information from in situ spectroscopic studies of supported metal oxides, highlighting the importance of characterizing those catalysts under dehydrated conditions to simulate the structure of catalysts under reaction conditions. Since strong structural changes occur upon temperature elevation34,35 (i.e. dehydration of surface species as well as dehydroxylation of the support36–38), the Raman spectra of deposited molybdenum oxides under dehydrated conditions were collected at 600 °C in the presence of air as shown in Fig. 1. The Raman spectra in Fig. 1 did not show any characteristic bands for crystalline MoO3, indicating that the catalysts have not exceeded the monolayer coverage. However, the high temperature Raman spectra shown in Fig. 1 can suffer from strong thermal broadening and thus the presence of possible MoO3 units may be difficult to identify. In Fig. S2,† we report the low temperature Raman spectra, i.e. at 100 °C and 200 °C, of representative supported molybdena catalysts. No crystalline MoO3 was identified since its most intense band at ∼820 cm−1 was absent in all the catalysts. However, upon addition of Mo onto the surface of the supports, the crystallite size of anatase slightly increased which is consistent with the observed surface area decrease.

The family of supported molybdena on prepared supports (Fig. 1a) exhibits a distinct peak at 996 cm−1. This peak represents the vibrational stretching mode of the molybdenyl double bond (MoO)33,38,39 from (MoOx)n dispersed species (Fig. 1b). In the open literature, authors have demonstrated that on TiO2, as the loading approaches the monolayer coverage, small polymeric Mo species can be formed; an associated shift of the MoO stretching mode of terminal oxygen to higher wavenumbers has been suggested.37,40 As more polymeric domains were formed, the band signifying mono-oxo molybdena shifted from 992 cm−1 to 995 cm−1 which is consistent with the frequencies of the stretching mode of the molybdenyl bond, shown in Fig. 1a. This argument is further strengthened in our loading dependent study, where low (1.5Mo per nm2) and high (5Mo per nm2) Mo content catalysts on P25 have been characterized via Raman (Fig. S3†). A slight shift from 993 cm−1 to 995 cm−1 is also observed which substantiates the hypothesis of possible oligomeric Mo species being present on P25 at high loadings.
Interestingly, a broad band at ∼930 cm−1, which was, however, insignificant in 5Mo/P25 and 5Mo/1CeTi, appeared to be strong in 5Mo/5CeTi and 5Mo/10CeTi catalysts. The assignment of this vibrational band has been debated in the open literature due to its inherent connection to catalytic reactivity implications. This band has been previously assigned in various characterization studies33,35,36,38,39,41–49 to the Mo–O–Mo functionalities of larger (MoOx)n polymeric domains of the dispersed phase. However, it is worth mentioning here that recent DFT and experimental50,51 studies on similar oxides (VOx and MoOx based) have shown that this band might arise also from contributions of anchoring bonds with the support, Mo–O–support, either from monomeric or oligomeric species. More details were also provided by a multiwavelength Raman approach on well controlled MoO3/Al2O3via ALD and/or impregnation synthesis methods where a broad band spanning the 850–950 cm−1 range (present also at low concentrations where no polymers are unlikely to be formed) was assigned to either Mo–O–Mo or more likely to Mo–O–Al. At higher loading though, there was a clear increase in the band located at 946 cm−1 that was distinctly assigned to the Mo–O–Mo asymmetric stretch, probably due to amorphous three-dimensional clusters, but not MoO3. In our loading dependent study of the molybdenum catalysts on the 5CeTi support (Fig. S3†), a similar increasing behavior in the intensity of the 930 cm−1 band was observed, supporting the argument of a larger contribution of Mo–O–Mo functionalities to this vibrational band. In the case of P25, increasing the molybdenum content led to a slight increase in a broad feature around 920–930 cm−1 which can be associated with a smaller degree of oligomeric units at 600 °C. A recent work52 shows by means of high resolution imaging that although oligomeric (MoOx)n species may be present at room temperature on the surface of TiO2, they undergo gradual dissociation at higher temperatures, resulting in a larger amount of monomeric units. This observation leads to the hypothesis that the presence of CeO2 in the TiO2 lattice may be responsible for the formation of larger Mo clusters on the catalyst surface.
To provide more insights into this hypothesis, in situ DRIFTS spectra have been acquired for the CeO2–TiO2 mixed oxides as well as the monolayer Mo-based catalyst on the 5CeTi support. Relevant results are shown in Fig. 2. Based on the available reported studies in the literature,53–56 the bands at 3642, 3695, 3673, 3718, and 3730 cm−1 are assigned to hydroxyl groups present on the TiO2 surface, while the bands at 3634, 3650, 3663, and 3688 cm−1 could be assigned to hydroxyl groups on the CeO2 surface. When Mo was deposited on the surface of the mixed oxide support, most of the bands originating from –OH groups on the titania surface, including the strongest band at 3718 cm−1, were absent in the DRIFT spectra, while many bands of the OH group from ceria including the strongest band at 3634 cm−1 could still be detected; however, some titration of the Ce–OH group is present as well, highlighting the possible anchoring of Mo species to Ce sites but to a much lower extent. This selective titration of the TiO2–OH groups on the surface of mixed oxide supports upon Mo addition in conjunction with the Raman and XRD results discussed above suggests that dispersed amorphous MoOx units preferentially (although not exclusively) anchor on the crystalline domains of TiO2. When ceria is dispersed into the support, the crystallite size and overall crystallinity of anatase TiO2 decrease, thus leaving a smaller free anatase surface area for molybdena to be anchored, which in turn promotes the formation of polymeric species. The possibility that changes in crystallinity upon CeO2 addition might also affect the dominant exposed facets thus promoting the formation of larger polymeric species with different apparent degrees of polymerization cannot be excluded. However, further studies via advanced microscopy characterization can provide invaluable insights into this research aspect.

Catalytic performance of supported MoOx systems and competing C2H6 conversion pathways
Preceding any discussion of the catalytic behavior of our supported catalysts, it is important to briefly discuss the catalytic reactivity of the bare supports, summarized in Fig. 3 and ESI.† P25 exhibited 11.5% ethane conversion with an initial ethylene selectivity of 82%. The addition of a small amount CeO2 into the mixed 1CeTi support did not cause any significant changes as compared to P25. Upon further increase of CeO2 content in the mixed support, both ethane conversion and ethylene selectivity decreased. This decrease is correlated with the decrease in TiO2 crystallinity observed by XRD and Raman with increased ceria content. Ceria may also be blocking some ethane dehydrogenation sites on the TiO2 surface while simultaneously altering the crystallinity; thus fewer active sites are present. It should be noted that other studies have shown an increase in reducibility when small ceria particles are dispersed in a mixed oxide system,57 and especially in TiO2-based systems.58 Furthermore, when ceria was used as a modifier and oxygen buffer, alkane overoxidation was enhanced.59 As the loss of ethylene selectivity was due to overoxidation to CO and CO2, the enhanced oxygen storage and oxygen mobility in high ceria loadings can explain the drop in selectivity.
Fig. 3 Initial conversion ethane and selectivity to ethylene over molybdenum oxide on different supports at 600 °C, under a 20 mL flow containing 5% C2H6, 5% CO2, and 90% N2.
The addition of dispersed MoOx on the surface of all the catalyst supports was evaluated and relevant results regarding their catalytic performance are also depicted in Fig. 3. Since no crystalline MoO3 was identified, any changes observed in the catalytic reactivity solely depend on the contribution of the amorphous MoOx units. The addition of molybdenum oxide enhanced the initial ethane conversion as compared to all the bare supports. This underscores that the presence of MoOx reactive sites on supports contributes to the excess ethane conversion. The initial selectivity to the desired olefin appeared to change with increasing CeO2 content in the support and a maximum selectivity to ethylene of 72% was measured for the 5Mo/5CeTi catalyst.
Due the existence of multiple proposed dehydrogenation mechanisms on metal oxide catalysts, the influence of each catalyst active site on the flux through different reaction pathways in CO2-assisted ODH is complex. The oxidative dehydrogenation pathway leads to water as a product (e.g.reaction 1), while pure dehydrogenation leads to H2 as a product (reaction 3).13,18,22,25,60 However, the amount of hydrogen in the reactor effluent is also influenced by the extent of reverse water-gas shift due to the presence of CO2 in the feed (reaction 4). Therefore, the relative amount of different species in the effluent can offer clues for the dominant pathways in play over a given catalyst, or under specific reaction conditions.
An added complication is that the oxidation state of the catalyst and/or support may vary as the reaction proceeds. For this reason, the initial reactivity, when the catalyst is still fully oxidized, can give insights into the intrinsic competitive behavior between direct dehydrogenation (DH) and ODH of ethane at the same active sites. Both the ethane and CO2 conversions are lower than the anticipated conversion as predicted from thermodynamic calculations6 underscoring that the results presented herein are far away from thermodynamic equilibrium. The fact that the CO2 conversion achieved in our experiments is low can help to establish a methodology for disentangling plausible simultaneous pathways for olefin production. At sufficiently low CO2 conversion (<5%), the extent of H2 consumption via RWGS is limited, so the ratio of hydrogen to ethylene in the reactor effluent can serve as an indicator for the relative contribution of DH and ODH of ethane reaction pathways. The CO2 conversion was very low within the first hour of time-on-stream, so initial rate data were suitable for this comparison. The ratio, γ,61 is defined at the reactor outlet as:
In the case where direct dehydrogenation (reaction 3) is the sole contributor to olefin formation, this ratio is expected to have a value equal to one. If one allows for additional side reactions such as C–C cracking or combustion of the olefin, the value may even exceed one. In contrast, the MvK mechanism for ODH (reactions 1–2) alone would result in a ratio equal to zero. Very recently, a similar ratio (namely Ftandem) by Stair and Notestein was introduced to explain the possibility of tandem H2 combustion in propane dehydrogenation.62
Fig. 4 depicts the effect of CeO2 addition on the γ ratio at early reaction times. Comparing the performance of the bare supports, it is observed that the γ ratio slightly increases with higher ceria content. This behavior indicates either higher direct dehydrogenation activity and/or the presence of side reactions such as overoxidation/combustion (see Table S3†).
Fig. 4 Initial ratio of produced H2 to produced C2H4 over 5Mo/xCeTi at 600 °C under a flow of 20 mL min−1 containing 5% C2H6, 5% CO2 and 90% N2.
In the case of Mo catalysts, the initial γ ratio of Mo/P25 was approximately 1 which, according to the definition of the γ ratio above, implies that ethane conversion may occur mainly through direct dehydrogenation. However, it is worth mentioning here that although the use of the γ ratio is to address competitive pathways, its value can be affected by the molar flow of both H2 and olefin. In the case of consecutive reactions, such as olefin overoxidation/combustion, the apparent value of the γ ratio will be affected by the intrinsic reactivity of the active sites towards the competitive combustion. For molybdena catalysts supported on pure TiO2, it has been previously shown that significant olefin overoxidation hampers the overall ethylene selectivity. This observation is also responsible for the increased value of the γ ratio for the Mo/P25 catalyst presented in this work, as compared to the bare P25.
On the other hand, when molybdena was deposited on the mixed CeO2–TiO2, the initial γ ratio dropped significantly to a value of ∼0.1 and varied little with CeO2 content. This significant shift indicated very low direct dehydrogenation and implies that all, or nearly all, of the ethane conversion occurs via oxidative dehydrogenation routes, once CeO2 is introduced into the support. The effect of COx on the γ ratio of molybdena catalysts on CeO2–TiO2 is minimal considering the almost constant selectivity to COx at similar ethane conversion. More specifically, for the case of the 5CeTi support, a Mo loading dependent study (see Fig. S4 of the ESI†) shows that this shift in the γ ratio is observed even at very low Mo content, underscoring the instant participation of Mo in ODH routes and that upon increasing loading, the presence of MvK pathways is even more pronounced.
The aforementioned effects of CeO2 content on the initial selectivity to ethylene as well as significant shift to ODH pathways over MoOx catalysts follow the trend observed in the intensity of the 930 cm−1 band of the fresh catalysts, underscoring a plausible underlying connection. Next, we focus our efforts on investigating possible structure–reactivity relationships by coupling catalytic measurements with in situ and operando Raman spectroscopy.
Dynamic in situ Raman spectra of supported MoOx catalysts' reduction with H2
C–H bond activation has been shown to occur on lattice oxygen species of supported metal oxides in the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism of oxidative dehydrogenation.42,43 On the contrary, a metallic interaction is crucial to break C–H bonds in the direct dehydrogenation mechanism over supported metal catalysts.4 In the present study, initial ethane conversion occurs mainly through direct participation of lattice oxygen over Mo, with the natural consequence of rapidly reducing the oxidation state of the active sites as lattice oxygen is removed. The time-on-stream dependence of the γ ratio presented in Fig. S7† shows that at long reaction times, the value of the γ ratio converged for all the Mo catalysts, indicating that due to deep reduction similar MoOx−n surface species across samples may exist.
Dynamic Raman spectroscopy was used to investigate the effect of CeO2 in the support on the redox properties of the dispersed active sites. The catalysts were reduced in 0.5% H2 at 600 °C, and the results of in situ Raman measurements are shown in Fig. 5a–d. Although the terminal MoO oxygen from molybdena species is hypothesized to be associated with non-selective combustion of ethane, changes in the intensity of this peak could still be utilized as an indicator of the overall material oxidation state. When exposed to hydrogen, the intensity of the 995 cm−1 peak of all the materials decreased with time, signifying reduction. The MoO intensities shown in Fig. 5 have been normalized with respect to the initial MoO of the fully oxidized catalyst. We find that the reduction behavior of the MoO peak follows the trend P25 < 1CeTi < 5CeTi. The spectroscopic signature of the MoO peak in the 5Mo/10CeTi sample could not be recorded by in situ Raman due to its very weak intensity (discussed above) in conjunction with the very rapid rate of reduction of this catalyst. This enhancement highlights a significant improvement in reducibility of supported molybdena on mixed ceria–titania as opposed to pure P25. Our results are consistent with H2 TPR studies, showing that ceria dispersed in titania improves the reducibility of mixed oxides.29,32 Here we show that the improvement in the redox properties of the support directly affects also the reducibility of the dispersed active phase, which in turn is expected to play a crucial role in ODH via MvK, considering that the removal of hydrogen from ethane and the release of water strongly depend on the reducibility of active sites.4,17,19

Reoxidation with CO2 Although CO2 is utilized as a mild oxidizing agent, whether it can effectively replenish the lattice oxygen lost in the MvK mechanism, especially for the Mo catalysts, remains an open question. Considering that the rapid oxygen depletion of surface species may be responsible for the initial catalyst deactivation (Fig. S5 and S6†), an effort was made to understand possible reoxidation of surface species with CO2.
An in situ Raman study (Fig. 6) was conducted where all the catalysts were initially reduced in 0.5% H2 and subsequently reoxidized with CO2. After reduction, neither the peaks that correspond to the terminal (MoO) nor bridging (Mo–O–M, MMo or support) were visible in the Raman spectra. In the presence of CO2, both of these peaks gradually increased with time, indicating that CO2 was indeed reoxidizing reduced surface sites. Interestingly, their intrinsic rates of reoxidation vary significantly with the catalyst support. The MoO intensities shown in Fig. 6 have been normalized with respect to the initial MoO of the fully oxidized catalyst, prior to any reduction. The normalized intensity of MoO (Fig. 6d) revealed that the rate of reoxidation is faster in catalysts with higher ceria content in the support. Despite this enhancement in the oxidation rate, the rate of reduction of Mo catalysts (discussed in Fig. 5d) was still an order of magnitude faster than reoxidation by CO2. It is worth mentioning here that for Mo catalysts with higher Ce content, i.e., 5Mo/5eTi, the intensity of the bridging bonds is recovered prior to that of the terminal bonds. We also report that even after 200 minutes of exposure to CO2, although the intensity of the bridging bonds is significantly recovered, their position appears to be around 920 cm−1, as opposed to the 930 cm−1 in fully oxidized (with O2) catalysts (see Fig. S9b†). Considering the highly overlapping nature of this band by different features (Mo–O–M, X = Mo or Support), we hypothesize that this red shift indicates that the CO2 treatment may not be able to recover all the polymeric Mo domains, thus leaving smaller Mo oligomers on the catalyst surface. As the population of bridging oxygen species decreased, polymeric domains of molybdena could be expected to divide and form smaller domains. These smaller domains of polymers were less electron withdrawing at each Mo site, causing the red shift of the bridging oxygen peak.63 The impact of this incomplete recovery (or reoxidation) by CO2 is shown in Fig. S9b,† where catalysts were regenerated by O2 and by CO2. This study showed that the catalysts could regain full activity with a negligible difference after being regenerated with O2, while regeneration with CO2 led to only partial recovery of the original activity.

Reaction conditions The effect of the improved redox behavior on the spectroscopic behavior of 5Mo/5CeTi under reaction conditions was studied next. In Fig. 7, we compare two cases where Raman spectra in the presence of ethane, without CO2 as well as in excess of CO2 in the feed, were collected. In both cases, the reduction of the terminal MoO bond was rapid and essentially identical. Although the general trend observed was similar to that when exposed to hydrogen (Fig. 5c), the overall reduction was slower when the reducing agent is ethane. Contrary to the MoO bond, the normalized bridging bonds appear to be significantly affected by the presence of CO2 in the feed; when excess CO2 was co-fed into the reactor, the bridging oxygen signal was depleted at a slower rate as opposed to that in the absence of CO2. A red shift from 930 cm−1 to 920 cm−1 was also observed which can be associated with a lower amount of polymeric MoOx species under reaction conditions.

The rapid depletion of lattice oxygen species observed by Raman spectroscopy together with the changes in the γ ratio with time-on-stream highlights the importance of the surface oxygen species on the ethane conversion pathways. However, it is important to mention here that the spectroscopic results of Fig. 6 and 7, although they support the catalytic reactivity discussed above, provide only a qualitative trend. Future directions by means of spectrokinetics64 where stepwise feed of reactants and simultaneous analysis of products is employed can help to provide information in a more quantitative manner.
As discussed above, the catalysts could regain full activity with a negligible difference after being regenerated with O2, while regeneration with CO2 led to only partial recovery of the original activity. As shown in the ESI,† the average carbon balance of all test reactions was approximately 98–99%. However, some carbon loss can be attributed to coke deposition. This is well justified in the present study via post-reaction Raman characterization of all the supports and molybdena catalysts presented in the ESI† (Fig. S9). In almost all the catalysts, Raman signatures of coke deposition are observed at 1345 cm−1 (D band) and at 1600 cm−1 (G band). However, although the neat supports present a high amount of coke, the molybdena-based catalysts show significantly fewer deposits. As shown also in Fig. 8a–d, comparing the fresh and post-reaction 5Mo5Ce/TiO2 catalysts, we observe that in both materials, well dispersed TiO2 clusters with a diameter ranging from 5–10 nm are maintained. Across all HRTEM images we have acquired, no CeO2 nor MoO3 crystalline structures have been observed, which is in line with our Raman and XRD results. After the reaction, although the particle size is slightly larger than the initial state, both CeO2 and MoO3 crystalline structures still were not observed. Across the large range of imaging area, no evidence of a significant layered structure of carbon has been observed, which is also consistent with the Raman results presented in this work. Although it is also expected that any carbonaceous species will be hard to fully oxidize, we show that excess of CO2 can help mitigate the extent of coke formation (Fig. 8b). One cannot exclude the possibility that CO2 might also react with the coke precursors, thus preserving the longer activity of the surface species. Further studies on investigating the lifetime of catalysts in time-on-stream experiments coupled with Raman measurements can shed more light on the coke formation mechanism among different catalysts.

Conclusions
Supported surface molybdena catalysts on pure P25 and mixed CeO2–TiO2, prepared by the sol–gel method, were catalytically evaluated for the CO2-assisted ODH of ethane. The reactivity data showed that the addition of molybdenum species enhanced the initial ethane conversion as compared to the bare supports. A maximum selectivity to ethylene of 72% was measured for the 5Mo/5CeTi catalyst. By analysis of the relative pathways for ethane conversion by means of the suggested γ ratio, we show that at a very early reaction time, ethylene is produced via a MvK type of mechanism while in pure supports via direct ethane dehydrogenation. At longer time-on-stream, a shift in ethane conversion pathways was observed which is associated with the depletion of reactive MoOx sites.
Through coupling Raman and DRIFTS characterization, it was shown that surface Mo species tend to anchor on the crystalline domains of anatase. The incorporation of ceria into the mixed oxide support improved significantly the redox properties of the catalyst system. The bridging bonds, as underscored by the presence of a broad band at 930 cm−1, appeared to be more robust in the presence of ethane and CO2, while the MoO was rapidly lost due to reduction under reaction conditions, irrespective of whether CO2 was present. In the absence of a reducing agent, CO2 was able to recover both the terminal and bridging molybdenum–oxygen signals in Raman (as seen also when oxidizing with O2), but the recovery of the bridging functionalities was to a much lesser extent under reaction conditions.
