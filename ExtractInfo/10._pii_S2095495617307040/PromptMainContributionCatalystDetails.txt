AbstractAbstract
Three different regeneration processes including hydrogen or nitrogen purging and coke-burning treatment were used to restore the Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, through which propane dehydrogenation reaction was performed in a consecutive reaction-regeneration mode. It was found that the catalyst using hydrogen regeneration showed the best stability compared with those regenerated by nitrogen purging and coke-burning treatment, suggesting that hydrogen regeneration is an effective approach for maintaining the performance of Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The effect of different regeneration atmospheres on the metal active center and the coke deposition was investigated by XRD, TEM, N2-physisorption, TPO, TG and Raman technologies, and the results revealed that hydrogen or nitrogen regeneration resulted in little impact on the size and structure of metal active center, retaining the effective PtSn phase over the catalyst. Moreover, hydrogen regeneration not only removed the low dense components of the coke, but also altered the property of the residual coke through hydrogenation, leading to a higher mobility of coke, and thus a higher accessibility of the metal active centers. Whereas nitrogen regeneration only removed the low dense components of the coke. Although coke-burning regeneration caused a thorough coke removal, the catalyst subjected to repeated redox exhibited poor stability due to metal agglomeration, phase segregation and the resulting large Pt3Sn particle and core-shell structure with a Sn-rich surface.

1. Introduction
Due to the growing demand of propylene as an important base chemical intermediate in the past few years, the conventional production processes including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking are difficult to fulfill the shortfall of propylene supply. As a result, the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has been extensively studied and applied as an alternative route for producing propylene [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Platinum-based and chromium-based catalysts are the most widely used in propane dehydrogenation reaction. Compared with Cr-based catalysts, Pt-based catalysts display higher activity and more environment-friendly property, and thus drawing more attention. Similar to the case of Pt-based catalysts in other paraffin dehydrogenation reactions, the major issue of Pt-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is rapid deactivation, which is caused by coke formation and metal agglomeration [9], [10], [11]. Hence, many efforts have been devoted to enhancing the catalytic stability of Pt-based catalysts, such as improving reaction process [3], [12], adding promoters [4], [5], [9], [13], [14], [15], modifying supports [6], [16], [17] or preparation methods [7], [8], [11]. So far, adding Sn is the most common approach to inhibit metal sintering and suppress coke formation, as well as to increase propylene selectivity by forming an alloy with Pt under reaction conditions.
However, all studies indicate that the coke deposition and gradual deactivation of Pt-based catalysts in propane dehydrogenation is inevitable, so periodic catalyst regeneration is necessary for achieving a sufficient total lifetime. To remove the coke, catalysts are generally regenerated under oxidizing or oxychlorination conditions followed by H2 reduction [10], [17], [18], [19]. Besides air or oxygen, steam was also used as an oxidizing regeneration atmosphere [20]. Nevertheless, regeneration with oxidizing conditions may not fully restore catalytic performance, leading to an irreversible damage of the catalyst structure and eventual loss of activity and selectivity in consecutive cycles [10], [19]. In our previous study, we have found that hydrogen regeneration can effectively remove coke in methane dehydroamromatization [21]. Moreover, avoiding the introduction of oxidizing components results in simpler operation and greater security. Therefore, in this work, we used hydrogen to regenerate Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts and performed propane dehydrogenation reaction through consecutive reaction-regeneration cycles. Other two different regeneration modes including nitrogen purging and coke-burning treatment were also carried out for comparison. The effect of regeneration modes on the coke deposition and the metal active center was investigated by XRD, N2-physisorption, TPO, TG, Raman and TEM technologies.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by co-impregnation method. Briefly, a certain amount of H2PtCl6 and SnCl2 aqueous solution were dispersed over the calcined γ-Al2O3 support. The mixture was dried by rotary evaporator at 50 °C for 100 min after stirring well, followed by drying in an oven at 120 °C overnight. Finally, the catalysts were calcined in the muffle at 550 °C for 4 h and then pressed into pellets with 60−80 mesh. The mole ratio of Pt to Sn was controlled at 1:0, 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:3, respectively, where Pt content was fixed to 2 wt%. The final catalyst was marked by weight percentage, which was denoted as 2Pt/Al, 2Pt-0.6Sn/Al, 2Pt-1.2Sn/Al, 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al and 2Pt-3.6Sn/Al, respectively.
2.2. Characterizations
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) measurement was conducted on D-MAX 2200 coupled with copper anode tube using a Kα radiation. The 2θ angle was scanned from 10° to 90 ° at a rate of 5 °/min.
Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherm was recorded at 77 K on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. The sample was degassed at 250 °C for 6 h before the measurement. The surface area was determined by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The pore size was calculated based on the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model.
Thermo gravimetric (TG) analysis was performed at NETZSCH STA 409PC Analyzer. The spent catalyst was heated in 60 mL/min air from room temperature to 800 °C at a temperature ramp of 10 °C/min.
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) of the spent catalysts was carried out on a Hiden Catlab equipped with a QGA mass spectrometer. The spent catalyst (30 mg) was pretreated by 40 mL/min Ar at 150 °C for 2 h and cooled down to 40 °C before TPO analysis. The sample was then heated from 40 to 700 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min in a 40 mL/min of 20 vol% O2/Ar flow. The effluent was monitored by recording the intensities of m/e = 44, 28, and 18, and the amounts of CO, CO2, and H2O were calculated accordingly. A fragment of CO2 which contributed to the signal of m/e = 28 (CO) was subtracted from the total intensity at m/e = 28 (CO) to get the actual amount of CO. The amount of coke was given by the sum of CO and CO2, and the H/C mole ratio was derived from the relative amounts of H2O, CO, and CO2.
Raman analysis was conducted under ambient atmosphere on a LabRAM HR 800 UV Laser Raman Spectroscopy with a 632.8 nm laser beam. Raman spectrum was recorded with an exposure time of 20 s and 2 accumulations.
Electron microscope analysis was taken on an FEI Tecnai G2 F30 using high-angle annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) mode and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) mode. The fresh catalyst after pre-reduction and passivation or the spent catalysts were rapidly collected and dispersed in ethanol. The sample was prepared by dropping ultrasonically dispersing ethanol suspension onto carbon-coated copper grids for analysis.
2.3. Catalytic test
Propane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out in a conventional fixed-bed reactor. The catalyst (200 mg) was loaded in a quartz tube. The sample was in-situ pre-reduced under a 50 mL/min of 10 vol% H2/N2 at 540 °C for 2 h. After reduction, the reaction gas mixture was introduced into the system. The gas mixture was composed of C3H8, H2 and N2 with a molar ratio of 3:1:21 under ambient pressure and the gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was 15,000 mL/(gcat h). The outlet gas composition was analyzed by an online Agilent 7890A gas chromatography equipped with an FID and HP-PlotAl2O3/S capillary column. Propane conversion and propylene selectivity is defined as follows:
where [C3H8], [C3H6], [C2H6], [C2H4], [CH4], [C4], and [C6] refer to the concentration of outlet gas component. Almost no heavy component more than six carbon (C6+) could be detected. Note, coke on the catalysts was not included in the calculation of conversion and selectivity. Thus the realistic propane conversion is slightly higher and propylene selectivity is slightly lower than the values given by the above equations. However, based on TG analysis, the average coke selectivity during a running of 8 h under our operation condition is generally no more than 1%, so the above equations are acceptable. The deactivation parameter (De) of catalysts is calculated by the follow formula:
where X0 and Xf refer to the initial and the final conversion, respectively.
Periodic reaction-regeneration cycles were performed through in-situ regeneration of the spent catalyst. Three different regeneration modes including hydrogen or nitrogen purging and coke-burning treatment were used to recover the catalysts. For convenient operation, the same regeneration temperature was chosen as the reaction temperature to avoid the temperature mismatch. In a typical procedure, regeneration gas, i.e., H2, N2 or 5 vol% O2/N2-10 vol% H2/N2 (represented as Redox), was periodically introduced at a flow rate of 50 mL/min after each reaction cycle of 8 h. For H2 or N2 regeneration, a purging of 2 h was employed. Whereas for redox regeneration, the spent catalyst was oxidized at 540 °C for 1 h under 5 vol% O2/N2, and then reduced at 540 °C for 1 h under 10 vol% H2/N2 atmosphere. Both before and after oxidation treatment, a N2 purging of short duration was required. After eleven consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, the catalyst was collected for further analysis, which was denoted as 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-H2, 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N2 and 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox, respectively. For the sake of contrast, the catalyst after one period of reaction (represented as 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-8 h) and after one reaction-regeneration cycle (represented as 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-H2-1, 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N2-1 and 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox-1, respectively) were also collected for subsequent characterization.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Optimization of preparation and reaction parameters
Before running reaction-regeneration experiment to explore the influence of different regeneration modes on the catalytic performance of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts, a suitable catalyst with high activity, selectivity and good stability, as well as an optimal reaction condition is required. Thus a series of preparation and reaction conditions were examined, including the ratio of Pt to Sn, calcination temperature, pre-reduction temperature and the ratio of C3H8 to H2 in feed gas. Fig. 1 demonstrates the time dependences of propane conversion and propylene selectivity over Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts with different Pt/Sn ratios. The detailed data concerning other preparation and reaction conditions are not given here.

As shown in Fig. 1, all catalysts exhibited a gradual decrease of propane conversion with an increase of propylene selectivity during the whole reaction course, and this trend was more pronounced on 2Pt/Al monometallic catalyst, which exhibited the highest initial conversion and the lowest propylene selectivity. Compared with the monometallic catalyst, the bimetallic catalysts with Sn doping showed higher selectivity and better stability. After 8 h of reaction, only slight decrease of propane conversion over bimetallic catalysts could be observed. This indicated the promotional effect of Sn doping, as widely reported previously [10], [16], [22]. The deactivation parameter (De, listed in Table 1) can provide the quantitative result on the level of deactivation. As Sn content rose, De value dropped. While Sn content exceeded 2.4 wt%, De value was almost unchanged. Accordingly, 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al (i.e., Pt/Sn mole ratio is 1/2) was chosen as the catalyst for periodic reaction-regeneration operation.

3.2. Periodic reaction-regeneration test
The catalytic performances of 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al catalysts during periodic reaction-regeneration cycles using different regeneration modes are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 2. In almost all the reaction stage, the propylene selectivity over the catalyst regenerated by Redox was higher than those over the catalyst regenerated by H2 or N2. But the difference was very small, all selectivity was beyond 98%. After eleven consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, the propane conversions over the catalysts regenerated by H2, N2 and Redox decreased from about 43% to 33%, 26.9% and 12.8%, respectively, corresponding to De value of 23.5%, 37.6% and 70.3%. Obviously, the catalyst regenerated by Redox exhibited poor stability. This is in accordance with the phenomenon that regeneration atmosphere containing O2 lead to fast deactivation of the catalyst, reported by Pham et al. [19], Sattler et al. [22] and Vu et al. [23]. As expected, the catalyst using hydrogen regeneration showed the best stability compared with those regenerated by N2 and Redox, suggesting that hydrogen regeneration is an effective approach for maintaining the performance of Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reaction.

Both before and after oxidation treatment, a N2 purging of short duration was required.

3.3. Effect of regeneration modes on metal active center
To gain insights into the reasons behind the different catalytic performance of 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al resulting from different regeneration modes, we conducted electron microscope to investigate the effect of regeneration modes on metal active center. HAADF-STEM images and corresponding metal particle size distributions of the fresh and used catalysts are shown in Fig. 3. For the fresh catalyst, an average particle size of about 12.7 nm could be observed. After eleven consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, the average particle size of the catalyst regenerated by H2 and N2 both slightly increased to about 13.4 nm, indicating that no significant sintering emerged. Whereas for the catalyst regenerated by Redox, the average particle size increased to 17.1 nm. Although Sn doping can inhibit metal sintering, severe conditions such as repeated redox regeneration indeed lead to metal agglomeration, as suggested by the previous reports [10], [19].

(a) 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-fresh, (b) 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-H2, (c) 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N2 and (d) 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox stand for the fresh catalyst and used ones after eleven consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles, which was respectively regenerated by H2, N2 or Redox.
Besides the agglomeration and growing up of metal particles, the phase transition of Pt-Sn alloy also plays an important role in affecting catalytic performance. Previous study demonstrated that the stability of supported Pt-Sn catalyst depends on the type of Pt-Sn alloy, where PtSn phase is more effective than Pt3Sn phase for propane dehydrogenation [24]. So XRD and HRTEM were conducted to analyze the phase transition of Pt-Sn alloy.
Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of the fresh catalyst and the used ones regenerated under different conditions. For the fresh catalyst, the diffraction peaks attributed to the metallic Pt (PDF NO. 65-2868), alloyed PtSn (PDF NO. 65-0959) and Pt3Sn (PDF NO. 65-0958) could be identified from the XRD patterns, as marked by different signs, although the diffraction peaks of Pt and Pt3Sn overlapped into one asymmetric peak due to very adjacent position. When the catalyst was subjected to repeated regeneration by Redox, the Pt3Sn diffraction is predominant over 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox, indicating that not only metal agglomeration but also phase transition to Pt3Sn occur. Pham et al. [19] also observed large Pt3Sn particles after multiple coke-burning regeneration. On the other side, when the catalyst was subjected to repeated regeneration by H2 or N2, the (1 1 1) diffraction of Pt3Sn attenuated, whereas the relative intensity of PtSn diffraction increased.

XRD patterns of the fresh and used catalysts. 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-fresh stands for the fresh catalyst; 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-H2, 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N2 and 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox stand for the used catalysts, which were respectively regenerated by H2, N2 and Redox during eleven consecutive dehydrogenation-regeneration cycles.
Fig. 5 shows the HRTEM images of the fresh catalyst and the used ones regenerated under different conditions. Unlike the XRD results, it could be found from HRTEM that PtSn phase was predominant over 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-fresh, 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-H2 and 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N2, which was identified by characteristic lattice spacing of about 0.216 nm indexed to PtSn (1 0 2) or 0.296 nm indexed to PtSn (1 0 1). While Pt and Pt3Sn were scarce, which was identified by lattice spacing of about 0.225 nm indexed to Pt (1 1 1), 0.285 nm indexed to Pt3Sn (1 1 0) or characteristic diffraction spot in FT image. This discrepancy between XRD and HRTEM is most likely related to lack of long range order for PtSn alloy, which was formed by gradual penetration of Sn into metallic Pt lattice to Pt/Sn ratio of 1. So the diffraction intensity of PtSn in XRD was weak, but PtSn is the main alloy phase over 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Fresh, 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-H2 and 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N2, as shown in HRTEM. It should be noted that 10−15 HRTEM images were taken at random for each samples to ensure the representativeness, only a small part was presented in Fig. 5. For 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox, large Pt3Sn particles arose, in agreement with the XRD result. Additionally, a core-shell structure originated form phase segregation could be clearly observed on 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox. The distinguishable lattice spacing of 0.208 or 0.187 nm in the shell region ascribed to Sn (2 2 0) or (3 1 0) suggests that metal Sn possibly constituted the shell. This Sn encapsulation inhibited the dehydrogenation activity of the core-shell structure. Vázquez-Zavala et al. [25] reported similar core-shell structure of metal particles over supported Pt-Sn catalysts, where Sn, PtSn2 or PtSn4 constituted the Sn-rich surface.

Based on the results of HAADF-STEM, XRD and HRTEM, it can be suggested that using H2 or N2 regeneration resulted in little impact on the size and structure of metal active center, retaining the effective PtSn phase. Whereas using Redox regeneration led to metal agglomeration and phase segregation, forming large Pt3Sn particle and core-shell structure with a Sn-rich surface. These observations on metal active center can explain why the catalyst regenerated by Redox displayed poor catalytic performance, but no remarkable difference concerning metal center could be found between H2 and N2 regeneration. Thus, coke deposition, another critical factor responsible for catalytic stability, requires investigation.
3.4. Effect of regeneration modes on the coke deposition
Table 3 lists the textural properties of the support and catalysts. After loading Pt-Sn, the surface area and pore volume of 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-fresh decreased compared with those of Al2O3 support, indicating that metal particles partially blocked the pores derived from Al2O3 support. Multiple reaction-regeneration operations using H2 or N2 as regeneration atmosphere resulted in a much lower pore volume, while 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox displayed a similar, even slightly higher pore volume compared with the fresh catalyst. Different regeneration modes caused the variation of pore volume. This can be explained by coke analysis, as shown in Table 4. TG measurements suggested that about 10% coke deposited on 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-H2 or 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N2, further blocked the pores of Al2O3 support. While no coke could be detected on 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-Redox, showing that the catalyst regenerated by Redox was subjected to thorough removal of coke, and thus the pore volume restored.

2.4Sn/Al-H2 and 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N2 with the similar coke amount exhibited different performances in propane dehydrogenation, indicating that the amount of coke deposited on catalysts does not correlate with the loss in reactivity, as previously reported [19], [21]. Thus, TPO measurements were conducted to further investigate the coke deposition. Fig. 6 shows the TPO profiles of the spent catalysts, and the corresponding quantitative results are also summarized in Table 4. All coke amounts obtained from TPO are consistent with the TG results. The catalysts regenerated by Redox have no TPO peaks due to thorough coke burning.

For 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-8 h, the catalyst after a reaction of 8 h without regeneration, one major high-temperature peak centered at about 400 °C and one low-temperature shoulder around 280 °C could be observed. As well known, the relative position of TPO peaks is highly associated with the intrinsic property and the location of the coke deposited on catalysts. The coke with high H content or close to metal sites is easy to be oxidized at lower temperatures, while the coke with low H content or far from metal sites needs higher oxidation temperatures. In a similar system, Li et al. [26] proposed that the TPO peak locating in the interval of 150−280 °C and 380−430 °C could be attributed to the combustion of coke deposited on the metal and on the support, respectively. When this catalyst was regenerated by N2, the low-temperature peak for 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N2-1 significantly decreased, indicating that considerable carbonaceous species adsorbed or deposited on the metal sites was removed. It is obvious that these carbonaceous species should be volatile and less dense, because they could be removed by N2 purging.
However, H2 purging resulted in an additional effect, not only light adsorbed species was removed, as demonstrated by the analogous decrease of low-temperature peak, but the property of coke was also altered. This was confirmed by the C/H ratio analysis. In contrast to without regeneration (C/H ratio of 2.36), N2 purging resulted in a higher C/H ratio of 2.56 due to the removal of less dense coke with high H content, whereas H2 purging resulted in a lower C/H ratio of 2.15. Although light adsorbed species containing more H was also removed by H2 purging, the resulting coke deposition over 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-H2-1 still possessed the lower C/H ratio, showing that hydrogenation of the coke occurred. According to the literatures reported by Li et al. [26] and Srihiranpullop et al. [27], the coke formed on the metal can be further softened to less dense through hydrogenation. This coke with higher H content presents higher mobility. It is most likely that the stubborn coke on or beside the metal sites, which has great impact on the catalytic performance, would be transformed by hydrogenation to get fluidity, migrating away from the metal sites to the support or becoming a more loose attachment to the metal sites. This transformation of the coke could enhance the accessibility of the metal active centers and reduce the restriction of reactant adsorption and product desorption. As a result, the catalyst regenerated by H2 presented more stability. An additional evidence also reflects that hydrogenation caused higher mobility of the coke. It could be found that a minor TPO peak emerged at 550 °C only over the catalyst regenerated by H2, which might be ascribed to the coke migrating deep into the pore of support, leading to a higher oxidation temperature due to more difficult diffusion of oxygen.
After multiple reaction-regeneration, the catalysts regenerated by H2 and N2 deposited more coke, and both C/H ratios increased compared with their counterparts after one cycle of reaction-regeneration. This is because of further condensation of the coke at relatively high temperatures in long-term operation. In contrast with 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N2 with a higher C/H ratio of 4.64, the hydrogenated 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-H2 has a relatively lower C/H ratio of 3.66, and thus presenting a temperature decrease of about 10 °C on the major coke combustion peak, as shown in Fig. 6(b).
Raman measurements were also conducted to explore the structural property of coke, as shown in Fig. 7. For all the catalysts containing coke, two distinct peaks can be observed around 1320 cm−1 (D band) and 1587 cm−1 (G band), generally ascribed to the disordered graphitic lattice and ideal graphitic lattice, respectively. The ratio of ID/IG (listed in Table 4) is regarded as an index for the crystalline order of graphite, or the graphitization degree of carbon materials, i.e., higher ID/IG ratio represents more structural defects of graphitic lattice, or lower graphitization degree, lower size of graphitic crystallites [22], [28], [29], [30]. Obviously, more defects and lower graphitization degree of the coke should imply higher H content. As expected, for the catalysts after one cycle of reaction or reaction-regeneration, the ID/IG ratios are in the following order: 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N2-1 < 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-8 h < 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-H2-1, in accordance with the order of H content, a reverse order of C/H ratio obtained by TPO analysis. Moreover, similar correspondence of ID/IG and C/H ratios can also be observed on the catalysts after multiple reaction-regeneration. However, a seeming contradiction arose from comparing the ID/IG and C/H ratios on all the catalysts. For 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-H2 and 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N2, it seems that the ID/IG ratios should be much lower than that of 2Pt-2.4Sn/Al-N2-1 because they have two relatively higher C/H ratios. One possible explanation is that the ID/IG ratio obtained from Raman spectrum mainly reflects the near surface property of the coke deposited on the catalyst after multiple reaction-regeneration, i.e., the coke forming in the last one cycle maybe contributed the most to the ID/IG, while the C/H ratio obtained from TPO always reflects the whole property of the coke. Nevertheless, the Raman can still provide valuable information by comparing the catalysts subjected to similar coking process.

4. Conclusions
Propane dehydrogenation reaction over Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts was performed through consecutive reaction-regeneration cycles, where different regeneration modes including hydrogen or nitrogen purging and coke-burning treatment were used to restore the catalysts. It was found that the catalyst using hydrogen regeneration showed the best stability compared with those regenerated by nitrogen purging and coke-burning treatment, suggesting that hydrogen regeneration is an effective approach for maintaining the performance of Pt-Sn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts in propane dehydrogenation reaction. The characterization results demonstrated that using hydrogen or nitrogen regeneration resulted in little impact on the size and structure of metal active center, retaining the effective PtSn phase over the catalyst. Moreover, hydrogen regeneration not only removed the low dense components of the coke, but also altered the property of the residual coke through hydrogenation, leading to a higher mobility of coke, and thus a higher accessibility of the metal active centers. Whereas nitrogen regeneration only removed the low dense components of the coke. Although coke-burning regeneration caused a thorough coke removal, the catalyst subjected to repeated redox exhibited poor stability due to metal agglomeration, phase segregation and the resulting large Pt3Sn particle and core-shell structure with a Sn-rich surface.
