Propane Dehydrogenation on Chromia/Silica and Chromia/Alumina Catalysts
Abstract
The catalytic activity of CrOx/SiO2 (SC, 0.08 to 0.99% chromium by weight), CrOx/Al2O3 (AC, 0.16 to 1.55%), and α-Cr2O3 for the dehydrogenation of propane has been investigated at 723 to 823 K in a flow apparatus. Before catalytic experiments, SC and AC samples were activated with oxygen at 773 K (s.o. treatment) followed or not followed by reduction with CO or H2 at 623 K. Occasionally, SC samples were dehydrated under vacuum at 1023 K before the s.o. treatment. Assuming all chromium to be in the +6 state after s.o., the average oxidation number of chromium (
) is
≍ 2 in SC samples reduced with CO and
≍ 3 with H2. In AC catalysts,
values progressively increase in consecutive reduction experiments, from
= 2.2 to
= 4.2. All catalysts are highly selective to propene and undergo a deactivation process during time on stream. The s.o. treatment completely restores the activity. The reduction mode does not influence the catalytic activity. Surface species formed upon adsorption at room temperature (RT) of CO or NO were studied by IR spectroscopy on CrOx/SiO2 submitted to treatments analogous to those used before catalytic experiments. In SC catalysts reduced with CO, the formation of carbonyls and nitrosyls of three different CrII species was confirmed. Interestingly, all these species were absent when the sample was (i) reduced with H2 at 773 K, or (ii) heated with H2O after reduction with CO, or (iii) exposed to propane after reduction with either CO or H2. After treatments (i) through (iii), a carbonyl and a dinitrosyl of CrIII were the only species formed on CO or NO adsorption at RT. Relying on (i) the dependence of the activity on chromium content, (ii) IR results. and (iii) ESR data, it is suggested that mononuclear CrIII with two coordinative vacancies is the active site for the dehydrogenation of propane. The catalytic activity of CrOx/SiO2, CrOx/Al2O3, and α-Cr2O3 is compared with that of CrOx/ZrO2, measured previously. Possible reasons for the substantially higher activity of CrOx/ZrO2 are discussed.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
