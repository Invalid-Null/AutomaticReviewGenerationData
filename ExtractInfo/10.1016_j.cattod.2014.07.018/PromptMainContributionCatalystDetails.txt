1. Introduction
Propane is currently considered promising feedstock for producing propylene, and advanced technologies have been developing for the selective conversion of propane to propene [1], [2]. Dehydrogenation is an endothermic reaction and usually needs a very high temperature. The addition of an oxidant to the feed allows this difficulty to be overcome; not only the process becomes exothermic and proceeds at a much lower temperature but the oxidative conditions simultaneously diminish coke deposition [3]. The course of the oxidative dehydrogenation depends on the nature of oxidant, and rather good results were obtained with the use of N2O [4] and CO2 [5]. However, there are serious drawbacks of usual oxidants. For example, metal oxides need regeneration, N2O is expensive, but CO2 is low active. Such an attractive oxidant as molecular oxygen also requires high temperature for the process to proceed with appreciable rate and results in a pronounced further oxidation of propene.
One of the ways to overcome this difficulty is to use O2 in combination with reductant. In particular, the addition of H2 to the feed provides high reactivity for O2 at a low temperature and has been successfully used in such processes as hydroxylation of benzene [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], epoxidation of olefins [12], [13] and oxidation of alkanes [14], [15], [16], [17]. Analogously to peroxide, the O2 + H2 mixture allowed propane to be converted into propyl alcohols, acetone and propanal [18], [19], [20], and peroxide intermediates were found responsible for the selective oxidation of light alkanes [16], [20]. Bravo-Suarez et al. [21] have recently carried out propane epoxidation by combining propane dehydrogenation–propylene epoxidation steps and using a two-catalyst bed and H2 + O2 as the oxidant mixture. The Au/TiO2 catalyst, which they used to generate propene, was capable of working at a low temperature (443 K) and providing selectivity to propene up to 70% at a propane conversion of 1.4%.
In the present work we evaluated applicability of bi-functional catalysts which contain both red-ox sites (to activate oxygen and oxidize propane) and acid sites for dehydration of alcohol intermediates. Silica-supported Pt catalysts modified with H3PMo12O40 heteropoly acid (HPA) have been tested. Such catalysts have previously demonstrated good performance in oxidation of benzene (in solution [22] and vapor phase [23]) and light alkanes [24]. The purpose of the study was to identify the state and the role of separate components of the catalysts and to improve the catalyst efficiency with the aid of promoters and operating conditions.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The catalyst samples were prepared through simultaneous or successive impregnation of the support with solutions of H2PtCl6, H3PMo12O40, H3PO4, HAuCl4 or AgNO3 (Table 1). If simultaneous impregnation was intended, the support was impregnated with a fresh solution containing H2PtCl6, H3PMo12O40 and H3PO4 acids in required proportion. The resulting samples were dried, calcined in air (2 h at 100 °C, 2 h at 450 °C) and treated in H2 flow at 300 °C for 1 h. The successive impregnations started from a Pt/SiO2 sample which was preliminary treated in air and H2 under the same conditions as specified above. It could then be impregnated with a solution of HAuCl4 or AgNO3 and the treatments repeated. Finally, impregnation was made with a fresh solution of H3PMo12O40 or H3PMo12O40 and H3PO4, followed by drying in air at 100 °C. In the text, the catalyst samples are designated as xPtAg(Au)yHPAzPA, where HPA and PA stand for H3PMo12O40 and H3PO4, respectively, and x, y, z for wt.% of Pt, HPA, and PA, respectively. Catalyst composition was checked by XRF analysis.

H3PMo12O40 heteropoly acid was purified by ether extraction; other reagents were of a reagent or analytical grade and were used as supplied. If not specified otherwise, commercial silica (KSK, native source, with BET surface area (SBET) 260 m2 g−1, pore volume 0.84 cm3 g−1, average pore diameter 126 Å, and particle size 0.2–0.5 mm) was mainly used as the catalyst support. For comparison, TiO2 (predominantly anatase, SBET 350 m2 g−1, particle size 0.2–0.5 mm) and γ-Al2O3 (SBET 300 m2 g−1, particle size 0.2–0.5 mm) were also used.
2.2. Catalysts characterization
XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectra) of preliminary crushed samples were recorded with an ES-300 (Kratos Analytical) spectrometer using Mg anode radiation (hν = 1253.6 eV) under fixed transmission mode. Intensities of the Pt4f, Mo3d and Si2p signals were used for calculation of the atomic composition at the catalyst surface.
HAADF-STEM (High Angle Annular Dark Field Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy), EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) and elemental mapping were made with a JEM-2200FS (JEOL) microscope. Suspension of the catalyst in hexane was deposited on carbon-film-coated copper grids. The elemental maps were obtained on MoL (E = 2.29 keV) and PtL (E = 9.44 keV).
2.3. Catalytic testing, product analysis, and calculations
A detailed scheme of the reaction set-up can be found in Supplementary Information (SI, Fig. S1). The catalytic process was conducted with the use of a fixed-bed quartz flow reactor (Fig. S2) mounted inside a heating furnace. To ensure uniform gas flow and prevent overheating, catalyst samples were diluted with quartz to 4 ml of total volume and placed into cylindrical part of the reactor (5 ml in volume, i.d. 8 mm). A thin quartz tube was inserted into the catalyst bed to measure the temperature, the thermocouple being placed in the center of catalyst bed. The gas feed was composed of propane (99.94% purity), O2, H2, and N2, which were dosed by mass flow controllers at ambient pressure. If no variation of the feed composition was intended, a preliminarily mixed (in a cylinder) propane, H2, and N2 were used, but O2 was added with an independent mass flow controller. All catalysts were pretreated in situ in flowing air (100 ml min−1, 200 °C, 1 h), and then the flow was switched from the air to C3H8/O2/H2/N2 mixture. The first experimental points were usually collected 1 h after directing the propane-containing feed to the reactor, as the catalysts practically reached a steady state for that time, and the experiment continued for 5–10 h to evaluate the catalyst performance sufficiently in detail.
The composition of the inlet feed and resulting product mixture was checked/determined with on-line gas chromatography (GC), using 4 columns: (1) Porapak T (TCD), which allowed separation of CH2O, CO2, (C3H8 + C3H6), H2O, C2H5CHO, C2H3CHO, CH3COCH3, 1-C3H7OH, 2-C3H7OH, HCOOH, and CH3COOH; (2) Porapak Q (TCD or FID) for C3-carboxylic acids (C2H5COOH, C2H3COOH, C2H5COOH), as well as for possible C4–C6 oxygenates; (3) activated Al2O3 (TCD or FID), which made it possible to separate C3H8 and C3H6 and also control the possible presence of CH4, C2H6, C2H4, and higher hydrocarbons; (4) molecular sieves (TCD) for H2, O2, CO. One can find examples of chromatograms in SI (Fig. S3). Identification of products was based on their retention times, individual compounds being used for reference and to determine response factors. For verification, GC–MS (with a ZB-WAX column) has also been used.
During catalytic testing, the gaseous product mixtures were directed to chromatograph through heated capillaries. To have confidence that all products were correctly detected under such conditions, their accumulation in a trap cooled to −40 °C was made from time to time, and the results showed good correspondence. Analysis of both the gaseous mixtures and condensate showed that C4 and heavier products, if present, were in negligible amounts, at least, at the conditions used in the main experiments (reaction temperature of 200 °C and catalyst at the steady state). The absence of high-boiling products and the stability of catalyst performance with time-on-stream made it possible to precisely estimate the propane conversion (C) through the amounts of products formed and to correctly calculate the selectivities (S) in spite of the usually low conversions of the organic substrate.
The chromatographic analysis with Porapak T and TCD (Fig. S3a) enabled the amounts of CO2 and almost all other by-products to be determined relatively to the combined amount of C3H6 and C3H8 (appeared as one peak in the given case). The yields of the side products could thus be determined with the use of a single chromatographic column, and this increased the precision. In its turn, the C3H8/C3H6 ratio in the effluent could be easily found with the Al2O3 column, which afforded excellent separation of these hydrocarbons (Fig. S3b) without interference from oxygen-containing products. The propane conversion could thus be easily calculated by formula:
(1)
where
and
stand for mol percentages of propene and propane in the product mixture and Mi,n for mol percentages of oxygen-containing products with n number of atoms in molecule. During catalytic testing, several chromatograms with different columns were obtained for each catalyst, and the data corresponding to steady state were averaged.
In the text, selectivities (S) to products with n carbon atoms in molecule are presented in terms of carbon efficiencies:
(2)
In particular, the selectivity to the targeted product was calculated by formula:
(3)
In view of the large number of oxygen-containing compounds in the product mixture, their summarized yield could vary up to ±10 rel.% in the calculations from repeated chromatograms, and such an uncertainty in the value of ∑(Mi,n n−1) in Eq. (3) might be reflected in correctness of
value. However, the yield of the oxygen-containing products was usually much less than that for propene, and about half the ∑(Mi,n n−1) value was related to CO2. The confidence interval for the SC3H6 values reported below can be considered to be ±1.5 rel.% or better.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Properties of Pt-HPA catalysts without additives
Table 2 lists data on catalytic properties of SiO2-supported Pt, HPA, and bi-component Pt-HPA catalysts in the conversion of propane with O2 and H2. At 150 °C, CO2 and H2O were only produced with Pt/SiO2 as the catalyst, while HPA/SiO2 left propane intact. The formation of CO2 was substantially suppressed on the bi-component Pt-HPA catalysts, and propene was detected among the products along with a number of C1–C3 oxygenates (1-C3H7OH, 2-C3H7OH, C2H5CHO, CH3COCH3, C3H5COOH; C2H3CHO and C2H3COOH in trace amounts; CH3CHO, CH3COOH; HCOOH, H2CO, and CO (traces)). The selectivity to propene was rather low at such conditions but could be increased through raising the temperature (cf. Nos. 3 and 4 in Table 2). At 200 °C, CO, formaldehyde, and formic acid were practically absent, obviously due to their high reactivity. C4 and heavier products were also absent, thereby indicating that polymerization and condensation reactions do not occur under the conditions used. At last, no CH4, C2H6, or C2H4 were present to appreciable concentration, C3H8 and C3H6 being the only hydrocarbons in the effluent. It implies that the C1–C2 oxygenates form through destructive oxidation but not through hydrogenolysis. In part this can be explained by the oxidizing conditions used in all catalytic runs (O2 was always provided in access to H2).

Conditions: C3H8/O2/H2/N2 = 18/6/10/66, residence time 0.4–0.5 s.
Platinum catalysts with some other heteropoly acids and on other supports have also been tested. In all cases, worse catalytic properties were observed. In particular, the use of Cs-phosphomolybdate instead of HPA gave low active and less selective catalyst (Table 2, No. 11). The data correspond to the observations made earlier in benzene hydroxylation, where the silica-supported catalysts with Pt and H3PMo12O40 manifested themselves as the best ones [25], [26].
The data in Table 2 indicate a concert action of catalyst components. In contrast to what might be expected from the properties of the single-component catalysts, the conversion of propane does not increase with Pt content (cf. 0.5Pt20HPA and 1Pt20HPA; Table 2, Nos. 4 and 8) but increases with HPA loading (Table 2, Nos. 8–10), and there is a broad range of the Pt/H3PMo12O40 ratios that ensure highest selectivity to propene (Fig. 1).

Scheme 1 represents a plausible mechanism of the oxidation on the bi-component catalysts. Oxygen is reductively activated on the sites composed of both Pt and HPA and forms peroxide. The later further reacts with propane and gives propyl alcohols and acetone. Both these oxygenates can serve as the source of propene: propyl alcohols are directly dehydrated on acidic sites but acetone through the preliminary hydrogenation into isopropyl alcohol. The yield of the targeted product is reduced by the combustion of organic compounds to CO2 and by the back hydrogenation of propene to propane.

3.2. Effect of additives
It seemed logical to assume that the side reactions take part predominantly on individual (uncoupled) Pt and HPA sites [25], [26], and attempts were made to diminish the number of such sites.
XPS spectra of all Pt-containing samples studied showed that Pt was fully reduced (Pt4f7/2 binding energies 71.4–71.6 eV, which is typical of Pt(0) [27]). In the region of Mo there were only signals of Mo6+ (samples after supporting HPA) or Mo6+ and Mo5+ (if treatment with H2 was performed). The Mo3d5/2 binding energies (232.1–232.5 eV and 230.9 eV) corresponded well to literature values for Mo6+ and Mo5+ [28], and the spectra showed no dependence on Pt content. It means that Pt is not included into HPA structure but there is, rather, a nonspecific interaction between Pt nanoparticles and HPA. This explains the necessity of high HPA loadings to provide selectivity for the propane dehydrogenation (Table 2).
The intensity of Mo signals in the spectra of Pt-HPA samples corresponded rather well to HPA loading (cf. XPS and XRF data in Table 3). It indicates that silica provides a good dispersion for the supported HPA, thereby enhancing the possibility of a close contact between HPA and Pt. In comparison with Mo/Si ratios, the difference between Pt/Si ratios determined with XPS and XRF was more pronounced. It meant that a significant part of Pt was undetectable with XPS – either Pt was present as large particles or Pt surface was screened by HPA.

Simple increase of HPA loading was not sufficient to improve catalytic properties. Just the opposite, large amounts of HPA (40 and 60%, Table 2, Nos. 6 and 7) led to a decrease both in activity and selectivity. Not excluded, the state and catalytic properties of supported HPA are different at such high loadings.
We made attempts to induce a stronger interaction between HPA and Pt with the aid of an additional dispersant. Among the additives tested, phosphoric acid appeared most effective in this respect. The intensity of Mo signals rose appreciably in the XPS spectra of H3PO4-containing samples (Table 3, third column). More important, the introduction of H3PO4 resulted in the intensity increase for Pt signals as well (Table 3, second column). The better dispersion of both HPA and Pt in the presence of H3PO4 not only lessened the combustion to CO2, thus improving the selectivity to C3H6, but also enhanced the total conversion of C3H8 (Table 4). Another possible reason of the improved performance of H3PO4-containing samples is the increase in catalyst acidity, which should facilitate the dehydration of propyl alcohols to propene (Scheme 1).

Irrespective of the exact reasons, it is of particular importance that H3PO4 allows the content of the precious metal to be greatly decreased. While we always had poor results with Pt-HPA catalysts at Pt content <0.5 wt.%, the catalysts prepared with H3PO4 show good performance if even the Pt loading is reduced to 0.05 wt.% and less (Fig. 2).

The Pt-HPA-PA samples have been studied with HAADF-STEM (Fig. 3). Pt nanoparticles were undistinguishable on the background of the support and HPA, and the relative location of Pt and HPA was estimated with EDX. These components appeared rather evenly distributed over the support: in each of the places probed with EDX, the presence of both Pt and Mo was detected. Nevertheless, some non-uniformity has also been revealed. The mapping picture in Fig. 3b indicates an island-type distribution, which is typical of silica-supported catalysts. The concentration of Mo and Pt could vary from place to place, and the Mo/Pt ratio could deviate from a nominal one (expectable from the Pt and Mo contents in the whole sample). For instance, the atomic ratio of Mo to Pt equals to 25 within the area marked in Fig. 3b, at nominal ratio of 50.

Taking into account the non-specific interaction between Pt and HPA, the possible shortage of HPA in some parts of the catalysts, and the high activity of bare Pt in side-reactions (Table 2, No. 2), an attempt has been made to lower the activity of Pt through promoting with non-platinum metals which could interact strongly with the Pt surface. Most interesting properties were shown by Au- and, especially, Ag-promoted catalysts (Table 5). In the latter case, the selectivity to propene as high as 94% could be achieved without a detrimental effect on the propane conversion, and the Ag(Au)-containing catalysts retained the superior performance under various conditions of catalytic testing (Fig. 4).

3.3. Influence of operating conditions
The present study was mainly aimed at finding out how and to what extent the selectivity to propene could be enhanced. Nevertheless, some of the data shed light on how the C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield could also be increased.
One can see in Fig. 4a that consumption of hydrogen in the process proceeds much faster as compared with the conversion of propane, and hydrogen is nearly absent in the effluent. It is less expressed for Au- and Ag-promoted catalysts, thereby explaining their better performance (Fig. 4). It can also explain the surprisingly weak dependence of propane conversion on Pt content in the catalysts in Fig. 2 (note that the catalyst mass and feed rates were the same in those experiments). It follows that the propene yield is mainly limited by the rapid consumption of H2 in the very first catalyst layers.
This has been verified in experiments with two reactors in line (Fig. 5). The effluent from the first reactor could be enriched with O2 and/or H2 before entering the second one. Without such an enrichment, the propane conversion remains practically unchanged (Table 6, case I), but it increases substantially upon addition of new portion of H2 to the feed before Reactor 2 (Table 6, case II). The rest of the data in Table 6 (case III) refer to experiment which resulted in the highest degree of C3H8 conversion (7.5%) at still high selectivity to C3H6 (88.5%). In the given case, both H2 and O2 were added after Reactor 1 and initial concentrations of these gases in both reactors were increased. (During the present study about 150 catalytic experiments were done and all of them went smoothly. However, one must keep in mind that any experiment with H2 + O2 containing mixtures needs special precautions.)

b
Conversion of each reagent was calculated with account the total amount of the reagent (supplied both in the second and first reactor).
There is an interesting observation in Fig. 4a that escaped our attention at the time of the experiments and which deserves a special study. One can see that the C3H8 conversion significantly increases at longer residence times although the conversion of H2 is almost completed at shorter times. It can be explained by the formation of some reactive species, e.g., peroxides, which enable the dehydrogenation to continue for more or less long time even in the absence of hydrogen, but high/moderate concentrations of H2 are only required to generate such species. The equal effectiveness of the H2 + O2 mixtures and H2O2 vapors in the low-temperature oxidation of alkanes has been reported (e.g., Ref. [16]).
It does not contradict with the data in Table 6. One might expect that the additional reactor would always increase the conversion of C3H8, regardless of whether or not the additional amounts of H2/O2 were introduced and especially if the effluent from the first reactor still contained some quantity of H2 (as in case I, Table 6). However, in all the experiments in Table 6, the gas product mixture went through a cold trap after leaving Reactor 1 and entering Reactor 2. The reactive peroxide intermediates should have been trapped and the catalytic process quenched. Experiments with co-feeding H2 and O2 along the catalyst bad in a single reactor would be of course of interest.
4. Conclusions
The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes, including the hydrogen-assisted one, makes it possible to overcome the serious disadvantages of conventional dehydrogenation processes, but the increased number of side reactions under the oxidative conditions could make it unattractive option. The present study has shown possibilities to gain an unprecedentedly high selectivity to alkene (>90%) even under the oxidative conditions and at a high conversion of organic substrate (>7%). The optimization of catalyst composition and conditions of catalytic run also allows the content of the expensive noble metal in catalyst to be lowered to p.p.m. level. Some of the data obtained indicate possibility for further improvements, both in the alkene yield and in the loss of H2 and O2, and future researches seem fruitful.

2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
