 Unfortunately, the provided document extracts do not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation research. All extracts indicate that the documents focus on supported Pt nanoparticle catalysts for catalytic oxidation of toluene, with no mention of propane dehydrogenation or conversion of propane to propylene. Since there are no extracts with pertinent information, I cannot provide an integrated summary. The output would be:
