Graphical Abstract
IrGa/Al2O3 catalyst with atomical metal dispersion exhibits excellent non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation performance with a propylene selectivity of 98 % at an 18 % propane conversion for 100 hours, comparable to that of classical Pt-based catalysts. An enhanced synergetic effect between metallic Ir and partially reduced GaOx oxide was found.
Abstract
Industrial catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation to olefins suffer from fast deactivation due to the coking and sintering of active metal under harsh reaction conditions. Herein, iridium, a noble metal rarely applied in C−H activation, has been employed to construct an ultra-stable IrGa/Al2O3 catalyst with atomical metal dispersion for non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH). A synergetic effect between metallic Ir and GaOx is discovered which contributes to both high PDH activity and propylene selectivity. Notably, the Ir0.5Ga2/Al2O3 with 0.5 wt % of Ir and 2.0 wt % of Ga exhibited a propylene selectivity of 98 % at a 19 % propane conversion at 550 °C and 86 % at a 35 % propane conversion at 600 °C. A stable PDH performance of 100 h was observed after a deactivation process at the initial reaction stage. The catalytic performance of the IrGa/Al2O3 is comparable to that of Pt-based catalysts, endowing the Ir-based catalyst with great potential in dehydrogenation reactions.
Introduction
The wide application of light olefins (ethylene, propylene, and butenes) in the chemical industry has driven a continuously growing market with an annual demand exceeding 320 million tons worldwide.1 The conventional processes, including steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of naphtha, can hardly meet the booming market demand due to the limited crude oil reserve and increasingly stringent environmental policies.2-5 Therefore, the development of on-purpose technologies to alleviate the shortfall of light olefins is urgent and promising, such as methanol to olefins, hydrogenation of CO/CO2 to olefins, and the emerging dehydrogenation of light alkanes.6-10 In the recent past, the large-scale exploitation of both conventional and unconventional gases (shale gas, tight gas) promotes the alkane dehydrogenation process as one of the fastest-growing technologies in olefin production, especially propane dehydrogenation (PDH).11-13 The content of propane in shale gas can be as high as 10 vol %.14 The PDH process not only supplements the market requirements for olefins but also produces hydrogen with a low-carbon footprint.11 Therefore, the PDH technique has attracted enormous research attention from both industry and academia.
The PDH process has been commercialized by UOP Oleflex and Chevron Lummus technologies using PtSnK/Al2O3 and CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts, respectively.15-17 Due to the toxicity of chromium and low activity, more research efforts on PDH catalysts have moved to active noble metal-based catalysts.18-20 Because of the endothermic nature, the dehydrogenation of light alkanes requires high reaction temperatures, typically above 500 °C, which brings stability issues to the dehydrogenation catalysts. Two dominant deactivation reasons for Pt catalysts are coking due to excessive dehydrogenation and the sintering/segregation of active metals.21-23 Up to now, the classical PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst still needs periodic regeneration by chlorine and air at high temperatures, which eventually increases the cost and energy consumption of the industrial application.24-26
To increase the stability and activity of noble metal catalysts in PDH reactions, a series of efficient strategies have been implemented, including spatial confinement of active particles, employing new active metals, and alloying with second metals.1, 2, 9 Liu et al. presented a strategy to prepare subnanometer Pt catalysts inside purely siliceous MCM-22 or MFI zeolites, which restricted the sintering of Pt particles and improved the performances in PDH reactions.27, 28 Then, Sun et al. reported that the confinement of PtZn subnanometer clusters inside purely siliceous silicalite-1 crystals could offer a high propylene selectivity of 99 % without significant deactivation for 216 h.29 Besides, some other noble metals, such as Rh, Pd, Ru, and Ir, rather than Pt have also been applied in PDH reactions by combining with second non-noble metals.30-33 Hannagan et al. reported a theory-discovered RhCu alloy catalyst, which exhibited an enhanced sintering resistance property in PDH reaction.32 The first-principles calculations revealed that Rh atoms dispersed in Cu exhibited low C−H bond activation barriers, thus enabling low-temperature PDH reaction. Zhang et al. reported a PdBi/SiO2 catalyst with a Pd core and Pd3Bi alloyed shell, which offered a 95 % selectivity of propylene in the PDH reaction.33 Moreover, Ir and Ru were also employed and evaluated in PDH reaction,31 but exhibited inferior performance than classical Pt-based catalysts.
The co-catalyst, typically non-noble metals, such as Sn, In, Cu, Zn, and Ga, is usually indispensable for noble metal catalysts in PDH reactions.1, 2 An appropriate amount of co-catalyst can well disperse the active noble metals and form new active sites, thus facilitating the desorption of olefins and suppressing the coking. In particular, Pt and Ga were proven to be excellent combinations for constructing active and selective catalysts for PDH reactions, where Ga performs the actual dehydrogenation reaction, and Pt is a promoting element.34 Thereafter, Ga was widely employed for coupling with Pt and Rh for efficient PDH reactions, because Ga was verified to promote the dispersion and mobility of noble metals.35-38 Despite these advances, the family of PDH catalysts is still limited to a few metals, and the exploration of new types of catalysts is still necessary.32, 35, 39 In this work, we have constructed a series of IrGa catalysts with atomical metal dispersion on an alumina support, which offered an excellent PDH performance with propylene selectivity up to 98 % at propane conversion of 18 % for more than 100 h. The synergistic effect between Ir and GaOx has been well characterized by a series of advanced characterization techniques.
Results and Discussion
Catalyst performances
We first evaluated a series of noble metal catalysts modified by Ga in the PDH reaction at 550 °C and 1 bar (Figure 1a and Table S1). Catalysts in this group were prepared by an electrostatic adsorption method with noble metal loading of 0.5 wt % and Ga loading of 1.0 wt %. RhGa/Al2O3, PtGa/Al2O3, and IrGa/Al2O3 exhibited an enhanced PDH performance compared with Ga/Al2O3, while the promotion effect was not evident over RuGa/Al2O3 and PdGa/Al2O3. The C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity followed the order of IrGa/Al2O3≈RhGa/Al2O3>PtGa/Al2O3 and IrGa/Al2O3>PtGa/Al2O3>RhGa/Al2O3, respectively. The IrGa/Al2O3 offered an ultrahigh C3H6 selectivity of 98 % at a C3H8 conversion of 17 %. Considering the high price of the Rh, the Ir-based catalyst could be an alternative option to Pt-based catalysts. In fact, the noble metal Ir has already been used in the commercialized methanol carbonylation process.40

It is noteworthy that the Ga/Al2O3 with Ga in its partially oxidized state already can provide a considerable PDH performance.8 The C3H8 conversions over our Ga1/Al2O3 (Ga1 in Figure 1a) and Ga2/Al2O3 (Ga2 in Figure 1b) catalysts with different Ga loadings were 7.0 % and 11 %, respectively. The conversion levels of Ga1 and Ga2 did not follow the first order probably because the dispersion of Ga species decreased with the increase of Ga loading. The Ir/Ga ratio plays a key role in the PDH performance (Figure 1b). As the Ir content increased from 0 to 1.3 wt %, the C3H8 conversion over IrxGa2/Al2O3 with 2.0 wt % Ga loading steadily improved from 11 % to 22 % and the C3H6 selectivity increased from 95 % to 98 %. The choice of appropriate support, which determines the dispersion and electronic state of active metals, is crucial for achieving excellent PDH performance.2, 8 A series of catalyst supports, which have been employed in PDH reaction,18 were investigated for IrGa catalyst (Figure 1c). It was found that the IrGa catalyst supported on Al2O3 exhibited better performance in both C3H8 conversion and C3H6 selectivity than those supported on silicalite-1 (S-1), fumed SiO2, ZrO2, CeO2, and boron nitride (BN).
To investigate the synergetic effect of Ir and Ga, we carefully compared the PDH performance over Ir/Al2O3, Ga/Al2O3, and IrGa/Al2O3 catalysts under identical reaction conditions (Figure 2a). The C3H8 conversion levels over Ir/Al2O3, Ga/Al2O3, and IrGa/Al2O3 were 3.8 %, 11 %, and 19 %, respectively. Interestingly, the C3H8 conversion over IrGa was higher than the sum of Ir and Ga, suggesting a synergistic effect between them. Considering the product selectivity, the IrGa/Al2O3 with 0.5 wt % of Ir and 2.0 wt % Ga also offered a higher C3H6 selectivity (98 %) than those of Ir/Al2O3 (91 %) and Ga/Al2O3 (95 %). The C3H8 surface reactions, which depict the propane conversion at the initial stage, also demonstrate an enhanced PDH performance over IrGa/Al2O3 catalyst (Figures S1 and S2). As a thermodynamically favorable reaction at high temperatures (Figure S3), we further evaluated the temperature effect over the optimum Ir0.5Ga2/Al2O3 catalyst (Figure 2b). Generally, raising the temperature was beneficial to C3H8 conversion (35 % at 600 °C), but the C3H6 selectivity decreased from 98 % at 550 °C to 86 % at 600 °C due to the side cracking reactions. Therefore, 550 °C is the optimum temperature for the IrGa catalyst in the PDH reaction, and Ir0.5Ga2/Al2O3 was selected as the optimum catalyst for further characterization unless otherwise mentioned.

Stability is one of the most important performance indicators for PDH reaction.38, 41, 42 Interestingly, the optimal IrGa catalyst under typical dehydrogenation conditions was stable for more than 100 h on the stream (Figure 2c). To our knowledge, this is the first report of such high PDH stability for Ir catalysts. It is noteworthy that at the first 5 h of the reaction, the C3H8 conversion decreased from 24 % to 19 % and then reached a steady state, while the C3H6 selectivity was more stable during the reaction. The decrease in C3H8 conversion and increase in C3H6 selectivity could be ascribed to two reasons: a self-assembly process of bimetallic sites (reconstruction) and carbon deposition on cracking sites.2, 43 Our thermal gravimetric (TG) analysis suggests that the catalyst coking occurred primarily at the initial stage, and the coking amount only accounted for 0.2 wt % of the converted propane (Figure S4). The IrGa/Al2O3 could not fully recover its PDH performance after two regeneration steps by only calcination with diluted oxygen (Figure S5), suggesting that the reconstruction of IrGa sites could not be excluded and an elaborate regeneration method still needs to be developed to redisperse IrGa species. Overall, the productivity of the IrGa catalyst is slightly lower than the optimum Pt-based catalysts, but the catalyst stability and C3H6 selectivity of the IrGa catalysts are comparable to those of the Pt-based catalysts (Table S6).
Catalyst structure
The N2-physisorption suggests that Al2O3 support exhibited a type IV adsorption isotherm, indicating a typical mesoporous structure (Figure 3a). The average mesopore size of the pristine Al2O3 was around 10 nm. After loading IrGa catalysts, the IrGa/Al2O3 catalyst still exhibited a mesoporous structure and BET surface area of 215 m2 g−1, close to those of Al2O3 support (Table S7), but the mesopore size decreased to 6.5 nm on average. The decrease in mesopore size might be attributed to the reconstruction of Al2O3 induced by the loading of Ir and Ga. Besides, the mercury intrusion suggests that macropores in a wide range of 5–100 μm were also observed over IrGa/Al2O3 (Figure S6). These abundant mesoporosity and macroporosity are expected to benefit the mass transfer property.44 The X-ray Powder Diffraction (XRD) patterns suggest that for Ir/Al2O3, Ga/Al2O3, and IrGa/Al2O3 catalysts before and after the reaction, only characteristic peaks assigned to gamma alumina (γ-Al2O3 JCPDS 10-0425) were observed (Figure 3b). No peaks belonging to Ir or Ga species were found (Figure S7), implying high dispersion of Ir and Ga species on Al2O3 both before and after the reaction. Moreover, even with the high loadings of Ir (2.0 wt %) and Ga (8.0 wt %), no IrGa alloy phase was followed over the catalyst after the PDH reaction (Figure S8).

The scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) images show that the activated IrGa/Al2O3 exhibited an aggregate phenomenon (Figure 4a), and the Al2O3 particle size is about 10–30 nm with abundant interparticle mesoporosity (Figure 4b). Due to the high dispersion of Ir and Ga, no obvious metal nanoparticles were observed on the bright-field TEM images, consistent with the XRD results. The aberration-corrected high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (AC-HAADF-STEM) image suggests that some small metal clusters could be observed and both Ga and Ir species were uniformly distributed over composite catalysts (Figure 4c). The average size of IrGa clusters was around 0.6 nm (Figure 4d), consisting of a dozen of metal atoms. Considering that the atomic mass of Al, Ga, and Ir are 27, 70, and 192, respectively, the brighter spots should be Ir atoms, and the slightly darker spots are Ga atoms (Figure 4e). Other than distinct IrGa clusters, some Ir single atoms and ensemble sites (two or more Ir atoms) could also be observed and these ensemble sites seemed to be distorted by Ga species. These observations indicate that the Ir and Ga species were highly dispersed and closely contacted in space, which endowed a synergy effect in the PDH reaction.

Chemical state of active sites
H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) measurements suggest that the reduction of Ga/Al2O3 was difficult, and a reduction peak at 658 °C was observed (Figure 5a). The reduction of Ir/Al2O3 was much easier than Ga/Al2O3 and initiated at around 220 °C. It is noteworthy that the combination of Ir and Ga had a significant impact on the reduction behavior. The reduction of IrOx was inhibited while that of GaOx was promoted and initiated at around 500 °C, implying an eutectic effect between Ir and Ga.5 In a similar PtGa/Al2O3 system, Zhang et al. evidenced that the addition of Pt can promote the reduction of Ga2O3 via a hydrogen spillover mechanism, forming Pt−GaOx sites.37 Considering the typical temperature for PDH reactions is 550 °C, we can speculate that the Ir−GaOx sites with metallic Ir and partially reduced Ga were the primary species in activated catalysts.

CO is an ideal probe molecule to investigate the chemical state and dispersion of active metal sites, especially for precious metals.29 The Fourier transform infrared spectra of CO (CO-FTIR) exhibit three featured absorption peaks at 2057 cm−1, 2034 cm−1, and 2013 cm−1, respectively (Figure 5b). The CO stretching frequency at 2034 cm−1 can be attributed to liner-CO chemisorption of the top binding on Ir clusters and the peaks at 2057 cm−1 and 2013 cm−1 can be individually attributed to the dicarbonyl adsorbed CO with symmetric and anti-symmetric vibrational modes of the Ir(CO)2 of Ir single atoms.45 The primary Ir species is the single atom for both Ir/Al2O3 and IrGa/Al2O3 catalysts, implying that Ir species could be highly dispersed by Al2O3 support. Other than single-atom Ir, a small fraction of Ir−Ir species were also observed (2034 cm−1). The combination of Ga with Ir decreased the CO adsorption on these Ir−Ir species, suggesting that the Ir−Ir bonds would be distorted by Ga, in line with the TEM imaging (Figure 4e).
Quasi-in situ XPS studies show that the Ir 4f5/2 peak of both fresh Ir/Al2O3 and IrGa/Al2O3 catalysts was at 64.6 eV, close to the position of 64.8 eV for the IrO2 oxide. After the propane treatment at 550 °C for 3 h, the Ir 4f5/2 peak of the two catalysts shifted to 63.2 eV, corresponding to the metallic Ir (Figure 5c). In contrast, the reduction of Ga species was more difficult. For the fresh Ga/Al2O3 and IrGa/Al2O3 catalysts, Ga was in its oxide state (Ga2O3). The propane treatment at 550 °C could not change the oxidation state of the Ga/Al2O3 catalyst (Figure S9). Whereas the Ga 2p peaks of IrGa/Al2O3 shifted to low binding energy by about 0.3 eV, suggesting Ga2O3 was slightly reduced in the presence of Ir (Figure 5d). However, even after 12 h of reduction under C3H8 flow, no XPS peaks assigned to metallic Ga (Ga−Ga) were observed. These results indicate that there exists an interaction between Ir and Ga species and the addition of Ir in Ga could promote the formation of Ir−GaOx sites, which led to enhanced PDH performance.
Conclusions
Our work has demonstrated that IrGa/Al2O3 catalyst can offer excellent performance in PDH reactions. The Ir and Ga metals are highly dispersed and stabilized on the mesoporous alumina and a synergistic effect between Ir and Ga was evidenced. Although the TEM imaging suggests that Ir−Ir ensemble sites exist, the CO-IR experiments hint that the Ir−Ir bonds are distorted by the combination of Ga or interaction with alumina support. Compared with IrOx, GaOx is difficult to reduce, but the partially reduced GaOx might lead to the formation of synergistic Ir−GaOx sites, as the primary active center for the PDH reactions. The optimum IrGa/Al2O3 catalyst with 0.5 wt % of Ir and 2.0 wt % Ga loading provides a C3H6 selectivity of 98 % at a C3H8 conversion of 19 %. The catalyst undergoes a deactivation process at the initial stage but keeps the C3H6 selectivity of 98 % at a C3H8 conversion of 18 % stable for 100 h. This work demonstrates that IrGa/Al2O3 with atomic dispersion of metals can be an alternative catalyst to classical PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst.

Catalyst synthesis
Catalysts were prepared by an electrostatic adsorption method. Take IrGa/Al2O3 with 0.5 wt % Ir and 2.0 wt % Ga for example. Typically, an appropriate amount of chloroiridic acid was stirred and dissolved in deionized water, and then an appropriate amount of ethylenediamine (Ir : EDA : H2O=1 : 8 : 200, molar ratio) was added and stirred in an ice water bath until the Ir complex solution was formed. 0.5 g of gallium nitrate was dissolved in 5 mL deionized water, and then 6.8 g Al2O3 powder was added and dried at room temperature with stirring. Ir complex in the alkaline solution was introduced dropwise into the Al2O3-containing solution and stirred for 24 h. The cationic metal ions would be preferentially adsorbed on negatively charged Al2O3. The resulting sample was dried overnight at 80 °C and further calcined at 550 °C for 2 h. The control catalyst KPtSn/Al2O3 with 0.14 wt % K, 0.5 wt % Pt, and 0.75 % Sn was prepared by an by a co-impregnation method.46
Characterizations
The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was measured on a Smart Lab-SE physical X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation (λ=0.15406 nm) X-ray source (40 kV and 30 mA). The porosity of samples was determined on a Micromeritics Tri-Star II 3020 surface area analyzer. Before N2 adsorption, the sample was degassed under a vacuum at 200 °C for 3 h. Mercury intrusion was measured in a Micromeritics Autopore IV 9510 instrument. H2-TPR measurements were performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 instrument. First, the sample was heated to 400 °C under airflow for 60 min, then a 5 vol % H2/Ar mixture was introduced into the reactor after the sample cooled to 50 °C. The temperature was raised to 800 °C at a speed of 10 °C min−1. The consumption of H2 was monitored by a thermal conductivity detector. The amount of coke was determined by thermal gravimetric (TG) analysis on a TGA Q500 instrument under airflow.
C3H8 surface reactions (C3H8-SR) were performed on the same Micromeritics AutoChemII 2920 instrument. Typically, 200 mg catalyst was first reduced at 550 °C for 1 h. After purging with flow Ar for 30 min, C3H8 with a flow rate of 10 mL min−1 was switched into the reactor for 15 min. After the reaction, the used catalyst was purged with flow Ar again for 10 min and followed by flow air for the combustion of coke. The outlet gases were analyzed online by mass spectrometry. Fourier transform infrared spectra of CO (CO-FTIR) were performed on the Nicolet 6700 spectrometer equipped with an MCT detector. The sample was pressed into a self-supported wafer and placed in an in situ IR cell. The sample was reduced with a 10 vol % H2/Ar flow at 550 °C for 1 h and cooled to room temperature. Then, a 10 vol % CO/Ar at a rate of 20 mL min−1 was switched into for 1 h. The CO adsorption spectra were recorded after the catalyst was purged with flow Ar for 1 h.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on HITACHI S-4800 operated at 15 kV. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images of Ir0.5Ga2/Al2O3 were obtained on a Philips Analytical FEI Tecnai 20 electron microscope operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. The aberration-corrected high-angle annual dark-filed scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC-HAADF-STEM) was performed on a JEM-ARM200F equipped with a CEOS probe corrector. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out with a Quantum 2000 Scanning ESCA Microprobe with Al Kα radiation (1846.6 eV) as the X-ray source. The catalyst wafer was pretreated in situ under C3H8 flow at 550 °C. The binding energy was calibrated using a C1s photoelectron peak at 284.6 eV.
Catalyst evaluation
The catalytic performances were evaluated in a fixed-bed tubular quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 10 mm, built by Xiamen HanDe Engineering Co., Ltd. Typically, 0.3 g catalyst was loaded into the reactor, then the catalyst was heated to 550 °C with a 10 °C min−1 temperature ramp under H2 flow (20 mL min−1). The reaction was initiated by switching C3H8/H2/N2 (1 : 1 : 2) mixture flow under 1 bar and 550 °C. The products were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (Ruimin GC-2060, Shanghai) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) connected to an Rt−Q-Bond capillary column. The stainless steel lines connected to the quartz reactor and GC were heated to 150 °C, ensuring all the hydrocarbon products could be gasified. Considering less than 0.2 wt % of converted propane stays on use catalyst as coking confirmed by TG analysis, the PDH performance is calculated based on a normalization method, assuming all the gaseous hydrocarbon products can be detected and analyzed by FID. The propane conversion and product selectivity are calculated by the following formula. Select. I (%)=Ai/∑Ai×100 %, Conv. C3H8 (%)=∑Ai/(∑Ai+AC3H8)×100 %, and yield i (%)=Select i×Conv. C3H8×1/100 %, where A and i represent FID peak area and hydrocarbon products in the effluent gas stream, respectively. AC3H8 denotes the peak area of unreacted C3H8 in the effluent gas stream.
