Graphical Abstract

Among the series of catalysts prepared, 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1073 K (Sn/Pt ratio=1, reduced at 1073 K) composed of Pt3Sn alloy with a small fraction of Pt-Sn alloy, exhibits the highest activity.
Abstract
A series of Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts with different Sn/Pt atomic ratios (1/3–3) were prepared by a direct reduction method and tested for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Structural characterization by XRD, TEM, CO adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption fine structure analysis revealed that the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts possessed a highly dispersed Pt-Sn alloy core with a Sn-rich surface regardless of the Sn/Pt ratio or reduction temperature. Highly dispersed SnO2 coexisted with the Pt-Sn alloy particles, and part of the Pt-Sn alloy surface was covered with SnO2. Among the catalysts prepared, 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1073 K (Sn/Pt ratio=1, reduced at 1073 K), composed of Pt3Sn alloy with a small fraction of Pt-Sn alloy, exhibited the highest activity. In contrast, if the Sn/Pt ratio was larger than 1 and/or the reduction temperature was 1273 K, Pt-Sn alloy was observed mainly and the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts showed low activity.
Introduction
Propylene is an important raw material for a wide array of specialty chemicals such as polypropene, acrolein, polyacrylonitrile, and acrylic acid. The conventional way to synthesize propylene is the steam cracking of alkanes, naphtha, or gas oil above 1000 K.1 However, the steam cracking of naphtha produces a propylene yield of only approximately 20 % with substantial quantities of methane and cokes as byproducts. The production of propylene by the thermal dehydrogenation of propane is an attractive alternative because it is more energy efficient and minimizes the formation of methane and coke byproducts.2 With a suitable catalyst system, higher yields and selectivity towards propylene are expected to be achieved under more environmentally benign conditions.
Pt-Sn, in the form of supported nanoparticles, is one of the most suitable catalysts for the thermal dehydrogenation of light alkanes.3 This bimetallic catalyst often exhibits better activity, selectivity, and stability than supported monometallic Pt catalysts, even though the details of the catalyst structure are still unclear. The properties of Pt-Sn catalysts have been found to depend strongly on the composition of the Pt and Sn precursors and the catalyst preparation procedure. Conventional preparation,4 co-impregnation or sequential impregnation of the support material with metal precursors followed by high-temperature calcination and reduction, and colloidal synthesis5 have been applied generally to the preparation of supported Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts. Colloidal synthesis6 often exhibits better performance owing to the control of the structural properties of the obtained Pt-Sn bimetallic nanoparticles. However, many factors during preparation and the lack of systematic data on the effects of synthesis conditions mean that colloidal synthesis is not facile or comparable.
In our previous work,7 the conventional impregnation method was used to synthesize SiO2-supported Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts. Three different treatments (direct reduction (DR), decomposition in inert gas (DI), and calcination–reduction (CR)) were compared in detail. The Pt-Sn/SiO2 prepared by the DR method (the impregnated precursor was reduced directly with H2) showed the highest activity for the dehydrogenation of propane. It was found that Pt3Sn alloy formed on the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst prepared by DR if the initial Pt/Sn ratio was 1.
Herein, the effects of reduction temperature and the Sn/Pt ratio on the structure of Pt-Sn alloy nanoparticles on Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts prepared by DR were investigated in detail. TEM, XRD, X-ray absorption fine structure analysis (XAFS), CO adsorption, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the bulk and surface states of the Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts. Furthermore, combined with catalytic propane dehydrogenation tests, the structure–catalytic activity relationships, especially the states of Pt in the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts, were discussed.
Results
Propane dehydrogenation
The effect of the Sn/Pt ratio on the activities of Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts prepared by DR is shown in Figure 1. In our previous paper,7 we reported that Pt-Sn/SiO2 (DR) showed a higher activity for the dehydrogenation of propane than Pt/SiO2 (DR), which indicates that Sn improved the catalytic performance of the supported Pt catalyst. The promoting effect of Sn in the dehydrogenation of propane,3b butane,3e isobutane,3a and hexane3f has been reported previously. In the case of the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts reduced at 773 K, the conversion of propane increased initially with the Sn/Pt ratio, and 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_773 K and 1Pt2Sn/SiO2_773 K showed a high activity. However, the activity was reduced drastically at a Sn/Pt ratio of 3.0. The conversion of propane by the catalysts reduced at 1073 K also depended strongly on the Sn/Pt ratio, which increased approximately linearly with the Sn/Pt ratio up to 1.0. A further increase in the Sn/Pt ratio caused significant decreases in activity. The reduction of the catalysts at 1273 K resulted in quite low activities for the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts except for 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1273 K, which showed 11.8 % propane conversion. Overall, 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1073 K showed the highest activity among the catalysts tested and exhibited a propane conversion of 26.5 % and selectivity toward propylene of 99.4 %. A trace amount of methane and ethane were detected as byproducts. 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1073 K is almost stable during the reaction time (3 h).7

Physical and chemical properties of Pt-Sn/SiO2
The BET specific surface area, amount of adsorbed CO, and average particle size estimated from HAADF-STEM images (Figure S1) of Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts with various Sn/Pt ratios reduced at 773, 1073, and 1273 K are summarized in Table 1. The BET surface area of Pt/SiO2_773 K (340 m2 g−1) was slightly larger than that of the Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts (e.g., 297 m2 g−1 for 3Pt1Sn/SiO2_773 K). The BET surface areas of the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts reduced at 773 and 1073 K were approximately 300 m2 g−1 regardless of the Sn/Pt ratio. In contrast, the BET surface area was decreased by reduction at 1273 K (≈210 m2 g−1).

[a] The loading amount of Pt was 3 wt %. [b] The molar ratio of Sn to Pt is 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, or 3:1. [c] The surface area of SiO2 (JRC-SIO-9) is 325 m2 g−1. [d] CO adsorption was measured with CO pulse experiments. [e] Average particle size was determined from the histogram of approximately 200 bright dots from HAADF-STEM images.
The amount of adsorbed CO and the average Pt particle size of Pt/SiO2_773 K were 54.9 μmol g−1 and approximately 1.1 nm, respectively. This result indicated that Pt was well dispersed on Pt/SiO2 prepared by DR. The addition of Sn to Pt/SiO2 (Sn/Pt ratio=1/3, 1/2, 1, 2) caused a significant decrease in the amount of adsorbed CO and a modest increase in the average particle size regardless of the reduction temperature. However, the average particle size was increased remarkably (≈5–6 nm) if the Sn/Pt ratio was 3.0 (1Pt3Sn/SiO2; Figure S1). Meanwhile, a very low amount of adsorbed CO was detected on this catalyst.
The modification of the CO chemisorption properties of Pt by the addition of Sn has been reported by many researchers. Meriaudeau et al.8 reported that Sn addition decreased the strength of PtCO bonds by blocking the higher binding sites of Pt preferentially. They interpreted that this decrease of the PtCO bond strength is caused by a geometric effect. Recently, Wang et al.9 synthesized Pt, Pt-Sn (random alloy), and Pt@Sn (core–shell) catalysts using a colloidal synthesis method. They found a clear decrease in the intensity of CO adsorbed linearly on Pt sites in the order Pt>Pt-Sn (random alloy)>Pt@Sn (core–shell). The low amount of CO adsorbed on the Pt@Sn catalyst was attributed to the Sn surface covering and the absence of accessible surface Pt sites (geometric effects). In addition to the geometric effect, the change in the electronic state of Pt on alloying with other metals has also been considered important to control CO chemisorption. Liu et al.10 reported that Pt-Sn@Pt core–shell nanoparticle electrocatalysts prepared by potential cycling of Pt-Sn intermetallic nanoparticles in CO-saturated H2SO4 solutions exhibited substantially higher CO tolerance to Pt, Pt-Ru alloy, and Pt-Sn alloy catalysts. They proposed that this superior CO tolerance of the Pt-Sn@Pt catalyst was mainly because of the electronic effects of the Pt-Sn core on the Pt shell.
Therefore, the results in this work suggest the formation of a Pt-Sn alloy, such as Pt3Sn, PtSn, PtSn2, and/or the deposition of a Sn species on the surface of the Pt metal particles in the series of Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts. Furthermore, the activities of these catalysts (Figure 1) were not proportional to the number of accessible Pt sites on their surfaces estimated from the amount of adsorbed CO (Table S1). Thus, the effects of the Sn/Pt ratio and reduction temperature on the local structure and electronic state of Pt and Sn should be considered to explain both the CO adsorption and catalytic behaviors of the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts.
XRD patterns of Pt-Sn/SiO2
The XRD patterns of the catalysts with different Sn/Pt ratios and reduced at different temperatures are shown in Figure 3. The XRD pattern of 3Pt1Sn/SiO2_773 K exhibited a broad peak at 2 θ=39.3°. This position is lower than the peak of Pt metal (1 1 1) (2 θ=39.8°; ICSD 41525) and higher than the peak of Pt3Sn alloy (1 1 1) (2 θ=39.0°; ICSD 105796). A similar shift of the characteristic peak of the (1 1 1) plane has been reported previously for various Pt-Sn alloys such as Pt0.94Sn0.06,11 Pt0.93Sn0.07,12 Pt0.90Sn0.10,13 and Pt0.75Sn0.25(Pt3Sn),11 which accompanies lattice parameter expansion, and their XRD patterns are shown in Figure S2. The crystal structure of PtxSny alloys (x/y>3) is face-centered cubic (fcc), similar to Pt metal. Based on Vegard’s law, the broad peak observed for 3Pt1Sn/SiO2_773 K (2 θ=39.3°) can be assigned to Pt0.84Sn0.16 alloy. The broad full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of this diffraction peak also implies the coexistence of various PtxSny alloys (x/y>3).

If the Sn content was further increased, a small diffraction peak at 2 θ=39° assignable to Pt3Sn alloy (1 1 1) (ICSD 105796) was observed. No diffraction peaks were observed for 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_773 K or 1Pt2Sn/SiO2_773 K. Two diffraction peaks around 2 θ=42 and 44° attributed to the Pt-Sn alloy phase (ICSD 42593) were observed for 1Pt3Sn/SiO2_773 K. Additionally, there were no clear diffraction peaks caused by Sn compounds such as Sn metal and Sn oxides (SnO and SnO2) even for 1Pt3Sn/SiO2, which had a Sn content of 5.2 wt %.
If the reduction temperature was increased to 1073 K, the diffraction peaks of Pt3Sn alloy appeared in the XRD patterns of 3Pt1Sn/SiO2 and 2Pt1Sn/SiO2. In the case of 3Pt1Sn/SiO2, a shoulder peak assignable to PtxSny alloy (x/y>3) was also observed. The XRD pattern of 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 showed weak diffraction peaks of Pt-Sn alloy alongside those of the Pt3Sn alloy. A further increase in the Sn content resulted in a decrease in the intensity of the Pt3Sn alloy diffraction peaks and an increase in those of the Pt-Sn alloy. In the case of 1Pt3Sn/SiO2, the diffraction peaks of Pt3Sn alloy vanished and those of Pt-Sn alloy were weakened.
The XRD pattern of 3Pt1Sn/SiO2_1273 K showed an asymmetric diffraction peak at around 2 θ=39.2°, similar to that observed for 3Pt1Sn/SiO2_1073 K, which suggests the coexistence of Pt3Sn and PtxSny (x/y>3) alloys. Weak diffraction peaks caused by Pt3Sn alloy appeared in the XRD patterns of 2Pt1Sn/SiO2_1273 K and 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1273 K, but their intensities were weaker than those observed for the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts reduced at 1073 K. In the case of 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1273 K, the diffraction peaks of Pt-Sn alloy were also observed. These Pt-Sn alloy peaks became quite weak for 1Pt2Sn/SiO2_1073 K, whereas the XRD pattern of 1Pt3Sn/SiO2_1273 K showed no diffraction peaks caused by Pt-Sn alloy.
XAFS analysis of Pt-Sn/SiO2
The Pt L3- and L2-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalysts reduced at 773, 1073, and 1273 K and reference samples (Pt/SiO2 reduced at 773 K and Pt foil) are shown in Figure 4. The white-line intensity at the Pt L3- and L2-edges of 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_773 K was almost equal to that of Pt foil and lower than that of Pt/SiO2 reduced at 773 K. In contrast, the white-line intensity of 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 reduced at 1073 K was slightly less than that of Pt foil. The intensity observed for 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1273 K was lower than that of 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_773 K and 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1073 K, and the width of the absorption band at the Pt L3-edge was slightly broader, which implies a different electronic state and local environment of Pt in 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1273 K from that in the other catalysts.

The Pt L3- and L2-edge X-ray absorption white lines correspond to electronic transitions from 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 core-level states and reflect the electronic states of the vacant d orbitals of Pt directly. The L3-edge reflects the final vacant d states of both the 5d3/2 and 5d5/2 levels, whereas the L2-edge reflects that of only the 5d3/2 level. Lytle reported that the intensity of a Pt L3 X-ray absorption spectrum is related to the d-electron valences and the chemical environment.14 The lower intensity of the white lines observed for the 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalysts than those for the Pt foil and Pt/SiO2 suggests electron donation from Sn to Pt and alloy formation between Pt and Sn in this catalyst. Uemura et al.15 also reported a lower white-line intensity of an Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst (reduced at 573 K) than that of Pt foil and assigned the small decrease to the formation of a Pt-Sn alloy because the d-electron density of Pt atoms is increased by alloying with Sn, which has a lower electronegativity than Pt (Pt 2.2, Sn 1.8).16 Kim et al.17 reported that the intensity of the white line was lower for Pt-Sn/C catalysts than Pt/C, which was attributed to partial filling of the unoccupied Pt 5d orbitals by electron donation from Sn. However, based on Pt L3-edge XANES spectra and quantum chemical DFT calculations, Linic and co-workers18 proposed that the formation of Pt-Sn alloys does not lead to significant charge transfer such as electron donation between the constituent metal elements. Instead, they reported that the formation of Pt-Sn alloys results in a change in the width of the d band localized on Pt by hybridization between the local d orbital and the valence orbitals of neighboring atoms (Sn).
The k3-weighted EXAFS oscillations at the Pt L3-edge of 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalysts reduced at 773, 1073, and 1273 K and reference samples (Pt/SiO2 reduced at 773 K, and Pt foil) are shown in Figure 5 A. The EXAFS oscillations of the 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalysts were significantly different and much weaker than those of the Pt foil and Pt/SiO2 reduced at 773 K. The EXAFS oscillations of 1P1Sn/SiO2_773 K exhibited essentially similar features to those of 1P1Sn/SiO2_1073 K. In the Fourier transforms (FTs) of the EXAFS spectra of 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalysts shown in Figure 5 B, no PtO linkage (around 0.17 nm) was observed, which indicates that the supported Pt species was reduced to the metallic state after reduction at 773 K. Furthermore, a weak and split feature at around 0.21–0.28 nm in the EXAFS FTs of the reduced catalysts suggests the interference of scattered electrons by Sn and Pt as reported by Uemura et al.15 and Ramallo-López et al.19 We have reported the results of curve-fitting analysis of the EXAFS data for 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1073 K previously.7 We assumed two shells (PtPt and PtSn linkages) to fit the EXAFS data for 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1073 K, and the PtPt and PtSn distances were calculated to be slightly shorter than the crystallographic values (PtPt=0.283 nm and PtSn=0.283 nm) observed in the Pt3Sn crystal.20 This is because of the formation of small particles of Pt3Sn alloy. Both the coexistence of a small fraction of Pt-Sn phase and the interference of Pt and Sn scattering resulted in relatively large R-factors.

The EXAFS oscillations of 1P1Sn/SiO2_1273 K were slightly different from those of 1P1Sn/SiO2_773 K and 1P1Sn/SiO2_1073 K. This indicates that the local structure of Pt in 1P1Sn/SiO2_1273 K was different from that of 1P1Sn/SiO2_773 K and 1P1Sn/SiO2_1073 K. If we consider the XRD patterns of the 1P1Sn/SiO2 catalysts, this is probably because of the increase in the fraction of Pt-Sn phase.
Pt L3- and L2-edge XANES spectra of Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts with various Sn/Pt ratios reduced at 1073 K are shown in Figure 6. The white-line intensities at the Pt L3- and L2-edges of the 3Pt1Sn/SiO2 and 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalysts were lower than those of Pt foil and Pt/SiO2. This result suggests electron donation from Sn to Pt and alloy formation between Pt and Sn. In the case of 1Pt3Sn/SiO2, the absorption band at the Pt L3-edge was shifted slightly to a higher energy and the white-line intensity at the Pt L2-edge was higher than that observed for 3Pt1Sn/SiO2, 1Pt1Sn/SiO2, and Pt foil, which indicates that the electronic state and local environment of Pt on 1Pt3Sn/SiO2 is different from those on 3Pt1Sn/SiO2, 1Pt1Sn/SiO2, Pt/SiO2, and Pt foil.

The k3-weighted EXAFS spectra at the Pt L3-edge are shown in Figure 7 A. The EXAFS oscillations of the 3Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalyst were similar to those of Pt foil, although the intensity of the oscillations was much weaker. The peak around 0.25 nm in the FTs of the EXAFS spectra of the 3Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalyst is assignable to the PtPt linkage. A smaller PtPt contribution than that observed for the Pt foil indicates that small Pt nanoparticles (≈1.7 nm) were formed on 3Pt1Sn/SiO2.The EXAFS oscillations of the 1Pt3Sn/SiO2 catalyst were significantly different from those of 3Pt1Sn/SiO2, Pt/SiO2, and Pt foil, and the oscillation period was slightly different from that observed for 1Pt1Sn/SiO2. The two peaks at around 0.21 and 0.27 nm in the FTs of its EXAFS spectra (Figure 7 B) are attributed to the conjunction of PtSn and PtPt bonds in the Pt-Sn alloy phase. These results indicate that the contents of Pt-Sn alloys of 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1073 K and 1Pt3Sn/SiO2_1073 K were larger than that of 3Pt1Sn/SiO2_1073 K. The different types of Pt-Sn alloy as well as their proportions led to the slightly different spectra of 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1073 K and 1Pt3Sn/SiO2_1073 K, consistent with the XRD results.

Sn K-edge XANES spectra of 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalysts reduced at 773, 1073, and 1273 K and reference samples (Sn foil and SnO2) are shown in Figure 8.

The absorption edge position of the 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalysts was higher than that of Sn foil and slightly lower than that of SnO2. Moreover, the intensity decreased with increasing reduction temperature. These results suggest that a mixture of Sn and Sn cations (SnII and SnIV) was present on the 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalysts, and that the ratio of Sn0/(SnII and SnIV) increased with the reduction temperature.

The k3-weighted EXAFS spectra at the Sn K-edge are shown in Figure 9 A. The 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalysts reduced at 773, 1073, and 1273 K exhibited almost identical EXAFS oscillations. A peak at around 0.16 nm assignable to the SnO linkage was observed in the FTs of their EXAFS oscillations (Figure 9 B), which suggests the formation of Sn oxides (SnO or SnO2). The weak peaks around 0.2–0.3 nm in the FTs of the EXAFS oscillations of the 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalysts suggests the contribution of the SnPt linkage as a result of the formation of a Pt-Sn alloy phase. Indeed, the EXAFS data for 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1073 K were fitted well by assuming two shells (SnO and SnPt linkages). The SnO distance (0.203 nm) estimated by curve-fitting analysis was similar to the crystallographic value for SnO2 (rSnO=0.2052 nm) and smaller than that of SnO (rSnO=0.2153 nm; data not shown). The number of O atoms that surround Sn atoms in 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1073 K was 4.1, which is smaller than that of SnO2 (NO=6), probably because of amorphous SnO2 phases and nanoparticles different from bulk SnO2. These results indicate that Pt-Sn alloy particles were present alongside highly dispersed SnO2 on the 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalysts.

The catalysts exhibited a similar edge position, which was higher than that of Sn foil but lower than that of SnO2. The intensity decreased with increasing Sn/Pt ratio. These results suggest that a mixture of Sn0 and Sn cations (SnII and SnIV) was present on these Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts and that the extent of alloying increased with the Sn/Pt ratio.

The k3-weighted EXAFS spectra at the Sn K-edge for Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts with different Pt/Sn ratios reduced at 1073 K are shown in Figure 11 A. The peak assignable to a SnO linkage at around 0.16 nm was observed in the EXAFS oscillation FTs of the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts regardless of the Sn/Pt ratio (Figure 11 B). Moreover, the intensities of the peaks around 0.2–0.3 nm, which imply alloy formation between Pt and Sn, decreased with increasing Sn/Pt ratio. The EXAFS oscillations of the 3Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalyst were clearly different from those of 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 and 1Pt3Sn/SiO2. As mentioned above, the interference of the scattered electrons by Pt and Sn atoms with each other in Pt-Sn catalysts can diminish EXAFS oscillations. Therefore, these results indicated that Pt-Sn alloy particles were present alongside highly dispersed SnO2 on the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts and that the extent of alloying between Pt and Sn increased with the Sn/Pt ratio. Furthermore, based on the XRD patterns of the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts, the ratio of the Pt-Sn phase to Pt3Sn phase also caused the observed change in the EXAFS oscillations.

XPS analysis of Pt-Sn/SiO2
The Pt 4f and Sn 3d XPS spectra of 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalysts reduced at 773, 1073, and 1273 K are shown in Figure 12 A and B, respectively. The binding energies of the Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 peaks were 71.6 and 74.8 eV, respectively, and the position of these peaks did not change with the reduction temperature. Based on these binding energies, the valence of Pt in the 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalysts was assigned as Pt0. The binding energy of the Sn 3d5/2 peaks was located at 486.5 eV, higher than the values usually reported for metallic Sn (484.9 eV) and lower than those typically reported for Sn oxides (487.1 eV). This suggests the coexistence of metallic Sn and Sn oxides on the 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalysts regardless of reduction temperature. Deconvolution of the Sn 3d XPS spectra of the 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalysts revealed that the surface ratios of Sn0/SnIV on the catalysts reduced at 773, 1073, and 1273 K were 33:67, 33:67, and 34:66, respectively. This result further confirmed that part of the Sn formed Pt-Sn alloy and part was present as small, highly dispersed SnO2 particles.

The Pt 4f and Sn 3d XPS spectra of Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts with various Sn/Pt ratios are shown in Figure 13 A and B, respectively. The binding energies of the Pt 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 peaks were 71.6 and 74.8 eV, respectively, which were assigned to Pt0. In the case of the Sn 3d region, the intensity of the Sn 3d5/2 peak increased with the Sn/Pt ratio. It is also clear that the binding energies of the Sn 3d5/2 peak shifted to higher energy with increasing Sn/Pt ratio, which indicates a decrease in the surface Sn0/SnIV ratio. The surface ratios of Sn0/SnIV on the catalysts with 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1 Sn/Pt ratios were determined to be 53:47, 33:67, and 24:76, respectively, from the deconvolution results. Thus, the fraction of SnO2 increased with Sn/Pt ratio. This observation is consistent with the Sn K-edge XAFS results discussed above.

To elucidate the change in the surface Sn/Pt ratio with bulk Sn/Pt ratio, the surface Sn/Pt ratios of the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts were estimated from the areas in the Pt 4f and Sn 3d XPS results. The surface Sn/Pt atomic ratio against the bulk Sn/Pt atomic ratio (nominal Sn/Pt ratio) for PSn/SiO2 reduced at 1073 K is plotted in Figure 14. The surface Sn/Pt atomic ratios of all of the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts were found to be much higher than the corresponding bulk Sn/Pt values. This result indicates that surface enrichment with Sn species took place on the surface of the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts regardless of the initial Sn/Pt ratio. The effect of reduction temperature on the surface Sn/Pt ratio of the 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalysts is shown in Figure 15. The surface Sn/Pt ratios were larger than the bulk values for all of the 1Pt1Sn/SiO2 catalysts, which indicates Sn enrichment at the surface even with a high reduction temperature. This behavior may be explained by the nature of Sn, which has a lower surface energy than Pt. Similar results have been observed for the Pt-Sn/C prepared by Kim et al.17

Discussion
Based on all of the above characterization results, the effects of the Sn/Pt ratio and reduction temperature on the structure of the series of Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts prepared by DR are presented in Scheme 1. Structural characterization showed clearly that the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts possessed a Pt-Sn alloy (1–3 nm) core structure with a Sn-rich surface and that the structure of the Pt-Sn alloy was influenced by the reduction temperature and the Sn/Pt ratio. Moreover, highly dispersed SnO2 coexisted with Pt-Sn alloy particles.

The effects of Sn/Pt molar ratio and reduction temperature on the structure of Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts.
At a low reduction temperature (773 K), Pt-Sn alloys with a low Sn/Pt ratio (PtxSny alloys (x/y≥3) with an fcc structure, cf. Pt0.84Sn0.16) were formed mainly. The surface of the Pt-Sn alloy particles was covered partially with highly dispersed SnO2 (Scheme 1).The content of Sn in the Pt-Sn alloy (the x/y value) increased with the reduction temperature. As a result, Pt3Sn alloy particles existed mainly on 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1073 K together with a small fraction of Pt-Sn alloy particles. This indicates that a higher reduction temperature is suitable for the generation of relatively Sn-rich Pt-Sn alloys. At a high reduction temperature (1273 K), Pt-Sn alloy, the structure of which is hexagonal close packed (hcp), was formed mainly. The low catalytic activity of 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1273 K suggests that the Pt-Sn phase is not active in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, or at least its activity is significantly lower than that of Pt3Sn clusters. Conversely, mainly Pt3Sn alloy nanoparticles were formed on the 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1073 K catalyst, which showed the highest activity among the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts tested. These results are consistent with previous reports, in which superior catalytic performance was assigned to the Pt3Sn alloy phase over other Pt-Sn alloy phases (PtSn4, PtSn2, Pt2Sn3, PtSn, and Pt3Sn).4, 21
The Sn/Pt ratio affected the Pt-Sn alloy structure, particle size, and the surface Sn/Pt ratio of the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts strongly. For the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts reduced at 1073 K, the content of Sn in the PtxSny alloy increased with the nominal Sn/Pt ratio, and a modest increase in particle size was observed on the catalysts if the initial Sn/Pt ratio was in the range of 1/3–2. However, if the initial Sn/Pt ratio was 3, Pt-Sn alloy was observed mainly and the size of the Pt-Sn alloy particles was increased remarkably regardless of the reduction temperature. The CO adsorption and XPS results indicated surface Sn enrichment. It was found that Sn did not alloy with Pt in the impregnation step of the DR preparation, and that some of the Sn interacted with Pt to form the Pt-Sn alloy during the high-temperature reduction. However, the Sn did not alloy with Pt completely even after reduction at 1273 K. The Sn K-edge XAFS spectra showed that nonalloyed Sn was present as Sn oxide (SnO2), and the XPS results suggest that this nonalloyed Sn is located preferentially on the surface of the Pt-Sn alloy particles. Moreover, nonalloyed Sn was also formed on 3Pt1Sn/SiO2, the nominal Sn/Pt ratio of which was equal to the stoichiometric proportions of Pt3Sn alloy, which suggests that surface Sn enrichment is inevitable on Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts prepared by DR.
Supported bimetallic Pt-Sn alloys have been applied widely to various reactions, such as reforming, refining, and hydrogenation, to obtain high activity, selectivity, and to improve the dispersion of Pt and stability against coke deposition. The role of Sn in Pt-Sn alloy catalysts has been interpreted as a modification of the geometric and electronic structures of Pt atoms through PtSn interactions.
In terms of geometry, the XRD and Pt L-edge and Sn K-edge XAFS results indicated that the geometric environment of Pt changed with the addition of Sn to the Pt crystallites (fcc) by forming a solid solution of PtxSny alloy phase (fcc, x/y≥3), which was accompanied by lattice-constant expansion. Such elongation of the bonding structure may affect catalytic reaction pathways that require specific geometric arrangements of the surface atoms, and thus lead to changes in catalytic properties. Alcala et al.22 performed DFT calculations and reported that surface transition species derived from ethanol on a Pt (1 1 1) plane through the cleavage of CC and CO bonds are sensitive to geometric parameters, that is, bond lengths and angles. They mentioned that the extended lattice parameter of the Pt may facilitate CC cleavage, which thus improves its catalytic activity for the electro-oxidation of alcohols and the dehydrogenation of alkanes. On the contrary, in our case, the addition of Sn results in the improvement of propane conversion without a decrease in the selectivity and lattice-constant expansion by the formation of Pt-Sn alloy. This suggests that the simple geometry effect is not appropriate to explain the positive effect of Sn.
In terms of modification of the electronic structure of the bimetallic Pt-Sn alloy system, the most noticeable change would be the charge transfer from Sn atoms to neighboring Pt atoms. Generally, it has been reported that Pt atoms in Pt-Sn alloys become more electron rich as a result of electron donation from Sn to Pt. The changes observed in the XPS, and Pt L3- and L2-edge XANES spectra on the addition of Sn demonstrate the charge transfer from Sn to Pt. This electronic modification of the unfilled d band states of Pt atoms may cause a weaker bond between carbon atoms and surface Pt atoms, which thereby reduces or prevents the strong adsorption of intermediates and products, in other words, catalyst poisoning. The ability of the Pt catalyst to adsorb other molecules such as hydrogen and propylene might be diminished simultaneously. However, this negative effect on the adsorption of molecules that coexist with propane would compromise the beneficial effects of poison tolerance and inhibition of side reactions, which include cracking, isomerization, and coke formation, during dehydrogenation processes.
Conversely, Ramallo-López and co-workers19 reported an increase in the number of Pt 5d holes because of a d, s, p rehybridization process on Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalysts prepared from a platinum amine complex ([Pt(NH3)4]2+) and SnBu4 using Pt L3- and L2-edge XANES. They concluded that the formation of PtSn bonds leads to an increase in the population of Pt 6s and 6p electrons and a decrease in that of Pt 5delectrons, which results in the transformation of electrons around Pt into PtSn bonds. Jeon et al.23 also showed that the 5d electron population of Pt atoms in a Pt-Sn alloy is smaller than that in metallic Pt. Further research and discussion on the electronic state of Pt, which includes 5d holes, is necessary because the electronic state may depend on the mechanism of the incorporation of Sn into the Pt-Sn alloy, which is related closely to the Pt and Sn precursors, catalyst preparation method, and Sn/Pt ratio.
Moreover, on the basis of DFT calculations of Pt-Sn alloy models, Yang et al.24 found that the d band of Pt was broadened with increasing Sn content, which gave rise to a downshift in the d-band center of the Pt-Sn alloy model. Consequently, the bonding strength of propyl and propylene on the Pt-Sn alloy model was lowered. As a result, the Pt3Sn catalyst exhibited a lower energy barrier for propylene desorption and a higher activation energy for propylene dehydrogenation with respect to Pt. Xin et al.18 also reported that alloy formation triggers a change in the width of the d band localized on Pt and does not lead to significant charge transfer between the constituent metal elements in the alloys. They demonstrated that the width of the local d band is a function of the local geometry and the spatial extent of the valence orbitals of the atoms. The change in the width of the d band, which is related to its center, probably affects the absorption ability and reactivity of the catalyst.
Usually, Pt-Sn alloy modes that have a uniform structure are used in DFT calculations. However, the structural characterization in this work has shown that Sn enrichment took place on the surface of the Pt-Sn alloy nanoparticles, which were covered partially with nonalloyed SnO2 (highly dispersed SnO2). Although this indicates that further investigations into the interaction between Pt-Sn alloy nanoparticles and nonalloyed SnO2 and the catalytic function of nonalloyed SnO2 in the dehydrogenation of propane are required, until now their existence is still unclear. Miura and co-workers 3e reported that Pt supported on SnO2-Al2O3 prepared by a sol–gel method (a large excess of Sn was present on the catalyst) showed a high catalytic activity for the dehydrogenation of n-butane to butadiene. They concluded that highly dispersed Sn oxides on the support surface retarded side reactions, and that the Sn-rich Pt-Sn alloy particles formed on the SnO2-Al2O3 support showed high catalytic activity. In the case of 1Pt1Sn/SiO2_1073 K, an excess of SnO2 may suppress side reactions as well as Pt/SnO2-Al2O3, and the Pt3Sn alloy nanoparticles showed a high catalytic activity. In the future, further investigation is expected to clarify the role of the oxidized Sn on the catalysis.
Conclusions
Although Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts for the dehydrogenation of propane have been studied widely, the nature of their structure and the active site are still unclear. In the present work, a series of SiO2-supported Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts were prepared using a direct reduction method and tested for the dehydrogenation of propane. The Sn/Pt ratio and reduction temperature were found to affect the bulk and surface properties of the obtained Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts strongly as well as their catalytic behaviors. Different Pt-Sn alloys were formed with different Sn/Pt ratios and reduction temperatures. Sn was found to alloy with Pt incompletely, and the nonalloyed Sn species existed as an oxidized phase and was located preferentially on the catalyst surface. The highest activity for propane dehydrogenation was obtained for the catalysts with PtxSny (x/y>3) and Pt3Sn alloys, in which Pt became more electron rich. The structure–reactivity relationship of the Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts illustrates the importance of increased Pt atom d electron population in the dehydrogenation of propane.
Experimental Section
Preparation
Silica (JRC-SIO-9, 334 m2 g−1) was used as the support for the preparation of the Pt-Sn catalysts. Prior to impregnation, the SiO2 support was treated at 773 K for 3 h in air. Pt/SiO2 was prepared by impregnating the SiO2 support with an adequate volume of aqueous H2PtCl6⋅6 H2O (3 wt % Pt), stirring at 353 K for 3 h, and then drying at 353 K for 20 h. The precipitate was denoted as Pt/SiO2 precursor. A bimetallic Pt-Sn/SiO2 precursor was prepared by sequential impregnation. The precursors were added to acetone solutions of SnCl2⋅2 H2O (Wako, 97 %), stirred at 353 K for 3 h, and dried at 353 K for 20 h. The molar ratios of Sn to Pt used were 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1. Prior to catalytic experiments, the catalyst precursor was reduced in situ in 20 vol % H2 diluted with N2 (total flow rate 50 mL min−1) at the designated temperature for 1 h. Finally, the catalyst was cooled to 773 K in N2 (100 mL min−1). The obtained catalysts were denoted xPtySn/SiO2_z K, in which x and y indicate the molar ratio of Pt to Sn and z is the reduction temperature.
Reaction
Propane dehydrogenation was performed in a quartz reactor (internal diameter=10 mm) at atmospheric pressure with 20 vol % of propane diluted with N2 at 773 K. The total flow rate was 100 mL min−1. The catalyst precursor (50 mg) was placed between quartz wool. The gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) was 24 L h−1 g−1. The composition of gas was analyzed by using an on-line gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8 A, Japan) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD; 5 Å molecular sieve column) and methanizer flame ionization detector (FID; Porapak-Q column) detectors.
Characterization
All characterization was performed on catalysts after in situ reduction in a H2 atmosphere. BET specific surface areas were estimated from N2 isotherms obtained by using a BELSORP 28SA (BEL Japan, Osaka, Japan) at 77 K. The analyzed samples were evacuated at 573 K for 3 h prior to the measurements.
CO adsorption is a method used very frequently for the characterization of Pt-based catalysts. It can be used to quantify the active surface area of supported Pt catalysts, determine the metal dispersion,25 and study the interaction between Pt and the support or other promoters.26 The amount of CO adsorbed on the catalysts at RT was determined by the CO pulse method by using an Okura BP-2 instrument (Okura Riken, Japan) interfaced with a TCD. Prior to CO adsorption, the catalyst precursor was reduced in situ in 20 vol % H2 diluted with N2 (total flow rate 50 mL min−1) at the designated temperature for 1 h. The stoichiometric ratio of Pt/CO was assumed as 1:1 for the calculation of the accessible surface Pt atoms on the catalysts.
XRD patterns were obtained by using a MultiFlex DR powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) with CuKα radiation (λ=1.5405 Å). The samples were scanned from 2 θ=38–46° at a scanning resolution of 0.01°.
High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were obtained by using a JEOL JEM-3200FS transmission electron microscope. The samples were prepared by depositing drops of ethanol suspensions that contained small amounts of the powders onto carbon-coated copper grids (Okenshoji Co. Ltd.), followed by evaporation of the ethanol in air.
X-ray absorption experiments were performed at BL01B1 of SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan). The ring energy was 8 GeV, and the stored current was 99.5 mA. Pt L3- and L2-edge (11.56 and 13.27 keV) X-ray absorption spectra were recorded in air at RT by using a Si (1 1 1) monochromator in transmission mode. Sn K-edge (29.19 keV) X-ray absorption spectra were recorded in air at RT by using a Si (3 1 1) monochromator in fluorescence mode. The data processing was performed using the REX2000 Ver.2.5.9 (Rigaku) and FEFF8.40 programs.
XPS spectra were acquired by using an ULVAC PHI 5500MT instrument. The spectra were measured using MgKα radiation (15 kV, 400 W) in a chamber at a base pressure of ∼10−7 Pa. All spectra were calibrated using C 1s (284.6 eV) as a reference. Peak fitting was performed for Sn 3d5/2 using XPSPeak 4.1 software (UK Surface Analysis Forum). The Shirley function was used for background subtraction.
