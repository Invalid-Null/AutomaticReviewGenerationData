 Unfortunately this document does not contain enough details related to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) to extract meaningful information about catalyst performance. The document mainly discusses mixing and segregation behaviors in a fluidized bed reactor containing binary mixtures of particles, without providing specifics on catalyst composition, conversion, selectivity, or other key metrics for PDH/ODH.
