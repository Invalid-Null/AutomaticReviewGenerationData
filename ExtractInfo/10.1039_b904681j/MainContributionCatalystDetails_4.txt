The document discusses ceria-based catalysts for selective hydrogen combustion, not propane dehydrogenation specifically. While it mentions propane dehydrogenation briefly, the focus is on using selective hydrogen combustion to remove hydrogen produced during propane dehydrogenation, rather than improving propane dehydrogenation itself. There is no discussion of enhancing the performance of propane dehydrogenation catalysts.
