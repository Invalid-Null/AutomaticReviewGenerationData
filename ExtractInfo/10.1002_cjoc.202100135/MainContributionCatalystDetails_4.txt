The given document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically for the conversion of propane to propylene. It examines the catalytic properties of CeO2 for propane dehydrogenation in general. While it provides insights into factors affecting the catalytic performance of CeO2, it does not focus on or contribute to improvements in PDH or ODH catalysts, processes, or reactor designs.
