Effect of reduction temperature on the activity of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation
Due to the growing attention toward the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) process, the understanding of Pt-containing bimetallic catalysts, especially Pt-Sn systems that are widely applied in PDH, is essential for improving the efficiency of PDH. While the reduction of PtSn catalysts for PDH process is crucial, it has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this study, we prepared Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts with 3 wt. % Pt and 4.5 wt. % Sn loadings and reduced these catalysts at different temperature of 100–600 ℃. The prepared catalysts were characterized via H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), CO-diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Their catalytic activity for PDH was also evaluated. As the reduction temperature increased, the catalytic activity also increased. The catalyst reduced at 300 ℃ exhibited the highest conversion of propane. However, beyond the reduction temperature of 300 ℃, propane conversion decreased. Based on XRD results, as the reduction temperature increased, Pt particles of the calcined catalyst were transformed to Pt3Sn alloys and then to PtSn alloys, which were sintered at higher reduction temperatures. Based on characterization studies, the decrease in catalytic activity at higher reduction temperatures could be attributed to the formation and sintering of PtSn as well as the blocking of Pt-Sn particles by Sn species. TPR and CO-DRIFTS results suggested that the moderate interaction between Pt and Sn was more suitable for PDH reaction. The optimized reduction temperature of 300 ℃ obtained in this study that was lower than the commercially adopted reaction conditions could trigger the optimal reduction process design for PDH.
1. Introduction
Propylene is the one of the most important chemical intermediates that is widely used in various industries. However, due to the increasing demand for propylene, traditional steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking technologies [1] can no longer support the supply of propylene. In view of this, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has been identified as an emerging technology for the production of propylene that can potentially fill the gap between propylene supply and demand. This is attributed to the decreasing price of propane sources due to shale gas exploitation and the high propylene yield achievable by PDH compared to the other conventional technologies [2]. Due to the highly endothermic nature of PDH, a high reaction temperature is required to achieve excellent conversion and propylene yield, resulting in the formation of coke [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Pt-based catalysts are the most commonly used catalysts for PDH. Numerous research works have been conducted to evaluate the activity, selectivity, and stability of Pt-based catalysts, mainly involving the addition of second metals, such as Sn, Ga, Cu, and In to Pt [9], [10], [11]. As Sn is used as the promoter in commercial Pt-based catalysts for PDH [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], the understanding of Pt-Sn bimetallic catalysts is essential for improving the performance and efficiency of PDH.
Although various works have reported the incorporation of Pt-Sn systems for the PDH process, the main active phase of these Pt-containing bimetallic species has yet to be identified. Shan [21] reported that Pt was more active than Pt3Sn and PtSn alloys. Siri [22] concluded that PtSn was inactive while Pt3Sn showed a higher activity during the butane dehydrogenation process based on extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses. Similarly, Deng [23] reported that Pt3Sn demonstrated a higher PDH activity than PtSn through X-ray diffraction (XRD) and EXAFS analyses. Using discrete Fourier transform calculations, Yang [24] concluded that the highest dehydrogenation activity was exhibited by Pt, followed by Pt3Sn and Pt2Sn. In contrast, Cortright [25], [26], [27] reported that PtSn was an active butane dehydrogenation species based on the Mössbauer spectroscopy analysis. Stagg [28] observed that Pt formed coke rapidly and was deactivated when used without the Pt-Sn alloy, and reported that the PtSn catalyst showed a higher activity than Pt during isobutane dehydrogenation. Based on XRD analysis conducted before and after the hydrogenation reaction, Vu [29] classified PtSn as an active species but Pt3Sn as an inactive species. Pham [30] also noted that Pt3Sn demonstrated a strong tendency to sinter after the hydrogenation reaction.
For heterogeneous catalysts, reduction temperature is an important factor affecting the activity of the surface alloy species in bimetal catalysts. Rimaz [31] studied the effect of reduction temperature in Pt-Ge catalysts and concluded that PtGe was less active than Pt during butane dehydrogenation. Rakshit [32] varied the reduction temperature during the hydrogenation of acetic acid for ethanol production and elucidated that the PtSn alloy was the active phase, and that high reduction temperatures favored the activity of Pt-Sn catalysts. Zhang [33] reported that the formation of PtSn improved the conversion and selectivity for ethanol during hydrogenation. By evaluating the effects of reduction temperature on the activity of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 and Pt-Sn/CeO2-Al2O3 catalysts, Serrano-Ruiz [34] found that higher reduction temperatures caused an initial activity increase during crotonaldehyde hydrogenation. It was also found that when the reduction temperature for crotonaldehyde hydrogenation increased [35], [36], the catalytic activity of Pt/ZnO catalysts decreased but the selectivity to crotyl alcohol increased. This was attributed to the alloy formation between Pt and Zn and the migration of reducible oxide onto the metal surface.
As the type of Pt-Sn alloys formed depends on the reduction temperature, PtSn catalysts with different alloy compositions can be prepared by varying the reduction temperature. Therefore, it is important to study the effect of reduction temperature on the PDH performance of PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts.
In this study, PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared via the impregnation method, where the calcined fresh PtSn/Al2O3 were reduced in H2 at different temperatures. The prepared PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), XRD, XPS, CO-diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), Raman spectroscopy, and H2-temperature programmed reduction (TPR). The catalytic performance of the prepared PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts during the PDH reaction was evaluated.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Al2O3-supported Pt-Sn catalysts with 3 wt. % Pt and 4.5 wt. % Sn loadings were prepared using hydrogen hexachloroplatinate(IV) hydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O, Kojima Chemicals) and tin(II) chloride (SnCl2, Sigma-Aldrich, > 98 %) via a co-precipitation method with deionized water. The catalysts were dried with air at 110 °C for 12 h in an oven and then calcined at 600 °C for 4 h at a heating rate of 5 °C/min. The prepared catalysts were denoted as PtSn. In order to evaluate the effects of reduction temperature on the reaction characteristics of the catalysts, the PtSn catalysts were reduced in H2 at 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 °C for 10 min. The time required to achieve each reduction temperature was 1 h. Purging was performed for 30 min after the 10-min reduction at each catalytic reduction temperature. The reduced catalysts were identified according to their reduction temperature. For example, the Pt-Sn catalyst reduced at 100 °C was identified as PtSn-100. The catalyst that was not reduced in H2 was denoted as PtSn-w/o red.
2.2. Catalytic performance
The catalytic activity of the catalysts during the PDH reaction was evaluated in a fixed-bed quartz reactor (inner diameter: 18 mm) using 0.3 g of catalyst. The PDH reaction was performed at 550 °C for 3 h under atmospheric pressure in the presence of C3H8 (30 mL/min), H2 (30 mL/min), and N2 (70 mL/min). Before the PDH reaction, the catalyst samples were heated to 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 °C for 60 min in the presence of H2 (30 mL/min) and N2 (100 mL/min). The product gases were analyzed using a gas chromatography apparatus (flame ionization detector, YL6500 GC System, YL Instrument, Republic of Korea) equipped with a capillary column (GS-Gaspro, Agilent Technologies, USA, inner diameter: 0.32 mm, length: 30 m). The propane conversion, propylene selectivity, and propylene yield were calculated using (1), (2), and (3), respectively:

2.3. Characterization
The crystalline phases of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 and reduced Pt-Sn/Al2O3 were examined using an X-ray diffractometer (D’Max 2500/PC, Rigaku, Japan) operating at 40 kV and 200 mA. The scan was performed in the angular range of 2θ = 20–90° at a scanning rate of 4°/min.
Metal dispersion was measured via CO chemisorption using the ASAP2020C volumetric analyzer (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA). A fixed amount of each catalyst (0.1 g) was treated under He gas flow at 110 °C for 0.5 h. The pretreated catalysts were subsequently heated from 25 °C to 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 °C under pure H2 flow for reduction. After reduction, the catalysts were cooled to 35 °C, before CO pulse chemisorption was performed using 10 % CO/He. CO gas was continuously injected onto the catalysts until CO adsorption could no longer be achieved. The amount of CO adsorbed was measured using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The metal dispersion of each catalyst was calculated from the amount of CO adsorbed by taking the stoichiometric factor for CO/Ptatm as 1, as expressed in Eq. (4):
(4)
where

is the Pt fraction relative to the total weight of the sample.
H2-TPR was performed to examine the reducing behavior of the fresh and treated catalysts at varying reduction temperatures using the AutoChem II 2910 instrument (Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, USA). 0.1 g of each sample was filled in a U-shaped quartz reactor before measurement. To remove impurities and moisture, the temperature in the reactor was raised from room temperature to 200 °C at 10 °C/min before heat treatment was performed for 1 h using Ar gas. After heat treatment, the sample was cooled to room temperature. H2-TPR was performed by raising the temperature to 850 °C at 10 °C/min using 10 % H2/Ar at a flow rate of 50 mL/min. H2 consumption was continuously monitored and recorded as a function of reduction temperature using the TCD.
DRIFTS characterization was performed using an infrared spectrometer (Frontier, Perkin Elmer, USA) equipped with an MCT detector and a high-temperature environmental chamber (Pike Technology) with a ZnSe window. Spectrum collection was performed under the diffuse reflection mode. The samples were ground into fine powders using mortar and pestle, and subsequently packed into sample cups. The samples were pretreated with He at 200 mL/min for 30 min. They were then heated with 5 % H2/He at room temperature, 200, 300, and 400 ℃ for 10 min. After pretreatment, each CO-DRIFTS sample was exposed to 1 % CO/Ar for 30 min for adsorption, and subsequently to Ar for 30 min for desorption. A DRIFTS spectrum collected after pretreatment in He was used as the background for each sample.
TEM images were obtained using Tecnai G2–20 S-Twin and Titan™ 80–300 (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) operating at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. TEM mapping images were obtained using a transmission electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA).
To analyze the chemical states of the elements, XPS spectra were obtained using the PHI 5000 VersaProbe spectrometer (ULVAC-PHI) equipped with a monochromatic electroanalyzer (Kanagawa, Japan) and a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source at 150 W.
After the reaction, the Raman spectra of the samples were collected at room temperature using the inVia Raman microscope (Renishaw, UK) based on the flash exposure method to analyze the structure of the coke deposited on the catalyst surface. Raman shifts in the range of 0–4000 cm−1 were measured with an exposure time of 10 s using a 532-nm Ar laser beam, and Raman shifts in the range of 800–2200 cm−1 were analyzed.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic activity
Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts with 3 wt. % Pt and 4.5 wt. % Sn loadings prepared at different reduction temperatures and without reduction were obtained. The performance of these catalysts in the PDH reaction conducted at 550 ℃ was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 1, reducing the PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts with H2 significantly affects their catalytic performance. Without reduction, the PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst exhibits a poor catalytic performance with an initial propane conversion of 4.7 % and a propylene selectivity of 97 %. The propane conversion subsequently decreases to 2.6 % after 180 min. In contrast, the reduced PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts demonstrate enhanced catalytic performances. Even the catalyst reduced at the lowest temperature of 100 ℃ experiences an increase in propane conversion to 16 % compared to the unreduced catalyst. This catalyst also showcases a propylene selectivity of 99 %, similar to the other reduced catalysts. The catalyst reduced at 300 ℃ exhibits the highest initial propane conversion of 18.6 % and a propylene selectivity of 99 %. Beyond 300 ℃, the initial propane conversion drops with any further increase in the reduction temperature. At a reduction temperature of 500 ℃, the initial propane conversion drops to 10 %, and at 600 ℃, the propane conversion shows a further decrease to approximately 5 %. Based on the results, the optimized reduction temperature for PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts was approximately 300 ℃ as PtSn-300 delivered the best performance for the production of propylene via PDH.

Many studies and tests involving PDH catalysts have been conducted at reduction and reaction temperatures close to 600 °C. In fact, commercial PDH reactors also operate at approximately 600 °C [37]. As PDH is an endothermic reaction, higher reaction temperatures would result in higher conversion rates. However, the optimal temperature should be determined because an extremely high temperature may lower the selectivity of the reaction. The results of this study suggested that the optimal reduction temperature was approximately 300 °C, significantly lower than widely perceived 600 °C. Based on the characterization of these catalysts, we found that the formation of the PtSn alloy with low reactivity and the blocking of Pt particles by Sn species occurred easily at temperatures of 300 °C and higher. The reduction temperature in commercial reactors is higher than 300 °C, possibly due to the formation of water during the reduction process at the beginning of the reaction and the influence of sulfur that may be included in some parts of the reaction [38], [39]. Nevertheless, based on the performance of the Pt-Sn catalysts reduced at different reduction temperatures, one important finding was that the favorable reduction temperature for the PDH reaction was lower than the usually adopted reaction temperature. The reduction conditions were systematically optimized in this study.
Fig. 2 shows the results of the PDH reaction experiment using the Pt-Sn catalyst reduced at 300 °C with reduction times of 10 min and 1 h. At a reduction time of 10 min, the conversion rate was higher than that demonstrated by the catalyst that was reduced for 1 h, but the selectivity at both reduction times were similar.

3.2. Catalyst characterization
3.2.1. TEM
Fig. 3 illustrates the representative TEM images of the PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts treated at various reduction temperatures. At increasing reduction temperatures, the pore size distributions widen and the pore sizes increase, consistent with the CO chemisorption results presented in Section 3.2.3. These results suggested that increasing the reduction temperature led to sintering of the catalyst and the formation of larger particles. Jiang et al. [40] also reported the increase in Ni2P/MCM-41 catalyst particle size at higher reduction temperatures, similar to the results exhibited by our study, further supporting the claim that the sintering of catalysts that occurred at higher reduction temperatures negatively impacted the catalytic activity.

3.2.2. XRD
Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of the PtSn catalysts reduced at different temperatures, where the surface chemical species change according to the reduction temperature. The metallic Pt is observed in the PtSn-w/o red catalyst which is calcined at 600 ℃ as well as the reduced PtSn-200 and PtSn-300 catalysts. The diffraction peaks at approximately 39.76º and 46.24º indicate the presence of metallic Pt particles [41]. When the reduction temperature increases to 400 ℃, the Pt peak disappears, but the formation of Pt3Sn and a small amount of PtSn is observed. The diffraction peak at about 39.16º belongs to the Pt3Sn alloy, while those at about 41.79º and 44.13º belong to the PtSn alloy [42]. Magalheas [43] reported that the diffraction peak of Pt3Sn shifted to a lower value than that of Pt, suggesting that Sn was inserted into the Pt particles. In Pt-Sn catalysts, Pt and Sn exist mostly in the form of PtxSnx alloys (usually PtSn or Pt3Sn) at high reduction temperatures [44], [45]. While Pt-Sn alloys can be found in various forms, such as PtSn, Pt3Sn, and Pt2Sn3 [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], PtSn alloys with a Pt:Sn molar ratio of 1:1 are often reported in PDH catalyst. Deng [23] reported the presence of PtSn in the Pt-Sn/SiO2 catalyst reduced by calcination-reduction for PDH via XRD curves. The Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts by adding K and Li was prepared by Tasbihi and co-workers, and the presence of PtSn for isobutane dehydrogenation [48]. The PtSn alloy in the Pt(PPh3)-Sn/Si catalyst was observed by Liorca and coworkers [49]. Vu [29] reported the presence of Pt3Sn in the catalyst used for PDH via XRD analysis. Sattler [51] also confirmed the presence of Pt3Sn in the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst system for PDH via TEM images. These works suggested that reduction treatment and reaction conditions could affect the formation of PtSn alloys. At the higher reduction temperature of 500 and 600 ℃, the XRD curves depict only the PtSn alloy peak, and the Pt3Sn peak observed in PtSn-400 has disappeared. In addition, increasing the reduction temperature from 500 to 600 ℃ increases the intensity of the PtSn alloy peak, indicating that the PtSn alloy particles were sintered to larger particles. Correlating the XRD patterns with the results of the PDH reaction test, the catalytic activity was the highest when only Pt particles were observed in the XRD graph, indicating that Pt was more active than PtSn during the PDH reaction. PtSn-600, which was reduced at the highest temperature, showcased the lowest catalytic activity due to the presence of the largest PtSn alloy species, indicated by the higher PtSn peaks.

3.2.3. CO chemisorption
Table 1 shows the physical properties of the fresh and reduced PtSn catalysts. The metal dispersion, metal surface area, and average particle size of the catalysts were all calculated from the amount of CO gas chemisorbed to each sample. As the reduction temperature increases, the metal dispersion decreases, but the particle size increases. The activity data and CO adsorption results suggested that at increasing reduction temperatures, the Pt or PtSn alloys, which may serve as catalyst active sites, were sintered, and more Pt particles were blocked by Sn, leading to the decrease in PDH catalytic activity. The amount of CO gas chemisorbed to Pt in PtSn alloys was also reported to be lower than that to Pt metals [23], [28], implying that the formation of the Pt-Sn alloy reduced the amount of CO gas adsorbed.

The amount of CO gas adsorbed to the catalyst that was reduced at 200 ℃ (PtSn-200) was higher than that of the catalyst that did not undergo reduction (PtSn-w/o red). This could be caused by the higher exposure to metallic Pt at 200 °C due to the partial reduction of oxygen and Pt oxide on the catalyst surface. Although PtSn-200 demonstrated a lower catalytic activity compared to PtSn-300, PtSn-200 showcased a higher metal dispersion, indicating that the electronic effect of Sn on Pt may act in PtSn-300, in addition to the effect of metal dispersion. De Miguel [52] reported that the dehydrogenation reactivity of Pt was enhanced by the electronic effect of Ge. The results also indicated that metal clusters in which Pt and Sn interacted moderately, such as Pt3Sn, could be more active than only Pt particles.
3.2.4. TPR
TPR analysis was performed to investigate the interaction between the catalyst support and the metal particles. As shown in Fig. 5, two reduction peaks are clearly observed at approximately 280 °C and 370 °C in both the PtSn-w/o red and PtSn-200 catalysts. In contrast, only one reduction peak at approximately 370 °C has appeared in PtSn-300. A weak peak is observed at a higher temperature of approximately 440 °C in PtSn-400, and no peaks are exhibited by the PtSn-500 and PtSn-600 catalysts. Contreras-Andrade [53] reported that a distinct hydrogen reduction peak between 200 and 300 °C and 350–500 °C could be identified for the Pt-Sn catalyst. The hydrogen consumption of these catalysts is characteristic of the reduction of other PtOx species. Such reduction peaks are frequently observed, and it is generally accepted that the first peak appearing at low temperatures is due to the reduction of the bulk of PtOx, which interacts weakly with alumina. The second peak appearing at a higher temperature is known to be due to the reduction of the species strongly interacting with the support. Several authors have reported that this reduction peak was attributed to the reduction of oxy-, or possibly hydroxychlorided Pt species, which interact strongly with the support [54], [55], [56]. Shi [57] reported that the reduction peak at approximately 250 °C was attributed to the reduction of Pt oxide, and the peaks at higher temperatures of 440 °C and 600 °C were caused by the partial reduction of Sn4+ to Sn2+ and Sn2+ to Sn0, respectively. Wang [58] reported that the reduction peak appearing below 400 °C was due to the reduction of the Pt-O-Sn cluster or the combined reduction of SnOx and PtOx species in close contact, indicating the interaction of the Pt and Sn species. The PtSn-200 catalyst demonstrates its first peak at approximately 277 ℃, indicating its weak interaction with alumina. The PtSn-300 catalyst, which exhibited the best catalytic activity, has a second peak at approximately 370 ℃. From this observation, Pt that interacted moderately with Sn, was deemed the most suitable for catalytic dehydrogenation activity, rather than Pt that interacted too strongly with Al2O3 and Sn. In addition, the peak caused by the reduction from Sn4+ to Sn2+ in the PtSn-400 catalyst appears weak, but the reduction peak attributed to the SnOx species disappears as the reduction temperature increases.

3.2.5. CO-DRIFTS
To evaluate the electronic states of Pt, the adsorption of CO on PtSn catalysts prepared at different reduction temperatures was studied and the results are shown in Fig. 6. In general, two types of CO adsorption can be observed for Pt particles. The linear adsorption of CO on Pt particles is indicated at around 2070 cm−1, while the bridged adsorption of CO on Pt atoms is represented at around 1840 cm−1. Doping Pt with Sn eliminated the bridged CO adsorption, indicating that Pt atoms were separated by Sn atoms for the formation of PtSn bimetallic particles [59]. Ivanova [60] studied the adsorption of CO on reduced Pt/TiO2 catalysts and reported that the band at 2091 cm−1 was assigned to the linearly adsorbed CO on the Pt particles.

Fig. 6. CO-DRIFTS spectra of CO adsorption on PtSn/Al2O3 catalysts prepared at different reduction temperatures.
A peak is observed at 2091–2097 cm−1 in the CO-DRIFTS spectra of all the catalysts, likely caused by the large ensemble of Pt atoms, similar to the large ensemble of exposed low-refractive-index plane. Palazov [61] reported that a CO adsorption band appeared at 2090 cm−1 for 5 % Pt, which shifted to a lower frequency with Sn addition. Arteaga [62] revealed that the position of bands arising from the linear adsorption of CO was a function of the Pt dispersion, and reported that the band at 2080 cm−1 was due to the large ensemble of Pt atoms, similar to the large ensemble of exposed low-refractive-index plane. The peaks observed at 2071 and 2072 cm−1 in the PtSn-300 and PtSn-400 catalysts, respectively, were likely attributed to the highly coordinated Pt atoms in the medium-sized ensemble of Pt atoms. The bands at 2044–2046 cm−1 and around 2007 cm−1 appeared to be caused by the Pt3Sn and PtSn alloys, respectively. These two bands were often reported in Pt-Sn catalysts [23], [29]. Shan [21] reported that downward shifts of 25 cm−1 and 66 cm−1 were observed for the Pt3Sn and PtSn models, respectively, compared to the calculated CO oscillation frequency (ν(C−O)) for Pt(111). CO-infrared bands between 2044 and 2046 cm−1 corresponding to the Pt3Sn alloy are recorded in the PtSn-200, PtSn-300, and PtSn-400 catalysts, with the largest band observed in PtSn-300, which showcased the highest catalytic activity, and the smallest band observed in PtSn-400. The Pt3Sn alloy, which is not observed in the XRD spectrum of PtSn-300 but is shown in its CO-DRIFTS results, seemed to greatly favor the dehydrogenation reaction. The band at 2007 cm−1 attributed to the PtSn alloy is larger at catalysts prepared at higher reduction temperatures, such as PtSn-400, indicating that the PtSn alloy had a negative effect on the catalytic activity. The peaks between 1935 and 1983 cm−1 were assigned to Sn-rich alloys [21]. These results concluded that as the reduction temperature increased, more alloys containing high Sn content, such as Pt3Sn, PtSn, and PtSn2, were formed. These alloys were indicated to adversely affect catalytic activity.
3.2.6. XPS
XPS analysis was performed to confirm the active metal state of each PtSn catalyst treated at different reduction temperatures. The XPS spectra are shown in Fig. 7, while the peak positions of each element and the area and ratio of each peak are summarized in Table 2. Most of the catalysts using Pt as the active metal are usually analyzed at the Pt 4 f region. However, the peak of Pt 4 f overlaps with that of Al 2p [63], causing difficulty in material analysis. As such, we focused on the Pt 4d region for the XPS analysis of samples in this work. Generally, the broad Pt 4d5/2 peak in the Pt 4d spectrum can be resolved into two peaks with binding energies of 316.0–317.1 eV and 314.3–315.5 eV [64]. Peaks with higher binding energy are attributed to the PtO2 species, while peaks with lower binding energy are attributed to the Pt0 species. Analyzing the catalysts at the Pt 4d region, each catalyst treated at different reduction temperatures exhibits a peak at 315.0–315.3 eV. This is similar to the values reported for the position of metallic Pt in previous studies [65]. The Pt oxide was confirmed to be completely reduced in all the catalysts, and the metallic Pt species showed a predominant ratio.

Peaks with lower binding energies of 485.2–486.5 eV corresponded to alloyed Sn, while peaks with higher binding energies of 487.1–487.6 eV corresponded to Sn oxide [66], [67]. These results suggested that Sn oxide was still present after higher reduction treatment and could impact on the Pt particle’s catalytic activity.
The relative surface concentration of Pt and Sn was calculated from the XPS curve area of each element, and is summarized in Table 2. The relative surface concentrations of Pt and Sn are the highest in the PtSn-300 catalyst. These results suggested that Pt and Sn is sintered at the higher reduction temperature than 300 ℃. Especially, Sn0/Sn(total) ratio is rapidly decreased suggesting that alloy phase is more easily sintered.
3.2.7. Raman spectroscopy
Fig. 8 shows the analysis on the coke state of the catalysts after reduction treatment and PDH reaction obtained via Raman spectroscopy. Both catalysts show peaks at 1331 and 1597 cm−1, and the PtSn-300 catalyst with the best reaction activity shows peaks with relatively high strength. According to Yao [68], the peak at 1586 cm−1 was related to the vibration of sp2-bonded C atoms in a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice, indicating the presence of a crystalline graphite phase. The peak appearing at 1354 cm−1 was caused by structural disorder attributed to amorphous C. The peak appearing at 1597 cm−1 was higher than that of perfectly large graphite crystals (i.e. 1575 cm−1), indicating that the coke may be of a C species such as graphite [69]. The intensity ratios (height ratios) of D to G bands indicate the degree of graphitization of the C material, where a high ID/IG value indicates a low degree of graphitization of the C material [70]. The ID/IG values of the PtSn-300, PtSn-400, and PtSn-500 catalysts after the PDH reaction were 3.04, 1.19, and 4.04, suggesting the various types of coke deposited due to the formation of different alloys at different reduction temperatures after the PDH reaction. Based on the XPS analysis, the PtSn-300 catalyst showcased the highest Pt/Al and Sn/Al ratios compared to the other catalysts, and the amount of coke was the highest when Pt and Sn in the metallic or alloy states were the most dispersed.

4. Conclusion
We investigated the effects of reduction temperature on the performance of Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts during the PDH reaction and characterized the catalysts using CO-chemisorption, XRD, TPR, TEM, XPS, Raman spectroscopy, and CO-DRIFTS analysis. The maximum conversion of propane was obtained using the catalyst that was prepared at a reduction temperature of 300 ℃. This temperature was significantly lower than usually adopted reduction temperature of approximately 500–600 ℃. XRD results indicated that Pt particles in the calcined catalysts transformed to Pt3Sn alloys and then to PtSn alloys as the reduction temperature increased. Further increase in the reduction temperature caused the PtSn alloy to be sintered, resulting in the decrease in catalytic activity. As such, the reduction of Sn species and formation of Pt-Sn alloys were proven to occur readily using catalysts prepared at lower reduction temperatures. Above the reduction temperature of 300 ℃, the PtSn alloy, which was less active compared to Pt and Pt3Sn, was formed. CO-chemisorption and TEM analysis also suggested that the dispersion of metal particles decreased as the reduction temperature increased, resulting from either the sintering of particles or the blocking of Pt particles by Sn species. CO-DRIFTS results proved the formation of the Pt-Sn alloy. All the results obtained from this study concluded that the optimization of the reduction temperature was essential for PDH process.
