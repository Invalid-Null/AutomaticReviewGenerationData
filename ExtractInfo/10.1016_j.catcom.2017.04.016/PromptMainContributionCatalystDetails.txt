Deactivation behavior of CrOy/Al2O3-ZrO2 catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene by lattice oxygen




1. Introduction
Propylene is produced through several routes such as metathesis and dehydrogenation of propane [1], [2], [3]. Among these routes, dehydrogenation of propane has attracted much attention as an efficient process for the production of propylene because low-cost propane is supplied due to recent development of shale gas industry [4].
Chromium oxide supported on γ-Al2O3 is known to be an efficient catalytic system in the dehydrogenation of propane due to its superior lattice oxygen mobility properties [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. In an attempt to improve the catalytic activity of CrOy/Al2O3, zirconia was used as promoter, where CrOy/Al2O3-ZrO2 was reported to exhibit excellent catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the absence of molecular oxygen feed using the lattice oxygen present in the catalyst. However, conversion of propane and yield for propylene decreased significantly with time on stream, because CrOy/Al2O3-ZrO2 catalyst retained limited amount of active lattice oxygen. Thus, catalyst regeneration step after dehydrogenation reaction is required to restore lattice oxygen of the catalyst.
It has been reported that the catalytic activity of CrOy/Al2O3 is not completely recovered under severe reaction-regeneration conditions [9]. This is because of the formation of α-chromia-alumina phase, which causes irreversible catalyst deactivation [10]. However, when chromia is inserted into alumina lattice during deactivation, α-chromia-alumina phase is formed due to the fact that both chromia and alumina retain a corundum crystal structure [11], [12]. Therefore, a systematic investigation on the quantitative analysis of α-chromia-alumina phase would be worthwhile to elucidate deactivation behavior of Cr-based catalysts in the dehydrogenation of propane.
In this work, a series of CrOy/Al2O3-ZrO2 catalysts were prepared by a sol-gel method and a subsequent wetness impregnation method with varying Zr/Al molar ratio. The solids were then intentionally deactivated. The effect of Zr/Al molar ratio on the physicochemical properties and deactivation behavior of CrOy/Al2O3-ZrO2 catalysts towards the dehydrogenation of propane by lattice oxygen of the catalysts were investigated. The catalyst was initially investigated to produce propylene by the reaction of propane with lattice oxygen of the catalyst within a very short reaction time (a few seconds) in the absence of oxygen feed. This type of catalyst was designed for use in the “moving-bed straight-through transport reactor” where the catalyst is quickly circulated from the reactor to the regenerator.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
In order to establish a standard procedure for the quantitative analysis of α-chromia-alumina phase, a series of CrOy/Al2O3 catalysts with different chromia content were prepared. γ-Al2O3 support was prepared according to the reported method [4]. For impregnation of chromium species onto γ-Al2O3 support, known amounts of chromium precursor (chromium oxide, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in deionized water (3 ml). Chromium loading was adjusted to be 0, 5, 20, 30, and 40 wt%. The solution containing the chromium precursor was then introduced onto the γ-Al2O3 support by the wetness impregnation method. After the sample was dried at 80 °C for 1 day, it was calcined at 1300 °C for 4 h for artificial thermal deactivation. The prepared catalysts were denoted as MCr/Al (M = 0, 5, 20, 30, and 40) catalysts, where M represents the chromium loading (wt%). Unsupported Cr2O3 was also prepared as a reference by calcining chromium precursor (chromium oxide, Sigma-Aldrich) at 700 °C for 4 h.
A series of CrOy/Al2O3-ZrO2 catalysts were prepared by a sol-gel followed by the wetness impregnation method. For the preparation of Al2O3-ZrO2 supports, known amounts of aluminum precursor (aluminum nitrate nonahydrate, Sigma-Aldrich) and zirconium precursor (zirconium oxynitrate hydrate, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in ethanol at room temperature under stirring. The Zr/Al molar ratio was fixed to be 0, 0.05, 0.07, 0.10, and 0.12. After introducing propylene oxide into the solution to induce gelation of metal species, an opaque gel was obtained. The resultant solid was aged for 1 day and then washed with ethanol. The product was then dried in a convection oven at 80 °C for 3 days. The resulting powder was calcined at 700 °C for 4 h to obtain an Al2O3-ZrO2 support. The prepared supports were denoted as AZ-X (X = 0, 0.05, 0.07, 0.10, and 0.12), where X represents the Zr/Al molar ratio. For the preparation of CrOy/AZ-X catalysts, chromium precursor (chromium oxide, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in deionized water (15 ml) and impregnated onto AZ-X support under stirring at 85 °C. After the supported catalyst was dried at 80 °C for 1 day in a convection oven, it was finally calcined at 1300 °C for 4 h for artificial thermal deactivation. The prepared catalysts were denoted as Cr/AZ-X (X = 0, 0.05, 0.07, 0.10, and 0.12). The chromium loading was 20 wt% in all Cr/AZ-X catalysts.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
ICP-AES (ICPS-1000IV, Shimadzu) analyses were conducted to determine the chemical composition of the catalysts. UV–vis spectra (Mega-900, SCINCO) of the catalysts were collected within the range of 300–800 nm in order to confirm the coordination state of chromium species and the existence of α-chromia-alumina phase. In order to calculate the amount of Cr6 + species present in the catalysts, H2-TPR (temperature-programmed reduction) measurements were conducted. For this, 0.2 g of each catalyst was charged in a U-shaped quartz reactor and reduced with a mixed stream of H2 (2 ml/min) and N2 (20 ml/min). TPR profiles were collected using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) at the heating rate of 5 °C/min. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (D-Max2500-PC, Rigaku) were obtained using Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 1.541 Å) to confirm the degree of peak shift of α-Al2O3 (0 2 4) lattice plane.
2.3. Dehydrogenation of propane to propylene
Dehydrogenation of propane to propylene by lattice oxygen was conducted in a fixed-bed quartz reactor at 630 °C in the absence of oxygen feed. Each catalyst (0.2 g) was charged into the reactor and purged with He flow (24 ml/min). The reactant was pulse-injected at 630 °C for 50 s and the products were simultaneously sampled using a multi-position valve every 5 s. A mixed stream of C3H8 (40 ml/min) and N2 (40 ml/min) was used as a feed and the total feed rate with respect to catalyst weight was kept at 12,000 ml/(h·gcat). Reaction products were analyzed with an on-line gas chromatograph (ACME 6000, Younglin) equipped with a TCD.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Quantitative analysis of α-chromia-alumina
In order to find a relationship between diffraction peak position of α-Al2O3 phase and the amount of α-chromia-alumina phase, XRD measurements were conducted as shown in Fig. 1. Diffraction peak corresponding to α-Al2O3 (0 2 4) lattice plane shifted to a lower diffraction angle with increasing chromium content. Detailed physicochemical properties of thermally deactivated MCr/Al catalysts are listed in Table 1. Actual Cr loading in the MCr/Al catalysts was well matched with the designed value. It was reported [13] that the amount of Cr6 + species can be calculated from H2-TPR measurements. However, it was observed that MCr/Al catalysts did not show a noticeable peak in the H2-TPR measurements. This means that the amount of Cr6 + species on the catalysts was negligible compared to that of α-chromia-alumina. Thus, it is inferred that all chromium species were present in α-chromia-alumina phase in the thermally aged MCr/Al catalysts. It should be noted that lattice constant and d-spacing of α-Al2O3 (0 2 4) lattice plane calculated from the Bragg equation increased with increasing chromium content. Fig. 2 shows the correlation between spacing of α-Al2O3 (0 2 4) lattice plane and Cr/(Cr + Al) content of thermally deactivated MCr/Al catalysts. Among the catalysts, 40Cr/Al shows the largest distance between lattice planes. Thus, it can be inferred that chromium species, which retained larger ionic radius than aluminum species, caused expansion of the crystallite size of α-Al2O3 (0 2 4) lattice plane during the deactivation process. This means that the d-spacing derived from XRD measurements can be used to calculate the amount of α-chromia-alumina in the catalyst.

3.2. Deactivation behavior of Cr/AZ-X catalysts
Physicochemical properties of Cr/AZ-X (X = 0, 0.05, 0.07, 0.10, and 0.12) catalysts were examined (Table S1 of Supporting information). All deactivated Cr/AZ-X catalysts showed very small surface area and pore volume. This is because high-temperature calcination (1300 °C) caused phase transformation of γ-alumina to α-alumina [11]. Cr/AZ-0.07 showed slightly higher surface area among the deactivated catalysts, indicating that the addition of an optimal amount of zirconium hindered sintering of the catalyst. Actual Cr loading in the deactivated Cr/AZ-X catalysts was well matched with the designed value.
In order to confirm the coordination state of chromium species and the presence of α-chromia-alumina phase, UV–vis spectra of Cr/AZ-X (X = 0, 0.05, 0.07, 0.10, and 0.12) catalysts were obtained. According to the literature [14], Cr3 + species in the bulk Cr2O3 show absorption bands at 475 and 614 nm. However, all Cr/AZ-X catalysts exhibited two absorption bands at 404 and 550 nm as shown in Fig. 3. This is because chromium species different from those present in the crystalline α-Cr2O3 phase were formed during the deactivation process. It is believed that peak for α-Cr2O3 phase shifted to lower wavelength because the distance between Cr and O atoms decreased due to the incorporation of Cr species into the alumina lattice [15]. Thus, it was found that chromium species existed as a α-chromia-alumina phase in the thermally deactivated Cr/AZ-X catalysts.

In order to calculate the amount of Cr6 + species in the catalyst, H2-TPR measurements were conducted (Fig. S1 of Supporting information). TPR peak area representing hydrogen consumption was converted into the amount of Cr6 + species in the catalyst [13]. All the catalysts showed a single reduction peak attributed to the reduction of Cr6 + species. The amount of Cr6 + is listed in Table 2. It was found that all the catalysts retained similar amounts of Cr6 + species.

In order to calculate the degree of deactivation of Cr/AZ-X (X = 0, 0.05, 0.07, 0.10, and 0.12) catalysts, XRD measurements were conducted. As shown in Fig. 4, a peak corresponding to the α-Al2O3 (0 2 4) lattice plane shifted to lower diffraction angles, demonstrating that chromium species were incorporated into the alumina lattice during catalyst deactivation. It is noteworthy that the degree of peak shift to lower diffraction angles decreased with increasing Zr/Al molar ratio up to the value of 0.07 and then increased with increasing Zr/Al molar ratio up to 0.12. The decreased diffraction peak position with increasing Zr/Al molar ratio up to 0.07 indicates that chromium species were less incorporated into the alumina support. Relative distribution of each chromium species was calculated from ICP-AES, XRD and H2-TPR results as reported in Table 2. Actual Cr loading in all the catalysts was well matched with the designed value. The amount of total Cr content was calculated from ICP-AES and the amount of deactivated Cr was calculated from the relationship derived from the results as shown in Fig. 2. Among the catalysts, Cr/AZ-0.07 retained the smallest amount of α-chromia-alumina. This indicates that introduction of an optimal amount of zirconium into the alumina support hindered the formation of α-chromia-alumina species. It was also found that the amount of amorphous Cr3 + species increased with increasing Zr/Al molar ratio up to 0.07. It has been reported that amorphous Cr3 + is active for the dehydrogenation of propane [16]. Thus, it is expected that Cr/AZ-0.07 catalyst retaining the largest concentration of Cr3 + species would serve as the most active catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.

3.3. Catalytic performance in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene
Catalytic activity results in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene by lattice oxygen are presented in Fig. 5 in terms of conversion rate of propane per unit surface area (μmol/m2·s). Conversion rate of propane over Cr/AZ-X (X = 0.05, 0.07, 0.10, and 0.12) catalysts was higher than that over Cr/AZ-0 catalyst. This indicates that zirconia hindered the formation of α-chromia-alumina phase. Conversion rate of propane increased in the order of Cr/AZ-0 < Cr/AZ-0.12 < Cr/AZ-0.10 < Cr/AZ-0.05 < Cr/AZ-0.07, which was well consistent with the trend of the amount of amorphous Cr3 + (Table 2). Reaction products obtained after 5 s and 50 s reaction were analyzed (Table S2 of Supporting information). C1-C2 compounds (methane, ethylene, and ethane), CO, and CO2 were produced as by-products together with propylene. Among the catalysts, Cr/AZ-0.07 showed the best catalytic activity after the deactivation process was applied. In other words, suppressing the formation of α-chromia-alumina was essential for maintaining the catalytic activity in the dehydrogenation of propane by lattice oxygen.

4. Conclusions
A series of thermally deactivated CrOy/Al2O3-ZrO2 catalysts (Cr/AZ-X) were prepared, and used in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene by lattice oxygen. The effect of Zr/Al molar ratio on the physicochemical properties and catalytic activity was investigated. UV–vis results revealed that α-chromia-alumina phase was formed in the catalysts after the deactivation process was applied. From ICP-AES and H2-TPR results, it was revealed that the addition of zirconium affected the distribution of chromium species in the catalysts. Through XRD measurements, a quantitative analysis method for α-chromia-alumina was established by calculating the d-spacing for the α-Al2O3 (0 2 4) lattice plane. In the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene, conversion rate of propane per unit surface area increased with decreasing the amount of α-chromia-alumina, indicating that the amount of α-chromia-alumina played an important role in suppressing the catalytic activity. Among the catalysts, Cr/AZ-0.07 catalyst with the lowest amount of α-chromia-alumina (a deactivated chromium species) and the largest amount of active chromium species (Cr3 +) served as the most promising catalyst in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene.
