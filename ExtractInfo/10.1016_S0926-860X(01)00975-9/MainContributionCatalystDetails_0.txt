The document describes silica- and alumina-supported vanadium oxide catalysts prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and impregnation for propane dehydrogenation. However, it does not provide any data on propane dehydrogenation performance or comparison between ALD and impregnated catalysts. The focus is on physicochemical characterization of the catalysts. Therefore, this document does not contain information directly relevant to advances in propane dehydrogenation catalysts or processes.
