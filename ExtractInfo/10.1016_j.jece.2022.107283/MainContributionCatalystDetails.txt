Based on the multiple document extracts provided, there is no information relevant to propane dehydrogenation. All the documents focus on the synthesis and characterization of TiO2/MCM-41 nanocomposite photocatalysts using waste electronic packaging resin for applications in photocatalytic degradation of dyes. No details are provided on converting propane to propylene or oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Therefore, I have indicated that the documents are not relevant and did not include the <IfRelated> section.
