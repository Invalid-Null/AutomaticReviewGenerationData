 Based on my analysis, the document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The catalyst studied is Pt2%Sn0.3%Mg6% supported on gamma-alumina, and it is used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, not propane. The feed gas contains ethane, not propane. Therefore, I assess that this work does not pertain to PDH or ODH of propane to propylene.
