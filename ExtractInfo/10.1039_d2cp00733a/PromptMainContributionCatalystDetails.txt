Revealing the role of HBr in propane dehydrogenation on CeO2(111) via DFT-based microkinetic simulation†
HBr, as a soft oxidant, has been demonstrated to have a good balance between stability and selectivity in catalytic propane dehydrogenation. However, the origin of enhancements induced by HBr (hydrobromic acid) remains elusive. In this study, DFT-based microkinetic simulations were performed to reveal the reaction pathway and performance of propane dehydrogenation catalyzed by CeO2 in the presence of HBr. Three scenarios were under the investigations, which are pristine, dissociated HBr, and Br assisted surface hydroxyl. The calculations indicated that HBr significantly enhanced the adsorption of propane and provided alternative pathways for propene formation. More significantly, the energy barrier of C–H bond activation in propane was reduced with the assistance of HBr. It was very interesting to find that the reactivity of surface hydroxyl remarkably increased for C–H bond activation in the presence of HBr. The positive role of HBr is clearly evident from the microkinetic simulation. The TOFs of both propane conversion and propene formation increased after the introduction of HBr, which correlates with the apparent decreased activation energy. The reaction rate has a first order dependence on C3H8 and zero order dependence on HBr. The current study lays out a solid basis for further optimization of the performance of propane dehydrogenation.
1. Introduction
As one of the leading platform chemicals in the petroleum industry, light olefins such as propylene are widely used in the synthesis of organic derivatives and polymers, and their annual worldwide production is up to 110 megatonnes.1 Propylene is a fundamental material used to produce many chemicals such as polypropylene, acrylonitrile, acetone, epoxy propane, and many more.2,3 It is presently produced by the thermal cracking of naphtha and fluid catalysis of petroleum-based raw materials. However, these processes are thermodynamically limited, give low yields, and demand complex isolation of the desired products.4 Therefore, the search for alternative routes remains an urgent task. With the discovery of large shale gas reservoirs worldwide, the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane has become an attractive route to directly obtain propylene due to the abundance of short alkane resources.5
There are two major routes for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane, namely non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation, respectively. The difference is in whether an oxidant such as oxygen is used or not. For non-oxidative dehydrogenation, an oxidant is not used. The reaction is endothermic and limited by thermodynamics.5 Moreover, coke accumulation is inevitable, which leads to the loss of catalytic capabilities. The use of oxygen changes the reaction to exothermic and significantly reduces the coke formation.6 However, the intermediates and propene can undergo more reactions under oxygen atmosphere due to its strong oxidizing ability, which largely reduces selectivity. To break this dilemma, a class of so-called soft oxidants including CO2, sulfur, and halogens was examined in propane dehydrogenation.7 Compared with oxygen, they possess a mild oxidizing ability, which limits the side reactions to some extent. On the other hand, they are still able to keep the thermodynamics favorable and reduce cokes. Therefore, this is a strategy that takes advantage of both non-oxidative and oxidative dehydrogenation.
Among these soft oxidants, halogen halides (HCl, HBr) are one of the most promising oxidants for propane dehydrogenation.7,8 In particular, it has been reported that yields of ethylene and propene reached 90% and 40%, respectively, which exceeded the requirement for industrial implementation by the oxychlorination of ethane and propane.9 This achievement is indeed rarely reported in other soft oxidants. Moreover, reaction conditions are relatively mild with a temperature of 500 K and atmospheric pressure. Another advantage of the oxyhalogenation of propane is that the halogen can be recovered from the reaction with up to 100% percent halogen efficiency. The choice of halogen halides is of importance. HBr was chosen due to its easy availability and regeneration to Br2 by Deacon's reaction.10,11 Moreover, the weaker C–Br bond than the counterpart of C–Cl enables a lower light-off temperature and enhances product release.
Cerium oxide as a reducible catalyst, is one of the most studied catalysts for the oxybromination of propane, although it might not have the best catalytic performance. The availability of oxygen vacancies on CeO2 has important implications in oxybromination. It has been reported that halide ions are more likely to fill the oxygen vacancies and interact with Ce+3. More importantly, propylene selectivity increased by 5–10% with the addition of halide.9 Although the halogens and their halides significantly improve both selectivity and conversion, the reaction mechanism and the origin of enhancement still remain unanswered. Gong et al. suggested that halogenation hardly affected the C–H bond activation, but instead, just opened new channels.12 These new channels led to the formation of intermediate species. However, it is speculated from DFT calculations that oxyhalide species can serve as active sites for C–H activation.13 Overall, the understandings on the reaction pathway and mechanism are still quite inconclusive.
To address the above-mentioned issues and further deepen the understanding, comprehensive DFT-based microkinetic simulations were performed on the role of HBr in propane dehydrogenation on CeO2 catalysts. The interactions between reactants and catalyst were well calibrated. Based on a careful analysis, the most favorable reaction path is identified, which provides solid evidence on the role of HBr in propane dehydrogenation. Thermo and kinetic parameters of elementary steps involved in the reaction are obtained from DFT calculations, which were used to perform microkinetic simulation. The formation of key intermediate, C3H7Br, is carefully discussed. In addition, two ways of C3H7Br dissociations are proposed. Moreover, the unique role of surface oxygen in the activation of the C–H bond is also discussed. The influence of pressure, temperature, and activation energy on the reaction rate and mechanism were explored. Comparison between pathways without and with HBr clearly indicated the positive role of the halogen in the reaction. The current work gained important insights into the reaction mechanism and effect of halogen, which helps to efficiently design new catalysts for oxidative bromination.
2. Computational details
All the calculations were carried out by the spin-polarized density functional theory with the on-site Coulomb interaction (DFT+U) using the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).14,15 The projected-augmented wave (PAW) method was used to explicate electron–ion interaction.16,17 The exchange correlation functional was used with the Revised Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (RPBE) functional.18 The valence states were described by plane wave basis sets with a cut-off energy of 400 eV. The Brillouin-zone integration was carried out at a 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid for CeO2(111). The description of localized 4f electrons of Ce atom was treated with a method proposed by Dudarev et al.19 The value of Ueff was determined to be 5.5 eV, which has been well tested and computationally fit our calculations for finding the lattice parameter for CeO2. For all optimized structures, the total energy was converged to an accuracy of 1 × 10−5 eV and force tolerance is of 0.03 eV Å−1. The lattice parameter was calculated as 5.46 Å, matching the experimental value as reported a0 ≈ 5.41 and 5.42 Å.20,21 Moreover, the van der Waals correction of the DFT-D3 method was used in the calculations.22
For CeO2(111), a 3 × 3 supercell with nine atomic layers (trilayer O–Ce–O) was prepared (Fig. 1). There are 27 and 54 cerium and oxygen atoms, respectively, which maintain the stoichiometric ratio. All the atomic layers were allowed to relax except one layer (the bottom layer) fixed to the bulk position with a vacuum layer of 10 Å in the z-direction. During structure optimization, the atoms were allowed to relax until the forces were less than 0.03 eV Å−1. The adsorption energy (Eads) was calculated as,
Eads = [Eadsorbate/slab − (Eslab + Eadsorbate)] (1)
where E(adsorbate/slab) is the total energy of interacting species with the surface slab, the Eslab, and Eadsorbate is the individual energy of slab (CeO2 surface) and (adsorbate) isolated C3H8, HBr molecules, respectively. The reaction pathway with the energy barrier was computed by the climbing image nudged elastic band (CINEB) method.23 The transition state was identified by frequency analysis.

The microkinetic simulation was performed using the MKMCXX.24 The Gibbs free energy with ZPE correction was obtained from DFT frequency calculations at 800 K. The entropy of gas molecules was calculated by Ideal gas approximation, whereas, for surface species, the entropies were calculated in the harmonic approximation.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Propane dehydrogenation
Two hydrogens should be abstracted from propane to form propene. There are two different hydrogens in propane, which are attached to primary and secondary carbons, respectively. Therefore, there are two reaction pathways starting either from primary (R1-P to R2-P) or secondary (R1-S to R2-S) hydrogen, as shown in Fig. 2. There are four elementary steps along the reaction pathways, which are propane adsorption, first and second hydrogen abstractions, and propene desorption. The first step on both pathways is the physisorption of propane. The distance between the adsorbed propane and surface is 3.05 Å with an adsorption energy of −0.23 eV. This is followed by secondary–primary or primary–secondary hydrogen abstractions respectively on R1-S to R2-S and R1-P to R2-P pathways. It was found that the first hydrogen abstraction has a much bigger barrier than the second hydrogen abstraction as the latter is almost a barrierless process. The barrier (TS1) of the first hydrogen abstraction was calculated to be 1.02 and 1.49, respectively, on R1-S and R1-P. The surface oxygen acted as the active site for the abstraction of hydrogen from propane. The distance between carbon and hydrogen for TS1 was calculated to be 1.46 and 1.55 Å on R1-S and R1-P, respectively. Therefore, the transition state is more product-like. The removed hydrogen atoms were attached to the surface oxygen and become surface hydroxyls with a bond length of 0.98 Å. Another dissociated fragment, C3H7*, further loses another hydrogen, as indicated in TS2. In contrast, the second C–H bond activation is much easier with a negligible barrier. The formation of C3H6 is found exothermically as −0.42 and −0.69 eV on R2-S and R2-P, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2.

Moreover, the dehydrogenation of propane is also explored on CeO2 with surface vacancies and hydroxyl, as shown in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†) respectively. The reaction pathway analysis indicates that the first hydrogen abstraction has the largest barrier on the pathway and is bigger than the counterpart pristine CeO2 surface.
3.2 Addition of HBr
The adsorption and activation of HBr is of great importance in the reaction. As shown in Fig. 3, the interactions between HBr and CeO2 lead to either physisorption or dissociation. For physisorption, the adsorption energy of HBr was calculated to be −0.24 eV with a distance of 3.73 Å between Br species and CeO2 surface, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The optimized structure indicated the bond length of adsorbed HBr is 1.44 Å, which is almost identical to the counterpart in the gas phase. On the other hand, HBr can spontaneously dissociate from physisorption with a dissociation energy of −0.11 eV. The hydrogen moves towards the surface oxygen and becomes adsorbed hydrogen (H*) species with a bond distance of 0.99 Å, whereas Br moves towards Ce and forms a bond with a distance of 2.95 Å, as shown in Fig. 3(b).

3.2.1 Formation of C3H7Br The propane dehydrogenation in the presence of HBr will directly reveal the catalytic role of halogen, which was explored, as shown in Fig. 4. The propane dehydrogenation was investigated on the pre-dissociated HBr on CeO2. Moreover, focus was paid on the formation of C3H7Br. C3H7Br is the most important intermediate not only for the oxybromination of propane but also in other propane activations assisted by bromine.26,27 Therefore, the reaction pathway of C3H7Br formation is of great relevance. First of all, the adsorption of C3H8 significantly enhanced in the presence of HBr with an adsorption energy of −1.56 eV. The origin of the enhanced adsorption of propane is analyzed from ELF, PDOS, and COHP, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The presence of HBr induced electron polarization, which increased surface reactivity. Moreover, the calculated ICOHP is −0.12 and −0.19 for without and with HBr cases, respectively. The removal of the first H from secondary and primary carbon atoms was calculated to have barriers of 0.95 and 1.42 eV, respectively. The bond length of breaking C–H was increased from 1.1 Å to 1.36 and 1.46 Å, respectively. The presence of Br showed a decrease in the barrier for the first H atom abstraction compared with the counterpart without bromine. The C3H7 intermediate was formed after the first hydrogen abstraction. Furthermore, C3H7* captured adsorbed Br at the surface via step R4-S and R4-P with energy barriers of 0.21 and 0.59 eV, respectively. In the end, the C3H7Br species are formed exothermically with reaction energies of 0.35 and 0.57 eV. The bond distance for C–Br is calculated to be 2.02 Å. In comparison, Br attached to the secondary carbon is more favorable than the primary carbon.

3.2.2 Dissociation of C3H7Br The dissociation of C3H7Br leads to the formation of the target product, propene, as shown in Fig. 5. The hydrogen removal barrier is identical in the two pathways, which is 1.0 eV. The subsequent Br abstraction is an exothermic process without any barrier. Moreover, the removal of Br from the secondary carbon is more favorable than the primary carbon. In the end, the desired product, propene, is formed.

On the other hand, it is worth mentioning that the cerium oxide surface has remarkable catalytic properties that are related to its defects, particularly oxygen vacancies.25,28–30 The surface oxygen sites covered with H atoms can create a vacancy with water molecule desorption, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The C3H7Br dissociation at a vacancy site is shown in Fig. 6. It clearly indicated that the vacancy site has a better reactivity towards dissociation with a much reduced barrier. It is also interesting to find that the sequential abstraction started with Br rather than H, which is different from the pristine CeO2 surface.

3.3 Reactivity of surface hydroxyl
In the presence of HBr, the surface hydroxyl (OH*) is more active and directly involved in the activation of the C–H bond. The key finding is that the activated surface hydroxyl was involved in the removal of both secondary and primary hydrogens. Low energy barriers of 0.61 and 0.64 eV were obtained for the abstraction of the first H atom via paths R9-S and R9-P, respectively, as shown in Fig. 7. The hydrogen was attached to the surface OH* group, which subsequently formed a water molecule with a bond distance of 2.9 Å between O–Ce.
Fig. 7 The reaction pathway of propane dehydrogenation on the Br assisted hydroxyl surface. The gray and olive dash represents the path R9-S to R10-S and R9-P to R10-P, respectively.
Furthermore, the reaction is followed by the second H atom removal via R10-S and R10-P with energy barriers of 0.49 and 0.26 eV, respectively. The second hydrogen removal led to the exorthermic formation of C3H6 with energy barriers of −0.44 and −0.73 eV, respectively. The surface H atom is involved in the regeneration of the active site by the desorption of HBr from the surface with a desorption energy of 0.65 eV, as shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). The desorption of HBr created surface vacancies, which were filled by molecular oxygen with an energy barrier of 0.46 eV, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†).
3.4 The microkinetic modeling
To fully understand the catalytic role of HBr, microkinetic simulation was performed based on the inputs from DFT calculations. The considered elementary steps are illustrated in Scheme 1 and the network of elementary steps include adsorption, desorption, and surface reactions.

The partial pressure of the reactant has obvious pivotal influence on the kinetics, as shown in Fig. 8. The propane conversion and propene formation are positively correlated with the partial pressure of propane. Moreover, the positive effect of HBr is clearly evident as both conversion and selectivity significantly increased in the presence of HBr. The enhancement of performance can be partly explained by the reduced apparent energy barrier, as shown in Fig. 9.

Fig. 9 Apparent activation energy versus temperature, the blue dash line shows the activation energy in the absence of HBr and the gray dash line represents the activation energy in the presence of HBr.
On the other hand, the increased reactivity can also be understood from the coverage analysis, as shown in Table S3 (ESI†). The coverage of C3H7* and C3H6* increased with the partial pressure pushing the reaction equilibrium towards the product. Moreover, the analysis also showed that propane activation was most likely to occur via abstraction through the secondary hydrogen.
To identify the critical step along the reaction pathway, the DRC (Degree of Rate Control) analysis is performed. In the absence of HBr, the DCR coefficient is unity for R1-S. Therefore, it is confirmed that R1-S is the rate-determining step. Furthermore, the reaction order was found to be first-order on C3H8. This indicated that the rate of reaction solely depends on the concentration of C3H8. When HBr is present, the DRC coefficient was identified as unity for R3-S, suggesting that R3-S is a rate-determining step. Overall, the determined rate-limiting steps are connected with the first hydrogen dissociation for both cases with/without HBr. The HBr is essential at the beginning of the reaction involving the formation of the intermediate C3H7Br and supplies the H and Br species upon dissociation.31,32 The microkinetics simulation shows the reaction order to HBr as zero at different temperatures, as shown in Fig. S8(b) (ESI†).
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, the catalytic role of HBr in propane dehydrogenation was studied with DFT-based microkinetic simulation. Detailed reaction pathways under three different circumstances were carefully examined. The comparison between pathways without or with HBr clearly indicated the HBr effect on the reaction. The calculations revealed two different ways of HBr involvement in dehydrogenation. First, the dissociated HBr on the CeO2 surface directly participates in C–H bond activation in propane and forms the key intermediate C3H7Br. Second, the presence of HBr significantly increases the reactivity of surface hydroxyl, which can also break the C–H bond in propane. In this way, HBr is indirectly involved in the reaction. Moreover, a better activity was observed on the catalyst with oxygen vacancies, which is somehow expected. Microkinetic simulation unambiguously verified the positive effect from HBr addition. TOF of both propane conversion and propene formation is increased under HBr presence. This enhancement is consistent with the apparent decreased activation energy. The reaction follows the first-order kinetics with respect to C3H8 and zero-order with respect to HBr. Overall, the current work provides an accurate description of the role of HBr in propane dehydrogenation, which paves way for the further optimization.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
