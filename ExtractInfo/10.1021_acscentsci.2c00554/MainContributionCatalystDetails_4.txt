The provided document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) for converting propane to propylene. It focuses on using a metal-organic framework material for separation of propylene from propane dehydrogenation byproducts, rather than discussing improvements in catalysts, process conditions, or reactors for the PDH/ODH reactions themselves. Since the core topic is separation rather than PDH/ODH conversion, I cannot extract the requested information about catalyst composition, performance metrics, feed composition, etc.
