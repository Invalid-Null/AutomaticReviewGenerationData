 Based on my analysis of the provided document, this does not appear to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation for converting propane to propylene. The document discusses the use of a metal-organic framework material for separation of propylene from propane dehydrogenation byproducts, but does not provide details on the dehydrogenation process itself or catalysts used for that conversion.
