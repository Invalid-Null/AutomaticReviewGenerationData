 Based on the details provided in the document, this does not appear to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses theoretical insights into catalytic propane dehydrogenation on Ni(111), but does not provide experimental results for a specific catalyst. As such, I cannot extract the requested performance data.
