 Based on the provided document, this does not appear to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) to propylene. The document discusses boron-based catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane, but does not focus on a specific catalyst's performance or improvements for PDH or ODH. Since the criteria for assessing the scientific contributions are not met, I am unable to extract the requested details about a catalyst's composition, conversion, selectivity, etc.
