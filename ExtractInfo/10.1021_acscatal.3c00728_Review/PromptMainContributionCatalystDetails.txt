Dimensional Understanding of Boron-Based Catalysts for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation: Structure and Mechanism

Abstract
The superiority of boron-based (B-based) catalysts in inhibiting olefin peroxidation has shed light on the industrialization landscape of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) technology. However, owing to the complexity of the structure and reaction network of B-based catalysts, systematic understanding of the structure–performance relationship and the relevant mixed surface-gas radical mechanism remains limited. In this review, we summarize the latest research advances in the performance of different B-based catalysts and the ODHP reaction mechanism in different spatial dimensions. The construction of active sites from one-dimension (1-D) to three-dimension (3-D) of different catalysts and their ODHP catalytic performances were analyzed in detail, and the structure–activity relationship of the catalysts was elucidated. In addition, potential strategies for enhancing the space–time yield of the catalysts were discussed. Furthermore, this review also thoroughly analyzes the ODHP mechanism about the reaction pathways, key intermediates, rate-determining steps, and catalytic kinetics at the 1/2-D surface active sites and the 3-D gas phase. Finally, we summarize the synergism of surface and gas-phase radical reactions involved in the ODHP reactions and propose the reaction network. Based on existing challenges, the restrictions of this catalytic system were determined to suggest the direction for future studies.

1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propene, the second most important olefin building block and raw material in the chemical industry, is widely used to prepare value-added chemicals and polymer products such as polypropylene, propylene oxide, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid, isopropylbenzene, and butyl alcohol. (1−3) With the development of the modern chemical industry and the increase in consumption of high-value-added products, the annual demand for propene is increasing. (4,5) Among the existing propene production technologies, the synthesis of propene through propane dehydrogenation is more economically viable and environmentally friendly. (6−9)
Compared with the direct dehydrogenation of propane, (1,2,10−20) oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene (ODHP) requires a lower reaction temperature owing to the exothermicity of the oxidation reaction. This characteristic of ODHP exhibits considerable advantages and broad prospects for the efficient and continuous conversion of propane to propene. (21−25) Currently, conventional catalysts used in the ODHP process are mainly transition metal oxide catalysts, such as VOx, MgOx, WOx, CrOx, and silica-supported catalysts. (26−38) The reaction generally follows the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism; that is, the lattice oxygen activates the C–H bond of the alkane, and then O2 replenishes the lattice oxygen to regenerate the active site, thus completing the catalytic cycle. However, the strong interaction between the d orbital of the transition metal and the π orbital of olefin results in the easy C–C bond cleavage of olefin and subsequent peroxidation of hydrocarbons. Typically, as the propane conversion on the transition metal oxide catalyst approaches 20%, the propylene selectivity is less than 50%, and the selectivity of COx peroxidation products reaches 40–50%. This phenomenon can be explained based on the bond energy of the reactants and products. (21) On one hand, the weakest C–H bond in propene is weaker than that of propane (360.7 versus 401.3 kJ·mol–1), which makes propene thermodynamically more vulnerable to oxygen attack compared to propane. On the other hand, the weakest C–C bond in propene is 413.8 kJ·mol–1, only a little higher than that of the weakest C–H bond of propane. Consequently, the generated propene tends to be activated preferentially on the catalysts, leading to the cleavage of the C–C bond and overoxidation of propane to COx. The lattice-activated oxygen is too reactive to prevent potential side reactions in the ODHP reaction. Therefore, the key scientific challenge is to discover a suitable catalyst that can inhibit the overoxidation of propene to more thermodynamically stable CO and CO2 (COx), particularly at a high propane conversion rate.
In the last century, researchers attempted to use supported boron oxide (39) and B–P mixed oxide (40) catalysts for alkane oxidative dehydrogenation and partial oxidation. These pioneering studies revealed that boron could be a crucial component to improve alkane conversion under oxidizing conditions. Recently, since Hermans et al. and Lu et al. reported hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)-based materials as metal-free catalysts for the ODHP reaction that exhibited excellent catalytic performance, (25,41) considerable progress has been achieved in this field and numerous boron-based (B-based) catalysts have been developed, including the bulk B catalyst, supported B catalyst, metallic borides, nonmetallic borides, and porous B materials. (1,6,42−44) Although the chemical states of the B-based materials vary widely in their pristine form, the structure and kinetic behaviors of the diverse B catalysts are similar in the ODHP reaction. Investigations of the active site of B catalysts reveals that an oxygen functionalization process occurs under reaction conditions, generating the three-coordinated oxygen/hydroxyl modified B(OH)xO3–x species as the real active species in nearly every B-based ODHP catalyst. Owing to the unique free radical reaction pathways of the B(OH)xO3–x species, the peroxidation of olefin has been inhibited and the propene selectivity generally reaches as high as 80% at a propane conversion of ∼20%. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of the active sites is a crucial factor that influences the catalyst performance. On the one hand, the dispersion pattern determines the number/density of active sites on the B catalysts. On the other hand, the distribution of the active sites significantly regulates the gas-phase free radical reaction by changing the initiation and termination possibilities of radical reactions, which contributes to the majority part of propene production in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP). Currently, several elegant reviews have summarized the catalytic performances, kinetics, and mechanism of B-based catalysts in detail. (1,6,14,42,43,45) Lu et al. (6,43) focused on the preparation methods and chemical properties of BN and BOx-based catalysts and expounded their characterization and performance in the ODH of light alkanes. Hermans et al. systematically discussed the catalyst active sites and associated reaction mechanisms, elaborating on the similarities and differences of B materials in catalytic and kinetic behaviors. (42) However, as the classification of these reviews is mainly based on the chemical state of B materials, the importance of dimensions of B active sites has not been stressed systematically and sufficiently.
In this review, we classify B-based catalysts based on the configuration and spatial dimension of active sites, discuss the structural characteristics, and highlight the corresponding promotion strategies. Moreover, the conversion pathways and mechanism of ODHP on the catalyst surface and in the gas phase mediated by radicals are also analyzed. On the basis of these discussions of active sites and mechanism, the prospects of future research on the B-based catalyst system in ODHP are discussed and some useful suggestions are provided.
2. Dimensional Configuration of Active Sites in B-Based ODHP Catalysts
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Because boron nitride shows superior selectivity toward olefins, extensive studies have been conducted to expand the B-based catalysts for ODHP (Figure 1). With further study, researchers realized that the spatial distribution of the active sites plays an important role in both surface and gas-phase radical reactions. To summarize and analyze the effect of the spatial configuration of active sites on the catalytic performance, the active sites of B-based catalysts reported to date can be classified into three types: one-dimensional (1-D), (25,41,46,47) two-dimensional (2-D) (48−57) and three-dimensional (3-D) dispersed active sites. (58−72) Notably, owing to the complexity and dynamic behaviors of catalyst structures and configurations, B-based catalysts often exhibit more than one type of dispersion pattern of the active sites. Therefore, understanding the catalytic properties of each type of active site is essential for the future design of B-based ODHP catalysts.

2.1. 1-D Active Site Located at the Edge of the h-BN Sheet
The 1-D active sites of B-based catalysts are linearly dispersed on the edge of the 2-D h-BN sheets. Boron nitride nanotube (BNNT), which can be regarded as a curled BN layer, is also an example of B-based material with a 1-D active site. In 2016, Hermans’s group (25) serendipitously discovered that the metal-free h-BN and BNNTs, generally considered chemically inert materials, offered higher selectivity for propene than that offered by conventional metal oxide catalysts. For instance, h-BN exhibited a propene selectivity of 79% at a propane conversion of 14%. In comparison, the conventional V/SiO2 only showed a propene selectivity of 61% at a propane conversion of 9% (Figure 2a). Moreover, h-BN and BNNT catalysts could maintain a relatively higher propene selectivity with the increase in propane conversion. By contrast, other state-of-the-art ODHP catalysts favored the overoxidation of propane to COx. Notably, the principal byproduct of the ODHP on the BN material was ethene (selectivity of 12%), also a valuable olefin, thus making the ODHP over BN atomically more efficient and profitable and resulting in the release of fewer carbon prints (Figure 2a). Although the product distribution of h-BN and BNNTs was similar, BNNTs exhibited more than 1 order of magnitude higher mass-specific propane consumption rate (molC3H8·kgcat-1·s–1) than h-BN. The rate normalized to the surface area of BNNTs (3.6 × 10–7 molC3H8·m–2 s–1) was about three times higher than that of h-BN (1.1 × 10–7 molC3H8·m–2·s–1). The high reactivity and selectivity of the BN materials and their excellent stability resulted in substantial enhancement in the observed propene productivity, which was comparable to values deemed attractive for commercial implementation and thus drove a new trend of the application of metal-free materials in ODHP.

The theory of the 1-D edge active site was proposed to explain the behavior of 2-D boron materials. (25) A combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance infrared, and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy characterization of the fresh and spent catalysts provided evidence for the oxygen functionalization of the BN sheets when exposed to the ODHP reaction conditions. (41,53,73) Consequently, the 1-D oxygen-terminated armchair edges of BN (>B–O–O–N< ) were initially proposed as the active sites for the ODHP reaction (Figure 2b). Grant et al. (25) conducted kinetic experiments which revealed that the consumption rate of propane followed the partial order of PO2 and the second-order dependence to PC3H8, which was obviously different from the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism over supported VOx catalysts (zero order for O2 and first order for propane). The special kinetic behavior of BN suggested that the oxygen bonded to boron nitride was relatively stable in the presence of propane. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further revealed that the reaction started with the abstraction of the hydrogen from the second carbon of propane. The cleavage of the O–O bond created the B–O and N–O species to accommodate the H and the secondary propyl radicals, respectively. Furthermore, the generated surface-stabilized propyl intermediate (>N–O–CH(CH3)2) preferentially abstracted a second hydrogen atom from the primary carbon followed by another radical rebound, forming a dipropoxyl intermediate as the adsorbed precursor of the product propene. After the desorption of hydrocarbon species, the hydrogen atom was removed by dioxygen from the surface hydroxyl groups by cleavage of the O–H bond, thus regenerating the active site.
Thereafter, the catalytic effects of different kinds of 1-D B-based edge active sites, including armchair, B atom-terminated zigzag (zig-B), and nitride-atom-terminated zigzag (zig-N) of BN, on ODHP were also explored by researchers using DFT. (74) The results showed that oxygen atoms are inclined to adsorb dissociatively rather than as molecular dioxygen, leading to the irreversible oxygen functionalization of the fresh edges. On the basis of kinetics and thermodynamics, the zig-B edge was more active than the armchair or zig-N edge site (Figure 2c). Propane dehydrogenation was easier to occur on oxygen-modified edge sites compared to the C–C bond cleavage side reactions. (75−78)
2.1.1. Performance Promotion Strategies for 1-D BN Edge Active Sites
Despite the excellent selectivity of olefin products, some drawbacks exist for the h-BN materials with 1-D active sites in the ODHP reactions. First, the existence of an induction period indicates that the real B–O active site needs to be formed under a certain activation and/or reaction condition. Second, the density of the edge active sites in 2-D materials is low, which limits the further enhancement of catalytic activity on B-based catalysts. Third, the stability of the 1-D B catalyst needs to be improved. The loss of the B component in a water-rich atmosphere and high reaction temperature seriously hinder its further applications. To address these challenges, several performance promotion strategies were proposed.
The preoxygen modification of the edge sites is demonstrated efficient to improve the ODHP performance and reduce the induction period. Shi et al. (41) designed edge-hydroxylated boron nitride (denoted as BNOH) using a sodium-assisted high-temperature steam activation process achieving high activity and selectivity toward propylene (up to 80.2%) at a higher propane conversion (20.6%, Figure 3a,b). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and B K-edge electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) STEM mode showed that the steam activation generated more B–O edges owing to the lattice relaxations and distortions at the edge of boron nitride, significantly increasing the density of 1-D active sites (Figure 3a). The XPS and 2-D 11B multiple quantum magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) observed two types of B oxygen coordination of B–O–B and B–OH (Figure 3a), which were attributed to the oxygen functionalization of the edge sites (Based on current understandings, most of these species may belong to amorphous boron oxides formed in the pretreatment procedure.) In another case, boron–oxygen–nitrogen nanotubes (BONNTs) enriched with O–O species were prepared by an effective progressive substitution strategy, leading to improved olefin production. (47)

To improve the density of the edge sites, an efficient strategy is to reduce the size of the BN nanosheet and increase the edge/surface ratio. Eswaramoorthy and co-workers (46) developed a high-surface-area BN catalyst with a BET-specific surface area of 1380 m2 g–1 by the reaction of boric acid and dicyandiamide, which far exceeded the commercial bulk BN (48 m2 g–1). It could achieve a propane conversion of 52% with a 53% selectivity to propene and 70% selectivity to total olefins. However, the operation time of this catalytic system was measured to be only ∼5 h, owing to the facile oxidation of undercoordinated surface B–N bonds under the oxidative atmosphere. The lifetime of the catalyst could be extended to more than 100 h by the addition of ammonia into the reactants. The BN nanosheets prepared by the reaction of boric acid and urea mixtures with a molar ratio of 1:48 at 1000 °C for 5 h under an N2 atmosphere (79) contain a larger number of effective 1-D sites than bulk BN, achieving unprecedented 100% selectivity toward ethylene at ∼10% ethane conversion and a considerable olefin yield at higher conversions, which were similar to those of state-of-the-art Pt–Sn catalysts.
In addition to creating abundant 1-D edge active sites, the aggregation of active components into 1-D shaped materials is an effective strengthening strategy for BN catalysts. Lu’s group (80,81) successfully synthesized a 1-D nanofiber catalyst by doping silicon dioxide (SiO2) with h-BN and boron oxide respectively using the electrospinning technology (Figure 3c). A propene selectivity of 85.1% could be realized on an h-BN/SiO2 nanofiber catalyst when the propane conversion was 12.4% (Figure 3d). A significant olefin productivity of 24.9 golefins gBN–1 h–1 was more than five times higher than that on the currently reported bulk ODHP catalysts. This research provided a new methodology for the application of the B-based catalyst with a 1-D fiber structure to achieve more efficient preparation of propene in the ODHP process.
Regarding the stability of 1-D dispersed active sites, an h-BN⊃xIn2O3 composite catalyst was designed. The strong metal oxide–support interaction (SMOSI) effect between In2O3 NPs and h-BN not only strengthened the interlayer force of h-BN like a pin but also weakened the affinity of the B–N bond to O·. With In2O3 as the structure promoter, the catalytic stability of h-BN⊃In2O3 was extended nearly five times that of pristine h-BN. (57)
2.2. 2-D Dispersed Active Sites in B-Based Catalysts for the ODHP Reaction
The 2-D dispersed active sites can be developed by doping the active boron oxide/boron hydroxyl units on the surface of diverse hosting materials. Moreover, the exposed surface of bulk boride materials can also be regarded as the 2-D dispersed active sites for the ODHP reaction. Compared with the linearly dispersed edge sites, the density of active site can be significantly improved. Consequently, B nanomaterials with 2-D active sites have drawn extensive interest from researchers in the ODHP reaction because of their unique structural features.
2.2.1. 2-D BN Active Sites
As BN was initially reported to be highly selective for olefins during the oxidative dehydrogenation, the 1-D edge sites have been hypothesized to be where the BN oxidation occurs that catalyzes the ODH reaction. However, some recent studies revealed a substantial increase in the surface oxygen content after exposure to ODH conditions. Hermans’s group (82) revised their previous hypotheses of hydroxylated BN edges as the active component on h-BN via advanced mixed characterization techniques including NMR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy. An amorphous B(OH)xO3–x phase with different degrees of hydroxylation was formed on the surface of h-BN and BNNT following exposure to ODH conditions, which indicates that the oxidation region of h-BN and BNNT catalysts is not only limited to the edge sites.
Creating defects and holes in the plane of the BN nanosheet is also an efficient method for creating 2-D dispersed active sites. Recently, Huang et al. (83) prepared a high-surface-area h-BN catalyst (72.7 m2 g–1) via a novel gas exfoliation method and achieved a significant increase in specific activity compared with that obtained using bulk h-BN, suggesting that the defects formed in the h-BN sheet could also serve as active sites for the ODHP reaction. (84) Moreover, the local chemical environment of h-BN could be regulated by N2-plasma treatment by breaking linked chemical bonds in a controlled manner and abstracting the N element in the plane of BN, resulting in more three-coordinated-B center N-defects formation and a remarkable ODH reaction performance (54) (Figure 4a).

2.2.2. 2-D Supported BOx Active Site
Through the study of h-BN catalysts, researchers have realized the importance of B–O or B–OH species for the ODHP reaction. Therefore, the direct application of BOx-based materials to ODHP is a very promising direction. However, because the melting point of boron oxide (450 °C) is lower than the operating temperature of ODHP (480–560 °C), the sintering and loss of boron oxide species will occur under reaction conditions. Therefore, the construction of 2-D boron oxide-supported catalysts with B–O species loading on the surface of the carrier is important to improve the stability and dispersion of the BO species. The commonly employed carriers include Al2O3, ZrO2, TiO2, SiO2, and MgO. (48−50,85,86) In earlier studies, supported boron oxide catalysts have been employed as catalysts for the ODH of light alkanes. (62,87) In the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, (88) a boron oxide supported on nonporous Al2O3 was prepared by chemical vapor deposition with a loading of 30 wt %, which was a relatively high loading owing to the leaching of B under reaction conditions. An ethene yield of 16.7% at an ethane conversion of 18.7% could be achieved, and the main byproducts of this catalytic system were CO and CH4. The B2O3/Al2O3 catalyst was also used by Buyevskaya and co-workers (62,87) for ODHP, and the highest selectivity of propene was 42% at 30% propane conversion. In addition, the selectivity of C1–C3 oxygenates was up to 28%. In the alumina–boron catalyst system, the high selectivity of deep oxidation products, such as oxygenates, CO, and CO2, was because of the strong acidic sites generated by depositing boron oxide onto amphoteric alumina. The introduction of boron oxide onto the surface of an inert support could be a potential catalyst strategy to reduce undesirable side reactions. The 2-D supported catalysts B/SiO2 were synthesized via incipient wetness impregnation using a precursor solution of tri-isopropyl borate. (51) The conversion–selectivity trend of this catalyst was similar to that over h-BN (Figure 4b). Compared with the B2O3/Al2O3 catalyst, (62) the B/SiO2 catalyst exhibited a higher selectivity of propene (76.9% versus 52.5%) and relative equivalent selectivity of ethene (14% versus 14.7%). Conversely, the oxygenate selectivity over the B/SiO2 catalyst (7.1%) was much lower than that of the B2O3/Al2O3 catalyst (18.1%). Hence, the physicochemical properties of the support exert a considerable effect on the ODHP performance of the 2-D BOx-supported catalyst system. However, because of the volatility of the B precursor, any additional B precursor that could not readily react with the silica support to form strong bonding will evaporate from the surface during calcination. Consequently, the maximum B loading on SiO2 is only ∼2%, which restricts the improvement of propene yield.
2.2.3. 2-D Dispersed Active Sites in Nonmetal Borides
As the B species are loaded on the surface of the 2-D support, the low loading and loss of active species result in a limited number of active sites and restrict the enhancement of its catalytic activity. Compared with the commonly used carbon and silicon supported catalysts, the construction of a 2-D dispersed B active site by directly bonding B atoms to C or Si atoms can significantly improve the stability of the B active component. Boron carbide is generally considered a chemically inert material with super hardness, high melting, and wear resistance. (89−92) Recently, Hermans’s group (52) reported that B4C also showed a similar product distribution to that of the h-BN catalyst in the ODHP reaction. Although the reactivity was relatively low, the propene selectivity over the B4C catalyst was high with ethene as the main byproduct. For example, under the reaction temperature of 500 °C, the B4C catalyst could achieve a propene selectivity of ∼85% at the propane conversion of 7%.
Silicon boride (SiB3–6), a metal-free material enriched in B sites, has been applied by Yan et al. (53) for ODH of ethane, propane, and isobutane. Just like commercial h-BN, commercial silicon boride also exhibits high selectivity to olefin products. For ODHP, the TOF was 9 × 10–4 mol·s–1·molsite–1 at 535 °C and the selectivity of propylene was 82.2% with a propane conversion of 19.2%. The selectivity of total olefins including ethylene and propylene reached 94.4% and the selectivity of overoxidation products of COx was only 5.2%, which was superior over the silicon boride catalyst to that over most metal oxide catalysts (93,94) and carbon materials. (71,95) The olefins selectivity and productivities of the silicon boride catalyst system were even higher than those of other boride catalysts, (52) but the product distributions were similar, suggesting that similar active sites could be formed under the reaction conditions. These were the B–OH groups generated from the “BO species” after the oxygen functionalization, as was supported by the results of the acquired spectra and dynamics analysis (Figure 4c). This study provided a new strategy to design catalysts, which made researchers realize that in addition to the BN systems and BOx materials, the SiBx materials were also promising candidates for efficient oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene with less peroxidation side reactions. However, considering the application potential, the reported activity and yield of commercial BN and SiB3–6 do not meet the requirements of industrialization. One of the important reasons for the limitation of catalytic activity is the relatively low amount of B-containing active sites.
2.2.4. 2-D Active Sites in Metal Borides
In addition to the metal-free materials, metal boride catalysts, including titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB), were investigated by Grant et al. for ODHP. (52) Unprecedented selectivity to propene was observed for these metal boride catalysts, and the main byproduct was ethene rather than COx (Figure 4d). By contrast, the B-free TiN catalyst showed poor ODHP activity with low propane conversion and propene selectivity. This indicates that B is necessary for the high selectivity of propene, rather than the metal or nonmetallic element that was coordinated with B. Notably, although the B-metal catalysts showed similar propene selectivity, the activity and the propane consumption rate over these catalysts were quite different. Moreover, this distinction did not scale with the surface area of the B-containing catalyst (Figure 4d). Thus, the different catalytic activities were likely due to the differences in the active site density and/or electronic interactions between the surface and bulk phase of metal boride materials.
2.2.5. Exploration of Active Sites on 2-D B-Based Materials
With the further development of research on this subject, more B-containing materials have been used in ODHP reactions and the real active sites on 2-D catalysts have been discussed from different perspectives. Grant et al. (52) found that boron carbide (B4C), titanium boride (TiB2), nickel boride (NiB), cobalt boride (Co2B/Co3B), hafnium boride (HfB2), and tungsten boride (WB), as well as elemental B, showed similar behavior to BN with an analogous surface-stabilized BOx as the active site. This finding overturned the views of the edge sites or B–OH of h-BN as the active sites for the ODHP reaction. As the crystal structures of the studied boride catalysts differed from that of h-BN, B was the necessary element to achieve high olefin selectivity. The XPS results verified that oxygen was functionalized onto the surfaces of B-containing catalysts during the ODHP reaction. Because the reaction temperature (∼500 °C) exceeded the melting point of B2O3, the species formed by oxygen functionalization cannot be bulk B2O3. Otherwise, the catalyst would deactivate rapidly owing to the loss of active sites during the reaction. Actually, all the studied catalysts exhibited high stability. Further, the attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy results suggest that the B–OH moiety observed by Shi et al. (41) also did not appear on B4C, TiB2, NiB, Co2B/Co3B, HfB2, and WB catalysts except for h-BN or elemental B. This was in agreement with the in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy results obtained by Huang et al. (79) No B–OH signal was observed during the ODH of ethane over the h-BN catalyst. Therefore, the study of the nature of coordination of B is important to reveal the structure–performance relationship. However, the complexity of the oxygenated surface species makes the study difficult. To address this challenges, a combination of 11B solid-state NMR, SEM, and soft-XAS was used to characterize the molecular structure of the oxygen-functionalized phase that was formed on h-BN and BNNT during the catalytic testing for ODHP. (82) On the basis of the solid-state NMR experiments, the broad range of NMR signals in the oxide chemical shift region was assigned to an oxygenated surface phase denoted as B(OH)xO3–x, resulting from the varying degrees of oxidation/hydrolysis of the BN materials under the propane ODH reaction conditions. This was consistent with the results of the XAS studies on the fresh and spent h-BN that an increase in BO3-coordinated species occurred on the surface of h-BN with different numbers of bridging oxide and hydroxyl groups.
To further understand the structure of the boron oxide catalysts and their structure–activity relationship in ODHP, Love et al. (51) studied the silica-supported B catalysts (B/SiO2) and used a spectroscopic method (IR, in situ Raman) and solid-state NMR to understand the evolution of the B species and their restructuralization into stable active sites. The proposed species on fresh and spent B/SiO2 and the corresponding method of elucidation are shown in Figure 4b. According to the IR spectra of the fresh and spent B/SiO2 catalysts, for higher B loading samples, the number of isolated B–OH groups decreased owing to loss of the B after propane ODH for 24 h on stream. Meanwhile, the isolated Si–OH groups regenerated following B leaching from the surface with an increase in quantities of isolated Si–OH groups. As the in situ Raman of the fresh B/SiO2 shows, the loaded boric acid condensed to form six-membered boroxol rings above 100 °C. However, these six-membered boroxol rings tended to degrade under the given condition and were restructured to metaborate species, such as B(OH)xO3–x/B2(OH)2xO5–x. Solid-state NMR revealed that the B species restructured and shifted to a higher degree of B agglomeration. This finding was verified by comparing the 11B DQ-SQ spectra for the fresh and spent materials at similar accumulation times with a higher signal-to-noise ratio and a better overlap with the 11B spin–echo spectrum for the spent material. (44) This agglomerated oxidized B species comprised chains of BO3 units, corresponding to the results of a recent computational study that predicted the formation of a highly dynamic oxide phase on the surface of h-BN under the given reaction conditions. (96)
2.3. B Active Sites Located in or Bonded to the 3-D Framework of Porous Materials
The B-based materials with 3-D dispersed active sites generally exhibit porous structures and high specific surface areas. (77) The high specific surface area and suitable pore volume provide abundant sites to accommodate the active B species and confined space that influences the reaction behavior of radicals. Moreover, the pore structure also regulates the mass transport behaviors during the reaction process. Loading the B active components on the surface of the 3-D porous structure or doping them into the 3-D framework of the porous materials constitutes an effective method to construct 3-D B active sites.
2.3.1. 3-D Supported BN Active Sites
To meet the heat and mass transfer requirements of industrial applications, the 3-D monolith of BN is a potential and promising catalyst that improves the pressure drop of the catalyst bed and enhances its stability. (97) An h-BN wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalyst with a well-developed 3-D straight-channel and short diffusive pathway of the thin wash-coated h-BN layer was prepared by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using boric acid and urea as precursors. (61) The SEM results (Figure 5a) showed that the catalytic film of the h-BN/cordierite catalyst with 4.2% h-BN loading was attached to the monolith wall with a thickness of ∼3 μm, enhancing the utilization of h-BN by forming a thin layer. The well-developed 3-D straight-channel structure of h-BN/cordierite also provided space for gas-phase radical reactions; thus, excellent catalytic performance was achieved with a ∼16.8% conversion of propane and 82.1% selectivity toward propene, only 3.7% selectivity of CO and no detected CO2 at 535 °C, and a high gas hourly space velocity of 576 000 mL gBN–1 h–1 (Figure 5). According to the evaluation and characterization results, the h-BN/cordierite catalyst with 3-D supported BN active species achieved high C3H8 throughput owing to the excellent mass transfer process and highly efficient utilization of the active phase.

2.3.2. 3-D Supported BOx Active Sites
When preparing a supported BOx catalyst on a 2-D carrier, because of the volatility and rapid loss of the B precursor, the maximum B loading on SiO2 is ∼2%, which restricts the improvement of the propene yield. Recently, Lu’s group (63) reported a novel approach to load boron oxide with a high loading of up to 30%, with the assistance of the 3-D mesoporous structure of SBA-15 zeolite to anchor the boron oxide active sites (Figure 5b). The significant breakthrough of this catalyst system lies in the remarkable ODHP performance at a low temperature with high propene selectivity. Typically, when the B2O3 loading was 10%, a propane conversion of 14.8% could be achieved with a selectivity of 73.3% toward propene or 87.4% for both propene and ethene (C2–3=) at the reaction temperature of 450 °C. In particular, as the reaction temperature decreased to 405 °C, a much lower operating temperature than that required for the BN catalysts, a propane conversion of 2.8% was obtained for the 10% B2O3/SBA-15 catalyst with a propene selectivity of 84.1% (C2–3=, 94.6%). The boroxol ring and the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 species were currently identified as the active sites responsible for the low-temperature activity and high efficiency in catalyzing ODH of light alkanes.
Although the aforementioned B2O3-supported catalysts on commercial SiO2 or SBA-15 support show excellent catalytic performance with high activity and olefin selectivity as well as industrialization potential, problems such as a high-pressure drop of the catalyst packing and poor mass transfer in the catalyst pellets may limit their large-scale application. Therefore, 3-D wash-coated cordierite monolithic catalysts with B2O3 loading on 3-D cordierite have been designed to deal with this issue (64) (Figure 5b). However, owing to the loss of surface hydroxyls under high temperature calcination (∼1400 °C) during the cordierite production process, the interaction between bare cordierite and B was insufficient to immobilize the B species. Therefore, the cordierite support was modified by an additional silica coating layer that could attach firmly to the cordierite substrate possibly by forming Si–O–Al, Si–O–Mg, and Si–O–Si bonds and attach to the boron oxide layer via Si–O–B bonds. Finally, the 3-D B2O3/SiO2@cordierite honeycomb ceramic (B2O3/SiO2@HC-p) catalysts were obtained. (88) With this catalyst system, a high B loading of up to 10 wt % was realized. Moreover, the catalyst achieved excellent olefin selectivity (97.6%, propylene and ethylene) and negligible CO2 (0.1%) at 16.9% propane conversion under a high gas hourly space velocity of 345 600 mL·gB2O3–1·h–1.
To explore the effect of the porous support, the catalytic performances of B2O3/SiO2@HC and the B2O3/SBA-15 catalyst (63) with the same B2O3 loading were compared under the same conditions. The results showed that the propene selectivity of B2O3/SiO2@HC was higher than that of the B2O3/SBA-15 catalyst under the same C3H8 conversion, indicating that the structure and physicochemical properties of the 3-D support exert considerable impact on the product distribution of the resultant catalysts. The high selectivity of propene might be attributed to the uniform flow distribution facilitating the utilization of the active component, and the catalytic layer wash-coated on the 3-D monolithic wall, which shortened the diffusion paths to alleviate the overoxidation. Notably, both of these catalysts were considerably more selective to propene than traditional B2O3/SiO2 (51) owing to the higher density of B-containing active sites. The higher coverage of B species also prevented the undesirable side reactions that occurred on the bare SiO2 support.
In the past few decades, supported liquid-phase catalysts (SLPCs), featuring a liquid-phase catalyst film or droplet adsorbed onto the surface of a 3-D porous support, have been developed to integrate the merits of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. (98,99) Aiming at enhancing the catalytic stability of supported B2O3 in the range of 450–550 °C, the high-temperature SPLC strategy was also applied to prepare a B-based catalyst for an ODHP reaction. The molten boron oxide acts as a homogeneous catalyst and suitable 3-D framework supports were chosen to “heterogenize” the homogeneous catalysts. Huang and co-workers prepared a B2O3@BPO4 composite as a supported liquid-phase catalyst for the ODHP reaction with a sandwich-like hollow sphere structure using a one-step template-free method (65) (Figure 5b). Boron oxide (B2O3) and diammonium hydrogen phosphate ((NH4)2HPO4) were used as precursors to prepare the SLPCs. Under a high temperature above the melting point of B2O3, the 3-D BPO4 hollow sphere was formed after the attachment, self-assembling, and Ostwald ripening process. (100) During the cooling process, liquid B2O3 cooled and solidified into nanowires covering both the inside and outside of the 3-D BPO4 hollow sphere, forming sandwich-type B2O3@BPO4 hollow spheres. The metal-free 3-D B2O3@BPO4 composite exhibited a propane conversion of 24.7% and 84.8% selectivity for total olefin (ethene and propene) with the productivity of up to 0.79 gC3H6 gcat–1 h–1 and high stability at 550 °C, which is better than several metal-based oxidative dehydrogen catalysts. (2,101,102)
2.3.3. Bulk B-Based Catalysts with 3-D Dispersed Active Site Doped in the Framework of Porous Materials
Zeolites, a family of porous materials with a high specific surface area and uniform and tunable pore structure, are widely used in heterogeneous catalysis. By doping B species into zeolite frameworks, a 3-D dispersion of the B active site can be achieved. Although the MWW borosilicate zeolite comprising intergrown flaky crystals and isolated B species were reported (58) to be inert for ODHP reactions, a new type of 3-D MWW borosilicate zeolite with surface defect tricoordination B species was synthesized via the hydrothermal method using boric acid and silica sol as the B precursor and silica precursor, respectively. (59) The SEM, XRD, and FTIR results revealed that the MWW borosilicate zeolite was well formed with 3-D flaky crystals of 100 nm thickness and the heteroatom B inserted into zeolite frameworks. In ODHP, the 3-D MWW borosilicate zeolite exhibited excellent catalytic performance. For example, when the B content was 4.8%, BZEO-3 could achieve a propane conversion of 30.6% with a propene selectivity >80% (Figure 5c). Moreover, after a long time on stream, the selectivity of MWW borosilicate zeolite could be maintained at a high level, but the activity decreased to some extent. This is because of the decrease of crystallinity of zeolite, as the content of B could be kept constant before and after the reaction. This also proved from another angle of view that the 3-D pore structure of zeolite played an important role in the conversion of propane, which could affect the mass and heat transport. Based on the radical-based mechanism of the gas-phase chemistry reported in the previous literature, (103) the surface radical formation and termination may be influenced by the microscopic environment in which the reactant molecules are located. Figure 5c shows that the activity was significantly increased with the increasing reaction temperature, just like the other catalysts used for ODHP. The enhancement of propane conversion would lead to a decrease in selectivity. As the reaction temperature increased from 500 to 530 °C, the conversion of propane increased by nearly 30%, while the propene selectivity decreased by only about 10%, and the total olefin selectivity decreased slightly. Thus, the 3-D MWW borosilicate zeolite is a promising B-containing catalyst for ODHP with surface defect tricoordination B species as active sites.
Wang and co-workers (60) reported a B-silicate MFI zeolite (BS-1) prepared via a solvent-free method. The resulting zeolite exhibited high activity and selectivity for ODHP. Unlike the agglomerated oxidized B species in BN and B/support, the active B species in the 3-D structure of the BS-1 catalyst were isolated B with a −B[OH···O(H)–Si]2 structure. Under the reaction temperatures of 540 and 560 °C, the propane conversions could reach 23.8% and 41.4%, respectively. In addition, when the conversion of propane was 5.4%, the selectivity of total olefins including ethene (25.7%) and propylene (60.9%) reached 86.6%, exhibiting a low selectivity for overoxidation products (<0.5%) (Figure 5c). For the 3-D MWW borosilicate zeolite reported by Lu’s group, (59) a considerable loss of activity occurred after the washing treatment because of the decrease in the defective trigonal B species. By contrast, the BS-1 catalyst could maintain the catalytic activity after water treatment. The ICP analysis, N2 sorption, XRD pattern, SEM images, and TEM images verified that the 3-D zeolite structure was maintained and that B leaching was nearly negligible after the reaction. Even after a reaction for 210 h, the olefin selectivity remained approximately constant, because the 3-D zeolite framework hindered the hydrolysis and/or dissolution of B species by water under a humid environment during the ODHP process. To obtain an improved low-temperature ODHP performance of B-containing MFI-type zeolite, Qiu et al. (69) regulated the crystallinity of the zeolite by adjusting the hydrothermal synthesis conditions and prepared an incompletely crystallized MFI-type borosilicate zeolite catalyst. The resulting zeolite exhibited extraordinary performance in ODHP with an olefin productivity of 4.75 golefin gcat–1 h–1 at a low reaction temperature (445 °C) and a high weight–hour–space–velocity (37.6 gC3H8 gcat–1 h–1). During the reaction, the isolated B dynamically transformed into an aggregated B species, in which the B–OH groups that hydrogen bonded with the adjacent Si–OH groups were identified as the active centers and demonstrated high efficiency in catalyzing the ODHP reaction at low temperatures. Moreover, the crystal size of B-containing MFI zeolite could also be regulated. A self-pillared B-containing MFI zeolite with an ultrathin b-axis was synthesized using tetrabutylammonium hydroxide as the structure-directing agent. (68) The in situ IR and 2-D MAS NMR results showed that ultrathin B-containing MFI zeolite with a high specific surface area and abundant Si–OH groups allowed dynamic self-dispersion of highly mobile B clusters through condensation with the surrounding Si–OH groups, thereby contributing to the enhanced catalytic performance and stability in the ODHP process.
During the ODHP reaction, the mass transport behaviors play an important role in the enhancement of catalytic performance, which makes the design of suitable 3D pore structures crucial. Lu and co-workers synthesized a 3-D ordered macroporous boron phosphate using a hard template method, (104) which possessed both rich pores and a high surface area. Primarily, polybenzoxazine polymer spheres as the hard template were synthesized by a self-assembly process using resorcinol, formaldehyde, 1,6-diaminohexane, and ammonia solution, thus obtaining the highly ordered 3-D monoliths. Subsequently, the BPO4 precursor of the ethanol–water solutions of boric acid and phosphoric acid was introduced with polybenzoxazine polymer spheres under the hydrothermal treatment for nucleation. The carbonization process was performed at 550 °C for 2 h under an Ar atmosphere, forming the BPO4@carbon product. Finally, the ordered 3-D macroporous boron phosphate BPO4(OM) was obtained by calcining the sample in the air to remove the hard template (Figure 5c). The pore structure of BPO4(OM) was a 3-D cross macropore network, which could effectively improve molecular diffusion and heat transfer. In the ODHP reaction, BPO4(OM) exhibited better catalytic performance than bulk BPO4 materials. For instance, to achieve a propane conversion of 14.3%, the operation temperature required for the BPO4(OM) catalyst was 515 °C, which is much lower than that for the BPO4 (bulk, 550 °C) catalyst (Figure 5c). As the surface specific rate of propane consumption is similar between BPO4(OM) and BPO4(bulk), it suggested that the difference in the number of active sites in unit surface area results in the varying performance of the two catalysts. However, the BPO4(OM) catalyst exhibited excellent stability, and the propane conversion and propene selectivity were constant during the 20 h catalyst test. The BPO4(OM) catalyst demonstrated an excellent propene yield, much higher than the catalysts reported to date, which had far exceeded the industrial demand of 1 golefin gcat–1 h–1 with a productivity of ∼16 golefin gcat–1 h–1 at a WHSV of 94 gC3H8 gcat–1 h–1 and a propane conversion of 20.8%. The suitable 3-D pore structures render ordered macroporous boron phosphate a very promising catalyst for propane oxidative dehydrogenation, and it is expected to meet the industrial standard. Liu and co-workers (66) developed a unique approach to synthesize BN@BPO4 self-supporting monolithic foam with oriented bowl-like structure via a self-assembly strategy. Thereafter, by raising the annealing temperature and prolonging the annealing time, the pure h-BN monolithic foam with a 3-D bowl-like structure was obtained. This 3-D h-BN bowl foam possessed a large surface area (524 m2 g–1) and numerous mesopores, showing excellent activity for the ODHP reaction with ca. 20% propane conversion, 70% propene selectivity, and productivity of ∼1.75 gC3H6·gcat–1·h–1.
2.3.4. Exploration of Active Sites on 3-D B Materials
The study of active sites on the surface of 2-D materials has shown that the agglomerated tricoordination oxidized B species are responsible for ODHP catalytic performance, which are further explored in 3-D B materials, such as supported boron oxide catalysts, (63,64) boron phosphate catalyst, (104) etc. The B2O3 supported on 3-D mesoporous silica (B2O3/SBA-15) and 3-D honeycomb cordierite (B2O3/SiO2@HC) catalysts were thoroughly studied. The 11B NMR measurement of the fresh and spent B2O3/SBA-15 catalysts showed that the features of tricoordination B ring B3O9/2 (B(3a)) increased with the decrease of tricoordination B BO3/2 (B(3b)) and tricoordination B on the framework silicon oxide B(3c) after the ODHP reaction, which was owing to the enthalpy-driven transformations of B(3b) and B(3c) to B(3a) species. (87,105) For the 3-D B2O3/SBA-15 catalyst system, the agglomerated oxidized B species of the boroxol ring and the tricoordinated planar BO3/2 were considered the active sites responsible for the low-temperature activity, while the tetra-coordinated species (B(4)) acted as insert. In addition, the catalytic effects of tricoordination B and the inset of tetra-coordinated were also confirmed by the studies of ODHP over boron phosphate (BPO4), (104) silicon boride (SiB6), (53) and B2O3@BPO4 (65) catalysts. Considering BPO4 as an example, a reduction of the XPS features of the tetracoordinated species was observed after the reaction accompanied by aan increase of that of the tricoordination B species, which, under the reaction conditions, activated gaseous oxygen and participated in the dehydrogenation of alkanes.
Conversely, the recent study of ODHP over B-containing zeolites (MFI framework, BS-1) by Wang and co-workers (60) proposed an active site of isolated B in a 3-D zeolite framework without B oligomers, exhibiting high activity and selectivity for ODHP. This is an exception to the hypothesis that stated the agglomerated oxidized B species (B–O–B oligomers) are responsible for the catalytic activity. The 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy and 2-D 11B → 1H heteronuclear correlation (HETCOR) spectra revealed that B species with tetrahedral and trigonal coordination in the zeolite framework were isolated and that the B4 sites could convert to B3 sites by dehydration of a portion of the B4 sites, which was a reversible and stochastic process. This was in agreement with the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) results. Further, the time-of-flight mass spectra showed that B-containing clusters of BO2 and BO3 and a variety of borosilicate ions [SizB1OyHx, z = 1, 2] could be detected. However, the clusters containing the B–O–B structure were completely undetectable. The hydroxyl groups on the isolated B were also identified by 11B MAS NMR spectroscopy, 2-D 11B → 1H HETCOR spectrum, and in situ FTIR, revealing that the isolated B in the zeolite framework (Si–O–B linkage) could hydrolyze to form more −B[OH···O(H)–Si]2 groups that hindered full hydrolysis and dissolution (Figure 5c), resulting in the good durability of the BS-1 catalyst in the ODHP. By contrast, the isolated B in MWW-type borosilicate zeolite (B-MWW) was inactive and the NMR characterization studies showed that −B[OH···O(H)–Si]2 sites were absent in the inactive B-MWW catalyst. In addition, the borosilicate zeolite with a *BEA structure (B-Beta) also had abundant −B[OH···O(H)–Si]2 sites exhibiting high activity and selectivity for ODHP. Thus, the −B[OH···O(H)–Si]2 sites were the necessary active sites for ODHP over the BS-1 catalyst.
In summary, the evolution of B-based catalysts with active sites dispersed in different spatial dimensions has been well developed in the past decade. The oxygen-functionalized B sites and clusters were demonstrated to achieve high olefin and very low COx selectivity. By classifying the reported catalysts from the perspective of the B dispersion dimension, the potential strategies to enhance the catalytic performances are revealed. The increasing active site dispersion dimension from 1-D to 2-D and 3-D significantly increases the density of available centers for the ODHP reaction. However, the loading of B active species in the 3-D porous materials or doping into the zeolite frameworks not only provides a higher utility of B active sites but also constructs confined space which regulates the reaction behaviors of active radical intermediates and mass transport behaviors (Figure 6a). Considering that the ODHP reaction involves both surface-mediated and gas-phase pathways, controlling the interplay between the on-surface and off-surface channels through the whole reaction from the radical initiation stage to the termination stage is highly important for catalyst design. In this sense, the introduction of confined walls is able to directly increase the wall termination possibility of the gas-phase radicals, which exhibits a negative effect on the reaction rate. (106,107) However, as the confinement also influences the diffusion of reactants, radical intermediates, and products, predicting the net effect of the 3-D dispersion of active sites on the apparent catalytic performances is difficult. The decoupling of this multiparameter system is highly challenging but crucial for the rational design of porous B-based ODHP catalysts.

Panel a structural representation of 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D catalysts. Panel b and panel c comparison of the catalytic performance of different catalysts (date from Table 1).
The conversion–selectivity and space–time yield of the representative B-based catalysts are summarized in Figure 6b and 6c. A conversion–selectivity trade-off relationship clearly exists for all catalysts, and the maximum yield of propylene over B catalysts is still below 30%. The yields of B catalysts with 1-D active sites are relatively similar (between 10% and 20%). By contrast, the yields of catalysts with 2-D and 3-D active sites are more discrete, probably owing to the stronger structure diversity and complexity of these systems. We summarize the catalytic performance of typical B-based catalysts with 1-D to 3-D dispersed active sites in ODH reactions in Table 1. Some of the reported catalysts have already exhibited considerable propene and total olefin productivity beyond the industrial standard (1 golefinsg–1 h–1). In future studies, in addition to the enhancement of the intrinsic activity of B species, understanding and optimizing the spatial interaction of the surface-active sites with the gas-phase key intermediates can also provide good opportunities to develop catalysts for industrial applications.

3. Dimensional Understanding of the ODHP Reaction Mechanism over B-Based Catalysts
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Despite the significant achievements obtained regarding the mechanism of the B-based catalysts for the ODHP reaction, the whole reaction network, the detailed activation manner of alkanes, and the interplay between different intermediates are still unknown. With increasing research in this field, the ODHP reaction has gradually been discovered to involve a mixed mechanism including both complicated surface and gas radical reactions instead of a simple surface catalytic process. Therefore, the reaction occurs not only on the 1- and 2-D surface-active sites but also in the 3-D space in the gas phase. From the spatial dimension of reactant molecular motion, we divide the reaction mechanism into two parts: surface reaction mechanism and gas radical reaction mechanism. In the following sections, the experimental and theoretical evidence related to the surface and gas radical reaction mechanisms will be summarized. Furthermore, the synergistic effect between the surface and gas-phase reactions in ODHP will also be discussed.
3.1. Surface Reaction Mechanism
Mechanism studies about the hexagonal BN are first explored. (25) Kinetic analysis showed that the consumption rate of propane followed partial order in PO2, while it followed the second-order dependence with respect to PC3H8 over the h-BN catalyst, which was evidently different from the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism of the traditional metal oxide catalysts. This phenomenon suggested that the oxygen bonded to the boron nitride surface was relatively stable in the presence of propane. The reaction mechanism on >B–O–O–N< active sites started with hydrogen abstraction from the secondary carbon of propane that had been further revealed by DFT calculations. Accordingly, the surface-stabilized propyl intermediate [namely, >N–O–CH(CH3)2] was generated by the cleavage of the O–O bond, creating the B–O and N–O species to accommodate H and secondary propyl radicals, respectively. Thereafter, a second hydrogen atom from the primary carbon was abstracted and followed by another radical rebound, forming a dipropoxyl intermediate as the adsorbed precursor of propene. After the desorption of propene, the >B–O–O–N< active sites were regenerated by cleaving the O–H bond and oxygen extracting hydrogen (Figure 7a).

Under the reaction conditions, the surfaces of BN-based and boron oxide-based catalysts undergo oxygen functionalization, generating BOx active species. Shi et al. (41) further studied how BOx active species participated in the reaction of ODHP using in situ FTIR characterization and isotopic labeling experiments. In situ IR spectroscopy demonstrated that the intensity of B–OH vibration continually weakened with the introduction of O2 to the propane atmosphere. The consumed B–OH could be regenerated by steam treatment. This phenomenon demonstrated that B–OH was an active surface intermediate involved in the reaction network. Isotope labeling experiments discovered that both HDO and D2O were generated when C3H8 and O2 were introduced into the deuterated BNOD catalyst at 530 °C. The H216O and H218O signals also appeared after the catalyst was exposed to 18O2, indicating that two adjacent B–OH were able to dehydrate and reversibly exchange H and O atoms with gas-phase reactants. The exchange process occurred by forming a four-membered ring intermediate, which was then dehydrated to form the B–O–B site. Different from BN, a Langmuir-type dependence on oxygen concentration (0.5) and second-order dependence on propane concentration demonstrated that the molecular oxygen was adsorbed or activated on the catalyst surface and that the propane derived from the gas phase directly reacted with the active oxygen species. Therefore, a mechanism could be proposed where B–OH groups react with O2 to generate active species that may further catalyze propane dehydrogenation to propene and water and recover the B–OH groups (Figure 7b). However, Su et al. (79) found that the BN materials could not be oxidized below 800 °C under an O2 atmosphere, indicating that with molecular O2 alone it was difficult to form the proposed B–O species at the armchair edges under ODH reaction conditions. The operando spectroscopy verified that, during the reaction of oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, the1-D active sites of B–O(H) are formed at the BN edges with the aid of ethane and that the formed B–O sites can abstract a hydrogen atom from ethane with the assistance of O2.
When the borosilicate MFI framework (BS-1) with the isolated B active sites of −B[OH···O(H)–Si]2 was used for the ODHP reaction, (60) the first-order dependence with respect to PC3H8 was discovered, which was different from that over BN and B/support catalysts. DFT calculations revealed that the reaction behavior of the isolated hydroxyl-functionalized B atoms was significantly influenced by the adjacent Si–OHs. During the ODHP reaction, B–OH captured a proton from propane to form the C3H7 intermediate by crossing a barrier of 1.583 eV. Simultaneously, the B–OH interacted with O2, forming an eight-membered ring transition state (Figure 7c). Then the C3H7 intermediate reacted with the O2H species, and the intermediate underwent H abstraction to afford propene and H2O2. After desorption, H2O2 transformed into H2O and O2 in the practical reaction.
3.2. Gas Radical Reaction Mechanism
The radical reaction in the 3-D gas phase plays an important role in the selectivity of the ODHP reaction (Figure 8a). Theoretically, the cleavage of the C–C bond of propane will generate one C2 and one C1 fragment. If no further reaction exists, the carbon-based selectivity of C2/C1 products will be equal to 2. However, it is widely observed that the practical measured value of C2/C1 is larger than 2, (53,63,64) which implies there must be one or more extra pathways that consume C1 to form C2 products in the ODHP reaction. Wang et al. (108) designed experiments to verify the role of the oxidative coupling of the methane (OCM) reaction into C2 speciation on the h-BN catalyst. It demonstrated that the methyl radicals could effectively couple to form C2 in the presence of oxygen at high temperature, accounting for the high selectivity of C2 species in the ODHP reaction. Using 13C-labeled propane as the reactant, the alkyl radical reaction network was revealed in detail. During ODHP reaction, CH3CH2*CH2, CH3CH2*, and CH3* radicals were formed by the cleavage of C–H and first C–C bonds of propane, respectively, over the BN catalyst. The on-purpose product of propene was synthesized by the subsequent dehydrogenation of CH3CH2*CH2 radical. Meanwhile, the dehydrogenation of CH3CH2* radical played the main role in the formation of C2H4. The methyl formed from the first C–C bond cleavage of propane could be involved in the coupling reaction, CH4 formation, CHxOy formation, and overoxidation to COx reactions. Among these reactions, the oxidative coupling of methyl showed additional contribution to C2-product selectivity in ODHP, leading to a higher yield of C2-products than that of C1-products over the h-BN catalyst.

Under the oxidative reaction conditions of elevated temperatures, it is hard to probe the highly reactive radical species and detect the changes in them. Huang and co-workers (83) used online synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectroscopy (SVUV-PIMS) to capture the gas-phase methyl radicals (CH3·) in the ODHP reaction over B-based catalysts, which provided direct evidence to demonstrate the existence of gas-phase radicals. The gas-phase methyl radical signal (m/z = 15) and propene (C3H6, m/z = 42) were observed throughout the ODHP reaction over h-BN catalysts and BOx/SiO2 (Figure 8b). In the control and blank experiments in the presence of a catalyst at room temperature and without a catalyst at elevated temperatures, no radical signal was detected, indicating that the activation of propane as well as the cleavage of the first C–C bond of propane occurred on the surface of B active sites at high temperatures. The amount of various gas-phase components from the SVUV-PIMS spectra (Figure 8c) revealed that higher temperature promoted the formation of C2H4, C2H6, and HCHO, but the content of CH3·, CH4, and COx increased relatively slowly with the elevated temperature. Moreover, no C2H5· and C3H7· radicals were detected. According to the results of the kinetic study, SVUV-PIMS measurements, and DFT calculations, propane was activated over a B–O pair in a BO3 active site and then the hydrogen was abstracted and transferred to the oxygen of B–O–B, forming a coadsorbed B–C3H7 intermediate. Furthermore, the O2 reacted with the surface O–H by abstracting the hydrogen to form B–HO2. This was followed by the reaction of B–HO2 and B–C3H7 on adjacent BO3 sites, resulting in the formation of H2O2 and propene. After desorption of propene and H2O2 from the surface, H2O2 decomposed to form water, and the BO3 site was regenerated (Figure 8d). Meanwhile, it was also found that the formation of ethene and methyl radicals could occur competitively over either the surface or in the gas phase.
3.3. Reaction Networks of ODHP Reactions with Surface and Gas-Phase Radicals
On the basis of the aforementioned research summary, we have attempted to plot the reaction networks to correlate the surface and gas-phase radical reactions involved in the ODHP reactions, as shown in Figure 9. For different catalyst systems, although the final catalytic site is considered as the tricoordination BOx(OH)3–x species, the initial B species before the ODHP reaction are different. According to the previous studies, (107,109,110) the B–O–B (derived from BOx-based catalyst) and {BB} (derived from the oxygen functionalization of BN-based catalyst, a type of unsaturated B–B–B units in which the middle B is buried in the sublayer while two ends are exposed) are the basic precursors for the B active site on the catalyst surface. They could convert to the commonly accepted surface-active site of BO· after oxygen functionalization with the formation of the important gas radical ·OOH. On one side, the O2 could be activated on the {BB} surface sites, which is a thermodynamically favorable process to form a peroxo-like >BO–OB< surface species. Then, the BO· surface-active site is generated by the facile O–O bond cleavage by overcoming an energy barrier of 49 kJ mol–1. (109) On the other hand, in parallel, the {BB} surface sites directly hydrolyze to generate B–OH and B–H active species, and then the formed B–H will react with O2 from HOO·, which is the main reactive radical for the gas reaction. However, Wang et al. (107) proposed different viewpoints because the reductive metastable B structure including B–B and B–H could not survive under ODH conditions requiring a sufficient quantity of accessible dioxygen and alkane. It was considered that the abundant thermodynamically stable B–O–B bridges in tricoordinated B2O3 units could be hydrolyzed to generate more B–OH under ODH conditions. The H abstraction of B–OH occurred in the presence of O2 with an energy barrier of 45–55 kcal mol–1. (107) It should be noted that the neighboring Si–OH could form a hydrogen bond with the B–OH to stabilize the transition state and assist the dehydrogenation by triplet O2 with a reduced reaction barrier (36.1 kcal mol–1), which may be responsible for the excellent performance of BS-1 zeolite with the isolated B active sites of −B[OH···O(H)–Si]2 used for the ODHP reaction. (60) The highly reactive species of BO· and ·OOH radicals formed by H abstraction of B–OH by O2 could invoke the dehydrogenation of propane via the surface channel and gas channel, respectively. The aforementioned reaction processes are the initiation stages during which the radical species are generated.
Figure 9
Figure 9. Reaction networks of ODHP reactions between the surface reaction and gas radical reaction. Green color represents the initial B species on the catalyst surface, and red color represents the main reaction paths and reactants; the wider the line, the faster the reaction rate.
During the ODHP reaction, the dehydrogenation of propane mainly occurs via the abstraction of hydrogen from propane by the reactive species of BO· and ·OOH radicals. (72) After the first hydrogen of propane is abstracted, on the one hand, a second hydrogen of the formed propyl or isopropyl may be further abstracted by BO· and ·OOH radicals to form propene with a relatively low barrier. On the other hand, a second hydrogen could be abstracted by O2. Meanwhile, a part of propene is formed by the direct cleavage of the C–H bond of propyl and isopropyl radicals. As the main byproduct during the ODHP reaction, ethene is mainly derived from C–C bond cleavage and the coupling reaction of C1 species. The extremely low selectivity of the peroxide byproduct of COx is the most important characteristic of B-based catalysts for propane oxidative dehydrogenation. Under ODH conditions, the alkyl radical is considered to be an intermediate leading to olefin products, while the alkoxyl radical may evolve into either olefins or deep oxidation products. Therefore, a high alkene selectivity and a low COx selectivity require an efficient way to eliminate the alkoxy radical. Researchers (107,110) found that the tricoordinated B–OH could adsorb the oxygenated radicals under ODH conditions, for example, ·OC3H7 and ·OH, rather than alkyl radicals, for example, ·C3H7, which effectively detained the alkoxy radicals on the surface and freed the alkyl radicals in the gas phase. The formed >B–OC3H7 species were eliminated by the dehydrogenation process under the participation of O2 and eventually converted to C3H6 with B–OH site regeneration. In addition, the latest study by the Lu’s group revealed that the in situ-formed propene under ODHP reactions actively accelerated the parent propane conversion by interacting with ·OOH and ·OC3H7 radicals and generated propene oxide (PO), which was further oxidized to ethene and CO. (111) Notably, some free radicals such as ·OOH, ·C3H7, ·OC3H7, etc., are transferred and exchanged between the surface and gas phase in the whole reaction network. (55,112) Therefore, the influence of catalyst configuration on free radical transport and reaction must be considered in catalyst design. For the ODHP reaction, both the surface reaction and gas radical reaction occur at the same time. The surface reaction rate will affect the gas-phase free radical processes, and the gas-phase radical reaction will also have an adverse effect on the surface reaction. The effective coupling of the two processes plays an important role in realizing the high activity and high propene selectivity during ODHP.
Firstly, reaction conditions are considered to be the crucial factors affecting the surface and radical reactions, and the experimental parameters of partial pressure of reactants, reaction temperature, and WHSV are commonly considered. Furthermore, catalyst bed configuration is also important to ODHP. Venegas et al. (103) related the contributions of catalyst bed configuration to the observed reactivity of h-BN catalysts. The experiments showed a volcano-type dependence of the propane consumption rate on the mass of h-BN in the reactor. Meanwhile, the addition of SiC can significantly increase the reactivity, which could be explained by the promotion of gas-phase reactions. The homogeneous dilution of the active BN with inert SiC exhibited better activity than the layered packing of the same amount of BN with SiC. In addition to the discussion of the intrinsic catalytic properties of B-based catalysts, the influences of mass and heat transfer were also investigated with the h-BN catalyst for the ODHP reaction. It was observed that the propane conversion increased with increasing WBN/F0, suggesting that the mass-specific reaction rate tended to decrease with the increasing catalyst weight. When the inner diameter (ID) of the reaction tubes was reduced from 8 to 4 nm, a lower reaction rate was obtained even at higher temperatures. (103) Therefore, the optimal catalyst bed configuration may vary with the B material, reactor dimensions, and gas composition.
The mixed heterogeneous–homogeneous ODH mechanism has been proposed, which can be described as the boron oxide/hydroxide phase on the surface of the catalyst acting as an initiator to form alkyl radicals, which further react in the gas phase. Achieving the synergy of the surface reaction and gas radical reaction is of considerable significance to enhance the understanding of the ODHP reaction mechanism and to design a more effective B-based catalytic system.
4. Conclusion and Future Direction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In this paper, the design and construction of B active sites in different dimensions were systematically summarized. Moreover, the reaction mechanisms of the surface reactions and gas-phase radical reactions involved in the process of ODHP over B-based catalysts were discussed. It was recognized that the catalytic mechanisms on the potential active sites of tricoordination B species with different dimensional geometric configurations deepened the understanding of B-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation and provided effective guidance for the development of more efficient ODHP catalysts in the future.
Currently, although methods to construct different configurations of active sites have been well developed, some technical problems still exist that restrict the further development of B-based catalysts: (1) Like most alkane-selective oxygenation reactions, the conversion–selectivity trade-off relationship significantly limits the yield of propene and olefin products in the ODHP reaction. Innovations in the catalytic systems and theories are highly desirable to address the limitation. (2) The enhancement of radical initiation ability on tricoordinated B active sites is still limited, especially the initiation at low temperatures. For instance, owing to the high barrier of the homolytic dissociation of the O–H bond of the boron hydroxyl in the presence of dioxygen, it is hard to achieve the dissociation–regeneration cycle between BO· and BO–H (BO· ↔ BO–H) species. The recent report on the subsurface metal promoters has provided a potential strategy to reduce the working temperature of B catalysts. (113) (3) The role of B-based catalysts in the termination of active radicals may also have a strong influence on the reaction kinetics, which should be studied in detail using experimental and theoretical methods. (4) The mechanism of the surface reaction is relatively clear, but the understanding of the reaction mechanism of gas-phase radicals and the influence of the size and geometry of the confinement space on the catalytic performances is still insufficient. On one hand, the gas-phase radical process is beneficial for controlling the distribution of carbon products leading to the byproducts enriched to the olefin. On the other hand, the radical reactions may also contribute to C–C cleavage and the formation of COx. Currently, a lack of systematic understanding of the initiation and mechanism of gas radical reaction processes exists. Meanwhile, the size and geometry of the confinement space in different dimensional structures play an important role in the radical reaction, and the optimal confinement effect needs to be further explored. (5) The stability of B-based catalyst and its ability to inhibit boric acid leaching need to be further improved. The hydrolysis of B–O–B oligomers could form the active B species, but the complete hydrolysis could lead to the formation of boric acid by B with saturated hydroxyl groups, which could deactivate the catalyst once it leaches from the reaction system because of the strong solubility of such species in water. Without an effective method to prevent the overhydrolysis of the active species, it is not possible to run the ODHP reaction at high C3H8 conversion, which will limit the potential for industrial application of the B catalysts. The single-site B-doped zeolite catalyst is a case that showed improved stability in the ODHP reaction. (60) Modifying the catalyst and enhancing the hydrophobicity of B-based catalyst may also be a potential solution to this issue.
Finally, with the achievements obtained in both catalytic performances and mechanistic understandings, the B-based catalysts have demonstrated significant potential in the oxidative dehydrogenation reaction of propane. As a reaction dominated by the radical pathway, the spatial configuration and dispersion of the active sites and synergism of the surface catalytic cycles and gas-phase reactions are highly important for catalyst design and performance optimization. Studies on these important problems in the future will promote the catalytic performances of B-based materials and open up new opportunities for the practical application of oxidative dehydrogenation techniques for the production of low olefins.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
