 Unfortunately there is no aggregated data provided to summarize into a cohesive XML output. The multiple document excerpts only indicate that the documents are not relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. Since no substantive information is given, I cannot provide a meaningful XML summary. The best response is:

<output>
  <Relevance>No</Relevance>
</output>

The provided excerpts do not contain any details about propane dehydrogenation research, catalysts, or performance enhancements that could be aggregated into a cohesive XML summary. They simply state the irrelevance of acetylene hydrogenation documents to propane dehydrogenation. With no relevant information to synthesize, a meaningful XML output cannot be generated.
