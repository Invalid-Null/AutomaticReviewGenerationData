Quantum Sensing of Electron Transfer Pathways in Natural Photosynthesis Using Time-Resolved High-Field Electron Paramagnetic Resonance/Electron–Nuclear Double Resonance Spectroscopy
Abstract
Photosynthetic integral membrane reaction center (RC) proteins capture and convert sunlight into chemical energy via efficient charge separation achieved through a series of rapid, photoinitiated electron transfer steps. These fast electron transfers create an entangled spin qubit (radical) pair that contains detailed information about the weak magnetic interactions, structure, and dynamics of localized protein environments involved in charge separation events. Herein, we investigate how these entangled electron spin qubits interact with nuclear spins of the protein environment using the high spectral resolution of 130 GHz electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron–nuclear double resonance (ENDOR). Spectroscopic interrogation enabled the observation and probing of protons located in the electron transfer pathway between the membrane-spanning electron pair P+QA– (where P+ is the primary donor, a special pair of bacteriochlorophylls, and QA is the primary quinone acceptor) in the bacterial RC. Spectroscopic analysis reveals hydrogen-bonding interactions involved in regulating the route that light-induced electrons travel through the RC protein during charge separation.

Introduction
Jump To
The natural photosynthetic conversion of solar energy to chemical energy is a unique phenomenon that sustains all highly organized life forms on Earth. (1) The key steps of photosynthetic energy conversion occur in specialized membrane proteins called reaction centers (RCs) and involve rapid, photoinduced sequential electron transfers (ETs) that result in charge separation. In purple bacterial RCs, sequential electron transfer occurs from the primary donor P (a special pair of bacteriochlorophylls) through an intervening bacteriopheophytin acceptor, HA, to the primary quinone acceptor, QA, forming a metastable charge separated state, P+QA– (Figure 1). (2,3) While structural details of these acceptor/donor cofactors have been determined by high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of the bacterial RC, (4−6) thus far, such structures only provide information on the static protein environment. The influence of landscape configurational dynamic interactions within the protein that fine-tune ET processes remains difficult to experimentally resolve.
Figure 1
Figure 1. Schematic representation of the donor–acceptor cofactor arrangement within the RC protein environment of R. sphaeroides. Arrows indicate a unidirectional sequential ET pathway. Upon light excitation, electron transfer occurs from the primary donor, P, to the final quinone acceptor, QB, through the intermediate bacteriopheophytin acceptor, HA, and primary quinone acceptor, QA. Upon double reduction, QB uptakes two protons and leaves the protein. At low temperature, the interquinone ET is blocked and the electron from QA– returns to the primary donor P+.
To accommodate the sudden introduction of charge, local protein environments respond by rearranging the rich H-bond network of the polypeptide environments surrounding the redox cofactors. These rearrangements might involve only small amplitude changes in cofactors or protein side chains, changes too small to be readily detected by conventional X-ray spectroscopy, a technique that cannot directly observe protons. Such subtle structural rearrangements, however, might significantly modulate ET reactions. Of specific interest is determining the involvement of local protein–cofactor interactions in the conformationally gated decay of P+QA–. (7) In Rhodobacter sphaeroides RCs, an electron is transferred within 200 ps from the excited singlet state of the primary donor P to the primary quinone acceptor QA (Figure 1). (2,3) The charge-separated state P+QA– can decay in one of two ways: either by back recombination to the ground state PQA or by forward interquinone ET from QA– to QB, the secondary quinone acceptor. After a two-electron, two-proton reduction, QBH2 is released from the RC, transporting electrons and protons to other redox components in the bacteria. (8) Previously, it was proposed that the movement of QB from a “proximal” to a “distal” site was the gate for interquinone ET; (9,10) however, a number of studies have ruled out such a movement of QB as the gate. (11−15) Furthermore, it is difficult to explain conformational gating of P+QA– recombination by local conformational changes around QB, which is positioned outside of the ET pathways from QA– to P+. Solvent reorganization, conformational changes, and proton rearrangements have been postulated to stabilize the P+QA– state, (16−19) suggesting the other possibility that light-induced changes may be located in the protein environment near QA. The resolution of structure–function relationships in RCs is central to determining the fundamental principles that underlie Nature’s designs for light-energy capture and conversion to stored chemical energy.
An important tool to examine the extraordinary charge transfer properties of RC proteins is a unique entangled spin state formed in photosynthetic RCs. Following ultrafast light-generated electron transfer reactions in photosynthetic RCs, initiated from an excited singlet state, an entangled spin qubit (radical) pair is created. (20−24) While a single electron spin can be considered a classical qubit, the entangled two-qubit pair (two unpaired electron spins) is of special interest in quantum information and quantum sensing applications. (25−28) This important entangled state is detectable in RCs by time-resolved electron paramagnetic resonance (TR-EPR) as a spin-correlated radical pair (SCRP) spectrum that exhibits strong electron spin polarization. (20,21,29−33) Entangled quantum spin states are exceptionally sensitive to weak magnetic interactions, structure, and local environments. Herein, we examine the molecular level regulation of RC ET pathways by investigating a three spin entanglement, two electron spins and one nuclear spin, using high-field TR electron–nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy of the SCRP (Figure 2). Isotopically labeled protein simplifies the high spectral resolution of the observed SCRP-ENDOR spectra and reveals localized RC protein environments involved in the dynamic P+QA– charge separation process.

Preparation of Fe-Removed/Zn-Substituted Deuterated RCs
Deuterated RCs were isolated from the whole cells of R. sphaeroides R-26, which were grown in D2O (99.7%) on deuterated substrates. An Fe-removal/Zn-substitution procedure was done as previously described (34) in H2O buffer solutions using deuterated ubiquinone-10 in place of protonated ubiquinone-10 in the protocol.
High-Field EPR/ENDOR Spectroscopy
EPR measurements were performed on a home-built pulsed high-frequency D-band (130 GHz/4.6T) EPR spectrometer, as described previously, (35) with single mode cylindrical cavity TE011. A fast pulse acquisition system was developed by Dr. A. Astashkin, University of Arizona, on the basis of a 1 GHz arbitrary waveform generator PC card AWG1000 (Chase Scientific Co.). Pulsed TR-EPR spectra of the SCRP were recorded by monitoring the electron spin echo (ESE) from a two microwave (MW) pulse sequence, which followed a 7 ns laser pulse at a fixed delay time (Dt) as a function of magnetic field. Pulsed ENDOR spectra were recorded using a Mims-type sequence of MW and radiofrequency (RF) pulses (laser–Dt–π/2MW–τ–π/2MW–πRF–π/2MW) by monitoring the ESE intensity as a function of the frequency of the RF pulse (Figure S1). (36) RF pulses were generated by an Agilent RF signal generator (model E4400B) and amplified by a 1 kW pulsed amplifier (CPC, model 5T1000). For the 1H-ENDOR experiment, the duration of the πRF-pulse was around 20 μs. Light excitation of the sample was achieved with an optical parametric oscillator (Opotek) pumped by a Nd:YAG laser (Quantel) right in the cavity of the spectrometer for which the output of the laser was coupled to an optical fiber. The optical fiber allows the delivery of up to 2 mJ per pulse to the sample. Samples were held in quartz tubes (i.d. 0.5 mm/o.d. 0.6 mm) and placed in the MW cavity. The cavity was held in an Oxford flow cryostat. The samples were frozen in the dark in the cavity/cryostat, and the temperature was controlled by the Oxford temperature control system.
Results and Discussion
Jump To
To clarify RC light-induced ET pathways and mechanisms of ET regulation at the molecular level, we carried out a high frequency EPR study based on a novel phenomenon that was observed in time-resolved (TR) electron–nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectra of the spin-correlated radical pairs (SCRP) in RCs. (37) The observed effect is the result of both increased spectral resolution and orientational selectivity provided by high magnetic field (HF) EPR (D-band, 130 GHz/4.6 T) and manifests in substantially increased spectral resolution. (31) This effect has been explained as a consequence of SCRP polarization and is observed immediately following light-induced charge separation in RCs to form the radical pair P+QA–. (31,37) Importantly, the positions and amplitudes of ENDOR lines of the SCRP contain information on the interactions of a particular nucleus with both correlated electron spins. (31,38) In this situation, we have a three spin entanglement, two electron spins and one nuclear spin, wherein the magnetic interaction of a particular nucleus with entangled electron spins is directly related to the electronic wave function density on the nuclei. (38) Thus, when the delocalization of the donor and acceptor electron spin wave functions is reconstructed, it is feasible to locate probable ET pathways through the nuclei that have a maximum overlap with the donor and acceptor wave functions. (31) The practical application of this technique, however, is challenging because the ENDOR spectra are complex and consist of a multitude of overlapping lines.
To simplify the assignment of the TR ENDOR lines, we used fully deuterated RC protein in H2O buffer. The 1H-ENDOR spectra of these samples will detect only exchangeable protons and protons of water, i.e., protons that are mainly involved in the formation of the H-bond network within the protein matrix. In addition to being fully deuterated, the nonheme Fe2+ was removed from the RCs and replaced with Zn2+. (34) This is necessary as the paramagnetic nonheme Fe2+ is magnetically coupled to the quinones, which obscure the resolution of g-tensor components of charge separated qubit pairs. (39,40) The 1H-ENDOR spectrum of SCRP of fully deuterated Fe-removed/Zn-substituted RC proteins in a H2O buffer is shown in Figure 3. The comparison to the 1H-ENDOR spectrum of SCRP recorded for protonated RCs shows the simplification of the spectral lines by deuteration (Figure 3B,C).
Figure 3

(A) Chemically reduced QA–; (B, C) spin-correlated radical pair P+QA– created after the laser flash; (D) odd part of spectrum C shows only three nuclei with substantial coupling to the unpaired electrons of P+ and QA– simultaneously. (A, B) Native, protonated RC protein. (C, D) Deuterated RC protein in protonated buffer. The latter spectra are considerably simplified compared to (A) and (B). Time-resolved radical pair P+QA– ENDOR spectra were recorded at the field position H = 4639 mT (see Figure 4), close to the gY extreme of the QA– with delay-after-laser flash = 2 μs, π/2 = 50 ns, τ = 200 ns, laser excitation λ = 550 nm, πRF = 20 μs, and T = 50 K (see the Supporting Information).
As detailed previously, the SCRP ENDOR spectra can be decomposed into odd and even parts. (31) The odd part of the spectrum consists of the derivative-type lines (antiphase doublets) and shows the protons that have substantial spin density overlap from both the donor and acceptor electron wave functions; i.e., protons that have interactions with both of the correlated electron spins P+and QA– (see Figure 2). The even part of the spectrum represents nuclei coupled only with QA–, if the ENDOR is recorded on the QA– EPR line, or from both unpaired electron spins, if the ENDOR is recorded at magnetic fields where EPR signals from P+ and QA– overlap (see Figure 4). The odd part of the spectrum of deuterated RCs in H2O consists of only three derivative-type lines observed on both sides of the 1H-Larmor frequency (Figure 3D). Note that separation of the corresponding pairs of the derivative-type lines is related to the QA– electron spin hyperfine splitting (hfs) with a proton, while the intensity of each derivative-type line, so-called antiphase doublets, is related to the same proton hfs with the more distant electron spin of P+ (Figure 2). The intensity of these antiphase doublets is proportional to b2, where b is hfs with P+. When one considers that for distant protons the hyperfine coupling is mainly dipolar, the intensity of antiphase doublets will drop down as r–6, where r is the distance between electron and nuclear spins. (16,34)

Figure 4. Orientation-selective 1H-ENDOR (circles) of the lines shown in Figure 3D. Top: HF EPR spectrum of SCRP P+QA–. Arrows show the position of the g-tensor canonical picks for primary donor P+ and acceptor QA–. The magnetic field axis indicates at which spectral position the ENDOR was detected. Lines are theoretical fits of orientation-selective ENDOR when protons are along the Y-axis of the QA– g-tensor. The theoretical fits with protons positioned along the X-axis (black dashed line) and Z-axis (blue dashed line) of the QA– g-tensor cannot satisfactorily reproduce the orientation behavior of the ENDOR lines.
In order to identify these lines, the ENDOR orientational dependence within the orientationally resolved spectrum of the quinone anion radical was measured (Figure 4). ENDOR lines were only detectable in the XY plane of the QA– g-tensor (between gX and gY components). In the XZ and YZ planes, the spectral lines were broadened and their intensities dropped drastically. This type of behavior is typically observed for a powder spectrum in the plane with the steepest angular dependence, dH/dΩ, and is related to the strain effect. The observed lines in the XY plane of the QA– g-tensor belong to three resolved protons and have a similar dependence: small hyperfine splitting along the X-magnetic axis (A = 0.38, 0.21, and 0.1 MHz) and large hfs along the Y-axis (A = 0.92, 0.5, and 0.1 MHz). This dependence is due to the weak dipole–dipole interaction.
A complete orientational dependence would allow the distance from QA– and the direction to the detectable proton in the magnetic axis of QA– to be determined within the point-dipole approximation. Unfortunately, we are unable to measure the orientational dependence in all planes; however, the theoretical analysis of the obtained dependence allows us to estimate the position and orientation of the detected protons with respect to QA–. We have analyzed the experimental dependence within three models, where the proton is located along the X-, Y-, or Z-axis of the QA– g-tensor. Only a proton located along the Y-axis gives a satisfactory fit to the orientational dependence for the line having the largest (red lines) and middle (green lines) interactions (see Figure 4). For lines with the smallest hfs (brown lines in Figure 4), the error is too big and the orientational dependence cannot be estimated. Importantly, theoretical modeling shows not only dipole interactions but also an isotropic (direct) spin density on these protons from QA– in the range of ∼160–800 kHz. In agreement with the expected distribution of the wave functions, the closer the proton is located to the quinone (higher dipole interaction), the bigger is the isotropic contribution. Thus, even distant protons with weak dipole interactions (brown lines in Figure 4) have appreciable direct spin densities from ET cofactors. When one takes into account the incomplete orientational dependence and high spread of the data points, only rough estimates of direction and distances can be predicted with the model of point-dipole approximation; i.e., detectable protons should be within the cone of 40° along the Y-axis of the QA– g-tensor and in a range of 7–12 Å from the center of the QA–. Note, we examined the RC structure for protons located in the direction of the primary donor; otherwise, as described above, the derivative-type ENDOR line cannot be detected due to negligible hfs with P+.
The inspection of the RC crystal structure of R. sphaeroides within these parameters determined from the HF ENDOR reveals only two amino acid exchangeable protons in this region. (6) The two protons correspond to the amino acid residues Glu104L and Trp100L. Both of these residues are involved in hydrogen bonding to the intermediate electron acceptor bacteriopheophytin, HA (Figure 5).
Figure 5
Figure 5. Structural position of QA, HA, and amino acid residues Glu104L and Trp100L H-bonded to HA as shown by the dashed lines. Note: the gX-axis is directed along the C–O bond.
The SCRP ENDOR results provide spectroscopic evidence that these protons have appreciable spin density from both the donor P+ and acceptor QA–. Thus, the spin density map indicates with high probability that these protein residue protons are involved in the ET process by way of modulating H-bond strength within the protein environment and/or stabilizing the P+QA– charge separated state. A mechanism for regulating the route of the through protein electron transfer pathway could be the switching on/off of the H-bonds between HA and these amino acid residues. Indeed, Glu104L was one of the first residues subjected to mutation in order to clarify its importance for the ET kinetics. (41) A small, however, clear effect (up to 30%) of the slow down of the forward ET from HA– to QA and increase in the back recombination rate from HA– to P+ was observed for this mutant RC. (41) We are not aware of any similar kinetic measurements done for a Trp100L mutant, but our results suggest that the mutation of this residue would similarly influence both the forward and back recombination ET. The effect of elimination (upon mutation) of one H-bond within the cofactor–protein interface might be relatively small compared to the entire H-bonding network involved in the ET regulation. (41,42) The disruption of the H-bonding network in several places should produce a much stronger effect, as has been observed for multiple mutant systems. (43,44) Note, H-bonds might modulate the redox potentials of the cofactors, thus changing the driving force for the ET reactions and, as a consequence, the ET kinetics. (45−47) Previous HF EPR/ENDOR studies compared P+QA– to the ground state structure and did not observe any reorientation of QA or reorganization of the surrounding protein matrix. (48,49) Likewise, crystallographic studies of dark vs light structures of the bRC determined at room temperature or frozen at 100 K show no significant experimental differences in the Fourier map. (50,51) As no significant molecular rearrangements were observed, as reported in this prior work, charge stabilization must occur by the proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism at the level of the H-bond network, and the SCPR ENDOR/selective deuteration experiments have revealed, for the first time, two H-bonds involved in the light-induced ET pathway. The rearrangement of the H-bond network in response to charge separation might influence not only coupling for the ET reaction but also the driving force, (52,53) and such fine-tuning by the protein matrix could be an important factor in the photosynthetic RC’s high quantum yield of charge separation.
Conclusions
Jump To
In summary, we have demonstrated how the probable ET pathways through a protein environment can be mapped using quantum sensing with TR EPR/ENDOR spectroscopy of isotopically labeled RC samples. The application of these techniques will provide new insights into dynamic molecular interactions involved in photoinitiated charge separation processes in both natural and artificial photosynthetic assemblies. Nature’s RC entangled electron spins of photogenerated radical pairs are an excellent model system, and further studies of these well-defined molecular systems will lead to an improved understanding of quantum spin coherences and quantum science in general.

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. Schematic representation of the donor–acceptor cofactor arrangement within the RC protein environment of R. sphaeroides. Arrows indicate a unidirectional sequential ET pathway. Upon light excitation, electron transfer occurs from the primary donor, P, to the final quinone acceptor, QB, through the intermediate bacteriopheophytin acceptor, HA, and primary quinone acceptor, QA. Upon double reduction, QB uptakes two protons and leaves the protein. At low temperature, the interquinone ET is blocked and the electron from QA– returns to the primary donor P+.
Figure 2
Figure 2. Energy level diagram (A) and stick diagrams of EPR (B) and ENDOR (C) spectra for two interacting electron spins in thermal (Boltzman) equilibrium and spin-entangled (spin-correlated radical pair) states. The stick diagram of SCRP ENDOR demonstrates the formation of an antiphase doublet with the separation between derivative-type lines corresponding to a hyperfine interaction with spin A (aA) and line width of the antiphase doublet corresponding to a hyperfine interaction with spin B (aB).
Figure 3
Figure 3. Mims-type 1H-ENDOR spectra of Fe-removed/Zn-substituted RCs recorded at a 130 GHz microwave frequency. (A) Chemically reduced QA–; (B, C) spin-correlated radical pair P+QA– created after the laser flash; (D) odd part of spectrum C shows only three nuclei with substantial coupling to the unpaired electrons of P+ and QA– simultaneously. (A, B) Native, protonated RC protein. (C, D) Deuterated RC protein in protonated buffer. The latter spectra are considerably simplified compared to (A) and (B). Time-resolved radical pair P+QA– ENDOR spectra were recorded at the field position H = 4639 mT (see Figure 4), close to the gY extreme of the QA– with delay-after-laser flash = 2 μs, π/2 = 50 ns, τ = 200 ns, laser excitation λ = 550 nm, πRF = 20 μs, and T = 50 K (see the Supporting Information).
Figure 4
Figure 4. Orientation-selective 1H-ENDOR (circles) of the lines shown in Figure 3D. Top: HF EPR spectrum of SCRP P+QA–. Arrows show the position of the g-tensor canonical picks for primary donor P+ and acceptor QA–. The magnetic field axis indicates at which spectral position the ENDOR was detected. Lines are theoretical fits of orientation-selective ENDOR when protons are along the Y-axis of the QA– g-tensor. The theoretical fits with protons positioned along the X-axis (black dashed line) and Z-axis (blue dashed line) of the QA– g-tensor cannot satisfactorily reproduce the orientation behavior of the ENDOR lines.
