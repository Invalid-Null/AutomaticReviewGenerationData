1. Introduction
A unique combination of acid-base and textural characteristics of the support with the electronic state and dispersion of the supported metal makes the Pt/Al2O3 composition indispensable in many catalytic processes. First of all, Pt/Al2O3 catalysts are widely employed in oil refining. The platforming process developed in UOP did not lose its importance and is now among the most large-tonnage industrial processes [1,2]. Due to persistent demand for this process in the scheme of hydrocarbon processing, a considerable progress was made in understanding the catalyst design and mechanism. As a result, the alumina-platinum system can be considered to a great extent as a model adsorption catalyst [3].
At the same time, the Pt/Al2O3 composition is used not only in catalytic reforming but also in such industrially important processes as isomerization of normal paraffins, hydrogenation of aromatic hydrocarbons, and dehydrogenation of naphthenes and alkanes [4].To adjust the catalyst properties to the requirements of a particular reaction, the catalyst is modified by adding the second metal or some anions (halogen or sulfate ions) to enhance an acidic function of the support. As for dehydrogenation of alkanes, an alkaline promoter or magnesium cations are introduced into alumina to suppress coking initiated by acid sites of the support [4,5]. To obtain non-acid supports for dehydrogenation of light and higher alkanes, mixed magnesium-aluminum oxides are synthesized from the corresponding layered double hydroxides (LDH). They have a controllable moderate basicity, high thermal stability and a developed surface area [[6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]].
Layered double hydroxides or hydrotalcite-like materials have the general formula
and consist of the brucite-like layers in which divalent cations M2+ are partially isomorphically substituted by trivalent cations M3+ with close ionic radii (in the case of MgAl-LDH, magnesium cations are substituted by aluminum cations). Therewith, an excess positive charge of the layers is compensated by hydrated anions An– residing in the interlayer space. It should be noted that the LDH structure exists in quite a narrow range of M2+/M3+ ratios. LDH is commonly formed at 0.2 < x < 0.33, which corresponds to M2+/M3+ = 2–4 [6,11]. Upon calcination at 400–650 °C the layered structure is destroyed to form the mixed oxide phase.
Pt/MgAlOx catalysts synthesized with the use of MgAl-LDH as a support precursor are the object of intensive studies [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]]. Investigation of the interaction of chloroplatinic acid with MgAl-LDH showed that the amount of anionic complexes of platinum(IV) adsorbed from an aqueous solution and their localization in the support structure are strongly determined by the nature of interlayer anions in LDH and ability of the anions to ionic exchange. Thus, the exchange of interlayer OH– anions for [PtCl6]2– was more pronounced as compared to the exchange of interlayer CO32– anions, with predominant localization of metal complex in the interlayer space. As a result, platinum reduction under constrained conditions of the layered structure was accompanied by the formation of particles with unusual planar morphology [9]. These particles differ from the alumina-supported platinum by the electronic state (a greater fraction of Ptо) and an increased dehydrogenation activity [10].
To combine the unique properties of alumina (high specific surface area, strength, and pore space structure) with the advantages of mixed aluminum-magnesium oxides, a method was proposed for modification of alumina, which consists in the deposition of thin layers of magnesium-aluminum hydroxide on the surface of γ-Al2O3. The magnesium-aluminum component with basic properties, being introduced into the support, will decrease the acidity of alumina, which can often cause side reactions and catalyst deactivation. It should be noted that MgAl-LDH formation on the surface of γ-Al2O3 can be implemented with participation of the surface alumina atoms. For example, the formation of mixed hydroxides with hydrotalcite-like structure was observed upon adsorption of Ni(II) amine complexes from aqueous solutions on the γ-Al2O3 surface [18]. Similar data were acquired when studying the sorption of nitrate salts of Co(II), Ni(II) or Zn(II) on γ-Al2O3 in the presence of ammonium nitrate [19,20].
The present work is aimed at the deliberate synthesis of a layered aluminum-magnesium hydroxide on the γ-Al2O3 surface for modifying the acid-base properties of support and using the supported layered structure to anchor the Pt(IV) chloride complexes. After thermal activation, the synthesized catalyst Pt/MgAlOx/Al2O3 was tested in a model reaction of propane dehydrogenation.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
Synthesis of the layered double hydroxide on the γ-Al2O3 surface was carried out in two steps. The first step was incipient wetness impregnation of γ-Al2O3 with an aqueous solution containing Mg(NO3)2 (5.0 mol/L) and (NH2)2CO in a molar ratio 1:2. The second step consisted in precipitation of magnesium hydroxide and its interaction with the surface aluminum ions under hydrothermal conditions. The study was performed with γ-Al2O3 (CONDEA) having the grain size 0.2-0.5 mm, specific surface area (SBET) 200 m2/g, pore volume 0.50 cm3/g, sodium and iron content of 0.003 and 0.021 wt%, respectively. The alumina sample impregnated with Mg(NO3)2 and (NH2)2CO solutions was placed in an autoclave and kept at a specified temperature for 6 h. The synthesis temperature of MgAl-LDH on the γ-Al2O3 surface was varied in the range of 100–180 °C. This resulted in the formation of samples with supported magnesium-aluminum hydroxide in the carbonate form (MgAl-CO3/Al2O3). The modified alumina samples were washed to remove unreacted components and calcined at 550 °C; after that, the content of magnesium was measured.
Calcination of MgAl-CO3/Al2O3 samples at 550 °C led to destruction of the hydroxide phase and formation of supported mixed oxide MgAlOx/Al2O3; a subsequent hydration in freshly prepared distilled water restored the layered structure and resulted in the formation of supported layered hydroxide with OH– counterions (MgAl-OH/Al2O3).
Sorption of chloroplatinic acid (AURAT Ltd., Specs. 6-09-2026-87) was carried out from an excess of aqueous solutions using MgAl-OH/Al2O3. The m(support):m(solution) ratio was 1:25. The metal complex was completely recovered from the impregnating solution for 1 h. Catalysts with the platinum content 0.3 and 2.0 wt% were obtained from solutions with the platinum concentration 0.12 and 0.8 g/L. The same method was used to synthesize platinum samples with unmodified alumina and bulk MgAl-OH as the supports. The latter one with Mg/Al = 3 was obtained by coprecipitation using metal nitrates in the presence of sodium carbonate (C = 1 mol/L); a detailed description of the procedure can be found in [[8], [9], [10]]. Platinum content in the reference samples was 0.3 wt%. In addition, the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst with a higher platinum content (4.5 wt%) was synthesized for the NMR study.
Samples of Pt/MgAlOx/Al2O3 catalysts were obtained by calcination at 550 °C and reduction in flowing hydrogen at 550 °C. Concentrations of platinum and components of the support (Mg, Al) in solutions and samples after their dissolution in acids were found by atomic absorption spectroscopy on an AA6300 Shimadzu spectrometer.
2.2. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was made on a D8 Advance (Bruker) diffractometer using a parallel Cu-Kα radiation in the 2θ angle range of 5–80°. The scanning step was 0.05° and the step time was 5 s.
The nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were measured at 77.4 K on an ASAP-2020 M (Micromeritics) volumetric vacuum static unit. The equilibrium relative pressures ranged from 10–3 to 0.996 P/P0. The samples calcined at 500 °C were evacuated at 300 °C for 6 h. Specific surface area was calculated from the adsorption isotherm in the range of equilibrium relative pressures of nitrogen vapor, P/P0 = 0.05–0.30. The adsorption pore volume was found from the nitrogen adsorption at P/P0 = 0.990. The pore size distribution curves were obtained by BJH method applied to the adsorption isotherm. The calculations were based on a cylindrical model of free pores.
Adsorption of carbon dioxide was performed on a Sorptomatic-1900 automated volumetric vacuum static unit. Before measurements, samples were treated in vacuum (10–2 mm Hg) at 300 °C for 12 h. To determine the presence of micropores with the size below 1.0 nm, the adsorption isotherms for carbon dioxide were measured at 0 °C in the region of relative pressures P/Po = 4⋅10–5- 0.030. This measurement is necessary for a correct comparison of the samples when determining their adsorption capacity to CO2. Basic properties of the support were estimated from CO2 adsorption at elevated temperatures [21,22]. The adsorption isotherm of carbon dioxide measured at a pressure up to 1 atm and temperature of 30 °C was used to calculate the total capacity of a sample to this gas (physically and chemically adsorbed CO2). The sample was then evacuated to 10–2 mm Hg at the same temperature for an hour (a removal of physisorbed molecules) to obtain the second isotherm. The difference in the amount of adsorbed CO2 allowed us to determine the part of CO2 that was retained on the surface owing to its chemical nature. Then, to estimate the strength of basic sites, the evacuation step was performed at 100, 200 and 300 °C.
The microimages were obtained on a JSM-6460 LV (JEOL) scanning electron microscope. To diminish the recharge effect, the samples were covered with a conductive gold film ∼20 nm in thickness. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were taken on a JEM-2010 (JEOL) electron microscope. The test samples were prepared as suspensions in ethanol, deposited on standard copper gauzes, and then placed in the chamber of the electron microscope.
Diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra (UV–vis DRS) of supported platinum complexes were recorded in the 11000–54000 cm–1 range on a UV-2501 PC (Shimadzu) spectrophotometer with an ISR-240 A diffusion reflection attachment. Barium sulfate was used as a reference sample.
The 195Pt NMR spectra were obtained by means of an Avance-400 NMR spectrometer (Bruker) using multinuclear sensor SB4 (MAS). The samples under investigation were placed in a 4-mm zirconia rotor, and spinning at a magic angle (54°44′) with a frequency of 104 Hz was performed. An aqueous solution of H2[PtCl6] with the concentration of 0.03 mol/L was used as an external reference.
To determine the temperature range for formation of the supported oxide phase and for the oxidation of carbon deposits on the surface of deactivated samples, the TG-DTA method on an STA-449C Jupiter (Netzsch) instrument was employed. The measurements were made in air in a dynamic mode at a heating rate of 10 °C.
2.3. Propane dehydrogenation
Catalytic testing in propane dehydrogenation were carried out using a stainless steel fixed bed tubular reactor at 550 °C, under atmospheric pressure, with a weight hourly space velocity 4 h–1 and H2/C3H8 molar ratio 0.25. After being loaded in the tubular reactor, the catalyst (1.0 g) was purged with He for 15 min and reduced in situ in flowing hydrogen for 1 h at 550 °C. The reaction products were analyzed with on-line gas chromatography. A flame ionization detector and a 50 m × 0.53 mm Rt-alumina PLOT column were used. After 5 h of the reaction, the H2–C3H8 flow was switched to pure He, and the sample was cooled down to room temperature.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis of supported hydrotalcite-like phase (MgAl-LDH/Al2O3)
Synthesis of the layered double hydroxides with hydrotalcite-like structures commonly includes coprecipitation of bi- and trivalent metal hydroxides in a certain ratio [6,7,11,23]. However, in the synthesis of supported LDH phase, the use of conventional precipitants like Na2CO3, (NH4)2CO3, NH4OH or NaOH leads to the formation of a precipitate only on the outer surface of support grains and in the bulk of solution. For precipitation in the pores of support, substances that can readily be hydrolyzed at elevated temperatures are used [24]. Carbamide was chosen as such substance in our work. The mechanism of its hydrolysis includes the formation of ammonium cyanate followed by its fast conversion to ammonium carbonate. The rate of carbamide hydrolysis is easily controlled by temperature. In the process, pH of the solution is 9, which is sufficient for coprecipitation of aluminum and magnesium hydroxides. This leads to the formation of LDH with carbonate counterions [25].
The LDH phase formed directly on the support surface under hydrothermal conditions because precipitation of magnesium hydroxide and formation of the second participant of the synthesis, aluminum hydroxide, occurred simultaneously. It is known that under hydrothermal conditions the boehmite phase AlO(OH) forms from γ-Al2O3 [26]. In [27], we quantified the fraction of AlO(OH) that formed under different conditions (temperature and time) of the hydrothermal treatment of γ-Al2O3. The boehmite content was assessed by XRD analysis from the area of (002) reflex typical of this phase using a calibration dependence. Its amount can readily be adjusted by changing the temperature and time of hydrothermal treatment.
Variation of the synthesis temperature of MgAl-CO3 LDH on the γ-Al2O3 surface in the range of 100–180 °C (Fig. 1) revealed that the layered hydrotalcite-like phase is formed already at 100 °C [28]. On the diffraction pattern, a broad peak appears in the region of small angles with the characteristic distance d003 = 0.853 nm. Its presence can be attributed to neither alumina nor individual hydroxide phases of aluminum or magnesium; it is typical of the layered structure of aluminum-magnesium hydrotalcite. At 120 °C the intensity of this peak increases and an additional peak appears near the 006 reflection of hydrotalcite. According to chemical analysis data, these structural changes are accompanied by an increase in magnesium content in the samples from 2.8 to 4.5 wt% at the synthesis temperature of 100 and 120 °C, respectively. A further elevation of the synthesis temperature to 150 °C increases only the crystallinity of the deposited LDH phase (basal reflections 003 and 006 become narrow and more intensive), without changes in the magnesium content of the sample. When the synthesis temperature is raised to 180 °C, a strong broadening of the 003 peak occurs and the 006 reflection disappears virtually completely, which testifies to a partial decomposition of the layered LDH structure. This may result from a violation of the ratio between magnesium and aluminum cations in the deposited phase that is necessary for the existence of the layered structure [6,11,23]. Further studies dealing with the transformation of LDH on the alumina surface and deposition of platinum were carried out using the sample synthesized at 120 °C.

The formation of a layered aluminum-magnesium hydroxide on the γ-Al2O3 surface was also supported by electron microscopy. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination of the resulting samples showed (Fig. 2) that after the synthesis the alumina surface was covered with the layers of hydrotalcite-like phase having the morphology of rounded plates 10–20 nm in thickness and 50–100 nm in width [29]. One can observe that the amount of the LDH phase on the Al2O3 surface can be controlled by varying the synthesis temperature.

3.2. Investigation of the textural and basic properties of alumina with supported magnesium-aluminum phase
Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms for alumina samples before and after the deposition of LDH were measured after precalcination at 550 °C. The introduction of aluminum-magnesium phase did not change the shape of isotherms corresponding to the type IV isotherms with a hysteresis loop typical of capillary condensation in mesopores (Fig. 1S a). The analysis of textural characteristics showed that the presence of MgAlOx phase in γ-Al2O3 did not produce any significant changes. A minor decrease in the specific surface area from 200 to 170 m2/g was observed when the amount of supported phase was 4.5 wt% with respect to magnesium. For all the tested samples, the pore size distribution curves were monomodal in the region of 5–15 nm, with a predominant contribution of mesopores (Fig. 1S b). For the initial alumina and the sample with a lower amount of the modifier (2.8% Mg), the pore size distribution curves coincided and had a maximum at 11 nm. An increase in the amount of supported phase was accompanied by redistribution toward larger mesopores with the size of 10–15 nm with a maximum at 12 nm.
The effect of supported magnesium-aluminum phase on the basic properties of alumina support after high-temperature treatment was studied using the method of CO2 adsorption [21,22]. Before the experiment, samples of initial alumina and alumina with supported LDH were calcined in air at 550 °C for 3 h. According to thermal analysis (Fig. 2S), such treatment is sufficient for transition of the hydroxide phase into a mixed magnesium-aluminum oxide MgAlOx. First, sorption of carbon dioxide at 0 °C was performed to determine the amount of micropores, which could strongly distort the assessment of basic properties of the surface. The fraction of micropores was found to be negligible and similar in all the tested samples.
The effect of chemical properties of the surface on its capacity to CO2 was estimated at the adsorption temperature of 30 °C. The initial adsorption isotherm was compared to that obtained after evacuation at the same temperature. The first isotherm characterizes the total capacity of the support to CO2. The evacuation step followed by adsorption made it possible to estimate the fraction of weakly bound physisorbed carbon dioxide. The difference in the obtained values is related to chemical adsorption on the basic surface sites. Thus, this approach allowed a quantitative differentiation between CO2 anchored by physical and chemical adsorption and made it possible to compare these amounts for the unmodified alumina and alumina with supported MgAlOx. Fig. 3(a) shows that MgAlOx/Al2O3 has a higher capacity to carbon dioxide. At that, the fraction of physisorbed molecules is close for both samples; the observed difference is caused by different chemical nature of the surface, namely, by a higher basicity of the modified support. Data on CO2 chemisorption are usually employed to estimate the amount of basic sites. Although different orientations of this molecule upon its adsorption on the surface of oxides are possible, the amount of basic sites is calculated from the stoichiometry of one CO2 molecule per one site [21,30]. Thus, upon deposition of MgAlOx on alumina, the amount of basic sites increased by a factor of 2.3. A significant difference in basic properties is retained when the evacuation temperature is raised from 30 to 300 °C (Fig. 3(b)). The total amount of the surface sites able to retain CO2 decreases; nevertheless, strong chemisorption sites are present even under the most severe evacuation conditions (300 °C).

The obtained data on changes in surface morphology and on the porous structure of alumina (there are no appreciable changes in the pore size and pore size distribution) allow us to conclude that the modification of alumina support occurs precisely due to the formation and fixation of LDH on its surface, and not as a result of the presence of the mixture separate phases of Al2O3 and MgAl-LDH in the samples. It is also confirmed by the fact that in the synthesis of the samples there is no formation of an additional precipitate with a particle size smaller than the alumina granules.
3.3. Formation of platinum sites on the MgAl-LDH/Al2O3
For platinum anchoring, the deposited MgAl-CO3 was transformed in the activated form. To this end, the MgAl-CO3/Al2O3 sample was calcined and then rehydrated in water. Such treatment leads to the formation of mixed magnesium-aluminum oxide at the first step and then, owing to the “memory effect”, to MgAl-OH/Al2O3. The resulting LDH with the predominant content of interlayer OH− ions has good ability to exchange with anionic platinum complexes [PtCl6]2– [9].
All the synthesis step indicated above were accompanied by structural changes displayed on Fig. 4. The analysis of the obtained diffraction patterns revealed that after replacement of the interlayer carbonate ion by the hydroxide ion (Fig. 4, curves 1 and 3) the basal distance d003 decreased from 0.796 to 0.741 nm (Table 1), which was related to a smaller size of the interlayer hydroxide ion in comparison with the carbonate ion. The subsequent adsorption of [PtCl6]2−, even at its low content (0.3 wt% Pt), produced a noticeable increase in the d003 distance, from 0.741 to 0.752 nm (Fig. 4, curves 3 and 4), which agrees with the idea that larger anionic complexes are intercalated in the interlayer space of LDH. Calcination of the samples and reduction in flowing H2 (Fig. 4, curve 5) are followed by decomposition of the layered structure of the support and formation of the Pt/MgAlOx/Al2O3 catalyst. Peaks of metallic platinum are not observed on the diffraction patterns; this may be related to both the low content of the metal and its highly disperse state. It should be noted that all the reported treatments do not change the structure of the alumina support: the lattice parameter of γ-Al2O3 and crystallite sizes (coherent scattering region, CSR) for all the samples remain constant at all steps of the synthesis (Table 1).

To elucidate the effect of the proposed type of alumina modification on the chemical composition of platinum precursor on the support surface and its anchoring, the adsorbed complexes were studied by UV–vis DR and NMR spectroscopy.
Fig. 5 shows UV–vis DR spectra of the platinum complexes with close platinum contents, which are adsorbed on Al2O3 and MgAl-OH/Al2O3. It is seen that the well-defined absorption bands at 27,300 and 38,100 cm–1, which are typical of platinum in chloride complexes [31], are observed only for the sample with supported layered hydroxide. However, mostly the hydrolyzed forms of platinum complexes are present on the surface of unmodified alumina, although it has less pronounced basic properties [[31], [32], [33]]. A similar result was obtained in our earlier work for bulk layered magnesium-aluminum hydroxides [9]. Thus, during the interaction of chloroplatinate with magnesium-aluminum hydroxide MgAl-OH, its anchoring was also not accompanied by a noticeable hydrolysis, and the electronic spectra had the bands typical of the Pt(IV) chloride complex (Fig. 3S).

An efficient method that allows relating the surface properties and the anchoring mechanism of platinum complexes is 195Pt MAS NMR. It is known that this method makes it possible to acquire information on both the composition of adsorbed complexes and the features of their interaction with the surface [34,35]. Investigation of [PtCl6]2– complexes adsorbed on the support surface showed that 195Pt NMR signals are observed only if there occurs the formation of outer-sphere complexes with preservation or slight distortion of their octahedral symmetry. So, anchoring of the complex on the alumina surface, when inner-sphere complexes are formed by replacement of one or several chloride ligands of the [PtCl6]2– anion by hydroxyl groups of support (1), is accompanied by a considerable decrease in the intensity and broadening of the peaks, or NMR signals are not detected [[34], [35], [36]].
At the same time, it was shown [10] that if the support is represented by MgAl-OH, the 195Pt NMR spectrum contains signals corresponding to chloride complex [PtCl6]2– and monosubstituted chlorohydroxo complex [PtCl5(OH)]2− (Fig. 4S). Hence, anchoring of platinum(IV) complexes on the surface of this support does not produce substantial changes in the chemical composition of the complex and distortions of its geometry; the anchoring may occur via electrostatic interaction between anionic complexes and positively charged brucite-like layers (2). It should be noted that the indicated signals in the NMR spectra of [PtCl6]2-/MgAl-OH samples were observed in a wide range of platinum concentrations, from 10 to 2 wt%, without losses in their intensity during a long-term storage [10].

Al(Mg)+–2OH−–Al(Mg)+ + [PtCl6]2- → Al(Mg)+–[PtCl6]2-–Al(Mg)+ + 2OH-
A comparison of 195Pt MAS NMR spectra obtained for the platinum complexes anchored on the initial and modified alumina (Fig. 6) revealed that in the presence of supported MgAl-OH the anchoring of even a smaller amount of complexes gives more intense signals corresponding to the chloride and monosubstituted platinum chlorohydroxo complex. Hence, modification of alumina by the synthesis of supported magnesium-aluminum hydroxide affects the mechanism of metal complex anchoring. In the case of chloroplatinate anchoring on alumina, we consider a mechanism including coordination binding (1). For supported layered hydroxide phase, the anchoring through exchange with interlayer anions (2) can be assumed. Earlier it was shown [10] that such anchoring (2) leads to modification of the properties of supported platinum. According to XPS data, an increase is observed in the fraction of reduced platinum species Pto having a higher dehydrogenation activity.

The HRTEM investigation of the surface of the Pt/MgAlOx/Al2O3 sample reduced at 550 °C (platinum content 2 wt%, magnesium content 4.5 wt%, Fig. 7) showed the absence of pure alumina segments. The entire surface of Al2O3 was covered with translucent layers of magnesium-aluminum oxide having different thickness. Microanalysis of different segments of the surface (Fig. 8) revealed a correlation between platinum content and magnesium amount. The greater is the thickness of supported phase and hence the amount of magnesium on the segment under consideration, the higher is the content of supported platinum. This is illustrated by two of the studied regions differing in the amount of supported phase and the content of platinum. This observation confirms an earlier assumption that anchoring of metal complex proceeds mainly with participation of supported layered hydroxide; as a result, platinum particles are present in the supported magnesium-aluminum phase. The average particle size of supported platinum was found to be no more than 2 nm (Fig. 9).

3.4. Catalytic properties in propane dehydrogenation
The Pt/MgAlOx/Al2O3 (Mg 4.5 wt%) sample with platinum content 0.3 wt% was tested in propane dehydrogenation as a model reaction. Its catalytic properties were compared with the alumina platinum sample 0.3%Pt/γ-Al2O3 and with 0.3%Pt/MgAlOx obtained from bulk MgAl-OH. Prior to testing, all the samples were calcined at 550 °C and reduced in a hydrogen flow at 550 °C.
Propane conversion and selectivity of propylene formation versus reaction time are shown in Fig. 10. Catalytic properties of Pt/MgAlOx/Al2O3 differ from those of the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/MgAlOx obtained from the bulk LDH. Similar to Pt/Al2O3, the catalytic activity is high, but deactivation dynamics is close to that of the Pt/MgAlOx (Fig. 10(a)). However, in comparison with platinum supported on mixed magnesium-aluminum oxide, Pt/MgAlOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 samples showed a lower selectivity for propylene formation (Fig. 10(b)). This difference is most pronounced in the initial period of the reaction. Analysis of the obtained products revealed that the lower selectivity was caused by a greater contribution of the C-C cleavage reactions leading to methane, ethane and ethylene. Nevertheless, the Pt/MgAlOx/Al2O3 sample showed a slightly greater yield of the target product (taking into account the total propane conversion and selectivity of propylene formation) in comparison with Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/MgAlOx samples (Fig. 10(c)).

The main distinction between Pt/Al2O3 catalyst and samples with magnesium-aluminum phase (bulk or supported) is the rate of their deactivation. Higher basicity of these materials determines lower deactivation rate. Deactivation parameter (DP = (Xinit – Xfinal)/Xinit⋅ 100, where Xinit is the propane conversion after 10 min of the reaction and Xfinal is the propane conversion after 5 h of the reaction) was estimated using the values of propane conversion. For the γ-Al2O3 support having the least basicity, DP was equal to 50%, whereas in the case of magnesium-aluminum phase, both bulk and supported, the deactivation parameter did not exceed 20–30%. This difference can be attributed to a lower ability of magnesium-aluminum systems to catalyze oligomerization and formation of high-molecular products (C4+) of the reaction, which are coke precursors (Fig. 10(d)).
Deactivated Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/MgAlOx/Al2O3 samples were studied by thermal analysis in air. The amount of coke deposited on the catalysts after dehydrogenation reaction for 5 h was measured. As seen from Fig. 11, in addition to the low-temperature region of weight losses caused by water removal, there is also the high-temperature region with the maxima at 420 and 480 °C, which appears due to oxidation of carbon deposits. An increasing basicity of the support decreases the fraction of coke oxidizable at a higher temperature. Differences in the burning temperatures allow distinguishing coke deposited on the support and on the supported metal [[37], [38], [39]]. The low temperature zone at about 300–350 °C corresponds to burning of the coke that is deposited on Pt or nearby in a small amount. The high temperature peak located at about 350–520 °C corresponds to burning of the coke that is deposited on the support and has a lower H/C ratio. The possible inhomogeneity and appearance of several maxima in the high-temperature region are attributed to different graphitization degree of carbon deposits. Hence, the synthesis of magnesium-aluminum phase on Al2O3 not only decreased the total amount of coke, but also redistributed the adsorbed carbon deposits according to their ‘quality’ related with a decrease in the fraction of ‘high-temperature’ coke. Thus, the Pt/MgAlOx/Al2O3 catalyst is more stable and can be regenerated under milder conditions.

4. Conclusions
Layered magnesium-aluminum hydroxides were synthesized on the surface of γ-Al2O3 with the involvement of aluminum atoms from the support surface. It was shown that the amount of deposited phase can be controlled by the synthesis temperature, and its transformation at different steps of the catalyst synthesis can be monitored by XRD analysis. Such modification of alumina not only increased its basicity, but also changed the mechanism of platinum complexes anchoring during the synthesis of supported catalysts. XRD, UV–vis DRS, NMR and HRTEM data suggest that adsorption of metal complexes occurs via the exchange of interlayer anions of supported layered magnesium-aluminum hydroxide for chloroplatinate with subsequent predominant localization of disperse platinum particles in the magnesium-aluminum phase.
Although a significant difference in dehydrogenation activity of platinum deposited on the initial and modified alumina was not observed under the chosen conditions of the model reaction of propane dehydrogenation, the catalyst synthesized using the supported LDH provides a higher stability and can be regenerated under milder conditions. The forthcoming multicycle experiments will allow us to estimate unambiguously the potential of the Pt/MgAlOx/Al2O3 catalyst for dehydrogenation of light alkanes.
In any case, the deliberate synthesis of hydrotalcite-like phase on the alumina surface opens new ways for catalyst preparation. Thus, the basic nature of MgAl-LDH makes it possible to decrease acidity of the support to a required degree; the presence of a phase with anion exchange properties allows introducing not only various anions but also metals in anionic species.
