1. Introduction
Being the second most important olefin after ethylene, propene is currently produced through steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of various oil fractions as a byproduct [[1], [2], [3]]. These technologies cannot, however, fulfil continuously growing demand for this olefin. Therefore, on-purpose propene production technologies such as metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes, methanol to propene and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene (PDH) have been developed [[3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]]. Among these processes, PDH exhibits great potential because of the development of shale gas industry [3].
Al2O3-supported CrOx-containing catalysts are used on the large scale and contain between 10 and 20 wt.% of Cr2O3 and about 2 wt.% of potassium as a promoter [3]. SiO2, SiO2-Al2O3, SiO2-ZrO2, or ZrO2 were also applied as supports as they affect the distribution of CrOx, overall catalysts acidity and, consequently, catalyst performance [1,[9], [10], [11], [12], [13]]. ZrO2 can also be used as a promoter to enhance the dispersion of CrOx species and therefore to increase propene formation [1,11,12,14,15]. Recently, bulk binary CrZrOx oxides were demonstrated to reveal significantly higher activity in comparison with a commercial analogue of K-Cr2O3/Al2O3 [16,17]. CrOx species in CrZrOx were suggested to promote in-situ removal of lattice oxygen from ZrO2. As a consequence, the number of lattice oxygen around Zr4+ cation decreases. Such cations are called coordinatively unsaturated Zr4+ sites (Zrcus). According to our recent theoretical calculations, two of them form the active site responsible for propane dehydrogenation over bulk tetragonal or monoclinic ZrO2 [18,19]. Bulk ZrO2-based catalysts without CrOx are also active for alkane dehydrogenation when they were stabilized in either monoclinic or tetragonal phase [[20], [21], [22]]. Although their activity increased with a decrease in the size of crystallites down to 4 nm, X-ray amorphous bulk ZrO2 showed low activity [18,19]. ZrO2(5 wt%)/SiO2 or ZrO2(5 wt%)/AlSiOx were also not active [20]. These previous results strongly suggest that the phase composition and the size of ZrO2 crystallites are activity-governing parameters for bulk catalysts. However, no such information is available for catalysts possessing supported ZrO2-based species. From an application viewpoint, the latter materials are advantageous in comparison with their bulk counterparts due to high costs for ZrO2.
The main purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of ZrO2 crystallinity and CrOx distribution in SiO2-supported CrZrOx catalysts with same Cr loading on their activity, selectivity, on-stream stability and coking behavior in propane dehydrogenation. To this end, XRD analysis, N2 adsorption/desorption, NH3-TPD, H2-TPR, in-situ UV–vis, Raman and EPR spectroscopic tests were carried out. Time-resolved operando UV–vis tests were instrumental for deriving kinetic insights into coke formation. Catalytic tests were performed with the purpose to determine the rate of propene formation, product selectivity and catalyst durability under industrially relevant conditions with alternating dehydrogenation/oxidative regeneration cycles.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Supported CrZrOx catalysts were prepared by a simple impregnation method. 2 g of Cr(NO3)3·9H2O (99 %, Sigma-Aldrich) and 14.91 g of ZrO(NO3)2∙xH2O (99 %, Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in ethanol (absolute, Merck) to achieve a solution with a total metal cation concentration of 0.5 M. 2 g of SiO2 (Davisil Grade 643, Sigma-Aldrich, 302 m2 g−1) were added to a certain amount of the solution and heated to evaporate ethanol at about 65 °C under continuous stirring until a slurry was formed. The slurry was dried at room temperature overnight and then at 100 °C for 6 h. Hereafter, it was calcined at 450, 500, 550, 600, or 650 °C under static air for 4 h (ramp was 3 K·min-1). The loading of CrZrOx with a molar ratio Cr/(Cr + Zr) of 0.1 was 30 wt%. The catalysts were defined as S-CrZr_450, S-CrZr_500, S-CrZr_550, S-CrZr_600 and S-CrZr_650, respectively with the number standing for the temperature at which the catalyst was calcined. ZrO2/SiO2 and CrOx/SiO2 were prepared according to the above mentioned method and calcined in static air at 550 °C for 4 h (ramp was 3 K·min-1). The loading of ZrO2 or CrOx by 30 or 2 wt%.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
N2 adsorption-desorption isotherm measurements were carried on the ASAP 2020 setup (Micromeritics, USA) at −196 °C. Before testing, the samples were pretreated at 250 °C for 2 h under vacuum to remove the adsorbed water.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Theta/Theta diffractometer X’Pert Pro (Panalytical, Almelo, Netherlands) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) in a 2θ range of 5-80°.
Ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) experiments were performed in an in house-developed setup equipped with eight individually heated continuous-flow fixed-bed reactors. Catalyst amount was fixed to 50 mg. Before NH3 adsorption, all the catalysts were heated in Ar flow to 550 °C with a heating rate of 10 K·min−1, calcined in air flow at 550 °C for 1 h and then reduced by a flow of 50 vol% H2 in Ar for 1 h. After cooling down to 120 °C and purging with Ar, the catalysts were exposed to a flow of 1 vol% NH3 in Ar (total flow 10 mL·min−1) for 1 h. Hereafter, they were purged with Ar for 4 h to remove physically bonded NH3, cooled down to 80 °C, and finally heated to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 K·min−1. Signals of Ar (atomic mass unit of 40) and NH (atomic mass unit of 15) were recorded by an online mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320).
Temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) experiments were carried out in the same equipment used for the NH3-TPD tests. Catalyst amount for each reactor was 200 mg. Firstly, all catalysts were heated in Ar to 550 °C with a heating rate of 10 K·min−1, calcined in air flow at 550 °C for 1 h and cooled down in the same flow to room temperature. After purging with Ar for 15 min, the catalysts were exposed to a flow of 5 vol% H2 in Ar (total flow 10 mL·min−1) and heated up to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 K·min−1. Signals of Ar (atomic mass unit of 40) and H2 (atomic mass unit of 2) were detected by an online mass spectrometer.
UV-vis spectra of oxidized and reduced catalysts were collected using an Avantes spectrometer equipped with a deuterium-halogen light source and a CCD array detector and a temperature-resistant reflection UV–vis probe, which contains six radiating optical fibers and one reading fiber. BaSO4 was used as the white reference. The samples were placed into the quartz reactors, heated in N2 flow up to 550 °C, calcined in air flow at 550 °C for 1 h (for oxidized samples). Hereafter, Kubelka-Munk function F(R) was obtained from reflectance (R) according to Eq. (1). In case of reduced samples, the initially oxidized catalysts were purged with N2 flow and then reduced in a flow of 50 vol% H2 in N2 for 1 h at 550 °C. Hereafter, UV-vis spectra were collected. Kubelka-Munk function F(R) was obtained from reflectance (R) according to Eq. (1).

Operando UV–vis spectra were collected using the same setup. During the test, the samples were treated in a flow of air for 1 h, purged with N2 and then reduced in a flow of 50 vol% H2 in N2 for 1 h at 550 °C. Hereafter, the catalysts were exposed to a mixture of 40 vol% C3H8 in N2. Catalyst amount was between 80 and 150 mg while the feed flow was set to 40 mL·min−1 to achieve a C3H8 conversion of about 10 %. For the monitoring of coke formation, relative reflectance (Rrel) defined as the ratio of the reflectance of carbon deposited catalyst (RDH) to that of reduced one (RH2) was calculated according to Eq. (2). Relative F(R) function was calculated from the above relative reflectance according to Eq. (3).

Raman spectra were collected on a Renishaw in Via Raman microscope using a 633 nm laser with a laser power of 16.1 mW. The samples were mounted onto object slides and an objective with a magnification of 50× was applied.
EPR spectra were recorded at 20 °C on a Bruker cw ELEXSYS 500-10/12 spectrometer (X-band, ν ≈ 9.7 GHz) with a microwave power of 6.3 mW, a modulation frequency of 100 kHz and modulation amplitude of 5 G. EPR tubes were filled with ≈ 30 mg of the individual catalyst. Before collecting EPR spectra, all samples were reduced with a flow of 50 vol% H2 in N2 for 1 h at 550 °C and cooled down in N2 to room temperature.
Temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) tests with spent catalysts were employed to quantify the amount of coke formed within 1 h on propane stream at 550 °C. Catalyst amount was 30 mg. Prior to the TPO analysis, the catalysts were heated in N2 flow up to 550 °C, calcined in air at the same temperature for 1 h, reduced in 50 vol% H2 in N2 for 1 h and exposed to a mixture of 40 vol% C3H8 in N2 for 1 h. Hereafter, the catalysts were cooled down in N2 flow to room temperature, transferred into TPO reactors and purged with Ar for 15 min. A mixture of 5 vol% O2 in Ar was fed to the reactors with a flow rate of 10 mL·min−1. After 80 min, the samples were heated to 900 °C from room temperature with a heating rate of 10 K·min−1. Signals of Ar (atomic mass unit of 40) and CO2 (atomic mass unit of 44) were recorded by an online mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320).
2.3. Catalytic test
Catalytic tests were carried out at 550 °C and ambient pressure in an in-house developed setup equipped with 15 continuous-flow quartz tubular (di = 4 mm) fixed-bed reactors. Prior to the tests, the catalysts were initially heated in N2 flow up to 550 °C followed by feeding air at the same temperature for 1 h and then reduced in a flow of 50 vol% H2 in N2 for 1 h. The rate of propene formation (r(C3H6) in mmol·g−1 min−1) was determined using 50 mg catalyst (particle size of 315−710 μm) and a total feed (40 vol% C3H8 in N2) flow of 40 mL·min−1. Under such conditions, the degree of propane conversion was below 10 % to assure differential reactor operation. r(C3H6) was calculated according to Eq. (4), where
ṅ
and mcat stand for molar flow of C3H6 (mmol·min−1) and catalyst amount (g), respectively. Eq. (5) was used to calculate the Cr- and Zrcus-related TOF values. n(Cr3+) or n(Zrcus) are the number of Cr3+ or Zrcus sites (mmol·g−1). They were determined from the amount of H2 consumed by CrOx (n(H2)CrOx) or ZrO2 (n(H2)ZrO2) according to the H2-TPR profiles. The stoichiometry of Cr6+ reduction to Cr3+ by H2 was taken into account, i.e. 3/2 H2 is consumed by one Cr6+ to yield one Cr3+. n(Zrcus) is equal to n(H2)ZrO2 as two Zrcus sites are required for propane dehydrogenation [18,19].

A long-term stability test was performed at 550 °C with a C3H8-N2 mixture (40 vol.% C3H8). The reaction products and feed components were analyzed every 4 min. To achieve an initial C3H8 conversion of 20 %, the flow of C3H8/N2 was set to 12 mL·min−1 and catalyst amount was varied from 70 to 150 mg. The WHSV values with respect to propane were 3.45, 5.18, 6.91, 7.40 and 7.40 h−1 for S-CrZr_450, S-CrZr_500, S-CrZr_550, S-CrZr_600 and S-CrZr_650, respectively. Each PDH cycle lasted for 30 min. Hereafter, the catalysts were regenerated in air flow (10 mL·min−1) for 30 min and then reduced in a flow (10 mL·min−1) of hydrogen (50 vol% H2 in N2) for 30 min. All stages including PDH, oxidative regeneration and reduction were separated by purging stage with N2. 10 PDH/oxidative regeneration cycles were performed for each catalyst.
Propane conversion and product selectivity were calculated according to Eqs. (6) and (7), respectively. ṅ (mmol·min−1) with superscripts “in” or “out” represents the molar flow of gas phase components at the reactor inlet and outlet, β stands for the number of carbon atoms in product i or propane. Space time yield of propene (STY in kgC3H6·kgcat−1 h−1) is defined in Eq. (8), where
is the molecular weight of C3H6. The components of reaction feed and the reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890) equipped with flame ionization (FID) and thermal conductivity (TCD) detectors.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
3.1.1. Textural properties
The specific surface area (SBET) of the catalysts was determined according to the BET method. The adsorption-desorption isotherms including the pore-size distribution and the corresponding SBET values are shown in Figure S1 and in Table 1 respectively. It should be noted that SBET of SiO2 decreased at least by 19 % after deposition of CrZrOx, which means that pores of the support were partially blocked by CrZrOx (SBET of bare SiO2 is given in section “2.1 Catalyst Preparation”). In addition, the SBET values decreased with an increase in catalyst calcination temperature.

[a] Relative crystallinity of ZrO2. Overall sample crystallinity was calculated from XRD (Figure S2) and related to the crystallinity of S-CrZr_650. As SiO2 is amorphous the obtained crystallinity data are related to ZrO2.
Phase composition of the catalysts and the degree of crystallinity of ZrO2 were determined by XRD analysis. The XRD patterns of the samples are shown in Fig. 1. According to these data, all catalysts possess tetragonal phase of ZrO2 (t-ZrO2) with the typical reflections at 2θ of 30.2, 35.0, 50.3, 60.0° (PDF 01-73-1441). Thus, Cr should be incorporated into the lattice of ZrO2, otherwise this oxide would exist in the monoclinic phase [23]. No obvious shift of the XRD reflections of the ZrO2 phase could be found thus indicating that the cell parameters of ZrO2 are similar to each other. The broad reflection at around 2θ of 23° could be ascribed to the amorphous SiO2 support. No reflections characteristic of crystalline Cr2O3 were detected. This is an indication for high dispersion of CrOx in the catalysts. With increasing calcination temperature, the reflections related to t-ZrO2 narrowed. This is an indication for an increase in the size of ZrO2 crystallites. The crystallinity of ZrO2 was also established to increase with increasing catalyst calcination temperature (see Table 1).

3.1.2. Acidic and redox properties
It is generally accepted that the acidity of dehydrogenation metal oxide catalysts has a significant effect on their performance in PDH [[24], [25], [26]]. However, no direct correlation between the acidity and catalyst activity was established in our recent study of the PDH reaction over bare bulk ZrO2 [27]. Thus, it was important to check if the acidity of the CrZrOx/SiO2 catalysts plays a role in this reaction. Acidic properties of our samples were determined by means of NH3-TPD tests. The obtained NH3-TPD profiles are shown in Figure S3a in the Supporting Information. They are characterized by a broad asymmetric peak between 180 °C and 550 °C that indicates the existence of acidic sites of different strength. Using Gaussian functions, the profiles could be deconvoluted into three peaks related to the weak, medium and strong acidic sites and their corresponding Tmax were around 240 °C, 290 °C and 385 °C, respectively. It should be noted that the position of each peak is not influenced by the temperature at which the sample was calcined (Figure S3b). Thus, the strength of acidic sites is not affected by the treatment. Noticeably, while the fraction of weak acidic sites does not change with calcination temperature, the fraction of medium acidic sites decreases and that of strong acidic sites slightly increases (Figure S3c). An overall surface acidic density was calculated by assuming that one NH3 molecule is bonded on one acidic site. The total acidic density decreases with increasing the calcination temperature (Table 1). As CrZrOx possesses acidic sites but not SiO2, the decrease in the density should be related to a decrease in the dispersion of CrZrOx species as a consequence of their crystallization caused by thermal treatment.
The reducibility of the samples was investigated by H2-TPR. The corresponding profiles and the amounts of consumed H2 are shown in Fig. 2(a), Figure S4 and in Table 1 respectively. All H2-TPR profiles are characterized by an intensive H2 consumption peak with the maximum (Tmax-H2) in a range of 345–380 °C (Table 1). Importantly, the reduction of dispersed CrOx in CrZrOx species seems to proceed easier in comparison with the reduction of CrOx/SiO2 (Figure S4). The amount of H2 consumed by the latter catalyst was 213 μmol H2 g−1 versus about 350 μmol H2 g−1 for CrZrOx/SiO2 possessing same amount of chromium as in CrOx/SiO2.

Fig. 2. Effect of calcination temperature on H2 consumption by CrOx and ZrO2 in supported CrZrOx.
As all the samples were treated in air at 550 °C, we assume that chromium should be stabilized in its highest oxidation state. Thus, the first reduction peak in CrZrOx/SiO2 was ascribed to the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+. Besides the peak related to the transformation of Cr6+ into Cr3+, a small high-temperature consumption of H2 with the maximum at around 490 °C can be seen in the H2-TPR profiles (Figure S4). It can be ascribed to the removal of lattice oxygen from ZrO2. The lower reduction temperature of ZrO2 in CrZrOx/SiO2 in comparison with ZrO2/SiO2 (490 °C vs. 609 °C in Fig. 2(a)) and the higher amount of H2 consumed (70 μmol H2 g−1 vs. 15.9 μmol H2·g−1) could be due to the promoting effect of Cr3+ formed during H2-TPR process to activate/dissociate H2 [28]. The total amount of H2 consumed during TPR experiment slightly decreased with increasing calcination temperature from 450 °C to 550 °C and increased after increasing the calcination temperature from 550 °C to 650 °C (Table 1).
To have a deeper insight into the reducibility of supported CrZrOx, the amount of H2 consumed through removal of lattice oxygen from CrOx or ZrO2 was calculated according to Gaussian fittings (Fig. 2(a) and Figure S4) of the H2-TPR profiles. These two amounts are shown in Fig. 2(b). It is obvious that the amount of H2 consumed by CrOx decreases with increasing calcination temperature. In comparison with the negative effect of calcination temperature on CrOx reducibility, this catalyst property of ZrO2 is improved with rising calcination temperature of CrZrOx/SiO2. This result indicates that the crystallinity of ZrO2 plays an important role for its reducibility, which is consistent with our previous study used bare ZrO2. Amorphous ZrO2 was established to be hardly reduced, while the reducibility of crystalline ZrO2 decreased with an increase in the size of crystallites [18,29].
3.1.3. Characterization of CrOx species
UV-vis spectroscopy was applied to shed light upon the kind of CrOx species in differently calcined CrZrOx/SiO2. The UV–vis spectra of the oxidized samples are shown in Fig. 3. The observed bands at 270 and 400 nm can be assigned to the O→Cr6+ charge transfer transitions in tetrahedrally coordinated monochromates ((CrO4)−2), the red shift of the latter could be ascribed to the effect of high temperature [30]. The band between 400–550 nm is related to the d-d transitions of Cr6+ in polychromates [11]. The presence of Cr2O3 clusters could not, however, be excluded to contribute to the absorption in this region [31]. For all samples, there is no band ascribed to crystalline Cr2O3, which is in agreement with our XRD data.

To check if and how CrOx species transform upon reductive catalyst treatment we also collected the spectra after H2 treatment at 550 °C for 1 h (Figure S5). For the sample calcined at 450 °C, the band ascribed to polychromates has almost vanished after reduction, but for the sample calcined at 650 °C, it still exists, which means that a part of Cr6+ was not reduced or small XRD-amorphous Cr2O3 clusters are present. Such difference in the reductive behavior of the samples can be due to the different crystallinity of ZrO2. Most of CrOx seem to be located on the surface in poorly crystalline CrZrOx, while a part of CrOx is incorporated into the lattice of ZrO2 with rising crystallinity degree. This is also consistent with the above discussed H2-TPR results. The amount of H2 consumed by CrOx species decreased with increasing catalyst calcination temperature.
To get a deep insight into the molecular structure of CrOx species Raman analysis was applied. The obtained spectra are shown in Fig. 4. The spectrum of S-CrZr_450 is characterized by a band centered at around 867 cm−1 which can be attributed to isolated monochromate species [32]. However, for the samples calcined at higher temperature, this band splits into two bands located at 843 and 880 cm−1 which were previously assigned to symmetrical OCrO and bridging CrOCr vibrations of polychromates, respectively [32,33]. It can be assumed that polychromates are formed from monochromate species during calcination at high temperature. Bands located at 980 cm−1 and 1027 cm−1 were observed for all samples and could be ascribed to the symmetric stretching of terminal CrO of monochromate species [34,35]. Band at 1005 cm−1 is assigned to the symmetric stretching of terminal CrO in polychromates. For all samples, no band assigned to crystalline Cr2O3 (545 cm−1) can be observed [36], which additionally confirms that CrOx is highly dispersed in our catalysts. Accordingly, both monochromate and polychromate species are present in all catalysts, but the fraction of each species depends on catalyst calcination temperature.

EPR spectroscopy was also used for characterizing reduced CrOx species. To create EPR-active Cr3+ species, all samples were initially reduced in a H2-containing (50 vol% H2 in N2) flow at 550 °C for 1 h. Fig. 5 shows the EPR spectra of reduced CrZrOx/SiO2. The presence of a narrow signal with a g factor of around 1.975 indicates that the major part of Cr species exists as isolated Cr3+ species in all catalysts [37]. Besides isolated species, a small amount of CrOx clusters is also present in S-CrZr_450 as concluded from the presence of a broad symmetric signal with a g-factor of around 1.97 [38]. Their concentration increases with rising calcination temperature. Such clusters are probably formed after reduction of polychromates.

3.2. Catalyst performance
All our samples were tested in the PDH reaction at 550 °C. The rate of propene formation as a function of catalyst calcination temperature is shown in Fig. 6(a). It increased from 0.47 to 1.2 mmol·g−1 min−1 with an increase in the calcination temperature from 450 °C to 650 °C. The present CrZrOx/SiO2 materials are less active than bulk CrZrOx, e.g. the rate of propene formation over S-CrZr_650 is 1.2 mmol·g−1 min−1, while that over bulk binary Cr10Zr90Ox is 3.1 mmol·g−1 min−1. However, the former catalyst contains about 2.3 times lower amounts of Cr and Zr accordingly. Importantly, the rate of propene formation over ZrO2/SiO2 (0.05 mmol·g−1 min−1) and CrOx/SiO2 (0.13 mmol·g−1 min−1) was significantly lower than that over CrZrOx/SiO2 with similar loadings of ZrO2.

Fig. 6. Effects of (a) catalyst calcination temperature on the rate of propene formation and (b) crystallinity of ZrO2 on the rate of propene formation (left Y axis) or on the Zrcus and Cr3+-related TOF (right Y axis). Cr3+-related TOF at ZrO2 crystallinity of 0 % is for CrOx/SiO2. Reaction conditions: T = 550 °C, C3H8:Ar = 2:3, Flow rate=40 mL·min−1, WHSV = 37.7 h−1.
When we relate the rate with the crystallinity of ZrO2 in CrZrOx as obtained from XRD data (Fig. 1), an obvious correlation can be established (Fig. 6(b)). The higher the crystallinity, the higher the rate is. From our previous works with bare ZrO2 existing in either monoclinic or tetragonal phase [18,19], it is known that the size of ZrO2 crystallites has a significant effect on the activity, which increases with a decrease in the size, while amorphous ZrO2 shows very low activity. On the basis of this previous knowledge and the relationship in Fig. 6(b), we suggest that crystallinity of ZrO2 governs the activity of CrZrOx/SiO2. A direct correlation with the size of crystallites cannot be established, as the catalysts additionally differ in the degree of crystallinity. As reported in Ref. [18,19] for bulk ZrO2 and seen in Fig. 6(b) for S-CrZr_450, amorphous ZrO2 shows low activity for the PDH reaction.
To further check if Cr3+ or Zrcus sites are involved in the PDH reaction we calculated Cr3+- or Zrcus-related TOF values using the amount of Cr3+ and Zrcus calculated from H2 consumed by CrOx or ZrO2 in H2-TPR tests (Fig. 2). The latter values are shown in Fig. 6(b). One can see that the TOF value increases with an increase in the degree of ZrO2 crystallinity from 16 to 33 % and then does practically not depend on the crystallinity when the latter increases up to 100 %. Importantly the Cr3+-related TOF value increases with ZrO2 crystallinity (Fig. 6(b)). In our previous study with bulk binary CrZrOx [16,17], we have established that the Cr3+-related TOF value decreased with rising chromium content. Taking these previous results and the data from Fig. 6(b) into account, Zrcus sites are suggested to be mainly responsible for propane dehydrogenation. Thus, a certain degree of order in the lattice of ZrO2 is required to achieve high activity for propene formation.
Durability of the catalysts was checked in a series of 10 PDH/oxidative regeneration cycles performed at 550 °C. Fig. 7(a) shows the initial conversion of propane in each cycle and the corresponding propene selectivity values. Due to the different activity of the catalysts, different WHSV were used to maintain the initial C3H8 conversion degree of about 20 %. All catalysts demonstrated good durability. Propane conversion changed slightly from cycle to cycle. The initial selectivity to C3H6 for different samples was determined to be around 92 % and did not significantly change from cycle to cycle (Fig. 7(a)). Cracking products (CH4, C2H4 and C2H6) and coke were the main byproducts produced during the reaction. Time on-stream profiles of space time yield (STY) of propene for each catalyst in each catalytic cycle are shown in Figure S6 (see the Supporting Information). These profiles were integrated over time to obtain the amount of C3H6 produced per kg of each catalyst in each cycle (Fig. 7(b)). With increasing calcination temperature from 450 °C to 600 °C, the amount of C3H6 produced in each cycle increased significantly. This value did not significantly change from cycle to cycle.

(b) The amount of C3H6 produced over 1 kg of each catalyst in each catalytic cycle. Reaction conditions: T = 550 °C, C3H8:N2 = 2:3, flow rate = 12 mL·min−1, WHSV = 3.77, 5.66, 7.54, 8.08 and 8.08 h−1 for S-CrZr_450, S-CrZr_500, S-CrZr_550, S-CrZr_600 and S-CrZr_650 respectively. PDH stage in each cycle lasted for 30 min.
3.3. Coke formation and oxidation
To check if the amount of carbon deposits, their kind and kinetics of formation are also influenced by catalyst calcination temperature, we carried out temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) of spent catalysts and operando UV–vis analysis. We start with the discussion of the former tests. Prior to these experiments, the reduced catalysts were exposed at 550 °C to a mixture of 40 vol% C3H8 in N2 for 60 min. Temporal changes of propane conversion for each catalyst are shown in Figure S7. The initial conversion was in the range from 19 to 24 % and decreased with time on stream to 9–13 %. After completing the PDH run, the catalysts were cooled down in N2 and then loaded into other reactors for TPO tests. Before starting the TPO program, the reactors with catalysts were flushed with Ar for about 15 min. Hereafter, a flow of 5 vol% O2 in Ar was fed to the reactors and, after 80 min, the reactors were heated up to 900 °C with a ramp of 10 K·min−1. The TPO profiles in the form of CO2/Ar MS signal are shown in Fig. 8(a). For all catalysts, Tmax-CO2 values (temperature of maximal CO2 production) are located at around 350 °C. No significant difference in Tmax-CO2 between the samples can be observed. It should be also noted that coke deposits can be removed under relatively mild conditions, i.e. below 550 °C where the PDH reaction takes place. Thus, it will be possible to run the desired reaction and to regenerate the catalysts at the same temperature.

Fig. 8. a) TPO profiles of used catalysts after 1 h on-stream test and (b) the ratio of coke amount to the amount of converted C3H8 over CrZrOx calcined at different temperature.
To take into account the fact that the catalysts differed in the initial propane conversion and deactivated with different rates, we calculated the ratio of the amount of coke determined from TPO profiles to the amount of converted C3H8 (Fig. 8(b)). Such value can be considered as an integral mass-based selectivity to coke. According to the data obtained, the catalysts do not differ strongly although they revealed different activity for propene formation (Fig. 6(a)). Such apparent contradiction can be explained by the fact that the rate of coke formation increases with increasing ZrO2 crystallinity in the same extent as the rate of propene formation. To check this assumption, we carried out operando UV–vis tests.
The operando UV–vis spectra were collected during PDH reaction. It is worth mentioning that the initial propane conversion was in the same range for all catalysts, i.e. about 10 %. The individual values and the selectivity to propene are shown in Figure S8 as a function of time on stream. The obtained UV–vis spectra (relative Kubelka-Munk function (F(Rrel))) after different times on propane stream are shown for selected catalysts in Fig. 9(a)-(c). For all catalysts tested, a continuous increase in F(Rrel) occurred through the whole range of wavelengths. Tentatively, three absorption bands with maxima at around 420 nm, 600 nm and 800−900 nm can be identified in the spectra. To check if the bands belong to the same kind of carbon-containing species, we analyzed temporal profiles of the ratio of one band to another. If the bands were due to the absorption of one species, there would be no changes in the ratio in rising time on propane stream. As seen in Fig. 9(d)-(f), all ratios strongly change at the beginning of the experiment and then may approach a constant value depending on the catalyst. Such temporal behavior of the intensity of different absorption bands suggests that there are different kinds of coke species. On the basis of a previous study of Weckhuysen et al. [39], the bands with maxima at 600 nm and 800−900 nm can be ascribed to polyaromatic species, while the band with the maximum at 420 nm stems from low-condensed aromatic species.

For deriving an insight into the effect of catalyst calcination temperature on the kinetics of coke formation, temporal evolution of F(Rrel) upon non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation is shown in Fig. 10. The F(Rrel) profiles were normalized by their highest values achieved at the end of the test. Such normalization is required for an easier comparison of the slope of the profiles as their absolute intensity is not a direct measure of the amount of coke formed. Regardless of the kind of coke species, the catalysts can be ordered according to the rate (slope of the F(Rrel)-time dependence in Fig. 10) of reaction-induced changes in F(Rrel) at 420, 600 or 800 nm as follows: S-CrZr_650> S-CrZr_550> S-CrZr_450. It is also worth mentioning that the F(Rrel) profiles are characterized by an induction period, i.e. no significant changes within the first few minutes on propane stream. Such behavior can be explained by the fact that some small coke seeds should be formed initially. Once such seeds achieved a certain amount, the F(Rrel) samples increases rapidly indicating formation of large coke species. When analyzing the effect of catalyst calcination temperature on the duration of the induction period it becomes obvious that the higher the temperature, the lower the duration is. In summary, we can conclude that the crystallization degree affects the rate of coke formation but not the kind of coke species.

4. Conclusions
In this study, the degree of crystallinity of ZrO2 in SiO2-supported CrZrOx species was proven to be a decisive factor affecting catalyst activity in the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. This structural material property can be tuned through calcination treatment favoring higher degree of crystallization with rising calcination temperature. Overall catalyst activity was determined to strongly increase with the degree of crystallinity although the concentration of Cr sites was constant. Operando UV–vis spectroscopy revealed that (i) coke formation is the main reason for catalyst deactivation and (ii) ZrO2 crystallinity affects both the rate of propene and coke formation to the same extent. Thus, the degree of crystallinity affects the concentration of sites responsible for the formation of these two products.
