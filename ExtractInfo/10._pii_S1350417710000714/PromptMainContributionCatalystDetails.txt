AbstractAbstract
Effects of ultrasonic irradiation on the catalytic performance of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation were studied. XRD, TEM and TPDA were used to characterize the catalysts. From the results of XRD, the structure of ZSM-5 was not destroyed by the ultrasound. Ultrasound promoted the dispersion of Pt on the surface of the carrier during impregnation and decreased the size of Pt particles. Compared with the catalyst prepared by conventional impregnation, the supported catalyst prepared by ultrasonic irradiation showed better catalytic activity in propane dehydrogenation.
1. Introduction
The catalytic dehydrogenation of propane is of great interest due to the growing demand of propene as a basic petrochemical feedstock. Bimetallic Pt–Sn catalyst supported on alumina has been studied extensively as a dehydrogenation catalyst [1], [2], [3], [4]. However, the PtSn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst is easy to deactivate under severe reaction conditions [5]. Consequently, there has been renewed interest in the application of the new carriers (especially zeolites) in recent years.
ZSM-5 zeolite contains a wide range of Si/Al ratios to change its acidity and a special three-dimensional channel. The particular channel can hinder the formation of large hydrocarbon molecules, thus preventing so-called coke deposition and improving the catalytic stability. At present, ZSM-5 is widely investigated in aromatization, catalytic cracking and isomerization [6], [7], [8]. It was found in our previous works that the ZSM-5 catalysts containing Pt, Sn and Na indicated good catalytic performance in the propane dehydrogenation reaction [9], [10], [11].
The common preparation method for the supported catalyst involves impregnation of the metal onto the support. This is a simple method that allows for easy dispersion of the active component onto the surface of the support. In principle, the number of catalytic active sites increases as the dispersion of the active phase increases. Recently, the application of ultrasound for investigating different chemical reactions and catalyst synthesis is of interest by various researchers [12], [13]. Ultrasound can enhance and promote dispersion of the active metal on the carrier, thus improving the catalytic performance of the catalyst. The application of ultrasound in the preparation of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst has not been previously studied.
Two catalysts have been prepared, using conventional impregnation and ultrasound-enhanced impregnation, respectively. The aim of this work involved the synthesis of Pt, Sn and Na-modified ZSM-5 zeolite catalysts by different impregnation methods. Their physico-chemical and catalytic properties were also investigated, in order to determine an optimum method to prepare PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst.
2. Experimental details
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The trimetallic catalysts were prepared by sequential impregnation. First, the powder HZSM-5 was impregnated in an aqueous solution of 0.427 M NaCl, and then was dried. The Na/ZSM-5 powder was then impregnated in a solution containing 0.033 M H2PtCl6 and 0.153 M SnCl4. Ultrasound was applied using a UP2200HE sonication bath (50 kHz, 100 W). The irradiation with ultrasound lasted for 4 h at 80 °C, and then the mixture was dried. The sample was defined as CU. For comparison, a conventional impregnating catalyst was similarly prepared except that the ultrasonic irradiation was replaced by stirring of the CU catalyst in the impregnation of H2PtCl6 and SnCl4. The catalyst was defined as CS. The nominal composition of each sample was 0.5 wt% Pt, 1.0 wt% Sn, and 1.0 wt% Na.
All of samples were fully agglomerated with 5.0 wt% alumina during the process of agglomeration. After drying, the catalysts were calcinated at 500 °C for 5 h in airflow and reduced in flowing H2 at 500 °C for 8 h.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
X-ray powder diffraction measurements were carried out on a D/Max2200 X-ray powder diffractometer (Ricoh, Japan) using a Cu Kα radiation filter. An angular range 2θ from 5° to 40° was recorded using a 5° min−1 scanning rate.
The concentration of the acid sites was measured by temperature programmed desorption of ammonia (TPDA) using a conventional TPD apparatus. The experimental process was the same as reported by Liu et al. [10].
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were conducted using JEM-2010 (Japan) instruments after each treatment. The average particle size of the Pt particles was based on the size measurements of more than 100 particles in randomly chosen regions in the magnified TEM images.
2.3. Catalyst testing
The reaction of propane dehydrogenation to propene was studied in a conventional fixed-reactor at a constant temperature of 590 °C under atmospheric pressure. The catalyst loading was 1.5 g; WHSV was 3.0 h−1; H2:C3H8 molar ratio was 1:4. The reaction products were analyzed by an online GC9890A gas chromatographic.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of catalysts
The X-ray powder diffraction patterns of the different samples are given in Fig. 1. Two representative peaks at 7–8° and 23–24° are found in the XRD pattern of HZSM-5, which is consistent with the result of pure ZSM-5 reported by Kulkarni et al. [14]. The XRD patterns of all of the catalysts (CS and CU) are similar to that of the parent HZSM-5 zeolite. The results indicated that the parent structure of ZSM-5 zeolite is not influenced by the introduction of Pt, Sn and Na in ZSM-5 zeolite and not destroyed by ultrasound irradiation.

Table 1 shows the acidity data of different samples. Two NH3 desorption peaks at 241 and 445 °C are found on HZSM-5, which represent weak acid sites and strong acid sites on the surface of zeolite, respectively [15]. The lower-temperature desorption peak temperature of the CS and CU catalysts shifts to lower temperature and no high-temperature desorption peak is observed, showing that the strong acid centers on zeolite are preferentially neutralized by metals. In comparison with the CS catalyst, the peak temperature and total acidity of the CU catalyst change slightly, indicating that ultrasound used in the impregnation of Pt and Sn has no obvious effects on the acidic intensity of catalysts. Combined with our previous work [16], the acidity of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst is mainly due to the addition of Na. For all of catalysts, the procedure for introducing Na is the same in each preparation, thus resulting in similar acidity for the CS and CU catalysts.

CU 0.29 0.29 198 / /
CS 0.32 0.32 194 / /
For observing the dispersion of Pt metal on the surface of ZSM-5, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of different samples was carried out. The result is shown in Fig. 2. For the catalyst prepared by conventional impregnation (CS catalyst), the Pt particles are large (the average particle size is 6.4 nm) and most of them are agglomerated on the surface of ZSM-5 (Fig. 2a). Conversely, an improvement in the control of the Pt particle size and dispersion can be achieved using ultrasound in the impregnation. The average particle size is 2.8 nm. The effect may be attributed to the acoustic cavitation phenomenon. Cavitation serves as a means to concentrate the diffuse energy of ultrasound into a unique set of conditions to produce unusual materials [17]. Meanwhile, the collapse of the bubbles preferentially occurs near the solid surfaces [18] and can generate high-speed jets of liquid and shock waves with speeds that can reach an order of hundreds of meters per second. These microjets and shock waves will drive the formed clusters/nanoparticles in solution to the surface of the solid support and immobilize them before they are severely aggregated in solution [19]. The synergetic effect of ultrasound on the impregnation of Pt can avoid excess concentration within the solution and provide a uniform environment for the nucleation and growth of metal particles, simultaneously hindering the agglomeration of Pt particles on the zeolite surface [20].

3.2. Propane dehydrogenation for different catalysts
It is worth noting that the active metal and carrier for the CU and CS catalysts are the same: metal Pt and ZSM-5 zeolite. Generally, under the operating conditions studied, the following reactions can take place: propane dehydrogenation to propene, cracking reaction and hydrogenolysis of propane, ethene hydrogenation, and coke formation reactions, which are carried out on the surface of ZSM-5 and the Pt metal, respectively. The propane dehydrogenation and cracking on HMFI zeolite are carried out by a carbon cation mechanism; according to Guisnet et al. [21]. The propane dehydrogenation activity is a result of the common action by the active metal and ZSM-5 zeolite in the case of the PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst. As indicated in Table 1, the CS and CU catalysts show similar acidity; hence the propane dehydrogenation activity of catalysts is mainly determined by the dispersion of Pt metal on the surface of catalysts.
The conversion of propane and selectivity for the formation of propene between the CU and CS catalysts is given in Fig. 3, Fig. 4. The higher conversion of propane is observed over the catalyst prepared by ultrasonic irradiation. The reason for the behavior of the catalyst can be attributed to the application of ultrasound, which can reduce the size of Pt particle and improve the dispersion of Pt metal (as seen in Fig. 2), thus increasing the amounts of active centers in the catalyst and promoting the activity of the catalyst to propane dehydrogenation. The activity of the CU catalyst slowly decreases with time; the conversion of propane decreases 1.1% after 8 h. In contrast, the activity of the CS catalyst decreases 5.6% over the same time period. The results indicate that ultrasound can promote the stability of the catalyst. This may be due to the fact that the catalyst prepared by ultrasonic impregnation contains more active sites or that some of the Pt may be forced inside the pores of the support [12], [22]. This may prevent the active sites from being easily covered with increasing coke, improving the stability of catalyst.

Fig. 4. Propene selectivity versus time for the different catalysts.
The propene selectivity of the CU and CS catalysts increases with prolonged reaction time and tends to be stable. Compared with the CS catalyst, the propene selectivity of the CU catalyst is slightly lower. Fig. 5 shows the yield of side products for the different catalysts after reaction for 8 h. The yield of methane for the CU catalyst is similar to that of the CS catalyst, but a higher yield of ethane and ethene is obtained on the CU catalyst. In general, methane is generated by cracking on the surface of the carrier, and ethane is obtained by the hydrogenolysis of propane and the hydrogenation of ethene, which occur on the surface of Pt metal [23]. The acidity of the CU and CS catalysts are similar, leading to the close methane yield for two catalysts. The improvement of Pt dispersion on the surface of the CU catalyst not only accelerates the propane dehydrogenation to propene, but also promotes the hydrogenolysis of propane and the hydrogenation of ethane. Thus the yield of ethane increases and the selectivity of propene decreases.

4. Conclusion
The effects of ultrasound on the catalytic performance of PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst for propane dehydrogenation to propene were studied. The application of ultrasonic irradiation in the preparation of catalyst did not destroy the structure of ZSM-5 and hardly affected the acidity of catalysts. Sonication can reduce the size of Pt particles and improve the amounts of Pt metal dispersed on the surface of the catalyst. The PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst prepared by ultrasonic irradiation in the impregnation of Pt showed better catalytic activity and reaction stability. This suggests that ultrasonic irradiation is a superior method to prepare PtSnNa/ZSM-5 catalyst.
