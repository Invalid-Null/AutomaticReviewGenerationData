Effect of hydrogen and supported metal on selectivity and on-stream stability of ZrO2-based catalysts in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation




1. Introduction
Non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the methods for on-purpose production of propene widely used for manufacturing plastics, paints, solvents, etc. [1,2] Several licensed processes such as Catofin, Oleflex and Star are used in the industry to produce propene [3,4]. The Catofin process utilizes CrOx-based catalysts [[5], [6], [7]], while the latter two use Pt-based catalysts [1]. Despite the high activity, industrial catalysts have some disadvantages such as high price (Pt-based catalysts) or toxicity (CrOx-based catalysts). Recently we have developed ZrO2-based catalysts free of Pt or CrOx [[8], [9], [10], [11], [12]]. They demonstrate good performance in PDH as well as are relatively cheap and environmentally friendly. It was concluded that the catalytically active site of such catalysts consists of two coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus sites) located at a neighboring oxygen vacancy. Zrcus sites can be created upon reductive treatment of zirconia containing tiny amounts of hydrogenation-active metal (Ru, Rh, Cu, etc.) on its surface. The role of metal is to activate reducing agent (e.g. H2) and thus to provoke removal of lattice oxygen from the surface of ZrO2 leading to the creation of Zrcus sites. Promoting of ZrO2 with La2O3 or Y2O3 was also established to positively affect catalyst activity and propene selectivity due to enhancing the intrinsic activity of Zrcus sites and reducing the concentration of strong acidic sites, respectively [10].
Like many PDH catalysts, ZrO2-based materials also suffer from deactivation caused by the reaction-induced formation of carbon deposits. Although such deposits can be removed upon catalyst oxidative regeneration and the regenerated catalysts restore their initial performance, it would be advantageous from an applied viewpoint to enhance on-stream stability. It is well-known that the Oleflex process operates in the presence of hydrogen that helps to suppress coke formation [3,13,14]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies dealt with the PDH reaction over ZrO2-based catalyst in the presence of hydrogen.
Thus, the purpose of the current work was to close such gap. Specifically, we studied the effects of hydrogen on catalyst on-stream stability, productivity and the selectivity to propene and side products including coke. Based on our previous studies [8,9], we prepared a series of MZrOx (M = La or Y) catalysts with supported Cu or Ru species. Such materials demonstrated good catalytic activity and durability without co-feeding H2. Although, the supported metals are not the main dehydrogenation sites, it was important to elucidate if and how their presence and, particularly, their nature affect the above catalyst performance in the presence of hydrogen under industrially relevant conditions.
2. Experimental part
2.1. Catalyst synthesis
Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (99%, Acros), HNO3 (65%, Roth), CO(NH2)2 (>99%, Roth), RuCl3·nH2O (37.2 wt% Ru, Merck), LaZrOx (ZrO2 with 10 wt% La2O3, MelChemicals), and YZrOx (ZrO2 with 10 wt% Y2O3, NorPro) were used as initial substances. For the preparation of Cu-containing catalysts, the procedure described in Ref. [15] was applied. The required amount of copper nitrate was dissolved in deionized water to obtain a solution with Cu2+ concentration of about 0.01 mol·L−1. Hereafter, the solution was added to the suspension of 5 g of LaZrOx in 10 mL of water. The final mixture was heated up to 85 °C. An aqueous solution of urea (urea/Cu2+ molar ratio of 4/1) was added to the suspension dropwise under stirring. A little amount (5–10 drops) of HNO3 was added dropwise until pH of the mixture decreased to 2 followed by heating up to 90 °C and stirring for 18 h. The suspension was filtrated, washed with deionized water, dried at 110 °C overnight and calcined at 550 °C for 4 h. The nominal concentration of Cu in the sample was 0.05 wt%. The sample was denoted as 0.05Cu/LaZrOx.
Ru-containing catalysts were synthesized via incipient impregnation of LaZrOx or YZrOx with an aqueous solution of the ruthenium precursor. The impregnated materials were dried at 110 °C overnight and calcined at 550 °C for 4 h. The samples were denoted as 0.05Ru/LaZrOx, 0.005Ru/YZrOx and 0.05Ru/YZrOx with the numbers standing for the nominal weight percentage of Ru.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
Specific surface area (SBET) of the samples was determined by nitrogen physisorption experiments at −196 °C using a Belsorp mini II setup (Bel Japan). Adsorption isotherms were evaluated according to the BET method.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed on a Theta/Theta diffractometer X'Pert Pro (Panalytical) with CuKα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA) and an X'Celerator RTMS detector. Phase composition of the samples was identified using the program suite WinXPOW (Stoe & Cie) with inclusion of the powder diffraction file PDF2 of the international center for diffraction data.
Temperature-programmed reduction of the catalysts with H2 (H2-TPR) was carried out in an in-house developed setup containing eight individually heated continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactors. Prior to the experiment, 200 mg of each sample were heated in air (10 mL·min−1) to 550 °C for 1 h, cooled down to room temperature in the same flow and purged with Ar (10 mL·min−1) for 15 min. Hereafter, the catalysts were heated in a flow of 5 vol% H2 in Ar (10 mL·min−1) up to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 K·min−1. An on-line mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320) was used for measuring H2 and Ar with the latter being a reference standard.
The amount of carbon deposits formed within 270 min of PDH stream on the surface of 0.05Cu/LaZrOx was determined from the temperature-programmed oxidation experiments (TPO). The experiments were performed in the setup used for TPR. The catalyst was initially tested in the PDH reaction in the presence of different amounts of hydrogen. So generated spent materials were placed into TPO reactors, purged with an Ar flow (10 mL·min−1) for 15 min at room temperature and heated in a flow of 5 vol% O2 in Ar (10 mL·min−1) up to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 K·min−1. The release of CO2 was registered at AMU of 44 using an on-line mass spectrometer. Ar (AMU of 40) was used as a reference standard.
2.3. Catalytic tests
PDH tests were carried out in an in-house developed setup equipped with 15 continuous flow fixed-bed reactors operating at 1 bar. The catalysts were initially heated in N2 up to 550 or 600 °C followed by feeding air for 1 h and purging with N2 for 15 min. Hereafter, they were treated in a flow of 57 vol% H2 in N2 for 1 h, purged with N2 for 15 min and finally exposed to a reaction flow (40 vol% C3H8 and 0, 10 or 30 vol% H2 in N2). The duration of one PDH stage was 95 min (or 270 min for catalytic tests performed for TPO experiments). The tests at 550 °C with the feeds containing 0, 10, or 30 vol% H2 were performed at total flows of 10, 7, or 5 mL·min−1. The corresponding flows at 600 °C were 40, 20, or 20 mL·min−1.
Propane conversion, selectivity to propene, and space time yield of gas-phase products (STY) were calculated according to Eqs. (1), (2), (3).

Flame ionization (FID) and thermal conductivity (TCD) detectors were used for detection of hydrocarbons and other components, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalysts and their characterization
Specific surface area of bare LaZrOx, YZrOx and their Cu- or Ru-containing counterparts is listed in Table S1. The lower area of the latter materials might be due to sintering effects caused by high-temperature treatment. XRD patters of the supports and the catalysts contain reflexes related to the tetragonal and/or cubic ZrO2 phases (Fig. S1). The absence of the monoclinic phase can be explained by the stabilizing effect of the dopant (La2O3 and Y2O3) as described elsewhere [16]. No reflexes related to Cu- or Ru-containing phases were detected due to the high dispersion of these metals.
In H2-TPR tests, bare LaZrOx and YZrOx consumed hydrogen above 600 °C (Fig. S2). This process is shifted to lower temperatures when these materials possess supported Cu or Ru species. The temperature of the maximal hydrogen consumption rate and the amount of hydrogen consumed over all the samples are listed in Table S1. The Ru-containing samples are characterized by two peaks of H2 consumption. The low-temperature peak can be related to the removal of surface oxygen from ZrO2 provoked by hydrogen spillover from Ru. The high-temperature peak should be due to the removal of bulk lattice oxygen. The positive effect of supported metals on redox properties of ZrO2 is in a good agreement with previous studies [17,18].
3.2. Effect of H2 co-feeding on on-stream stability
All catalysts were tested in the PDH reaction at 550 and 600 °C using feeds containing 40 vol% of C3H8 and different amounts of H2 (0, 10, or 30 vol%) in N2. To achieve a similar initial degree of propane conversion (about 20–30%), we decreased the total flow upon increasing H2 concentration in the feed due to the negative effect of hydrogen on propane dehydrogenation. On-stream profiles of propane conversion and propene selectivity at 550 °C are shown in Fig. 1. The corresponding data for 600 °C are presented in Fig. S3. Operating with co-fed H2 obviously has a positive effect on the stability. For quantifying the positive hydrogen effect, we introduce a deactivation parameter (D) calculated according to Eq. (4).

N2 was balance in all cases.
Here Xinitial is the initial propane conversion (after 190 s on stream), Xfinal is the conversion after 95 min on stream.
The D values obtained for 550 °C and 600 °C are listed in Table 1. They are higher for 600 °C than for 550 °C due to the temperature-induced coke formation. For all temperatures, the D value decreased with increasing hydrogen content in the reaction feed. Such behavior can be explained when assuming that hydrogen suppresses formation of carbon-containing deposits. To check this hypothesis, we carried out TPO tests with spent 0.05Cu/LaZrOx catalyst tested for 270 min on PDH stream using the feed without H2 or with 10 or 30 vol% H2. On-stream profiles of propane conversion in these tests are shown in Fig. S4. The corresponding TPO profiles are given in Fig. S5. The amount of carbon deposits calculated from these profiles is 0.05, 0.04 and 0.02 gcarbon/gcatalyst for tests without co-fed H2 and with 10 or 30 vol% H2 respectively. Thus, we can conclude that coke formation is hindered in the presence of H2. According to our previous study [19], there are at least two types of Zr sites where propane/propene can be adsorbed and react. One type is mostly responsible for the formation of coke and propene, whereas another one participate in the selective propane dehydrogenation to propene. Thus, the suppressed formation of coke in the presence of H2 can be explained by hydrogenation of propene species adsorbed on the first type of Zr sites to yield gas-phase propane. This reaction results in a decrease in the steady-state coverage by the olefinic species participating in coke formation.

0.005Ru/YZrOx 27 13 0 94 82 57
0.05Ru/YZrOx 52 12 3 91 83 65
Although catalyst on-stream stability was improved in the presence of hydrogen, an important question to be answered if the amount of propene formed was also positively affected by hydrogen because the total flow was decreased with rising H2 content. With this respect, we calculated this amount formed over each catalyst within 95 min on propane stream at 550 and 600 °C. While co-fed H2 had a negative effect on the production of propene at 550 °C (Fig. 2 (a)), an opposite influence in most cases was determined for PDH at 600 °C (Fig. 2 (b)). This is due to strong catalyst deactivation at 600 °C when operating without co-fed H2 (Table 1). The negative effect of H2 at 550 °C can also be hindered through extension of the duration of PDH stage before catalyst regeneration as the rate of deactivation is strongly reduced in H2 presence. The data obtained within 270 min of PDH at 550 °C for 0.05Cu/LaZrOx are shown in Fig. S4 and Fig. 2 (a).

3.3. Effect of H2 co-feeding on selectivity to gas-phase products
As discussed in the preceding section, performing PDH with H2 hinders coke selectivity and thus improves catalyst on-stream stability. The present discussion is focused on the role of H2 and the kind of supported metal for other undesired reactions leading to C1-C2 (CH4, C2H4 and C2H6) hydrocarbons. Although the integral selectivity to coke decreased in the presence of H2, the initial (after 190 s on stream) selectivity to propene decreased over Ru-based catalysts but was practically unaffected over 0.05Cu/LaZrOx (Fig. 1). Moreover, the higher the Ru loading, the lower this selectivity is achieved, i.e. 50% vs. 80% obtained over 0.05Ru/LaZrOx or 0.05Ru/YZrOx and 0.005Ru/YZrOx respectively. The selectivity was improved with time on stream. What are the reasons behind this distinctive performance of Cu- or Ru-containing catalysts?
When analyzing the selectivity to all gas-phase reaction products, it becomes obvious that the low initial propene selectivity over the Ru-containing catalysts is due to high selectivity to C1-C2 hydrocarbons. H2-induced worsening the initial propene selectivity over Ru-containing catalysts should be related to accelerating methane and ethane formation rates (Fig. S6 (a), (b)). These reactions in the presence of hydrogen more likely occur through propane hydrogenolysis, since supported Ru species have a strong ability to catalyze such reaction [[20], [21], [22]]. It should also be noted that propene selectivity over Ru-containing catalysts slowly increased with time on DH stream. Such increase might be caused by blocking Ru sites by carbon deposits leading to suppressing hydrogenolysis reaction (Fig. S7 (a), (b)). In contrast to Ru-containing catalysts, co-fed H2 does not strongly influence the formation of methane and ethane over Cu-LaZrOx (Fig. S6 (a), (b)). This is due to the fact that copper hydrogenolysis activity is several orders of magnitude lower than that of ruthenium [23].
It should also be mentioned that the initial space time yield of ethylene STY(C2H4), the product of cracking of propane, does not depend on hydrogen content but is strongly influenced by the kind and content of supported metal (Fig. S6 (c)). The lowest STY(C2H4) value was achieved over 0.05Cu/LaZrOx, while 0.05Ru/YZrOx showed the highest activity. This undesired reaction can be hindered through the usage of LaZrOx for supported Ru species or decreasing its loading. It is also suppressed with time on propane stream (Fig. S7 (c)).
4. Conclusions
In this work, we have demonstrated that co-feeding hydrogen upon non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation over ZrO2-based catalysts with supported Cu or Ru species influences both on-stream stability and product selectivity. In general, performing PDH with hydrogen improves on-stream stability due to H2-induced removal of adsorbed propene intermediates of coke through their hydrogenation to propane. Despite such positive effect, the selectivity to propene over Ru-containing catalysts decreases with an increase in hydrogen concentration. Such effect was not observed for the Cu-containing catalyst. The negative effect of hydrogen is explained by the ability of Ru to catalyze undesired hydrogenolysis and cracking reactions. Cu was established to be significantly less active for these side reactions.
