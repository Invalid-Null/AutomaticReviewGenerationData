Promotion effect and mechanism of Ga modification on dimethyl ether carbonylation catalyzed by mordenite
Dimethyl ether (DME) carbonylation is an important reaction for methyl acetate (MA) and ethanol production from syngas. Mordenite (MOR) has been used as an industrial catalyst due to the competitive catalytic properties, especially with extremely high selectivity of MA (>99%). Given the Brønsted acid sites (BAS) in 8-MR are proved the active centers, the properties of BAS are crucial factors that influence the reaction. Until now, most of the researches focus on increasing the number of BAS rather than tuning the acid strength. Here we modified H-MOR by Ga introduction using incipient wetness impregnation. Catalyst evaluation results suggest that Ga species can enhance DME conversion with a maintained MA selectivity. Combining with characterizations and DFT calculation, the textural and acidic properties along with the existing form of Ga species are determined. Further in-situ IR, theoretical and kinetics investigations demonstrated that the enhanced acid strength accelerates the reaction on Ga-modified MOR catalysts. This work inspires us that improving the acid strength is an efficient strategy for Brønsted acid-catalyzed reaction, such as DME carbonylation.
1. Introduction
With the global energy crisis and environmental issues sweeping across the world, the vigorous application of alcohol fuel has been promoted. Ethanol derived from alternative resources such as syngas, biomass, industrial exhaust etc. has attracted much attention. Among them, one of the most promising routes from syngas are roughly carried out by three steps: production of dimethyl ether (DME), carbonylation of DME to generate methyl acetate (MA) and then MA hydrogenation.[1], [2]. This approach has such advantages as high selectivity, superior atom economy and low energy consumption of separation.
DME carbonylation is a critical step for this new technology. Mordenite (MOR) has shown an excellent catalytic capability at a relative low temperature.[3] Moreover, the unique topological structure of MOR, which contains two parallel channels, namely, eight-membered ring (8-MR) and twelve-membered ring (12-MR) main channels, intersected by 8-MR side pockets. The latter shows a steric confinement effect for MA formation. Given the Brønsted acid sites (BAS) in 8-MR have been generally accepted as the catalytic centers, [4], [5] it is crucial to improve the catalytic properties by tuning the acidity of BAS in 8-MR (e.g. density, distribution, strength) or engineering new active sites.
Numerous studies have demonstrated that metal-modification is an efficient strategy to promote the catalytic capability of MOR. Transition metals (e.g. Cu, Ag, Pt etc.) loaded on H-MOR have been proposed to significantly improve the DME conversion [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Normally, they exist as the extra-framework species, and serve as synergetic centers together with BAS by activating CO or changing DME dissociation pathway. Trivalent and tetravalent metal ions (e.g. Fe3+ and Ce4+) can be incorporated into the framework of MOR though substituting partial tetrahedral Al or Si atoms. The isomorphous substitution regulates the distribution and concentration of BAS within different channels [11], [12]. Recently, Ga-modified zeolites have drawn enormous interests in aromatization of light alkanes, propane dehydrogenation and deoxygenation of benzaldehyde [13], [14], [15], because Ga introduction can tune zeolite acidity or form cooperative sites with acid sites, which contribute to the improvement of catalytic performance. Deng and his co-workers identified the neighboring BAS-Ga pairs which show synergistic mechanism resulted from the Ga species adjacent to BAS [14]. These BAS-Ga pairs are responsible for great selectivity of aromatics in MTA reaction. Faro et. al found that the introduced Ga species generate strong Lewis acid sites (LAS), thus benefiting the alkane activation step of propane aromatization [16].
Herein, we successfully tuned the acid strength of BAS in MOR by Ga modification. Several Ga-modified H-MOR with different loadings were obtained by incipient wetness impregnation. By combination of characterization, DFT calculation and kinetics study, the textural and acidic properties along with the existing form of Ga species are determined. We correlated these results to the improved catalytic performance and revealed the promotion mechanism caused by Ga modification.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Catalyst preparation
To completely remove organic templates, calcination of commercial Na-MOR (Si/Al= 8.2, Catalyst Plant of Nankai University) was carried out at 823 K for 5 h. Then the catalyst powder was exchanged with 0.2 M aqueous NH4NO3 solutions (Damao Chemical Reagent) at 353 K for 6 h. The mixture was washed with deionized water, and he filtered solid was dried at 383 K for 10 h. Then we repeated the ion-exchange procedure to ensure the complete removal of Na+. Finally, the resulting catalyst was calcined at 773 K for 4 h and converted to H-form (H-MOR).
Ga-modified mordenite were obtained through incipient wetness impregnation. In a typical process, a certain amount of Ga(NO3)3‧xH2O (Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd.) was resolved to deionized water, which was added to H-MOR powder under continuous stirring. Afterwards, the wet solid was naturally dried at room temperature, following by calcination at 773 K for 4 h in air. We denote the Ga modified samples as nGa/H-MOR (n = 0.28 wt%, 1 wt% and 2 wt%), in which n represents the actual content of Ga which was determined by ICP-OES.
2.2. Catalytic characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on an X-ray diffractometer with a model of Rigaku D/max-2500. Cu Kα (λ = 1.54056 Å) is the radiation source, and the operate conditions are 40 kV and 200 mA. The 2θ ranges from 5° to 50° and the scan speed was set to 8° min−1.
N2 adsorption-desorption was carried out at the temperature of liquid nitrogen on a Micromeritics ASAP 2460 adsorption apparatus.
The actual contents of Si, Al and Ga were determined with a Varian inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscope (ICP-OES) with a model of Vista-MPX. Before testing, ~20 mg of the as-synthesized catalyst was dissolved in 2 mL HF solution, then 40 mL saturated solution of H3BO3 was added to complex the F- ion.
The morphology of sample was obtained by scanning electron microscope (SEM) on Hitachi S4800 operated at 5 kV.
The Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of O–H region were obtained by Nicolet 6700 of Thermo Fisher Scientific with a resolution of 4 cm−1 and 32 scans. An MCT detector cooled by liquid N2 was used. Background was collected under vacuum at 423 K. 10 mg of as-prepared catalyst was tableted to the self-supporting wafer. Then we placed it into an in-situ transmission cell, followed by degassed at 723 K to eliminate adsorbed impurities. The spectra were eventually obtained from 4000 to 1200 cm−1 at 423 K.
Pyridine was selected as the probe molecule to obtained FTIR spectra (Py-IR) on the same spectrometer. After pretreatment at the same conditions, the background spectrum was collected at 423 K with the same scanning parameters. The pyridine vapor was brought into the cell by helium flow, followed by static adsorption for 30 min under pyridine atmosphere. After saturated adsorption of pyridine, the sample was degassed to eliminate gaseous and weakly adsorbed pyridine. All spectra were eventually obtained from 4000 to 1200 cm−1 at 423 K.
NH3-TPD-IR after pyridine titration was also carried out on Nicolet 6700. After pretreatment and pyridine saturation, the sample was evacuated to ensure the complete removal of gaseous and weakly adsorbed pyridine. Then, a flow of 10 vol% NH3/He was switched in. Once NH3 adsorption was finished, the He flow was used to purge the cell. The spectra were recorded every 20 s as the temperature raised from 423 to 823 K with a steady rate of 10 K/min.
In-situ FTIR study of DME-CO sequent adsorption was also performed after the same pretreatment process. The sample was exposed to 10 vol% DME/He for 10 min, following by He purging. After background spectrum was collected, CO was passed through the in-situ cell for 1 h and the spectra were recorded every 30 s by averaging 32 scans.
Infrared spectra of CO adsorption at low temperature were recorded on a CRCP-7070 in-situ transient analysis platform equipped with a Bruker Tensor Ⅱ. The self-supporting wafer of catalyst was placed in a transmission cell equipped with CaF2 windows. After dehydrating the catalyst at 573 K for 2 h, it was cooled down to 120 K. The FTIR spectra were measured at different CO pressure.
2.3. Catalyst evaluation
Catalytic performance was evaluated on a fixed bed reactor. The inner diameter of the reactor is 8 mm. 1 mL of as-synthesized catalyst (~500 mg) after crushing and sieving was placed into the reactor. After heated to 473 K and kept for 9 h at a constant N2 flow rate of 100 mL·min−1, the catalyst was exposed to 100 mL·min−1 feed gas (DME/CO = 1/49, vol. /vol.), keeping the temperature and pressure 473 K and 1.5 MPa respectively. The effluent was analyzed by online gas chromatography (GC, Agilent 7890B) equipped with a Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) and a flame ionization detector (FID). To prevent product condensation, gas phase was kept at 353 K and passed through transfer lines to the GC system. Since no byproduct was detected by GC, the selectivity to MA (SMA) was considered to be 100% here. Additionally, BAS within 8-MR channels are considered the only active sites for this reaction. Hence, the DME conversion (XDME, %), space-time yield of MA (STYMA, g·kgcat−1·h−1) and TOF (h−1) were determined according to the following equations:

where nDME,in and nDME,out represent the number of moles of DME in the feed and exhaust (mol), respectively. QDME is the inlet volume flow rate (mL/h), MMA is molecular weight of MA (g/mol), and mcat is the mass of catalyst (g). B8-MR refers to the concentration of BAS within 8-MR channels (μmol/g).
2.4. Computational details
The density functional theory (DFT) calculations presented in this work were performed using Dmol3 program package with all electron double numerical quality basis set and polarization functions (DNP). For the description of exchange-correlation functional, generalized gradient approximation proposed by Perdew Wang (GGA-PW91) method was employed. The convergence criteria for energy, maximum force and displacement are 2 × 10−5 hartree, 4 × 10−3 hartree/Å and 5 × 10−3 Å, respectively. The DFT-D method was employed to describe the dispersion correction between molecules and zeolite framework. Transition state (TSs) of acetyl formation which is the rate-determining step was located by complete linear synchronous transit and quadratic synchronous transit (complete LST/QST) and confirmed by only one imaginary frequency.
The framework structure of MOR has been described in our previous studies.[8], [12] In this work, a cluster model was built from the periodic MOR. Considering that the BAS at T3O33 site within the 8-MR side pocket has been proved as the selective active site for DME carbonylation, a model of 44 tetrahedra enclosing the 8-MR at the center of structure was built to study the role of Ga–OH species. The edge of the cluster was saturated by H atom at 1.11 Å from the O atoms and orientated in the direction of O–Si bonds in the next coordination sphere. The structure of MOR with Ga–(OH)2+ (labeled as Ga/H-MOR) was determined based on the following two principles: 1. a BAS was fixed at T3O33 site, i.e. one Si atom at T3 site was replaced by an Al atom and the negative charge was compensated by a H atom at O33 site. 2. The Ga–(OH)2+ was used to balance the negative charge originated from the most stabile site of the second framework Al in the 8-MR. The optimized structure of Ga/H-MOR was shown in Fig. 1. The deprotonation energy (DPE) was calculated using the equations as the previous work.[12].

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Textural and morphological properties
The XRD patterns show that the characteristic diffractions of all Ga-modified catalysts are identical to the parent H-MOR (Fig. S1), which suggests that the crystal structure of MOR with different Ga loadings was well-preserved upon incipient wetness impregnation. No typical diffractions of new phase that relates to Ga species are observed, suggesting the great dispersion of Ga species on zeolites. Element analysis results obtained by ICP-OES (Table 1) suggest that impregnation method almost does not affect the content of Al and Si. The Si/Al ratios of all samples remain approximately 8.2, almost identical to the parent H-MOR. The N2 adsorption-desorption experiments on H-MOR and Ga/H-MOR samples show typical type I isotherms (Fig. S2), indicating microporous structure of all the as-prepared catalysts. The textural properties of Ga/H-MOR are nearly the same with parent sample. When the content of Ga is increased to 2 wt%, there is a slight increase in BET surface, probably due to the aggregation of Ga species on the external surface. These listed data confirmed that Ga loading doesn’t block the channels of MOR. SEM images reveal that the H-MOR sample shows a nanosheet-stacked morphology (Fig. S3). After Ga loading, the morphology and crystal size are maintained. Therefore, the impact of Ga modification on physical properties can be neglected.

3.2. Acidity characterizations
In MOR, the BAS within 8-MR served as active centers to catalyze DME carbonylation to MA.[4], [17] Therefore, it is crucial to quantificationally evaluate the acidic properties of H-MOR and Ga modified samples such as the number and location of BAS. Here, two basic probe molecules with different sizes were used to probe the acid sites located at different positions, which has been widely reported.[4], [9], [18], [19], [20] The framework of MOR zeolite has typical one dimensional aligned channels, consisting of 12-MR main channels (6.5 ×7.0 Å) and 8-MR channels (2.6 ×5.7 Å) with intersecting 8-MR side pockets (3.4 ×4.8 Å). Although a few researches reported that pyridine can penetrate into the 8-MR channels at a relatively low temperature,[21] it is generally thought that the relative large kinetic diameter (i.e. 5.9 Å) makes pyridine selectively titrate the BAS within 12-MR channels under appropriate adsorption conditions but is inaccessible to the BAS within 8-MR channels.[4], [20], [22] Therefore, we conducted pyridine adsorption IR to determine acidity within 12-MR channels. Fig. 2a displays the FTIR spectra of all samples. In general, two peaks around 1542 and 1633 cm−1 can be assigned to pyridine molecules interacted with BAS. Distinct bands at 1454 and 1612 cm−1 are due to the interaction between pyridine molecules and LAS. The strong peak around 1489 cm−1 is the result of co-contribution of BAS and LAS. We calculated the acid concentration of all samples within 12-MR channels according to the integrated band areas of Py-IR. As can be seen from Table 2, with the Ga loading increasing, the LAS located within 12-MR channels increased gradually. On the contrary, the amount of BAS in both 8-MR and 12-MR decreased after Ga loading, inferring that introduction of Ga species by impregnation leads to the changes in both Brønsted and Lewis acidity. In previous reports, the extra-framework Ga species usually serve as LAS, which provides a reasonable explanation about the increment of LAS.[14], [23] The reduction of BAS might be due to the substitution of a few bridging hydroxyl groups by Ga species according to Kazansky et. al.[24] An another tentative reason is that the BAS are partially covered by Ga species.[23].

obtained based on FTIR spectra in O–H stretching region.
FTIR spectra of the fresh parent H-MOR and Ga/H-MOR are displayed in Fig. 2b. In the O–H stretching region, MOR usually possesses four overlapping peaks related to different O–H species. The small peak around 3690 and 3733 cm−1 can be assigned to O–H stretching vibration of the extra-framework Al species (Al–OH) and the terminal silanol group (Si–OH), respectively. The broad asymmetric band centered at 3598 cm−1 was due to two types of O–H stretching vibration related to MOR framework.[25] The O–H groups within 8-MR lead to the appearance of characteristic peak at 3586 cm−1, and the other one around 3605 cm−1 is due to the BAS within 12-MR channels. Fig. 2b illustrated the variation of band intensity at 3598 cm−1. It went through a slightly reduction with the increasing content of Ga loading. The proportion of different types of O–H groups can be obtained by peak fitting using a mixed Gaussian-Lorentzian function. Combined with the amount of BAS within 12-MR determined by pyridine-adsorption IR above, the quantities of BAS located within 8-MR channels can be calculated, which are also listed in Table 2. In accordance with the variation trend of BAS within 12-MR channels, the concentration of BAS within 8-MR channels also decreased after Ga loading. Since the BAS within 8-MR are considered as the exclusive active centers,[26] the reduction of acid density is contrary to the activity improvement after Ga modification (see 3.4 catalytic performance). Hence, the changes in the content of BAS can’t account for the enhanced catalytic performance.
Besides density and distribution of BAS, the strength of BAS is also of vital importance to carbonylation activity. Stronger BAS are favorable for the conversion of DME to MA in both heteropoly acids or zeolite catalysis systems, with negligible effect on selectivity.[26], [27] DFT calculations also confirmed that the reaction is catalyzed only by the T3-O33 position located within 8-MR.[5] Therefore, the strength of BAS within 8-MR channels is considered as another significant descriptor of DME carbonylation activity.
NH3-TPD has been commonly used to determine the acidity (not only amount but also strength) in zeolites. However, the smaller dynamic diameter of NH3 molecule (2.6 Å) enables both 8-MR and 12-MR channels accessible. In other words, it is impossible to solely use NH3 as the probe molecule for distinguishing the acidic strength in 8-MR.
Thus, we conducted NH3 adsorption and desorption FTIR after achieving the occupation of 12-MR with the preadsorption of pyridine. Fig. 3a displays the IR spectra from 1350 to 1530 cm−1, in which the characteristic band at 1430 cm−1 is attributed to NH3 adsorbed on BAS.[28] Since BAS within 12-MR channels were already shielded selectively by pyridine, the characteristic band here is only caused by NH3 adsorbed on the BAS within 8-MR. With increasing the temperature from 423 K to 823 K, NH3 molecules began to desorb from BAS. Thus, the band around 1430 cm−1 decreased gradually. The variation of the band intensity at 1430 cm−1 vs temperature (denoted as d(I)/dT) was shown in Fig. 3b, which represents the desorption rate of NH3 on 1Ga/H-MOR. To visualize the difference in desorption rates of NH3 on different samples, the correlations between first-order derivative of band intensity versus temperature (-d(I)/dT) was plotted in Fig. 3c. Obviously, the maximum of the desorption rates shifts to higher temperature as the Ga loading increases. That is to say, the strength of BAS within 8-MR increases and achieves the highest value at Ga loading of 1 wt%. When the Ga loading reaches 2 wt%, the peak shifts backwards, indicating the strength of BAS in 8-MR channels is weakened. It is probably due to further reduction of BAS concentration within 8-MR channels. Notably, although Ga species introduced by incipient impregnation result in decline of BAS within 8-MR channels in a relative low Ga loading (≤ 1%), it still shows a great positive effect on BAS strength. This phenomenon agrees with the work reported by Deng et.al. that extra-framework Ga species as LAS can interact with BAS and form Brønsted-Lewis synergetic centers with enhanced BAS strength.[14].

3.3. Analysis of Ga species in Ga/HMOR
For further investigation, we tried to identify the existing form of Ga species in MOR, aiming at providing clear explanations of the function of Ga species on acidity and catalytic capability. Because of the weak interactions between Ga species and CO, the band ascribed to CO interacted with Ga species would completely disappear at room temperature. Herein, CO adsorbed-IR at low temperature was performed. Fig. 4a presents the C–O stretching region with increasing equilibrium pressure of CO on H-MOR. After CO adsorption at 5.4 mbar, two prominent bands around 2173 and 2137 cm−1 can be observed, which can be ascribed to the vibration of CO coordinating to the acidic proton of BAS and physically adsorbed CO, respectively. [29] In line with the XRD results, the absence of peak centered at 2235 cm−1 suggests there are no gallium oxide species (e.g. Ga2O3)[30].

Fig. 4b illustrates IR spectra of CO adsorption at the same equilibrium pressure of 30 mbar on the catalysts with different Ga loading. It is noteworthy the characteristic peak around 2173 cm−1 presents slight shifts to the lower frequency on 1Ga/H-MOR and 2Ga/HMOR, indicating the presence of Ga species gives rise to the redshift. Given that the peaks at 2235 and 2147 cm−1, which are due to CO coordinated to gallium oxides[30] and univalent Ga+ species[31] cannot be observed in Fig. 4b, we speculated that the band shift is most likely due to CO adsorbed on Ga–OH species, which is reported to center at 2167 cm−1[31]. Moreover, this small effect on the band shift also indicating such Ga species exist at a relatively low content.
Further, we calculated the DPE and the bond length of O–H (dO–H) of BAS at T3O33, which are two descriptors of acidic strength. The smaller DPE and longer dO–H indicate the stronger acidity. As listed in Table 3, the DPE of Ga/H-MOR is lower than that in H-MOR while the dO–H of Ga/H-MOR is longer than that in H-MOR. This indicates that the Ga–OH species enhance the Brønsted acidity at T3-O33, which is consistent with our experimental results.

3.4. Catalytic performance
Figs. 5a and 5b illustrate the catalytic capability of parent H-MOR and Ga-modified samples on DME carbonylation. The MA selectivity can reach nearly 100% in all samples, suggesting that Ga modification has a negligible influence on selectivity. However, the DME conversion increases first and then decreases with increasing Ga content, and the highest conversion (65.1%) was achieved in 1Ga/H-MOR. Fig. 5c presents the TOFs normalized by the number of BAS within 8-MR channels. With the increasing concentration of Ga species, the TOF increases monotonically and 2Ga/H-MOR exhibits the highest TOF. In other words, the catalytic ability of per active site is improved as Ga loading increases. As shown in Fig. 5d, the apparent activation energy over the parent H-MOR and 1Ga/H-MOR were also calculated according to Arrhenius equation. Considering the fast deactivation of the catalysts, the initial activities at 1.5 h were used. The apparent activation energy over H-MOR and 1Ga/H-MOR are 77.9 and 73.8 kJ/mol respectively. Iglesia et. al have proposed that the critical step which limits the speed of DME carbonylation is CO insertion.[3] Consequently, we compared the activation barriers of rate-determining step on H-MOR and Ga/H-MOR by DFT calculation (Table 3). They are 101 kJ/mol and 95 kJ/mol on H-MOR and Ga/H-MOR respectively, which in agreement with our experimental data.

Then, we tried to use in-situ FTIR to figure out the mechanism of Ga species in promoting MA production. After DME adsorption and helium purging, the surface saturated by methoxy intermediates were obtained. Once CO was introduced into the cell, we can directly observe the formation of acetyl groups. The IR spectra of CO adsorbed on the parent H-MOR and 1Ga/H-MOR within 60 mins were collected (Fig. S4). The increasing band centered at 1640 cm−1 suggesting the formation of acetyl intermediates on both samples.[8] Besides, the band at 1607 and 1483 cm−1 can be ascribed to condensed polyaromatic and monocyclic aromatic species as carbon deposition precursor, respectively.[32], [33] The peak around 1390 cm−1 is usually caused by the alkyl group connected to the aromatics.[34] The appearance and increase of these four characteristic bands after CO was introduced indicating that CO is involved in or even accelerates the coke formation.[35] The band intensity at 1640 cm−1 with reaction time was plotted in Fig. 6. The concentration of acetyl intermediates on both H-MOR or 1Ga/H-MOR increases rapidly first and then the momentum slow down because of limited methyl groups. Notably, the formation rate of acetyl intermediates over 1Ga/H-MOR is apparently faster than H-MOR, suggesting Ga species are favorable for the CO insertion, which is also confirmed by the above DFT calculation.

Therefore, we attribute the promotion effect on DME carbonylation to Ga species (i.e. Ga–OH) introduced by impregnation. Combined with the characterizations and DFT calculations, it is reasonable to believe although the Ga–OH species result in a decline of BAS within 8-MR channels to some extent, they enhance the acid strength at the same time. The latter facilitates the formation of MA by lowering the activation barrier. Therefore, the overall impact of Ga modification on DME carbonylation is positive. Excess Ga loading (2%) leads to a further reduction of BAS intensity within 8-MR channels, which makes the MA yield lower than that on H-MOR.
4. Conclusions
In this work, MOR zeolites with different Ga loadings were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. Ga modification has little impact on the morphology and pore structure of MOR. Nevertheless, the catalytic activity was enhanced with unchanged MA selectivity and the optimal DME conversion was achieved at Ga loading of 1 wt%. The combination of the FTIR in O–H region, Py-IR and NH3-TPD-IR after pyridine titration illustrates that the strength of BAS within 8-MR can be enhanced by Ga species, although the amount of BAS within 8-MR channels slightly decreased. According to CO adsorbed-IR at low temperature, we deduce that Ga species present as extra-framework Ga–OH species in MOR. As evidenced by DFT calculation, these species result in an enhancement of BAS acidity. Kinetic studies, IR of DME-CO sequent adsorption, as well as DFT calculations suggest that Ga species improve catalytic performance through promoting the formation of acetyl intermediates. This work provides a strategy to tune the Brønsted acidity of aluminosilicate zeolites. It also illuminates the promotion mechanism of BAS strength on DME carbonylation. These results inspire further design and modification of zeolites.

1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
