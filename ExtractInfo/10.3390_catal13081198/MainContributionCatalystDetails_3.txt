The given document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). It focuses on the catalytic cracking of bio-oil using metal-doped HZSM-5 zeolite catalysts. While it examines the conversion of oxygenates and selectivity toward hydrocarbons like light olefins, it does not specifically cover the conversion of propane to propylene via dehydrogenation reactions. Since PDH/ODH is not discussed, the details requested about the catalyst composition, performance metrics, feed composition, and process conditions are not applicable.
