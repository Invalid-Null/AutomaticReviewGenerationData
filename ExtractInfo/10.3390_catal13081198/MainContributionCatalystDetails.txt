Based on the multiple document extracts provided, none of them contain relevant information about propane dehydrogenation catalysts, processes, or results. The documents focus on metal-doped HZSM-5 zeolite catalysts for bio-oil cracking, not propane dehydrogenation. Since no pertinent details are provided, I have indicated "No" relevance and left the main scientific contribution XML structure blank. Let me know if any other documents with relevant propane dehydrogenation details become available, so I can extract key information to populate the XML structure.
