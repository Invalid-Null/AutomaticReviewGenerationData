Ga2O3/HSSZ-13 for dehydrogenation of ethane: Effect of pore geometry of support




1. Introduction
Ethylene is a very important raw material in industrial processes, which is conventionally obtained by the pyrolysis of gaseous alkanes and liquid petroleum products. Nowadays, the catalytic conversion of ethane to ethylene has drawn intense attention because of the increasing demand for utilization of nature gas and shale gas instead of petroleum due to energy and environmental concerns. Conversion of ethane to ethylene through dehydrogenation in the presence of CO2 is an effective way, since the addition of CO2 can not only accelerate the dehydrogenation by consuming the H2 via reverse water–gas shift reaction, but also slow down the deactivation by eliminating the coke via Boudouard reaction [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8].
Cr2O3 and Ga2O3 based catalysts have proved more efficient than others for the dehydrogenation of light alkane in the presence of CO2 [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Ga2O3-loaded ZSM-5 has been studied extensively as an excellent catalyst for aromatization of light alkane [10], [11], [12]. Our previous work has shown that high Si/Al ratio HZSM-5 supported Ga2O3 is active and stable in dehydrogenation of ethane and propane in the presence of CO2 [3], [13]. However, the selectivity to alkene is not high enough because of aromatization during the dehydrogenation [13]. ZSM-48 zeolite with medium pore size and weaker acidity has also been employed for supporting Ga2O3 instead of ZSM-5 in the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in the presence of CO2 [14]. Enhanced selectivity is observed over Ga2O3/ZSM-48 despite of the similar propylene yield.
SSZ-13 is a microporous silicoaluminate material, which has a tetrahedral framework made up of layers of double 6-membered rings with a sequence of ABCABC and has CHA cavities connected to the six neighboring cages by 8-membered rings, permitting sorption apertures of a maximum width of about 3.8 Å [15], smaller than that of ZSM-5 and ZSM-48 (~ 5.4 Å). And the acid strength of HSSZ-13 is a little weaker than that of HZSM-5, which is demonstrated by the 1H MAS NMR measurement [16]. SSZ-13 has been intensely studied in the reaction of methanol-to-olefins [17]. Compared with ZSM-5, the product distribution over SSZ-13 is quite different and the selectivity to C5 + and aromatics is much lower because of its smaller pore opening size. SSZ-13 also has an advantage over ZSM-5 in the reaction of deNOx. The increase of NO oxidation rates in the order of BEA (β) < MFI (ZSM-5) < CHA (SSZ-13) was believed to benefit from smaller zeolite pore size [18]. A stronger resistance to hydrocarbon poisoning over Cu/SSZ-13 than Cu/ZSM-5 was also observed because of different pore geometries of the two zeolites [15].
In the present work, Ga2O3 supported on SSZ-13 was prepared and characterized. Their catalytic performance for the dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 was investigated and compared with that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5. The influence of the pore geometry on the catalytic dehydrogenation is discussed herein on the basis of the experimental results.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
SSZ-13 zeolites with different Si/Al ratios were prepared following the procedure in the literature [19]. N,N,N-trimethyl-1-adamantanamine hydroxide (R2O) was used as the structure-directing agent. Al2(SO4)3·18H2O was taken as the Al source, Ludox SM-30 as the Si source. The molar composition of the final gel was SiO2:Al2O3:Na2O:R2O:H2O = 40:0.5x:16:5:900, where x represents the molar ratio of Si/Al. The gel was crystallized at 155 °C under stirring for 3 d. The product was filtered, washed with deionized water, dried at 100 °C and calcined at 550 °C for 8 h in the air. ZSM-5 with Si/Al ratio of 100 was prepared according to the literature [20].
The parent SSZ-13 and ZSM-5 zeolites were turned into H-form through three consecutive ion-exchanges with NH4NO3 aqueous solution at 80 °C for a total of 12 h. The gallium oxide was supported on the zeolite by the impregnation method. The catalysts obtained were denoted as yGa2O3/HSSZ-13-x (or yGa2O3/HZSM-5-x), where y represents the wt.% loading of Ga2O3.
2.2. Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired with a Persee XD-2 X-ray diffractometer using nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 30 mA. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were recorded digitally on a Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin microscope operating at 100 kV. The BET surface areas of the catalysts were determined by N2 adsorption at − 196 °C using a Micromeritics ASAP 2000 instrument. The bulk Si/Al ratios of the prepared zeolites were measured by X-ray fluorescence spectrum (XRF) on a Bruker-AXS S4 Explorer. 27Al MAS NMR measurements were performed on a Bruker DSX 300 spectrometer at a resonance frequency of 104.3 MHz. The surface acidity was measured by NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) using a Micromeritics AutoChem II apparatus. Thermo gravimetric (TG) analysis was performed under an air flow on a Perkin-Elmer 7 Series Thermal Analyzer to determine the amount of coke deposited on the catalyst following the reaction. GC–MS tests were completed on a Thermo Focus DSQ GC–MS instrument with a HP-5 MS column (30 m, 0.25 mm i.d. stationary phase thickness 0.25 μm).
2.3. Reaction testing
Catalytic tests for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2 were performed at 650 °C in a fixed-bed flow microreactor at atmospheric pressure. The catalyst load was 200 mg, and it was pretreated at 650 °C for 2 h under a nitrogen flow prior to the reaction. The gaseous reactant contained 3 vol.% ethane and 15 vol.% carbon dioxide with the balance consisting of nitrogen at a total flow rate of 30 ml/min. The hydrocarbon reaction products were analyzed using an on-line GC equipped with a 6-m Porapak Q packed column and a FID. The gaseous products were analyzed on-line by another GC equipped with a TCD and a carbon molecular sieve 601 column.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
The SSZ-13 supports with various Si/Al ratios were prepared and their XRD patterns after gallium oxide loading are shown in Fig. 1. All the samples exhibit the characteristic peaks at 2θ = 9.5, 12.8, 16.0, 17.9, 20.5, 25.1 and 30.5, corresponding to the typical CHA-type reflections of (101), (110), (021), (003), (211), (104) and (401) [21]. The peak intensities of the samples are almost the same except for the one with a Si/Al ratio of 15, suggesting a poorer crystallinity. No diffraction patterns corresponding to Ga2O3 are found for all the samples, indicating a good dispersion of gallium oxide on these HSSZ-13 supports. The surface area of HSSZ-13-30 after Ga2O3 loading change a little, indicating gallium oxide dispersed well on the support and the pores of the support were not blocked.

27Al MAS NMR spectra of the SSZ-13 supports were acquired to characterize the local coordination environment of aluminum atoms in zeolites (shown in Fig. S1). An intense line at ~ 55 ppm assigned to framework Al atoms in tetrahedral coordination can be observed in the spectra of all the samples, while the line at 0 ppm from extra-framework octahedral coordinate aluminum was very weak, indicating that the majority of the Al species has been incorporated into the SSZ-13 framework.
3.2. Acidity measurements
The acidity of SSZ-13 supported Ga2O3 catalysts was measured by the NH3-TPD method and the results are summarized in Table 1. There are evidently two desorption peaks on the TPD profiles of all the samples (shown in Fig. S2). The low and high temperature peaks at about 200 °C and 440 °C correspond to the weak and strong acid sites of the samples, respectively. The total amount of acid sites of the supported samples did not change that much at the Si/Al ratio below 60, indicating that these acid sites mainly come from dispersed Ga2O3. However, the acid sites decrease with further increasing of Si/Al ratio, due to the weaker interaction between the gallium oxide and the support. The acid strength distribution also changes, the acid sites with weak strength increases with the Si/Al ratio though the total amount of acid sites dropped.
The acidity of HSSZ-13 supported Ga2O3 catalyst was also compared with that of HZSM-5 supported one. As described in Table 1, the total amount of acid sites on Ga2O3/HSSZ-13 catalyst is similar to Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio, while the amount of medium to strong acid sites is much lower, indicating that the acid strength of Ga2O3/HSSZ-13 is weaker in comparison to that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5.
3.3. Catalytic performance
Dehydrogenation of ethane in the presence of CO2 was carried out at 650 °C over various HSSZ-13 supported Ga2O3 catalysts, together with HSSZ-13-30 for comparison. The results are given in Table 2. The activity of pure HSSZ-13-30 was far lower than the Ga2O3 supported ones. The initial conversion of ethane changes a little at the Si/Al ratio below 60 and decreases with further increasing the Si/Al ratio, which was in consistent with the trend of the total amount of acid sites, indicating that acid sites may play an important role in the dehydrogenation.

The activity of Ga2O3/HSSZ-13 is higher than that of Ga2O3/HZSM-5 with similar Si/Al ratio under identical conditions, though their acid amount is close. This is similar to the situation in the oxidation of NO, which is thought to benefit from smaller zeolite pore size [18]. The selectivity to ethylene over Ga2O3/HSSZ-13 is also higher due to its lower selectivity to aromatics. The aromatization over Ga2O3/HSSZ-13 catalysts was totally suppressed. It is well known that hydrogen transfer reactions can be greatly reduced with the decreasing of strong acid sites, leading to the inhibition of formation of alkanes and aromatics [22]. But this is not the case here, since both 5Ga2O3/HSSZ-13-30 and 5Ga2O3/HSSZ-13-60 have more strong acid sites than 5Ga2O3/HZSM-5-13-100. A possible reason is the SSZ-13 zeolite with pore size of 0.38 nm only adopts linear hydrocarbons but excludes the larger aromatic hydrocarbons. These bulkier species, if formed internally, cannot diffuse out and become products. In contrast, aromatics can diffuse out of the pores of HSZM-5 zeolite (ca. 0.54 nm). The data of the calculated carbon balance (shown in Table. 2) also suggested more aromatics species stayed in the pores of HSSZ-13.
To confirm the above explanation, the coke over 5Ga2O3/HSSZ-13-100 and 5Ga2O3/HZSM-5-100 after the dehydrogenation reaction was analyzed by the GC–MS, the results are shown in Fig. 3. Similar chromatograms were obtained, showing the components of coke on both catalysts are almost the same. This indicates that the two catalysts probably suffer the same dehydrogenation mechanism through a heterolytic dissociation reaction pathway. Meanwhile, the side reactions such as oligomerization, cyclization and aromatization, existed in both catalysts, leading to the formation of bulkier species. In contrast with ZSM-5, these bulkier species cannot diffuse out of the small pore of SSZ-13, resulting in its lower selectivity to aromatics. This can also be proved by the fact that more coke formed over 5Ga2O3/HSSZ-13-100 as shown in Table 1.

Both catalysts deactivate during the reaction, but the deactivation rates are quite different. The initial activity drops by about 30% after 6 h over Ga2O3/HZSM-5. While for Ga2O3/HSSZ-13 with similar Si/Al ratio, the reduction in the ethane conversion was about 50% during the same period.
The effect of gallium oxide loading was also investigated. The initial ethane conversion was found to increase with increasing extents of gallium loading and then decreased as the content was further increased (Fig. 4), such that 7 wt.% Ga2O3 loading is optimal. The initial yield of ethylene reached 30.5%. To our knowledge, it may be the best result in the catalytic ethane dehydrogenation reaction in the presence of CO2 over the gallium oxide supported catalysts.

3.4. Regeneration test
A regeneration treatment of the 7Ga2O3/HSSZ-13 catalyst after 6 h reaction at 650 °C in the presence of CO2 was attempted. As shown in Fig. 5, the ethane conversion decreases from 35.6% to 17.8% after 6 h on stream. The reaction was interrupted under a N2 stream, and then air was introduced at 550 °C for 2 h to burn off carbon species deposited on the catalyst. The initial ethane conversion on the regenerated catalyst is 31.9%, which is a bit lower than that of the fresh catalyst, showing that the original activity of the catalyst could not be fully restored. Meanwhile, after the second regeneration the activity of the catalyst is almost fully recovered. The increase in the activity after regeneration is owing to the removal of carbonaceous deposit on the catalyst, and the reduction in the activity after the first regeneration could be due to the loss of some temporary active sites on the fresh catalyst, which is similar as that of β-Ga2O3 [23].

4. Conclusions
The catalytic dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene in the presence of CO2 was carried out over HSSZ-13 supported Ga2O3 catalysts. Ga2O3/HSSZ-13 is more active in dehydrogenation than Ga2O3/HZSM-5, and shows higher selectivity to ethylene. 34% ethane conversion with 86.9% ethylene selectivity can be obtained. The excellent catalytic performance of Ga2O3/HSSZ-13 can be attributed to the unique pore geometry of SSZ-13 support. However, the stability on Ga2O3/HSSZ-13 is lower in comparison to Ga2O3/HZSM-5, which may result from its heavy coke deposition due to the worse diffusion ability for the aromatics formed during the reaction.
