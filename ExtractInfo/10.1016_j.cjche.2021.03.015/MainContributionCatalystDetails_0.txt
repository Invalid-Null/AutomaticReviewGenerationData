The given document does not appear to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation. While it discusses catalytic hydrocracking of heavy oils, it does not specifically mention conversion of propane to propylene or use propane as a feedstock. The document focuses on enhancing bifunctional catalysts containing molybdenum sulfide and zirconium-doped silica-alumina for hydrocracking of heavy oils, but does not relate this to propane dehydrogenation. Since propane dehydrogenation is not discussed, I cannot extract details about catalyst composition, performance metrics, or process conditions as requested.
