Highly active catalysts: Double-shelled hollow nanospheres with tiny Pt NPs
Abstract
A facile strategy was reported to fabricate a novel Pt-based metal oxide double-shelled hollow nanospheres (MDSHs), which avoided the traditional tedious procedures. It was attractive that the formation mechanism of DSHs involved redeposition of etch-released silica species and self-assembly of metal oxide units. To verify the successful synthesis and structure features of Pt-LCDSHs catalyst, the as-prepared samples were characterized by several techniques, such as SEM, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm analysis, TEM, EDX, XRD and XPS. Results indicated that all of MDSHs possessed double-shelled structures with both the inner and outer shells composing of metal oxide units. Interestingly, the metal oxide of the DHSs could offer abundant active points for Pt NPs and the space between the double shells also could be filled with Pt NPs. What's more, compared with the pure samples, the Pt-embedded La2O3-CeO2-DSHs exhibited the highest catalytic performance (6.58 × 10−3 min−1) and good reusability with a conversion of 94% even after eight cycles, which were evaluated by means of the reduction of 4-nitrophenol monitored by UV–vis spectra. Finally, a possible reaction mechanism for the reduction reaction on Pt-based La2O3-CeO2-DSHs was also proposed.
1 INTRODUCTION
Ultrafine platinum nanoparticles (Pt NPs) based nanomaterials are vitally active components as catalysts in various promising chemical reactions, such as propane dehydrogenation, carbon monoxide conversion and biomass utilization1-4, which is owing to their excellent ability to the promotion of oxidation and reduction processes. Compared with other noble metal NPs (such as Au, Pd and Ru), Pt NPs tend to less over-oxidation, metal leaching and self-poisoning, thus have higher selectivity.5 And more recent papers related to Pt nanoparticles have been reported.6-14 However, challenges still exist, Pt NPs tend to agglomerate and exhibit serious instability caused by the high surface energy and strong van der Waals forces during the catalysis process, resulting in distinct deterioration of their intrinsic activity and reusability.15, 16 Present methods to maintain the Pt NPs' tiny size and recyclability primarily concentrated on the physical separation.17, 18 The Pt NPs could be partly prevented from aggregation through loading Pt NPs on the surfaces of supports or embedding them into porous materials.19-21 Nevertheless, the Pt NPs incline to sinter or detach under the extreme experimental conditions, like calcination or vigorous stirring. Therefore, it is crucial to find a way to get over these limitations. To date, studies suggest that the unique structure of yolk-shell structure materials could not only effectively protect the inner compounds under harsh conditions, but also possess potential application.22, 23 Given all that, fabricating yolk-shell nanomaterial has been extensively known as an efficient and promising strategy to prevent aggregation of Pt NPs.
Hollow composite nanospheres, in particular those with intricate yolk-shell structures, have attracted great interest in recent years because of their unique properties and potential applications in catalysis, nanoreactors, drug delivery, biotechnology, photonic devices, energy conversion and storage systems.24-29 During the past decades, double-shelled hollow nanospheres have been fabricated via various methods, such as vesicles, emulsions, sol–gel and templating method.30-32 For example, Li et al. prepared double-shelled TiO2 hollow nanospheres by etching the SiO2 template of SiO2@TiO2@SiO2@TiO2.33 Fang et al. successfully prepared the hierarchical yolk-shell nanocomposites composing of movable CeO2-modified cores and mesoporous SiO2 shells via the template-assisted calcination process.34 In addition, metal ion embedded carbon-related materials, such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs), can be converted into hollow structure with an annealing process based on the Kirkendall effect.35 However, most of double-shelled structures prepared by the current methods cannot be applied generally to a wide range of metal oxide materials and tend to be complicated for tedious synthetic procedures, including coating, etching and costly hard-template-assisted strategies, which may prevent them from being used in large-scale applications. Accordingly, a simple and straightforward general strategy for metal oxide double-shelled hollow nanospheres is highly desired.
More importantly, in recent years, the shell materials of the double-shell nanostructures are always only single component, which may have low catalyst activity when used as the shell layer materials for Pt-based catalysts. Hence, a double-shell nanocomposites composed of two different metal oxides are desirably prepared in order to enhance the synergistic effect, thus improving the performance of Pt-based catalyst. Saeid et al. synthesized uniform nanoporous CuCo2O4 double-shelled hollow microspheres for high-performance asymmetric supercapacitors via self-template.36 Viridiana et al. synthesized a highly active Au-CeO2@ZrO2 yolk–shell nanoreactor for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP) .37
Herein, we reported a simple pathway to prepare single (La2O3 and CeO2) and composites (La2O3-CeO2) MDSHs (metal oxide double-shelled hollow nanospheres) with synthesized hollow mesoporous SiO2 as templates. Firstly, the MDSHs included redeposition of etch-released silica species and the strong adsorption of the hollow mesoporous SiO2 nanosphere templates. Specially, this novel facile method may become a general synthetic approach for fabricating DSHs of other metal oxides. And then, the ultrafine Pt NPs were encapsulated into the shell layer of MDSHs concurrently through the unique deposition-precipitation process. The detailed structure and synthetic procedures of Pt-MDSHs were depicted in Figure 1. On one hand, the Pt NPs could be prevented to aggregate and maintained at a small size. On the other hand, the mixed oxide layer could promote catalytic properties due to the enhanced synergistic effect with Pt NPs. For heterogeneous catalysis, the Pt-based La2O3-CeO2-DSHs displayed superior catalytic activity and reusability when evaluated in catalyzing the reduction of 4-NP by NaBH4.

SiO2 were synthesized according to a modified Stöber methods.38 Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS, 2 ml) was rapidly added into a mixture of ethanol (40 ml), deionized water (10 ml), and ammonia (3 ml) and then stirred vigorously at room temperature for 6 hr. The silica particles were centrifuged, washed with ethanol and dried overnight. The as-synthesized sSiO2 (50 mg) were homogeneously dispersed in deionized water (10 ml), followed by the addition of CTAB (12.5 mg), NaAlO2 (26.5 mg) and Na2CO3 (20.5 mg). After stirring at 95 °C for 3 hr, the suspension was transferred into a 20 ml Teflon-lined autoclave, followed by hydrothermal treatment at 150 °C for 2 days.

2.3 Synthesis of LCDSHs
HMSs (80 mg), La (NO3)3·nH2O (30 mg) and Ce (NO3)4·6H2O were dissolved in ethanol (10 ml) in sequence. After stirring for 2 hr, the solvent of mixture were evaporated at 50 °C, the obtained powders were calcined at 500 °C for 5 hr to decompose the nitrate. The silica in HMSs were removed by etching with hot NaOH solution (2 M). The prepared La2O3-CeO2 DSHs (denoted as LCDSHs) were centrifuged and washed several times with ethanol and dried under vacuum to obtain the final powder. The La2O3-DSHs (denoted as LDSHs) and CeO2-DSHs (denoted as CDSHs) were prepared by the aforementioned methods.

The Pt-based LDSHs (denoted as Pt-LDSHs) and Pt-based CDSHs (denoted as Pt-CDSHs) were prepared by the aforementioned methods.
2.5 Catalyst characterization
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were conducted on a FEI Tecnai G20 microscope operated at 100 kV coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs were taken using a JEOL JSM-5600 L electron microscope. Prior to analysis the samples were dispersed in ethanol, sonicated and deposited on a copper grid and dried at room temperature. Wide-angle powder X-ray diffraction patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advance Diffractometer (Germany) with Cu Ka radiation (γ = 1.5406 Å) between 10 and 90°. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were carried out at 77 K by using ASAP 2020 (Micrometrics USA). The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Rigaku ThermoPlus TG8120 analyzer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was acquired using an Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer with Al Ka (mono) anode at energy of 150 W. UV–vis spectra analysis was performed on a Shimadzu UV 3600 spectrometer.
2.6 Catalytic reduction of 4-nitrophenol
The reduction of 4-NP by NaBH4 was used as a model reaction to evaluate catalytic performances of the catalysts. In the experiment, 4-NP aqueous solution (0.03 ml, 0.01 M) was mixed with freshly prepared NaBH4 aqueous solution (0.5 ml, 0.25 M) and deionized water (2 ml) in a quartz cell, and then aqueous solution of catalysts (0.5 ml, 1 g L−1) were dispersed into the mixture. The whole reaction was carried out at room temperature and a UV–vis spectrometer was used to monitor the reaction progress at regular intervals. For the recycling experiments, the catalysts were collected by centrifugation, washed, dried and reused in the next cycles.
3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 Structure and morphology
The fabrication mechanism of MDSHs is depicted in Figure 2. In the first step, the as-prepared sSiO2 were slowly etched under the Na2CO3 solution to release silica species. Then the released silica species were self-assembled with CTAB and aluminous species on the surface of sSiO2, thus forming the shell of the HMSs. As the silica cores of sSiO2 were etched, the shell layer continuously grew until the silica cores of sSiO2 were entirely etched, ultimately form the hollow structure.39 Generally speaking, in the next process, past research method is nothing more than multilayer of coating and repeated etching or the use of organic templates as coupling agent.34 However, we take advantage of the mesoporous structure of the HMSs, thus the metal nitrates were not only deposited on the outside surface but also the inner surface of HMSs (the second step). Finally, the HMSs/metal nitrates are transformed into MDSHs through the decomposition of nitrate by calcination in air and the hollow space in middle layer derived from the etching of the silica. To the best of our knowledge, this is the novel report for the synthesis of MDSHs by utilizing the method. It overcomes the cumbersome procedures compared with most of conventional methods.

Formation mechanism of the metal oxide-DSHs
The morphologies and sizes of SiO2 and HMSs in the synthetic procedure were explicitly observed by TEM techniques. The images in Figure 3a and b illustrate that the sSiO2 show smooth surface and uniform spherical morphology with mean size about 100 nm. As shown in Figure 3c, after the redeposition and self-assemble, the hollow mesoporous structure is clearly observed and the shell is uniform with a thickness of about 15 nm. In addition, the mean size of hollow space of the HMSs is about 100 nm, in according with the size of sSiO2, suggesting the redeposition of silica and aluminium species. N2 physical adsorption analysis were applied to further study the porosity features of HMSs. The nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherm of the HMSs (Figure 3d) exhibited a type-IV isotherm with an obvious H1 hysteresis loop, suggesting a typical mesoporous structure on the basis of the IUPAC.40 The BET surface area, pore volume and mean pore size of the HMSs is 149.46 m2 g−1, 0.259 cm3 g−1 and 4.95 nm, respectively. Therefore, the porous features ensure that the metal nitrates solution could also impregnate into the interior of the hollow nanosphere.

The detailed morphology features of as-obtained HMSs/La2O3, HMSs/CeO2, HMSs/La2O3-CeO2, LDSHs, CDSHs and LCDSHs are showed in Figure 4a-f. The surfaces of HMSs all become much wider with around 20 nm for the MDSH and the nanospheres still well maintained the hollow structure and the diameters (Figure 4a-c). This impregnation process further adds to the shell thickness, indicating that the metal oxides are anchored successfully on the HMSs. This result can be attributed to the strong adsorption of the HMSs. The abundant pores structure in the shell of HMSs could not only provide active point for metal oxide precursor growing but also prevent the aggregation. In addition, the surface of HMSs/CeO2 are composed of tiny particles compared with the other two samples, which may be related to the structure of CeO2. As the Figure 4d-f shown, there is a well-defined double-shelled structure and the thickness of the void space is around 10 nm 15 nm and 13 nm, respectively, which is less than the thickness of the shell of HMSs. This phenomenon can be attributed to the growth of La2O3, CeO2 and La2O3, CeO2 units in the mesoporous of the HMSs shell. It is noted that the shell layer of the bimetallic oxides-DSHs are a little thicker than the other single metal oxides-DSHs on account of the larger depositing amount of the composites. Moreover, it is also obvious that the shell layer of bimetallic oxides-DSHs is different from the former samples, which indicated the interaction between the La and Ce. Furthermore, all the DSHs maintained the original structure of precursor despite the slightly reduction of size.

During the impregnation treatment, the Pt NPs were deposited into DSHs, giving the final product Pt-LDSHs, Pt-CDSHs, Pt-HMSs and Pt-LCDSHs, respectively. The TEM images in Figure 5a presented that the Pt NPs were well dispersed into LDSHs, regardless of the interlayer void size. However, the sizes of Pt NPs of Pt-LDHSs are relative larger about 5 nm in diameter, which are considered to be the La2O3 sructure. The accumulation of the shell layer would lead to escaping of the encaged Pt from La2O3 shell and ultimately, resulting in coalescence to about 5 nm on the La2O3 sample. In addition, the Pt-CDSHs exhibited severe aggregation, corresponding to the partly structural collapse of the CDSHs (Figure 5b). In contrast, the Pt NPs in mixed oxide shell shown in Figure 5c demonstrated dispered sizes and maintained tiny sizes. Besides, the HRTEM image of Pt NPs on the shell (Figure 5d) displayed the lattice fringes with interplanar spacing of around 0.23 nm assigning to the Pt (111) planes, indicative of the presence of crystalline Pt NPs with face centered cubic (fcc) structure. These results adequately confirmed that the Pt NPs were concurrently deposited on the cores and within the shells of the catalysts. Furthermore, the Pt-HMSs was first prepared and then consruct the layer of La2O3 in the Pt-HMSs, which was denated as LDSH-Pt. As shown in Figure 5e and f, the HMSs maintain original mesoporous structure and Pt NPs also sustain minor sizes of Pt-HMSs. The HMSs are inert material as support compared to metal oxide although the double shell structure of LDSH-Pt, and that the Pt NPs obivously aggregate during the formation of shell layer. Additionally, the EDS results (Figure 6a-c) indicated the existance of La, Ce, Pt and O elements, and the Pt-LDSHs, Pt-CDSHs and Pt-LCDSHs all showed high Pt-loaded content, and the figure is 18.1%,17.5% and 26.5% (wt), respectively.

To further study the configuration of the as-prepared samples, XRD patterns were shown in Figure 7. Accordingly, a broadly weak diffraction peak (Figure 7a) located at 27.3° and 45.2° were produced for La2O3 (JCPDS no. 22–0369). It can also be seen that the characteristic diffraction peaks (Figure 7c) centred at 28.6°, 33.1°, 47.5°, 56.3° and 69.4° corresponding to the lattice planes of (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1) and (4 0 0) of cubic fluorite-type CeO2 (JCPDS 34–0394), which were clearly discerned for the CDSHs.41 The phenomenon suggests the La and Ce precursor is completely converted to CeO2 by calcination. The characteristic peaks of CeO2 almost keep unchanged except the attenuation of intensity with regard to the bimetallic LCDSHs (shown in Figure 7e). However, by the addition of second metal oxide, the specific diffraction peaks of La2O3 had nearly vanished and the whole diffraction peaks of LCDSHs shift to smaller angle, implying that La2O3 were replaced by the distinctive peaks for the lattice planes of crystalline Ce. As reported, the La atoms were substituted by Ce atoms with smaller ionic radius [r (Ce4+) = 0.097 nm, r (La3+) = 0.106 nm)]in a solid solution.42 After Pt NPs were impregnated into DSHs, the product Pt-CDSHs displayed the characteristic diffraction peaks located at 2θ = 39.6° (Figure 7d) indexing as the (111) lattice patterns of platinum (JCPDS, 04–0802). Nevertheless, the Pt diffraction peaks in Pt-LDSHs and Pt-LCDSHs (Figure 7b and f) were not distinct, which was possibly attributed to the quite uniform dispersion compared with the agglomeration of Pt-CDSH as confirmed by the TEM images.

XPS is a useful technique to investigate the surface element compositions and the valence state of composite metal oxides. Figure 8 presented XPS survey spectra of the Pt-LCDHSs. These spectra exhibit characteristic La 3d, Ce 3d, O 1 s and Pt 4f peaks. In Figure 8a, the La 3d doublets were well defined. The core peaks located at 838.7 and 855.9 eV are ascribed to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of La3+. These peaks show clear doublet structures due to multiplet splitting. The shake-up satellites appearing on the side of the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks are thought to result from competitive core-hole screening by the nearly degenerate ligand 2p and empty La 4f orbital.43 These shake-up satellite peaks is observed at 834.9 and 852.1 eV and the corresponding satellite split is 3.6 and 3.7 eV, respectively, compared with the core peaks. As observed from Figure 8b, Ce 3d spectra can be fitted into four peaks at binding energies of 901.2, 898.8, 886.7 and 882.21 eV corresponding to Ce 3d5/2, whereas the two peaks located at 916.5 and 908.1 eV are attributed to Ce 3d3/2.44 It was also noted that there are two peak at about 885.7 eV and 904.1 eV, indicating the presence of Ce3+ state in the CeO2 lattice, thus forming oxygen vacancies in as-prepared samples. The oxygen vacancies are conductive to reduce the surface Gibbs energy, balances the surface charge, stabilize metal nanoparticles and forms surface active oxygen species.45 As displayed in Figure 8c, the characteristic peak at around 531.6 eV was indexed to adsorptive or defective oxygen. In Figure 8d, the spectra of Pt 4f revealed the two peaks of Pt at 74.2 eV and 71.4 eV corresponding to Pt 4f5/2 and Pt 4f7/2, respectively, suggesting that Pt was mostly presented in Pt (0) state.46

3.2 Catalytic activity
Herein, the reduction reaction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) into 4-aminophenol (4-AP) by NaBH4 was employed as a model reaction to evaluate the catalytic activity of the prepared heterogeneous catalysts. The catalytic conversion of poisonous 4-NP into harmless and recyclable 4-AP using Pt-based catalysts is regarded to be the most eco-friendly and efficient measure for improvement of environment, and the 4-AP is highly beneficial to the industrial production of pharmaceuticals and dyes.47 In the reaction, an excess amount of NaBH4 was added to eliminate the influence of the concentration of NaBH4 on the reduction rate. For reducing errors, the dosage of every reagent kept constant in all catalytic runs. The original 4-NP peak (Figure 9a) is at λ = 317 nm and it shifts to λ = 400 nm upon addition of the NaBH4, which caused by deprotonation of 4-NP in alkaline mediums.48 And the peak absorption was nearly unaltered after staying for 24 hr, meaning that this reaction can't proceed without catalysts due to the high kinetic barrier.49 Figure 9d shows the evolution of the absorption spectrum and the reaction time after adding a little bit of Pt-LCDSHs catalyst. It is clear that the absorption peak at 400 nm rapidly decreased and a new peak simultaneously appeared at 300 nm, which indicated the successful conversion of 4-NP to 4-AP. Furthermore, the reduction of 4-NP into 4-AP was entirely finished within 14 min. It is noted that, the isosbestic point at 313 nm was showed in the UV–vis spectra (Figure 9d), implying that the catalytic reduction without any byproduct. For comparison, the performance of single Pt-LDSHs and Pt-CDSHs were also evaluated utilizing the same reduction reactions. It can be seen from Figure 9b and c, the whole reduction reaction for Pt-LDSHs and Pt-CDSHs was completely finished within 40 min and 48 min, respectively, which are longer than composite Pt-LCDSHs. These comparative results implied that the prepared Pt-supported metal oxide catalysts exhibited higher catalytic activity than traditional inert oxide support, which further illustrated the synergistic effect among Pt, La2O3 and CeO2.

As shown in Figure 9e, the linear relationship between ln (C0/Ct) and reaction time in the reaction catalyzed by different samples is considered to follow Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics due to the excess amount of NaBH4.50 Specifically, k (min−1) is the apparent rate constant, and the concentration ratio of C0/Ct is measured from the relative intensity absorbance of A0/At at 400 nm. The kinetic rate constants (k) is calculated using the rate equation ln(C0/Ct) = kt. The apparent rate constants (k) of the as-prepared Pt-LDSHs, Pt-CDSHs and LDSHs- Pt are 3.03 × 10−3, 2.25 × 10−3 and 0.197 × 10−3 min−1, respectively. However, in sharp contrast, the sample of Pt-LCDSHs shows the highest catalytic activity (6.58 × 10−3 min−1) in this work compared with other samples. The results reaction rate indicate that the double-shelled structure can help to increase the catalysis efficiency, which is mainly due to the DHSs shell layer not only can provide abundant active points as supports to in-situ encapsulate Pt but also prevent possible migration and sintering during calcination and reaction, thus exhibiting high catalytic stability. Furthermore, the void between the double shells provides the larger sites between Pt NPs and La2O3-CeO2 which could promote the metal-support interaction, hence improving the catalytic activity. In our work, the DSHs which are composed of metal oxides are advantageous for uniform growth and distribution of Pt NPs.
Based on the above results and the theory analysis, a possible reaction mechanism was illustrated in Figure 10. It is known that Fermi level alignment occurs whenever a metal and semiconductor are placed in contact, resulting in charge redistribution and the formation of a depletion layer surrounding the metal.51 Since Pt (5.1 eV) has a higher work function than CeO2 (4.28 eV) and La2O3 (3.29 eV), electrons would leave from the LCDSHs into the surface of Pt NPs in the double shells, resulting in an electron-enriched region. Thus, BH4− and 4-NP in the aqueous solution could be easily adsorbed on the surface of metal oxide double-shelled hollow nanospheres, and the electrons transferred from BH4− to 4-NP was relayed by the Pt NPs, which was helpful to overcome the kinetic barrier of the reduction of 4-NP. Besides, the synergistic effect between Pt NPs and metal oxides may accelerate the electrons transfer across the interface of the catalyst efficiently. At last, 4-AP molecule releases from the adsorbed surface quickly. What's more, the stability and recyclability are of great importance for the practical applications of catalysts.52 Herein, the cyclic stability of the as-prepared Pt-LCDSHs catalysts was evaluated by monitoring the catalytic activity during successive cycles of the reduction reaction. As shown in Figure 9f, the catalyst exhibits relatively stable catalytic performance of 94% even after running for eight cycles.

Speculated reaction mechanism of the reduction of p-nitrophenol with Pt-LCDSHs catalyst
4 CONCLUSION
In summary, a facile general synthetic approach was reported to prepare metal oxide (La2O3, CeO2 and La2O3-CeO2)-DSHs with hollow SiO2 as templates. The DSHs assembled by metal oxide structural units were obtained through impregnation and subsequently etching processes. And the Pt NPs were encapsulated into the shell layer of DSHs, which could offer abundant active points and the space. The characterizations results indicate that the DSHs show unique double-shelled structure and high crystallinity. Compared with Pt encapsulated single metal oxides (La2O3 and CeO2) DSHs, the Pt-LCDSHs exhibited highest catalytic properties corresponding to 6.58 × 10−3 min−1 and owned good reusability with a conversion of 94% after eight cycles for the reduction reaction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol, which may be attributed to the dispersive Pt NPs and the synergistic effect among the Pt, La and Ce. More importantly, it is expected that our current work may provide new insight for constructing other multishell nanocomposites as supports to in-situ encapsulate noble metal nanoparticles for some catalytic reactions.
