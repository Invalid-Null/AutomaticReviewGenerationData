Abstract
HZSM-5 was hydrothermally synthesized by Ga substitution to regulate the texture properties for light aromatics such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes and naphthalene (BTEXN) during the lignite volatiles catalytic upgrading process. High BTEXN yield was obtained over xGa/H5(A) (added NaOH in crystallization) and the value increased with raising the amount of Ga incorporation when the Ga content was<1.26 g. 1.26 Ga/H5(A) (1.26 g Ga(NO3)3) displayed the highest yield of BTEXN (29.3 mg/g-daf coal) since Ga species and acidic protons promoted the aromatization process. However, excessive Ga brought a negative effect on the production of aromatics due to the weakened synergistic effect between Ga species and acid sites of H5. Additionally, 1.26 Ga/H5(A) with the interconnected meso-micropores and moderate acidity distribution exhibited excellent reaction stability during the 6 cycle experiments. xGa/H5(A) provided a potential prospect for enhancing the BTEXN formation during catalytic upgrading of lignite pyrolysis volatiles.

1. Introduction
Aromatics, especially benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene and naphthalene (BTEXN) are of great industrial relevance that strongly demanded for chemical intermediates. However, the traditional way of producing BTEXN from refining the finite petroleum reserves had adversely affected the strategy of sustainable development and required the development of alternative energy sources (He et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2019). Catalytic upgrading of lignite pyrolysis volatiles derived liquid fuel have been wildly investigated to produce BTEXN due to its complexity that consisting of alicyclic, aromatics, heterocyclic compounds and asphaltenes, whereas the direct application of liquid fuel was limited because of the high oxygen content, high viscosity and inefficient utilization (Li et al., 2014, Bi et al., 2020, Zhu et al., 2021). The key problem was the selection of catalysts such as HZSM-5 (H5), USY and HY zeolite (Lu et al., 2010, Wei et al., 2020, Wei et al., 2020, Wei et al., 2020). H5 could effectively convert the tar into hydrocarbons through the dehydrogenation; deoxygenation and aromatization process (Yang et al., 2021, Zhao et al., 2019). However, many problems were emerged, such as the low mass transfer result of fast deactivation over H5 by coke deposition, the low yields of light aromatics and other desired hydrocarbons. Therefore, the bifunctional catalysts were studied widely to compensate for the defects of H5 during the catalytic upgrading of lignite pyrolysis volatiles process.
Some transition elements such as Co, Ni, Mo, Zn, Cu, Ga, Zr and bimetallic species Mo/Co, Ni/Co modified H5 zeolites were extensively reported during the catalytic reforming of lignite pyrolysis volatiles reaction (Ren et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2019, Ren et al., 2018). Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2021) investigated the coupling reaction of coal tar and methanol to produce aromatics over H5 with NaOH treatment, which exhibited higher catalytic performances due to higher Brønsted acid sites and larger mesopores. Kang et al. (Kang et al., 2020) prepared Ni/Y/H5 catalysts with the appropriate acidity, uniformly dispersed and mesoporous structure to obtain clean liquid fuel during the catalytic hydroconversion of soluble portion in the extraction from Hecaogou subbituminous coal. In addition, the types of skeleton atoms of zeolite undeniably affect the formation of BTEXN over Brønsted acid sites during the aromatization reaction (Su et al., 2016). Further experimental studies showed that the combination of Ga in the zeolite framework could effectively promote the dehydrogenation-aromatization process (Gao et al., 2018). Uslamin et al. (Uslamin et al., 2019) found that the Ga-modified H5 with high dispersion of Ga species and the resulted Lewis acidity could enhance the BTEX yield in co-aromatization of furanic and ethylene. Xin et al. (Xin et al., 2019) showed the high selectivity of BTEX over Ga-modified H5 due to the increased strong Lewis acidic sites and mesopore volumes in the n-heptane catalytic aromatization process. Su et al. (Su et al., 2019) studied the synergic effect of GaO+/Brønsted acid in Ga/Al-H5, which exhibited higher BTX selectivity via dehydrogenation during the 1-hexene aromatization processes. In addition, Ga/H5 was investigated in propane dehydrogenation, which could be activated followed by a monomolecular elimination of H2 and desorption of propene (Schreiber et al., 2018). The Ga anchored on H5 could effectively enhance the yield of aromatics through the decarbonylation and olefin aromatization during catalytic fast pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass (Cheng et al., 2012). One-pot synthesis bifunctional Ga/H5 exhibited an excellent catalytic application for converting propane to aromatics due to the synergistic effect of the appropriate acidic properties and meso/macroporous, which improved the accessibility of intermediates into active sites (Wannapakdee et al., 2016). Most recently, Hsieh et al. (Hsieh et al., 2018) found that the extra-framework Ga-substituted H5 showed the dehydrogenative nature in methanol aromatization correlated to a contact synergy with the dual-cycle mechanism of the extra-framework Ga species and the Brønsted acid. An appropriate content of SiO2 on the external surface of Ga/H5 could alleviate the external strong Brønsted acid sites, which could depress the side reaction and increase BTX yield in propane dehydroaromatization (Xu et al., 2021). Cai et al. (Cai et al., 2020) found that the Mo-Ga/H5 could activate the hydrotreating-derived CH4 and facilitate the alkene intermediates into aromatic hydrocarbons because of the better synergistic effect of Mo species, Ga2O3 and acidic sites in bio-oil hydrotreating-cracking reactions. With the addition of a small amount of Ga on H5, the hierarchical macro-meso-microporosity Ga2O3/H5 exhibited a high yield (87.6%) of light olefins and aromatics in catalytic conversion of n-butane due to the synergistic effect between the dehydrogenation and aromatization properties of Ga2O3 and the cracking function of H5 (Han et al., 2016). Although, the Ga/H5 catalysts had been used widely in the aromatization processes, the effects of the status, location, and properties of Ga and Al in H5 on the structure-performance relationship were still unclear. Collectively, the appropriate acidity and porosity of Ga/H5 accounted for the increased aromatization ability.
On account of the similar properties of Ga comparison with Al, the manuscript mainly provided a method to regulate and control the texture properties of HZSM-5 by Ga substitution to obtain higher light aromatics during lignite pyrolysis process. We synthesized a series of xGa/H5 to explore the highly efficient catalysts for the production of BTEXN with different methods and investigat the relationship between the structure and catalytic performance. Some characterization technics including XRD, 27Al MAS NMR, BET, NH3-TPD, Py-IR, SEM, TEM and ICP-OES were used to investigate the relationship between physicochemical properties and catalytic activity in catalytic reforming process.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Prepared of coal samples
The Shengli lignite (SL) was derived from Xilinhot, Inner Mongolia, China. The obtained sample was crushed and sieved to 0.5–1.0 mm, subsequently dried completely at 105 °C for 10 h before each experiment. The proximate and ultimate analyses of SL have been reported in our previous work (Yang et al., 2021).
2.2. Prepared of modified Ga/Al HZSM-5
The Ga-substituted H5 were synthesized with a hydrothermal method as follows. Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 25 wt%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), sodium metaaluminate (NaAlO2) and Gallium nitrate hydrate were mixed in deionized water, subsequently stirred for 1 h at room temperature, and then tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) was added to the mixture under vigorous stirring for 2 h at ambient temperature with a molar composition of SiO2:0.011 Al2O3:0.009/0 Na2O:0.15 TPAOH:30 H2O:x Ga(NO3)3 (x = 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05.; 0.009/0 is 0.009 or 0). Subsequently, the suspension was transferred directly to a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and crystallized at 160 °C for 72 h, the obtained product was subsequently subjected to wash until pH = 7 and calcined at 550 °C for 10 h to remove template and impurities. H-form zeolite could be obtained by ion-exchange with 1 M NH4Cl labeled as xGa/H5 (A) (x = 0–1.88 g). The xGa/H5 (B) catalysts were synthesized by using the same method except no NaOH was added in the crystallization. I-Ga/H5 (A) catalysts was prepared by using impregnation method.
A series of characterization technics (XRD, SEM, SEM-EDX, TEM, NH3-TPD, 27Al MAS NMR and BET) were used to evaluate the catalyst performance during the catalytic reforming of lignite pyrolysis volatiles reaction. The detailed characterization methods were described in the Supplementary Material.
2.3. Experimental equipment and process
The catalytic reforming process was conducted in a quartz tube (ID 1.1 cm, height 36 cm) in which the quartz wool was used to separate the catalysts and lignite. A gas feed system with Ar (105 mL min−1) was connected with the apparatus. The pyrolysis device was heated to 600 °C from room temperature at 15 °C/min. The approximately 3 g catalysts (height 1.6 cm, particles 0.5–1.0 cm) were dehydrated for 15 min at 600 °C before each experiment. 2.0 g SL sample (particles 0.5–1.0 cm) fell into the reactor with a rate of 0.1 g/min. The gas hourly space velocity was maintained around 3600 h−1 depending on the height of used catalyst, room temperature and the flow rate of carrier gas. After finishing the experiment, the device was held at 600 °C for another 20 min to ensure no substantial gas release. The pyrolysis volatiles flew into a bunch of cold traps with methanol in a cooling system and the uncondensable gases were collected with a gas bag for analysis with Shimadzu GC-2014 gas chromatograph. The calculation formula of BTEXN and gas yield was provided in Supplementary material. Repeated experiments were performed at least twice to guarantee the reliability of the results.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. XRD analysis
As displayed in Fig. 1a, a series of typical MFI framework diffraction peaks were clearly exhibited on all xGa/H5 (A), suggesting that the high crystallized xGa/H5 (A) were successfully synthesized with low content Ga clusters during the crystallization process. The Ga2O3 peaks were not observed obviously due to the high dispersion of Ga species on H5. Compared with H5 (A), a slight downward shifting was presented over xGa/H5 (A) (In Fig. 1b) through a close inspection of peaks from 2θ = 22.5° to 24.0°, which was attributed to the replacement of smaller Al cations by the larger Ga cations in the crystalline structure according to Bragg’s law (Hsieh et al., 2018). In addition, we prepared I-Ga/H5 (A) catalysts and observed an upward shifting around 2θ = 23.2°, which confirmed that the Ga species of xGa/H5 (A) were introduced into the skeleton structure. A coincidence conclusion was observed from the Ga 2p3/2 XPS spectra (In Fig. S1) that the binding energy of 1.26 Ga/H5 (A) and I-Ga/H5 (A) were located at 1119.0 eV and 1118.1 eV, respectively, and the reason was that the state of Ga in the framework was quite different from the extra-framework on the surface of zeolites (Xiao et al., 2015). Similarly, the typical MFI framework diffraction peaks were also observed in xGa/H5 (B) as shown in Fig. S2. Compared with xGa/H5 (A), the similar XRD patterns of xGa/H5 (B) implied that the introduction of Ga species was highly dispersed throughout the zeolites. Additionally, the low crystallinity of xGa/H5 (B) was consistent with the SEM images (In Fig. 3) which might be derived from the lack of NaOH during the crystallization process, and the framework Al species sites were occupied by the incorporated Ga species connected with Si to result in the formation of skeleton defect sites (Su et al., 2019).

3.2. 27Al MAS NMR analysis
The 27Al MAS NMR spectra of xGa/H5 (A) were showed in Fig. 2. Clearly, the strong signal at around 55 ppm appeared in all xGa/H5 (A) catalysts, which were corresponding to the tetrahedral coordination of Al (Abbasizadeh and Karimzadeh, 2018). Besides, a weak peak appeared at approximately 0 ppm belonging to the octahedral coordinated extra-framework Al. The same scenarios were also observed in H5 (A), indicating that most of Al species were located in the zeolite framework (Abbasizadeh and Karimzadeh, 2018). An appropriate amount of Ga species could be inserted easily into the framework and regulated the next-nearest neighbor framework Al sites location to result in dealumination during calcination; and increase the intensity of octahedral Al at 0 ppm (Xin et al., 2019). However, the intensity at 0 ppm was almost unchanged due to the low addition amount of Ga species (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the ratio of tetrahedral coordinated framework aluminum and octahedral coordinated extra-framework aluminum caused by Ga was associated with the catalytic performance of xGa/H5 (A). The synergistic effect of the framework Ga species and the Brønsted acid on the surface of xGa/H5 (A) could increase the olefin yield, further accelerating the aromatization process to produce more aromatics (Schreiber et al., 2018, Gao et al., 2018).

3.3. SEM analysis
The SEM and TEM images of xGa/H5 (A) with different Ga loadings were displayed in Fig. 3. The individual crystals were consisted of uniform nanoparticles of approximately 600–800 nm. However, the situ isomorphous substitution of Ga into the zeolite framework could reduce the crystal size slightly during the nucleation process resulted from the Ga species could orient the zeolitic growth (Su et al., 2016, Xin et al., 2019). Observed from the TEM images, there was no darker contrast close to the exterior surface for xGa/H5 (A) catalysts, implying that the Ga species were finely dispersed on the support surface (Hsieh et al., 2018). In strong contrast to xGa/H5 (A) catalysts, the xGa/H5 (B) samples exhibited applanate crystals in a range of approximately 400–500 nm with low crystallinity, which was attributed to the weaker alkaline condition in the crystallization process (In Fig. S3). Additionally, the elemental mapping of Ga indicating that the Ga species homogeneously dispersed on the external surface of zeolitic framework in Fig. 4

3.4. Acidity analysis
The Py-IR spectra of xGa/H5 (A) and xGa/H5 (B) at 350 °C were depicted in Fig. S4, and the acidity distributions were given in Table 1. Compared with H5, the Brønsted acidity and Lewis acidity of 1.26 Ga/H5 (A) increased significantly, suggesting the doping of Ga atoms into the framework of H5 generated strong Lewis acid sites because of the lower electronegativity of Ga (Altwasser et al., 2004, de O. Rodrigues et al., 2010). In addition, the extra-framework Ga species was also favorable for the production of the Lewis acid sites, which could effectively accelerate the dehydrogenation activity for generating olefins and further formed aromatics (Xin et al., 2019, Ni et al., 2021). Generally, metal-modified ZSM-5 with a low B/L ratio has a better aromatization performance due to the combinational effect of enhanced dehydrogenation by Lewis acidity of metal ions and suppressed cracking by the relatively reduced Brønsted acidity of proton sites (Hsieh et al., 2018). Overall, both Brønsted acidity and Lewis acidity played a vital role on the catalytic performance for improving the yield of BTEXN.

Catalyst BAS (mmol/g) LAS (mmol/g) Total acid (mmol/g) B/L ratio
H5 (A) 0.08 0.01 0.09 8.0
1.26 Ga/H5 (A) 0.12 0.02 0.14 6.0
1.68 Ga/H5 (A) 0.10 0.03 0.13 3.3

0.94 Ga/H5 (B) 0.10 0.02 0.12 5.0
1.26 Ga/H5 (B) 0.14 0.02 0.16 7.0
To evaluate the changes of acidity influenced by the introduction of Ga species, the NH3-TPD patterns of xGa/H5 (A) and R-1.26 Ga/H5 (A) (recyclable R-1.26 Ga/H5 (A)) were displayed in Fig. 5, and the acidity distribution of two types of acids was calculated via peak fitting listed in Table 2. Typically, the strong and weak acid concentrations of 1.26 Ga/H5 (A) were higher than that of H5 (A), which was possibly attributed to the appropriate substitution of Ga species in the zeolite framework. Moreover, the extra-framework Ga species were beneficial for the escalation of weak acid sites (Xin et al., 2019). In contrast to H5 (A), the weak acid of xGa/H5 (A) catalysts shifted to a lower temperature, implying that the weak acid strength of xGa/H5 (A) was weaker than that of H5 (A) due to the lower electronegativity of Ga comparison with Al (Su et al., 2016). In addition, the NH3-TPD patterns and acid distribution of xGa/H5 (B) were displayed in Fig. S5 and Table S1. Compared with H5 (B), the weak acid and strong acid of xGa/H5 (B) increased obviously, which was ascribed to the formation of stronger active sites by the Ga-substituted H5. Taken together above results, the sharp disparity of acid between xGa/H5 (A) and H5 (A) was stemmed from the doping of Ga atom into the framework caused by the lower electronegativity of the Ga3+ (Xin et al., 2019). Additionally, as listed in Table 2, the Al and Ga contents in catalysts were lower to ensure the stability of framework.

3.5. Textural properties of xGa/H5
The textural properties of xGa/H5 (A) and xGa/H5 (B) zeolites were listed in Table 3 and Table S2, respectively. The N2 sorption isotherms of xGa/H5 (A) and xGa/H5 (B) zeolites were identified as types IV or I isotherms because of the filled micropore (Fig. S6 (a-b)). Compared with H5 (A) zeolite, the micropore surface area and average pore diameter of xGa/H5 (A) increased to some extent. When the Ga atoms were doped into the framework of zeolite, the bond length of Ga-O was longer than that of Al-O bond, which was responsible for the increase of microporosity (Su et al., 2019). Besides, the increased mesoporosity (48 m2/g) and pore diameter (3.2 nm) of 1.26 Ga/H5 (A) was attributed to the generation of additional intercrystal pores formed by the accumulation of small nanocrystals, which could facilitate the intermediates easily catalyzed by the active sites (Su et al., 2016, Xin et al., 2019). Regeneration of R-1.26 Ga/H5 (A) at higher tempeature largely recovered the original surface area and porosity by removing most of the coke deposits. SBET of parent and used catalyst showed a narrow range of 397 and 408 m2/g, and the higher SBET of used catalyst may attribute to the collapse at 600 °C (Heracleous et al., 2019). The pore size distributions of xGa/H5 (A) zeolites were exhibited in Fig. 6. All samples showed a wide mesoporous distribution between 3 and 6 nm based on intracrystal mesopores, which was consistent with TEM images (Fig. 3). Additionally, the aggregation of nano-sized crystallites also leaded to the intergranular mesopores (Zhang et al., 2013). In contrast to xGa/H5 (A) zeolites, the pore size distribution of xGa/H5 (B) samples mainly centered at 3–10 nm as displayed in Fig. S7, suggesting that the pores were typically aggregated by smaller nano-sized zeolite with low crystallinity provided new intergranular mesopores.

3.6. Product yields
As displayed in Fig. 7, the total yield of aromatic products increased with the amount of Ga increased from 0 to 1.26 g. Obviously, the highest aromatics yield of 29.3 mg/g was obtained over 1.26 Ga/H5 (A), which was unequivocally higher than that of the H5 (A) and CZ5 (commercial ZSM-5). It was worth noting that when the Ga amount was over 1.26, the total yield of aromatics decreased gradually, which was ascribed to the excess loss of Al caused by more Ga species replaced Al position (Park et al., 2010). Meanwhile, the acid sites of 1.26 Ga/H5 (A) were higher than other xGaH5 (A) (Table 2), which was favorable to aromatization for higher BTEXN yield. Additionally, compared with H5 (A), the B yield of 1.26 Ga/H5 (A) significantly increased from 7.68 mg/g to 15.58 mg/g. The synergism between Brønsted acid sites and framework/extra-framework Ga sites could facilitate the initial C-H bond activation and recombination of hydride ions to form molecular hydrogen, or the decomposition of alkyl intermediates bound (Bhan and Delgass, 2008). On the other hand, the [GaH]2+ could be formed by the protonation of the Ga+ influenced by the adjacent Brønsted acid sites, and the Lewis acid of oxidation state Ga3+ was stronger than that of Ga+, further to promote the aromatization process (Schreiber et al., 2018). However, the alkylbenzene yield hardly changed with the Ga content increased because the olefin mainly took part in the C6-cyclic to form benzene under the synergy effect of Ga/H5 rather than alkylbenzene. The developed micro/mesoporosity and the acidic sites of active skeleton atoms of zeolite provided plentiful accessible active sites for aromatization and dehydrogenation. Based on these results, the xGa/H5 (A) catalysts with appropriate doping of Ga exhibited exceptional catalytic performance for hoisting the yield of BTEXN.

Fig. 8 presented the yield distribution of BTEXN over xGa/H5 (B) catalysts. Compared with xGa/H5 (A), the xGa/H5 (B) zeolites exhibited a lower performance for the yield of BTEXN. Besides, the xGa/H5 (B) catalysts exhibited the same tendency as xGa/H5 (A), namely, the yield of BTEXN increased first and then decreased with the amount of Ga increased. Among these xGa/H5 (B) catalysts, the 1.26 Ga/H5 (B) displayed the highest BTEXN yield of 24.9 mg/g. The relatively lower BTEXN yield over xGa/H5 (B) catalysts might be attributed to the inadequate strong active sites of zeolite resulted from the low crystallinity in the crystallization process. In addition, the highest SBET of 1.26 Ga/H5 (B) provided adequate reaction place for aromatization (Table. S2).

Fig. 8. The yield of BTEXN over xGa/H5.
The gas yield over xGa/H5 (A) catalysts was outlined in Table 4. The higher yield of CO and CO2 were mainly formed during the deoxygenation and decarbonylation of pyrolysis vapors. Besides, compared with H5 (A), the H2 yield over 0.94 Ga/H5 (A) increased from 1.37 mg/g to 2.22 mg/g due to the dehydrogenation process which was facilitated over the active sites. The lower yield of olefins was attributed to the aromatization and oligomerization, namely the olefins were converted to cyclic olefinic compounds during the Diels-Alder reaction and subsequently undergone further dehydrogenation process to produce mononuclear aromatics (Cheng et al., 2012, Jin et al., 2021). Meanwhile, the synergistic effect of GaO+ and Brønsted acid sites of H5 could facilitate the deoxidation and oligomerization reaction to convert the phenols into aromatics (Veses et al., 2015).

The material balance of the pyrolysis system was presented in Fig. 9. CZ5 exhibited the highest gas yield and lowest liquid yield indicated that partial pyrolysis vapors were preserved as uncondensable gases, meanwhile, some radicals and olefins undergo a series of aromatization reactions called Diels-Alder reaction to convert into aromatics (Nicolaou et al., 2002). Compared with H5 (A), the gas yield of 0.94 Ga/H5 (A) decreased from 14.7% to 12.6% while the liquid yield increased from 18.1% to 20.2%, indicating that the pyrolysis vapors were preserved as aromatics especially light hydrocarbons. It was similar to xGa/H5 (A) catalysts, the xGa/H5 (B) zeolites also exhibited good performance that the liquid yield of 0.94 Ga/H5 (B) increased from 20.1% (H5 (B)) to 22.9%, whereas the content of light aromatic was less. The undesired coke was inevitably formed in catalytic cracking of pyrolysis vapors over acid catalysts (H5) (Shao et al., 2014). Compared with H5 (A), the xGa/H5 (A) catalysts exhibited higher coke yield due to the increased acid content.

Fig. 9. The product yields over different catalysts.
The stability of 1.26 Ga/H5 (A) was investigated during the catalytic reforming of lignite pyrolysis volatiles process, and the yield distribution of BTEXN was displayed in Fig. 10. Owing to the dealumination (evolving of water) of 1.26 Ga/H5 (A) occurred in the long time reaction and regeneration process (Kosinov et al., 2017), the total BTEXN yield decreased slightly, but it still maintained approximately 26 mg/g during the 6 times experiments. Especially, the yield of toluene kept almost unchanged (6.8 mg/g), which was attributed to the aromatization over 1.26 Ga/H5 (A) with adequate acidic sites supplied by the accessible active sites of Ga and Al. The high stability 1.26 Ga/H5 (A) exhibited good catalytic performance because of the active skeleton atom. The acid distribution over the spent catalyst decreased slightly due to the loss of active skeleton atom (Ga and Al) under oxidative conditions at high temperature (WARD, 1968). The induced irreversible deactivation of 1.26 Ga/H5 (A) trigged the relatively lower catalytic activity during the reductive regeneration to remove coke (Han et al., 2019). The synergistic effect between the metal and acidity was suppressed in recycle experiments, resulting in a decreasing trend of monocyclic aromatics.

4. Conclusions
Incorporated Ga species into H5 (A) framework could effectively regulate the acidity distribution caused by the spatial proximity GaO+ species and Al location. The well dispersed Ga species in 1.26 Ga/H5 (A) catalyst exhibited the highest BTEXN yield of 29.3 mg/g during reforming of lignite pyrolysis volatiles due to the synergistic effect between Ga species and acid sites of H5, especially, the yield of benzene significantly increased from 7.68 mg/g to 15.58 mg/g in comparison with H5 (A). Besides, the 1.26 Ga/H5 (A) showed excellent stability during the 6 times experiments with the total yield of BTEXN maintained at approximately 26 mg/g, which might be ascribed to the stable active skeleton Ga atoms rather than Ga2O3 by impregnation during long-term evaluation. The promising results provided a facile approach to regulate the Al location of zeolite by the addition of Ga species for high BTEXN yield during the catalytic upgrading lignite volatiles.
