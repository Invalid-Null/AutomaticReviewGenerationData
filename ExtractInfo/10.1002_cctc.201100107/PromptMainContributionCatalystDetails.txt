High-Temperature Produced Catalytic Sites Selective for n-Alkane Dehydrogenation in Acid Zeolites: The Case of HZSM-5
Graphical Abstract
Enhancing n-alkane dehydrogenation: Heating HZSM-5 zeolites in the absence of water leads to the dehydroxylation of Brønsted-acid sites and the formation of new (nonacidic) sites that are very selective for propane dehydrogenation. The new sites formed catalyze the dehydrogenation of propane at rates comparable to the rates shown by HZSM-5 prior to thermal treatment.
Abstract
The effect of high-temperature treatment on the catalytic activity and selectivity of two HZSM5 samples has been investigated by using propane activation as the test reaction. The samples have been characterized by using X-ray powder diffraction, nitrogen adsorption, FTIR spectroscopy, and ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (TPD). Before high-temperature treatment, the samples have activation energies and selectivity toward propane cracking versus dehydrogenation comparable with similar samples reported in the literature. After high-temperature treatment (825 °C in N2), the sample’s microporous and crystalline structure remains nearly intact, but a clear decrease in the number of Brønsted-acid sites is detected by using FTIR and ammonia TPD. Despite the decrease (≈70 %), the rate of reaction is about the same before and after heating. The selectivity toward dehydrogenation, however, increases by at least a factor of 2, whereas the activation energy for dehydrogenation decreases considerably. This is evidence that new catalytic sites are formed upon dehydroxylation. By using naphthalene as a probe molecule, it is shown that the new sites have the ability to form stable radical cations out of the neutral naphthalene, which suggests that the new sites activate propane by a redox mechanism. The kinetic isotope effect on the rate of dehydrogenation is also consistent with a redox process. The effect of heating in an oxygen atmosphere at lower temperatures was also investigated and only minor effects on reaction rates and selectivity were observed. Naphthalene adsorption experiments on oxygen-treated samples, however, produce more radical cations than on the samples treated at high temperatures, a result that does not correlate with the dehydrogenation activity of oxygen-treated samples.
Introduction
Zeolites are microporous crystalline materials formed of four-coordinated alumina [AlO4]− and silica [SiO4] tetrahedra. In their acid form, the negative charge on alumina tetrahedra is compensated by a proton (H+) that forms a bridging hydroxyl group (SiOHAl) or a Brønsted-acid site (BAS). The acid form of zeolites has been widely used in the petroleum industry in a number of hydrocarbon conversion processes.1 The BAS can donate a proton to an adsorbed species that forms carbonium- and carbenium-like moieties that are, respectively, transition states in monomolecular and bimolecular alkane cracking reactions.2 The active sites in zeolites, however, can be altered during catalyst activation processes or through postsynthesis treatments, such as dealumination by steaming, dealumination by aqueous acid treatments, or dehydroxylation of BAS at a high temperature. Lewis acid sites are commonly formed after these treatments.3 These sites have proven difficult to characterize, and their molecular structure is still debated vigorously. Three-coordinated aluminum units have been often proposed as the source of Lewis acidity,4 but other nonframework aluminum moieties, such as AlO+, Al(OH)2+, Al(OH)2+, Al(OH)3, and Al2O3, have also been proposed to be true Lewis acids.5 The effect of Lewis sites on the catalytic activity and selectivity has been investigated, which reveals that cracking and dehydrogenation turnover rates do not correlate with the Lewis acid site concentration.6 Instead, Lewis acid sites enhance the adsorption7 of reactants and hence increase the rate of reaction. These studies agree that Lewis acid sites do not activate alkanes by themselves.
The activation of small alkanes over acid zeolites has been investigated extensively because of its relevance to technologically important processes such as fluidized catalytic cracking in petroleum refineries, but also because CH and CC bond activation is of fundamental scientific interest.6, 8 Alkane activation can proceed through bimolecular pathways that generally involve hydride transfer between an alkane and an adsorbed carbenium ion. These processes are rate determining at high hydrocarbon concentrations and at low temperatures when the concentration of surface species is high. Relative to bimolecular cracking reactions, monomolecular alkane activation has a high activation energy and is the dominant channel of alkane activation at temperatures in excess of 500 °C, low alkane pressures, and low conversion.9 Much progress has recently been reported on propane, n-butane, and isobutane cracking over acid zeolites, in which, for instance, the observed selectivity toward dehydrogenation versus CC bond scission can now be understood in terms of the entropy of formation of the transition state.10 Disagreement remains, however, as to discrepancies between laboratories on the selectivity of CH versus CC bond activation for seemingly similar catalysts.10a, 11 In this report we suggest that different degrees of dehydroxylation of BAS between samples pretreated at different temperatures could be the origin of these observed differences in selectivity. We show that high-temperature treatments generate new sites that favor dehydrogenation over propane cracking (Scheme 1). We also suggest that BAS dehydroxylation forms sites that favor electron-transfer processes. We confirm that these sites can extract electrons from molecules such as naphthalene, which forms stable radical cations. This phenomenon has been reported before, but it has not been linked to the catalytic activity of zeolites for alkane activation.

The results are divided into three sections. In the first section, zeolites are characterized before and after high-temperature treatments to show that, apart from dehydroxylation, the structure of the zeolite remains essentially unchanged. In the following section, the catalytic activity of samples heated at 430 °C under nitrogen (treatment 1, base case scenario corresponding to the reactivity of the classical BAS), samples thermally dehydroxylated at 825 °C under nitrogen (treatment 2), and samples heated at 550 °C in diluted oxygen (treatment 3) is discussed. The results are presented for two samples of HZSM-5 that contain a Si/Al of 18 and 12.5, respectively. Finally, the reactivity of the dehydroxylated samples is correlated with the formation of stable naphthalene radical cations upon adsorption of naphthalene on dehydroxylated and oxygen-treated samples.
Results and Discussion
Sample characterization
The XRD patterns for both samples shown in Figure 1 reveal that the as-synthesized materials have the ZSM-5 structure and are highly crystalline. After heating the samples to 825 °C, the structure is preserved with some decrease in crystallinity as can be observed by the reduction in intensity of several reflections, such as (011) and (051). However, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of these reflections broadens only slightly after dehydroxylation. For example, the FWHM of the (051) reflection for ZSM-5(12) increases by 15 % (2 θ from 0.239 to 0.276°) after dehydroxylation. The HZSM-5(18) sample is initially highly crystalline and shows a slightly higher reduction in coherence length after dehydroxylation as determined by the FWHM of selected reflections. Nonetheless, both samples are highly crystalline after the high-temperature treatment, and there is no evidence of amorphous material or other structural damage other than slightly broader XRD peaks.

The N2 adsorption isotherms of all the samples are representative of the type I isotherm for microporous materials (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). The micropore volumes calculated by the t-plot method have a typical value of 0.14 cm3 g−1 for ZSM-5 for the samples that are heated at 550 °C (Table 1).12 Degassing at 350 °C under vacuum did not decompose all the ammonium cations as can be seen by the relatively low micropore volumes especially for HZSM-5(18). The micropore volume decreases by 13 and 9 % for HZSM-5(18) and HZSM-5(12), respectively, after heating to 825 °C. Such reductions in crystallinity (XRD) and in micropore volume are expected because heating the sample at a high temperature (825 °C) will cause a significant portion of BAS to decompose and, consequently, a fraction of framework aluminum to move to extra-framework position, which reduces the effective micropore volume.

Shown in Figure 2 are the FTIR spectra for dehydrated HZSM-5(12) and HZSM-5(18). The samples have exclusively BAS and silanol vibrations after heating at 500 °C. New small peaks appear at =3666 and 3725 cm−1 after heating to 820 °C, but the most prominent change is a decrease in the intensity of the BAS stretching vibration. This is evidence of the dehydroxylation of most (but not all) of the BAS during the high-temperature treatment. The peak at =3666 cm−1 is assigned to aluminum in partially extra-framework positions. The assignment of the peak at =3725 cm−1 is not clear. It has been assigned to extra-framework aluminum,13 to extra-lattice amorphous materials,4a, 14 and to silanol groups.15 It has a very weak acid character. The structures of these sites have not been determined, but aluminum in a three-coordination environment is often proposed as the origin of the peak at =3666 cm−1.16 CO adsorption studies have revealed that the peak at =3666 cm−1 is less acidic than the normal BAS and more acidic than silanol groups.16

The ammonia temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) for HZSM-5(18) is reported in Figure 3 (a similar trend is observed for HZSM-5(12); see Figure S2 in the Supporting Information). Note that the area under the TPD trace is reproduced when the sample is heated to 550 °C, as can be observed in the first two measurements (black and dark gray curves). Treatment 1, then, does not change the number or character of the acid sites in either of the two samples. In addition, during heating the sample to 820 °C (dark gray), the signal of the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) increased slightly in the temperature range of 750–820 °C, a result clearly related to the zeolite dehydroxylation process and not to ammonia desorption. The area under the light gray TPD trace is much lower than in the other two traces, due to the reduction of BAS during dehydroxylation and the formation of noninteracting sites with ammonia. Dehydroxylation of BAS can proceed by dehydration and dehydrogenation channels.17 The dehydration channel generates a Lewis acid (three-coordinated Al) and a tetrahedral framework Al that has a negative charge. The former site should adsorb ammonia, whereas the latter should not because it is basic.

The oxygen treatment (treatment 3) also does not change the number or character of sites (data not shown), and the TPD traces are identical before and after the treatment. Even though ammonia TPD is a good technique to determine the number of acidic sites, it cannot discriminate between different acidic sites. Therefore, the area under the curve is a combination of the contribution of all possibly formed sites during dehydroxylation plus any BAS left intact after heating. Note that in agreement with the IR results, this TPD trace indicates that most BAS have been transformed into structures that interact only weakly with ammonia.
Effect of sample treatment on propane conversion and selectivity
The zeolite samples were purposely prepared by using an organic-free route to avoid any heating of the catalysts prior to catalytic testing. Figure 4 shows the product distribution of the propane reaction over HZSM-5(18) and HZSM-5(12) as a function of temperature before and after dehydroxylation. For treatment 1 (430 °C in nitrogen), the cracking-to-dehydrogenation ratio is initially around 3 and decreases slightly with temperature to approximately 2.5 (Table 2).

The dehydroxylated samples (treatment 2) show a more complex reactivity pattern; there is evidence for the formation of two types of catalytic sites, distinct from the Brønsted acids sites, as revealed by the temperature and selectivity of the propane reaction. The first type of site catalyzes, at the low temperature of 415 °C, primarily the propane dehydrogenation (see the insets in Figure 4). These sites deactivate slowly at 415 °C and rapidly at 460 °C (data not shown). Note that the samples prepared by using treatments 1 and 3 show no propane reactivity at 415 °C at weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 6.8 h−1. After complete deactivation at 415 °C, an increase in temperature to 430 °C shows no further reactivity for this site. A second type of site is observed in the dehydroxylated samples having a reactivity and stability comparable to that of the BAS after treatment 1, but a very different selectivity. The dehydrogenation rate becomes more significant compared to the rate before dehydroxylation. The cracking-to-dehydrogenation ratio is now approximately 1 for both samples and is only weakly dependent on temperature (Table 2).
The oxygen treatment (treatment 3) alters the product distribution slightly, especially for HZSM-5(18), by increasing dehydrogenation, but otherwise similar temperature dependence to treatment 1 is observed.
The propane conversion on both samples for the three treatments is shown in Figure 5. The conversion of HZSM-5(12) is higher than the conversion of HZSM-5(18) for the sample activated at 430 °C (treatment 1) because there are more BAS in HZSM-5(12). The samples dehydroxylated at 825 °C show a remarkable conversion, considering that most BAS have been dehydroxylated. The conversion is slightly higher in HZSM-5(18) and slightly lower in HZSM-5(12) as compared with the conversion before heating. The conversion after oxygen treatment (treatment 3) increases for both samples, and the difference becomes increasingly clear at high temperatures.

Information about the active sites can be inferred from the calculated apparent activation energy. The rate-determining step is a unimolecular decomposition of propane for both reaction channels, and the Arrhenius parameters are estimated assuming first-order kinetics (Figure 6). Recall that HZSM-5 has 12 topologically distinct tetrahedral sites, and treatments 2 and 3 generate sites that are distinct from the original BAS. Thus, at best, Ea,app and kapp must be considered effective values and interpreted as such. The Ea,app for cracking is 184 and 168 kJ mol−1 (Table 3) for HZSM-5(18) and HZMS-5(12), respectively, slightly higher, but comparable with equivalent values in previous reports (142–158 kJ mol−1).6 The activation energy for cracking HZSM-5(18) is affected by oxygen treatment, showing a drop by 20 kJ mol−1, whereas the activation energy for cracking HZSM-5(12) changes only by a few kilojoules per mole. After oxygen treatment, the activation energies fall within the values typically reported for alkane activation in H-ZSM-5 zeolites. In fact, nearly all reports first treat zeolite samples in an oxygen atmosphere prior to catalytic testing in alkane activation processes:6, 9 this may be the reason for the difference between the activation energies of the samples studied here after treatment 1 and the values reported in the literature. Initially, the dehydrogenation activation energy for both samples is similar (180 kJ mol−1), and oxygen treatment has no effect on this value. Unlike cracking, there is a wide variation in the reported dehydrogenation activation energy (95–200 kJ mol−1),6, 9 and it is, therefore, difficult to compare our results to the reports of other laboratories. The cracking and dehydrogenation activation energies for the dehydroxylated samples decrease noticeably, especially for HZSM-5(12), and in fact the activation energy for dehydrogenation becomes less than that for cracking for both zeolites (see Table 3). This is inconsistent with alkane activation by a protolytic mechanism in which the cracking energy barrier is less than the dehydrogenation energy barrier.18 A dehydrogenation activation energy lower by 60 kJ mol−1 compared to that of cracking has been reported, but the rate-limiting step was assumed to be propene desorption, not protolytic dehydrogenation.9 In our case, the dehydroxylated samples must provide a new reaction path for propane activation to lower the high dehydrogenation energy barrier initially required to stabilize the protonated CH bond.

[a] Ea,app for cracking is ±4 kJ mol−1 and for dehydrogenation ±10 kJ mol−1.
The preexponential factors also decrease after dehydroxylation (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). The reduction of the pre-exponential factor could indicate that the active site density is reduced or the entropy of activation is reduced (or a combination of both effects). Ammonia TPD after treatments 1, 2, and 3 shows that treatments 1 and 3 do not change the number or character of the acid sites; that is, the TPD traces are nearly identical before and after each treatment. On the other hand, treatment 2 leads to a decrease in the number of the acid sites by 32 and 45 % for HZSM-5(18) and HZSM-5(13), respectively, as determined by the area beneath the TPD traces in Figure 3. The decomposition of BAS generates sites that have some ability to interact with ammonia, but it appears that the binding energy of adsorption for the new sites is lower than that of the BAS because the temperature at the maximum desorption rate is reduced by approximately 20 °C after treatment 2. Therefore, the preexponential factor is reduced, at least in part, due to the reduction in the number of active sites.
A Constable plot between the activation energy and the natural log of the preexponential factors for these samples and treatments shows that they are linearly related (Figure S3). That is, the drop in activation energy is compensated by a drop in the preexponential factor. Bokhoven et al.7 found that the presence of Lewis acid sites can lead to such a compensation effect. In this case, the intrinsic kinetic parameter should be very similar, but have different apparent activity, owing to the enhancement in the surface coverage. To evaluate this hypothesis, we calculated the Gibbs free energy of the formation of the activated complex and determined that the Gibbs free energy of the intrinsic activity for treatments 1 and 3 is the same (see Table 4), which satisfies the isokinetic conditions.19 The intrinsic entropy of the transition state for the protolytic mechanism is loose, in agreement with the recent report by Gounder and Iglesia for ZSM-5.6

[a] Errors are ±4 kJ mol−1 for cracking and ±10 kJ mol−1 for hydrogenation. Na/Al was determined by Galbraith laboratories and was 0.01 and less than 0.01 for ZSM-5(18) and ZSM-5(12), respectively. The enthalpy and entropy of adsorption of propane in ZSM-5 are 46 kJ mol−1 and 102 J mol−1 K, respectively.33
Extending this calculation to treatment 2 is not possible because dehydroxylation leads to nonacidic active sites (not evaluated from ammonia TPD measurement, owing to the nonspecific nature of the ammonia interaction). However, to eliminate the possibility that the activity of the dehydroxylated samples is not from the protolytic pathways, the preexponential factor is rescaled to the remaining number of BAS (as determined from the IR data shown in Figure 1) to calculate the Gibbs free energy of the transition state. The Gibbs free energy of the formation of the transition state for the dehydroxylated samples calculated this way is lower than the Gibbs free energy for the other two treatments; that is, it is not isokinetic (Table 4). This result confirms that the reaction over the dehydroxylated samples proceeds via reaction channels that are different from the typical BAS chemistry.
Propane reactions over samples activated by treatment 1 are predominantly controlled by the protolytic reaction mechanism, because this treatment is not severe enough to induce major changes in BAS concentration or structure. The samples have primarily BAS and silanol groups at 500 °C as deduced from the IR spectra (Figure 2) of the samples. The product distribution is also consistent with activation by BAS because the activation energy for dehydrogenation is higher than that for cracking.18 After oxygen treatment (treatment 3), the product distribution changes slightly and conversion is enhanced. It has been observed that the BAS stretching vibration intensity decreases and broadens when the samples are treated with oxygen.20 Carbon monoxide adsorption studies on samples activated under oxygen21 also provide evidence for the presence of Lewis acid sites. Because the isokinetic conditions are satisfied by this treatment when compared with treatment 1, the propane reaction is still controlled mainly by protolytic pathways and the increase in the conversion could be attributed to the presence of Lewis acid sites, which enhance the effective activity of the BAS22 or enhance the adsorption.3, 7 In this case, the surface coverage increases and consequently the reaction rate increases too.3 The small change in product distribution cannot, however, be explained by Lewis acid sites, because the product distribution is independent of the Lewis acid sites, which assumes that these sites affect only the adsorption step.
After treatment 2, the IR spectra of the dehydroxylated samples show that the BAS density decreases by approximately 70 and approximately 80 % (Figure 2) for HZSM-5(18) and HZSM-5(12), respectively, while the propane conversion increases in HZSM-5(18) and decreases in HZSM-5(12). To maintain such activity after losing a large fraction of BAS, new active sites must be formed by the dehydroxylation treatment. The new active sites cannot be just Lewis acid sites, because steaming the sample (a typical method for generating Lewis acid sites in H-zeolites) leads to a major reduction in the activity, a reduction not observed here.22 The difference in product distribution clearly shows that the active sites are definitely different from BAS. The highly active sites formed after BAS dehydroxylation (see the insets in Figure 4) are attributed to Lewis acid sites, in agreement with the report by Narbeshuber and coworkers.23 The Lewis acid site in this case is different from the Lewis acid generated from the oxygen treatment. The deactivation mechanism for this site is not understood, but it could be attributed to a structural change or to strong adsorption of some intermediates that slowly build up with time. Deactivation by structural change was observed24 when purposely prepared extra-framework gallium (GaO+) is transformed into Ga+ during the dehydrogenation of propane. The former active site is more active than the latter active site. The transformation is proposed to proceed via the dehydration pathway, and water instead of hydrogen associated with propene is produced during the deactivation.
The BAS can dehydroxylate following a heterolytic pathway (forming water and Lewis acid sites) or a homolytic pathway17 [forming hydrogen and leaving a single-occupied molecular orbital (hole) on the framework oxygen atoms]. Nash et al.17 found that the dehydroxylation pathways depended on the composition of the zeolite. At low silica-to-alumina ratio, there is a better chance that dehydroxylation will occur by dehydration because acid sites are closer to each other. This observation could explain the difference between HZSM-5(18) and HZSM-5(12) in the BAS IR intensity after dehydroxylation at 825 °C (Figure 2). Bugaev et al.4b have studied the dehydroxylation of H-mordenite and established that 90–95 % of the framework aluminum remained in a symmetric tetrahedral coordination environment after significant dehydroxylation at high temperatures. The remaining Al has a three-coordination environment. We also studied the gallium coordination of Ga-substituted zeolites (Ga-Beta and Ga-ZSM-5) after complete dehydroxylation by using K-edge extended X-ray absorption fine structure methods and found that a significant fraction of gallium also had a symmetrical tetrahedral structure.25 Considering the effect of the activation methods (treatments 2 and 3) on the zeolite, both methods can, in principle, generate a common site that is a single electron-deficient site and a potential redox site.17, 26 The electron-deficient sites are located on one of the oxygen atoms that surround the framework aluminum atom, but could be delocalized.13 These sites can be responsible for the variations in the kinetic parameters and in the product distribution observed here and should lead to a reaction mechanism different from the protolytic mechanism.
To test for the presence of the redox sites experimentally, the samples can be exposed to naphthalene, a molecule with a relatively low ionization potential (IP), and then the formation of radical species can be monitored using UV/Vis spectroscopy as reported by Moissette et al.13 (Figure 7). The naphthalene radical cation is formed only after oxygen treatment and after dehydroxylation. No reactions are observed when the sample is activated under argon at 500 °C or on silicalite-1 after activation at 500 and 780 °C under argon. The lack of reactivity means that the naphthalene radical cation does not form on ZSM-5 by reactions with BAS or external or internal silanol groups. It also shows that aluminum and BAS need to be present in the sample before treatment.13 The key observation, though, is that the concentration of the radical cations is clearly higher on the oxygen-treated sample than on the sample dehydroxylated at 825 °C. Thus, this result suggests that the changes in selectivity for propane activation in HZSM-5 may be due to redox sites, but at the same time indicates that not all redox sites are capable of activating propane because selectivity is similar for treatment 1 and treatment 3 samples. The broadband from λ=550 to 400 nm in the spectra of Figure 7 is related to unpaired electron–hole and electron traps in the zeolites.13 This band is different between treatments 2 and 3, a difference that could be related to the structural difference between sites generated from dehydroxylation versus oxygen treatment. The structure and composition of the sites needed to generate radical cations have been debated27 vigorously and have been attributed to Lewis acid, redox sites, and BAS. Evidence that indicates that the radical cations are formed by single-electron redox sites had been reported.28 Our measurements suggest that naphthalene radical cations are formed by redox sites in the dehydroxylated samples. After oxygen treatment, it is possible that Lewis acid sites are responsible for the formation of naphthalene radical cations, because the propane product distribution does not change significantly even though the corresponding radical cations’ concentration is high. It has been recognized before that oxygen treatment enhances radical cation formation,15, 16 but because oxygen treatment shows very little effect on the propane reaction over zeolites, we can only conclude that these sites do not have the ability to extract electrons from propane. We noticed that the concentration of naphthalene radicals formed after oxygen treatment in HZSM-5 (18) is higher than that in HZSM-5(12) (Figures 7 and S4), which confirms that the HZSM-5(18) sample is more susceptible to oxygen treatment as observed in the catalytic results.

The redox sites in zeolites have the ability to oxidize molecules that have a high IP, such as ethylene (IP=10.5 eV) and methanol (IP=10.85 eV).29 The IP of propane is 10.95 eV,30 and therefore the reaction of propane over the dehydroxylated samples could certainly proceed by radical cation chemistry. To confirm this point, deuterium-labeled propane (C3D8) was used to measure the kinetic isotope effect on zeolites before and after dehydroxylation. After heating at 430 °C in N2, the steady-state relative rates (r/r) of cracking and dehydrogenation are 1.41 and 1.13, respectively. These values are similar to the ones reported for perdeuterated n-butane cracking on HZSM-5.23 After dehydroxylation, the relative rate of cracking (r/r)cr is approximately 1.07, which indicates that the cleavage of the CC bond is not affected by the deuterium label, whereas the relative rate of dehydrogenation (r/r)de is approximately 3.5. This large difference is consistent with radical cation chemistry, but not with protolytic chemistry.23 Recent theoretical analysis of propane radical cation decomposition30 has shown that the product distribution depends on the internal energy excess on the propane ion after electron removal. At very low internal energy, excess dehydrogenation controls decomposition, but at increased energy, excess cracking predominates the decomposition of propane radical cations. Therefore, the propane activation over redox sites starts with electron abstraction from propane to form propane radical cations that will decompose to products. A possible mechanism for the catalytic cycle is depicted in Scheme S1 in the Supporting Information. Also note that radical chemistry has been previously proposed as the mechanism for the cracking of isobutene31 and n-butane.32
Conclusions
It is clear from the results presented here that typical zeolite catalyst pretreatments can have a major effect on catalytic rates and selectivity of zeolites for hydrocarbon conversion. Two types of Lewis acid sites have been generated from BAS decomposition after high-temperature treatment and after oxygen treatment. The first site is very selective toward dehydrogenation, but deactivates quickly. The second site, generated from oxygen treatment, enhances the conversion especially at high temperature by increasing the surface coverage of propane. The structures of these sites are unknown. CO adsorption studies on dehydroxylated ZSM-5 samples have also revealed the presence of two Lewis acid sites with CO absorption peaks at =2221 and 2230 cm−1.16 Redox sites are also generated from treatment 2 as determined by the formation of the naphthalene radical cation on adsorption of naphthalene. The kinetic isotope effects observed between propane and perdeuterated propane are consistent with radical cation reaction mechanisms, and, therefore, these redox sites can be responsible for this radical cation chemistry. In fluidized catalytic cracking, the product distribution may be influenced by sites similar to the ones observed in this report after treatment 2. In fact, the contribution of these two sites may be more important than BAS because the BAS has a very short life under typical reaction conditions in a fluidized catalytic cracking unit.
Experimental Section
Zeolite synthesis
Both zeolites samples were prepared in the absence of an organic structure-directing agent according to the following batch composition: 9.5 Na2O:4 Al2O3:100 SiO2:3000 H2O and 12 Na2O:2.86 Al2O3:100 SiO2:3000 H2O. Ludox AS-40 and sodium aluminate are the silica source and aluminum source, respectively. The mixtures were heated to 190 °C for 40 h under rotation in a Teflon-lined Parr autoclave. The product was filtered, washed with deionized water, and dried at room temperature. The samples were exchanged twice in a 0.1 M NH4NO3 solution at 80 °C to prepare the ammonium form of the zeolite. The zeolite samples [HZSM-5(18) and HZSM-5(12)] were characterized by using XRD, nitrogen physisorption, IR spectroscopy, and ammonia TPD before and after dehydroxylation.
Analytical instruments
The XRD patterns were measured by using CuKα radiation and a Philips X′Pert diffractometer with a He point detector. The nitrogen adsorption isotherms were obtained by using a Micromeritics 2010 instrument at 77 K. The samples in the ammonium form were first degassed at 350 °C for 1 day by using an in-house-built quartz tube that handles high temperatures. The measurements were also performed after heating the same sample at 550 and 825 °C under vacuum for 7 h (ramping rate of 5 °C min−1). After completing the N2 adsorption measurements, these same samples were analyzed by using XRD and compared with the as-synthesized form.
Ammonia TPD measurements were performed by using an Altamira Instrument AMI-200iρ equipped with a quartz U-tube reactor. For each sample, three TPD measurements were taken sequentially to investigate the change in active sites after each treatment. An amount of approximately 30 mg of catalyst was used and dehydrated at 200 °C for 2 h under He flow (He was also used as a carrier gas) before the TPD measurement was performed. The first TPD measurement was performed on the ammonium form of the zeolite (before dehydroxylation) by heating to 550 °C with a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1. To restore the sample to the ammonium form, the sample was cooled to 100 °C and exposed to NH3 flow of 20 sccm min−1 for 30 min. The sample temperature was then increased to 200 °C to remove weakly adsorbed ammonia. The second TPD trace was recorded through the dehydroxylation of the sample, in which the sample was heated to 820 °C by using a ramping rate of 5 °C min−1. Again, the ammonium form was restored using the same steps as before. The third TPD measurement was recorded to quantify the effect of dehydroxylation on the number of active sites. The sample was also heated to 550 °C at a rate of 5 °C min−1. To study the effect of the oxygen treatment, the sample was exposed to oxygen flow of 30 sccm min−1 at 550 °C for 30 min and then exposed to NH3 as described above. The TPD results after oxygen treatment are compared with those for the original samples before oxygen treatment.
The FTIR spectra were collected by using a Nicolet Nexus 470 FTIR equipped with a ZnSe beam splitter and an MCT-A detector having a usable energy range from =4000 to 650 cm−1. The measurements were performed in a vacuum chamber sample cell equipped with CaF2 windows, which reduced the usable energy range from =4000 to 1100 cm−1. The spectra were an average of 100 scans measured at 4 cm−1 resolution. The samples in the ammonium form (≈25 mg) were pressed into self-supporting wafers of 13 mm in diameter. The wafer was then heated stepwise at multiple temperatures (500 and 820 °C) in vacuum prior to measuring the IR spectra at room temperature.
Adsorption and UV/Vis spectroscopy of naphthalene on HZSM-5
In a separate system, a weighed amount of the ammonium-exchanged form of the zeolite was heated in a quartz tube reactor (ID=19 mm) by using a radiant heater (Omega Engineering). The sample was dehydrated at 200 °C in an inert (Ar) atmosphere for 2 h and then heated again at 450 °C for 4 h to form the acid zeolite. Three different treatments were performed on each sample. In the first case, the sample was heated at 500 °C under argon flow; in the second case, the sample was heated at 780 °C under argon flow; and in the third case, the sample was heated at 500 °C under oxygen flow. After the sample was cooled down to room temperature in an inert atmosphere, a weighed amount of naphthalene (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.7 %) corresponding to 1 molecule per unit cell of the zeolite was mixed with the sample in a glove bag (Glove Bag™ Inflatable Glove Chambers) filled with dry argon. The samples quickly changed color (blue to bluish-green). The UV/Vis spectra of the zeolite–naphthalene mixture were analyzed by using UV/Visible spectroscopy (Jasco V-550) with a diffusive-reflectance cell.
Catalysis
Kinetic measurements of propane were performed in a plug flow reactor (ID=4 mm) with a bed supported by fine quartz ship. The ammonium form of ZSM-5 (70 mg) was loaded in the reactor and activated in situ at 430 °C under N2 (99.999 %) flow of 100 sccm (treatment 1, base case), at 825 °C under N2 flow of 100 sccm (treatment 2), and at 550 °C under 3 % oxygen diluted in helium flow of 140 sccm (treatment 3). A new catalyst was used for each treatment. The temperature measured at the catalyst bed was varied from 410 to 530 °C. The flow rate of propane (tri-Matheson gas, research grade) was fixed so that the WHSV equaled 6.8 h−1 with a mole percent of 5 % diluted in N2. The reaction rates were measured under differential conditions where the conversion is kept low (<2 %). The products were analyzed by using the Shimadzu GC model 2014 having two columns: a molsieve connected to a thermal conductivity detector for hydrogen and N2 and RT-alumina connected to a flame ionization detector for hydrocarbon analysis. The kinetic isotopic effect experiment (98 % C3D8 from Cambridge isotopes) was performed by using the same system.
Kinetic analysis of the propane reaction over HZSM-5
Scheme 1 illustrates the rate-limiting steps in the propane activation reaction: unimolecular cracking of the CC bond and dehydrogenation of the CH bond. Therefore, the rates of reaction for cracking and dehydrogenation are similar and can be expressed by Equation (1). The only difference is the rate constant of the rate-limiting step. At low partial pressure and conversion, most of the sites are vacant, and the rate expression can be simplified to a first-order rate equation [Eq. (2)]. The intrinsic activation energy and entropy are given by Equations (3) and (4). From transition state theory, the intrinsic rate constant6 can be expressed in terms of transition state enthalpy and entropy as written in Equation (5). The measured entropy of formation of the transition state is scaled by the number of CH and CC bonds: 2 for cracking and 8 for dehydrogenation [Eq. (6)].

The product distribution for the protolytic monomolecular reaction mechanism is a function of only the rate constants (selectivity=k3cr/k3de). In this case, the selectivity can be expressed in terms of the differences in free energy of the transition state enthalpy and entropy [Eq. (7)]. The presence of Lewis acid sites will affect the adsorption properties7 (enthalpy and entropy of adsorption), but will not affect the selectivity because such effects will cancel out.
((7))
The activation energy and entropy were calculated using Equation (2) by fitting the data obtained at 450 to 530 °C. The flow rate was set so that the conversion was limited to approximately 2 % (maximum) to ensure that only monomolecular reactions occurred, which is confirmed by the stoichometric ratio of methane to ethene for cracking and of hydrogen to propene for dehydrogenation.
