The given document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. It examines high-temperature produced catalytic sites selective for n-alkane dehydrogenation in acid zeolites, focusing on the case of HZSM-5. While propane is used as a probe molecule to study alkane dehydrogenation activity, the document does not present a catalyst optimized for propane dehydrogenation.
