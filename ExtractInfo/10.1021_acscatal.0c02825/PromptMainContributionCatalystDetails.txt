Highly Active Nanosized Anatase TiO2–x Oxide Catalysts In Situ Formed through Reduction and Ostwald Ripening Processes for Propane Dehydrogenation

Abstract
The research and development of abundant, non-toxic, low cost, and high-performance catalysts are urgently required for the production of propylene through propane dehydrogenation (PDH) reaction. Here, the pure TiO2 nanoparticles, obtained through in situ reduction, exhibit excellent catalytic PDH performance. At 600 °C, the initial propane conversion could reach 67%, and the one-pass yield of propylene was 45%. The propane conversion was 21% at 550 °C, and propene selectivity could reach as high as 94%. According to ex/in situ characterization results and Quantum chemical calculations, the dynamic formation and reaction mechanism of active sites were detailedly investigated. The reductive propane and its derivatives can react with surface lattice oxygen of nanosized anatase TiO2 to form oxygen vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated Ti cations (Ticus), which can catalyze PDH with high propene selectivity; the rate of C3H6 formation is in line with the surface oxygen vacancy concentration. Notably, the Ostwald ripening of nanosized TiO2 with high surface energy is crucial to the formation of oxygen vacancies. The agglomeration of nanosized TiO2 at high temperature makes the lattice oxygen atoms mobile and active, which are consumed abruptly and then form oxygen vacancies and Ticus more easily. It is denoted as “mutation reduction”. The surface oxygen vacancy concentration is also influenced by the oxygen migration rate from bulk to surface driven by thermal energy and potential energy (the differences of concentration).

ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propylene is one of key basic feedstock for the manufacture of various products such as polymers, solvents, dyes, resins, fibers, and drugs. (1,2) Because of the growing demand for propylene and the huge reserves of shale gas and natural gas, in which propane is one of the main components, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) becomes an increasingly important technology for the production of propylene. For the main commercial catalysts (supported PtSn and CrOx catalysts) of PDH, the Pt is high cost and Cr6+ is highly toxic, effective measures must be taken to avoid harm to human body and environment in the production, use, and treatment of catalysts, which force researchers to find new catalysts. (3)
Recently, a variety of earth-abundant transition-metal oxides (TMOs) have been found to exhibit PDH catalytic activity, such as the opened cobalt(III) coordination site dispersed on a Zr-based metal–organic framework (MOF) NU-1000, (4,5) isolated ligand-free FeII species on silica, (6) coordinatively unsaturated silica-supported single-site Zn(II), (7,8) tetrahedrally coordinated Co2+ ions chemisorbed into the trisiloxane rings, (9) mononuclear Ga sites, (10−12) V3+ ion on alumina support with surface-bound hydroxyl groups, (13−16) oligomeric Sn2+ on mesoporous silica, (17,18) and coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations. (19,20) One common point of the above oxide catalysts is that their active sites are coordinatively unsaturated under reaction conditions, which would try to attain saturation by binding with the PDH intermediate species that results in the decreasing activation energy of the C–H bond. (3)
The defective TiO2–x nanomaterials with abundant Ticus and oxygen vacancies, such as “Black TiO2–x”, are widely applied in the areas of photocatalysis, photoelectrochemical sensor, lithium-ion rechargeable battery, supercapacitor, microwave absorption, and so on (21−24) but seldom used as PDH catalysts. Recently, the possible Ticus site on the defective TiO2 is proposed as active sites for PDH reaction. (25) However, for the unstable TiO2 catalyst under a high temperature and reducible atmosphere (C3H8 and its derivative), the in situ formation process and dynamic change of surface active sites during PDH reaction are still ambiguous.
Herein, the different nanosized anatase TiO2 particles from facile commercial fabrication are directly used as PDH catalysts with excellent performance. As the reduced surface are easily reoxidized in an ambient atmosphere, a series of surface chemical reaction experiments and in situ Raman characterizations were conducted to investigate the evolution of a TiO2 catalyst, including the consumption of lattice oxygen, the formation of oxygen vacancy, surface hydrogenation, and distortion. The quantum chemical calculations results suggest that the surface Ti3+cus–O Lewis acid–base pairs close to oxygen vacancy are the active sites and facilitate C–H bond activation, especially for the second C–H bond cleavage to form C3H6.
Notably, the nanosized TiO2 possesses a large surface-to-volume ratio; (26,27) as thermal catalysts, the nanoparticles usually suffer from agglomeration, crystal transformation, and atom rearrangement during the Ostwald ripening process. (28−30) Meanwhile, the reduction of oxides is also related to Metal–O bond breaking and distorting, (31−33) and the effect of the Ostwald ripening process on the reduction process of TiO2 is still ambiguous under high temperature PDH reaction conditions. Here, a systematic work, focusing on the effects of consumption, migration, and rearrangement of lattice oxygen on the formation and concentration of oxygen vacancy, is reported.

2.1. Catalyst Preparation
The 5–10, 10–25, 25, 40, 60, and 100 nm anatase TiO2 samples were commercially available (99.8%, Aladdin reagent (Shanghai) co. LTD) and used without further purification. The spent TiO2 samples were obtained through PDH reaction at 600 °C after different reaction times (t = 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5 h), and then cooled to room temperature at an Ar atmosphere. According to the reaction time, the spent TiO2 samples were denoted as xh-TiO2 (x = 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5 h).
2.2. Catalyst Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the studied catalysts were recorded on a Panalytical Empyrean power diffraction system (Cu Kα radiation, 40 kV, 30 mA) in the 2θ interval of 5–90° for wide angle analysis in 0.02° steps. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 electron microscope. The morphology was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (ZEISS Gemini SEM 300, accelerating voltage 5 kV). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were recorded on a PerkinElmer PHI-1600 ESCA spectrometer using MgKa (hv = 1253.6 eV, 1 eV = 1.603 × 10–19 J) X-ray source. The binding energies were calibrated using the C 1s peak of contaminant carbon (BE = 284.6 eV) as an internal standard. Measurements of UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS) were performed on a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Hitachi UH4150) with the integration sphere diffuse reflectance attachment. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) was measured by BRUKER ELEXSYS-II (E 500, ν = 9.85 GHz). The solid-state 1H MAS NMR measurements were performed on an AVANCEIII/400WB spectrometer at a resonance frequency of 499.86 MHz using a 3.2 mm MAS NMR probe with a sample spinning rate of 15 kHz. In order to suppress the 1H background signals arising from the probe head and rotor caps, spectra were recorded using a DEPTH one pulse sequence. All the samples were pretreated through heating to 90 °C under vacuum for weakening the influence of surface H2O. The textural properties were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption at −196 °C through a Quantachrome automatic analyzer. The samples were outgassed at 350 °C for 4 h before the measurements. The Raman spectra were determined using a high-resolution Raman spectrometer system (Renishaw inVia Reflex) equipped with 532 nm laser excitations. For the in situ/operando Raman spectra, the samples were mounted in an in situ cell at desired temperatures and gas flows. The in situ Raman spectra were obtained under O2 and Ar gas flows at 600 °C after 1 h. The operando Raman spectra were obtained under C3H8/Ar (the mole ratio 1:39) gas flows at 550 °C for 5 h and 600 °C after 1 h. The H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), O2 temperature-programmed oxidation (O2-TPO), C3H8 temperature-programmed surface reaction (C3H8-TPSR), C3H8 temperature-programmed desorption (C3H8-TPD), and O2 pulse experiments were performed on a Micromeritics AutoChem 2920 apparatus with mass detector (HIDEN analytical). The detailed experimental processes are described in the Supporting Informations.
2.3. Catalytic Tests
The catalytic tests for PDH were performed at 1 bar between 500 °C and 600 °C using a continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz tubular reactor. 0.1–3 g catalysts and feeds containing 2.5 or 33.3 vol % C3H8 in inert gas were used. The schematic of the reactor system is shown in Figure S1. The C3H8 and the reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (SP-3420) equipped with an HP-PLOT/Q (for CH4, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, and C3H8), TDX-01 (for CO and CO2) columns, and flame ionization detector; CO and CO2 are converted into CH4 by hydrogenation in a nickel reformer and then detected by a hydrogen flame ionization detector. The propane conversion (ConvC3H8), selectivity of products (Si), yield of products (Yi), space time yield of products (STYi), and rate of C3H6 formation (r(C3H6)) were determined from eqs 1–6:

where i represents the hydrocarbon products in the effluent gas, ni is the number of carbon atoms of the component i, Fi (ml·min–1) is the corresponding flow rate, and mi is the catalysts mass. The calculation of coke selectivity is based on the C mass balance between the raw gas (C3H8) and the reaction products (C3H8, C3H6, C2H6, C2H4, CH4, CO, CO2, and coke). Scoke (%) = 1 – ∑Si, Si refers to the selectivity of C3H6, C2H6, C2H4, CH4, CO, and CO2. (19,34,35)
2.4. DFT Calculations
All the calculations were based on periodic density functional theory and Vienna ab initio simulation program package (VASP 5.3.3). (36,37) The spin-polarized calculations were carried out using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the exchange correlation energy of interacting electrons were determined by the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional. (38) The TiO2(101) surface was the most stable and easily exposed surface of the anatase TiO2 sample. We chose a 3 × 3 supercell with 4 atomic layers as the calculation slab and the vacuum was 20 Å. For structural optimizations, all atoms could relax except the bottom layer atoms. The cutoff energy was set to 400 eV. Calculations were finished until the total energy was converged to 10–4 eV and the convergence criterion of force was less than 0.05 eV Å–1. A 1 × 1 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack K-points were used to sample the Brillouin zone. 3d electrons are not localized as the experiments assert, so GGA cannot reproduce the electronic and magnetic properties of TiO2(101) surfaces. We used Hubbard U correction in our calculations to prevent the delocalization of 3d electrons of Ti (3d24s2). The effective U–J value was 4.2 eV, J = 1 eV. (39,40) The transition states were searched using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method, and each transition state was reconfirmed with only one imaginary frequency. (41)
The adsorption energy (Eads) of molecules with the TiO2(101) surface is defined as:
where ETiO2(101) is the energy of the pure TiO2(101) surface and Emolecule is the energy of the molecule (C3H8 or H) alone. Emolecule + TiO2(101) is the total energy of the molecule adsorbed on the TiO2(101) surface. The optimization of molecules such as propane was computed by placing molecules in a 20 Å-wide cubic cell.
Vacancy formation energy is defined as the following formula:
Evac is the energy of the surface slab with an O3c vacancy. Es – TiO2(101) and Ed – TiO2(101) represent the energy of the stoichiometric surface and reduced surface, respectively. EH2O is the energy of an isolated H2O molecule computed by placing in a 20 Å-wide cubic cell. EH2 is the energy of an isolated H2 molecule computed in the same way.

3.1. Catalytic Performance
The catalytic performance of the 10–25 nm anatase TiO2 sample for PDH against time on stream at 600 °C is shown in Figure 1. Here, we found that the 10–25 nm anatase TiO2 nanomaterials can catalyze the PDH reaction, the highest C3H6 yield was 35%. The propane conversion increased in the induction period (initial 1 h), and then it gradually decreased. Meanwhile, the coke selectivity maintained about 12% after 1 h reaction time and then decreased along with the decreasing of C3H8 conversion (Figure 1b). It demonstrates that one reason of the slow deactivation is the coke formation. It is worth noting that CO is always present (CO selectivity was above 2%) during the whole non-oxidative PDH process. The only possible oxygen resource is the lattice oxygen of TiO2, which are consumed by the C3H8 or its derivative to form CO. The lack of lattice oxygen easily leads to the formation of Ticus. (42,43) According to Kondratenko’s research, (19,20) coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations in ZrO2 are responsible for C–H bond activation. Similarly, we suggest that the consumption of lattice oxygen leads to the formation of oxygen vacancies and Ticus sites, as active sites for PDH, which result in the increase of C3H8 conversion in the induction period.

To further verify the relationship between the oxygen vacancies and the catalytic activation, O2 as an oxidizing agent was introduced into the reactant gas to inhibit the in situ reduction of TiO2 for the generation of oxygen vacancies and Ticus. The partial pressures of propane (PC3H8) and oxygen (PO2) were varied to observe the changes of product distributions (Figure 2). The propene selectivity increased from 5% up to 96% with the decrease in the ratio of PO2/PC3H8 from 2 to 0, while the selectivity of COx (CO and CO2) had an opposite varying trend and finally decreased to 1%, which shows that the absence of O2 is beneficial for the selective formation of C3H6. It demonstrates that the formation of oxygen vacancies on TiO2 catalyst is crucial for PDH with high C3H6 selectivity.

The in situ reduction process of TiO2 during PDH reaction was investigated through C3H8 TPSR over the fresh and spent TiO2 samples, and the corresponding results are shown in Figure 3a,b, respectively. To exclude the physical and chemical adsorbed oxygen species of the TiO2 surface, samples were purged by Ar flow at 600 °C. For the fresh TiO2 sample, the formation of oxygen-containing compounds (H2O, CO, CO2) illustrates the consumption of lattice oxygen above 400 °C. However, no H2O and only little COx were observed for the spent TiO2 sample, indicating that the spent TiO2–x was basically stable after the induction period of in situ PDH reaction. So, most of oxygen vacancies and Ticus can be formed in the induction period. It was worth noting that H2 was released below 388 °C (the temperature of PDH reaction beginning) for the spent TiO2 sample in Figure 3b, illustrating that there are dissociable H species binding with TiO2–x. The binding and dissociation abilities of TiO2–x for H species are beneficial to the activation of the C–H bond and the formation of H2 in the PDH process.

Profiles of H2 (black line, m/e 2), H2O (red line, m/e 18), CO + CO2 (blue line, m/e 12), CH4 (green line, m/e 15), C2H6 (mazarine line, m/e 30), C3H6 (purple line, m/e 42), and C3H8 (brown line, m/e 43) during C3H8-TPSR over the fresh 10–25 nm TiO2 (a) and spent 10–25 nm TiO2 (b) nanosized samples.
Reaction parameters, such as temperature and weight hourly space velocity (WHSV), were varied to investigate the catalytic performance and reaction path on the reduced TiO2–x surface. Under non-oxidative conditions (Figure 4), the initial C3H8 conversion and C3H6 yield are in line with temperature and WHSV, up to the highest value as 67 and 45%, respectively. As shown in Figure 4 and Figure S2, with the increasing of C3H8 conversion, C3H6 selectivity decreased, while coke selectivity increased (no obvious changes for the other products). It indicates that the formation of coke via over-dehydrogenation is the main side reaction of PDH, and the low temperature could inhibit the coke formation. Under a reaction condition with relatively high concentration of C3H8 (C3H8:N2 = 1:2), the initial STY(C3H6) were 0.17 and 0.44 kg·h–1·kg–1, at 550 °C and 600 °C, respectively, which are comparable to some of the state-of-the-art oxide catalysts in Table S1, including Cr-, Ga-, V-, Zn-, and Sn-based catalysts. The performance of our TiO2 catalysts is still inferior to the highly active yet expensive Pt-based catalysts, and further improvements could be expected for this new catalyst system.

(b) Initial propene selectivity, propene yield, and coke selectivity plotted as a function of initial C3H8 conversion over nanosized TiO2 samples (T = 600 °C, 0.25–3 g 10–25 nm TiO2 catalysts, total flow of 10–30 mL/min, C3H8:Ar = 1:39).
To reduce the influence of coke, the evaluation of the catalytic performance of the 10–25 nm TiO2 catalyst was carried out at 550 °C for a relative long reaction time and the results are shown in Figure 5a and Figure S2c. Notably, initial propene selectivity increased dramatically to 94% after the induction period and propane conversion was 21%. The C3H8 conversion dropped to 15% after 24 h. Under this reaction condition, the coke selectivity was low and can be neglected (Figure S2a). Meanwhile, the TiO2–x was reduced continuously during the whole PDH reaction time as the COx always existed in the products. We consider that the slow deactivation is also probably due to the over-reduction of TiO2–x. To verify the assumption, the reduction degree of the 10–25 nm TiO2 sample was controlled by different CO pre-reduction times at 550 °C. The C3H6 formation rates (r(C3H6)), including initial r(C3H6) and final r(C3H6), increased at first and then decreased with CO reduction time (Figure 5b). So, the formation of Ticus and oxygen vacancies by appropriate reduction is beneficial to PDH performance, but the over-reduction would destroy effective active sites of PDH. (22) For the high concentration C3H8 (33.3% vol C3H8 in N2), the 10–25 nm TiO2 catalyst showed rapid deactivation within 1 h at 600 °C. At 550 °C, although the initial C3H6 yield was lower, TiO2 catalyst showed relatively good stability without deactivation within 2 h (Figure S2e). It further illustrates that lowering the temperature and concentration of C3H8 is a viable and effective way to inhibit over-reduction and coke deposition.

(b) Initial r(C3H6) at 20 min reaction time and the final r(C3H6) at 200 min reaction time for the 10–25 nm TiO2 catalyst with different CO reduction times, reaction conditions: T = 550 °C, 0.2 g 10–25 nm TiO2 catalysts, total flow of 10 mL/min, C3H8:Ar = 1:39.
With the introduction of H2 in C3H8 feed gases, the initial propane conversions decreased from 28.4 to 20.6%, suggesting competitive adsorption of H2 and C3H8 on the catalyst surface. After 170 min in the C3H8 + H2 stream, the propane conversion remained at 15% with 92% selectivity for propylene (Figure S2f), affording a lower deactivation constant of 0.14 h–1 compared with the case without H2 in the feed gas stream (0.56 h–1). Here, the deactivation constant (h–1) = [ln() – ln()]/t, where ConFinal and ConInitial are the final and initial conversions of the PDH reaction, respectively, and t is the duration of a PDH reaction in hours. Meanwhile, as shown in Figure S2g, the introduction of hydrogen reduced the selectivity and yield of coke, suggesting that the hydrogenation of TiO2–x inhibits the reaction between surface C precursors, or hydrogen hydrogenates coke precursors.
3.2. The Surface Structure of Oxygen Vacancies and Ticus
3.2.1. Comparative Characterizations of the Catalysts before and after PDH Reaction
It is surprising that the nanosized anatase TiO2, a material generally used as carriers or auxiliary in PDH catalysts, (44) has been proved to be an efficient catalyst for the PDH reaction here. To better understand the intrinsic active site structure, a series of systematical characterizations for the fresh and spent TiO2 samples with different reaction times were conducted.
To investigate the morphologies and nanosize change before and after the PDH reaction, SEM and TEM images of the fresh TiO2 and spent 5 h TiO2 were taken and results revealed somewhat agglomeration among nanoparticles (Figure S3). Furthermore, as shown in the HR-TEM images (Figure 6), the fresh TiO2 sample was highly crystallized as the well-resolved lattice features. The surface amorphous phase of the spent TiO2 sample would be the coke or disordered outerlayer shell of TiO2–x. According to Samuel’s research, (22) the reduced TiO2–x through hydrogen thermal treatment showed disorder in surface layers, known as “Black TiO2”. (21) As shown in Figure S4, the physical adsorption of CO on the spent 5 h TiO2 illustrates that the surface active sites are accessible and not covered completely by coke.
Figure 6
Figure 6. HR-TEM images of the fresh and spent TiO2 samples after 5 h reaction time.
As shown in Figure S5, with the increase of reaction time, the 10–25 nm TiO2 nanomaterials turned from white to black and induced stronger light absorption. The Raman peaks at 151, 409, 515, and 633 cm–1 (Figure S6a), which are assigned to the Eg, B1g, A1g or B1g, and Eg modes of the anatase phase, (45) became weak and broad with reaction time. The above phenomena are probably caused by crystal structure disorder of the reduced “Black TiO2–x” or/and the coke formation during PDH reaction.
To minimize the effect of coke and focus on the structure changes of the TiO2 sample, the Raman spectra of the spent 5 h TiO2 were enlarged compared with the fresh TiO2 (Figure 7ab), the Eg Raman peak position shifted from 143 to 145 cm–1, and two new weak peaks emerged at 350 and 450 cm–1, which still could not be assigned to any type of anatase and rutile Raman-active modes. Additional small vibrational modes and scattering peaks shifted to higher wavenumbers were also observed in the other surface-reducing anatase TiO2 nanoparticles. (22,46) Notably, as shown in locally amplified XRD patterns (Figure 7c,d), the 101 and 200 diffraction peaks of 5 h TiO2 shifted to the higher diffraction angles compared with the fresh TiO2 sample, suggesting that the interplanar distance decreases, which is due to the formation of oxygen vacancies after PDH reaction. It is well consistent with the previous literature reports (47,48) that anatase TiO2 under reduction conditions causes a significant decrease in the lattice parameter.
Figure 7
Figure 7. Raman spectra (a, b) and XRD patterns (c, d) of the fresh and spent 5 h TiO2 samples. (The Raman peak intensity of 5 h TiO2 was enlarged.)
The EPR spectra of TiO2 samples are shown in Figure 8a, which are widely used to examine unpaired spins. All the samples showed an oxygen vacancy signal (g = 2.002). (49) However, only the Ar-pretreated and spent 10–25 nm xh-TiO2 samples showed signals corresponding to Ti3+ with [gxx gyy gzz] = [1.991 1.974 1.939], (50) indicating that the formation of Ti3+ is related to the consumption of lattice oxygen on the high temperature inert or reducible atmosphere. According to our calculation results in section 3.3, for the stoichiometric TiO2(101) surface, forming a three-coordinated O vacancy will generate three Ticus cations and two extra electrons, which will distribute on two adjacent Ticus cations. Thus, two adjacent coordinatively unsaturated Ti4+ cations are reduced to Ti3+ cations after accepting electrons.

The solid-state 1H MAS NMR measurements were further conducted to examine the H species in TiO2 (Figure 8b). The peaks at 6.2, 3.8, and 1.3 ppm are probably associated with three distinct H2O species in the outer, the intermediate, and the inner parts of the water layers adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, respectively. (51) Additionally, according to previous research, (50,52) the H2-reduced TiO2 showed some sharp peaks near δ ≈ 0 ppm, which could be attributed to the presence of interstitial hydrogen, Ti–H, or the special H species with a high dynamic exchange between hydrogen in different environments. The peaks at 1.3 ppm became more broad and downshifted to the 0 ppm direction with reaction time, possibly indicating that more H species bond or insert into the spent TiO2–x surface/subsurface with oxygen vacancies. It is consistent with the above C3H8-TPSR results, and some H species dissociate from the spent TiO2 at a low temperature. Furthermore, as shown in H2-TPR measurements (Figure S7), the pretreatment with He at 600 °C excludes surface-adsorbed oxygen species and the possibility of H2O formation from the surface OH group below 600 °C. So, the H2O MS signal indicated that lattice oxygen reacts with H2 to form H2O. Moreover, the H2O formation MS signal and H2 consumption MS signal are not matched. Especially, in the temperature range of 300–400 °C, the extra H2 consumption could attribute to H2 splitting and the adsorption of H species on the TiO2–x surface. The above results illustrate that the reduced TiO2 with abundant oxygen vacancies can bind and release H species as the transfer station.
The O2-TPO results further demonstrated that the surface reduction degree and the coke amount of the spent xh-TiO2 increased with time on stream (Figure 9). The TCD signals of total gas products were classified by H2O and COx MS signals. The onset and peak temperature of H2O MS signal shifted to a lower temperature with reaction time, indicating that more active surface binding H species reacted with O2 to form H2O. However, the peak at 362 °C tailed to higher temperature and their intensities increased with reaction time, illustrating the diversity and complexity of surface hydrogen species. The COx MS peak of the spent xh-TiO2 samples shifted to a higher temperature, and their intensity increased with reaction time, which proved that the amount of coke on the TiO2 surface increases and the degree of graphitization increases. It is consistent with the Raman spectroscopic characterization results of coke, as shown in Figure S6b. The peak centered at 1600 cm–1 is ascribed to the G band, accounting for the stretching vibration of the C═C sp2 bond in the graphite lattice. The band observed at 1370 cm–1 is assigned to the D band, which corresponds to microcrystals or the edges of the graphite lattice with low symmetry. (53,54) The intensities of the two Raman spectra peaks increased with reaction time.

The spent TiO2 crystal structures and coordination environment were determined by XRD and XPS analyses. No matter before and after PDH reaction, TiO2 showed only one type of diffraction peaks corresponding to well-crystallized anatase (Figure S8). In comparison with XRD for bulk characterization, XPS is a surface probe technique with the information depth of 1–2 nm (Figure S9a,b). All the fresh and spent TiO2 samples showed one major peak centering at 530.0 eV, mainly due to the O2– ions in the TiO2 lattice, in the O 1s core-level XPS spectra. All the samples showed similar features of Ti4+ ions in the TiO2 lattice based on the almost identical Ti 2p XPS spectra with peaks centering at 458.7 and 464.4 eV due to the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, respectively. This demonstrates that most of the surface of the spent TiO2 maintained or recovered anatase crystal basically in an ambient atmosphere. As shown in Figure S9c, the detection of the O2 consumption amount for reduced TiO2–x at 60 °C demonstrated that the reduced TiO2–x can be partially oxidized in an ambient atmosphere. It is consistent with the DFT calculation results, and the O2 adsorption energies on O2c or O3c vacancy defective surfaces were −2.61 and −3.56 eV, respectively (Figure S10), which means that the surface oxygen vacancies were easily filled by oxygen species. The above conclusions further illustrate that the reduced TiO2–x was not stable and partially oxidized during ex situ characterization exposed in an ambient atmosphere, which leads to some ambiguous results and lack of definite structural information.
3.2.2. In Situ and Operando Raman Spectroscopic Characterization for the Formation and Deactivation Process of Active Sites
Raman spectroscopy is a sensitive spectroscopic technique to measure molecular vibrations changes on the surface region. (45,55−57) It takes advantage of in situ/operando Raman spectroscopic measurements to investigate dynamic structures of the catalytic active sites under reaction conditions. Especially, for the TiO2–x with oxygen vacancies, the anaerobic condition prevents O2 from adsorbing and filling the oxygen vacancies. For anatase TiO2, the Eg, B1g, and A1g peaks are mainly related to the symmetric stretching vibration, symmetric bending vibration, and antisymmetric bending vibration of the O–Ti–O, respectively. From the spectra in Figure 10a, the Raman peak of anatase Eg mode at 143 cm–1 for air-25-TiO2 and O2-600-TiO2 shifted toward 153 cm–1 for Ar-600-TiO2, C3H8-550-TiO2, and C3H8-600-TiO2. However, the B1g, A1g, and Eg mode Raman peaks in Figure 10b shifted to lower frequencies after high temperature treatment in inert or C3H8 gases. Moreover, for the air-25-TiO2 and Ar-600-TiO2 without the influence of C species, their Raman peak wavenumber and the relative peak intensities of Eg, A1g, and B1g mode are significantly different. The high temperature and anaerobic atmosphere easily led to a consumption of lattice oxygen and consequent formation of a non-stoichiometric anatase TiO2–x. Similar to the previous works, (53,58) the reduction of the TiO2 led to the Raman peak shift. So, under the PDH reaction condition, the structural distortion and reconstruction of the TiO2–x sample are due to the formation of a large amount of oxygen vacancies, which leads to the above Raman shifts and relative intensity changes of vibration mode.

3.3. DFT Calculations of PDH on TiO2–x
The above characterization powerfully proved that in situ removal of lattice oxygen under high temperature PDH conditions can form abundant oxygen vacancies, Ticus and H species on TiO2 surface. With the purpose to derive molecular insights into the catalytic active sites for PDH over anatase TiO2–x, we performed DFT calculations on TiO2(101) surfaces, as the (101) facet represents the most stable surface plane. In the present study, we focus on the effect of Ticus cations. Over the stoichiometric TiO2(101) surface (s-TiO2(101)), there are five-coordinated (Ti5c) and six-coordinated (Ti6c) Ti cations as well as two-coordinated (O2c) and three-coordinated (O3c) anions (Figure 11). The reduced TiO2–x(101) surface with an O3c vacancy (d-TiO2(101)) is built by the elimination of a three-coordinated O atom. It will generate three Ticus cations and two extra electrons, which will distribute on two adjacent Ticus cations. Thus, two adjacent coordinatively unsaturated Ti4+ cations are reduced to Ti3+ cations after accepting electrons.
Figure 11

Propane initially adsorbs on the surface via a horizontal configuration (Figure S11), which is in favor of the next dehydrogenation process, because H atoms of propane are close to the surface. The adsorption energy is very small on the stoichiometric surface or reduced surface due to the non-polar characteristic of propane. The reaction process of propane dehydrogenation to propene over TiO2(101) surfaces mainly contain two C–H bond breaking steps: the first step is methylene C–H bond activation of the C3H8 and the second step is methyl C–H bond cleavage of isopropyl (CH3CHCH3).
3.3.1. Propane Dehydrogenation on s-TiO2(101)
Literature works (19,61−63) have shown that metal-oxygen (M-O) pairs are the most favorable active sites for C–H bond activation of alkanes over metal oxides. During the C–H bond breaking, the four-centered O–H–Ti–C3H7 configuration can stabilize transition states. Over the s-TiO2(101) surface, the first C–H bond of propane is activated by Ti5c–O2c pairs. After the methylene C–H bond cleavage, the H atom is bonded to O2c forming hydroxyl (O2c–H) and to C1 (as shown in Figure 12). This process is endothermic by 0.79 eV and has an activation barrier of 1.59 eV. When the second C–H bond of CH3CHCH3 is broken, the H atom prefers to adsorb on O3c rather than O2c due to the shorter distance between the H and O atoms. The longer distance between H of CH3CHCH3 and lattice oxygen atoms causes an unstable transition state and the higher activation barrier. On the s-TiO2(101) surface, the second C–H bond breaking is an endothermic process (0.60 eV) and has an activation barrier of 1.68 eV (C1 to D1 in Figure 12). The activation barriers of propane dehydrogenation to propene over the s-TiO2(101) surface are higher than common catalysts. (19,64,65)

3.3.2. Propane Dehydrogenation on d-TiO2(101)
To investigate PDH reaction on the d-TiO2(101) surface, an O3c vacancy with three Ticus cations were designed according to experimental results. The propane can be activated by the Ticus–O2c pair or Ticus–Ticus pair (vacancy). The reaction energy (0.53 vs 0.77 eV) and activation barrier (1.44 vs 1.37 eV) are approximate for two active sites. The activation barriers are only about 0.30 eV lower than that on s-TiO2(101). We also create O2c vacancy on s-TiO2(101) and calculate activation barriers of propane activated by the Ticus–O2c pair or Ticus–Ticus pair. The result also shows that no matter where H atoms of propane adsorb on, the activation barriers of the first C–H bond cleavage only drop a little (less than 0.30 eV) compared with the s-TiO2(101) (Figures S13–S15). It illustrates that Ticus cations have little influence on the breaking of the first C–H bond of propane.
However, the situation is extremely different for the propene formation. We find that the second C–H bond cleavage is strongly favored by Ticus cations over the d-TiO2(101) surface (C2 to D2 in Figure 13). It is an exothermic process (−0.68 eV), and the activation barrier is 1.27 eV (TS2, Figure 12) lower than that over the s-TiO2(101) surface (TS2, Figure 12). The Ticus cations mainly affect the activation barrier of the second C–H bond breaking, as Ticus atoms have significant influence on hydrogen chemisorption (Table S2) and hydrogen chemisorption energies determine the activation barriers. For the first C–H bond activation, the coadsorption of H and CH3CHCH3 weakens the hydrogen chemisorption. Thereby, activation barriers have no obvious change. However, the second C–H bond cleavage is only related to hydrogen chemisorption. The hydrogen chemisorption of Ticus cations on the d-TiO2(101) (−2.89 eV) is much stronger, and this effect may weaken the C–H bond strength and facilitate the bond cleavage. We also built a reduced TiO2–x(101) surface with an O2c defect (Figure S12). Also, we calculated the mechanism of propane dehydrogenation on this surface compared with the s-TiO2(101) surface (Figures S13 and S14). The result also shows that Ticus cations may facilitate the dissociation of CH3CHCH3 and the formation of propene. On O2c defect surface, the energy barrier for CH3CHCH3 dissociation is 0.97 eV lower than that on the s-TiO2(101) surface.

3.3.3. Desorption of C3H6 and Formation of H2
After two C–H bond breakings, C3H6 and OH species were formed on the s-TiO2(101) surface. It is an endothermic process (0.13 eV) for propene desorption. The remaining O–H species on the TiO2(101) surface may form H2 to restore the catalyst surface or form H2O to generate oxygen vacancy (Figure S16). The most thermodynamically and kinetically preferred way for H transfer is the formation of H2. This process contains two steps. One is that H transfers from O3c to Ti5c to form intermediate species Ti–H, and the other is that H transfers from O2c to Ti–H to form H2. The barriers of these two steps are 1.82 ev (TS3 in Figure 12) and 0.63 eV (TS4 in Figure 12), respectively. Over the d-TiO2(101) surface, propene desorption needs 0.54 eV energy and there are OH and Ti–H species left on the d-TiO2(101) surface. The distance between the two H atoms is shorter and H atoms can directly combine to form H2 instead of through H transfer. This step has a slightly lower barrier of 1.62 eV (TS3 in Figure 13) and is endothermic by 1.19 eV (E2 to F2 in Figure 13). The formation of H2 is the rate-limiting step on propane dehydrogenation. It suggests that desorption of surface H species needs high temperature. The DFT calculation results also indicate that the H species absorb on subsurface oxygen vacancies sites to form relatively stable Ti–H species (Figure S17). Abundant H species was also detected in the spent TiO2 sample according to the results of 1H MAS NMR, O2-TPO, and C3H8 TPSR, which is consistent with the calculation results.
3.4. Impact Factors for the Formation of Oxygen Vacancies
According to the above PDH performance results, a large proportion reduction process of TiO2 nanomaterials was completed in the short in situ induction period. To investigate the impact factors on the consumption of lattice oxygen atoms, a series of experiments for different nanosized TiO2 samples were conducted.
It is generally accepted that the smaller nanosizes of metal oxide crystallites possess a higher surface area and more defect sites, such as step, hole, or corner structures, which are usually used for C–H activation. (19) Here, the PDH catalytic performance on the anatase TiO2 samples with average nanosizes of 5–10, 25, 40, 60, and 100 nm were tested under the same conditions. As shown in Figure 14, the r(C3H6) decreased basically with the increasing of the particle size of the fresh TiO2 nanoparticles. This phenomenon apparently conforms to the above conclusion. However, the specific surface area, N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, and pore-size distribution of the TiO2 changed significantly after not only pretreatment (N2 flow for 30 min at 600 °C) but also the PDH reaction process (Figures S18 and S19 and Table S3), except for the 100 nm TiO2 sample, indicating the agglomeration of 5–60 nm TiO2. The growth of the TiO2 particle was further proved clearly by TEM images of the fresh, pretreated, and spent TiO2 samples (Figure S20). For example, for the 5–10 nm TiO2 samples, its average nanosize became around 20 nm after PDH reaction. So, the nanosized anatase TiO2 particles went through the Ostwald ripening process at a high temperature. The smaller nanosized TiO2 particles with higher surface energy are more likely to induce Ostwald ripening. As the BET surface area of both pretreated and spent TiO2 samples (Table S3) are not related to their r(C3H6), which cannot be simply attributed to that the smaller nanosized TiO2 particle possesses the higher relative surface and more defect sites for PDH. It illustrates that the smaller nanosized TiO2 formed more active sites during the Ostwald ripening process.
Figure 14
Figure 14. Initial r(C3H6) related to the corresponding catalyst mass (black square), surface area of pretreated TiO2 (green triangle), and surface area of spent TiO2 (red circle) versus the different sizes of TiO2 (5–10, 25, 40, 60, and 100 nm). Pretreated condition: 600 °C for 30 min. Reaction condition: T = 600 °C, feed containing 2.5 vol % C3H8 in N2.
Notably, the 100 nm TiO2 is stable enough not to agglomerate (the BET surfaces are similar before and after the high temperature reaction, as shown in Table S3). There are no in situ reduction processes to form the active sites on the 100 nm TiO2 sample, and the C3H6 yield was nearly 0% under the same reaction condition. The DFT calculation results also demonstrated that the O2c vacancy formation should overcome corresponding high energy barrier (3.33 eV) through the H transfer of hydroxyl species and desorption of H2O on the s-TiO2(101) surface (Figure S16). So, the Ostwald ripening process was crucial to the in situ formation of Ticus for catalyzing the PDH reaction and it is significantly influenced by the particle size of TiO2.
At 600 °C, the in situ reduction period was too short to observe the formation process of active sites in detail. To prolong the in situ induction period, the C3H8 temperature-programmed surface reaction (C3H8-TPSR) over the 5–10, 25, 40, and 60 nm TiO2 catalysts were conducted. As shown in Figure 15a, only the 5–10 nm TiO2 catalyst produced propene below 500 °C. The r(C3H6) increased at 425–481 °C just along with the abrupt formation of an oxygen-containing compound, especially for CO and CO2 (Figure 15)b. For the 25, 40, and 60 nm TiO2 samples, although some oxygen-containing compound formed, it did not reach the peak value and no C3H6 was detected below 500 °C (Figure 15a and Figure S21). It is consistent with the catalytic performance of 100 nm TiO2. These phenomena further illustrate that most of the Ticus sites of nanosized TiO2 were formed through abrupt reduction rather than substantial existence.

Figure 15. (a) Profiles of C3H6 (m/e 42) during C3H8 temperature-programmed surface reaction over the 5–10, 25, 40, and 60 nm TiO2 samples. (b) Profiles of H2 (m/e = 2), CO (m/e = 12), CO2 (m/e = 16), C3H6 (m/e 42), and H2O (m/e = 18) during C3H8 temperature-programmed surface reaction over the 5–10 nm TiO2 sample.
To explain the influence of the nanoparticle size of the fresh TiO2 samples on the r(C3H6), a hypothesis was proposed as shown in Figure 16, and the disassembly and growth of TiO2 nanoparticles during the Ostwald ripening process make lattice oxygen atoms become mobile and active, which are consumed more easily, and then form oxygen vacancies and Ticus. Under the pretreated reduction or PDH reaction conditions, the atomic rearrangement of the Ostwald ripening process lowered down the formation energy of Ticus sites.

Besides the particle size and specific surface area of TiO2 catalysts reflecting the Ostwald ripening phenomenon, the growth of crystal grain is also one of the important indicators. As shown in Figure S22, the crystal grain sizes of different nanosized TiO2 samples after pretreatment and PDH reaction were obtained by XRD measurements and calculated by the Scherrer equation. The highest intensity of the diffraction peak at about 25.3o was selected, and the corresponding average thickness values (d) of crystal grain perpendicular to crystal plane (101) are shown in the Table S4. The dp – ds is the difference between the d values of the pretreated TiO2 and spent TiO2, illustrating the growth degree of the TiO2 crystal grain size during the reduction and reaction process. The value of dp – ds is in line with the initial r(C3H6) of different nanosized TiO2 samples (Figure 17), indicating that the growth of the crystal grain size is the key factor for the formation of active sites during Ostwald ripening.

Initial r(C3H6) versus the value of dp – ds over different nanosized TiO2 samples. dp – ds: difference in the d values of grain perpendicular to crystal plane (101) between the pretreated TiO2 and spent TiO2 samples. Pretreated condition: 30 min N2 at 550 °C. Reduction conditions: time = 30 min, T = 550 °C, 25 mL/min 20 vol % CO/N2. Reaction conditions: 0.2 g catalyst, T = 550 °C, 10 mL/min feed containing 2.5 vol % C3H8/N2.
To better understand the relationship between the nanosized TiO2 sample and the oxygen vacancy formation, the reaction temperature was lowered down to 500 °C for prolonging the induction period of in situ reduction. As shown in the Figure 18a, the STY(COx) of all the different nanosized TiO2 samples suddenly increased with the time on stream; it indicated an abrupt stepped-up surface reduction through consumption of lattice oxygen by propane and its derivatives. We denoted this phenomenon as “mutation reduction”. Notably, the larger the nanoparticle size of the catalyst, the longer time is needed to induce the mutation reduction. It is generally accepted that the smaller nanoparticles have a higher total surface energy to induce Ostwald ripening. (29) The atom rearrangements of the agglomeration process make the oxygen atoms more active to react with propane and its derivatives, which was certified by the highest CO2 (deep oxidation products) selectivity at mutation reduction points (Figure S23). The STYpropene immediately increased after the mutation reduction (Figure 18b), which directly corroborates the hypothesis that the agglomeration of nanosized TiO2 facilitates the in situ reduction to form Ticus.

As seen in Figure 19 and Figure S24, the almost same apparent active energy of propene formation values (Ea(C3H6)) were obtained for the in situ-reduced 5–10, 25, and 40 nm TiO2 samples. It suggests that the different nanosized TiO2 samples possess the same active site structure after in situ reduction. However, the Ea(C3H6) value of 60 nm TiO2 was slightly larger than the smaller nanosized TiO2. This is probably because the larger nanosized TiO2 samples are more difficult to be reduced, which needs additional energy for the formation of Ticus. (20)

To quantify the concentration of oxygen vacancies, O2-pulse experiments of the 5–10 nm TiO2 samples with different CO reduction times were performed. Minimal O2 was pulsed to the reduced TiO2 until there is no detection of O2 consumption. Based on the amount of the consumed O2, the concentration of oxygen vacancies was calculated by assuming that one O2 molecule fills two vacancies. (20) For the pulse temperatures at 60 and 500 °C, the corresponding O2 consumption are related with surface and total oxygen vacancy, respectively (Table S5). It is generally recognized that the amount of active sites on the catalyst surface determines the reaction rate. As shown in Figure 20, the amount of surface oxygen vacancy is in line with STYC3H6, which certifies the rationality of the measurement method of the oxygen vacancy amount. We define the amount of bulk oxygen vacancy as the difference in the oxygen-consumed values between the total and surface oxygen vacancy. As shown in Figure 21, with the CO reduction time, the different value between the bulk and surface oxygen vacancy densities became larger, indicating that more bulk lattice oxygen atoms migrate to the surface under the high temperature reduction condition. It is consistent with Sencer’s research; (66) surface oxygen vacancies of TiO2 could diffuse toward the bulk material at a high temperature.

In the in situ reaction process, C3H8 is not only the reactant of the PDH reaction but also the reducing agent for TiO2. As shown in Figure S25, for both the fresh and reduced TiO2 samples, no physical C3H8 absorption MS signal was detected, which is consistent with the results of the DFT calculation; the physical adsorption energy is very small on the stoichiometric or defect surface due to the non-polar characteristic of propane. Only the MS signals of H2O, H2, and CO2 were detected, as shown in Figure 22. For the reduced TiO2 sample, the onset and peak temperatures of H2O and CO2 MS signals were both 50 °C lower than those of the fresh TiO2 sample, indicating that the formed Ticus was more facile to induce further reduction by consuming lattice oxygen atoms with chemically adsorbed hydrocarbon species. Interestingly, the H species desorption temperature of the reduced TiO2 was higher than that of the fresh TiO2. It further demonstrated the strong Ticus bonding effect with H species.

4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
A series of ex/in situ characterizations and DFT calculation provides a fundamental understanding on the PDH reaction mechanism on Ticus, which is immensely scientifically important for the design of coordinatively unsaturated cation sites. We systematically investigated the oxygen vacancies and Ticus formation process on nanosized TiO2. The Ostwald ripening of nanosized TiO2 is crucial to the formation of oxygen vacancies, as the agglomeration of TiO2 nanoparticles makes the lattice oxygen atoms mobile and leads to “mutation reduction”. The lattice oxygen migration of oxide catalysts, on the one hand, is conducive to the formation of Ticus through reduction. On the other hand, it causes catalyst excessive reduction to deactivation. The equilibrium between formation and stability of Ticus is the key to the further design and preparation of high-efficiency TiO2-based PDH catalyst, which can be generally applied in other metal oxides, especially for the research of unsaturated coordinately cation sites for thermal catalysis in reduced gas.
