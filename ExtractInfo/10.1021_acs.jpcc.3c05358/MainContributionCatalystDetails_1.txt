 Based on the supplied document, this does not appear to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses propane dehydrogenation on cobalt catalysts, but does not provide details on conversion, selectivity, stability, or other performance metrics. Since the key metrics related to PDH catalysis are not provided, I cannot extract the requested information.
