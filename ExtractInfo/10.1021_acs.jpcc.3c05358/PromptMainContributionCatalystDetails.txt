Structure Sensitivity Study of Propane Dehydrogenation on Cobalt Catalysts: HCP versus FCC
Abstract
In heterogeneous catalysis, it is crucial to understand the structure sensitivity in order to elucidate the reaction mechanism and rationally design optimal catalysts. In this work, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) and side reactions (cracking and deep dehydrogenation) were studied by density functional theory calculations on Co catalysts with different crystallographic structures: face-centered cubic (FCC) and hexagonal closed packed (HCP). Wulff construction reveals that the most stable facet of each crystallographic structure, viz. Co(111) and Co(0001), cover 76.2% and 19.4% of the exposed surface. Various reaction pathways for PDH, deep dehydrogenation, and cracking were explored on Co(111) and Co(0001). Microkinetic simulation results suggest that PDH proceeds through both dehydrogenation pathways (via 1-propyl or 2-propyl intermediate) on Co(111), while it favors path A (via 1-propyl intermediate) on Co(0001). At typical reaction conditions of PDH, Co(111) is more active than Co(0001) by 1.3 times, while the latter is more selective toward propylene production and more resistive to coke formation. Compared to Pt(111), both Co surfaces are more active for PDH while Co(0001) is also more selective toward propylene formation. This work provides fundamental insights into the crystallographic structure sensitivity of propane dehydrogenation on a Co catalyst and useful guidance to achieve better catalytic performance for a Co catalyst.

Propylene is an important chemical raw material, and its downstream products of great variety are closely related to people’s life. Driven by this, the demand for basic organic chemical products generated from propylene has soared, and the propane to propylene process solves both the propane surplus and the propylene shortage problem. (1,2) As a new process for the production of propylene, direct dehydrogenation of propane has the advantages of high yield and less byproducts compared with the traditional steam cracking process. (3) Given the good economic prospect of this process, propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has attracted extensive attention from the catalysis community to develop more efficient heterogeneous catalysts than the commercial Pt and CrOx catalysts used in industry. (4−8) As shown in Scheme 1, competing side reactions of PDH involve the deep dehydrogenation of propylene and the cracking of the C3 species. According to the sequence of dehydrogenation, there are two possible reaction pathways for PDH: one is to eliminate H on the primary carbon first and form a 1-propyl (CH3CH2CH2*) intermediate (path A), and the other is to eliminate H on the secondary carbon first and form a 2-propyl (CH3CHCH3*) intermediate (path B). Similarly, deep dehydrogenation reactions leading to propyne formation can also occur through two pathways via 1-propenyl (CH3CHCH3*, path D) and 2-propenyl (CH3CHCH2*, path E) intermediates, respectively. In the process of dehydrogenation, any C3 species may have a side reaction caused by cleavage of the C–C bond. Both of these side reactions will lead to coking and eventually to the deactivation of the surface active centers of the catalyst.
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Reaction Network of PDH and Side Reactions
Determining the structural sensitivity of catalytic reactions is one critical step for developing structure–activity relationship and designing optimal catalysts in heterogeneous catalysis. (9) A typical example of structurally sensitive reactions is the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS). (10−12) As the rate-determining step in FTS, CO activation is greatly impacted by the crystallographic structures and exposed crystal facets of Co, (13) Ru (14) and Ni (15) catalysts. For Co, phase transition between the hexagonal close-packed (HCP) phase and the face centered cubic (FCC) phase can occur by tuning the catalyst size, support, and by varying the pretreating conditions (or reaction conditions). (16) HCP-Co is more active than FCC-Co in FTS due to lower activation energies of CO dissociation. (17) CO activation follows different reaction mechanisms on different facets of HCP-Co, among which the (101̅1) facet shows the highest FTS activity as well as carbon chain growth ability to form C5+ products. (18−20)
With the complexity of the phase transition of Co during reaction conditions, structure sensitivity of PDH on Co catalysts is still an open question. Chen et al. (21) prepared ultrafine Co particles in dealuminated β zeolite, the catalytic performance of which is comparable to the commercial catalysts with 57% propane conversion and 96% propylene selectivity being achieved at 600 °C for PDH. They also suggested that PDH over Co is likely a structure-sensitive reaction with small confined Co particles being the active sites, whereas large Co and Co3O4 particles lead to cracking and carbon deposition side reactions. Wang et al. (22) prepared single-atom Co catalysts within the three-dimensional channels of SiO2 nanomeshes (NMs), which exhibited superior PDH performance of 95% propylene selectivity and 196 h–1 turnover frequency (TOF). They indicated that the unsaturated Co–O3 sites are the dehydrogenation sites that account for the 15 times higher activity than Co nanoparticles supported on SiO2 NMs. But none of these studies investigated the sensitivity of PDH regarding the Co crystallographic structures.
The crystal-structure sensitivity of PDH on other metals was rarely discussed in the literature, where most relevant studies focused on activity dependence on catalyst size or crystal planes. Take the most extensively studied Pt catalyst as an example, Zhang et al. (23) demonstrated that the activity, selectivity toward propylene and stability of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts for PDH are significantly dependent on the size of platinum. Yang et al. studied the mechanism of PDH on flat Pt(111) and stepped Pt(211) surfaces using density functional theory (DFT) calculations. (24) They found the activity of Pt(111) for PDH is lower than that of Pt(211), while propylene selectivity on Pt(111) is higher than Pt(211) by restraining the cracking of C3 species. As deep dehydrogenation and cracking of C3 derivatives proceed, the stepped surface preferentially forms coke. This explains the experimental results that smaller Pt nanoparticles with more step sites are more active and less selective in PDH than larger ones.
Researchers have investigated the reaction mechanism of PDH on Pt- and Ni-based (25) catalysts in detail with computational studies, providing useful guidance to the rational design of superior catalysts. But this does not include Co-based catalysts, where the detailed reaction mechanism of PDH remains to be elucidated. In this work, we studied PDH together with the deep dehydrogenation and cracking side reactions on FCC-Co and HCP-Co, revealing the structure-sensitive nature of this reaction, regarding the Co crystallographic structure.

Plane-wave DFT calculations were performed by the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP.5.4.4), (26−28) where the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBE-GGA) was used with an energy cutoff of 400 eV. (29) The convergence criteria for ionic and electronic iterations in structure optimization were set to be 0.02 eV/Å and 1.0 × 10–5 eV, respectively. In addition, the magnetic properties of the Co metal were taken into account with spin-polarized calculations. The DFT-D3 method proposed by Grimme et al. was adopted to describe the van der Waals dispersion interactions. (30) The Monkhorst–Pack grid with 4 × 4 × 1 k-points was employed to sample the first Brillouin region. (31) The geometries of transition states (TSs) were searched by the climbing image nudge elastic band (CI-NEB) method followed by optimizations with the dimer method using 0.05 eV/Å and 1.0 × 10–6 eV as the convergence criteria. (32−35) Vibrational frequency calculations were further conducted to verify the TS structures. FCC-Co and HCP-Co models were simulated by a 4 × 4 supercell with corresponding lattice constants of a = b = c = 3.4473 Å and a = b = 2.4510 Å, c = 3.9535 Å, respectively (Figure S1). The bottom two layers of the four-layer slabs were fixed during the calculations, and a vacuum region as thick as 12 Å was set to avoid periodic interactions.

3.1. Wulff Construction
Cobalt metal has two distinct crystal phases, FCC-Co and HCP-Co. The contribution of a single crystal to the overall reaction activity is affected by the surface-area ratio of exposed facets, since the intrinsic activity of each facet is different. The equilibrium morphology of FCC-Co and HCP-Co with multiple exposed crystal planes based on the Wulff construction can be obtained from the calculated surface energy, as shown in Figure 1.
Figure 1
Figure 1. Equilibrium morphologies of (a) FCC-Co and (b) HCP-Co from Wulff construction.
We calculated the surface energy of three facets for FCC-Co (100, 110, and 111) and six facets for HCP-Co (0001, 101̅0, 101̅1, 101̅2, 112̅0, and 112̅1); the results are summarized in Table 1. Bulk FCC-Co belongs to the Oh point group, and its equilibrium morphology composed of three facets has an octahedron-like shape, where the close-packed (111) facet has the lowest surface energy of 126.7 meV and covers 76.2% of the total exposed surface area. The remaining open facets (100) and (110) cover relatively smaller portions of the surface area (Ss/% = 16.9 and 6.9) with higher surface energies of 154.6 and 150.8 meV, respectively. This is consistent with previous studies. (36)

Bulk HCP-Co belongs to the D6h point group, and its calculated morphology has a dihedron-like shape with two close-packed (0001) crystal planes. Of all the exposed facets calculated, (0001) has the lowest surface energy of 128.0 meV, but it only covers 19.4% of the total surface. The surface of HCP-Co is dominated by several facets including (0001), (101̅0) and (101̅1), constituting 19.4%, 19.0% and 27.3% of the exposed surface, respectively. It is seen that the relative ratios of exposed facets depend not only on the surface energy, but also on the crystal symmetry and orientations of different facets. In the following sections, considering the phenomenon that the most stable crystal face during the experimental preparation process is more easily exposed and prepared, we will discuss results from mechanistic studies on the most stable crystal planes of FCC-Co and HCP-Co, namely, Co(111) and Co(0001).
3.2. Adsorption of H, Propane, Propylene, and Propyne on Co
The reactant and product C3 species (propane, propylene, propyne) and the generated H atoms during dehydrogenation steps are important to the overall reaction; therefore, their adsorption on Co surfaces are discussed first. Literature reports have proved that the PBE functional does not describe the nonlocal van der Waals (vdW) interactions well. (37,38) Here, we use the DFT-D3 method to account for the vdW forces. (39)
There are three possible adsorption sites for hydrogen on both Co surfaces, namely, fcc, hcp, and top sites (Figure S2a). Table S1 summarizes the adsorption energies of H at different positions on both Co surfaces. The fcc site is the most stable adsorption position for H on both Co(111) and Co(0001) (Figure 2), with an adsorption energy of −3.90 and −3.98 eV, respectively. The hcp site is slightly less favorable than the fcc site, while the top site is the least favorable for H adsorption. H does not adsorb on the top sites of Co(111), and it binds weakly on the top site of Co(0001), with an Eads of −3.45 eV. Compared to Pt(111) with an Eads of −3.92 eV for H adsorption on the most stable fcc site, H binds slightly more strongly on Co(0001) (Table 2).

Pt(111) –3.92 –0.68 –1.72 –2.72
Figure 2
Figure 2. Top view and side views of adsorbed intermediates on Co(111) and Co(0001).
Propane binds weakly on Co(111) and Co(0001), with respective Eads of −0.55 and −0.57 eV (Table 2). Similar to Pt(111), propane adsorption on Co catalyst is a typical physical adsorption, as revealed by the tiny distortions of the molecular structure upon adsorption (Table S2, Figure S3).
Four different adsorption sites on Co were investigated for propylene and propyne (Figure S2b). The target product, propylene, prefers the hollow-top site on Co(111) and the fcc-hcp site on Co(0001), as shown in Figure 2. The adsorption of propylene lifts up one surface Co atom on Co(111), while there is no obvious deformation for Co(0001) upon propylene adsorption. Propylene adsorption leads to stretching of the double bond from 1.34 Å in the gas phase to ca. 1.46 Å on both Co surfaces (Table S3). The angle formed by the three carbon atoms of propylene decreased by 3–4° upon its adsorption on Co. These structural distortions symbolize a strong interaction between propylene and the catalyst surface, with Eads of −2.25 eV and −1.37 eV on Co(111) and Co(0001), respectively.
Propyne is the precursor for coke formation during PDH, and the ease of propyne formation undermines the selectivity of propylene to a certain extent. Propyne prefers the fcc-hcp adsorption site on both Co(111) and Co(0001) (Figure 2). Compared with propylene, the deformation of the adsorbed propyne is more serious; the bond angle changes from 180.0° in the gas phase to 121.0° on Co surfaces. Similar to propylene, the triple bond of propyne stretches from 1.21 Å in the gas phase to 1.43–1.44 Å on Co (Table S4). Propyne has adsorption energies of −3.38 and −2.84 eV on Co(111) and Co(0001), respectively. Propyne binds much more strongly on Co than on Pt(111), which has an Eads of −2.72 eV.
3.3. Bader Charge and Electronic Structure Calculations
We calculated the Bader charge of adsorbed propane, propylene, and propyne on Co(111) and Co(0001). Our results show that upon adsorption of propane, propylene, and propyne on Co surfaces, electron will transfer from Co to adsorbates, rendering them negatively charged. The calculated charge transfer and the differential charge density caused by adsorption are presented in Table S5 and Figure S4, respectively.
Bader charge analysis shows that both Co(111) and Co(0001) crystals lose electrons to C3 adsorbates, but the latter loses more than the former in general. The number of electrons gains by C3 adsorbates follows the order of propyne > propylene > propane. It clearly shows the greater the adsorption strength is, the more charge is transferred between Co and adsorbates. For example, Co(111) and Co(0001) only lose 0.04 and 0.03 electrons, respectively, to the weakly adsorbed propane. Propyne adsorbs most strongly among the three C3 species, and it also gained the highest number of electrons, viz. 0.50 electrons from Co(111) and 0.58 electrons from Co(0001). In fact, we found a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.79) between the adsorption energy of C3 adsorbates and the amount of charge transferred to them from Co (Figure 3). Therefore, the charge transfer is a good descriptor for the adsorption strength of C3 species on Co.
Figure 3
Figure 3. Linear correlation between the adsorption energy and charge transferred from Co to adsorbates.
We then investigated the electronic structures of the two Co surfaces. The density of states (DOS) projected onto the d-band of surface Co atoms is shown in Figure S5. Table S6 lists the calculated d-band center (εd) of Co(111) and Co(0001) before and after adsorption of propane, propylene and propyne. We found on both Co surfaces, adsorption of C3 chemicals shifts εd of surface Co atoms to lower-energy values away from the Fermi level.
For a given d-DOS, the d-band center (εd), d-band bandwidth (W̅) and the d-band filling (fd) can be calculated by the following equations: (40,41)

where ρ represents the density of states and E is the energy of state. Table S6 summarizes the fd, εd and W̅ values on Co(111) and Co(0001). For both Co surfaces, the d-band filling has little difference whether there is adsorbate on the surface or not. Unlike the simplified rectangular d-band model proposed by No̷rskov, (42) where εd and W̅ usually follow a perfect linear correlation as long as fd is constant, the d-band center and d-bandwidth calculated using rigorous definition equations here show a moderately good linear correlation (R2 = 0.76) with a negative slope (Figure S6), indicating broadening the d-DOS will lead to a down-shift of εd. Comparing propylene adsorption on Co(111) and Co(0001), we found propylene adsorption mainly narrows the d-band of Co(111), while it downshifts the d-band center of spin-down d-orbitals for Co(0001) (Table S7). Because of the different impacts imposed by adsorbates on the electronic structure of two Co surfaces, we did not find a correlation between the adsorption energy of C3 species and the d-band center value.
3.4. Reaction Pathway Analysis of PDH on Co(111) and Co(0001)
As described in Scheme 1, propane dehydrogenation to propylene includes two dehydrogenation steps and can occur via two different pathways according to the intermediate generated in the first dehydrogenation step, viz. path A with 1-propyl as the intermediate and path B with 2-propyl as the intermediate. The activation energies of all elementary steps calculated on Co(111) and Co(0001) are listed in Table 3; the corresponding values on Pt(111) are also presented for comparison. The potential energy diagrams (PEDs) are shown in Figure 4 and structures of the intermediates and transition states are given in Figure 5.

For path A, adsorbed propane removes the first hydrogen from its primary carbon and forms 1-propyl adsorbed to the top site on Co(111) and hcp site on Co(0001); the corresponding activation energies are 0.73 and 1.05 eV, respectively. The produced 1-propyl intermediate adsorbs on the surface in a more compact manner than propane, and its adsorption energy is −3.53 eV and −3.32 eV on Co(111) and Co(0001), respectively. The second dehydrogenation step of path A removes a hydrogen from the secondary carbon and occurs at the off-top position with very small barriers of 0.27 and 0.13 eV on Co(111) and Co(0001), respectively. Comparing the activation energies of the two dehydrogenation steps, the second step is a facile reaction while the first dehydrogenation step is the rate-limiting step (RLS) of PDH for path A.
For path B, dehydrogenation of propane initiates from the secondary carbon with activation energies of 0.66 and 1.15 eV on Co(111) and Co(0001), respectively. This barrier is higher than the corresponding value for path A on Co(0001), while the opposite is true for Co(111). The 2-propyl formed by dehydrogenation still forms a strong chemical bond with the catalyst surface, and its adsorption energy is −3.44 and −2.25 eV on Co(111) and Co(0001), respectively. 2-propyl is less stable than its isomer, 1-propyl generated in path A. Compared to the first dehydrogenation step, the second dehydrogenation step takes place on the primary carbon with much smaller respective barriers of 0.35 and 0.36 eV on Co(111) and Co(0001). In common with path A, the first dehydrogenation step of path B has a higher barrier than the second and serves as the rate-limiting step of this pathway.
As shown in Figure 4, path A is more favorable than path B on the Co(0001) catalyst, where the former has lower energies for all states on the PED than the latter. On the contrary, Co(111) prefers path B as its PDH reaction path. Compared to Pt(111), all elementary reactions leading to propylene formation have smaller barriers on the Co(111) catalyst, especially, the second dehydrogenation reactions (dehydrogenation of 1-propyl and 2-propyl) occur more easily on Co(111) than on Pt(111) (Table 2). Focusing on the RLS of the more preferable pathway, viz. the first dehydrogenation step of the optimal path, Co(111) has a smaller barrier than Pt(111) by 0.11 eV, while Co(0001) has a higher barrier than Pt(111) by 0.28 eV. This indicates that Co(111) is probably more active for PDH than Pt(111), while Co(0001) is less active than Pt(111).
Desorption of the produced propylene from PDH will compete with the side reactions, including deep dehydrogenation and cracking, determining the selectivity of propylene. The calculated desorption energies (or desorption barriers) of propylene on Co(111) and Co(0001) are 2.25 and 1.37 eV respectively, which are the opposite numbers of Eads for propylene presented in Table 2. The side reactions and selectivity of propylene are discussed in the following sections.
3.5. Side Reactions on Co(111) and Co(0001)
As mentioned above, cracking and deep dehydrogenation (further dehydrogenation of propylene to propyne) are two kinds of side reactions that have a direct impact on propylene selectivity. As shown in Scheme 1, two pathways of deep dehydrogenation are included in the reaction network and all C3 species involved, namely, propane, 1-propyl (CH3CH2CH2*), 2-propyl (CH3CHCH3), propylene, 1-propenyl (CH3CHCH*), 2-propenyl (CH3CCH2*), and propyne are considered for C–C bond cracking reactions. Configurations of intermediates and TSs for deep dehydrogenation and cracking are presented in Figure 6 and Figure 7, respectively. The corresponding activation energies are summarized in Table 3 and Table 4.

3.5.1. Deep Dehydrogenation Reactions to Form Propyne
For the two deep dehydrogenation pathways, path D is to remove a hydrogen atom from the terminal carbon at the double bond end and forms 1-propenyl, followed by hydrogen removal from the middle carbon to form propyne, while path E has a reverse dehydrogenation sequence via the 2-propenyl intermediate. All intermediate and transition state structures of deep dehydrogenation are shown in Figure 6. The first dehydrogenation step in path D has modest barriers of 0.79 and 0.64 eV on Co(111) and Co(0001), respectively, while the second dehydrogenation step needs to overcome respective barriers of 1.19 and 0.37 eV. As a result, the first dehydrogenation step represents the rate-limiting step for path D on Co(0001) and second dehydrogenation step for Co(111).
The first dehydrogenation step in path E (step E3) has respective barriers of 0.86 and 0.64 eV on Co(111) and Co(0001), while the second step (step E4) has respective barriers of 1.32 and 0.29 eV on Co(111) and Co(0001). Similar to path D, the first and the second dehydrogenation step serve as the RLS for path E on Co(0001) and Co(111), respectively.
Comparing the energetics of the two deep dehydrogenation pathways on PED in Figure 4, both Co(111) and Co(0001) prefer path E as the deep-dehydrogenation pathway. Co(0001) is more active than Co(111) for the deep dehydrogenation reactions to form propyne, and it is also more active than Pt(111) for the deep dehydrogenation reactions.
3.5.2. Cracking of C3 Species
The C–C, C═C and C≡C bonds usually have very high bond energies and need to surmount high barriers to break the bonds. Generally speaking, the strong interaction between the catalyst surface and adsorbates can weaken these C–C bonds. As a weakly adsorbed species, propane cracking to ethyl (CH3CH2*) and methyl (CH3*) has very high respective barriers of 1.71 and 2.69 eV on Co(111) and Co(0001), which are much higher than the dehydrogenation barriers of any path. Such difficult activation of propane occurs due to the steric hindrance effect of H on tetrahedral methyl groups, which hinders the contact of propane C atoms with surface Co atoms.
Cleavage of 1-propyl to methylene (CH2*) and ethyl (CH3CH2*) has a barrier of 1.13 and 1.15 eV on Co(111) and Co(0001), respectively; the C–C activation of 1-propyl is more difficult than its dehydrogenation on both Co surfaces. The C–C cleavage of 2-propyl to methyl and ethylidene (CH3CH*) also has a higher barrier (1.05 and 0.98 eV) than its dehydrogenation on Co catalysts.
C═C bond cleavage of propylene forming methylene (CH2*) and ethylidene (CH3CH*) has activation energies of 2.21 and 1.10 eV on Co(111) and Co(0001), respectively. Propylene dehydrogenation is more easily activated than cracking of propylene, and therefore, deep dehydrogenation is the major side reaction that diminishes the propylene selectivity.
For the cracking of 1-propenyl and 2-propenyl intermediates, only the cracking of 1-propenyl on Co(111) has a similar barrier as its dehydrogenation (Figure 8a,b), while all the other cracking steps are more difficult than the corresponding dehydrogenation steps. Compared to Pt(111), cracking on Co catalysts are in general more facile besides a few exceptions related to closed-shell species. Cracking of propane and propyne on Co(0001) are more difficult than on Pt(111), while cracking of propylene and propyne on Co(111) are more difficult than on Pt(111). Comparing the cracking barriers with dehydrogenation barriers, we can conclude that the most probable precursor for coke formation is 1-propenyl on Co(111) and Pt(111), and 2-propenyl on Co(0001).

3.6. Propylene Selectivity Analysis
The target product of the PDH process is propylene, the selectivity of which will be diminished by deep dehydrogenation and cracking side reactions. As shown in Figure 8c, cracking has a higher activation energy than dehydrogenation for most species on both Co(111) and Co(0001). The only exception is 1-propenyl on Co(111); viz., its cracking barrier is lower than its dehydrogenation barrier by 0.01 eV. We note 1-propenyl belongs to path D that is less favorable and may carry minimal reaction flux, and this exception will not affect the selectivity of propylene significantly. In addition, cracking side reactions most likely occur at a very late stage after propylene formation, through 1-propenyl or 2-propneyl intermediate. Therefore, deep dehydrogenation is the dominant side reaction that impacts propylene selectivity on both Co(111) and Co(0001). In order to compare the propylene selectivity on the two Co surfaces, we define the energy difference (δE) between desorption energy and dehydrogenation barrier of propylene, δE = Edesorption – Ea, dehydrogenation. The larger the δE value, the lower the propylene selectivity. As shown in Figure 8, parts a and b, propylene preferentially goes through the deep dehydrogenation reaction among the three possible reaction pathways (desorption, deep dehydrogenation, and cracking) on both Co surfaces. As a result, both Co surfaces have positive δE values, 1.46 eV for Co(111) and 0.72 eV for Co(0001), the former is less selective toward propylene formation than the latter. Pt(111) has a δE value of 1.00 eV, indicating Co(0001) is more propylene selective than Co(111) and Pt(111). The same conclusion is reached when using the corresponding Gibbs free energy values at a typical reaction temperature of 853 K (Table S8).
Based on the DFT-calculated energies presented in Figure 8d, Co(111) surface is more active than Pt(111) for PDH although its propylene selectivity is less satisfying, while Co(0001) is more selective toward propylene production with lower activity than Pt(111). Adding metal promoters (such as Sn, (43) Ga, (44) Y (45)) has been proven to be useful strategies to promote the propylene selectivity on Pt-based catalysts. Experimental and computational studies both reveal that introducing Sn to Pt forming Pt–Sn alloys significantly improves the propylene selectivity without compensating much of its activity. Likewise, this strategy could be applied to a more active Co catalyst to elevate its propylene selectivity.
3.7. Microkinetic Analysis
We also performed microkinetic analysis with the CatMAP (46) software using the DFT acquired data. The reaction model includes all eight dehydrogenation steps shown in Table 3 together with the adsorption of propane and the desorption of various products. Please see Supporting Information, Section 2, for detailed information about the microkinetic simulation.
We plotted and compared the turnover frequency (TOF) of propane dehydrogenation on Co(111), Co(0001) and Pt(111) as a function of temperature or pressure (Figure 9). As shown in Figure 9A, both Co(111) and Co(0001) have higher reaction rates than Pt(111) at industrial relevant reaction temperatures above 750 K. Co(111) is more sensitive to the reaction temperature than the other two catalysts and becomes the most active catalyst at higher temperature above 850 K, while Co(0001) is the most active one at lower temperature below 800 K. The reaction rates can be promoted at higher pressure on all three catalysts. Co(0001) is the most sensitive catalyst to reaction pressure: its TOF for PDH increases by ca. 4.57 times from 1 to 5 bar. At typical reaction conditions of 853 K and 1 bar, the TOF of PDH on Co(111) and Co(0001) is higher than Pt(111) by 7.54 and 5.97 times, respectively. We note the higher activity of Co(0001) (than Pt(111)) for PDH is not expected based on the DFT-obtained PEDs, which signifies the temperature effects on reaction energetics. The corresponding Gibbs free energy (at 853 K) diagram is shown in Figure S7.

Based on the microkinetic modeling results, the TOF ratio for path A and path B (TOFA/TOFB) at 853 K is 0.87 on Co(111) and 1.65 on Co(0001), indicating that both dehydrogenation pathways contribute to the reaction flux on Co(111), while the PDH reaction predominately proceeds through path A via the 1-propyl mediate.
4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In this work, we used density functional theory calculations to reveal the reaction mechanism and the structure-sensitive nature of PDH on Co catalysts. The equilibrium morphology of FCC-Co from Wulff construction has an octahedron-like shape with eight most stable (111) planes, while HCP-Co has a dihedron-like shape with two most stable (0001) planes. Then the reaction mechanism of PDH together with side reactions of deep dehydrogenation and cracking were studied in detail on Co(111) and Co(0001).
Based on microkinetic simulation results, PDH preferentially occurs through path A via the 1-propyl intermediate on Co(0001), while both dehydrogenation pathways contribute to the reaction flux on Co(111). For the side deep dehydrogenation reactions, path E via the 2-propenyl intermediate is favored on both Co(111) and Co(0001). Cracking most likely takes place at a late stage of the reaction after propylene formation. The most probable coke precursors are 1-propenyl on Co(111) and 2-propenyl on Co(0001). Co(111) is more prone to coke deposition than Co(0001). Due to the high cracking barriers, deep dehydrogenation is the dominant side reaction that competes with propylene desorption.
At typical reaction conditions of 853 K and 1 bar, both Co(111) and Co(0001) are more active than Pt(111) with higher TOF for the PDH reaction by 7.54 and 5.97 times, respectively. The selectivity toward propylene production follows the trend of Co(0001) > Pt(111) > Co111). Given the excellent PDH activity of Co compared to commercial catalysts, careful catalyst design to selectively prohibit the deep dehydrogenation reactions is highly desirable for its practical application. In this regard, this work provides fundamental mechanistic insights that are of great significance for the rational design of optimal Co-based catalysts for propane dehydrogenation.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
