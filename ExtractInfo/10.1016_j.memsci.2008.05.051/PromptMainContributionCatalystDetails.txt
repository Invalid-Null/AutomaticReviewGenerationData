Hydrogen production capacity of membrane reformer for methane steam reforming near practical working conditions
Abstract
Currently, H2 production techniques for application to proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are intensively investigated, aiming to realize a clean hydrogen society. Due to the limitation by the thermodynamics of methane steam reforming (MSR), multi-reactions and multi-steps should be performed before the generated H2-rich gas could be delivered to PEMFC, which inevitably increases the cost of H2. However, using a thermodynamic shifting membrane reformer, H2 could be produced compactly from MSR, provided that the catalyst showed high performance for MSR reaction and membrane efficiently removed H2 from the reaction zone. We presented here a Pd-based membrane reformer for MSR reaction. In contrast with previous reports, nickel-based catalyst pre-reduced at high temperature was applied in this work, as well as high performance Pd-based membrane. The performances of the membrane reformer in terms of H2 production capacity were also widely investigated. It was found that combination of an active catalyst for MSR and a H2 ultra-permeable Pd membrane obtained high flux of H2 across the membrane and recovery rate of H2 in the membrane reformer. For instance, 98.8% methane conversion, over 97.0% selectivity to CO2 and over 95.0% recovery rate of H2 were obtained under mild working conditions. Simultaneously, the hydrogen flux across the membrane reached 18.6 m3/(m2 h), and Pd-based pure H2 production capacity significantly increased and reached around 387.5 m3/(kgPd h) in membrane reformer. Further work on stability investigation may develop an efficient on-site route of H2 production process for application to on-site power generation using PEMFC.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen production for application to proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) has been a focus of investigation worldwide recently [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Although large-scale H2 production from steam reforming of natural gas has been well established in chemical industry, the process is very complicated, including a series of reactions and operations with large temperature intervals. The main reactions during the process could be described as below.

If such a process was adopted for H2 production for application to PEMFC on much smaller scales, the cost of H2 would be unacceptable. Thus, H2 production from steam reforming, or autothermal reforming of natural gas at lower reaction temperatures has been an increasingly attractive topic and much effort has been made, aiming to develop efficient process for H2 production at much lower cost for application to PEMFC. However, methane steam reforming (MSR) reaction is thermodynamically limited, only low methane conversion could be obtained at low reaction temperatures in conventional fixed bed reactor. To efficiently decrease reaction temperature, thus reducing the requirement of construction materials and energy consumption, equilibria for reactions (1), (3) should be broken. As the major products in MSR reaction are H2 and CO2 at low reaction temperatures, selective removal of CO2 [11] or H2 [12] could readily meet the purpose. Calculation performed by setting a residual H2 ratio in equilibrium composition in MSR reaction showed that higher methane conversion could be obtained at lower reaction temperatures [13]. For example, methane conversion of 94.0% could be achieved, when 90.0% of H2 was removed from the reaction zone even at T = 773 K, P = 1000 kPa and H2O/CH4 = 3.0. Palladium membrane reactor, which has the particular H2 removal capability, has been studied for thermodynamically limited reactions such as dehydrogenation of methyl cyclo-hexane and propane [14], [15], [16], [17], MSR reaction [13], [18], [19], [20]. In those reactions, the dehydrogenation of alkane for alkene production had serious problems such as coke deposition and PdCx formation on the metallic film [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. While for MSR reaction, by the particular design of membrane reactor configuration, it was totally feasible to avoid those problems encountered in the dehydrogenation reactions using palladium membrane reactor. Moreover, a demonstration unit, which produced 40 m3/h PEMFC-grade H2, was established in Japan [26]. This greatly encouraged the research and development of Pd-based membrane reactor for MSR reaction. Economic evaluation of such process revealed that when the thickness of metallic palladium or palladium alloy films was less than 20 μm, the process is cost competitive in comparison with other processes [27]. This work studied MSR reaction in palladium membrane reformer using an ultra-thin, H2 ultra-permeable Pd-based membrane, a high temperature pre-reduced nickel-based catalyst developed by deposition–coprecipitation and a specially designed membrane reactor configuration which could prevent back permeation of H2. The influences of working conditions such as reaction temperature, reaction pressure, gas hourly space velocity (GHSV), steam-to-carbon feed ratio (S/C), sweep gas flux on the membrane reactor performances in terms of H2 production rate based on Pd, as well as the H2 permeation flux across the membrane near practical working conditions, were presented in detail and compared with some recent literature results to show that the catalyst may play an important role in determining performance of membrane reformer.
2. Experimental
2.1. Membrane preparation and characterization
The preparation of composite palladium membrane has been described in Ref. [28], [29]. Briefly, α-Al2O3 membrane support (I.D. = 6.2 mm and O.D. = 10.2 mm) was supplied by the Membrane Science and Technology Research Center, Nanjing University of Technology. The total length of the support was 300 mm, with 250 mm covered by glaze. The rest was porous part with average pore size of 500 nm. The support was washed using dilute hydrochloride solution, NaOH solution and then petroleum ether. After cleaning, the porous part of membrane support was modified using a sol–gel method [28]. The modified support was then dipped in an activation/sensitization solution OPC-50 inducer C and then in the OPC-150 cryster MU (Okuno Chemical Industries Co. Ltd. Japan), which was repeated for several times to deposit suitable amount of Pd0 crystallite on the support. After that, the porous part was placed in the plating bath (Okuno Chemical Industries Co. Ltd. Japan) for around 30.0 min, the plating process may repeat several times to get a thin, dense palladium composite membrane. The permeation property of membrane was evaluated with pure H2 and N2 at several temperatures in the range of 623–823 K.
2.2. Methane steam reforming in membrane reformer
The preparation, characterization and pretreatment of catalyst, self-made apparatus suitable for the study of permeation property for the membrane and the procedures to perform MSR reaction in membrane reformer, were described in Ref. [29]. The as-prepared membrane was located at the center of a stainless steel reactor with an inner diameter of 20.0 mm. Thus, an annulus chamber between the reactor and membrane was formed and applied as the reaction zone and retentate side of the membrane. The applied catalyst was pre-reduced at 1023 K, then gradually cooled down to room temperature, and finally charged to the membrane reformer with a catalyst bed height of 60.0 mm. Thus, the catalyst bed was extended 10.0 mm above the position where membrane separation started. Such a membrane reactor configuration was designed to prevent the backpermeation of H2 [30]. Methane conversion (
) was calculated according Eq. (4).
(4)
H2 yields were calculated using methane conversion and product selectivities according to Eq. (5).

For the fact that 1.0 mol CO2 generated corresponds to 4.0 mol H2 and 1.0 mol CO generated corresponds to 3.0 mol H2. The rate of H2 permeation (
) flux through the composite palladium membrane was defined as the volume of the gas permeated per unit membrane surface area in an hour, which were calculated using the gas flow rate in the permeation side, therefore, the unit for it is m3/(m2 h). The Pd-based pure H2 production capacity (
) was defined as the volume of H2 generated per unit mass Pd in an hour, possessing a unit of m3/(kgPd h). Recovery rate of hydrogen (
) was defined as the ratio between the hydrogen fluxes across the membrane (mL/min) to the hydrogen production rate (mL/min).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Performance of membrane
The permeation behavior of as-prepared Pd membrane was evaluated using pure H2 and N2 under the same working conditions of T = 773 K and pressure drop in the range of 100–350 kPa. The H2 permeance of the membrane reached 0.0086 mol/(m2 kPa s), while no permeation of N2 across palladium membrane was detected under the same conditions, suggesting almost infinite H2 selectivity. Based on the weight increment after plating and SEM characterization [28], the thickness of metallic film was estimated around 4.0 μm. The H2 permeation behavior under different pressure drops across the membrane and different temperatures were measured using a single gas method, too. The H2 permeation flux versus pressure drops across membrane at 773 K is shown in Fig. 1. Under wide range of pressure drops across membrane, H2 permeation flux was almost proportional to the pressure drops. The exponent value of H2 partial pressure was about 1.0, showing great derivation from the Sievert's law, which indicated that rate-determining step in H2 permeation across palladium membrane was H2 dissociative adsorption on palladium surface rather than the bulk diffusion, due to the fact that palladium membrane was only about 4.0 μm [28]. Furthermore, not only increase in H2 permeation flux with increasing pressure drop across membrane, but also a H2 flux of 0.86 mol m−2 s−1 at T = 773 K and 100 kPa pressure difference were obtained, significantly higher than the 0.26 mol m−2 s−1 for a 6.0 μm Pd membrane under similar working conditions reported by Tong et al. [31]. The influence of separation temperature on the ln F (F was the H2 permeance for the membrane with unit of mol/(m2 kPa s)) is shown in Fig. 2. The good linearity of the curve indicated that under test temperature range, there was no change of rate-determining steps for H2 permeation. From this Arrhenius plot, apparent activation energy of 14.9 kJ/mol for H2 permeation across the membrane was estimated, which agreed well with the results previously reported [19].

3.2. Hydrogen production capacity of membrane reformer
3.2.1. Effect of reaction temperature
The major advantage of palladium membrane reactor for H2 production was conversion enhancement of equilibrium-limited reactions by selective removal of products. In the case of MSR, membrane reactor can significantly enhance methane conversion at low reaction temperatures. However, when reaction temperature was below 673 K, the reforming reaction could not reach a satisfactory conversion level due to the relative slow reaction kinetics for MSR, and thermodynamic equilibrium could not be established efficiently. While removal of H2 through palladium membrane could only slightly shift reforming equilibrium due to the intrinsically favorable temperature influences when the reaction was performed over 973 K. Furthermore, high temperature may irreversibly destroy the palladium metallic membrane. Thus, reaction temperature in the range of 723–873 K was usually applied in membrane reformer. In such a temperature range, membrane separates H2 efficiently and higher methane conversion could be obtained. For instance, under working conditions of P = 900 kPa, GHSV = 4000 mL gcat−1 h−1, S/C = 3.0 and I = 2.6, which was near the practical application conditions,
reached 7.41 m3/(m2 h) at 723 K, as shown in Fig. 3, simultaneously,
reached 154.6 m3/(kgPd h). The thermodynamic control methane conversion was only 13.2%, while in the membrane reformer, methane conversion of 65.0% was obtained, selective removal of H2 enhanced methane conversion significantly and high-purity H2 could be produced compactly. Within 723–823 K, increase in reaction temperature monotonically increased H2 production rate, as well as the H2 permeation rate across membrane. This meant that higher temperature favored MSR reaction kinetics and H2 permeation, which resulted in higher separation efficiency. But impact of temperature became not as pronounced as that at lower temperatures. For instance, increase in temperature from 723 to 773 K enhanced
from 7.41 to 10.25 m3/(m2 h) and
from 154.6 to 213.6 m3/(kgPd h). While
only increased from 10.25 to 11.9 m3/(m2 h), and
from 213.6 to 248.1 m3/(kgPd h), when the reaction temperature was further increased from 773 to 823 K. As we know, performance of palladium membrane reactor was determined at least by three interrelated factors: (1) MSR reaction kinetics; (2) H2 separation efficiency; and (3) radial diffusion of H2 from reaction location to palladium membrane surface in the reaction side. By the combination of highly active steam reforming catalyst, high performance palladium membrane, and a countercurrent sweep gas design, methane conversion of 98.8%, and
of 95.4% was achieved under mild working conditions (T = 823 K, P = 900 kPa, GHSV = 4000 mL gcat−1 h−1, S/C = 3.0 and I = 2.6), which was about 93.7% of maximum theoretical H2 yield. At the same time,
and
were 11.9 m3/(m2 h) and 248.1 m3/(kgPd h). Besides the enhanced methane conversion, CO formation was efficiently suppressed, too. H2 selective removal also shifted WGS reaction described in Eq. (2) to the right side. Thus, a non-monotonic dependence of CO selectivity upon reaction temperature was observed within 723–823 K, e.g., CO selectivity first increased with reaction temperature within 723–773 K, and then showed a slight decrease within 773–823 K. But they were much lower than thermodynamic control ones.

3.2.2. Effect of reaction pressure
In a conventional fixed bed reactor, higher reaction pressure would result in decreased methane conversion, and lower CO selectivity due to the impact of the thermodynamic equilibria for MSR. However, in membrane reactor, this trend could be totally changed. Although higher reaction pressure is unfavorable for methane conversion at thermodynamic equilibrium, the increase in reaction pressure may lead to a higher H2 partial pressure in the reaction side, which increased the driving force for H2 permeation and enhanced H2 separation efficiency, thus higher methane conversion could be expected under certain working conditions. For example, Tong et al. [31] disclosed that the influence of reaction pressure on methane conversion was related with reaction GHSV at 100–300 kPa. At lower GHSV, an increase in pressures resulted in a higher methane conversion. While at reaction GHSV of 2000 mL gcat−1 h−1, a slight decrease of methane conversion was observed. In our previous work on higher hydrocarbons steam reforming in palladium membrane reactor, in the pressure range of 200–400 kPa, an increase of selectivity to methane was also found when reactions were carried out at T = 823 K, S/C = 2.7 and I = 0 [30], suggesting increasing reaction pressure was unfavorable for methane conversion under these working conditions. The simulation results reported by Gallucci et al. [20] also revealed that, for a membrane-aided reaction system, an increase of reaction pressure corresponds to either an increase or to a decrease in methane conversion, depending on the combination of pressure, temperature, and membrane thickness and reactor length. In our point of view, only when H2 separation efficiency improvement predominated over thermodynamic equilibrium effect, an increase in methane conversion could be expected when reaction pressure increased. The influences of reaction pressure on
and
in this work were investigated at T = 773 K, GHSV = 4000 mL gcat−1 h−1, S/C = 3.0 and I = 2.6 and the results are shown in Fig. 4. Increase in reaction pressure from 300 to 900 kPa resulted in monotonic
increase from 6.0 to 10.25 m3/(m2 h), and
from 125.4 to 213.6 m3/(kgPd h), accompanied with a monotonic methane conversion from 67.6% to 88.7%, while the thermodynamic control methane conversion were predicted to decrease from 29.3% to 19.4%. This agreed with results previously reported by Uemiya et al. [32] and Prokopiev et al. [33], e.g., methane conversion increased upon reaction pressure. In our work, higher reaction pressure also suppressed CO formation more efficiently [29]. Due to the ultra-thin property of the palladium membrane, increase in reaction pressure at T = 773 K, GHSV = 4000 mL gcat−1 h−1, S/C = 3.0 and I = 2.6 also monotonically enhanced the recovery rate of H2 from 71.0% at 300 kPa to 91.8% at 900 kPa. Thus, the influence of reaction pressure upon methane conversion was a compromise between the influence of thermodynamic equilibrium, and the H2 separation efficiency which functioned oppositely. The monotonic increase of methane conversion with increase in reaction pressure in this work indicated that, the separation efficiency of the palladium membrane is sufficiently high to dominate the performance of palladium membrane reactor under those conditions.

3.2.3. Effect of gas hourly space velocity
Generally, increase in reaction gas hourly space velocity means lower contact time for the catalyst and lower conversion. Higher reaction GHSV means a higher L/S (load-to-surface ratio, defined as inlet volumetric flux of methane relative to membrane area) for the membrane in membrane reformer, which was found unfavorable for methane conversion. On L/S influences, Lin et al. [34] predicted a decreased methane conversion with increasing L/S in the range of 0.1–10.0 m3 h−1 m−2, when the reaction was carried out at WHSV (weight hourly space velocity) less than 1.0 h−1, T = 773 K, P = 900 kPa or 2000 kPa and I = 0. Highest methane conversion of 85.8% was achieved under reaction conditions T = 773 K, P = 2000 kPa, WHSV = 0.3 h−1, L/S = 0.3 m3 h−1 m−2 and I = 0. In our membrane reformer, a monotonic decrease of methane conversion with increasing reaction GHSV was observed. Methane conversion decreased from 98.6% to 86.0%, when reaction GHSV increased from 4000 to 8000 mL gcat−1 h−1. However,
and
were found monotonically increased with reaction GHSV, as could be seen in Fig. 5. For instance,
and
were 10.25 m3/(m2 h) and 213.6 m3/(kgPd h) at a GHSV of 4000 mL gcat−1 h−1, they increased to 18.6 m3/(m2 h) and 387.5 m3/(kgPd h) at a GHSV of 8000 mL gcat−1 h−1. Higher reaction GHSV increased the L/S for the membrane but decreased residence time, e.g., it shortened the time for the H2 produced in the reaction to diffuse from reaction location to membrane surface, and thus lower H2 recovery rate could be expected. For instance, under the investigated working conditions, recovery rate of H2 was 95.4% at GHSV = 4000 mL gcat−1 h−1, it decreased to 90.1% and 85.0% at GHSV = 6000, 8000 mL gcat−1 h−1, respectively. In our membrane reformer, the higher GHSV, the higher CO selectivity was observed. CO selectivity was only 2.4% at GHSV = 4000 mL gcat−1 h−1 and it increased to 6.3% at GHSV of 8000 mL gcat−1 h−1. Besides the effect of reaction kinetics, another physical process—radial mixing diffusion of H2 from the reaction location to the palladium membrane surface in a packed-bed type of membrane reactor would also impact the membrane separation efficiency, and this process was closely related to residence time. Itoh et al. [35] found that calculation based on ideal flow model would give higher separation efficiency than calculation results based on radial diffusion model. Thus, it could be assumed that when the permeance of the palladium membrane was sufficiently high and the kinetics of the catalyst fast enough, performances of the membrane reformer would be determined by neither the kinetics of catalyst nor the H2 permeation across the membrane. Instead, the physical process, radial diffusion of H2 from reaction location to palladium membrane surface, may determine the performances of membrane reactor. However, this could be solved by using hollow fiber membranes or capillary membrane module to shorten the diffusion path [36]. Under our reaction conditions, as the catalyst applied was highly active, and the palladium membrane could permeate H2 through fast enough, we ascribed the moderate decrease of methane conversions, largely to the influence of radial diffusion time shortening, which are to be confirmed by modeling. Of course, other effects such as concentration polarization would also result in a lower separation efficiency which was inevitable in gas mixture separation [37]. When reaction GHSV increased, H2 flux across membrane also increased, thus the concentration polarization effects are more severe. Despite the multiply factors that may decreased the H2 permeation flux across the membrane, a high
of 18.6 m3/(m2 h) and
of 387.5 m3/(kgPd h) were achieved at a GHSV of 8000 mL gcat−1 h−1. Powering a PEMFC of 50 kW only needs separation membrane surface less than 3.0 m2 and palladium metal less than 0.13 kg using such a fuel processor.

3.2.4. Effect of steam-to-carbon feed ratio
Usually, MSR reaction was carried out above a stoichiometric S/C to avoid carbon deposition over catalysts, which also enhance the MSR forward reaction. In conventional fixed bed reactor, S/C in the range of 3.0–5.0 is applied. While in membrane reformer, on one hand, lower reaction temperature would promise a lower S/C ratio to avoid carbon deposition; on the other hand, due to the selective removal of H2 by palladium membrane and high selectivity to CO2, S/C higher than 2.0 are necessary. So, S/C for MSR reaction in membrane reactor was usually kept within 2.0–4.0. The effect of S/C ratio on
and
obtained at T = 823 K, P = 500 kPa and GHSV of methane = 1000 mL gcat−1 h−1 is shown in Fig. 6. In conventional fixed bed reactor, methane conversion increases monotonically with increasing S/C. Although the same trend was observed in our membrane reformer, e.g., increase in S/C from 2.5 to 3.5 led to methane conversion increment from 93.8% to 99.0%. But the H2 recovery rate does not change monotonically with increasing S/C. Actually, a decrease of recovery from 97.5% to about 94% was found in our experimental conditions when the S/C was increased from 2.5 to 3.5.
and
also showed a non-monotonic relationship with S/C.
increased from 11.47 to 11.92 m3/(m2 h), and
increased from 238.9 to 248.8 m3/(kgPd h), when the S/C increased from 2.5 to 3.0. However, they decreased to 11.8 m3/(m2 h) and 245.5 m3/(kgPd h), respectively, when S/C ratio further increased to 3.5. Lower CO selectivity was also observed at a higher S/C. At S/C of 2.5, the CO selectivity was 6.5% while thermodynamic control one was 11.8%; at S/C of 3.5, the corresponding values were 2.4% and 10.5%, respectively. The results suggested that too large an excess of steam dilutes the H2 in the mixture of products, which resulted in a decrease of the H2 partial pressure drop across the membrane and thus in a lower recovery rate of H2. Shu et al. [13] gave a detailed investigation on the effects of S/C on methane conversion in Pd-based membrane reactors. The trend that higher S/C resulted in higher methane conversion at T = 773 K, P = 136 kPa, GHSV = 1067 h−1 and I = 1.0, was also found. Calculation made by Jorgensen et al. [38] showed that by keeping S/C higher than 2.5, it was possible to avoid carbon deposition, even if H2 was largely removed from reaction at 773 K. So, in our work, S/C was kept around 3.0 and no carbon deposition was found.

3.2.5. Effect of sweep gas flux
A sweep gas is important to maintain a higher H2 partial pressure drop across membrane to promote H2 permeation and recovery rate of H2, especially when reaction pressure is low. Generally, a higher sweep ratio promises a higher permeation flux across the membrane [2], [3]. The influence of sweep ratio on
and
were investigated at T = 823 K, P = 500 kPa, GHSV = 6000 mL gcat−1 h−1 and S/C = 3.0, and the results are shown in Fig. 7.
significantly increased from 6.86 to 12.75 m3/(m2 h) and
from 142.7 to 266.7 m3/(kgPd h), when the sweep ratio increased from 0 to 1.7. However, increase in the sweep ratio from 1.7 to 3.4 only resulted in
increase from 12.75 to 13.5 m3/(m2 h), and
increase from 266.7 to 280.7 m3/(kgPd h). The fast leveling off of sweep gas influences on
,
, may be related with the sweep gas design mode. As previously reported [30], a countercurrent sweep gas design brought out an almost zero H2 partial pressure at the position where membrane separation ended irrespective of sweep ratio. The leveling off of sweep ratio effect was also found in previous investigations [13], [32]. Simulation models build by Oklany et al. [39] also predicted the same trend, too. The sweep gas design mode also had great influences on the H2 partial pressure distributions in the permeate side along the axis of the palladium membrane. In a co-current sweep gas mode, the H2 partial pressure in the reaction side first increases along the catalyst bed, then decreases when H2 flux through palladium membrane was higher than H2 production rate. While in the permeate side, H2 partial pressure increases along the axis of the palladium membrane due to the accumulation of H2 along the axis of the membrane. As the permeance of the palladium membrane was sufficiently high, the driving force for H2 permeation at the position where the separation ended was supposed to greatly affect the separation efficiency of the palladium membrane. Co-current sweep gas would result in a higher H2 partial pressure at the position where membrane separation ended than a countercurrent sweep in the permeate side. So, a higher separation efficiency and H2 recovery rate could be expected, when a countercurrent sweep gas was designed, instead of a concurrent sweep gas. The high H2 recovery and high separation efficiency were attributed to the combination of the high permeance of the palladium membrane with the sweep gas operated in a countercurrent mode.

Generally, the performances of palladium membrane reformer are closely related to the performance of membrane, catalyst applied, working conditions and special design of membrane reformer configuration. Almost complete methane conversion could be achieved under mild working conditions, simultaneously obtaining
as high as 18.6 m3/(m2 h) and
of around 387.5 m3/(kgPd h), much better than previous results of fixed bed membrane reformer, as revealed in Table 1. Furthermore, the membrane reformer also showed better performances than the fluidized-bed membrane reformer [1]. They obtained H2 permeation flux of 4.8–12.0 m3/(m2 h) for MSR reaction, and 9.0–18.0 m3/(m2 h) for methane autothermal reforming, which was claimed significantly better than previous results. However, they utilized reaction temperature 773–873 K and pressure 1500–2600 kPa, which were much more stringent working conditions than ours, while methane conversion achieved was still relative low. However, in this work, H2 permeation flux was achieved under mild working conditions. The ultra-thin property of the membrane guaranteed the economics of the process, as well as the excellent Pd-based H2 production capacity. Particularly, it primarily revealed that a highly active catalyst used in membrane reformer significantly promoted the Pd-based H2 production capacity, which was critical for the practical application of membrane reformer. However, in our experiment, we found the ultra-thin palladium membrane was intolerable to fast thermal cycling, which may prevent the application of such process to portable or automobile systems. Thus, we proposed that the process might find its application to on-site H2 production for application to proton exchange membrane fuel cells, using the widely available natural gas infrastructure.

4. Conclusions
A fixed bed membrane reformer for methane steam reforming reaction was established and investigated experimentally. The high permeance of the palladium composite membrane, good catalytic activity of the catalyst for methane steam reforming, and a countercurrent sweep gas design, guaranteed the high production capacity of the membrane reformer, e.g., not only near complete conversion of methane, over 95% H2 recovery rate, but also high permeation flux across the palladium membrane could be obtained under mild working conditions. For instance, H2 separation capacity as high as 18.6 m3/(m2 h) for the palladium membrane and pure H2 production capacity of about 387.5 m3/(kgPd h) were obtained near practical working conditions. It was found that stress during fast thermal cycling may irreversibly deteriorate the membrane, thus, such a process may practically applied to the on-site power generation systems using proton exchange membrane fuel cells.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
