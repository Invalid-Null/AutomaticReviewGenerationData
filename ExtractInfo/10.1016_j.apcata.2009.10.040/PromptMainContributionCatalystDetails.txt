Dehydrogenation of n-butane over Pd–Ga/Al2O3 catalysts
Abstract
Dehydrogenation of n-butane over alumina-supported Pd and Pd–Ga catalysts was studied. Catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation with a Pd content of 0.66 wt% and atomic Ga/Pd ratios from 0 to ∞, using aqueous solutions of PdCl2 and Ga(NO3)3. Fresh (uncalcined) and calcined catalysts were characterized by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), N2 adsorption, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), CO and H2 chemisorptions and O2/H2 titrations. n-Butane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out at 500 °C, atmospheric pressure and a H2/C4H10 ratio of 10. An increase in the Pd dispersion with increasing Ga content was observed for the fresh catalysts, according to CO chemisorption results. H2 chemisorption and H2/O2 titrations were not reliable methods to determine the Pd dispersion in the fresh catalysts. For the calcined catalysts with low Ga contents, the CO/Pd, H/Pd and O/Pd values were very similar, but different for those with the higher Ga contents. These differences were explained based on the presence of chlorine. Coke deposition produced the deactivation of the catalysts and inhibited hydrogenolysis reactions on Pd, favoring the dehydrogenation selectivity. In the fresh catalysts, the Ga addition caused an effect similar to that produced by coke, reducing the activity and increasing the dehydrogenation selectivity. In the calcined catalysts, the effect of Ga addition on activity was diminished by the calcination treatment. The combination of calcination and high Ga content led to a catalyst with enhanced activity and very high dehydrogenation selectivity.

Dehydrogenation of n-butane over alumina-supported Pd–Ga catalysts was studied. In the reduced catalysts (without a previous calcination), the Ga addition caused an effect similar to that produced by coke, that is, it reduced the activity and increased the dehydrogenation selectivity. The effect of Ga addition on catalytic activity was partially inhibited by the calcination treatment. At higher Ga contents, the calcination led to catalysts with enhanced activities and very high dehydrogenation selectivities.

1. Introduction
The importance of catalytic dehydrogenation of paraffins to olefins has been growing due to the demand for these unsaturated hydrocarbons. Light olefins, such as butenes, are essential raw materials used to obtain polymers, gasoline additives and other chemical products. Butenes can be obtained in plants of n-butane catalytic dehydrogenation, as secondary products in steam cracking and catalytic cracking units, among other processes. Catalytic dehydrogenation of paraffins is a selective method to produce alkenes. However, the conversion of paraffins to the corresponding olefins is limited by thermodynamics restrictions due to the strong endothermic character of the reaction. High temperatures (530–730 °C) are required to reach conversions of nearly 50% for paraffins C2–C6 [1]. The dehydrogenation temperatures are higher for light paraffins than for heavy ones. Consequently, lateral reactions of cracking to lighter hydrocarbons and coking are favored at these high temperatures, causing a decrease in the selectivity towards desired products.
Alumina-supported Pt catalysts have been used in the dehydrogenation of light paraffins, being very active but little selective and strongly deactivated by the formation of coke. For this reason, the catalytic stability and selectivity of this system can be improved with the incorporation of a second metal, such as Sn [2], [3]. A catalytic system based on Pd can be an alternative to the more expensive metals, such as Pt. The use of Pd/Al2O3 catalysts for the dehydrogenation of a hydrocarbon was first reported in 1973 to produce benzene from cyclohexane [4]. Recently, the dehydrogenation of propane was used to study supported Pd catalysts, which without modifications presented the same problems mentioned for Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, and the addition of a second metal (Sn) improved the catalytic properties of these systems [5]. In literature, it has been reported an enhancement in the selectivity towards propylene when Ga is added to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts [3] and ZSM-5 zeolites [6].
The objective of this work is to study the effects of the addition of Ga and calcination treatment on the catalytic behavior of Pd/Al2O3 catalysts in the n-butane dehydrogenation reaction. Catalysts were characterized by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), N2 adsorption, temperature programmed reduction (TPR), CO and H2 chemisorptions and O2/H2 titrations.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation and characterization
The monometallic Pd/Al2O3 and Ga/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of γ-Al2O3 (supplied by IFP) with a hydrochloric solution of PdCl2 (>99%, Fisher) and an aqueous solution of Ga(NO3)3·xH2O (>99.9%, Alfa), respectively. The wet solids were dried at 70 °C in a rotavapor and then at 120 °C overnight in a furnace. Before impregnation, the γ-Al2O3 support (60/80 mesh) was calcined at 700 °C for 2 h. The bimetallic Pd–Ga/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by impregnation of the Pd/Al2O3 catalyst with the appropriate amounts of an aqueous solution of Ga(NO3)3·xH2O to obtain Ga/Pd atomic ratios of 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2. The catalyst samples dried at 120 °C were designated as “fresh catalysts”, and those calcined at 550 °C as “calcined catalysts”. These designations did not change for the reduced catalysts. The Pd and Ga contents were measured by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (EDX) using a Shimadzu EDX-700HS spectrometer. The chemical compositions of the catalysts used in the present study are given in Table 1, along with the Ga/Pd atomic ratios.

The BET surface areas of the support and the catalysts were determined from the N2 adsorption isotherms at −196 °C using an automatic Micromeritics ASAP 2010 apparatus after the samples were outgassed at 120 °C overnight. The specific surface areas of all the catalysts are also listed in Table 1.
TPR experiments were carried out using a stainless steel apparatus provided with a TCD, using a gaseous mixture of 5% H2/Ar (Praxair) at a flow of 30 ml/min (reducing gas) and a catalyst sample of 100 mg. The sample was dried at 120 °C or calcined at 550 °C for 1 h in a flow of air (30 ml/min) and then was cooled to −80 °C using a cold trap (isopropyl alcohol and liquid nitrogen). At this temperature, the reactor was purged with flowing Ar, and the TCD signal was stabilized in the flow of the reducing gas before starting heating. The sample was spontaneously heated from −80 °C to RT by removing the cold trap and then to 700 °C at 10 °C/min using a furnace.
The measurements of CO and H2 chemisorptions were determined at RT and 80 °C, respectively, by the pulse method, using the same TPR apparatus, which was equipped with a gas injection valve (Valco). The catalyst sample was dried or calcined as explained before, and then reduced in a flow of H2 (20 ml/min) at 500 °C for 1 h. Then, the reactor temperature was kept at 300 °C in an Ar flow (H2 chemisorption) or a He flow (CO chemisorption) for 30 min to remove the adsorbed hydrogen. The pulses were sent to the reactor until reaching the saturation. O2/H2 titrations were carried out after H2 chemisorption at 80 °C. O2 pulses were sent to the reactor to titrate the chemisorbed hydrogen. Then, H2 pulses were sent to the reactor to titrate adsorbed oxygen.
2.2. Catalytic activity measurements
The n-butane dehydrogenation reaction was carried out in a fixed bed reactor at 500 °C and 1 atm under differential conditions. A feed with a H2/n-C4H10 molar ratio of 10 was used. The catalyst sample (20 mg) was dried or calcined and reduced, as explained before. The analyses were performed in a Perkin-Elmer AutoSystem gas chromatograph, equipped with a 0.19% picric acid/Carbograph packed column and FID detector.
3. Results and discussion
The TPR profiles of the fresh catalysts are shown in Fig. 1. The monometallic Pd catalyst (Pd(F)) shows a reduction peak at 153 °C, which is ascribed to the reduction of PdCl2. This assignment differs from that proposed by Chandra et al. [7], who detected HCl at ca. 150 °C during the TPR run of a fresh Pd/Al2O3 catalyst. They considered that the reduction of PdCl2 on alumina occurred at room temperature and the formed HCl appeared to be adsorbed on alumina surface at lower temperatures and then desorbed at 150 °C. In the present work, no H2 consumption was observed at temperatures below 150 °C for the mentioned catalyst and, therefore, the formation and desorption of HCl occurred simultaneously at 153 °C as a result of PdCl2 reduction at this temperature. In order to support this statement, an additional TPR experiment was carried out using a 0.35%Pd/SiO2 catalyst prepared by impregnation with a PdCl2 solution. Again, an only reduction peak also centered at 153 °C was observed, and the H2 consumption (expressed as a H2/Pd ratio) was 1.06, as expected for the reduction of this Pd salt.

Fig. 1. TPR profiles of the fresh Pd, Ga and Pd–Ga catalysts.
The monometallic Ga catalyst shows a reduction peak at 393 °C (Fig. 1). This peak can be attributed to the reduction of Ga(NO3)3. In the fresh Pd–Ga/Al2O3 catalysts, the temperature of the peak attributed to the PdCl2 reduction increased with the smaller dose of Ga to 174 °C and then decreased for higher Ga contents up to 131 °C, while the peak intensity increased continuously with the Ga content. These results can be attributed to the simultaneous reduction of PdCl2 and Ga(NO3)3, where Pd0 catalytically assisted the reduction of the Ga salt. An additional catalyst (Pd0.49Ga(F)) was prepared in order to confirm the observed tendencies in the reduction temperature and peak intensity.
The TPR profiles of calcined catalysts are showed in Fig. 2. The calcination treatment produced the segregation of the palladium and gallium oxides since several peaks with different temperatures were observed. The calcined monometallic Pd catalyst showed a reduction peak at 18 °C, which has been attributed to the reduction of crystalline PdO to Pd0 [5], and a peak at 110 °C, which can be ascribed to the reduction of smaller PdO particles interacting with the support. A wide particle-size distribution of these PdO particles is indicated by the great broadness of the last peak. In the literature, reduction peaks at higher temperatures were associated with small PdO particles. Finol et al. [8] ascribed a peak at 250 °C to the reduction of PdO species stabilized strongly by the support. Lieske and Völter [9] attributed a peak at 300 °C to the reduction of a surface complex of PdO interacting strongly with the support. The calcined monometallic Ga/Al2O3 catalyst showed no reduction peak up to 700 °C, indicating that the Ga2O3 species are reduced at higher temperatures.

Fig. 2. TPR profiles of the calcined Pd, Ga and Pd–Ga catalysts.
The calcined bimetallic catalysts exhibited two additional reduction peaks at 316 and 460 °C, which shifted toward lower temperatures, 290 and 435 °C, respectively, and increased their intensity by increasing Ga content. The first peak could be due to the reduction of Ga2O3 species in close proximity with Pd0 particles, and the second one to the reduction of Ga2O3 species located far from Pd0. In both cases, it is possible that H2 spillover from the Pd particles initiates Ga2O3 reduction. The Ga2O3 species were formed during catalyst calcination [10]. The negative peak attributed to the decomposition of the β-PdHx phase it is not clearly distinguished in the TPR profiles corresponding to the calcined catalysts, due to its overlapping with the peak of 110 °C [11].
Table 2 presents the values of CO/Pd, H/Pd and O/Pd molar ratios, along with the values of HT/OT and HC/HT molar ratios. In the fresh catalysts, the CO/Pd values indicate the Pd dispersion was low for the Pd(F) catalyst and increased with the addition of Ga, reaching a maximum for the catalyst containing 0.29% Ga, and then decreased for the catalyst with the higher Ga content (0.72%). This behavior could be caused by a dispersing effect of the Ga salt at low contents on Pd, but a very slight blockage of Pd surface could occur for the highest amount of Ga added to the Pd(F) catalyst. Jablonski et al. [3] reported that higher additions of Ga than 0.44% on Pt catalysts obstructed the Pt sites, producing a diminution in the adsorption of CO and H2. For the calcined catalyst, the dispersion was, in general, slightly higher than for the fresh ones. This effect can be associated to the formation of PdxOyClz species during the catalyst calcination, and these species are considered as mobile complexes that spread over alumina surface and improve Pd dispersion upon reduction [9], [12]. Gaspar and Dieguez [12] detected by FTIR and XPS the formation of such species in calcined Pd/Al2O3 catalysts prepared with PdCl2. The higher dispersion of Pd0.72Ga(C) with respect to its fresh counterpart indicates that Pd and Ga oxides were segregated after calcination as suggested by TPR results.

For all the fresh catalysts, the values of H/Pd ratio estimated from H2 chemisorption (HC) were significantly higher than those of CO/Pd ratio. These differences are attributable neither to the formation of β-PdHx phase, because hydrogen absorption does not occur at the used temperature (80 °C) for H2 chemisorption, nor to the adsorption of H2 on Ga, since the monometallic (Ga-free) Pd catalyst also presented the same behavior. But, such differences can be attributed to the reaction of a fraction of the consumed hydrogen with the Cl− species remaining at the metal–support interface after reduction and the adsorption of the produced species (HCl) on the support. This can cause higher H2 consumptions than those required for adsorption only. It is known that alumina support retains chlorides after a reduction treatment at high temperatures. For example, the Cl− contents of the Pd0.29Ga(F) catalyst determined before and after reduction at 500 °C were 0.44 and 0.14 wt%, respectively. Therefore, an amount of remaining chlorides of 39.5 μmol Cl−/gcat can be estimated for the reduced catalyst, which is high compared to the hydrogen uptake (HC = 36.0 μmol H/gcat) determined in the HC measurement and to the total amount of Pd (62.0 μmol/gcat) present in the catalyst. This can suggest that chloride ions present on the surface of the fresh catalysts could promote an extra H2 consumption, which would lead to an overestimation of Pd dispersion if a H:Pd adsorption stoichiometry of 1:1, which has been widely accepted [13], is assumed.
The presence of Cl− in the fresh catalysts also produced very low values of O/Pd ratio, being considerably smaller than the CO/Pd values. These low O/Pd ratios do not mean that the Pd surface was not completely saturated with oxygen, but that the amounts of adsorbed oxygen (Oads = OT − Oreact) used to calculate such ratios were underestimated as a result of the overestimation of the amounts of oxygen that reacted (Oreact = 1/2HC) with hydrogen pulsed during chemisorption to form water. It was mentioned that HC values were augmented by the extra H2 consumption, which reacted with Cl− species during hydrogen chemisorption and, therefore, was not available to react with oxygen pulsed during subsequent titration. The very low O/Pd ratios mean that extra H2 consumptions were significantly large and led to wrong calculations of the amount of adsorbed oxygen on Pd.
The effect of Cl− can also be appreciable in the low values of HT/OT ratio (1.2–1.9) and high values of HC/HT ratio (≥1), compared with the theoretical values (2.0 and 0.33, respectively), after assuming adsorption stoichiometries of H:Pd and O:Pd of 1:1 [13].
The H/Pd values estimated from hydrogen titration (HT) for the fresh catalysts are lower than those calculated from HC, but even higher than CO/Pd values. The decrease in the H/Pd ratio observed in the sequence HC-OT-HT can be due to a diminution in the amount of hydrogen reacting with Cl− ions still present at the metal–support interface.
Contrasting with the fresh catalysts, for the calcined catalysts with the lower Ga contents, the values of CO/Pd, H/Pd and O/Pd ratios are very similar and, moreover, the values of HT/OT and HC/HT ratios are very similar to the theoretical ones, obtained after considering H:Pd and O:Pd adsorption stoichiometries of 1:1 [13]. This could be caused by the complete elimination or strong diminution in the Cl− content in the catalysts after calcination. In fact, the Cl− content determined for Pd(C) and Pd0.16Ga(C) catalysts was about 0.01 wt% (equivalent to 2.8 μmol Cl−/gcat), which can be considered very low. In consequence, there was not reaction of the adsorbed hydrogen with Cl− species and the amount of adsorbed oxygen was appropriately estimated. The similarity among CO/Pd, H/Pd and O/Pd ratios and of HT/OT and HC/HT ratios to their corresponding theoretical values suggest that the global CO:Pd adsorption stoichiometry is, in this case, equal to 1:1. The calcined catalysts with the higher Ga contents (>0.16%) showed, according to CO/Pd and O/Pd values, an increment in the dispersion, but this is in contradiction with the decrease in H/Pd ratios, where the corresponding values of HT/OT and HC/HT ratios are lower than the theoretical values. In this case, the presence of Ga at higher loadings caused this discrepancy.
The catalytic activity (TOF) of the fresh and calcined catalysts at 500 °C as a function of time on-stream (TOS) are shown in Fig. 3. The TOF values were estimated based on the CO chemisorption results, assuming CO:Pd adsorption stoichiometry of 1:1. The Pd(F) catalyst deactivated very fast in the first 20 min of TOS, and then the activity decreased slowly (Fig. 3A). This deactivation can be attributed to the coke deposition on the catalyst surface, blocking the most active Pd sites [5]. This behavior has also been observed for other active metals, like Pt, in n-butane dehydrogenation reaction [14]. The initial activity and deactivation rate decreased with the addition of Ga, where the catalyst with the highest Ga content (0.72%, Ga/Pd = 1.68) reached the smallest activity and a negligible deactivation rate. These effects of the Ga addition on the catalytic behavior of Pd can be explained in terms of electronic effects. Ga atoms can withdraw electronic density from Pd atoms due to its higher electronegativity and, in consequence, modify the catalytic properties of this active metal. The TPR and chemisorption results showed that Ga was in an intimate contact with Pd and increased the Pd dispersion (at least until a content of 0.29% Ga) in the fresh catalysts. However, a contribution of geometric effects of Ga on the catalytic activity of Pd cannot completely be ruled out.

In general, the deactivation rate of the calcined catalysts was higher than that corresponding to the fresh ones, and less dependent on the Ga content (Fig. 3B) compared to the fresh catalysts (Fig. 3A). Among the calcined catalysts, the catalyst with the higher Ga content (Pd0.72Ga(C)) showed the lowest initial activity and deactivation rate. These results can be associated to the segregation of Pd and Ga, both as oxides, caused by the calcination treatment. In comparison with the fresh catalysts, the TPR results showed that a smaller amount of Ga, present as Ga2O3 in the calcined catalysts, was reduced after reduction and, in consequence, less Ga species were modifying the catalytic behavior of Pd.
Fig. 4 presents the selectivity of dehydrogenation and hydrogenolysis as a function of TOS for the fresh and calcined catalysts. In general, the catalysts exhibited an increase in the dehydrogenation selectivity with the TOS in parallel with a diminution of the hydrogenolysis selectivity. This can be attributed to a preferential blockage by coke of the Pd sites that are more active for the hydrogenolysis reactions. Additionally, all the catalysts showed an increase in the dehydrogenation selectivity with increasing Ga content at the expenses of the hydrogenolysis selectivity and, in fact, the catalyst with the highest Ga content (Pd0.72Ga(F)) did not show hydrogenolysis products from the beginning of the reaction. These results can also be explained in terms of electronic effects of Ga on Pd. However, Jablonski et al. [3] attributed an enhancement in the selectivity to propylene with the Ga addition to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts in the propane dehydrogenation reaction to the geometric and electronic modifications of the metallic phase by Ga, leading to a low hydrogenolytic activity. On the other hand, Machado et al. [15] observed the same effect of Ga in a Pt/Ga-MCM-41 catalyst, and suggested that Ga segregated to extra-framework positions might exercise a kind of geometric effect on Pt clusters, inhibiting hydrogenolysis reactions.

The initial dehydrogenation selectivity was higher for the fresh Pd(F) catalyst (48%) than for its calcined Pd(C) equivalent (32%). This can be related to the fact that Pd dispersion was lower for the fresh catalyst than for the calcined one, according with CO chemisorption results (Table 2). Arteaga et al. [16] observed a clear decrease in the dehydrogenation selectivity with increasing Pd dispersion in Pd/Al2O3 catalysts, this being opposed to the trend exhibited by supported Pt catalysts [17]. The fresh catalysts containing Ga also showed higher initial dehydrogenation selectivity (lower initial hydrogenolysis selectivity) than the corresponding calcined catalysts. This superiority of the fresh catalysts in catalyzing dehydrogenation reactions, can explain the high activities of these catalysts in comparison with the calcined ones. The calcination treatment could partially inhibit the effect of the Ga addition on the activity and selectivity of Pd. This is in agreement with the TPR and chemisorption results, which evidenced that, after calcination, Pd and Ga oxides were partially segregated since two peaks are attributable to Ga2O3 reduction. This thermal treatment, which is generally used for the regeneration of spent catalysts to remove the coke, can promote changes in the surface composition of the bimetallic catalysts, and their catalytic performance can be negatively affected after the final activation stage. However, the catalyst with the higher Ga content subjected to calcination (Pd0.72Ga(C)), compared to its fresh counterpart, maintained its very high dehydrogenation selectivity (100%), increased its catalytic activity, and showed a relative low deactivation rate.
4. Conclusions
The simultaneous reduction of PdCl2 and Ga(NO3)3 species occurred in the fresh bimetallic Pd–Ga catalysts, where Pd0 assisted catalytically the reduction of Ga salt. The different reduction peaks observed in the calcined bimetallic catalysts indicate a segregation of Pd and Ga oxides during calcination. The Ga2O3 species could be reduced in the calcined bimetallic catalysts at temperatures lower than 700 °C due to the presence of Pd0 particles.
The addition of Ga increased the Pd dispersion of the fresh (uncalcined) catalysts, except for the higher Ga content (0.72%, Ga/Pd = 1.68). The calcination treatment caused an increase in the dispersion of the catalysts, probably due to the formation of PdOxCly species, which improve the dispersion. H2 chemisorption and H2/O2 titrations are not reliable methods to determine the Pd dispersion in the fresh catalysts. For the calcined catalysts with low Ga contents (≤0.16%), the CO/Pd, H/Pd and O/Pd values were very similar, but different for those with the higher Ga contents.
The monometallic Pd catalyst showed the highest activities and deactivation rates caused by the deposition of coke. The addition of Ga reduced the initial activity and deactivation. Calcination partially suppressed the effect of Ga addition on the catalytic behavior, since the calcined catalysts presented a lower dependency of Ga content on activity than the fresh catalysts. The Ga addition enhanced dehydrogenation selectivity, inhibiting hydrogenolysis reactions on Pd. Coke had a similar effect. The catalyst with the higher Ga content subjected to calcination presented an enhanced catalytic performance.
