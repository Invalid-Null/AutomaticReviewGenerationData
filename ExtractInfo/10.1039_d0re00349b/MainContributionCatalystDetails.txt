Unfortunately, none of the provided documents contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation catalysts. All the documents are reviews focused on SAPO-34 zeolite membranes and membrane reactor applications, with no original research data presented on PDH or ODH catalysts. Since there is no pertinent information to extract, I am unable to provide a synthesized summary in the requested XML structure. The <Relevance> tag indicates that no relevant details could be identified from the given set of documents. Please provide documents containing substantial original research findings on propane dehydrogenation catalysis in order to generate a meaningful XML output summary.
