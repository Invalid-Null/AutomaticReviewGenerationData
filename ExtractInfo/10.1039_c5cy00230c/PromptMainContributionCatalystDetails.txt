Insights into the effects of steam on propane dehydrogenation over a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst†
Catalytic propane dehydrogenation over an alumina supported Pt catalyst in the presence of steam is carried out and it is found that the catalyst activity is increased and the apparent activation energy is lowered due to the presence of steam. Three possible mechanisms, i.e. co-adsorption, Langmuir–Hinshelwood and Eley–Rideal, of changes in energetics and pathways for propane dehydrogenation due to the presence of steam are explored by DFT calculation. The results show that co-adsorption of C3 species with surface oxygenated species would elevate dehydrogenation energy barriers due to repulsive interactions between them. Surface –OH is more active than surface –O in activating the C–H bond in propane and propyl species through either the Langmuir–Hinshelwood or Eley–Rideal mechanism and plays an important role in propane dehydrogenation with steam. The Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism is kinetically favorable, in which the activations of the first H in propane by surface −OH are the rate determining steps, but the activation energies are higher than that on a clean Pt(111) surface. The observed enhanced catalyst's activity is ascribed to the lowered coking rates as well as the changes in surface coverage due to the co-adsorption of water and the surface oxygenated species.
1. Introduction
Propene is an important building block for a wide range of commodities and specialty chemicals.1–4 Now, traditional ways of producing it can no longer meet the ever-growing need. As natural gas supplies are increasing due to the rising exploration of shale gas,5 there has been growing interest in recent years in the on-purpose production of propene from propane dehydrogenation (PDH) technologies. Tens of PDH factories with a total capacity of over 10 million tons are built all over the world.6
Supported platinum catalysts are used in several commercialized PDH technologies,7e.g. Oleflex, STAR, etc. and proven by experimental and theoretical studies to be the most active catalyst for PDH due to their high density of electronic states close to the Fermi level.8–10 Large research efforts have been devoted to trying to promote the performance of Pt catalysts by introducing promoters or using different kinds of supports.11–13 However, coking and deactivation of this kind of catalyst are still inevitable problems.14
In industrial practice, the co-feed of hydrogen7,15–18 or steam19 with propane is used to enhance the performance of platinum-based catalysts. The presence of hydrogen can contribute to higher propene selectivity and lower coking rates.15–17 Using DFT calculation, Hauser et al.20 and Yang et al.21 have proven that the presence of surface hydrogen atoms can shift the third C–H cleavage step to a higher value, making it less competitive with the preferred alkene desorption step and thus improving dehydrogenation selectivity at the cost of elevating activation energies. However, introducing hydrogen into the PDH process seems to be unfavorable from an engineering point of view since it would decrease the equilibrium conversion and increase the compression energy consumption for the following separation process.
Steam has been widely used as an energy carrier, a coke remover and a diluent in dehydrogenation processes.19,22,23 Introducing steam into the feed can strengthen PDH processes by increasing the propane equilibrium conversion and lowering the temperature drop of the adiabatic dehydrogenation reactors.19 Dong et al.24 found that under the same propane partial pressure, steam can contribute to higher propene yield compared with that in nitrogen atmosphere. However, the results reported by Fattahi et al.25 and our group26 have shown that the promoting effect of steam on PDH over an alumina supported Pt–Sn catalyst is only valid at a certain range of amount of steam.
For the purpose of taking advantage of the best merits of steam, several terms should be addressed. For one thing, platinum-based catalysts used in steam atmosphere need to be designed carefully to avoid the sintering of Pt particles.27,28 Beyond this, the critical role of steam in the dehydrogenation kinetics over Pt surfaces should be illustrated to help determine the optimum operating conditions and provide some insights into the basic principles for catalyst design. Unfortunately, these questions are still poorly understood and consensus has hardly been reached. In the kinetic model for PDH in steam atmosphere developed by Luu et al.29 over a tin-modified Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, steam was involved in the dominator of their second-order kinetic model. However, to interpret similar retarding effects of steam, some other authors25,27,28 suggested that sintering of platinum particles was the reason for the observed activity decrease. Several authors25,28,30 in the literature also suggested that surface hydroxyl species generated from adsorption and dissociation of water may help to remove hydrogen in the rate limiting step of propane dehydrogenation and thus increase the propene formation rate. Unfortunately, this hypothesis has not been verified by either experimental or theoretical results.
In the present study, the effect of steam on PDH has been re-examined over a monometallic Pt catalyst with narrow particle size distribution. To obtain additional insights into the effect of steam on PDH over Pt nanoparticles, a computational study has also been carried out, focusing on the influence of surface adsorbates, like H2O, hydroxyl groups (–OH) and oxygen atoms (–O), on C–H bond activation.
2. Experimental details
An alumina supported platinum catalyst was prepared by the colloid method.31 The preparation procedures were as follows. Firstly, 5 mL of water and 5 mL of ethylene glycol were mixed in a flask. Then, 2.0 g of γ-Al2O3 (Aldrich) and 0.1 g of H2PtCl6·6H2O (99.9%, Sinopharm) were added and dispersed with the help of ultrasonic waves. After stirring overnight, the pH of the solution was adjusted to 13.0 by using sodium hydroxide in non-aqueous ethylene glycol (2 M). After that, the platinum was reduced at 130 °C in argon for 4 h, then cooled to room temperature and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 3.0. After stirring for another 2 h, the solids were obtained after subsequent repeated centrifugation, washing and drying processes.
The metal loading of the catalyst was determined by ICP-AES and the metal dispersion was characterized by H2-Chem and HRTEM techniques. The PDH reaction was carried out in a μBenchCAT reactor (Altamira Instruments, USA) equipped with a quartz reactor with an inner diameter of 6 mm. The reactor was placed in an electrical furnace and the reaction temperature can be maintained within ±0.5 °C of the desired set point. The catalyst loading was 0.05 g for all catalyst testing experiments. All the experiments were conducted at WHSVpropane = 7.1 h−1 and a hydrogen-to-propane molar ratio of 4. Water was introduced into the reactor system by using a pump and vaporized before reaching the reaction zone. Argon was used as a balance gas to achieve a total flow of 200 ml min−1. Mass transfer limitations were excluded under these conditions. The gas composition (C1–C3 hydrocarbons, H2, CO and CO2) was analyzed online with a 4-channel micro-GC (INFICON 3000, USA).
3. Computational details
Periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been carried out using the VASP package.32–34 The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the PBE functional was used for all the atoms. The interactions between valence electrons and ion cores were represented by Blöchl's all-electron-like projector augmented wave method (PAW).35 A tight convergence of the plane-wave expansion was obtained with a cut-off of 400 eV. Brillouin zone sampling was performed by using a Monkhorst–Pack grid with respect to the symmetry of the system and the electronic occupancies were determined according to a Methfessel–Paxton scheme36 with an energy smearing of 0.2 eV.
The Pt(111) surface was represented by a four-layer slab with a p(3 × 3) supercell, as described previously.37 A Monkhorst–Pack mesh of 7 × 7 × 1 k-points was used for 2D Brillouin zone integration. The bottom two layers of the slab were kept fixed to their crystal lattice positions (Pt–Pt distance = 2.82 Å). Spin-polarization was considered for radical-containing systems. The ground-state atomic geometries of the bulk and surfaces were obtained by minimizing the Hellman–Feynman forces with the conjugate-gradient algorithm until the total force on each ion was below 0.03 eV Å−1. The adsorption energy (Eads) was calculated according to the expression:
Eads = Eadsorbate/substrate − Eadsorbate − Esubstrate (1)
where EX is the DFT total energy of an X system. A negative Eads indicates an energy gain process.
Transition states (TSs) were identified using the dimer method.38–40 The most stable configurations of the reactant on the surface were determined by standard DFT minimization. These configurations were used as the initial states, from which the dimer method was used to find the lowest curvature mode and raise the potential energy surface from the minima to the saddle points. The convergence was regarded to be achieved when the force on each atom was less than 0.03 eV Å−1.
4. Results
4.1 Experimental results
The physical properties of the prepared Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst are as follows. Its platinum loading is 1.5% and the mean particle size is 4.9 nm, based on H2-Chem results (metal dispersion of 23.3 %), which is comparable to the statistical value of 5.5 nm obtained from HRTEM images, shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
Propane dehydrogenation over this catalyst was performed to investigate the effect of steam. During the experiments, the conversion of propane was found to be within 7.0%, thus the turnover frequency (TOF(propane, propylene)) representing the catalyst's activity can be calculated by the following equation:
As is shown in Fig. 1(a), the catalyst's activity (TOFpropane) increases with the increase of steam partial pressure and reaches a plateau at higher steam concentrations, which may indicate that the reaction is controlled by water adsorption equilibrium under these water partial pressures. At the same time, the opposite trend is observed for the propene formation rates and the gap between TOFpropane and TOFpropylene increases with the increase of steam partial pressure and finally reaches a plateau as well. Upon looking into the product distribution, it can be seen from Fig. 1(b) that the loss of the selectivity to propylene is mainly converted into the generation of the cracking products, CH4, C2H4 and C2H6, with a selectivity of around 60.0% at steam partial pressures between 1.92 and 3.5 kPa. In the same steam partial pressure range, oxidization products (CO and CO2) are also detected with a selectivity of around 10.0%, indicating the dissociation of water and the involvement of these oxygenated species in propane dehydrogenation pathways.
Fig. 1 Activity (a) and selectivity to products (b) for PDH over Pt(EG) catalyst at different H2O partial pressures, recorded 1.5 minutes later after introduction of feed. Conditions: C3H8/H2/H2O/Ar = 3/12/X/(100 − X) (X is shown in the picture), 450 °C.
The apparent activation energies under different conditions are evaluated and presented in Fig. 2. It is found that PDH in the presence of steam has an activation energy of 56.0 kJ mol−1 which is lower than that without steam introduction (75.5 kJ mol−1). The activation energies obtained here fit in the range of 30–150 kJ mol−1 for PDH reported in ref. 41.
Fig. 2 Apparent activation energies for PDH under different conditions. Conditions: C3H8, 1.5 kPa; H2, 6 kPa, steam partial pressure is shown in the picture, balance is nitrogen.
From the results stated above, it can be seen that introduction of steam into the feed has apparent and complicated influences on PDH over the Pt catalyst, proving the essential role of water and surface oxygenated species in PDH. However, whether the participation of these surface oxygenated species would alter the reaction route and thus decrease the apparent PDH activation energy or not is still under debate. In the following sections, DFT investigation of the effect of adsorption of steam and its subsequent dissociated species on the PDH reaction mechanism is conducted and the factors contributing to the changes in catalyst performance are discussed.
4.2 DFT results
We started with the co-adsorption of C3 species and water. Then, three possible changes in the dehydrogenation mechanisms were considered in the following sections: (1) dehydrogenation of C3 species over Pt(111) surfaces pre-covered with oxygenated species (co-adsorption effects in short hereafter); (2) dehydrogenation of C3 species over Pt(111) surfaces with the participation of surface oxygenated species in the transition states for dehydrogenation and hydrogen removal (Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism); (3) dehydrogenation of C3 species over adsorbed surface oxygenated species (Eley–Rideal mechanism).
4.2.1 Co-adsorption with water The adsorption of water monomers and co-adsorption of water and C3 species were studied to explore the possible existing interactions between them. The adsorption configurations with the lowest energy for the water monomer and water–propane complex are presented in Fig. 3. A water monomer favorably adsorbs on atop sites of the Pt(111) surface via an O–Pt bond of 2.40 Å and an αHO⊥ (relative orientation of the O–H bond to the surface) of 97.2°, which are consistent with DFT calculations in the literature42–44 and indicate that water is nearly parallel to the surface. For the water–propane complex, the shortest H–H bond between them is 1.94 Å. Changes in the water structure such as the O–Pt bond length reduction by 0.02 Å and the increase in the angle of αHO⊥ by 3.2° are observed. However, no noticeable changes in the configurations of propane compared with that on a clean surface could be observed.
Fig. 3 Structures of the adsorbed water (A) and propane in the presence of water (B).
The calculated adsorption energies are listed in Table 1. To better understand the interaction between the hydrocarbon species and water, the co-adsorption energies are decomposed according to the following function:
Eads_A + Eads_B = Ecoads + Eint_AB (2)
where Eads_A/Eads_B is the one-point adsorption energy of A or B obtained by fixing their geometries, Eint_AB is the interaction energy between A and B, and Ecoads is the overall co-adsorption energy of A–B complex. A and B represent hydrocarbon species and water, respectively.
Table 1 Co-adsorption energies of some intermediates for propane dehydrogenation in the presence of surface H2O
Species Ecoads (eV) Eads_A Eads_B Eint_AB
Clean Coads Clean Coads
C3H8 & H2O −0.21 −0.04 −0.04 −0.12 −0.12 0.05
n-C3H7 & H2O −2.03 −1.98 −1.98 −0.12 −0.11 −0.06
i-C3H7 & H2O −1.82 −1.81 −1.80 −0.12 −0.10 −0.08
C3H6 & H2O −1.14 −1.12 −1.11 −0.12 −0.07 −0.04
In the case of the water–propane complex, no noticeable changes in the adsorption energy of propane (Eads_A) and water (Eads_B) are observed. The increased Ecoads is ascribed to the existence of a weak attractive interaction between propane and water (0.05 eV in strength). On the other hand, for n-propyl, i-propyl and propene, co-adsorption with water results in a decrease of Ecoads mainly due to repulsive interactions between them (0.06, 0.08 and 0.04 eV in strength, respectively). It should also be noted that in the case of propene–water co-adsorption, a significant decrease of Eads_B was observed (decreased by 0.05 eV), indicating changes of the water adsorption configuration in addition to the repulsive interaction.
4.2.2 Co-adsorption effects The presence of carbon oxides as by-products indicates the dissociation of water molecules on the platinum surface. Therefore, surface –OH and –O are also considered in the following sections to investigate their possible influences on the dehydrogenation mechanism. In this section, the co-adsorption effects are discussed.
The most favorable adsorption sites for surface –OH and –O are bridge and hollow sites, respectively, as listed in Table S1.† To identify the transition states for the dehydrogenation steps, surface –OH or –O was placed at different favorable adsorption sites adjacent to the dehydrogenated species and the ones with the most stable configurations were selected. The results are listed in Table 2.
Table 2 Activation energies for dehydrogenation over clean Pt(111) surface and Pt(111) surface with pre-adsorbed oxygenated species
Elementary steps Pt37 H2O*Pt OH*Pt O*Pt
ES1 CH3CH2CH3* → CH3CH2CH2 + H 0.69 0.72 0.75 0.74
ES2 CH3CH2CH3* → CH3CHCH3 + H* 0.70 0.73 0.74 0.74
ES3 CH3CH2CH2* → CH3CHCH2 +H* 0.70 0.72 0.76 0.75
ES4 CH3CHCH3* → CH3CHCH2 + H* 0.68 0.69 0.76 0.73
ES5 CH3CHCH2* → CH3CHCH + H* 0.76 0.81 0.79 0.87
ES6 CH3CHCH2* → CH3CCH2 + H* 0.77 0.82 0.83 0.86
As can be seen from Table 2, co-adsorption of water and oxygenated species with C3 species could elevate all the activation energies of the different elementary steps to some extent. For example, with co-adsorption of water, the activation energies of propane dehydrogenation to propene (ES1–ES4 in Table 2) increased slightly by 0.01–0.03 eV; in the cases of co-adsorption with surface –OH and –O, the activation energies of ES1–ES4 steps are increased by 0.05–0.06 eV. The elevation of the activation energies for the dehydrogenation steps indicates that the catalyst activity may decrease for the co-adsorption mechanism. Among all three co-adsorption species, water has the least influence on PDH energy barriers, but the discrepancies from the effect of the other two species are small. Considering the fact that the structures of the transition states remain almost unchanged compared with that on a clean surface (shown in Fig. S2†), the repulsion between surface oxygenated species and C3 species would account for such an increase in the activation energy.
The activation energies of propene deep dehydrogenation steps (ES5 and ES6) are increased by 0.03–0.11 eV due to the presence of co-adsorption species, indicating that the co-adsorption mechanism may decrease the catalyst activities. However, it should be noted that this may not mean that the selectivity of propene cracking reactions is reduced. Actually, for the co-adsorption of surface –OH, the difference between ES5 and ES1–ES4 is reduced, indicating that the relative reaction rate of propene dehydrogenation/propane dehydrogenation may increase and the selectivity to propene will decrease due to the existence of this species.
4.2.3 Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism The Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism is discussed in this section. For the convenience of comparison, the related results of propane dehydrogenation on bare Pt(111) surfaces37 are recalled.
The structure configurations for propane dehydrogenation on the bare Pt(111) surface are presented in Fig. 4(a). For the first C–H bond activation, through the primary H (TS1) or secondary H atom (TS2), the readily removed H atom is adsorbed on the bridge site of the Pt surface, with C–H bond lengths of 1.50 Å and 1.57 Å, respectively. When an adsorbed hydroxyl is present atop the adjacent Pt atom, it can be involved in the formation of TS (TS5 and TS6 in Fig. 4(b)) by interacting with the readily removed H atom. These structures give a shorter C–H bond length of 1.34 Å; meanwhile, a water molecule is nearly formed with a H–O bond length of 1.50 Å. Similar TS structures can be obtained in the case of the surface oxygen atom (TS9 and TS10 in Fig. 4(c)), in which the oxygen atom is adsorbed at the bridge site of the Pt surface and a surface hydroxyl is to be formed.
Fig. 4 Transition state structures for propane dehydrogenation at (a) clean Pt(111) surface, (b) OH*Pt(111) surface, and (c) O*Pt(111) surface.
The activation energies of these dehydrogenation steps are presented in Fig. 5. For activation of the first H atom, the results show that the involvement of hydroxyl in the TS structures shifts the energy barriers to higher values of 0.74 eV (TS5) and 0.77 eV (TS6) to produce n- and i-propyl species, respectively, compared with those of 0.69 eV (TS1) and 0.70 eV (TS2) on the bare Pt(111) surface. Moreover, the steps involving surface –O have even higher activation energies of 1.32 eV (TS9) and 1.37 eV (TS10), suggesting the inactive nature of these surface oxygen atoms. The distance of the H–Pt bond in these cases is elongated by around 0.3 Å, which indicates the decrease of adsorption energy due to the repulsive interaction between the surface oxygenated species and adsorbed C3 species and could partly account for the higher activation energies of these steps.
Fig. 5 Reaction pathways of propane dehydrogenation to propene at the clean platinum surface Pt(111), at the hydroxylated surface OH*Pt(111), and at the oxygenated surface O*Pt(111). Energies are in eV.
An interesting phenomenon was found in the case of surface –OH assisted β-H elimination steps. At TS8, through which i-propyl dehydrogenates to propene, the activated C–H bond length (1.53 Å) is similar to that on the bare surface (1.54 Å) and the H–O bond (1.86 Å) is longer than that in TS5–TS7 (1.40–1.50 Å). This configuration has an activation energy of 0.63 eV, lower than that on the bare surface by a magnitude of 0.05 eV. However, for surface –OH assisted n-propyl dehydrogenation to propene, the activation energy is elevated to 0.88 eV. Surface –O is also inactive in the β-H elimination steps. As can be seen from Fig. 5, the activation energies of these steps are elevated to as high as 1.25–1.37 eV (TS11 and TS12), which are much higher than those of 0.68–0.70 eV (TS3 and TS4) on bare Pt(111) surfaces.
To provide a rational interpretation of the obtained results, the activation energies of propene-producing steps are decomposed as follows:
Eact = Eads,TS − Ebond(C3H6−H) − Eads,C3H7 (3)
where Eads,TS is the adsorption energy of the activated complex with respect to the gaseous propene, OH and H species, Ebond(C3H6–H) is the C–H bond energy at the methyl group of gaseous n-propyl or i-propyl and Eads,C3H7 is the adsorption energy of the propyl species. As the bond energy and propyl adsorption energy remain constant, the variation in Eact depends solely on the changes in Eads,TS which can be further decomposed into the following five terms:
Eads,TS = Eads,TS(propene) + Eads,TS(H) + Eads,TS(OH) + Eint,lat(H,propene) + Eint,lat(H+propene,OH) (4)
where Eads,TS(propene), Eads,TS(H), and Eads,TS(OH) are the adsorption energies for propene, H and OH, respectively, with their geometries in the activated complex, while Eint,lat(H,propene) and Eint,lat(H+propene,OH) represent the interaction energies for H–propene and OH–(H + propene) in the activated complexes, respectively. From eqn (4), one can see that a more negative Eads,TS(propene) (Eads,TS(H), Eads,TS(OH)) and a lower Eint,lat(H,propene) (Eint,lat(H+propene,OH)) lead to a more negative Eads,TS, which contributes to a lower energy barrier.
The transition states TS3 and TS4 on the bare Pt(111) surface and their surface –OH assisted counterparts TS7 and TS8 are decomposed to analyze the factors contributing to the elevated and lowered activation energies. The results are shown in Table 3. In TS7, it is found that the adsorptions of propene and hydrogen are weakened, hydroxyl can attract hydrogen with an attractive energy of −0.45 eV and the interaction between hydrogen and propene is lowered. However, the interactions are insufficient to compensate the weakened adsorption of hydrocarbons and shift the activation energy to a higher value. In TS8, the attractive energy from surface –OH is lower than that in TS7, but the adsorption energies for propene and hydrogen are higher than those on the bare Pt(111) surface and lower the activation energy. This means that the adsorption of propene and hydrogen atom dominate in the determination of activation energies.
Table 3 Decomposition of the activation energy for propane dehydrogenation (step 2) on Pt(111) and OH*Pt(111)
Reaction pathway Eads,TS Eads,TS(propene) Eads,TS(H) Eint,lat(H,propene) Eads,TS(OH) Eint,lat(OH,propene+H)

Through TS4 −2.96 −0.82 −2.2 0.48 — —
Through TS8 −5.38 −0.90 −2.61 0.54 −2.23 −0.18
When the total energy of the initial propane and –OH (or –O) co-adsorption state is set to zero, it can be seen that the surface –OH assisted dehydrogenation route is thermodynamically favorable with released heat of 0.59 eV and 0.77 eV for the two consecutive C–H bond activation steps. While the situation is different for reactions involving surface oxygen atoms, in which the first step is a slightly endothermic reaction and only the second step is an exothermic step with a released heat of 0.16 eV. Therefore, the surface oxygen atom is both kinetically and thermodynamically unfavorable.
4.2.4 Eley–Rideal mechanism It's well known that the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over some metal oxide catalysts follows the Mars–van Krevelen mechanism45–49 and Eley–Rideal mechanism;50–53 for the later pathways, the surface oxygen species are involved in activating and abstracting H from propane. To gain a better understanding of the effect of oxygenated species on the Pt(111) surface, this possible reaction pathway is also considered here.
Fig. 6 shows the transition states of H atom abstraction by surface oxygenated species and the corresponding energy profiles are shown in Fig. 7. In the case of oxidation of propane by surface hydroxyl through H abstraction, the transition state for the activation of the C–H bond in the methyl group is successfully located and presented in Fig. 6 (TS13), in which the C–H bond is elongated from 1.10 Å to 1.54 Å and a water molecule is readily formed with a H–O distance of 1.11 Å, which is quite close to the H–O bond length of 0.99 Å in a gaseous H2O molecule. The reaction barrier is calculated to be 1.08 eV. The activation of propane through breaking of the C–H bond in methylene was also calculated and found to be more favorable with an energy barrier of 0.88 eV. A shorter C–H bond length of 1.42 Å can be observed in the geometry. From a thermodynamic point of view, the C–H bond energy in the methyl group is stronger than that in the methylene group (420 kJ mol−1 and 401 kJ mol−1 (ref. 54)). Therefore, the production of i-propyl radicals is both thermodynamically and kinetically favored, which is consistent with the observations in the literature.46,54,55

Fig. 7 Reaction pathways of oxidative dehydrogenation on OH*Pt(111) surface, and O*Pt(111) surface.
For oxidation of propane by atomic oxygen species, the energy barrier of producing i-propyl radicals is 0.22 eV lower than that of producing n-propyl radicals and kinetically favorable. However, compared with dehydrogenation by surface hydroxyl, the activation of propane by atomic oxygen species is much more difficult since an energy barrier of as high as 1.64 eV needs to be overcome to produce i-propyl radicals. The atop site for oxygen atom adsorption in the transition states is one of the reasons accounting for such a high activation energy. The most favored adsorption configuration for oxygen atoms is the hollow sites with an adsorption energy of 4.41 eV and the adsorption configuration on atop sites has an adsorption energy of 3.13 eV. However, the transition states cannot be successfully located when oxygen is placed at either hollow or bridge sites.
After the first H abstraction from propane, propyl radicals are formed in the gas phase (as shown in Fig. 8). These radicals are close to the newly formed groups (surface H2O or –OH) with bond lengths ranging from 1.99 Å to 2.18 Å. At the next step, these radicals will adsorb on the Pt(111) surface, and no transition states could be located for the adsorption processes.
Fig. 8 Intermediates formed on hydroxylated and oxygenated platinum surfaces.
The β-hydrogen elimination steps can also proceed through the H abstraction reaction in the presence of surface oxygenated species and this step follows the surface reaction mechanism. The transition states are successfully located and the specific configurations are shown in Fig. 6 (TS15, TS16, TS19, and TS20). The activated C–H bonds are shorter than those involved in the first hydrogen activation in propane, as shown in Fig. 6, and the newly formed H–O bonds are longer accordingly. It's apparent that lower energies are needed to activate the second hydrogen, especially in the reactions involving surface hydroxyl, and the activation energies are even lower than those on the clean Pt(111) surface.
When dehydrogenation reactions of propane by surface hydroxyl and oxygen atoms are compared, it is found that the first H abstraction reactions are the rate limiting steps in both cases, which is consistent with the results obtained by DFT studies on oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over vanadium oxide54–56 but differs from dehydrogenation of propane over the Pt(111) surface.37 Surface hydroxyl is more active than atomic oxygen species from a kinetic point of view since a lower energy barrier is needed to break the C–H bond. Moreover, the two consecutive H abstraction reactions by surface hydroxyl are all exothermic. Thus, dehydrogenation by surface hydroxyl is also thermodynamically more favorable than dehydrogenation by surface O. However, among all the three mechanisms discussed above, the essential role of surface –OH is achieved most likely through the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, since the activation energies for this mechanism have relatively low values.
5. Discussion
The increase of catalytic activity and decrease of apparent activation energies are observed in experiments when steam is introduced into the PDH reaction. However, the DFT results stated above show that co-adsorption with oxygenated species can shift the activation energies to higher values due to the repulsion among the co-adsorbing species. For the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, the activation of the first C–H bond in propane is not facilitated because of stereospecific blockade. In some specific steps, e.g. i-propyl dehydrogenation to propylene, surface –OH can help activate the C–H bond of the methyl group due to electronic interactions. For the Eley–Rideal mechanism, although the second step of C–H bond activation by surface –OH is slightly kinetically favored, the first step of C–H bond abstraction provides high energy barriers of 0.88 eV and 1.08 eV for i-propyl and n-propyl radical production, respectively. Therefore, the DFT results do not seem to support the conclusion of alternation in the reaction pathways for PDH in the presence of steam.
It should be noted that adsorption of water on the Pt surface would change the surface coverage of different species and therefore affect the reaction rate. For PDH over a Pt catalyst, Chen et al.57 found that the reaction order with respect to hydrogen is −0.5, which indicates that lower hydrogen partial pressure and surface coverage will lead to an increase of the reaction rate. This phenomenon is also supported by the previous DFT results.21 However, water adsorption on Pt(111) is weak and may have low surface coverage, which would limit the effect of steam in a certain range. As is shown in Fig. 9, the order of the PDH reaction with respect to hydrogen remains nearly unchanged in steam atmosphere since this can be expressed as follows:31
nH2 = − θH − 0.5
Fig. 9 Reaction order with respect to hydrogen for PDH under different conditions. Conditions: C3H8, 1.5 kPa; H2, 6 kPa.
Another advantage of steam for PDH is that steam could contribute to lower coking rates,25,58,59 which is justified by our TG analysis of the spent catalysts, as shown in Table 4. The decrease of coking rates in the presence of steam contributes to the increase of catalytic activity, since more Pt(111) surfaces may be free for reaction.21 Furthermore, it should be noted that when steam is introduced, the loss of selectivity to propene is mainly converted to the generation of cracking products, in accordance with the studies of other authors.28,60 Yang et al.37,61 and Nykänen et al.62 have shown that lower coordinated Pt sites, like step sites, are highly active but are not selective for PDH reaction. On these sites, generation of cracking products and coking reaction prevail. Therefore, monometallic Pt catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation.15,63–66 When steam is introduced, the removal of cokes will help recover and maintain these highly active Pt sites and increase the catalyst's activity and decrease the selectivity to propene at the same time. Since propane dehydrogenation on these sites has lower activation energies,37,62 it can also account for the experimentally observed decrease in activation energies.67
Table 4 Coking rates under different steam partial pressures
H2O partial pressure (KPa) Reaction time (h) Coking rate (gcoke gPt−1 s−1)
0.00 1 8.23 × 10−5
1.31 1 7.29 × 10−5
1.95 1 7.14 × 10−5
2.63 1 6.86 × 10−5
3.28 1 6.77 × 10−5
Finally, it should be noted that the change in propane dehydrogenation activities is also related to the catalyst structures. It was found by Luu et al.29 that steam was involved in the dominator of their second-order kinetic model over tin-promoted Pt/γ-Al2O3, indicating that H2O was adsorbed on active sites. However, for their Pt/γ-Al2O3 catalyst without addition of tin, the dehydrogenation rates were hardly dependent on the partial pressure of steam, revealing that the effects of steam might depend on the different supports24,67 and catalyst compositions.24,29,67
6. Conclusion
A combined experimental and theoretical study of the effect of steam on propane dehydrogenation was performed. The experimental results show that addition of steam in the PDH reaction will increase the catalyst's activities, and lower the dehydrogenation activation energies and coking rates. Compared with dehydrogenation over a clean Pt(111) surface, the DFT results show that the energy barriers of different dehydrogenation steps are elevated due to the adsorption of water and its dissociated species. The only exception is the i-propyl dehydrogenation to propene step with the involvement of surface –OH through both Langmuir–Hinshelwood and Eley–Rideal mechanisms. For PDH under steam atmosphere, the role of surface –OH is essential, most likely through the Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, in which the first C–H bond activation is the rate determining step in the overall PDH reaction route. The promoting effect of steam can be ascribed to the removal of cokes deposited on active Pt surfaces and the changes of adsorption species coverage on the Pt surface.

4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
