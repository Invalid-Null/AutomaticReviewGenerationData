Kinetics and Mechanism of Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane on Vanadium, Molybdenum, and Tungsten Oxides
Abstract
The effect of cation identity on oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) pathways was examined using two-dimensional VOx, MoOx, and WOx structures supported on ZrO2. The similar kinetic rate expressions obtained on MoOx and VOx catalysts confirmed that oxidative dehydrogenation of propane occurs via similar pathways, which involve rate-determining C−H bond activation steps using lattice oxygen atoms. The activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2; the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this sequence, suggesting that turnover rates reflect C−H bond cleavage activation energies, which are in turn influenced by the reducibility of these metal oxides. Propane ODH activation energies are higher than for propene combustion. This leads to an increase in maximum alkene yields and in the ratio of rate constants for propane ODH and propene combustion as temperature increases. This difference in activation energy (48−61 kJ/mol) between propane ODH and propene combustion is larger than between bond dissociation enthalpies for the weakest C−H bond in propane and propene (40 kJ/mol) and it increases in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2. These results suggest that relative propane ODH and propene combustion rates depend not only on C−H bond energy differences but also on the adsorption enthalpies for propene and propane, which reflect the Lewis acidity of cations involved in π bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces. The observed difference in activation energies between propane ODH and propene combustion increases as the Lewis acidity of the cations increases (V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+).

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In spite of its significant economic potential as an alternate route to alkenes 1-5 and in spite of extensive scientific studies, 1-22 the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes to alkenes is not currently practiced because the secondary combustion of primary alkene products limits alkene yields to about 30% for propane and higher alkanes.3 Alkene selectivities decrease markedly as conversion increases.2,3 One important reason for these yield limitations is the typically higher energies of the C−H bonds in alkane reactants compared with those in the desired alkene products, 23 which lead to rapid alkene combustion at the temperatures required for C−H bond activation in alkanes. A recent literature survey of product yields in oxidation reactions23 suggested that low yields are obtained when the energy of the weakest bond in the products is 30−40 kJ/mol lower than that of the weakest bond in the reactants.
The oxidation of light alkanes to alkenes occurs via parallel and sequential oxidation steps (Scheme 1).1 Alkenes are primary ODH products while CO and CO2 (COx) can form via either secondary combustion of alkenes or direct combustion of alkanes. Selective poisoning of sites responsible for direct combustion of alkanes using SiOx has been reported. 24 The activation of C−H bonds in alkane ODH reactions, however, appears to require the same sites as the C−H bond activation steps involved in the combustion of alkenes, 25,26 making selective poisoning strategies ineffective in improving alkene yields. On VOx-based catalysts, the evolution of oxide structures from monovanadate to polyvanadate species as VOx surface density increases leads to a similar increase in ODH and propene combustion rates, apparently because similar sites are required for the two reactions.26 Propane combustion rates, however, are less affected by VOx surface density, which leads to a decrease in k2/k1 ratios as surface density increases.25,26 Initial selectivities greater than 90% can be achieved for many ODH reactions.2,3 The k3/k1 (propene secondary combustion/propane primary dehydrogenation) ratio, which causes the yield losses observed as conversion increases, is large (5−40) on VOx-based catalysts.25,26 The greater reactivity of propene arises in part because the weakest C−H bond in propane (at the methylene group) is significantly stronger than the allylic C−H bond in propene.23 If the relative C−H bond dissociation enthalpies were the only factor responsible for the k3/k1 ratio, this ratio would not depend on the chemical identity or the local structure of the active oxide. The differences observed among VOx, MoOx, WOx and other oxides suggest that other factors, such as differences in adsorption enthalpy or entropy between alkanes and alkenes, and therefore the acid−base properties of active oxides and of supports, may also influence k3/k1 ratios and alkene yields.
Scheme 1:  Reaction Network in Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Alkane Reactions
VOx-based materials are among the most active and selective oxidative dehydrogenation catalysts.1-5 Polyvanadate structures on ZrO2 lead to reducible and accessible VOx domains and to more active catalysts than VOx dispersed on other supports.26 ZrO2-supported MoOx species have also been examined as alkane ODH catalysts;18,27,28 ODH rates tend to be lower on MoOx than on VOx domains, but MoOx-based catalysts retain their dispersion and structure at significantly higher temperatures than VOx-based catalysts. Catalysts based on WOx domains are seldom used because of their low ODH activity. This study addresses the chemical and structural basis for the observed differences in ODH rates and in rate constants for individual reaction steps on VOx, MoOx, and WOx catalysts. Detailed ODH kinetics, including activation energies and entropies for primary dehydrogenation and secondary combustion, are reported. They are used to identify relevant factors influencing k3/k1 and k2/k1 ratios for reactions of propane and propene on these catalysts.

V2O5/ZrO2 (10 wt % V2O5), MoO3/ZrO2 (11 wt % MoO3), and WO3/ZrO2 (20 wt % WO3) catalysts were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of ZrOx(OH)4-2x with solutions of NH4VO3,25 (NH4)2Mo2O7,27 and (NH4)6H2W12O40, 29,30 respectively. Surface areas were measured by N2 physisorption at its boiling point using a Quantasorb surface area analyzer (Quantachrome Corp.) and BET analysis methods.
Catalytic measurements were carried out in a packed-bed quartz microreactor with plug-flow hydrodynamics25 using 0.03−0.3 g catalyst samples. Quartz powder was used to dilute the bed and to minimize temperature gradients. Propane (Airgas, 99.9%) and O2 (Airgas, 99.999%) were used as reactants and He (Airgas, 99.999%) was used as an inert diluent. Water was introduced into C3H8−O2 reactant streams by flowing a 20% H2/Ar mixture through a CuO bed (0.5 m long, 150 g of CuO) held at 623 K. Water was formed by CuO reduction to Cu metal. All transfer lines beyond the point of water introduction were kept above 393 K in order to prevent condensation. Reactants and products were analyzed with a Hewlett-Packard 6890 gas chromatograph using analysis procedures described elsewhere.25,26 C3H8 and O2 conversions were varied by changing reactant flow rates (50−200 cm3/min); they were kept below 2% and 20%, respectively. Reaction rates and selectivities were extrapolated to zero residence time in order to determine initial reaction rates and selectivities. First-order rate constants for alkane ODH (k1), primary alkane combustion (k2), and secondary combustion of alkenes (k3) were obtained from bed residence time effects on product distributions using previously described procedures.25

The kinetics and reaction pathways for propane ODH on VOx-based catalysts have been described in detail previously. 31 The ODH rate is proportional to C3H8 partial pressures and independent of O2 partial pressures when H2O partial pressures are low; the rates acquire a more complex dependence on C3H8 and O2 pressures when H2O is present at higher concentrations. Similar kinetic dependencies were observed on MoOx/ZrO2. Figure 1 shows initial propene formation rates for MoOx/ZrO2 as a function of propane partial pressure at 1.3 kPa of O2 without added H2O. The propene formation rate increases linearly with increasing propane partial pressure, in agreement with previous reports. 31-34 Propane ODH rates do not depend on O2 partial pressures when H2O is not added (Figure 2), in agreement with previous reports.31-33 The effect of H2O partial pressure on propane ODH rates is shown in Figure 3 at 8.1 kPa of C3H8 and 1.3 kPa of O2. Water inhibits propane ODH on MoOx−ZrO2 catalysts in a manner similar to that reported on VOx−ZrO231 and VOx−Al2O334 catalysts. This resemblance in the ODH kinetics on MoOx−ZrO2 and VOx−ZrO2 and complementary isotopic tracer studies of the reaction steps suggest that the elementary steps involved in alkane ODH reactions are also similar on MoOx and VOx catalysts. Detailed kinetics and isotopic tracer studies31 have shown that propane ODH occurs on VOx domains via a Mars−van Krevelen redox mechanism using lattice oxygen atoms to abstract hydrogen atoms from C3H8 in an irreversible C−H bond activation step. Propane ODH is envisioned to occur via the following sequence:

1. Weak associative adsorption of propane on lattice oxygen (O*)
2. C−H cleavage via H-abstraction from propane using a neighboring lattice oxygen
3. Desorption of propene by hydride elimination from adsorbed alkoxide species
4. Recombination of OH groups to form water and a reduced M center (*)
5. Reoxidation of reduced M-centers via dissociative chemisorption of O2
In this scheme, O* is a lattice oxygen atom in the MOx overlayer (e.g., M = O, M−O-M, or M−O−Zr), OH* is a hydroxyl group in M−O−H, C3H7O* represents an adsorbed propoxide bonded to M (M−O−C3H7), and * represents a surface vacancy associated with either one Mo(n-2)+ cation (n is the highest valence of M) or two Mo(n-1)+ cations in the MOx lattice. These elementary steps, together with pseudo-steady-state assumptions for all adsorbed intermediates and quasi-equilibrium assumptions for steps I and IV, lead to a rate expression of the form:
where ki is the rate coefficient and Ki is the equilibrium constant for step i. Figure 4 compares experimental and predicted rates (by eq 1) at various C3H8, O2, and H2O concentrations for the MoOx/ZrO2 and VOx/ZrO2 catalysts used in this study. It is evident that eq 1 describes accurately propane ODH on both catalysts at all conditions used in the study, confirming the mechanistic resemblance of ODH reactions on MoOx-based and VOx-based catalysts. The limited available kinetic data do not permit a conclusive assessment of the ODH mechanism on WOx/ZrO2, but the chemical resemblance between Mo and W oxides leads us to expect that the reaction also occurs by the steps leading to eq 1.

Effects of MOx Composition on the Rate Constants for Primary and Secondary Reactions. The effects of metal oxidecomposition on the apparent rate constants for reactions 1−3 in Scheme 1 were measured at low C3H8 conversions in order to minimize the kinetic complexity introduced by higher H2O partial pressures. Figure 5 shows an Arrhenius plot for k1 and Figures 6 and 7 show similar plots for k3/k1 and k2/k1, respectively. These data can be used to examine how the identity of the metal cations in MOx influences rates and selectivities for propane ODH and combustion and for secondary combustion of propene.

At low H2O concentrations, the rate of propane ODH given by eq 1 becomes
The apparent rate coefficient k1 is, therefore, equal to kIIKI. The equilibrium constant (KI) can be related to the thermodynamics of propane adsorption using
and the rate constant (kII) to the thermodynamics of formation of the transition-state species in step II 35
where kB is the Boltzmann constant and h is Planck's constant. ΔHIads and ΔSIads are the enthalpy and entropy of propane adsorption (step I), and ΔHIIr and ΔSIIr are the enthalpy and the entropy for the formation of the transition state in step II. Combining eqs 2 and 4 leads to
If eq 5 is rewritten as
then ΔE1, the apparent activation energy, is given by
and A1, the preexponential factor, is given by
Thus, the apparent activation energy for propane ODH corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy for step I and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state involved in step II. The preexponential factor reflects the sum of adsorption entropy for step I and the entropy of formation of the transition-state species in step II, because
and therefore
ΔS1 reflects entropy differences between the reactant (C3H8) in step I and the transition state for step II. Apparent activation energies (ΔE1) and entropies (ΔS1) for the primary ODH reaction were obtained from the data in Figure 5 and they are reported in Table 2. The values of ΔS1 obtained are very similar on all three catalysts. Since S(C3H8) is a molecular property that does not depend on the nature of the catalyst, the similar values of ΔS1 obtained on the three catalysts suggest that values of Sts,II, and thus the structure of the activated complex, are also similar on MoOx, VOx, and WOx domains. This confirms the conclusion reached from measurements of the reaction kinetics and from isotopic tracer studies that propane ODH proceeds via the same mechanism on VOx/ZrO2 and MoOx/ZrO2,28,31 and possibly also on WOx/ZrO2. The measured activation energies (99−126 kJ/mol) are similar to values previously reported on V2O5−Nb2O5 (72−110 kJ/mol), 36 and they increase in the sequence
Propane ODH rates show the opposite trend and decrease in this order; this suggests that the higher ODH rates reported on VOx-based catalysts reflect the lower activation energy for C−H bond activation on VOx-based catalysts compared to those on catalysts based on MoOx and WOx.

The k3/k1 ratio decreases with increasing temperature on all three catalysts (Figure 6). Assuming Arrhenius forms for k1 and k3, their ratio can be written as
ΔE3 and ΔS3 values (for secondary propene combustion) were calculated from Figures 5 and 6 and they are shown in Table 2. ΔE3 increases in the same order as ΔE1 (VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2). Activation entropies for propene combustion (ΔS3) over VOx/ZrO2, MoOx/ZrO2, and WOx/ZrO2 are similar (Table 2), suggesting that combustion pathways are also similar on these catalysts.
The similar site requirements for reactions 1 and 3 (suggested by the effects of VOx structure on selectivity)25,26 and the markedly different values of ΔS3 and ΔS1 measured (Table 2) indicate that propane ODH (reaction 1) and propene combustion (reaction 3) pathways involve transition states with different structures. The weakest C−H bond in alkanes and alkenes is usually cleaved in the initial step of oxidation reactions; 38-40 thus, C−H bonds at the secondary carbon and allylic C−H bonds in propene are expected to be involved in rate-determining C−H activation steps. This was also confirmed by the observed kinetic isotopic effects when comparing reactions of CH3CH2CH3/O2 and CH3CD2CH3/O2. 41 As a result, transition states for activation of C−H bonds in propane and propene would differ markedly, as suggested by the possible transition state structures shown in Figure 8.
Figure 8 Speculated transition state structures of activation of propane (a and a‘) and propene (b and b‘).
The apparent activation energy for propene combustion (ΔE3) is lower than for propene dehydrogenation (ΔE1) on all three catalysts (Table 2). This leads to a decrease in the k3/k1 ratio (and an increase in propene yields) as temperature increases. The C−H bond activated in propane is stronger than the allylic C−H bond in propene; consequently, propane reaction rates are more sensitive to temperature than propene reaction rates. The difference in activation energy between the two steps (ΔE1 − ΔE3) is 48−61 kJ/mol and it increases in the sequence
On selective ODH catalysts, alkene yield limitations predominantly reflect the value of the k3/k1 ratio, because k2/k1 ratios tend to be very small (0.1−0.2).25-27 The value of ΔE1 − ΔE3 strongly influences k3/k1 ratios (eq 12). In what follows, we examine the specific elementary steps that influence the measured values of k1 and k3, as well as catalyst properties that can influence these relevant rate constants. The apparent activation energy for propane ODH reactions corresponds to the sum of the adsorption enthalpy in step I and the enthalpy of formation of the transition state species in step II (eq 7). A similar treatment can be used for propene activation by proposing that molecular adsorption of propene precedes activation of allylic C−H bonds; adsorption and C−H bond activation steps are followed by fast (and kinetically insignificant) steps required in order to complete a combustion turnover.
This treatment leads to an apparent activation energy for propene combustion given by
where ΔHI‘ads is the propene adsorption enthalpy and ΔHII‘r is the enthalpy of formation of the transition state for allylic C−H bond cleavage in step II‘. ΔE1 − ΔE3 is the critical term influencing k3/k1 ratios and it is given by
Δ(ΔHads) represents the difference between the adsorption enthalpies for associative adsorption of propane and of propene on a given catalyst. Δ(ΔHr) reflects the difference in the formation enthalpies for the transition states required for C−H bond activation in propane and propene on a given catalyst. Since the C−H bond activation steps for propane and propene appear to require similar sites, Δ(ΔHr) values predominantly reflect the difference in C−H bond dissociation enthalpies between propane and propene, while acid−base properties would influence predominantly the adsorption enthalpies of propane and propene (i.e. Δ(ΔHads)).
The dissociation energy for methylene C−H bonds in propane (401 kJ/mol) 42 is higher than for allylic C−H bonds in propene (361 kJ/mol).42 The difference in C−H bond dissociation enthalpy between these two bonds (40 kJ/mol) is smaller than the measured ΔE1 − ΔE3 values (48−61 kJ/mol; Table 2). Activation energies for propane ODH (ΔE1 = 99−126 kJ/mol) and propene combustion (ΔE3 = 51−65 kJ/mol) are much smaller than the dissociation enthalpies of the bonds broken, suggesting that these C−H bonds are cleaved via concerted interactions with lattice oxygen atoms. These concerted pathways avoid the requirement for the full dissociation energy through the concurrent exothermic formation of C−O and H−O bonds. Therefore, Δ(ΔHr) values are not likely to reach the full 40 kJ/mol C−H bond enthalpy difference between propane and propene. Yet, experimental ΔE1 − ΔE3 values are larger than 40 kJ/mol on all three catalysts (Table 2). We conclude that ΔE1 − ΔE3 values must also reflect differences in adsorption enthalpy between propane and propene Δ(ΔHads), which depend on the nature of the catalytic surface and not just on the relative bond strength in alkanes and alkenes. Adsorption processes are exothermic and stronger molecule−site interactions translate into more negative adsorption enthalpies. Propene molecules contain a π-bond, which makes them more basic than propane and which leads to stronger interactions with electron-deficient Lewis centers on oxide surfaces. As a result, propene interacts more strongly than propane with oxides containing Lewis acid centers.2 VOx, MoOx, and WOx all contain electron-deficient cations that act as Lewis acids; therefore, Δ(ΔHads) is always positive and this term makes (ΔE1 − ΔE3) values larger than the Δ(ΔHr) term.
Clearly, small k3/k1 ratios require small differences in adsorption enthalpies between propane and propene. VOx, MoOx, and WOx contain electron-deficient cations that act as Lewis acid centers and WOx/ZrO2 has been widely studied as an acid catalyst. 43,44 Lewis acid strength can be related to the electronegativity of each element in a compound and to the ratio of the square of the charge (q) to the ionic radius (r) for a given cation. In general higher electronegativity and larger q2/r values are associated with stronger Lewis acids. 45 The Pauling electronegativities increase in the sequence 46
The ionic radii of V5+ is 0.54 Å and Mo6+ is 0.59 Å and W6+ is 0.60 Å at the same coordination number of 6. 47 As a result, q2/r values increase in the same sequence
By both criteria, the Lewis acid strength of the cations increases in the sequence V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+. The strength of the conjugate base (lattice oxygen atoms) decreases with increasing cation acid strength and the basicity of the lattice oxygen atoms therefore increases in the sequence
The electron-rich π bond causes propene to interact more strongly with electron-deficient cations (or with less basic oxygens) than propane. Therefore, Δ(ΔHads) is always positive and it is expected to increase in the sequence
The cleavage of allylic C−H bonds in propene occurs away from the π bond involved in adsorption; therefore, changes of Δ(ΔHads) and in Lewis acid strength influence Δ(ΔHr) values only weakly. For similar values of Δ(ΔHr), eq 14 predicts that ΔE1 − ΔE3 would increase as Δ(ΔHads) and Lewis acid strength increase. The measured ΔE1 − ΔE3 values (Table 2) indeed increase in the same sequence as the predicted Lewis acid strength of V5+, Mo6+, and W6+ cations.
Measured k2/k1 ratios depend only weakly on temperature on all three catalysts (Figure 7), suggesting that propane ODH and propane combustion activation energies are very similar. Both reactions use propane as the reactant and they appear to be limited by the initial activation of a methylene C−H bond in propane. As a result, these two rates will depend on kII and KI values that are likely to be similar for the two reaction paths; hence, k2/k1 ratios are almost independent of temperature. The kinetic resemblance between ODH and combustion steps suggests that the steps that determine the fate of adsorbed alkoxide speciesdesorption as alkene or sequential oxidation and ultimate desorption as COxdepend on the nature of the binding site, but they are not kinetically significant because they occur after irreversible C−H bond activation steps. Previous studies have shown that the propane ODH and combustion reactions occur on different active sites, and that the relative abundance of these two types of binding sites is influenced by the structure of the MOx species, as shown by the observed changes in k1/k2 ratio with changes in the surface density of VOx25,26 and MoOx27 species. The observed increase in k1/k2 values with increasing VOx and MoOx surface density appears to be associated with the decreasing density of M−O−Zr species, which favor strong binding of intermediate alkoxide species and the direct combustion of propane during one surface sojourn.25-27
Effects of Catalyst Structure and Chemical Properties on Catalytic ODH Reactions. In ODH reactions, the redox properties of oxide catalysts play an important role in determining reaction rates,37 and the relative C−H bond energies in alkanes and alkenes strongly influence alkene yields.23 The acid−base properties of oxide catalysts, however, can also influence both reaction rates and alkene yields.37
ODH reaction rates reflect an apparent activation energy (ΔE1) given by the sum of the enthalpy of propane adsorption (ΔHIads) and of the C−H bond activation energy (ΔHIIr) (eq 7). Generally, molecular adsorption of propane is very weak and ΔHIads values are small. As a result, ΔE1 values reflect predominantly ΔHIIr values. C−H bond activation involves a concerted reaction with lattice oxygen atoms, which leads to ΔHIIr values much lower than C−H bond dissociation energies. This step forms alkoxide and hydroxyl groups and it leads to a two-electron reduction leading to either one Mn-2 or two Mn-1 cations (depending on whether bridging or terminal oxygens are involved). Therefore, the value of ΔHIIr must also depend on the redox potential of the cations in their highest valence and on the strength of the M−O−R and M−O−H bonds. Irreversible C−H bond activation and rapid vacancy reoxidation lead to O* most abundant surface intermediates during ODH reactions.31 Then, more reducible cations will lead to smaller values of ΔHIIr and ΔE1, to more facile reduction, and to higher ODH rates. The incipient cleavage of C−H bonds in alkanes, however, also depends on the electron density (basicity) of the lattice oxygen anions that abstract the H atoms.37 As mentioned earlier, Lewis acidity increases in the sequence V5+ < Mo6+ < W6+ and the electron density in the oxygen bonded to these cations increases in the sequence of VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2. Indeed, measured ODH turnover rates per MOx on catalysts with fully exposed two-dimensional oxide domains increased in the same sequence as the corresponding basicity of the oxygen anion. The reducibility of metal centers and the basicity of the active lattice oxygen species seem to account for the sequence of catalytic activities obtained in this study (VOx/ZrO2 > MoOx/ZrO2 > WOx/ZrO2; Figure 5).
Ultimately, very reducible oxides may become ineffective in ODH reactions because surfaces become devoid of oxygen as reduction steps become more facile than reoxidation. In such systems, O2 chemisorption rates become rate-determining and the rate actually decreases with increasing reducibility of the metal cations. This leads to a maximum rates on oxides with intermediate reducibility and to the volcano-type plots ubiquitous in heterogeneous catalysis. Similarly, intermediate basicity of lattice oxygens leads to maximum rates. As basicity increases, C−H bond activation steps become faster, but the subsequent recombination of OH groups to form water (step IV) slows down and the surface becomes predominantly covered with OH groups. Strong basicity can also increase the stability of alkoxide species. This, in turn, would decrease the rate of desorption of the desired alkenes and increase the probability that they will instead oxidize to undesired COx products.
Oxygen mobility and the rate of reoxidation of oxygen vacancies can also influence ODH reactions. At the low water concentrations prevalent at low propane conversions, the reaction rate constants depend only on KI and kII and they benefit from weaker Lewis acids and more reducible cations. As water concentrations increase, the term containing water concentration in the denominator of eq 1 becomes important, the oxygen order becomes slightly positive,31 and the apparent rate constant contains a rate constant (kV) corresponding to the reoxidation of vacancies by O2. The required dissociative chemisorption of O2 requires the migration of surface oxygen species in order to increase the probability of neighboring vacancies. In this case, lattice oxygen mobility becomes important; the Tamman temperature of metal oxides, defined as 0.5Tm (Tm, melting point in K) provides a qualitative measurement of oxygen mobility. Table 3 shows Tamman temperature of various metal oxides. 48 Tamman temperatures increase in the sequence
suggesting that VOx-based catalyst would remain more active than the other oxides at the high conversions required in order to obtain high alkene yields.

Intermediate reducibility, weak Lewis acid centers, and high oxygen mobility represent the essential requirements for selective ODH; they are consistent with the trends in ODH rates and in k2/k1 and k3/k1 ratios observed on VOx-, MoOx-, and WOx-based catalysts. They are also consistent with the widespread acceptance of VOx and MoOx as preferred ODH catalysts.1-5 A further decrease in the Lewis acidity of the cations in VOx and MoOx by modifications with oxides or supports of moderate or strong basicity (e.g., MgO, Cs2O), which increase the electron density at cation sites, should lead to less favorable adsorption of alkenes (smaller Δ(ΔHads), and to lower ΔE1 − ΔE3 and k3/k1 value. This is consistent with the generally higher alkene yields obtained on VOx species supported on MgO compared with similar species supported on more acidic oxides (e.g., Al2O3 and SiO2) supported catalysts.8,9 Strongly basic promoters (e.g., K2O, Cs2O), however, also influence the redox properties of the cations and can lead to an undesired decrease the rate of ODH reactions (by increasing ΔHIIr and ΔE1).28,49,50
Conclusions

The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane occurs via similar elementary steps on VOx and MoOx. The apparent activation energies for propane dehydrogenation and for propene combustion increase in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2, while the corresponding reaction rates decrease in this same sequence. Activation energies for propane ODH are higher than for propene combustion; this leads to a decrease in k3/k1 ratios as reaction temperature increases. This difference in activation energy (48−61 kJ/mol) is larger than the difference in bond dissociation enthalpy between the weakest C−H bonds in propane and propene and it increases in the sequence VOx/ZrO2 < MoOx/ZrO2 < WOx/ZrO2,. This suggests that the relative adsorption enthalpies of propene and propane also influence the relative reaction rates of these two molecules and that these adsorption effects depend on the Lewis acidity of the cations involved in π-bonding of alkenes on oxide surfaces. Propane ODH and propane combustion reactions show similar activation energies, suggesting that the steps involved in determining the fate of adsorbed alkoxide species (desorption vs subsequent oxidation) occur after the kinetically relevant C−H activation steps in propane. Metal oxides having high redox properties show high catalytic activity, and less acidic metal oxides lead to smaller ΔE1 − ΔE3 value and smaller k3/k1 ratio and hence higher propene yield.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
