Dehydrogenation of propane over high silica *BEA type gallosilicate (Ga-Beta)†
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is one of the most promising candidates for the propylene production process to meet the growing demand of propylene for the future. There is an urgent need to develop catalysts for PDH. In this work, we have synthesized high silica Ga-Beta as a new candidate for a catalyst from dealuminated zeolite using the dry gel conversion method. A high silica Ga-Beta catalyst with a Si/Ga ratio of up to 177 can be synthesized. In the PDH reaction, the synthesized Ga-Beta showed the highest propane conversion and the highest propylene yield amongst the Ga-based zeolites. The combination of the Ga species being incorporated into zeolite frameworks, its large microporosity and Brønsted acidity is likely to lead to the excellent catalytic performance of Ga-Beta. Moreover, Ga-Beta with a higher Si/Ga ratio shows a longer catalyst lifetime for the PDH reaction, since the coke deposition rate decreased with the decrease in the amount of acid. This work provides new insights for the PDH reaction over Ga-based zeolite catalysts, and contributes to the progress in the activation and transformation of light alkenes to value-added chemicals.
Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important materials for chemical production in the petrochemical industry: e.g. polypropylene, acrylonitrile, propylene oxide, and oxy alcohols are mainly produced from propylene.1–9 Propylene is mainly produced as one of the by-products of steam cracking of naphtha to produce ethylene; however, it is difficult to increase the yield of propylene. Furthermore, steam cracking of naphtha has gradually been replaced with that of ethane to produce ethylene more effectively, and the latter hardly yields any propylene; therefore, a shortage of propylene is anticipated. To meet the growing demand of propylene in the future, it is necessary to develop a process to produce propylene as the main product.
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) is the most promising candidate for this process because propylene can be directly and mainly produced using propane derived from abundant natural gas. Therefore, research efforts have focused on developing excellent catalysts for the PDH process. Catalysts based on Pt are well known to be highly effective for the PDH process.4–8,10–15 High propane conversion and propylene selectivity has been achieved for the PDH reaction using mesoporous silica doped with Pt and Sn.4 However, the cost disadvantage of using precious metals such as Pt prevents the catalysts based on precious metals from being used for practical applications. The representative catalyst based on non-precious metals for the PDH process is a series of zeolites modified with Zn or Ga ions.9,15–17 Zn species in zeolites are often reduced by H2 that is produced in the PDH reaction and vaporized under the high temperature of the reaction, therefore the stability of the zeolites modified with Zn is lower than that of the zeolites modified with Ga. Meanwhile, gallosilicate MFI zeolites have a lower rate of deactivation and higher propylene selectivity than the other zeolites doped with non-precious metals.9 However, the performance of the zeolites modified with Ga is much poorer for the PDH process than the performance of the catalysts based on Pt.
In order to develop zeolite catalysts based on non-precious metals that show high catalytic performance for the PDH process, we should focus on the reaction pathways in the zeolites. There are two pathways from propane to a number of chemicals using zeolites; the initial reaction step from propane is dehydrogenation to propylene, or cracking to ethylene and methane, and then aromatic compounds can be produced through the excessive reaction of the produced propylene or ethylene and methane, as shown in Fig. 1.18–21 To use zeolites for the PDH process, the cracking reaction and the excessive reactions in the present zeolites should be inhibited. For the Ga species incorporated into the zeolite frameworks as active sites for the PDH process, the Brønsted acidity is important for propylene selectivity in the initial step. Meanwhile, excess Brønsted acid sites promote excessive reactions, resulting in coke formation, and this causes low selectivity of the desired products and rapid deactivation. To inhibit the excessive reactions, high silica zeolites are preferred. In addition, the pore size and pore structure of the zeolites are important. Zeolite Beta, which is a *BEA type zeolite, has a three-dimensional porous network including 12-membered rings (12-MRs). Generally, larger micropores improve mass transfer. The micropores of zeolite Beta are larger than those of the widely used other structures such as the MFI and CHA structures, with 10-MRs and 8-MRs, respectively. The increase in diffusibility can result in the improvement of propane conversion and propylene selectivity. In addition, hierarchical pore structured Ga-MFI materials exhibit superior propane conversion efficiency and propylene selectivity in bulk Ga-MFI materials for the PDH process.17

These findings imply that a high silica zeolite Beta material with Ga (Ga-Beta) should be an ideal catalyst for the PDH process. Although normal methods are not applicable to synthesize high silica Ga-Beta, dry gel conversion (DGC) methods could be applicable. So far, unique zeolites have been synthesized by DGC methods; e.g. nano-sized SAPO-34,22 nano-sized Fe-MFI,23 and Ge incorporated aluminophosphate zeolite.24 Recently, we have reported that high silica zeolite Beta with Fe (Fe-Beta) can be synthesized by the DGC method using dealuminated Beta as one of the ingredients.25 In this synthesis, it was impossible to synthesize Fe-Beta without dealuminated Beta. Herein, we report the synthesis of high silica Ga-Beta by applying the modified DGC method. Moreover, we discuss the effects of acidity, the crystal structures and the oxidation states of Ga species on the PDH reaction. The structures of the obtained samples are clarified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis, and the acidic properties are evaluated by NH3 temperature programmed deposition (NH3-TPD) and Infrared (IR) spectroscopy of adsorbed CD3CN.
Experimental
The dealuminated Beta zeolite (deAl-Beta) material was prepared using commercially available Al-Beta (SiO2/Al2O3 = 28.9, Tosoh Co. Ltd.), referring to our previous work.24 Gallium nitrate, Ga(NO3)3·nH2O (Wako Pure Chemical) and 40 wt% colloidal silica (CS, Aldrich) were used as the Ga and Si sources, respectively. Tetraethylammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) that was used as an organic structure-directing agent (OSDA) was used in the form of a 35 wt% aqueous solution (Aldrich). The molar ratios of the precursor solution were 5SiO2 (CS) : 5SiO2 (deAl-Beta) : xGa2O3 : 2.5TEAOH : 0.33NaOH : 100H2O (x = 0.033, 0.025, and 0.0167). The precursor solutions were stirred at room temperature for 2 h, and then the solvents were evaporated. The obtained dry gel was crystallized at 393 K for 72 h under steam. To remove the OSDA, calcination under air was performed at 823 K for 5 h. The obtained sample was named Na/Ga-Beta. We used 0.1 mol L−1 aqueous ammonium nitrate solutions to change the cation from Na+ to NH4+. Then, calcination was performed at 823 K for 5 h to obtain the H+ type sample. The sample was denoted as ‘Ga-Beta’.
In addition, we also prepared Ga loaded deAl-Beta by impregnation to investigate the state of the Ga species on catalytic performance. The detailed procedures are shown below. The obtained deAl-Beta (1.0 g) material was suspended in 100 g of 1.7 mmol L−1 aqueous solution of Ga(NO3)3. After stirring at 343 K for 24 h, washing with deionized water and drying at 363 K, the obtained powder was calcined at 823 K for 5 h to give Ga/deAl-Beta.
The crystal structures of all products were determined by XRD patterns recorded on a PANalytical X'Pert-MPD diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation. The 71Ga MAS NMR spectrum was recorded at ambient temperature using 3.2 mm diameter zirconia rotors spinning at 15 kHz on an ECA-500 NMR (JEOL Ltd.) to evaluate the amount of Ga species. NH3-TPD was measured using a BEL CAT II and BEL mass analyzer (MicrotracBEL). IR spectra were collected on a Nicolet 380 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an MCT detector with an average of 100 scans at 4 cm−1 resolution in the 4000 to 400 cm−1 range. Before the IR measurements, samples were treated in a vacuum at 723 K for 4 h. CD3CN (Tokyo Chemical Industry) was adsorbed at 393 K for 1 h and evacuated at 423 K.
The PDH reaction over the zeolite catalysts was carried out using a fixed-bed reactor made of quartz glass (i.d. 4 mm) with a continuous-flow system under atmospheric pressure at 923 K. The composition of the feed gas was 10 mol% C3H8/90 mol% He and the gas was introduced at 10.2 mL min−1 (Ga-Beta-150, Al-Beta, Ga-MFI-150, Ga/deAl-Beta, and Na/Ga-Beta) or at 6.69 mL min−1 (Ga-Beta-200, Ga-MFI-200, and Ga/deAl-Beta-200). The products were analysed online with a Shimadzu GC-2025 and with a GC-2014 gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector. The propane conversion and the yields of the products were calculated according to the following equations:

(2)
where C denotes propane conversion [C-mol%], R0 denotes the initial amount of propane, Rf denotes the amount of propane after the reaction, Y denotes the product yield and P denotes the amount of the product. The coke contents of the catalysts were determined in a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA). The weight loss observed from 573 to 973 K was ascribed to the coke.
Results and discussion
We applied the DGC method using dealuminated zeolite to synthesize high silica Ga-Beta zeolite (see Experimental).25 The obtained Ga-Beta zeolite materials were named Ga-Beta-150, Ga-Beta-200 and Ga-Beta-300, corresponding to their initial Si/Ga ratios of 150, 200 and 300, respectively. XRD patterns for the Ga-Beta samples prepared using the precursors with different Si/Ga ratios show peaks derived from a *BEA structure at 8 and 23 degrees, as shown in Fig. 2. Since there are no other peaks, Ga-Beta zeolites do not contain any crystalline by-products such as gallium oxide or any aggregated Ga species. In addition, any peaks derived from amorphous species are not detected. However, we cannot know if the prepared samples contain Ga species using only XRD. According to SEM images, as shown in Fig. S1 (see ESI†), it can be revealed that Ga-Beta-150 and -200 have almost the same morphology.
Fig. 2 XRD patterns of the synthesized Ga-Beta samples and of deAl-Beta as the ingredient.
For comparison with Ga-Beta, we synthesized Ga/deAl-Beta from dealuminated Beta zeolite (see Experimental). We named Ga/deAl-Beta-100 and Ga/deAl-Beta-200 according to their initial Si/Ga ratios, 100 and 200. XRF measurements were carried out to determine the actual Si/Ga ratios in the Ga-Beta and Ga/deAl-Beta samples. XRF measurements indicated that all samples contained Ga species, as shown in Table 1. However, Si/Ga ratios of the Ga-Beta samples were smaller than those in the starting precursors, implying that the Si species was slightly dissolved and lost during washing. Such a phenomenon often occurs in the synthetic processes of high silica zeolites.26 Ga-Beta-300 shows exceptionally low Si/Ga ratios. The maximum Si/Ga ratio of the obtained Ga-Beta was 177, and this value was still high enough for this study. The states of the Ga species in the obtained zeolites needed to be clarified using other measurements.

The amount of acid sites in the obtained zeolites can be estimated by NH3-TPD measurements. The NH3-TPD profiles of the Ga-Beta zeolites show a peak derived from the Brønsted acid sites, as shown in Fig. 3(a). These results indicated that the Ga species is incorporated well into the framework of the *BEA structure and works as the acid site. In addition, the peak intensity of the NH3-TPD profile, which corresponds to the amount of acid sites, for Ga-Beta-200 was smaller than that for Ga-Beta-150. These results are consistent with the XRF analysis and imply the possibility of Ga-Beta to work as an acid catalyst for the PDH reaction.

The results of the NH3-TPD measurements for the other zeolites are shown in Fig. 3(b). Na/Ga-Beta (see Experimental) showed no peaks derived from the Brønsted acid sites; almost all counter cations are Na+ ions instead of from Brønsted acidity. Furthermore, the Ga/deAl-Beta sample also showed no peaks. This suggests that the Ga species is not incorporated into the framework, and the crystallization process by the DGC method in the presence of OSDA is required to incorporate the Ga species into the zeolite framework. In addition, we measured the CD3CN IR spectra (Fig. 4). This result also clarifies that Ga-Beta-200 has Brønsted acid sites, while Ga/deAl-Beta and Na/Ga-Beta do not.
Fig. 4 CD3CN spectra of Ga-Beta-200, Ga/deAl-Beta-200 and Na/Ga-Beta.
We measured the NMR spectra to determine the Ga species in the obtained Ga-Beta zeolites. A 71Ga MAS NMR spectrum for Ga-Beta-150 exhibited a signal derived from Ga3+ species with a tetrahedral framework at 150–160 ppm, whereas it did not show any peaks derived from extra-framework Ga species around 50 ppm as shown in Fig. 5.27–29 These results imply that the Ga species is incorporated well into the framework for the Ga-Beta samples. Meanwhile, the spectrum for Ga-Beta-200 showed no peaks; the amount of Ga species is likely to be too small. This result should be confirmed by the amount of acid sites.

The value X represents the ratio of the two reaction routes (propylene/(methane + ethylene)). As expected, Ga-Beta catalysts showed the highest propane conversion and propylene yield. We compared the Ga-Beta catalysts with various zeolite catalysts in detail to determine the factors that affect the catalytic activity (Fig. 6).
Fig. 6 Product distribution of PDH reactions over zeolite catalysts after 15 min.
The X value of Ga-Beta-200 is higher than that of Ga-Beta-150 despite having almost the same conversion value as Ga-Beta-150; the decrease of acid sites leads to an increase in the selectivity of the hydrogenation route. The low X value and relatively high propane conversion for the PDH process with Al-Beta indicates that the Al species promotes the cracking reaction much more than it promotes dehydrogenation. The low values for both conversion and X for Ga-MFI indicate that smaller micropores decrease diffusibility and prevent propane from being converted and the dehydrogenation route from being selected. Both of the Ga/deAl-Beta samples were inferior to the Ga-Beta catalysts. The comparisons of conversion and X values for both implies that it is difficult to improve both conversion and X simultaneously. These results indicate that the incorporation of Ga species into the zeolite framework is crucial to the catalytic performance. With all catalysts, except Na/Ga-Beta, the ethylene yield was almost twice as much as the methane yield. This result follows a theory and suggests the validity of the cracking route.
The inertness of the Na/Ga-Beta catalyst without Brønsted acidity indicates that acid sites are required to convert propane.
To evaluate the deactivation process of the Ga-Beta zeolites, the time courses of propane conversion, propylene yield and X value were measured, as shown in Fig. 7. The propane conversion and propylene yield of Ga-Beta-150 considerably decreased over 6 h. Meanwhile, Ga-Beta-200 maintained high performance for 6 h. This is clearly due to the difference in the number of acid sites present. The decrease in acid sites could result in the suppression of the undesirable excessive reaction and coke deposition. Ga-Beta-200 has mesoporosity, according to its N2 adsorption isomer, as shown in Fig. S2 (see ESI†). The mesoporosity may improve the diffusivity of the reactants and products, and this may result in the suppression of the undesirable excessive reaction and coke deposition. The amount of coke on each catalyst was also measured, as shown in Table 3. Although the reaction time was longer for Ga-Beta-200 than for Ga-Beta-150, the amount of coke was much smaller (Table 2). This indicates that the higher Si/Ga ratio is favorable not only for the higher selectivity for the dehydration route, but also for the longer lifetime of the catalyst. In addition, the mesoporosity of Ga-Beta-200 will also be favorable for the longer lifetime of the catalyst. These results suggest that the combination of Brønsted acidity, the Ga species being incorporated at a high Si/Ga ratio, and large microporosity is very important for catalytic performance.

Conclusions
We synthesized high silica Ga-Beta zeolites by the DGC method for catalysis of the PDH reaction. The obtained Ga-Beta zeolites showed the highest propane conversion and propylene yield in the Ga modified zeolites. The comparisons with other zeolite catalysts suggested that the substitution of Al to Ga, larger micropores and Brønsted acidity contributed to high propylene yield in the PDH reaction. In addition, an increase in the Si/Ga ratio resulted in the improvement of the lifetime of the catalyst. High silica Ga-Beta can be utilized as a promising catalyst based on non-precious metals to produce propylene effectively in the PDH reaction.
