Subnanometric Pt-Sn Monolayers Over a Rod-Shaped Al2O3 for Propane Dehydrogenation
Graphical Abstract
Pt−Sn monolayers on Al2O3 possessed a mass specific activity of 5.1 molC3H6 molPt−1 s−1 and a selectivity towards propylene of 96 % for propane dehydrogenation at 873 K. The amorphous nature of Pt−Sn alloy maximized the exposure of surficial Pt atoms and finely tuned the electronic property of Pt, promoting the activity and selectivity.
Abstract
Atomic layer deposition was applied to precisely disperse Pt on Sn-, K-modified Al2O3, while the dispersion of Pt depended strongly on the atmosphere. Pt presented as single-atoms in oxidative atmosphere but both single-atoms and clusters under reductive gas. After H2-treatment at 873 K, Pt single-atoms, clusters and particles co-existed in the catalysts, but their population varied considerably. The typical nanoparticles featured by crystallized Pt3Sn alloys, while the subnanometric clusters contained amorphous Pt−Sn alloys in a monolayer geometry. When tested for propane dehydrogenation at 873 K, the monolayers displayed outstanding performance; the mass specific activity approached 5.1 molC3H6 molPt−1 s−1, which was 2.7 times greater than that of particles. Structural analysis revealed that the amorphous Pt−Sn monolayer exposed more surficial Pt atoms surrounded by Sn atoms, which finely tuned the electronic property of Pt and thus favored the activation of C−H bond in propane.
Introduction
Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene, a commercialized process using Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, has received increasing attention in recent years for the utilization of light hydrocarbons and shale gas.1 This reaction is thermodynamic equilibrium-limit and highly endothermic, and thus it is industrially operated at elevated temperatures (823–973 K) for achieving a desired yield of propylene.1e As the C−H bonds are more stable than the C−C bonds in propane, the side reactions occurred simultaneously, such as hydrogenolysis and isomerization, lowered the selectivity towards propylene. Moreover, the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts suffer from rapid deactivation under the harsh reaction conditions, which is usually caused by the sintering of Pt particles and the accumulation of coke deposits.2 Therefore, improving the catalytic performance and the atomic efficiency of Pt atoms has been extensively pursued.
Propane dehydrogenation is a structure-insensitive reaction where all surface Pt atoms could be active, but the side reactions are structure sensitive and the coordinatively unsaturated Pt atoms on the steps and corners often possess a higher activity towards cracking.3 In this context, varying the size of Pt species (particles≥2 nm, clusters <2 nm and single-atoms) has demonstrated the profound impact of Pt dimension on the overall performance of Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, with respect to the activity, selectivity and stability. For example, as lowering the size of Pt particles from 21 to 3 nm, supported on SBA-15, the turnover frequency (TOF) decreased sharply from 0.2 to 0.08 s−1 and the selectivity towards propylene declined slightly from 75 % to 70 %.4 Similarly, reducing the size of Pt particles (supported on Mg(Al)O and SBA-15) from 9 to 1 nm increased the TOF from 0.45 to 1.28 s−1 at 793 K, but the selectivity of propylene decreased dramatically from 96 % to 52 %.5 Density functional theory calculations revealed that smaller Pt particles, dominated by the stepped facets, presented a lower energy barrier for breaking C−H bond and thus were more reactive for propane conversion, whereas large Pt particles, dominated by the {111} facets, favored propylene selectivity due to the its weaker adsorption.6 The reaction rate of PDH at 823 K over Pt clusters of 0.2–0.7 nm, confined within the internal framework cavities of MCM-22, was about two times of that for Pt particles of 3 nm.7 As the extreme case, Pt single-atoms on Al2O3 were active but they heavily sintered into clusters under the reductive atmospheres. Interestingly, the resulting Pt clusters (1 nm) enhanced the TOF (0.82 s−1) significantly, which was 5.5 times of the Pt single-atoms (0.15 s−1) for PDH at 873 K.8 In a sharp contrast, Pt single-atoms on a hierarchical Al2O3 gave a TOF of 4.25 s−1 at 848 K, approximately 3-fold and 7-fold higher than the corresponding clusters (0.8–2 nm) and particles (2.6–12 nm), respectively.9 Moreover, the selectivity of propene followed an order single-atoms (>92 %) > particles (>80 %) > clusters (<60 %). The positively-charged Pt single-atoms favored the breakage of C−H bond and weakened the adsorption of propylene, simultaneously promoting the activity and selectivity. Overall, the dimension of Pt species profoundly affected the behavior of PDH, in which Pt clusters (<2 nm) displayed prominent characters regarding the activity and selectivity. However, the chemical nature of such a size-dependent phenomenon is rarely known and remains strong debate. One practical reason is the complexity and difficulty in precisely controlling the size of Pt species: single-atoms were popularly realized by reducing the loading of Pt; uniformed particles (>2 nm) were generally prepared by liquid-phase reduction of Pt precursors with the aid of surfactants; while the fabrication of clusters was usually obtained by controlling the calcination or pre-reduction temperatures. However, these preparation conditions still resulted in diversity distribution of Pt species,10 which further affected the activity, selectivity and stability under the reaction conditions.10b, 11
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been applied to accurately tune the size of metal species based on its self-limited atom-by-atom growth pattern.12 For example, 1–2 nm Pt clusters were uniformly deposited on γ-Al2O3 by thermal ALD, which enhanced the activity for the water-gas shift reaction.13 More recently, Al2O3 layers with a thickness of 0.6-0.8 nm were deposited over Pt nanoparticles (0.8–1.2 nm) by ALD; they not only prevented the sintering of the metal particles during propane dehydrogenation, but also enhanced the selectivity of propylene up to 96 %.14 The Al2O3 overlayer selectively bonded to the undercoordinated sites on Pt clusters, while leaving the more selective terrace sites available for propane dehydrogenation. In this work, we deposited Pt species in the forms of single-atoms and monolayered clusters over a rod-shaped Al2O3 support by ALD with reactive gases. Further treatment with H2 at 873 K yielded Pt/Al2O3 catalysts that were dominated by 2–4 nm Pt−Sn particles and subnanometric Pt−Sn monolayers, respectively. Their catalytic performance for PDH at 873 K was examined and correlated to the atomic structure of the active Pt species.
Results and Discussion
Structural properties of the ALD-prepared Pt/Al2O3 samples
Figure 1 and 2 show the STEM images of the ALD-prepared Pt/Al2O3 samples. Over the O3-ALD sample, Pt single-atoms sparsely presented on the Al2O3 support, with a much weaker brightness because of the oxidation state (Figure 1). This preparation process included two sequential cycles: monolayer MeCpPtMe3 was chemically adsorbed on the surface of Al2O3 in the first cycle and O3 reacted with the metallic precursor in the second cycle, forming a layer of adsorbed O atoms on Pt surface. This meant that the surface reaction between MeCpPtMe3 and O3 generated PtOx species that retarded the nucleation of Pt.15 Therefore, only very few Pt single-atoms were identified, although the loading of Pt approached 0.10 wt%. On the H2-ALD sample, Pt single-atoms and subnanometric clusters (1.0 nm) were readily observed over the Al2O3 support (Figure 2). Moreover, the tiny clusters consisted of several to tens of Pt atoms that arranged loosely. The nucleation of Pt atoms during ALD on Al2O3 is usually difficult because the initial substrate could not efficiently initiate the reaction, and thus results in a slow growth of Pt species.16 Here, the H2-plasma may provide strong reducing species, such as atomic H or radicals species, to initiate the surface reaction of Al2O3 with the chemisorbed MeCpPtMe3 and promote the formation of metallic Pt, which subsequently catalyzes the surface reaction.17 Namely, more Pt atoms deposited in the proximity of metallic Pt species, which acted as the seeds to induce the growth of Pt clusters in addition to atoms evenly distributed over Al2O3 surface.18 As a result, both Pt single-atoms and clusters (1.0 nm) co-existed on the H2-ALD sample with a similar metal loading of 0.11 wt%. EDX mapping analysis of the as-prepared samples was conducted to distinguish the surface composition (Figure S1). Both samples showed a clear signal of Al, however, the signals of Pt/Sn/K were very weak due to the very low loading of 0.1–0.5 wt%. This reaffirmed that Pt/Sn/K were highly dispersed on γ-Al2O3, in line with the STEM images. All these observations illustrated that the ALD atmosphere distinctly modified the growth manner of Pt species on the Al2O3 support.

Figure 3 presents the H2-TPR profiles of the ALD-prepared Pt/Al2O3 samples. The Sn-, K-doped Al2O3 support displayed a weak and board reduction for SnOx in the range of 363–813 K with a H2 consumption of 0.063 mmol H2 g−1, which was lower than the stoichiometric amount of 0.084 mmol H2 g−1 by assuming SnO2. This meant a substantial amount of SnOx still interacted strongly with Al2O3.19 The O3-ALD sample showed H2 consumptions at 502, 624 and 814 K. The low-temperature peak corresponded to the reduction of PtOx,20 while the amount of H2 consumed (0.109 mmol H2 g−1) was much higher than the stoichiometric value (0.010 mmol H2 g−1) by assuming PtO2. This suggested that PtOx strongly interacted with SnOx, in which Pt facilitated the reduction of SnOx via the H spillover effect.19, 20 The subsequent peaks represented further reduction of SnOx at high temperatures.19, 20 The H2-ALD sample displayed a similar reduction pattern but with an additional H2 consumption at 286 K. This could be ascribed to the reduction of PtOx species with the assistance of the neighboring metallic Pt species.21 The peaks at 516 and 726 K were referred to the reductions of PtOx and SnOx, respectively.20 Notably, the total amount of H2 consumed was much less than that for the O3-ALD sample, reaffirming the dominant presence of metallic Pt species.

STEM observations on the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts
The ALD-prepared samples were then treated with a 90 % H2/Ar mixture at 873 K for 2 h, and the resulting Pt/Al2O3 catalysts were labeled as Pt-particle (obtained from the O3-ALD sample) and Pt-monolayer (originated from the H2-ALD sample). All the diffraction peaks on the XRD patterns were ascribed to γ-Al2O3 (Figure S2). There was not any characteristic diffraction peaks of Pt, Sn and K species, indicating that Pt/Sn/K species were highly dispersed on the surface of γ-Al2O3. Pt dispersion over these catalysts was analyzed by STEM. Pt presented as single-atoms, subnanometric clusters (<2 nm) and particles (≥2 nm) in both cases, but their population changed considerably. The fraction of Pt species was estimated by counting at least 700 single-atoms, clusters and nanoparticles, while the atomic percentage for the respective Pt species was calculated by assuming an icosahedron model.22 On the Pt-particle catalyst, Pt species distributed from single-atoms to 4 nm particles with an average size of around 0.8 nm (Figure 4a & Figure S3). The fully isolated single-atoms had an atomic percentage of less than 3 %. The subnanometric clusters possessed a two-dimensional raft-like morphology and consisted of loosely arranged ensembles of several to tens of surface atoms with an atomic occupation of 32 % (Figure 4e & Figure S3d-f), judged from the brightness variations relevant to that of the single-atoms.23 Notably, the particles had the average size of 2.5 nm and the atomic percentage occupied 65 %. The lattice distances of 0.20 and 0.18 nm, observed on the typical particles (Figure 4b, c), evidenced the {200} and {210} facets of Pt3Sn alloy, respectively.24 The lattice distances of 0.14 and 0.22 nm, with a dihedral angle of 35.3°, observed over another particle (3 nm, Figure 4d), were referred to the {220} and {111} facets of Pt3Sn alloys, respectively.2b, 24 Moreover, the surficial atoms on the particles arranged loosely.

(f) Atomic percentages for the respective Pt species (single-atoms, clusters (<2 nm) and particles (≥2 nm)), roughly estimated by assuming a icosahedron model.
For the Pt-monolayer catalyst, Pt species narrowed in the range of single-atoms to 2.5 nm particles with a mean size of 0.5 nm (Figure 5a & Figure S4). The atomic proportion of Pt was dominated by the tiny clusters with a percentage of 81 %, while the fractions occupied by Pt single-atoms and nanoparticles were only 10 % and 9 %, respectively (Figure 5g). The particles were apparently less crystallized and did not show any well-defined lattice fringes. Pt atoms on the small clusters arranged very loosely because of the low crystalline nature. Interestingly, Sn atoms, in a lower contrast, were observed to highly disperse around the Pt clusters (Figure 5b–c), suggesting amorphous Pt−Sn alloys.25 The cluster possessed a one-atomic-layer geometry (Figure 5d–f), implicating the exposure of all Pt atoms. This meant that the raft-like clusters consisted of Pt ensembles in a low-nuclearity, where the Pt atom was isolated by the surrounding Sn atoms via forming Pt−Sn nanoalloys. In short, the Pt-monolayer catalyst featured by Pt−Sn subnanometric clusters (1.0 nm) with an atomic proportion of 81 %, mostly in a monolayer geometry; but the Pt-particle sample dominated by Pt particles of around 2.5 nm with an atomic population of 65 %.

IR and XPS analysis on the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts
The coordination environment of the Pt-monolayer and Pt-particle samples was explored by DRIFTS using CO as a probe molecule. As shown in Figure 6, the adsorption of CO on the Pt-monolayer sample showed a strong vibration at 2063 cm−1, which could be assigned to the linear adsorption of CO on low-coordinated Pt sites.26 This reaffirmed that the monolayer cluster consisted of Pt ensembles in a low-nuclearity, in accordance with STEM images. In contrast, the Pt-particle sample presented a broad band at 2044 cm−1 and a shoulder at 2060 cm−1. The former was attributed to CO adsorption on the Pt atoms at the corner and edge over Pt3Sn particles, while the latter was tentatively ascribed to CO adsorption on PtSn clusters.27 Notably, two weak adsorptions at 1973 cm−1 and 1927 cm−1, attributed to the bridge adsorption of CO,28 were observed. This demonstrated that larger ensemble of Pt atoms presented on Pt-particles, in line with the STEM images.

Figure 7 shows the XPS spectra of Pt 4d and Sn 3d on the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts. Pt 4d spectra were used to discriminate the chemical state of Pt species, because the binding energy of Pt 4f5/2 (74.3 eV) heavily overlaps with that of Al 2p (74.7 eV). Deconvolution of the Pt 4d spectra yielded two types of Pt species: the binding energies at 314.4 and 316.9 eV corresponded to the metallic Pt0 and the positively-charged Ptδ+, respectively.24 The percentages of Pt0 and Ptδ+ on the Pt-particle catalyst were 73 % and 27 %, respectively. The fraction of Pt0 on the Pt-monolayer catalyst slightly increased to 76 % whereas that of Ptδ+ moderately decreased to 24 % (Table 1). The substantial amount of Ptδ+ in both samples evidenced that the Pt atoms alloyed with Sn atoms. The XPS spectra of Sn 3d consisted of two contributions at 486.4 and 487.2 eV; the former was referred to Sn0 while the latter indicated Sn2+ or Sn4+.19, 24 The fraction of Sn0 on the Pt-particle sample was 54 %, but it sharply declined to only 36 % on the Pt-monolayer sample (Table 1). This agrees well with the H2-TPR result and reaffirms the extensive reduction of SnOx via hydrogen spillover from the neighboring Pt particle. The higher content of Sn0 on the Pt-particle catalyst favored the formation of Pt3Sn nanoalloys; while the oxidized Sn2+ or Sn4+ in the Pt-monolayer catalyst stabilized the Pt−Sn clusters via Pt−O−Sn bonding.29 Moreover, the Pt/Sn surface atomic ratio on both samples were estimated to be 0.4, remarkably larger than the theoretical Pt/Sn atomic ratio of 0.1. This indicates a surface Pt enrichment, especially on the Pt-monolayer sample, which is consisent with the dominant population of subnanometric Pt−Sn clusters as evidenced by the STEM images.

Propane dehydrogenation
The Pt/Al2O3 catalysts, with identical Pt loadings (0.10–0.11 wt%), were tested comparatively for propane dehydrogenation at 873 K with a 50 % C3H8/45 % H2/5 % Ar mixture (Figure 8). On the Pt-monolayer catalyst, the conversion of propane gradually dropped from 14.4 % at the initial stage to 10.5 % at the end of operation (11.6 hours) while the selectivity of propylene kept practically identical, only marginally varying between 98 % and 96 %. In a sharp contrast, the Pt-particle catalyst was much less active and poorly selective. The conversion of propane was only 5 % at the beginning and declined to 2 % at 11.6 h; while the selectivity towards propene decreased from 95 % to 90 % within 11.6 hours. The outstanding performance of Pt-monolayer was further supported by the variations in the by-products (Figure S5); the selectivity of the byproducts (mainly CH4, C2H6 and C2H4) increased from 2 % to 4 % within 11.6 hours. Whereas the Pt-particle catalyst displayed a prominent character that the decreasing selectivity toward propylene was accompanied by the increasing selectivity of the byproducts (CH4, C2H6 and C2H4) from 5 % to 10 %. This indicated that the ability of Pt species on the Pt-particle catalyst for breaking the C−C bond in propane, i. e. hydrocracking, was enhancing along with the reaction time; whereas the Pt-monolayer catalyst favored the breaking of C−H bond and kept a stable performance relevant to the Pt-particle catalyst. The mass specific activity, defined as (molC3H6 molPt−1 s−1) at the initial stage of propane dehydrogenation, approached 5.1 molC3H6 molPt−1 s−1 on the Pt-monolayer catalyst but it was only 1.9 molC3H6 molPt−1 s−1 for the Pt-particle catalyst. Accordingly, the TOF was approximately estimated to be 11.0 s−1 for the monolayer and 7.5 s−1 for the particle, according to the Mackay icosahedral model.22 This further demonstrated that the specific activity of surface Pt atoms on the monolayer was higher than that on the particle.

The spent Pt-particle and Pt-monolayer catalysts were further studied by STEM images and Raman spectroscopy. Generally, Pt species still presented as single-atoms, subnanometric clusters (<2 nm) and particles (≥2 nm) in both cases (Figure 8c–d). Over the spent Pt-particle sample, the average size of Pt marginally changed from 0.8 to 0.9 nm (Figure S6), but the size distribution extended from 0.1–4.5 to 0.1–5.5 nm, indicative of slight sintering. The dominant Pt3Sn alloy was evidenced by the lattice fringe of 0.22 nm on Pt particles (Figure S6). The larger particles catalyzed propane cracking to form methane and ethane/ethylene, and thus lowered the selectivity towards propylene.9 For the spent Pt-monolayer catalyst, the mean size slightly increased from 0.5 to 0.7 nm (Figure S7), but most Pt remained at monolayer geometry. In addition, Raman spectra of the spent Pt/Al2O3 samples identified the chemical nature of the deposited cokes (Figure S8). Two distinct bands were detected at about 1328 cm−1 (D band) and 1604 cm−1 (G band). The former is usually ascribed to the structural imperfection of graphite, while the latter is attributed to the in-plane carbon–carbon stretching vibrations of the graphite layers.29, 30 The intensity ratio between the D and G bands (ID/IG) indexes the crystalline order of graphite; the lower ID/IG value, the higher graphitization degree of carbon deposit. The ID/IG value calculated by curve-fitting of the spectra for both samples yielded quite close values of 0.55 and 0.59, clearly indicating the similar graphitization degree of cokes. However, the D and G bands on the spent Pt-particle sample intensified considerably, meaning a relatively higher amount of carbon deposition.
The Pt/Sn molar ratio and the geometry of Pt−Sn alloys have been verified to affect remarkably the catalytic performance for PDH.24, 25, 27a, 29-31 Subnanometric PtSn clusters (0.75 nm) with a Pt/Sn molar ratio of 1/3, supported on θ-Al2O3, yielded a mass specific activity of 1.01 molC3H6 molPt−1 s−1 at 823 K, primarily due to the alloying effect of Pt−Sn.31b 0.5–0.6 nm PtSn clusters in a Pt/Sn molar ratio of 1/3.7, confined in the channel of pure silica ZSM-5, featured by a mass specific activity of as high as 3.5 molC3H6 molPt−1 s−1 and a rather stable performance at 873 K. PtSn clusters containing less than 15 Pt atoms and 2–3 Sn atoms, coordinated with the channel of zeolites via Pt−O−Sn bonding, were proposed to be the active sites for PDH.29 More recently, 1.3 nm PtSn clusters with a Pt/Sn molar ratio of 1/1, supported on SiO2, catalyzed PDH at the thermodynamically limited conversion levels with a mass specific activity of 1.2 molC3H6 molPt−1 s−1 at 853 K.30 The atomic mixing of Pt and Sn in the Pt1Sn1 alloy and its interaction with the SiO2 support in a proper geometry was viewed to be responsible for the outweighed performance. As such, the higher activity and selectivity of the Pt-monolayer catalyst (Table S1) could be correlated to the densely-populated subnanometric Pt−Sn cluster. This monolayer configuration not only significantly enhanced the dispersion of Pt but also drastically modified the electronic feature of Pt via forming amorphous Pt−Sn alloy. By contrast, the Pt-particle catalyst featured by crystallized Pt3Sn alloy, which lowered the fraction of surface Pt atoms and altered the electronic structure of Pt, resulting in inferior activity and selectivity for propane dehydrogenation.
Conclusion
The dispersion of Pt species over Al2O3 strongly depended on the atmospheres during the atomic layer deposition. Oxidative gas favored the atomic dispersion of Pt while reductive atmosphere resulted in the co-existence of Pt single-atoms and Pt clusters of about 1 nm. After hydrogen reduction at 873 K, the former yielded Pt particles of 2.5 nm while the latter evolved into subnanometric Pt monolayers. The Pt-particle was featured by crystallized Pt3Sn alloys while the Pt-monolayer contained amorphous Pt−Sn alloys where the Pt atom was spatially isolated by Sn atoms. As tested for propane dehydrogenation at 873 K, the Pt-monolayer showed much higher activity and selectivity than the Pt-particle, because of the modified electronic feature of Pt in the monolayer geometry.
Experimental Section
Catalyst Preparation
The rod-shaped γ-Al2O3, with the diameter of 12 nm and the length of 126 nm, was prepared by a hydrothermal method, as we described recently.32 It was then doped with 0.50 wt% Sn and 0.25 wt% K by co-impregnation of an aqueous solution containing SnCl2 and KCl. After washing with hot water, the solid was dried at 353 K overnight and then calcined in air at 873 K for 4 h, referring to the Al2O3 support. The contents of Sn and K in Al2O3 were 0.52 wt% and 0.25 wt%, respectively, as determined by ICP analysis.
Pt was then loaded on the Al2O3 support by ALD, which was performed in a commercial Picosun SUNALETM R200 system. High purity nitrogen (99.99 %), used as the carrier gas, continuously passed through the chamber with a base pressure of below 10 hPa. The Pt source ((methylcyclopentadienyl)trimethylplatinum, MeCpPtMe3) was heated to 338 K to generate sufficient vapor pressure and the lines were heated at 348 K to avoid condensation. 0.30 g Al2O3 support was spread on sand plates in a glass bowl. The O3-aided ALD was carried out at a substrate temperature of 523 K and O3 was used as an oxygen source, generated from 99.5 % O2/0.5 % N2 in an ozone generator. For each ALD cycle, the pulse and purge times for MeCpPtMe3 were 40 and 1500 s (25 continuous pulse of 1.6 and 60 s), and those for O3 were 100 and 600 s (10 continuous pulse of 10 and 60 s), respectively. H2-Plasma enhanced ALD was performed at a substrate temperature of 523 K and the hydrogen source was generated by passing a 5 % H2/N2 mixture through a plasma source (Advanced Energy). The pulse and purge times for MeCpPtMe3 and H2 plasma were the same as that for O3-aided ALD. The Pt loading in both cases was practically identical, 0.10–0.11 wt%, determined by ICP analysis.
Structural characterizations
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a SmartLab diffractometer (Rigaku) using a nickel-filtered Cu Ka (λ=0.15418 nm) radiation source that was operated at 40 kV and 200 mA.
Nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms were recorded at 77 K using an ASAP 2020 instrument (Micromeritics). Before the measurement, the sample was degassed at 573 K for 4 h. The specific surface area was calculated by a multipoint Braunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis of N2 isotherm adsorption. The specific surface area of Al2O3 support was determined to be 117.9 m2 g−1.
High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images were taken on a spherical aberration corrected JEM-ARM300F microscope operated at 300 kV. The specimen was prepared by ultrasonically dispersing the sample powder in ethanol, and depositing droplets of the suspension on a carbon-coated copper grid, and drying in air.
X-ray photoelectron spectra of the Pt/Al2O3 catalysts were recorded on a Thermofisher ESCALAB 250Xi instrument using an Al Kα radiation source (1486.6 eV). The powder samples were pressed into thin discs and mounted on a sample rod placed in the analysis chamber, where the spectra of Pt 4d, Sn 3d and C 1s were recorded. The charging effect was corrected by adjusting the binding energy of C 1s to 284.8 eV.
Raman spectra were recorded over a Renishaw inVia spectrometer with a resolution of 1.5 cm−1. A solid laser line at 532 nm was used as the exciting source.
Diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra (DRIFTS) of CO adsorption was taken on a Bruker Vertex 80v spectrometer. The sample was pre-reduced at 873 K by H2 for 2 h. IR data were accumulated at 298 K by recording 32 scans with a resolution of 4 cm−1. Before exposure to CO, a spectrum of the reduced sample was recorded as the background reference.
Temperature-programmed reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPR) of the samples was done with an Autochem II 2920 (Micromeritics). 300 mg of sample (40–60 mesh) was loaded into a U-type quartz reactor (9 mm, inner diameter) and pretreated with N2 (30 mL min−1) at 473 K for 1 h. After being cooled to 223 K under N2 flow (30 mL min−1), the sample was exposed to a 5.0 vol % H2/Ar mixture (30 mL min−1) and then heated to 1073 K at a rate of 5 K min−1. The amount of hydrogen consumed was analyzed with a thermal conductivity detector.
Catalytic test
Propane dehydrogenation was tested with a continuous flow fixed-bed quartz tubular reactor (inner diameter, 6 mm) under atmospheric pressure. 100 mg sample was placed between two layers of quartz wool inside the reactor, and reduced with a 90 vol % H2/Ar mixture (30 mL min−1) at 873 K for 2 h. After purging with Ar flow for 10 min, the feed gas (50 % C3H8/45 % H2/5 % Ar, 60 mL min−1) was introduced into the reactor through a mass-flow controller. The effluent from the reactor was analyzed using an online gas chromatogram (Agilent 7890B) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector and a flame ionization detector. The conversion of propane and the selectivity of propylene were calculated according to the composition of the exist gas.
Fin/Fout was the gas flowrate and calibrated by the internal standard gas (Ar).

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
