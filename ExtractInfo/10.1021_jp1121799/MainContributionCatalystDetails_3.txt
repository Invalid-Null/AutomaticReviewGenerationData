 Based on my analysis of the document, it does not pertain to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The document discusses density functional theory calculations on propane and propene adsorption on Pt and PtSn surfaces, but does not relate this to converting propane to propylene through dehydrogenation reactions. Therefore, I will not extract catalyst details or performance enhancements.
