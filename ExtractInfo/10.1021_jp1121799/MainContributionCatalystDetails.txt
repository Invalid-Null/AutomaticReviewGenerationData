 Based on the multiple extractions provided, the documents do not seem relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation research. The documents discuss density functional theory calculations on propane and propene adsorption on Pt and PtSn alloy surfaces, but do not directly relate to converting propane to propylene through PDH or ODH processes. 

Since the documents are not relevant, I have indicated "No" for relevance and will not include any catalyst or performance enhancement details.
