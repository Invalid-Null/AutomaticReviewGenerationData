 Based on the analysis of the supplied document, this does not appear to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The document discusses adsorption and dehydrogenation of various hydrocarbons like propane, propene, C and H atoms on Pt and PtSn alloy surfaces, but does not specifically focus on converting propane to propylene through PDH or ODH processes. Since the core objective of PDH/ODH is not covered, I am unable to extract the key details requested in the template.
