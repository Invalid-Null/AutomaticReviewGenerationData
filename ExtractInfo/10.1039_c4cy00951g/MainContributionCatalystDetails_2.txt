The given document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically for the conversion of propane to propylene. The document examines dehydrogenation of propane over PtSnAl/SBA-15 catalysts, but does not mention converting propane to propylene or detail improvements related to propylene yield/selectivity. Therefore, it does not seem directly relevant to PDH or ODH for propylene production.
