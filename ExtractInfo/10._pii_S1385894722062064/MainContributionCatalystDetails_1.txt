The supplied document does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It discusses neither the conversion of propane to propylene nor any related catalysts or processes. The document focuses on nickel phosphide catalysts for dehydrogenation of ethane to ethylene. Therefore, I have indicated that the document is not relevant to the topics of propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation.
