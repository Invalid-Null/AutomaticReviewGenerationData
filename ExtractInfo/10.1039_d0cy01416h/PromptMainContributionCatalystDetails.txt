TiO2-Supported catalysts with ZnO and ZrO2 for non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane: mechanistic analysis and application potential†
Non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is one of the most promising technologies for propene production in terms of environmental impact and sustainability. The purpose of the present study was to develop environmentally friendly and low-cost alternatives to currently applied Pt- or CrOx-based catalysts. Rutile TiO2-based catalysts with supported ZnOx and ZrOx species were established to show promising performance under industrially relevant conditions. The amount of propene produced within 3 h on propane stream at 550 °C over the optimized catalyst with 2 wt% Zn and 5.6 wt% Zr is close to that obtained over commercial-like K–CrOx/Al2O3 and the state-of-the-art Cu/YZrOx catalyst. The selectivity to propene over our catalyst was about 95% at a propane conversion of about 23%. The kind of active sites and the effect of ZrO2 addition on catalyst performance and physicochemical properties were elucidated owing to the application of complementary characterisation techniques such as XRD, N2 physisorption, HRTEM, EDX, XPS, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, NH3-TPD, CO-TPR, Raman and O2-TPO. ZnOx clusters with 1–3 Zn atoms were concluded to be the active sites. ZrO2 enhances their intrinsic activity and inhibits the formation of the inactive rhombohedral ZnTiO3 phase.
1. Introduction
As propene is one of the most important building blocks in the petrochemical industry, its demand increases year by year continuously.1 However, propene classically produced through oil-based fluid catalytic cracking and steam cracking cannot fulfil the market demand.1 Therefore, alternative technologies such as metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes, methanol to propene and non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene (PDH) have been commercialized.2–6 Attractive, yet not commercialized approaches are the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence7,8 or the absence9,10 of gas-phase oxygen. Among them, the PDH reaction attracts more and more attention due to the developments of shale gas industry.11
Stimulated by the high price or toxicity of commercial Pt- or CrOx-containing PDH catalysts, various research groups around the world focus on developing alternative catalysts based on VOx, GaOx, FeOx, CoOx or SnOx using Al2O3, SiO2 or zeolites as supports.12–20 More recently, bulk ZrO2-based catalysts were demonstrated to be active and selective for alkane dehydrogenation.21–23 According to DFT calculations,24,25 two coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus) form the active sites. Their concentration depends on ZrO2-reducibility, which can be tuned through the usage of supported metals able to activate hydrogen, doping of ZrO2 with oxides of metals with lower oxidation state than 4+, the size of ZrO2 crystallite and the kind of ZrO2 phase.
In comparison with the above-mentioned metal oxides, ZnO-based catalysts are attractive due to the low price and environmental compatibility of this metal oxide. They have also been tested in the PDH reaction. For example, ZnO/Al2O3 promoted with 0.1 wt% Pt showed higher activity and on-stream stability than its Pt-free counterpart.26 Isolated Zn cations supported on SiO2 (ref. 27) or highly dispersed ZnO clusters stabilized by a nitrogen-doped carbon layer or supported on the dealuminated β-zeolite28,29 can dehydrogenate propane, too. However, ZnO-based catalysts generally suffer from low activity and selectivity due to cracking and coking reactions.
TiO2, an earth abundant, low-cost and environmentally friendly material, finds its application in various fields such as gas sensors,30 solar energy utilization31 and heterogenous catalysis.32 It can be stabilized in three different phases, i.e. anatase, brookite and rutile, with the latter being more stable at high temperatures.33 In heterogenous catalysis, TiO2 is mainly applied as support for preparation of catalysts for CO oxidation,34 water-gas shift reaction,35 CO2 hydrogenation,36 dry reforming of methane37 and oxidative dehydrogenation of light alkanes.38–41 In addition, TiO2 has also been used as modifier for Pt to promote propene desorption and migration of coke species from Pt to the support in the PDH reaction.42
Against the above background, this study was aimed to develop active, selective, and on-stream stable catalysts based on low-cost and environmentally compatible ZnO and TiO2 for the PDH reaction. Particularly, we focused on elucidating the kind of active sites and on the effect of ZrO2 addition on their formation and catalytic performance. To reach the scientific objectives, the catalysts were characterized as thorough as possible using X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), energy-dispersed X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) and temperature-programmed reduction with CO (CO-TPR). Kinetic steady-state tests provide the basis for establishing activity–property relationships required for tailored catalyst design.
2. Experimental details
2.1. Catalyst preparation
Catalysts containing either Zn, Zr or Zn and Zr were prepared through an impregnation method. Typically, desired amounts of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (99%, Merck) and/or ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O (99%, Sigma Aldrich) were dissolved in 8 mL of deionized water. 3 g of R-TiO2 (rutile, Sachtleben Chemie GmbH), ZrO2 (Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo Co), Al2O3 (chempur), AlSiOx (24% Al2O3, Saint-Gobain NorPro) or SiO2 (Davisil Grade 643, Sigma Aldrich) were added to this solution. The suspension was stirred continuously at 65 °C until it became a dense slurry. Hereafter, the slurry was dried at room temperature overnight, further dried at 100 °C for 6 h and finally calcined at 600 °C for 4 h with a ramp of 3 K min−1. For preparation of catalysts with 0.5 wt% Zn, an aqueous Zn(NO3)2·6H2O solution of 0.1 g mL−1 was used. For comparison, the bare support R-TiO2 was treated according to the above calcination procedure. The non-calcined and calcined bare supports are denoted as R-TiO2 and R-Ti-HT respectively. The mono-metallic Zn-containing catalysts with 0.5, 1, 2 or 4 wt% Zn are abbreviated as 0.5ZnTi, 1ZnTi, 2ZnTi or 4ZnTi. The Zn- and Zr-containing catalysts with x wt% Zn (x = 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 10) or 1.4 wt% Zr are named as 0.5Zn1.4ZrT, 1Zn1.4ZrTi, 2Zn1.4ZrTi, 4Zn1.4ZrTi, 6Zn1.4ZrTi or 10Zn1.4ZrTi. Their counterparts with 2 wt% Zn and x wt% Zr (x = 2.8 or 5.6) are 2Zn2.8ZrTi and 2Zn5.6ZrTi respectively. A reference TiO2-based catalyst with 2 wt% Zr is abbreviated as 2ZrTi. ZrO2-based catalyst with 2 wt% Zn is abbreviated as 2ZnZr. 4ZnAl, 4ZnAlSi and 4ZnSi are abbreviations for the catalysts on the basis of Al2O3, AlSiOx and SiO2 supports with 4 wt% Zn respectively.
A commercial-like K–CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst was prepared according to a patent from SüdChemie.43 Briefly, two aqueous solutions containing either 1.633 g of CrO3 (99.9%, Sigma Aldrich) or 0.07 g of KOH (98%, Fluka) were prepared separately. Hereafter, 5 g of Al2O3 (Saint-Gobain NorPro) were impregnated with these solutions. The obtained precursor was dried at 120 °C for 12 h and calcined at 760 °C for 4 h with a ramp of 10 K min−1. The catalyst is denoted as K–Cr/Al.
Cu(NO3)2·3H2O (99%, Acros) and YZrOx (14% Y2O3, Daiichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo Co) were used to prepare a Cu/YZrOx catalyst with Cu loading of 0.05 wt%. Considering the low loading of Cu, an aqueous Cu(NO3)2·3H2O solution of 0.1 g mL−1 was prepared. 3 g of YZrOx were added to this solution and heated to 65 °C under continuously stirring until a slurry was formed. The obtained slurry was dried at room temperature, further dried at 100 °C for 1 h and calcined at 600 °C (heating ramp of 10 K min−1) for 4 h. The catalyst is denoted as CuYZr.
2.2. Characterization
Nitrogen physisorption measurements were performed on a Belsorp mini II setup (Bel Japan) in liquid nitrogen (77 K). The catalysts were pre-treated at 250 °C for 2 h to remove absorbed water before testing.
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were carried out in a 2theta range between 5 and 80° on a theta/theta diffractometer X'Pert Pro (Panalytical) equipped with an X'Celerator RTMS detector employing Cu Kα radiation of 1.5418 Å (40 kV, 40 mA).
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and energy-dispersive X-ray distribution of element concentration were obtained on a FEI F20 field emission source electron microscope equipped with a LaB6 electron gun. The accelerating voltage was 150 kV.
Raman spectra of fresh catalysts were collected on a Renishaw inVia Raman microscope using a 633 nm laser with a laser power of 8.05 mW. To obtain the spectra of spent catalysts (after 3 h on propane stream, see section 2.3 “Catalytic tests”), a laser power of 0.161 mW was applied for the 2Zn1.4ZrTi and 2Zn5.6ZrTi catalysts and a laser power of 1.61 mW was used for the 2ZnTi catalyst. The samples were mounted onto object slides and an objective with a magnification of 50× was applied. To prove the homogeneity of the materials, the spectra were acquired at different spots.
X-ray absorption spectra at the Zn K absorption edge were recorded at the P65 beamline of the PETRA III synchrotron radiation source (DESY, Hamburg, Germany) in transmission mode. The energy of the X-ray photons was selected by a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator and the beam size was set by means of slits to 0.2 (vertical) × 1.5 (horizontal) mm2. The spectra were normalized and the extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra (EXAFS) background was subtracted using the Athena program from the IFFEFIT software package.44 The k2-weighted EXAFS functions were Fourier transformed (FT) in the k range of 2–10.5 Å−1 and multiplied by a Hanning window with a sill size of 1 Å−1. k1 and k2-weighted EXAFS data were modelled using the Demether (IFFEFIT)45 by a least square method in R-space between 1.0 and 3.2 Å. The amplitude reduction factor S02 =1.05 was obtained by fitting the ZnO reference spectrum to a wurtzite structural model (ICSD collection code 34477). A model used for the fits was based on the wurtzite (ZnO, ICSD 34477) and two ZnTiO3 structures (R 3 c H, ICSD 194214, and R −3 R, ICSD 262709). Coordination numbers (CN), interatomic distances (R), energy shift (δE0) and mean square deviation of interatomic distances (σ2) were refined during fitting. The absolute misfit between theory and experiment is expressed by ρ.
XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) measurements were performed on Thermo Fisher K-Alpha. The electron binding energies were adjusted by the position of C 1s with a binding energy of 284.8 eV.
Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) measurements were carried out on an in-house-developed setup equipped with eight parallel fixed-bed reactors. Generally, 100 mg each catalyst was loaded in the reactor and heated to 550 °C in Ar with a ramp of 10 K min−1. Hereafter, the catalysts were calcined in air at 550 °C for 1 h and then reduced at the same temperature in 50 vol% H2/Ar for 1 h. The catalysts were cooled down to 120 °C and exposed to a mixture of 1 vol% NH3/Ar for 90 min. Hereafter, the catalysts were purged with Ar at 120 °C for 2 h and cooled down to 80 °C and tempered in the same flow for another 2 h. Afterwards, they were heated to 900 °C in Ar with a ramp of 10 K min−1. NH (atomic mass unit of 15) and Ar (atomic mass unit of 40) signals were collected by an online mass-spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320).
Temperature-programmed reduction tests with CO (CO-TPR) were performed on the same setup used for the NH3-TPD tests. The catalysts (50 mg) were loaded into the reactors, heated to 550 °C in Ar with and then exposed to air at the same temperature for 1 h. Afterwards, the catalysts were cooled to 40 °C and exposed to 1 vol% CO/Ar mixture. Finally, the catalysts were heated to 900 °C with a ramp of 10 K min−1. Signals of CO (atomic mass unit of 28), CO2 (atomic mass unit of 44) and H2 (atomic mass unit of 2) were recorded by an online mass-spectrometer.
Temperature-programmed oxidation with O2 (TPO) measurements were carried out on the same setup as NH3-TPD. 50 mg of selected spent catalysts (the PDH test are described in section 2.3 “Catalytic tests”) were loaded into the reactor and flushed at room temperature with Ar for 15 min. Hereafter, the reactor was exposed to a flow of oxygen (5 vol% O2/Ar mixture) for 80 min. Finally, the catalysts were heated to 900 °C with a ramp of 10 K min−1 in the same mixture. CO2 (atomic mass unit of 44) and Ar (atomic mass unit of 40) signals were recorded.
2.3. Catalytic tests
All catalytic tests were performed using an in-house developed set-up containing 15 fixed-bed continuous-flow reactors. Propene formation rate (eqn (1)) was determined at a propane conversion below 10% after 240 s on propane stream. Typically, the catalysts (50 mg, particle size of 315–710 μm) were heated to 550 °C in N2 flow, treated in air for 1 h and then reduced in 50 vol% H2/N2 flow at the same temperature for 1 h. Hereafter, they were flushed with N2 for 15 min and exposed to a flow of 40 vol% C3H8/N2 with a weight hourly space velocity (WHSVC3H8, with respect to propane) of 34.5 h−1.
To determine time-on-stream stability, the catalysts (300 mg, particle size is 315–710 μm) treated according to the above-described protocol were exposed to a mixture of C3H8, H2 and N2 (C3H8 : H2 : N2 = 2 : 1 : 2) at 550 °C for 3 hours. The WHSVC3H8 value was 1.57 h−1. The feed and gas-phase reaction products were analysed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890) equipped with thermal conductivity and flame ionisation detectors.
Propane conversion (X(C3H8)) and the selectivity to gas-phase products (S(i)) and coke (S(coke)) were calculated according to eqn (2)–(4) respectively. Eqn (5) was used to calculate the space–time yield of propene formation (STY, kgC3H6 kgCat−1 h−1). Turn-over frequency of propene formation with respect to Zn was calculated according to eqn (6).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Specific surface area, phase composition and morphology
The specific surface area (SBET) of as-prepared catalysts was determined by N2 physisorption and summarized in Table 1. The SBET of R-TiO2 decreases significantly from 109 to 35 m2 g−1 after calcination at 600 °C for 4 h probably due to sintering of particles. For monometallic supported catalysts, Zn loading has only a minor effect on the SBET value. The catalysts with supported ZnO and ZrO2 have on average higher SBET values than those containing ZnO only. The highest value of 63 m2 g−1 was determined for the bimetallic catalyst with the highest Zr loading. These results indicate that Zr may hinder sintering of pristine TiO2 crystallites upon high temperature calcination.

X-Ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman measurements were performed to determine the phase composition of as-prepared catalysts. The XRD patterns of R-TiO2, R-Ti-HT, 2ZnTi and 2Zn5.6ZrTi are shown in Fig. 1, while the patters of other catalysts are given in Fig. S1.† The phase composition is presented in Table 1. All catalysts are composed of the rutile phase characterized by reflections at 2θ of 27.3, 36.1, 41.2 and 54.2° (PDF 00-021-1276). In addition to this phase, the catalysts with high Zn (≥2 wt%) and/or low Zr (≤1.4 wt%) loading contain tiny amounts of the rhombohedral ZnTiO3 phase (PDF 00-26-1500) identified by reflections at 2θ of 32.8, 35.3 and 48.9°. The formation of ZnTiO3 phase could be caused by high-temperature catalyst calcination.45 No reflections characteristic for this rhombohedral phase could be found in the Zn- and Zr-containing materials with Zr loading higher than 1.4 wt%. This result suggests that Zn–Zr interactions are stronger than Zn–Ti interactions. XRD-visible ZnO and ZrO2 phases could not be identified in the XRD patterns of all catalysts because of high dispersion of these elements.
Fig. 1 XRD patterns of (a) R-TiO2, R-Ti-HT, 2ZnTi and 2Zn5.6ZrTi at 2θ of 10–80° and (b) 2ZnTi at 2θ of 30–40°. Black and light grey bars are related to rutile TiO2 (PDF 00-021-1276) and rhombohedral ZnTiO3 (PDF 00-26-1500), respectively.
To check if some X-ray amorphous phase co-exist, selected catalysts were analysed by Raman spectroscopy. The obtained spectra are shown in Fig. 2. They are characterized by bands at around 143, 233, 445 and 608 cm−1, which could be assigned to B1g, two-phonon scattering, Eg and A1g mode of the rutile phase respectively.46 No bands belonging to crystalline ZrO2 could be observed for all catalysts. A weak band located at around 344 cm−1 in the spectrum of 2ZnTi can be ascribed to the ZnTiO3 crystalline phase.47 However, this band could not be found in the spectra of 2Zn5.6ZrTi indicating that the addition of ZrO2 inhibits the formation of ZnTiO3 phase, which is consistent with our XRD results.

High-resolution electron transmission microscopy (HRTEM) was used to derive an insight into catalyst morphology. Selected HRTEM images of as-prepared R-TiO2, 2ZnTi, 2Zn1.4ZrTi and 2Zn5.6ZrTi catalysts are shown in Fig. 3. Small and irregular crystals are found in pristine R-TiO2. After calcination at 600 °C for 4 h, the crystals became larger (Fig. 3(a) and (b)) due to their sintering. A similar phenomenon is also valid for the catalysts containing up to 2 wt% Zr (Fig. 3(c)). When the loading of Zr increased to 5.6 wt%, irregular particles became spindle-like (Fig. 3(d)). The energy dispersive X-ray element mapping (Fig. S2†) proved that Zn and Zr are well dispersed in the 2Zn5.6ZrTi catalysts. No ZnO and ZrO2 aggregates could be identified that agrees with XRD results.

3.2. Local structure and chemical state of Zn species
X-ray absorption spectroscopy is one of the most powerful techniques to determine the local structure and oxidation state of Zn species.48 X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra of the 2ZnTi, 2Zn1.4ZrTi and 2Zn5.6ZrTi catalysts show the same rising edge position and the same intensity of the white line as the ZnO reference spectrum (Fig. 4(a)). This suggests the average oxidation state of Zn species of +2. At the same time, the shape of the XANES spectra is significantly different from the ZnO reference spectrum suggesting a different local structure around Zn sites.
Fig. 4 (a) Normalized XANES and (b) Fourier-transformed EXAFS spectra of ZnO, Zn foil, 2ZnTi, 2Zn1.4ZrTi and 2Zn5.6ZrTi measured at Zn K-edge.
The Zn K-edge Fourier-transformed k2-weighted EXAFS (FT EXAFS) spectra of as-prepared Zn-containing catalysts, Zn foil and ZnO powder are shown in Fig. 4(b) (see Fig. S3† for the raw k2-weighted EXAFS data). Table 2 summarises results of the EXAFS analysis (see Fig. S4† for the fits) and local geometries around Zn atoms in the ZnO and ZnTiO3 reference structures. The spectra are dominated by the first Zn–O shell containing 3 O atoms. Backscattering at a virtually constant level between 2 and 3.2 Å cannot be attributed solely to a Zn–Zn shell as in ZnO. For the 2ZnTi catalyst it can be modelled with Zn–Ti interactions similar to those in distorted (R 3 c H) ZnTiO3. Based on the coordination numbers, up to half of Zn atoms may have formed defective ZnTiO3, however, high disorder and coexistence of several Zn species preclude accurate quantitative analysis. The spectra of the Zr-doped catalysts require Zn–Ti and Zn–Zn shells from the (R −3 R) ZnTiO3 for improved fits, although the statistical significance of those shells is very low. In addition to that, the 2Zn1.4ZrTi spectrum shows a significant backscattering on a Zn shell at 3.40 Å, similar to the one in ZnO, indicate a possible formation of ZnOx clusters with 2–3 Zn atoms.

The effect of Zr presence on the electronic structure of Zn species was determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The Zn 2p XP spectra of ZnO and as-prepared catalysts are shown in Fig. 5. The BE (binding energy) values of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 in pure ZnO are 1020.8 and 1043.9 eV, respectively. Compared with ZnO, the BE values of Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2 in the 2ZnTi catalyst are shifted to higher values i.e. 1021.4 and 1044.4 eV, respectively. Contrarily, the BE values of O 1s and Ti 2p signals are shifted to lower values in comparison with the R-TiO2 support (Fig. S5(a) and (b) in ESI†). Such changes in the XP spectra mean that Zn2+ cations in the 2ZnTi catalyst are more electron deficient probably due to the transfer of electron density from Zn2+ to neighbouring O2− and Ti4+ (their BE values are shifted to lower values after adding ZnO). Thus, Zn–O–Ti structures might be formed. When Zr and Zn coexist on the surface of TiO2, a further shift in BE of Zn 2p to higher values was detected. Interesting, such value in the 2Zn5.6ZrT is close to that in 2ZnZr but is slightly higher than in 2ZnTi and 2Zn1.4ZrTi, with the two latter values being close to each other. This means that electronic interactions between Zn2+ and Zr4+ increase with an increase in loading of the latter. The BE values of O 1s and Ti 2p in all samples containing Zn, Zr or these both components are lower than in bare R-TiO2 (Fig. S5 in ESI†). Based on all the XPS data, it can be suggested that Zr–O–Zn and Zr–O–Ti structures are formed in the presence of promoter(s).

3.3. Acidic and redox property
NH3-TPD measurements were carried out to check the effect of ZnO, ZrO2 or ZnO–ZrO2 presence on overall density of acidic sites. The NH3-TPD profiles of catalysts reduced according to the protocol described in section 2.2 and their Gaussian fittings are shown in Fig. 6 and S6 in ESI† respectively. The density of acidic sites (n(NH3)) was calculated from the amount of NH3 desorbed in these tests and the SBET values of catalysts and is given in Tables 1 and S1.† One NH3 molecule was suggested to occupy one acidic site. All NH3-TPD profiles could be fitted by three Gaussian functions with the temperature of maximal NH3 desorption rate in the ranges 260–340, 340–415 and 435–525 °C. On this basis, weak, medium, and strong acidic sites can be deduced, respectively. The overall density of acidic sites increased from 0.6 to 1.36 μmol(NH3) m−2 when Zn loading was changed from 0.5 to 2 wt% and then decreased to 1.30 μmol(NH3) m−2 with a further increase in Zn loading to 4 wt%. For the ZnZrTi samples, it increased from 1.15 to 1.33 μmol(NH3) m−2 when Zn loading increased from 0.5 to 1 wt% and then decreased to 0.70 μmol(NH3) m−2 for the catalyst with 10 wt% Zn. The addition of ZrO2 has an obvious positive effect on the density of acidic sites for catalysts with Zn loading below 2 wt%. Although the density does not change further with the loading, the strength of acidic sites seems to increase (Tables 1 and S1†).

Redox properties of as-prepared catalysts were investigated by temperature-programmed reduction with CO (CO-TPR). In comparison with H2, CO also reacts with surface hydroxyl groups producing H2 through water-gas shift reaction.49 The obtained profiles of CO, CO2, and H2 are shown in Fig. 7 for R-TiO2, 2ZnTi, 2Zn1.4ZrTi and 2Zn5.6ZrTi. The corresponding data for other catalysts are given in Fig. S7.† The amount and the temperature of maximal CO consumption rate are collected in Table 1. As seen in this table, for all ZnTi catalysts, CO consumption decreased strongly with rising Zn loading. The consumption increased after addition of ZrO2. For example, the amount of CO consumed by 2Zn1.4ZrTi is 89.2 μmol g−1, while that of 2ZnTi is only 17.9 μmol g−1. CO consumption as well as CO2 and H2 formation occur practically in the same temperature range (Fig. 7 and S7†). It was previously suggested that CO mainly reacts with surface hydroxyls instead of lattice oxygen.50 Thus, the addition of ZrO2 seems to improve the reactivity of surface hydroxyls for CO consumption as concluded from the appearance of a new peak of H2 formation at around 460 °C in CO-TPR of 2Zn5.6ZrTi (Fig. 7(c)).

3.4. Catalyst performance
Propene formation rate (r(C3H6)) was determined at 550 °C over reduced catalysts at a propane conversion below 10% to ensure differential reactor operation. The obtained results for all TiO2-based catalysts are shown in Fig. 8, while those for their counterparts prepared on the basis of Al2O3, AlSiOx and SiO2 are given in Fig. S8.† It is obvious that the propene formation rate obtained over 4ZnTi is 6.3, 4.6 and 12.1 folds higher than that over 4ZnAl, 4ZnAlSi and 4ZnSi, respectively. Hence, R-TiO2 is the best support for ZnO in terms of activity of the latter in the PDH reaction. Compared with ZnO-containing catalysts, the propene formation rate over bare R-TiO2 (R-Ti-HT) and 2ZrTi is very low, i.e. 0.07 and 0.05 mmol g−1 min−1, respectively. It increases with rising Zn loading up to 6 wt% and then remains almost unchanged with a further increase in the loading (Fig. 8). For ZnO-containing catalysts, their activity is improved after introducing a certain amount of ZrO2. The rate also increases with rising Zr loading for catalysts possessing the same Zn loading.
Fig. 8 Correlation between propene formation rate and Zn or Zr loading. Test conditions: T = 550 °C, catalyst amount = 50 mg, C3H8 : N2 = 2 : 3, WHSVC3H8 = 34.5 h−1. All catalysts were reduced by 50 vol% H2/N2 at 550 °C for 1 h before exposing to propane.
Time-on-stream stability tests were performed using our selected reduced catalysts together with a commercial-like K–Cr/Al and the state-of-the-art CuYZr at the same WHSVC3H8 of 1.57 h−1. On-stream profiles of propane conversion and propene selectivity are shown in Fig. 9. For all catalysts, with exception of K–Cr/Al, the conversion increases to a different extent at the early stage of reaction probably due to the formation of additional active sites. The highest initial and maximal activity was achieved over CuYZr followed by K–Cr/Al, 2Zn5.6ZrTi, 2Zn1.4ZrTi and 2ZnTi. After the activation period, all catalysts slowly lose their activity. The deactivation should be related to the formation of carbon deposits blocking active sites for the PDH reaction.51 Although the K–Cr/Al catalyst exhibits the highest stability, 2Zn5.6ZrTi and 2Zn1.4ZrTi did not significantly differ from this catalyst in this performance. In terms of the selectivity to propene, all ZnO-containing catalysts performed similarly to the K–Cr/Al catalyst; the selectivity was about 95% during 180 min on propane stream and higher than 90–92% over the CuYZr catalyst. It is worth noting that the selectivity to gas-phase by-products (CH4, C2H4 and C2H6) is lower over our catalysts in comparison with K–Cr/Al and CuYZr (Fig. S9†).
Fig. 9 (a) Time-on-stream profiles of propane conversion and propene selectivity and (b) the amount of propene produced over 2ZnTi, 2Zn1.4ZrTi, 2Zn5.6ZrTi, K–Cr/Al and CuYZr. Test conditions: T = 550 °C, catalyst amount = 300 mg, C3H8 : H2 : N2 = 2 : 1 : 2, WHSV = 1.57 h−1. All catalysts were reduced by 50 vol% H2/N2 at 550 °C for 1 h before exposing to propane.
To benchmark the ZnO-containing catalysts, we integrated the STY(C3H6) profiles (Fig. S10†) to calculate the amount of propene produced (m(C3H6)) during 180 min on propane stream. The results are shown in Fig. 9(b). This amount for 2ZnTi is about 0.70 kg kgCat−1, and increases to 0.84 and 0.89 kg kgCat−1 for 2Zn1.4ZrTi and 2Zn5.6ZrTi, respectively. The latter values are very close to 0.91 and 0.94 kg kgCat−1 determined for K–Cr/Al and CuYZr.
3.5. Coke analysis
Coke formation is one of the most common reasons causing the deactivation of catalysts in the PDH reaction.52,53 Raman spectroscopy is an effective tool for analysing the structure of coke species.54 We also applied this technique for characterising our spent catalysts. The ex situ Raman spectra of spent catalysts are shown in Fig. S11.† Two distinct bands located at about 1603 and 1332 cm−1 were identified. They can be assigned to graphitic carbon (G band) and disordered polyaromatics (D band), respectively.55 No obvious difference between the tested catalysts with respect to these two bands could be established. The structure of coke species does not seem to depend on catalyst type.
TPO experiments were carried out to determine the amount of coke and the temperature required to completely remove such species. The obtained TPO profiles in the form of CO2/Ar and the ratio of the amount of coke to that of converted C3H8 (m(C3H6)/m(C3H8)) are shown in Fig. 10. The ratio is an indicator of mass-based selectivity to coke. It increases with rising content of ZrO2 in ZnZrTi but is lower compared with the CuYZr catalyst. The lowest value was determined for K–Cr/Al.
Fig. 10 TPO profiles of spent catalysts and the ratio of amount of coke to that of converted C3H8.
The temperature of maximal CO2 formation rate (Tmax-CO2) over ZnO-containing catalysts is higher in comparison with K–Cr/Al and CuYZr. Moreover, except for a main CO2 peak in the temperature range of 420–440 °C, a very small peak is present at 570–610 °C in the TPO profiles of ZnO-containing catalysts. These coke species may be located at different surface positions,56i.e. the active sites and the surface of supports around them. Nevertheless, most coke species could be removed under mild conditions.
3.6. The kind of actives sites and the effect of ZrO2
In section “3.4 Catalytic performance”, it is demonstrated that R-TiO2 and 2ZrTi are inactive for propane dehydrogenation indicating that Ti and Zr cations are not the active sites responsible for propane dehydrogenation. This result is in agreement with our previous study using ZrO2-based catalysts: ZrO2 with Ti dopant is inactive for propene formation.21 For ZnO-containing catalysts, both isolated ZnOx cations and small ZnOx clusters have been demonstrated to be active in the PDH reaction.27,29 ZnO species are highly dispersed in all the present catalysts even with a Zn content of 10 wt% as proven by XRD (Fig. S1 in ESI†). Two kinds of ZnO species were identified by EXAFS and XRD in ZnO–TiO2 catalysts, which are ZnOx species with 1 to 3 Zn cations and Zn cations located in the lattice of distorted rhombohedral ZnTiO3. This phase was formed when Zn loading was higher than 1 wt% (Table 1).
To compare differently loaded Zn-containing catalysts in terms of their activity, we calculated an apparent Zn-related turn-over frequency (TOF) according to eqn (6). The obtained values are shown in Fig. 11. It is obvious that the TOF value obtained over differently loaded ZnTi materials decreases with rising Zn loading. Nevertheless, highly dispersed ZnOx species should catalyse the PDH reaction as bare TiO2 and bulk ZnO are not active for this reaction. Taking the results of XRD and X-ray absorption spectroscopic tests into account, we put forward that the negative effect of Zn loading is related to the formation of the rhombohedral ZnTiO3 phase, which is detrimental for propane dehydrogenation. This suggestion can be supported by a previous study dealt with isobutane dehydrogenation.57 Those authors have concluded that cubic ZnTiO3 is the only active phase. Therefore, highly dispersed supported ZnOx clusters should be the active sites instead of those in the lattice of the rhombohedral ZnTiO3 phase.
Fig. 11 The relationship between Zn-related TOF values and Zn (and Zr) loading amount.
It should also be especially mentioned that the TOF value of xZn1.4ZrTi catalysts is higher than that of xZnTi materials when comparing the catalysts with same Zn loading (Fig. 11). In addition, the TOF value of 2ZnxZrTi increases from 0.018 to 0.033 s−1 with an increase in Zr loading from 0 to 5.6 wt%. As 2ZrTi is not active for the PDH reaction, ZrO2 should affect the intrinsic activity of ZnOx species but not be the active species. Moreover, the addition of ZrO2 to ZnTi hinders the formation of catalytically less active rhombohedral ZnTiO3 phase. The different TOF values of xZn1.4ZrTi and 2ZnxZrTi indirectly indicate that ZrO2 should be near ZnOx to influence the activity of the latter. Thus, an optimal distribution of ZrO2 and ZnOx as well as total concentration of these components on the surface of catalyst is essential for maximizing catalyst activity.
4. Conclusions
The present study has demonstrated that low-cost and environmentally friendly catalysts based on R-TiO2 as support for ZnOx are active and selective catalysts for the non-oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propene. They perform similarly to a commercial-like K–CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst in terms of propene selectivity, productivity and on-stream stability and outperform the-state-of-the-art Cu/YZrOx-based catalyst.
Two kinds of Zn cations located in Zn1−3Ox clusters or in the lattice of rhombohedral ZnTiO3 were identified by X-ray absorption fine structure analysis and X-ray diffraction. The small clusters are suggested to be the active sites responsible for propene formation. The rhombohedral ZnTiO3 phase is detrimental to PDH activity. The addition of ZrO2 inhibits both the formation of such phase and sintering of R-TiO2 supports. The activity of ZnOx/R-TiO2 also increases in the presence of ZrO2 although the latter is not active for the desired reaction. The positive role of ZrO2 promoter is to inhibit the formation of the undesired ZnTiO3 phase and to enhance the intrinsic activity of ZnOx sites owing to stronger Zn–Zr interactions in comparison with Zn–Ti interactions. Such knowledge opens a possibility for searching for other promoters for ZnOx/TiO2 catalysts to further improve their activity and selectivity approaching those typical for expensive Pt-based catalysts.
