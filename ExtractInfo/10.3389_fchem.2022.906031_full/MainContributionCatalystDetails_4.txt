The document does not appear to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). It discusses the use of a silver-functionalized indium oxide catalyst for electrochemical glucose sensing, which is not directly related to the conversion of propane to propylene. No information is provided in the context of PDH or ODH.
