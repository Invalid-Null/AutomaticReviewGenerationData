Construction of Hetero[n]rotaxanes by Use of Polyfunctional Rotaxane Frameworks
Abstract
Heterorotaxanes, one class of topological organic structures, have attracted increasing interesting during the past two decades. In general, two types of heterorotaxane structures exist, one in which two or more different macrocycles are threaded onto one dumbbell-shaped molecule and the other where one macrocycle is threaded onto two or more different dumbbell-shaped molecules. In comparison to these traditional types, another family of topologically interesting heterorotaxanes can be envisaged as arising from polyfunctional molecules that possess both host (crown ether) and guest (ammonium templates). In the present investigation, we have explored the construction of selected members of this new heterorotaxane family, which possess crown ether moieties that are wrapped around a dumbbell-shaped molecule. These structures are prepared by routes in which “stitching” processes, involving template-directed clipping reaction or olefin metathesis reactions, are used to install crown ether ring systems encircling ammonium cation centers. This is then followed by implementation of a threading-followed-by-stoppering sequence to install a second encircling crown ether ring. The results show that the polyfunctional building blocks assemble with high efficiencies. Finally, this investigation provides a foundation for future studies aimed at constructing more complicated heterorotaxane architectures, such as switchable systems, self-assembling polymers, and functional molecular machines.

Introduction

Construction of novel topological structures has been one of the major goals of research efforts in the areas of supramolecular chemistry and self-assembly. Much attention has been given to the design and synthesis of molecular representations of mathematical topologies and to the structural analysis of these topologically interesting chemical motifs. (1) As one type of classic topological structures, mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), such as rotaxanes, catenanes, knots, and links, have unique structural features that enable their application in various fields, including molecular devices, (2) molecular switches and machines, (3) nanotechnology, (4) biological technology, (5) drug delivery, (4a, 5b) and polymer materials. (6) As a consequence, the creation of MIMs that have novel configurations is an important aim of supramolecular self-assembly and systems chemistry.
In recent years, the focus of studies of rotaxanes has shifted from single and simple structures to those that possess functionalized and complicated structures. (7) Recently, heterorotaxanes have attracted increasing interest owing to the fact that interactions between the cyclic and linear components of these systems can lead to different chemical structures with interesting functionalities. (8) Based on a consideration of binding affinities between different host and guest components, a self-sorting strategy was developed for the efficient construction of heterorotaxanes, which have topological configurations that are similar to those of dumbbell-shaped molecules wrapped by different types of macrocyclic hosts. (9) For example, in 1996 Stoddart and co-workers (10) took advantage of the different binding affinities of dibenzo[24]crown-8 and bis(p-phenylene-34-crown-10) toward secondary dialkylammonium and bipyridinium ions to synthesize a novel hetero[3]pseudorotaxane. Schalley and co-workers (11, 12) used the different binding behaviors of [24]crown-8 and [21]-crown-7 toward dialkylammonium ions to construct hetero[3]rotaxanes. Chiu and co-workers (13) also described the use of another self-sorting method to construct a hetero[3]rotaxane. Recently, a new twin-axial hetero[7]rotaxane derived from benzo-21-crown-7 and bis(p-phenylene-34-crown-10) was prepared by Liu and co-workers. (14) In addition to crown ethers, other macrocyclic hosts such as cucurbiturils, (15) cyclodextrins, (16) and others (17, 18) have been utilized to construct heterorotaxanes. For example, in 2010 Wu and co-workers (19) and our group independently reported a hetero[4]rotaxane that is generated from a crown ether and cucurbituril by employing a threading-followed-by-clipping approach.
Another family of heterorotaxanes contain members that are composed of macrocycles in which different dumbbell-shaped molecules are threaded. In 2006, Anderson and co-workers (20) described a hetero[3]rotaxane containing one stilbene and one cyanine dye moiety threaded through the center of a γ-cyclodextrin molecule. Schalley and co-workers (21) also constructed a series of heterorotaxanes by employing self-assembly of hosts containing 21-crown-7 and 24-crown-8 units onto different ammonium templates.
In the effort described below, we have designed, synthesized, and investigated several new hetero[n]rotaxanes (n = 3, 4) and hetero[5]pseudorotaxane that have unique topological structures that are different from those of the two traditional types described above. The new types of dual-functional molecules are composed of crown ether and ammonium building blocks that play the roles of respective hosts and guests. The crown ether groups in these dual-functional molecules are designed to have the ability to wrap dumbbell-shaped molecules while the ammonium components play the roles of guest templates that thread the crown ethers. The dual-functional molecules highly efficiently assemble to form novel topological hetero[n]rotaxanes.

Design of New Heterorotaxanes
The general strategy we have developed for the preparation of novel hetero[n]rotaxane is depicted pictorially in Scheme 1. In general, the heterorotaxanes are composed of two simple rotaxanes A and B, which are formed from polyfunctional host–guest building blocks. It should be noted that previous efforts have shown that dual-functional molecules of this type undergo intermolecular self-assembly to form daisy-shaped molecules and polymers. (22) Consequently, in our approach a stopper is introduced in order to avoid daisy-shaped polymer formation. The building block C contains a stopper group along with both a crown ether and an ammonium cation group. In this approach, hetero[n]rotaxane construction take place through a two-step self-assembly strategy in which the ammonium unit serves as a template for incorporating an encircling macrocyclic ring by using either template-directed clipping reaction or olefin metathesis reaction. (23) These processes afford intermediate D, which is then subjected to a threading-followed-by-stoppering sequence to install a second encircling crown ether ring as part of the new heterorotaxane.
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Schematic Representation of the Route for Heterorotaxane Formation
Synthesis of Building Blocks
One group of substances needed to aid spectroscopic analysis of the processes involved in heterorotaxane formation following the strategy described above, include the aza crown and normal crown ethers 4 and 9 (Scheme 2). The synthesis of 4 is accomplished by use of dibenzylammonium ion 3 as a template and aldimine-forming condensation reaction of the 4-alkoxyl-substituted 2,6-pyridinedicarboxaldehyde 1 with tetra(ethylene glycol) bis(2-aminophenyl)ether 2 followed by BH3·THF-promoted reduction. The preparation of crown ether 9 is carried out via olefin metathesis reaction (41%) of the bis-olefin-containing pseudo-crown ether 8, which is generated by substitution reaction between naphthalenediol 5 and monotosylate 6 (24) followed by O-allylation reaction of the resulting diol 7.
Scheme 2
Scheme 2. Synthesis of Macrocycles 4 and 9
The substance selected to aid spectroscopic analysis of the stopper region in the heterorotaxane forming process is the dumbbell-shaped ammonium ester 16 (Scheme 3). The route employed to prepare 16 begins with a reductive amination reaction between 3,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (12) and 5-aminopentan-1-ol (13), which generates amine 14 (83%). Protonation of the amine group in 14 with excess trifluoroacetic acid followed by counterion exchange with saturated aqueous NH4PF6 affords the corresponding ammonium salt 15. Finally, treatment of 15 with 3,5-dimethoxybenzoic anhydride (11), produced from the corresponding acid 10, and catalytic tributylphosphane leads to formation of the dumbbell-shaped ammonium salt 16 in a yield of 55%. The final products and intermediates in the synthetic pathways shown in Schemes 2 and 3 as well in all of the schemes that follow were fully characterized by standard spectroscopic techniques (see Supporting Information).
Scheme 3
Scheme 3. Synthesis of Dumbbell-Shaped Ammonium 16
With model compounds 4, 9, and 16 in hand, we set out to synthesize the dual-functional structural components of the heterorotaxanes. One key substance 24, containing a crown ether and an ammonium structural unit, was synthesized utilizing the route shown in Scheme 4. Treatment of 3,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde 20 with the pseudo-crown ether 19, (25) formed by a route starting with bisphenol 17 and monotosylate 6, in the presence of Cs2CO3 produces the aldehyde-substituted crown ether 21 in 46% yield. Reductive amination of 21 with 3,5-dimethoxybenzylamine (22) gives the precursor of the Boc-protected amino crown ether 23, produced for the purpose of convenient purification. Boc deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in dry dichloromethane followed by counterion exchange with saturated aqueous NH4PF6 gives the target ammonium tethered bis(m-phenylene)-26-crown-8 24.
Scheme 4
Scheme 4. Synthesis of Dual-Functional Crown Ether 24
A similar synthetic strategy was employed to prepare the dual-functional crown ether 30, which contains two ammonium groups and one crown ether host unit (Scheme 5). The sequence was initiated by treatment of 3,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (25) with the bistosylate 27, generated from 25. This process produces crown ether 28 (54%), which then undergoes reductive amination with 3,5-dimethoxybenzylamine 22 followed by N-protection by use of Boc2O to form the bis-substituted crown ether 29 (69% over three steps). Subsequent deprotection and counterion exchange affords the bisammonium tethered crown ether 30. A single crystal of 30 suitable for crystallographic analysis was obtained by diffusion of isopropyl ether into an acetonitrile solution at room temperature (Figure S1, Supporting Information). X-ray crystallographic analysis of 30 shows that it exists in a highly ordered packed structure in the solid state (Table S1, Supporting Information).
Scheme 5
Scheme 5. Synthesis of Dual-Functional Crown Ether 30
The triangular-shaped trisammonium tethered crown ether 34 was prepared employing the pathway outlined in Scheme 6. The route begins with Cs+ template-controlled reaction of 3,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde 25 with bistosylate 31, which forms the key trisaldehyde intermediate 32 (43%). Reductive amination of 32 with amine 22 followed by Boc protection (for the purpose of purification), deprotection, and ion exchange then gives 34.
Scheme 6
Scheme 6. Synthesis of Dual-Functional Crown Ether 34
Hetero[n]rotaxane Assembly
A reductive amination-based stitching process was employed to affix a macrocyclic ring on the side-chain ammonium residue in the dual-functional substrate 24. This process was accomplished by mixing 24 with dialdehyde 1 and bisaniline derivative 2 in CD3CN (pictorially represented in Scheme 7). The observation of a broad singlet at 9.76 ppm for ammonium NH2+ protons as well as a singlet at 8.24 ppm for imine (CH=N) protons in 1H NMR spectra of the crude reaction mixture shows that macrocyclic bisimine formation has taken place in a reversible manner (Figure S2, Supporting Information). Reduction of the imine moieties in this substance with BH3·THF followed by chromatographic purification then generates the kinetically stable [2]rotaxane-1 (78%).
Scheme 7
Scheme 7. Synthesis of Hetero[3]rotaxane-1 and Hetero[3]rotaxane-2
The resonance for ammonium protons in the 1H NMR spectrum of [2]rotaxane-1 is upfield-shifted (singlet at 8.31 ppm) compared to those of its bisimine-containing precursor. In addition, resonance of protons on the stopper units (H2 and H3, H6 and H7) of [2]rotaxane-1 (Figure 1C; see Scheme 4 for proton numbering) also display upfield shifts in comparison to those in the dual-functional molecule 24 (Figure 1B) as a result of shielding effects associated with the encircling crown ether macrocyclic ring. In contrast, the resonances for the methylene protons (H4 and H5) adjacent to the ammonium nitrogen are downfield-shifted. In addition, the proton (Hb) on the heterocrown ether ring in [2]rotaxane-1 is downfield-shifted relative to the related proton in the model compound 4 (Figure 1A). The observed shifts in proton resonances, which are in good agreement with those noted in previous studies, (19, 26) suggest that the newly installed crown ether ring system in [2]rotaxane-1 encircles the ammonium moiety of the dual-functional molecule. Additional evidence supporting this conclusion comes from analysis of the electrospray ionization mass spectrum (ESI-MS), which contains a peak at m/z 1320.3 that corresponds to the -PF6– salt of [2]rotaxane-1 (see Supporting Information).

In order to construct the topologically novel hetero[3]rotaxane-1, [2]rotaxane-1 was treated with the ammonium salt 15 and the resulting threaded complex was subjected to a tributylphosphine-catalyzed end-capping reaction with 3,5-dimethylbenzoic anhydride (11). Evidence for the formation of hetero[3]rotaxane-1 in this process comes from analysis of its 1H NMR spectrum. As shown in Figure 1D, an obvious downfield shift of the resonance for ammonium protons and upfield shifts for benzene ring protons (HB and HC) in the comparative spectra of [2]rotaxane-1 and hetero[3]rotaxane-1 show that the crown ether unit in the former substance is threaded by the ammonium template (modeled by 16) (Figure 1E). The results of a two-dimensional rotating Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) experiment enabled the identification of changes occurring in resonances associated with dual-functional and hetero crown ether and dumbbell-shaped components upon formation of hetero[3]rotaxane-1. For example, the benzene ring prtotons of the dual-functional molecular component are strongly shielded by the hetero crown ether component in hetero[3]rotaxane-1. In addition, obvious correlations exist between the benzene ring (H3 and H6) and methylene (Hb) protons and between protons in the dumbbell-shaped and dual-functional molecular components of hetero[3]rotaxane-1 (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Finally, inspection of the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrum (Figure 2A) shows the presence of a peak at m/z 1736.84 that is assigned to [M – PF6– – HPF6]+ of hetero[3]rotaxane-1 (Figure 2A).

Another method used to generate a heterorotaxane from 24 involves the use of an olefin metathesis process. In this approach, the complex formed by treatment of 24 with the bisolefin-containing crown ether 8 was reacted in the presence of Grubbs’ catalyst to form [2]rotaxane-2 (67%) (Scheme 7). Subsequent threading of [2]rotaxane-2 by the ammonium ion 15 followed by end-capping reaction with 3,5-dimethylbenzoic anhydride (11) produced hetero[3]rotaxane-2 in 51% yield. In the 1H NMR spectrum, protons in the two side methylene groups (H4 and H5) adjacent to the ammonium residue in [2]rotaxane-2 display similar downfield shifts as seen in the spectrum of [2]rotaxane-1, while the corresponding benzene ring protons (H2, H3 and H6, H7) display similar upfield shifts owing to the shielding effect of the encircling naphthalene-based crown ether ring system (Figure 3B,C). In the 1H NMR spectrum of hetero[3]rotaxane-2, the resonances associated with ammonium protons on the dumbbell component are shifted downfield relative to those in the model compound 16, suggesting that that this moiety is encircled by a crown ether group of the dual-functional component. In addition, resonances of protons HB and HC also display upfield shifts in a manner that is similar to the corresponding protons in the spectrum of hetero[3]rotaxane-1 (Figure 3D,E).

The results of ESI MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis support the assigned structures of [2]rotaxane-2 and hetero[3]rotaxane-1. Specifically, the peak at m/z 1105.1 in the spectrum of [2]rotaxane-2 is assigned to the [M – PF6–]+ species, while the spectrum of hetero[3]rotaxane-2 contains a peak at m/z 1521.72 for the [M – PF6– – HPF6]+ species (Figure 2B and Supporting Information). Finally, the two-dimensional ROESY spectrum of hetero[3]rotaxane-2 contains significant cross peaks associated with the existence of interactions between the host and guest components (Figure S4, Supporting Information).
An investigation was conducted to determine if hetero[4]rotaxanes can be generated by use of appropriate polyfunctional substrates. The crown ether 30 was selected for this purpose because, in addition to a host component, it contains two ammonium units that can serve as templates for stitching processes that introduce crown ether rings. Template-directed clipping reaction of 30 and 2 equiv of dialdehyde 1 and diamine 2 in CH3CN was employed to generate a bisimine, which upon treatment with BH3·THF produced [3]rotaxane-3 in a high yield (Scheme 8). In addition, the analogous [3]rotaxane-4 was prepared from 30 by olefin metathesis reaction of diene 8. Both [3]rotaxanes were then subjected to threading with 15 and end-capping reactions with anhydride 15. The overall sequences afforded hetero[4]rotaxane-3 and hetero[4]rotaxane-4 in high yields.
Scheme 8
Scheme 8. Synthesis of Hetero[4]rotaxane-3 and Hetero[4]rotaxane-4
The steps in these assembly sequences were followed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. As can be seen by inspection of Figure 4 and Figure S5 (Supporting Information), the resonance of protons (H2′, H3′ and H6′, H7′) on the benzene rings of 30 are downfield-shifted in [3]rotaxane-3 and [3]rotaxane-4, while two side methylenes (H4′ and H5′) adjacent to the ammonium nitrogens are also downfield-shifted. The results clearly show that the template-directed clipping reaction leads to incorporation of crown ether components wrapped around the ammonium ion centers. In contrast to those of the dumbbell-shaped molecule 16, the ammonium protons of hetero[4]rotaxane-3 and hetero[4]rotaxane-4 are also downfield-shifted, while the resonances of benzene ring protons are upfield-shifted relative to those in 16. Morover, the 2D ROESY spectra of both hetero[4]rotaxanes display some important correlations expected for their assigned structures (Figures S6 and S7, Supporting Information). Finally, the mass spectra of both substances contain peaks at expected m/z ratios (as shown in Supporting Information and Figure 2C,D).

The final phase of this effort focused on the star-shaped dual-functional crown ether 34, bearing three ammonium units linked to a central crown ether core (Scheme 9). Treatment of 34 with 3 equiv of dialdehyde 1 and diamine 2 in CH3CN led to formation of [4]rotaxane-5 in 62% yield. The structure of this substance was assigned by using 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (Figure 5A and Supporting Information). In addition, further studies revealed that [4]rotaxane-5 reacts to form hetero[5]pseudorotaxane when treated with the rod-type, phenanthroline-based ammonium ion 35. As can be seen by viewing the 1H NMR spectra contained in Figure 5B,D, obvious shifts in key resonance of protons take place in this process. For instance, the aromatic protons (HB′, HC′, HD′, HE′) display obvious upfield shifts, and protons in the nitrogen-bonded methylene groups display downfield shifts upon the addition of 1 equiv of ammonium 35 to [4]rotaxane-5. These changes are in agreement with those made in previous studies. (27) Addition of 5 equiv of 35 to [4]rotaxane-5 led to formation of more hetero[5]pseudorotaxane. On the basis of an analysis of the 35 concentration dependence of this process, an association constants for the equilibrium reaction of [4]rotaxane-5 with 35 to form hetero[5]pseudorotaxane is estimated to be 2.42 × 102 M–1.

Conclusion
Jump To
In the study describe above, three polyfunctional building blocks possessing crown ether host and ammonium guest components were synthesized and used to construct new types of topologically novel hetero[n]rotaxanes. In the routes for preparation of the target hetero[n]rotaxanes, the guest ammonium units serve as templates to direct construction of encircling crown ether ring systems by use of template-directed clipping reaction or olefin metathesis reactions as key stitching processes. In these processes, the host crown ether units guide introduction of dumbbell-shaped molecules by use of a threading-followed-by stoppering strategy. The results of this effort demonstrate the feasibility of the self-assembly strategy relying on the use of polyfunctional substrates. In addition, by using this approach a number of topologically unique heterorotaxane structures have been prepared. Finally, this investigation provides a foundation for future studies aimed at constructing more complicated heterorotaxane architectures, such as switchable systems, self-assembling polymers, and functional molecular machines.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
