CO2-assisted propane dehydrogenation over of zirconia-titania catalysts: Effect of the carbon dioxide to propane ratios on olefin yields
The propane dehydrogenation assisted by CO2 was investigated by using zirconia and titania catalysts. The objective of the research was to assist the olefins yield of propylene and ethylene from the dehydrogenation of propane gas. The catalysts were characterized using XRD, SEM, and TPD/TPR. The molar ratios of CO2 of 1.4, 2.6, and 12.2 to propane were used; and the conversion of propane was reduced, while increase of CO2 ratio to propane whereas the propylene selectivity increased. The increase of CO/H2 ratio of reverse water-gas shift reaction was an important for the olefins yield and catalytic stability for 29–203 h without regeneration. The utilization of CO2 showed an increase the propane dehydrogenation to produce propylene to ethylene ratio of 2.8 and a total olefin yield 40–45% over Zr-Ti oxide catalysts was achieved. The study demonstrated the important role of CO2 presence in the propane dehydrogenation.
1. Introduction
1.1. Utilization of CO2
Recently, carbon dioxide has been of the major global concern regarding environment because of the discharged surpasses 10 gigatons per annual to the atmospheric air [1]. The utilization of CO2 to chemical synthesis is one of the approaches used for CO2 capture [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The propane dehydrogenation reaction attracts a lot of attention due to the propylene (propene) demand. The propane dehydrogenation assisted by CO2 has been investigated [7], [8], [9]. The presence of CO2 can act as soft oxidant. Rather than using an oxygen molecule, a low heat reaction during the oxidation reaction can be assisted by CO2, avoid the hot spot during reaction as compared to the oxidation reaction assisted by oxygen [7], [8]. The study of the propane dehydrogenation assisted by carbon dioxide may classify into two types of reactions. The oxidative catalytic propane dehydrogenation assisted by carbon dioxide and the non-oxidative catalytic propane dehydrogenation assisted by carbon dioxide.
1.2. Oxidative catalytic for propane dehydrogenation assisted by CO2
The oxidative propane dehydrogenation has been studied extensively. Several catalysts based of chromium oxide, magnesium oxide, chromium oxide, cerium oxide and iron oxide doped on silica, activated carbon, MCM-41 (Si/Al ratio of 50) and alumina were used for propane dehydrogenation reaction [7], [8], [9]. The reaction with CO2 ratio was used at temperature of 550 °C and substantial amount of propylene yields but they noticed, fast deactivation and formation of coke over catalysts were made and that tends to block the catalyst activity [10], [11], [12]. The chromium oxide is one of the most catalyst used. The oxidation state of Cr(V, VI) is reduced during propane dehydrogenation and turns to oxidation state of Cr(III and IV). The CO2 role in the reaction is to prompt the oxidation state of chromium to higher level for further propane dehydrogenation reaction [13]. Several studies showed the oxidative dehydrogenation at high CO2 ratio to propane of 3:1 will improve the propylene selectivity [13].
However, several papers reported the partial dry reforming of propane at present CO2 at the same reaction of 550 °C [14], the result of propane dry reforming, a primary cracking the C-C bond of propane tends to produce lighter gas of methane, ethane and ethene (ethylene) were not highlighted. The catalytic oxidative propane dehydrogenation via carbon dioxide would proceed first by contribution of an oxygen atom from the metal oxide to react with hydrogen atoms of propane in order to formulate propylene and H2O [15]. CO2 is highlighted to assist catalytic reactivity of the reduced metal oxide via redox route by donating oxygen atom from CO2 molecule and then it releases CO [15].
1.3. CO2 assisted propane dehydrogenation
More recently, the catalytic non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation assisted by CO2 was lately described, the reaction is endothermic reaction and undergoes via two steps in order to perform the complete cycle of dehydrogenation and maintain the reactivity of catalytic surface. First, the propane couples over the catalytic oxide surface and then propane dehydrogenates from catalyst (Eq. (1)). At that moment followed by RWGS reaction of CO2 to remove H2 adsorbed over the catalytic surface and it has lower enthalpy energy (ΔHᵒ = 43.2 kJ mol−1) (Eq. (2)). The overall endothermic reaction equation of non-oxidative pathway is shown in Eq. (3) [15]. The reverse water-gas shift (RWGS) reaction by CO2 is important to the catalytic surface to make the sites of catalyst obtainable for more reaction of propane dehydrogenation [7], [16].

The route of dehydrogenation by CO2:

C3H8 + CO2 → C3H6 + CO + H2O (ΔHᵒ = 127 kJ mol−1)
The several other catalysts such as Ni-Mo oxide, In-Al oxide and ZnO/ZSM-5 showed propylene dehydrogenation at presence of CO2 [7], [8], [9], [13], [16], [17] Interestingly, the In-Al oxide and ZnO/ZSM-5 catalysts showed yield ca. 25% for 12 h [17] longer catalytic stream stability than oxidative propane dehydrogenation catalyst. The molar ratio CO2 to propane was important and it achieved higher propylene selectivity of 75% via In-Al oxide catalyst [17].
The mechanism of the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation over catalyst of ZnO/ZSM-5 [18] was proposed. The propane coupling formed, and CO2 presence was increased the stability of the catalyst surface to assist the RWGS reaction in order to remove of H2 adsorbed over catalyst surface. On the other hand, other catalysts for dehydrogenation of propane by using CO2 via the gallium oxide added on support of TiO2, Al2O3, ZrO2, SiO2, and MgO [19]. The dehydrogenation of propane was suggested via a heterolytic of dissociation reaction [19] pathway of propane.
The catalysts applied for propane dehydrogenation assisted by CO2 showed better catalytic stability which provided longer stream reaction than oxidative route of propane dehydrogenation. The nonoxidative catalytic of dehydrogenation of propane by carbon dioxide is still not well recognized and the role of CO2 to prompt the catalyst selectivity towards propylene. In addition, the important to address dry reforming reaction of propane at presence of CO2 which possibly occurs and may cause undesired breaking via catalyst such as carbon-carbon bond breaking of propane to produce more light gas of ethane, methane and hydrogen which was not addressed by previous workers.
In fact, propane dehydrogenation and dissociation to propylene on the catalyst surface is not fully understood and the thermodynamics of reaction over catalyst is complex [15]. The propane dehydrogenation produces surplus of hydrogen molecule over catalyst, and extra of hydrogen molecules may cause possibly shifting the enthalpy energy of the reaction from endothermic of propane dehydrogenation (ΔHᵒ = 124.4 kJ mol−1) to exothermic reaction with enthalpy energy (ΔHᵒ) of − 53.9 kJ mol−1 as result of propane cracking to ethane and methane at surplus of hydrogen as shown in Eq. (4) [15]. By changing the enthalpy energy could assist further C-C bond breaking of propane to generate more ethylene and methane (Eq. (5)). In addition, the surplus of hydrogen molecule from propane dehydrogenation over catalyst may assist further hydrogenation reaction of ethylene to ethane (Eq. (6)) or ethylene cracking to methane (Eq. (7)) which both are made an exothermic reaction over catalyst [15].

The heterogeneous catalyst based on ZrO2-TiO2 was investigated. The importance of ZrO2 and TiO2 catalysts is the composition of mixture oxide formation between two catalyst [20] was highlighted to have improve catalytic reaction reactivity and assist CO2 reactions over the catalytic surface acidic and basic created by mixing Zr–O–Ti framework distinguished than to the primary catalyst of TiO2 or ZrO2 [20]. FTIR and NH3-TPD studies are used to distinguish the distinctive of dual functions of binary oxide catalyst based on ZrO2-TiO2 [21]. The CO2 adsorption on ZrO2-TiO2 measured an independent of basic catalytic sites. The catalytic acidity of these ZrO2-TiO2 were also measured by NH3-TPD, it made 10 time than single oxide of TiO2 or ZrO2. The FTIR of pyridine adsorption was determined the existence of acidic sites Brønsted and Lewis made by binary oxide catalyst [22].
In other related work, ZrO2-TiO2 was used as support catalyst [23], the ethylbenzene dehydrogenation to styrene at 660 °C over CeO2, V2O5, CeO2–V2O5 supported on TiO2–ZrO2 and 3% K2O/TiO2-ZrO2 were also studied [23]. The TiO2–ZrO2 support as catalyst was reactivity without addition of third metal and time-on-stream steadiness was made for 10 h [23], where it was found that CO2 promotes that catalytic stability. It was suggested that the key dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene mechanism (Eq. (4)) has been achieved via the catalytic surface and direct reaction of CO2 with hydrogen over the catalyst via RWGS reaction [23]:
Carbon dioxide has been applied for p-ethyl toluene dehydrogenation to p-methyl styrene by using TiO2–ZrO2 support with loaded K2O [24]. The catalyst reaction selectivity made by 85% to p-methyl styrene, however, the carbon dioxide conversion was only 11%. Other work by Xu et al. [19] reported carbon dioxide utilization reaction for dehydrogenation of propane gas by utilized ZrO2 or TiO2 as support with gallium oxide. However, the dehydrogenation of propane by using CO2 produced only 22% of propylene yield with low persistence of the reaction. The oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) by using CO2 has been investigated for of n-butane at 600 °C by using the catalyst mixture of VO supported on CeO2–ZrO2 and TiO2–ZrO2 and CeO2–ZrO2 [26]. It was proposed that the carbon dioxide involvement was as a soft oxidant in the conversion of butane and CO2 was converted to CO molecule and oxygen atom that was important for oxidation-reduction via catalytic material [25].
The discussion above emphasized that ZrO2, TiO2 and specifically a binary oxide of ZrO2-TiO2, has possibly shown catalytic reactivity in a several dehydrogenation reactions in the presence of CO2. Several indicators such as high catalytic acidity, basicity and dual functional property may be anticipated to assist to higher reactivity in these type conversions. Nevertheless, this catalytic binary oxide was not entirely investigated for propylene by utilizing carbon dioxide. The study, binary oxide of ZrO2-TiO2 mixture had be investigated for propane dehydrogenation assisted by different ratio of CO2 to propane in order to recognize the role of CO2 and how to be utilized.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and preparation of Zr-Ti oxide
The chemicals of zirconium (IV) oxynitrate hydrate, titanium (IV) oxide, nitric acid and zirconium oxide were obtained from the Fisher Scientific.
The wet impregnation catalysts preparation was used to prepare binary oxide of 5% Zr/Ti oxide, weight of 1 g ZrO(NO3)2.6H2O diluted in low concentration of HNO3 in D.I. water (0.2 N, 100 ml). Then a weight of 10 g TiO2 in solid was introduced and mixed for 18 h period at room temperature. In order to separate water from catalyst solid, the centrifuge was used, followed by distilled water washing for three times was made before applied the drying stage of catalyst at 110 °C for 17 h. The catalyst calcining stage was applied by using oven under air at 710 °C to obtain 5% Zr-Ti binary oxide. The zirconia and titania separately were washed by D.I water and dried ~110 °C before calcination step at 710 °C.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The binary oxide structure morphology was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and applied the Panalytical X′Pert PRO Diffractometer instrument. The analysis was measured started from 4° to 80° degrees 2θ and step wise of 0.04° for Zr-Ti oxide catalyst and TiO2 and ZrO2. Raman analysis was conducted by using Horiba Raman spectrometer (iHR320). The spectrum window of 90–1000 cm−1 and green laser source at 532 nm were applied to determine catalyst composition of pure ZrO2, pure TiO2 and 5% ZrO2/TiO2 catalysts were calcined at 710 °C.
The copper-anode tube radiation was used at wavelength of 1.5418 Å. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) were also employed for surface morphology of 5% Zr/Ti oxide and measure element content by using FEI Quanta 400 instrument. The catalysts texture property and N2 adsorption/desorption were analyzed using BET analyzer (Micromeritics, ASAP 2420). Raman.
The ammonia temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) test was determined by applying HIDEN CATLAB apparatus. Prior the TPD measurements, sample of 100 mg was precondition at 650 °C for 60 min at helium carrier and cooled down to 50 °C before purged by 1% NH3 in He for 30 min. The catalysts purged again at heated 100 °C at flow of He to take out the physiosorbed of ammonia for 60 min before TPD analysis. The hydrogen temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was applied by using Micromeritics Autochem 2910 instrument. The test, 100 mg of sample weight was loaded. Before to the TPR analysis, the sample of catalyst was heated initially in He, at 300 °C for one hour. Next pre-heating, the catalyst was cooled to 35 °C and 10% H2 mixed with Ar was made to pass through the catalyst and the temperature was raised from 100 °C to 900 °C at rate of 10 °C/min. A thermal conductivity detector (TCD) applied to determine the hydrogen concentration uptake in the effluent stream.
2.3. Catalyst activity test
The propane dehydrogenation catalytic reaction activity was tested by using a stainless-steel packed reactor. The reactor length was 7.0 cm with external diameter of 0.63 cm and a horizontal furnace was applied. The catalyst loaded of 0.3 g and supported by quartz wool. The mass flow meter controller was used for gas mixture at the inlet feed flow. The outlet gas product from reactor was directly connected to a gas loop for gas measurement by using gas chromatography of thermal conductivity detector (GC-TCD) connected with Haysep Q and Porapak Q columns. The propane and carbon dioxide conversions were calculated as shown in the (8), (9) [26]. The selectivity and yield calculated according the (10), (11).

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Phase identity and morphology of the catalysts
The images of SEM of the primary oxide, TiO2, ZrO2 and binary oxide of 5% Zr/Ti are exhibited in Fig. 1[A]–[C], all samples were shown shapes of semi-round and the particle sizes were nano particles less than 200 nm of diameters. In addition, EDX analysis is semi-quantitative used for metal analysis, which was conducted in order to measure the metal percentage as shown in Table 1. The metal content of catalyst was matched to the estimated values from the catalyst formulation and it showed the ZrO2 was doped on the support of TiO2 support.

X-ray diffraction patterns are presented in Fig. 2 for primary oxide of ZrO2 and TiO2, binary oxide of Zr/Ti made by impregnation method. The XRD pattern of single oxide ZrO2 calcined at 700 °C showed sharp peaks consisted of monoclinic and tetragonal crystalline. It looks that the monoclinic crystalline is higher diffraction peaks than tetragonal phase. The calcined single oxide of titania revealed mainly anatase crystalline as shown in Fig. 2. The 5% Zr/Ti oxide was characterized and the diffraction pattern was shown almost entirely the phase of anatase of titania and no zirconia detected by X-ray diffraction and no peaks of tetragonal or monoclinic phases which similar to the observation noted by Neppolian et al. [27] and Pérez-Hernández et al. [20]. The loading low weight of ZrO2 dopant on TiO2 showed disappearance of ZrO2 phase and indicated no sign of a distinct zirconia phase in the TiO2 support.

For better understanding, the crystallinity of anatase of 1 0 1 and 2 0 0 of catalysts were studied. Two samples selected were pure TiO2 and 5% Zr/Ti oxide catalyst. Fig. 3 [A] and [B] show the crystallite size of pure TiO2 in blue color and 5% Zr/Ti oxide in red color. By addition of 5% ZrO2 to TiO2 support the reduction XRD crystallite peak of anatase 1 0 1 and 2 0 0 of TiO2 were observed and suggested the second metal of 5% ZrO2 was incorporating over TiO2 support similar to the observation noted by Liu et al. [28].

Similar to XRD, the Raman analysis was used to determine crystalline phase of pure ZrO2 and TiO2 calcined at 710 °C in order to describe the mixture of 5% Zr/Ti oxide catalyst. The pure TiO2 showed mainly anatase phase (Fig. S1); furthermore, the pure ZrO2 showed composite of monoclinic and tetragonal crystalline similar observation reported by Kambur et al. [29] and Pezzotti et al. [30]. The catalyst of 5% Zr/Ti oxide showed main anatase phase and no appearance of tetragonal or monoclinic phases of ZrO2 due to the high intensity of anatase peaks appearance from TiO2 support and that would overlap with any crystalline peaks of ZrO2 [29].
3.2. Textural properties of Zr/Ti oxide catalysts
Table 1 tabulates the result of N2 adsorption/desorption of the single and binary oxides catalyst. The BET data for binary oxide of Zr/Ti is comparable with that studied by Rao et al. [23] for similar catalysts. Low pore volumes, as anticipated, fairly low due to the low surface area. Average pore diameters are tabulated in Table 1, but they showed low pore volumes. The BJH method used to measure pore size distributions of catalysts are demonstrated in Fig. 4. The pore distribution of 5% Zr oxide doped on the TiO2 increases the pore volume of the binary oxide catalyst and change the pore distribution of the original TiO2 support. It increases the binary oxide mesoporous shape between 5 and 20 cm3 g−1 by incorporating of ZrO2.

3.3. Acidic properties of zirconia-titania catalysts
Table 1 showed the ammonia desorption catalysts used in the study. The NH3-TPD used to determine the acidity profile of catalysts are shown Fig. 5 and little ammonia desorption was determined via the primary oxides of ZrO2 and TiO2. Alternatively, the binary oxide of 5% Zr/Ti catalyst is shown an increase of more NH3 peak around 200–500 °C. NH3-TPD diagram of the 5% Zr/Ti oxide catalyst has a feature of accountable content of relatively acidic catalytic strength sites, increasing apparently as an outcome of the catalytic structure interruption linked with the blend and utmost possible the homogeneous phase involving by binary oxide catalyst of ZrO2-TiO2. In brief, a noticeable characteristic of the catalysts synthesized by impregnation of zirconia to titania support is that revealed an important surface catalytic acidity associated to the low acidity of single oxide of TiO2 or ZrO2 catalysts. The source of the catalytic acidity was not recognized; however, the experiment determined small content dopant of ZrO2 do seem to enter in TiO2 structure is made into consideration, it looks that binary oxide of Ti-O-Zr structure connected with the impregnation sites in the TiO2 support, are significant.

3.4. Reducibility of zirconia-titania catalysts
Fig. 6 reveals the H2-TPR diagram of single oxide zirconia and titania used as reference. The quantity of hydrogen consumed is listed in Table 1. It is determined that primary oxide titania as reference appeared two reduced peaks and Tmax highest at 600–800 °C indicated to reduced Ti4+ oxide to Ti3+ oxide. The reduction peak at Tmax > 800 °C indicated to another reduced oxide of Ti3+ [31]. The single oxide zirconia illustrates a poor reduction temperature than titania with minor peaks at Tmax of 508 °C and 800 °C. The TPR result indicates that zirconia was reduced fairly hard due to the hydrogen consumption was little. The 5% Zr/Ti oxide catalyst synthesized by impregnation method showed more extensive reduction compared to TiO2 as shown in Fig. 6. The different TPR diagram for catalyst in which zirconia was supported by titania, it is likely Zr metal oxide specie grown on titania and this might assist the changes in Tmax. for the Ti4+ to Ti3+ reduction. Overall, the reduction of Zr and Ti oxide by hydrogen reduction before 600 °C was not significant and low that indicate non-oxidative catalyst for CO2 reaction for propane dehydrogenation over Zr-Ti oxide catalyst.

3.5. Catalytic activity results
3.5.1. Reaction without catalyst
For better understanding of propane dehydrogenation assisted by CO2, activity test was conducted for propane conversion at 600 °C without using catalyst. Fig. 7 clearly shows propane conversion at presence of CO2 was in the range of 20–22%, mainly olefins of propylene and ethylene were made as well as methane and hydrogen (Fig. S2) were also produced without using catalyst. The conversion of CO2 was noticed in the range of 2.4% and it converted to CO gas that may indict of low dry reforming reaction and low thermal cracking of C-C of propane gas.

3.5.2. Propane dehydrogenation over single oxides of TiO2 and ZrO2
The study extended to look at the propane dehydrogenation over single oxide of ZrO2 and TiO2. Fig. 7 shows the highest conversion of CO2 over single oxide of TiO2, more than 25%, and propane conversion exceed 90%. The single oxide of ZrO2 showed the propane conversion in the range of 63–64% but less conversion of carbon dioxide (13–14%). The primary oxides of ZrO2 and TiO2 results were shown important concentrations of CO, H2 and methane (Figs. S2 and S3), representing amount of dry reforming reaction and cracking of propane. As could be noted from the Fig. 8, the propylene selectivity is low over catalyst of single oxides compared to activity tested without catalyst.

The thermal cracking of propane without using catalysts was made low propane conversion (< 21%), nevertheless, the selectivity of propylene was made in the range of 42–47%, which exceeded the propylene made from the primary oxide catalysts. On the other hand, titania made conversion of propane 90% but low selectivity to propylene of 4%. Zirconia provided a moderate propane conversion, but poor propylene selectivity of 4%. In brief, there was low reaction among of CO2 and propane without using catalyst, but single oxide catalyst showed higher conversion of CO2 from mainly dry reforming of propane. With primary oxide catalyst of zirconia and titania propane conversion made at a noteworthy, however, the conversion made more dry reforming route and propane thermal cracking, and not to the desired reaction of propane dehydrogenation and poor propylene selectivity.
3.5.3. Effect CO2/propane ratios over 5% ZrO2/TiO2
3.5.3.1. Propane dehydrogenation without using CO2
To gain information regarding the propane dehydrogenation reaction over 5% Zr/Ti oxide, the activity test was conducted without using CO2 gas over a time-on-steam (TOS) of 98 h. Fig. 9 illustrates time-on-stream of propane conversion, propylene and ethylene selectivity, the propane conversion was achieved 63% and declined slightly to 59% over the reaction stream. The propylene selectivity was constant at 24%. This demonstrates very considerably higher reactivity via dehydrogenation reaction compared to the primary oxides. Ethylene selectivity made 11% and slightly raised to 13%. In brief, the catalyst reaction revealed steady propane conversion, however, it is worth to mention that the propylene selectivity was lower as compared to that highlighted values for the commercial of CrO over alumina between 85% and 90% [32].

3.5.3.2. CO2/propane ratio of 1: 1.4
In the present investigation, we made an attempt to correlate the propane dehydrogenation assisted with and without addition of CO2 over 5% Zr/Ti oxide catalyst. The molar ratio of CO2/propane 1:1.4 was conducted an active test of reaction stream of 61 h. Fig. 10 reveals time-on-stream of propane conversion, propylene and ethylene selectivity. The conversion of propane improved with time-on-stream, however, the overall yield of olefin reduced gradually. The propylene/ethylene ratio made 2.2 primarily and declined to 2 at the finish of the reaction stream. The presence of carbon dioxide reduced the propylene selectivity; however, it noticed a raise of the overall propane conversion. The reaction indicated that carbon dioxide stimulates unwanted reactions, probably dry reforming reaction of propane and made further C-C bond breaking of propane to smaller light gas (Fig. S4). At presence of carbon dioxide, the propylene selectivity was poor, the study suggested there was a substantial more propane bond breaking of C-C to smaller molecules (ethane, ethylene, methane, hydrogen) over the catalytic surface with low propane dehydrogenation route.

3.5.3.3. CO2/propane ratio of 2.6: 1
Furthermore, this study tested the increasing effect of CO2/propane ratios to propane dehydrogenation route. The selected CO2/propane molar ratio of 2.6:1, was conducted in order to improve the catalytic surface reaction for more CO2 with H2 via RWGS route (Eq. (2)). Therefore, the study was expected, the occurrence of dry reforming routes may decline. The conversion was operated for time-on-stream for 203 h. Fig. 11 shows the conversion and selectivity do not pursue the conversion made by reduced CO2 ratio. At this ratio, entire conversion was reduced compared to the low CO2 ratio test, but the yield of olefin was improved. In addition, the catalytic reaction showed longer stability over a conversion reaction time-on-stream. Furthermore, the propylene/ethylene ratio of 2.3 which increased compared to the low CO2 ratio test. The increased of CO2 ratio concentration indicates to facilitate in more reaction of RWGS than reaction of dry reforming of propane. The experiment showed a decreased in H2 (Fig. S5). The slight drop of H2 would assist a reducing in the hydrogen adsorption over catalyst, which could contribute as undesired exothermic reaction over catalyst surface, and therefore, the additional heat may hinder the desired reaction of the endothermic dehydrogenation of propane. To gain information regarding the overall evaluation, the yields of propylene and ethylene at two selected CO2 ratios are shown in Fig. 13. A primary remark is that the increased of CO2 ratio affected the increased of olefin yields.

3.5.3.4. CO2/propane ratio 12.2: 1
The study extended for further increasing CO2 content for CO2/propane molar ratio of 12.2: 1, the result showed conversion of propane was minor declined but the selectivity of propylene improved to 63% as shown in Fig. 12. The selectivity of ethylene was also improved to 23% and the total olefins yield was maintained at 40–45%. The yield of propylene was increased as CO2/propane molar ratio at 12.2:1 elevated compared to the other lower ratios of CO2/propane. The experiment produced propylene yield of 29–34% and higher propylene/ethylene ratio was about 2.8 as shown in Fig. 13. The propylene selectivity to ethylene was improved at this relatively high. The study it can be highlighted, the binary oxide of Ti/Zr catalyst reactivity was enhanced by raising CO2/propane molar ratio. It determined that the reduced conversion of propane and improvement of propylene yield as CO2 ratio raised, may be due to an instantaneous decline of dry reforming reaction and C-C cracking and reduction of hydrogen surplus from propane dehydrogenation (Fig. S6). It is worth to mention that the improvement of propylene selectivity than ethylene indicated the breaking bond of C-C revels minor reaction as CO2 ratio is elevated.
3.5.3.5. CO2 conversion
Limited papers emphasized the amount of CO2 utilized for the propane dehydrogenation assisted CO2 reaction. In this work, it is worth to evaluate the catalyst activity of 5% Zr/Ti oxide at 600 °C and CO2 consumed as the ratio of CO2/propane applied. Noticeably, the upraise of CO2 conversions, was measured at less ratio of CO2 applied to propane dehydrogenation, and CO2/propane ratio of 1:1.4, was shown an increase of CO2 utilization gradually from 30% to 75% through time-on-stream, which indicted of probably an increase of dry reforming reaction of propane over catalyst. Remarkably, as increase the ratio of CO2/propane to molar ratio of 12.1:1, the CO2 conversion was declined and increased of propylene selectivity, however, the CO2 utilization decreased to lower than 10% which was used via RWGS reaction of propane dehydrogenation as demonstrated in Fig. 14.

Therefore, these results could be used as good basis to utilize CO2 for propane dehydrogenation. The ratio of CO2 to propane showed an improvement of propylene yield. In addition, CO/H2, propylene/ethylene, dry gas/ olefin ratios and olefin yield over binary oxide catalyst of 5% Zr/Ti, at different CO2/propane molar ratios were tabulated in Table 2. The comparative reactivity of the binary oxide of Zr/Ti catalyst towards to propane bond breaking of C-H, C-C and hydrogenation reaction (Eq. (6)) of ethylene and methyl radicals to ethane or methane have not been discussed. The relation demonstrated the importance to determine dry reforming and RWGS reactions and highlighted thermodynamic competing reactions to determine the important of carbon dioxide presence for the propane dehydrogenation route. Table 2, as the ratio of CO2/propane increased from 1:1.4–12.2:1 showed an improvement of CO/H2 ratio and increased from 1.1 to 4.6, which designated to more RWGS route conducted and more CO formulated and consumed more hydrogen molecule in order to assist the propane dehydrogenation reaction. In addition, as CO/H2 ratio increased, a declined of the dry gas/olefin ratio which indicted a lower hydrogenation reaction of ethylene and increased the overall olefin yield formation from 24.4% to 43%. The increase of CO yield that suggested unwanted dry reforming route to be insignificant during the CO2 gas ratio elevated. The comparable remark of the study, that the propylene to ethylene ratio raised as CO2 gas is elevated which performs as dual function, it is assisted more propylene selectivity to be produced via RWGS reaction and decrease the hydrogenation reaction over catalyst to increase total olefin. An explanation is CO2 ratio assisted in quick eliminating of adsorbed H atoms over catalytic surface, and that stimulating for more propylene formation from carbon-hydrogen bond breaking instead of carbon-carbon bond breaking reaction.

The catalytic reactivity showed by the binary oxide associated to the primary oxide of Zr and Ti are not clear. The X-ray diffraction study was demonstrated that the 1 0 1 and 2 0 0 anatase peaks of TiO2 was reduced due to incorporating by ZrO2. The texture properties analysis shows only slight changes between the binary oxide of Zr/Ti and primary oxide catalyst. On the other hand, the TPD reveals that the binary oxide of Zr/Ti are considerably an increase of catalytic acidity than the primary oxide component of ZrO2 and TiO2 alone. The initial outline, the developed catalytic acidic surface of catalyst mixture is suggested to assist the reactivity to the target reaction route. The source of the catalytic acidity is unknown, but it indicates a probable that it was associated to the structural of Zr-O-Ti made from combination of the zirconium oxide in the titania structural support.
Consequently, the present investigation, we made an attempt to correlate the propane dehydrogenation at presence CO2. The utilization was achieved for CO2 in the range less 10%, was not reported before by propane dehydrogenation method, and it dissociates to CO and potential by-product for hydrogen production through water gas shift (WGS) in order to assist the process economy credit. The assisted reaction of propane dehydrogenation by CO2 increases the olefins yield and high propylene/ethylene ratio. It is worth to mention, the presence of CO2 raises of the propylene and ethylene selectivity. The propylene selectivity increased that indicated the carbon-carbon bond breaking tends little favored as CO2/C3H8 molar ratio increased. The propylene yield was achieved near to the commercial figures of propylene processing with higher olefins. The important role of reaction at presence of CO2 showed an increase of reaction time-on-stream indicated of highly catalytic stable of the non-oxidative catalyst of 5% Zr-Ti oxide.
4. Conclusions
This study addressed the CO2-assisted dehydrogenation of propane to propylene and ethylene. The dehydrogenation of propane is thermodynamically limited; however, this research determined the importance of reaction route which takes place on the suitable catalytic surface. The studied catalyst was the binary oxide catalysts of zirconia supported by titania with an appropriate amount in which the zirconia was closely combined through the support and it did not appear as a separate crystalline diffraction. The binary oxide of zirconia-titania structure, as measured by powder XRD, slightly changed of anatase 1 0 0 and 2 0 0 by the impregnation of zirconia to the anatase. The other characterization techniques elaborated that the binary oxide catalysts displayed substantial catalytic surface acidity, and formulated Zr-O-Ti catalytic sites via the anatase structure through the impregnation of the primary oxide loaded. The ratio of CO2 assisted the improvement reaction thermodynamic of propylene yield through reaction of C-H bond breaking of propane than carbon-carbon bond breaking and dry reforming reaction of propane. The reaction time-on-stream results indicated that the synthesized catalyst was highly stable for longer reaction time and active. Therefore, these results could be used as good basis to utilize CO2 for propane dehydrogenation reaction.
