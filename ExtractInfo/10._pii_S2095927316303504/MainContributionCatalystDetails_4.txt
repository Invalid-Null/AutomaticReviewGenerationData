 Based on reviewing the document, this does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The document provides a broad review of catalytic alkane dehydrogenation using both heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts, but does not focus on propane dehydrogenation. It mentions the CATOFIN and FBD processes for propane dehydrogenation briefly, but does not provide details on scientific contributions or specific catalyst improvements for propane dehydrogenation.
