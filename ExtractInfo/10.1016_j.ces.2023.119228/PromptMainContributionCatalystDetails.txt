Abstract
Understanding and modulating the dynamic structural evolution is of great significance in developing high-performance heterogeneous catalysts. This work investigates the effect of potassium (K) promoter on the carburization and oxidation of Fe phases during CO2 hydrogenation over an iron-based catalyst using in-situ X-ray diffraction, in-situ infrared spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed techniques. The addition of K enhances CO2 adsorption of the catalyst, promotes the reaction of CO2 with the dissociated hydrogen, and accelerates the carburization of Fe(0) to Fe3C and then to Fe5C2. In addition to impacting the reactive microenvironment of the catalyst surface on the competitive adsorption and reactions, the addition of K also prevents the active Fe5C2 phase from oxidation during CO2 hydrogenation. With an optimized content of K and CO pretreatment, the iron-based catalysts were endowed with high catalytic activity for CO2 conversion to C2-C4 olefins and C5+ long-chain hydrocarbons. This work provides insight into the correlation between the reactive microenvironment and the structural evolution of Fe catalysts doped with K promoter and shall be beneficial for future development of new catalytic materials for CO2 hydrogenation, and possibly other reactions.

1. Introduction
The increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emission has a significant impact on climate change. CO2 capture and utilization is a promising pathway toward a low-carbon economy and has received much attention (Gao et al., 2022, Saravanan et al., 2021, Wei et al., 2021). Catalytic hydrogenation is a promising route to convert CO2 to fuels and value-added chemicals (Modak et al., 2020, Shen et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2013). Iron (Fe) -based catalysts are active for CO2 hydrogenation to hydrocarbons. However, most of the unpromoted Fe catalysts are not efficient for chain growth, and a secondary component is needed for a higher selectivity toward olefins and long-chain hydrocarbons (Wang et al., 2018). Also, the structural evolution of Fe, involving competitive carburization and oxidation, determines the catalytic performance of the catalyst (Zhu et al., 2022). Thus, understanding the effect of the promotors on the dynamic transformation of Fe phases is of great significance for developing highly efficient catalysts.
Alkali promoters are conducive to the chain growth for producing hydrocarbons, among which K is most frequently used (García-Hurtado et al., 2020, Numpilai et al., 2020, Ramirez et al., 2019a). You et al. found that the addition of K promoter in Fe-based catalysts improved the CO2 conversion from 6 to over 40 %. The catalyst was also optimized to a high selectivity of 50 % toward C2-C4 olefins (You et al., 2013). K can also modulate the reaction pathway of CO2 hydrogenation (Li et al., 2022). Liu et al. reported that CO2 was hydrogenated into C2+ hydrocarbons either with or without going through a gas-phase CO intermediate over the bare iron carbide, while the hydrocarbons was formed mainly through CO over K-modified iron carbide (Liu et al., 2021a). In addition, alkalis were reported being able to enhance the CO2 adsorption on the catalyst surface due to the increased alkalinity (Han et al., 2020, Zhu et al., 2020b) while impeding the olefins adsorption, that leads to a high selectivity to olefins (Zhai et al., 2016). The adsorption/activation of CO2, H2, CO and olefins are suggested to be related to the electronic effects on iron in iron carbides (Yang et al., 2022). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the adsorption strength of CO2 is enhanced and the energy barriers for CO2 dissociation are reduced in the presence of K (Nie et al., 2018), which has been experimentally proved (Han et al., 2020, Ramirez et al., 2018, Riedel et al., 1999). Moreover, K could facilitate the formation of the active Fe5C2 phase in the catalyst during CO2 hydrogenation (Fischer et al., 2016, Li et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2013, You et al., 2013).
Although much effort has been made to understand the adsorption properties of the K doped iron-based catalyst and its pathway for catalyzing the CO2 hydrogenation, the effect of K on the progressive structural evolution of Fe remains ambiguous (Niu et al., 2022). It is challenging since diverse iron phases (iron carbide and iron oxide) exist simultaneously, and the iron–carbon–oxygen system is dynamically interacting during CO2 hydrogenation (de Smit and Weckhuysen, 2008). In general, the carburization of Fe catalysts occurs during reactions (Skrypnik et al., 2021, Witoon et al., 2021, Zhao et al., 2021). For example, Zhang et al. found that α-Fe and γ-Fe transformed into Fe5C2 and Fe3C, respectively, during the catalytic CO2 hydrogenation (Zhang et al., 2018). It is also worth mentioning that iron-carbide phases are greatly sensitive to H2O and CO2 (Yang et al., 2023). The oxidation to Fe3O4 of iron (carbide) catalysts causes the deactivation during CO2 hydrogenation (Zhang et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2019). The phase transition in the iron-based catalyst is determined by the chemical potentials of oxygen, hydrogen and carbon, whereas the dynamic surface structure of the catalyst is highly correlated to the competitive reactions on the surface, including hydrogenation, carbon deposition, oxygen removal and carbon permeation (Niu et al., 2017, Tang et al., 2021, Zhu et al., 2022). Till now, the effect of K on the catalytic microenvironment and the structural evolution of Fe in the catalyst, however, has not yet been well understood.
Herein, using multiple in-situ characterization techniques, including in-situ X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and temperature-programmed techniques, the structural evolution of Fe(0) during CO2 hydrogenation was tracked and the effect of K on the carburization and oxidation of the Fe phase was investigated. The results provide insight into the effects of K promotor on the iron-based catalysts, and will guide the rational design of highly efficient catalysts for producing value-added hydrocarbons through CO2 hydrogenation.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Catalyst preparation
2.5 g of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 1.5 g of urea were dissolved in 75 mL of deionized water under stirring. The solution was transferred to an autoclave and heated at 85 °C for 0.5 h, and then 120 °C for 5 h. The obtained powder was washed and finally calcined at 500 °C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2 °C·min−1. KHCO3 was doped with the as-prepared Fe2O3 by grinding the mixture for 5 min to obtain the xK-Fe catalysts, where x represents the mass ratio of K to Fe2O3 (K: Fe2O3 = x %).
The K2CO3-supported iron catalysts were prepared from the incipient wetness impregnation method. 0.5 g of ethanol dissolving 0.32 g of iron acetylacetonate was dropped on 1.45 g of KHCO3, followed by drying at 100 °C overnight and calcining at 500 °C for 4 h. The product was denoted as 5Fe/K2CO3.
All the chemicals used were of analytical grade and were purchased from Damao Chemical Reagent Factory, China.
2.2. Characterization
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a TGA/SDTA851e Thermobalance (Mettler Toledo) with a sample weight between 10 and 20 mg. The data were collected in the range of 30–800 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C·min−1 in N2 flow.
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were determined using a Rigaku SmartLab 9 kW diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) for scanning angles (2 theta) of 5–80°. The data were collected with a step size of 0.02° at a voltage of 45 kV and a current of 200 mA.
In-situ XRD measurements were carried out in an XRK 900 reactor chamber made by Anton Paar Corporation to monitor the evolution of iron phases. For a typical test, approximately 50 mg of powder was placed on the sample stage and heated to 400 °C in a flow of pure H2 at 40 mL·min−1 for the pre-reduction treatment. After that, the sample was cooled to 320 °C while the system was switched to the feed gas (CO2/H2/N2 = 21:63:16) with a total flow rate of 30 mL·min−1. The pressure of the whole process was kept at 0.8 MPa, where the catalytic performance is comparable with that at 3 MPa, according to the previous work (Jiang et al., 2018). The XRD patterns were collected with a speed of 5°·min−1.
Temperature-programmed testing was performed on a fixed-bed reactor with a PFEIFFER OmniStar online mass spectrometer. For H2 temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), approximately 50 mg of sample was loaded in a U-type tube and heated from 30 to 850 °C with a ramping rate of 5 °C·min−1 in pure H2 at 20 mL·min−1. For temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO), approximately 50 mg of sample was pre-reduced in pure H2 at 500 °C for 60 min under atmospheric pressure, followed by cooling to room temperature (RT). The TPO program was initiated after 40% CO2 in Ar or 5% H2O in Ar was fed in, and the sample was heated from RT to 700 °C at 5 °C·min−1. The water vapor was introduced by bumbling Ar into a heated gas-washing bottle filled with water (∼40 °C for 5% H2O according to Antoine equation). For CO2 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD), 40% CO2 in Ar was fed on the same reduced samples at RT for 30 min. Then the analysis program was initiated after switching atmosphere to pure Ar and heating up to 750 °C at 5 °C·min−1. For temperature-programmed surface reaction (TPSR), the data were collected when the pre-reduced sample was treated with a mixture of reactant gases (CO2/H2/Ar = 20:60:20) at atmospheric pressure. The temperature was ramped from 30 − 320 °C with a rate of 5 °C·min−1 and held continuously at 320 °C for 1 h.
In-situ Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy was conducted on a Thermo Nicolet iS50 spectrometer with a mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. The sample was firstly pre-reduced at 400 °C and 0.8 MPa in pure H2 for 2 h, followed by cooling to 320 °C. The spectra were continuously collected after the gas was switched to reactant gases (CO2/H2 = 1:3) for 1 h at 0.8 MPa.
2.3. Catalytic testing
A continuous flow fixed-bed reactor was used to evaluate the catalytic performance for CO2 hydrogenation. 0.2 g of catalyst was placed in a quartz tube (inner diameter of 8 mm) and reduced by pure H2 with a volumetric flow rate of 36 mL·min−1 at 400 °C and 3 MPa for 4 h. After cooling to 320 °C, the reactant gases (CO2/H2/N2 = 21: 63: 16) was fed into the reactor at 3 MPa. Products of the reaction were analyzed by an online gas chromatograph (Agilent 7890B) with two channels. One channel with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and the columns of Porapak Q and 5A molecular sieve is for CO, CO2, CH4 and N2 analysis; another channel with a flame ionized detector (FID) and columns of HP-5 and Plot-Q is for hydrocarbons and alcohol. The CO2 conversion (X) and the selectivity (Sel.) were calculated following the equations below:

3. Results and discussion
The as-prepared Fe2O3 nanoparticles have a uniform size of about 40 nm with a surface area of 26 m2·g−1, as reported in our previous work (Zhu et al., 2022). After pre-reduction at 400 °C and 3 MPa, the Fe(0) catalysts were evaluated in CO2 hydrogenation. For the unpromoted Fe catalyst (0K-Fe), CO2 conversion and selectivity to C2+ hydrocarbons firstly increased, and then decreased to a steady state after a time-on-stream (TOS) of 4 h (Fig. 1a). The variation of the catalytic performance reflects the dynamic structural evolution of the catalysts: the carburization of Fe(0) to Fe5C2 results in higher CO2 conversion and C2+ production, while the partial surface oxidation to Fe3O4 leads to the deactivation of the catalyst (Zhu et al., 2022). With an addition of 0.1 % K, a similar dynamic catalytic performance was observed but the deactivation phenomenon is inhibited (Fig. 1b). The CO2 conversion increased from 28 to 35% within the first 1.5 h, and then decreased to 31% at the TOS of 9.5 h. The deactivation rate (average in 8 h) was 0.5 % h−1, much lower than that over 0K-Fe (1.2 % h−1). With a higher K content (0.5 and 1%), the induction period was still observed during the first 1–2 h, while there was almost no deactivation during the reaction (Fig. 1c and d). Increasing the K content will lead to a decrease in the hydrogenation activity of Fe and therefore to the preferred formation of olefins that may re-adsorb and allow further chain growth (Russkikh et al., 2020). At the steady state, the selectivity to low-carbon olefins (C2-C4=) increased along with the increased K content. This selectivity is above 27% over 1K-Fe catalyst, approximately 9 times higher than that of the bare Fe catalysts (Fig. 1e). The ratio of olefin to paraffin (O/P) increases continuously from 0.1 to 6 after adding 0.5 % K, and then remains constant with increasing K content. A high C2-C4= formation rate (normalized by mass of Fe, Fe-time yield, FTY) of 21.4 mmolCO2·h−1·gFe−1 and C5+ FTY of 22.5 mmolCO2·h−1·gFe−1 were observed over the 0.5K-Fe catalyst (Table S1).

(e) CO2 hydrogenation performance and (f) hydrocarbon distribution (CO-free) at steady state (TOS = 8 h). O/P refers to the ratio of olefin to paraffin. Alpha (α) stands for the chain-growth factor. Reaction conditions: T = 320 °C, p = 3 MPa, H2/CO2 = 3.
The selectivity to the co-product CO also increased with the addition of K promoter. 32.5% of CO was produced when the K loading increased from 1 to 3%, while the CO2 conversion decreased to 29% over the 3K-Fe catalyst (Fig. S1). The distribution of hydrocarbons (CO-free) shifted toward C5+ hydrocarbons and olefins after 0.1 and 0.5% of K were doped and remained almost unchanged with higher loadings (Fig. 1f). The chain-growth factor (α) follows a similar trend (Fig. S2). The CO selectivity increased from 24.8 to 32.5% with the increasing K loading from 0.5 to 3%, but the CO-free product distribution remained unchanged. Matching the rate of reverse gas water shift (RWGS) reaction and the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process determines the product selectivity (Xu et al., 2020). The results indicate that at high loadings (>1%), the promotion of K on chain growth (FT) was saturated and K mainly induced the CO generation (RWGS). On Na-promoted Fe catalysts, increasing Na content will increase CO2 conversion and hydrocarbon selectivity, while after it reaching 0.5%, higher Na content would cause the decrease of CO2 conversion (Liang et al., 2019). Similarly, further increasing K loadings (higher than 3%) will also have negative effects, releasing more CO, which is undesired. To sum up, K modification improved the catalytic stability and the productivity of olefins and C5+ long-chain hydrocarbons. On the other hand, K in excess led to an increase in CO selectivity.
TPSR experiments were carried out to further explore the progressive reaction over the xK-Fe catalysts. As shown in Fig. 2a, CO2 was consumed from 261 °C over the 0K-Fe catalyst, accompanied by the generation of CO and H2O, indicating the occurrence of the RWGS reaction. The mass signals of the hydrocarbons including their fragments emerged at 286 °C (Fig. 2b). On the Fe(0) catalyst, RWGS reaction occurred first, and during the followed temperature ramping, the hydrocarbons could be observed, consisting with the induction period in Fig. 1. After the addition of 1 % K, RWGS still occurred at 262 °C, but the chain growth reaction took place from 270 °C, which was 16 °C lower than that for 0K-Fe. The TPSR results show that the addition of K could shorten the induction period of the Fe catalysts. K could promote the Fe-catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation mainly by two ways: i) influencing the structure of iron-based components; ii) interacting with some of reactants and/or products. For example, previous studies have shown that K enhances the desorption of olefins (Zhai et al., 2016) so that to improve their selectivity. Then our work will primarily focus on the promotion effect of K on the structural evolution of Fe.

For the fresh catalysts, the main phase was Fe2O3 (PDF#85-0599) according to the XRD patterns in Fig. S3a, and no diffractions of K species were observed due to the low content of 1%. The TGA curve of pure KHCO3 shows that it decomposed to K2CO3 at 100–250 °C (Fig. S3b), and there is no weight loss at higher temperatures. Therefore, the fresh catalysts were likely consist of Fe2O3 and K2CO3. After CO2 hydrogenation for 8 h, the formation of Fe3O4 and Fe5C2 was observed in the spent catalysts. As shown in Fig. 3, Fe3O4 with the characteristic diffraction peaks at 35.5°, 30.2°, 57.0° and 62.7° was identified for the unpromoted Fe catalyst, with a weak diffraction peak of Fe5C2 at around 44°. With the introduction of 0.1 % K, the Fe5C2 diffraction peaks of higher intensity was observed at 44.1° and 43.4°. Interestingly, only Fe5C2 characteristic peaks were found in the XRD patterns for the samples with the K content of higher than 0.5%. Fe5C2 is regarded as the main active phase for the production of C2+ hydrocarbons (Zhang et al., 2019, Zhu et al., 2020a). The carburization of metallic Fe leads to higher CO2 conversion and C2+ selectivity, while the oxidation of Fe5C2 to Fe3O4 during the reactions causes the catalyst deactivation (Gao et al., 2020, Zhu et al., 2022). Previous work has shown that Na inhibits the oxidation of Fe catalysts (Liang et al., 2019). In this work, the XRD results together with the catalytic performance show that the addition of K could also inhibit the oxidation to Fe3O4 during CO2 hydrogenation thus impeding the catalyst deactivation. On supported catalysts, K facilitating the formation of active Fe5C2 phase has been reported on MgO-supported (Yuan et al., 2023) and single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)-supported (Wang et al., 2022b) Fe-based catalysts. Therefore, further understanding this promotion effect is vital.

Fig. 3. XRD patterns of the spent xK-Fe catalysts.
The in-situ XRD was performed to track the phase transformation during both the pre-reduction and reaction process. During the pre-reduction, Fe2O3 was found progressively reduced to Fe3O4 and then to Fe (PDF#85-1410), as shown in Fig. 4a – d. For the unpromoted Fe2O3, the diffraction peak centered at 44.5° from 350 °C, corresponding to the formation of α-Fe. For 0.1 K-Fe, the diffraction peaks of α-Fe was also observed at 350 °C, but the intensity was lower than that of the unpromoted Fe. In contrast, the diffraction peaks of α-Fe becomes unobvious for 1 K-Fe or 3 K-Fe at 350 °C. In addition, the main phase for 3 K-Fe at 300 °C appeared to be Fe2O3 while that was Fe3O4 for the other low-K-content catalysts, indicating that the reduction was inhibited as the K content increased. This could be attributed to that K strengthens Fe-O bonds of Fe2O3, as suggested in a previous work (Li et al., 2016). On the other hand, a small amount of metallic Fe formed at the beginning of the reduction could facilitate the adsorption and dissociation of H2, thus promoting the further bulk reduction. Song et al. have reported that K reduces this chemisorption of H2 on Fe sites (Boreriboon et al., 2018). Given these, we speculate that the reduction of the H2 adsorption on the K doped iron catalyst was attributed to inhibition of the progressive reduction of Fe2O3 to metallic Fe.

Testing conditions: p = 0.8 MPa, pure H2. CO2 hydrogenation: (e) 0K-Fe, (f) 0.1K-Fe, (g) 1K-Fe and (h) 3K-Fe. Testing conditions: p = 0.8 MPa, T = 320 °C, H2/CO2 = 3.
Although the reduction behavior of the xK-Fe catalyst varies, all of them can be reduced to metallic Fe at 400 °C. The phase transformation of these catalysts during the CO2 hydrogenation was analyzed using the in-situ XRD. Without K, the α-Fe peaks persisted for 40 min from the beginning of reaction (Fig. 4e). In contrast, diffractions of α-Fe disappeared and those of iron carbides showed up within 20 min on stream for the catalysts loaded with 0.1 % K (Fig. 4f), in less than 10 min for 1 K-Fe (Fig. 4g). This carburization happened immediately when the reactant gas was fed for the 3 K-Fe sample (Fig. 4h). These results indicate that K accelerates the carburization of metallic Fe during the CO2 hydrogenation, consistent with Claeys (Fischer et al., 2016) and Wen’s work (Niu et al., 2017). Adding to that, metallic Fe was completely converted to Fe3C (PDF#89-2867) within 2 h, as shown in Fig. 4e. For the K-promoted Fe catalysts, the diffractions at 39.4°, 44.2° and 50.0° corresponding to Fe5C2 (PDF#89-2544) appeared and became more intense during the reactions (the dash lines in Fig. 4e – h). The stability of iron carbide, e.g. Fe2C, Fe5C2 and Fe3C, depends on the carbon potential (de Smit et al., 2010, Niu et al., 2017). Our previous work has shown that Fe5C2 is the most thermodynamically favorable among the different iron carbides under the reaction conditions here (Zhu et al., 2022), while the transformation from Fe(0) to the carbon-rich Fe5C2 goes through the carbon-deficient Fe3C (Pérez-Alonso et al., 2007, Zhu et al., 2022). The in-situ XRD results here indicate that K accelerated this transition.
The composition of α-Fe and Fe3C was identified from the XRD patterns after the unpromoted catalyst was on stream for 1 h, whereas a mixture of Fe3C and Fe5C2 was observed on the K-promoted catalysts, as shown in Fig. 5a. At TOS of 5 h (Fig. 5b), the α-Fe phase was completely transformed to Fe3C for 0K-Fe, whereas the diffraction peaks of Fe5C2 were found for all of the K-contained catalysts. To avoid misinterpreting the overlapped peaks of Fe5C2 and Fe3C, we also conducted a quantitative analysis for the samples by comparing their intensity ratios of the peaks at 50.0° to 49.0°, as shown in Fig. 5c. Within 400 min on stream, the intensity ratio of Fe5C2 to Fe3C on 0K-Fe remained almost unchanged (the initial slight decrease is due to the absence of Fe5C2 and the formation of Fe3C), indicating there was no Fe3C transforming to Fe5C2. With the addition of K promoter, this ratio continuously increased during the reaction, indicating a phase transition from Fe3C to Fe5C2. The higher K loading from 0.1–1% leads to a higher slope of the scatters in Fig. 5c, reflecting a faster carburization of the catalyst, while a further increase to 3% had little effect on the carburization rate. In the meantime, the peaks of Fe3O4 appeared on 0K-Fe at TOS of 5 h, as shown in Fig. 5b, while that were not obvious on 0.1 K-Fe and absent on 1 K-Fe and 3 K-Fe. Therefore, K not only facilitates the conversion of Fe to Fe3C and then to Fe5C2, but also inhibits the oxidation during CO2 hydrogenation.

H2-TPR experiments were carried out to investigate the effect of K on the reducibility of Fe catalysts, and the results are shown in Fig. S4. For the unpromoted Fe catalyst, the reduction peak at 314 °C corresponds to the transformation from Fe2O3 to Fe3O4, and another broad peak at around 450 °C corresponds to that from Fe3O4 to Fe.(Wei et al., 2016) After the introduction of K, the first reduction peak shifts towards higher temperature, which appears at 315, 322 and 339 °C for 0.1 K-Fe, 0.5 K-Fe and 1 K-Fe, respectively, showing the reduction of Fe2O3 was suppressed by the alkali promoter, which consists with the in-situ XRD results.
CO2 and the co-product H2O can oxidize Fe or iron carbide during the CO2 hydrogenation, as follows: Fe + CO2 → Fe3O4 + CO or Fe + H2O → Fe3O4 + H2 (Zhang et al., 2021). The consumption of CO2 or H2O and the production of CO or H2 were both observed according to their mass signals during TPO tests, as shown in Fig. 6. For the reduced 0K-Fe, the CO2 oxidation occurred at 481 °C, which is approximately 100 °C lower than that of 1 % K-promoted Fe (Fig. 6a). In H2O-TPO profiles, there is a broad peak indicating the interaction between the water vapor and metallic Fe. The oxidation peak locates at 524 °C for the unpromoted catalyst while 668 °C for the reduced 1K-Fe. The TPO result demonstrates that the addition of K could restrain the H2O oxidation of Fe. Combining the catalytic performance and in-situ XRD results, we conclude that the addition of K could prevent Fe(0) and FeCx from oxidation, and improves the stability of the catalyst during CO2 hydrogenation.

According to the theoretical calculations, the presence of K reduces the reaction barrier for the hydrogenation of surface O* and OH* species (O* + H* = OH*, OH* + H* = H2O*) on Fe5C2 (5 1 0) plane, thus avoiding the accumulation of these chemical species (Wang et al., 2022a, Zhang et al., 2023). The structural evolution of Fe catalysts is highly dependent on the surface microenvironment, where the competitive reactions involves oxygen removal, hydrogenation and carbon deposition (Tang et al., 2021). We have shown K inhibits the reduction of FeOx in pure H2 feed, which is believed due to the suppressed dissociative adsorption of H2. Adding to that, K plays a more important role on removing surface O* species thus preventing the oxidation of iron carbide during CO2 hydrogenation. Therefore, the K promoter has a significant impact on the surface competitive reactions so as to the microenvironment and the structural evolution of Fe catalysts.
The in-situ DRIFT experiments were carried out to investigate the promotion effect. The xK-Fe catalysts were pre-reduced at 400 °C and 0.8 MPa in pure H2, and then treated with the gas mixture of CO2 and H2 at 320 °C. In Fig. 7, the IR bands of gaseous CO at 2100 cm−1 and those of C-H bonds in hydrocarbons at 2800–3000 cm−1 appear as TOS increase (Zhu et al., 2020a). Also, the HxCyOz species including carbonates, bicarbonates and formate at 1400–1700 cm−1 were observed (Liu et al., 2021b, Pan et al., 2014, Zhu et al., 2020a), which are considered as important intermediates to form CHx monomers for further chain growth (Nie et al., 2022). The vibration of OH groups at 3500–3800 cm−1 corresponds to the co-product H2O. From the three-dimension contour DRIFT spectra as shown in Fig. 7a – c, the bands for CO could be clearly observed during the whole 60 min of CO2 hydrogenation, while those of CHx species appeared after a certain time on stream: 20 min for 0.5 K- and 1 K-Fe, and 10 min for 3 K-Fe. The formed CO can carburize Fe or Fe3O4 (Skrypnik et al., 2021). Therefore, the IR results indicate that the RWGS reaction occurs at the beginning of CO2 hydrogenation to produce CO, which in turn promoted the carburization, and iron carbides catalyze the production of hydrocarbons. This resulted in an induction period. In contrast, no CO was generated within 60 min over the unpromoted iron catalysts, and the CHx bands of weak intensity appeared after 20 min of TOS, as shown in Fig. 7d. This suggests that K could promote the carburization of Fe by accelerating the RWGS reaction, facilitate the C2+ production, and shorten the activation period of the catalysts.

The effect of K species on promoting the RWGS reaction was verified by using a pure K2CO3 catalyst for CO2 hydrogenation, as shown in Fig. 8a. The reaction was highly selective (about 90%) to CO production. However, 0.5% of CO2 was converted even at a low flow rate of 15 mL·min−1. The absence of Fe hindered the H2 dissociation thus suppressed the RWGS reaction. By adding 5% Fe into the K2CO3 catalyst, the CO2 conversion was improved by an order of magnitude to 12% under the same space velocity, while the main product of the reaction was still CO, as shown in Fig. 8b.

These results verified that RWGS reaction, instead of the chain growth, occurs dominately over K-rich catalysts, and CO2 adsorption and dissociation is not a rate-limited step of CO2 hydrogenation over the K-rich catalysts. To further verify the promotion effect of K on CO2 adsorption, as shown in Fig. S5a, CO2 desorption peaks are observed at 183, 451 and 662 °C for 0.5 K-Fe and 1 K-Fe, but inexistent over the unpromoted Fe catalyst. The desorption peaks lower than 200 °C correspond to the weak adsorption of CO2 on the surface of catalysts, and those at 450–480 °C are ascribed to the chemisorption of CO2 on the strong basic sites (Xu et al., 2020). The peak at around 662 °C is assigned to the decomposition of carbonates, which can be concluded from the Ar-treated 1 K-Fe, as shown in Fig. S5b. Compared with the unpromoted Fe, 0.5K-Fe and 1K-Fe exhibit more peaks of CO2 desorption and the peak area increases with the increasing K content, indicating that K species could enhance CO2 adsorption on Fe catalysts (Russkikh et al., 2020).
Some of the previous works doped the fresh catalysts with different K species, such as K2O, KOH, KNO3. These chemicals, however, are not stable in the CO2– and H2O-contained steam, in which the K species remains ambiguous during the reaction. Jorge Gascon et al. proposed that K exists in the mixture of carbonate (K2CO3), bicarbonate (KHCO3) and formate (HCOOK) during CO2 hydrogenation (Ramirez et al., 2019b). Combining these results with our characterization for the xK-Fe catalysts, we believe that during the reaction, K2CO3 reacts with CO2 (plus one H2O) to form KHCO3, and the latter one is reduced by H2 to HCOOK, which further goes back to K2CO3 and release CO, as shown in Fig. S6 and Eqs. S1-S4. These three K species have similar stabilities under reaction conditions, and the interconversion of them is possible, which has been proven by thermodynamic calculations (Ramirez et al., 2019b). Thus, CO2 is adsorbed on the surface of the catalysts, reacts with the dissociative hydrogen on the neighboring Fe sites, and is finally converted to gaseous CO via the interconversion of potassium carbonate, bicarbonate and formate. In this way, CO2 adsorption is enhanced and RWGS reaction is promoted as well. The close intimacy between the CO intermediate and Fe(0) provides more possibilities for carburization. As discussed, K is conducive to enhance CO2 adsorption and remove the surface O* species as well, leading to an increased chemical potential of carbon (μC) and the decreased chemical potential of oxygen (μO). Based on the thermodynamic calculation, high μC and low μO favor carburization and inhibit oxidation (Zhu et al., 2022).
After 10-hour CO2 hydrogenation, sinter was observed on the 1K-Fe catalyst. The bulk aggregation (with the particle size over 500 nm) in dark color of the sintered catalyst is confirmed to be Fe5C2 according to the lattice spacing, as shown in Fig. 9a and b. In the elemental distribution analysis, K species is found uniformly distributed on the surface of Fe5C2 particles and a core-shell structures of Fe@K were observed (Fig. 9c). The high dispersion and uniform distribution of K is believed due to the migration of K species during the transformation of K2CO3, KHCO3 and HCOOK.

CO is often used as a carburization agent for preparing a high-Fe5C2-content catalyst (Tang et al., 2021). Considering the stabilizing effect of K, CO was used to pretreat 0.5 K-Fe for further improving the catalytic performance. As shown in Fig. S7, CO2 conversion over the 0.5 K-Fe catalyst pretreated by CO was 41.7%, which is higher than that of 32.9% over the H2-pretreated catalyst. Correspondingly, the selectivity to the co-product CO decreased from 23.8 to 9.5%; selectivity of C2-C4 olefins and C5+ long-chain hydrocarbons increased from 28.4 and 29.4% to 32.6 and 35.3%, respectively. As shown in Fig. S8 and Table S2, a high yield of C2-C4 olefins and C5+ long-chain hydrocarbons was achieved over the developed K-doped iron catalyst with CO treatment. The CO2 conversion rate increased from 78.6 to 100.5 mmolCO2·h−1·gFe−1, as shown as Fig. S7b, and FTY of C2-C4 olefins and C5+ hydrocarbons are 32.8 and 35.5 mmolCO2·h−1·gFe−1, respectively.
4. Conclusions
This study investigated the effect of K promoter on the carburization and oxidation of Fe phases during CO2 hydrogenation over the iron-based catalyst using in-situ XRD, DRIFT and temperature-programmed techniques. The results show that K species enhances CO2 adsorption on the iron-based catalyst, promotes the RWGS reaction, and facilitates the CO formation. The addition of K species also accelerates the carburization of Fe(0) to Fe3C and then to Fe5C2 at the beginning of CO2 hydrogenation. The K species enables a carbon-rich and oxygen-poor microenvironment on the catalyst surface through a series of competitive adsorption and reactions, which prevents the active Fe5C2 phase from oxidation by H2O and CO2. This work provides insight into the correlation between the reactive microenvironment and the structural evolution of Fe catalysts with K promoter and shall be beneficial for future development of new catalytic materials for CO2 hydrogenation, and possibly other reactions.
