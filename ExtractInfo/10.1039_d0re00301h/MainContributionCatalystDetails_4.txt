The given document discusses chemical looping technology for alkane utilization including partial oxidation of methane, oxidative coupling of methane, and oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane, propane and butane. It does not specifically discuss propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) to convert propane to propylene. Since the document does not pertain to PDH or ODH of propane, I have indicated "No" for relevance and did not include any catalyst details.
