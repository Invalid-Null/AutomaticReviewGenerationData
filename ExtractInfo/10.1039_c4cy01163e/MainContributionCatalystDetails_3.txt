The provided document does not contain any information about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on studies of sulfate species promoting effect on Fe2O3/Al2O3 catalysts in catalytic dehydrogenation of propane. While it mentions conversion of propane to propylene, it does not specify if this process involves oxidative dehydrogenation. Therefore, I cannot extract the requested information about catalyst details, performance enhancements, or process conditions related to PDH or ODH. The document appears unrelated to the focus on advancements in PDH and ODH catalysts.
