Simple addition of silica to an alkane solution of a Wilkinson WMe6 or Schrock W alkylidyne complex gives an active complex for saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbon metathesis†
The addition of partially dehydroxylated silica (PDS) to a solution of the Wilkinson WMe6 as well as the Schrock W neopentylidyne tris neopentyl complex catalyzes linear or cyclic alkanes to produce respectively a distribution of linear alkanes from methane up to triacontane or a mixture of cyclic and macrocyclic hydrocarbons. This single catalytic system transforms also linear α-olefins into higher and lower homologues via an isomerization/metathesis mechanism (ISOMET). This complex is also efficient towards functionalized olefins. Unsaturated fatty acid esters (FAEs) are converted into diesters corresponding to self-metathesis products.
The conversion of linear or cyclic alkanes to higher and lower homologues, namely alkane metathesis, is a promising valuable transformation in the petrochemical industry.1 Disproportionation of hydrocarbons was initially discovered by Burnett and Hughes employing two supported heterogeneous catalytic systems operating at high temperature.2 Later, it was found that silica supported tantalum polyhydrides and silica supported group VI polyhydrides, prepared by surface organometallic chemistry, are efficient multifunctional single metal pre-catalysts for propane metathesis.3 Inspired by their early work in the dual catalyst system, Goldman and Brookhart reported a total homogeneous tandem catalytic system for this transformation.4 This catalytic process employs typically an iridium ligated pincer complex, for hydrogenation/dehydrogenation reactions, associated with a molybdenum Schrock-type catalyst for olefin metathesis.4 They found that either linear alkanes4 or cyclic alkanes5 are catalyzed into their corresponding lower and higher homologues. Following our surface organometallic strategy, the preparation and characterization of a homoleptic complex WMe6 supported on silica [(Si–O–)WMe5] 1 were recently disclosed by our group.61 was found to be an active efficient pre-catalyst for propane metathesis,6 higher molecular weight linear alkanes7 and cycloalkane metathesis.8 Herein we describe that it is not necessary to graft the organometallic complex and modify its coordination sphere by an appropriate treatment (thermal and/or under hydrogen) before doing catalysis: a simple addition of the precursor in the reaction medium containing the alkane and the addition of silica by a simple impregnation protocol are enough to observe alkane and cycloalkane metatheses (Chart 1). This catalytic procedure is easier to implement than the existing well defined single supported catalytic or dual catalytic systems in an industrial perspective. In this work, we report a straightforward procedure for cyclic and linear alkane metathesis transformation employing solely a fully alkylated complex, for instance a Wilkinson d0 WMe6 or Schrock type d0 W metal alkylidyne complex impregnated initially on PDS. The catalytic activity of such heterogeneous systems with unfunctionalized and functionalized olefins is also reported.
Chart 1 Conversion of cyclic or linear alkanes towards the corresponding higher and lower homologues by a (a) single multifunctional heterogeneous catalytic system (grafted initially on oxide); (b) dual homogeneous or heterogeneous catalytic system; (c) single multifunctional heterogeneous catalytic system (initial adsorption on the support).
We started our study by synthesizing a solution of WMe6 in n-decane, (0.00197 mmol mL−1) following the literature procedure.6 Running the catalytic reaction with exclusively this molecular organometallic solution at 150 °C for a 2 day period showed no apparent alkane metathesis products. However, initial addition of partially dehydroxylated silica (pretreated at 700 °C) (PDS700) into this organometallic solution under the same reaction conditions led to a mixture of lower and higher alkanes (Fig. 1). Moreover, employing a molecular solution of WMe6 in cyclooctane (0.046 mmol mL−1) in the presence of an initial amount of PDS700 also produced a distribution of higher molecular weight macrocyclic alkanes along with lower molecular weight cyclic alkanes resulting from ring contraction. In both cases (linear and cyclic alkane metathesis), the distribution of alkane products is similar to the one observed while starting with pre-catalyst 1 (see Fig. 1, for n-decane metathesis, see Fig. S1 for cyclooctane metathesis, ESI†). These results emphasize the crucial role of the oxide support in an active alkane metathesis system. In fact, it is well-known that in a homogeneous system these electron-deficient W complexes decompose into inactive species through dimerization processes.9 Thus, addition of silica would prevent such processes.
Fig. 1 GC chromatogram of (a) n-decane before reaction and (b) n-decane metathesis products, reaction catalyzed by a molecular solution of [WMe6] in decane (0.98 μmol, 1.97 μmol mL−1), n-decane (0.5 mL, 2.57 mmol), PDS700 (50 mg), 500 rpm, 150 °C, 2 days.
We found earlier that 1 is thermally transformed into its corresponding W(methyl)methylidyne species 2 at 150 °C by extensive solid state NMR studies (see Scheme S2, ESI†).6 Moreover, 2 was found to be an active catalyst precursor for the propane6 and cyclooctane metathesis8 as well as for alkyne cyclotrimerization.10 These previous reports highlighted that a silica supported W-carbyne moiety associated with a σ-ligand is crucial for the transformation of alkane metathesis. Thus, we envisage that employing commercially available Schrock type d0 W(tBuCH2)3WCCMe311 would be a better alternative organometallic precursor instead of highly volatile unstable homoleptic WMe6.12 The former possesses neopentyl/neopentylidyne groups, which could form W bis-alkylidene through α-proton migration observed in homogeneous systems.13,14 Such transformation has also been experimentally observed for supported W(methyl)methylidyne 2 in the presence of either an olefin or PMe3.15 Thus, to validate this hypothesis we initially prepared a silica supported W Schrock complex by stirring (tBuCH2)3WCCMe3 with PDS700.16 The metathesis activity of this silica supported complex Si–O–W(CCMe3)(CH2tBu)2 (3) was tested using cyclooctane and n-decane at 150 °C, for 3 days. Surprisingly, the results showed even better activity than pre-catalyst 1 (see Fig. S3, ESI†). After 72 h, an overall turnover number (TON) of 225 is obtained for cyclooctane metathesis catalyzed with 3 compared to 44 for 1. The product distribution showed shorter cyclic alkanes (cyclopentane, cyclohexane and cycloheptane) for pre-catalyst 3. n-Decane is also transformed into metathesis products using 3 with TONs of 136 (see Fig. S4, ESI†). This value is close to the one observed with catalyst 1. Replacement of the tris(neopentyl)neopentylidyne W complex by the tris(tert-butoxy) (tBuO)3WCCMe317 derivative gave no apparent activity in the n-decane metathesis. These bulky alkoxide ligands are known to prevent the bimolecular decomposition of the catalyst but nevertheless they are ineffective for the alkane metathesis.18 Encouraged by the activity observed for 3, we envisaged employing a one-pot protocol for this catalytic procedure. A molecular solution of the Schrock complex (tBuCH2)3WCCMe3 (19.8 μmol) in cyclooctane solution (3.72 mmol, 0.5 mL) (a W : alkane ratio of 1 : 188) and silica pretreated at 700 °C (50 mg) gave a gratifying distribution of cyclic alkanes; see Fig. 2 and Fig. S5 (ESI†) (“@” denotes that the W complex was not initially grafted on metal oxide but added in a one pot procedure).
Fig. 2 Cyclooctane metathesis catalyzed by a one-pot procedure with different supports. Reaction conditions: batch reactor, (tBuCH2)3WCCMe3 (8.9 mg, 19.8 μmol), cyclooctane (0.5 mL, 3.72 mmol) and surface oxide (50 mg), 500 rpm, 150 °C, 72 h.
Substituting PDS700 with other oxides (50 mg) that were partially dehydroxylated under high vacuum (<10−5 mbar) at different temperatures (such as silica pretreated at 200 °C, silica–alumina and γ-alumina pretreated at 500 °C) produce a similar distribution of cyclic alkanes (Fig. 2). In all these catalytic runs regardless of the nature of the oxide material, cyclooctane was transformed into a mixture of cyclic and macrocyclic alkanes albeit in lower activity than the initial PDS700. (It should be noted that the reaction conditions were not optimized for different oxide materials). The observed activity for γ-alumina oxide is not surprising because it has been previously shown that γ-alumina supported (tBuCH2)3WCCMe3 could catalyze the propane metathesis.19 To account for this activity, it was postulated that γ-alumina is responsible for the propane dehydrogenation step towards propene.20 However, these findings are not consistent with our experimental studies because 3 is also active for cyclooctane metathesis. Rather, olefin intermediates should be formed through the classical β–H elimination.21 The use of passivated silica support in which all proton silanol groups have been transformed into their corresponding methylated supported species showing the lowest catalytic activity for the cyclooctane metathesis. This result strongly supports that a W Schrock complex physisorbed on the surface is not sufficient to provide comparable catalytic activity but rather the organometallic precursor should be chemisorbed or grafted in situ. This implies that forming isolated Si–O–W linkages is necessary to achieve catalytic performance because it would lead to a supported organometallic species spaced apart from another W metal center.22 Comparing the catalytic activity between 3 and the one pot procedure under similar W : cyclooctane molar ratios at 150 °C showed better activity for 3. Obviously with species 3, bimolecular decomposition of the W neopentylidene complex is virtually non-existent on the oxide surface.23 Additionally, an improved catalytic activity of cyclooctane metathesis was observed while the reaction mixture was stirred at elevated temperatures (200 °C) producing a higher amount of cyclic alkane products (1.96 mmol compared to 0.2 mmol) under equal W : alkane molar ratios (see Fig. S6, ESI†).
Next, this catalytic procedure was extended to linear alkanes. n-Decane was converted into lower and higher homologues giving a similar distribution compared to the tandem dual catalytic system using the (POCOP)Ir (POCOP = resorcinolbisphosphinite) and Mo(NAr) (CHCMe2Ph)(ORF6)2 complex (Ar = (2,4,6)-i-PrC6H2, RF6 = O(CF3)2CH3).4
These observations are in contrast with the cyclooctane metathesis products in which the two different catalytic systems (single multifunctional and dual catalytic systems) differ dramatically (see Fig. S7, ESI†). Enhanced activity with this one pot protocol was also observed when the catalytic run is carried out at 200 °C for 3 days (Fig. 3).
Fig. 3 n-Decane metathesis products catalyzed by W Schrock@SiO2 reaction conditions: batch reactor, (tBuCH2)3WCCMe3 (8.9 mg, 19.8 μmol), n-decane (0.5 mL, 2.57 mmol) and SiO2 (50 mg), 500 rpm, 200 °C, 72 h.
To demonstrate the industrial potential of this catalytic procedure, we scaled up the reaction by a factor of 40. A solution of (tBuCH2)3WCCMe3 (300 mg) in cyclooctane (20 mL) in the presence of partially dehydroxylated silica pre-treated at 700 °C (2 g) was stirred and heated at 150 °C for a five day period. High selectivity for the formation of C16 cyclohexadecane was observed (>76% of total macrocyclic alkane products). To verify the reproducibility of these results, this catalytic run was repeated twice and gave similar results. This observed high selectivity for cyclohexadecane was attributed to the initial low conversion of cyclooctane. Indeed, previous work on kinetic studies of cyclooctane metathesis revealed that during the initial phase of the process (at low conversion), the dimer and the trimer macrocyclic alkanes are the predominant products (see Fig. 4).8 Such high selectivity of the dimer (C16) was observed for 12 hours during a catalytic run of cyclooctane (0.5 mL) catalyzed by [(Si–O–)WMe5] 1. We envisage that the mechanism of such molecular species adsorbed on solid supports should be similar to the one with defined catalyst 3. Thus, the formation of alkane products should involve a bis-carbene intermediate in an elementary step as previously described.7
Fig. 4 Cyclooctane metathesis products catalyzed by W Schrock@SiO2(700). Reaction conditions: batch reactor, (tBuCH2)3WCCMe3 (300 mg, 667 μmol), cyclooctane (20 mL, 148.8 mmol) and SiO2 (2 g), 500 rpm, 150 °C, 5 days. Formation of cyclic (C5–C7) and macrocyclic C12–C30 alkanes.
Finally, we found that this one pot protocol with a Schrock type d0 W metal alkylidyne complex is also active for the olefin metathesis. Indeed, 1-decene was converted into an equilibrium mixture of the C2–C30 terminal and internal olefins by successive isomerization and olefin metathesis (ISOMET), previously described for 1 (see Fig. S8, ESI†). 3 also catalyzes the ISOMET reaction of 1-decene, Fig. 5 and Fig. S9 (ESI†). This would suggest that metal alkylidyne solution in the presence of PDS700 reacts with olefins likely through a W bis-carbene intermediate.16,24,25 As it is generally assumed that high oxidation state W alkylidyne without pendant alkyl groups catalyzes alkyne metathesis and not olefin metathesis,26–28 our result thus demonstrates the importance of the alkyl groups in the W coordination sphere. Besides, replacing 1-decene with 1-decyne led predominantly to substituted tri-alkyl benzene products with tetra substituted benzene from a cyclotrimerization reaction.10 The formation of the latter would suggest the formation of 5-octadecyne resulting from the metathesis of 1-decyne as previously described (see Scheme S10, ESI†).
Fig. 5 1-Decene metathesis products catalyzed by W Schrock@SiO2 or 3. Reaction conditions: batch reactor, (tBuCH2)3WCCMe3 (8.9 mg, 19.8 μmol) and SiO2 (50 mg) or 3 (50 mg, 3.6 μmol, W loading: 3.36%), 1-decene (0.5 mL, 2.64 mmol), 500 rpm, 150 °C, 72 h.
This one pot protocol was also efficient in converting fatty acid esters (FAE) into their corresponding diesters. For instance, ethyl undecylenate and ethyl oleate produced their corresponding self-metathesis products. Interestingly, for ethyl oleate, the initial products of the cross metathesis between the neopentylidene W ligands and FAEs, neopentyl olefins were observed (in green, see Fig. S11, ESI†). These results are in agreement with the tertiary alkane products observed from the metathesis of propane in the presence of silica supported Ta, Re and Mo neopentylidene precatalysts.29 The formation of these olefins strongly supports a W bis-carbene intermediate from a silica supported W alkyl/alkylidyne species.
This work emphasizes the W single multifunctional character on metal oxide of this system and paves the way to the development of a novel family of catalysts for the alkane and olefin metathesis reaction. Future studies would aim to modify the W coordination sphere (direct alkylation from WCl6 for example) to enhance the catalytic activity of such a system. Following the successful work demonstrated by the silica immobilization of a second generation Hoveyda–Grubbs Ru catalyst,30–33 we also intend to study the feasibility of such a catalytic protocol in a continuous reactor.

We should point out that turnover numbers in the one pot procedure have no theoretical meaning. In this heterogeneous system, not every initial tungsten atom would form an active center. As the silica surface is amorphous and non-uniform, a low percentage of non-grafted W atoms would be probably inactive resulting from a bimolecular decomposition process
