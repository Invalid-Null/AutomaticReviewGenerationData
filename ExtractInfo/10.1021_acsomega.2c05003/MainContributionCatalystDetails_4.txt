The provided document describes the formulation and catalytic performance of ZSM-5 zeolite-based additives for the catalytic cracking of light hydrocarbon fractions (n-hexane and 3-methylpentane). It does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. The catalysts and processes examined in the paper are not directly related to converting propane to propylene.
