Highly active catalysts of mesoporous Ce-Cr-mAl2O3 and reaction mechanism for N2O-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene to styrene
The mesoporous Cr-mAl2O3 and Ce-Cr-mAl2O3 catalysts were prepared via a one-pot hydrothermal process for the N2O-assisted ethylbenzene (EB) selective oxidation to styrene, which was viewed as both a greenhouse recycling method and a new process for styrene (ST) production. It was found that 7Cr-mAl2O3 provided superior catalytic performance with respect to ST among Cr oxide-doped catalysts and that the Ce modification could further increase the ST yield to 54%. To clarify the promoting effect and mechanism of Ce-Cr species on catalytic performance, numerous types of characterization, particularly in-situ DRIFTS, were used. Results indicated that the favorable reducibility of catalyst was crucial for N2O activation. Carbon deposition was unavoidable during the reaction process, but adding Ce-Cr could reduce the stability of the deposited carbon and relief its detrimental effect on catalytic performance. The suitable surface acidity and high relative content of Cr6+ and Oα could be responsible for the excellent catalytic performance of Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3. In-situ DRIFTS not only identified the coupling effect between EB dehydrogenation and N2O decomposition but also proposed the possible reaction pathway that the adsorbed N2O reacted with the EB molecule, thereby providing a good explanation for the promoting effects of high content of N2O on the activity of Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3.
1. Introduction
The increased emission of greenhouse gases has significant negative effects on the global ecological environment and addressing this problem has been the subject of intensive research in recent years [1], [2]. Developing chemical processes that extend beyond traditional decompositions and repurpose exhaust gases for hydrocarbon conversion to valuable products is an attractive topic for catalysis and environmental research from the perspective of sustainable utilization, as it provides a practical method for mitigating these emissions and increasing commercial value. The chemical transformation of N2O, whose global warming potential (GWP) was 310 times and 21 times higher than that of CO2 and CH4 respectively [3], has received considerably less attention than the reactions that convert CH4 and CO2 into valuable organics via catalytic strategies [4], [5]. Since the rapid development of industrialization, the N2O concentration has increased at a rate of 0.2–0.3% per year, making it imperative to reduce N2O emissions and develop new technologies.
Styrene, an essential monomer for the production of polymers, was primarily produced by dehydrogenating ethylbenzene over a Fe-K-based catalyst in superheated steam [6], [7]. However, the low yield of styrene due to the thermodynamic limit of the endothermic reaction, the high energy consumption, and the deposition of dehydrogenated carbonaceous species were still issues with this process. Therefore, there is a high demand for developing alternative technologies for the economic and effective ethylbenzene dehydrogenation process. The oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene (ODEB), which could shift the equilibrium to the product side, improve product selectivity, and extend the life of the catalyst, has been the subject of intensive research in recent years and represents a promising alternative to the commercial process.
Extensive research has been conducted on using O2 as an oxidant for the oxidative dehydrogenation of ethylbenzene. Despite the absence of detrimental thermodynamic limitations and lower operating temperatures during O2-ODEB, there are still issues with the over-oxidation of alkenes to carbon oxides, resulting in inefficient use of the reactant and low product selectivity [8], [9]. CO2 was identified as a suitable oxidant for ODEB process because its weak oxidation could prevent the over oxidation of EB, which also provided a greenhouse gas conversion approach for the global carbon balance. Wide range of catalysts including iron oxide [6], [10], Ce-Zr solid solutions [11], spinel oxides [12] and Heteropolycompounds [13] were explored to get higher EB conversion and ST selectivity for the CO2-ODEB process. Additionally, N2O was also a promising alternative because its single O-atom donor might have stronger oxidation than CO2 [14], which has been successfully applied in the oxidation of benzene to phenol [15] and the oxidation of light paraffins to olefins [16], [17]. Recently, it was discovered that N2O could also oxidize CH4, methanol, and propene to oxy-organics [14], [18]. However, in a small number of researches which employed the VOx/γ-Al2O3 [19], mesoporous silica material (SBA-15, MCF, MCM-18, and MSU) [20], and hydrotalcite-derived compounds [21] as catalysts for N2O-ODEB process, the results were not very satisfied because of the low ST yield and high reaction temperatures.
So, it was worthwhile to develop high-performance catalysts for the EB dehydrogenation process using N2O as the oxidant, which not only opened a new avenue for the production of styrene but also mitigated the environmental threat posed by N2O emission. In this work, mesoporous ceria-chromium-alumina oxides were prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal method and applied to catalyze the oxidation of EB to styrene with N2O as the oxidant, which exhibited superior EB conversion and good ST selectivity compared with the previously reported catalysts. The effects of Cr and Ce on EB conversion and ST selectivity were investigated. The techniques such as BET, SEM, TEM, and XPS were used to characterize the physicochemical properties of catalysts. In addition, in situ DRIFTS was employed to investigate the underlying mechanism of N2O-ODEB in order to provide a theoretical basis for the utilization of N2O in the dehydrogenation of EB to styrene.
2. Experimental procedures
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The mesoporous Cr-Al2O3 catalysts with the molar ratio of CrAl = 5, 7, 10, 15, were prepared by a one-pot hydrothermal method, employing aluminum iso-propoxide and Cr(NO3)3·9 H2O as precursors. The preparation procedure was referred to our previous report [19]. The obtained catalyst was labeled as xCr-mAl2O3, where x was the molar ratio of Cr to Al. On the basis of 7Cr-mAl2O3 sample, a Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 catalyst using Ce(NO3)3·6 H2O as precursor (the molar ratio of Ce/Cr=0.1) was synthesized by the same method.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The textural properties of the samples were tested by a nitrogen adsorption apparatus (ASAP 2020, Micromeritics) at − 196 °C, and their specific surface area was calculated by BET formula. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted via a MSXD-3 diffractometer with CuKα radiation. The spectra were collected in the range of 10° ∼ 80° with a step size of 2°. The morphology of catalyst was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEM-2010) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100 F). Temperature-programmed reduction of H2 (H2-TPR) and the temperature-programmed desorption of NH3 (NH3-TPD) were all carried out via an AutoChem II 2920 chemisorption analyzer. The consumed H2 or desorbed NH3 was monitored with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). TG-DTG analysis of the spent catalysts was conducted by a Netzsch STA 409 equipment, and each sample was heated in air from RT to 800 °C with a rate of 10°·min−1. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was performed on a Thermo Fisher ESCALAB Xi+ spectrometer equipped with Al Kα (hv=1486.6 eV) radiation. The binding energy was calibrated by referencing C1s peak at 284.6 eV. In-situ DRIFTS experiments were carried out on a Bruker INVENIO spectrometer, equipped with a diffuse reflectance cell (PIKE) containing a MCT detector. The sample was pretreated in Ar at 500 °C for 30 min in the cell, and then the background spectrum under Ar flow was recorded. The sample was exposed to a controlled flow of NO/EB/N2O/Ar (50 mL·min-1). The absorption and reaction spectra were recorded at a resolution of 4 cm-1 and 64 scans.
2.3. Catalytic activity test
The reaction was carried out at 500 °C in a fixed-bed reactor (8.5 mm i.d.×240 mm long) under atmospheric pressure, containing 1.5 g of catalyst with 40–60 mesh. EB was fed into the reactor at a rate of 0.5 mL·h-1 via a bubbler setup, and N2O (N2O/EB=3, molar ratio) and Ar (balance gas) were introduced by mass flow controllers. The total gas flow rate was 150 mL·min-1. The products were analyzed by a gas chromatography (GC-2010 plus, Shimadzu), equipped with thermal conductivity detector (TCD) and flame ionization detector (FID). EB conversion, ST selectivity and N2O conversion were calculated as follows.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalytic performance
As shown in Fig. 1, catalysts were evaluated for the N2O-ODEB process at 500 ºC. Despite a high ST selectivity, the pristine mAl2O3 exhibited poor activity at the tested temperature, with only 23% conversion of EB. The addition of Cr into mAl2O3 exhibited a remarkable catalytic performance-enhancing effect. Over the 5Cr-mAl2O3 catalyst, EB conversion was increased significantly to 59%, while ST selectivity was decreased to 62%. Both EB conversion and ST selectivity increased as Cr loading increased to 7%, at which point the EB conversion was 67%, and the ST selectivity was 75%, resulting in a high ST yield of 50%. Increasing the Cr loading from 10% to 15% resulted in minor fluctuations in EB conversion and ST selectivity, leading to a decreasing trend in ST yield. Based on the optimum activity of 7Cr-mAl2O3, the influence of Ce modification was investigated. As anticipated, the EB conversion and ST selectivity of the Ce-Cr-mAl2O3 catalyst showed an improvement to some extent, with the ST yield rising to 54%, which had a great potential for the oxidative dehydrogenation of EB in comparison with the previously reported catalysts (Table S1 in Supplementary). This result indicated that a synergistic effect between Ce and Cr species could facilitate the N2O-ODEB process. In addition, the coupling effect of N2O decomposition and EB dehydrogenation was studied; the results are depicted in Fig. 1(b). In the absence of EB, the pure mAl2O3 support exhibited a low activity for N2O decomposition, and N2O conversion did not exceed 5% at 500 oC. N2O was not completely decomposed on the catalysts, which became more pronounced with adding Co and Ce species. Intriguingly, the addition of EB refined this process, and nearly 30% of N2O was converted. In addition, the coupling effect was amplified by the presence of Cr species, and the N2O conversion increased with an increase in Cr content up to 7%, after which the N2O conversion reached 100% (The N2O conversions of 7Cr-mAl2O3, 10Cr-mAl2O3, 15Cr-mAl2O3, and Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 were 100%, so that the curves overlapped and looked like only one curve). Based on these results, it can be concluded that N2O decomposition and EB dehydrogenation occurred simultaneously on the catalyst surface and that the coupling effect greatly increased the conversion of both reactions, during which the active oxygen species produced by N2O decomposition were consumed, and the EB was dehydrogenated to produce ST.

3.2. Textural properties
To investigate the textural properties of the catalysts, N2 adsorption-desorption was measured, and the results are shown in Fig. 2. The mesoporous structure of pure mAl2O3 was characterized by IV isotherm curves with H2 hysteresis loops and a pore size distribution ranging from 5 nm to 20 nm. Due to the blockage of slit pores by Cr species, the adsorption volume and pore sizes of Cr-doped mAl2O3 decreased rapidly. Table 1 lists the BET surface area, pore volume, and mean pore size of the samples. It was observed that mAl2O3 had the highest surface area of 196.7 m2·g-1, corresponding to a pore volume of 0.55 cm3·g-1. With the addition of Cr species, the surface area of the 5%−15% Cr-doped catalysts decreased to 193.4, 187.6, 175.4, and 173.5 m2·g-1, respectively. The pore volume followed the same trend. Additional loading of Ce species had little effect on the textural characteristics. In conjunction with the activity results, it was possible to conclude that, although a large surface area was advantageous to the catalytic performance, it was not the primary factor and was likely influenced by other chemical aspects.

The XRD patterns of the catalysts are depicted in Fig. 3. In the pure mAl2O3, there were no sharp diffraction peaks, indicating its amorphous structure. Due to the low Cr content and high dispersion of Cr oxide in the catalyst, no Cr-related diffraction peaks appeared when the Cr loading was 5% and 7%. In 10Cr-mAl2O3, weak diffraction peaks at 24.8°, 34.1° and 36.5°, corresponding to the (012), (104), and (110) lattice planes of Cr2O3 (PDF#38–1479), were detected. With an increase in Cr content, the diffraction peaks became more pronounced. In addition, no Ce oxide signal was observed in Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 due to the low Ce content.

Fig. 4 displays the SEM and TEM images of various catalysts. Al2O3 has smaller particles that are distributed uniformly. With the addition of Cr/Ce, the morphology of the catalyst changed little, but a few particles expanded and sintered. The TEM images estimated the particle sizes of the mAl2O3, 7Cr-mAl2O3, and Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 to be approximately 8 nm, 9 nm, and 13 nm, respectively. No Al-species lattice fringes were detected in mAl2O3, indicating its amorphous phase. In the 7Cr-mAl2O3 catalyst, well-defined lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 0.201 nm were observed, corresponding to the (110) crystal phase of Cr2O3. In addition, lattice fringes with a d-spacing of 0.191 nm were detected in the Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 catalyst, which was attributed to the (004) crystal plane of CeO2, indicating that the cerium was not embedded in the Al2O3 structure, but instead appeared as CeO2 in the catalyst.

3.3. H2-TPR analysis
H2-TPR experiments were conducted to examine the reduction behavior of catalysts. As shown in Fig. 5, no reduction peak was observed in the mAl2O3. For the Cr-doped samples, a broad peak was observed between 285 ºC and 472 ºC, which could be attributed to the reduction of isolated Cr6+ [20], [21] since Cr3+ was difficult to reduce by H2 [22]. Compared to the reduction temperature (367 °C) of the 5Cr-mAl2O3 catalyst, the 7Cr-mAl2O3 catalyst exhibited a significant shift to a lower temperature (360 ºC). This suggested that the bond energy of Cr-O was weakened due to the strong interaction between Cr oxide and the support, and that the redox process in 7Cr-mAl2O3 could occur more easily, which provided a significant boost to N2O decomposition, as documented in references [19], [23]. Thus, it was possible to conclude that the good reducibility of 7Cr-mAl2O3 contributed to the formation of active oxygen, thereby promoting EB oxidation. On this basis, adding Ce could further enhance the reducibility of the catalyst, resulting in a lower reduction temperature at 353 ºC, which corresponds well with the excellent catalytic performance of Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3. Furthermore, the reductive peak area was integrated and presented in Table S2. It could be found that the peak area was increased with the increase of the Cr content, meaning more Cr6+ species were formed on the catalyst surface, and the area decreased when the Cr loading exceeded 10%. Under the influence of Ce, the reductive peak area of Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 decreased slightly, which might be related to the decreasing Cr content due to the Ce addition (keeping the total amount of catalyst unchanged).

3.4. TGA analysis
As a typical oxidative dehydrogenation reaction, carbonaceous deposits on the catalyst surface were unavoidable during the N2O-ODEB due to the pyrolysis and condensation of reactant/product molecules, which could obstruct the pores of the catalyst and cover the active sites, resulting in catalyst deactivation. After the reaction, the catalyst was analyzed by TG to determine the carbon deposition on its surface. As depicted in Fig. 6, when the spent catalyst was calcined in air flow, all samples experienced a significant weight loss between 100 ºC and 500 ºC. The slight decline of the curve below 200 ºC was attributed to the loss of adsorbed water, while the subsequent sharp decline between 300 ºC and 500 ºC was attributed to carbon combustion. On pure mAl2O3, a weight loss of 5.8% was detected despite the low conversion of EB. After 5% Cr loading, 9.3% weight loss was observed, indicating that the Cr species exacerbated carbon accumulation.

Moreover, with increasing Cr content, a weight loss of 10.1%, 11.2%, and 12.6% was observed for 7Cr-mAl2O3, 10Cr-mAl2O3, and 15Cr-mAl2O3, respectively. Despite the increased catalytic activity, adding Ce increased weight loss from 10.1% to 11.8% when compared to 7Cr-mAl2O3. The results indicated that carbon deposition was unavoidable during the reaction process and that improved catalytic performance did not necessarily result in less carbon deposition. Conversely, the formed carbon on the catalyst surface was not always a negative factor, as it was oxidized to generate oxygen-containing groups, thereby creating new active sites for the oxidation dehydrogenation reaction [24]. In addition, the DTG curves were presented in the figure to determine the carbon's stability. It was observed that mAl2O3 has the highest combustion temperature; after Cr loading, the temperature decreased by approximately 40 ºC. The increase in Cr content decreased the combustion temperature further. Clearly, the stability of the deposited carbon was degraded, and it was likely to be burned off by reacting with oxygen species, mitigating the carbon's detrimental effect on catalytic performance.
3.5. NH3-TPD
It was widely acknowledged that the acidity of the catalyst's surface played a crucial role in oxidation dehydrogenation reactions. Utilizing NH3-TPD, the effect of an active component on the surface acidity of catalysts was investigated. As shown in Fig. 7, two distinct peaks appeared in the range of 90 ºC-250 ºC and 300 ºC-700 ºC, corresponding to the moderate and strong acidic sites on the catalyst surface. It was widely believed that the C-H bond could be readily activated at moderately acidic sites, thereby facilitating the dehydrogenation of EB into ST. While C-C bond activation was more likely to occur at strong acid sites, the resulting dealkylation or ring-opening reactions exacerbated carbon deposition [24]. Using integration, the acid content of the catalysts was estimated and summarized in Table 2. Pure mAl2O3 has a relatively high acidity of 0.88 mmol·g−1 due to its naturally occurring acidity. It was observed that the surface acidity of the catalyst changed after the addition of Cr species and that more moderate acidic sites and fewer strong acid sites appeared as the Cr content increased from 5% to 10%, which was advantageous for EB dehydrogenation. However, the strong acid sites of 15Cr-mAl2O3 began to increase, resulting in a decline in catalytic activity. Ce could increase the moderate acidic sites from 0.19 mmol·g−1 of 7Cr-mAl2O3 to 0.32 mmol·g−1 of Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3. In addition, the desorption temperature was found to decrease by approximately 15 ºC. The superior performance of the Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 catalysts may be resulted from the interactions between Ce and Cr species, which led to greater defects.

3.6. XPS analysis
XPS was utilized to determine the surface components and chemical state of the catalysts. The XPS spectra of Cr 2p and O1s were shown in Fig. 8. In the Cr 2p spectra (Fig. 8(a)), two prominent characteristic peaks appeared at approximately 578 eV and 587 eV, which correspond to Cr 2p3/2 and Cr2p1/2. After deconvolution, each spectrum could be divided into two distinct peaks. The low binding energy at 576 eV and 586 eV belonged to tetrahedral Cr3+, whereas the high binding energy at 580 eV and 588 eV belonged to octahedral Cr6+ [25]. According to the literatures [20], [26], Cr3+-oxide played a more prominent role than Cr6+-oxide in oxidative dehydrogenation. Table 3 evaluates the molar ratios of Cr6+/(Cr6++Cr3+) on the catalysts. For lower Cr loadings of 5–7%, the Cr6+-oxide content rose from 52.36% to 53.56%. As the Cr loading was increased, the ratio gradually decreased, and Cr3+ became the predominant species in the catalyst. In conjunction with the catalytic activity of the catalysts, the EB dehydrogenation reaction benefited from the presence of more active sites of Cr6+-oxide. In comparison to 7Cr-mAl2O3, the addition of Ce species led to a further increase of Cr6+/(Cr6++Cr3+) ratio to 54.3% in Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3. This was due to the unique oxygen storage/release capacity of Ce oxide, which facilitated the oxidation of Cr3+ and contributed to the enhanced catalytic performance.

Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 54.30 60.05
The O1s spectra of the catalysts are displayed in Fig. 8(b). By performing a peak fitting deconvolution, three characteristic peaks at approximately 530.2 eV, 531.2 eV, and 532.3 eV were detected, which could be attributed to the surface lattice oxygen(Oβ), surface adsorbed oxygen (Oα), and the adsorbed oxygen from -OH or H2O (Oγ), respectively [22], [27]. Oα was believed to be advantageous in the oxidation dehydrogenation reaction because, in addition to promoting the dehydrogenation process by reacting with H-H, it could consume a certain amount of unstable carbon deposits and prevent carbon accumulation [28], [29]. The proportion of Oα to the total oxygen species (Oα +Oβ +Oγ) was calculated in Table 3. It was noted that the relative ratio of Oα/(Oα +Oβ +Oγ) was greatly enhanced from 42.29% to 50.13% when 5%Cr oxide was loaded on the mAl2O3, suggesting the interaction between active component and support could induce extra surface vacancies to activate oxygen. As increasing the Cr content, the Oα/(Oα +Oβ +Oγ) ratio first increased then decreased, agreeing well with the change trend of activity. It was worth noting that the Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 possessed a higher content of Oα than 7Cr-mAl2O3, and this was because that the charge balance among elements created more oxygen vacancies. In addition, the O1s spectra of Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 catalyst shifted a lower value of about 0.2 eV, implying that the Cr6+-O bond was weakened, which benefited to improve the mobility of active oxygen and promote the oxidation of EB. All these could be responsible for the high catalytic of Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 catalyst.
3.7. In situ DRIFTS studies
According to the documents [10], [29], active oxygen species resulted from the decomposition of N2O played a crucial role in oxidation dehydrogenation. However, Fig. 1(b) demonstrated that N2O was not decomposed on the Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 catalyst in the absence of EB unless EB was fed into the reactor. Therefore, it can be concluded that a coupling effect existed between the decomposition of N2O and the dehydrogenation of EB.
In order to investigate this possibility, the formation mechanism of active oxygen species on the Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 catalyst surface was investigated using NO as a probe molecule for in-situ DRIFTS. As depicted in Fig. 9, the pure Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 catalyst was pretreated in Ar for 30 min prior to adding NO to the react cell. Since NO was barely adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst, only a few weak peaks were observed at 1588 cm-1, 1392 cm-1, and 1185 cm-1, which were attributed to the bidentate nitrate, nitrate species, and NO- species, respectively [30], [31], [32]. The curve of b represents NO adsorption on Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 that has been pretreated with N2O. In accordance with the absorption results of pure N2O, typical N2O absorption peaks were observed at 1302 cm-1 and 1270 cm-1, corresponding to nitro compounds and monodentate nitrates [33] (Fig. 11). In addition, the absorption bands at 1420 cm-1 and 1560 cm-1 suggested the formation of monodentate nitrates as a result of NO and N2O co-adsorption [33], [34]. Intriguingly, for the NO adsorption on the Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 surface that had been pretreated with EB+N2O (the c curve), two new absorption peaks at 1622 cm-1 and 1478 cm-1 were detected, which were attributed to the NO2 molecules that had been adsorbed [35], [36]. This meant that active oxygen species existed on the surface of the catalyst and could interact with NO to form NO2. Typically, the active oxygen species originated from the dissociation of N2O. Considering that NO2 species were not detected on the Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 pretreated by N2O, the active oxygen species could not have been produced without EB, and a coupling effect must exist between N2O decomposition and EB dehydrogenation, providing strong support for the results of Fig. 1(b). Based on these findings, a simple reaction scheme could be speculated. The EB molecules were activated by Cr6+-O species and dehydrogenated to produce H-H, which subsequently reacted with oxygen species to generate H2O and oxygen vacancy (Eq. 1). By coupling of N2O decomposition, the redox sites were recovered to Cr6+-O, and meanwhile the oxygen vacancy was replenished (Eq. 2). Cerium oxide played a role as a bridge to enhance catalytic performance, which was more conducive to donate an oxygen atom to the oxygen vacancy owing to its good oxygen storage/release capacity, and the remaining oxygen vacancy was recovered by N2O, thereby completing the catalytic recycle ((3), (4)).

To examine the reaction process, in-situ DRIFTS of the reaction were performed at 500 °C over a pretreated Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 catalyst. As shown in Fig. 10(a), Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 was initially exposed to EB/Ar for 30 min, followed by 10 min of Ar purging. The N2O was then introduced into the reaction cell, and the time-dependent spectra were recorded. The band was observed at 1600 cm-1 and 1063 cm-1, which corresponded to the C-C stretching modes of the aromatic ring [37], and the strong band at 1180 cm-1 was attributed to the C-H deformation of the aromatic ring [38]. With the addition of N2O, the N2O peaks were visible at the band of 1302 cm-1 and 1270 cm-1, and the absorption intensity increased gradually over time. However, no change was observed at the 1180 cm-1 and 1073 cm-1 bands. All of these indicated that the adsorbed EB could not react with the gas N2O. Fig. 10(b) displayed spectra that the reactants were introduced in reverse order. After N2O adsorption and Ar purging, two distinct bands corresponding to nitro compounds and monodentate nitrates were detected at wavelengths of 1302 cm-1 and 1270 cm-1. When EB was introduced, N2O quickly disappeared. Simultaneously, the C-C stretching modes of the aromatic ring appeared at 1063 cm-1. In addition, a new band appeared at 1161 cm-1, which was attributed to the overlap of bands of C−H bending and C−H deformation of the aromatic ring [38]. Compared to the band at 1180 cm-1 in Fig. 10(a), the band at 1161 cm-1 may be associated with the intermediate species produced by the reaction of adsorbed N2O and EB. This band displayed a rise-fall pattern as time passed, indicating that the N2O adsorbed on the catalyst surface was gradually consumed. Apparently, the reaction between the adsorbed N2O and EB was a viable route for the oxidation dehydrogenation of EB using N2O as the oxidant.

To further investigate the promotion mechanism of various catalysts, in-situ DRIFTS of N2O adsorption were conducted over mAl2O3, 7Cr-mAl2O3, and Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3, respectively. Each catalyst was treated with Ar for 30 min prior to the addition of N2O to the reaction cell. The spectra of absorption are recorded as a function of time. As shown in Fig. 11, the N2O adsorption appeared difficult on the mAl2O3 catalyst. When the gas was introduced for 10 min, the bands of N2O at 1302 cm-1 and 1270 cm-1 were detected, while the absorption intensity after 30 min was relatively weak. Cr loading significantly enhanced N2O adsorption, which may be attributable to altered physicochemical properties. The N2O absorption bands appeared almost immediately, and absorption intensity increased over time. The optimum catalytic performance of Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 catalysts corresponds to the highest N2O absorption intensity after 30 min compared to the other two catalysts.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a series of mesoporous Ce-Cr-mAl2O3 oxides were prepared as a novel catalyst for EB dehydrogenation in the presence of N2O. Evaluation of activity revealed that desirable physicochemical properties of the catalyst could be obtained by adjusting the Cr content and that the Ce modification could further improve the catalytic performance, resulting in a 54% ST yield. The characterization results revealed that Al2O3 possessed an amorphous structure and that CeO2 was highly dispersed on the surface of the catalyst. The good reducibility of the Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 catalyst may help form more active oxygen species to promote the oxidation dehydrogenation of EB, and the weakened stability of deposited carbon may be related to the altered surface acidity, which was advantageous for mitigating the detrimental effect of deposited carbon on catalytic performance. In addition, the increasing Cr6+ and Oα content with the addition of Ce played significant roles in enhancing catalytic performance. In-situ DRIFTS revealed the coupling effect between EB dehydrogenation and N2O decomposition, and demonstrated that the reaction of the adsorbed N2O and EB was an efficient pathway for the oxidation dehydrogenation reaction, which corresponded to the high catalytic performance of Ce-7Cr-mAl2O3 with a greater amount of the adsorbed N2O on the catalyst surface.
