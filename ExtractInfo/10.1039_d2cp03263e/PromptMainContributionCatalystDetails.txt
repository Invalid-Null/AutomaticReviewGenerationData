Revealing the promotion of carbonyl groups on vacancy stabilized Pt4/nanocarbons for propane dehydrogenation†
Nanocarbons are promising supports for Pt clusters applied in propane dehydrogenation (PDH), owing to their large surface areas and tunable chemical properties. The vacancies and oxygen-containing groups (OCGs) in nanocarbons can enhance catalytic performance by tailoring the coordination environment of Pt clusters. Herein, 46 nanocarbons with coexisting vacancies and OCGs were designed to support Pt clusters, of which the influences on PDH were revealed by density functional theory calculations. Nanocarbons with divacancies (V2) and CO edge groups were screened out as the most appropriate support for Pt clusters in PDH. Due to the V2, tetrahedral Pt clusters were distorted into three-layered configurations, contributing to enhanced binding strength and a favorable reactive pathway starting from the methylene group in propane. This changed the rate-determining step to the first C–H bond scission with a low energy barrier. The introduction of CO edge groups coexisting with V2 further improved the stabilization of Pt clusters, resulting from the increased electron transfer from Pt atoms to C atoms. The abilities to break C–H bonds and inhibit C–C bond cracking were also enhanced as compared to the nanocarbons with only V2. Therefore, this work provides references on the regulation of vacancies and OCGs in carbon-based catalysts.
1. Introduction
Propylene is recognized as an essential precursor chemical of acrolein, acetone, propylene oxide and other industrial products.1 The ever-increasing demand for propylene is hardly met by traditional processes, necessitating the exploration of alternative technologies to close the product-demand gap. Propane dehydrogenation (PDH) has become one of the hotspots for propylene production, as a result of shale gas discovery.2 The commercial catalysts in PDH are noble Pt-based catalysts due to their affinity to the C–H bond in propane.3 The latest focus on the catalyst design is downsizing the Pt nanoparticles to clusters or even single atoms.4 The subnanometric Pt clusters can achieve maximum atomic utilization, reduce the active sites for side reactions and enhance propylene desorption.5–7 Nevertheless, Pt clusters are prone to agglomeration or sintering at the high temperature of PDH (>550 °C), owing to the relative high surface free energies. Therefore, maintaining the stability of Pt clusters remains a challenge, which can be overcome by finding appropriate anchoring supports.
Nanocarbons (such as graphene, carbon nanoribbons and nanodiamonds) have emerged as competitive supports to stabilize metal clusters, with the merits of high specific surface area and tunable chemical properties.8–13 Vacancy engineering in nanocarbons is an effective method to prevent the metal clusters from migrating, correlating with the electron localization and geometric disturbance around the vacancies.14 Zheng et al.15 adopted the acid-treated carbon nanotubes with rich vacancies to anchor Pt atoms. The TOF decreased by only 28% for the carbon nanotubes with rich vacancies at 600 °C for 20 h, lower than those with poor vacancies during the stability test of PDH. In the works of Liu's group, they synthesized core–shell nanodiamond@graphene hybrid supports to anchor Pt nanoparticles or clusters for alkane dehydrogenation.5,8,16–18 The results showed that Pt clusters would bind strongly with the C atoms around vacancies, thus enhancing the interaction between Pt clusters and supports. Meanwhile, our previous theoretical work19 systemically designed carbon materials with various vacancies to anchor the Pt single atom for PDH. Electrons would localize around vacancies, which restricted the coalescence of the Pt atom. The vacancies can provide anchored sites for metal species and strengthen the metal–support interaction (MSI), which has become the vital research orientation of the carbon-based catalysts with enhanced stability.
Furthermore, oxygen functionality in nanocarbons is another method to regulate the coordination environment of metal clusters to maintain their stability.20 Different types of OCGs have been adopted to anchor the metal species. Qin et al.21 introduced in-plane epoxy groups as anchoring sites for subnanometric Pt and revealed that the epoxy groups endowed the deposited Pt species with uniformity, controllability and stability. Lu's group22 adopted phenol–carbonyl pairs as nucleation sites to synthesize the Pt dimer. They found that the phenol–carbonyl groups had strong interaction with the graphene support and thus inhibited the aggressive aggregation of the Pt dimer to larger metal NPs. Chen et al.23 found that OCGs could enhance the MSI, which stemmed from the charge transfer rather than the frontier–orbital hybridization. Thus, tailoring the OCGs in nanocarbons can effectively strengthen catalytic stability. Adopting the oxygen functionality based on vacancy engineering in nanocarbons is deserved to be researched owing to the “synergistic promotion” produced by these two methods. Although the promotion of OCGs has been proved, the specific mechanism of the co-existence between OCGs and vacancies to the catalytic behavior still remains open. Exploring the promotion of OCGs on nanocarbons with vacancies is indispensable to further improve the catalytic properties of carbon-based catalysts.
In this work, we designed carbon nanoribbons with vacancies and OCGs to support Pt clusters and explored the promotion of these catalysts on PDH in light of density functional theory (DFT). First, the binding energies of Pt clusters anchored on carbon nanoribbons were calculated. The results were combined with the activation barriers of the C–H bond cleavage in methane to initially screen out the most promising catalyst among 46 catalysts. Subsequently, the chosen catalyst was applied in PDH to further analyze the effect of the promotion of OCGs and co-existing vacancies on catalytic properties. We calculated the adsorption energies of propane and propylene, activation barriers and reaction energies of the elementary steps involved in PDH to deeply understand the controllable behaviors of vacancies and OCGs toward the catalytic activity, selectivity and coke-resistance. Finally, the theoretic results were connected with extant experiment to verify the reliability in this work.
2. Computational methods
All the spin-polarized DFT calculations were performed using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).24,25 Projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials were employed to describe the interaction between ionic cores and valence electrons.26,27 The exchange–correlation effects were considered by generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) formalism,28,29 and a plane-wave basis with a 400 eV cut-off was adopted for convergence. Carbon nanoribbons with zigzag edge (ZNR) and armchair edge (ANR) were adopted to model vacancies and OCGs. The x, y, z dimensions of ZNR were 25.00 × 12.33 × 15.00 Å, and the periodic condition was employed along the y direction. A 2 × 4 × 1 Γ-centered k-point mesh was adopted for Brillouin zone sampling in ZNR. The Γ-centered k-point mesh of ANR with 12.82 × 25.00 × 15.00 Å was 4 × 2 × 1, and the x direction was used under the periodic condition. Four Pt atoms were modelled to represent the Pt clusters anchored on carbon nanoribbons.30,31 All atoms were allowed to relax during the geometric optimization with the convergence criteria for a residual force of 0.02 eV Å−1. The tolerance of electronic relaxation was set to be e−5 eV. Meanwhile, DFT-D3 was used to correct the van der waals correlation,32 and the transition states were searched using the climbing image-nudged elastic band (CI-NEB).33 During the PDH, the adsorption energies of propane and propylene were calculated using eqn (1):
Eads = Eadsorbates/catalysts − Eadsorbates − Ecatalysts (1)
where Eadsorbates/catalysts is the total energy of adsorbates (propane and propylene) adsorbed on the catalyst surface; Eadsorbates and Ecatalysts are the energies of adsorbates and the catalyst. The activation barriers are calculated by the difference between transition states and initial states in the CI-NEB.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Initial assessment of carbon nanoribbons with vacancies and OCGs
3.1.1 Stability of Pt clusters anchored on carbon nanoribbons A total of 46 carbon nanoribbons with different vacancies and OCGs were considered for the initial assessment and were designed based on relative experimental characterizations and theoretical models.10,23,34–36 In particular, seven types of OCGs (CO edge, CO defect, OH, C–O–C, COOH, anhydride and quinone groups) and H atoms were adopted to saturate the edges (zigzag edge (ZNR) and armchair edge (ANR)) in carbon nanoribbons, as shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†). Owing to the huge formation energies of large-sized vacancies,37 mono-vacancies (V1) and divacancies (V2) were adopted to modulate the intrinsic defects in carbon nanoribbons.
The binding strength between Pt clusters and carbon nanoribbons was an indicator of catalytic stability. In Fig. S3 (ESI†), two binding modes of Pt4 were taken into account, of which the tetrahedral Pt was placed on the carbon nanoribbon in the top or bottom mode. The optimized configurations of Pt4 anchored on carbon nanoribbons are displayed in Fig. S4 and S5 (ESI†), and the equation of the binding energies is listed in eqn (S1) (ESI†). Fig. 1(a) displays the binding energies of Pt clusters anchored on carbon nanoribbons in the favorable anchored mode. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the absolute values of binding energies were increased after introducing the vacancies in pristine carbon nanoribbons. The increased binding energies were beneficial to prevent the metal clusters from agglomeration and coalescence. Based on the positive effect of vacancies towards catalytic stabilization, functionalizing the carbon nanoribbons by OCGs could further improve the binding strength of Pt clusters. In Fig. 1(b), the relative binding energies (Erb) of Pt clusters anchored on carbon nanoribbons with OCGs compared to those without OCGs are displayed to evaluate the effects of OCGs toward the binding strength. The more positive Erb represented the stronger stabilized ability induced by OCGs. Obviously, the Erb values of Pt clusters anchored on carbon nanoribbons with anhydride and quinone groups were all positive, leading to the strongest ability to keep Pt clusters stable, and the followings were CO edge and OH groups. The C–O–C groups showed excellent stabilized ability to the metal clusters only when the vacancy type was V2. Meanwhile, the introduction of carboxyl groups and carbonyl groups in the defect sites showed hazardous influence on catalytic stabilization. Therefore, by comparing the binding energies of Pt clusters anchored on carbon nanoribbons without OCGs, it was found that only introducing specific OCGs (anhydride, quinone, CO edge and OH groups) to coexist with vacancies could further enhance the interaction between metal clusters and supports.

3.1.2 Ability to C–H bond cleavage Assessing the ability to break the C–H bond in alkane could furnish reference to explore excellent dehydrogenated catalysts. Methane, the simplest alkane molecule, was always adopted as a probe molecule to evaluate the ability of C–H activation.38 Table S1 (ESI†) lists the energy barriers and reaction energies of the C–H bond breaking in methane catalyzed by all 46 catalysts. Compared with pristine carbon nanoribbons, the introduction of vacancies effectively decreased the activation barriers of C–H bond scission from 0.19 eV in Pt4/PZNR to 0.12 eV in Pt4/V2ZNR. Instead of promoting the cleavage of the C–H bond, CO defect groups in V1ZNR and V2ZNR increased the activation barriers of C–H bond breaking from 0.18 eV and 0.12 eV to 0.47 eV and 0.43 eV, respectively. The promotion of vacancies to C–H bond scission was restricted by CO defect groups, which in the same way applied to the C–O–C, COOH and anhydride groups. Only the CO edge, OH and quinone groups could further enhance the cleavage of C–H bonds on the basis of vacancies, decreasing the activation barriers of C–H bond breaking by 0.01 eV to 0.10 eV.
Overall, vacancy engineering could not only strengthen the MSI but also facilitate the C–H bond cleavage in alkane molecules. On the basis of vacancies, specified OCGs (CO edge, OH and quinone groups) further enhanced the catalytic stability and affinity to the C–H bond. Therefore, the CO edge, OH and quinone groups were deserved to be introduced at the co-existence of vacancies. Before employing in PDH, the most promising catalyst needed screening so that the regulated behavior of vacancies and OCGs could be analyzed more clearly and effectively. As shown in Table S1 (ESI†), Pt4/CO edge V2ZNR showed the lowest energy barrier (0.09 eV) with the exothermic energy of 0.21 eV, which manifested its unique dehydrogenated capacity and potential application in PDH.
3.2 Geometric and electronic properties of Pt4/CO edge V2ZNR
3.2.1 Geometric properties In order to identify the effects of vacancies and OCGs on PDH, other three catalysts (Pt4/PZNR, Pt4/V2ZNR and Pt4/CO edge PZNR) were adopted as the contrastive catalysts. The optimized configurations of these models are depicted in Fig. 2. Moreover, the average lengths of Pt–C bonds and binding energies of Pt clusters are listed in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the binding energies of Pt clusters anchored on PZNR and CO PZNR increased by 3.27 and 3.33 eV with the formation of V2. The enhanced binding strength might stem from the disturbance of geometric configurations. In Fig. 2, it could be seen that the most stable configurations of Pt4 varied with the V2 introduction. As for the carbon nanoribbons without V2 (PZNR and CO edge PZNR), Pt4 combined parallelly with the carbon planer via three Pt atoms. However, the tetrahedral Pt was distorted to three-layered configuration with the formation of V2. One Pt atom in the lowest layer anchored at the V2 site and bonded with four C atoms around the vacancy. Two Pt atoms in the second layer were parallel to the carbon nanoribbons and bonded with the planer C atoms. Only one Pt atom was placed in the top layer and combined with two Pt atoms. Consequently, the distance of the Pt–C bond decreased from 2.22 Å to 2.04 Å with V2 formation, implying that the interaction between Pt clusters and carbon nanoribbons was improved in terms of geometric effects.

a P represents the pristine carbon nanoribbons without vacancy.
When introducing CO edge groups in Pt4/PZNR, the binding energies of Pt clusters increased from −2.54 eV to −2.62 eV, proving that the formation of CO edge groups was another effective tool to maintain the stability of Pt clusters. It was worth-noting that the binding energy of Pt clusters anchored on CO edge V2ZNR was the highest among all the catalysts, which demonstrated that the introduction of CO edge groups in carbon nanoribbons with V2 showed most excellent ability to prevent metal clusters from agglomeration. However, the positive effects of CO edge groups toward the binding strength of metal clusters could not be explained by geometric effects, resulting from the identical configurations of Pt4/PZNR, Pt4/CO edge PZNR, Pt4/V2ZNR and Pt4/CO edge V2ZNR. Therefore, exploring the electronic effects of Pt clusters caused by CO edge groups was indispensable to the explanation of the enhanced catalytic stability.
3.2.2 Electronic properties Bader charge was used to provide auxiliary evaluation on the binding energies of Pt clusters in view of electronic properties. As shown in Table 1, the electron transfer of Pt atoms could be divided into two parts: one was the Pt atoms that bonded directly with C atoms and showed loss electron state; the other was the Pt atoms at the top layer and possessed accepted electron state. With the introduction of the CO edge groups in Pt4/V2ZNR, more electrons transferred from the Pt4 atom to the C atoms around vacancies. Simultaneously, Pt1 obtained more electrons from −0.24 eV to −0.27 eV, which explained the enhanced MSI based on electronic effects. Therefore, V2 exerted great influence on tailoring the geometric properties of Pt clusters to enhance the interaction with carbon supports. On the existence of V2, introducing CO edge groups could further reinforce catalyst stabilization by increasing the charge transfer between the Pt clusters and the support.
3.3 Propane and propylene adsorption
The adsorption of propane and propylene was of vital importance to determine the catalytic activity and selectivity.39 Propane and propylene could be adsorbed either at the top Pt atom or at the edge Pt atom. After comparing the adsorption energies of the two adsorption behaviors, the stable configurations of propane and propylene are shown in Fig. 3. The optimized adsorption site was the edge Pt atom, which was because of the edge Pt atom that could provide more vacant orbitals for the adsorbates due to its electron loss state. As shown in Fig. 3, the adsorption energies of propane were in the range of −0.30 eV to −0.49 eV, representing the weak interaction between propane and the catalyst surface, whereas propylene showed stronger interaction with the catalyst surface via π-mode, with the adsorption energies from −1.37 eV to −2.52 eV. Charge density differences were employed to investigate the adsorption behaviors of propane and propylene, as displayed in Fig. S6 (ESI†). Obviously, there were barely no electron accumulation between propane and Pt atoms. However, electron redistribution took place at the interface between propylene and the catalyst surface, accounting for the chemical adsorption behavior of propylene.
Fig. 3 The optimized adsorption configurations of propane and propylene adsorbed on the catalysts.
Furthermore, the d-band center (εb) was always adopted to evaluate the adsorption capacity of catalysts. In particular, with εb closer to the Fermi level (0 eV), the antibonding orbitals moved upward and became empty, leading to enhanced adsorption ability.40,41 The relationship between εb and the adsorption energies of propylene is shown in Fig. 4. Obviously, the R2 of εb and the adsorption strength of propylene being 0.9782 possess a decent liner relationship. As εb increased to the Fermi level, the adsorption energies of propylene were improved, which was in line with the d-band theory. The adsorption energy of propylene in Pt4/PZNR was the largest, which was detrimental to the product desorption. When compared with Pt4/V2ZNR, the adsorption energies of propylene decreased from −2.52 eV to −1.37 eV, indicating that V2 introduction in PZNR was beneficial to promote the product desorption. However, further introducing the CO edge groups in Pt4/V2ZNR had hazardous effects on propylene desorption, on accounting of the increased adsorption energies of propylene from −1.37 eV to −1.66 eV. The enhancement of V2 towards propylene desorption could be diminished by CO edge groups. Although the introduction of CO edge groups in carbon nanoribbons with V2 enhanced the interaction of metal clusters, the strength of propylene desorption would be restricted simultaneously. Therefore, reinforcing propylene desorption and yield was the pivotal cut-off for the co-existence of vacancy engineering and oxygen functionality in carbon-based catalysts.
Fig. 4 The relationship between the d-band center of Pt atoms and the adsorption energies of propylene.
The partial density of orbit states (PDOS) is also depicted in Fig. S7 (ESI†) to provide an auxiliary validation for the d-band center theory. The overlap between the d-orbits of Pt atoms and p-orbits of C atoms in propylene could affect the adsorption strength. It was found that the degree of the overlap between d-orbits and p-orbits corresponded with the d-band center. The higher d-band center showed a deeper overlap, leading to stronger propylene adsorption.
3.4 PDH reaction mechanism of Pt clusters anchored on carbon nanoribbons
The possible reaction pathways involved in PDH are depicted in Fig. S8 (ESI†) and the reaction energies and activation barriers of the elementary steps are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), seven elementary reactive steps were considered, which were divided into three parts: (i) the continuous dehydrogenation of propane to propylene (R1)–(R4); (ii) the deep dehydrogenation of propylene to propenyl (R5) and (R6); (iii) the C–C bond cracking of propane (R7).

3.4.1 The descriptor of catalytic activity 3.4.1.1 First C–H bond scission As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†) and Table 2, the first C–H bond scission in propane might take place in methyl groups or methylene groups. After comparing the activation barriers of the two elementary steps, the potential energy diagram of the most favorable reaction pathways in the four catalysts is shown in Fig. 5(a). The most favorable reaction pathways of the first C–H bond scission in propane were changed after introducing V2 in Pt4/PZNR and Pt4/CO edge PZNR. For Pt4/PZNR and Pt4/CO edge PZNR, the cleavage of C–H bonds in propane was likely to start from the methyl group to form CH3CH2CH2*, with the activation barriers of 0.49 eV and 0.55 eV, respectively. With the formation of V2, propane preferred to be dehydrogenated to CH3CHCH3* via breaking the C–H bond in the methylene group, accompanied with the lower activation barriers in Pt4/V2ZNR (0.43 eV) and Pt4/CO edge V2ZNR (0.40 eV). Therefore, the existence of V2 could change the reaction pathway of the first C–H bond scission, resulting in lower activation barriers and more excellent abilities to break C–H bonds.

After functionalizing Pt4/V2ZNR with CO edge groups, the activation barrier of the first C–H bond breaking further decreased from 0.43 eV to 0.40 eV, representing that the CO edge groups were beneficial to first dehydrogenation at the co-existing V2. However, the situation was different for Pt4/PZNR and Pt4/CO edge PZNR. The activation barrier of the C–H bond scission in Pt4/CO edge PZNR was 0.06 eV higher than that in Pt4/PZNR, which hampered the C–H bond breaking. The adverse effects caused by introducing CO edge groups in PZNR implied that the promoted effect of CO edge groups to the C–H bond scission only worked as the premise of V2 existence. Therefore, introducing the CO edge groups in carbon nanoribbons with V2 was an effective method to promote the first C–H bond breaking in propane.
3.4.1.2 Second C–H bond scission The potential energy profile of the second C–H bond breaking via R3 and R4 in all catalysts is shown in Fig. 5(b). The activation barriers of Pt4/PZNR and Pt4/CO edge PZNR were both higher than those of nanocarbons with V2, demonstrating that vacancies could strengthen the second C–H bond breaking. Pt4/CO edge V2ZNR showed the lowest activation barrier (0.37 eV) of the second C–H bond scission, following by Pt4/V2ZNR, Pt4/PZNR and Pt4/CO edge PZNR. The sequence of breaking the second C–H bond was similar to that of the first C–H bond scission, and thus the positive effects of the co-existed V2 and CO edge groups were proved again. 3.4.1.3 The activity descriptor in the whole reaction diagram of PDH The potential energy diagram of the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene is shown in Fig. 6, and the relative geometric configurations of the intermediates are displayed in Fig. S9 (ESI†). Noticeably, there were H-move steps behind every dehydrogenation step, viz., the dehydrogenated H atoms always moved from the closest Pt atom to the top Pt atom, in accordance with the reported works.30,31 As shown in Fig. 6, the reaction energies of the first H-move steps in Pt4/PZNR and Pt4/CO edge PZNR were endothermic with 0.20 eV and 0.04 eV, respectively. However, the H-move steps changed to be exothermic with V2 introduction, which implied that vacancies could enhance the continuous dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in terms of thermodynamics.
Fig. 6 The whole potential diagram for the dehydrogenation of propane to propylene in four catalysts.
In addition, the activation barriers of rate-determining steps (RDS) in the C–H bond breaking were always adopted as the descriptors of catalytic activity to evaluate the conversion efficiency.42,43 It could be seen from Fig. 6 that the RDS were different for the carbon nanoribbons with or without vacancies. For Pt4/PZNR and Pt4/CO edge PZNR, the activation barriers of the second dehydrogenation steps (0.63 eV and 0.74 eV) were both higher than those of the first dehydrogenation steps (0.49 eV and 0.55 eV). Thus, the RDS of the carbon nanoribbons without vacancies were the second dehydrogenation steps. When V2 was introduced, the activation barriers of the first dehydrogenation steps in Pt4/V2ZNR and Pt4/CO edge V2ZNR were all higher than the second dehydrogenation steps, and thus the first dehydrogenations of propane to 2-propyl were the RDS. The change of RDS in the carbon nanoribbons with V2 decreased the activation barriers of C–H bond scission, suggesting that V2 introduction contributed to improve the catalytic activity. Further functionalizing the carbon nanoribbons with CO edge groups did not alter the RDS in the whole reaction network, but the activation barriers were decreased, as compared with Pt4/V2ZNR. The enhanced catalytic activity caused by CO edge groups might be explained by the increased electron transfer between Pt atoms and the support. The active site of C–H bond scission was the Pt3 atom in Pt4/V2ZNR and Pt4/CO edge V2ZNR. As shown in Table 1, the charge of the Pt3 atom in Pt4/CO edge V2ZNR was 0.02 |e| higher than that in Pt4/V2ZNR. The more loss of electron state of the Pt3 atom in Pt4/CO edge V2ZNR suggested stronger ability to break the C–H bond. After comparing the activation barriers of RDS in all catalysts, the conversion efficiency of Pt4/CO edge PZNR was the lowest, with the high activation barrier of 0.74 eV. The following Pt4/PZNR and Pt4/V2ZNR are obtained. Pt4/C O edge V2ZNR showed the most excellent activity and conversion efficiency to strengthen the C–H bond scission, owing to its lowest activation barrier of RDS (0.40 eV). Therefore, the cleavage of C–H bonds in RDS could be maximized by introducing CO edge groups in carbon nanoribbons with V2.
3.4.2 Deep dehydrogenation of propylene and regeneration of active sites After continuous two-step dehydrogenations, propylene either desorbed from the surface or dehydrogenated deeply to form propenyl, determining the catalytic selectivity. The energy magnitude between propylene deep dehydrogenation and desorption (Ediff) was always considered as an indicator of catalytic selectivity.43,44 The higher Ediff demonstrated that the desorption of propylene took place more easily than deep dehydrogenation, resulting in enhanced selectivity. As for the deep dehydrogenation steps, there were side products (CH3CCH2* or CH3CHCH*) produced via R5 and R6 pathways. As shown in Table 2, the activation barriers of CH3CHCH* production were all lower than CH3CCH2* formation, implying that the majority of propylene dehydrogenated to form side product CH3CHCH*. Therefore, the energy magnitude of deep dehydrogenation in Ediff was the activation barrier of CH3CHCH* formation.
Fig. 7(a) displays the comparison between the activation barriers of CH3CHCH* formation and the desorption energies of propylene. According to the Ediff, Pt4/PZNR showed the lowest selectivity (−0.53 eV), and the following Pt4/CO edge V2ZNR (−0.29 eV), Pt4/V2ZNR (−0.09 eV) and Pt4/CO edge PZNR (−0.03 eV) are obtained. It was found that the Ediff increased from −0.53 eV to −0.09 eV after introducing V2 in PZNR, implying that the selectivity of Pt4/PZNR could be improved by V2 formation, whereas the Ediff of Pt4/CO edge V2ZNR was 0.26 eV lower than that of Pt4/CO edge PZNR, which demonstrated that the enhanced effect of V2 towards catalytic selectivity was weakened by CO edge groups. Similarly, after introducing CO edge groups in V2ZNR, the Ediff decreased by 0.20 eV, representing that the CO edge groups were detrimental to the selectivity at the co-existence with V2. Therefore, although the co-regulation of V2 and CO edge groups showed the most excellent catalytic activity, more efforts are still needed to improve their selectivity. The balance between activity and selectivity was in accordance with the scaling relationship,43 which represented that excellent activity always accompanied with the sacrifice of selectivity. The selectivity of Pt clusters anchored on CO edge V2ZNR was not as good as those anchored on V2ZNR and CO edge PZNR but is still better than those anchored on the PZNR. Moreover, it could be seen from Fig. 7(a) that the Ediff values in the four catalyst models were negative, which represented that propylene was likely to be dehydrogenated deeply rather than desorbed from the surface. The negative Ediff values were similar to the results of the Pt4 anchored on the carbon nanotube30 and the pure Pt4 cluster.31 The factor accounting for weak selectivity might be the low strength of propylene desorption, which deserved to be further explored during the regeneration of active sites.

The regeneration of the active site in PDH was comprised of propylene desorption and hydrogen desorption. Fig. S10 (ESI†) displays the geometric configurations and desorption energies of these products during the regeneration of the active site. Obviously, when hydrogen and propylene existed simultaneously, hydrogen was likely to desorb first owing to its lower desorption energies. Subsequently, propylene dehydrogenated to side products instead of desorbing from the surface, due to the high desorption energies. Therefore, propylene desorption during the regeneration of the active site was the main limitation to improve catalytic selectivity.
3.4.3 C–C bond scission The C–C bond breaking in propane could produce coke precursors, and the inhibition of these reaction steps was beneficial to improve catalytic stability. The potential energy diagram of the C–C bond scission in propane is shown in Fig. 7(b). It could be seen that the activation barriers of C–C bond scissions were all above 1.00 eV, higher than those of C–H bond scissions. This implied that the C–C bond breaking was not favorable in terms of kinetics. After introducing V2, the activation barriers of C–C bond breaking in Pt4/PZNR and Pt4/CO edge PZNR increased by 0.18 eV and 0.59 eV, demonstrating that the vacancies could not only enhance the ability of C–H bond scission but also inhibit C–C bond cracking. On the basis of V2, the activation barriers of C–C bond cracking increased from 1.61 eV to 1.92 eV by further introducing the CO edge groups in Pt4/V2ZNR. Therefore, the introduction of CO edge groups in carbon nanoribbons with V2 could effectively hamper C–C bond cracking and restrict the production of coke-precursors.
3.5 Connection to the experiments
Carbon-based catalysts were the alternatives to traditional metals or metal oxides employed in alkane dehydrogenation. Da et al.15 synthesized carbon nanotubes to support Pt nanoparticles in PDH. The results showed that vacancies and OCGs in carbon nanotubes were beneficial to the enhancement of catalytic activity and stability, which was in agreement with the results of our work. In this work, the promotion of OCGs with co-existing vacancies in Pt clusters-anchored nanocarbons for PDH was further explored on the atom level scale. Differing from the experimental work, we revealed the specific types of the vacancies (divacancies) and OCGs (CO edge groups) in nanocarbons to improve the catalytic performance. Moreover, a comprehensive explanation on how these factors affect the catalytic behavior was provided, which was beneficial to controllably design the carbon-based catalysts with higher activity, selectivity and stability.
For the non-metal carbon catalysts employed in PDH, the most acknowledged active site was the CO groups.34,45 Therefore, we also took CO edge groups as the active site to catalyze PDH, for the purpose of excluding the possibility of other potential active sites. The activation barriers and reaction energies of the elementary reaction steps catalyzed by CO edge groups are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). When CO edge groups were considered as the active site in Pt4/CO edge V2ZNR, the activation barrier of RDS in propane dehydrogenation was 1.13 eV, much higher than that catalyzed by Pt clusters. Therefore, as Pt clusters anchored on the nanocarbons, propane dehydrogenation was difficult to be activated at the OCGs. The OCGs primarily controlled the catalytic properties of Pt clusters, thus indirectly improving the catalytic properties.
4. Conclusions
The promotion of OCGs on Pt4/carbon nanoribbons with vacancies for PDH was revealed by DFT calculations. A total of 46 carbon nanoribbons with various vacancies and OCGs were designed based on the experimental results to conduct the systematic and comprehensive study. After initially analyzing the binding energies of Pt clusters, it was found that vacancies were beneficial to strengthen the MSI and hamper the agglomeration of Pt clusters. Only specific OCGs (anhydride, quinone, CO edge and OH groups) played the role of a booster on the prohibition of metal sintering at the co-existing vacancies. Taking the C–H bond cleavage in methane into consideration, Pt4/CO edge V2ZNR was screened out as a promising catalyst applied in PDH. On comparing with the nanocarbons with only V2, the introduction of CO edge groups in nanocarbons co-existing with V2 further improved the abilities of Pt clusters to break C–H bonds and inhibit C–C bond cracking in PDH. This is why Pt4/CO edge V2ZNR showed the lowest activation barrier of C–H bond breaking (0.40 eV) and the highest barrier of C–C bond cracking (1.92 eV). However, the selectivity of Pt4/CO edge V2ZNR still needed improvement, which was because of the co-existence of V2 and CO edge groups that would restrict propylene desorption from the surface. Therefore, this work employed a detailed exploration of the regulation of vacancies and OCGs in carbon-based catalysts, which provided a guarantee for accurately designing excellent catalysts for alkane dehydrogenation.
