 Based on reviewing the supplied document, I do not believe it is directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation as it focuses on the aqueous phase hydrogenolysis and dehydration mechanisms of 1-propanol over platinum catalysts. The document does not discuss converting propane to propylene. Therefore, the relevance is no.
