In Situ Preparation of Polyamine-Derived Ru Cluster@N-Doped Porous Carbon Nanoplates for Hydrogen Evolution over Wide pH Ranges
Abstract
Efficient and low-cost electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) are required for producing hydrogen energy through water splitting. Carbon materials as HER catalyst supports are explored widely since the strong metal–support interactions are generally believed to be active and stable toward HER. Herein, we report N-doped porous carbon materials as novel substrates to stabilize the cluster metal sites through the Ru(III) polyamine complexes, which play an important role not only in efficient electron transfer but also in the increasing utilization of metallic active sites. Meanwhile, due to the strong metal–support interactions driven by Ru(III) polyamine complexes, the obtained Ru cluster with a mass loading of 3% on N-doped porous carbon nanoplates (Ru cluster@NCs) exhibits robust stability for HER at a constant voltage, proving to be a promising candidate catalyst for HER. Density functional theory calculations further indicate that the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of adsorbed H* of Ru cluster@NCs is much closer to zero compared to Ru@(10%)NCs and Pt/C(20%), thus Ru cluster@NCs facilitate the HER process.

Synopsis
The Ru clusters anchoring on N-doped porous carbon nanoplates were prepared by the in situ polyamine-derived preparation strategy, which show excellent hydrogen evolution reaction properties because of the d-band of Ru upshift to the Fermi level due to the strong interaction between Ru and N.

With high-energy density and zero-carbon nature, hydrogen (H2) has been showing great promise to replace fossil energy. (1−4) Different from the H2 generation from steam-reformed methane with energy inefficiency and low purity, electrolysis of water has been recognized as a more economical and sustainable strategy for H2 production. (5−7) However, efficient electrocatalysts are urgently needed for boosting the sluggish hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics under harsh conditions. (8,9) Notably, the HER kinetics for most electrocatalysts in an acidic medium is much faster at least 2 orders of magnitude than that in alkaline and neutral solutions with an extra water dissociation step, whereas the durability of electrocatalysts is a great challenge due to the dissolution of electrocatalysts during the HER process under harsh conditions. (6,10,11) As the promising alternative to Pt-based materials, Ru with Pt-like bond strength with hydrogen (∼65 kcal mol–1) has shown excellent HER activity in a recent report. (12) However, with high cohesive energy, the Ru atom utilization is significantly decreased due to their nature of being agglomerated easily which can lead to unsatisfactory mass activity. (13,14) Hitherto, the Ru sites uniformly dispersed on functional carbon materials have been recognized as an effective strategy for overcoming those challenges. (15) Nevertheless, it lacks the synthesized process for obtaining Ru-based supported catalysts simultaneously with high atom utilization efficiency and robust durability.
When using carbon supports that are coupled with the HER active materials as HER electrocatalysts, the HER on carbon-supported composite materials is enhanced significantly due to the strong interaction between metal active sites and carbon/carbon-based supports. (16,17) Several allotropes of carbon materials (such as carbon nanotubes, (18) graphene, (19) carbon fiber, (20) carbon nanospheres, (21) etc.) with strong endurance in acid/base media have been reported as components of advanced catalysts for HER, which could provide high durability with robust stability due to their insoluble and stable nature. A universal synthesis strategy for obtaining metal clusters of Ru, Pt, Pd, etc., combining single cobalt atoms anchored on nitrogen-doped carbon (Ru/Pt/Pd@Co-SAs/N–C) has been reported by Mu’s group, which opens a new avenue for the synthesis of metal cluster/single cobalt atom heterostructures with superior HER property. (22) The theoretical simulation and experimental results have revealed that the strong coupling between the Ru active sites and neighboring C atoms in carbon materials leads to a unique electron-mediating vehicle of Ru, which could improve the reversible redox-switching during the catalytic process. (23) Additionally, even though a higher degree of graphitization could strengthen the resistance to corrosion of carbon-based supports, they still suffer from oxidative corrosion, especially at the start-up and shutdown process, (24) which could improve the catalytic activity and stability under harsh conditions. Recently, polymer pyrolysis has been recognized as an efficient strategy to generate active electrode materials for HER under harsh conditions. (25,26) The active catalyst of Co-, N-, and S-tridoped carbon (CoNS-C) was prepared through heat treatment of nitrogen- and sulfur-enriched poly(m-aminobenzenesulfonic acid) and cobalt(II) nitrate, which exhibits an outstanding performance for HER with low overpotential and robust durability. (27)
Polyethylenimine (PEI) is currently one of the most widely studied cationic polymer carriers. It is a water-soluble polymer composed of monomers (−CH, CH, and –NH−) with primary, secondary, and tertiary amine groups. PEI monomers contain one nitrogen per three atoms and form amino groups. (28−30) Meanwhile, the metallic ion–PEI complex species can be generated due to the connection between the metallic ion and −NH2 on PEI, which contributes to obtaining the uniformly dispersed metal active sites on the carbon support. (31−33) Herein, Ru nanoclusters anchoring on N-doped porous carbon nanoplates (Ru cluster@NCs) were derived from polymers with the −NH2 group. With this method, the loading of Ru on N-doped porous carbon nanoplates is determined by the amount of Ru(III) precursors. The synthesized Ru cluster@NCs exhibit excellent HER activity with overpotentials of 28 and 41 mV at 10 mA cm–2 and low Tafel slopes of 25.36 and 42.81 mV dec–1, respectively, when evaluated in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M PBS solutions, which are superior to most reported hydrogen evolution catalysts and commercial Pt/C (20%). In particular, Ru cluster@NCs can reach up to 1 A cm–2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution at −0.582 V vs RHE. The obtained Ru cluster@NCs not only have a relatively large electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) but also the turnover frequency (TOF) of Ru cluster@NCs for HER at the potential of −0.1 V vs RHE is 12.61, 10.74, and 3.02 times higher than that of Ru(1.5%)@NCs, Ru(10%)@NCs, and Pt/C(20%), respectively. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that the synergistic effect between Ru active sites and N anchor points possibly upshifts the d-band center of Ru that contributes to the adsorption of H+ to facilitate the Tafel step during the HER process. The design strategy of hydrogen evolution catalysts for the pyrolysis of metal ion PEI composites opens up a simple and novel method for the effective synthesis of electrocatalysts.

2.1. Chemicals and Materials
Ruthenium(III) chloride (RuCl3, ruthenium content 45–55%), polyethylenimine (PEI, MW = 10 000), potassium phosphate monobasic (KH2PO4, 99%), and potassium phosphate dibasic (K2HPO4·3H2O, 99%) were obtained from Aladdin Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Commercial Pt/C was purchased from Macklin Inc. Hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36–38%) was purchased from Xilong Science Co., Ltd. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 95–98%) was purchased from China National Pharmaceutical Group Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Deionized water (resistance >18 MΩ cm–1) was used in all the experiments.
2.2. Synthesis of Ru Cluster@NCs
The Ru cluster@NCs were synthesized through a typical calcination reaction. 200 μL of 0.05 M RuCl3 and 6 mL of 0.5 M PEI were mixed first and then stirred for several minutes until mixed well. In the second step, 6 mL of HCl (content 36–38%) was added to the above solution and stirred for 3 min. After that, the mixed solution was stewed for overnight stratification and freeze-dried. Then, the dried material was taken out and put into a tubular furnace for calcination. The samples were maintained under 800 °C with a N2 atmosphere for 6 h. Finally, the as-prepared samples were washed several times with deionized water and dried.
With the same method, the samples of Ru(1.5%)@NCs, Ru(10%)@NCs, and N-doped porous carbon nanoplates were also prepared as references with different mass loadings of Ru atoms.
2.3. Materials Characterizations
The morphology and microstructure of Ru cluster@NCs, Ru(1.5%)@NCs, and Ru(10%)@NCs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL-2100) with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer, and their structure was measured on a compact scanning electron microscope of Zeiss Merlin with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a Kratos AXIS ULTRA instrument using a C 1s peak at 284.6 eV as the reference to correct the binding energy. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was recorded on a Rigaku-D/MAX/2500PC to analyze the crystal structure of the samples. The ultraviolet and visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy measurements were recorded on a Shimadzu UV2600U spectrometer at room temperature. The specific surface area based on the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller standard was examined with an ASAP 2460 Version 3.01 (Micromeritics Instrument Corp., USA). The Raman spectra were obtained from a Renishaw Ramascope (confocal Raman microscope, Renishaw, Gloucestershire, U.K.) equipped with a He–Ne laser (λ = 532 nm).
2.4. Electrochemical Measurements
The electrochemical measurements were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E) with a three-electrode system. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), chronoamperometry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements were carried out with the conventional three-electrode system in 0.5 M H2SO4 and 1.0 M PBS, which consisted of a catalyst-modified glassy carbon (GC) electrode with a working area of 0.07065 cm–2 as the working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode, and a carbon rod as the counter electrode. The LSV measurement was corrected with a 95% iR compensation. All potential values were calibrated to a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) based on the equation of ERHE = ESCE + 0.0591pH + 0.242. The catalyst ink (loading mass, 0.11 mg cm–2) with uniform distribution on the GC electrode was obtained by ultrasonic dispersion of 10 mg of the electrochemical catalyst and 5 mL of isopropanol/Nafion solution (20% isopropanol and 0.02% of Nafion, 79.8% ultrapure water). 4 μL of catalyst ink was added to the GC electrode and dried at room temperature. The electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cdl) was evaluated by CV curves with scan rates from 20 to 120 mV/s, which is linearly proportional to ECSA.
The TOF values were calculated according to the formula TOF = I/2Fn, where 2 denotes the electron numbers required for forming one H2 from water. I is the current density at a fixed overpotential, F represents the Faraday constant, and n means the total number of moles of active sites. The number of active sites (n) can be measured by a formerly reported method, n = Q/2F where Q is the charge capacity calculated by integrating the CV curves, which were obtained from the cyclic voltammograms ranging in a neutral solution.
2.5. Simulation Methods
According to first principles, all spin-polarization density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed within the generalized gradient approximation by means of the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof formulation. (34−36) The projected augmented wave potentials are selected to give the description of the ionic cores. (37) A plane wave basis assembly with 520 eV as the kinetic energy cutoff is adopted to consider the valence electrons. The Gaussian smearing approach setting a width at 0.05 eV is applied to analyze the Kohn–Sham orbitals, and partial orbital occupancies is permitted. The electronic energy was regarded as self-consistent while the energy fluctuation was less than 10–5 eV. Also, a geometric optimization was taken as convergent with an energy fluctuation of less than 0.03 eV Å–1. The Brillouin zone integral uses the surface structures of the 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack k-point. The free energies (ΔG) of elemental reaction steps were calculated using eq 1

where ΔE is expressed as the difference value between the total energy, ΔEZPE and ΔS represent the differences between the zero-point energy and the entropy variation, and T denotes the temperature (T = 300 K here). For density of states, the Brillouin zone integration was performed using 6 × 6 × 2 Monkhorst–Pack k-point sampling for our slab structure. The d ban center for d-states had been calculated using first principles with the metal d orbital distribution.

3.1. Synthesis and Characterization of Ru Cluster@NCs
The Ru cluster@NCs were synthesized through the following steps. The mixed precursors of Ru(III)–PEI complex species were first dissolved out by adding 6 M HCl due to the low solubility of PEI under a strongly acidic solution. After freeze-drying, the powders of Ru(III)–PEI complex species were pyrolyzed at 800 °C in a N2 atmosphere (Figure 1a). For comparison, catalysts with different loadings of Ru and N-doped porous carbon nanoplates were further prepared using the same method. It is worthwhile to note that before dissolution from the mixed solution, Ru(III)–PEI complex species have been chelated, driven by the strong chelation effect between Ru3+ and amine groups (Figure S1). The significant absorption peak of RuCl3 solution at a wavelength of 400 nm disappears after adding PEI solutions due to the formation of the Ru(III)–PEI complex species. The loadings of Ru on N-doped porous carbon nanoplates were determined to be 3, 1.5, and 10 wt % for Ru cluster@NCs, Ru(1.5%)@NCs, and Ru (10%)@NCs, respectively, through energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (Figure S2). The morphology of the as-prepared Ru cluster@NCs was first characterized by SEM and TEM images. As shown in Figures 1b and S3, the carbon supports show a similar porous nanosheet structure whether in the presence or absence of Ru atoms, which facilitates the mass transfer. (38,39) Importantly, the porous nature and specific surface areas were further determined by calculation from the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller results. The specific surface area of the achieved Ru cluster@NCs is 158.58 m2 g–1 with a pore volume of 0.28 cm3/g, indicating a large specific surface area and an obvious mesopores feature (Figure S4). The D peak is a characteristic peak caused by an amorphous structure while the G peak is a characteristic peak caused by an ordered structure. Therefore, a higher ID/IG ratio indicates a higher degree of defects in the carrier structure. The intensity of D and G band ratios (ID/IG) of Ru cluster@NCs, in which the D peak is located at 1345 cm–1 and G peak is located at 1591 cm–1, is 1.05 (Figure S5 and Table S1), much higher than N-doped porous carbon nanoplates and much-reported carbon supports, (40−42) indicating a low amount of graphite but a high amount of defects on Ru cluster@NCs due to the release of evolved gas during the pyrolysis at high temperatures. (43,44) As shown in Figure 1c,d, the TEM and high-resolution TEM images verify the existence of densely and uniformly dispersed active sites identified in the N-doped porous carbon nanosheet matrix. When increasing the loading of Ru atoms, the cluster/nanoparticle size increases significantly (Figures S6 and S7). Especially, when the loading is 10 wt %, the Ru nanoparticles become larger with obvious aggregation. Moreover, as shown in Figure 1d, the corresponding fast Fourier transform (FFT) diffraction pattern presents a symmetrical regular and discrete point pattern. The selected area electron diffraction pattern shows discrete diffraction spots, which could be well-indexed to the (101) and (100) facets of hexagonal Ru, respectively (Figures 1e,f, and S8). Meanwhile, the high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy images disclose the bright dots throughout N-doped porous carbon nanoplates (Figure 1g), indicating that the Ru active sites have been successfully anchored to N-doped porous carbon nanoplates. Meanwhile, the energy-dispersive X-ray mappings demonstrate a homogeneous distribution of Ru, N, and C on N-doped porous carbon nanoplates for all specimens (Figure 1h–k). As shown in Figure 1l, the Ru cluster@NCs exhibited broadened diffraction peaks with a typical hexagonal phase. (45) The XRD spectra of Ru cluster@NCs show that the diffraction peaks at 38.39, 42.15, 44.00, 58.35, 69.46, and 78.39° correspond to the (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), and (103) planes of Ru (Ru-PDF no. 06-0663), respectively, agreeing well with the above results. The wide peak located at 26.40° is the carbon peak, attributing to (002) planes of the carbon phase (C-PDF no. 41-1487). When the Ru(III) precursors are increased, the characteristic peaks tend to be obvious due to the diameter of Ru nanoparticles on porous carbons, while when the Ru(III) precursors are decreased, it is difficult to find the characteristic peaks due to their small diameter (Figure S9).

(l) XRD patterns of Ru cluster@NCs and N-doped porous carbon nanoplates.
XPS was employed to investigate the valence states and chemical environments of the Ru species of Ru cluster@NCs. The full XPS survey spectrum of Ru cluster@NCs reveals the presence of Ru, C, N, and O with an atomic ratio of Ru/C/N/O = 0.50:81.56:9.62:8.32 (Figures 2a, S10, and S11), consistent with the results of energy-dispersive spectrometry (Figure S2). As shown in Figure 2b, the doublet peaks located at 462.3 and 484.5 eV should be ascribed to Ru 3p3/2 and Ru 3p1/2 of metallic Ru0, respectively, while binding energies at 466.72 and 487.6 eV are attributed to Ru3+ species. Compared to the typical binding energies of metallic Ru0 (≈461.2 eV for 3p3/2, ≈483.7 eV for 3p1/2), the binding energies of metallic Ru0 for Ru cluster@NCs display a positive shift to higher binding energy for Ru3+, suggesting the considerable electron transfer from atomically dispersed Ru to the carbon substrate. (42) The high-resolution spectra of N 1s show peaks at the binding energies of 398.0, 398.8, 400.0, 400.9, and 402.7 eV for pyridinic-N, Ru–N, pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N, and oxidized-N, respectively, (12) indicating that Ru clusters interact with N in the carbon support, which could facilitate the HER activity and durability due to the strong electronic coupling effects (Figure 2c). (40) Meanwhile, the high-resolution spectrum of C 1s was further analyzed, which shows overlap with Ru0 3d (Figure 2d), and the peaks at the binding energy of 281.5 and 283.1 eV belong to the characteristic peaks of Ru 3d5/2 and Ru 3d3/2, respectively, (46−48) also revealing that several subpeaks located at 283.5, 284.7, and 287.2 eV correspond to C═C, C–N, and C–O, respectively. Those results confirm the strong interaction between metallic Ru and the carbon substrate.

3.2. Investigation of the Electrocatalytic HER
The electrocatalytic HER performance of Ru cluster@NCs was measured by using a standard three-electrode system in harsh conditions of 0.5 M H2SO4 solution. To better compare the interaction between metal active sites and the carbon support, commercial Pt/C(20%), Ru(10%)@NCs, and Ru(1.5%)@NCs, and N-doped porous carbon nanoplates were further tested under the same conditions. As exhibited in Figure 3a, the HER polarization curves with a low scan rate at 5 mV s–1 indicate that the Ru cluster@NCs showed superior HER activity with an overpotential of 28 mV to achieve 10 mA cm–2 in 0.5 M H2SO4 solutions and commercial Pt/C and Ru(10%)@NCs required an overvoltage of 58 and 216 mV, respectively, to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm–2. In addition, the overpotentials of Ru cluster@NCs at 100 and 500 mA cm–2 were only 86 and 289 mV, much lower than commercial Pt/C and Ru(10%)@NCs. At fixed potentials of 100, 200, and 500 mV, the current densities of Ru cluster@NCs were 125, 295, and 728 mA cm–2, much higher than commercial Pt/C at 49.26, 159, and 508 mA cm–2, and Ru(10%)@NCs at 3, 9, and 83 mA cm–2, respectively (Figure 3b). To further evaluate the HER performance, the Tafel slopes were calculated from polarization curves by the Tafel equation, which could identify the reaction mechanism of the HER. Although the mechanism of HER varies slightly under acidic and neutral conditions, both involve the adsorption and desorption of some typical reaction intermediates. Generally, the HER process related to adsorbed hydrogen intermediates (Had) in acidic and neutral media was composed of the Volmer/Heyrovsky mechanism (Volmer step: H+ + e– → Had, Heyrovsky step: H+ + e– + Had → H2) with a Tafel slope of 120/40 mV dec–1 or the Volmer/Tafel mechanism (Volmer step: H+ + e– → Had, Tafel step: 2Had → H2) with a Tafel slope of 120/30 mV dec–1. Due to the presence of adsorbed hydrogen intermediates in both reaction pathways, hydrogen adsorption free energy (ΔGHads) is an important indicator reflecting the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts for HER. According to the Sabatier principle, the ΔGHads of an ideal electrocatalyst should be close to zero. (49,50) The Tafel slope of Ru cluster@NCs was 25.36 mV dec–1 (Figure 3c), which was the smallest among the obtained samples, indicating the most rapid kinetic rate in the hydrogen evolution process along with the increased impressed voltage, (51) and the rate determination step of the Ru cluster@NCs HER process is the Tafel reaction, and its reaction mechanism follows the Volmer Tafel mechanism. The TOF value for the Ru cluster@NCs at the potential of −0.1 V vs RHE was 3.06 H2 s–1 (Figure S12), much higher than that of commercial Pt/C (1.01 H2 s–1), Ru(10%)@NCs (0.24 H2 s–1), and Ru(1.5%)@NCs (0.29 H2 s–1), suggesting an ultrahigh intrinsic HER activity.

To further validate the electrical conductivity and interfacial charge-transfer rate, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements of the as-prepared catalysts was measured. The equivalent circuit model of Ru cluster@NCs was also provided in the inset of Figure 3d, where Rs and Rct denote the solution and charge-transfer resistances, respectively, whereas the CPE is regarded as the double-layer capacitor from the catalyst/support and catalyst solution. (52) From Nyquist plots, the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) of Ru cluster@NCs is 18 Ω (Figure 3d) while that for Ru(10%)@NCs, Ru(1.5%)@NCs, and commercial Pt/C catalysts are 38, 41, and 31 Ω, respectively. The lowest Rct value of Ru cluster@NCs reveals the fastest electron transfer and reaction kinetics on the interface of catalysts/electrolytes. The improvements in reaction kinetics may be ascribed to the strong interaction of Ru and the high graphitized carbon substrate. The ECSA value can be calculated using the double-layer capacitance (Cdl) and Cu under the potential deposition method (Cu UPD), (53,54) where the Cdl is determined to be linearly proportional to the number of active sites (Figures 3e and S13). After calculation from the equation of ECSA = Cdl/Cs (where the Cs value is the specific capacitance of the electrode under 0.5 M H2SO4 solution), (55) the ECSA of Ru cluster@NCs is 30.70 m2 g–1, which was larger than that of commercial Pt/C (29.67 m2 g–1), Ru(10%)@NCs (7.77 m2 g–1), and Ru(1.5%)@NCs (6.76 m2 g–1). The values agree with those measured by Cu UPD (Figure S14). Meanwhile, after the HER polarization curves normalize to the ECSA, Ru cluster@NCs further exhibit the superior activity for hydrogen production (Figure S15). Those results reveal that the homogeneity and high loading of Ru active sites on N-doped porous carbon nanoplates greatly improve the HER process under harsh conditions.
For the industrial application of an alternative catalyst, durability is another important parameter to evaluate its performance. (56) To verify the durability of Ru cluster@NCs, CV cycles with a fast scan rate at the potential range of −0.242 to 0.658 V vs RHE and chronoamperometry test were measured. The HER polarization curve of Ru cluster@NCs showed that after 5000 CV cycles in 0.5 M H2SO4 solution when the current density was 100 mA cm–2, its attenuation was about 10 mV (Figure 3f), which is significantly smaller than the attenuation of Pt/C (Figure S16). As shown in Figure S17, Ru cluster@NCs showed excellent durability for 12 h of long-term HER catalysis. Meanwhile, the TEM images and XRD pattern of Ru cluster@NCs after 5000 CV cycles showed that the original morphology is well-maintained (Figures S18 and S19), indicating remarkable stability. Furthermore, the XPS results after the HER long-term stability test demonstrated that the binding energy of Ru 3p slightly shifts negatively due to the metallic nature of Ru single atoms (Figure S20). The full XPS spectrum of Ru cluster@NCs shows that the atomic ratio of Ru, C, N, and O was Ru/C/N/O = 0.61:78.38:10.84:10.17 (Figure S20). The Raman spectrum after stability testing in 0.5 M H2SO4 showed that the ID/IG intensity ratio of Ru cluster@NCs was 1.04 (Figure S21), which agrees well with initial values, indicating the robust stability of Ru cluster@NCs. The HER performance of Ru cluster@NCs was superior to most Ru-based electrocatalysts reported recently (Figure 3g and Table S2), which should be attributed to the strong interaction of Ru and the carbon support as well as the high loading of Ru single atoms.
Moreover, the test was conducted in a 1.0 M PBS solution. The LSV curve is shown in Figure 4a and Ru cluster@NCs had excellent hydrogen evolution performance compared to commercial Pt/C, Ru(10%)@NCs, Ru(1.5%)@NCs, and N-doped porous carbon nanoplates. As shown in Figure 4b, the overpotential of Ru cluster@NCs was only 41 mV to achieve the 10 mA cm–2 current density in 1.0 M PBS solution while that for commercial Pt/C and Ru(10%)@NCs were 69 and 274 mV, respectively. The Tafel slopes are shown in Figure 4c, which were 42.81 mV dec–1 for Ru cluster@NCs, indicating a Tafel–Heyrovsky mechanism during the HER process in 1.0 M PBS solution. The TOF value of Ru cluster@NCs was 0.55 H2 s–1 when the overpotential was −0.1 V vs RHE, which was larger than that of commercial Pt/C (0.34 H2 s–1), Ru(10%)@NCs (0.27 H2 s–1), and Ru(1.5%)@NCs (0.06 H2 s–1) (Figure S22). The superior HER activity should be attributed to the faster electron transfer (Figure 4d) and larger ECSA values (Figures 4e, S23 and S24). After 12 h long-term stability tests, the current densities of Ru cluster@NCs maintain about 85.4% after retesting in 1.0 M PBS solution (Figure S25), superior to commercial Pt/C (34.7%) and other reported hydrogen evolution catalysts, which should be ascribed to the strong interaction between Ru clusters and the carbon support. Moreover, the TEM image of Ru cluster@NCs after long-term stability tests shows that there was no obvious aggregation of the Ru clusters on the carbon support (Figure S26), indicating higher mechanical stability due to the Ru cluster being firmly anchored to the carbon support by complexation. Additionally, the surface elemental analysis of Ru cluster@NCs after long-term stability tests was further discussed, in which the atomic ratio of Ru/C/N/O = 0.54:77.82:12.68:8.96, slightly changing with initials, and the Ru 3p spectrum showed its metallic nature (Figure S27). Furthermore, the overpotential slightly negative-shifted at 10 mA cm–2 after 5000 CV cycles for Ru cluster@NCs, further suggesting its outstanding stability (Figures 4f and S28). All of the above results indicated that Ru cluster@NCs not only had good hydrogen evolution performance but also possessed excellent stability in a 1.0 m PBS solution. Compared to the most recently reported HER catalysts in 1.0 M PBS solution, it can be found that Ru cluster@NCs show a lower overpotential at 10 mA cm–2 and a lower Tafel slope (Table S3).

3.3. DFT Computations of Ru Cluster@NCs
To achieve molecular-level insights into the excellent HER activity of Ru cluster@NCs, DFT calculations were performed to understand the strong interaction between metallic Ru active sites and the carbon support. Typical models were built to represent the Ru cluster@NCs and Ru(10%)@NCs (Figure 5a). It is noted that the electron accumulation on the heterointerface of metallic Ru active sites and the carbon support indicates a strong charge exchange and electronic tuning from Ru to N (Figure 5b), considering that there are three states for the HER pathway under acidic conditions, including the initial state of the H+ activation, the intermediate state of H* adsorption, and the final state of H2 production. Therefore, the Gibbs free energy (ΔGH*) of the intermediate state was calculated to describe the HER performance. (57) As shown in Figure 5c, the ΔGH* values of Ru(10%)@NCs (−0.24 eV) and Pt/C (−0.28 eV) are relatively lower than that of Ru cluster@NCs (−0.19 eV), indicating that the interaction between adsorbed hydrogen and Ru–N active centers on Ru cluster@NCs can be substantially weakened, thereby reducing the desorption energy barrier. In order to further explore the reason for the high intrinsic activity of the catalyst HER, the DOS curves of Ru cluster@NCs and Ru(10%)@NCs were calculated (Figure 5d), indicating that Ru cluster@NCs have a strong electron interaction between Ru and N in the HER process, which enhances electron transfer. In addition, compared to Ru(10%)@NCs (−0.736 eV), Ru cluster@NCs (−1.025 eV) exhibit a suitable d-band center value to promote water dissociation and adsorption and optimize the Ru–Had bond strength to obtain the optimal ΔGH* value, thereby accelerating the generation of H2. The strong charge exchange and hetero tuning of Ru cluster@NCs contribute to promoting the H* adsorption on the heterointerface due to the strong interaction between the Ru atoms and the carbon support leading to more positively charged Ru atoms. These results reveal that the electronic structure of Ru cluster@NCs promotes the H* adsorption, which facilitates the overall HER performance on Ru cluster@NCs.

4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In summary, we have developed a novel strategy for obtaining Ru nanoclusters on N-doped porous carbon nanoplates, which shows efficient and stable HER performance in acidic and neutral media. Structural characterization reveals that the existing interaction of Ru clusters and N-bonds enables Ru clusters to be firmly anchored on N-doped porous carbon nanoplates. These characteristics allow Ru cluster@NCs to possess abundant active sites, enhance charge exchange, and alter the electronic structure of Ru. Both experimental results and DFT calculations note that the strong combination of metallic Ru and the carbon support modulates electron redistribution, in which the interaction between adsorbed hydrogen and Ru–N active centers on Ru cluster@NCs can be substantially weakened to reduce the desorption energy barrier. This work opens up new opportunities to prepare hydrogen evolution catalysts and provides insights into the strong electronic coupling effect between metallic Ru and the carbon support, demonstrating superior HER performance with excellent activity and robust durability under harsh conditions.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
