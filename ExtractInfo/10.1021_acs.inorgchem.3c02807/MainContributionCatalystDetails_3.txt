 Based on the analysis of the supplied document, it does not appear to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses the synthesis and evaluation of Ru nanoclusters anchored on N-doped porous carbon nanoplates (Ru cluster@NCs) as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction, and does not mention propane dehydrogenation specifically.
