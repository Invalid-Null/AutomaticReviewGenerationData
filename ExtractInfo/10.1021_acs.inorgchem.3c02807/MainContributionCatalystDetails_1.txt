 Based on the details provided in the document, this does not appear to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) for converting propane to propylene. The document discusses the use of Ru nanoclusters anchored on N-doped porous carbon nanoplates as electrocatalysts for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It does not mention propane, propylene, PDH, or ODH.
