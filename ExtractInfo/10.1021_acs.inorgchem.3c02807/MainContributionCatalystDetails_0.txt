 Based on the provided document, this does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses a catalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction, not for converting propane to propylene. As such, I have indicated this is not relevant and have not provided any further details on the catalyst or process conditions.
