The given document does not relate to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on methane dry reforming to produce syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide), not the conversion of propane to propylene. Therefore, it is not relevant to extract details about a catalyst for propylene production.
