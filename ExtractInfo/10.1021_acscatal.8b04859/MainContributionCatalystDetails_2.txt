The document discusses the co-feeding of propane and furan for catalytic fast pyrolysis to produce aromatics, but does not specifically focus on propane dehydrogenation to propylene. While propane dehydrogenation occurs as an intermediate reaction, the main scientific contribution is enhancing aromatic yield from furan conversion rather than optimizing propane dehydrogenation performance. Therefore, this document does not seem directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation catalysis.
