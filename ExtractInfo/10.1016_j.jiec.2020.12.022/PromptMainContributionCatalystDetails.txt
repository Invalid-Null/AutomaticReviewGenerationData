Introduction
Light olefins such as ethylene, propylene and butenes/butadiene are the most commonly used feedstocks in the petrochemical industry. These are the building block for manufacturing wide range of consumer products with high demand. The common polymers and chemicals produced from light olefins include polyethylene, polypropylene, ethylene glycol, butadiene rubbers, acetic acid, acetones etc. The increasing world population and improving quality of human life have contributed to the steady rise in demand of these olefin derived products [1], [2], [3]. Among these olefins, propylene demand is expected to increase approximately by 4.5% by the end of year 2020 [2], [3]. The current global annual demand of propylene is approximately 1.54 million tons whiles the production is around 1.2 million tons. This statistics clearly show that there is a wide gap between demand and supply of propylene [4]. Therefore, there is a growing need to develop alternative technologies for production of propylene from various sources in order to meet the ever-increasing global demand.
Steam cracking of hydrocarbons and fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) of vacuum gas oil (VGO) are the two major conventional routes for the current supply of light olefins. On the other hand, dehydrogenation of light alkanes, metathesis and methanol to propylene have been considered to be the alternative approaches that can contribute to the additional olefin productions [5], [6], [7], [8]. In the conventional steam cracking process, the light olefins are produced by cracking of hydrocarbons in presence of steam. The common feedstocks for steam cracking are gas oil, naphtha and refinery gases. In this approach, saturated hydrocarbons are subjected to high temperatures and steam, which breakdowns the large hydrocarbons molecules into intermediates and partially remove hydrogen from the smaller hydrocarbon molecules to produce the light olefins (ethylene, propylene, butenes). Reaction temperature, steam to hydrocarbon ratio and residence time are the major reaction parameters for adjusting the selectivity of olefins during cracking. The thermal/steam cracking of hydrocarbons is a highly endothermic process that requires huge amount of energy for the conversion of saturated hydrocarbons into lighter olefins. The coke formation is a common issue in thermal/steam cracking due to the high reaction temperatures, which leads to intermittent plant shut down and resulting low productivity [9]. Unlike steam cracking, in FCC the light olefins are obtained as by-products of cracking of vacuum gas oil (VGO) producing lighter fuels. The FCC process also involved endothermic reactions, which requires high energy that is supplied by the combustion of the coke (deliberate) on the catalyst. Therefore, both the steam cracking and FCC are high energy density and thermodynamically limited processes [10], [11], [12].
In this regard, the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of lighter alkanes to olefins are more attractive, given the lower energy requirement and possibility of high product selectivity [13]. In ODH, the olefins are obtained by partial oxidation of hydrogen from the alkane chain. In case of long chain alkanes, it also involves sequential cracking of hydrocarbons followed by oxidation of the cracked intermediate into olefins [14]. The ODH/selective oxidation is thermodynamically feasible in presence of oxygen. It is an exothermic reaction — therefore, the energy demand is much lower than that of the cracking or dehydrogenation processes. However, the presence of oxygen may increase the risk of flammability and reduce the selectivity of olefins due to the complete oxidation of both feed alkanes and product olefins into CO2 and CO [15], [16], [17]. The issue of possible flammability and explosion can be addressed by using a safer and readily available alternative mild oxidant, such as CO2. The use of CO2 may also contribute to the solution of environmental chemistry in order to combat the challenge of CO2 emission and greenhouse gas effects. In this regard, there are studies available in the literature investigating the utilization of CO2 as a soft oxidant in different applications, including the minimization of the deep oxidation in selective oxidations [18], [19]. The ODH of alkane in the presence of CO2 also has additional advantage than the direct dehydrogenation of alkanes due to the involvement of the reverse water gas shift reaction (RWGS). It improves the equilibrium conversion by shifting the reaction favorable to the product side and also minimizes the formation coke via the Boudouard reaction [20]. The use of CO2 as a mild oxidant significantly enhances the selectivity of olefins by suppressing the deep oxidation reactions, although generally, the conversion is lower as compared to commercialized direct dehydrogenation process [21]. In addition to the aforementioned advantages, there are challenges of using CO2 as an oxidizing agent. CO2 is a stable molecule and the activation of CO bond requires high energy [22]. The use of catalyst generally helps to minimize the required energy for bond activation. In this regard, the transitional metals such as chromium, molybdenum, vanadium as well as other metals supported on other carriers such as zeolite, metal oxides and mesoporous materials have been investigated as potential catalysts for the activation of CO2 molecules during selective oxidation reactions [23], [24], [25], [26]. Among the above transitional metal oxides, chromium is the most widely used commercial catalyst for the ODH of propane. Nonetheless, chromia is known for causing health related complication in human as a result, there is the need to explore for other safe and suitable alternatives catalyst for ODH reactions [27], [28].
Alumina is one of the most commonly used metal oxides as catalyst support. This may be largely due to its chemical and mechanical resistance and enhanced metal dispersion as a results of high surface area. However, Al2O3 does not possess significant thermal stability, resulting in sintering of the deposited active metals at elevated temperatures. The acidic nature of alumina sometime contributes to the catalyst deactivation by coke formation. The incorporation of rare earth metal oxide such as La2O3 can improve the performance of alumina catalyst [29], [30]. Lanthanum oxide (La2O3) is an effective promoter and has been extensively investigated in the area of oxidative dehydrogenation of hydrocarbons such as propane, ethane, ethylbenzene to propylene, ethylene and styrene in the presence of CO2 as soft oxidant [31], [32], [33]. The incorporation of La2O3 in the catalyst support such as Al2O3 enhances the catalyst activity and stability by impeding the deposition of carbon on the catalyst surface as previously reported by Katta et al. [34] and Liu et al. [35]. Al-Sultan et al. [36] investigated the use of Au supported on sulfated La2O3 for the oxidative cracking of n-propane in a fixed tubular quartz reactor. The authors reported that they achieved a conversion of 40.6% and total olefin selectivity of 54.2%
Vanadium is one of the most widely studied metal as active phase as a result of potential high yield of olefins when loaded in proper quantity on a suitable support [37]. Catalyst system with vanadium oxide supported on metal oxides with high surface area such as Al2O3, SiO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 have been used extensively for oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes [15], [38], [39]. The high surface area improves the number of available active site to enhance catalytic activity. Calcination during the vanadium catalyst synthesis results in the formation of vanadium oxide, which interacts with the catalyst support to form MOV bond (M is the cation from of the catalyst support). The bond strength of the vanadium-support interaction is mainly influenced by nature of the support and coverage. Thin layers (monomers of dimers) of vanadate are formed when the loading is low, while moderately high vanadium loading leads to the formation of polyvanadate and monolayers in two dimensions. Much higher vanadia concentration may lead to the clusters of crystals of V2O5 [40], [41]. Several hypotheses have been proposed regarding the characteristics of the active site in the ODH of alkane. In the case of vanadium oxide, a number of authors [42], [43] have proposed the active site as the tetrahedral V5+ site for dehydrogenation whiles others suggest that the activity may be linked to the V5+/V4+ redox pair. The change in oxidation state of vanadium oxide during the ODH of propane was reported by Barbero et al. [44], which involves V5+ reducing to V4+ and then to V3+. The reduced form of the vanadium oxide can be reoxidized with oxygen [45]. The change was attributed to the Mars-van-Krevelen redox mechanism which is related to the lattice oxygen atoms [46]. In this mechanism the cleavage of the CH bond in the alkane is the rate determining step. The species that are formed in the ODH process can either desorb or adsorb leading to further oxidation to CO2. The deciding factors in this case are the rate of desorption of the olefin from catalyst surface and the ease of the catalyst reduction (binding energy of the lattice oxygen) [43].
Routray et al. [39] studied the effect of using oxide support such as Al2O3 and TiO2 as support for vanadium oxide for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. They found that vanadium loading did not affect the surface area of the catalyst sample significantly however, the H2-TPR analysis of the catalyst revealed that the catalyst with the Al2O3 support were difficult to reduce as compared to the catalyst with TiO2 support. The propylene yield for the TiO2 supported catalyst was higher than the Al2O3 supported catalyst at all reaction temperatures considered signifying the influence of support on catalyst performance. Jeon et al. [38] investigated the effect of the doping vanadium in to the Zr lattice for the ODH of propane. It was revealed that the incorporation of vanadium improved the catalyst activity twice as pure ZrO2. The superior catalytic activity was attributed the creation of extra Zr4+ cation that serves as the active site. Ascoop et al. [47] synthesized a series of catalyst with WOx–VOx supported on porous SiO2 for the ODH of propane in the presence of CO2 as a soft oxidant. Their studies suggested that CO2 is capable of oxidizing V2O3 to V2O4, play a significant role in the ODH of propane to propylene and suppressed the formation of coke on the catalyst. Rossetti et al. [45] synthesized VOx/SiO2 by flame pyrolysis technique for the ODH of propane. The best result from their work revealed that the 10 wt% V loading produced the highest yield under anaerobic condition with 80% propylene selectivity and 10% propane conversion. To the best of our knowledge, there is no studies reported in the open literature that investigated the use of CO2 as a mild oxidant in ODH of propane over VOx/La2O3-γAl2O3 catalysts.
Keeping the above into consideration, the present study has been focused on investigating CO2 assisted oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene using mesoporous alumna supported VOx catalysts. In this regard, VOX supported on mesoporous γ-Al2O3 and mixed La2O3-γAl2O3 with different La/Al ratios were developed by coprecipitation followed by incipient wetness impregnation technique. It is anticipated that this catalyst preparation approach will determine both the type and the fraction of VOx phases, acidity and the VOx reducibility. It is also expected that La will improve the thermal stability, adjust acidity/reducibility and limit nonselective oxygen reactions. In order to establish the significance of the proposed ODH catalyst, experimental runs were developed in a fluidized CREC Riser Simulator reactor. These experiments demonstrated the high propylene selectivity can be achieved using the synthesized VOx on alumina-based catalysts in presence of CO2 and under studied fluidized conditions.
Experimental
Chemicals
The catalyst was synthesized using chemicals such as aluminium nitrate nonahydrate (Al(NO3)3∙9H2O), lanthanum (III) nitrate hexahydrate (La(NO3)3∙6H2O), vanadium acetylacetonate (C10H14O5V) and ammonium carbonate ((NH4)2CO3). The chemicals were obtained from Sigma Aldrich with the exception of (NH4)2CO3 which was purchased from Fisher Limited.
Catalyst preparation
The catalyst supports comprising La2O3 and γAl2O3 in mass ratios of 1:3, 1:2 and 1:1 were prepared using the co-precipitation technique. In a typical synthesis as described in our previous work [1], a required amount of Al(NO3)3∙9H2O and La(NO3)3∙6H2O were mixed and dissolved in deionized water to from a uniform solution by constant stirring at 40 °C. A buffer solution made of (NH4)2CO3 and NH3∙H2O with a pH of approximately 8.5 was introduced dropwise in to the solution to cause precipitation. The mixture was aged at 100 °C for about 12 h under static conditions. Finally, the precipitated material was then dried for about 4 h at 100 °C prior to calcination at 750 °C for about 6 h. A reference support of pure γAl2O3 was synthesized with similar procedure as described above using Al(NO3)3∙9H2O.
The vanadia was incorporated on the catalyst support by an incipient wetness impregnation technique. Initially, a calculated amount of the vanadium precursor (C10H14O5V) was dissolved in toluene with volume that matches with the total pore volume of the support. The already prepared support was then added to the solution and stirred continuously for about 3 h. The mixture was then dried at 120 °C and calcined at 750 °C for 6 h. For all the synthesized catalyst, the VOx loading was kept constant at 10 wt%. The schematic diagram illustrating the step by step procedure involved in the synthesis of the catalyst is shown in Fig. 1. The final synthesized catalysts were identified as (i) VOx/γAl2O3, (ii) VOx/La2O3-γAl2O3 1:3, (iii) VOx/La2O3-γAl2O3 1:2 and (iv) VOx/La2O3-γAl2O3 1:1.

Catalyst characterization
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD)
The X-ray diffraction evaluation of the VOx/La2O3-γAl2O3 catalyst was carried out using a Rigaku Miniflex diffractometer to determine the crystalline nature of the synthesized material. The equipment is equipped with the nickel-filtered Cu–Kα radiation source (wavelength = 0.15406, 40 kV, 40 mA). The scanning was done at a ramp of 2° per minute at an angular speed of 0.02° per second in the 2θ range of 10−90°. The 2θ peaks of the material were identified using the database from the Joint committee on Powder Diffraction Standard (JCPDS) to determine the crystalline phases present on the catalyst.
SEM-EDX (Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy)
The surface morphology of the prepare catalyst comprising of different La2O3 to Al2O3 ratio was recorded using the JEOL-SEM analyzer. Similarly, the surface element analysis of the catalyst was studied by the application of the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Prior to the SEM-EDX analysis, the sample was initially dispersed on a stub covered with copper. The sample was then treated with gold to enhance the image quality by eliminating charge buildup. The experiment was conducted at ambient temperature.
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)
The FTIR spectroscopy of the synthesized catalyst was recorded by using a Nicolet 6700 Thermo Fischer Scientific unit. Prior to the FTIR experiment, about 3 mg of the prepared catalyst was thoroughly mixed approximately 400 mg of KBr to form a uniform powder. The mixture was then palletized in a self-supporting disc of about 1.2 cm before pretreating in a vacuum to remove impurities such as moisture. The FTIR data of each material was reported in the wavenumber range of 400–4000 cm−1.
N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
The BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) surface area and the textural properties of the synthesized material were measured by nitrogen adsorption isotherm analysis using a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 analyzer. In a typical experimental, about 0.3 g of the catalyst sample was placed in the sample tube and degassed under vacuum at 350 °C for 3 h prior to the N2 physisorption experiment. The nitrogen adsorption was performed in a liquid nitrogen bath at temperature of 77 K in a relative pressure range of 10−6 to 1. The BET method was used to determine the specific surface area the pore diameter and volume of the catalyst were determined from the BET isotherm by employing the Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method.
Laser Raman spectroscopy
The Raman spectroscopy experiment was carried out to determine the molecular structure of the synthesized catalyst. The laser Raman spectra of the prepared catalyst was obtained with the Yvon Jobin equipment that has a iHR320 Horiba spectroscopy with a CCD detector, which eliminates the elastic laser scattering. A green light laser source with a wavelength of 532 nm and an intensity of 50% was used for the excitation of the catalyst sample. The sample was dehydrated prior to spectra collection for 1 h at a temperature of 500 °C.
H2-temperature programmed reduction (H2-TPR)
The H2-TPR was carried out to determine the reduction temperature as well as the reducibility of the synthesized catalyst. This experiment was conducted at atmospheric pressure by employing the Micro-meritics AutoChem II 2920 analyzer. The TPR experiment was performed by loading about 0.1 g of the fresh catalyst in to a U tube-shaped quartz reactor and using a glass wool to hold the catalyst in place. The sample was then pre-treated with argon of at 500 °C at a flow rate of 50 ml/min for about 3 h to remove volatile components. Thereafter, the sample was cooled down to room temperature by flowing argon through the system. Following the pretreatment, the sample was subjected to a mixture of hydrogen and argon (10% H2/Ar) at a flow rate of 50 ml/min. Under this condition, the temperature of the system was increased gradually form ambient temperature to 800 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. In the process of temperature rise, the hydrogen starts to react with the metal oxide. The change in hydrogen in the effluent gas are detected by employing the TCD (thermal conductivity detector). The volume of hydrogen consumed was recorded by integrating the peaks under the curve due to variation in the amount of hydrogen consumed.
NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD)
The NH3-TPD analysis was carried out using the Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 in order to determine the total acidity and the type of acid sites available on the catalyst samples. About 0.1 g of the catalyst sample were placed in between two pieces of cotton wool in a U tube-shaped quartz container. The sample was then degassed at 300 °C for 2 h by circulating helium gas at 50 ml/min after which the system was cooled down to 120 °C. The catalyst was then saturated with ammonia by flowing a gas mixture of NH3 and helium (5% NH3/He) through the system at a flow rate of 50 ml/min. The saturation of the catalyst with ammonia was followed by the removal of the gas phase ammonia trapped in the system or unabsorbed on the catalyst surface by flushing the system with helium at 100 °C and a flow rate of 50 ml/min. The NH3 desorption experiment was carried out by increasing the system temperature to 750 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. This process led to the gradual desorption of ammonia that were chemisorbed to the catalyst as the temperature rises. The concentration of ammonia in the effluent gas was measured by the thermal conductivity detector that was processed further to produce a TPD profile.
ODH of propane in a CREC Riser Simulator
The CO2 assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to propylene was carried out in a CREC (Chemical Reaction Engineering Center) Riser Simulator that is operated to mimic the operation of an industrial twin bed fluidizable reactor [48]. The CREC Riser Simulator is designed as a bench scale mini fluidized bed reactor with a total capacity of 50 cm3 purposely for studying reaction kinetics and catalyst activity for ODH reactions. A schematic diagram showing the details and the major components of the CREC Riser Simulator reactor is presented in Fig. 2(a and b). The CREC riser is made up of the lower and upper sections, which aid in the loading and unloading of catalyst from the reactor chamber. An impeller is attached to the upper part of the reactor to controls fluidization of the catalysts. The lower section of the reactor houses a basket that holds the catalyst sample. The catalyst sample is held in the reactor basket by a pair of porous grids that are positioned at the ends of the basket. Upon rotation of the impeller (maximum speed of 7000 rpm), the reactant gas is forced in to the catalyst chamber causing the fluidization of the solid catalyst for efficient mass transfer [49], [50]. The CREC Riser Simulator functions in connection with other components such the gas chromatography (GC), vacuum box, temperature controllers and pressure regulators.

Fig. 2. (a) Overview of the CREC Riser Simulator illustrating the details of the reaction section [53]. (b) Schematic diagram of CREC Riser Simulator setup [53].
Prior to the analysis, an appropriate amount of the catalyst sample (maximum 1 g) was loaded in to the catalyst chamber and the upper and lower section of the reactor were tightened together. The system was then flushed with argon to remove impurities such as oxygen gas from the system. Subsequently, the system was been heated to the required temperature as the degassing process was taking place. The heating process and the argon flow was halted as the system temperature attained equilibrium at the required temperature set point. This is followed by the reduction of the pressure inside the vacuum box to 20.7 kPa by using a vacuum pump. The impeller was then turned on and the feed was introduced in to the reactor by using an air-tight syringe. As the reaction proceeds, the pressure dynamics within the reactor was registered with the aid of the pressure transducer. Initially when the feed was introduced into the reactor, the pressure increased as a result of the increase in the number of moles of products generated in the ODH reaction. The isolation valve between the reactor and the vacuum box was released at the end of the required reaction time, which reduces the pressure of the reactor to equal that of the vacuum box. This sudden pressure drop allows the reactant/products to be instantaneously transferred to the vacuum box without further reaction. Finally, the product was transferred to the online GC (Agilent 7890A) equipped with a flame ionized detector (FID) (HP AL/S 8 μm with dimension 25 m × 0.32 mm) to detect C3H8, C3H6, C2H6, C2H4, CH4 and thermal conductivity detector (TCD) to detect CO, CO2, CH4 and H2 [51], [52]. The performance of the catalyst was based on propane conversion, propylene selectivity and yield were calculated using the following:

Results and discussion
XRD
The diffraction pattern of the γ-Al2O3 support and the supported vanadium oxide catalyst are presented in Fig. 3. The XRD of γ-Al2O3 sample displays three distinct peaks at the 2θ angles of 36.5, 46.5 and 67° [54], [55]. The three peaks corresponding to the crystalline phase of γ-Al2O3 appear in the rest of the catalysts with decreasing peak intensities as the content of lanthanum in the support increases. The broad peak at 2θ of 29° is attributed to lanthanum oxide, which increased in intensity as the amount of lanthanum increased [56], [57]. It can be observed that no diffraction peak was detected in relation to the vanadia crystal phase, indicating an excellent dispersion of vanadium over the La2O3–γ-Al2O3 support. Generally, particles smaller than 3 nm are not detectable by XRD [58], suggesting that the vanadia species could exist as small crystalline that the XRD could not detect [59].

SEM-EDX
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the energy dispersive X-ray experiment were performed to analyze the morphology and elemental distribution on the surface of the catalyst. Fig. 4(a–d) shows the SEM images of γ-Al2O3, VOx/γ-Al2O3, VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 (1:2) and VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 (1:1) respectively. In general, it can be observed that all the samples consisted of particles that appear to be irregular in shape and size. Fig. 4(a) shows the image of bare alumina support with no lanthanum incorporation which appears to be heterogeneous with uneven particle size. A similar observation was made for the samples with La inferring that the La addition did not change the catalyst morphology. With the impregnation of vanadium oxide, a thin layer was formed over the support as can be seen in Fig. 4(b–d). The presence of vanadium was confirmed by the EDX analysis in Fig. 4(f). The layer increases and forms small agglomerations as the amount of lanthanum increases. Again, the SEM images shows that the vanadium oxide was well dispersed over the support. This may create enough contact area and selective active site for effective adsorption and desorption of both reactant and products in the ODH reaction [60]. The EDX analysis was conducted to confirm the elements on the surface of the catalyst. Fig. 4(e and f) shows the elemental distribution on the surface of the synthesized catalyst.

FTIR
Fig. 5 reports the FTIR spectra of γ-Al2O3, VOx/γ-Al2O3 and VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 catalysts with varying concentration of La2O3. The analysis of all the samples was done in the range of 400 – 4000 cm-1 wavenumbers where vibrational mode of solid may be adsorbed. All the samples show a narrow peak at 1650 cm−1 and broad between wavenumbers of 3250 cm−1 and 3750 cm−1. These peaks are attributed to the vibrational bond of the HOH or the hydroxyl group from the water adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst support [55], [61]. It is worth mentioning that all the catalyst sample exhibit a spectrum that is almost similar. The minimal interaction between the catalyst support and the active site may account for the insignificant shift in band position [9]. Al-O and VOx are assigned to FTIR peaks at band below 1100 cm−1. In addition, the ban at 830 cm−1 is associated with the vibration of VOV bond bridge which can be seen more clearly on VLA (1:2) and VLA (1:1).

XRF and nitrogen adsorption
The XRF analysis was used to quantify elemental composition of the catalyst sample after synthesis (Table 1). One can see that the vanadium loading and Al/La ratio are closed to the targeted values.

The textural properties (nature of the pore size and volume distribution, porosity) of the catalyst were measured by nitrogen adsorption isotherm analysis. Fig. 6(a) and (b) display the N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm for VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 with varying lanthanum oxide and their corresponding pore size distribution, respectively. Table 2 summarizes the textural properties of different catalyst samples under investigation. From Fig. 6(a), it can be observed that in line with IUPAC gas adsorption/desorption classifications, all the catalyst samples under investigation exhibited a type IV isotherm with capillary condensation at relatively high relative pressures. All the catalyst samples exhibit the H2 type hysteresis loop with a bottleneck-like constriction. This clearly describes the mesoporosity and a nitrogen monolayer adsorption on the catalyst samples [62]. The monolayer coverage can be seen to extend beyond a relative pressure of about 0.6, which is an indication of a well dispersed active site [56], [63]. The BET surface area of the catalyst samples under study were found by N2 adsorption isotherm analysis. It can be seen from Table 2 that the total BET surface area of the catalyst without La2O3 loading (VOx/γ-Al2O3) was 178.0 m2/g, the highest surface area recorded. The surface area decreased significantly as the amount of lanthanum oxide added to the support increases. BET surface area of 98.1, 72.3 and 46.8 m2/g were recorded for VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 (1:3), VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 (1:2), VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 (1:1) respectively in the order of increasing lanthanum oxide content. A similar trend was observed for the total pore volume of all the catalyst samples. This decrease in the catalyst surface area may be assigned to the La2O3 species entering and blocking of the mesopores of the alumina support. This phenomena were confirmed by the increase in the average pore distribution where the average pore size shift from 7.3 nm to 13.4 nm for VOx/γ-Al2O3 and VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 (1:1) catalyst samples respectively. Interestingly, the incorporation of small amount of lanthanum (3−5 wt%) leads to an increase in the surface area as found by some researchers [64], [65]. However, in this work, we found that incorporating more than 10% lanthanum oxide decreases the surface area of the catalyst. A similar observation was made by Lu et al. [66] who suggested that the textural properties of the catalyst material depends on the loading lanthanum oxide species.

The Barret–Joyner–Halenda (BJT) technique was used in the pore size distribution analysis as shown in Fig. 6(II). One can see form the figure that the pore size distribution of VOx/γ-Al2O3 and VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 (1:3) were mainly center around 7.5 nm. For VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 (1:2), the pore dimeter was mainly clustered around 11.0 nm whiles VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 (1:1), the catalyst with the highest lanthanum content possessed pore diameters that were centered at two positions, 11.0 and 22.7 nm. This shows that as the lanthanum incorporation in the support increased, the pore diameter of the synthesized catalyst was observed to increase. The non-uniform pore-size distribution on VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 (1:1) catalyst may due particle aggragation observed in the SEM analysis confirming that lanthanum influenced the textural properties at varying degrees depending on the amount incorporated in to the alumina matrix. All the average pore diameter are within the IUPAC range of 2−50 nm corresponding to mesoporous materials which further confirms the mesoporosity of the synthesized material [67], [68].
Laser Raman spectroscopy
The Raman spectra is a technique that is versatile and powerful for vanadium oxide characterization. Fig. 7 shows the Raman spectra of the four series of catalyst with different La2O3 loading recorded between 100 and 1100 cm−1 obtained at room temperature. The surface concentration as well as the vanadium oxide loading affects the appearance of VOX spectra [69]. Al-Ghamdi et al. reported that at 5% vanadium loading, only monovanadate species at 1033 cm−1 were detected suggesting that VOX species were present as isolated monovanadate whiles at 7% and above vanadium loading, the spectra indicated the existence of both monovanadate and polyvanadate species [70]. The narrow band between 1010−1035 cm−1 is attributed to the VO bond stretching mode which is an indication of isolated monovanadate surface species [59], [71]. The band in the range of 200−600 cm−1 is associated with the vibration of crystalline VOX and band at 995 cm−1 is linked to isolated VOX. As a result of the high vanadium loading on the support, all the catalyst samples whether promoter or un-promoted display peaks that are sharp within the range of crystalline V2O5. This observation is in agreement with that of Elbadawi et al., that at high metal loading normally above 10 wt%, poly-vanadate species are formed [72]. The broad peaks in the range of 700–1030 cm-1−945 cm−are attribute to two stretching of mode (i) 945−1030 cm−1 relating to VO and (ii) 670–945 is ascribed to polyvanadate species [73], [74]. The rest of the bands emerging at 180, 235, 325, 520, 520 and 995 cm−1 may be ascribed to the various vibration bridging of VOV bonds of bulk V2O5 crystal [75], [76]. For samples with relative high lanthanum content, broad band with peak centered at approximately 900 cm−1 was observed which may be associated to the bridging of V-O-Al bond that connects the surface of the vanadium to the support [76].

H2-TPR
The H2-TPR experiments were conducted to investigate the redox behavior of the vanadium oxide deposited on the mixed oxide support. In the context of present gas phase oxygen free ODH of propane, H2-TPR is an important catalyst characterization technique as it provides information about the reducibility and regeneration ability of the catalyst as expected during the actual ODH reaction with propane (Eqs. (4) and (5)).
(4)
H2-TPR: V2O5 + 2H2 → V2O3 + 2 H2 O
(5)
ODH of propane: C3H8 + ½ V2O5 → C3H6 + H2O + ½V2O3
Therefore, both the TPR (Eq. (4)) and ODH of propane (Eq. (5)) reduce V2O5 to V2O3. The reduced catalyst can be re-oxidized in air (O2) by circulating to the regenerator or by co-feeding a soft oxidizing agent such as CO2 (Eq. (6)).
(6)
Catalyst re-oxidation: V2O3 + O2 (or CO2) → V2O5
In addition, H2-TPR analysis also indicates the temperature range of catalyst activation and amount of available lattice oxygen for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. Fig. 8 displays the TPR profiles of the VOx based catalysts synthesized for this investigation. One can clearly see the existence of one distinctive peak for each catalyst indicating the reduction of V5+ to V4+ species as where V2O5 reduces to V2O3 [59]. The sample VOx/γ-Al2O3 without La2O3 content exhibited a reduction peak at 425 °C, the lowest among the four series of catalyst whiles VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 (1:3), VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 (1:2), VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 (1:1) catalyst displayed maximum peaks at 475, 476 and 500 °C respectively. It can be deduced from the analysis that there is a slight shift of the TPR maximum peak temperatures towards elevated temperatures as the amount of La2O3 added to the support increases suggesting that the reduction of VOx becomes difficult as the La content increases. Hence, the catalyst with high content of La2O3 exhibited the formation of a monomeric species, which is more stable and required higher temperatures to be reduced. This deduction clearly indicates that the presence of La2O3 in the catalyst tend to decrease the catalyst ability to reduce easily as can be seen in Table 3. The actual quantity of H2 uptake was calculated by integrating the area under the H2-TPR curves. The total amount of H2 consumed and the peak reduction temperature is reported in Table 3. The variation in the H2 uptake can be attribute the primarily to the different quantity of La2O3 added to the support. It is interesting to note that the addition of La2O3 increases the stability of the catalyst by decreasing the VOx of reduction ability. Liu at al. [77] reported similar observation in their work. They noted that the incorporation of La shifted the reduction maxima to higher temperature regions.

NH3-TPD
NH3-TPD technique is among the common techniques that is widely used to analyze the nature of acid site, the metal support interaction and total acidity of a catalyst. Besides the redox property analysis, the surface acidity forms an important aspect of vanadium oxide supported catalyst that can be used to determine the catalyst activity. This is governed by the structure of the vanadium oxide species on the catalyst surface and the nature of the support used. Thus, the relation between the structure of the supported vanadium oxide and the surface acidity is key to understanding the ODH process [78]. Fig. 9 shows the TPD profile of catalyst with and without lanthanum oxide. From Table 4, the order of the catalyst acidity is noted to be VOx/γ-Al2O3 > VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 (1:3) > VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 (1:2) > VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 (1:1). The distribution of the acidity of the catalyst change slightly with the addition of La2O3 as observed by Cam et al. [79]. In general, all the catalyst samples exhibited two broad peaks at approximately 100–350 °C and 530–700 °C indicating the lower temperature region and the higher temperature region relating to acid sites described as weak/moderate and strong respectively. It can be observed that there was a decrease in the area corresponding to the weak acid site as the La2O3 incorporation increased. Similarly, the incorporation of La2O3 decreased the lower peak temperature from 190 °C to approximately 160 °C. However, the area under the curve corresponding to strong acid site increased slightly as the amount of La2O3 incorporation increased. The decrease in the weak acid site is due to the neutralization of the acid sites on the gamma alumina. The increase in the strong acid site as the amount of lanthanum increases may be attributed to the synergetic effect of La2O3, Al2O3 and VOx leading to the increase in strong acid site of the redox catalyst. Adnan et al. [80] made similar observation in their work when they modified Al2O3 with La2O3 for chemical looping combustion application. Regarding the total acidity, it can be seen from Table 4 that the total acidity of the synthesized catalyst decreases with increase in the amount of lanthanum oxide in the support. This is an indication that clearly shows that the addition lanthanum oxide significantly increase the basic site of the catalyst that may improves the CO2 adsorption capacity [81], [82].

ODH of propane with fluidized VOX catalysts
The catalytic ODH of propane using VOX-based catalysts were performed in a fluidized CREC Riser Simulator with and without presence of CO2. The experiments were conducted using 0.2 g of the catalyst sample at four different temperature levels (525, 550, 575 and 600 °C) and for a same reaction period of 30 s. The reactions were limited to 600 °C in order to avoid non-catalytic thermal reactions, which provides mainly undesired cracking products. Table 5 presents the summary of the preliminary catalyst evaluation results with and without CO2 co-feed into the reactor. The major products of the reaction as propylene and ethylene whiles methane, ethane, CO2 and CO are the minor products. All reactions were carried out in triplicates to ensure reliability and reproducibility. The carbon balance was evaluated based on CO, CO2, methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene and the carbon deposited on the catalyst surface to be in the range of ±5%.

*CO2: selectivity of CO2 was estimated after inlet CO2 was deducted from outlet CO2.
To identify the role of CO2 in the ODH of propane, two sets of separate experiments were carried out — (i) single injection of propane with and without CO2, in which the catalysts were re-oxidized with air after each ODH run and (ii) multiple propane injection reactions without catalyst regeneration with air. The multiple propane injection reactions experiments allowed us to further investigate the role of CO2 on product selectivity and in-situ catalyst regeneration. In this approach, the catalyst was completely reduced by successive injection of propane. Following the complete catalyst reduction, CO2 was co-fed with propane to demonstrate the influence of CO2 on catalyst re-oxidation, propane conversion and product selectivity.
The single runs experiments are further divided in to two sub reactions: (a) ODH of propane without CO2 — to investigate the interaction of propane with a completely oxidized VOx-based catalysts in a set of reaction/re-oxidation cycle (b) ODH of propane in the presence of CO2 — to study the interaction between propane, CO2 and a fully oxidized catalyst in a set of reaction/regeneration cycle.
ODH of propane in absence of CO2
In absence of CO2, the source of oxygen for the activation of the CH bond of propane is mainly the lattice sites of the VOx supported catalysts [83]. Fig. 10(a) displays the propane conversion data for both the La modified and unmodified VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. Generally, the propane conversion over all the catalysts displayed a linear relationship with temperature. For instance, the propane conversion over VOx/γ-Al2O3 increased from 55% to 77%, as the reaction temperature was raised from 525 to 600 °C. The continuous increase in propane conversion with temperature over all the catalysts can be attributed to activation of the lattice oxygen at higher reaction temperature (as observed in the H2-TPR analysis), which easily interact with CH bond of the propane and oxidized them into products (both desired and undesired). The higher reaction temperatures were also favorable for the activation CH bonds, which enhance the propane conversion. It was reported that the rate limiting step in the ODH of propane was the activation of the CH bond [84]. Catalyst VOx/γ-Al2O3 without lanthanum displayed the highest propane conversion at all reaction temperatures as compared to the rest of the catalysts evaluated. This observation is consistent with the results from the H2-TPR and the data from the BET surface area. The VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst has the ability to reduce easily as compared with the lanthanum containing catalyst as shown in the TPR analysis results. This indicates that the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst has the tendency to release more lattice oxygen for CH activation. On the other hand, the highest propane conversion of 75% was achieved over VOx/La2O3-γAl2O3 (1:2) at 600 °C. This may be attributed to cracking and over oxidation of propane to undesired products due to strong propane adsorption on the basic site of the catalyst.

(d) Effect of temperature on C3H6 yield (reaction time = 30 s, catalyst loading = 0.2 g, volume of propane injected = 2.0 ml).
The variation of catalyst surface area due La modification (as seen in nitrogen adsorption isotherm analysis) also have significant influence on the propane conversion (Fig. 10(b)). The propane conversion decreased as the surface area of the catalysts decreased due to the additional amount of La. This indicates that the decrease in surface area have affected the number of active sites available for propane adsorption for the ODH reaction. Zhang et al. [85] also reported that the increase in the lanthanum content have a negative impact on the catalytic property for propane dehydrogenation. A similar observation was reported by Liu et al. [86] where they noticed that the hydrocarbon conversion decreases with increasing lanthanum incorporation.
One can observe from Fig. 10(c and d) that the propylene selectivity and yields declined for all the catalyst investigated as reaction temperature increases. The selectivity of propylene over VOx/La2O3-γAl2O3 (1:3) decreased from 85 to 30% in the temperature range of 525–600 °C. Similarly, the propylene selectivity declined from 74 to 34% over VOx/γAl2O3 in the same temperature range. The propylene selectivity of the lanthanum promoted catalysts were higher than the VOx/γAl2O3 catalyst at 525 and 575 °C. However, at 600 °C the propylene selectivity of VOx/γAl2O3 was slightly higher (Fig. 10(c)). From the TPR results, it is clear that the addition of lanthanum to the catalyst support decreases the ability of the catalyst to reduce easily. This implies that the incorporation of lanthanum helped to control the release of free lattice oxygen, which is responsible for deep oxidation of olefins via secondary reaction. Furthermore, the introduction of rare earth metals such as lanthanum modifies the acidity of the catalyst (NH3-TPD analysis, Fig. 9) which decreases the readsorption of olefin products such as ethylene and propylene that are basic in nature. This phenomena favors the selectivity of propylene as it facilitates the desorption of olefin that may otherwise have been oxidized to form undesired COx (CO2 and CO) as a result of readsorption [87]. The decline in the propylene yield as the reaction temperature increases was largely affected by the propylene selectivity. At elevated reaction temperatures, the ODH of propane over the synthesized catalysts appears to favor excessive oxidation of hydrocarbons to form COx.
Positive impact of CO2 on ODH of propane
In order to ascertain the effect of CO2, the ODH of propane experiments were carried out by co-feeding propane with CO2 at different reaction temperatures. After each run, the catalyst was re-oxidized by circulating air through the catalyst bed. Fig. 11(a–c) shows the results of the interaction of propane with VOx/γ-Al2O3 at different reaction temperature and at constant reaction time of 30 s in the presence of CO2 as a mild oxidant. Similar to the results from the ODH of propane without CO2 in the previous section, it can be observed that the propane conversion generally increased linearly with temperature (Fig. 11(a)). This can be assigned to the proliferation of lattice oxygen at elevated temperatures that are responsible for the CH bond cleavage at elevated temperatures. Fig. 11(a) shows the influence of temperature on the conversion of propane over catalyst VOx/γ-Al2O3 with and without CO2 as a mild oxidant. At 525 °C, the propane conversion in the absence of CO2 was found to be 20% higher than in the presence of CO2. This low propane conversion recorded at 525 °C in presence of CO2 may be assigned to the low activation of CO2 at this temperature. The CO2 in this case competes with the propane for adsorption space thereby decreasing the number of active site available for propane adsorption for ODH reaction. Takahara et al. [88] and Sandupatla et al. [27] reported a similar observation in their work. Ogonowski et al. [89] and Sun et al. [90] previously reported similar behavior in their work. They noted that at temperatures below 550 °C, CO2 acted as an inert gas and was not activated. Thermodynamically, CO2 is a stable molecule and requires high temperatures to activate the CO bond due the high ΔG and ΔS at low reaction temperatures [22]. However, as the reaction temperatures increased form 550–600 °C, a higher propane conversion was achieved in the presence of CO2 due to adequate CO2 activation for ODH reaction. In this regard, Burri et al. [91] reported that the increasing reaction temperature enhanced the CO2 activation, which further improves the propane conversion. The propylene selectivity and yield as presented in Fig. 11(b and c) shows that, ODH in a CO2 environment enhanced significantly. The enhancement of the propylene yield can be combination of several factors associated with the introduction of CO2 with feed. In order to better understanding the effects of CO2, one should consider the following possible reactions steps during the ODH of propane with lattice oxygen of the catalysts with and without presence of CO2:

Based on the above reactions, the influence of CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane can be summarized as follows: (i) the direct reaction of CO2 with propane in oxidative dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene (Eq. (14)). (ii) Shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium of the complete oxidation reactions of propane/olefins to minimize CO2 formation. The introduction of CO2 facilitates (by reversed water–gas shift reaction (RWGS), (Eq. (16)) the consumption of hydrogen produced in dehydrogenation of propane reaction (Eq. (15)). Therefore, the RWGS enhanced the catalyst performance by shifting the equilibrium of dehydrogenation reaction (Eq. (15)) to the product side thereby enhancing the propylene selectivity and yields. (iii) regeneration of reduced catalyst — CO2 also acts as a soft oxidant to reoxidize the reduced catalyst in-situ during the ODH process (Eq. (19)). The re-oxidation of the partially reduced catalyst is necessary as it plays an essential role in the abstraction of hydrogen from the propane to form propylene. (iv) Limitation of coke formation by Boudouard reaction (Eq. (17)), which is confirmed by coke analysis on the spent catalysts. In addition to the above, the positive impact of CO2 in the reaction feed on the propylene selectivity (Fig. 11(b)) is also attributed to the ability of CO2 to block non-selective sites of the catalyst which are responsible for the deep oxidation of olefins [1].
To establish the above explanation, further experiments were performed with successive propane reaction over catalyst VOx/γAl2O3 without regeneration of the catalyst after each reaction followed by combined CO2 and propane injection as described in in details in the next section.
Successive propane injection: catalyst stability with and without CO2
In the successive injection experiment, the VOx/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was progressively reduced without regeneration in a six consecutive propane injection. For the 7th and 8th reactions, CO2 was added to the propane feed in different ratios. This was done to understand the role of CO2 in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with CO2 on a reduced catalyst. The operation conditions were; reaction temperature 550 °C, reaction contact time = 30 s, catalyst loading = 0.2 g.
One can observe from Fig. 12 that the propane conversion was maximum at 55% for the first injection and then decreased progressively in the subsequent injections to about 25% after the 6th injection. In the first six reactions, all the product of reaction were generated mainly by the C3H8 oxidation with the lattice oxygen of the VOx since there was no gas phase oxygen as reported by Kondratenko et al. [83]. The propylene selectivity dropped slightly from 73% for the first injection to 63% after the 4th injection and then increased gradually to 67% after the 6th reaction. The increase in propylene selectivity and decrease in propane conversion was a result of the depletion of the liable lattice oxygen of the catalyst since the catalyst was not regenerated in between reactions. The addition of CO2 to the propane (C3H8:CO2 = 1:2) in the reaction 7, increased the propane conversion to 31% and propylene selectivity to almost 75%. Again, a further increase in the amount of CO2 added to propane (C3H8:CO2 = 1:3) after the 8th reaction did not have much effect of the propane conversion, however, there was a slight rise in propylene selectivity. The enhancement in the catalytic performance in the presence of CO2 may be attribute to the replacement of selective lattice oxygen site that was depleted as a result of the consecutive reactions without regeneration, similar observation was made by Ascoop et al. [47]. From our observation, we deduce that, CO2 partially oxidizes the reduced catalyst to improve the catalytic performance. The propane conversion after the 7th and 8th reaction were lower than the initial conversion (reaction one) which suggest that the CO2 could only partially oxidized the reduced catalyst. The enhancement of the catalytic performance may also be attributed to the reverse water gas shift reaction (reaction 16) which involves the extraction of the H2 from the direct dehydrogenation reaction. This shifts the equilibrium of the reaction to the product side thereby increasing the propylene selectivity. Moreover, the CO2 can also minimize the effect of coke deposition over the catalyst by carbon gasification that reduces catalyst deactivation.

Fig. 12. Propane conversion and selectivity of propylene over VOx/γ-Al2O3 in consecutive propane injection without catalyst regeneration. The first 6 consecutive injections were propane only, the 7th and 8th were C3H8 with CO2 in ratio 1:2 and 1:3 respectively.
Table 6 compares our catalyst performance to a list of other catalysts that have been used for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 as a soft oxidant. The propane conversion, propylene selectivity and yield were presented along with the reactor system used. One can observe from the table that the choice of support as well as the active metal influences the propylene selectivity and yield. It can also be seen that temperature and C3H8/CO2 plays important role in the enhancement of the catalyst activity and therefore should be selected carefully as the optimum conditions vary for each catalyst system. The chromium-based catalysts are well known to be active for the ODH of short-chained alkane to olefins. However, there is the need to replace them with suitable, economically viable and environmentally benign active metals due to the health and environmental issues associated with its use. In this work, we have successfully synthesized and demonstrated the suitability of environment friendly vanadium-based catalyst for the ODH of propane with CO2 as a soft oxidant. The promising results of the VOx-based catalysts could be a good basis for further tuning the catalysts in terms of composition, texture and morphology to secure even higher propylene selectivity at appreciable propane conversion level. The present circulating fluidized bed ODH process would also provide superior mixing between the feed and catalysts to eliminate possible mass transfer limitations and deliver good temperature control. It also provide the flexibility of catalyst regeneration.

Proposed reaction mechanism for ODH of propane with CO2
The reaction mechanism proposed for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in the presence of CO2 as mild oxidant based on our work is presented in Fig. 13. The Scheme-I consists of possible reactions in the ODH of propane with CO2, as described in Eqs. (14), (15), (16), (17) as detail steps. RWGS reaction improves the propane yield by shifting the reaction equilibrium to the product side. Scheme-II describes the ODH of propane using the lattice oxygen of the vanadium-based catalyst. The catalyst reduced via this means and the ODH process switches to direct dehydrogenation, which decreases the activity of the catalyst. The presence of CO2 as shown in Scheme-II regenerate the catalyst to enhance the ODH reaction.

Conclusion
This study investigated the catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane to propylene using CO2 as soft oxidant. In this regard, fluidizable VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 catalysts have been synthesized, characterized and evaluated in a fluidized CREC Riser Simulator. Following are the conclusion of this study:
(i)
The synthesized (co-precipitation of γ-Al2O3 or La2O3-γ-Al2O3, incipient impregnation of VOx) catalysts were mesoporous, as indicated by the H2 type hysteresis loop with a bottleneck-like constriction of the N2-adsorption isotherms of the catalysts.
(ii)
The incorporation of La decreased the specific surface area of the catalysts due to the blockage of the pores by additional La in the support.
(iii)
Both the VOx/γ-Al2O3 and VOx/La2O3-γ-Al2O3 catalysts reduced in a single step, as indicated by the H2-TPR profiles, indicating the formation of mainly homogeneous VOx phases. The introduction of La decreased the reducibility of the synthesiszed catalysts.
(iv)
The total acidity of the catalysts decreased with increasing La contents in the catalysts, as shown by NH3-TPD analysis.
(v)
In ODH of propane, VOx/γ-Al2O3 showed the highest propane conversion at all the reaction temperatures due to higher specific surface area, acidity and reducibility of this catalyst.
(vi)
The introduction of CO2 increased both propane conversion and propylene selectivity, indicating the contribution of CO2 as a mild oxidant in direct interaction with the hydrocarbons and re-oxidized the reduced catalysts.
(vii)
The enhanced olefins selectivity with CO2 was ascribed to the masking of the non-selective sites of the catalysts by adsorption of CO2.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
