Propane Dehydrogenation on Ga2O3-Based Catalysts: Contrasting Performance with Coordination Environment and Acidity of Surface Sites

Abstract
α-Ga2O3, β-Ga2O3, and γ-Ga2O3 as well as the silica-supported catalysts γ-Ga2O3/SiO2, β-Ga2O3/SiO2, and Ga(NO3)3-derived Ga/SiO2 were prepared, characterized, and evaluated for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) at 550 °C. The coordination environment and acidity of surface sites in stand-alone and SiO2-supported Ga2O3 catalysts were studied using FTIR, 15N dynamic nuclear polarization surface-enhanced NMR spectroscopy (15N DNP SENS), and DFT modeling of the adsorbed pyridine probe molecule. The spectroscopic data suggest that the Lewis acidic surface Ga sites in γ-Ga2O3 and β-Ga2O3 (the latter obtained from colloidal nanocrystals of γ-Ga2O3 via thermal treatment at 750 °C) are similar, except that β-Ga2O3 contains a larger relative fraction of weak Ga3+ Lewis acid sites. In contrast, α-Ga2O3 features mostly strong Lewis acid sites. This difference in surface sites parallels their difference in catalytic activities: i.e., weak Lewis acid surface sites are more abundant in β-Ga2O3 relative to α-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3 and the increased relative abundance of weak Lewis acidity correlates with a higher initial catalytic activity in PDH, 0.41 > 0.28 > 0.14 mmol C3H6 m–2 (Ga2O3) h–1 at 550 °C, for respectively β-, α-, and γ-Ga2O3 with initial propene selectivities of 86, 83, and 88%. Dispersion of γ-Ga2O3 or β-Ga2O3 on a silica support introduces strong as well as abundant weak Brønsted acidity to the catalysts, lowering the PDH selectivity. The γ-Ga2O3/SiO2 catalyst was slightly more active than β-Ga2O3/SiO2 in PDH (Ga normalized activity) with initial propene formation rates of 11 and 9 mol C3H6 mol Ga–1 h–1 (sel = 76 and 73%, respectively). However, these catalysts deactivated by ca. 55% within 100 min time on stream (TOS) due to coking. In contrast, Ga/SiO2, with mostly tetracoordinated surface Ga sites and abundant, strong Brønsted acid sites, gave a lower activity and selectivity in PDH (3.5 mol C3H6 mol Ga–1 h–1 and 49%, respectively) but showed no deactivation with TOS. DFT calculations using a fully dehydroxylated oxygen-deficient model β-Ga2O3 surface show that tetra- and pentacoordinated Ga Lewis acid sites bind pyridine more strongly than tricoordinated Ga sites and a higher relative fraction of strong Lewis acid sites correlates with increased coking. Overall, our results indicate that weakly Lewis acidic, tricoordinated Ga3+ sites are likely driving the superior PDH activity of β-Ga2O3.

1. Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
On-purpose propene production technologies are currently undergoing a surge of research interest, primarily driven by the increasing consumption of propene, the declining supply of propene from naphtha crackers, and environmental concerns associated with the use of the CrOx/Al2O3 propane dehydrogenation catalyst in the Catofin process (PDH, Scheme 1, eq 1). (1,2) Supported catalysts based on Ga2O3 are considered as a viable alternative to CrOx-derived catalysts. (3)
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Pathways for Propane Dehydrogenation and Cracking
Tetracoordinated Lewis acidic Ga3+ sites (4,5) were proposed as active sites for PDH on Ga2O3-based catalysts. (1,6) For instance, a higher activity of monoclinic β-Ga2O3 (the thermodynamically stable gallia polymorph) relative to hexagonal α-Ga2O3 was ascribed to the higher ratio of tetrahedral vs octahedral Ga sites present in bulk β-Ga2O3 (GaIV:GaVI = 1:1), (7) in contrast to the absence of bulk GaIV sites in α-Ga2O3, (8−10) which likely affects the nature of the surface sites. (11) Spinel-type γ-Ga2O3, a polymorph with a highly defective structure, features catalytic PDH performances comparable to those of β-Ga2O3; (11) however, the relative abundances of GaIV and GaVI bulk sites in γ-Ga2O3 were reported to range from 2.6:1 to 0.5:1. (12−16) Yet assessing experimentally the extent to which the higher density of bulk GaIV sites translates into a higher density of surface Ga sites with low coordination numbers (three or four) is not straightforward. Furthermore, FTIR studies of gallia surfaces with pyridine (Py) and CO probe molecules revealed similarities among α-, β-, and γ-Ga2O3 polymorphs despite the different distributions of GaIV and GaVI bulk Ga sites in these materials. (9,17)
The surface structure of γ-Ga2O3 was proposed to be related to that of γ-Al2O3, (18) in which tri-, tetra-, and pentacoordinated surface Al sites were shown to exist on dehydroxylated surfaces. (19,20) Additionally, tri- and pentacoordinated Ga sites were found computationally around oxygen vacancies in β-Ga2O3 or in small gallia clusters. (21−23) DFT calculations suggest that propane can undergo either a concerted (direct) or a stepwise dehydrogenation on gallia surfaces. (24) DFT studies of PDH on γ-Al2O3 showed that the coordination geometry of Al and O sites influences the energetics and viability of a particular PDH pathway. (25)
Surface Brønsted acidity is another parameter influencing the performance of MOx-based (M = Cr, Ga, ...) PDH catalysts. (26−28) The catalytic cracking of propane to ethene and methane (Scheme 1, eq 2) is an undesired side reaction commonly observed on various MOx PDH catalysts, including Ga2O3. (29−31) While strong Brønsted acid sites are typical for Ga-based zeolites, (32−34) the Ga2O3/support interface can also induce Brønsted acidity, for instance Si(OH)Ga sites in Ga2O3-SiO2 materials. (35−37)
Supported Ga2O3 catalysts are typically prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous Ga(NO3)3 onto oxide supports followed by calcination. (38−43) Although practical, the nitrate route may yield a broad distribution of active sites. (44−46) A rational catalyst advancement based on structure–activity relationships requires an understanding and control over the structure of surface sites and acidity properties, in order to improve the catalytic performance and minimize deactivation processes. That said, the current understanding of PDH-active Ga sites and their coordination geometry, acidity (Brønsted and Lewis), and stability still needs to be refined to allow for clearer structure–activity relationships.
In this work, we compared the catalytic activity of unsupported (stand-alone) gallia catalysts (α-, β-, γ-Ga2O3) as well as silica-supported materials (β-Ga2O3/SiO2, γ-Ga2O3/SiO2, and gallium nitrate-derived Ga2O3/SiO2). We utilized colloidal solutions of monodisperse nanocrystalline γ-Ga2O3 nanoparticles (2.5 ± 0.8 nm) that transform upon heating (partially or completely) (16) to β-Ga2O3, whether stand-alone or silica-supported. We then used pyridine as a probe molecule to correlate the surface acidity and coordination geometry of Ga sites in nanoparticles of β- and γ-Ga2O3, either stand-alone or silica-supported, comparing these spectroscopic data to those of α-Ga2O3 and a nitrate-derived Ga2O3/SiO2 (Ga/SiO2) benchmark. We used FTIR studies (47) as well as 15N dynamic nuclear polarization surface-enhanced NMR spectroscopy (48) (DNP SENS) to evaluate the coordination geometry and acidity strength (Brønsted and Lewis) of the surface sites in gallia catalysts and showed a correlation with the activity and selectivity in PDH. The structural assignments of the surface acidity were validated by DFT results on a β-Ga2O3 (100) model of the gallia surface. Overall, our results confirm similarities between the surfaces of β-Ga2O3 and γ-Ga2O3 with a notable difference of a higher relative fraction of weak Lewis acid sites in β-Ga2O3 in comparison to γ-Ga2O3. Our results highlight that the most active sites for PDH likely correspond to tricoordinated Ga sites, which display only weak Lewis acidic properties owing to the distorted local environment. Our results also point to the involvement of pentacoordinated Ga surface sites in catalyst deactivation under PDH conditions, owing to their promotion of side reactions, leading to coke formation. In addition, a catalyst with abundant, strong Brønsted acidity and mostly tetracoordinated Lewis acidic surface sites does not show deactivation. An increase in activity for propane cracking for supported catalysts was linked to interfacial strong Brønsted acid sites formed through the interaction between the gallia phase and the silica support.

2.1. Materials
Toluene (≥99.5%) and ethanol (≥99.8%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. γ-Ga2O3 nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared following a literature method. (49) Ga(acac)3 (2 g, 5.4 mmol, Strem) and 40 mL of oleylamine (≥98%, Sigma-Aldrich) were stirred for 1 h at 90 °C under dynamic vacuum of ca. 10–1 mbar. Subsequently, the reaction mixture was stirred at 200 °C under N2 (7 h, 3 °C min–1) and the residue was washed four times at room temperature with an ethanol–toluene mixture (3:1 ratio, 40 mL, centrifuged at 6500 rpm). The resulting gel was dissolved in toluene to give a colloidal solution of γ-Ga2O3 NPs (35 mg mL–1 by thermogravimetric analysis) that was incipient wetness impregnated onto a SiO2 support (Aerosil 300, Evonik, 250–450 μm mesh size, calcined at 650 °C for 4 h, SBET = 258 m2 g–1, Vpore = 1.54 mL g–1). Calcination at 600 or 750 °C (2 h, 3 °C min–1) yielded γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) or β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) materials. Unsupported catalysts γ-Ga2O3(600) and β-Ga2O3(750) (SBET = 110 and 27 m2 g–1, respectively) were prepared from the as-synthesized γ-Ga2O3 NPs using the same calcination protocols. Incipient wetness impregnation of an aqueous solution of Ga(NO3)3 (0.12 mM) onto SiO2 followed by calcination (600 °C, 2 h) yielded the benchmark Ga/SiO2(600) catalyst. Ga-Zeolite L (a reference material for XANES, 1 wt % Ga) was obtained by incipient wetness impregnation of an aqueous solution of Ga(NO3)3 onto Zeolite-L (Linde) followed by calcination at 600 °C. α-Ga2O3(600) (26 m2 g–1) was prepared according to a literature procedure, (50) where GaCl3 (240 mg, 1.36 mmol, 99.99%, Strem) was dissolved in 20 mL of deionized water and an aqueous solution of ammonia (35%, Sigma-Aldrich) was added dropwise until pH 11 was reached. After 18 h at 60 °C, the precipitate was filtered, washed with water and ethanol (250 mL), dried (60 °C, 5 h), and calcined in static air (600 °C, 2 h). Pyridine (99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 15N-labeled pyridine (98%, Cortecnet) were degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw cycles and dried over CaH2.
2.2. Catalytic Tests
Propane dehydrogenation was tested in a benchtop Microactivity EFFI reactor (PID Eng&Tech). A catalyst (50 mg) was mixed with 1.20 g of SiC (46 grit, Alfa-Aesar) and loaded between two plugs of quartz wool on a frit of a quartz fixed-bed reactor (ϕ 13 mm). After equilibration of the desired reaction temperature (550 °C, 10 °C min–1) under a N2 flow, 10% C3H8 in N2 (WHSV = 7.2 h–1) was introduced into the reactor. The outlet gas composition was analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Clarus 480, PerkinElmer) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) and a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The first data point was collected after 4 min of the reaction, and then data were collected every 20 min. For reaction–regeneration cycle tests, a regeneration step was introduced every 105 min on stream, by flowing synthetic air (30 mL min–1) for 15 min and flushing with N2 (30 mL min–1) for 10 min.
2.3. TGA Tests
Thermogravimetric analyses (Mettler Toledo, DSC 1) were conducted by placing ca. 15 mg of the material in a 70 μL alumina TGA crucible followed by heating to 550 °C (10 °C min–1) under 75 mL min–1 of N2 flow (including 25 mL min–1 of N2 purge flow over the microbalance). After the sample was held at 550 °C for 10 min, 10% of propane was introduced to the N2 flow and changes in the specimen weight were monitored for 2 h.
2.4. Structural Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) data was obtained using a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source set at 45 kV and 40 mA. The detector used was an ultrafast line X’Celerator Scientific and a Bragg–Brentano HD optic. The diffractograms were acquired between 20 and 90° (2θ; the step size was 0.0258° using 0.8 s step–1 acquisition time). For the pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, total scattering data were collected at the ID31 beamline (λ = 0.1771 Å) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The detector used was a Pilatus3 X CdTe 2M. Radial distance plots (G(r)), were obtained using the PDFgetX3 software, (51) using the following parameters: Qmin = 0.6 Å–1; Qmax = 20 Å–1; rpoly ≈ 1.6.
For PDF data, acquisition materials were placed in Kapton tubes (ϕ 1.5 mm). Differential PDF (dPDF) analysis to obtain a PDF plot of the supported phase (Figure S5) was carried out by subtracting the PDF signal of the SiO2 support. (52) X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) experiments were performed at the BM31 station of the Swiss-Norwegian beamlines (SNBL) at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). All spectra were collected at the Ga K-edge using continuous scanning in transmission mode with a double-crystal Si (111) monochromator. The subsequent treatment and analysis of the XAS data were carried out with Demeter software using a β-Ga2O3 structure to generate the photon scattering paths. (53,54) Energy calibrations were performed using Zn foil.
2.5. 71Ga MAS NMR
Solid-state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) experiments for the 71Ga nucleus were carried out in a Bruker 700 MHz (16.4 T) instrument, using a 1.3 mm probe and a spinning rate of 50 kHz. NMR fittings to obtain chemical shifts and abundance ratios of each coordination environment were performed using DMFit software. (55,56)
2.6. Raman Spectroscopy
Carbon deposits on deactivated catalysts were analyzed using a DXR 2 Raman microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a blue laser (455 nm) and a magnifying lens (100×). Acquisition was carried out at room temperature using a resolution of 2 cm–1 and an energy of 2 mV. The spectra recorded were baseline-corrected and fitted by Gaussian and Lorentzian functions (criteria shown in Table S3) using Fityk v 0.9.8 data analysis software. (57)
2.7. Determination of Surface Acidity with Pyridine
Materials were dehydroxylated (500 °C for powders and 550 °C for self-supporting pellets, 3 °C min–1, 2 h, 10–5 mbar) prior to exposure to the vapor pressure of pyridine (Py) at room temperature (20 min) followed by outgassing (100 or 300 °C, 3 °C min–1, 10–5 mbar, 15 min). The IR spectra (resolution 4 cm–1) were collected in transmission mode (Thermo Scientific Nicolet FTIR with a DTGS detector) from self-supporting pellets. (58) For 15N DNP SENS measurements, outgassed 15N-labeled Py (15N-Py) containing materials were impregnated in a glovebox (O2 and H2O <1 ppm) with a 16 mM TEKPol solution in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TCE), (59,60) transferred in a 3.2 mm (o.d.) sapphire rotor with a zirconia cap and held in place with a Teflon insert. The rotor was then quickly introduced into a cold NMR probe (100 K). The 15N NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 600 MHz (14.1 T) instrument with a 3.2 mm Bruker low-temperature double-resonance probe coupled to a 395 GHz gyrotron microwave source with an output power of 6–10 W. The reference used for the static magnetic field was set by the 13C higher frequency peak of adamantane at 38.4 ppm. A 1H saturation-recovery experiment with the microwaves turned on was used to measure the DNP buildup time (TDNP). Additionally, 15N{1H} cross-polarization magic-angle spinning (CP-MAS) experiments were recorded by setting the recycle delay to 1.3 TDNP and the 1H excitation and decoupling radio-frequency fields to 100 kHz. All cross-polarization parameters were optimized to fulfill the Hartmann–Hahn condition under MAS to reach the best experimental efficiency. See Table S6 for additional experimental NMR parameters.
2.8. Computational Details
Electronic structure calculations were performed using periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP). (61−64) The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange and correlation functional in combination with the projected augmented waves (PAW) method was used. (65−67) The valence electrons were treated using a plane-wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 500 eV. The dispersion-corrected DFT-D3 (BJ) method was used to describe the van der Waals interactions. (68) The convergence of the force on each atom was set to 0.05 eV Å–1. Vibrational frequency calculations were performed using the finite difference method with small atomic displacements of 0.02 Å. NMR parameters were calculated using the linear response method implemented in VASP. (69,70) All of the 15N chemical shifts were referenced to the gaseous pyridine molecule with a value of 317 ppm. The stable β-Ga2O3 (100) surface (71) was used as a model to evaluate the structural properties of the Lewis acid sites (LAS). Two models, differing in their surface energies and terminations (see Figure S20 in the Supporting Information for further details), were considered. Models containing oxygen vacancies (VO) were constructed by removing a surface oxygen O(II) in model 1 or O(III) in model 2. For these Ga2O3 surface models, 2 × 2 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack grids were used to sample the Brillouin zone. (72) The optimized cell parameters for bulk β-Ga2O3 (a = 12.29 Å, b = 11.40 Å, c = 11.99 Å, and α = β = γ = 90°) were used, except that the cell parameter c was adjusted to 31.99 Å by adding a vacuum region of 20 Å for slab models to minimize the interlayer interactions. Full geometry optimization with the Py probe molecule was performed with fixed cell parameters.

3.1. Synthesis of Materials
We have prepared unsupported α-Ga2O3(600), β-Ga2O3(750), and γ-Ga2O3(600) as well as silica-supported β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) and γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and a reference, gallium nitrate-derived Ga/SiO2(600) material, for a structure-activity study in propane dehydrogenation. γ-Ga2O3(600), β-Ga2O3(750), γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600), and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) were synthesized using the previously described colloidal γ-Ga2O3 nanoparticles (Figure 1A). (49) It is known that annealing of as-prepared γ-Ga2O3 NPs at ≥700 °C forms monoclinic β-Ga2O3. (73) We have therefore annealed as-prepared γ-Ga2O3 nanoparticles (2.5 ± 0.8 nm, synthesis temperature 200 °C) at 750 °C for 2 h, which gave β-Ga2O3(750) according to the powder XRD pattern (Figure S1). The specific BET surface area and BJH pore diameter are 110 m2 g–1 and 2.3 nm for γ-Ga2O3(600), respectively, while β-Ga2O3(750) and α-Ga2O3(600) feature similar surface areas of 27 and 26 m2 g–1 and a larger pore diameter of 4 nm (Table 1).

Alternatively, a colloidal solution of γ-Ga2O3 in toluene was deposited on silica through incipient wetness impregnation (IWI) followed by a calcination step at 750 °C to prepare β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750). Calcination at 600 °C of as-prepared γ-Ga2O3 or after IWI on SiO2 gave materials denoted γ-Ga2O3(600) and γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600). The benchmark material Ga/SiO2(600) was prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation of aqueous Ga(NO3)3 onto SiO2 followed by calcination at 600 °C. (40,41,74)
3.2. Structural Characterization
XRD provides limited structural information for silica-supported materials due to the low Ga content (ca. 3 wt %) and a high dispersion of gallia on the silica support (Figure S3). Therefore, we used the complementary information obtained by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) at the Ga K-edge (Figure 1B), 71Ga MAS NMR and differential PDF analysis (dPDF, Figure 1C) to characterize the local and average structures of the supported Ga2O3 phase. These combined techniques allowed for a semiquantitative assessment of the structure of the SiO2-supported Ga2O3-based catalysts.
The PDF analysis is based on X-ray total scattering, including both diffuse and Bragg scattering. (75) We have recently studied the structure of unsupported metastable γ-Ga2O3 nanoparticles with a highly disordered spinel-type structure and their thermal γ → β phase transition. (16) A bulk γ → β phase transformation takes place between 550 and 750 °C, and it was linked with an increase in the crystallite size of β-Ga2O3; thus, γ-Ga2O3(600) contains a mixture of 75% γ-phase and 25% β-phase with an average crystallite size of ca. 2.6 nm. In contrast, calcination at 750 °C leads to the pure β-phase with a crystallite size of ca. 10 nm. However, the degree of local disorder already increases above 200–300 °C due to the formation of small β-Ga2O3 domains. (16) Nonetheless, it is necessary to also characterize the structure of the SiO2-supported Ga2O3 phases: i.e., their crystallite sizes, phases, and local structures. To this end, differential PDF (dPDF) was performed by subtracting the scattering signal of the support material, i.e., amorphous SiO2, allowing us to obtain information about the supported Ga2O3 phase (a scheme of the subtraction process is shown in Figure S5). (52) The obtained dPDF data (Figure 1C) can be divided into three ranges of radial distances according to the structural length probed: the low-r range (1–7 Å, local structure), the mid-r range (7–17 Å, bulk structure), and the high-r range (17–50 Å, reflecting the nanocrystalline size). (76) In the low-r range in all of the studied materials, the peaks observed at 1.8–2.1 and 2.9–3.7 Å are dominated by Ga–O and Ga–Ga distances, respectively (shaded areas in Figure 1C). In the low-r range the dPDF pattern of β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) and γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) are very similar, consistent with a similar local structure in these materials, as was also observed for unsupported γ-Ga2O3(600) and β-Ga2O3(750). (16) In contrast, a different local environment in Ga/SiO2(600) is evidenced by the absence of peaks between 5 and 7 Å as well as by the differences in the Ga–O and Ga–Ga peak positions (Table S2) and their relative intensities. In particular, the Ga–O interatomic distance in Ga/SiO2(600) is shorter relative to those in β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) and γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) (1.86, 1.94, and 1.95 Å, respectively). An analysis of the dPDF in the mid-r range shows that the “bulk” nanocrystalline gallia structures in γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) are also similar to those of γ-Ga2O3(600) and β-Ga2O3(750) and contain characteristic features that allow us to distinguish between γ-Ga2O3 and β-Ga2O3 phases (circled in Figure 1C). (16) Specifically, while γ-Ga2O3 gives a single PDF peak at ca. 7.78 Å, two peaks are found for β-Ga2O3, located at ca. 7.79 and 8.08 Å. dPDF fitting analysis (Figure 1C and Figures S25 and S26) confirms that the crystalline structure of the nanoparticles in β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) corresponds to the β-phase and, in the case of γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600), to a mixture of ca. 75% γ-phase and 25% β-phase (i.e., this analysis confirms that the gallia phases in γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) are similar to those of the unsupported γ-Ga2O3(600) and β-Ga2O3(750), respectively). (16) The high-r range reveals an increasing coherence length for β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) in comparison to γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600), showing a growth in the crystallite size during calcination (and transformation) of γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) to β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750). This crystallite growth is indicated by the fading off of the oscillations at a longer distance in β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) with respect to γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) (Figure 1C). The dPDF analysis yielded an estimated average crystallite size of ca. 3 nm for γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and ca. 6 nm for β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) (Figure 1C and Figures S25 and S26). Note that the crystallite size of β-Ga2O3 in β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) is lower than that in unsupported β-Ga2O3(750) (ca. 6 and 10 nm, respectively). Consistent with these results, TEM-EDX shows larger and more agglomerated nanoparticles in β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) than in γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) (Figure S8). The absence of oscillations in the dPDF at the mid- and high-r ranges in Ga/SiO2(600) reveals the amorphous nature of the gallia phase in this material, in contrast to nanocrystalline β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) and γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) (Figure 1C). Overall, the local environments of the Ga sites are similar in β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) and γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) but different from that of Ga/SiO2(600). However, since dPDF is not an element-specific technique, we turned to Ga K-edge XAS to determine the local environment around Ga.
The white lines of the Ga K-edge XANES spectra of the supported materials contain two distinguishable features at ca. 10375 and 10380 eV, due to GaΙV and GaVI sites (Figure 1B, left). (12) The XANES spectra obtained were compared with those of Ga(acac)3 and Ga-Zeolite L: i.e., references of GaVI and GaIV sites, respectively (Figure S7). A qualitative comparison of the spectra shows that Ga/SiO2(600) features a broad white line with the least intense GaVI peak. Such a broad white line suggests the presence of a wide distribution of coordination numbers in this material: i.e., GaVI, GaIV, and likely pentacoordinated (GaV) sites (vide infra, 71Ga MAS NMR results). Both γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) show more prominent features of GaVI sites relative to Ga/SiO2(600), and features of GaIV sites are slightly more intense in β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) than in γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600).
The EXAFS data of silica-supported Ga-based materials are presented in Figure 1B (right) and Figure S28, and the fitting results are summarized in Figures S4 and S27 and Table S11. Two coordination spheres are distinguishable in the EXAFS data for γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750). The first sphere corresponds to Ga–O paths, and the second sphere is dominated by Ga–Ga paths. The Ga–Ga shell has a low intensity in Ga/SiO2(600), confirming the amorphous nature of the Ga2O3 phase in this material, consistent with the dPDF analysis (Figure 1B, right; Table S11, entry 1). The fitted Ga–O bond distances in as-synthesized γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(200), as well as in calcined γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750), showed similar values of 1.90(1), 1.89(1), and 1.89(1) Å, respectively. In contrast, the reference material Ga(acac)3, which contains only GaVI sites, yields a Ga–O distance of 1.96(1) Å (Figures S27 and S28 and Table S11), matching well with the distances obtained from single-crystal XRD (ca. 1.953–1.970 Å). (77)
On the other hand, the changes observed in the Ga–Ga1 and Ga–Ga2 shells (due to the arrangement of the polyhedra in the structure) show that the local structure around Ga in γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) is different from that of γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(200) and agrees with the presence of both γ and β local environments in γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600), in line with the dPDF results. The average coordination numbers (CNs) of Ga–O were between 5.2(5) and 5.8(5) in the studied materials (Table S11), while a higher CN value of 6.3(6) was obtained for the hexacoordinate reference complex Ga(acac)3 (Figures S27 and S28 and Table S11). However, it should be noted that the differences in the EXAFS-determined CNs are within the experimental error. The Ga–Ga distances are in line with the previously reported values for unsupported γ-Ga2O3(200), γ-Ga2O3(600), and β-Ga2O3(750). (16)
The local coordination around Ga in γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600), β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750), and Ga/SiO2(600) was assessed quantitatively by 71Ga MAS NMR (Figure S9 and Table S1). The spectra for γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) show two major peaks at ca. 150 and 12 ppm, attributed to GaIV and GaVI sites, respectively. (78) However, Ga/SiO2(600) displays an additional peak at ca. 88 ppm tentatively attributed to GaV sites. (78,79) The fitting of 71Ga MAS NMR spectra gives the following distribution of sites: 40% of GaIV and 60% of GaVI sites in γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600); 48% of GaIV and 52% of GaVI in β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750); 19% of GaIV, 23% of GaV, and 58% of GaVI for Ga/SiO2(600) (Figure S9 and Table S1).
To summarize, combined dPDF, Ga K-edge XAS, and 71Ga MAS NMR analyses show that γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) is composed of mostly γ-Ga2O3 nanoparticles (ca. 3 nm) supported on SiO2, while β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) contains only β-Ga2O3 nanoparticles (ca. 6 nm). In contrast, Ga/SiO2(600) shows an amorphous Ga2O3 phase dispersed on SiO2. In contrast to γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750), which present only GaIV and GaVI coordination, Ga/SiO2(600) most likely also contains pentacoordinated GaV sites. While the aforementioned techniques probe the bulk and local structure, they do not provide surface-sensitive insights, and so the presence of Ga–O–Si at the interface between the gallia phase and the silica support cannot be ruled out at this point.
3.3. Catalytic Performance
The performance of the prepared catalysts in propane dehydrogenation was tested at 550 °C and at WHSV = 7.2 h–1. A summary of the catalytic results is presented in Table 1, while Figure 2 shows changes in conversion and selectivity with TOS for the unsupported (Figure 2A–C) and supported (Figure 2D–F) Ga2O3-based catalysts. Note that, while the activity of unsupported catalysts can be compared after normalization per Ga content or per surface area of the active phase (determined from BET analysis of N2 physisorption data of Ga2O3), a comparison of the activities of supported catalysts is limited to normalization by Ga content. Normalization by BET surface area allows us to compare more accurately catalysts with largely different surface areas: for instance, as observed in this work for γ-Ga2O3 on one side and α-Ga2O3 and β-Ga2O3 on the other (Table 1). Propane dehydrogenation activities of unsupported catalysts (mol C3H6 mol Ga–1 h–1), after 4 min time on stream (TOS), are γ-Ga2O3(600) (∼1.5) > β-Ga2O3(750) (∼1.0) > α-Ga2O3(600) (∼0.7) (Figure S10). When these values are normalized by BET surface area (mmol C3H6 m–2 h–1), the activities are β-Ga2O3(750) (∼0.41) > α-Ga2O3(600) (∼0.28) > γ-Ga2O3(600) (∼0.14), owing to the notably higher surface area of γ-Ga2O3(600) relative to α-Ga2O3(600) and β-Ga2O3(750) (Figure 2A and Table 1). β-Ga2O3(750), α-Ga2O3(600), and γ-Ga2O3(600) deactivated after 104 min TOS by 76, 73, and 74%, respectively. The selectivity to propene for γ-, β-, and α-Ga2O3 decreased from 88, 86, and 83% after 4 min TOS to 65, 60, and 54% after 104 min TOS, respectively (Figure 2B and Table 1). In contrast to the decreasing propene formation rates with TOS, the formation rates of the main side products, methane and ethene, were stable (Figure 2C). These formation rates were similar for β-Ga2O3(750) and α-Ga2O3(600) (between ca. 50 and 70 μmol (C1+C2═ m–2 h–1), and lower for γ-Ga2O3(600) (ca. 20 μmol C1+C2═ m–2 h–1).
Figure 2

Ga weight-normalized activity (D), propene selectivity (E), and formation rates to cracking products (combined rates to ethene and methane, F) of silica-supported Ga-based catalysts. WHSV = 7.2 h–1 and T = 550 °C. Initial and final propane conversions measured in the catalytic tests are presented in Table 1. The molar ratio between the cracking products, methane and ethene, was close to 1:1 for all catalysts and did not change with TOS.
Dispersion of Ga2O3 on silica drastically increased the activity per mass of Ga. Thus, the highest activity after 4 min on stream is observed for γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600), followed by β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) and Ga/SiO2(600), with the respective initial rates of ca. 11, 9, and 2 mol C3H6 mol Ga–1 h–1 (Figure 2D) and initial selectivities to propene of 76, 73, and 49% (Figure 2E and Table 1). γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) deactivate similarly with TOS. After 104 min TOS, the respective rates of propene formation are reduced to ∼5 and 4 mol C3H6 mol Ga–1 h–1 and propene selectivity drops to 52 and 50%. In contrast, while Ga/SiO2(600) shows a low initial activity of 2.2 mol C3H6 mol Ga–1 h–1, its activity increases by 55% during the first ca. 20 min TOS, after which the activity remains stable over 100 min. This activity increase is accompanied by a slight drop in the selectivity to propene (with a concomitant increase in the cracking rate), after which the rates and selectivity remain unchanged with TOS. The selectivity to propene of Ga/SiO2(600) is lower in comparison to the other tested catalysts (ca. 48%; Figure 2E and Table 1).
Note that while the specific surface area of the Ga2O3 phase in silica-supported catalysts is not known, the average crystallite size of gallia in γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) is close to that in γ-Ga2O3(600) (ca. 3 and 2.6 nm, respectively) and lower in β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) in comparison to β-Ga2O3(750) (ca. 6 nm versus 10 nm). (16)
In addition to propene, ethene and methane form in a 1:1 molar ratio for all studied catalysts owing to the cracking of propane (Scheme 1, eq 2). The formation rates of ethene and methane show little change with TOS (except for Ga/SiO2(600), which shows increasing cracking rates within the first 24 min TOS), while the selectivities to these products increase as the propene production decreases with increasing catalyst deactivation (Figure 2C,F, Table 1, and Figure S11). Blank tests performed using only the SiC diluent showed a stable conversion of only ca. 0.6% and a selectivity to propene of ca. 40% (Figure S29).
Finally, reaction–regeneration cycles were carried out by passing synthetic air at 550 °C through the catalyst bed for 15 min after 105 min TOS. No significant changes in space–time yield and selectivity were observed between the first and fifth cycles for α-Ga2O3(600) and γ-Ga2O3(600), while the STY of β-Ga2O3(750) increased from 1.1 to 1.5 mol C3H6 mol Ga–1 h–1 after the first regeneration (Figure S12). Interestingly, the first regeneration also increases the STY of the supported catalysts; most notably the STY for γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) increases from 10.6 to 17.2 mol C3H6 mol Ga–1 h–1 (Figure S13). The underlying reason for these effects is currently unclear.
3.4. Coke Deposition
The weight gain owing to carbon deposition with TOS was assessed by thermogravimetric analysis experiments (TGA): an alumina crucible with ca. 15 mg of the catalyst was kept at 550 °C in 10% C3H8 in N2 for 2 h, and the amount of coke deposited onto the catalysts was determined. Table 1 compares coke deposition on the different catalysts using both a normalization by Ga wt % and BET surface area. The coke deposition per Ga wt % decreases for the unsupported catalysts in the order γ-Ga2O3(600) > α-Ga2O3(600) ≈ β-Ga2O3(750) (0.07, 0.02, and 0.01, respectively; entries 1–3, Table 1), and the amount of coke deposited per surface area of gallia in unsupported catalysts decreases in the order β-Ga2O3(750) > γ-Ga2O3(600) ≈ α-Ga2O3(600) (0.056, 0.040, and 0.037, respectively; entries 1–3, Table 1). γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) deposited more coke per Ga wt % in comparison to β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) (0.12% and 0.10% per Ga wt %; entries 4 and 5, Table 1). In sharp contrast, Ga/SiO2(600) did not deposit a measurable amount of coke (entry 6, Table 1). The TGA deposition profiles are shown in Figure S14.
After the catalytic tests, Raman spectroscopy was also used to analyze the nature of the carbon deposited at the spent catalysts (Figure S15). Deconvolution of the obtained spectra (Table S4) identified, on the basis of previous reports, the following first-order bands: D4 (∼1200 cm–1), D1 (∼1350 cm–1), D3 (∼1500 cm–1), and G (∼1580 cm–1, Table S3). (80)
The D1 and D4 bands correspond to disordered graphitic lattices, D3 indicates amorphous carbon, and G represents an ideally ordered graphitic structure. The D4 and G bands were fitted using Lorentzian shapes, while Gaussian fits were used for the D1 and D3 bands. In order to evaluate the degree of disorder in the carbon deposits, D1/G area ratios are used. (81−83) The D1/G values obtained for our materials show similar ratios of ca. 1.3 for α-Ga2O3(600), β-Ga2O3(750), and γ-Ga2O3(600). For the supported materials, D1/G ratios of 1.5 and 1.4 were obtained for γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750), respectively (Table S4). Ga/SiO2(600) featured the lowest D1/G ratio (1.2) and displayed the lowest deactivation with TOS.
3.5. FTIR Studies of Adsorbed Pyridine
IR spectroscopy of pyridine adsorbed on oxide surfaces is a well-known method for a qualitative and quantitative analysis of surface acid sites: i.e., Brønsted (BAS) or Lewis (LAS). (47,84−87) IR bands for pyridine adducts with Lewis acid sites appear at ca. 1630–1600, 1490, and 1455 cm–1 (ν8a, ν19a and ν19b modes, respectively, according to the Wilson notation, Figure 3A). (88) The higher wavenumbers between 1630 and 1600 cm–1 are associated with stronger Lewis acidity. (89) The region around 1490 cm–1 contains overlapping bands due to pyridine adsorbed on Lewis and Brønsted acid sites. (18,35,90,91) Physisorbed pyridine (i.e., pyridine bound to weak BAS) exhibits bands between 1584 and 1578 cm–1 and ca. 1440 cm–1, although it has been proposed that pyridine on LAS can also exhibit bands at these wavenumbers. (9,91) Pyridine protonated by strong BAS gives bands at ca. 1640 and 1545 cm–1. (91) Below we discuss the Lewis and Brønsted acidities of the studied materials as assessed by FTIR studies with pyridine. Note that pyridine on SiO2(500) features bands owing to physisorbed pyridine at 1578 cm–1, weak BAS at 1596 and 1445 cm–1, and a weak LAS band at ca. 1626 that is present only at room-temperature desorption. (92−95) Pyridine bands disappear after heating SiO2(500) at 200 °C under vacuum (Figure S16).

3.5.1. Lewis Acid Sites (LAS)
α-Ga2O3 contains only bulk GaVI sites. (8−10) Pyridine adsorbed on α-Ga2O3(600) displays features of LAS at 1616, 1490, and 1455 cm–1. These bands slightly blue shift at higher desorption temperatures (300 °C), and their intensity decreases slightly as well (Figure 3B), implying strong binding of pyridine to these LAS. On β-Ga2O3(750), which has a BET surface area nearly identical with that of α-Ga2O3(600) (Table 1), adsorbed pyridine exhibits bands at ca. 1613, 1490, and 1455 cm–1 (Figure 3C). The broad band at ca. 1613 cm–1 (Tdes ≤ 100 °C) is indicative of at least two types of LAS, confirmed by the narrowing of this band at Tdes = 300 °C and its shifting to ca. 1620 cm–1 (consistent with a stronger LAS). The intensities of the bands at 1490 and 1455 cm–1 decrease significantly when pyridine is desorbed already at Tdes = 200 °C. Pyridine on γ-Ga2O3(600) features bands due to LAS at 1613, 1490, and 1455 cm–1, similar to β-Ga2O3(750) (Figure 3D). The band at 1613 cm–1 splits into two bands when the desorption temperature is increased and shifts to 1618 cm–1 at Tdes = 300 °C. The positions of FTIR bands for pyridine adsorbed on LAS of β-Ga2O3(750) and γ-Ga2O3(600) are in general similar. The higher intensity of bands observed for pyridine on γ-Ga2O3(600) in comparison to β-Ga2O3(750) at all desorption temperatures points to a higher fraction of strong acid sites on γ-Ga2O3(600). Overall, it is important to note that, for β-Ga2O3(750), the intensity of LAS bands decreases to a greater extent with increasing desorption temperature relative to the analogous decrease in intensity of pyridine bands in γ-Ga2O3(600) or α-Ga2O3(600). This observation is consistent with a higher relative amount of weak LAS in β-Ga2O3(750) in comparison to the respective relative amounts of weak LAS in γ-Ga2O3(600) and α-Ga2O3(600).
Likewise, the decrease in intensity of FTIR bands for silica-supported materials with desorption temperature is higher for β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) in comparison to the intensity decrease in γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600), at all desorption temperatures tested: i.e., this trend is similar to that discussed above for unsupported β-Ga2O3(750) and γ-Ga2O3(600) (Figure 3E,F). Bands due to LAS at 1623 and 1486 cm–1 are of low intensity on γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) (expanded regions of FTIR spectra are presented in Figure S17, and results of Gaussian fittings are shown in Table S5) but are qualitatively similar at Tdes = 300 °C. In contrast, Ga/SiO2(600) features sharp bands at 1620 and 1456 cm–1, which do not shift or disappear at Tdes = 300 °C, indicating strong Lewis acidity (Figure 3G).
3.5.2. Brønsted Acid Sites (BAS)
Mild or weak Brønsted acidity due to H-bonded pyridine can be identified by bands at 1596 and ca. 1450 cm–1 that are found in all prepared materials. The intensity of these bands decreases rapidly with increasing desorption temperature. While in unsupported gallia materials bands at ca. 1596 and ca. 1450 cm–1 appear as shoulders, silica-supported materials contain them as sharp bands that disappear for Ga/SiO2(600) after desorption at Tdes = 200 and 300 °C, respectively. However, these bands remain visible for β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) and, to a larger extent, for γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) even after desorption at elevated temperature (Figure 3E,F). Since pyridine H-bonded to bare silica dehydroxylated at 500 °C (weak BAS) can be desorbed completely at 200 °C (Figure S16), the bands remaining at higher desorption temperatures are due to the silica–gallia interaction, also leading to a blue shift of the Si–OH band at ca. 3746 cm–1 (Figure S19). The inset in Figure 3G shows bands at 1546 cm–1 from pyridine protonated by the strong BAS (HPy+) of Ga/SiO2(600). Such strong Brønsted acidity is not observed by FTIR on the other materials studied here.
To summarize, FTIR studies with Py indicate that increasing desorption temperatures leads to (i) a blue shift and decrease in the intensity of bands due to pyridine on LAS for β-Ga2O3(750), γ-Ga2O3(600), β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) and γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600), (ii) almost no shift and no loss of intensity in the LAS bands in Ga/SiO2(600) and α-Ga2O3(600), and (iii) the emergence of mild BAS in β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) and γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) due to gallia–silica interactions (while Ga/SiO2(600) shows strong Brønsted acidity). The most notable difference between unsupported Ga2O3 polymorphs is the significantly larger relative fraction of weak LAS in β-Ga2O3(750) in comparison to the relative fractions of weak LAS in α-Ga2O3(600) or γ-Ga2O3(600). The same trend is also observed for β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) relative to γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600): i.e., materials based on β-Ga2O3(750) contain a larger relative fraction of weak LAS.
3.6. 15N DNP SENS Studies of Adsorbed Pyridine
Low-temperature dynamic nuclear polarization surface-enhanced NMR spectroscopy (DNP SENS) with 15N-labeled pyridine (15N-Py) was utilized to further improve our understanding of the nature of surface sites in the prepared Ga-based materials. (96,97) Two desorption temperatures were used (100 and 300 °C). Previous reports established that protonated pyridine exhibits peaks at ∼190–212 ppm, indicating strong Brønsted acidity. (93) Pyridine bonded to LAS is found between ca. 225 and 275 ppm, with more shielded peaks (lower chemical shift) corresponding to stronger LAS (typically, lower-coordinated sites). (48) H-bonded pyridine (i.e., weak or mild BAS) appears at 275–305 ppm and physisorbed pyridine at 317 ppm. (48,93)
After desorption of 15N-Py at 100 °C, α-Ga2O3(600) displays a major peak at 247 ppm, a feature at 259 ppm, and a shoulder at 267 ppm (Figure 4A). Peaks due to strong and medium LAS appear on β-Ga2O3(750) and γ-Ga2O3(600) at 243, 267 ppm and 242, 264 ppm, respectively (Figure 4B,C). However, β-Ga2O3(750) shows an intense peak at around ca. 281 ppm (highlighted in red), which appears only as a shoulder at 277 ppm for γ-Ga2O3(600). We suggest that this peak likely belongs to pyridine on weak LAS and it distinguishes β-Ga2O3(750) from γ-Ga2O3(600). Evacuation of pyridine from γ-Ga2O3(600) and β-Ga2O3(750) at 300 °C leaves Py species bound to surface sites that are strikingly similar in these two materials, with a more intense peak due to strong LAS at 236 ppm. Under these conditions, β-Ga2O3(750) and γ-Ga2O3(600) feature another similar peak (more intense for γ-Ga2O3(600)) at ca. 252 and 255 ppm, respectively. A peak at a similar chemical shift is also observed for α-Ga2O3(600) (Figure 4A–C). Additional minor peaks at ca. 274 ppm might be due to pyridine adsorbed onto surface hydroxyls of γ-Ga2O3(600) and β-Ga2O3(750). Interestingly, α-Ga2O3(600) at Tdes = 300 °C shows its most intense peak at 245 ppm, which is at a position intermediate between two major peaks of γ-Ga2O3(600) and β-Ga2O3(750) as well as a feature at 254 ppm and a shoulder at 266 ppm (Figure 4A).

The red square in (B) marks a peak that discriminates β-Ga2O3(750) from α-Ga2O3(600) and γ-Ga2O3(600).
Intense peaks at ca. 284 and 282 ppm are detected in the spectra of β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) and γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600), respectively, after desorption at 100 °C, most likely indicating H-bonded pyridine: i.e., weak BAS (Figure 4D,E). We note specifically that abundant, weak BAS are expected for silica-supported catalysts due to the presence of silanol groups on the partially dehydroxylated silica support. This is consistent with the presence, in SiO2(500), of a broad peak centered at 285 ppm due to weak BAS (Tdes = 100 °C), in addition to a broad peak at 259 ppm. The latter peak can be attributed to pyridine Lewis adducts with Si surface atoms (Figure S18) (92−95) or to BAS. (98) Furthermore, the presence of weak BAS at a pyridine desorption temperature of 100 °C was confirmed in FTIR experiments on SiO2(500) (Figure S16). Therefore, while the presence of weak LAS on β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) and γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) is likely, the peak of weak LAS cannot be discerned on β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) and γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) due to the overlapping peak of the more abundant (and hence more intense) weak BAS of the silanol groups at 282–284 ppm. β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) displays several low-intensity peaks between 230 and 265 ppm due to Lewis acid–base adducts, as well as those due to adsorption on strong BAS (as evidenced by the formation of PyH+) at ca. 208 ppm. Figure 4E shows adducts in γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) similar to those observed for β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750), i.e., features due to LAS at ca. 230 and 262 ppm, in addition to a small peak owing to strong Brønsted acidity at ca. 204 ppm, although these three peaks are close to the level of experimental noise. Interestingly, at 100 °C desorption temperature, Ga/SiO2(600) exhibits major peaks at ca. 206 and 236 ppm due to strong BAS and strong LAS, respectively, while only minor features are also observed at ca. 260 and 283 ppm (Figure 4F).
Increasing the desorption temperature to 300 °C leads to a predominance of peaks at ca. 235 ppm for all materials except α-Ga2O3(600). In addition, γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) exhibit multiple low-intensity peaks between ca. 240 and 275 ppm due to pyridine adsorbed on strong to medium LAS. γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) retained the weak BAS feature at ca. 284 ppm after desorption at 300 °C, which however has lost most of its intensity. Peaks of protonated pyridine between 205 and 210 ppm are observed at Tdes = 300 °C due to strong BAS for all silica-supported samples. In contrast to γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750), after desorption at 300 °C, the intensities and peak positions in Ga/SiO2(600) do not change significantly in comparison to Tdes = 100 °C, except for the disappearance of peaks due to weakly bound pyridine in the ca. 250–280 ppm range.
We also note that, at a high surface coverage of pyridine (at ca. 0.5–1 monolayer), hydrogen-bonding interactions were shown to yield particularly prominent NMR features on silica–alumina materials. (99) As the desorption temperatures increase and pyridine coverage and pyridine mobility decrease, adsorption on LAS becomes more favored. (99) Therefore, variations in pyridine coverage for desorption temperatures between 100 and 300 °C could also influence the relative peak intensities between H-bonded pyridine and pyridine bound to LAS. For comparison, the positions of the observed NMR peaks are summarized in Table S7. Chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) data were also acquired for unsupported gallia materials (Figures S22–S24). A comparison between the obtained δ11 CSA tensor component plotted as a function of the variation in the isotropic chemical shift (Δδiso) shows a linear trend for α-Ga2O3(600), β-Ga2O3(750), and γ-Ga2O3(600), as was also reported for γ-Al2O3 (Figure S30). (48)
Overall, 15N DNP SENS data confirmed similarities between the surfaces of γ-Ga2O3(600) and β-Ga2O3(750) and, to a lesser extent, between γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) at Tdes = 300 °C (Figure 4D,E). α-Ga2O3(600) is the only material without any peaks around 235 ppm, while the only peak displayed by Ga/SiO2(600) is found around 235 ppm: i.e., in the range of peaks due to strong LAS. After desorption at 300 °C, the presence of mild Brønsted acidity is found in γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) and is not detected in Ga/SiO2(600) (i.e., peak at 284 ppm). This peak is assigned to mild BAS in preference to mild LAS because desorption at Tdes = 300 °C removes pyridine from weak LAS in unsupported γ-Ga2O3 and β-Ga2O3. At the same time, pyridine on mild BAS is detected at 285 ppm in SiO2(500) using Tdes = 300 °C (Figure S18). Finally, the principal feature that differentiates pyridine on β-Ga2O3(750) from γ-Ga2O3(600) is a peak at 281 ppm, intense in β-Ga2O3(750) and minor in γ-Ga2O3(600), which is assigned to weak LAS in these unsupported catalysts.
However, strong Brønsted acidity is detected in all supported catalysts. Note that this observation is in contrast to the IR data of adsorbed pyridine discussed above, which showed strong Brønsted acidity for Ga/SiO2(600) alone. We explain this by the higher sensitivity of the 15N DNP SENS method to strong BAS relative to FTIR studies of adsorbed pyridine. (98) In what follows, we will discuss the assignments of these peaks on the basis of complementary computational modeling.
3.7. DFT Modeling of Pyridine Surface Adducts
We have conducted periodic DFT calculations to validate the structural assignments of peaks in the 15N DNP SENS spectra and pyridine bands in FTIR. The interaction between adsorbed pyridine and gallia was assessed using β-Ga2O3 (100) surface models. In order to simulate the defective nature of γ-Ga2O3, oxygen vacancies and different site densities were introduced within the structure of β-Ga2O3. (71) Two types of surface models with terminations in rows of unsaturated two- or three-coordinated oxygen atoms (O(II) and O(III), model 1 (M1) and model 2 (M2), respectively) were considered (Figure S20A). Both models have a Ga64O96 composition and contain pentacoordinate Ga surface sites. The calculated surface energies for M1 and M2 are 1.08 and 0.71 J m–2. Oxygen vacancies (VO) were also introduced in order to model sites with lower coordination geometries, by removing a surface O(II) in M1 or O(III) in M2 and yielding M1-VO and M2-VO, respectively (Figure S20B). Lewis acidic properties of these surfaces were evaluated by calculating the pyridine adsorption energy (ΔEads), 15N isotropic chemical shift (δiso), and vibration frequency of the ν8a mode of pyridine ring vibration (Figure 5 and Table 2). We refer to the coordination of sites in models prior to pyridine adsorption. Thus, pyridine is bonded to pentacoordinate Ga atoms in M1-GaV-Py and M2-GaV-Py (Figure 5), (100) giving the respective calculated values of ΔEads (−151 vs −122 kJ mol–1), δiso (245 vs 260 ppm), and ν8a (1609 vs 1606 cm–1), indicating a stronger Lewis acidity of Ga sites in M1 in comparison to M2 (entries 2 and 6, Table 2). Removing a surface oxygen atom to create a vacancy generates a nearby tricoordinate GaIII site in M1-VO-GaV-Py on which pyridine is adsorbed in model M1-VO-GaIII-Py (Figure 5). Likewise, in model M2, pyridine is adsorbed on GaIV (M2-VO-GaIV-Py) and GaIII (M2-VO-GaIII-Py) sites appearing after removal of one oxygen from M2 (Figure 5). Surprisingly, GaIII sites in M1-VO-GaIII-Py and M2-VO-GaIII-Py possess weaker Lewis acidity in comparison to GaV and GaIV sites in M1-VO-GaV-Py and M2-VO-GaIV-Py, (entries 3 and 7, Table 2), as follows from their lower ΔEads, lower deshielded δiso, and lower wavenumbers for ν8a (entries 4 and 8, Table 2). (48,93) Oxygen vacancies do not significantly influence ΔEads, δiso, and ν8a of Py on GaV sites in M1-VO and M2-VO relative to GaV sites in the parent models (entries 2, 3, 6, and 7, Table 2). The formation of a second oxygen vacancy in models M1-2-VO-GaIII-Py and M2-2-VO-GaIII-Py is also reflected in further changes in the computed acidity parameters. The Lewis acidity of M1-2-VO-GaIII-Py decreases in comparison to that of the monovacancy model M1-VO-GaIII-Py evidenced by the minor increase in ν8a by 6 cm–1 with a concomitant decrease in the ΔEads and δiso parameters from −93 to −62 kJ mol–1 and 284 to 53 ppm, respectively. In contrast, for model M2-2-VO-GaIII-Py, the second oxygen vacancy seems to enhance the Lewis acidity of the adjacent Ga site (ΔEads = −66 kJ mol–1, Δδiso = −32 ppm, ΔΔν8a = +15 cm–1). These data suggest that the Lewis acidity of GaIII sites deduced from the adsorption strength of pyridine depends strongly on the location of the nearby oxygen vacancies with respect to the plane of the adsorbed pyridine (entries 4, 5 and 9, Table 2, Figure 5). The calculated principle components δ11, δ22 and δ33 of the chemical shift tensors (Table S12) plotted as a function of ΔEads for each considered model reveal that δ11 is more sensitive to the variation in adsorption energy relative to δ22 or δ33, as was also observed for pyridine on models of γ-Al2O3 (Figure S31). This is consistent with the fact that δ11 selectively probes the extent of interaction of the pyridine lone pair with the acid sites. (48)

Therefore, we further increased the number of oxygen vacancies on the slab to three and four in M1 and M2 (Figure S21 and Table S8). The calculated acidity parameters in these highly oxygen defective models reveal that the introduction of more than one surface vacancy leads to a strongly diverging behavior of the acidity descriptors. For the M1 model the introduction of an extra vacancy to M1-2VO-GaIII-Py to produce M1-3VO-Py results in an almost 2-fold increase in ΔEads with no significant changes in ν8a and δiso acidity descriptors. This discrepancy between the energetic and spectroscopic acidity descriptors is also noted when 3- and 4-vacancy models are compared (M1-4VO-Py). The introduction of the fourth oxygen vacancy has only a very minor effect on the ΔEads value but causes a pronounced blue shift in ν8a and leads to more deshielded δiso (Δδiso of 100 ppm). Surprisingly, for the M2 model, the increase from two to three vacancies does not lead to strong changes in any of the parameters. Further comparison between M2-3VO-Py and the four-vacancy models M2-4VO-Py displays a moderate increase in ΔEads and a decrease in δiso, respectively, but no change in ν8a. Thus, when more than one surface vacancy is introduced, the two models exhibit very different behaviors. The computed acidity descriptors vary independently in a nonlinear fashion upon such structural modifications of the models.
BAS that may be present at the interface between Ga2O3 and silica were modeled by adsorbing silsesquioxane (POSS) clusters on the surface of M2 (Figure 6), bridging one (POSS-1-PyH+), or two (POSS-2-PyH+ and POSS-3-Py···H) Si atoms between the POSS and the Ga2O3 surface. (101) To model possible steric effects, the POSS was rotated in POSS-3-Py···H in comparison to POSS-1-PyH+ and POSS-2-PyH+. The terminal silanol groups of POSS coordinate to the surface Ga sites, generating acidic Si–(OH)–GaV sites that bind pyridine. The acidity of such sites depends on the placement of the POSS. The calculated ΔEads, δiso, and ν8a values for the adsorbed pyridine indicate a stronger BAS strength in POSS-1-PyH+ and POSS-2-PyH+ in comparison to that in POSS-3-Py···H (Table 3). In the first two configurations, a complete proton transfer from the bridging Si–(OH)–GaV groups to the adsorbed pyridine takes place, whereas the POSS-3-Py···H model features a weaker H-bonding interaction between the BAS and the adsorbed pyridine molecule (Figure 6). The weaker pyridine binding is reflected in a noticeably higher value of δiso = 273 ppm compared to the values of 202 and 211 ppm computed for POSS-1-PyH+ and POSS-2-PyH+. Similarly, the acidity differences between the two types of adsorption complexes are well reflected by the ν8a descriptor (Table 3).

To discard any effects of unit cell expansion and the resulting structural strain in the chemical shift, degrees of expansion of 3% and 10% were simulated for the M2 structure (Table S9). The computed δiso values after the unit cell expansion (260 ppm for 3% and 259 ppm for 10%) are close to that of the unmodified M2 model (260 ppm), which implies that the 15N NMR chemical shifts of pyridine on Ga sites are not sensitive to the change of lattice size. To summarize this section, surprisingly, we have observed that GaV and GaIV sites featured in our models show a stronger pyridine adsorption in comparison to undercoordinated surface GaIII sites. This could be explained by the distortion (variation of bond lengths and angles affecting the site symmetry) induced by the coordination of pyridine to GaIII, leading to a weaker adsorption. Although the first two sites are not affected by the introduction of a neighboring single oxygen vacancy, the introduction of additional vacancies in proximate locations gives rise to strongly deviating results for each model. Such structural modifications affect each acidity parameter to a different extent, likely due to the changes induced by the vacancies on the environment of the adsorption site. Interface BAS between gallia and silica support were simulated by an inverse model represented by a POSS fragment adsorbed on a Ga2O3 surface. The computed acidity parameters δiso and ν8a for such interface BAS models agree well with the spectroscopic data obtained in our pyridine adsorption experiments after correction for the position of the reference band (calculated ν8a mode bands shown in Tables 2 and 3 are based on a reference of the gas-phase pyridine band at 1568 cm–1, while the band position determined by us experimentally is ca. 1578 cm–1 (Table S10)).
4. Discussion
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
While Ga2O3-based catalysts are widely studied for PDH, (1,3,11,102) the nature and distribution of surface sites in gallia remain a matter of debate. (9,11,14,103) Usually, supported gallia catalysts are obtained through impregnation of precursor salts such as gallium nitrate on a support followed by a calcination that gives an amorphous supported gallia phase. (38−43,104) Structural and surface studies carried out in this work were designed to contrast the catalytic performance and the nature of surface sites in the nitrate-derived Ga catalyst Ga/SiO2(600) to well-defined nanocrystalline γ-Ga2O3 and β-Ga2O3 catalysts, both unsupported and dispersed on a silica surface, as well as to α-Ga2O3. The objective of our study was to establish structure-activity relationships in Ga2O3 catalysts for PDH, encompassing activity, selectivity, and stability in PDH as well as coordination environment, structure, acidity, and distribution of the surface sites. According to our evaluations of catalytic activity, β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750), γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600), and Ga/SiO2(600) catalysts are more active but less selective in propane dehydrogenation in comparison to the unsupported α-, β-, and γ-Ga2O3 materials. While the propene formation rates (mol C3H6 mol Ga–1 h–1) decrease with TOS for all catalysts except for Ga/SiO2(600), the formation rate of cracking products (ethene and methane) is mostly stable. This implies that dehydrogenation and cracking of propane proceed on different sites and that cracking sites do not deactivate. According to our dPDF, XANES, and EXAFS results, Ga/SiO2(600) features a well-dispersed and amorphous active phase, containing a larger fraction of surface tetrahedral GaIV sites, i.e., the proposed active sites for PDH (1,6) (yet GaVI sites and, likely, GaV sites are also present in Ga/SiO2(600)) and abundant strong BAS, according to 15N DNP SENS and FTIR studies. A comparison of XANES data between Ga/SiO2(600) and the previously reported single-site catalyst [(≡SiO)3Ga(XOSi≡)], where X is H or Si≡ , which features well-defined and highly dispersed tetracoordinated gallium single sites on SiO2, indicates that Ga/SiO2(600) is not a single-site catalyst. In particular, Ga/SiO2(600) shows a mixture of sites: i.e., 19% of GaIV, 23% of GaV, and 58% of GaVI (on the basis of 71Ga MAS NMR). This distribution of Ga sites makes Ga/SiO2(600) similar to amorphous silica–alumina materials that were shown to contain pentacoordinated Al sites, which influence the strength and availability of BAS. (105) In addition to that, the Lewis acidity of [(≡SiO)3Ga(XOSi≡)] is characterized by a ν8a Py band at 1621 cm–1, which is very similar to that in Ga/SiO2(600) (1620 cm–1). In contrast, 71Ga MAS NMR of γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) only detected GaIV and GaVI sites, more in accordance with what was observed on the respective surfaces by 15N DNP SENS.
Catalysts derived by IWI of Ga(NO3)3 or from grafting showed propene selectivities of above 90% at propane conversions ranging from 9 to 4%. (38,39,106) One Ga/SiO2 catalyst prepared similarly to Ga/SiO2(600) was reported to have propene selectivities >90% at propane conversions between 24 and 20%. (40) This is in contrast to the current results for Ga/SiO2(600) (ca. 50% propene selectivity at around 2.5% stable propane conversion), which illustrates that differences in the catalyst preparation (grafting or IWI, pH, presence of surfactants) and testing (contact times, feed gas composition, temperature) can lead to notably different catalytic performances. It is interesting that Ga/SiO2(600) is the least active of all supported catalysts tested despite the predominance of GaIV surface sites in this catalyst. However, due to the high dispersion of the active phase on silica, differences in the active surface areas in the supported catalysts γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600), β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750), and Ga/SiO2(600) cannot be elucidated. We speculate that the active surface area is likely larger for Ga/SiO2(600) since the Ga2O3 phase in this material is amorphous according to the dPDF data. In contrast, the gallia phase in γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) is nanocrystalline, suggesting a nanoparticle structure with bulk Ga sites. The low selectivity of Ga/SiO2(600) in comparison to the other tested catalysts is likely due to the higher abundance of strong Brønsted acidity in this catalyst that induces cracking. (29−31) Indeed, strong BAS were observed by FTIR only for the Ga/SiO2(600) catalyst. DFT calculations suggest that such strong BAS in Ga/SiO2(600) are due to the interface bridging [(≡Ga(HOSi≡)] moiety formed by the interaction of Lewis acidic Ga centers and surface silanol groups. The stable performance of Ga/SiO2(600) and the lack of coking are thus attributed to tetracoordinated Lewis acidic Ga sites in the presence of strong and abundant Brønsted acidity, which may induce cracking of oligomers.
Although coke deposition blocks cracking sites on Pd- or Pt-based PDH catalysts, which increases selectivity to propene with decreasing propane conversion, (107,108) cracking sites in Ga2O3-based catalysts studied in this work do not deactivate with coking (Figure 2C,F and Figure S11). Therefore, the decrease in propene selectivity observed with coking is due to the stable rates to cracking products and a decreasing propene formation rate during the catalytic test. In contrast to Ga/SiO2(600), all other tested catalysts deposit coke, and contain less abundant strong BAS (i.e., not detected by FTIR but detected by more sensitive 15N DNP SENS) and show a wider range of LAS. Indeed, features of several Lewis adducts are observed in 15N DNP SENS of adsorbed pyridine, consistent with pyridine bonded to tetra-, penta- and possibly, as indicated by DFT results, tricoordinate Lewis acid Ga sites. Tricoordinate LAS have been previously proposed in experimental and computational studies of γ-Al2O3, (19,20) and found computationally in β-Ga2O3. (23) A notable exception is α-Ga2O3(600), as this material does not display surface tri- or tetracoordinated Ga sites, does not feature notable Brønsted acidity by FTIR or 15N DNP SENS, yet it deposits a large amount of coke. This experimental result associates pentacoordinated Ga surface sites with deactivation by carbon deposition. While Ga/SiO2(600) neither deactivated with TOS, nor showed a detectable weight increase in a TGA PDH experiment, the residual coke could still be measured by Raman spectroscopy in a used Ga/SiO2(600) catalyst. This analysis showed more ordered, graphitic coke than coke produced by other tested catalysts, likely due to the presence of more abundant strong Brønsted acidity in Ga/SiO2(600). (109)
The lack of tetracoordinated Ga sites on the surface of α-Ga2O3(600) clearly differentiates it from surfaces of γ-Ga2O3(600) and β-Ga2O3(750), in contrast to previous works that reported similarities between surfaces of those polymorphs. (9,17) In addition, we reported previously using HAADF-STEM that surface and subsurface levels in γ-Ga2O3(600) are preferentially occupied by Ga sites in GaVI crystallographic positions, (16) which suggests that the assessment of the distribution of surface sites based on the abundance of bulk sites may be misleading. According to 15N DNP SENS results, the surfaces of γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) are similar, consistent with the similarities shown by their local structures in dPDF and EXAFS and deactivation profiles in PDH.
However, IR desorption experiments reveal a weaker pyridine binding on β-Ga2O3(750) relative to γ-Ga2O3(600), for both unsupported and silica-supported catalysts, and it is this difference in pyridine binding that differentiates β-Ga2O3(750) from α-Ga2O3(600) and γ-Ga2O3(600). This observation is consistent with the presence of a higher relative fraction of weak LAS in β-Ga2O3(750). Interestingly, such types of sites have been attributed previously to the high activity in propane dehydrogenation; in contrast, the presence of medium and strong Lewis acidity was correlated with lower propene formation rates. (4) Our surface areal (i.e., BET SA normalized) rates are consistent with the literature results, (9,11) as β-Ga2O3(750) outperforms γ-Ga2O3(600) and α-Ga2O3(600). While the surface-normalized initial activities of β-Ga2O3(750) and γ-Ga2O3(600) differ by a factor of 3, the Ga weight normalized activities of γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) differ only by a factor of 1.2. Note that no gallia-based areal rate comparison is available for silica-supported catalysts. Yet, dPDF data indicate that the crystallite size in β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) is 2 times higher than that in γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) (ca. 6 and 3 nm). This suggests a lower gallia surface area in β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750), and therefore the same trend in areal activity holds for supported and unsupported catalysts.
Furthermore, while 15N DNP SENS spectra of β-Ga2O3(750) and γ-Ga2O3(600) at a pyridine desorption temperature of 300 °C are very similar, indicating very similar medium and strong LAS, there is a notable difference between the spectra of β-Ga2O3(750) and γ-Ga2O3(600) after evacuation at 100 °C. At this lower Tdes, a characteristic feature at 281 ppm is observed in β-Ga2O3(750); this feature is minor in the spectrum of γ-Ga2O3(600). We note that distinguishing unequivocally weak LAS and weak BAS on the basis of pyridine FTIR and 15N DNP SENS data is challenging. However, given the overall higher relative fraction of weak LAS in β-Ga2O3(750) by FTIR and comparable relative amounts of hydroxyl groups in β-Ga2O3(750) and γ-Ga2O3(600) (Figure S32), it is more likely that the feature at 281 ppm in unsupported β-Ga2O3(750) is due to weak LAS rather than to weak BAS (a peak at this chemical shift would be consistent with assignment to both weak BAS and weak LAS). It is worth noting that it was reported that no peak at ca. 280 ppm is present for pyridine on γ-Al2O3 at Tdes = 100 °C. (48) This is consistent with the lack of weak LAS on γ-Al2O3 and its lower catalytic activity in PDH in comparison to Ga2O3-based catalysts.
Our DFT calculations, based on ΔEads and the isotropic chemical shift of bound pyridine, allow us to associate weak LAS in β-Ga2O3(750) to GaIII sites. Related tricoordinated Ga single sites on a surface of amorphous silica were predicted by DFT calculations to be efficient in propane PDH, giving facile C–H activation of propane on a Ga–O pair, β-hydrogen elimination of the Ga–propyl intermediate, and H–H coupling, which regenerates the catalyst. (110) To summarize, combined 15N DNP SENS, FTIR, and catalytic data suggest that weak LAS drive activity in Ga-based PDH catalysts.
BAS are observed on all supported catalysts. As already mentioned, FTIR only detects strong BAS for Ga/SiO2(600), although the band is weak. (18) In contrast, the more sensitive 15N DNP SENS technique detects strong BAS for all three silica-supported catalysts but at Tdes = 300 °C (low pyridine coverages). However, likely due to the preferential H-bonding at high pyridine coverages (Tdes = 100 °C), (99) the low intensity of such features make them hardly visible in γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) prior to pyridine desorption at 300 °C. The presence of weak/moderate Brønsted acidity is still observed after desorption at 300 °C, mainly for γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and to a minor extent for β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750). Therefore, this also explains the lower propene selectivity shown by supported nanoparticle catalysts γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750) in comparison to γ-Ga2O3(600) and β-Ga2O3(750). The higher abundance of strong BAS in Ga/SiO2(600) could be linked to the likely presence of GaV sites, as evidenced by 71Ga MAS NMR. This would be in accordance with the evidence gathered in the literature for amorphous silica–alumina, showing that, in addition to AlIV, AlV sites could also form bridging oxygen sites with Si atoms, leading to a noticeable increase in the density of strong BAS. (111)
As inferred from the calculated Py adsorption energy and the 15N chemical shift, pyridine can be adsorbed on GaV and GaIV sites more strongly than on GaIII sites. This counterintuitive trend is likely due to the structural distortion induced in the GaIII site by its local environment preventing pyridine (or other substrate) from interacting strongly with the GaIII sites, which may also facilitate concerted PDH on GaIII sites. With more than one oxygen surface vacancy, ΔEads, δiso, and ν8a acidity descriptors show a nonuniform sensitivity to the structural changes of the acid sites, and no strong correlations were observed among these acidity parameters. We note that previous DFT studies on γ-Al2O3 (a structural isomorph of γ-Ga2O3) have shown that pentacoordinated Al sites are more likely to undergo a stepwise PDH mechanism via alkyl intermediates than to follow a concerted (direct) dehydrogenation pathway. (25) We hypothesize that these PDH pathways calculated for γ-Al2O3 may proceed similarly also for Ga2O3 polymorphs: i.e., via similar transition states and intermediates, including Ga propyl species. Such alkyl intermediates could further decompose to produce coke precursors if the β-hydrogen transfer from Ga–propyl forming propene is a slow step (Scheme 2). By analogy, this suggests that propyl groups on the pentacoordinated Ga surface sites could be related to the catalyst coking. Indeed, with the exception of Ga/SiO2(600), all other tested catalysts show significant coking and deactivation with TOS, most prominently α-Ga2O3(600), which forms primarily pentacoordinated Lewis acidic surface Ga sites. An alternative mechanism for coking includes oligomerization of produced alkenes (propene, ethene). (112)

5. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
We have provided evidence that weak Lewis acid sites likely drive PDH on gallia catalysts. Surface sites of nanoparticles of γ-Ga2O3(600) and β-Ga2O3(750) contain tetra-, penta-, and very likely tricoordinated Lewis acidic Ga sites, with a larger fraction of weaker LAS in β-Ga2O3(750) relative to γ-Ga2O3(600). Since β-Ga2O3(750) has a notably higher catalytic activity in PDH in comparison to γ-Ga2O3(600) and α-Ga2O3(600), weak LAS are proposed to drive propene formation during propane dehydrogenation. Such weak LAS are likely tricoordinated, as DFT studies on model gallia surfaces suggest that GaIII sites adsorb pyridine with a lower ΔEads value (i.e., are weaker LAS) in comparison to GaV and GaIV sites. The weaker Lewis acidity of GaIII sites correlates with a more deshielded calculated 15N chemical shift of adsorbed pyridine, in comparison to GaIV and GaV sites. The calculated 15N chemical shift for a pyridine–GaIII Lewis adduct is very close to the experimentally observed peak for β-Ga2O3(750) attributed therefore to weak LAS. The nitrate-derived benchmark catalyst Ga/SiO2(600) lacked weak LAS and as such showed a low PDH activity and propene selectivity. Ga/SiO2(600) did not deactivate with TOS, nor did it show significant coking. The low selectivity exhibited by Ga/SiO2(600) is due to the more significant cracking of propane to methane and ethene, relative to the other catalysts tested. This is explained by the more abundant, strong Brønsted acidity in Ga/SiO2(600). The high stability of Ga/SiO2(600) with TOS with negligible coking is also explained by the abundant, strong BAS that can also induce the cracking of oligomers. The strong Brønsted acidity is likely connected to the presence of GaV sites as detected by 71Ga MAS NMR. (113) Yet, no pyridine-bound surface GaV sites were detected in Ga/SiO2(600) by 15N DNP SENS experiments (in comparison to the spectra of α-Ga2O3(600) reference). The interaction between Ga2O3 nanoparticles and silica induces strong Brønsted acidity in γ-Ga2O3/SiO2(600) and β-Ga2O3/SiO2(750), revealed by 15N DNP SENS, while only mild and weak BAS are captured by FTIR in these materials. Our results suggest that deactivation by carbon deposition could take place on pentacoordinated Ga LAS. A likely reason for this deactivation is the slow β-hydrogen transfer step of alkyl intermediates, which do not form propene easily but may dehydrogenate, leading ultimately to coke deposition. On the other hand, strong BAS contribute to cracking but can prevent coking. Further work in our laboratories focuses on simultaneously controlling the coordination geometry of Ga sites and the strength and abundance of LAS and BAS.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
