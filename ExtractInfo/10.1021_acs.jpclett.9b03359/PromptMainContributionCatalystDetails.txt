Chain Length Dependence of Hydrogen Bond Linkages between Cationic Constituents in Hydroxy-Functionalized Ionic Liquids: Tracking Bulk Behavior to the Molecular Level with Cold Cluster Ion Spectroscopy
Abstract
Hydroxy functionalization of cations in ionic liquids (ILs) can lead to formation of contacts between their OH groups [so-called (c–c) interactions]. One class of these linkages involves cooperatively enhanced hydrogen bonds to anionic partners that are sufficiently strong to overcome the repulsion between two positively charged centers. Herein, we clarify how the propensity for the formation of (c–c) contacts depends on the alkyl chain length between two cationic rings and their OH groups by analyzing the temperature-dependent IR spectra of bulk ILs as well as the vibrational predissociation spectra of ∼35 K complexes comprised of two cations and one anion. This study compares the behavior of two cationic derivatives with ethyl and propyl chains complexed with two different anions: bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide and tetrafluoroborate. Only the bulk ILs with the longer chain propyl derivative [HPMPip+ = 1-(3-hydroxypropyl)-1-methylpiperidinium] display (c–c) interactions. Molecular-level aspects of this docking arrangement are revealed by analyzing the OH stretching fundamentals displayed by the ternary complexes.

Because the local interactions among the ionic constituents can be tailored (1,2) to optimize physicochemical properties for specific applications, (3−8) room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are playing an increasingly important role in synthetic chemistry. (9−12) Here we are concerned with ILs that are composed of hydroxy-functionalized molecular cations (Scheme 1a,b). This design motif has been shown to increase the resulting IL viscosities, (5,13−18) presumably due to the formation of H-bonds between the OH groups of the nominally repulsive cations. This phenomenon has been dubbed a cation–cation or (c–c) interaction in the literature (19−26) and is evidenced by the appearance of a broad, red-shifted feature (3200–3450 cm–1) in the OH stretching region in the IR spectra of the bulk ILs at low (∼200 K) temperature. (19−23) In a recent study, the vibrational spectra of several hydroxylated ILs with the bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (NTf2– in Scheme 1c) anion were measured as a function of temperature over the range of 193–353 K, (23) and it was reported that the hydroxyethyl cation, 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-methylpiperidinium (HEMPip+, Scheme 1a) did not display the telltale (c–c) band. This raises the question of whether lengthening the chain to the hydroxy group can effectively tune (c–c) interactions by controlling the distance between the repulsive centers of positive charge and the attractive hydroxy groups. We therefore extended the temperature-dependent survey to include the HPMPip+ cation (Scheme 1b) as well as the tetrafluoroborate (BF4–) anion (Scheme 1d). These cations feature the same positive charge motif, but the OH group is displaced away from it by one CH2 link in the longer alkyl chain. The BF4– anion was chosen to explore the role of charge localization on the counterion. In addition, because FT-IR spectra of the bulk ILs can only provide a qualitative picture of the local interactions at play, in this work, we also exploited cryogenic ion vibrational predissociation (CIVP) spectroscopy (24−32) of mass-isolated cluster ions in the gas phase as a means with which to reveal the molecular-level contacts among the ionic constituents (Scheme 1). (24−27,29−32) The cluster results are compared with the behavior of the bulk ILs and interpreted with the aid of electronic structure calculations.

The synthetic protocols for the ILs with the constituents displayed in Scheme 1 are provided in the Supporting Information (SI). A comparison of the infrared spectra obtained for neat [HEMPip][NTf2] at 213 and 353 K is presented in Figure 1a in the blue and red traces, respectively, which are reproduced from the earlier study. (23) The dominant band near 3500 cm–1 arises from the stretching fundamentals of the OH groups and appears as a single, asymmetrical feature with a weak shoulder on the low-energy side that grows slightly with decreasing temperature. In contrast, the spectrum of the IL with the propyl analogue, HPMPip+, (Figure 1b) displays a dramatic change as the temperature is lowered to reveal a very intense, broad feature centered at 3335 cm–1. This is the telltale signature of a cooperative (c–c) interaction between the OH groups on the cations. A similar feature (Figure 1c) is observed in the spectrum of the IL with HPMPip+ paired with the BF4– anion (Scheme 1d). Note that the spectra for the ethyl derivative ([HEMPip][BF4]) are not presented here because it crystallizes at room temperature and therefore could not be measured in our transmission cells.

FT-IR spectra in the OH stretching region for the ILs, (a) [HEMPip][NTf2], (b) [HPMPip][NTf2], and (c) [HPMPip][BF4], obtained at cold and warm temperatures (blue and red traces, respectively), as indicated in the insets. The vibrational bands below 3200 cm–1 are due to CH stretching bands, while features in the 3200–3450 cm–1 range signal cooperative (c–c) H-bonding between the hydroxy tails of the cations; the 3450–3650 cm–1 region is assigned to single cation–anion (c–a) H-bonds. Trace (a) is reproduced from ref (23) under the CC BY 4.0 license.
In several recent studies from our groups, (24,25) we have traced the molecular-level nature of the (c–c) interactions to very simple systems involving just two cations and one anion, hereafter referred to as (2,1). We therefore also investigated whether the differences in the propensity for (c–c) interactions between the HEMPip+ and HPMPip+ systems, evident in the bulk solutions, could be traced to the behavior of these ternary cationic complexes.
The gas-phase cluster ions were generated by electrospray ionization (ESI) of IL samples dissolved in acetonitrile to millimolar concentrations and cooled to ∼35 K in a cryogenic ion trap before injection into a triple focusing photofragmentation mass spectrometer. (28) Vibrational spectra of the size-selected ions were then acquired in a linear action mode by photoevaporation of weakly bound (binding energy: ∼800 cm–1) N2 adducts, as described in detail in previous reports on application of the method to IL systems. (24−26)
The vibrational spectra of the (2,1) clusters of the ethyl and propyl derivatives with the NTf2– anion are displayed in Figures 2a and 2c, respectively. The spectra of both complexes over an extended region that includes both the OH and CH stretching fundamentals are presented in Figure S1. As was the case in the spectral behavior of the bulk solutions, the spectra of the two ternary cations are quite different, with the propyl derivative displaying significantly (∼200 cm–1) red-shifted features (A3,4 in Figure 2c) in the OH stretching region. The ethyl derivative, on the other hand, yields two bands (A1 and A2) that are close to the peak in the bulk absorption spectrum (dotted line). Note that the gas-phase spectrum of the (HEMPip+)2NTf2– ion also displays a weak feature in the location expected for a free OH stretching fundamental (νOHfree), such that the dominant bands (A1,2) are shifted about 150 cm–1 below it. This modest shift is similar to that observed previously (25,33) in ternary systems in which both OH groups bind independently to the anion [via a (c–a–c) motif]. The observation of the high-energy free OH feature is important because it reveals that another structure is in play where at least one of the two cations binds to the anion by contact with the positive charge center rather than through its OH group. Note that this motif (which yields the νOHfree band) is observed only for the ethyl derivative because there is no activity in the free OH region in the spectrum of the propyl analogue (Figure 2c). (34,35)
Figure 2
Figure 2. Vibrational predissociation spectra of N2-tagged (a) (HEMPip+)2NTf2– and (c) (HPMPip+)2NTf2–. The gray dotted lines in traces (a) and (c) are reproduced from the cold FT-IR spectra of bulk ILs from Figure 1. The Ax=1–4 labels denote H-bonded OH features (colored red) of the ternary complexes. The extension of the alkyl chain length from ethyl to propyl yields a ∼200 cm–1 red shift in the OH stretching region [red arrow above (c)]. The locations of peaks A3 and A4 are typical for (c–c–a) formation, (24) whereas A1 and A2 are consistent with systems that feature independent binding of the OH groups to the anion (c–a). The free OH peak is highlighted in orange. Frequencies of observed transitions are tabulated in Table S1. These spectra are compared to those calculated (B3LYP-D3/6-31+G(d), scaled by 0.97) (25) for low-energy isomers (with structures in Figure 3a,b and c–e), which are presented inverted in traces (b) and (d) for the ethyl and propyl cations, respectively. The sticks that are colored in blue, orange, and purple represent the isomers of classes I, II, and III, respectively, with two distinct structures belonging to class I, labeled tentatively as I (turquoise) and I′ (dark blue).
Although the highest energy feature in the (HPMPip+)2NTf2– spectrum (A2, Figure 2c) lies quite close to the A2 band in the ethyl system, this now becomes the weakest of its three distinct features. The dominant bands (A3,4) that occur with red shifts are typical for ternary systems that feature a cooperative H-bonding interaction to the anion [via the (c–c–a) motif], e.g., 3379–3409 cm–1 observed for (HEMIm+)2NTf2– [HEMIm+ = 1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-3-methylimidazolium]. (24) This behavior suggests that the A2 feature likely arises from another isomer with a (c–a–c) arrangement.
To better understand how the chain lengths to the hydroxy groups modify the ionic interactions, we turn to the expectations for the intermolecular docking arrangements from electronic structure calculations. To this end, various structural configurations were surveyed using the B3LYP-D3/6-31+G(d) level of theory, (36) allowing us to identify three classes of assembly motifs for the (2,1) ternary cations of the two ILs. The complete results from the survey are provided in the SI (Figures S2 and S3), along with the results for the complexes with the BF4– anion. Rotatable pdfs for all of these structures are provided in Figure S4, with their XYZ coordinates compiled in Table S2. Of the three main types of isomers, we chose the two (Figure 3) that best reproduce the experimental bands observed. The bands arising from the various isomers are color-coded and presented in Figure 2b,d for the ethyl and propyl cationic species, respectively. In class I, which is found only in the propyl system (with two plausible structures, I and I′), the two OH groups adopt a (c–c–a) motif, with the stretches of the IH (intercationic H-bonded) and AD (acceptor–donor) OH groups bound to one of the S═O groups of NTf2– assigned to the observed A4–2 bands. Class II, which is observed only in the ethyl system, yields a free OH stretch as one of the cations attaches closer to the anion via its positive charge center, while the other cation binds through its OH group. (24) Finally, in class III, which is identified as a low-energy isomer type for both cations, the two OH groups are docked to different S═O groups on NTf2–, accounting for the modest red shift of the bands in ethyl, and likely contribute to the A2 band of the propyl complex.

Calculated minimum-energy (2,1) isomers of the HEMPip+ and HPMPip+ with NTf2– anions (B3LYP-D3/6-31+G(d)), presented in the order of their relative energies, that best matched with the experimental spectra based on the comparisons (inverted bars) in Figure 2. F atoms of NTf2– and alkyl chain H atoms of the cations are omitted for clarity. Labels A1–4 indicate groups nominally assigned to bands indicated in Figure 2. The calculated electrostatic potential maps (34,35) are shown on the right. The positively charged regions are indicated in blue, negatively charged regions are in red, and nonpolar regions are colored white.
Note that the assignment of the A4,3 bands to specific OH groups in class I isomers of the propyl cationic cluster is different from that previously reported for the (HEMIm+)2NTf2–, (24) where the (AD) OH group that is closer to the anion contributes the largest red shift (272 cm–1) and the donor (IH) OH yields a fundamental to the blue (by 60 cm–1) of the bound OH. Our calculations indicate that in the (HPMPip+)2NTf2– system, this order is reversed, such that the most red-shifted feature arises from the IH OH group. A key feature of the calculated type I structure of the (HPMPip+)2NTf2– complex that underlies this difference in spectral signature is that the cooperatively H-bonded OH groups from the two cations are docked on sulfonyl groups of NTf2– instead of the negatively charged N atom, as was reported in the case of (HEMIm+)2NTf2–. (24) As a result of the weaker binding strength with the anion, the feature of the AD OH stretch red shifts only by ∼240 cm–1 and falls on the A2 position. Depending on which sulfonyl group of the anion that the (c–c) interaction is bound to, the IH OH feature could appear at either the A3 or A4 position (Figure 2d), red-shifting by as much as 300 cm–1. This is evident by the two different calculated structures of class I displayed in Figure 3c,e (labeled as isomers I and I′, respectively), where the cooperatively bound OH groups are attached to oxygen atoms on opposite sides of the N– on the anion.
Because the NTf2– anion is rather large, offering distal attachment sites for OH docking, we extended the cluster study to include the spectroscopic behavior of the ternary (HPMPip+)2BF4– complex with the more compact BF4– ion (Scheme 1d), with the spectrum compared with that of (HPMPip+)2NTf2– in Figure 4. The bands in the BF4– complex (Figure 4b) evolve from the closely spaced triplet (A2–4) into two well-separated features (A3,4), suggesting the formation of a (c–c–a) motif (I), rather than III (c–a–c). To identify this structure and explore the fundamental reason for the strong red shift, 100 structures of the (HPMPip+)2BF4– complex were calculated, out of which 4 of them predicted the A3,4 band positions and separation. The lowest-energy structure out of the four (also, the fourth lowest energy out of the total of 100 surveyed) shows that the (c–c) OH···OH bond is distorted to adopt a nearly right-angle (∼105°) docking motif onto only one of the F atoms of the BF4– anion (instead of a bifurcated bond to two F atoms), while the three other F atoms bind to various CH groups of the cations (at bond distances of 2.3–2.4 Å). As these CH groups pull electron density away from the anion, the OH···F (c–a) interaction becomes weakened, while the intercationic (c–c) H-bond becomes strengthened, thus resulting in the strongest red-shifted (A4) band observed (see Figure S3 for the calculated structure and band comparison). These A3,4 peaks fall within the envelope spanned by the bands observed for the larger NTf2– anion (Figure 4a). Although we expect two bands for the (c–c–a) structures, thus accounting for the doublet in the spectrum, we acknowledge that it is possible that the A3 band of (HPMPip+)2BF4– could also contain a contribution from (c–a–c) structures. We note that for both anions the (c–c) bands in the bulk propyl ILs at low temperature are considerably more red-shifted than those in the corresponding (2,1) clusters. As such, it is likely that the presence of counterions, as well as the formation of longer cooperative H-bonded domains, contributes to the bulk behavior.

The 2800–3200 cm–1 region (purple) is associated with the alkyl CH stretching bands. Frequencies of observed transitions are tabulated in Table S1.
As a qualitative indication of the relative roles of electrostatics and localized H-bonding, in Figure 3, we present the electrostatic potential maps for the various isomer classes. Cursory inspection of these maps indicates that the Coulombic attraction between oppositely charged ions is the dominant interaction, as seen by the alternating regions of opposite charge. One feature evident in this display is that the short length of the ethyl chain on HEMPip+ does not allow the hydroxyalkyl tail to easily curl around and attach to the anion through both available docking sites, i.e., the N+ atom and OH group.
Our results provide a microscopic perspective on the local interactions in bulk ILs derived from earlier MD simulations of hydroxy-functionalized HOCnMIm+ cations with the strongly interacting NO3– anion, (17) which have indicated that the number of (c–c) H-bonds increases monotonically with the chain length of hydroxylated cations in ILs up to 10 carbons. The viscosities of these ILs were also measured to increase with chain lengths, an effect that has thus far been rationalized by an increase in the van der Waals interactions between long alkyl chains along with suppressed side-chain mobility. (16,18) Our results, as well as the MD simulations, (17) suggest that another reason for the higher viscosity might be due to the increasing importance of (c–c) interactions brought about by longer chain lengths. We note, however, that these simulations were carried out at higher temperature (400 K); therefore, the similarities with these experiments must be taken cautiously. We also note that if the chain lengths are too long, it may also enhance intramolecular H-bonding, especially for systems in which the cationic species has a strong H-bond donor. The latter effect has been found to be particularly important in the interactions involving the C(2)H site of the imidazolium ring, where oxygen atoms incorporated into the side chain have been observed to adopt intramolecular, cyclic H-bonding arrangements. (32)
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the extension of the hydroxyalkyl group of the cations by one CH2 linkage increases the propensity for (c–c) interactions in bulk ILs at low temperature as well as in the structures of cold, isolated complexes consisting of two cations and one anion. Specifically, the spectrum of the cold [HPMPip][NTf2] liquid displayed a large (∼300 cm–1) red shift in the OH stretching region, which was partially recovered in the spectrum of the (2,1) cationic complex. The strong features in the cluster ion spectra are assigned to (c–c–a) interactions by comparing to the calculated harmonic frequencies obtained for various structural isomers. It is important to emphasize that this work reveals how the bulk trend is also on display in microscopic systems at low temperature, which can be subjected to unambiguous structural analysis. We cannot, however, conclude that these structures (the ternary cations) are the exclusive carriers of the bulk bands, which likely also involve (c–c) interactions and longer chains. For example, because the spectra of the smallest ternary cationic system only recover about 70% of the shifts displayed by the bands in the bulk IL, it would be useful to extend the cluster study to larger systems so as to better mimic the interactions driving macroscopic behavior.

Abstract
Scheme 1
Scheme 1. Structures of (a) 1-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-1-methylpiperidinium (HEMPip+) and (b) 1-(3-Hydroxypropyl)-1-methylpiperidinium (HPMPip+) Cations, along with the (c) Bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (NTf2–) and (d) Tetrafluoroborate (BF4–) Anionsa
aThe double-headed arrows indicate the calculated distance (using the B3LYP-D3/6-31+G(d) level of theory) from the positively charged nitrogen atom of the cation to the oxygen atom of the hydroxy group.
Figure 1
Figure 1. FT-IR spectra in the OH stretching region for the ILs, (a) [HEMPip][NTf2], (b) [HPMPip][NTf2], and (c) [HPMPip][BF4], obtained at cold and warm temperatures (blue and red traces, respectively), as indicated in the insets. The vibrational bands below 3200 cm–1 are due to CH stretching bands, while features in the 3200–3450 cm–1 range signal cooperative (c–c) H-bonding between the hydroxy tails of the cations; the 3450–3650 cm–1 region is assigned to single cation–anion (c–a) H-bonds. Trace (a) is reproduced from ref (23) under the CC BY 4.0 license.
Figure 2
Figure 2. Vibrational predissociation spectra of N2-tagged (a) (HEMPip+)2NTf2– and (c) (HPMPip+)2NTf2–. The gray dotted lines in traces (a) and (c) are reproduced from the cold FT-IR spectra of bulk ILs from Figure 1. The Ax=1–4 labels denote H-bonded OH features (colored red) of the ternary complexes. The extension of the alkyl chain length from ethyl to propyl yields a ∼200 cm–1 red shift in the OH stretching region [red arrow above (c)]. The locations of peaks A3 and A4 are typical for (c–c–a) formation, (24) whereas A1 and A2 are consistent with systems that feature independent binding of the OH groups to the anion (c–a). The free OH peak is highlighted in orange. Frequencies of observed transitions are tabulated in Table S1. These spectra are compared to those calculated (B3LYP-D3/6-31+G(d), scaled by 0.97) (25) for low-energy isomers (with structures in Figure 3a,b and c–e), which are presented inverted in traces (b) and (d) for the ethyl and propyl cations, respectively. The sticks that are colored in blue, orange, and purple represent the isomers of classes I, II, and III, respectively, with two distinct structures belonging to class I, labeled tentatively as I (turquoise) and I′ (dark blue).
Figure 3
Figure 3. Calculated minimum-energy (2,1) isomers of the HEMPip+ and HPMPip+ with NTf2– anions (B3LYP-D3/6-31+G(d)), presented in the order of their relative energies, that best matched with the experimental spectra based on the comparisons (inverted bars) in Figure 2. F atoms of NTf2– and alkyl chain H atoms of the cations are omitted for clarity. Labels A1–4 indicate groups nominally assigned to bands indicated in Figure 2. The calculated electrostatic potential maps (34,35) are shown on the right. The positively charged regions are indicated in blue, negatively charged regions are in red, and nonpolar regions are colored white.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Vibrational predissociation spectra of N2-tagged (a) (HPMPip+)2NTf2– and (b) (HPMPip+)2BF4–. The Ax=2–4 labels denote H-bonded OH features (colored red) of the ternary complexes. The 2800–3200 cm–1 region (purple) is associated with the alkyl CH stretching bands. Frequencies of observed transitions are tabulated in Table S1.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
