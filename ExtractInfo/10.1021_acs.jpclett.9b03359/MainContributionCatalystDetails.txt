 Unfortunately, the provided documents do not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation research. The documents focus on the properties of ionic liquids and do not discuss catalyst performance for converting propane to propylene. Since there are no extracts related to PDH or ODH, I cannot provide a synthesized summary.
