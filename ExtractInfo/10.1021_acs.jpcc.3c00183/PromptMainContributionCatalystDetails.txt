Effect of the Molecular Structure of Surface Vanadia on Activity and Regenerability of VOx/In2O3 Catalysts for CO2-Assisted Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Propane
Abstract
Our recent work has reported that higher propylene selectivity and improved stability can be achieved by combining redox-active VOx and basic In2O3 for CO2-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (CO2-ODHP). In the present work, we continued to explore the stability and regenerability of V/In catalysts. In particular, our interest lies in identifying the effect of mono- and polyvanadate on catalytic performance and regenerability. A V/In catalyst with an increased proportion of monovanadate was prepared using the Schlenk line under moisture-free conditions (V/In–S), while the fully polymerized vanadate catalyst was prepared through a regular impregnation (V/In) for comparison. The Schlenk-line-prepared catalyst, namely, V/In–S, not only exhibits a 17–30% enhanced propylene yield at high temperatures (500–540 °C) over V/In but also presents improved stability and regenerability with nearly 88% activity recovered after regeneration in O2. Detailed characterizations have been performed to reveal the catalyst structure–performance relationship, including chemisorption (NH3/CO2-temperature-programmed desorption, NH3/CO2-TPD), H2-temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), and spectroscopic studies [Raman spectroscopy, UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS), near-ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), and high-sensitivity low-energy ion scattering (HS-LEIS)]. Characterization results demonstrate that compared with polyvanadates, monovanadates lead to strengthened interaction with In2O3 and a more stabilized V/In surface and subsurface, as well as improved redox properties of VOx. These advantages give rise to the observed enhancement in activity, stability, and regenerability. These findings advance the understanding of the relationship between the activity/stability and the molecular structure of surface oxide species (vanadia) and the interplay between acid–base interactions and redox properties of mixed metal-oxide catalysts for efficient CO2-ODHP.

As a raw material for a variety of chemical products, propylene (C3H6) is one of the most important starting products in the petrochemical industry. (1) In addition to steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking technologies, (2) “on-purpose propylene technologies”, such as the dehydrogenation of propane (DHP), reached a market share of ≤22% in 2018. (3) The propylene yield of DHP can be as high as 85%, (3) making it a promising alternative to fill the demand–supply gap. (1,4) An example of DHP implementation is the Oleflex process (Honeywell, UOP). (2,5,6) Meanwhile, DHP has intrinsic challenges. For example, the endothermicity of DHP requires higher temperatures where coking and thermal cracking are inevitable. (7) Oxidative DHP (ODHP) has emerged recently and provides avenues to overcome the above issues. (8) Oxygen (O2) has been widely used as an oxidant for ODHP, benefiting from a lack of a thermodynamic limit and active coke removal. Despite these advantages, the major challenge for O2-ODHP lies in the overoxidation to undesired carbon oxides (COx). (1,9)
Recently, boron-based catalysts such as boron oxide and boron nitride have become promising candidates for O2-ODHP since the presence of unique gas-phase radical chemistry leads to a higher selectivity toward light alkenes (ethylene and propylene) and a negligible COx selectivity. (10−20) Alternatively, replacing oxygen with soft oxidants is an effective approach to suppress overoxidation, with options including carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and sulfur oxide (SO2). (21) Among them, CO2-assisted ODHP (CO2-ODHP) has been primarily studied as it offers the potential to recycle CO2, aligning it with the push for carbon capture, utilization, and storage. (8,21)
CO2-ODHP is endothermic, and potential side reactions include reverse water–gas shift (RWGS) and propane dry reforming (PDR). (8,21,22) Similarly to O2-ODHP, mostly redox-active metal oxides have been studied for CO2-ODHP, including vanadium oxide (VOx) and chromium oxide (CrOx). (8,21) On VOx, dehydrogenation proceeds through the Mars–van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, in which the redox cycle of VOx is of significance. (1) There are two proposed reaction cycles. The first scenario proposes that CO2-ODHP is a net reaction of two reactions, namely, DHP and RWGS. (8,23) Alternatively, the reaction can produce CO from CO2 without undergoing a separate RWGS route after direct propane dehydrogenation on the surface. (24) The toxic and carcinogenic properties of Cr(VI) oxides, however, make CrOx unattractive for industrial services. Nonredox metal oxides such as gallium oxide (Ga2O3) and indium oxide (In2O3), over which the reaction is proposed to proceed through a heterolytic dissociation on acid–base pairs such as Gaδ+–O2– pairs, have also been suggested as catalysts for CO2-ODHP. (8,21,23,25−29) These nonredox catalysts present propylene selectivities comparable to those of redox-active ones (e.g., CrOx) under isoconversional conditions. (21) A key factor in manipulating the ODHP reactivity of these nonredox catalysts is the balance of the acid–base surface properties. (8) For example, strong acid sites lead to side reactions, while strong basic sites favor CO2 adsorption and activation over C–H activation, both of which result in decreased C3H6 selectivity. (8) Rapid deactivation is another challenge, which can be ascribed to coking and loss of active sites. (21) Coking is less an issue, as it is typically reversible by reoxidation. (30,31) However, recovering active sites is more challenging. Botavina et al. prepared highly dispersed Cr–SiO2 catalysts by the one-pot hydrothermal synthesis. (32) The as-prepared catalysts demonstrate better stability after 900 min time on stream (TOS) for ODHP in the joint presence of O2 and CO2 than in O2 alone. Baek et al. prepared MSU (Michigan State University)-x-supported Cr catalysts with highly dispersed Cr species, (33) leading to improved regenerability by oxidation in air. Evidently, improving the dispersion of active sites is a feasible approach to retain stability and improve regenerability.
Our recent work reported the improved selectivity and stability of VOx/In2O3 catalysts for CO2-ODHP in comparison to In2O3 alone. (34) VOx surface sites were shown to (i) improve propylene selectivity and stability by inhibiting the deep reduction of In2O3, (ii) neutralize excess basic sites on In2O3, thereby suppressing PDR, and (iii) introduce additional redox sites that participate in the dehydrogenation reaction by utilizing CO2 as a soft oxidant. (34) In that work, we observed that a catalyst with a VOx atomic density of 1.6 V nm–2 exhibited a higher C3H6 yield (3.3%) than other V/In catalysts (2.5–2.9%) at 540 °C. Characterization results indicated a joint presence of mono- and polyvanadate (dominant) surface molecular structures for the 1.6V/In catalyst and fully polymerized vanadate in the other V/In catalysts with a higher VOx loading. This suggested that monomers have a positive role in improving the catalytic performance of V/In catalysts. The possible beneficial effect of the VOx molecular structure on the stability of V/In catalysts is yet to be explored. Isolated monomeric VOx binds stronger with the support materials in comparison to polymeric VOx. (35) Based on this known feature and our previous work, we propose that forming more monovanadate could help strengthen the interaction between In2O3 and VOx and further inhibit the deep reduction of In2O3 under reaction conditions. Thus, improved stability and regenerability should be expected. These factors provide the motivation for the study of the effect of the surface VOx molecular structure (monovanadate vs polyvanadate) on the catalytic performance, stability, and regenerability of V/In catalysts for CO2-ODHP.
To increase the proportion of monovanadate while keeping the V loading constant, a grafting method was used under anhydrous conditions with vanadium isopropoxide and 2-propanol as the vanadium precursor and solvent, respectively. (1,36,37) For comparison, regular impregnation was also used to prepare the catalyst with the same V loading. To provide insight into the catalyst structure and surface chemistry, catalysts were characterized by H2 temperature-programed reduction (H2-TPR), CO2 temperature-programed desorption (CO2-TPD), NH3 temperature-programed desorption (NH3-TPD), UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis DRS), near-ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (NAP-XPS), and high-sensitivity low-energy ion scattering (HS-LEIS). The correlation of catalyst structure and regenerability, particularly in terms of monomeric and polymeric VOx and their relationship with In2O3, was elucidated.

2.1. Catalyst Preparation
In2O3 (surface area, ∼70 m2 g–1) was prepared by the calcination of In(OH)3. A detailed procedure has been reported elsewhere. (34,38) VOx-loaded In2O3 catalysts were prepared via the impregnation of In2O3 with vanadium isopropoxide (OV(OCH(CH3)2)3) in a 2-propanol solution using a Schlenk line. (36) In2O3 was precalcined at 550 °C prior to impregnation. The calcined In2O3 was loaded into a fritted reactor with one end sealed with a rubber septum and the other connected with the Schlenk line. Initially, In2O3 was evacuated at 200 °C for 1 h for dehydration and cooled down to room temperature, followed by switching to a nitrogen atmosphere. A desired amount of vanadium isopropoxide (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 mL of anhydrous 2-propanol (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) were injected into the reactor. The solution was stirred overnight and dried via vacuum filtration. After switching to a nitrogen atmosphere, the impregnated sample was dried at 200 °C for 1 h, followed by cooling down to room temperature. The sample was finally calcined at 550 °C for 3 h with a ramp rate of 5 °C min–1. For comparison, a VOx/In2O3 catalyst was also prepared by impregnation in an aqueous solution of ammonium metavanadate NH4VO3 (99.0%, Sigma-Aldrich) at 80 °C. The impregnated sample was dried at 100 °C overnight and calcined using the same procedure. The vanadium loading was fixed at 2 wt %, at which the surface VOx approaches a monolayer coverage and features a higher propylene selectivity than other loadings. (34) The actual V loading was determined by the elemental analysis using ICP results (Table S1). Catalysts were denoted as V/In–S and V/In, representing the catalysts prepared by impregnation using the Schlenk line and the regular impregnation, respectively.
2.2. Activity Tests
An activity test of the CO2-ODHP reaction was performed using an Altamira Instruments system (AMI-200). The detailed procedure has been reported in our recent work and is described in brief herein. (34) Typically, 100 mg of the catalyst was diluted with 600 mg of quartz sand (60–80 mesh), and the resultant mixture was loaded in a quartz U tube (i.d. = 10 mm). Prior to the activity test, the catalyst bed was pretreated in 2% CO2/Ar at 500 °C for 1 h. Then, the test was initiated by switching to the reaction gas mixture using 5% C3H8/He and 2% CO2/Ar with C3H8/CO2 = 1 and gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) = 18000 mL g–1 h–1. The temperature range for activity evaluation was 350–540 °C, and the reaction at each temperature was maintained for 2 h. Reactivity at each temperature was based on averaging the data collected during this 2 h time window. Compositions of effluent gas were analyzed periodically using an online SRI 8610C gas chromatograph equipped with both TCD and FID.
2.3. Characterization
Elemental analysis was performed using ion-coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on a PerkinElmer Avio 500 model instrument. The ICP-determined vanadium composition for V/In–S was slightly lower than that for V/In prepared by regular impregnation (Table S1). The normalized V density of both catalysts was around 3.1–3.4 V nm–2 (based on the BET surface area of In2O3).
NH3-TPD, CO2-TPD, and H2-TPR were performed using the AMI 200 system. For each measurement, about 50 mg of fresh catalysts was charged into a U-tube quartz reactor. In NH3-TPD, the catalyst was pretreated in Ar at 500 °C for 1 h. NH3 adsorption (2% NH3/He) was carried out at 120 °C for 1 h (30 mL min–1), followed by Ar flush for 1 h. TPD was then initiated by ramping from 120 to 730 °C (5 °C min–1) in Ar (30 mL min–1) and maintained for 0.5 h. In CO2-TPD, after a similar pretreatment, CO2 adsorption (2% CO2/Ar, 30 mL min–1) was performed at 140 °C for 1 h, followed by Ar flush and cooling. TPD was performed from 50 to 620 °C (5 °C min–1) in Ar (30 mL min–1) and maintained for 0.5 h. In H2-TPR, the pretreated catalyst was reduced in 4% H2/Ar (30 mL min–1) ramped from 50 to 830 °C (5 °C min–1) and maintained for 1 h. For both NH3– and CO2-TPD measurements, a mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum), coupled with AMI 200, was used to monitor the real-time fragments of the species from the effluent gas. A TCD was used to record the H2 signals, and a cooling trap was applied prior to the detector.
The surface region elemental oxidation states and composition were monitored by NAP-XPS. Spectra of the VOx/In2O3 catalyst were acquired in a SPECS DeviSim NAP reaction cell coupled with a PHOIBOS 150 NAP electron energy analyzer equipped with an XR 50 MF Al Kα X-ray source (1486.7 eV). The possible reduction of In in the surface region was monitored using the In Auger spectra. (39) The spectra were acquired after 1 h consecutive treatments at 500 °C of 10% O2/Ar, 5% CO2/Ar, 2.5% C3H8/2.5% CO2/Ar, and 5% CO2/Ar. Detailed procedures have been reported elsewhere. (34) The resulting spectra were processed using CasaXPS (version 2.3.22PR1.0). Due to the lack of strong C 1s spectra after the initial in situ oxidation of the catalyst, the O 1s spectra were used for binding energy correction. While some contribution by the VOx species existed, In2O3 contributed the bulk of the O 1s signal, resulting in a reliable means of correction. The possible reduction of the In in the surface region was checked by monitoring the In Auger spectra. (39) The V oxidation states were quantified by analyzing only the V 2p3/2 spin–orbit split core spectra due to the weak intensity of the V 2p1/2 spin–orbit split core spectra. Previously established V5+, V4+, and V3+ deconvolution parameters were adapted for the V 2p3/2 oxidation state quantification from previous XPS studies. (40)
HS-LEIS spectra of V/In catalysts were acquired using a Qtac100 HS-LEIS spectrometer (ION-TOF) equipped with a highly sensitive double toroidal analyzer. The equipment provides 3000-fold higher sensitivity than conventional LEIS spectrometers, allowing for quantitative static depth profiling. Samples were treated in an external reaction flow cell to negate the evaporation and wall deposition of the possibly reduced In onto the system anneal chamber. Gas flow treatments were carried out at 500 °C for 1 h at a time under a series of gas flows: 10% O2/Ar, 2.5% C3H8/2.5% CO2/Ar, 5% C3H8/Ar, and 5% CO2/Ar (50 mL min–1, Airgas). Each sample was extracted from the reaction cell after cooling under the relevant last gas flow treatment and immediately pressed, loaded into the system, and pumped down to UHV, at which point the spectra for the sample were acquired. Each spectrum was collected in a different location to negate the effect of primary and sputter ion beam damage. The HS-LEIS spectra were collected with a 3 keV He+ primary ion beam, and the catalyst was depth-profiled with a 0.5 keV Ar+ sputtering ion beam. The measurement cycle consisted of 11 measurement cycles (2.4E + 14 He+ ions cm–2 each) and 10 sputtering cycles (7.7E + 14 Ar+ ions cm–2 each), yielding a total ion dose of ∼1E + 15 ions cm–2 per complete cycle.
In situ Raman scattering for the samples under reaction conditions was collected on a multiwavelength Raman system using 532 nm laser excitation. Raman scattering was collected via a customized ellipsoidal mirror and collected by a fiber optics bundle to the spectrograph stage of a triple Raman spectroscopy system (Princeton Instruments Acton Trivista 555). The detailed methodology has been elaborated elsewhere. (34) During the acquisition, the stage translates in a raster mode, which minimizes potential laser damage to the samples. In the experiments, the sample was pretreated in 2% CO2/Ar (30 mL min–1) at 500 °C (ramp rate, 10 °C min–1) for 30 min. Spectra of pretreated samples were acquired at 120 °C. In the reaction, the pretreated catalyst was treated consecutively in CO2, C3H8/CO2, and CO2 again at 500 °C, wherein the C3H8/CO2 ratio was fixed at 1.
UV–vis DRS measurements were performed with an Agilent Cary 5000 UV–vis and Near-Infrared (NIR) spectrophotometer in the range of 200–800 nm. Polytetrafluoroethylene powder (35 μm, Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a reflectance standard. V/In catalysts were thoroughly mixed with silica at a 1:1 weight ratio to overcome the sample’s signal nonlinearity with intensity. Fumed silica (Cab-O-Sil EH-5, Cabot) was first hydrated with Milli-Q ultrapure water and then dried under 100 mL min–1 of dry air (AI D300, Airgas) for 16 h. After crushing with an agate mortar and pestle, the silica was calcined at 500 °C for 4 h in air with a flow rate of 100 mL min–1. The silica-diluted VOx/In2O3 samples were loaded into a reaction cell (Harrick Scientific HVC-DR2). Dehydration was performed at 500 °C in 10% O2/Ar (30 mL min–1) and held for 30 min, followed by cooling down to 120 °C where the dehydrated spectra were taken. The spectra were acquired with an ∼1 nm resolution and a dwell time of 15 min (scan rate of 40 nm min–1) while using a double beam mode with full slit height and a slit beam width of 2 nm. The surface VOx direct band gap was determined using the Kubelka–Munk formalism to convert the reflectance into the equivalent absorption coefficient function, F(R∞), where R∞ is the ratio of the sample reflectance to the standard reflectance. The respective edge energies of the dehydrated V5+ molecular structures were calculated from the linear fit intercept of a plot of (F(R∞)hν)2 as a function of the photon energy (hν) on the linear low-energy side of the plot (errors are usually estimated to be ∼0.11 eV (41)). The direct band gap energy is assumed to have an absolute error lower than 0.11 eV related to the inherent uncertainty in the manual fitting process. (41)

3.1. Activity Performance
As shown in Figure 1A, loading VOx onto In2O3 results in a drop in C3H8 conversion. Our recent work elucidates that such a loss can be ascribed to the suppression of PDR on the bare In2O3 surface. (34) Interestingly, V/In–S presents a higher C3H8 conversion above 500 °C than V/In, which becomes even higher than the benchmark In2O3 at 540 °C. Moreover, V/In–S shows a higher C3H6 selectivity under isoconversional conditions (Figure 1B). Such promising performance results in an increased C3H6 yield at higher temperatures (Figure 1C). For example, the propylene yield over V/In–S is increased by 17–30% from 500 to 540 °C in comparison to that of V/In at corresponding temperatures. This enhancement at higher temperatures can also be reflected in the catalyst weight-based and vanadium weight-based space-time yields in Figure S1.

Figure 2 shows the stability and regenerability of the same catalysts. In2O3 shows rapid deactivation in the first testing cycle. Although regeneration in O2 helps recover ca. 86% of its initial activity in the second cycle, it still deactivates rapidly. In comparison to In2O3 alone, V/In presents better stability and recovers ca. 80% of its highest C3H6 yield from the first cycle. For V/In–S, not only does it show a slight improvement in stability in the first cycle, but it also presents a notably improved regenerability in the second cycle, in which nearly 88% of the initial activity has been recovered. Although In2O3 exhibits a higher initial C3H6 yield, its C3H6 yield becomes lower than that of V/In–S after ca. 1.5 h on stream for both cycles and finally drops to only ca. 38–40% of that of V/In–S after ca. 12 h on stream for both cycles. The apparent activation energy was estimated by applying the temperature-dependent activity performance to Arrhenius plots and averaged based on three separate tests. V/In and V/In–S show similar values (87.6 and 90.7 kJ mol–1, respectively), indicating a similar reaction pathway. In sum, the Schlenk-line-prepared V/In–S outperforms V/In (prepared by a regular impregnation) in terms of activity, stability, and regenerability.

3.2. Catalyst Structure and Surface Chemistry
To elucidate the source of the improved activity, stability, and regenerability of V/In–S, the catalyst structure, especially the VOx structure and its interaction with In2O3, was characterized. Figure 3A shows the Raman spectra of dehydrated V/In and V/In–S. The scattering features, centered at 305 and 360 cm–1, correspond to the δ(InO6) bending vibration of octahedrons of bcc-In2O3 and the ν(In–O–In) stretching vibration, respectively. (42−46) A scattering feature at 1025 cm–1 for both catalysts is indicative of dispersed vanadate species. (34,36) No sign of crystallite V2O5 is evident. The peak at ca. 881 cm–1 is attributed to the In–O–V structure. (1,34,36) UV–vis DRS results shed additional light on the surface structures of these VOx species. By applying the abscissa intercept of the photon energy in the low-energy side of the in situ UV–vis DRS-derived Tauc plots, we calculated the edge energies of the ligand-to-metal-charge-transfer transitions of the dehydrated V5+ molecular structures. (34,41) As shown in Figure 3B, the estimated band gaps (Eg) of V/In and V/In–S are 2.95 and 3.33 eV, respectively, indicating a higher prevalence of monovanadate species on the surface of the V/In–S catalyst than on V/In. By comparing these values to previous edge energy calibrations for progressively polymerized VOx structures, (47) it is possible to conclude that the V/In–S catalyst possesses an approximate ∼1/1 ratio of monomeric to polymeric VOx species on the surface, while the VOx species on the V/In catalyst are fully polymerized.
Figure 3

Figure 4A shows H2-TPR profiles of the same catalysts. For benchmark In2O3, it shows a weak reduction peak at ca. 161 °C, which corresponds to In2O3 species with smaller particle sizes; reduction of bulk In2O3 starts beyond 500 °C, and the highest reduction peak emerges at 751 °C. The peak of reducible In2O3 species with smaller particle sizes shifts to ca. 218 °C for V/In. (27,28,48,49) Such a shift toward higher temperatures indicates that In2O3 species have intimate interactions with VOx species. The subpeak at ca. 350 °C can be attributed to the reduction of VOx species that have close interactions with In2O3 with smaller particle sizes. (34) For V/In–S, the peak of those In2O3 with smaller particle sizes shifts slightly to a higher temperature at 226 °C. As shown in Table 1, the quantified reducible In2O3 and VOx species of V/In–S decrease notably in comparison to those of V/In. These observations demonstrate the changes in VOx distribution and interactions with In2O3. UV–vis DRS results indicate the presence of monovanadate for V/In–S in addition to polyvanadate which dominates in V/In (Figure 3). The monovanadate binds strongly with In2O3, which further retards the reduction of indium oxide. (35) Notably, the peak for VOx reduction, centered at 350 °C, barely shifts but presents a lower H2 consumption over the V/In–S catalyst than over V/In (Table 1). Likely, this peak corresponds to the reduction of polyvanadate, while the reduction of isolated monovanadate might be superimposed with the peak of bulky In2O3 reduction at higher temperatures (Figure 4A). The above observations indicate that the interaction between VOx and In2O3 is strengthened in the case of V/In–S with more monovanadates. Incorporating VOx also shifts the maximum reduction peak of bulky In2O3 to higher temperatures, indicating the role of VOx in retarding the deep reduction of In2O3 at higher temperatures. (34) This implies a potential role of VOx in resisting deep In2O3 reduction and thus improving the stability under ODHP reaction conditions.

Figure 4B shows CO2-TPD profiles. In comparison to In2O3, the presence of VOx in V/In considerably suppresses CO2 adsorption, which can be evidenced by the decreased CO2 desorption peak and the reduced CO2 uptake (Table 1). Such an impact becomes more distinct for V/In–S, which can be attributed to the presence of more monomeric VOx with a higher coverage (per vanadium base, two monomeric VOx occupy more In2O3 surface area than a dimeric VOx) and a stronger interaction with In2O3. Figure 4C presents NH3-TPD profiles. The peak at ca. 170–186 °C corresponds to Lewis acid sites (vanadyl groups, V═O), while the bump at ca. 350 °C can be attributed to Brønsted acid sites (hydroxyl groups, −OH). (34) The profiles of these two catalysts are similar, except that the peak of Brønsted acid sites becomes weaker for V/In–S. Likely, anchoring more isolated monomeric VOx consumes additional hydroxyl groups, resulting in the reduction in Brønsted acid sites. This is also reflected in the slightly decreased amount of acid sites (Table 1).
In situ Raman experiments were conducted to study the catalyst structures under reaction conditions. Figure 5A,B shows the resulting spectra of respective V/In and V/In–S collected under consecutive treatments in CO2, C3H8/CO2, and CO2. Hess et al. have reported that there exists a significant change of the In oxidation state at the surface at higher temperatures, which stimulates the self-diffusion of oxygen from the bulk to the surface and generates oxygen vacancies in the bulk as a result. (42) This is quantitatively verifiable by normalizing the peak area of 360 cm–1 (I2) to that of 305 cm–1 (I1). (45,46) Our recent work proved such a unique phenomenon and further elucidated that the presence of VOx helped resist the deep reduction of In2O3 under reaction conditions, giving rise to improved stability. (34) Such a feature is still present in the case of V/In–S, as evidenced by a higher I2/I1 ratio of V/In–S than that of In2O3 under consecutive treatments (Figure 5C). Notably, the decay and reappearance of VOx species (1025 cm–1, I3) occur on both catalysts in C3H8/CO2 and CO2, respectively, whereas the peaks of V/In–S seem more distinct (Figure 5A,B). To substantiate this trend, the peak area of VOx was normalized by a similar method, namely, I3/I1. As shown in Figure 5C, for both catalysts, a decrease is evidenced in C3H8/CO2, followed by an increase in CO2 again. This signifies the redox cycle of VOx under reaction conditions and the role of CO2 in reoxidizing VOx to complete the redox cycle. This is consistent with our previous work. (34) Differently, V/In–S exhibits a relatively higher I3/I1 ratio than V/In in a C3H8/CO2 atmosphere, as well as in the following CO2 regeneration step. In our recent work, in situ NAP-XPS results show depleted V species from the surface, which might migrate to the bulk of In2O3 and form InVO4 under reducing conditions such as in the presence of C3H8 at high temperatures. (34) In conjunction with the general trends of I3/I1 ratios of both V/In and V/In–S (Figure 5C) in consecutive treatments, they likely originate from the partial conversion of polyvanadate into InVO4 under reducing conditions. Furthermore, V/In exhibits a more significant variation in I3/I1 ratios through treatments than V/In–S, which can be associated with its more polyvanadate than monovanadate in comparison to V/In–S.

In situ Raman spectra of V/In (A) and V/In–S (B) under consecutive treatments in CO2 → C3H8/CO2 → CO2 with 10 min for each at 500 °C, along with the quantified I2/I1 and I3/I1 ratios (C) as a function of TOS based on Figure 4A,B. I1: area of the peak at 305 cm–1, I2: area of the peak at 360 cm–1, and I3: area of the peak at 1025 cm–1. The spectra of In2O3 are shown in Figure S3.
In situ NAP-XPS experiments were conducted to provide insight into the changes in oxidation states of both catalysts under reaction conditions, and similar consecutive treatments of O2, CO2, C3H8/CO2, and CO2 were applied. The In 3d NAP-XPS spectra are not affected by the different conditions, nor are the more sensitive In MNN Auger spectra (Figures S4 and S5, respectively). This is in line with the reported “oxygen and vacancy diffusion” of bulk In2O3 at elevated temperatures (42) and our recent findings. (34) A redox cycle between V4+ ↔ V5+ is evident in the V 2p3/2 spectra of both catalysts by switching from C3H8/CO2 to CO2 postreduction (Figure 6A–D), implicating the contribution of the MvK mechanism in the DHP. (1) Furthermore, a further decrease in the V 2p3/2 area due to the In2O3 bulk incorporation of redox-generated V3+ in the V/In–S catalyst relative to the V/In catalyst (∼70 vs ∼50%) provides additional evidence for the effect of the synthesis technique on the VOx sites’ redox properties. Quantification analysis indicates that a higher fraction of V is present as V4+ species on V/In–S compared to V/In under reaction conditions; meanwhile, these surface V4+ species are more readily reoxidized by the soft oxidant CO2 (Figure 6E). These observations agree with the quantitative analysis of in situ Raman spectra (Figure 5C).

Changes in the V4+ proportion of both catalysts by switching from C3H8/CO2 to CO2 after the reaction through quantification analysis (E). To confirm the proportion of V4+ in V/In–S, a V 2p3/2 NAP-XPS spectrum was also acquired in a different spot. As shown in Figure 6D, the quantified V4+ proportion is ca. 13 at.%.
In our recent work, by studying the coordination environment via X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we suggested the migration of V into In2O3 below the surface under CO2-ODHP reaction conditions, leading to the breaking of In–O–V bonds and the formation of the V–(V/In) bond with a high coordination number. (34) This is the case for V/In with fully polymerized vanadate. To further study such a vanadium migration in the outmost atomic layer and its relationship with monovanadate and polyvanadate, catalysts were characterized by HS-LEIS after consecutive treatments of O2, C3H8/CO2, C3H8, and CO2. Figure 7A presents the relative-selective-factor (RSF)-normalized V/In atomic ratios and O/metal ratios, as measured by 3 keV He+ ion beams versus increasing ion fluence for V/In and V/In–S. The V concentration of V/In in the topmost layer (first date point) decreases in C3H8/CO2 relative to the O2-annealed one and decreases even further in C3H8 alone. Annealing in CO2 increases the V concentration. In conjunction with the fading away and reappearance of the InVOx species (e.g., ∼881 cm–1) under a similar sequence of treatments from in situ Raman results (Figure 5A), it is suggested that these V species migrate into the bulk of In2O3 to form a solid solution (InVOx) under reaction conditions. This is in line with our recent work, in which the replacement of In3+ with V3+ in the bulk of In2O3 is supported by in situ XAS results. (34) A similar trend in V concentration is evident on V/In–S by undergoing the same consecutive treatments (Figure 7B); however, differences are distinct in the ranges of V/In ratios under different conditions. The V concentration of V/In–S under O2 annealing is significantly higher than that of V/In, signifying that more VOx species of V/In have already formed InVOx species prior to the reaction than that of V/In under the same condition. The V concentration of V/In–S stays at approximately the same value as V/In by switching from C3H8/CO2 to C3H8 without a further decrease. This signifies a relatively more stable topmost layer of V/In–S with more monovanadate than that of V/In. Once exposed to CO2, the V concentration of V/In–S is clearly higher than that of V/In, indicating that V/In–S is more readily oxidized than V/In. In other words, the VOx species in V/In–S shows improved redox activity than those in V/In under similar CO2-ODHP reaction conditions. Provided by the similar V density on In2O3, these positive impacts, again, can be associated with the increased proportion of monovanadate and its strengthened interaction with In2O3.

3.3. Discussion
Our recent work elucidated the crucial roles of polymeric surface VOx in suppressing PDR on basic In2O3 and in utilizing CO2 as a soft oxidant to complete the redox cycle of VOx for ODHP. (34) Compared to polymeric species, the increased proportion of monomeric VOx species, introduced by the moisture-free Schlenk-line method, consolidates these benefits and is responsible for the further improvement in catalytic performance and stability. In particular, these monomeric species allow for strengthened interactions with In2O3, which are conducive to preserving a relatively stable chemical environment of In2O3 on the surface and in the subsurface. Meanwhile, the presence of more monovanadate features improved the redox activity. Therefore, these physical properties explain the relation between the surface VOx molecular structure to the catalytic performance, stability, and regenerability in VOx/In2O3 catalysts for CO2-ODHP.
In Figure 1, In2O3 shows a higher C3H8 conversion than V/In–S till 500 °C, beyond which V/In–S outperforms In2O3 at 540 °C. Meanwhile, due to the high C3H6 selectivity of V/In–S under isoconversional conditions, the C3H6 yield of V/In–S starts to surpass In2O3 at ca. 480 °C and ultimately is significantly higher (ca. 60%) than that of In2O3. Such an observation might indicate a shift in reaction pathways. Our recent effort reveals that the deep reduction of bulk In2O3 occurs at 500 °C, which can be associated with the rapid deactivation of In2O3 in CO2-ODHP. (3) Furthermore, the partially reduced In2O3 surface tends to favor PDR to CO and H2 over CO2-ODHP to C3H6, especially at higher temperatures. By contrast, the presence of VOx in the form of In–O–V structure helps resist the deep reduction of In2O3 and suppresses PDR, leading to improved C3H6 selectivity and stability. (3) The roles of VOx in governing the reaction pathways should still be valid in the present work. In addition, our new finding is that the presence of more monovanadate species facilitates the redox activity of VOx and stabilizes the surface and subsurface of In2O3, which, in conjunction with In2O3 itself, is conducive to the C3H8 dehydrogenation through the combined MvK mechanism (on VOx and/or InOx) and heterolytic dissociation mechanism (In2O3). (3) Therefore, the higher catalytic performance of V/In–S at higher temperatures is expected.
Notably, both VOx/In2O3 and In2O3 alone are not fully regenerated after O2 treatment (Figure 2). Likely, the structural dynamics of reducible In2O3 bulk as a result of the temperature-sensitive oxygen self-diffusion process is one of the reasons, through which the creation of oxygen defects in sublayers and bulk continues even under oxygen treatment. (42) Our recent work also indicates the potential reduction of In2O3 under CO2-ODHP conditions. (21) Therefore, we postulate that the observed partial regeneration of In2O3-based catalysts is associated with the dynamic oxygen self-diffusion process and the deep reduction of In2O3 under CO2-ODHP conditions. To further improve the regenerability and stability, introducing a support to disperse In2O3 while maintaining or even strengthening the interaction between In2O3 and monovanadate might provide an avenue.
4. Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In this work, we continued to explore the effect of combining basic In2O3 and redox-active VOx for the CO2-ODHP reaction, focusing on identifying the role of monovanadate and polyvanadate surface species in the catalytic activity, stability, and regenerability through comparative studies. Raman spectra confirm the presence of mono- and polyvanadate species, and UV–vis DRS spectra confirm that, compared to the regular impregnation-prepared V/In with fully polymerized vanadate, the Schlenk-line-prepared V/In–S catalyst presents a significantly increased proportion of monovanadate under a similar surface V density. V/In–S not only exhibits a 17–30% enhanced C3H6 yield at relatively high temperatures (500–540 °C) compared to V/In but it also presents improved stability and regenerability with nearly 88% of the activity recovered, 10% higher than the regenerability on V/In. Chemisorption results implicate that the monovanadate species interact more strongly with In2O3 and further neutralize the basic sites on In2O3. Spectroscopic studies (e.g., Raman, NAP-XPS, and HS-LEIS) reveal a monovanadate-induced stabilization of the V/In surface and subsurface, and improved redox property of VOx with CO2 as a soft oxidant, which is linked with the observed enhancement in activity and stability. These findings shed light on designing efficient, robust metal-oxide catalysts for CO2-ODHP by tuning the interplay between acid–base interactions and redox properties by manipulating the molecular structure of surface vanadia.

Abstract
Figure 1
Figure 1. Changes in C3H8 conversion (A), C3H6 selectivity under isoconversion conditions (B), and C3H6 yield (C) as a function of temperature for the VOx/In2O3 catalysts and bare In2O3. Reaction conditions of CO2-ODHP: 350–540 °C, C3H8/CO2 = 1, and GHSV = 18000 mL g–1 h–1.
Figure 2
Figure 2. Stability and regenerability of VOx/In2O3 catalysts and In2O3 for CO2-ODHP. Reaction conditions: 500 °C, C3H8/CO2 = 1, GHSV = 18,000 mL g–1 h–1. Regeneration conditions: 500 °C, 5% O2/He, 30 mL min–1, 2 h.
Figure 3
Figure 3. Raman spectra (A) and intercept of a plot of (F(R∞)hν)2 as a function of the photon energy (hν) on the linear low-energy side of the plot (B) of dehydrated VOx/In2O3 catalysts. Original UV–vis DRS spectra are shown in Figure S2 in the Supporting Information.
Figure 4
Figure 4. Profiles of H2-TPR (A), CO2-TPD (B), and NH3-TPD (C) of In2O3 and VOx/In2O3 catalysts.
Figure 5
Figure 5. In situ Raman spectra of V/In (A) and V/In–S (B) under consecutive treatments in CO2 → C3H8/CO2 → CO2 with 10 min for each at 500 °C, along with the quantified I2/I1 and I3/I1 ratios (C) as a function of TOS based on Figure 4A,B. I1: area of the peak at 305 cm–1, I2: area of the peak at 360 cm–1, and I3: area of the peak at 1025 cm–1. The spectra of In2O3 are shown in Figure S3.
Figure 6
Figure 6. In situ V 2p3/2 NAP-XPS spectra of V/In (A) and V/In–S (B) under consecutive treatments in O2, CO2, C3H8/CO2, and CO2 after the reaction at 500 °C. NAP-XPS spectra in the region of V 2p3/2 for V/In and V/In–S under C3H8/CO2 (C) and for V/In–S in two different spots under C3H8/CO2 (D) at 500 °C. Changes in the V4+ proportion of both catalysts by switching from C3H8/CO2 to CO2 after the reaction through quantification analysis (E). To confirm the proportion of V4+ in V/In–S, a V 2p3/2 NAP-XPS spectrum was also acquired in a different spot. As shown in Figure 6D, the quantified V4+ proportion is ca. 13 at.%.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
