The roles of CeyZr1−yO2 in propane dehydrogenation: Enhancing catalytic stability and decreasing coke combustion temperature
Abstract
The influence of CeyZr1−yO2 content (0 < y < 1) in Pt-Sn/xCeZr-Al catalysts, where x was the weight percentage of (Ce + Zr) and calculated as [mass of (Ce + Zr)] × 100/[mass of (Ce + Zr + Al2O3)], on stability and regeneration temperature in propane dehydrogenation was studied using a fixed-bed reactor at 600 °C and 1 bar of pressure. The XRD data revealed that CeyZr1−yO2 phases were formed over xCeZr-Al (x ≠ 0) supports and the concentration of Zr4+ ions in these phases increased when the CeyZr1−yO2 content was increased. The band of oxygen vacancies characterized by Raman spectra at ca. 620–645 cm−1 was strongly dependent on catalyst processing; introduction of metal (Pt, Sn) and/or re-calcination created more oxygen vacancies in the catalysts. The XRD patterns and XPS data of the reduced Pt-Sn/xCeZr-Al catalysts did not indicate the formation of Pt-Sn alloys. The XPS and CO-IR spectra demonstrated that Pt became more electron deficient with increasing CeyZr1−yO2 content. The higher catalytic stability and lower coke combustion temperature (regeneration temperature) were obtained with a higher CeyZr1−yO2 content in Pt-Sn/xCeZr-Al catalysts.

1. Introduction
The primary method for propylene production in the petrochemical industry is through naphtha cracking, wherein ethylene is co-produced. The worldwide demand for propylene is growing faster than that for ethylene, which causes a shortage of propylene if supplied from steam cracking. Propane dehydrogenation has been considered to address the propylene shortage.
The addition of tin to Pt/support catalyst systems has been widely studied in the dehydrogenation of paraffins and has a positive effect on the stability and selectivity for olefins. However, the stability of Pt-Sn supported catalysts is still unsatisfactory. Tin is thought to promote the mobility of coke precursors from the metal to the support, although it is not apparent how this is accomplished. Tin does not diminish the amount of coke, rather it does the opposite; however, the carbon formed is less likely to decrease the activity because much of it is located on the support [1].
Alkali metals (Li, K, Na), rare earth metals (La, Ce), zinc and magnesium have been used as promoters to improve the stability of the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Various commercial catalysts have been developed for propane dehydrogenation: chromia-alumina (ABB Lummus Global), Pt/alumina with alkali, Cu and Zn used as promoters (UOP LLC), as well as Pt/zinc aluminate with Sn used as a promoter (Phillips Petroleum) [9]. Although numerous attempts have been made to modify supported Pt catalysts, deactivation due to coking has not yet been completely eliminated, and catalysts must undergo continuous or frequent regeneration processes to restore catalytic activity.
Coke can be removed by gasification with O2, H2O, CO2, and H2. The temperature required to gasify these deposits at a reasonable rate varies with the type of gas, the structure and reactivity of the coke and the activity of the catalyst. Walker and co-workers reported the following order for rates of uncatalyzed gasification: O2 > H2O > CO2 > H2 [10]. Since the catalyzed removal of carbon with oxygen is generally very rapid at moderate temperatures, industrial processes typically regenerate coke-deactivated Pt-based catalysts with a gas containing oxygen, followed by a redispersion step with a chlorine-containing gas [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. One of the key problems in air regeneration is avoiding hot spots or excessive temperatures that could further deactivate the catalyst via sintering of the active phase or cause damage to reaction equipment, which ultimately results in unsafe operating conditions [16].
In previous work [17], [18], [19], we found that the Pt-Sn/CeO2-Al2O3 catalyst exhibits better catalytic stability, a lower amount of coke and a decreased loss of Pt dispersion when compared to Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalysts in one 160-min reaction cycle. Additionally, a support with a higher oxygen mobility results in a lower coke oxidation temperature during regeneration of the spent catalysts. In particular, the Pt/CeyZr1−yO2 catalyst displays the lowest coke oxidation temperature, but this catalyst has a much lower catalytic activity than that of Pt/Al2O3. Taking this scenario into account, the focus herein rests on the possible combination of CeO2 and CeyZr1−yO2 into one catalyst in order to enhance both the catalytic stability and maintain a low coke oxidation temperature (regeneration temperature). To this end, Pt-Sn/xCeZr-Al catalysts were synthesized with varying Ce and Zr content. The influence of CeyZr1−yO2 content on catalytic performance and the coke oxidation temperatures of the degraded catalysts were studied after several regeneration cycles.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
The CeZr-Al supports were synthesized by impregnating γ-Al2O3 powder, which was synthesized as described in a previous study [17], with an aqueous excess solution of Ce and Zr precursors. A modified procedure from [20] is described as follows: Ce(NO3)3.6H2O (Sigma–Aldrich, ≥99%) and ZrO(NO3)3.6H2O (Sigma–Aldrich, 99%) salts were dissolved by applying sonication in each beaker containing 25 ml of distilled water and then combined into one beaker. The combined solution was then added to a beaker containing 5 g of alumina, stirred at 30 °C for 1 h and left to stand at 30 °C for 12 h. The solution was heated slowly to and kept at 50 °C with constant stirring to evaporate the water. After that, the paste samples were dried at 100 °C for 12 h in an oven and then ground with a mortar and pestle. The ground powders were calcined in a furnace from 30 °C to 600 °C with a ramp of 1.5 °C/min and maintained at 600 °C for 6 h.
The 2.0 wt.% of each metal (Pt and Sn) that was loaded onto supports was prepared by an incipient wetness impregnation technique. H2PtCl6.6H2O (Sigma–Aldrich, ≥37.5% Pt basis) and SnCl2·2H2O (Sigma–Aldrich, ≥98%) precursors were dissolved in a predetermined amount of deionized water. One aliquot containing a 200 μl precursor was evenly dispersed on the calcined supports. This procedure was repeated until the ratio of liquid to support was 1.0 ml/g. Catalysts were dried at room temperature for 24 h and then at 100 °C for 12 h in an oven and calcined at 550 °C for 6 h in a furnace. The catalysts were labeled as Pt-Sn/xCeZr-Al in which CeZr and Al is CeyZr1−yO2 and Al2O3 respectively; x is the weight percentage of (Ce + Zr) and calculated as [mass of (Ce + Zr)] × 100/[mass of (Ce + Zr + Al2O3)]. In all catalysts the atomic ratio of Ce to Zr was equal to 1.7.
2.2. Characterization
The surface areas and pore size distributions of the catalysts were characterized by a nitrogen sorption technique (Micromeritics ASAP 2020, USA). The samples were degassed under a vacuum at 300 °C for 4 h prior to automatic analyzer analysis at −196.15 °C. The coke content was determined by a thermogravimetric analyzer (TA Instruments Q50, USA). Approximately 10 mg spent catalyst was charged into the sample pan and heated to 800 °C at a rate of 20 °C/min under continuous airflow.
The XRD patterns were obtained on a Rigaku D/MAX-2200 powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Corporation, Japan) using a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.15418 nm). The X-ray tube was operated at 35 kV, 20 mA; the two theta angle was scanned from 10° to 100° (stepwise, 0.02°) at a speed of 2°/min. The Raman spectra were obtained with a DXR Raman Microscope (Thermo Scientific, USA) using a 532 nm excitation source. The spectral resolution employed was 2 cm−1. The infrared spectra of CO adsorption were recorded with an FT-IR spectrometer (MIDAC 2100). Reduced catalyst (0.07 g) was pressed into a self-supporting, 17-mm-diameter disc, placed in the IR cell with CaF2 windows and then exposed to 14.6 Torr of CO at room temperature for 5 min. The IR spectra of adsorbed CO were recorded after the removal of gaseous CO from the cell by evacuation. An XPS study of fresh and spent catalysts was conducted using a Thermo VG Scientific ESCALAB-250 instrument (USA) with an excitation source of AlKα radiation. In addition to a binding energy scan range of 0–1200 eV for the identification of all detectable elements, detailed scans were obtained for chemical state identification and quantification.
2.3. Reaction test
Propane dehydrogenation was performed in a fixed-bed reactor (quartz; internal and external diameter is 4 and 6 mm, respectively; height of reactor is 250 mm) at 1 bar and 600 °C. The catalyst (150 mg) was reduced in situ in pure H2 (50 ml/min) at 600 °C for 3 h and then purged by N2 (100 ml/min) for 10 min to remove the remaining H2. Then, the reaction mixture consisting of N2 (50 ml/min) and C3H8 (15 ml/min) was fed into the reactor. The product was sampled through a six-port valve via a sample loop (0.25 ml) into a gas chromatograph (YOUNG LIN-Acme 6000 GC, South Korea) equipped with an FID detector and a 30 m × 0.53 mm HP-PLOT Al2O3 “KCl” capillary column. The catalysts were regenerated with a flow of pure air (20 ml/min) at various temperatures (depending on the catalyst) for 30 min and then re-reduced in pure H2 (50 ml/min) at 600 °C for 3 h.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Catalyst characterization
Table 1 lists the properties of the materials prepared for this study. An increase in the CeyZr1−yO2 content resulted in a loss of surface area, pore volume and a decrease in the average pore size of the catalyst. These observations indicates that the introduction of CeyZr1−yO2 into Al2O3 may cause pore blockage, surface coverage of Al2O3 by CeyZr1−yO2 oxides or that a CeyZr1−yO2 phase formed in which the surface area is lower than that of Al2O3.Fig. 1A shows XRD patterns of xCeZr-Al supports; the XRD pattern of pure CeO2 was stacked for comparison purpose. As the CeyZr1−yO2 content in the support increased, the position of the peak for the CeyZr1−yO2 phase shifted to a higher two theta value, suggesting a decrease in the lattice constant caused by the incorporation of smaller Zr4+ ions into the CeO2 lattice. There are three stable phases (monoclinic (m), tetragonal (t), cubic (c)) and various metastable phases of CeyZr1−yO2 that can be formed in the CeO2-ZrO2 binary system under the current composition and preparation conditions [21], [22], [23], [24]. At a ZrO2 concentration higher than 95%, the equilibrium is 100% monoclinic phase, and at a high ceria concentration (CeyZr1−yO2 with y > 0.85), the stable phase is the cubic fluorite structure. In the intermediate region (0.1 < y < 0.85), two tetragonal phases, t′ and t″, exist, which are structurally different from each other. The t′′ phase is often grouped with the cubic phase c and they are assigned to the c′ phase because both the t″ and c phases cannot be distinguished from each other based on XRD patterns [25]. However, the t″ phase can be distinguished from the c phase through Raman spectroscopy. The supports obtained in this study are in the intermediate region (nominal value of y = 0.63), so one can expect both the t′ and t″ phases to exist. Nevertheless, the (4 0 0) and (0 0 4) peaks of CeyZr1−yO2 in all supports were not separate, so the CeyZr1−yO2 phase that formed over all supports was readily attributable to the c′ phase.The Raman spectra of the supports calcined at 600 °C are shown in Fig. 2A. Raman spectra of pure ceria and prepared supports show one intensive peak at 460 cm−1. This peak is due to the T2g Raman active mode of a cubic fluorite structure, indicating the cubic c phase was present in every sample except for the pure ZrO2 sample because the small band at 310 cm−1 representing the t″ phase was absent [21], [26]. A shoulder peak at ca. 610 cm−1, assigned to the structural changes in the cubic fluorite structure of ceria after incorporation of zirconium into its lattice, was visible upon magnification, but of weak intensity in the Raman spectra of xCeZr-Al supports. This is reasonable because the estimated atomic composition of Zr in CeyZr1−yO2 is small and ranges from 10 to 20% as will be discussed later.The chemical composition of the mixed CeyZr1−yO2 oxide in all supports was estimated with a calibration curve (Fig. 1B) generated by plotting the two theta values of the (1 1 1) peaks as a function of the atomic concentrations of cerium using the JCPDS database [26]. The estimated value of y was in the range of 0.8–0.9 as summarized in Table 2. These estimated values of y were higher than those of y in the synthetic composition (y = 0.63), indicating the CeyZr1−yO2 oxides that formed in all supports were rich in cerium. This result implies that a portion of the Zr was not detected by the XRD technique and must have been present in an amorphous or a highly dispersed phase on the surface of γ-Al2O3 as suggested by other researchers [27], [28], [29].

The platinum and tin were loaded onto the xCeZr-Al supports by co-impregnation using an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 and SnCl2 precursors at room temperature. The samples were characterized by Raman spectroscopy after drying at room temperature for 12 h, and the Raman spectra of these samples and of the Pt-Sn complex are shown in Fig. 2B. One new band at 330 cm−1 was attributable to vibration of Pt-Cl and Sn-Cl species as the position of this band is coincident with the vibration band of the Pt-Sn complex. The bands at 336 and 313 cm−1, which can be assigned to the SnCl and PtCl bonds, respectively [30], were consistent with our observations. Notably, the band at 620 cm−1 was more clearly visible when compared with the Raman spectra of the supports. In other words, the relative intensity of this band increased markedly after Pt and Sn precursors were introduced into the supports without calcination. The presence of this peak is normally attributed to defects and oxygen displacements that distort the cubic structure, breaking the cubic symmetry and selection rules of the cubic space groups [31]. We believe that the Pt-Sn complex interacted with the supports and brought about the increased the intensity of this peak. The interaction between the Pt-Sn complex is also thought to have perturbed the local CeO symmetry, and more Raman modes are usually allowed as the crystal symmetry decreases.
The Raman spectra of the calcined Pt-Sn/xCeZr-Al catalysts at 600 °C are shown in Fig. 2C. The difference between the Raman spectra of the calcined catalysts and those of the dried-at-room-temperature catalysts is the relative intensity of the band at 654 cm−1 compared with the CeO band at 460 cm−1. After calcination, the intensity of the band representing defects increased markedly and was comparable to that of the band for the dried-at-room-temperature catalysts. This implies that calcination enhanced the oxygen vacancies that originated from the formation of charge-compensating oxygen vacancies neighboring the dopant, which can be observed in extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) experiments [32], [33].
The XRD patterns of the calcined Pt-Sn/xCeZr-Al catalysts are presented in Fig. 1C. The Pt metal phase (PDF No.: 00-004-0802) can be identified by the characteristic peak at 2θ = 39.8° in all calcined catalysts. This observation was consistent with a previous report wherein the Pt precursor (H2PtCl6·6H2O) decomposed into Pt metal and other products at temperatures greater than 510 °C (in He or air flow) [34]. The calcination temperature (600 °C) in the present experiment was sufficiently high to form the metallic Pt phase. Of course, a certain portion of amorphous PtOx phases that could not be detected by XRD should not be ruled out. The XRD patterns of the reduced Pt-Sn/xCeZr-Al catalysts shown in Fig. 1D do not point to any difference compared to the calcined Pt-Sn/xCeZr-Al catalysts. In other words, the reduction did not result in the formation of any Pt-Sn alloys or metallic Sn, and this was verified by XPS measurements as we will discuss later in this article. This observation is in stark contrast to previous studies that showed two types of alloys, PtSn and Pt3Sn, are formed on various supports after reduction when 3.0 wt.% of each metal is used [19], [35].
To understand the chemical state of tin, the XPS spectra of the Sn 3d5/2 level of the reduced Pt-Sn/xCeZr-Al catalysts were measured and are shown in Fig. 3. The Sn 3d5/2 spectra of all catalysts showed a broad peak located around 486.5–487 eV that would correspond to oxidized Sn species. According to the literature, the line corresponding to Sn 3d5/2 for SnO2 has a binding energy ca. 486.5–487.0 eV, while that for SnO has a binding energy ca. 486.0–487.0 eV [36]. The Sn 3d5/2 binding energy of metallic Sn is in the range of 483.5–485.5 eV, depending on whether or not it is in its unalloyed or Pt-alloyed form [35], [37], [38].

Fig. 3. XPS spectra of the Sn 3d5/2 level of reduced Pt-Sn/xCeZr-Al catalysts.
The broad peak in the Sn 3d5/2 spectra of the reduced catalysts shown in Fig. 3 can be assigned to supported Sn2+/Sn4+ oxides. The contribution of the metallic state to the overall state of tin is uncertain since its binding energy is close to the peak threshold. However, most of the tin is in the oxidized state, and the possible presence of a small amount of zero-valent tin should not be excluded. Importantly, the binding energy of Sn 3d5/2 decreased (Table 3) as the CeyZr1−yO2 content increased. Cerium is known to modify the SnOx-alumina interaction, stabilize the oxidized tin species and inhibit the reduction of SnOx species [2], [39]. The surface enrichment of tin (Table 3) with an increase in CeyZr1−yO2 content promotes the Pt-SnOx interaction; moreover, the Sn0/Sn2+ ratio increases with increasing zirconium oxide content [40]. Therefore, the nature of this shift in the Sn 3d5/2 binding energy is likely to be related to the Pt-SnOx interaction and to the role of zirconium oxide.

IR spectroscopy of the CO molecules adsorbed to metallic surfaces of the reduced catalysts was utilized to understand the nature of the Pt sites. This technique is a qualitative probe of surface structure because of the sensitivity of CO frequency to the structure of the metal atoms to which it is coordinated [41]. According to the literature, the bands in the higher-frequency region (2100–1950 cm−1) and in the lower-frequency region (1900–1700 cm−1) may be related to CO linearly bonded to one Pt and CO bonded to the surface of two Pt atoms (bridged species), respectively [42], [43], [44], [45].
The normalized IR spectra in the 2100–1950 cm−1 region for CO adsorbed on the supported Pt-Sn catalysts previously reduced at 600 °C are shown in Fig. 4. The Pt-CO spectrum of the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 exhibited at least three types of surface sites of Pt for the linear adsorption of CO at 2082, 2064, and 2040 cm−1. The bands at 2082 and 2064 cm−1 are attributed to CO bound to highly coordinated Pt sites such as {1 1 1} and {1 0 0} terraces, respectively, whereas the band at 2040 cm−1 is due to CO bound to highly uncoordinated Pt sites at step-edges, corners, and defects [46]. The area ratio of the peak of the highly uncoordinated to highly coordinated Pt sites decreased with increasing the CeyZr1−yO2 content from x = 0 to x = 16, indicating that the highly uncoordinated Pt sites were inhibited by increase in the CeyZr1−yO2 content. Moreover, at x = 25 and 35, the band at 2040 cm−1 almost disappeared and the band at 2082 cm−1 became dominant. It has been suggested that Pt sites on terraces are active for CH and HH bond breaking (dehydrogenation), whereas Pt sites on steps, edges, and corners are highly active for CC bond scission (cracking, hydrogenolysis) [47], [48]. Therefore, the addition of CeyZr1−yO2 to Al2O3 made Pt-Sn supported catalysts better in terms of propylene selectivity and catalytic stability since side reactions such as catalytic cracking and hydrogenolysis were inhibited, as discussed below.

The reaction test was performed on each catalyst with a time-on-stream of 240 min. The propane conversion and propene selectivity vs. time-on-stream are illustrated in Fig. 5. To compare the catalytic stability among Pt-Sn/xCeZr-Al catalysts, a deactivation parameter was defined as D = (X0 − Xf) × 100/X0, where X0 and Xf are the initial and final propane conversion, respectively. Based on this calculation, the order of D decreased as follows: 81.6 (x = 0) > 75.9 (x = 4) > 67.9 (x = 35) > 66.4 (x = 8) > 63.8 (x = 16) > 60.5 (x = 25). The decrease in D value indicates that the addition of CeyZr1−yO2 to the Al2O3 support results in catalysts with much stronger tolerance toward catalytic deactivation than the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst. The highest stability was obtained with a CeZr content of 25; a higher CeyZr1−yO2 content than this led to a slight decrease in catalytic stability.

In Fig. 5, a little lower propene selectivity was obtained as propane conversion decreased. This can be explained that the sites for main reaction were poisoned more quickly than that for side reactions. Coke formed is apt to cover terraces (coke formation requires large Pt assembles); this leads to decrease in numbers of Pt sites for propane dehydrogenation (structure insensitive reaction). On the contrary, hydrogenolysis and cracking reactions (structure sensitive reactions) that occur on small Pt ensembles (kinks and steps) still clean from coke coverage.
Fig. 6A presents the TGA profiles of coke oxidation over each spent catalyst. The coke amounts and oxidation temperatures corresponding to the peaks in the TGA profiles are listed in Table 4. The oxidation temperatures of coke decreased progressively with increasing CeyZr1−yO2 content. Among the catalysts, the reactivity of coke oxidation over Pt-Sn/35CeZr-Al was the best because it permitted the lowest oxidation temperature. The intrinsic oxidation reactivity of coke is only dependent on its structure. In previous reports, 13CCP/MAS NMR, XRD and TPO techniques were used to demonstrate that the coke structure was independent of the nature of supports in propane dehydrogenation over-supported Pt catalysts at 600 °C [17], [49]. In this study, as confirmed by the Raman spectra shown in Fig. 6B, the nature of the coke was similar amongst the catalysts since the position of the D and G bands and the ratio of D to G bands for the spent catalysts were similar. The G mode is actually the stretching vibration of any pair of sp2 sites, whether in the CC chains or in aromatic rings. The D mode is the breathing mode of those sp2 sites only in rings, not in chains. Therefore, these bands provide information not only about the amount of coke present on the catalyst, but also about its nature [50]. The influence of the surface-oxygen complex on the coke reactivity [51] was ruled out since the C 1s XPS spectra of all spent catalysts had a very low number of oxygen-containing functional groups and were almost coincident once they were superposed (Fig. 6C).

Furthermore, the coke located on the Pt sites had a lower oxidation temperature than that located on the supports because of the catalytic effect of the Pt sites. If the lower and higher oxidation temperatures were assigned to coke on Pt sites and supports, respectively, the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst must be more stable than the others. However, the catalytic stability observed was in contrast to this postulation as shown in Fig. 5. The coke was located mainly on the supports in this experiment because at least two spent catalysts should have similar oxidation temperatures if the coke is located at Pt sites [18]. Therefore, in this study, the coke oxidation temperature was determined primarily by the nature of the supports via oxygen mobility, which is demonstrated through previous findings that a support with higher oxygen mobility results in a lower oxidation temperature during the regeneration of spent catalysts [17], [18]. In this study, the introduction of the CeyZr1−yO2 phase (higher oxygen mobility) to Al2O3 (lower oxygen mobility) led to a pronounced decrease in the oxidation temperature of the coke.
There was not a clear relationship between the amount of coke and deactivation as compared between the amount of coke in Table 4 and the calculated deactivation parameter. The amount of coke over the spent Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst was not largest, but this catalyst showed the fastest deactivation when compared to the other catalysts. This observation could be explained by the different nature of Pt sites over each reduced catalyst as measured by XPS and CO-IR. It was found that the presence of more electron-deficient Pt sites (Pt sites on terraces) results in a higher mobility of coke precursors, which shields Pt sites from coke deposition and therefore deactivation [47]. However, there is some debate in the literature regarding whether electron-deficient or -rich Pt is beneficial for catalytic stability [50], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56].
The advantage of a low coke oxidation temperature during catalytic regeneration was evaluated by regenerating each catalyst. We selected three representative samples for regeneration; these were Pt-Sn/Al2O3, Pt-Sn/25CeZr-Al, and Pt-Sn/35CeZr-Al catalysts. The regeneration temperature was selected based on the oxidation temperature of the coke obtained from TGA and was 400, 385, and 600 °C for Pt-Sn/25CeZr-Al, Pt-Sn/35CeZr-Al, and Pt-Sn/Al catalysts, respectively.
Fig. 7A and B shows that the Pt-Sn/25CeZr-Al and Pt-Sn/35CeZr-Al catalysts exhibited similar behaviors during a five-cycle regeneration. During the second cycle, the initial propane conversion declined quickly and was equal to half of that measured during the first cycle. Then, only a small deactivation rate and slight change in the initial propane conversion were found after the second cycle. To further assess catalyst stability, the Pt-Sn/35CeZr-Al catalyst was regenerated at 600 °C, as shown in Fig. 7C. It is worth noting that this catalyst showed good tolerance toward deactivation from the second to fifth cycle even at high regeneration temperature. However, regeneration at high temperature comes at the expense of propylene selectivity compared to regeneration at low temperature. The stability of the Pt-Sn/Al2O3 catalyst was opposite that of the Pt-Sn/25CeZr-Al and Pt-Sn/35CeZr-Al catalysts, as shown in Fig. 7D. The initial propane conversion during the second cycle declined sharply and nearly all activity was lost in later cycles.

4. Conclusions
The presence of CeyZr1−yO2 in the Pt-Sn/xCeZr-Al catalysts was crucial for catalytic stability and a low coke combustion temperature. Based on several characterization techniques, the main findings of this study can be summarized as follows:
i.
CeyZr1−yO2 (0 < y < 1) phases were formed over xCeZr-Al (x ≠ 0) supports, and the concentration of Zr4+ ions in these phases increased with increasing CeZr content. The oxygen vacancies in these oxides were necessary for high oxygen mobility, which lessened the oxidation temperature of the coke.
ii.
Pt-Sn alloys were not found at a 2.0 wt.% loading of each metal (Pt, Sn) for all reduced Pt-Sn/xCeZr-Al catalysts. Most of the tin was in the oxidized state; however, the possible presence of a small amount of zero-valent tin should not be excluded.
iii.
Incorporation of CeyZr1−yO2 into the Al2O3 resulted in more electron-deficient Pt sites that were necessary for high catalytic stability against deactivation due to coking.
iv.
The coke oxidation temperature can be diversely tailored by varying the CeyZr1−yO2 content in the Pt-Sn/xCeZr-Al catalysts. The coke oxidation temperature decreased when the CeyZr1−yO2 content increased; the lowest combustion temperature for coke was obtained using 35 wt.% CeyZr1−yO2.
v.
Regeneration of the spent catalysts revealed that CeyZr1−yO2 also plays an important role in the residual stability of the catalysts after several regeneration cycles.
