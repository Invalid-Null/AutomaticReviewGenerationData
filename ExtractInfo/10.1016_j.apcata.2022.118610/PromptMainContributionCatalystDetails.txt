The active sites and catalytic properties of CrOx/Zn-Al2O3 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation
The CrOx-based catalysts supported on Zn-modified alumina were prepared for propane dehydrogenation. The CrOx/Zn-Al2O3 catalysts possess uniform foamed pores with high specific surface area and large pore size. The zinc enriched on the surface of alumina changes the surface energy and acid sites, which decreases interaction between chromium and support so that increases the particle size of crystal Cr2O3 and changes the distribution of Cr species. The dispersion of Cr6+ species on the Zn-modified alumina is improved, and the zinc promotes the formation of more active oligomeric and polymeric chromate on the surface and highly dispersive non-redox Cr3+ species in pore channel simultaneously, which chromium species exhibit high propane conversion and propylene yield. The zinc modifier obviously inhibits the formation of coke deposition to increase catalyst stability.
1. Introduction
Propylene is one of the most important raw material for the synthesis of some industrial products, such as polypropylene, acrylic acid, polyacrylonitrile and propylene oxide [1], [2]. Recently, propylene produced from steam cracking and fluid catalytic cracking of naphtha cannot meet the demand to propylene, therefore the process of the catalytic propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene has been attracted extensive attention, owing to their high propylene yield and low energy consumption [1], [3]. The heterogeneous catalysts, such as CrOx, Pt, VOx, GaOx, SnOx-based catalysts, have been exploited for PDH [1], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Typically, the inexpensive CrOx/Al2O3 catalysts with high activity and good resistance for impurity have been widely applied in the large-scale industrial production of propylene [1], [6], however, the challenge still is enhancive activity and stability of active sites, which are obviously affected by the properties of alumina support. Therefore, a lot of efforts has been done for improving properties of supports [3], [7], [8], [9].
The properties of support, such as acidity, pore structure and interaction between support and chromium oxide, would influence the distribution of Cr active sites and resistance to coking and pore blocking [7], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. The traditional CrOx/γ-Al2O3 catalysts presented excellent PDH reactivity with 53 mol% conversion and 86 mol% selectivity in the industrial Catofin process [1], [11]. However, the alumina possesses the strong surface acidity, which can catalyze the cracking and coking reactions to decrease catalyst stability, so frequent regeneration has to be used [1], [9]. Therefore, modified alumina and other metal oxides were studied as the support of chromium oxide for PDH [10], [11], [14]. Węgrzyniak et al. prepared chromium oxide supported on nanocasted mesoporous alumina and found that Cr6+ species were main Cr sites at low Cr loading, whereas non-redox Cr sites existed predominantly at higher Cr loading (>10%), and the latter presented higher propane conversion (41.8%) and propylene selectivity (89.8%) [15]. Kumar et al. reported that the isolated and oligomeric Cr species were formed on SBA-15 and Al2O3, respectively [7]. De Rossi et al. reported that Cr catalysts supported on ZrO2 were improved the formation of more active mononuclear Cr3+ from reduction of Cr5+ species [16], however, the Cr2O3/ZrO2 catalysts easily deactivated due to its high coking rate and formation of inactive chromium carbides [16], [17]. Węgrzyniak et al. prepared chromium oxide supported on CMK-3 mesoporous carbons for PDH and found that amorphous Cr3+ species were predominated and active on Cr/CMK-3 catalysts [18]. Sim et al. prepared CrOx/Zr-Al2O3 catalysts with improved dispersion of chromium oxide [11], however, CrOx/Zr-Al2O3 catalysts presented lower catalytic activity than CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. In our previous work, tin was used to modify alumina supports, which obviously improve the distribution of Cr active sites and increase the activity of Cr-based catalysts [19]. Unfortunately, the influencing mechanism of support properties on catalytic performance of CrOx-based catalysts has be rarely researched and still unclear.
In the present work, zinc with different basicity and surface energy, comparing with tin, was used as alumina modifier to prepare CrOx/Zn-Al2O3 catalysts for further investigating the structure-reactivity relationships of the CrOx-based catalysts to improve catalytic performances and catalyst stability for PDH. The structure and properties of the supported catalysts were characterized by using N2 adsorption-desorption, TEM, XRD, FTIR, Raman, XPS, NH3-TPD, Py-IR and H2-TPR. The changes of the properties of the supported catalysts after PDH reaction were also investigated to understand the catalytic mechanism of CrOx-based catalysts.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of supports and catalysts
The Zn-modified alumina and supported catalysts were prepared according to previously described methods [19]. Al(iPrO)3 and EtOH were added into a flask with rapid stirring, followed by dropwise HNO3 (68%). Pluronic® F127 ((EO)106(PO)70(EO)106 triblock copolymer, MW= 12600 g/mol) and Zn(NO3)2 were dissolved in EtOH and stirred for 3 h. The Al(iPrO)3 solution was added dropwise into F127 solution and stirred for 8 h. The mixture was dried at 25 °C for 24 h and then at 60 °C for 48 h. The solid was heated to 180 °C and maintained for 2 h, and heated to 350 °C and maintained for 2 h, then heated to 700 °C and maintained for 4 h to obtain Zn-Al2O3, which was denoted as nZnAl (n = 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, corresponding to the ZnO amount of 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 wt%, respectively, and 0ZnAl was labeled as Al).
The supported catalysts with chromium loading of 13 wt% were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation. CrO3 was dissolved in deionized water, and then the solution was added to nZnAl support. The sample was dried at 30 °C for 40 h and calcined at 760 °C for 4 h to obtain Cr/nZnAl catalyst.
2.2. Characterization of catalysts
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on a Shimadzu MAXima XRD-7000 diffractometer operated at 40 kV and 40 mA, using CuKα radiation. The particle sizes (dp) were calculated from Scherrer equation [20]. Nitrogen adsorption and desorption were performed on Quantachrome autosorb (iQ) apparatus. Specific surface area (SBET) was calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method. Pore size distribution was calculated by Barrett-Joiner-Halenda (BJH) method. Micropore surface areas and volumes were calculated by the t-plot method. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on JEOL 2010 microscopy operated at 200 kV. The catalysts were dispersed in ethanol and then dropped on carbon-film coated copper grids. The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on Bruker Tensor 27 instrument. The sample mixed with KBr powder was pressed to a disc. Raman spectra were performed on LabRam HR-UV spectrometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) with a 532 nm He-Cd laser. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) was carried out on ThermoFisher ESCALAB 250Xi with Al-K X-ray source. The binding energies of Cr2p and O1s were detected using the C1s peak at 284.9 eV as a reference. The temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD) was performed on Quantachrome ChemBET Pulsar TPD/TPR. The catalyst was pretreated at 700 °C for 1 h in helium flow of 30 ml/min, and then NH3 in Ar (volume ratio of 1:9) was adsorbed at 100 ◦C for 30 min. Then, the catalyst was blown by He flow for another 65 min. In the end, the NH3-TPD was carried out from 50° to 650°C at a rate of 10 °C/min. The pyridine adsorption infrared spectroscopy (Py-IR) was performed on Thermo Nicolet 380 instrument. The catalyst was pressed to a disc and degassed at 400 °C for 2 h, and then cooled to room temperature to adsorb pyridine for 10 min. The Py-IR was recorded after remove physical adsorbed pyridine. The temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) were performed on Quantachrome Chem BET Pulsar TPD/TPR with TCD. The catalyst (100 mg, 20–40 mesh) was loaded in a U-shape tube reactor. The catalyst was treated in Ar flow of 15 ml/min for 1 h at 550 °C, and then the catalyst was reduced in a mixture of 10% H2 in Ar from 50 °C to 900 °C with heating rate of 10 °C/min. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out on TA instruments SDT-Q600 simultaneous thermal analyzer. The sample was heated from room temperature to 700 °C with a rate of 10 °C/min in air flow of 50 ml/min.
2.3. Catalytic test
The PDH was carried out in a quartz tube reactor. The catalyst (500 mg, 20–40 mesh) was charged into the reactor. The reactor was heated to 610 °C in N2 flow at 20 ml/min and kept for 0.5 h. And then the reactor was maintained at 610 °C in the propane flow of 4.8 ml/min. The composition of exit flow was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (SP-6890, Tianmei Co.) with FID detector.
The propane conversion, propylene selectivity and yield were calculated according to previously described methods [19]：.
where C3H8,in and C3H8,out were the molar content of propane in feed and exit flows respectively, and n was mole number of hydrocarbons in exit flow.
Prior to the catalyst test, the carbon balance was completed by using two gas chromatograph to analyze the amounts of possible products. The carbon balance of 97.8% was obtained by only consideration of methane, ethane, ethylene and propylene as products. The calculating formulas for propane conversion and propylene selectivity with no consideration of carbon balance can present enough precision for evaluating catalytic performances.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of catalysts
XRD patterns of the catalysts are presented in Fig. 1. The diffraction peaks are characteristic for crystalline α-Cr2O3 (JCPD Card No. 84–1616) and γ-Al2O3 (JCPD Card No.10–0425). The larger particle sizes of α-Cr2O3 are presented on Cr/nZnAl catalysts, comparing with Cr/Al catalyst (see Table 1), that may be because the weak interaction between Cr2O3 and support promotes agglomeration of Cr2O3 [21]. The absence of diffraction peak of zinc and CrO3 indicates high dispersion of zinc and CrO3. The similar diffraction patterns of Cr/Al and Cr/nZnAl indicate that the added zinc does not affect crystal structure of chromia and alumina.

The N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms and pore size distributions are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. The isotherm sharps of the type IV with a hysteresis loop of type H1 indicate the presence of columnar mesopores. The added zinc decreases the surface area, accompanied by the formation of small amount of micropore. The amount of added ZnO up to 2% almost does not change the pore volume and pore size but increases micropore area. When zinc loading increases to 3%, the microporous area, pore volume and pore size decrease. Such results predict that added zinc changes the pore structure of the catalysts through changing volume and sharp of double electrode layer of micro-micelle in the forming process of the pore [22].

The TEM images of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 3. The foamed pores with plentiful cavity and uniform pore channel are presented on Cr/Al catalyst. The cavity structures of Cr/nZnAl are maintained. The high dispersion of chromium and zinc are showed on Fig. 3(b and c). The distribution of chromium exhibits a certain correlation with the distribution of zinc. Due to low content of zinc, a lot of chromium is still supported on the surface of alumina.

The FTIR spectra of the catalysts are presented in Fig. S1 in the Supplementary. The peak at 810 cm−1 on alumina is assigned to vibration absorption of Al-O-Al, so the peak at 818 cm−1 on 1ZnAl can be attributed to vibration absorption of Al-O-Zn [23]. This shift means that zinc is doped into alumina framework. Furthermore, the peak shifts from 735 and 580 cm−1 on Cr/Al to 725 and 573 cm−1 on Cr/0.5ZnAl, ascribed to the A2 u model of Cr2O3 and asymmetric octahedron CrO6 in Cr2O6 respectively, reveal that added Zn changes the interaction between chromium oxide and support [24].
The Raman spectra of the catalysts are shown in Fig. 4. For Cr/Al catalyst, the strong peak at 546 cm−1 is attributed to Cr-O vibrations in crystalline Cr2O3, and the peaks at 850, 882, 936 and 991 cm−1 are assigned to monochromate species (CrO42-) and oligomeric chromate species (Cr2O72-, Cr3O102- and Cr4O132-) on the surface of alumina [25], [26], [27], [28]. The peak at 605 cm−1 indicates the presence of polymeric Cr6+ species [29]. Such results indicate that the chromates on Cr/Al catalyst exist in the form of monomeric, oligomeric and polymeric Cr6+ species, and Cr3+ species exist mainly in the form of crystalline Cr2O3. Comparing with Cr/Al catalyst, the increased peak intensity at 993 cm−1 on Cr/0.5ZnAl catalyst indicates that the oligomeric and polymeric chromates are more likely to be formed. The 465 cm−1 assigned to noncrystalline Cr2O3 is observed in Fig. 4 [28]. With increasing Zn amount to 3%, the amount of oligomeric chromates first increases and then decreases, while the peak intensity at 605 cm−1 presents opposite change. This changing trend indicates that more polymeric chromates are formed at the expense of oligomeric species.

The XPS results of chromium in the catalysts are presented in Table 2 and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary. The Cr 2p3/2 signals were deconvolved to two peaks at 576.1–576.7 eV for Cr3+ and 578.6–579.1 eV for Cr6+ [28], [30]. According to Table 2, the chromium contents, especially Cr3+ content, on the surface of the catalysts are obviously lower than theoretical value. According to XRD results, the increased size of Cr2O3 crystallites may lead to decreased amount of Cr3+ species on the surface of the catalysts. According to SEM images (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary), the particle sizes of crystalline Cr2O3 on the surface of Cr/nZnAl increase, but no significant increase of the amount of crystalline Cr2O3 particles is observed, comparing with Cr/Al catalyst. However, due to low representation of SEM analysis, the Cr3+ distribution on the surface and in the bulk of catalysts has to be determined through indirect characterizations and theoretical analysis. Comparing with Cr/Al catalysts, the small amount of Zn can increase the Cr6+/Cr3+ and Cr6+/Al ratios and decrease Cr3+/Al and Cr/Al ratios, indicating that zinc is favor for stabilizing the Cr6+ species and disadvantageous for dispersion of Cr3+ species on the surface of the support. With increasing Zn loadings up to 2%, the dispersion of Cr6+ species increases and Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio is kept. It notes that the Zn is more likely to be distributed on the surface of the Cr/nZnAl catalysts, which shows the far higher Zn/Al atom ratio than the theoretical one. According to O1 s XPS results presented in Fig. S4 in the Supplementary, the relative contents of surface lattice oxygen in the Cr/0.5ZnAl and Cr/1ZnAl catalysts are obviously higher than ones in the Cr/Al and other Cr/nZnAl catalysts. This result means that the added zinc decreases the lattice distortions of alumina, which may improve the acidic sites and reactivity of oxidation dehydrogenation [31].

The surface properties of the support influence Cr species distribution on the surface of the catalyst. Firstly, α-Cr2O3 possesses similar crystal lattice with alumina, so Cr3+ might dope into alumina lattice. However, the ionic radius of Zn2+ is larger than that of Al3+, so the formation of chromia-alumina solid solution is inhibited by Zn-modified alumina to decrease dispersion of Cr3+ species on the surface of the catalysts [11]. Secondly, the surface energy of ZnO (90 ergs/cm2) is far lower than that of alumina (840 ergs/cm2) [32], so the Zn is more easily distributed on the surface of alumina to decrease the surface energy of the support, which decreases interaction between chromium oxide and support, leading to formation of polychromate species and agglomeration of crystalline Cr2O3 [33], as shown in XPS and XRD results (see entry 2 in Table 2 and Table 1). Due to stronger interaction between Cr3+ and support in the pore channel than that on the surface, the Cr3+ species are more likely to disperse in the pore channel as small particle [21]. Thirdly, the IEP of ZnO (9.3) is larger than that of γ-Al2O3 (8.0) [34], [35], so more basicity exists in the surface layer adsorbed water on ZnO. The acidic CrO42- easily reacts with basic hydroxyl group to form polynuclear Cr6+ species [21], [27], so more oligochromate and polychromate are formed on Cr/nZnAl catalysts, as that Raman results present.
The acidity of the catalysts was characterized by NH3-TPD and Py-IR methods. The NH3-TPD results are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 3. The weak, medium and strong acid sites are determined according to peak value in the ranges of 100–200 °C, 200–300 °C and 300–650 °C, respectively[30], [36]. For five catalysts, the strong acid contents are higher than weak and medium acid contents. Comparing with Cr/Al catalysts, decreased strong acid and total acid sites are presented on Cr/nZnAl catalysts. It is worth noting that the total acid sites on Cr/Al and Cr/nZnAl catalysts is far lower than CrOx supported on commercial alumina [37]. The result indicates that preparing method of the supports in this work can effetely decrease the acid sites.

However, the shapes of NH3-TPD curves of Cr/nZnAl catalysts are more complex, indicating the presence of more types of acid sites originated from acidic Cr3+ and Cr6+, coordinative unsaturated Al3+ and aluminum hydroxyl [10]. According to XPS results, the zinc is more easily dispersed on the surface of the Cr/nZnAl catalysts, so Cr/nZnAl catalysts possess more complex surface acid sites. According to Py-IR and O1 s XPS results (see Table 3 and Fig. S4 in the Supplementary), the Lewis acid sites originated from surface coordinative unsaturated Al3+ ions of alumina are main acid sites for all catalysts, whereas higher amount of Brönsted acid sites are presented on Cr/Al catalyst. It is worth noting that the added zinc can obviously decrease the Brönsted acid sites to close zero on Cr/nZnAl catalysts. After adding Zn into alumina, extra acid sites are formed due to changing unsaturation sites of Al3+ ions through formation of Al-O-Zn, which indicates that zinc is mainly doped in framework of alumina instead of only covering on alumina surface. Such results are consistent with FTIR, XPS and TEM results [38]. Meanwhile, adding basic ZnO decreases total acidity. Furthermore, the surface nature of Zn-modified alumina would affect the distribution of Cr species, which provide extra acid sites [10]. The slightly increased peak temperatures of the acid sites are presented on Cr/nZnAl catalysts, so added Zn into alumina increases the intensity of acid sites. Yu et al. observed that the Zn poisoned strong acid of Zn-Pt/Al2O3 catalyst, although it increased total acidity [39]. Similar, Zhang et al. reported that Zn doped into ZSM-5 could poison weak acid and strong acid sites of support, but it increased the intensity of the remaining acid centers [40]. So the adjustment of Zn to acid site depends on kind of oxide, preparing method and process.
The H2-TPR results are presented in Fig. 6 and Table 4. The TPR profile of Cr/Al presents two peaks. The large peak of 200–450 °C is assigned to the reduction of oligochromate and polychromate exposed on alumina, and the peak of 550–750 °C is attributed to reduction of monochromate anchored directly onto the support surface [23], [41], [42], [43], [44]. Differently from Cr/Al catalyst, a single peak at 250–450 °C is presented on Cr/nZnAl catalysts. It could be caused by inhibition of zinc to the formation of monochromate, agreeing with Raman results. Similarly, Fang et al. found that single peak at 372 °C was presented on mesoporous Cr2O3/Al2O3 catalyst [45]. However, the H2 consumptions on Cr/nZnAl catalysts are obviously lower than that of Cr/Al catalyst, and even they are lower than that of T1 peak of Cr/Al. This indicates that the amounts of reducible oligochromate and polychromate of Cr/nZnAl catalysts are lower than that of Cr/Al catalyst. With increasing Zn loadings, the peak value shifts from 340 °C to 378 °C, but H2 consumption is almost constant. Such results are related to the changed interaction between chromium oxide and Zn-modified alumina [31]. The small amount of Zn doped into alumina decreases the interaction between Cr species and support so that to increase particle size of polymeric Cr6+ species. However, the alumina modified by more zinc does not change the amount of the reducible oligomeric and polymeric Cr6+ species [44], which is consistent with XPS results.

3.2. The catalytic performance of catalysts
3.2.1. Reactivity of catalysts
The results of PDH on Cr/nZnAl catalysts are presented in Fig. 7. Comparing with Cr/Al catalyst, the Cr/nZnAl catalysts show higher propane conversion and propylene yield, although propylene selectivity slightly decreases. The results indicate that Zn enhances the distribution of Cr active sites. With increasing Zn from 0.5% to 3%, the decreased propane conversion and propylene yield indicate that more Zn has an adverse impact on PDH.

Comparing with Cr/Al catalyst, higher initial propane conversions are presented on Cr/nZnAl catalysts. According to Raman, XPS and H2-TPR results, the monochromates and oligochromate mainly exist in Cr/Al catalyst, as a contrast, the oligochromate and polychromate are mainly presented on Cr/nZnAl catalysts. The active Cr6+ species can catalyze propane to produce propylene through oxidation dehydrogenation process and they themselves are reduced to Cr3+, accompanied by more cracking and hydrogenolysis products, which decrease the propylene selectivity [3], [10], [14], [21], [46], [47], [48]. The above results reveal that the oligochromate and polychromate on Cr/nZnAl catalysts exhibit higher activity. At reaction temperature of 610 °C, the propane can effetely reduce Cr6+ species on Cr/nZnAl catalysts with different peak value in H2-TPR results, so the influence of the reduced difficulty of Cr6+ species on catalytic activity is not apparent. The produced redox Cr3+ species are highly dispersive and it can further catalyze PDH with high activity [3]. The rate constant of oxidation dehydrogenation is larger than that of direct dehydrogenation, so propane conversion decreases [3]. Meanwhile, the deactivation caused by coke deposition, especially in micropore, is unavoidable, so fast decrease of propane conversion at first 15 min is a composite effect of changed reaction from oxidation hydrogenation to direct hydrogenation and coke formation [3], [7].
The distribution of Cr active sites on Cr/nZnAl catalysts are influenced by the surface properties of the support. According to H2-TPR result, lower H/Cr ratio than theoretical value indicates that reducible Cr6+ species is only a small portion of Cr species. According to XPS results, the most Cr species on the surface exist as Cr3+ species, and the Cr content on the surface is obviously lower than theoretical one. This result means that most of Cr3+ species is highly dispersive in pore channel in the form of smaller particle than pore size [7], [27]. The highly dispersive Cr3+ species with high catalytic activity can provide sufficient active species to maintain high propane conversion and propylene selectivity in longer reaction times for all catalysts [7]. Yue et al. reported that the Brönsted acid sites could catalyze cracking reaction of propane [2]. However, the propylene selectivity on Cr/nZnAl catalysts decreases by added zinc modifier, although the zinc obviously decreases the amount of the Brönsted acid sites.
Comparing with other Cr/nZnAl catalysts, Cr/0.5ZnAl has similar Cr6+/Cr3+ ratio, low-dispersive Cr species, lower Cr3+ and Cr6+ contents on the surface of the catalyst. However, the highest activity of PDH is presented on Cr/0.5ZnAl catalyst. According to Raman results, Cr/0.5ZnAl has more oligomeric and polymeric Cr6+ species. More importantly, according to the XPS results, the highly dispersive Zn is favor to distribute on the surface of alumina to hinder the distribution of Cr species on the surface of support, so more Cr species is dispersed in the pore channel, due to the interaction between chromium oxide and alumina is stronger than the interaction between chromium oxide and zinc-modified alumina. Because of confinement action of the pore channel, the particle size of non-redox Cr3+ species is small and highly dispersive. According to the XPS results, it is speculated that the Cr3+ content on the surface of Cr/0.5ZnAl catalyst is lower than that on the surface of other catalysts, which means that the more highly dispersive non-redox Cr3+ species with good activity are distributed in the pore channel of Cr/0.5ZnAl catalyst. This also is important reason that all Cr/nZnAl catalysts have more activity than Cr/Al catalyst, although the former have larger particle size of crystalline ɑ-Cr2O3 [49]. The similar H2 consumption presented on Cr/nZnAl catalysts indicates that four Cr/nZnAl catalysts have similar amount of reducible oligomeric and polymeric Cr6+ species, so different activity on Cr/nZnAl catalysts is caused by highly dispersive non-redox Cr3+ species observed through Raman spectra. According to XPS and Raman results, the high Cr3+ content and monochromate species are presented on the surface of Cr/2ZnAl catalyst. The Cr3+ species on the surface exist mainly in the form of inactive crystalline Cr2O3 that decreases highly dispersive Cr3+ content in the pore channel. So the Cr/2ZnAl catalyst exhibited low activity.
After TOS of 180 min, almost all Cr6+ species on the surface of Cr/0.5ZnAl are reduced to Cr3+ species, accompanied by the decrease of the dispersion of Cr and Zn species (see entry 6 in Table 2 and Fig. 8(a)). This result is different with CrOx/Sn-Al2O3 catalysts, presenting an important evidence of the influence of support properties on active Cr species [19]. After regeneration, the dispersions of Cr and Zn species recover, while Cr6+ content increases, but it is unable to be recovered completely. According to Fig. 8(b), the recovered Cr6+ are mainly oligomeric and polymeric Cr6+ species, which possess high activity for PDH. However, the high propane conversion and propylene selectivity are presented on regenerated Cr/0.5ZnAl catalyst (see Fig. 7(d)). These results indicate that dehydrogenation and regeneration affect the re-distribution of Cr and Zn species, and the dispersion of Cr and Zn is recovered completely in the regeneration process.

Moreover, for Cr/1ZnAl catalyst, the Cr6+ species almost completely disappear after TOS of 180 min, but the oligomeric and polymeric Cr6+ present recover after regeneration (see Fig. 8). The result also indicates that adding zinc decreases the chromium-support interaction, so redox Cr3+ species are re-oxidized more easily. In the present word, the catalytic activity obviously decreased after complete reduction of Cr6+ species (see Fig. 7 and Table 2). However, the high activity is still maintained. The peak intensity at 467 cm−1, corresponding to non-redox Cr3+ species, does not significantly change, so the spent Cr/nZnAl catalysts still present high activity. Therefore Cr active species distribution are affected by the interaction between Cr and support, which is adjusted by modifier and modification method of support.
According to above discussion, the reaction pathways of propane dehydrogenation on Cr/nZnAl catalysts are proposed in Scheme 1. During the initial stage of reaction, the oxidation dehydrogenation is carried out on Cr6+-O species, which is reduced to redox Cr3+ species, and then the redox Cr3+ species continuously catalyze the propane dehydrogenation to produce propylene and hydrogen. Meanwhile the non-redox Cr3+ species catalyze direct dehydrogenation of propane to produce propylene. According to XPS and TPR results, the non-redox Cr3+ species play an important role for high PDH activity.

3.2.2. Coke deposition
The coke deposition as an important reason of the inactivation on CrOx-based catalysts for PDH was characterized by TG-DSC analysis. The coke deposition of the spent Cr/nZnAl catalysts are presented in Table 5 and Fig. S5 in the Supplementary. For CrOx-based catalysts, the coke deposition is related to strong acidic sites, catalytic reactivity of propylene, oxidation state of chromium and apparent surface density of Cr sites [14], [30], [48]. For Cr/nZnAl catalysts, the coke deposition obviously decreases with increasing Zn loadings from 0% to 2%, because the Zn affects not only the amounts of Lewis and Brønsted acid sites but also distribution of Cr active species. However, the Cr/3ZnAl presents abnormal high coke deposition. It may be because Cr/3ZnAl catalyst possesses high apparent surface density of Cr sites. Among the Cr/nZnAl catalysts, the Cr/2ZnAl presents the best performance of restraining the coke formation due to it has higher Cr dispersion (see Table 2), lower strong acid sites and PDH activity. The different peak temperature (Tpeak) on DSC curves also presents variety of coke deposition. The lower Tpeak on Cr/nZnAl catalysts means that coke is more easily removed. Comparing with Cr/1SnAl catalyst in our previous work, the Cr/1ZnAl catalyst possesses less coke deposition, indicating that zinc modifier presents better resistance to coke deposition than tin modifier, due to zinc can more effectively decrease strong acid sites and apparent surface density of Cr sites [19].

4. Conclusion
The chromium oxides supported on Zn-modified alumina were prepared to obtain Cr/nZnAl catalysts for propane dehydrogenation. The Cr/nZnAl catalysts possess foamed pore with highly dispersive distribution of chromium and zinc. The zinc is doped into alumina framework to decrease surface area and increase pore size. The properties of alumina, such as ionic radius, surface energy and isoelectric point, have been effectively adjusted through zinc modification to improve the distribution and dispersion of Cr active sites, so the high active oligomeric and polymeric chromates, non-redox Cr3+ are formed on the surface and pore channel of the supported catalysts. The Cr/nZnAl catalysts present high activity of propane dehydrogenation and propylene yield, and the reaction pathways of propane dehydrogenation on Cr/nZnAl catalysts are proposed. Meanwhile, the adding zinc neutralizes strong acid sites of catalysts to obviously decrease coke deposition.
