The supplied document does not appear to be related to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). It discusses the development of a liquid chromatography ion mobility mass spectrometry (LC-IM-MS) method for analysis of anabolic steroids and their metabolites. While it provides details on optimizing the separation and quantification of these compounds, it does not pertain to PDH or ODH processes for converting propane to propylene.
