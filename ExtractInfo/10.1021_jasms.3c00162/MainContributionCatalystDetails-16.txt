 Unfortunately the provided extracts do not contain enough information for me to provide a coherent summary in the requested XML format. The extracts mention the development of a liquid chromatography-ion mobility-mass spectrometry (LC-IM-MS) method for analyzing anabolic steroids, but do not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation catalysts and processes. Without relevant details on PDH/ODH catalyst compositions, performance metrics, reaction conditions, etc., I cannot populate the different fields of the XML template. Please provide source documents that focus specifically on PDH/ODH catalyst research so that I can extract pertinent details and synthesize them into the structured XML format.
