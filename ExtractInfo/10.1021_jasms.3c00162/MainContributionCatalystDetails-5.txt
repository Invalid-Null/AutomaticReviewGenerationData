 Unfortunately the provided documents do not contain enough information for me to provide a comprehensive summary in the requested XML format. The documents appear to be about developing analytical methods for anabolic steroids, and do not mention propane dehydrogenation or contain details about catalysts, conversion rates, selectivities, etc. As such, I do not believe these documents are relevant to summarizing advances in PDH or ODH research. Please provide documents that directly pertain to propane dehydrogenation catalysis research in order for me to synthesize the key findings into a unified XML summary.
