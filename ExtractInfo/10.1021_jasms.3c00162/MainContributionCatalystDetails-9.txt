 Unfortunately the provided documents do not contain enough information for me to provide a comprehensive summary in the requested XML format. The documents discuss the development of analytical methods for anabolic steroids, and do not mention propane dehydrogenation or contain relevant details about PDH/ODH catalysts, performance, or process conditions. Since there are no substantive extracts related to PDH/ODH research in the given documents, I cannot synthesize or aggregate findings into a unified XML entry. Please provide documents containing multiple relevant extractions about PDH or ODH catalysts and process advancements, and I will attempt to summarize the key details in the requested format.
