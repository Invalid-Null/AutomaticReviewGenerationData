 Unfortunately I do not have multiple extractions from the same document to aggregate into a summary. The provided documents appear to be unrelated to propane dehydrogenation research, as I indicated in my previous responses. If multiple relevant extracts from the same source are provided, I would be happy to synthesize them into a cohesive XML summary following the template structure. Please let me know if you would like me to try this for a different set of inputs.
