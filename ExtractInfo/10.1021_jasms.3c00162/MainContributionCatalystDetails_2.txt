 Based on my analysis, the supplied document does not contain information relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation.

The document discusses the development of a liquid chromatography-ion mobility-mass spectrometry (LC-IM-MS) method for the analysis of anabolic steroids, but does not mention propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. It focuses on the separation and quantification of prohibited anabolic steroids and metabolites for applications such as doping control in sports. Since the document does not pertain to converting propane to propylene via PDH or ODH processes, I have indicated that it is not relevant.
