The given document discusses the conversion of methane, ethane, and propane over Pt+ cations generated by laser dissociation, and does not specifically discuss propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The document focuses on investigating the reaction mechanisms of alkane conversion by Pt+ rather than improving any catalytic performance. Therefore, this document does not seem directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation to propylene.
