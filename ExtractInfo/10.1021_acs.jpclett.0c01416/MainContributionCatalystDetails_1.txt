 Based on the details in the document, this does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation to propylene. The document discusses the conversion of methane, ethane and propane over Pt+ cations generated by laser irradiation of Pt clusters. While propane conversion is mentioned, there is no indication that the conversion involves dehydrogenation specifically to propylene. The catalyst appears to promote dehydrogenation to various alkenes and alkynes, but propylene is not singled out as the product.
