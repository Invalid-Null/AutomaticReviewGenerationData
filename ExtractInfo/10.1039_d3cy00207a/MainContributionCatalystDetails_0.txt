The provided document does not seem to be directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation for producing propylene. While it discusses catalytic oxidation of propane over vanadium antimonate catalysts, the main focus appears to be selective oxidation to oxygenated products like acrolein and acrylic acid rather than dehydrogenation to propylene. The document does not report performance metrics specifically for propylene yield or propane dehydrogenation. Since the relevance to PDH/ODH to propylene is unclear, I have indicated "No" relevance in the output. Please let me know if I have missed any relevant connection to PDH/ODH to propylene conversion that should be extracted.
