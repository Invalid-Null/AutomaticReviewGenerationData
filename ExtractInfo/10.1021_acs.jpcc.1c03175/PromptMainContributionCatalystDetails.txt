Correlating the Structural Evolution of ZnO/Al2O3 to Spinel Zinc Aluminate with its Catalytic Performance in Propane Dehydrogenation
Abstract
We correlate the catalytic activity for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) of a series of Zn-based Al2O3 catalysts with their structure and structural evolution. To this end, three model catalysts are investigated: (i) ZnO/Al2O3 prepared by atomic layer deposition (ALD) of ZnO onto γ-Al2O3 followed by calcination at 700 °C, which yields a core–shell spinel zinc aluminate/γ-Al2O3; (ii) zinc aluminate spinel nanoparticles (ZnxAlyO4 NPs) prepared via a hydrothermal method; and (iii) ZnO/SiO2 prepared by ALD of ZnO on SiO2. The catalysts are characterized by synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Zn K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and 27Al solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR). We identify tetrahedral Zn sites in close proximity to Al sites of a zinc aluminate spinel phase (ZnIV–O–AlIV/VI linkages) as more active and selective in PDH relative to the supported ZnO wurtzite phase (ZnIV–O– ZnIV linkages) in ZnO/SiO2. 50ZnO/Al2O3 gives 77% selectivity to propene at 9 mmol C3H6 gcat–1 h–1 space-time yield after 3 min of reaction at 600 °C. The ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst shows an irreversible loss of activity over repeated PDH and air-regeneration cycles attributed to Zn depletion on the surface, while the activity loss of ZnxAlyO4 NPs due to coke deposition can be recovered by air regeneration.

Propene is a key commodity for the production of a wide variety of chemicals such as polypropylene, propene oxide, acrylonitrile, cumene, or acrylic acid. (1) Currently, the supply of propene from traditional routes such as fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and steam cracking of naphtha (2) is decreasing because of the replacement of naphtha by ethane in crackers (owing to the availability of inexpensive shale gas). (3) The main industrial on-purpose technologies for the dehydrogenation of propane to propene (PDH) are the Catofin and the Oleflex processes that rely on Cr- and Pt-based catalysts, respectively. (2,4) However, because of the high price and low availability of platinum and the toxicity of CrVI, (5) the development of alternative, low cost and environmentally benign catalysts is of great importance. (6)
Metal oxide catalysts, including gallium, cobalt, aluminum, and zinc oxide-based catalysts, are currently researched actively for the selective dehydrogenation of propane to propene. (2,7−13) The metal sites on the surface of these oxides can exhibit different coordination environments and undergo changes in the oxidation state during the PDH reaction, which affect their catalytic performance. This has driven considerable research efforts to understand the active sites at the atomic level. (9,13−17) Catalysts with active Zn sites (primarily, dispersed Zn2+ cations or complex oxides containing Zn2+, for instance spinel-type oxides or zeolites) are promising candidates considering the low cost and generally low toxicity of Zn. (9,18) Bulk ZnO is considered almost inactive in PDH. (14) The low activity of ZnO is worsened by the instability of bulk ZnO in reducing conditions at high temperatures (>550 °C); that is, ZnO can reduce to metallic Zn (melting point of Zn is 420 °C) and/or form volatile Zn species. (14,19) However, it has been reported that the most active and selective Zn-based alkane dehydrogenation catalysts contain dispersed Zn2+ cations stabilized on a support. (8,9,14,19,20) Several studies suggest that the nature of the support determines the local structure and coordination geometry of the Zn sites and therefore influences the catalyst’s performance. (9,21) That being said, the atomic scale structure of the most active sites in Zn-containing catalysts remains under intensive investigation. For example, isolated Zn2+ cations with tetrahedral coordination have been proposed as active sites for alkane dehydrogenation in Zn-containing zeolites. (20,22,23) In addition, it has been suggested that the proximity of Zn2+ and Al3+ sites plays an important role, as basic Al-bound oxygen is essential for the heterolytic cleavage of the C–H bond, according to theoretical calculations. (7,18) The active sites in alumina-supported zinc-based catalysts, prepared by wetness impregnation (WI) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD), were assessed by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) and diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) with probe molecules (CO and H2), and Zn2+ sites bonded to alumina were reported to be the active sites with higher reducibility compared to supported ZnO nanoparticles. (8) Moreover, single-site Zn2+ on silica support (14,21) and, more recently, tricoordinated isolated Zn2+ sites anchored on (doped) ZrO2 were also reported to be highly active in PDH. (9) While such dispersed Zn2+ sites are highly active, they can be reduced during PDH, leading to catalyst deactivation with time on stream (TOS). Other deactivation routes of Zn2+ sites include coke deposition, ZnO formation, or Zn difussion, (8,18) whereby in particular the latter process deserves further detailed structural studies.
In this work, we aim at (i) describing the nature of Zn sites in ZnO layers supported on γ-Al2O3 (denoted 10, 30, and 50ZnO/Al2O3) obtained by atomic layer deposition; (ii) understanding the interplay between the coordination of Zn and Al sites, their local structure, and the catalytic activity in PDH; and (iii) determining deactivation route(s). We address these scientific questions by evaluating in detail the atomic scale structure and catalytic performance for ZnO/Al2O3 and ZnO/SiO2 model catalysts prepared via ALD of ZnO on γ-Al2O3 or SiO2, respectively, followed by a heat treatment at 700 °C. Furthermore, we synthesize ZnxAlyO4 nanoparticles (NPs, ca. 4 nm average crystallite size) using a hydrothermal approach. We investigate the structure of these catalysts via synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Zn K-edge, 27Al solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Our findings show that upon thermal treatment, ALD-deposited ZnO reacts with γ-Al2O3, yielding tetrahedral Zn2+ in a zinc aluminate phase shell that covers the γ-Al2O3 core. The ZnIV–O–AlIV/VI linkages present in ZnO/Al2O3 outperform poorly active ZnIV–O–ZnIV linkages found in ZnO/SiO2 in terms of PDH catalytic activity and selectivity. However, ALD-derived core–shell ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts deactivate significantly with TOS and over repeated air regeneration cycles. We explain this deactivation by the diffusion of Zn from the surface layers into the inner layers of alumina, leading to an irreversible loss of activity. The initial space-time yield (STY, per gram of catalyst) of ZnxAlyO4 NPs was similar to that of ZnO/Al2O3; both materials contain ZnIV–O–AlIV/VI sites. ZnxAlyO4 NPs deactivate under TOS to a lower extent than ZnO/Al2O3, and deactivation is mainly due to coke formation. In contrast to ZnO/Al2O3, the catalytic activity of ZnxAlyO4 NPs can be regenerated largely (more than 90%) under airflow at 650 °C.

Synthesis
ALD-Deposited ZnO/Al2O3 and ZnO/SiO2
SiO2 and γ-Al2O3 supports were mixed with water to form homogeneous slurries that were dried at 120 °C overnight. The resulting chunks of SiO2 and γ-Al2O3 were crushed and sieved to obtain a 150–300 μm size fraction that was used subsequently for the ALD synthesis. Deposition of ZnO on SiO2 or γ-Al2O3 was carried out in a commercial ALD system (Picosun R-200) integrated in an N2 glovebox and equipped with a POCA system, which is a reaction chamber setup used for powder coating. The powder holder with a pore size of 40–100 μm was filled with approximately 100 mg of support (γ-Al2O3 or SiO2). For the deposition of ZnO, diethyl zinc (DEZ) and DI water were utilized. High-purity N2 was used as both carrier and purge gas. The pulse and purge times were 0.1, 15, 0.1, and 15 s for DEZ, N2, H2O, and N2, respectively, using three pulses for both DEZ and H2O for a total of 10–50 cycles. The deposition temperature was 150 °C. Under these conditions, STEM analysis of ZnO coated (for γ-Al2O3) NPs revealed a deposition rate of ca. 0.17 nm of ZnO per one ALD cycle. The as-deposited materials were calcined at 700 °C (4 °C min–1) for 4 h in a muffle furnace under static air. The zinc content in the calcined materials was determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) experiments, and the results are presented in Table 1.

Zinc Aluminate Nanoparticles
ZnxAlyO4 nanoparticles (ZnxAlyO4-NPs) were synthesized using a modified hydrothermal method as reported elsewhere. (24) For Zn0.15Al2.56O4 (Zn/Al ratio according to ICP-AES), polyethylene glycol (PEG, 7.848 g, 1.31 mmol) was dissolved in DI water (100 mL) followed by the addition of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (3.245 g, 10.91 mmol) and Al(NO3)3·9H2O (8.184 g, 21.82 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred to obtain a clear solution. Then, the pH was adjusted to 10.5 by the dropwise addition of an aqueous ammonia solution (35 vol.%) under continuous stirring. When pH 10.5 was achieved, ammonia addition was stopped and the resulting solution was stirred for an additional two hours. The slurry obtained was transferred to a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-lined stainless steel autoclave and aged under static air at 110 °C for 3 days. After the mixture cooled to ambient conditions, the precipitate was recovered by centrifugation, washed with DI water (3 × 300 mL), and calcined at 700 °C (4 °C min–1) for 4 h under static air in a muffle furnace. A similar approach was used to synthesize zinc aluminate NPs with varying Zn/Al molar ratios (see Table 2 for the ICP-AES results). The molar ratio of all cations to PEG was kept constant at 25. A crystalline reference zinc aluminate spinel (denoted bulk-ZnAl2O4) was synthesized for the sake of comparison to aid the XAS and NMR analyses (see the Supporting Information for synthesis details and XRD characterization).

Characterization
For laboratory-based X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), a PANalytical Empyrean diffractometer equipped with Bragg–Brentano HD incident beam optics and an X’Celerator Scientific ultrafast line detector was used. Kα radiation of a Cu anode at 45 kV and 40 mA was used to perform scans in the 2θ range of 5–100° with a step size of 0.017° and acquisition time of 0.65 s per step.
Synchrotron XRD and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) were carried out at Swiss Norwegian Beamline (SNBL, BM31) of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), Grenoble, France. A Si(111) double crystal monochromator was used in a continuous scan mode, and the data were collected in transmission mode with a step size of 0.5 eV and 140 ms acquisition time within the 9.45–10.2 keV range. A DEXELA detector was used to collect the XRD data having a Si(111) channel-cut monochromator set at a wavelength (λ) of 0.493 Å. (25) Synchrotron XRD data were collected in 1 mm diameter quartz capillaries.
In situ combined XRD-XAS studies were carried out in a quartz capillary cell (0.1 mm wall thickness and outer diameter of 1.5 mm). The specimen were placed between two plugs of quartz wool in a quartz capillary that was heated by an air blower, reaching up to 790 °C (at the specimen). Prior to the measurements, the blower temperature was calibrated using a thermocouple placed in the middle of the capillary under a constant flow of N2. A schematic of the beamline setup has been described elsewhere. (26,27)
27Al magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) was acquired using an Avance III HD NMR spectrometer (Bruker) working at the Larmor frequency of 400 MHz for the 1H nucleus. A 3.2 mm double resonance probe was tuned to 104.26 MHz for the 27Al nuclei using spinning rates between 15 and 18 kHz. Materials were packed into 3.2 mm zirconia rotors in air and were spun using N2 as bearing, drive, and VT flows. The 13C signal of adamantane was used as an external secondary reference to calibrate the ppm scale of the spectra.
Scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray mapping (STEM-EDX) were acquired using an FEI Talos F200X. The operation voltage of the instrument was set to 200 kV in scanning electron microscopic (STEM) mode.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed in a Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC3+ instrument. The specimen was loaded into a 70 μL platinum crucible, heated to 1000 °C under synthetic air (30 mL min–1) using a 10 °C min–1 ramp rate, and kept at this temperature for 10 min.
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) (28) surface areas and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) (29) pore size distributions were calculated using N2 physisorption data acquired on a NOVA 4000e (Quantachrome) instrument at −196 °C. Prior to the measurement, materials were outgassed at 300 °C under vacuum for 3 h.
A Thermo Fisher DXR2 Raman spectrometer equipped with a 455 nm laser reaching up to 6 mW laser power was used to collect Raman spectra. A full range grating with a resolution of 1200 lines mm–1 was used to collect the spectra within 100–3600 cm–1. Each Raman spectrum reported here is an average of 10 spectra collected at different points on the specimen to ensure homogeneity and reproducibility.
Catalytic Tests
Prepared catalysts (100 mg, sieved fraction of 150–300 μm) were mixed with 200 mg of SiC and placed between two plugs of quartz wool on a quartz frit in a 10 mm internal diameter (12.5 mm outer diameter) quartz reactor. The catalytic reactivity was measured using 10 mol % C3H8 in N2 in a commercial Microreactivity-Efficient catalyst test setup (PID Eng&Tech). The off-gas was analyzed by a gas chromatography instrument (GC, Global Analyzer Solutions) equipped with two thermal conductivity detectors (TCD) and one flame ionization detector (FID). The catalysts were heated to 600 °C (10 °C min–1) under N2 (21 mL min–1); the feed gas was then introduced, and GC data was collected every three minutes. Catalyst regeneration was performed after ca. 90 min of the PDH reaction by flowing synthetic air (21 mL min–1) for 20 min at 650 °C, followed by a 10 min purge with N2 (21 mL min–1) while cooling.
Propane conversion (X), the selectivity to gas-phase products (S), and space-time yield were calculated according to the following equations:
where Fi and FA are the flow of carbon product i and A out of the reactor in mL h–1. ni and nA are the number of carbons in molecular formula of product i and product A. FC3H8in and Fout are the propane inlet and total outlet flows, respectively. Other parameters used are the molar volume of a gas at room temperature and atmospheric pressure (24450 mL mol–1), and yC3H6 is the mole fraction of propene in the products.

Catalysts’ Structure
Aiming at establishing a structure–performance relationship for zinc-based, alumina-supported PDH catalysts, we set about to identify the role of the alumina support in defining the structure of Zn sites. To this end, we prepared three types of model catalysts: (i) ZnO coated on γ-Al2O3 nanoparticles via ALD, using 10, 30, or 50 ALD cycles (denoted as 10ZnO/Al2O3, 30ZnO/Al2O3, and 50ZnO/Al2O3, respectively); (ii) ZnO coated onto SiO2 nanoparticles via ALD (10ZnO/SiO2 and 30ZnO/SiO2); (iii) ZnxAlyO4 nanoparticles (NPs) obtained via a hydrothermal method, with varying molar ratios of Zn:Al. The prepared materials were calcined at 700 °C under static air for 4 h. The Zn content of each material determined by ICP-AES and the BET surface areas (SAs) are given in Tables 1 and 2. To characterize the average and local structure of the materials, we have applied synchrotron-based XRD and Zn K-edge XAS as well as STEM-EDX and 27Al MAS NMR.
Average Structure and Morphology
ALD deposition of ZnO on γ-Al2O3 using DEZ and steam pulses at 150 °C results in the formation of a wurtzite ZnO shell on top of a γ-Al2O3 core (Figure S1). After calcination at 700 °C, synchrotron XRD analysis reveals the formation of a ZnAl2O4 spinel phase in ZnO/Al2O3 materials (Figure 1a), i.e., ZnO reacts with the γ-Al2O3 support forming a spinel ZnAl2O4 phase, likely via ZnO diffusion through γ-Al2O3. (30) ZnAl2O4 has a spinel type structure with Zn2+ and Al3+ in tetrahedral and octahedral sites, respectively. The structure of γ-Al2O3 is highly debated; it has been described as a defective spinel with Al3+ in tetrahedral and octahedral sites, but other nonspinel models have also been proposed. (31) Although certain apparent resemblance between γ-Al2O3 and ZnAl2O4 structures exists, the diffraction patterns of each phase can be distinguished well by their peak positions and relative intensity, as shown in Figure 1a. (32) For instance, the 440 diffraction peak of ZnAl2O4 is observed at lower 2θ angles (19.86°) with respect to the same reflection of γ-Al2O3 (20.39°) because of the difference in the cell parameters (7.911 and 8.086 Å, for ZnAl2O4 and γ-Al2O3, respectively). (33,34) The XRD patterns of ZnO/Al2O3 materials contain discernible reflections of γ-Al2O3 and ZnAl2O4. The higher intensities of the 220 and 311 reflections (as compared to γ-Al2O3) further indicate the formation of a ZnAl2O4 phase. The relative content of ZnAl2O4 phase increases with number of ALD cycles as follows from the increasing intensity of the 440 peak of ZnAl2O4 relative to the intensity of the 440 peak of γ-Al2O3 (indexed for convenience according to the space group Fd3m (31) in Figure S1). We also notice a subtle peak shift (of ca. −0.03°) of the γ-Al2O3 peak, which can be due to the diffusion of Zn into the γ-Al2O3 core. Previous studies have suggested the migration of ZnO through Al2O3 is based on the Kirkendall effect via a vacancy diffusion mechanism. (30)

Oxygen, aluminum, and zinc atoms are represented in red, blue, and gray, respectively.
STEM-EDX and line mapping of the ZnO/Al2O3 materials (Figures 1b and S2) show the distribution of Zn and Al in and on the agglomerated nanoparticles. The images reveal a Zn-rich shell around an Al-rich core (see the line map in Figure 1b). Complemented with XRD results, this suggests a microstructure in which a ZnAl2O4 shell covers the γ-Al2O3 core (i.e., a ZnAl2O4/Al2O3 core–shell type structure shown schematically in Figure 1c).
Unlike core–shell ZnO/Al2O3 materials, ZnxAlyO4 NPs exhibit a single-phase nanocrystalline spinel type structure. By increasing the Zn/Al ratio (Figure 1a and Table 2), the 400 diffraction peak shifts toward lower 2θ angles, indicating an increase in the cell parameter that was determined (using full profile analysis) as 7.943(2), 7.981(2), and 8.064(1) Å for Zn0.06Al2.63O4, Zn0.15Al2.56O4, and Zn0.42Al2.39O4 NPs, respectively (Figure S3). STEM-EDX mapping reveals a homogeneous distribution of Zn and Al (Figures 1b and S4) within the ZnxAlyO4 NPs, in contrast to the core–shell type structure of ZnO/Al2O3 materials. Thus, the combined information of XRD and EDX analyses shows that the ZnxAlyO4 NP materials can be described as homogeneous ZnxAlyO4 solid solutions.
Turning to the ZnO/SiO2 materials, the XRD patterns show diffraction peaks due to crystalline wurtzite ZnO (P63mc space group, Figure S5). Similar to ZnO/Al2O3 materials, a core–shell structure can be seen also for the ALD-made ZnO/SiO2 according to the STEM-EDX mapping results (Figure S6).
Local Structure of Zn and Al Sites
To determine coordination of Al in our materials, we use 27Al MAS NMR. (35) Al sites that are tetra-, penta- and hexacoordinated with O (AlIV, AlV, and AlVI) give rise to distinct NMR peaks with maxima at ca. 65, 28, and 7 ppm, respectively, whereas the upfield tailing of peaks is due to the distribution of quadrupolar couplings, typical for disordered structures (Figure 2a). (36,37) Note that the 27Al NMR spectrum of the reference bulk-ZnAl2O4 features a peak at ca. 10 ppm due to the AlVI sites and no other notable downfield peak (Figure 2a); that is, no AlIV sites are present. Despite ongoing debate regarding the γ-Al2O3 structure, (38) it contains, by experimental and computational studies, AlVI and AlIV sites, the former represents ca. 70 ± 2% of all Al sites. (39) We observe peaks owing to AlIV and AlVI sites in γ-Al2O3 at ca. 64 and 8 ppm, respectively, with no discernible contribution from AlV sites; the AlIV/ AlIV+VI peak ratio is ca. 0.285 (Figure S7). 27Al NMR spectra of ZnO/Al2O3 materials also contain peaks due to AlIV and AlVI sites but with relative intensities that are different from γ-Al2O3 (Figure 2a). With an increasing number of ALD cycles, the intensity of the AlIV peak at ca. 64 ppm decreases, in line with the substitution of AlIV sites by ZnIV sites in the spinel lattice, forming ZnAl2O4. This is reflected in a change in the AlIV/AlIV+VI peak area ratio that decreases from 0.283 to 0.280 and to 0.275 in 10, 30, and 50ZnO/Al2O3, respectively (Figure S7). If we assume that all zinc occupies only AlIV sites and Al takes both AlIV and AlVI sites in γ-Al2O3, the expected values for the AlIV/AlIV+VI peak ratio would be 0.278, 0.271, and 0.265 for 10, 30, and 50ZnO/Al2O3, respectively. The slight discrepancy between the experimentally and theoretically determined ratios might be explained by the error arising from the NMR peak fitting (Figure S7).

Inset in panel b shows the XANES patterns of the two references bulk-ZnAl2O4 and wurtzite ZnO. All measurements are conducted under atmospheric conditions. For 27Al MAS NMR, 15–18 kHz spinning rates were used; side bands are marked by asterisks, and all spectra are normalized to the peak maximum at ca. 8 ppm (AlVI sites).
For ZnxAlyO4 NPs, we also observed two peaks due to AlIV and AlVI sites. The intensity of the 27Al NMR peak due to AlIV sites (ca. 64 ppm) decreases with increasing Zn/Al ratio (Figure 2a). The ratio AlIV/AlIV+VI was determined to decrease with increasing Zn content, as 0.32, 0.27, and 0.17 for Zn0.06Al2.63O4, Zn0.15Al2.56O4, and Zn0.42Al2.39O4 NPs, respectively (Figure S8).
The local structure of the Zn sites was investigated using Zn K-edge XANES and EXAFS analyses. The Zn K-edge XANES spectra of the ZnO/Al2O3 materials are shown in Figure 2b. Five distinct features centered at ca. 9665, 9670, 9674, 9681, and 9688 eV, labeled as A–E, can be distinguished (Figure 2b). These features agree well with the XANES spectrum of the reference bulk-ZnAl2O4 (see also Figure S9), whereas the reference wurtzite ZnO exhibits a broad XANES feature centered at 9670 eV (Figure 2b, inset). While zinc is in a tetrahedral coordination in both wurtzite ZnO and spinel bulk-ZnAl2O4, the clear differences in the corresponding XANES features evidence the different local environments of zinc in these two structures (spinel aluminate and wurtzite, inset in Figure 2b). (40)
The Fourier transformed (FT) EXAFS data of ZnO/Al2O3 materials show a first coordination shell that is attributed to Zn–O and a second coordination shell which contains Zn–Al/Zn–Zn subshells (Figure 2c). Note that the amplitude of the second peak decreases with the number of ZnO ALD cycles, being in all cases lower than that in the bulk-ZnAl2O4. A quantitative description of the local environment is obtained by EXAFS fittings (Table S1). The fittings show a Zn–O coordination sphere at ca. 1.95 Å, with a coordination number (CN) that is similar (within standard deviation of the method) and close to 4 (3.5–3.9) in the three ZnO/Al2O3 materials. The second coordination sphere consists mainly of Zn–Al and Zn–Zn shells at distances of ca. 3.37–3.38 Å. Upon increasing the number of ALD cycles from 10 to 30 and 50, the CN for the Zn–Zn sphere increases from 3(1) to 4(1) while the CN for Zn–Al decreases significantly, i.e., from 7(2) to 5(1) and further to 4(1) (Table S1). A plausible explanation for this observed increase in CN as Zn content decreases, notably in 10ZnO/Al2O3, is that a larger portion of Zn atoms is found in the bulk or subsurface layers in 10ZnO/Al2O3 relative to 30 and 50ZnO/Al2O3 because of a deeper diffusion of Zn (Zn atoms at the surface are less coordinated than in the bulk).
The thermally driven phase transformation in 50ZnO/Al2O3 during calcination was followed by an in situ XRD-XAS experiment (50–790 °C, in air-flow, Figure S10). (26,41) Initially, the XANES spectrum of the as-prepared 50ZnO/Al2O3 showed distinct features due to ZnO (feature B at 9670 eV), in line with XRD data. Upon heating, the intensity of feature B decreases continuously while features A and C grow, indicating the gradual formation of ZnAl2O4 (Figure S10). Linear combination fitting analysis shows that the transformation begins at 400 °C and proceeds continuously with time and temperature (Figure S10). However, in the in situ cell we did not observe the full conversion of ZnO into ZnAl2O4 within the temperature range and time duration studied, very likely because of differences in the heat transfer between the laboratory furnace and the in situ cell in combination with a limited calcination time. In situ XRD data shows the appearance of Bragg peaks due to ZnAl2O4 for T > 700 °C, which grow in intensity while the magnitude of the ZnO peaks decreases, in line with XANES analysis. Overall, the combined in situ XRD-XAS experiments confirm the transformation of the ZnO shell (on γ-Al2O3) into a ZnAl2O4 shell (on a γ-Al2O3 core).
The XANES spectra of ZnxAlyO4 NPs show similar features as the reference bulk-ZnAl2O4, with the A and C features in the XANES spectra of ZnxAlyO4 NPs increasing with a decreasing Zn/Al ratio (Figure 2b), possibly due to subtle difference in the local environment of Zn (i.e., richer in Al with decreasing the Zn/Al ratio). The FT-EXAFS data are shown in Figure 2c, and the fitting results are presented in Table S1. The Zn–O, Zn–Al, and Zn–Zn spheres are located at ca. 1.95, 3.34, and 3.52 Å, respectively (i.e., similar distances as the ones observed for the ZnO/Al2O3 materials). The CN for Zn–O is largely unaffected by changes in the ratio Zn:Al in the ZnxAlyO4 NPs and vary in the range of 3.5–3.9, consistent with Zn occupying ZnIV sites independent of the Zn/Al ratio (Table S1). Only a slight variation in the CN number for the second coordination sphere was observed with varying Zn content. The CNs for Zn–Al are between 5(1) and 6(1), whereas the CN for Zn–Zn increases from 2(1) to 3(1) and remains constant at 3(1) for Zn0.06Al2.63O4, Zn0.15Al2.56O4, and Zn0.42Al2.39O4 NPs, respectively.
The XANES spectrum of 30ZnO/SiO2 is very similar to that of the reference wurtzite ZnO, with Zn sites in Td coordination (Figure S5), in line with XRD data. Furthermore, the presence of the second coordination shell (Zn–Zn) in the EXAFS data of 30ZnO/SiO2 (Figure S5) is consistent with the formation of a supported ZnO phase (Figure S5). The intensity of the first coordination shell (Zn–O) in 30ZnO/SiO2 is similar to that of the ZnO reference (Figure S5).
PDH Catalytic Performance
Initial Catalytic Activity
All catalysts as well as the bare supports were tested for PDH in a plug-flow reactor at 600 °C using 10 mol % C3H8 in N2 (WHSV = 22.7 g C3H8 gcat–1 h–1). Figure 3a plots the initial activities expressed as space-time yields (STY, mmol C3H6 gcat–1 h–1) and product selectivities for the studied materials (see also Table S2 for detailed catalytic results showing product distribution in molar fraction). While C3H6 is the main product of the PDH reaction, C2H6, CH4, and C2H4 were also observed as byproducts. (4) The highest initial STY and selectivity were observed for 50ZnO/Al2O3 and Zn0.15Al2.56O4-NPs (Figure 3a).
Figure 3
Figure 3. (a) Initial space-time yields of the studied materials. (b) Propene selectivity and STY data during 270 min TOS including two regeneration cycles after 90 min for selected catalysts. A total flow of 21 mL min–1, 10 mol % C3H8 in N2, at 600 °C and synthetic air at 650 °C was used for reaction and regeneration, respectively.
30ZnO/SiO2 showed a poor catalytic activity (4.4 mmol C3H6 gcat–1 h–1) and a low C3H6 selectivity (58%), i.e., values that are comparable to those of the bare SiO2 support (Figures 3 and S11). These results are in line with previous studies showing that wurtzite ZnO containing ZnIV–O–ZnIV linkages exhibits a poor activity for PDH. (21,42)
The activity and selectivity of the ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts increased with increasing Zn content, i.e., with increasing content of the ZnAl2O4 phase (Figures 3a and S12). The initial STY and propene selectivity decreased as follows: 50/ZnOAl2O3 > 30ZnO/Al2O3 > 10ZnO/Al2O3 (entries 1–3, Table 3). These results show that the spinel ZnAl2O4 phase formed on top of a γ-Al2O3 core, as revealed by XRD and XAS analysis, catalyzes the PDH reaction. For instance, we observed similar propene selectivity of 68% at a propane conversion of 9.5% for both 50ZnO/Al2O3 and 30ZnO/Al2O3, an indication of similar active sites in both catalysts. Spinel ZnAl2O4 contains ZnIV–O–AlVI/IV linkages, which are presumably the active sites for PDH reaction in zinc aluminate catalysts. Thus, a dissolution of poorly active ZnO into γ-Al2O3 forms ZnAl2O4 with tetrahedral Zn2+ sites in close proximity to Al sites, leading to an increased activity and selectivity in PDH relative to the 30ZnO/SiO2 reference.

The specific activity, defined as mol C3H6 (mol Zn h)−1 (see the Supporting Information for details), calculated based on the ICP-AES-determined amount of zinc, also shows an increasing specific activity rate with an increasing number of ALD cycles: 50ZnO/Al2O3 > 30ZnO/Al2O3 > 10ZnO/Al2O3 (entries 1–3 in Table 3). The low specific activity of 10ZnO/Al2O3 can be explained by the deeper diffusion of Zn into the inner layers of alumina, as suggested by EXAFS analysis, which decreases the density of active surface sites for the PDH reaction.
In the case of ZnxAlyO4-NPs, the highest space-time yield and propene selectivity were observed for Zn0.15Al2.56O4-NPs (Table 3 entry 4 and Figure S13), while all of the three studied NP compositions showed higher selectivities and activities than 30ZnO/SiO2 and the bare supports. Zn0.42Al2.39O4-NPs show a higher conversion when compared to Zn0.15Al2.56O4-NPs, yet the latter was more selective toward propene (Figure S13). Thus, zinc aluminate solid solutions containing ZnIV–O–AlVI/IV sites are catalytically active for PDH, while Zn0.15Al2.56O4 (among the materials tested in this work) contains an optimal ratio of ZnIV, AlIV, and AlVI sites. In addition, the lower specific activity (mol C3H6 (molZn h)−1, Figure S14) of Zn0.15Al2.56O4-NPs (solid solution) relative to 50ZnO/Al2O3 (core–shell microstructure) is explained by a higher density of ZnIV–O–AlVI/IV linkages on the surface of 50ZnO/Al2O3.
Catalytic Performance with TOS
Next, we compare the catalytic performance during TOS for the materials that showed the highest initial activity, i.e., 50ZnO/Al2O3 and Zn0.15Al2.56O4 NPs (Figure 3b). A regeneration step (20 min under a flow of synthetic air at 650 °C followed by 10 min of purging with N2) was introduced after 90 min of the PDH reaction. In the first PDH cycle, both Zn0.15Al2.56O4-NPs and 50ZnO/Al2O3 deactivate with TOS. Notably, the deactivation rate (defined as deactivation rate = 1 – STY at 90 min/STY at 3 min ×100) (18) of the Zn0.15Al2.56O4 NPs is lower than that of ALD 50ZnO/Al2O3, determined as 34% and 52%, respectively (Table S3 and Figure 3b). In ZnO/SiO2, no changes were observed by TOS with respect to its catalytic activity, which was similar to that of bare SiO2 (Figures 3b and S11).
Each regeneration cycle largely restores the initial STY of Zn0.15Al2.56O4 NPs (92% and 90% in the second and third cycles, respectively). In contrast, for 50ZnO/Al2O3 a decrease in the initial catalytic activity after each regeneration cycle was observed (65% and 57% of the initial catalytic activity in the second and third cycles, respectively; Figures 3b and S12), leading to an almost complete deactivation of the catalyst in the third cycle. Thus, the limited regenerability of 50ZnO/Al2O3 by air indicates that coke formation is not the only mechanism responsible for the deactivation of the 50ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst with TOS.
Deactivation Routes
The nature of the coke deposited on the used catalysts was characterized by TGA and Raman spectroscopy. Used catalysts were treated under air (30 mL min–1) between room temperature and up to 1000 °C in a TGA, while the weight loss was recorded (Figure S15 and Table S3). More than 96% of the weight loss due to carbon combustion takes place before 650 °C. The amount of the coke formed (after the first cycle of reaction) on the Zn0.15Al2.56O4 NPs was higher than that on 50ZnO/Al2O3 according to TGA data; the respective weight losses were 5.1% versus 1.9% while the amount of the coke formed per surface area of the catalyst was similar and equal to 0.25 and 0.20 mg m–2, respectively (Figure S16 and Table S3). Thus, the amount of coke formed does not correlate with the observed deactivation rates. (2,11) Raman spectra of the spent catalysts after the first and third cycles (Figures S17 and S18 and Table S3) show two distinct Raman bands at ca. 1341 and 1600 cm–1, assigned to the D and G bands of carbon; (43) the lower-intensity peaks at higher wavenumbers (ca. 2920 and 3200 cm–1) might be due to the D bands of graphite. (44,45) The ratio between intensities of the D and G bands (ID/IG) can be used to estimate the degree of crystallinity of the carbon deposited, as the D band arises from disordered carbon (e.g., amorphous carbon) while the G band is due to the stretching mode of the sp2 bonds in ordered graphite. (46−48) After the first PDH reaction cycle (TOS = 90 min) the ID/IG ratio of the Zn0.15Al2.56O4 NPs was higher compared to 50ZnO/Al2O3, i.e., 1.6 versus 0.9, respectively, indicative of the formation of a more amorphous carbon on the Zn0.15Al2.56O4 NPs. A similar trend was observed after 270 min of PDH reaction (third cycle); the ID/IG ratio was 2.8 versus 2.1 for Zn0.15Al2.56O4 NPs and 50ZnO/Al2O3, respectively (Figures S17 and S18 and Table S3).
Because the 50ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst could not be fully regenerated via air treatment, a second (irreversible) deactivation mechanism is at play. We considered three hypotheses: (i) reduction and/or (ii) volatilization of Zn2+ sites and (iii) diffusion of the zinc sites to the inner layers of the alumina support. All mechanisms can decrease the amount of available active Zn sites for the PDH reaction and result in deactivation (it is worth mentioning that the observed activity and selectivity is a combination of nonselective thermal cracking and selective PDH; therefore, any blocking of active PDH sites will decrease both activity and selectivity). To assess the validity of the first hypothesis, we probed changes in the oxidation state of Zn in 50ZnO/Al2O3 during PDH using in situ XAS (Figure S19). Interestingly, no appreciable changes in the XANES spectra during the PDH reaction were observed (constant edge jump). The small variations observed during reaction are within statistical errors. This result rules out the reduction of zinc as a deactivation mechanism in this catalyst. For the second hypothesis, ICP-AES results of the used catalysts do not show a significant change in the zinc content of the samples before and after PDH reaction (270 min TOS including two regeneration cycles every 90 min, Table S4), thus ruling out the volatilization as a deactivation mechanism.
Next, to probe possible structural transformation during PDH we analyzed the XRD patterns and XAS spectra (ex situ) of 50ZnO/Al2O3 before and after 3 PDH reaction–regeneration cycles (50ZnO/Al2O3(rxn)). XRD and XANES data showed subtle changes (in Figure S20 a small shift in peaks position can be observed in the XRD data) while a more noticeable change was detected in the EXAFS data of 50ZnO/Al2O3(rxn) as compared with 50ZnO/Al2O3, suggesting a change in the local environment of Zn upon reaction–regeneration cycles. Figure 4a–d shows the Fourier transform (FT) and wavelet transform (WT) of the EXAFS function of 50ZnO/Al2O3 and 50ZnO/Al2O3(rxn). WT analysis of the EXAFS data can resolve contributions of different backscattering atoms that are at similar distances to the scattering atom. (15,49) There is a clear increase in the peak intensity of the second coordination shell in 50ZnO/Al2O3(rxn) that is attributed to Zn–Al (the amplitude of the second coordination sphere in the FT of 50ZnO/Al2O3(rxn) becomes similar to that of poorly active 10ZnO/Al2O3, Figures S21 and S22). The fitting of the EXAFS shows an increase in the coordination number (CN) of Zn–Al after reaction (from 4(1) to 6(1), Table S1) while the Zn–Zn coordination number remains almost constant; that is, it changed from 2.1 to 2.3 (Table S1). A similar behavior was observed for 30ZnO/Al2O3 and 30ZnO/Al2O3(rxn) (Table S1 and Figures S23 and S24). As the atoms at the surface of the nanoparticles are less coordinated than in the bulk, such a decrease in the CN could be linked to the diffusion of zinc from the surface to the inner layers of γ-Al2O3 (schematic in Figure 4e,f), leading to a surface that is depleted in Zn, thus reducing the number of available active sites for the PDH reaction. The fact that changes in the XRD are less detectable indicates that the restructuring involves Zn surface atoms diffusing to the subsurface of the particles rather than a bulk transformation. In contrast, we did not observe a notable change in the EXAFS data of Zn0.15Al2.56O4 before and after the reaction (Figure S25), likely because Zn in this catalyst is distributed homogeneously across the bulk (and the surface) of nanoparticles already in the calcined sate, as shown by STEM-EDX.

The used catalyst denoted by subscript (rxn) has been studied after 270 min TOS (600 °C, 10 mol % C3H8 in N2) including two regeneration cycles (21 mL min–1 air at 650 °C) after 90 min of TOS. All data are collected under ambient conditions. Oxygen, aluminum, and zinc atoms are represented in red, blue, and gray, respectively.
Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Model catalysts were synthesized using ALD deposition of ZnO on γ-Al2O3 and Aerosil silica to investigate the active phase and deactivation pathways of Zn/Al2O3-based PDH catalysts. Calcination of ZnO/Al2O3 forms ZnAl2O4 layers on the γ-Al2O3 support, leading to a core–shell structure. While 30ZnO/SiO2 was inactive, the higher (still moderate) catalytic activity and selectivity observed for 50ZnO/Al2O3 can be attributed to the presence of a spinel ZnAl2O4 phase. Nanoparticles of zinc aluminate (solid solutions) display initial catalytic activities (8 mmol C3H6 gcat–1 h–1) similar to that of ALD-made ZnO/Al2O3 materials (9 mmol C3H6 gcat–1 h–1). The catalytic activity of the catalysts developed in this work is moderate when compared to Pt-based catalysts. (50) Our results show that zinc aluminate spinel, usually considered as an unreactive support, contains ZnIV–O–AlVI/IV linkages that enable the dehydrogenation of propane (demonstrated at 600 °C). However, we have also identified deactivation routes of the ZnO/Al3O3 system. We propose, based on a combination of spectroscopic techniques, that besides coke formation, the diffusion of surface zinc into the inner layers of the alumina is an additional deactivation route for ZnO/Al2O3 catalysts during the PDH reaction. Yet, the deactivation mechanism of Zn diffusion is less probable in homogeneous solid solution catalyst. This study shows how a combination of characterization techniques that assesses the average and local structure can provide detailed information on the processes that occur at the atomic level during catalysts activation (calcination) and deactivation.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
