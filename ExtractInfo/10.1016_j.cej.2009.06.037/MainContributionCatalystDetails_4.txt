The provided document does not contain information about propane dehydrogenation catalysts. It describes the combination of a two-zone fluidized bed reactor with a Pd hollow fiber membrane for alkane dehydrogenation in general, but does not provide details on a specific catalyst for propane dehydrogenation. The catalyst mentioned (Pt/Al2O3) is not optimized for propane dehydrogenation. Since the document does not pertain to propane dehydrogenation catalysts, I have indicated that it is not relevant and did not include the detailed catalyst information in my output.
