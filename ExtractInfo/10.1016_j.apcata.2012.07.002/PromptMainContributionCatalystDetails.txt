Metathesis of C4 olefin over Mo-based heterogeneous catalysts: A novel route to propene and isopentene
Abstract
A novel route with high yields of propene and isopentene on the basis of consecutive metathesis of 1-butene and isobutene is proposed. Two series of Mo-based catalysts supported on γ-Al2O3 and HMOR-Al2O3 composite materials were prepared and evaluated in a fixed bed reactor. Experimental results revealed that three interesting reactions occurred on the catalysts, i.e. 1-C4= → 2-C4= (Isomerization I), 2-C4= + 1-C4= → C3= + 2-C5= (Metathesis I), 2-C4= + i-C4= → C3= + i-C5= (Metathesis II). Isomerization I was the prerequisite step of the following two metathesis reactions. Metathesis I was more acidity-sensitive and it could happen at low temperatures provided that the catalyst acidity was sufficient. Metathesis II, as the targeted reaction, was proved to be more temperature-sensitive, and high reaction temperatures were preferable for the metathesis of 2-butene and isobutene. 6Mo/Al2O3 exhibited the best catalytic metathesis performance among the candidate catalysts in the consecutive metathesis of 1-butene and isobutene. Furthermore, isopentene selectivity could be highly enhanced through the steam treatment of γ-Al2O3 support. The modifications of alumina support led to the different distribution of Mo species and the formation of more Mo species in octahedral state may contribute to the preferential activation of Metathesis II.

1. Introduction
Propene is an important industrial chemical intermediate that serves as one of the building blocks for an array of chemical and plastic products. The demand for propene is growing rapidly in worldwide chemistry and new processes with high yield of propene are urgently required. Several on-purpose propene production technologies, including propane dehydrogenation [1], [2], catalytic cracking of C4+ olefins [3], [4] and methanol to olefin process [5], are available. In addition, another promising technology is olefin metathesis reaction [6], [7], of which the C4 olefin feed could be 1-butene or 2-butene.
Olefin metathesis is a powerful carbon skeleton rearrangement reaction in which the unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds can be redistributed in the presence of catalysts [8]. Since its discovery in 1964, much effort has been devoted to the design of homogeneous organic catalysts [9], [10]. Heterogeneous catalysts, due to their virtue of easy separation, good persistence and recyclability, are of particular interest for both academic and industrial researchers. Among them, molybdenum oxide supported on alumina [11], [12], siliceous materials [13], silica–alumina [14], [15], [16] and zeolite–alumina composite supports [17], [18] have received great interest because of their relatively low price and high activity under mild reaction conditions.
So far, several olefin metathesis reaction routes have been developed to increase the propene output, such as cross-metathesis of ethene and 2-butene [6], [7], [19], auto-metathesis of 1-butene [17], [20], [21], [22] and metathesis of 2-butene [23]. The above-mentioned processes either consume valuable ethene source or require the separation of C4 olefin streams. New metathesis pathways based on the direct utilization of mixed C4 olefin stream would be more popular for the production of value-added propene. C4 olefin stream is usually the by-product of steam cracker and FCC units. Among them, isobutene component could be further manufactured as the additive of gasoline or polymer materials, while much of the other components in the C4 olefin are used as fuel in China. Metathesis of 2-butene (1-butene) and isobutene provides an alternative way to produce propene and isopentene. It could make full use of the surplus C4 olefin stream directly without further separation, and provide an alternative route for isobutene utilization. On the other hand, isopentene is obtained simultaneously with propene which is also an important intermediate in petrochemical industry and could be used to produce tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME) and isoprene. Generally, isopentene and isoprene are obtained from the C5 fractions of the effluent of steaming cracking units [24]. However, this route is complicated by the presence of the solvent extraction process and the availability of isopentene is very limited. Thus, it would be of great significance to develop a metathesis process with high selectivities to propene and isopentene from C4 olefin stream.
In this work, we disclosed a process for producing propene and isopentene from the metathesis reaction of 1-butene with isobutene. During the process over Mo-based bi-functional catalysts, 1-butene was first isomerized to 2-butene, followed by a cross-metathesis of 2-butene and isobutene resulting in the formation of propene and isopentene. For simplicity, we defined the above two reactions as the consecutive metathesis of 1-butene and isobutene, which was different from the cross-metathesis of 1-butene and isobutene. Up to now, few reports dealt with academic problems concerning the gas-phase consecutive metathesis, although some patents disclosed the design of the total process flow [25], [26], [27], [28]. It is well known that catalyst acidity is responsible for 1-butene double bond isomerization reaction [29], and active metal-alkylidene centers are necessary for the activation of 2-butene metathesis with isobutene [30]. Due to the complicated interaction effects among miscellaneous olefin reactions over different active centers on the catalysts, reasonable matching of surface acidity and active Mo centers becomes a critical issue. Consequently, the major objective of present study was to screen one catalyst suitable for the isomerization and metathesis reactions. In fact, much attention was devoted to the factors that influenced the product distribution in this consecutive metathesis reaction.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts preparation
The H-type mordenite and γ-Al2O3 composite supports were prepared by extruding a mixture of γ-Al2O3 and H-type mordenite zeolite (Si/Al = 10 provided by Fushun Petroleum Company, China) into strips with a diameter of about 2 mm. The supports designed as HM–xAl were calcined at 520 °C for 2 h, and ground into 20–40 meshes. Catalysts containing ca. 6.0 wt% Mo were prepared by incipient wetness impregnation of HM–xAl supports with an aqueous solution of (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, then dried at 120 °C, and finally calcined at 600 °C for 2 h. The catalysts were denoted as 6Mo/HM–xAl, where x (%) stood for the weight percent of γ-Al2O3 in the support. Mo-based catalysts supported on Hβ–30Al and SiO2 were prepared following the same procedure.
Steam treatment modifications were carried out in a quartz tube reactor heated with an electric furnace. Usually, samples were heated to 600 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, and then maintained at this temperature for 2 h under pure steam with a flow rate of 65 g/h. 6Mo/Al-CST600 sample meant that the 6Mo/Al2O3 catalyst experienced direct steam treatment at 600 °C, while the catalyst prepared from steam treated γ-Al2O3 support before impregnation was denoted as 6Mo/Al-SST600.
2.2. Catalysts characterization
Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) experiments were carried out in a quartz micro-reactor (i.d. 4 mm) which was connected to an on line gas chromatograph (Shimadzu GC-8A) equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The TCD response was calibrated by doses containing known amounts of NH3. In a typical experiment, the sample (100 mg) was firstly pretreated at 600 °C for 0.5 h under continuous He flow (25 ml/min) to remove any adsorbed moisture, then cooled to 150 °C and saturated with NH3. Subsequently, NH3 in physical adsorption and gas phase was purged in He flow for a certain period at 150 °C until a stable baseline was obtained. NH3-TPD experiment was then carried out in the range of 150–600 °C at a heating rate of 19.6 °C/min.
N2-physisorption experiments were performed at −196 °C on a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 instrument. Prior to analysis, the samples were outgassed at 350 °C under the vacuum of 10−3 Pa for 8 h. Specific surface area was calculated by the standard multipoint BET method with P/Po range of 0.05–0.30, and the pore volume was determined by N2 adsorption at a relative pressure of 0.995.
Temperature-programmed reduction of H2 (H2-TPR) experiments were carried out in a conventional setup similar to NH3-TPD. Prior to analysis, the sample (100 mg) was pretreated at 550 °C for 1 h under Ar flow to remove water and other contaminants. Then the reduction step was carried out in a mixture flow of 10% H2–90% Ar from 100 °C to 900 °C at a heating rate of 14 °C/min. The H2 signal was monitored on line by a TCD and the actual H2 consumption of each catalyst was obtained from the peak area calibrated by the complete reduction of high-purity Ag2O as standard. The reduction degree was obtained by the ratio of actual H2 consumption to the hypothetical H2 consumption corresponding to the complete reduction of the catalyst (i.e. from Mo6+ to Mo0).
The Mo contents of all the samples were analyzed using a PANalytical Axios X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF).
2.3. Catalysts evaluation
The catalytic test was carried out in a fixed bed flow microreactor with an inner diameter of 7 mm. The reaction temperature was measured with a coaxial thermocouple, the end of which was fixed in the middle of the catalyst bed. The composition of the feed gases was as follows: 1-butene 56.5 wt%, isobutene 38.2 wt% and butane 5.3 wt%. The mole ratio of 1-butene to isobutene was 1.5. Due to the high purity of the reactant feed, no further deoxygenation or drying treatment was done before use. In each experiment, 1 g of the catalyst was charged at the center of the reactor, and the catalyst was pretreated in situ at 550 °C with N2 (20 ml/min) for 2 h, then the system was cooled down to the desired reaction temperature under the N2 flow. Afterwards, the olefin mixture flow with the weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 1.5 h−1 was introduced into the reactor. The reaction products were analyzed by an on line Varian CP 3800 gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The connecting lines between the reactor outlet and the sampling valve were heated to prevent the condensation of the products with high molecular weights. Quantitative analyses of the products were calculated by using the corrected area normalization method, and carbonaceous deposits on catalysts were not taken into account for the calculation. For catalytic evaluation at different temperatures, a fresh catalyst was used for each reaction temperature.
The 1-butene isomers, i.e. cis-2-butene and trans-2-butene produced from the isomerization of 1-butene, were considered to be unconverted feedstock. The conversion (X) of 1-butene and isobutene and the selectivity (S) to a particular product were calculated using the following equations [27], [31]:
In the formula, [1-C42−]F and [i-C42−]F represented the weight percent of each component in feed gas; [C22−]p, [C32−]p, [2-C42−]p, [i-C52−]p, [n-C52−]p, and [C6+]p were the weight percent of each component in products, respectively; S(Cn2−) stood for the product selectivity with the carbon number of n. In addition, all the heavy products having six or more carbon atoms were denoted as C6+.
3. Results and discussion
Blank experiment was performed firstly and only 1-butene and isobutene were detected in the effluent below 250 °C. When the catalysts were employed, detected products became complicated and the detailed component analysis was as follows: ethene, propene, isopentene, 1-pentene, 2-pentene, hexene, and C7C12 oligomers. On the basis of the product analysis and previous reports in Refs. [32], [33], possible metathesis reaction network using 1-butene and isobutene as feed was suggested and shown in Scheme 1. It could be seen that five types of reactions happened on the catalyst: Isomerization I, Metathesis (I, II, III, and IV), Self-Metathesis (I, II), Oligomerization (I, II, and III), and Cracking (I, II). Due to the existence of Metathesis I, isopentene content in the pentene fraction, expressed as n(i-C52−)/n(C52−), was calculated as an indicator to reflect the reaction selectivity of Metathesis II in the two competitive Metathesis reactions (I, II) [27].

Scheme 1. Possible reaction pathways in the consecutive metathesis reaction of 1-butene and isobutene over Mo-based heterogeneous catalysts.
3.1. Catalytic performances of catalysts with Mo species supported on different supports
Mo/Hβ–Al2O3 [7], [18], Mo/HMOR-Al2O3 [17], [34] and Mo/Al2O3 [35] have been proved good catalysts in different light olefin metathesis reaction systems. Thus, they were firstly evaluated in the consecutive metathesis of 1-butene and isobutene. The detailed catalytic results under different reaction conditions were compared and summarized in Table 1. Remarkable differences in feed conversion and product selectivity could be observed depending on the supports and reaction temperatures. For the 6Mo/HM–30Al catalyst, propene and n-pentene selectivities were high in the metathesis products at 150 °C, indicating the good catalytic performance for the 1-butene auto-metathesis reaction (i.e. 1-butene first isomerized to 2-butene, followed by the cross-metathesis of 2-butene and 1-butene). This was in accordance with the previous reports in which 6Mo/HM–30Al exhibited an excellent performance in the auto-metathesis of 1-butene [34]. However, the selectivity to isopentene was relatively low. Meanwhile, the selectivity to C6+ was high to 58.1% suggesting that severe Oligomerization (I, II, and III), as shown in Scheme 1, happened on the catalyst due to the introduction of isobutene in the feed. It could be concluded that 6Mo/HM–30Al was not a good candidate catalyst for the consecutive metathesis of 1-butene and isobutene at 150 °C. Even when the reaction temperature was increased to 250 °C, it did not show improved catalytic performance. 1-Butene and isobutene conversions decreased. Propene and n-pentene selectivities decreased significantly, and more side C6+ products, which amounted to 85.1%, appeared in the effluent. While, it was interesting that the isopentene selectivity increased with reaction temperature. Similar phenomena were observed on the 6Mo/Hβ–30Al catalyst. Although it exhibited good catalytic performance in the cross-metathesis of ethene and 2-butene [7], low selectivities to the consecutive metathesis products were obtained and most of the 1-butene and isobutene converted to side products.

In the case of the 6Mo/Al2O3 catalyst, high 1-butene and isobutene conversions were observed at 150 °C (Table 1). In the product distribution, both ethene and C6+ contents were high indicating that 1-butene Self-Metathesis I, as shown in Scheme 1, predominated in the metathesis reaction network. When the reaction temperature was increased to 200 °C, propene and n-pentene selectivities increased simultaneously at the expense of low ethene and C6+. It should be pointed out that the isopentene selectivity increased continuously upon the reaction temperature and it achieved 44.2% at 350 °C, although 1-butene and isobutene conversions were only 2.2% and 6.3%, respectively. Taking into account both yields and selectivities of the desired products, optimal reaction temperature was around 250 °C for the 6Mo/Al2O3 catalyst. 6Mo/SiO2 catalyst was also evaluated, and it was hardly metathesis active at 250 °C. Due to the weak acidity of the catalyst and weak interactions between Mo species and support, much higher reaction temperature was required to activate the 6Mo/SiO2 in the metathesis of 1-butene and isobutene [36], [37].
In general, the 6Mo/Al2O3 catalyst exhibited the best catalytic performance in the consecutive metathesis of 1-butene and isobutene among the four candidate catalysts, whose isopentene selectivities increased with temperature irrespective of catalyst acidity. Did the isomerization active sites match well with the metathesis active sites on the 6Mo/Al2O3? Whether additional acid sites were needed was still a question. In our previous study, the 6Mo/HM–30Al has been proved an effective catalyst for the 1-butene auto-metathesis reaction, and the catalytic performance was closely related to the γ-Al2O3 contents in the support [34]. Considering that 1-butene was also involved in the consecutive metathesis of 1-butene and isobutene, support type and corresponding acidity would show significant impacts on the metathesis performance. Thus, effects of support composition on the metathesis performances of 6Mo/HM–xAl catalysts were investigated in the following section.
3.2. Catalytic performances of 6Mo/HM–xAl catalysts with different γ-Al2O3 contents
Effects of γ-Al2O3 contents in the 6Mo/HM–xAl catalysts on the consecutive metathesis performances of 1-butene and isobutene were investigated and summarized in Table 2. It could be observed that butene conversion and product selectivity were closely related to the γ-Al2O3 contents in the support. C6+ component accounted for a large proportion in the product distribution. In order to gain a clear idea about the heavy constituents, separate analyses for the C6+ liquid products collected after 7.5 h on stream were performed on a Varian CP 3800 gas chromatograph equipped with a PONA (Paraffins, Olefins, Naphthenes and Aromatics) capillary column. It showed that the weight ratio of C6, C7, C8, C9 and C10+ component was similar over the 6Mo/HM–xAl catalysts irrespective of the remarkable differences in C6+ selectivity. Taking 6Mo/Al2O3 for example, the weight composition was: C6, 0.3%, C7, 6.3%, C8, 54.5%, C9, 10.0%, and C10+, 28.9%, indicating that C4 olefin dimerization products occupied almost half portion of the C6+ component.

Determined by quantitative analysis of NH3-TPD profiles.
As shown in Table 2, the initial 1-butene conversions on 6Mo/HM–xAl catalysts were lower than those of isobutene with the exception of 6Mo/Al2O3. 1-Butene conversion gradually increased upon the γ-Al2O3 content in the support, which was quite different from the 1-butene auto-metathesis reaction system [34]. Product selectivities to propene, isopentene and n-pentene also increased upon the γ-Al2O3 content. This was not the same case for C6+ which decreased from 95.6% (6Mo/HM) to 25.1% (6Mo/Al2O3) at 1 h on stream. These results indicated that addition of γ-Al2O3 to the support could promote the reaction activities of Metathesis I and II. Meanwhile, olefin Oligomerization (I, II, and III) side reactions were greatly suppressed due to the decreasing acidity of the catalysts. This could be convinced by the NH3-TPD quantitative analysis results presented in Table 2. The total number of acid sites on Mo/HM–xAl catalysts decreased upon γ-Al2O3 contents in the support except for Mo/HM which was due to the strong interaction between pure H-type mordenite and Mo oxide species [34]. It is well known that the metathesis performances of Mo-based catalysts are influenced by the nature of supports, and higher metathesis performances of catalysts supported on silica–alumina system are obtained than that supported on silica or alumina [11], [38], [39]. This superior performance has been ascribed to the higher acidity of supports, and this may increase the reducibility of Mo species, which was favorable for the formation of active metathesis Mo-alkylidene centers. In addition, the local electronic properties of the support, such as the presence of SiOAl bridging hydroxyl groups, could also influence the metathesis activity of the Mo sites. Obviously, this rule was not suitable for the consecutive metathesis of 1-butene and isobutene. One important reason was that severe olefin Oligomerization (I, II, and III) reactions predominantly occurred on the surfaces of the catalysts. Compared with 1-butene molecule, isobutene was more reactive on the acid sites. As a result of the high acid site density on 6Mo/HM–xAl catalysts, amounts of olefin oligomers and carbonaceous deposits were generated at the preliminary stage. The carbonaceous deposits may gradually accumulate on the acid sites and active Mo species, and led to the inaccessibility of these active sites to the reactant mixture and other relevant reaction intermediates [40], [41].
It was found that ethene and hexene selectivities were very low on all the catalysts, indicating that the activities of Self-Metathesis I, II and Metathesis III were poor under the reaction conditions. This was different from the 1-butene auto-metathesis system in which relatively high selectivities to ethene and hexene were observed on the 6Mo/HM–30Al catalyst [34]. The reasonable explanation was that high reaction temperature benefited the 1-butene double bond isomerization. As a result, most of 1-butene isomerized to 2-butene (n(2-C42−)/n(1-C42−) ranged from 4.6 to 5.3 in the effluent as shown in Table 2), leading to the poor Self-Metathesis I [42]. Isobutene is a branched molecule with strong steric hindrance. Considering that the number of active sites is in the order of 1% of the total number of the Mo atoms [43], it was difficult for such a bulky molecule to contact with each other on the Mo-alkylidene centers. These factors led to the low product selectivities to ethene and hexene.
The mole ratio of propene and pentene in the products on the 6Mo/HM–xAl catalysts, denoted as n(C32−)/n(C52−), was calculated and listed in Table 2. The values of n(C32−)/n(C52−) were between 0.7 and 1.0. If propene and pentene were mainly produced through Metathesis I and II, the stoichiometric value for n(C32−)/n(C52−) should be 1.0. While the existence of propene oligomerization and oligomers Cracking (I, II, and III) may lead to the deviations from 1.0. Furthermore, in the case of the 1-butene auto-metathesis reaction system, the value of n(C32−)/n(C52−) was above 1.0 as reported in Refs. [17], [22] although two different catalysts were employed. This was due to the occurrence of the secondary cross-metathesis between ethene and 2-butene, which was also verified by the lower mole content of ethene than that of hexene. As discussed above, ethene selectivity was low in our consecutive metathesis reaction, thus the further cross-metathesis reaction of ethene and 2-butene could hardly happen on the 6Mo/HM–xAl catalysts.
Propene and isopentene produced via Metathesis II were the desired products. When γ-Al2O3 contents in HM–xAl were below 30%, isopentene selectivities decreased with time on stream. As the γ-Al2O3 contents in the support were higher than 50%, isopentene selectivities began to increase. Despite the changes in the supports, n-pentene selectivities continuously decreased upon reaction time. It could be inferred that Metathesis I and II were separately activated on the same catalyst. Banks and Regier also found that the addition of 1-butene to the feed of 2-butene and isobutene adversely affected the isopentene content in the pentene fraction, due to the production of n-pentene by the metathesis of 1-butene and 2-butene [44]. Isopentene content in pentene fraction was also an important catalyst performance indicator. To get a clear idea of the relationship between Metathesis I and II, n(i-C52−)/n(C52−) ratios were analyzed and listed in Fig. 1. It was found that the value increased with time on stream, and this tendency became much more remarkable upon the γ-Al2O3 contents in the supports except for 6Mo/HM. Especially, the n(i-C52−)/n(C52−) ratio was as high as 96.6% on 6Mo/Al2O3 after 7 h on stream. We could tentatively deduce that different active sites were responsible for Metathesis I and II. And the deactivation rate of Metathesis I was faster than that of Metathesis II in the consecutive metathesis of 1-butene and isobutene.

Combined with the results in Table 1, Table 2, it was found that Isomerization I was the prerequisite step of the Metathesis I and II. Isobutene, as a highly active molecule, could oligomerize even at low temperatures, especially on the catalysts with much acidity. The olefin oligomerization reactions could be suppressed through increasing the reaction temperature or choosing a catalyst with suitable acidity. Although Metathesis I and II were two parallel competitive reactions, Metathesis II was more temperature-sensitive, and good catalytic performance was obtained only when the reaction temperature was high enough in the consecutive metathesis of 1-butene and isobutene. Metathesis I was more acidity-sensitive and it could happen even at low temperature (110 °C) provided that the catalyst acidity was high enough [34].
3.3. Structural properties and catalytic performances of 6Mo/Al2O3 catalysts with different steam treatment modifications
From the above discussions it was found that support acidity and reaction temperature were important factors in the consecutive metathesis reaction of 1-butene and isobutene on the 6Mo/HM–xAl catalysts. The 6Mo/Al2O3 sample with appropriate acidity was a more suitable catalyst candidate for this reaction compared with the others supported on HM–xAl. Two parallel competitive Metathesis I and II (i.e. 1-butene and 2-butene VS 2-butene and isobutene) happened on the Mo-based catalysts and some substantial differences may exist between the active metathesis sites although metallacyclobutane was the widely accepted metathesis intermediate [30]. In order to elucidate the active site for the 1-butene and isobutene consecutive metathesis reaction and improve the isopentene content in the pentene fraction, the 6Mo/Al2O3 catalysts with different steam treatment modifications were prepared and evaluated.
Besides the 6Mo/Al2O3, metathesis catalytic performances of 6Mo/Al-SST600 and 6Mo/Al-CST600, which were also pretreated in situ at 550 °C for 2 h under N2 flow, were compared and shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b), the initial conversions (time on stream = 0.3 h) of 1-butene and isobutene on the steam treated samples were lower than those on the 6Mo/Al2O3. And the activity differences gradually diminished upon the reaction time. As far as product selectivity was concerned, little difference was observed for propene and C6+ as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d). However, it was not the same case for isopentene and n-pentene. Interestingly, the isopentene selectivity increased upon the reaction time and it gradually reached a plateau after 5 h on stream. Among them, Mo/Al-SST600 showed enhanced product selectivity to isopentene indicating that steam treatment to the γ-Al2O3 support contributed to the formation of active precursor sites for Metathesis II. Quite opposite phenomena were observed on Mo/Al-CST600. The n-pentene selectivity was the highest and it gradually decreased with time on stream. These results further disclosed that different Mo precursors were needed to activate Metathesis I and II.

Table 3 listed the physico-chemical properties of these samples. According to XRF results, the Mo contents in the three Mo-based catalysts were similar. The BET surface area of the γ-Al2O3 support was 203 m2/g and it decreased to 165 m2/g after experiencing steam treatment at 600 °C. While the average pore diameter increased from 7.5 to 9.0 nm indicating that steam treatment could also change the textural property of the γ-Al2O3. As expected, introduction of Mo species decreased the surface area and pore volume of the support [45], and more surface area loss was observed on 6Mo/Al2O3 than that on 6Mo/Al-SST600, suggesting that the differences in supports led to the different interaction between Mo species and γ-Al2O3 support.

NH3-TPD profiles were obtained to get more information about the acidity changes of the samples before and after modifications. As listed in Table 3, the total number of acid sites on 6Mo/Al-SST600 was the least among the three catalysts. Then were 6Mo/Al-CST600 and 6Mo/Al2O3, respectively. It has been reported that the catalyst acidity was closely related with the metathesis activity of 2-butene and isobutene [31]. Nakamura et al. found that addition of alkali hydroxide to 6Mo/Al2O3 could suppress the dimerization of isobutene through poisoning the acid sites on the catalyst, and an increase in the isopentene yield was achieved. Related the initial feed conversion (Fig. 2(a) and (b)) with the acidity of the samples, the slight decrease in the feed conversion on 6Mo/Al-SST600 and 6Mo/Al-CST600 may be linked with the low acid density of the catalysts. However, an opposite changing trend for the n-pentene and isopentene selectivity was observed on 6Mo/Al-SST600 and 6Mo/Al-CST600 catalysts. Considering the small differences in acidity between the two modified samples, this was not the direct reason leading to obvious differences in product selectivity.
H2-TPR experiments were performed to investigate the reducibility of the catalysts and the interaction between Mo species and supports. As shown in Fig. 3, the TPR profile of 6Mo/Al2O3 exhibited two broad reduction peaks. The low temperature reduction peak was related with the reduction of Mo6+ to Mo4+ in octahedrally coordinated polymeric Mo species dispersed on the γ-Al2O3 surface [46], [47]. The big signal at high temperature contained the contribution of both the further reduction of the octahedral Mo species associated with the first reduction peak and the partial reduction of Mo species in tetrahedrally coordination. After steam treatment, the reduction degree of Mo species on the 6Mo/Al-CST600 sample slightly increased from 54.1% to 56.4%, as shown in Table 3. And the two broad reduction peak intensities increased compared with that of 6Mo/Al2O3, especially for the reduction peak at high temperature region. It seemed that the steam treated support affected the distribution of Mo species and some Mo species became more reducible. In the case of 6Mo/Al-SST600 sample, the situation was a little complicated. The reduction degree increased to 58.0%, and the peak intensity at low reduction temperature increased while that at high temperature decreased compared with 6Mo/Al2O3. In addition, a relatively strong broad signal in the temperature region between 550 and 700 °C was observed as illustrated in Fig. 3. It could be deduced that steam treatment modified the surface structure of the γ-Al2O3 support and led to the different anchoring modes of Mo species. This may be directly linked with the differences in metathesis selectivity.

In heterogeneous metathesis system, the initial metal-alkylidene is formed through the interaction of substrate olefin (1-butene, isobutene or 2-butene) with the transition metal centers [48]. Therefore, the nature of the molybdenum oxide species, which is often strongly influenced by the properties of the support, is one critical parameter to govern the key step for the formation of active metal-alkylidene species. Up to now, various explanations and models concerning the interrelationship between the active metathesis precursors and the location of metal oxides supported on different supports have been proposed [33], [49], [50], [51]. For example, tungsten oxide species in tetrahedral states supported on silica oxide were suggested to be the active sites for the 1-butene auto-metathesis reaction [33]. In our case, steam treatment to the γ-Al2O3 support enlarged the pore diameter and decreased the number of acid sites on γ-Al2O3 support. Therefore more reducible polymeric Mo species were formed after Mo loading, which may contribute to the activation of Metathesis II and high product selectivity to isopentene on 6Mo/Al-SST600. Instead, steam treatment to 6Mo/Al2O3 catalyst led to the redistribution of Mo species on the support and more tetrahedral Mo species were formed. This may be linked with the improved activity of Metathesis I on 6Mo/Al-CST600.
4. Conclusion
Catalytic performances of series of Mo-based catalysts in the consecutive metathesis reaction of 1-butene and isobutene were investigated under various reaction conditions. The 6Mo/Al2O3 catalyst with suitable acidity exhibited the best catalytic performance at 250 °C and 0.1 MPa with 1-butene/isobutene mole ratio of 1.5. In the complicated reaction network, metathesis of 2-butene and isobutene was proved to be more temperature-sensitive, while metathesis of 2-butene and 1-butene was more acidity-sensitive. High propene and isopentene selectivities could be obtained on the 6Mo/Al-SST600 which was prepared through steam treatment to the γ-Al2O3 support before Mo loading. This may be attributed to the different distribution of Mo species on the modified γ-Al2O3 surface which was directly linked with the reducibility of Mo species.
