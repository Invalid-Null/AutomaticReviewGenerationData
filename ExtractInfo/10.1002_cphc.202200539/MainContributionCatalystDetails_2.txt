The given document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation, as it discusses the properties of nickel oxide (NiO) in general without mentioning any specific application to propane conversion. No information is provided about using NiO as a catalyst for converting propane to propylene. Since the document does not pertain to PDH or ODH processes, I have indicated "No" for relevance and did not include any other information. Please provide a document discussing PDH or ODH catalyst advancements to extract the requested details.
