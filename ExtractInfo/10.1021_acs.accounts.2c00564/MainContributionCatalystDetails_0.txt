The provided document does not contain any relevant information about propane dehydrogenation catalysts or processes. It focuses on the synthesis and characterization of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) nanomaterials. While hBN materials have been explored as metal-free catalysts for oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in some studies, this particular document does not discuss their application in propane dehydrogenation specifically.
