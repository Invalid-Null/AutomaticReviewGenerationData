 Based on the details provided in the document, this does not seem to be directly related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses the synthesis of palladium-based intermetallic nanoparticles supported on alumina for applications in selective hydrogenation reactions, not propane dehydrogenation specifically. Therefore, I will output that this is not relevant.
