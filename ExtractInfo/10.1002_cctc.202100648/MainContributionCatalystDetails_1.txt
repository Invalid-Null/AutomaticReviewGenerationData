The given document does not contain information about propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically. It discusses a catalyst for dehydrogenation of propanol, not propane. Propane and propanol are different molecules. Propane (C3H8) is an alkane, while propanol (C3H7OH) is an alcohol. The document talks about dehydrogenation of propanol to propanal, not dehydrogenation of propane to propylene. Therefore, this document is not relevant to propane dehydrogenation.
