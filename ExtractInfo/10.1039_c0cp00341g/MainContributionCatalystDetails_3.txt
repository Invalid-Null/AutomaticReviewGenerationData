The document discusses propane dehydrogenation to propylene over Pt catalysts, but does not mention any specific catalyst that represents a main scientific contribution for enhanced performance. The document mainly provides a theoretical study using DFT calculations to compare propane dehydrogenation on Pt(111) and Pt(211) surfaces. It does not report experimental results for a novel catalyst with improved selectivity, conversion or stability.
