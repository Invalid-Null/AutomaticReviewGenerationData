The document does not discuss propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation specifically for the conversion of propane to propylene. It focuses on DFT calculations to study the reaction mechanism and kinetics of propane dehydrogenation on Pt catalysts in general. While propylene is mentioned as one of the products, the focus is not on improving propylene yield or selectivity.
