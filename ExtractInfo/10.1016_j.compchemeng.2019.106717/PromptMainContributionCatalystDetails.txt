Abstract
Propylene is a very important raw material in the petrochemical industry. A key step in its production is propane/propylene separation, where energy consumption and the degree of propylene recovery achieved have a strong impact on the economy of the process. A Dual PSA process has been designed for the separation of a 50:50 molar propane/propylene mixture using zeolite 13X as adsorbent. Kinetic and equilibrium adsorption parameters reported in the literature (Da Silva, F.A., Rodrigues A.E., 2001. AIChE J. 47, 341–57) have been used. The process can produce polymer-grade propylene (purity > 99.5%) with recovery higher than 99.5%, which is above the recovery achieved in other PSA processes studied in the literature for an equimolar propane/propylene mixture. Energy consumption is 38% lower than required by conventional distillation.

1. Introduction
Propylene is a key feedstock in the petrochemical industry (Li et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2015). Propylene is usually obtained mixed mainly with propane, and its proportion depends on the production process and operation conditions (Moulijn et al., 2001). In the Catofin process (Air Products), propylene with a molar fraction of 40–70% is obtained from a reactor operating at 1 bar and temperatures of 560–660 °C (Eisele and Killpack, 2012).
To obtain polypropylene, propylene purity in the feed must be greater than 99.5% (Cougard et al., 2011). Propylene is purified industrially by distillation (Mauhar et al., 2004). As the relative volatility of the propylene/propane mixture is very close to one (between 1.0 and 1.1), large and costly columns are used, which require a high reflux ratio (Da Silva and Rodrigues, 2001), implying a high energy consumption. For propylene concentrations in the feed between 73% and 84% w/w, the kettle energy consumption is c.a. 3.9 thermal MJ per kg of feed (Cougard et al., 2011; Christopher et al., 2017).
Several potential alternatives to distillation have been proposed to carry out the propane/propylene separation: hybrid adsorption-distillation, adsorption and membranes. Kumar et al. (1992) proposed an adsorption-distillation hybrid scheme for propane/propylene separation. Different adsorbents have been proposed to separate olefins from the homologous alkanes by adsorption. Among zeolites, 4A zeolite (Grande et al., 2003a; Grande et al., 2004, 2006) and 13X zeolite (Da Silva and Rodrigues, 2001; van Miltenburg et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2019) have been the most studied ones. Yang and Kikkinides (1995), Yang et al. (1996) and Padin and Yang (1997) have studied the paraffin/olefin separation based on the ``π-complexation" of propylene with metals dispersed in several supports. Al-Muhtaseb (2008) has used carbon xerogel-based adsorbents prepared with cooper solutions as catalysts showing selectivity to olefins over paraffins. Carbon molecular sieves showing kinetic selectivity to propylene have been studied (Grande et al., 2003b; Liu et al., 2015; SHIRASAGI, 2019). Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have also been proposed for this separation, which can be divided in two groups: (i) MOFs with open metal sites, offering higher equilibrium selectivity to propylene, such as Mg-MOF-74 (Bao et al., 2011) and Cu-BTC (Ferreira et al., 2011), and (ii) MOFs without open metal sites but with optimal pore aperture, with higher kinetic selectivity to propylene, such as ZIF-8 (Hara et al., 2014), Zn(oxolate)0.5(1,2,4-triazole) and Zn(oxolate)0.5(3-amino-1,2,4-triazole) (Peng et al., 2017).
Pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is one of the alternatives to distillation that could reduce the capital and energy requirements of propylene/propane separation (Kuah et al., 2018). Da Silva and Rodrigues (2001) designed an experimental vacuum swing adsorption process using 13X zeolite pellets to split a 50:50 propane/propylene mixture, using nitrogen as diluent and purging agent, producing propylene with 99.3% purity, 12.5% recovery and a productivity of 0.822 molC3H6 kg−1 h−1. Later, Campo et al. (2013) simulated a VSA cycle using an improved 13X zeolite with reduced binder content which produced propylene with 99.5% purity from a 25:75 propane/propylene mixture, with 85% recovery, a productivity of 1.46 molC3H6 kg−1 h−1, and an energy requirement of 163 electrical kJ per mol of propylene product. Kuah et al. (2018) have proposed a PSA process to recover propylene from an 84.4:15.6 propylene/propane mixture to produce high purity (>99.5 wt%), high recovery (>99%) propylene, but it is required that propylene concentration in the feed must be higher than 82.3%. Using a Dual PSA process (two connected PSA processes (Grande et al., 2010)), it is possible to obtain high recovery and high purity simultaneously (99.6% purity and 95.9% recovery) from a feed with low concentration of propylene (40% propylene) using 4A zeolite as adsorbent. However, further efforts are necessary to reduce the power consumption of VPSA which is still slightly higher than that of distillation (Grande et al., 2010). The optimization of complex PSA systems has been addressed by several authors in the literature (Daeho et al., 2005; Hasan et al., 2012, 2013; Agarwal et al., 2009, 2010; Haghpanah et al., 2013; Effendy et al., 2017; First et al., 2014; Arora et al., 2018a, b, c).
The separation of propane/propylene mixtures using polyvinilydene diflouride membrane with facilitated transport has been studied by Ravanchi et al. (2009). Hara et al. (2014) have reported the preparation of ZIF-8 membranes and Jiang et al. (2017) have proposed the use of porous graphene membrane for the propane/propylene separation.
Recovery level in the propylene purification process has an important impact on the plant economy because of the high throughput of the separation unit, of the order of 60 tonnes of propylene per hour in a typical plant (Kuah et al., 2018). Assuming a Lost Opportunity Cost (LOC) of unrecovered propylene in the product stream of 477 USDollar per tonne of propylene (Kuah et al., 2018), one percentage point increase in propylene recovery results in an increase of the annual benefit of the plant around 2.3 MM USdollar/year (477 USdollar/tonne × 60 tonne/h × 8000 h/year × 0.01).
In this work, a Dual PSA process for separating a 50:50 molar propane/propylene mixture is proposed with propylene recovery above 99.5%. The effect of the operation variables on the separation performance (bed length, cycle duration, feed gas velocities, low pressure, number of beds), and of the way of coupling the two PSA cycles in the Dual PSA cascade, have been studied. The process performance has been improved looking for the minimum energy consumption/productivity ratio.
2. Theory
Two possible configurations have been studied for the Dual PSA process, Configuration A and B (Fig. 1), where F is the number of moles fed to PSA I in one cycle divided into cycle time of PSA I, yF,i is the mole fraction of the ith component in the feed of PSA I, RI,i is the recovery of ith component in the heavy product of PSA I, and RII,i is the recovery of ith component in the heavy product of PSA II.

To carry out each individual cycle, the step sequence shown in Fig. 2 (Jiang et al., 2018) has been used, including a heavy reflux step to increase the purity and recovery of propylene in the heavy product. The influence of the number of beds used in each cycle on the separation has been studied with the time schedules that are also included in Fig. 2.

Fig. 1 includes the relationships used to calculate the molar flows of all process streams. Propylene purity has been calculated as the molar fraction of propylene in the heavy product of PSA II (Configuration A) or PSA I (Configuration B). Propylene recovery has been calculated as:
(1)
The productivity of propylene (in moles of propylene in the heavy product per kg of adsorbent in both cycles and per second) is calculated as follows:
(2)
The energy consumption of the Dual PSA process is (in kJ per mole of propylene in the product)
(3)
where Ej is the energy consumed by PSA j in kJ per mol of heavy product in PSA j. The energy consumption was calculated assuming isoentropic compression with an efficiency of 60% (Kuah et al., 2018). The fraction between fresh feed and feed of PSA I is calculated as:
(4)
A simple objective function, energy consumption (EI+II) / productivity (PI+II), has been used to compare the separation performance for different combinations of operation variables and configurations, providing that propylene purity and recovery specifications are fulfilled (99.5% purity and 99.5% recovery), which should be as low as possible. This objective function considers that process cost is inversely proportional to productivity, because so is the size of the unit, and proportional to energy consumption per unit amount of product. Similar simple objective functions have already been used in the literature (Ingham et al., 2007).
The design variables considered in the study are bed length, cycle duration, feed gas velocities, low pressure, number of beds, and the way of coupling the two PSA cycles in the Dual PSA cascade. It must be noted that a rigorous optimization of the process using MILNP or NLP methods has not been performed in this work, as each simulation to give one single set of performance data may require several days to reach the cyclic steady state, so it is difficult to integrate the simulation program into the optimization algorithm, which may require many simulations to reach the optimum. The process performance has been improved by analyzing the effect of the design variables on the energy consumption / productivity ratio (objective function) and selecting the value of each operation variable resulting in the minimum energy consumption / productivity ratio. The feed gas velocities of PSA I and PSA II were manipulated to keep purity and recovery values above the desired specification (99.5%).
The PSA processes were simulated with the PSASIM® program (Brea et al., 2019). It was assumed that the beds were adiabatic. The equations used to simulate each PSA process are shown in Table S1. The PDE's system has been discretized with the method of orthogonal collocation in finite elements, with cubic Hermite polynomials, and the resulting ODE system has been solved with the ODEPACK program (Hindmarsh, 2019). Linear pressure variations are assumed in pressure-changing steps (P(t) in Table S1).
Both PSA cycles of the Dual PSA process are simulated simultaneously, using two different executable programs which exchange recovery and composition data between each other using files. Cyclic steady state is considered when the variation of purity and recovery are less than 0.005% in 50 consecutive cycles, for both cycles. The feed composition of PSA I is calculated from a mass balance around the mixing node of the fresh feed (Fig. 1), using information from the previous cycle:
(5)
(6)
where the subscript fresh refers to the fresh feed to the process.
Model parameters fixed in the simulations have been taken from Da Silva and Rodrigues (2001) (Table 1). It is assumed that mass transfer in the 13X zeolite pellets is controlled by macropore diffusion (Da Silva and Rodrigues, 1999). To reduce the number of possible combinations of operation variables to study, it is assumed that both cycles in the Dual PSA have the same bed length (L) and the same low pressure (PL).

3. Results and discussion
A Dual PSA process using zeolite 13X as adsorbent (Da Silva and Rodrigues, 2001) has been designed to purify propylene from a 50/50 molar propane/propylene mixture. It has been assumed that the stream fed to the Dual PSA process comes from a PDH reactor operating at 1 bar and 860 K (Eisele and Killpack, 2012), which is cooled down to 423 K (Da Silva and Rodrigues, 2001).
To select the best configuration (A or B in Fig. 1) for the target separation, two Dual PSA processes have been designed, one with Configuration A and the other with Configuration B, setting as design specifications propylene purity > 99.5% and recovery >99.5%. The obtained design and separation performance results are shown in Table 2 (Runs 1 and 2). Configuration A yields better results, as it leads to a lower objective function. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the flow diagrams of both configurations.

Fig. 3. Flow diagrams of Runs 1 (Configuration A) and 2 (Configuration B) in Table 2.
The better performance of Configuration A is attributed to its higher Ffresh/F ratio, which means that a higher amount of product is obtained. Also, there is less difference between the composition of fresh feed and the product stream is mixed with in Configuration A. This leads to a more efficient process in the studied conditions. In view of these results, the rest of simulations were done with Configuration A.
A parametric study of the effect of the main operating variables (feed velocities, bed length, step duration, low pressure) on the separation performance has been carried out. The operating conditions and simulation results are shown in Table 2.
Fig. 4 shows the effect of uF,I on the separation performance (Runs 1, 3 and 4 in Table 2). If uF,I is too low, the concentration of propylene in the heavy product of PSA I decreases because the bed is loaded with less propylene. The purity of propylene in the heavy product of PSA II and the productivity also decrease. Energy consumption rises as uF,I decreases because productivity decreases. If uF,I is too high, the loss of propylene in the light product of PSA I is very high, which leads to lower productivity and higher energy consumption.

Fig. 5 shows the effect of uF,II on the separation performance (Runs 1, 5 and 6 in Table 2). If uF,II is too high purity productivity decreases and energy consumption increases because the Ffresh/F ratio is reduced, although purity and recovery increase slightly. If uF,II is too low, recovery goes down, so productivity decreases and the energy consumption increases. This is due to the lower value of yF,I obtained, which causes the mass transfer zone in PSA I to increase in size (due to the lower self-sharpening effect (Wankat, 1994). As a result, more propylene is lost in LI.

Fig. 6. Effect of L on separation performance.
Propylene purity decreases as L rises because the propylene load prior to evacuation decreases by increasing the amount of adsorbent in the beds. Productivity goes up and energy consumption goes down because Ffresh/F increases. The lower the value of L, the lower the recovery because more propylene is lost in LI. As a result, productivity decreases, and the energy consumption increases.
Fig. 7 shows the effect of tstep on separation performance (Runs 1, 9 and 10 in Table 2). Recovery and productivity decrease with rising tstep, because the loss of propylene in the light product LI increases, increasing the energy consumption. As tstep is reduced, purity decreases because the beds are less loaded with propylene. Productivity goes up and energy consumption goes down because Ffresh/F goes up.

The Dual PSA process performance has been improved by reducing the objective function defined above, maintaining the purity and recovery of propylene above 99.5%. The values of uF,I and uF,II have been manipulated to fulfill the purity and recovery specifications. The variation of the objective function with the duration of the heavy reflux step in PSA I is shown in Table 2 with Runs 13, 1, 14 and 15. It can be seen that there is an optimum value of tHR,I = 35 s (tADS = 25 s, Fig. 1) for which productivity increases and energy consumption decreases, which is equivalent to heavy reflux to feed ratio in the adsorption step of 35/25 = 1.4.
The variation of the objective function with the duration of the heavy reflux step in the PSA II is shown with Runs 14, 16 and 17. The best value of tHR,II is 30 s; for higher or lower values the energy consumption is higher and the productivity lower, which is equivalent to a heavy reflux to feed ratio in the adsorption stage of 30/30 = 1.
The effect of bed length on the objective function is shown with Runs 14, 18 and 19. The lowest value of the objective function is obtained with a bed length of 2 m (Run 18). Although the energy consumption is slightly higher in Run 18, productivity is also higher, which compensates for the higher energy consumption. Fig. 9 shows the effect of bed length on the propylene profiles in the PSA I and PSA II beds at the end of the heavy reflux stage (when the propylene load in the bed has finished), maintaining purity and recovery above 99.5%.

Fig. 9. Effect of L on gas mole fraction profiles of C3H6 at the end of HR step (Runs 14, 18 and 19 in Table 2).
It can be seen that the differences of the profiles in PSA I with L are small, while in PSA II they are much larger. For L = 2 m the lowest concentration of propylene in the light product LII is obtained, so the recovery of propylene in PSA II is higher (93% compared to 91% and 69% for L = 1 and 3 m, respectively), which explains the higher productivity with L = 2 m.
The variation of the objective function with tstep is shown with Runs 18, 20, 21 and 22. Fig. 10 shows the variation of energy consumption, productivity and the objective function with tstep.

Fig. 10. Variation of energy consumption, productivity and objective function with tstep.
Energy consumption and productivity decrease with rising tstep, but the productivity decrease is stronger than that of energy consumption for tstep > 10 s. As a result, a minimum of the objective funcion is obtained for tstep = 10 s.
The variation of the objective function with the number of beds is shown with Runs 21, 23 and 24, in which heavy reflux to feed ratio of 1.4 has been maintained in PSA I, and 1 in PSA II. The best result has been obtained with 6 beds. When using 4 beds, productivity decreases and energy consumption increases, due to a decrease in Ffresh/F. This can be attributed to the shorter duration of the evacuation step (Fig. 1). When 3 beds are used, energy consumption decreases because the evacuation step is longer (Fig. 1), but productivity also decreases because of the longer cycle time, so the objective function increases.
From this study, it has been found that in order to obtain a product with purity and recovery higher than 99.5%, the best operating conditions are those of Run 21. The corresponding flow diagram is shown in Fig. 11.

Fig. 11. Flow diagram of Run 21 in Table 2.
Although mixing the light product of PSA II with fresh feed reduces the concentration of propylene to 47%, the concentration in the heavy product of PSA I rises to 87%, and then to 99.7% in the heavy product of PSA II. High propylene recovery is obtained in PSA II (96%), resulting in low recirculation of the light of product of PSA II, and thus a very high Ffresh/F value is obtained. This results in high productivity and low energy consumption. This separation scheme is technically feasible as it includes two PSA cycles working at cyclic steady state, connected by two streams of constant composition, which can be obtained using buffer tanks.
Fig. 12 shows the molar propylene fraction and temperature profiles at the end of each step of PSA I and PSA II for Run 21. It is observed that the concentration of propylene at the light end of PSA I is very low during the production of light product (ADS and HR steps), which explains the high purity of the propane obtained. On the other hand, the concentration of propylene at the heavy end of the PSA II bed is very high during the evacuation step, which explains the high concentration of propylene in the final product. The heavy reflux step greatly increases the concentration of propylene at the heavy end of both cycles. In equalization with depressurization step the bed expels gas rich in propane, which increases the concentration of propylene in the bed. The equalization with pressurization steps leave the light end of the beds loaded with propane.

Fig. 12. Gas mole fraction and temperature profiles at the end of each step in PSA I and PSA II for Run 21 in Table 2.
Temperature rises in the adsorption and heavy reflux steps because of the adsorption of propylene. Then it goes down in the depressurization steps due to the desorption of gas in the beds, and up again in the pressurization steps by the adsorption of gas. Temperature reaches higher values in PSA II than in PSA I because of the higher concentration of propylene in the PSA II feed.
The energy consumption of the proposed process has been compared with that required to carry out separation by distillation. It has been assumed that the energy consumption of distillation for a 50:50 molar propane/propylene mixture is 3.9 thermal MJ per kg of feed (Cougard et al., 2011; Christopher et al., 2017). It is important to note that this energy consumption does not consider the energy needed to liquefy the feed before entering the distillation column, only considers the energy consumption in the distillation column. Assuming that each thermal unit of energy is equivalent to 0.4 electrical units of energy, the distillation energy consumption is 134 kJ/mol C3H6 (3900 kJ/kg feed × 0.4 × 1 kg feed/0.488 kg C3H6 × 0.042 kg C3H6/1 mol C3H6), which is notably higher than the electrical energy consumption obtained with the proposed Dual PSA process, 82.6 kJ/mol (Run 21, Table 2). The productivity obtained with the proposed process (2.8 × 10−4 mol kg−1 s−1) is comparable to the one obtained with the single PSA process studied by Da Silva and Rodrigues (2001) using the same adsorbent, 2.3 × 10−4 mol kg−1 s−1, with a propylene recovery of 13%.
4. Conclusions
A Dual PSA process has been designed to separate a 50/50 molar propane/propylene mixture using zeolite 13X as adsorbent. The proposed process consists of two connected PSA cycles, with 6 beds each, operating between a high pressure of 1 bar and a low pressure of 0.1 bar, with beds 2 m long and a cycle time of 120 s (12 steps of 10 s). The process can produce propylene with a purity greater than 99.5%, with a recovery higher than 99.5%, which is above the values obtained in the literature for PSA processes with similar concentrations of propylene in the feed. Energy consumption is 82.6 kJ per mol of propylene in the product, and productivity is 2.8 × 10−4 mol kg−1 s−1. This energy consumption is significantly lower than that required to perform the same separation by conventional distillation.
