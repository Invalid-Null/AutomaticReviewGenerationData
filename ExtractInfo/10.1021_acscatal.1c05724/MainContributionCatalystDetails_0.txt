The supplied document does not directly pertain to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). While it discusses Ga species in Ga/H-ZSM-5 catalysts and their potential application for PDH, it does not provide experimental results on PDH performance or compare different catalysts/conditions for enhancing PDH. The focus is on characterizing the Ga speciation and redox properties. Therefore, I cannot extract the requested PDH performance parameters or catalyst enhancement details.
