Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane over transition metal sulfides using sulfur as an alternative oxidant†
The use of alternative oxidants for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane (ODHP) is a promising strategy to suppress the facile overoxidation to COx that occurs with O2. Gaseous disulfur (S2) represents a thermodynamically “softer” oxidant that has been underexplored and yet offers a potential route to more selective propylene formation. Here we describe a system for sulfur-ODHP (SODHP). We demonstrate that various metal sulfide catalysts generate unique reaction product distributions, and that propylene selectivities as high as 86% can be achieved at 450–550 °C. For a group of 6 metal sulfide catalysts, apparent activation energies for propylene formation range from 72–134 kJ mol−1 and parallel the corresponding catalyst XPS sulfur binding energies, indicating that M–S bond strength plays a key role in SODHP activity. Kinetic data over a sulfided ZrO2 catalyst indicate a rate law which is first-order in propane and zero-order in sulfur, suggesting that SODHP may occur via a mechanism analogous to the Mars van Krevelen cycle of traditional ODHP. The present results should motivate further studies of SODHP as a route to the selective and efficient oxidative production of propylene.
Introduction
Recent shifts from naphtha to shale gas feeds in cracking units have led to a renewed interest in “on-purpose” propylene production.1 However, direct propane dehydrogenation is limited by thermodynamic constraints and catalyst deactivation due to extensive coking.2 Oxidative dehydrogenation of propane with O2 (ODHP) is an approach that has the potential to dramatically improve the efficiency of propylene production. This reaction is thermodynamically favorable owing to its exothermicity (Fig. 1a), and coking is significantly suppressed under O2.3,4 However, after years of research, achieving high propylene yields remains elusive due to overoxidation of the olefin product to CO and CO2.5 Investigations of novel approaches to ODHP are therefore needed to address this grand scientific challenge.

Recently elemental sulfur, in the form of S2 vapor, has been implemented as a “soft” oxidant for the oxidative coupling of methane (OCM) to enhance ethylene selectivity by moderating the thermodynamic driving force towards over-oxidation.6–8 S2 is isoelectronic with O2 and is the primary sulfur allotrope present in the gas phase above 700 °C (see Experimental section for details on S2 formation in this work).9–11 This approach might also, in principle, be applicable to ODHP with S2, as the Gibbs energy of reaction (ΔGr) for total oxidation is far less severe with S2 than for O2 (Fig. 1a). Furthermore, for methane, significant mechanistic differences are observed between S2-OCM (SOCM) over metal sulfide catalysts versus traditional metal oxide-based OCM.7,8 These results raise the intriguing question of whether an S2 oxidant and metal sulfide catalysts might display unique reactivity properties in an ODHP process as well.
Earth-abundant metal sulfides have proven to be promising, inexpensive catalysts for hydrocarbon transformations such as light alkane dehydrogenation.12–18 Additionally, metal sulfides are tolerant to sulfur-containing compounds, which are present in most natural gas streams and which poison many noble metal and oxide-based catalyst alternatives.19,20 Shan et al. prepared sulfided metal oxide catalysts and reported that they exhibit higher activity and selectivity for isobutane dehydrogenation than the original oxide catalysts.13–15 These authors argued that the increased selectivity reflects an electronic effect in which olefin desorption is facilitated on the sulfided catalyst surfaces. Nevertheless, these sulfided catalysts undergo rapid deactivation with time on stream due to loss of sulfur but can be regenerated by re-sulfiding the surface.
Peer-reviewed literature and patents have also described alkane ODH reactions promoted by sulfur, either in the form of H2S added to the reactant stream or by using sulfate- or sulfide-based catalysts.21–27 This sulfur addition is reported to enhance both ODH conversion and olefin selectivity. Several of these reports argue for in situ formation of some active sulfur species such as S2, produced via reaction of H2S and O2. Nevertheless, very little experimental data are available to support these models, and the relative roles of S2 and O2 oxidation are not easily differentiated.21,24,27 Indeed, the limited reports in which elemental sulfur is proposed as an oxidant would be greatly strengthened by mechanistic data.
Overall, the prior literature on metal sulfide catalysts and sulfur promotion of light alkane activation suggests that a sulfur-ODHP (SODHP) process might be a promising route to acceptable propylene yields. Additionally, the H2S byproduct formed from an SODHP process could be regenerated as elemental sulfur via the efficient industrial Claus process (Fig. 1b).28 In this contribution we describe a system for SODHP using elemental sulfur (S2) as an oxidant and compare the catalytic results over six metal sulfide catalysts. The goal here is an exploratory study of the scope, fundamental chemistry, and mechanism of S2 as an oxidant for ODHP. We report product selectivities, apparent activation energies (Eapp), and reaction orders under differential conditions, leading to a plausible proposed reaction mechanism. These results demonstrate that sulfur vapor (S2) can act as an effective oxidant for ODHP and that this novel SODHP process may be a promising new route to propylene production.
Experimental
Catalyst preparation
In this study, bulk metal sulfides and sulfided metal oxides were employed as catalysts. Sulfided metal oxides will be denoted as S-MxOy, where MxOy is the metal oxide precursor. ZrO2, TiO2 (rutile), Cr2O3, Co3O4, MoS2, and PdS powders were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Prior to sulfidation or catalytic reaction, the materials were pressed into pellets, then crushed and sieved to achieve a mesh size of 180–300 μm. The metal sulfides, MoS2 and PdS, were used as received without further pre-treatment. In order to ensure stable operating conditions under the sulfur-rich environment of the SODHP reaction, the metal oxides, ZrO2, TiO2 (rutile), Cr2O3, and Co3O4, were pre-sulfided before the SODHP reaction by heating to 600 °C and holding for 6 h under a gas stream containing 0.28 wt% S2 and 0.33 wt% H2S. The sulfidation conditions were selected based on previous work on these and other similar sulfide catalysts for the oxidative coupling of methane with sulfur.7
Safety note: H2S, a pretreatment gas and reaction product of this study, is lethal at concentrations of 750–1000 ppm. As such, the experimental setup should be contained in a well-ventilated area equipped with an H2S monitor.
Catalyst characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of S-Co3O4 were acquired using a Scintag XDS2000 instrument, while all other catalyst XRD patterns were collected on a Rigaku Ultima diffractometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out using a Thermo Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi instrument. An electron flood gun was applied prior to sample analysis. Peak fitting was performed using Thermo Avantage software. Physisorption measurements were performed with a Micromeritics 3Flex instrument, and surface areas were calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. Prior to measurements, metal sulfides and sulfided oxides were degassed at 120 °C for 6 h, while metal oxide precursors were degassed at 300 °C for 6 h. The BET surface areas of S-Co3O4 and PdS could not be determined due to loss of sulfur from the bulk under vacuum conditions.
Catalyst evaluation
Catalytic reactions were carried out at atmospheric pressure between 450 and 550 °C in a custom flow reactor that has been described in detail previously.6 Briefly, a sulfur evaporator, preheater furnace, and reactor furnace are contained within an insulated oven. The sulfur flow rate was adjusted by controlling the temperature of the sulfur evaporator (typically 180–220 °C). Prior to introduction into the reactor furnace, sulfur vapor was passed through the preheater furnace at 700 °C. At this temperature, S2 is the predominant gaseous species compared to other gas-phase sulfur allotropes.9–11 Gas flow rates were controlled using Brooks Model 5850E mass flow controllers.
The quartz reactor tube was charged with 100–200 mg of metal sulfide catalyst or oxide precursor before each reaction. The reactor was flushed with 120 sccm He while heating to reaction or sulfidation temperature. During the SODHP reaction, propane and sulfur were flowed for a minimum of 3 h. Products were analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent 7890A) using flame ionization (FID) and thermal conductivity (TCD) detectors. The reported propane conversions (eqn (1)) and product selectivities (eqn (2)) were determined using the average of the last 90 min on stream and calculated on a molar basis. Here, C represents the concentration of a carbon-containing product and ν represents the number of carbon atoms in said product.

Conversion and selectivity were calculated as an average of several time points to account for uncertainties in the GC peak areas of propane and other gases. Steady state catalyst performance was achieved prior to calculation of these values (see Fig. S9† for stability of SODHP catalysts with time on stream). Additionally, weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) during the SODHP reaction was calculated by dividing the total mass flow rate of the feed gas (including propane, sulfur, and inerts) in grams per min by the total mass of catalyst loaded into the reactor in grams.
Results and discussion
Catalyst characterization
The spent sulfided metal oxide catalysts were characterized in order to probe the effects of the sulfidation treatment and SODHP reaction conditions. The BET surface areas of the precursors and spent catalysts are summarized in Tables 1 and S1.† The surface areas of the spent catalysts are somewhat lower than those of the precursors, which is consistent with earlier SOCM studies and is expected upon transition from oxide to sulfide.7,29 The BET surface area of the MoS2 catalyst is unchanged after the SODHP reaction. PXRD patterns of S-Co3O4 and S-TiO2 reveal complete and partial transformation of the bulk into sulfides, respectively (Fig. 2). Moreover, the S-ZrO2 and S-Cr2O3 diffraction patterns exhibit no significant differences from those of the oxide precursors, indicating that any sulfide phase is either amorphous and/or present solely as a thin layer on the surface.

The XPS Zr3d spectrum of S-ZrO2 contains a doublet with ionizations centered at 181.99 and 184.35 eV. These peaks match those of a ZrS2 standard (Fig. 3) as well as literature data.30 The Cr2p spectrum of S-Cr2O3 contains a pair of spin–orbit doublets, which can be assigned to Cr2O3 and Cr2S3. The peak centered at 574.9 eV agrees well with the reported Cr2p3/2 value for Cr2S3, while the peak at 576.9 eV falls into the reported range for Cr2O3.31 Similarly, the Ti2p scan for S-TiO2 displays four peaks corresponding to the spin–orbit doublets for TiS2 and TiO2 (Fig. S2†). These results suggest that S-ZrO2 likely consists of a core–shell type structure with surface ZrS2 and the ZrO2 phase comprising the bulk. In contrast, S-Cr2O3 and S-TiO2 contain both oxide and sulfide on the surface. While the presence of TiS2 in the PXRD pattern of S-TiO2 suggests some bulk oxide to sulfide conversion, S-Cr2O3 likely remains as Cr2O3 in the bulk. Similar structural trends were observed in previous studies on these catalysts.7 Note that S-Co3O4 is completely sulfided into bulk Co3S4 and CoS according to the present PXRD data. The XPS spectrum reveals the presence of fully reduced Co0 on the surface in addition to the expected CoII and CoIII (Fig. S3†). Additionally, all the sulfided catalysts contain a spin–orbit doublet in the S2p region (see Table 1 and Fig. S4†), which further supports the formation of metal sulfides.31

The diffraction patterns of fresh and spent MoS2 and PdS reveal that there are no phase changes following the SODHP reaction (Fig. S5†). However, spent PdS displays significantly sharper peaks compared to the fresh catalyst, suggesting increased crystallite dimensions/order. Additionally, the XPS spectra in the Mo3d and Pd3d regions display no observable change in metal oxidation state after the SODHP reaction (Fig. S6†), indicating that there is no significant loss of sulfur from the surface under catalytic reaction conditions.
Catalyst evaluation
The six catalysts were investigated for SODHP over the 450–550 °C temperature range. A “blank reaction” using the same reactor filled with quartz sand was also performed to ensure there are no significant homogeneous gas phase reactions in this temperature range (Fig. S10†). All catalysts achieve steady-state conversion after 1–2 h on stream (Fig. S9†). Fig. 4 compares the conversions and product distributions of the six catalysts. Propane conversion is significantly catalyst-dependent and varies from 4.7 to 8.1% at 550 °C. The major reaction products are propylene and CS2. Less than 4% combined C2 and C1 products are detected at the highest temperature of 550 °C, suggesting that C–C bond activation is a relatively minor pathway. The carbon balance exceeds 98% for all catalysts (Fig. S11†). In addition to carbon-containing products, H2S is also detected in the product stream (see Table S3† for H2S yields). The propylene selectivity varies widely, ranging from 86% over S-ZrO2 to 38% over PdS. The range of propylene selectivities may be due to differences in activity for propane/propylene combustion or desorption energetics of propylene from the surface. Selectivity also increases with temperature for all catalysts (see Fig. S7†). This trend is similar to that observed for traditional ODH and indicates that the activation energy for propylene overoxidation to CS2 is lower than that for propane conversion to propene.32 Thus, as the SODHP reaction is further studied in the future and reaction conditions are optimized, it may be preferable to operate between 500–550 °C, where high selectivity can be achieved without the intrusion of significant gas phase reactions.

Control experiments were next performed to examine the effect of sulfur (S2) in the SODHP reaction. Without sulfur in the reactant feed, the propane conversion is significantly diminished over the sulfide catalysts. Fig. 5 shows the results of experiments in which the sulfur flow is switched on and switched off while on stream over MoS2 and S-ZrO2. That is, the total gas flow rate is maintained constant while the sulfur flow is terminated using a balance flow of He. In a typical experiment, sulfur and propane flow over the catalyst. The propane conversion drops during the first 1–2 hours on stream before reaching steady state, which may be due to sintering, surface reconstruction, or the presence of active sites that are not regenerated. When the sulfur flow is terminated, the propane conversion falls significantly, but rapidly recovers to steady state levels upon reintroducing the sulfur flow. These results argue that there is little background non-oxidative dehydrogenation or thermal cracking of propane occurring under these conditions for both MoS2 and S-ZrO2, and that sulfur is an effective oxidant.

In the absence of sulfur, the total flow rate was maintained using He as a balance gas. Conditions: WHSV = 8.3 min−1, propane/S2 = 3.7, T = 550 °C.
The relationship between propane conversion and product selectivity was also investigated by altering the contact time of the gas feed. As shown in Fig. 6, higher propane conversions lead to reduced propylene and increased CS2 selectivity over both S-ZrO2 and MoS2. The inverse relationship between conversion and propylene selectivity suggests that CS2 is formed as a secondary product from propylene over-oxidation.33 However, propylene selectivity does not reach 100% when extrapolated to zero conversion, indicating that some direct propane → CS2 conversion is also operative.33

The trade-off between conversion and selectivity in ODHP is often severe.34–38 For the present SODHP system, the severity of the trade-off is markedly catalyst-dependent. The propylene selectivity over MoS2 drops considerably, from 49 to 22% at 2.6 and 10.9% conversion, respectively. In contrast, S-ZrO2 displays a relatively moderate trade-off at low conversions, with the propylene selectivity only falling to 61% at the highest conversion tested (16%). Fig. 7 shows the conversion–selectivity relationship for SODHP over S-ZrO2 to those of ODHP over some well-studied transition metal oxide catalysts in the literature. Although the reaction conditions are not exactly identical, it can be seen that the propylene selectivity over S-ZrO2 is comparable to the selectivities that have been reported for optimized traditional ODHP. In particular, the extent of the trade-off between conversion and selectivity over S-ZrO2 rivals that of these literature examples. These results highlight that SODHP over metal sulfide catalysts can be an effective route to selective oxidative propylene production. Of course, SODHP is in its infancy, and further studies will likely yield more active and selective catalysts.

Mechanistic characterization
Since the SODHP catalytic properties are strongly dependent on the metal sulfide identity, another question concerning this reaction is what intrinsic sulfide properties govern catalyst activity. Since neither the active site density nor the sulfide surface area could be accurately measured for these catalysts, reaction rates cannot easily be used to compare all six catalysts. Instead, the experimental Eapp values for propylene formation were determined using the Arrhenius formalism and employed as activity descriptors. Note that Eapp has frequently been used in the heterogeneous catalysis literature to describe catalyst activity and volcano trends.39,40Table 1 summarizes the measured Eapp value for each catalyst (see Table S2† for R2 values from linear fit), and the Arrhenius plots can be found in Fig. S12.†
Several previous studies suggested that traditional ODHP over metal oxide catalysts proceeds via a Mars van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism, in which lattice oxygen species on the catalyst surface are consumed during alkane activation.32,38,41–43 The resulting oxygen vacancies are then replenished by the gas phase O2. For an MvK mechanism, the catalyst activity is typically determined by the reducibility of the catalyst or the metal–oxygen bond strength.44 With this relationship in mind, we attempted to correlate the present SODHP catalytic activity with either of these parameters. Although the heat of formation has frequently been used as a rough estimate of the metal–oxygen or metal–sulfur bond strength,45,46 there is no obvious correlation between the bulk sulfide enthalpy of formation and the present Eapp values. However, the heat of formation is a bulk property and does not necessarily describe surface properties.47 In the absence of computed values, the sulfur XPS binding energy was selected as a surface specific metric of the metal–sulfur bond strength. Since the XPS binding energy represents the energy required to remove an inner electron, a larger sulfur binding energy suggests decreased electron density in the sulfur atom/lower-lying bonding orbitals, and thus stronger M–S bonding.48
Fig. 8 examines the correlation between the sulfur 2p3/2 binding energy and the Eapp for SODHP. Eapp decreases as the binding energy decreases (weaker M–S bonding). The exception is S-Co3O4, which has the largest barrier despite exhibiting the lowest sulfur binding energy. However, as the XPS data reveal (see Fig. S3†), this catalyst contains significant amounts of Co0 on the surface. Note also that this Co0 is not a reduction artifact arising from the argon sputtering since an ion beam was not applied before acquiring the XPS spectrum of this sample. The presence of Co0 could indicate that the high Eapp for S-Co3O4 may be due to structural differences versus the other metal sulfide catalysts. An alternative explanation is that we are observing an inverse “volcano” trend,49 where beyond a certain sulfur binding energy the reaction kinetics change and Eapp begins to increase. Note that the XPS sulfur binding energy does not necessarily scale linearly with actual M–S bond energy, meaning the slope visualized in Fig. 8 may differ with DFT-calculated values.

Regarding the remaining five catalysts, a plausible rationalization for the observed trend is that weaker M–S bonds and more electron-rich/basic surface sulfur atoms facilitate hydrogen abstraction from propane. Similar trends have been reported previously for light alkane oxidation processes, including SOCM.6,50 To examine this hypothesis, the reaction orders of sulfur and propane were determined. As shown in Fig. 9a, the rate of propane consumption over S-ZrO2 is essentially invariant with the sulfur concentration, indicating a zero-order S2 dependence (see ESI† Table S4 for the conversions and propylene selectivities). Propane : S2 ratios greater than reaction stoichiometry were used here to ensure the observed zero-order dependence was not simply due to an overabundance of sulfur in the reactant stream. A similar result has been frequently described in the ODHP kinetics literature for O2.33,41,44 The propane order was next measured under excess sulfur. The natural logarithms of propane concentration and reaction rate display a linear relationship with a slope of 0.91 (see Fig. 9b), suggesting first-order dependence in propane.
Fig. 9 For SODHP, the natural logarithm of the a) sulfur concentration versus the natural logarithm of the reaction rate over S-ZrO2 b) propane concentration versus the natural logarithm of the reaction rate on S-ZrO2, and c) sulfur concentration versus the natural logarithm of the reaction rate on S-Co3O4. Conditions: WHSV = 8.3 min−1, T = 510 °C.
The sulfur order in the rate law was also measured for S-Co3O4 to ascertain whether there was a kinetic difference regarding the role of sulfur for this catalyst. Unlike S-ZrO2, the reaction rate over S-Co3O4 increases with increasing sulfur concentration. Fig. 9c shows that the relationship between the natural logarithms of sulfur concentration and rate yields a slope close to 0.5. This apparent half-order in S2 for S-Co3O4 suggests mechanistically that there is a slow S2 dissociation step during SODHP over this catalyst.
Considering the above results, the following mechanism is tentatively proposed for SODHP and summarized in Fig. 10. The rate-determining step in SODHP over the present metal sulfide catalysts is propane C–H activation by a surface sulfur species, which leads to surface reduction. Hydrogen abstraction from the central carbon is typically rate-determining in oxide-mediated propane oxidations and is consistent with the observed first-order dependence in propane.51,52 A more active sulfur species would be expected when the metal–sulfur bonding is weaker and the sulfur atom is more electron dense, which in turn would lead to a lower Eapp. The relationship illustrated in Fig. 8 indeed follows this trend, as a lower sulfur binding energy is indicative of weaker metal–sulfur bonding. Following C–H activation, the formation of propylene and H2S would then leave a sulfur vacancy on the sulfide surface. The observed zero-order in S2 for S-ZrO2 signifies that gas phase sulfur is involved after the rate-determining step. Thus, akin to the mechanism of traditional ODHP, the role of gas phase sulfur (S2) would be to replenish the surface sulfur vacancies.
Fig. 10 Proposed mechanism for SODHP over metal sulfide catalysts. The red box represents a sulfur vacancy, M is the metal of a given metal sulfide, and R.D.S. stands for the rate-determining step.
As the M–S bond becomes increasingly weak, the surface reduction by propane could become more facile to the extent that re-sulfidation of the surface becomes the slower step. The point at which re-sulfidation becomes rate-determining may conceivably correspond to the peak of the “volcano” trend in Fig. 8. This explanation plausibly accounts for the higher Eapp and observed half-order in sulfur for S-Co3O4. Additionally, the presence of Co0 on the surface of S-Co3O4 as discussed above suggests that this catalyst is easily reduced and less easily sulfided compared to other SODHP catalysts. Note that, although sulfur vapor is preheated to 700 °C prior to reaction with propane (see Experimental section), the actual SODHP reaction temperature is 550 °C or lower. Thus, it is possible that other sulfur allotropes such as S8 or S7 may be present in the reactant stream.9–11 Future experimental and theoretical work will be needed to characterize the nature of the sulfur vapor oxidant in more detail.
Conclusions
This investigation aimed to expand the previous S2 “soft oxidant” approach as an OCM analogue to an ODHP analogue and to explore the activity of metal sulfide catalysts in this reaction. The data presented here, including catalyst characterization and reactivity studies, are summarized in Table 1. Gaseous elemental sulfur is found to be an effective oxidant for ODHP, and the product selectivities vary significantly depending on the metal sulfide catalyst identity (86% propylene over S-ZrO2versus 38% over PdS at 550 °C, for example). The experimental Eapp values for propylene formation are shown to scale/increase with increasing XPS sulfur binding energy, a qualitative experimental estimate of M–S bond strength and electron density. This result, combined with reaction orders of C3H8 and S2, suggest a mechanism in which surface sulfur species initiate C–H activation and gas phase S2 replenishes the vacancies resulting from product formation. Additionally, respectable propylene yields are obtained for a number of the catalysts examined. The findings reported in this study demonstrate that SODHP is a viable route to selective propylene formation over inexpensive and sulfur-tolerant catalysts. Further experimental and theoretical studies of SODHP catalyst development are ongoing.

</DOCUMENT>

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
