Co2+ to Al3+ Substitution Induced Dual-Site Synergistic Catalysis to Friedel-Crafts Alkylation Reactions
Graphical Abstract
A simple Co2+ to Al3+ substitution in Al4B6O15 lattice leads to the dual-site synergistic catalysis, that is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction between β-nitrostyrene adsorbed and activated at the Lewis acidic site (unsaturated Co2+) and the indole molecule, which is activated by an adjacent reactive oxygen species.
Abstract
The dual-site synergistic effect in heterogeneous catalysis is quite interesting, and also complex because at least two substrate molecules are adsorbed or activated on the catalyst surface, which apparently needs two spatially separated and functionally independent active sites. It would become more difficult when the substrate molecules are large ones. The replacement of Al3+ in Al4B6O15 lattice with Co2+ leads to the formation of unsaturated Co2+ (4-fold coordination) along with oxygen vacancies (Ov). The former one behaves as a medium-strength Lewis acid site, and can adsorb and activate molecules with a nitro group (e. g., β-nitrostyrene). The latter one can adsorb and activate oxygen species, which further activates the indole derivatives. Next, the spatially separated dual sites on the catalyst surface can synergistically and efficiently catalyze their Friedel-Crafts alkylation reactions under mild conditions. The high durability can be proved by the as-maintained high yields, that is, 98, 93, 96, 92 and 90 % for 5 runs, respectively. The reaction kinetics obey the second-order characteristic. Annealing under hydrogen condition can further generate more surficial Ov, leading to an improvement to the catalytic activity. A simple and probably routine aliovalent doping endows such a complex synergistic catalysis involving two large substrate molecules, providing an inspired perspective of developing dual-site catalysts.
Introduction
Defect-rich catalysts, induced by aliovalent cationic substitutions into the lattice, have been widely used for catalytic oxidation,1-4 hydrogenation,5-7 dehydrogenation8, 9 and methylation of aromatic compounds.10 Apparently, a low-valent cation doping promotes the generation of oxygen vacancy defects, which usually are key sites for activating gaseous O2. For example, Sr2+-doped LaFeO3 can catalyze the partial oxidation of methane;1 Mn2+-doped ZrO2 (MnxZr1−xO2) and Fe3+-doped MnO2 (FexMn1−xO2) both serve as the efficient catalysts in toluene oxidation.2, 3 In some cases, such aliovalent cationic dopant itself can also behave as the active site for the adsorption and activation of substrate molecules. For instance, when Co2+ was doped into the purely siliceous MFI zeolite, the isolated Co2+ in this particular zeolitic microenvironment can efficiently catalyze propane dehydrogenation;8 bivalent Mg2+, Co2+, and Zn2+ doped zeotype catalysts MAPO-18s exhibit a superior catalytic performance in the methanol to olefins reaction, because the aliovalent substitution modifies the polarity of the M−O bond, resulting into numerous stronger Brønsted acid sites.6
Moreover, so-called frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) have been recently proposed in heterogeneous catalysis. A typical example is that, in CeO2-δ nanorods, an oxygen-vacancy induced surficial Ce3+ together with an adjacent lattice oxygen behave as Lewis acidic and Lewis basic sites, respectively, which promote synergistically the dissociation of H−H bond with a low activation energy, thus leading to an excellent catalytic activity in the hydrogenation of alkenes and alkynes.5, 7 In this case, the Lewis acidic and basic sites are separated spatially, but exhibit a synergistic effect. Such FLPs were also reported in cobalt borate (CoBOx) nanosheets, where the surficial hydroxyl is the Lewis basic site and the next-neighboring (∼3.40 Å) cobalt ion is the corresponding Lewis acidic site. Similar synergistic effect was utilized in the H2 activation and enhance the subsequent hydrogenation efficiency.11
Apparently, the employment of FLPs in the typical dual-site catalysis is interesting, however, the hitherto cases are limited in the activation of one small molecule, not two distinct and large substrate molecules. In this work, the Friedel-Crafts (F-C) alkylation reaction between β-nitrostyrene and indole is the target reaction. As is known, indole derivatives play an important role in regulating physiological activities and metabolism due to their alkalinity and diversity of substituents, therefore they have been widely used in pharmaceutical, pesticide, food and other fields.12-15 A very efficient catalyst (with a yield of 98 %) was developed by doping Co2+ into the aluminoborate Al4B6O15 lattice.16, 17 On one hand, such a low-valent cationic substitution leads to the formation of surficial oxygen vacancies (Ov). They in fact plays a key role in adsorbing and activating oxygen species, which further activates the indole derivatives. On the other hand, Co2+, which is proved to be in the 4-fold coordination and is the Lewis acidic site, can activate the nitro group from β-nitrostyrene, making it susceptible to the indole derivatives nearby. The most interesting point is that such a complex catalytic process is accomplished synergistically and efficiently, where the dual-site catalyst is simply obtained by the low-valent cationic substitution.
Results and Discussion
Metal borates are well-known candidates to optical materials,18 and very recently, several AlO6 octahedra-based aluminoborates were reported as good heterogeneous catalysts. For instance, HAl3B6O12(OH)4 aluminoborate doped with Cr3+ is capable of catalytic oxidation of sec-alcohol using H2O2,19 and if doped with Fe3+, it can catalyze the ring-open hydration of epoxide into diols in a low water-epoxide ratio.20 Al4B6O15 is the thermal decomposition product of HAl3B6O12(OH)4, and in literature, Cr3+-doped Al4B6O15 was reported to catalyze the dehydration of methanol into dimethyl ether at 300–450 °C.21 In addition to the isovalent substitution, we report, for the first time, the Co2+-doping into the Al4B6O15 lattice with a two-step synthesis procedure. Figure 1a presents the PXRD data for 2∼8 % Co2+-doped Al4B6O15, the patterns of which are aligned with a vertical shift for easy comparison. Apparently, all of them share the same pattern, and the peak indices are also provided in Figure 1a. 8 %Co−Al4B6O15 was the representative sample, whose PXRD data were refined with the Le Bail method as shown in Figure 1b. The cell lattice parameters were refined by Le Bail fitting using TOPAS software package22 and space group (R3) was employed according to the literature. A good convergence can be observed and all peaks appear at the expected positions (2θ), indicating the high phase purity. The upper limit of the doping concentration of Co2+ can be experimentally estimated to be 8 %, above which an impurity phase would be observed in PXRD.

Blue circles, red and black lines represent the observed, calculated patterns, and the difference between them, respectively. The green bars below are the expected reflection positions.
XPS was performed on 8 %Co−Al4B6O15. As shown in Figure 2, the binding energies (BE) at 781.6 and 797.5 eV are assigned to Co 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively, and the broad shoulder peaks at 786.8 and 803.0 eV are attributed to the satellite peaks. Since the BE of Co 2p3/2 in 8 %Co−Al4B6O15 (781.6 eV) is same to that of CoAl2O4 (781.6 eV),23 the apparent valence state of cobalt is likely +2. It is also commonly agreed that the BE difference between Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 is ∼16 or ∼15 eV for bivalent or trivalent cobalt cations, respectively.24, 25 Here, this value is 15.9 eV, further consolidating the bivalent nature of cobalt cations in 8 %Co−Al4B6O15. In addition, the BE difference between principal and satellite peaks (ΔE) is another critical parameter to evaluate the coordination number of cobalt cations,24-28 for example, 5 or 6 eV of ΔE corresponds to tetrahedral or octahedral coordination, respectively.24 In our study, the value of ΔE is 5.2 eV, supporting the fact that Co2+ is in 4-fold coordination.

ICP-OES was also employed to determine the overall cobalt contents in as-synthesized catalysts. As shown in Table 1, the measured cobalt contents are 0.67, 1.21, 3.70 and 6.68 % for those with loading contents of 2, 4, 6, 8 %. The low actual concentrations are understandable because an aliovalent substitution is always more difficult than the isovalent doping, for example, the Cr3+-to-Al3+ substitution into Al4B6O15 could be as high as 20 %. As we will prove later that the Co2+-to-Al3+ replacement was accompanied with the formation of oxygen vacancy, which will destabilize the overall framework. Interestingly, as shown in Table 1, no obvious changes of the cell volumes of x%Co−Al4B6O15 calculated by Le Bail fitting was given with increasing Co2+ alternative proportion from 2 % to 8 %. A comprehensive analysis including oxidation state, coordination number and spin state indicates the tetrahedral coordinated Co2+ has a very close ionic radius (0.58 Å, coordination number (CN)=4) to Al3+ (0.535 Å, CN=6). If there was other coordination mode for Co2+, such as 5- or 6-fold coordination, which obviously has a larger radius, the Co2+-to-Al3+ replacement would result into a distinct volume expansion. Experimentally, the constant lattice parameter of x%Co−Al4B6O15 also provides a powerful evidence that the adjustment of coordination number changing from 6 to 4 is an efficient way to balance the excessive ionic charge after a non-equivalent lattice replacement.

8 %Co−Al4B6O15 was also characterized by HAADF-STEM. TEM images in Figures 3a and 3b indicate that the as-synthesized samples are well-crystallized nano-sheets in morphology, and these nano-sheets are loosely distributed and exhibit no severe agglomeration. Actually, the mass specific surface area by BET method (listed in Figure S14 in Supporting Information and Table 1) indicate the as-synthesized catalysts all have a large surface area ranging from 42 to 55 m2/g. A high resolution image in Figure 3c exhibits clear lattice fringes with the values of 5.7, 5.4 and 3.2 Å, which correspond to (1 1 0), (1 0 1) and (2 1 1) crystal planes, respectively. Figures 3d–3f display the elemental mapping on a selected particle, where Co and Al are homogeneously dispersed, and the quantitative cation ratio (Co/(Co+Al)) is 6.8 atom%, which is close to the ICP-OES result. In summary, Co2+ ions were successfully incorporated into the Al4B6O15 lattice without any major structural change, and it is in a 4-fold coordination.

The general catalytic conditions including temperature and solvent were optimized using the model F-C alkylation reaction between β-nitrostyrene and indole. First, five common solvents with different polarity, including toluene, benzene, ethanol (EtOH), acetonitrile (CH3CN) and dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), were employed as reaction medium. As shown in Figure 4a, the yield reached 97 % in toluene and benzene, probably due to their good solubility with hydrophobic reactants, while the yield was very poor in acetonitrile and dichloromethane, and the catalytic efficiency in ethanol is also good.29 Second, the temperature-dependent yield and the so-calculated TONs were also investigated as shown in Figure 4b. The catalytic yield was as low as 21.4 % at 30 °C, while it exhibited a sharp increase to 85.3 % just by increasing the temperature to 40 °C, thereafter a slow increasing tendency can be observed. Accordingly, the following catalytic reactions were performed at 70 °C and using toluene as the solvent. Because crystal structures can clearly exhibit the molecular spatial configuration, especially their chiral structures, the crystal structure of the product 1 a, as a representative, is shown in Figure S11. Crystallographic data (Table S1) revealed that 1 a compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic lattice system, with a Pbca space group and unit cell parameters a=9.83 Å, b=14.97 Å, c=18.45 Å. Although 1 a compound has chiral carbon atoms, the crystal morphology is centrosymmetric and therefore are exclusive of the possibility of chiral crystal, indicating the formation of the optically inactive racement during the catalytic reaction.

(b) The influence of different temperature: β-nitrostyrene (0.2 mmol), indole (0.24 mmol), toluene (4 mL), 8 %Co−Al4B6O15 catalyst (40 mg), 24 h.
The reaction order of this catalytic reaction is important and can be determined by a typical dynamic study. As shown in Figure 5a, the time-dependent yield at given conditions exhibited a fast increasing at the initial stage, that is, it reached 80 % within 4 h. Define the initial concentrations of indoles and β-nitrostyrene to be a and b, and x refers to the concentration of the product 1 a at different moments t. The variation of the respective concentration along with the reaction time can be fitted using the empirical rate equation: . Here, a very good linear correlation between the concentration expression of and the reaction times t can be observed as shown in Figure 5b, suggesting the kinetic characteristics of this F-C alkylation reaction in our catalytic system is the second-order. Moreover, the corresponding reaction rate constant k at different temperatures can be also determined. As shown in the inset of Figure 5b, the apparent activation energy Ea can be estimated to be ∼33 kJ/mol according to the slop of the fitting curve with the Arrhenius equation.11, 30 The relatively low Ea is an indication that 8 %Co−Al4B6O15 can efficiently activate the involved substrate molecules and catalyze this F-C alkylation reaction.

Table 2 lists the efficiency of 8 %Co−Al4B6O15 to catalyze the F-C alkylation reactions between β-nitrostyrene and another 4 indole derivatives. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance were employed to determine the molecular structure of all five obtained products (1 a–5 a), and the relevant data are presented in Figures S1–S10 in the Supporting Information.31-33 As expected, the yield all maintains at a high level (88 %∼96 %) and the corresponding products are exclusive without any byproducts. A durable test with five successive runs was also performed on 8 %Co−Al4B6O15 at given reaction conditions. After each reaction cycle, the solid catalyst can be easily recovered (∼90 %) by a centrifugation, toluene washing, and an oven-drying process. The PXRD data for the final recovered power catalyst exhibit almost the same pattern with that of the fresh one. Only a tiny amount of non-active mullite−Al4B2O9 can be observed. Other than the stability, the high durability of the catalyst can be also proved by the as-maintained high yields, that is, 98, 93, 96, 92 and 90 % for 5 runs, respectively.

From the above discussion, it clearly shows that Co2+-substitution is essential to catalyze the F-C alkylation reaction, and Co2+ sites are the essential catalytic centers to activate the substrate molecules. To deeply understand this indispensable role undertaken by Co2+ active sites, x%Co−Al4B6O15 catalysts are assessed under the given reaction conditions, and the catalytic results are shown in Figure 6a. For a control experiment, a blank reaction between indole and β-nitrostyrene without catalyst only gave a 5.1 % yield. It increased dramatically with the increase of Co2+ concentration in the Al4B6O15, and the highest yield (97.9 %) was achieved over 8 %Co−Al4B6O15, which is nearly 19 times higher than the blank experiment. The above phenomenon indisputably indicates that Co2+ in the Al4B6O15 lattice function as the active sites to catalyze the F-C alkylation reaction.34

In term of the reaction mechanism, such F-C alkylation reaction obeys an acid-catalyzed reaction path. In order to understand the relationship between surface acidity and the Co2+ content, NH3-TPD was performed over x%Co−Al4B6O15 catalysts to monitor the change of the acid strength and amount. Figures 6b and 6c depict the NH3-TPD profiles of these catalysts and their corresponding acid amounts (expressed as NH3 uptake per gram of the catalyst, mmol/g). All samples exhibit a characteristic desorption peak at ∼320 °C, indicating the presence of medium-strength acid sites (located in the temperature region of 200∼400 °C) on the surface of the catalysts.35 Expectedly, a rapid increase of the acid amount from 0.26 to 1.1 mmol/g was observed by increasing Co2+ content in the lattice, indicating the Co2+-substitution has strongly modified the surface property. In this sense, the construction of chemically-sensitive acid centers may be realized by adjusting the controllable metal-substitution, x%Co−Al4B6O15 exhibits a good potential for some acid-catalyzed reactions.11 As shown in Figure 6c, it exhibits a good linear correlation between the product yield and the surface acid amount, and eventually a great promotion from 34.3 % to 97.9 % was achieved when 8 %Co−Al4B6O15 catalyst was used.
Although NH3-TPD measurements can quantitatively provide the total acid amount, however it is unable to distinguish Brønsted and Lewis acidity. x%Co−Al4B6O15 is an anhydrous borate and was prepared by high temperature calcination method, therefore Brønsted acid centers are supposed to be mostly destroyed due to the weaker stability of Brønsted acid sites (i. e., B−OH or Al−OH groups) in the lattice of x%Co−Al4B6O15 under high temperatures, while Lewis acid centers will become dominant on the catalyst surface. In-situ Py-IR is efficient to identify the type and strength of solid acid sites. When the probe molecule alkaline pyridine was exposed to x%Co−Al4B6O15 catalyst, it will be adsorbed at different acid sites to form pyridinium ions or coordinately bonded complexes. Because the different absorption states of pyridine molecules can give obviously different characteristic peaks, Brønsted and Lewis acid sites are therefore clearly differentiated according to the resultant new peaks at different wavenumbers.
Figure 7 gives the FTIR spectra of pyridine molecules adsorbed on the surface of 8 %Co−Al4B6O15 catalyst at different temperatures. Some distinct absorption bands appear clearly at the characteristic wavenumbers due to the different vibration modes of pyridine molecules chemisorbed at different acid sites. In detail, two much stronger peaks at 1445 and 1608 cm−1 commonly ascribe to Lewis acid sites, while another peak around 1492 cm−1 attributes to pyridine adsorption at both Lewis and Brønsted acid sites.36, 37 It is also obvious that the characteristic peak originating from pyridine adsorption on Brønsted acid sites (∼1540 cm−1) is very weak, indicating there are barely Brønsted acid sites on the catalyst surface. Above in situ Py-IR results agree well with the structural features of x%Co−Al4B6O15, most of acid sites reasonably attribute to substituted Co2+ atoms and belong to the Lewis acid centers. Approximately, the relative number of Brønsted and Lewis acid sites (B/L) can be determined with the area ratio of two peaks at 1540 cm−1 and 1445 cm−1. As indicated in Figure 7, the B/L proportion has a huge decline from 0.12 to 0.02 when degassing temperature changes from 100 to 350 °C, this result hints that the majority of the acidity originates from the Lewis acid sites and they also possess an obvious acid strength than the Brønsted acid sites.

As discussed above, catalytic activity of x%Co−Al4B6O15 strongly depends on the numbers of active Co2+ sites in the catalyst surface. Interestingly, experimental results indicate the catalytic activity is also presumably related to another important factor, which is Ov. It is found when x%Co−Al4B6O15 catalyst was heated in the H2 flow (denoted as (x%Co−Al4B6O15−H2), it exhibits an obvious increase in the product yield (see Figure 8a). NH3-TPD measurement (see Figure 8b) revealed that the surface acid amount has no obvious change after H2 treatment, implying that the enhancement of catalytic activity is likely related to surface oxygen species, in addition to Co2+ acidic sites. As previously reported, active oxygen species in the solid surface play an important role in many fields such as heterogeneous catalysis, energy storage and energy chemical industry, thus the related theoretical and experimental studies have been widely concerned.1-3, 30

As mentioned earlier, this F-C alkylation reaction belongs to the second-order reaction, and the whole reaction rate should depend on the surface adsorption capacity of both reactants molecules (indole and nitroalkene). For bimolecular reaction system, it generally obeys the Langmuir-Hinshelwood reaction route, the moderate chemisorption and pre-activation for two substrate molecules are imperative to promote the subsequent F-C alkylation reaction. Considering the spatial distance of two reactants, indole and nitroalkene molecules need to be independently pre-adsorbed at two adjacent but different active sites, then these two pre-activated molecules approach to each other and simultaneously give an interdependent cooperation to form new chemical bonds. As indicated in previous studies, nitroalkene and indole molecules are incline to be adsorbed by Co2+ Lewis acid sites and the impendent surface O atoms.31 Therefore, if there are a large amount of unsaturated dangling bonds on the catalyst surface after the severe H2 thermal treatment, these generated active atoms with many lattice defects will accelerate the activation process of chemical bonds.
In order to investigate the promotion effect caused by H2-reduction treatment, Figure 9 gives the XPS spectra of the fresh and H2-treated 8 %Co−Al4B6O15 catalysts. From Co 2p XPS spectra (see Figure 9a), it can be observed the Co 2p peaks have a slight shift towards the higher binding energy (∼0.1 eV) after the hydrogen treatment, implying a decrease in average electron density of Co2+ due to the higher degree of Co2+ unsaturated coordination.38, 39 Figure 9b gives the difference of O 1s spectra between the untreated and H2-treated 8 %Co−Al4B6O15. The broad O 1s spectra can be deconvoluted into two peaks by a Gaussian peak fitting method. The O 1s signal at 531.5 and 532.3 eV could be ascribed to lattice oxygen (Olatt) and surface chemisorbed oxygen species (Oads), respectively.40-42 As reported, H2 reduction at higher temperature can destroy the balance of O species on the catalyst surface, it will promote the successive transformation from surface lattice oxygen (Olatt) to surface adsorbed oxygen (Oads).2, 24, 30, 41 After the H2 treatment, the Oads/Olatt molar ratio obviously increases from 0.31 to 0.46, these newly-formed surface adsorbed oxygen can function as active sites to interact with the N−H group of indole molecules, thus can greatly increase the nucleophilic capacity of indole ring and facilitate closer contact between these two substrates.31

Based on the above results and evidences, a typical dual-site catalyst was simply induced by the low-valent Co2+ doping and the crystal structure transition from Al4B6O15 to 8 %Co−Al4B6O15 as shown in Figure 10. In such a substitution process of Co2+-to-Al3+, the 6-coordinated [AlO6] groups have become the 4-coordinated [CoO4], some oxygen defects will reasonably be generated in order to balance charge, therefore some type of Oads species can be subsequently formed in these defect sites. In view of this, a catalytic mechanism for the F-C alkylation reaction between indole and β-nitrostyrene in the presence of x%Co−Al4B6O15 has been proposed (see Figure 11).31, 32, 43 Initially, the Co2+ sites act as the electron pair acceptor and Lewis acid sites to interact with the nitro group of β-nitrostyrene, improving the electrophilic reactivity of the aliphatic carbon atom and accepting the attack from indole ring. Meanwhile, the active oxygen species Oads on the catalyst surface interact with the N−H group of indoles, increasing the nucleophilicity of C3 position and promoting two substrates efficiently close to form the alkylated products.31, 32 Thus, this synergistic effect between Lewis acid sites and active surface oxygen species play a critical role for boosting the catalytic activity for the F-C alkylation reaction between indole and β-nitrostyrene.

Conclusion
A series of Co2+ doped octahedra-based aluminoborate x%Co−Al4B6O15 catalysts with different Lewis acid amounts were synthesized and their catalytic activity were evaluated in the F-C alkylation reactions of β-nitrostyrene with various indoles, where the 8 %Co−Al4B6O15 shows the highest catalytic activity (98 %). A systematic study including XRD, BET, TEM, ICP-OES, XPS, NH3-TPD and in situ Py-IR verifies that aliovalent substitution of Co2+ introduces abundant medium-strength Lewis acid sites, and the acid amount increases with the increasing Co2+ concentration. The kinetic study indicated that this F-C alkylation reaction belongs to the second-order reaction and it has a low apparent activation energy (∼33 kJ ⋅ mol−1). Furthermore, abundant surface reactive oxygen species can be obtained by hydrogen treatment on x%Co−Al4B6O15, which enhanced the interactions with the N−H group of an indole, further increases the nucleophilicity of indole ring and facilitates close contact between two substrates. In mechanism, the highly efficient catalytic activity to the alkylation reaction is attributed to the synergistic effect from Lewis acid sites and active surface oxygen species, which were simply induced by Co2+ to Al3+ substitution into the Al4B6O15 lattice. This work provides a novel perspective for developing highly efficient heterogeneous catalyst via a synergistic effect.
Experimental Section
The Co2+-substituted aluminoborate (Al4B6O15) catalysts were synthesized via a two-step strategy. First, the precursors (i. e., x%Co substituted HAl3B6O12(OH)4 were prepared by the boric acid flux method; second, the as-prepared precursors were heated at 680 °C for 3 h to obtain the target catalysts. Here, x% is the molar ratio of Co2+-to-Al3+ substitution. See more details in the Supporting Information. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns were obtained on a PANalytical Empyrean powder diffractometer equipped with a PIXcel 1D detector (CuKα radiation 1.5406 Å). The Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) specific surface areas of the catalysts were measured by N2 adsorption at 77 K on a Quantachrome Quadrasorb SI analyzer. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was performed on a FEI Talos 200S electron microscope operated at 200 kV and the elemental mapping data were collected by an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). The concentration of cobalt was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES) on ThermoFisher ICAP-6300. XPS experiments were conducted on a ThermoFisher ESCALAB 250Xi with a monochromatic Al X-ray source. The electron binding energy of the C 1s (284.6 eV) was used as reference for the calibration of binding energy. Temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) was carried out on a Quantachrome ChemBET Pulsar instrument. In situ pyridine adsorption infrared spectroscopy (Py-IR) was performed on a Bruker Tensor 27 instrument.
In a typical run of F-C alkylation reaction, 0.24 mmol of indole, 0.2 mmol of β-nitrostyrene, 40 mg of catalyst were added to 4 mL of solvent in a 10 mL glass flask under stirring and then maintained at 70 °C for the required reaction time. After cooling to room temperature and removing the solid catalyst by centrifugation, a small amount of supernatant was drawn out with a syringe for further analysis. The remaining solution was purified by column chromatography (silica gel 200–300 mesh) and eluted with ethyl acetate and petroleum ether (1 : 10) to afford the corresponding pure products. The conversion and selectivity were determined by a gas chromatography (GC, SHIMADZU GC2010 plus) equipped with an AOC20i auto-injector. A capillary column (HP-VOC, length 60 m, inner diameter 0.32 mm, film thickness 1.80 μm) was used to separate the organic components under the following operating condition: 160 °C for capillary column, 300 °C for injector port, 320 °C for FID detector. The yield of product was calculated by multiplying β-nitrostyrene conversion and product selectivity, and the turnover number (TON) was calculated by dividing the moles of consumed substrate (β-nitrostyrene) by the moles of used catalyst.
The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS, Agilent 7890 N) and nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR, Agilent DD2 600 MHz) were employed to determine the molecular structure of all five obtained products (1 a–5 a), and the relevant data are presented in Figures S1–S10. Needle-like single crystals were obtained for 1 a, 2 a and 4 a through a slow evaporation of solvent, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected to determine their crystal structure on an Agilent SuperNova diffractometer equipped with a CCD detector and MoKα radiation (λ=0.71073 Å). The crystal structures were solved by direct method and refined by full-matrix least-squares fitting on F2 using SHELX-97. Crystallographic data and structure refinements are summarized in Tables S1–S3. The overall crystal structures are also provided in Figures S11–S13.
