Soot oxidation over V/ZSM-5 catalysts in a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor: Performance enhancement by transition metal (Mn, Co and Fe) doping
The oxidation of soot particles over a series of M-V/ZSM-5 (M = Mn, Co and Fe) catalysts was examined in a cylindrical dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor. Soot particles were completely removed in plasma reactor at 60th minute of reaction. The Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst showed higher catalytic activity of soot particles than Co-V/ZSM-5, Fe-V/ZSM-5 and VOx/ZSM-5 catalyst in the plasma reactor. However, the variation in CO2 selectivity was opposite to the change in soot oxidation rate. Catalyst characterizations of N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS) and temperature programmed reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR) were performed to gain insights of the relationships between catalyst properties and performance of plasma-catalytic soot oxidation. The results substantiated that the concentration of Oads had the most significant effect on the soot oxidation process, while the specific surface area of the M-V/ZSM-5 catalysts showed only minor influence. Moreover, the relative contents of oxygen and V5+ species of the M-V/ZSM-5 catalysts were also the major factors affecting soot oxidation. In addition, higher discharge power and oxygen content were conducive to accelerating soot oxidation. The stability tests showed that the Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst maintained good catalytic activity after three cycles of plasma-induced experiments.
1. Introduction
Diesel engines, with the advantages of low fuel consumption, good durability and high-torque at low-speed, has been widely used as the major power source of automobile and marine transportation [1]. However, the environment and human health would be seriously harmed by soot emissions from diesel engines. Diesel particulate filter (DPF) has been widely acknowledged as the most effective way for soot particle capture. The DPF would be plugged by soot particles after a certain operation period. Thus, the back pressure would increase in the exhaust system and reduce the efficiency of the engine [2]. For DPF regeneration methods, it mainly included fuel injection combustion regeneration, electric heating regeneration, microwave heating regeneration and catalytic regeneration, etc. [3]. As an emerging alternative for DPF regeneration, the loading of a heterogeneous catalyst on DPF, also known as the catalytic DPF, has shown great potential [4]. The presence of catalyst could reduce soot ignition temperature and extend the lifetime of DPF [5]. In the running stages of diesel engines, however, exhaust temperatures were still much lower than the soot ignition temperature. Therefore, DPF regeneration technologies still need to be sufficiently improved.
The application of plasma-catalysis technology has been widely reported in the purification of gas streams containing CO, NOx, benzene and toluene, etc., in large volumes and low concentrations with the unique characteristics of rapid response and mild reaction conditions [6]. In plasma-catalytic systems, a chemically reactive environment with abundant energetic electrons and oxidative species could be generated by plasma, which would facilitate the subsequent oxidation of soot particles into harmless final products in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts [7]. More recently, researchers found that plasma-catalysis technology showed great potentials in soot oxidation and the catalyst composition had an important role on the system performance. Liu et al. reported the soot oxidation rate in plasma over MnOx/CeO2 was significantly improved to 85.2 % compared with that of 23.4 % over CeO2 at the discharge power of 18 W [8]. Liu et al. found that soot oxidation rate and CO2 selectivity were 63 % and 90 % in an integrated plasma-La1−xAgxMn1−yCoyO3-δ system, respectively, while the soot oxidation rate and CO2 selectivity increased with the increasing of Ag content. The interactions between Ag and LaMnO3 species greatly improved the soot oxidation process below 200 °C in the plasma environment [9]. We previously found maximum soot oxidation rates of 100 %, 100 %, 99 % and 92 % at 20 W and 25 °C, over a series of V/KIT-6, V/SBA-15, V/ZSM-5 and V/SiO2 catalysts [10].
Vanadium oxides have been widely used in selective catalytic reduction of NOx and catalytic oxidation of organic compounds due to their relative low cost and various valence states [11]. The doping effects between vanadium and other metal species could effectively improve the catalytic activity. Liu et al. reported that with the increase of V/Mn molar ratio from 0.03 to 0.06, the formaldehyde oxidation rate was significantly improved from 37 % to 72 % over the MnO2/Mn2V2O7 catalysts at 30 °C [12]. Le et al. stated that the highest catalytic activity (95.5 %) in oleic acid oxidative dehydrogenation was achieved over the MgO-VKIT-6 catalyst at 450 °C, while the value over undoped VKIT-6 was only 76 % [13]. Huang et al. reported that the Sn-CeVO4 catalyst showed the highest catalytic activity (90 %) in NO conversion at 200 °C, which was only 80 % over CeVO4 [14]. However, as far as the authors are concerned, vanadium-based catalysts for catalytic soot oxidation, especially their doping effect in plasma environments, have rarely been reported. In addition, the underlying mechanisms of the reaction process are far from clearly understood.
In the present work, several M-V/ZSM-5 (M = Mn, Co and Fe) catalysts were synthesized by impregnation method, which was compared with the VOx/ZSM-5 prepared by the same method. And the effects of oxygen content and discharge power on the reaction process were analyzed. The structural and chemical properties of the M-V/ZSM-5 catalysts were studied utilizing N2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS) and temperature-programmed reduction by H2 (H2-TPR). Finally, we proposed the possible reaction mechanisms of plasma-catalytic soot oxidation over the M-V/ZSM-5 catalysts.

2.1. Materials
Ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3, GR), Oxalic acid dihydrate (C2H2O4·2H2O, GR), manganous nitrate (MnN2O6, AR), cobaltous nitrate hexahydrate (CoN2O6·6H2O, AR), ferric nitrate nonahydrate (FeN3O9·9H2O, AR) were purchased from Macklin Co., Ltd. ZSM-5 type zeolite were supplied from the Chemical Plant of Nankai University. Without further purification, all reagents were used as received.
2.2. Preparation of M-V/ZSM-5 (M = Mn, Co and Fe)
The M-V/ZSM-5 (M = Mn, Co and Fe) catalysts used in this study were prepared using wetness impregnation method. As with the preparation of Mn-V/ZSM-5, the preparation process was as follows. The predetermined amounts of NH4VO3 (0.1146 g), C2H2O4·2H2O (0.2471 g) and MnN2O6 (0.0310 g) were dissolved in deionized water and stirred continuously for 30 min. A calculated amount of the ZSM-5 support (4.9000 g) was then added to the obtained solution. Secondly, the samples were transferred to a water bath and magnetically stirred for 5 h at 80 °C. The mixture was dried at 110 °C in air for another 12 h. Finally, the resulting product was calcined at 550 °C for 5 h.
The mixture was dried at 110 °C in air for another 12 h. Finally, the resulting product was calcined at 550 °C for 5 h. The obtained catalyst was denoted as Mn-V/ZSM-5. The loading amount of vanadium species and transition metal (Mn, Co and Fe) were both 1 wt%. The total loading amount of metal elements was 2 wt% for each catalyst.
2.3. Catalyst characterizations
The surface area and average pore size distribution were measured by N2 adsorption-desorption isotherms at − 196 °C using an Autosorb-iQ instrument. Based on Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) methods, specific surface areas were calculated. The Barrett-Joyner-Halenda (BJH) method was employed to calculate the total pore volume and average pore size distribution in the samples.
X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Rikagu D/max-2000 with Cu Kα radiation and a scanning rate of 10° min−1 in the 2θ range of 20–80° was used. The Scherrer's equation was used to calculate crystalline size.
In order to understand the chemical valence states of catalysts, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted on a Thermo Escalab 250Xi system with Al Kα radiation. The binding energies were calibrated by C 1s photoelectron peak at 284.8 eV.
The temperature programmed reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR) experiment was carried out on an AutochemII 2920 apparatus. To remove impurities, 100 mg catalysts were pretreated at 300 °C for 1 h and then cooled down subsequently to room temperature. Lastly, the catalysts were heated to 850 °C in a 10 vol% H2/Ar feeding gas flow (30 mL·min−1) at a rate of 10 °C min−1. The amount of H2 consumption was calculated based on the H2-TPR profiles.
2.4. Experimental system
The schematic diagram of the plasma-catalytic soot oxidation system in this work can be seen in Fig. 1. The system included a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor, a high voltage power supply (Suman CTP-2000 K), an air supply system and the analytical instrumentations. The Printex-U (Degussa, 20–30 nm) was used as the model soot in this work. In this work, the oxygen content was fixed at 10 vol% to simulate the real diesel exhaust emission conditions [15]. The simulated carrier gas for the test contained 10 vol% O2 with N2 as balance gas. The total flow rate of the simulated gas was 500 mL·min−1. The gas streams were premixed before entering the DBD reactor.

Fig. 1. Experimental setup of plasma-catalytic soot oxidation.
The DBD reactor was made of a quartz tube with the wall thickness of 1 mm and internal diameter of 8 mm. The outer surface of the quartz tube was covered with a stainless-steel mesh (60 mm in length) which acted as a ground electrode. A stainless-steel rod of 4 mm diameter was fixed on the quartz tube's axis as the high voltage electrode. During each test, the weighed amount of catalyst powder (90 mg) and soot particles (10 mg) were added to the crucible. The soot particles and catalyst powder were gently stirred with a spatula for 10 min to obtain loose contact. The mixture of catalyst and soot was packed and held inside the DBD reactor by quartz wool. Because of quartz wool had high thermal insulation performance and high insulation properties, it was widely used in plasma catalytic oxidation experiments [16]. In this work, the shape of the Lissajous figure was displayed on an oscilloscope, and the area of the Lissajous figure was calculated by the data processing software.
The current and voltage signals were recorded by an oscilloscope (Tektronix TDS2024C), and the discharge power was calculated using the Lissajous method as follows:

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Textural properties
Fig. 2 shows that M-V/ZSM-5 (M = Mn, Co and Fe) catalysts possess Type I isotherms, indicating the existence of regular micropores structure of M-V/ZSM-5 (M = Mn, Co and Fe) catalysts was retained [17]. The VOx/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits the largest specific surface area of 399.6 m2 g−1, followed by Fe-V/ZSM-5 (382.3 m2 g−1), Co-V/ZSM-5 (348.7 m2 g−1) and Mn-V/ZSM-5 (351.6 m2 g−1) as given in Table 1. The pore volumes of the M-V/ZSM-5 catalysts (0.20–0.21 cm3 g−1) are slightly lower than that of VOx/ZSM-5 (0.22 cm3 g−1), while the average pore sizes were slightly higher (roughly 0.16–0.18 nm) than that of VOx/ZSM-5 (2.12 nm). The doping of active metal onto VOx/ZSM-5 may cover the VOx/ZSM-5 surface, causing part of the pores within the ZSM-5 support to be blocked, leading to the decrease in the SBET value and pore volume of the M-V/ZSM-5 catalysts. Mhamdi et al. reported similar results in his study using V-Mo-ZSM-5 catalysts for selective catalytic reduction of NOx by ammonia [18].

Fig. 3 presents the XRD patterns of the M-V/ZSM-5 (M = Mn, Co and Fe) catalysts. Overall, the XRD patterns of all catalysts match the orthorhombic phase of ZSM-5 (PDF#44-0003) well. The M-V/ZSM-5 samples present intense diffraction peaks at the 2
of 7.9°, 8.8°, 23.1° and 23.8°, which can be attributed to the (1 0 1), (0 2 0), (5 0 1) and (3 0 3) planes of ZSM-5 crystal. No diffraction peaks of Mn, Co and Fe species are observed in the XRD patterns. It could probably be attributed to the highly dispersion of metal dopants on the surface of ZSM-5, suggesting that the original structure of ZSM-5 is maintained after metal doping and calcination [19]. Panahi also reported similar results in his work using Cu, Mn, Co and Fe doped ZSM-5 composite oxide catalysts for selective catalytic reduction of NO with NH3 [20].

3.2. Redox properties
The V 2p spectra of the M-V/ZSM-5 (M = Mn, Co, and Fe) catalysts are shown in Fig. 4(a). The peaks of V 2p3/2 and V 2p1/2 are observed around 524 eV and 517 eV, respectively. Two peaks at 517.2 and 516.3 eV are observed after the deconvolution of V 2p3/2 orbits for M-V/ZSM-5 catalysts. The former peak could be ascribed to the V5+ species, while the latter one belongs to the V4+ species [21]. The relative concentration of V5+ species, defined as V5+/(V4++V5+), followed the order of Mn-V/ZSM-5 (82.3 %), Co-V/ZSM-5 (79.2 %), Fe-V/ZSM-5 (76.7 %) and VOx/ZSM-5 (71.8 %), respectively. The Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst possesses the highest relative concentration of V5+/(V4++V5+) compared to other catalysts.

Fig. 4(b) shows the O 1s spectra of the M-V/ZSM-5 (M = Mn, Co and Fe) catalysts. The peaks between 531.3 eV and 532.2 eV are attributed to the lattice oxygen species (Olatt), while the peaks around 532.7–533.5 eV are correlated with the adsorbed oxygen species (Oads) [22]. The research showed that the adsorbed oxygen species (Oads) came from ZSM-5 support, the active metal and the interactions between them over M-V/ZSM-5 (M = Mn, Co and Fe) catalysts [23], [24], [25]. Table 2 shows that the relative concentration of Oads, defined as Oads/(Oads+Olatt) of the M-V/ZSM-5 catalysts. The values are in the order of Mn-V/ZSM-5 (40.0 %) > Co-V/ZSM-5 (38.3 %) > Fe-V/ZSM-5 (37.1 %) > VOx/ZSM-5 (36.4 %). It is widely reported that the Oads species are closely associated with the oxygen vacancies on the catalyst surfaces [26]. Xu et al. reported the use of reduced LaCo0.94Pt0.06O3 catalysts at different temperatures for soot oxidation. The results showed that LaCoPt0.06 reduced at 350 °C exhibited the highest catalytic activity, which was attributed to its highest Oads concentration (63.9 %) [27]. In addition, the activation of lattice oxygen required higher energy in catalytic reactions compared to Oads. In other word, Oads could be more easily activated and participate in the soot oxidation on the catalyst surface. As a result, the catalyst with a higher Oads/(Oads+Olatt) value may effectively enhance the heterogeneous catalytic reactions.
Table 2. The reducibility of M-V/ZSM-5 (M = Mn, Co and Fe) catalysts.
Catalyst H2 consumption (mmol g−1) V5+/(V4++V5+) (%) Oads/(Oads+Olatt)
(%)
Mn-V/ZSM-5 0.18 82.3 40.0
Co-V/ZSM-5 0.17 79.2 38.3
Fe-V/ZSM-5 0.17 76.7 37.1
VOx/ZSM-5 0.08 71.8 36.4
The reducibility of the M-V/ZSM-5 (M = Mn, Co and Fe) catalysts was analyzed using the H2-TPR experiment (Fig. 5). The H2-TPR profile of VOx/ZSM-5 shows a major reduction peak at 502 °C, which could be attributed to the reduction of V5+ to V3+ [21]. The H2-TPR profiles of Fe-V/ZSM-5 shows three major reduction peaks at 362 °C, 472 °C and 714 °C, respectively. The first peak around 362 °C belongs to the reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+, while the second and third peaks at 472 °C and 714 °C are associated to the reduction of V5+ to V3+ and FeO to Fe, respectively [28]. In the case of Co-V/ZSM-5, the predominant reduction peaks are observed at 378 °C and 574 °C, which indicate the reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ and V5+ to V3+, respectively, on the catalyst surface [29]. Compared with VOx/ZSM-5, the H2-TPR profile of Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst exhibits a single peak centered at 498 °C, which is composed of both the reduction of Mn4+ to Mn3+ and V5+ to V3+ [30]. Among the tested samples, the Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst shows the highest H2 consumption amount of 0.18 mmol g−1, followed by Co-V/ZSM-5 (0.17 mmol g−1), Fe-V/ZSM-5 (0.17 mmol g−1) and VOx/ZSM-5 (0.08 mmol g−1) as shown in Table 2. In the process of temperature programmed reduction of hydrogen (H2-TPR), the hydrogen consumption amount represents the amount of oxygen species that the catalyst could provide. This result was consistent with the O 1s spectra of the M-V/ZSM-5 (M = Mn, Co and Fe) catalysts as shown in Fig. 4. Zhang et al. reported that the desorption temperature of adsorbed oxygen was below 500 °C [31]. These results suggested that the Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst may possess better reducibility and the most abundant surface-adsorbed oxygen species (Oads), which could facilitate the oxidation reaction on its surfaces.

3.3. Effect of catalyst composition
Fig. 6 shows the Lissajous figures of the M-V/ZSM-5 (M = Mn, Co and Fe) and VOx/ZSM-5 packed plasma reactor at a constant discharge power of 20 W. Doping transition metals on VOx/ZSM-5 changed the shape of the Lissajous figures from oval to a parallelogram, indicating changes in the discharge characteristics under different packing conditions. In dielectric barrier discharge, the discharge mode was mainly a combination of surface discharge and weak filamentary discharge. Since the active components of the catalyst were different, the conductivity, pore volume and average pore diameter of the catalyst would change, which would affect the discharge characteristics on catalyst surfaces. Mei et al. reported that loading the reactive metal on γ-Al2O3 exhibits similar phenomena of shape changing [32]. It is worthy to note that at the same discharge power, the peak-to-peak applied voltage of the DBD reactor over VOx/ZSM-5 is 14.8 kVpk-pk, while it increases to around 15.2 kVpk-pk for the DBD reactor packed with M-V/ZSM-5 catalysts, indicating an increased voltage in the presence of M-V/ZSM-5 catalysts at the same discharge power. In the process of plasma discharge, the increase of electric field intensity would lead to the increase of current density. The higher current density would effectively promote the production of high energy electrons and radicals in the reactor, while the high energy electrons were the driving force for the production of active oxygen species. Jang et al. reported that the electric field strength was proportional to the current density, which could be expressed as the discharge power per unit area [33]. The electric field of DBD reactor could be consequently enhanced, which would facilitate the soot oxidation process.

Fig. 7(a) shows the effect of M-V/ZSM-5 (M = Mn, Co and Fe) catalysts on plasma-catalytic soot oxidation at the discharge power of 20 W. As the reaction progresses, it is clear that the soot oxidation rate increases regardless of catalyst type. Compared to VOx/ZSM-5 catalyst, the combination of transition metal doped with VOx/ZSM-5 catalyst and plasma significantly improves the soot oxidation rate. The highest soot oxidation rate can be obtained using the Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst, with 100 % oxidation rates at the60th minute. The soot oxidation rates are in the order of Mn-V/ZSM-5 > Co-V/ZSM-5 > Fe-V/ZSM-5 > VOx/ZSM-5 during the whole reaction process, as the soot oxidation rates are 19.7 %, 16.9 % and 9.6 % higher, respectively, after introducing Mn-V/ZSM-5, Co-V/ZSM-5, Fe-V/ZSM-5 catalysts in the plasma region at 30th minute compared with the VOx/ZSM-5 packed DBD reactor. Fig. 7(b) shows the CO2 selectivity of the plasma-catalytic soot oxidation process over the M-V/ZSM-5 catalysts. The CO2 selectivity gradually increases with the reaction time, while the using of M-V/ZSM-5 catalyst decreases the CO2 selectivity of plasma-catalytic process. The order of CO2 selectivity at 60th minute was as follows, namely VOx/ZSM-5 (54.0 %) > Fe-V/ZSM-5 (53.3 %) > Co-V/ZSM-5 (52.9 %) > Mn-V/ZSM-5 (52.2 %).

Fig. 7. Performance of plasma-catalytic soot oxidation over M-V/ZSM-5 (M = Mn, Co and Fe) catalysts at the discharge power of 20 W: (a) Soot oxidation rate and (b) CO2 selectivity.
Firstly, soot oxidation was initiated by the plasma-generated energetic electrons. The inelastic collisions between energetic electrons and O2 resulted in the generation of O radicals and O3, etc., which would trigger a range of subsequent chemical reactions [34]. Moreover, the plasma discharge region would be expanded and intensified within the packed-bed layer, which could contribute to the generation of O radicals and O3 [35]. Subsequently, the O radicals and O3 can diffuse onto the catalyst surface for further reactions with the adjacent soot particles. It was reported that the surfaces of soot particles contained both active and inactive sites. The inactive sites could be oxidized and form active sites, while the active sites would undergo a series of reaction with O radicals and O3 in the gas phase or on catalyst surface to form surface adsorbed CO and CO2 species [36]. These adsorbed species could be further desorbed into CO and CO2 in the effluent. In addition, considering the activation energy of soot oxidation to CO (ΔH= −110 kJ mol−1) and CO2 (ΔH= −394 kJ mol−1), the formation of CO was more likely during the plasma-catalytic soot oxidation process. Thus, the CO2 selectivity of the process was relatively low [37].
Besides the gas-phase reactions, plasma-catalytic soot oxidation could also be promoted by the M-V/ZSM-5 catalysts. The excellent performance over Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst can be attributed to some closely related factors. Although the VOx/ZSM-5 catalyst had the largest specific surface area of 399.6 m2 g−1, it exhibited the lowest soot oxidation rate. This result indicated that SBET may not be a critical factor affecting the performance of plasma-catalytic oxidation. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the highest V5+ concentration was observed over Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst. Fully oxidized vanadium species (V5+) were considered to be an important species in the redox cycles of vanadium based catalyst since they were not tightly bonded on the zeolite support and could be used for the oxidation of surface adsorbed intermediates and soot particles [38]. Thus, more V5+ species could be another reason for the better performance of plasma-induced soot oxidation over the Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst, The XPS spectra of O 1s showed that the relative concentration of Oads/(Oads+Olatt) of the Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst was much higher than that of other three catalysts. It was generally believed that Oads driving surface reactions are the primary reaction process to generate the final products of CO and CO2 products in the plasma-catalytic systems. The Oads species possessed better mobility than Olatt species and could directly participate in catalytic soot oxidation reaction via the contact points between catalysts and soot particles [39]. In addition, the H2-TPR profiles also demonstrated that the Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst had the best reducibility compared with other samples. Meanwhile, the Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst had the highest hydrogen consumption of 0.18 mmol g−1, which indicated that oxygen species over M-V/ZSM-5 catalyst surface was much easier to be activated during the catalytic reaction. The consumed Oads species would be replenished by the plasma-generated O radicals and O3, etc [40]. As a result, integrating the plasma with the M-V/ZSM-5 catalysts significantly promoted soot oxidation.
3.4. Effect of operating parameters
3.4.1. Effect of discharge power
Fig. 8(a) shows the effect of discharge power on the plasma-catalytic soot oxidation rate over the Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst. The soot oxidation rate rises monotonically with increasing discharge power over the Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst from 16 W to 24 W. The oxidation rate of Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst increases from 61 % to 82.1 % at 30th minute of the reaction in the tested discharge power range. After 60 min of reaction, the soot oxidation rate at each discharge power could reach 100 %. It is generally recognized that the energetic electrons generated by plasma are the driving force of plasma-induced reactions. The effective collisions between energetic electrons and carrier gas molecules could facilitate the generation of chemically reactive species, including O radical and O3, etc., these species could further react with soot particles to form CO and CO2 [41]. At higher discharge power, the generation of more energetic electrons and reactive species would be more conducive to accelerating the soot oxidation of the plasma-catalytic process. Fig. 8(b) shows the effect of the discharge power on the CO2 selectivity of plasma-catalytic soot oxidation over the Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalysts. The CO2 selectivity gradually decreases with the increasing discharge power over the Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalysts. When the discharge power increases from 16 W to 20 W, the values for Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst decreases from 57.1 % to 51.9 %.

3.4.2. Effect of oxygen content
Fig. 9 shows the effect of oxygen content on soot oxidation at the discharge power of 20 W over Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst. It is found that the soot oxidation rate increases with the increasing oxygen content from 5 % to 20 %. For example, the soot oxidation rate at the 30th minute is 84.4 %, which is 19.3 % higher than that in the case of 5 % oxygen content. As with the CO2 selectivity, the values were almost the same (around 51.9–54.0 %) with the increasing oxygen content at the 30th minute of the plasma-catalytic reaction.

Fig. 9. Effect of oxygen content on plasma-catalytic soot oxidation over Mn-V/ZSM-5 at the discharge power of 20 W: (a) soot oxidation rate and (b) CO2 selectivity.
Oxygen content was a significant factor in plasma-induced oxidation processes [42]. In oxygen-containing plasma, reactive oxygen radicals and O3 could be generated and act as the main reactive species for plasma-induced soot oxidation reactions [15]. Oads, O radicals and O3 species could participate in the catalytic soot oxidation in the presence of oxygen vacancies. Whilst the consumed Oads could be replenished by O3 and O radicals formed via plasma reaction [43]. Meanwhile these species could be transported onto the surfaces of Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst and initiate the step-wise oxidation of carbon elements to CO and CO2. With the increase of oxygen content, more reactive O radicals and O3 could be formed due to higher probability of electron-impact dissociation of O2 molecules. Thus, soot oxidation rate would increase at higher oxygen content. However, the reaction pathways remained unchanged, which could be proved by the similar values of CO2 selectivity at different oxygen contents [40].
3.4.3. Stability test
The stability test of the plasma-catalytic system for soot oxidation over the Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst was performed for three consecutive times (in Fig. 10). It could be seen that the soot oxidation rate slightly decreases with the increasing cycle number of plasma-catalytic process. For example, the soot oxidation rate over Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalyst at 15th minute decreases from 41.0 % to 39.4 %, while the value at the 30th minute decreases from 78.3 % to 72.4 %. By the end of the reaction, the soot oxidation rate was 100 % for all three cycles. It could be deduced from the results that the plasma-catalytic system maintained relatively good performance and showed good stability over the Mn-V/ZSM-5 catalysts after the cycle test. The decrease in oxidation reaction rate could be well ascribed to the consumption of Oads species on the catalyst surfaces, which has been widely recognized in plasma-catalytic soot oxidation and various volatile organic compounds [44].

4. Conclusion
Plasma-catalytic soot oxidation has been conducted over transition metal M (M = Mn, Co and Fe) doped VOx/ZSM-5 catalysts. The soot oxidation rate followed the order of Mn-V/ZSM-5 > Co-V/ZSM-5 > Fe-V/ZSM-5 > VOx/ZSM-5, while the CO2 selectivity of the process follows the opposite order of oxidation rate over the tested catalysts. The effects of discharge power and oxygen content in the carrier gas on plasma-catalytic soot oxidation were also systematically analyzed, while increased discharge power and oxygen content were beneficial for soot oxidation. The stability tests showed that after three cycle experiments, the soot oxidation rate was almost maintained. Interestingly, the CO2 selectivity decreases with the increase in soot oxidation rate.
The results from N2 adsorption-desorption and XRD showed that the textural properties including specific surface area, average pore size and crystal structure may not be the significant factors affecting the performance of plasma-catalytic soot oxidation. Combining the results of XPS and H2-TPR, higher Oads/(Oads+Olatt), V5+ concentration and H2 consumption values were closely related with the abundant oxygen vacancies on its surfaces since the order of reaction performance was the same with these factors. To sum up, the plasma-induced surface reactions over the M-V/ZSM-5 (M = Mn, Co and Fe) catalysts were crucial for the oxidation of soot particles with the help of plasma-generated reactive species, while specific catalyst properties played a vital role on the performance of the plasma-catalytic system.
