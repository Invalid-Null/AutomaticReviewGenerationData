 After reviewing the document, I do not believe it is directly related to propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH). The document discusses soot oxidation over metal-doped vanadium catalysts in a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma reactor. It does not mention propane, propylene, PDH, or ODH.
