Origin of the Robust Catalytic Performance of Nanodiamond–Graphene-Supported Pt Nanoparticles Used in the Propane Dehydrogenation Reaction

Abstract
Nanocarbon-supported Pt nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared and tested for the propane dehydrogenation reaction (PDH). The nanocarbon support is composed of a nanodiamond core and a defective, ultrathin graphene nanoshell (ND@G). The Pt/ND@G catalyst experienced slight deactivation during the 100 h PDH test, while the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst showed severe deactivation after the 20 h PDH test. Pt NPs exhibited superior sintering resistance versus that of the ND@G support. This particular support structure of ND@G allows electrons on the defects to transfer to the Pt NPs, leading to a strong metal–support interaction, which significantly prevents Pt NP sintering and promotes the desorption of electron-rich propylene. This electron transfer mechanism was also confirmed by a CO catalytic oxidation test.

Introduction
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
Propylene is an important feedstock for manufacturing polymers, oxygenates, and other intermediates in the chemical industry. (1) The worldwide demand for propylene has increased substantially because of the need for its downstream products. Among the various new approaches, the propane dehydrogenation (PDH) route is recognized as the most competitive technique for producing propylene because of the profits from the U.S. shale revolution. (2) The U.S. shale revolution is increasing the production of light alkanes; concurrently, the price of propane is decreasing. Al2O3-supported Pt nanoparticles (NPs) are high-efficiency catalysts for PDH. However, the strong acidity of the Al2O3 support, (3) weak interaction between the Pt NPs and Al2O3, (2, 4) and electron-deficient Pt NPs (5-7) can induce carbon deposition and reduce the stability of the catalyst. Promoters (8, 9) and alternative support materials (7, 10, 11) have been explored to improve the catalytic performance; however, it is still a challenge to develop supported Pt NPs with a robust catalytic activity for the high-temperature PDH reaction.
Nanocarbons, such as carbon nanotubes and nanodiamonds, are outstanding catalyst supports for dehydrogenation, oxidation, and other reactions. (12-16) Nanocarbons have several advantages as supports. The acidity of the nanocarbons is weak and tunable, (17) which can decrease the level of coke formation during PDH. Additionally, the large pore diameter and surface area of the nanocarbons can help to increase coke resistance. (18) Finally, the metallic or semimetallic nature of the nanocarbons ensures stronger electronic interactions with the metal catalysts. (19) These unique properties provide nanocarbons with the ability to increase the PDH catalyst stability. However, there are no reports of the application of nanocarbon-supported Pt NPs in the high-temperature PDH reaction.
Herein, we present a novel nanocarbon-supported Pt NP catalyst with excellent catalytic activity and stability for the PDH reaction compared to those of the traditional Al2O3-supported Pt catalyst (Pt/Al2O3), the onion-like nanodiamond-supported Pt catalyst [Pt/OLC (Figure S1)], and the commercial active carbon-supported Pt catalyst (Pt/AC). The as-prepared nanocarbon support is composed of a nanodiamond core and a defective, ultrathin graphene nanoshell [ND@G (Figure S1)]. Strong electron transfer between Pt and the defective graphene nanoshell leads to strong metal–support interactions (SMSIs) for the Pt/ND@G catalyst. The SMSIs significantly prevent the agglomeration of Pt NPs, promote desorption of electron-rich propylene from the Pt surface, and effectively improve the catalyst stability. In addition, the strong electron transfer between the Pt NPs and the defective graphene nanoshell was verified by evaluating the CO catalytic oxidation.
Results and Discussion

The catalytic performances of the as-prepared catalysts in the PDH reaction are displayed in Figure 1. Notably, the initial propane rate (i.e., the reaction rate of propane) over the Pt/ND@G catalyst is lower than that over Pt/Al2O3 (Figure 1a), as are the propane conversions (Figure S2a). However, the propane rate of Pt/ND@G gradually increases above that of Pt/Al2O3 as the reaction time increases, and it stabilizes at 1333 mmol g–1 h–1 after the 20 h test (which is 2 times higher than that of Pt/Al2O3, 601 mmol g–1 h–1). Meanwhile, a higher propylene selectivity is obtained for Pt/ND@G (88%) than for Pt/Al2O3 (73%). The propane rate of Pt/ND@G increases from 929 to 1333 mmol g–1 h–1, while that of Pt/Al2O3 decreases rapidly from 1646 to 601 mmol g–1 h–1 after the 20 h test, revealing that the stability of Pt/ND@G is superior to that of Pt/Al2O3. The long-term durability of the Pt/ND@G catalyst is shown in Figure 1b. The propane rate over the Pt/ND@G catalyst remains at 709 mmol g–1 h–1 even after the 100 h test, further demonstrating the high stability of the as-prepared Pt/ND@G catalyst for the high-temperature PDH process. In addition, Pt/OLC and commercial Pt/AC were evaluated as controlled catalysts for the PDH reaction. Pt/OLC possessed a propane rate and a propylene selectivity (81.1%) lower than those of Pt/ND@G after the 20 h test (the propane rate decreased rapidly from 884 to 405 mmol g–1 h–1). There was also a significant decrease in the activity of the commercial Pt/AC catalyst in the PDH process (Figure S2b). In addition, the Pt/ND@G catalyst shows a stability higher than that of the lab-made PtSn/Al2O3 catalyst during the PDH reaction (Figure S3). In general, Pt/ND@G possesses better durability for the high-temperature PDH reaction than the reference catalysts do.

(a) Catalytic performances of the Pt/ND@G, Pt/Al2O3, and Pt/OLC catalysts during a 20 h reaction. (b) Long-term activity of the Pt/ND@G catalyst during a 100 h PDH reaction. The theoretical Pt weight loading for Pt/Al2O3 was 0.3 wt %, and those for Pt/ND@G and Pt/OLC were both 0.5 wt %.
NP sintering is one of the main reasons for catalyst deactivation in the high-temperature PDH reaction. Sintering can decrease the number of active sites for PDH and promote structure-sensitive side reactions, inducing more coke deposits and causing further catalyst deactivation. (2) Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) was employed to monitor the size distributions of the supported Pt NPs before and after the PDH reaction. Figure 2b shows that the sizes of the Pt NPs in the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst are in the range of 1.0–1.5 nm (Figure S4b) after the PDH reaction; however, the fresh Pt NPs have an average size of 0.6 nm (Figure 2a and Figure S4a). These results indicate aggregation of the Pt NPs in the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst. However, the sizes of the Pt NPs in the Pt/ND@G catalyst undergo negligible changes after PDH reaction for 20 h (Figure 2c,d and Figure S4c,d), revealing the superior antisintering ability of the as-prepared Pt/ND@G catalyst in the high-temperature PDH reaction. Additionally, agglomeration of the Pt NPs in the Pt/OLC catalyst after the PDH reaction can also be observed (Figure S5). These results imply that SMSIs may exist between the Pt NPs and the ND@G support, which is necessary to obtain a better durability for the Pt/ND@G catalyst in the PDH process.
Figure 2
Figure 2. Scanning transmission electron microscopy images of fresh and spent (a and b) Pt/Al2O3 and (c and d) Pt/ND@G catalysts, respectively. The spent catalysts were used in a 20 h propane dehydrogenation reaction. The theoretical Pt weight loading for Pt/Al2O3 was 0.3 wt %, and that for Pt/ND@G was 0.5 wt %.
All of the samples with 5 wt % Pt loadings were annealed in N2 at 600 °C for 4 h to investigate the SMSIs between the Pt NPs and ND@G support; the corresponding STEM images are displayed in Figure 3. The sizes of the Pt NPs in the corresponding fresh and annealed Pt/Al2O3 catalysts are 1.8–2.1 and 5.5–6.5 nm, respectively (Figure 3a,b and Figure S6a,b), indicating serious agglomeration of the Pt NPs in the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst after the annealing treatment. However, the sizes of the Pt NPs in Pt/ND@G are essentially unchanged after the annealing process (Figure 3c,d and Figure S6c,d), which indicates that the SMSIs between the Pt NPs and ND@G support inhibit sintering of the Pt NPs during the high-temperature annealing. In addition, the Pt NPs in the Pt/OLC and Pt/AC catalysts showed sintering after the annealing treatment. For example, the Pt NP sizes in the Pt/OLC catalyst increased from 1.5–1.7 to 2.0–2.5 nm; those in the Pt/AC catalyst increased from 1.5–2.0 to 3.0–4.0 nm (Figure 3 and Figures S6 and S7). The annealing experiments confirm that there are SMSIs between the Pt NPs and ND@G support.

The temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) profiles of the Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/ND@G catalysts are shown in Figure 4a. Generally, a higher reduction temperature is attributed to a stronger interaction between the Pt species and the support. (20) The reduction temperature of Pt/ND@G is approximately 50 °C higher than that of Pt/Al2O3, which supports the concept that Pt/ND@G experiences SMSIs (Figures 2 and 3) and stabilizes the Pt NPs from sintering under harsh reaction conditions. The temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) profiles of propylene are shown in Figure 4b. In general, a higher desorption temperature indicates stronger interactions between propylene and the samples. The desorption temperature of Pt/ND@G is approximately 110 °C lower than that of Pt/Al2O3, suggesting a weaker interaction between propylene and Pt/ND@G, which can promote the desorption of electron-rich propylene, suppress the formation and polymerization of coke precursors, further inhibit coke deposition (Table 1 and Figure S8a), (3) and thereby significantly enhance catalytic stability. (5-7) To elucidate the difference in propylene desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to evaluate the electronic states of various supported Pt NPs; significant differences were observed in the spectra (Figure 4c). The binding energy of the Pt 4f core level for Pt/ND@G shifts to a value (70.8 eV) lower than that of Pt/Al2O3 (71.6 eV), which implies a stronger electron transference between the Pt NPs and ND@G support. This can lead to a higher electron density for the Pt NPs and a weaker Pt–(C═C) bond, which enhances the desorption of electron-rich propylene and further leads to the exceptional stability for Pt/ND@G during PDH. Nagai et al. (4) determined that the effect of sintering inhibition on Pt could be dominated by the electron density of oxygen in the support. Thus, the stronger electron transference mentioned above may cause SMSIs for Pt/ND@G.

The theoretical Pt weight loading of each sample was 5 wt % for the XPS analysis, and those for TPR and C3H6-TPD were 0.3 wt % over Pt/Al2O3 and 0.5 wt % over Pt/ND@G.

The Pt/OLC control catalyst was prepared to further clarify the origin of the SMSIs. The considerable propane conversion decrement for Pt/OLC (Figure 1a) suggests that it has a stability lower than that of Pt/ND@G. More coke deposits (Table 1 and Figure S8a) were triggered by metal agglomeration (Figure S5), and they account for the lower durability of Pt/OLC. The dramatic agglomeration after the high-temperature annealing treatment (Figure 3 and Figure S6) indicates that the Pt NPs interact weakly with the OLC support. Therefore, the origin of the SMSIs can be elucidated by comparing the Pt/ND@G and Pt/OLC catalysts.
The binding energy of the Pt 4f electron for Pt/ND@G shows a distinct negative shift (0.9 eV) compared to that for Pt/OLC (Figure 4c). The ND@G support is composed of an sp3-bonded nanodiamond core covered with one or two defective, ultrathin sp2-bonded graphene nanoshells, while the OLC support consists of multiple highly ordered, closed sp2-bonded graphene nanoshells with a few nanodiamond cores (Figure S1). (13, 21) The ID1/IG value (refer to the Supporting Information) for Pt/ND@G is much higher than that for Pt/OLC, which suggests that there are more defects in Pt/ND@G (Table 1 and Figure S9). Delocalized π electrons exist in the sp2-bonded graphene layers. Su et al. (22, 23) considered that defects and the curvature of the carbon layers could promote electron localization and increase the electron density. Then, electrons on the surface of defects could transfer to the Pt NPs, resulting in a decreased binding energy and an increased electron density. In addition, the binding energy of the Pt 4f electron for Pt/ND@G (1.0 eV) is lower than that of the commercial Pt/AC catalyst, which also possesses poor stability in the PDH process (Figure S2b).
Our results corroborate previous observations that the SMSIs in Pt/ND@G originate from the strong electron transference between the Pt NPs and the defective ultrathin graphene nanoshell, which would then promote the desorption of electron-rich propylene, inhibit the formation of coke from olefins, and thereby greatly enhance the catalytic stability. (5-7) Meanwhile, Okamoto et al. (24) determined that the adsorption energy of Pt could be improved by the defects in graphene, which demonstrated again that SMSIs indeed exist between the Pt NPs and the defective, ultrathin graphene nanoshell in ND@G.
High-resolution STEM images of the as-prepared catalysts are shown in Figure 5. The morphologies and structures of the Pt NPs in Pt/ND@G are different from those in Pt/Al2O3. The shapes of the Pt NPs in Pt/ND@G are irregular (triangular and other shapes), while those in Pt/Al2O3 are dominated by more spherical and diamond shapes. Additionally, the lattice fringes of the Pt NPs are more visible in Pt/Al2O3, which implies that the crystallinity of the Pt NPs in Pt/ND@G is lower than that in Pt/Al2O3. The irregular morphology and low crystallinity of the Pt NPs in Pt/ND@G may be strongly affected by the SMSIs mentioned above. In addition, the morphologies and structures of the Pt NPs in Pt/OLC are similar to those in Pt/Al2O3, both of which are also different from those in Pt/ND@G. These results further confirm the existence of stronger metal–support interactions in Pt/ND@G.

The catalytic performances during CO oxidation were also investigated over the as-prepared catalysts (Pt/Al2O3, Pt/ND@G, Pt/OLC, and Pt/AC) in a temperature-programmed mode (Figure 6). Notably, the Pt/ND@G catalyst has the highest activity among the selected catalysts (90.5% of CO conversion) at room temperature, followed by the Pt/OLC (36.2%), Pt/Al2O3 (1.4%), and commercial Pt/AC (1.2%) catalysts. The calculated turnover frequency (TOF) of Pt/ND@G (51.1 h–1) is approximately twice that of Pt/OLC (20.4 h–1), whereas Pt/Al2O3 and Pt/AC show negligible TOFs at 30 °C. Generally, the reaction rate of CO oxidation is limited by the desorption of CO. (25) Goodman et al. (26) and Nørskov et al. (27) considered that a linear relationship existed between the renormalized TPD peaks and the surface core level shift, indicating that charge accumulation could enhance the desorption of CO. Shubina et al. (28) found that a rich electron density for Ru NPs resulted in a stronger CO desorption. As described above, the electron density of the Pt NPs in Pt/ND@G was higher than for the other three catalysts (Figure 4c). Therefore, Pt/ND@G exhibits a dramatically enhanced catalytic activity for the CO oxidation reaction in contrast with those of Pt/OLC, Pt/Al2O3, and commercial Pt/AC catalysts. The CO oxidation results confirm that the SMSIs arise from the stronger electron transference between the Pt NPs and the defective graphene nanoshell in the Pt/ND@G catalyst, which makes Pt/ND@G active for both the high-temperature PDH reaction and low-temperature CO oxidation reaction.

Conclusions
ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To
In summary, we prepared the nanocarbon-supported Pt nanoparticles (Pt/ND@G), showing slight deactivation during the 100 h high-temperature PDH test, and identified that the defective ultrathin graphene nanoshell of nanodiamond is crucial to the high stability on Pt/ND@G. The origin of the good durability can be explained as follows. First, the strong electron transfer between the Pt NPs and ultrathin graphene nanoshell rich in defects increases the electron density of the Pt NPs, enhancing propylene desorption and inhibiting coke formation. Second, the strong electron transfer significantly promotes the SMSIs and effectively improves the Pt sintering resistance for Pt/ND@G. Moreover, evidence of this strong electron transfer between the Pt NPs and the defective graphene nanoshells is also provided by the evaluation of the CO catalytic oxidation.

Materials
The θ-Al2O3 support approximately 1.6 mm in size was obtained by calcining a γ-Al2O3 support (Sasol) at 1000 °C in air. ND powders (99.9%) were purchased from Beijing Grish Hitech Co., and the average diameter was 30 nm. On the basis of the data reported in our previous work, the noncombustible contaminations were tested by an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer and included <50 ppm Fe, <10 ppm Cr, <50 ppm Al, <10 ppm Cu, <10 ppm Mg, <10 ppm Ti, and <50 ppm Ca. (29) The H2PtCl6 and NaCOOH aqueous solutions were of analytical grade. The commercial Pt/AC catalyst was bought from Alfa.
Catalyst Preparation
The Pt/θ-Al2O3 (Pt/Al2O3) catalyst was prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method, of which the detailed procedure had been reported in our previous work. (30) Pt/ND@G and Pt/OLC were prepared by introducing aqueous H2PtCl6 onto the supports by using an improved wetness impregnation method. (31) The ND powder (1.0 g) with different annealing temperatures (1100 and 1300 °C, denoted as ND@G and OLC, respectively; (21) typically, the sample was heated from 25 to 1100 °C with a temperature ramp of 5 °C min–1 and held for 2 h) in N2 (6 mL min–1) was immersed in aqueous H2PtCl6 (8.6 mL, 5.8 mg mL–1). After the ultrasonic process (25 °C, 3 h), the mixture was magnetically stirred for 48 h at 25 °C. Then the mixture was heated to 110 °C for 24 h. Subsequently, the sample was reduced with a NaCOOH solution (64 mL, 2.5 mg mL–1) at 100 °C for 1 h, followed by filtering, washing, and drying (60 °C, 18 h, in air).
Characterizations
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed with a Thermo VG Scientific ESCALab220i-XL Microprobe instrument using Al Kα radiation as the X-ray source. The binding energy of the element was calibrated using a C 1s (284.6 eV) as a reference, and the spectral peaks were fitted by XPSPEAK.
The sizes of Pt nanoparticles were analyzed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) employing a JEOL TEM-ARM 200F instrument equipped with a Cs corrector on the illumination system. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were obtained using a FEI TECNAI G2 F20 (200 kV) high-resolution transmission electron microscope. The sizes of Pt nanoparticles were measured with the DigitalMicrograph software.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) analysis was performed on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 unit with H2 as the reducing agent. The samples were pretreated in Ar (99.99%) at 300 °C for 0.5 h and then cooled to room temperature in Ar. The experiments were performed using a 100 mg sample under a gas flow of H2 (5%) and Ar (95%). C3H6 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) was performed on a Micromeritics Autochem II 2920 unit equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. Typically, 100 mg of the sample was reduced with 1 vol % H2/Ar at 580 °C for 1 h. Subsequently, the sample was cooled to 50 °C, and then the apparatus was flushed with He for 1 h. The absorption of propylene was achieved by flowing C3H6 (99.99%) for 30 min and then purging the system with He for an additional 1 h. Afterward, the sample was heated to 600 °C at a rate of 15 °C min–1 in He. The acidities of the as-prepared catalysts were characterized by TPD and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), using ammonia (NH3) and pyridine (Py) as probe molecules, respectively. The NH3-TPD test was performed on an Autochem II 2920 unit. Py-FTIR was performed on a NICOLET 6700 FTIR spectrometer.
Raman analysis was performed on a JY LabRAM HR Raman spectrometer with a 325 nm laser beam. The amount of coke was measured by combustion of the spent catalysts on a model STA 409 PC/PG thermogravimetric analyzer (NETZSCH). The CO2 generated was examined by online mass spectrometry (MS). As a result of the differences between the supports, the Pt weight loading of the Pt/ND@G and Pt/OLC catalysts were determined with a Rigaku 3013 fluorescence spectrophotometer, and that for the Pt/Al2O3 catalyst was analyzed on a SHIMADZU UV-2401PC spectrophotometer. In addition, the Pt weight loading of the Pt/AC catalyst was provided by Alfa Co. The C and O contents of the catalysts were determined on an Elementar Micro Cube elemental analyzer.
Catalytic Measurements
Dehydrogenation of Propane. The propane dehydrogenation assessments were performed in a fixed-bed stainless steel microreactor lined with quartz (length of 750 cm, inner diameter of 11 mm), and the products were analyzed by an online GC-14C gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, HP-Al/KCL; capillary column, 50 m × 0.320 mm × 8.0 μm; flame ionization detector). Before the dehydrogenation reaction, the catalysts were reduced in H2 at 580 °C for 1 h and then heated to 600 °C and fed with propane. Typically, the gas reactant contained 5 vol % propane and a balance of N2 (total flow rate of 60 mL min–1). The operating temperature was 600 °C, the system pressure 0.13 MPa (absolute pressure), and the catalyst loading 0.2 g, excluding Pt/Al2O3 (0.33 g).
The propane rate (i.e., the reaction rate of propane) and propylene selectivity for products were calculated as follows:
(1)
where FC3H8 represents the flow rate of propane, X and mcat are the conversion of propane and catalyst loading, respectively, and wPt is the percentage of Pt weight loading in the catalyst. An example is provided in the Supporting Information.
(2)
where [Fi]in and [Fi]out are the inlet and outlet flow rates of hydrocarbon, respectively.
Oxidation of CO. CO oxidation was performed using 50 mg of catalyst loaded into a fixed-bed quartz tube reactor in temperature-programmed mode under ambient pressure. Before the oxidation reaction, the catalysts were reduced in H2 at 200 °C for 1 h. Typically, the gas reactant contained 1 vol % CO and 0.5 vol % O2 with a balance of He. The total flow rates were 15 mL min–1. The CO conversion and turnover frequency (TOF) of Pt were calculated as follows:
(3)
where [Fi]in and [Fi]out are the inlet and outlet flow rates of CO, respectively.
(4)
where FCO represents the flow rate of CO, X and mcat are the conversion of CO and catalyst loading, respectively, and wPt and Dis are the percentage of Pt weight loading in the catalyst and dispersity of Pt, respectively. The Dis was assessed by the STEM and TEM images. In a typical assessment process, nearly 100 Pt nanoparticles from the different STEM and TEM images were measured by the DigitalMicrograph software. Then, we analyzed the data and drew the Pt nanoparticle size distributions. Subsequently, we calculated the average diameters of each sample and assumed their reciprocals as the dispersion of Pt nanoparticles (empirical formula). (32) An example is given in the Supporting Information.

3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
