Kinetics of the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane on vanadia/titania catalysts, pure and doped with rubidium
Abstract
Oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of propane over VTiO and VRbTiO catalysts has been studied by steady-state kinetic method in the fixed bed flow reactor. The experiments were carried out by measuring conversion and selectivities for various feed compositions including C3H8, O2 and He, and for various contact times and temperatures. The experimental results obtained for both catalyst were described by a simple sequence of steps. Two kinetic mechanistic models: Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) and Eley–Rideal (ER)-Steady State Adsorption Model (SSAM) were tried and the analysis of the calculation results leads to the conclusion that Eley–Rideal-SSAM model is more appropriate for the description of the propane ODH reaction for both studied catalysts. In the frame of this latter model the role and the influence of Rb-additive on different steps of propane ODH reaction was discussed.

1. Introduction
Kinetic models, which provide detailed quantitative description of the reaction systems, play an important role in catalysis R&D. Such models are applied for the development and optimisation of the industrial catalytic processes. Kinetic modeling of the reactions have been successfully used to generate new quantitative data on the reaction mechanisms and the role the different catalytic sites play in these mechanisms [1], [2]. In the latter case, in order to obtain reliable information, it is essential to combine kinetic modeling with the experimental reaction studies and catalyst characterization.
Kinetic study of the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of alkanes is one of the ways to elucidate the reaction mechanism and to facilitate selection of the appropriate catalyst for this type of the reactions. Previous studies [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13] concerning the ODH of propane over oxide catalysts, have not explained entirely the mechanism of the reaction and some controversies in determination of macroscopic steps of the reaction still exist—the models applied to this reaction were too simplified. Though it is well known that the kinetic studies are not able to determine the molecular mechanism of the reaction, they allow to exclude some of the possible paths and to determine the reaction network. Therefore, the kinetic studies have been used to provide useful information about the studied reaction and the catalyst operation. On the basis of these studies, one can identify the intermediate products, the nature and quantitative participation of particular reaction routes (parallel and consecutive reaction paths, branching of the reactions, etc.) which decide about the selectivity of the process. One can also identify the rate determining step in a sequence of consecutive reactions.
So far the Mars–van-Krevelen (MK) or steady state adsorption (SSAM) models have been used, connected or not with the Eley–Rideal (ER) or Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) mechanisms. The calculations were done for the conversions of propane which varied in comparatively small ranges. The aim of this work was comparison of the applicability of the models and the determination of rate constants for particular steps of the ODH reaction for a wider range of the experimental data such as conversion of propane and the selectivities to propene and COx measured as a function of contact time, temperature and the initial concentration of the reagents.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalysts
The studies comprised two catalysts, denoted further in the text as 1VTiO and 1VRbTiO. Both catalysts contained one theoretical monolayer (mnl) of vanadia phase deposited on TiO2-anatase (commercial support, product of Tioxide Ltd., 48 m2/g).
One-monolayer of the VOx phase, calculated from crystallographic data of V2O5 as 10 V/nm2, corresponded to 6.7% V2O5 for a given specific surface area of TiO2. The catalyst was prepared by impregnation of TiO2 with the aqueous solution of ammonium methavanadate at pH 6, followed by solvent evaporation, drying for 18 h at 120 °C and calcination in a stream of air at 450 °C for 5 h. The promoted 1VRbTiO was obtained by adding the appropriate amount of rubidium nitrate to the methavanadate solution. The specific surface areas of the samples, after the calcination, were 44.4 and 42.7 m2/g for 1VTiO and 1VRbTiO, respectively. The detailed description of the preparation method was given in [4], [8].
2.2. Catalytic activity measurements
The steady-state activity of the catalyst in the oxidative dehydrogenation was measured in a fixed bed flow apparatus. A stainless steel reactor (120 mm long, i.d. 13 mm) was coupled directly to a series of gas chromatographs. Propene, carbon monoxide and dioxide were found to be the main reaction products. Details of the experimental set-up can be found in [8]. The flow rate of the reaction mixture was controlled with a mass flow meter type ERG-1MKZ. 0.4–0.5 g samples of a catalyst of the grain size of 0.6–1 mm, diluted with glass beads, were used. It has been checked in the preliminary experiments, in which the mass and the grain size of a catalyst sample were varied, that under these conditions the transport phenomena do not limit the reaction rate. The reaction mixture contained propane, oxygen and helium as a balance gas. The kinetic measurements were performed by measuring conversion of propane (X) and selectivities to propene and CO, CO2 (Sj) at three temperatures as a function of contact time and composition of the reaction mixture. The results of the kinetic experiments for the 1VTiO and 1VRbTiO catalysts are collected in Table 1, Table 2, respectively. Conversion of propane and a selectivity to an ith product are defined as: X = (ci−cf)/ci, Sj = cj/∑cj, where ci and cf are the concentrations of the respective alkane at the entrance and the exit of the reactor, respectively, and cj is the concentration of the product j in the exit gas. For each temperature four different compositions of the reaction mixture—with the propane/oxygen ratio = 2/1, 2/3, 1/1 and 1/3 were used. The contact time τ was varied between 0.1 and 3 s by changing the flow rate of the reaction mixture.

2.3. Choice and description of the applied kinetic models
The experimental data used for calculations were obtained for the 1VTiO and 1VRbTiO catalysts in the integral reactor (0 < X < 0.7), which made possible the calculation of the particular rate constants using a broad range of the independent variables (concentrations of propane, temperature of the reaction and contact time). The data obtained in [7], [9] for the 1VTiO catalysts, pure and promoted with alkali metals, have shown that the increase in the conversion of propane with the increasing temperature is accompanied by a considerable decrease in the selectivity to propene Sπ and, at the same time, a parallel increase in the selectivity to CO, SCO, and a smaller increase to CO2. Carbon oxides (COx = CO + CO2) are, however, observed in some amounts also at low conversions. Such a course of changes implies a parallel-consecutive mechanism of the formation of carbon oxides from propane, a behaviour typical of selective oxidation reactions of hydrocarbons on oxide catalysts.
The different aspects of the mechanism and kinetics of the ODH of propane were studied for different mixed oxide systems like V2O5/AlPO4 [3], V2O5/ZrO2 V2O5/TiO2 [11] and Mg–V–Sb–O [13], [14]. On the basis of the kinetic isotopic effect it has been shown that activation of methylene—CH bond is the rate determining step for the propane dehydrogenation [10]. The kinetic studies of the ODH of propane on the Mg–V–Sb–O catalyst have indicated that nucleophyllic oxygen of the catalyst is involved in the formation of propene and adsorbed electrophyllic oxygen is responsible for the total oxidation of propane and propene.
Similar studies were done for the V–Mg–O catalyst [14]. The authors tried three different models of the ODH of propane reaction (the power model and the models of Langmuir–Hinshelwood and of Mars–van-Krevelen, MK). However the fitting errors for all these models were practically the same (e.g. 7.5%) and it was difficult to distinguish which was the best one. In my opinion there are two reasons for such results. The first is a small range of the propane conversions and the second is a simplified (only consecutive) kinetic network, used by the authors in their calculations. Our models are based on the parallel-consecutive kinetic network and the kinetic data cover a broader range of the propane conversions and selectivities to propene, CO and CO2. The difference in the kinetic networks becomes important especially for high conversions of propane, which is justified by a relatively high activation energy of the parallel path.
Several different models [4], [7], [9] have been proposed in our previous papers for explanation of experimental results. They are based on the parallel-consecutive scheme of the propane ODH reaction. In the paper [4], the pseudohomogenous, first zero-order model (FZO) has been proposed and applied to the 1VTiO and 1VRbTiO catalysts. In this model it was assumed that the rate of the reaction is proportional to the concentration of propane and independent of the oxygen concentration. It is, however, an approximation, because it is evident from the experimental data that conversion of propane and selectivities depend to some extent on oxygen concentration. The power model (PM) [9] was also used as a first approach and gives a better description of the experimental data for the VTiO catalyst (matching mean error 7.6%) but a lack of a physical meaning is its serious disadvantage in this case.
For the 1VTiO catalyst, the two models mentioned above were compared with the steady state adsorption model (SSAM) [9] which was based on the following physical assumptions: (1) a steady state of the surface oxygen coverage is established on the catalyst surface, (2) the oxygen adsorption has a dissociative character, (3) the reaction of propane and propene on the catalyst surface proceeds through the Eley–Rideal mechanism, which means that the hydrocarbon molecule reacts directly from the gaseous phase without adsorption, (4) the propene formation and combustion of hydrocarbon requires only one type of the surface oxygen. On the basis of the above assumptions, this model allowed us to determine the rate constants for all the steps of the propane ODH. This model describes the experimental data for the propane ODH on the 1VTiO catalyst with the least mean error (4.9%) and it indicates that propene is the only useful product primary produced, and that CO and CO2 are produced largely by the sequential oxidation of the in situ produced propene, and to a lesser extent by a parallel route of the direct deep oxidation of propane.
In this paper the SSAM-Eley–Rideal (ER-SSAM) and Langmuir–Hinshelwood (LH) models were compared for the 1VTiO and 1VRbTiO catalysts. Ample sets of experimental data on propane conversion and selectivities to oxidation products as a function of the reagent mixture composition, temperature and contact time were used in the calculations. The experimental set of data for the 1VTiO catalyst was extended to lower contact times (Table 1) when compared with the data used earlier [7]. A similar set of data was obtained for the 1VRbTiO catalyst (Table 2).
As a first, the LH model was tried for these catalysts. In this model it is assumed that the ODH of propane proceeds through the following individual steps:
Adsorption/desorption of propane
R
(1)
Formation of adsorbed propene
(2)
Adsorption/desorption of propene
II
(3)
Dissociative chemisorption/desorption of oxygen
(4)
Parallel combustion of propane
(5)
Consecutive combustion of propene
(6)
where VO and O(s) denote the oxygen vacancy and the surface oxygen species on the surface of the catalyst, and indexes A and D denote adsorption and desorption, respectively and x is a mean value of oxygen/carbon ratio in the combustion products (CO + CO2). It is obvious, that none of the above reactions (, , ) is an elementary reaction, so one must, on the experimental basis, assume the appropriate reaction orders. It is also assumed that only one type of the catalyst oxygen is required for both selective and combustion reactions and oxygen of the catalyst is replenished by the dissociative adsorption from the gas phase on the vacancies (Eq. (4)). The rate of the reaction is taken as proportional to cO0.5 where cO is the concentration of oxygen in the gas phase, and of the first order in the surface coverage with the vacancies. On the basis of the above reactions the following two models were considered. In the first model (LH-1) orders with respect to the surface oxygen coverage in the reactions of propene and COx formation (, , ) were taken as 1. In the second model (LH-2) orders with respect to θs in the reactions of the COx formation were taken as 2 to take into account that—in total oxidation reaction—breaking of the CC bond requires a concurrent interaction of several oxygen atoms [20]. This assumption is also in accordance with results obtained for the VTiO catalyst in anerobic conditions in transient experiments [7] where concentration of COx decreased faster than that of propene.

In LH model it is assumed: (1) that the rates of propane consumption and the formation of COx and propene, depend on the rates of the surface reactions of the appropriate species and (2) that the equilibrium between adsorption and desorption of propane, propene and oxygen is established immediately. This assumption is similar to that proposed for the ODH of propane on V–Mg–O [14] and in [16]. The cases in which the adsorption of propane or the adsorption of oxygen on the surface of the catalyst are the rate determining steps in the propane ODH reaction were also tried but without success. Assuming that a Langmuir isotherm adequately describes the adsorption equilibrium of propane, propene and oxygen the following set of algebraic equations can be written:
(8)
(9)
(10)
where cR, cπ, cO are concentrations of propane, propene and oxygen in the gas phase and θR, θS and θπ are the surface coverages by propane, oxygen and propene respectively which can be calculated by solving the above set of the equations. In this model, CO and CO2 are formed in the reaction of the total oxidation of adsorbed propane and propene. Additionally it is assumed that these reactions are strongly shifted to the formation of carbon oxides and that the carbon oxides formed desorb immediately from the surface of the catalyst and do not block it. Taking into account that the propane and propene adsorption is a fast process in comparison with the surface reactions, one can write equations for the formation of propene, COx and consumption of propane in the gaseous phase. The analysis of the evolution of the selectivities to propene and to COx and of the conversion of propane was performed using the method proposed by Ai et al. [15]. For the model LH-1 it has led to an ordinary differential equations which can be written as:
(11)
(12)
(13)
where τ is the contact time. In model LH-2 oxygen coverage θs for the propane and propene combustion reactions (, ) is squared. All these reactions are assumed to be of the first order with respect to the hydrocarbon concentration in the gas phase.
In ER-SSAM model applied to the ODH reaction of propane on the 1VTiO and 1VRbTiO catalysts, only one type of the oxygen species is assumed [7]. This oxygen is responsible both for the selective oxydehydrogenation of propane and for the reactions of the total oxidation. Similarly as it had been done for the LH models in the reaction of the propene and COx formation, the orders with respect to the oxygen coverage were taken as 1 and 1 or as 1 and 2 for the ER-SSAM-1 and ER-SSAM-2 models, respectively. All these reactions are assumed to be of the first order with respect to the hydrocarbon concentration in the gas phase. These assumptions correspond to the following set of reactions:
(14)
(15)
(16)
(17)
According to this model, propane reacts directly from the gaseous phase with the surface oxygen of the catalyst, the reaction products desorb quickly and the surface is not blocked. For ER-SSAM-2 model changes of the oxygen surface coverage in the time of the reaction is given by the Eq. (18).
(18)
At the steady-state conditions, dθs/dt is equal to zero which leads to an algebraic equation which can be solved in relation to θs. The set of differential equations describing propane, propene and COx concentrations in the gas phase for the ER-SSAM-2 model can be written as:
Concentration of propane in the reaction mixture
(19)
Concentration of propene
(20)
Concentration of COx
(21)
For the ER-SSAM-1 model all θs have the same exponent of 1.
3. Results and discussion
To verify two above mentioned models in the kinetic way, 12 sets of data, described in Section 2, were used for non-doped (Table 1) and the rubidium doped catalysts (Table 2) (selectivities to propene and COx as well as the conversion of propane are given as a function of the contact time and feed mixture composition at three different temperatures). The integration of , , for the LH models or , , for the ER-SSAM models was performed using Runge–Kutta (fourth order). The fitting procedure was performed by using the values of the surface coverages obtained by the solution of algebraic Eq. (18) for the ER-SSAM models or solutions of the set of algebraic , , for the LH models, and a subsequent minimization of the object function defined as a sum of squared differences of experimental and calculated selectivities and conversions using Marquardt method in a program written in BASIC.
The difference between the ER-SSAM-1 and ER-SSAM-2 models is insignificant. For the VTiO catalyst the fit errors for both models are almost the same (5.2%) but for the RbVTiO catalyst the fit error for the ER-SSAM-2 model is a little lower (6.4%) than that for the ER-SSAM-1 model (6.8%). Differences between the LH-1 and LH-2 models are more significant and the LH-1 model describes better the experimental data than the LH-2 model. For the VTiO and RbVTiO catalysts the fit errors for the LH-1 model are 14.3 and 21.8%, respectively, while for the LH-2 model they are 15.4 and 24.1%. On the basis of the obtained results one can state that the ER-SSAM model describes the propane ODH reaction on the VTiO catalyst—both doped by rubidium and undoped—better than the LH model.
Table 3, Table 4 give activation energies and pre-exponential factors for the different reaction steps for the LH-1 and ER-SSAM-2 models, respectively. Fig. 1, Fig. 2 present the parity plots for the LH-1 model for the non-doped and rubidium doped catalysts. In Table 1, Table 2, experimental conversion and selectivity data are compared with values calculated on the basis of the ER-SSAM-2 model. As can be seen from Table 3, Table 4, the fitting error is much lower for the ER-SSAM-2 model than for the LH-1 model and F-test shows that in the case of the Rb-doped catalyst the LH-1 model does not describe adequately the experimental data. Lack of fit for the LH-1 model is clearly visible for the selectivity to COx, but also for propane conversion and selectivity to propene. In the case of the non-doped catalyst, the LH-1 model does not fit the selectivity to COx, but in contrast, it fits adequately the conversion of propane and the selectivity to propene though the matching error is much higher for the LH-1 than for the ER-SSAM-2 models, respectively (14.3 and 5.2%). Results of the calculations carried out on the basis of the LH-1 model show that the rubidium additive leads to a certain decrease of all rate constants. The increase of the selectivity to propene is mainly result of the decrease (about 10 times) of propene adsorption equilibrium constant K3, thus of the decrease of the adsorption of propene from the gaseous phase. It should be born in mind, however, that the LH-1 model describes the experimental data with a significant error (Table 3). Concluding, one can state that qualitatively LH-1 is correct from the conceptual point of view, but it must be excluded on the ground of the lack of fit.

The rate constants obtained for the ER-SSAM-2 model applied to the ODH of propane on the VTiO catalyst using more complete experimental data than in [7] are qualitatively similar to those obtained by us for the comparatively high propane conversions (high contact times). There exist, however, some quantitative differences, especially for the estimation of k1/k3 ratio, which is higher for the more complete data.
The differential selectivity to propene can be obtained in ER-SSAM-2 model by dividing Eq. (20) by Eq. (19) which leads to Eq. (22):
(22)
This allows to calculate the limit value of the selectivity to propene when X → 0
(23)
For X → 0, the oxygen surface coverage is expected to be close to 1. The limit values for the selectivity of propene calculated from the Eq. (22) for studied catalysts are reasonable and are in agreement with the experimental data. Thus, one can state that the ER-SSAM-2 model describes adequately the ODH reaction of propane on the 1VTiO and 1RbVTiO catalysts in the broad range of the conversions of propane.
On the basis of the calculated results collected in Table 4, it is evident that the Rb additive increases to some extent the activation energy for the consecutive oxidation of propene, which is the main route responsible for the total oxidation of propane. As can be seen from Fig. 3A, which shows the dependence of the ratio of the selective reaction (k1) to the total oxidation (k2 + k3), the rubidium additive leads to the four time increase of this ratio. Quantitatively this result has been supported in [8], [18] where it was found that the rubidium additive increases the yield to propene in comparison with the non-doped catalyst. Similar tendency was observed for the ODH of propane on the MoO3 catalyst doped with cesium [17].

Fig. 3. Temperature dependence of k1/(k2 + k3), (k1 + k2 + k3)/kOS, k1/k3 and k1/k2 for the ER-SSAM-2 model for the non-doped and rubidium doped 1VTiO catalyst.
The rubidium additive practically does not change the rate of the reoxidation kOS, but the decrease in the rates of the processes which consume oxygen, leads to an increase of the (k1 + k2 + k3)/kOS ratio responsible for the surface reduction degree of the catalyst (1 − θs). Fig. 3B shows that this ratio is much lower for the rubidium doped catalyst and is practically independent of the temperature, whereas for the non-doped catalyst the degree of the surface reduction is higher and depends on the temperature.
As can be seen from Table 4, the rubidium additive strongly decreases the k2 value mainly by increasing the activation energy. This reflects a stronger basicity of the catalyst surface. Propene molecules contain π-bond, which makes them more basic than propane and leads to their easier desorption from the catalyst surface doped by rubidium. These changes in the k2 value lead to an increase of the k1/k2 ratio (Fig. 3D).
The same increase of the activation energy E3 is observed for the rubidium doped catalyst. The decrease of the pre-exponential factor k3 acts in the same way (due to the blocking of the active centers responsible for the interaction of propyl intermediates) leading in consequence to a decrease in the rate constants k3 for this catalyst. The effect of Rb additive on k1/k3 ratio which reflects the relative rate of the ODH reaction and the primary propane combustion is shown in Fig. 3C. As can be seen from this figure, the k1/k3 values increase when rubidium is added, what reflects the decrease of undesired combustion of propyl intermediates before their transformation in propene.
Generally in the frame of ER-SSAM model, rubidium additive leads to a decrease to a different extent of all the pre-exponential factors (Table 4) for rate constants which describe the reaction of propane ODH. This is the reason of a lower activity of the rubidium doped catalyst. The same effect has been observed for other alkali metal additives (Li and K) in the ODH of propane on the VTiO catalyst [18].
Unfortunately the activation energies and the pre-exponential factors for the calculated rate constants cannot be compared with any literature data for the ODH reaction on the VTiO catalyst. The only kinetic data available for the ODH of propane concern the V–Mg–O catalyst [14], which is much less active. Furthermore, the models applied by the authors to describe the ODH reaction of propane [14] have been based on different reaction network and have had different reaction stages. For this reason a quantitative comparison of the activation energies and the rate constants determined in this paper with the data obtained by authors of [14] is impossible. Moreover the catalytic activity of V–Mg–O is considerably lower in comparison with V2O5/TiO2, i.e. for the V–Mg–O catalyst the same catalytic activity is attained at the temperature about 200 K higher.
The kinetic model similar to ER-SSAM for the ODH of propane on the VTiO catalyst has been applied for the description of the non-stationary kinetics of the ODH of propane in anaerobic conditions by Genser and Pietrzyk [19]. Though it differs in some details from the ER-SSAM model of the present work, it is possible to compare the value of the activation energy obtained for the formation of propene (k1). The activation energy of 26 kJ/mol obtained in the steady state experiments (Table 4) is close to that of 29.1 kJ/mol given in [19] for the selective ODH reaction.
4. Conclusions
1.
The ODH reaction of propane is described more adequately by the ER-SSAM model than the LH model, both for the non-doped (1VTiO) catalyst and for the rubidium doped (1RbVTiO) catalysts.
2.
In the frame of the ER-SSAM model in the ODH reaction of propane, propane from the gaseous phase interacts with the catalyst oxygen and next it undergoes a selective reaction or is oxidized to CO and CO2. The desorption of the reaction products to the gaseous phase is rapid and they do not block the surface of the catalyst. A subsequent combustion of propene which is the main source of COx occurs by the consecutive interaction of propene from the gaseous phase with the surface of the catalyst.
3.
Addition of rubidium leads to a decrease of the rate constants of the propene formation and a simultaneous increase of the activation energy of the subsequent oxidation of propene, which results in the increase of the selectivity to propene.
4.
Rate constant of the parallel formation of COx (k3) for the catalyst doped with rubidium is decreased in comparison with the non-doped catalyst, which comes out from the increase of the activation energy and decrease of the pre-exponential factor.
5.
The decrease of the pre-exponential factors of the rate constants for the all stages of the ODH reaction of propane indicates a blocking of the active centers and leads to the decrease of the catalytic activity of the rubidium doped catalyst in comparison with the non-doped catalyst.
