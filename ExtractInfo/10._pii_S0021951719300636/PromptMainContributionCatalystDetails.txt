Abstract
A series of bare ZrO2 materials composed either of monoclinic or tetragonal phase with the size of crystallites varying between 3.7 and 43.4 nm were prepared by precipitation, hydrothermal or thermal calcination methods. The samples were characterized by XRD, BET, CO-TPR, NH3-TPD, electrical conductivity measurements and operando UV–vis spectroscopy. Density functional theory calculations provided molecular insights into the kind of active site and individual steps of propane dehydrogenation to propene and hydrogen. Regardless of the phase composition, two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy, i.e. coordinatively unsaturated Zr cations (Zrcus sites) having, nevertheless, different chemical environment in tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2, were concluded to be responsible for homolytic breaking of CH bonds in propane. Monoclinic ZrO2 showed, however, higher rate of propene formation and higher propene selectivity than ZrO2 stabilized in the tetragonal phase. Both the activity and the selectivity to propene increased with a decrease in the size of crystallites. The effects of phase composition and crystallite size on the PDH performance were related to the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen upon reductive catalyst treatment and thus to create Zrcus sites. The knowledge derived can be used for further optimizing PDH performance of ZrO2-based catalysts and also extended to other non-reducible metal oxides.

1. Introduction
Propene is widely used for the manufacture of a large number of chemicals relevant for our everyday life [1], [2]. Its production and demand continue to grow because of the higher consumption of the downstream products made of propene. The global annual propene market is estimated to reach 165 million tons by 2030 compared to 103 million in 2012 [3], [4]. Nowadays, propene is mainly produced through steam (60–65%) or fluid catalytic cracking (30%) of various oil fractions [5], [6]. However, these two processes cannot fulfill the demands for propene. Therefore, some on-purpose technologies, such as metathesis of ethylene with 2-butenes [7], methanol to olefins or propene [8] and propane dehydrogenation (PDH) [3] have been developed to close the gap between propene demand and production.
PDH is one of the largest processes for on-purpose propene production and offers high propene selectivity. The two main industrial processes are Catofin and Oleflex utilizing CrOx/Al2O3 and Pt/Al2O3 based catalysts respectively [3]. Such catalysts are highly active and selective, however, have some drawbacks [3], [9], [10], [11]. In particular, Pt/Al2O3 is expensive and should be treated under chlorine atmosphere to re-disperse platinum species [3], while Cr(VI) may cause various health effects. Apart from Pt-based or CrOx-based catalysts, there are some alternatives reported in literature. They include materials on the basis of ZnO [12], [13], [14], GaOx [15], [16], VOx [17], [18], [19], isolated FeII [20] and CoII [21]. None of them has, however, been commercialized. This is due to the lower catalytic performance (activity, selectivity and durability) compared with commercial catalysts and insufficient understanding of structure–activity-selectivity relationship required for tailored catalyst design. It is usually not easy to establish such relationship as (i) the PDH reaction requires high temperature hindering application of operando characterization techniques and (ii) molecular structures of catalytically active species are typically unknown and may change under dynamic reaction conditions.
Recently, our group has developed alternative-type catalysts on the basis of ZrO2, which are environmentally friendly and cost-efficient in comparison with commercial CrOx− and Pt-containing catalysts respectively. They showed industrially relevant activity and olefin selectivity in non-oxidative dehydrogenation of C3 and C4 alkanes [22], [23], [24], [25]. Coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) are supposed to be active sites for the dehydrogenation reaction. Such sites can be created by doping of zirconia with some metal oxides or by high-temperature reductive treatment or by loading tiny amounts of metal nanoparticles, such as Ru and Rh. Our very recent study investigated the effect of crystallite size of bare monoclinic ZrO2 on the activity and propene selectivity in PDH. It was found that the activity in PDH could be tuned by changing crystallite size: the smaller the crystallite size, the higher the activity is [26]. The highest activity achieved over bare monoclinic ZrO2 was comparable to that of commercial CrOx/Al2O3 catalyst. DFT calculations suggested that the active site of monoclinic ZrO2 consists of two Zr cations located at an oxygen vacancy.
This work aims to validate a new strategy for regulating the activity and especially selectivity of ZrO2 in PDH through phase composition and crystallite size. A principle goal was to identify the kind of active sites for the non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propene and for coke formation and the factors affecting their generation over tetragonal and monoclinic ZrO2. To address these challenges, we followed a complementary approach combining controlled material synthesis with steady-state catalytic tests and catalyst characterization by XRD, BET, NH3-TPD, CO-TPR, electrical conductivity measurements and operando UV–vis spectroscopy. The latter technique was instrumental for elucidating mechanistic aspects of coke formation. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were applied to derive molecular insights into the kind of active site and individual reaction pathways leading from propane to propene.
2. Experimental
2.1. DFT calculations
Spin-polarized and periodic DFT calculations were carried out using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) [27], [28]. Exchange and correlation were treated within the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (GGA-PBE) [29]{Perdew, 1996 #275; Perdew, 1996 #514}. To obtain accurate energies with errors of less than 1 meV per atom, a cutoff energy of 400 eV was used. Geometry optimization was converged until forces acting on atoms were lower than 0.02 eV/Å, whereas the energy threshold defining self-consistency of the electron density was set to 10−4 eV. The Climbing Image Nudged Elastic Band (CI-NEB) method with eight images was applied for finding transition states and minimum energy paths of all reactions with a force tolerance of 0.05 eV/Å [30]. The final transition state structures were refined by using the quasi-Newton algorithm until the Hellman-Feynman forces on each ion were lower than 0.02 eV/Å. The normal mode frequency analysis was performed to validate the optimized transition states and each authentic transition state has only one imaginary frequency along the reaction coordinates. The resulted zero-point vibrational energies (ZPE) from the frequency analysis are included in our energetic discussion. The slab with nine layers was fixed and the surface-adsorbed molecules (partial Hessian) or intermediates are relaxed.
Since XRD analysis proved that our catalysts are mainly composed of the tetragonal phase (as shown below), we calculated tetragonal ZrO2 (t-ZrO2) models. For the optimization of the bulk structure, the lattice parameters of the t-ZrO2 phase were determined by minimizing the total energy of the unit cell by using a conjugated gradient algorithm to relax the ions. A 9 × 9 × 6 Monkhorst-Pack k point grid was used for sampling the Brillouin zone [31]. The calculated lattice parameters of the unit cell, a = b = 3.632 and c = 5.231 Å, are in excellent agreement with the experimental values (a = b = 3.64 and c = 5.27 Å) [32] as well as other theoretical results [33], [34] summarized in Table S1. This agreement clearly validates our computational methodology.
Among all t-ZrO2 surfaces, the (1 0 1) termination with O-Zr-O surface was found to be most stable [35], [36], [37]. The t-ZrO2(1 0 1) surface was modelled by a nine-layer slab with the lowest three layers fixed in the bulk positions and the upper six layers being allowed to relax. In all cases, a p(2 × 3) lateral supercell containing a vacuum space of 15 Å between the slab and its periodic replicas was used. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a 3 × 3 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack mesh.
The oxygen-defective t-ZrO2(1 0 1) surface was computed by removal of a neutral oxygen atom. The vacancy formation energy, Ef(Ov), was calculated according to equation Ef(Ov) = Ed + 1/2EO2 − Es, where Ed is the energy of oxygen defect surface slab and Es is the energy of the clean surface slab, while EO2 is the energy of gas-phase O2 molecule. The oxygen vacancy formation energy is a measure of the reducibility of the oxide. The higher the (positive) value, the lower the reducibility is.
The adsorption energy is defined by Eads = EX+s/d − Es/d − EX, where EX+s/d is the total energy of the slab (clean or oxygen defect surface) with adsorbents in its equilibrium geometry, Es/d is the total energy of the slab (clean or oxygen defect surface) and EX is gas-phase species. The more negative the adsorption energy, the stronger the adsorption is. The activation barrier (or activation energy, Ea) and reaction energy (ΔEr) are calculated according to Ea = ETS − EIS and ΔEr = EFS − EIS, where EIS, EFS and ETS are the energies of the corresponding initial state (IS), final state (FS) and transition state (TS) respectively.
2.2. Catalyst preparation
Tetragonal ZrO2 samples were prepared by precipitation method. ZrOCl2·8H2O (98%, Aldrich) or ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O (99%, Aldrich) were used as zirconia precursors, ammonium hydroxide solution (25%, Roth) or ethylene diamine (greater than99%, Merck) were used as precipitation agents. t-ZrO2_1 and t-ZrO2_2 were synthesized using ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O and ammonium hydroxide solution. Firstly, 41.237 g of ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O were dissolved in 243 mL of H2O to get a solution with a zirconium concentration of 0.5 mol·L−1. Hereafter, an ammonium hydroxide solution was added dropwise to the above solution until the pH value reached 10. The obtained mixture was heated to 100 °C while maintaining the same pH value. The precipitated product was then stirred for 10 days, filtered, washed with deionized water and dried. t-ZrO2_1 and t-ZrO2_2 samples were obtained after calcination of the dried product at 500 °C and 600 °C for 4 h respectively. t-ZrO2_3 was prepared in a similar way but using ZrOCl2·8H2O as a zirconia precursor. The absence of chloride anions in the precipitate was proven by the reaction of filtrate with AgNO3. This sample was obtained after calcination of the dried product at 700 °C for 5 h. t-ZrO2_4 was prepared using ZrOCl2·8H2O and ethylene diamine. Firstly, 7.251 g of ZrOCl2·8H2O were dissolved in 500 mL H2O and then ethylene diamine was added into the above solution dropwise until the pH value reached 11. Hereafter, the mixture was heated to 100 °C and stirred for 24 h. The precipitated product was filtered, washed, dried, and calcined at 800 °C for 4 h.
Monoclinic and amorphous ZrO2 catalysts are from our previous work [26]. They were abbreviated as m-ZrO2_1, m-ZrO2_2, m-ZrO2_3, m-ZrO2_4, m-ZrO2_5, m-ZrO2_6 and a-ZrO2 respectively. m-ZrO2_1 was provided by Saint-Gobain without any treatment. m-ZrO2_3 was prepared by hydrothermal method from ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O. m-ZrO2_2, m-ZrO2_4 and m-ZrO2_5 were prepared by calcination of m-ZrO2_1 at 550, 700 and 900 °C for 4 h respectively. m-ZrO2_6 was prepared by calcination of ZrO(NO3)2·xH2O at 1000 °C for 5 h. a-ZrO2 was prepared by precipitation method using ZrOCl2·8H2O as precursor.
2.3. Catalyst characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed on a Panalytical X'Pert diffractometer equipped with a Xcelerator detector, automatic divergence slits and Cu tube (kα1/α2 radiation, 40 kV, 40 mA, λ = 0.015406 nm, 0.0154443 nm). Cu beta-radiation was excluded by using nickel filter foil. The crystallite size was calculated by the Scherrer equation (Eq. (1))

where K parameter was set to 1.0747, β is the integrated breadth of (1 1 1) reflection peak, θ is the diffraction angel.
Specific surface area (SBET) of the catalysts was measured by nitrogen physisorption experiments at 77 K using a Belsorp mini Ⅱ setup (Bel Japan). Desorption isotherms were evaluated according to the BET method.
Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of NH3 was carried out in an in-house developed setup containing eight individually heated continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactors. The following procedure was applied. The catalysts (0.05 to 0.1 g) were initially calcined in air flow at 550 °C for 1 h, purged with Ar for 15 min and then treated in a flow consisting of 57 vol% H2 in Ar for 1 h. After that, the catalysts were cooled down in Ar flow to 120 °C. Then the catalysts were exposed to a flow of NH3 (1 vol% NH3 in Ar, 14 mL·min−1) for 1 h. Hereafter, the catalysts were cooled down in Ar flow to 80 °C. Before starting NH3-TPD, the catalysts were purged in Ar flow at 80 °C for 2 h to remove weakly adsorbed NH3. Finally, the catalysts were heated to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 K·min−1 in Ar flow (10 mL·min−1). Desorbed NH3 was monitored by an on-line mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320) at the atomic mass unit (AMU) of 15 (NH). Ar (AMU of 40) was used as inert standard.
Temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) experiments were performed using a feed consisting of 1 vol% CO in Ar. Catalysts (0.2 g) were firstly calcined in air flow at 550 °C for 1 h, then cooled down in the same flow to room temperature and purged in Ar flow to remove oxygen. Hereafter, they were heated in a flow of 1 vol% CO in Ar (10 mL·min−1) to 900 °C with a heating rate of 10 K·min−1. The consumption of CO was detected by an on-line mass spectrometer (Pfeiffer Vacuum OmniStar GSD 320). The signals at AMUs of 28 (CO and CO2), 44 (CO2) and 40 (Ar) were recorded.
Overall electrical conductivity of catalysts was measured in a fixed-bed continuous-flow tubular quartz reactor. Firstly, the catalyst was pressed into a dense disc of 7.1 mm in diameter and 1.2–2.0 mm in thickness to minimize interior grain boundaries. Both surfaces of the disc were covered with a platinum conducting paste (ChemPur, 71% Pt) and dried at 120 °C. Hereafter, a sample disc was sandwiched between two inert platinum electrodes and arranged inside the reactor. 1 kHz alternating current was adjusted with an automatically compensating bridge (Wayne Kerr B905). At this mono-frequency regime, the contributions of both surface and bulk conductivity are regarded similar for all samples, owing to the identical treatment of the sample discs. As an equivalent circuit, a parallel connection of a condenser and an ohmic resistance was applied. Electrical conductivity of catalysts was measured at 550 °C in air and N2 to ensure different partial pressures of oxygen, i.e. 20 kPa and about 10−4 kPa respectively. The electrical conductivity of the catalysts was calculated according to Eq. (2).

Operando UV–vis tests were performed at 550 °C in an in-house developed set-up equipped with an AVASPEC fiber optical spectrometer (Avantes), a DH-2000 deuterium-halogen light source and a CCD array detector. A high-temperature reflection UV–vis probe consisting of 6 radiating optical fibers and 1 reading fiber was threaded through the furnace to face quartz reactor walls at the position where catalysts were held [38]. The catalysts were firstly heated in N2 flow up to 550 °C followed by calcination in air flow for 1 h. Then they were purged with N2 for 15 min, treated with H2 flow (57 vol% H2 in N2) for 1 h, flushed in N2 for 15 min, and then reacted with a feed containing 40 vol% C3H8 in N2. The catalyst amount and flow were set to 0.1–0.2 g and 6–40 mL·min−1 respectively to keep the initial propane conversion over all catalysts about 10%. For analyzing carbon deposition during PDH, we defined relative reflectance (Rrel) as the ratio of the reflectance of the catalysts with coke deposits (RDH) to the fully oxidized ones (RO2) according to Eq. (3). From this reflectance, we calculated the relative Kubelka-Munk function F(Rrel) according to Eq. (4).

2.4. Catalyst tests
All catalytic tests were performed at 1 bar in an in-house developed setup consisting of 15 continuous-flow fixed-bed quartz reactors. To determine the rate of propene formation, the tests were carried out at a degree of propane conversion below 10% using a feed containing 40 vol% C3H8 in N2. The amount of the catalyst and the total flow of reaction mixture were set to 0.1 g and 20 mL·min−1 respectively. The catalysts were firstly heated in N2 flow up to 550 °C followed by calcination in air flow for 1 h. Then they were purged with N2 for 15 min, treated with H2 flow (57 vol% H2 in N2) for 1 h and flushed in N2 for 15 min. Finally, a flow of C3H8-N2 mixture (40 vol% C3H8 in N2) was passed through the catalyst bed. The initial rate of propene formation was measured after 190 s on stream.
To establish the dependence of product selectivity on propane conversion, we performed catalytic tests at 550 °C with the catalysts reduced in a flow of H2 (57 vol% H2 in N2). Catalyst amount (0.8 to 1.5 g) and total flow (6 to 80 mL·min−1) were varied to get different contact times and accordingly different degrees of propane conversion.
An overall activation energy of propane dehydrogenation was determined in the temperature range between 500 and 550 °C over the catalysts pre-reduced at 550 °C in a flow of H2 (57 vol% H2 in N2) for 1 h. Catalyst amount used in these tests was varied from 0.1 to 0.4 g depending on the sample, while the total flow of the reaction feed was set to 10 mL·min−1, 10 mL·min−1 and 20 mL·min−1 for 500, 525 and 550 °C respectively.
The feed components and the reaction products were analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890) equipped with PLOT/Q (for CO2), AL/S (for hydrocarbons), and Molsieve 5 (for H2, O2, N2, and CO) columns as well as flame ionization and thermal conductivity detectors.
Eqs. (5), (6), (7), (8), (9) were used to calculate the rate of propene formation (r(C3H6) expressed as mmol(C3H6)·g−1cat·min−1), propane conversion (X(C3H8)), selectivity to gas-phase products (Si) or to coke (S(coke)), and propene yield (Y(C3H6)) respectively.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. DFT calculations of individual reaction pathways
We shall start with the presentation and discussion of the results of DFT calculations of propane dehydrogenation over t-ZrO2 and will compare them with those obtained in our previous study for monoclinic ZrO2 (m-ZrO2) [26]. The purpose was to check if the kind of active sites and individual reaction steps for propene formation depend on the phase composition of ZrO2. As the (1 0 1) facet is the most stable termination surface of t-ZrO2 [35], [36], [37] this surface was selected for the calculations. We computed individual reaction pathways leading from propane to propene on the ideal and oxygen-defective (1 0 1) surfaces. Surface oxygen vacancy (Ov) was created by removal of a neutral oxygen atom (O3cI or O3cII) or with help of CO or H2 in form of CO2 or H2O (Table S2). In comparison with O3cII, O3cI (Fig. S1) was established to be 0.38 eV more energetically (5.45 vs. 5.83 eV for O3cI and O3cII respectively) preferable species to form surface oxygen vacancy (Table S2). Thus, the defective t-ZrO2(1 0 1) surface in our model was created through removal of one O3cI species (Fig. S1(b)). It is worth mentioning that oxygen vacancy on the surface of t-ZrO2 (1 0 1) and m-ZrO2 (
1 1) have very different local chemical environment. For m-ZrO2 (
1 1), the removed oxygen atom was connected to two Zr atoms, while three Zr atoms were around the oxygen atom removed from t-ZrO2 (1 0 1). To derive molecular insights into electron distribution inside the anion vacancy, we further computed the spin density and the density of states (DOS) for the clean surface and the surface with an oxygen vacancy (Fig S2). We found that the Zr cation is only very slightly reduced and remains mainly formal Zr4+ on the basis of the computed Barde charge (the three Zr cations near the vacancy accumulate 0.20, 0.16 and 0.16e as compared with those of the clean surface). In addition, the DOS of Zr center on both surfaces are approximately the same, apart from some electrons at the Fermi level. Thus, electrons generated upon oxygen vacancy formation remain delocalized.
To identify the kind of active site and the mode of dissociation of methylene CH bond over defective t-ZrO2 (1 0 1), we computed the reaction on three different sites: (i) one lattice oxygen and one saturated Zr site (Zr6cI−a-O3cI, Zr6cI−a-O3cII, Zr6cII–O3cII, Zr7cI–O3cI or Zr7cI–O3cII in Fig. S1 (a)), (ii) two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy ([Zr6cI−a, Zr6cII]-Ov or [Zr6cII, Zr6cI−b]-Ov in Fig. S1 (b)) and (iii) two lattice oxygen species (O3cI–O3cII in Fig S1 (a)). The most thermodynamically preferable pathway was concluded to be homolytic breaking of the C-H bond on the [Zr6cI−a, Zr6cII]-Ov or [Zr6cII, Zr6cI−b]-Ov sites (Fig. 1, Fig. S3, Table S3), which is exothermic by 0.91 or 0.29 eV (Fig. S4). The full potential energy surfaces of the most preferred routes on defective t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2 surfaces are shown in Fig. 1, while the Gibbs free energy profiles are given in Fig. S5. Similar to our recent DFT calculations of propane dehydrogenation over m-ZrO2 [26], the overall apparent barrier for this reaction over the oxygen-defective t-ZrO2 (1 0 1) facet is significantly lower (1.13 vs. 1.90 eV) than that over the ideal facet (Fig. 1 and Fig. S3).

Fig. 1. The calculated energy profiles and optimized structures of intermediates along the pathway of propane dehydrogenation to propene over defective t-ZrO2 (1 0 1) and m-ZrO2 (
1 1) surfaces (Zr/light blue, C/grey, O/red, H/white).
It is also obvious from Fig. 1 and Fig. S5 that the energy profiles in the course of propane dehydrogenation reaction over oxygen-defective m-ZrO2(
1 1) and oxygen-defective t-ZrO2(1 0 1) have the same shape and trend. The individual pathways, however, differ in the energy values. For example, propene formation over m-ZrO2(
1 1) should proceed easier than over t-ZrO2(1 0 1). No significant differences could be identified between these samples in terms of H2 formation.
The conclusion about the mode (homotytic vs. heterolytic) of C-H bond breaking was drawn on the basis of the following arguments: (i) DFT calculations predict that both H and iso-C3H7 interact with surface Zr atoms having the same charge rather than with one Zr and one O atom, which are differently charged and (ii) the computed Bader Charge of the H atom and the central C atom in iso-C3H7 is negative and does not significantly differ from each other (-0.33e and −0.29e for H and C3H7 respectively).
The importance of surface defects for propane dehydrogenation over t-ZrO2 is in agreement with our previous calculations dealt with m-ZrO2 [26]. Thus, regardless of ZrO2 phase composition, two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy, which has different local environment in t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2, are responsible for propane activation, while catalytic centers consisting of one lattice oxygen and one saturated Zr site or two lattice oxygen species do not seem to be relevant. On an elementary step level, iso-C3H7 fragment formed upon homolytic breaking of the C-H bond in C3H8 is bound at the Zr6cI−a or Zr6cII site, while the remaining H atom is located in a bridge position between the Zr6cI−b and Zr6cII cations. The methylene CH activation barrier at the [Zr6cI−a, Zr6cII]-Ov site is lower than that at the [Zr6cII, Zr6cI−b]-Ov site (0.42 vs. 0.61 eV).
After identifying the mode of methylene CH activation, we examined several possible routes of methyl CH bond activation in iso-C3H7 adsorbed on the Zr6cI−a or Zr6cII site (Fig. S6). The most thermodynamically and kinetically preferred route is methyl CH bond dissociation at the (Zr6cII, Zr6cI−a)-Ov site with the dissociated H located at the adjacent Zr6cI−a center (Fig. 1 and Fig. S6). Propene formation is an endothermic process (with 0.23 eV) with an activation barrier of 0.92 eV. The hydrogen formation is also strongly endothermic by 1.17 eV, while the reversed hydrogen dissociation is a barrier-less process. After considering the methylene CH and methyl CH bond activation together, [Zr6cII, Zr6cI−b]-Ov site is concluded to be more kinetically favorable than [Zr6cI−a, Zr6cII]-Ov site for propane dehydrogenation to propene.
Although propane dehydrogenation over m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2 occurs on two Zrcus cations, the phase composition of ZrO2 is nevertheless relevant for the PDH reaction as concluded from the potential energy surfaces shown in Fig. 1 and the Gibbs free energy profiles in Fig. S5. It is obvious that the methylene CH bond activation over defective t-ZrO2 (1 0 1) requires higher energy in comparison with this process over defective m-ZrO2 (
1 1); i.e. 0.42 or 0.61 eV vs. 0.16 eV. The latter surface is also more favorable for breaking of the methyl bond in iso-C3H7, which is the surface precursor formed from C3H8. Such difference between t-ZrO2 (1 0 1) and m-ZrO2 (
1 1) might be related to the local structure of two Zrcus cations forming the active site on these surfaces. Even though propene formation appears to be a structure-sensitive process, hydrogen formation does not depend on the phase composition of ZrO2. This process requires the highest energy, which is 1.13 and 1.24 eV for the defective t-ZrO2 (1 0 1) and m-ZrO2 (
1 1) facets respectively. Thus, it should be the rate-limiting step in the course of PDH over bare ZrO2 regardless of its phase composition. However, it is noted that the computed barriers are lower than the experimentally estimated Arrhenius activation energies; and such differences between theory and experiment have been reported previously [39].
3.2. Characterization of as-prepared catalysts
Under consideration of the above DFT results about the kind of active site and the elementary reaction pathways of propane dehydrogenation over t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2, one may expect that the phase composition is not vital for the activity of bare ZrO2 in the target reaction. To verify this assumption, we prepared several ZrO2 samples composed of either monoclinic or tetragonal phase. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of as-prepared materials are shown in Fig. 2. According to these data, four samples are stabilized in the tetragonal phase with an average crystallite size of 3.7, 4.6, 5.7 or 8.1 nm, six samples are m-ZrO2 with an average crystallite size of 9.1, 12.9, 13.0, 18.6, 32.8 or 43.4 nm and one ZrO2 sample is amorphous (a-ZrO2). The fact that t-ZrO2 samples are composed of smaller crystallites than their m-ZrO2 counterparts could be due to the lower surface free energy of t-ZrO2 than that of m-ZrO2. Accordingly, when the crystallite size is small enough, zirconia is easily stabilized in t-ZrO2 without any promoter [40], [41]. The phase composition of selected ZrO2 catalysts did not change after catalytic tests (Fig. S7).

Overall acidity of bare ZrO2 materials was determined from NH3-TPD experiments. The obtained NH3-TPD profiles are shown in Fig. 3(a). NH3 desorption was observed in a broad temperature range between 200 and 550 °C thus proving the presence of acidic sites of different strength. These sites should be of Lewis character because Brønsted acidic OH sites are decomposed upon catalyst treatment at 550 °C as proven in our separate study [24]. The temperature of maximal desorption of NH3 for different samples did not differ strongly and was around 260 °C. Thus, the largest fraction of Lewis acidic sites on the surface of all catalysts should be of similar strength. The density of acidic sites was calculated for each catalyst under assumption that one NH3 molecule can be adsorbed on one acidic site. The results are given in Table 1. Among all samples, m-ZrO2_2 revealed the highest density of acidic sites, while m-ZrO2_6 showed the lowest one. It was found that the density of acidic sites increased with decreasing crystallite size for monoclinic or tetragonal phase, and amorphous ZrO2 showed a middle acidic density among all catalysts (Fig. S8).

The reducibility (the ability of ZrO2 to release lattice oxygen in the presence of reducing agent) of differently prepared ZrO2 was investigated by CO-TPR method. Fig. 3(b) shows the profiles of CO consumption for all catalysts in a form of a change of CO mass spectrometric signal with temperature. In general, the reduction temperature of the samples composed of t-ZrO2 was at least 100 °C higher than that of the samples composed of m-ZrO2, while the amorphous ZrO2 did not show any measurable CO consumption. The temperature of maximal rate of reduction decreases with a decrease in crystallite size both for t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2. Such tendency can be explained by the fact that oxygen ions located at corners/edges or surface defects can be easier removed than those on the flat non-defective surface and thus the reducibility of metal oxide will be improved upon decreasing the size of crystallites [42]. The amount of CO consumed by each sample during the CO-TPR tests is listed in Table 1. One can see that all m-ZrO2 samples consumed higher amount of CO per surface area than a-ZrO2 or t-ZrO2.
3.3. Catalyst activity and selectivity
In order to check if and how phase composition of ZrO2 affects PDH performance, two series of catalytic tests were performed with the purpose (i) to determine the rate of propene formation and (ii) to elucidate an overall scheme of product formation. We shall start with the activity data. Fig. 4(a) shows the rate of propene formation determined at a degree of propane conversion below 10% as a function of crystallite size of m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2. The activity of a-ZrO2 sample is also shown for comparative purposes. Similar to our previous study with m-ZrO2 samples [26], the rate of propene formation over the t-ZrO2 materials increases with a decrease in crystallite size. However, there should be a minimal size of crystallites, below which ZrO2 will lose its high PDH activity as concluded from the fact that the rate of propene formation on a-ZrO2 was low (Fig. 4(a)). As the effect of the size of crystallites on PDH activity is also valid when the rate is calculated per surface area (Fig. S9), the size should determine the concentration of catalytically active sites or their intrinsic activity. It is also worth mentioning that the rate of propene formation per surface area over m-ZrO2 with the smallest size of crystallites is about 7 times higher than that of t-ZrO2 sample composed of the smallest crystallites (Fig. S9). Importantly, as seen in Table 1, the crystallite size of t-ZrO2_4 and m-ZrO2_1 catalysts is 8.1 and 9.1 nm respectively, i.e. very similar. However, these two materials strongly (about 150 times) differ in the rate of propene formation (Table 1, Fig. 4(a)). This result implies that the monoclinic phase of ZrO2 is more preferable for the PDH reaction in terms of activity. This aspect as well as the size effect on the rate of propene formation will be discussed in a below separate section under consideration of additional characterization data. Now we turn our attention to product selectivity.

Reaction conditions: T = 550 °C, feed composition: 40 vol% C3H8 in N2.
To answer the question about the effect of phase composition and the size of crystallites on the selectivity to propene and undesired products, catalytic tests at different degrees of propane conversion were carried out over selected t-ZrO2 samples and one m-ZrO2 with the lowest size of crystallites. The obtained selectivity-conversion plots for propene, coke and cracking products (C1-C2 hydrocarbons) are shown in Fig. 4(b), (c) and (d) respectively. The effect of contact time on product selectivity is shown in Fig. S10.
Regardless of phase composition and crystallite size, the selectivity to propene is above 85% at propane conversion below 5% but decreases with increasing propane conversion or contact time. Contrarily, the selectivity to cracking products and coke (for all t-ZrO2 materials) increases. According to selectivity-contact time plots shown in Fig. S10(b), we can conclude that catalytic transformations of propene should play the most significant role, while gas-phase reactions are less important. Extrapolation of the selectivity to coke over t-ZrO2 to zero propane conversion or zero contact time gives values close to zero. The corresponding value for m-ZrO2 is about 10% and is independent of propane conversion. For all materials, a near to zero selectivity to cracking products will be achieved when the conversion approaches to zero. The selectivity-conversion dependences can be interpreted as follows. Propene is formed directly from propane and then undergoes consecutive transformations. They include formation of carbon deposits over t-ZrO2 and cracking products over all ZrO2 samples (Fig. 5). Coke formation over m-ZrO2 mainly occurs with participation of propane or its surface intermediates also leading to propene.

Fig. 5. Proposed reaction scheme of propane dehydrogenation.
The slope of the selectivity-conversion plot for propene is representative for the ability of ZrO2 for consecutive conversion of this olefin. The steeper the slope, the higher the conversion is. Under this consideration, m-ZrO2 shows the lowest ability for undesired propene transformations in comparison with t-ZrO2 samples. The selectivity to propene over m-ZrO2 decreases from 90% to 83% with an increase in propane conversion from 9% to 33%. Among the t-ZrO2 materials, their ability for secondary propene conversion increases with an increase in the size of crystallites. The selectivity to propene over t-ZrO2 at propane conversion above 10% was lower than over m-ZrO2. The main difference between the catalysts is related to propene conversion into carbon deposits, while phase composition and/or crystallite size do not seem to affect the ability of ZrO2 materials for propene conversion into cracking products. Taking into account the dependence of the selectivity to these products on modified contact time (Fig. S10(c)), one can conclude that they are mainly formed through catalytic transformations of propene. In addition, as shown in our recent study on PDH over m-ZrO2 [26], the selectivity to cracking products becomes lower when the catalysts were reduced in CO instead of H2 before the PDH reaction. If non-catalytic reactions played a decisive role, the selectivity would not depend on the kind of reducing agent.
From our previous study [26], the selectivity to coke over m-ZrO2 was found to depend on the size of crystallites in a similar way as for t-ZrO2 in the present study. From a mechanistic viewpoint, coke originated both from propane and propene, with the former pathway being dominated over m-ZrO2 with 9.1 nm crystallites (the sample with the smallest crystallites of m-ZrO2). The propane aided pathways can be easily understood when assuming that surface intermediates originated from propane can desorb yielding gas-phase propene or interact with each other forming coke. The contribution of each pathway to overall coke formation may, however, depend on the size of crystallites and the kind of ZrO2 phase. According to DFT calculations, desorption of propene formed from propane is easier from t-ZrO2 than from m-ZrO2 (0.07 vs. 0.46 eV (Fig. 1)). Thus, in comparison with t-ZrO2, propene adsorbed on m-ZrO2 may have longer residence time on the surface before escaping to gas phase and accordingly higher probability to react with other adsorbed propene molecule(s). This may be a reason for the dominance of apparent propane-aided pathway of coke formation over m-ZrO2 with 9.1 nm crystallites.
3.4. Active sites and factors affecting their formation
As shown in the preceding section, m-ZrO2 revealed higher activity in PDH than t-ZrO2, although DFT calculations predict that there is no difference between these phases in terms of the kind of active sites and the highest barrier in the course of propane dehydrogenation. The below discussion is focused on identifying possible reason(s) of such apparent discrepancy between the experiment and the theory. Firstly, we measured overall activation energy of propene formation over differently structured ZrO2 materials in the temperature range from 500 to 550 °C. Since catalytically active Zrcus sites can be formed during reductive treatment of ZrO2, the catalysts were always reduced at the highest reaction temperature (550 °C) before performing the PDH reaction to exclude the effect of reduction temperature on the concentration of such sites. The rate of propene formation was measured at 500, 525 and 550 °C and propane conversion was below 10%. The obtained activation energy (Ea) values and the corresponding Arrhenius plots for m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2 with different size of crystallites are shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. S11 respectively. Regardless of the catalysts tested, the Ea values were about 150 kJ·mol−1. The similarity between differently structured ZrO2 in terms of experimentally determined Ea values suggests that the kind of the active site does not depend on catalyst phase composition. It can be composed of two Zrcus cations located at an oxygen vacancy as concluded from DFT calculations.

Fig. 6. Activation energy of propene formation (Ea(C3H6)) determined for (●) m-ZrO2 and (■) t-ZrO2 composed of different crystallites. The catalysts were always reduced at 550 °C, catalytic tests were performed at 500, 525, 550 °C.
Under the above considerations, the different activity of t-ZrO2 and m-ZrO2 as well as t-ZrO2 with different size of crystallites may be related to the number of active sites, i.e. the ability of ZrO2 to generate Zrcus. To verify this idea we tried to quantify such sites in the catalysts from Fig. 4(a). To this end, we performed CO-TPR tests with the purpose to determine the amount of lattice oxygen removed from ZrO2. When lattice oxygen is removed, an oxygen vacancy is formed. As a consequence, the neighboring zirconium cations will become coordinatively unsaturated. Thus, the amount of removed oxygen species should reflect the ability of ZrO2 to generate Zrcus sites upon reductive catalyst treatment before starting the PDH reaction.
According to the CO-TPR results (Fig. 3(b)), different ZrO2 catalysts possess different reducibility. They differ in the amount of released lattice oxygen as well as in the temperature of maximal rate of oxygen removal. As this amount correlates with the concentration of generated Zrcus sites, a correlation between the rate of propene formation and the concentration of removed oxygen species can exist if Zrcus is responsible for propane activation. Indeed, the rate of propene formation nearly linearly increases with the amount of CO consumed in the temperature range from 400 to 900 °C (Fig. 7(a)), however, there are two catalysts with smaller crystallite size stay outside of the fitting line, which maybe explained under assumption that the defective sites, such as corners, edges and steps, couldn’t be characterized by CO-TPR but still active for propane dehydrogenation. Similar dependences are also valid when the amount of removed oxygen was determined by integrating the CO-TPR profiles between 400 and 600 °C or between 400 and 700 °C (Fig. S12). The established relationships strongly suggest that Zrcus site are active in the PDH reaction over ZrO2 and their concentration depends on the ability of ZrO2 to release its lattice oxygen during reductive catalyst treatment.

From our previous study, it was found that bare m-ZrO2 is an ionic conductor and the smaller the crystallite size, the higher the conductivity is. This was explained by higher concentration of anion vacancies or/and easier diffusion of lattice oxygen in smaller crystallite size samples [26]. So, we also performed electrical conductivity tests with t-ZrO2 catalysts at 550 °C in air and N2 for semi-quantitative analysis of the number of bulk anion vacancies. Table S4 shows the conductivity value of selected catalysts at different oxygen partial pressure at 550 °C. As the conductivity values are quite similar under different oxygen partial pressure, it was concluded that ionic conductivity dominates in all t-ZrO2 samples. The effect of phase composition and of the size of ZrO2 crystallites on the conductivity is shown in Fig. S13. Regardless of the kind of ZrO2 phase, the conductivity increased with a decrease in the size. It is also worth mentioning that PDH activity of ZrO2 strongly correlates with the conductivity. As seen in Fig. 7(b) the rate of propene formation increases linearly with rising conductivity. The electrical conductivity data are also in accordance with the results of CO-TPR tests. The higher the reducibility, the easier the oxygen anions move and thus the higher the ionic conductivity is. Thus, these results further support the importance of Zrcus for propane dehydrogenation and prove that the concentration of such sites depends on the kind of ZrO2 phase and the size of crystallites.
3.5. Crystallite size and phase composition effects on coking behaviour
After establishing the factors governing the activity of differently structured ZrO2 in PDH, we turn our discussion to the fundamentals affecting the selectivity to propene and coke (Fig. 4(b), (c)). With this purpose, we initially determined an overall rate of propane conversion into coke (r(coke)/mmol·g−1cat·min−1) at a propane conversion of about 15% (8.5% for t-ZrO2_4). The rate was calculated according to Eq. (10). For both m-ZrO2 and t-ZrO2, the rate increases with a decrease in the size of crystallites (Fig. 8(a)). Nevertheless, the selectivity to coke decreases too. Such obvious inconsistency can be explained as follows. The coke selectivity is defined as the ratio of the rate of propane conversion into coke to the overall rate of propane consumption (Eq. (11)).

Fig. 8. The effect of crystallite size on (a) the rate of propane conversion into coke (r(coke)) and (b) the ratio of the rate of propene formation (r(C3H6)) to r(coke) over ZrO2 catalysts composed of either (●) m-ZrO2 or (■) t-ZrO2.
Since the rate of formation of cracking products is very low, the selectivity to coke is mostly reflected by the ratio of the rate of propene formation to the rate of coke formation (r(C3H6)/r(coke)). Fig. 8(b) shows the dependence of r(C3H6)/r(coke) on the size of crystallites of different ZrO2 materials. It is obvious that this ratio is significantly larger than 1 and decreases with the size. As this ratio is sensitive to structural characteristics of ZrO2, we can conclude that active sites for propene formation and coke formation are different. Furthermore, this relationship provides us hints for improving the selectivity to propene with a simultaneous decrease in the selectivity to coke. Another important conclusion from Fig. 8(b) is related to the effect of the kind of ZrO2 phase on the ratio of r(C3H6)/r(coke), which is in general higher for m-ZrO2 than for t-ZrO2 and moreover decreases less pronounced with an increase in crystallite size. This conclusion is also valid for other degrees of propane conversion (Fig. S14) thus supporting its generality.
Furthermore, operando UV–vis tests were used to investigate the formation of coke species during PDH reaction over t-ZrO2 catalysts with crystallite size of 3.7, 4.6 or 5.7 nm and over m-ZrO2 with 9.1, 13.0 or 43.4 nm crystallites. For all these catalysts, an initial propane conversion was between 5% and 12% and the selectivity to propene varied from 80% to 100% (Fig. S15). The obtained UV–vis spectra of three t-ZrO2 samples in form of the relative Kubelka-Munk function (F(Rrel) are shown in Fig. 9(a–c). F(Rrel) increased with time on propane stream across the entire range of wavelengths as a consequence of formation of coke species. Absorption bands with the maxima at about 300, 420, 600 and 750 nm can be tentatively identified in the UV–vis spectra of ZrO2 under PDH conditions. The latter two bands can be ascribed to polyaromatic graphitic species [43]. It is clearly seen in Fig. 9(a–c) that the relative ratio of the intensity of absorption bands in higher absorbing wavelength range to that of lower absorbing wavelength increases with increasing crystallite size. This means that the larger the size of t-ZrO2 crystallites, the higher the fraction of polyaromatic graphitic species is. This conclusion is also applicable to m-ZrO2 samples (Fig. S16). To derive further mechanistic insights into coke formation, we analyze changes in the UV–vis spectra with rising time on stream under PDH conditions. Temporal changes of F(Rrel) at 300, 420, 600, or 750 nm are given in Fig. S17. As expected F(Rrel) at all the wavelengths increased with time on stream thus proving that carbon deposits are continuously formed. Some details about this process can be obtained from analyzing temporal evolution of the ratio of F(Rrel) at 750 nm to that at 300 nm (F(Rrel)750/F(Rrel)300). This ratio is given in Fig. 9(d) and qualitatively represents the relative fraction of polyaromatic and less polymerized species. For all materials, this ratio is well below 1 within a few first minutes on propane stream and then increases with the rising time. Such dependence can be understood when assuming that coke precursors (seeds) composed of a few propene molecules are initially formed. Due to their low oligomerization degree, they should absorb light in UV range. Such precursors can further react with propene or surface propane fragments to yield higher oligomerized carbon-containing deposits absorbing visible light. As seen in Fig. 9(d), the F(Rrel)750/F(Rrel)300 ratio increases with an increase in the size of ZrO2 crystallites and its temporal changes are also faster. In other words, larger crystallites favor formation of polyaromatic graphitic coke, low aggregated coke precursor is also formed on smaller crystallite size catalysts.

PDH was performed at 550 °C using a feed containing 40 vol% C3H8 in N2.
On the basis of the above discussion, the size effect on coke formation can be explained as follows. As the ratio of r(C3H6)/r(coke) increases with a decrease in the size of ZrO2 crystallites, it is reasonable to suggest that there are at least two different active sites for propane/propene adsorption and further reaction. One type is Zrcus sites, which are active for propene formation (Fig. 1) and may also form coke but with a significantly lower rate in comparison with the rate of propene formation. Another type might be regular surface Zr cations, which can adsorb propene and catalyze its oligomerization. When keeping in mind that ZrO2 reducibility increases with a decrease in the size of crystallites (Table 1), the ratio of Zcus/Zr will also increase. Thus, the concentration of regular sites decreases and consequently a probability of interaction between several adsorbed propylene to form heavier hydrocarbons being coke precursor lowers too. It is also worth mentioning that the rate of coke formation related to catalyst surface area, in general, increases with a decrease in the size of crystallites in a similar way as the rate related to catalyst amount (Fig. S18 and Fig. S14(a–c) respectively). However, the area-related rate increases after passing a minimum at the crystallite size of 33 nm. Such behavior is probably related to the fact that the surface fraction of Zrcus in ZrO2 with large crystallites is very low. Regular surface Zr cations are the dominant species favoring coke formation. This explanation is indirectly supported by our previous results on PDH over V-based catalysts [17], [44]. Coke formation was established to depend on the speciation of supported VOx species. The larger the species, the higher the selectivity to coke was.
4. Conclusions
In this study we demonstrated that the activity of bare ZrO2 and particularly the selectivity to propene in non-oxidative propane dehydrogenation can be tuned through the kind of crystal phase (monoclinic vs. tetragonal) and crystallite size. For both monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2, the rate of propene formation was established to increase with a decrease in the latter parameter. However, monoclinic ZrO2 shows higher activity than tetragonal ZrO2. This was explained by the fact that the former materials can release their lattice oxygen easier thus ensure higher concentration of Zrcus. DFT calculations suggest that two of such sites form the active site on the surface both of monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 for propane dehydrogenation. This conclusion was also supported experimentally through establishing correlations between the rate of propene formation and the amount of lattice oxygen removed in CO-TPR or the ionic conductivity of ZrO2. Thus, the different PDH activity of monoclinic and tetragonal ZrO2 is related to the number of active Zrcus sites and not to their different intrinsic activity. In addition, the selectivity to propene over monoclinic ZrO2 was higher than over tetragonal ZrO2. This was attributed to a higher ratio between Zrcus sites and those responsible for coke formation. The obtained fundamentals provide hints for designing ZrO2-based catalysts with improved activity and may be applied to another metal oxides previously used or not used for alkane dehydrogenation.
