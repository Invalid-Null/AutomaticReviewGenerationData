 Unfortunately this document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation. It discusses the synthesis of a nickel-aluminum layered double hydroxide platinum nanocatalyst and its application for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol and propane dehydrogenation. However, the propane dehydrogenation mentioned does not appear to involve oxidation or be converting propane specifically to propylene. Therefore, I do not believe this document contains information relevant to PDH or ODH processes for propylene production.
