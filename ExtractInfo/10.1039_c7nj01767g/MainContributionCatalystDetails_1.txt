 Unfortunately the document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses the fabrication of a Ni-Al layered double hydroxide (LDH) platinum nanocatalyst and evaluates its performance for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol and in the reaction of propane dehydrogenation. However, there is no indication that the propane dehydrogenation reaction convert propane to propylene specifically. The document does not discuss PDH or ODH processes.
