The provided document discusses the effect of H2O presence on the propane decomposition reaction over Pd in a proton conducting membrane reactor. It does not focus on improving catalyst performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH) or oxidative propane dehydrogenation (ODH) specifically. The main scientific contribution appears to be understanding the effect of steam on the reaction kinetics and product selectivity, not advancing a novel catalyst. Therefore, I have indicated this is not directly relevant to summarizing advancements in PDH or ODH catalyst performance.
