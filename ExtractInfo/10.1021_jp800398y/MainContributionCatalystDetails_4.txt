 Unfortunately the given document does not seem to be related to propane dehydrogenation or oxidative propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses lithium ion diffusion on fluorinated graphene surfaces, which does not seem relevant to propylene production from propane. Since the document is not relevant, I will skip extracting the catalyst information and just output that the document is not related.
