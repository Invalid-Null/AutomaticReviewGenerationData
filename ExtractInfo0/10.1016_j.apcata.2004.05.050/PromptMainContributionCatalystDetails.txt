VOx species on alumina at high vanadia loadings and calcination temperature and their role in the ODP reaction
Abstract
Vanadium species formed on the alumina support after calcination between 773 and 973 K at vanadium loadings between 4.45 and 13.2 wt.% were characterized with different methods (
NMR, ESR, H2-TPR and in situ UV–vis-DRS) and tested in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane. By calcination at 873 K, beside dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ surface species mainly in tetrahedral coordination, a crystalline AlVO4 phase was formed. The portion of vanadium present as AlVO4 increases with increasing vanadium loadings (e.g. about 60 at 13.2 wt.%). The domain size of the polymerized V5+ species is only weakly influenced by the vanadium loadings at calcination up to 873 K. It is suggested that both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are active in propane dehydrogenation. The AlVO4 phase and bulk-like V2O5 have only a low catalytic activity. The highest propene selectivity was obtained for the sample with the highest dispersion of the isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species.
1. Introduction
Supported vanadium oxides have been widely used as catalysts for a number of reactions. The molecular structure of the surface vanadium oxide species and the catalytic properties are influenced by the method of preparation, the nature of support, promotors and environmental conditions [1]. Supports like MgO, TiO2, ZrO2, Al2O3 and SiO2 have been employed to disperse vanadium over their surfaces [2]. Vanadia species dispersed on alumina offer a broad range of VOx structures [3] and show a high activity and selectivity for the production of alkenes from the corresponding alkanes [4].
Different techniques like XRD, Raman spectroscopy, solid-state NMR, ESR, TPR, FT-IR and UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) have been applied to characterize the structure of vanadium species on the surface of alumina [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], their reducibility or redox properties [15], [16], [17], [18], their degree of polymerization [5], [9], the strength of interaction between vanadium and alumina [19], [20] and the acid–base properties [1], [21].
Depending on the vanadium loadings, different vanadium oxide species (V5+) were formed on the surface of alumina after calcination. Mainly isolated and polymerized VO4 units were observed at coverages up to a monolayer [1], [5], [13] while VO6 octahedra were predominant on catalyst surfaces at higher vanadium loadings [1]. Generally, the oxygen coordination of V5+ ranges from tetrahedral at low coverages to octahedral at high coverages [1]. At medium and high vanadium loadings, crystalline V2O5 is formed in addition to amorphous vanadium oxide [2], [10], [14], [19]. The concentration of polyvanadate structures and the degree of polymerization increases with rising vanadium loadings [5], [9]. ESR spectra also showed the presence of a minor amount of octahedrally coordinated V4+ species at vanadium coverages below a monolayer [12], [22]. The TPR profile of the surface vanadium oxide species is influenced by the amount of vanadium [14], [18] and therefore by the ratio of isolated and polymerized surface vanadium oxide species [23]. Different opinions exist regarding the question which vanadium species are easier to reduce: isolated and low oligomerized [24] or highly polymerized and bulk-like species [3], [23].
Different sites are suggested as being active in alkane dehydrogenation [3], [5], [21], [25] but their role and nature are still under discussion [23].
Most of the studies mentioned above were carried out with catalytic material calcined up to 823 K. The oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is a strong exothermic reaction and maximum temperatures of about 873 K or higher were observed in the catalytic bed using a more concentrated feed [26]. The objective of the present work is, for that reason, the study of the nature and properties of the vanadium oxide species formed on the alumina support calcined at high temperature of 873 K at relatively high vanadium loadings between 4.5 and 13.2 wt.% vanadium. Additionally, the influence of the calcination temperature was studied in the range between 773 and 973 K. Different techniques like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), H2-TPR, electron spin resonance, and in situ-UV–vis-DRS spectroscopy have been applied. The results of characterization will be compared with the catalytic performance in the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane in order to get information about relations between phase composition, coordination, reducibility and dispersion of the vanadium species formed at high vanadium loading.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
V2O5 (Merck), γ-Al2O3 (Degussa) and boehmite (Disperal, Condea) were used for the catalyst preparation. The corresponding amount of V2O5 was solved in oxalic acid at 348 K and 0.5 g polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) were added under stirring until the solution became clear. The clear solution was cooled down to 295 K and 2 g boehmite and 2 g γ-Al2O3 were added under continuous stirring. Upon intensive stirring the viscosity of the slurry increased with time. The highly viscous suspension was dried at 353 K at about 900 mbar and, finally, calcined in air at 873 K for 6 h (for sample names see also Table 1). The dried sample which contained 8.9 wt.% vanadium was divided into three parts, which were calcined under air for 6 h at 773, 873 and 973 K, respectively.

2.2. Characterization
Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, Perkin-Elmer) was used to determine the bulk composition of catalysts.
The specific surface area (SBET) was determined by nitrogen adsorption/desorption at 77 K using a Gemini III equipment (Micromeritics).
The phase composition of the catalyst after calcination was studied by X-ray diffraction analysis with a Phillips diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation.
EPR spectra at 77 K were recorded taken on c.w. spectrometer ELEXSYS 500-10/12 (Bruker) in X-band using a finger dewar. For spectra simulation a computer program was used [27]. Calculations were based on the Spin–Hamiltonian as follows:
where β is the Bohr magneton, S the electron spin operator, g the g-tensor, A the hyperfine tensor, and I is the nuclear spin operator.
Diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra were obtained with a Cary 400 UV–vis spectrometer (Varian) equipped with an in situ diffuse reflectance accessory (Harrick). The catalysts were used as powders diluted with calcined α-Al2O3. The reflectance spectra were converted into Kubelka–Munk function F(R). For low F(R) values this function is proportional to the concentration of V species. The in situ diffuse reflectance spectra were taken in the range 12,500–45,000 cm−1 (230–800 nm). At the beginning, the samples were pretreated with oxygen at 773 K (1 h) followed by a reduction with a mixture of H2/N2 (20 vol.% H2) at the same temperature. The edge energy (Eg) was determined by finding the intercept of the straight line in the low-energy rise of a plot of [F(R∞) × hν]2 against hν [23].
Solid-state NMR measurements were carried out on a Varian Unity plus 500 spectrometer at 11.7 T. The
MAS NMR spectra were recorded at 131.4 MHz using a Doty supersonic probe with zirconia rotors of 5 mm diameter. The spinning rates were 10 kHz. Short excitation pulses of 1 μs duration and recycle delays of 1 s were applied. The spectral width was 1 MHz. The
NMR spectra at 11.7 T are dominated by the effects of chemical shift anisotropy (CSA). To overcome receiver dead-time effects spin-echo pulse sequences π/2–τ–π with τ of 100 μs were used for the very broad
NMR spectra. For comparison also, conventional single pulse spectra of the static samples were recorded. Chemical shifts are given in ppm related to VOCl3 and an aqueous AlCl3 solution, respectively.
The reduction behaviour of vanadium oxide species was studied by means of TPR using following conditions: flow of 5% H2 in Ar with a rate of 50 ml/min, heating rate of 10 K/min to a final temperature of 1100 K. The water formed or desorbed during the TPR was removed by molecular sieve 4A before the flow passes the thermal conductivity detector (TCD). The peak area of the hydrogen consumption plot was calibrated by argon pulses into the TPR gas flow. Spectra were de-convoluted into Gaussian bands using the GRAMS/386 program.
The average vanadium valence state of the calcined samples was also determined by means of potentiometric titration [28].
2.3. Catalytic testing
Catalytic experiments were carried out in a fixed bed quartz reactor with an internal diameter of 5 mm in the range of catalyst bed. For a better temperature control of the strongly exothermic reaction the catalyst (64 mg) was diluted with quartz grains (1:9) of the same size. The grain size was between 255 and 355 μm. The quartz material alone did not show any catalytic activity below 773 K. The feed consisted of 30 vol.% C3H8, 15 vol.% O2 and 55 vol.% Ne. The total flow rate and the reaction temperature varied between 50 and 150 ml/min and 493–693 K, respectively. On-line μ-GC was used for analysis of educts and products. Under all reaction conditions, the main products were propene, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide, and only minor amounts of ethane and ethylene were detected.
3. Results
3.1. BET surface area and phase composition
Specific surface area for the samples calcined at 873 K decreases from 175 g/m2 to 47 g/m2 with rising vanadium loadings (Table 1). An increasing calcination temperature from 773 to 973 K from constant vanadium loadings (8.9 wt.%) resulted in a decrease of the surface area from 137 to 11 m2/g. The apparent VOx-surface density related to the total number of vanadium ions in the samples increased with increasing vanadium loadings from 4 to 33 VOx/nm−2 and from 8 to 97 nm−2 upon enhancing the calcination temperature from 773 K to 973 K for the sample with 8.9 wt.% vanadium. The calculated values of the surface density of the vanadium species for all samples were higher than the theoretic value for a monolayer coverage with monovanadates (2.3 VOx/nm2) [3]. The vanadium content determined by potentiometric titration was approximately the same as the vanadium content determined by ICP.
For the samples with vanadium loadings up to 8.9 wt.% and calcined up to 873 K only a γ-Al2O3 phase and no vanadia phase were observed by XRD (Table 1). However the diffraction patterns for the sample V (13/873) showed the presence of an AlVO4-phases (JP 39-276). Diffraction peaks of a crystalline V2O5 phase were not detected in this sample. After calcination at 973 K diffraction peaks of a crystallized V2O5 phase (JP 72-598) were obtained beside those of γ-Al2O3. TEM images of this sample showed that Al2O3 crystals and needles of a V2O5 phase coexist.
3.2. NMR
In the uncalcined samples no
NMR signal could be detected. That means that under calcination V4+ ions are oxidized to V5+ ions which are NMR active. The
MAS NMR spectra of the samples calcined at 873 K in dependence on the vanadium loadings are presented in Fig. 1a. The
MAS spectra recorded with spin echo techniques showed a dominating, unresolved broad signal superimposed by three sharp peaks at −772, −740 and −658 ppm and the corresponding spinning sidebands. The intensity of these peaks increased with increasing vanadium loadings. These peaks are attributed to an AlVO4 phase [11].

NMR spectra of calcined samples (873 K) for different vanadium loading recorded with spin echo techniques (a), recorded with single-pulse technique (b), and after dehydration (1 h, 573 K) (c).
In order to get further information about the structure of the VOx complexes on the alumina support after calcination, static
NMR spectra of the sample were also recorded with single-pulse technique (Fig. 1b). Under the experimental conditions, the broad static spectra reflect apparent peaks coming from the orthogonal component of the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) tensor. This peak at −300 ppm is attributed to octahedrally coordinated vanadium species, peaks between −500 and −800 ppm were due to tetrahedrally coordinated ones [7]. The relative portion of the peak at −300 ppm decreased with increasing vanadium loadings, and is assigned not only to bulk-like V2O5 but also to accessible tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species on the surface, which are additionally coordinated with two water molecules forming VO6 octahedra. The presence of accessible VO4 species was concluded from the
NMR spectra of the dehydrated samples (Fig. 1c) because the relative intensity of the peak at −300 ppm in the NMR spectra decreased after dehydration. At the highest vanadium loadings (13.2 wt.%), this peak disappears almost completely. The peaks at −631, −784 and −792 ppm increase with higher vanadium loadings and arise from the crystalline AlVO4 phase as discussed above. The relative amount of vanadium in the AlVO4 phase was determined by weighting of the peak area of the
MAS NMR peaks of these phase in comparison to the total peak area and is listed in Table 6.
The influence of calcination temperature on the
MAS NMR spectra is presented in Fig. 2a. At 773 K, the main contribution to the NMR spectra recorded with spin echo techniques (Fig. 2a) comes from disturbed VOx polyhedra. No indications of the AlVO4 phase were found in this NMR spectrum. The isotropic chemical shift of the spinning sidebands is near to that of V2O5. After increasing the calcination temperatures to 873 K, the formation of the crystalline AlVO4 phase was observed. After calcination at 973 K, crystalline V2O5 domains represented by an isotropic value of the chemical shift of −609 ppm dominate the NMR spectrum superimposed on an unresolved broad signal. The latter signal probably arises from distorted VO4 tetrahedra or V2O5 with high disorder. The corresponding static
NMR spectra are shown in Fig. 2b and c. The sample calcined at 773 K showed peaks attributed to VO6 octahedra (−300 ppm) and tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species (−500 to −800 ppm). With increasing calcination temperature to 873 K, the amount of tetrahedrally coordinated V species increases in comparison to VO6 octahedra. A further increase of the calcination temperature to 997 K led to the characteristic NMR spectra of V2O5 with a nearly axial CSA tensor. However, it cannot be excluded that VO4 species are also present. The relative portion of the pseudo VO6 octahedra, which were formed from tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ by coordination with two water molecules, decreases with increasing calcination temperature as can be seen from the comparison of Fig. 2b and c.

3.3. H2-TPR
The TPR-profiles of the catalyst samples are shown in Fig. 3a–c for increasing vanadium loadings and in Fig. 3d,b,e for increasing calcination temperature at constant vanadium loadings. The sample V(4.5/873) showed a broad reduction peak with a maximum at about 788 K and a small shoulder at 893 K. An increase of vanadium loadings to 8.9 wt.% vanadium led to a second maximum peak at about 887 K beside the peak at 786 K. A further increase of the amount of vanadium to 13.2 wt.% led to an increase of the maximum reduction peak at 887 K in comparison to the peak with a maximum at about 788 K.

Besides the vanadium loadings, the calcination temperature also has an influence on the TPR profile. The TPR pattern of the sample with 8.9 wt.% vanadium calcined at 773 K shows a broad reduction peak with a maximum at 788 K. An increase of calcination temperature of 100 K gave a second reduction maximum at higher temperatures. The sample calcined at 997 K again showed two reduction maxima at higher temperatures (853 and 997  K), however, the TPR pattern was clearly different from pure bulk V2O5 as can be seen in Fig. 3f.
The average vanadium valence state of the calcined samples given in Table 2 was calculated from the H2 consumption assuming a complete reduction of the vanadium V5+ to V3+ [28]. The values of the average vanadium valence state determined from hydrogen consumption are lower than the one necessary for a complete reduction of V5+ to V3+ and also lower than the average values determined by potentiometric titration given also in Table 2.

The results of modelling of the TPR profiles using Gaussian-shaped peaks [24] are presented in Table 3. The TPR profiles of all studied samples were fitted using four peaks as shown in Fig. 3a–e. For the samples calcined up to 873 K, the position of the first reduction peaks was approximately the same. The position of the second peak shifted slightly with increasing vanadium loadings and calcination temperature to higher temperatures. Increasing vanadium loadings led also to an increase of the percentage of the area of the third peak in comparison to the area of the first reduction peak. The sample with 8.9 wt.% vanadium calcined at 773 K had the lowest relative percentage of the area of the third peak but the highest percentage of the area of the first and second TPR peak.

3.4. ESR
Electron spin resonance spectroscopy was used in order to get information about the V4+ species which were present after calcination. The concentration of distorted, octahedrally coordinated V4+ centers for two samples is shown in Table 4 and was determined by using a double cavity, which contained a VOSO4 spinstandard with a known spin concentration (3.98 × 10−20 spins/g) [29]. The values in this table show that the part of octahedral V4+ species determined by ESR is clearly lower than the total amount of V4+ species determined by potentiometric titration. This suggests that the main part of V4+ species in these samples has a tetrahedral coordination. Tetrahedrally coordinated V4+ species are usually not detected by ESR at 77 K due to short relaxation times.

V(8.9/873) 1.8 1.6 0.2 0.02
The ESR spectra of the different samples showed the characteristic hyperfine splitting (hfs) multiplets of well-isolated V4+ species in distorted octahedral coordination (Fig. 4) [10], [30]. The hyperfine signals are superimposed by a broad isotropic line, which arises from magnetically interacting V4+ species. Spectra simulation revealed that the latter comprise the majority of the octahedral V4+ species observable at 77 K. All spectra of freshly calcined samples could be fitted assuming these two types of vanadium species, as can be seen in Fig. 4. The principle values of the g and A tensor are almost the same for V contents between 4.5 and 13.2 wt.% indicating that isolated V4+ species of similar geometry are formed on the surface of alumina. With increasing vanadium loadings, the amount of interacting V4+ species in comparison to the isolated one increases. This holds for increasing calcination temperatures too. The spectra of the catalyst calcined at 973 K contain only a few isolated species and the spectrum was dominated by the signal of V4+ species coupled by magnetic exchange interaction.

3.5. UV–vis-DRS
The UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) of the calcined VOx/Al2O3 samples at room temperature are presented in Fig. 5. In the range between 20,000 and 48,000 cm−1, electron transitions of V5+ due to the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) can be observed [31]. The UV–vis spectra of the samples show two braod LMCT bands with a maximum at about 43,000 and near 34,000 cm−1. The spectra also show bands of lower intensity between 20,000 and 25,000 cm−1, in particular for the samples V(8.9/773) and V(13/873). Neither increasing vanadium loadings nor rising calcination temperature caused a substantial change in the UV–vis-DRS spectra for the samples calcined up to 873 K. From the inset in Fig. 5, it can be seen that the sample V(8.9/700) has an additional intensive band in the region between 25,000 and 18,000 cm−1.

UV–vis-DRS spectra after treatment with oxygen at 773 K are shown in Fig. 6a. The UV–vis spectra of oxidized catalysts showed again the typical LMCT bands of V5+ ions with a maximum around 43,000 and 34,000 cm−1. The shoulder at around 25,000 cm−1, which were observed for the samples V(8.9/773) and V(13/873) without heating in oxygen, disappeared but there were still signals in the region up to about 20,000 cm−1.

A following successive treatment with H2/N2 led to a significant decrease in intensity of the LMCT bands with a maximum at about 34,000 cm−1 as shown in Fig. 6b. At the same time, the intensity of the band higher than 40,000 cm−1 (below 300 nm) increased. The reduced catalysts showed LMCT bands only up to 25,000 cm−1. Besides the LMCT bands, the reduced samples exhibit new bands in the range between 12,500 and 22,500 cm−1. In all samples, a re-oxidation leads again to the UV–vis spectra of the oxidized samples, which were discussed above.
3.6. Catalytic testing
The rates of propane consumption and propene formation related to the amount of vanadium content were determined at 613 K at propane conversion near 1% and oxygen conversion below 5% (Table 6). The highest rate of propane conversion was found for the sample V(8.9/773). The rate of propane conversion was slightly lower for samples V(4.5/873) and V(8.9/873) and decreased with further vanadium loadings. Rising the calcination temperature from 773 to 993 K led to a less active catalyst, as reflected by decreasing propane consumption rate. The activity of the sample V(8.9/973) is about ten times lower in comparison to the other samples. Propene formation rate related to the amount of vanadium decreases with increasing vanadium loadings and increasing calcination temperature. Product selectivity and apparent activation energy of propene formation are also shown in Table 5. Propene selectivities at this low propane conversion are higher than 80%. Differences in CO selectivity are much higher than differences in CO2 selectivity between the catalysts. At this small conversion, the sample V(8.9/973) has the highest propene selectivity and the lowest CO selectivity.

V(8.9/973) 0.26 0.25 95.3 3.0 4.7 98
The apparent activation energies of propene formation were calculated from an Arrhenius plot. For the samples calcined between 773 and 873 K, the vanadium loadings influence the apparent activation energy of the propene formation only slightly. The values are in the range between 73 and 79 kJ/mol. After calcination at 973 K, the apparent activation energy for propene formation increased to about 98 kJ/mol.
Catalytic experiments were also carried out at higher propane conversion in order to follow product selectivities with propane conversion (Fig. 7). For all samples, propene selectivity decreases with rising C3H8 conversion. The decrease of propene selectivity with increasing propane conversion for the sample V(4.5/873) was clearly lower compared with that of the samples V(8.9/873) and V(13.3/873). The sample V(8.9/773) exhibited a higher propene selectivity than the sample V(8.9/873) at approximately the same conversion. The sample V(8.9/973), which possessed the highest propene selectivity at low conversion, showed a fast drop of propene selectivity with increasing propane conversion. The differences of propene selectivity between the different catalysts are connected mainly with the CO-formation. The CO2-formation fits for all catalysts approximately the same selectivity conversion relationship.

4. Discussion
4.1. Phase composition
An AlVO4 phase was the only by XRD detected vanadium containing phase for the samples calcined up to 873 K. However,
MAS NMR spectroscopy provides evidence for the formation of crystalline AlVO4 already at much lower concentration than XRD (Fig. 1).
The part of the vanadium in the AlVO4 phase in comparison to the total amount of vanadium increases with increasing vanadium loadings as shown by
NMR and XRD (Fig. 1). About 60% of the vanadium was present as AlVO4 phase (Table 6) at a vanadium loadings of 13.2 wt.%. From these results it can be assumed that the formation of the AlVO4 phase during calcination is influenced by the distribution of the adsorbed vanadium species (probably V4+) after drying. A low vanadium dispersion promotes the formation of the AlVO4 phase. Tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species with more than one V–O–Al bond were regarded as precursor for the formation of this phase [7]. Here, the NMR results (Fig. 2) point out that disturbed VOx polyhedra, mainly in octahedral coordination, can be considered as precursor for the AlVO4 phase. The formation of the AlVO4 phase at the expense of octahedrally coordinated VOx species does not stabilize the specific surface area of the alumina (Table 1).

The AlVO4 phase was previously detected at vanadium loadings of 10 wt.% after calcination at 773 K [7], but under our conditions the AlVO4 phase is formed at temperatures higher than 773 K. The AlVO4 phase should decompose at temperatures higher than 953 K to V2O5 and alumina (Fig. 2) but this phase was also observed after calcination at 973 K [18].
4.2. Coordination of VOx species
The energy of the LMCT bands in the UV–vis-DRS spectra can be used to obtain information on the coordination of different vanadia species. The bands of V5+ falling in the 20,000–30,000 cm−1 region are characteristic for octahedral coordination and in the 30,000–35,000 cm−1 region for tetrahedral coordination [30]. The bands with wave numbers higher than 35,000 cm−1 are associated with LMCT transitions of isolated tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ ions [24] and also with LMCT transitions of V4+ and/or V3+ ions [33], [34]. The d–d transitions of V4+ ions are located between 10,000 and 30,000 cm−1, and V3+ ions have d–d transitions in the region 8000–30,000 cm−1 [23]. The d–d transitions at frequencies higher than 20,000 cm−1 are generally masked by more intense CT transitions and the intensities of the d–d transitions should be generally 10–30 times lower than those of CT transitions [30].
The UV–vis spectra of the calcined samples (Fig. 5) show a maximum at ca. 34,000 cm−1. This band is assigned to V5+ ions in tetrahedral coordination with a polymerized structure [24]. The band at higher wavenumbers (near 43,000 cm−1) is assigned mainly to isolated vanadium V5+ ions in tetrahedral coordination [24] and also to V4+ ions present in low concentration as proven by ESR. The CT bands due to the VO double bond which appears near 26,000 cm−1 were also present as shoulder in the UV–vis spectra. These bands may be assigned to 2D patches of pentacoordinated V5+ ions [24] or V5+ ions in a distorted octahedral structure [30]. A band near 21,000 cm−1 was also attributed to the presence of crystalline V2O5 [28]. Therefore, the bands near 26,000 and 21,000 cm−1 are assigned to bulk-like vanadium species with low crystallinity in distorted octahedral coordination. The shoulder at about 25,000 cm−1, which was observed for the samples V(8.9/773) and V(13/873), disappeared after heating of the samples in oxygen (Fig. 6a). Therefore, this shoulder is attributed in agreement with NMR results to octahedral V5+ species that loose additionally coordinated water molecules upon heating.
The edge energy (Eg) of the LMCT transitions of V5+ ions can also be used to elucidate the local structure of V5+ ions and the degree of polymerization of VOx species on different supports [9] because the position of the absorption edge for the low energy LMCT transitions correlates with the domain size of transition metal oxides [3], [35]. A decrease in edge energy with increasing vanadium loadings was related to an increase of the vanadium domain size [3] and in a shift from tetrahedral to octahedral coordination [9]. Using this method it was found that the Eg values of the oxidized samples for the most intensive bands were around 3 eV. From these Eg values it can be derived that after calcination up to 873 K mainly V5+ tetrahedra are present [9]. A higher amount of tetrahedral V5+ species in comparison to V5+ in octahedral coordination for the samples calcined up to 873 K was also found by the NMR studies, even at high vanadium loadings (Fig. 1). The results also support the above assumption that the AlVO4 phase was formed at the expense of bulk-like or crystalline V2O5. Concerning the small amount of the V4+ species present after calcination, it was also found that the number of octahedrally coordinated V4+ species was clearly lower than the number of tetrahedrally coordinated V4+ species.
The coordination of the vanadium is strongly influenced not only by the amount of vanadium but also by the temperature of calcination. At temperatures lower than 823 K, the coordination of the V5+ ions changes with increasing vanadium loadings from tetrahedral to octahedral coordination [15], [36], and crystalline V2O5 was also observed [10], [14].
However, calcination at temperatures around 873 K leads here to the formation of mainly tetrahedrally coordinated vanadium species, even at high vanadium loadings as shown.
4.3. Dispersion of VOx species and degree of polymerization
Vanadium loadings influence the specific surface area of the catalysts. BET surface areas decrease from 136 to 47 g/m2 for the samples calcined at 873 K with rising vanadium loadings from 4.5 to 13.2 wt.% (Table 1). An explanation for the decrease of the specific surface area could be that with increasing vanadium loadings and calcination temperature pores of the alumina were blocked with vanadium species because of the strong interaction between vanadia and alumina which leads to the formation of the AlVO4 phase. Otherwise, the measured BET surface area may be influenced by a low specific surface area of the highly crystalline AlVO4 (or V2O5 phase (V8.9/973)), whose amount increased with increasing vanadia loadings.
On the other hand, however, it is assumed that a reduction of surface area with increasing vanadium loadings is related to a decreasing dispersion of VOx species on the support. It was already shown by UV–vis and VMR spectroscopy that mainly tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species exists on the alumina surface, whereas the amount of V4+ species is only small. From these species, only a minor amount is octahedrally coordinated and only these species can be observed by ESR spectroscopy. The contribution of isolated V4+ ions to the measured ESR spectrum decreased with increasing vanadium loadings and with increasing calcination temperature. However, the relative portion of polymerized octahedrally coordinated V4+ species in the ESR spectra is always clearly higher. After calcination at 993 K, ESR signals of isolated V4+ species were detected with the same ESR parameter (Fig. 4b), which means that isolated and polymerized vanadium species coexists even at calcination at 973 K. It is assumed that isolated and polymerized V5+ ions in tetrahedral coordination coexist even at high vanadium loadings with a similar ratio than observed for octahedral V4+ species, probably.
In analogy with other studies [3], [8], [9], [37], one might expect an increasing domain size of the VOx species with rising vanadium loadings. However, the differences in the UV–vis-DRS spectra between the samples (Fig. 5, Fig. 6) calcined up to 873 K were only small and no clear shift to lower wave numbers was observed with increasing vanadium loadings. These results indicate that in these samples the domain size of the dispersed vanadium species is approximately always the same and only the number of polymerized vanadia species increases with increasing vanadium loadings.
4.4. Reducibility of the VOx species
The TPR results show that the reduction behaviour of the VOx/Al2O3 catalysts depends strongly on vanadium loadings and calcination temperature. In order to rationalize the pattern of the TPR spectra the plots were de-convoluted into four discrete Gaussian-shaped peaks similar as in [15], [24], [38]. Each peak was assigned to a single or step-wise reduction of a certain V5+ species considering results of the NMR and UV–vis-DRS. The relative fitting parameters, peak maximum position and percentage peak area are presented in Table 3.
It has to be mentioned that the de-convolution of the TPR pattern must be considered as an approximation, but in combination with the results of the UV–vis and NMR spectroscopy some useful remarks can be derived:
(a)
The first TPR peak (M1, see Table 3) is centered at 721–723 K. No shift of the maximum temperature in H2 consumption was observed, but for the same calcination temperature the intensity decreases with increasing vanadium loadings (Fig. 3). The peak area of the first peak is always low in comparison to the area of the second reduction peak. The peak area decreased with increasing vanadium loadings and calcination temperature. The sample V(8.9/773) shows the highest relative peak area for the first reduction peak.
(b)
The second peak (M2) centered between 785 and 803 K is again predominant in the sample calcined at 773 K and its relative percentage area decreases with increasing vanadium loadings. The peak position of M2 shifts with increasing vanadium loadings and calcination temperature to slightly higher temperatures.
It is assumed that the first and the second peaks are related to the reduction of isolated and polymerized V5+ ions in tetrahedral coordination. This assumption is in agreement with the results of kinetic modelling of VOx/Al2O3 TPR pattern, where these peaks are assigned to the reduction of isolated monomeric or oligomeric vanadium oxide species of moderate size and two-dimensional surface polymeric vanadium oxide species [18].
(c)
The temperature maximum of the third TPR peak (M3) centered between 861 and 898 K increased with increasing vanadium loadings and calcination temperature. The relative percentage of the area also increases. The sample calcined at 773 K has the lowest value (5.3%). On the basis of literature data [18], [20] and the NMR and UV–vis spectroscopic results, this peak can be attributed to the reduction of the AlVO4 phase. The fourth peak (M4) which describes the tailing on the high temperature side could belong to the reduction of bulk-like vanadium species with low crystallinity [18]. The presence of bulk like vanadium species was proven by NMR (Fig. 2). Both methods, TPR and NMR, indicate that the relative amount of these species decreases with increasing vanadium loadings.
(d)
The reduction pattern of the sample V(8.9/973) is more complex because bulk-like and crystalline V2O5 and some dispersed VOx species coexists. Calcination temperature was close to the melting point of V2O5 moieties (963 K) and could lead to a different reduction mechanism [39]. The reduction of bulk-like V2O5 species can be described only with a very broad peak or using more than one Gaussian-shaped peak [24].
The average vanadium valence state in the calcined samples was determined by potentiometric titration and calculated from the hydrogen consumption in the TPR (Table 2). Significantly lower values were obtained from TPR results when a complete reduction of V(V) and (IV) to V(III) is assumed, as concluded in previous studies [14], [16], [23]. However, a deficit of H2 consumption can also be caused by an incomplete reduction of predominantly present V(V) to V(III). Considering the low concentration of V(IV) observed in the calcined samples by ESR the average vanadium valence state obtained by potentiometric titration seems to be more reliable. For V5+ surface ions on alumina it has also been found that the hydrogen consumption corresponds to 0.5 H2/V [15], [40].
The reduction of the V5+ species at 773 K was also studied by UV–vis-DRS using H2 feed (Fig. 6). After reduction of the oxidized sample with H2, the UV–vis spectra of all samples show a lower intensity than the oxidized spectra (Fig. 6). A comparison of the intensity of the different bands inside of the UV–vis spectra shows a decrease in intensity of the bands lower than 37,500 cm−1 and a considerable increase of the intensity of the UV–vis bands above 37,500 cm−1. The bands in this region were attributed to isolated tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ ions and to V4+ ions. Comparing the UV–vis spectra of the oxidized and the reduced samples it can be assumed that both isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ ions participated on the redox cycle [23]. The new bands below 22,500 cm−1 observed in the reduced samples are assigned to electronic d–d transitions of V4+ or V3+ ions [23]. It is impossible to distinguish between bands coming from the V4+ and V3+ species because of their superposition and large line width.
4.5. Active and selective sites in propane dehydrogenation
The results of physical–chemical characterization can be summarized as follows: calcination at 873 K at vanadium loadings between 4.5 and 13.2 wt.% leads to the formation of dispersed isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+species and a coexisting AlVO4 phase. In all samples, the number of the polymerized V5+ species is considerably higher than the number of isolated vanadium ions. The domain size of the tetrahedrally coordinated polymerized V5+ species is approximately the same independent on vanadium loadings. The portion of vanadium ions in the AlVO4 phase increased with increasing vanadium loadings from about 10% for V(4.5/873) to about 60% at V(13/873). Octahedrally coordinated V5+ species are also present but in clearly lower concentration than tetrahedrally coordinated species and their amount decreased with increasing vanadium loadings. On calcination at 773 K, octahedrally coordinated V5+ ions are present beside the dispersed tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Calcination at 997 K leads mainly to formation of bulk-like or crystalline V2O5 and some dispersed VOx species. All studied samples also contained, independent of vanadium loadings and calcination temperature, a minor amount of mainly tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated V4+ species, isolated and mainly polymerized.
Initial propane reaction rate (Table 5) has the highest values for the samples V(8.9/773), V(4.5/873) and V(8.9/873). In these samples, dispersed isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species dominate. The propane reaction rate decreases with increasing amount of the AlVO4 phase (V(13/873) and bulk-like vanadium species (V8.9/973) in comparison with dispersed isolated and polymeric tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Therefore, it is assumed that isolated and polymerized tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ are active for propane dehydrogenation [5], [8]. Furthermore, it is suggested that the vanadium present in the AlVO4 phase and in bulk-like V2O5 species has only a small catalytic activity, probably because most of the vanadium ions are not accessible for the feed.
Apparent activation energies of propene formation (73–78 kJ/mol, Table 5) are approximately independent of vanadium loadings for the samples calcined up to 873 K. The same behaviour but higher values of the apparent activation energy was previously found for the VOx/Al2O3 system (around 120 kJ/mol) [8] and similar to the values reported here were found for the VOx/ZrO2 system (62–73 kJ/mol) [32]. The similar values of apparent activation energy with increasing vanadium loadings was explained assuming that CH bond activation is the rate-determining step in propene formation [41]. The higher value of activation energy for the sample V(8.9/973) and the difference to the previously reported values indicate that also other factors like local structure of V5+ species or the strength of interaction between vanadia and the support can also influence the apparent activation energy of propene formation.
For the studied samples, it was concluded that tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species are most active in propane dehydrogenation. The domain size of these V5+ species was approximately the same in the different samples. Obviously, selectivity is mainly influenced by the dispersion of the catalytic active centres on the surface of alumina. BET surface area for the sample V(4.5/973) amounted to 136 m2/g. An increase in vanadium loadings for approximately the same BET surface area leads to a slightly higher activity (propane conversion at the same inlet conditions) but a lower propene selectivity (V(8.9/773). The sample V(8.9/873) has a lower BET surface area (86 m2/g) than the other two samples but here a part of the vanadium was used for formation of the AlVO4 phase. The vanadium species which are not involved in the formation of the AlVO4 phase are dispersed on a lower surface area. Therefore, activity and propene selectivity is slightly lower than for the sample V(8.9/773). With increasing amount of the AlVO4 phase and decreasing BET surface area (47 m2/g ), activity and selectivity decrease (V(13/873)). From these results it can be concluded that propene selectivity is determined by the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated, isolated and polymerized V5+ species. A high density of these species leads to an increase in the consecutive reaction of propene and to the formation of CO.
5. Conclusions
Nature of vanadium species on alumina depends not only on vanadium loadings but also on calcination temperature. After calcination of V(4.5 wt.%)/Al2O3 at 873 K dispersed isolated and polymerized V5+ species in tetrahedral coordination dominate, with the later being the main species. With increasing vanadium loadings up to 13.2 wt.% the portion of dispersed VOx species decreased and the portion of vanadium present in a crystalline AlVO4 phase increased. However, the domain size of the tetrahedrally coordinated polymerized V5+ species is approximately independent on vanadium loadings.
Results of characterization for the sample with 8.9 wt.% vanadium calcined at 773 and 873 K show that the AlVO4 phase was formed at the expense of octahedrally coordinated V5+ species. Therefore, it is suggested that disturbed VOx polyhedra, mainly in octahedral coordination, have to be considered as a precursor for the AlVO4 phase. Its formation should depend on the dispersion of the adsorbed vanadium species on alumina after drying. After calcinations at 973 K the AlVO4 phase decomposed in vanadia and alumina.
The catalytic activity for the oxidative dehydrogenation of propane is determined by the amount of dispersed isolated and polymerised tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species. It is concluded that the AlVO4 phase has only a low catalytic activity since an increase of their amount leads to a decrease of catalytic activity.
Propene selectivity depends on the dispersion of the tetrahedrally coordinated V5+ species; the higher the dispersion, the higher the propene selectivity. CO is the main product of propene oxidation and its formation increases with decreasing dispersion of active sites. In contrast, CO2 formation is approximately independent from the dispersion of the VOx species.
