1. Introduction
The storage of energy is essential for sustainable energy supply as renewable energy is typically associated with high fluctuation and the usage of energy has a different time-dependent behavior. Besides storing electricity in various ways, heat storage of waste heat or other sources of heat could drastically improve energy efficiencies in energy transformation or processes of high energy demand. In case of generation of electricity from concentrating solar panels night and day need to be bridged and long-term storage for the difference between seasons could be essential for the demand of energy. In the case of seasonal or long-term storage of energy, different storage technologies could be considered [1].
In this framework, the dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane was studied for long-term storage of intermittent heat. The basic concept of the so called Liquid Reaction Cycle has been detailed in our previous studies [2], [3]. An endothermic dehydrogenation of a carbon ring of organic molecules is used to store heat which can be released later by the exothermic hydrogenation. A high partial pressure of hydrogen limits the reaction thermodynamically. Thus, removal of hydrogen from the reaction leads to a significant increase in the possible conversion. As hydrogen separation and purification is a necessary step aligned within the process, palladium membranes are proposed to be used for selective in-situ hydrogen separation.
A dehydrogenation/hydrogenation cycle was proposed already in the 1980s as a hydrogen storage method. The overall gravimetric and volumetric density of chemically bound hydrogen and the easy transportation of the so called organic liquid hydrogen carriers (LOHC) led to the investigation on different liquid molecules as possible liquid storage candidates [4], [5]. In combination with fuel cells as efficient hydrogen to electricity converters, the LOHCs gained interest as solution for mobile application (e.g. cars) as well as stationary power supply [6], [7], [8], [9]. Besides plenty of other molecules, the dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane was also previously studied [10], [11], [12].
In general, membrane reactors were approved to intensify reactions producing large amounts of pure hydrogen and that the thermodynamic equilibrium is simultaneously shifted towards the product side. For example, steam reforming can be drastically improved by separation of hydrogen via integration of palladium membranes inside the reactor [13], [14]. Membranes can be used for process intensification or for carbon capturing concepts where for example CO2 needs to be enriched by pre- or post-combustion concepts. Some studies also developed membrane reactors for shifting the equilibrium in dehydrogenations of methylcyclohexane or the like. There, different membrane types were used. Studies with palladium membrane are published by Itoh et al. [15], Ali et al. [16] and Gora et al. [17] demonstrating the thermodynamic equilibrium shift and high selectivity to hydrogen. Itoh et al. developed a reactor system with a tubular membrane and tested it with mixtures of methylcyclohexane and cyclohexane [15]. Also Ali used a tubular reactor system, where reaction and separation occurred at the same time and with this arrangement, the temperature and pressure could be varied so that the thermodynamic equilibrium could be exceeded [16].
Organic compounds may influence the membrane performance. Regarding the permeability of palladium membranes in hydrogen mixtures, some reports are addressing the issue of carbon monoxide or sulphur presence [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]. Petersen et al. describe that the permeability decreases with larger amounts of carbon monoxide in the gas whereas methane and carbon dioxide do obviously not change the permeability [20]. This was also found by Itoh et al. [15]. Both could see an influence of organic compounds on the membrane but also showed that a full recovery of the initial permeability is possible. In the application of methylcyclohexane Ali et al. focused on the permeability of the membrane during reaction for a temperature range between 320 and 400 °C and observed a decrease in permeability of the membrane [24]. They claim that saturated hydrocarbons do not have an influence on the permeability but unsaturated hydrocarbons can reduce the permeability. With the dehydrogenation reaction also unsaturated hydrocarbons are produced. They also report a strong decrease with initial contact of carbon species and membrane, while after an oxidation step the membrane stays stable over a long period. On the opposite Itoh et al. did not observe a decrease in the permeability [25]. However, there is probability that they applied an initial oxidation step before reactor operation.
In contrast to most of the studies, we focused in our manuscript on the optimization of a planar palladium membrane in combination with a microstructured reactor for the dehydrogenation reaction of methylcyclohexane. Reactor efficiency, meaning how much hydrogen per volume is produced and separated is an important parameter for application. Integration of planar palladium membranes in arrangements of microchannels are reported earlier [26], [27]. The use of microstructured reactors, in general, allows benefits from a high surface to volume area, which results in high heat and mass transfer. This is beneficial in terms of the highly endothermic reaction and is also a good way to improve the compactness of such a system. A more application-driven development of a microstructured reactor in combination with optimization of steam reforming of methane on coated microchannels was also published earlier in our group [28]. Applying a high heat transfer capability for dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane in a microstructured packed bed, however, is demanding for optimization with regard to the catalyst mass to membrane area [3] while taking into account possible mass transfer limitations if the packed bed height in the microchannel is increased. The influence of the membrane reactor design towards high film effectiveness factors should thus be obtained. Stability of the membrane over longer times needs to be considered in this circumstance. Furthermore, the influence of organic components in the gas on stability and permeability of the membrane will be addressed in the manuscript.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Microstructured membrane reactor and simulation
In this study a planar membrane module was used. The overall concept and the important dimensions are shown in Fig. 1 for two different designs of the membrane area in this study. Module size A is the original size used also earlier [3]. Module size B has a four-fold higher membrane area, but applies only 500 μm catalyst bed height. This is only ¼th of the original bed height (2000 μm). Details about the integration into a holder system as well as the external heating with heat cartridges can be found elsewhere [3]. On the retentate side a pillar structure with 800 μm pillar diameter and 1000 μm distance was used to stabilize the packed bed. On the permeate side an array of microchannels of 200 μm width and depth with 200 μm distance between the channels was used to remove the hydrogen (see Table 1). The thickness of the pure palladium membrane was 12 μm.

Regarding an optimization of the membrane area to catalyst mass ratio the simulation of the planar membrane reactor was applied to find optimal parameters and design. The minimization of any mass transfer limitation towards the membrane is required and is anticipated for the module size B. Thus, different bed heights of 2000 μm, 1000 μm and 500 μm, were investigated. Module size A was fabricated with 2000 μm and 1000 μm, respectively, while module size B was tested only with 500 μm bed size.
There are some studies available to model membrane reactors with mathematical approaches [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]. The simulation of such membrane reactors needs a model able to describe the flow and the reaction and also the transport through the membrane. Detailed studies regarding the flow and also the reaction are published by Kuerten et al. [29]. They used a 2-dimensional mesh in tubular systems to study the flow as well as the influence of a concentration gradient towards the membrane surface in the catalyst bed, i.e. the so-called concentration polarization effects.
There are various models available describing the membrane transport with different detailing regarding the individual steps of species transport [35], [36], [37]. Ideally the resistance of a support and all steps in the hydrogen transport mechanism could be part of the model. As only scaling of planar reactors was intended and the thickness of the membranes was above 10 μm, the influence of e.g. desorption of hydrogen from the surface of the membrane on the permeate side was neglected (see also studies [20]). The reactor was treated as an ideal plug flow reactor based on previous experience and the membrane was simply described using Sievert’s law with permeance π given in mol s−1 m−2 Pa−0.5.
(1)
The definition of the film effectiveness factor from [38], [39] was used as a value to determine the importance of transport phenomena in the membrane reactor. The concept of the film effectiveness factor is defined by the following equations. The ideal flux is compared with the observed flux through the membrane for a gas mixture containing hydrogen.
is the ratio between mass transfer coefficient towards the membrane surface and membrane permeance.

These values are local values as they change over the membrane surface, i.e. along the reactor length as the hydrogen partial pressure changes with the corresponding reactor variable. Therefore, a local value should always be compared at the same position inside the reactor. Alternatively a mean value of the effectiveness factor could be applied. kg, the gas mass transport coefficient needs to be calculated in these equations. This is done using the equation from Boeltken et al. which considers diffusion for calculation of the mass transport coefficient in a microchannel under laminar flow [38].

(6)
It should be noted that this approach is now transferred to a packed microstructure with the packed bed height hbed. No dependency on the flow rate is considered as diffusion is the only proposed process for transversal mixing over the bed height under laminar conditions. In a packed bed the diffusion may be somewhat hindered or improved by the solid catalyst content.
2.2. Catalyst and setup
The preparation of the used catalyst is detailed elsewhere [1]. An alumina support was prepared by the sol-gel method. The resulting particles were impregnated with palladium nitrate and calcined with air at 550 °C ex-situ. The reduction of the catalyst was done in-situ in the reactor with a nitrogen-hydrogen flow, see also [2], [3].
The reaction test rig was also used for characterization of the membrane modules. Gases (nitrogen, hydrogen, pressurized air, methane) were dosed by MFCs from Brooks (5850 series) and high purity methylcyclohexane was dosed in liquid state by a liquid flow controller from Brooks (Flowmega). To obtain pulsation-free methylcyclohexane steam, the liquid was evaporated in a micro nozzle system where the spray was generated with a small amount of nitrogen (see also [40]). The methylcyclohexane was purchased by Merck ( > 99% purity) and applied without any further purification. The pressure on the retentate side was established with a backpressure regulation with two automatically operated Flowserve valves (series 8000-ip) for different flow rates. The reactor could be by-passed. A second nitrogen flow was added in front of the backpressure valve to increase the total volume flow in case when it was needed.
The products were analyzed by an Agilent GC (7840 series) with a two-column capillary setup, DB-624, l = 30 m, d = 0.45 mm, s = 2.55 μm) and Molsieve Plot5A (l = 15 m, d = 0.53 mm, s = 50 μm) both purchased from Agilent. Calibration and concentration measurement was done using methane as an internal standard for the FID and TCD detector. The absence in the product of dehydrogenation was checked before.
For the characterization experiments of the membrane either hydrogen or mixtures of hydrogen and nitrogen and helium were dosed on the feed/retentate side of the membrane. The permeate side could be flushed with nitrogen as membrane protection against air contact or with sweep gas. Sweep gas has, however, not been applied in the whole set of experiments due to the desired application of pure hydrogen production. The outlet was connected to a second Agilent 6890 series GC equipped with a HP-1 (l = 30 m, d = 0.32 mm, 0.25 mm) and a molsieve Plot5A (l = 15 m, d = 0.53 mm, s = 50 μm) capillaries. Nitrogen was used here as an internal standard. Alternatively the flow could be directed through a gas flow meter to determine the permeated gas flow.
For reaction experiments the reactor was first by-passed at the desired pressure of the experiment to establish constant feed of methylcyclohexane and nitrogen mixture before swithing towards the module. All experiments were conducted with a 70:30 vol.% mixture of methylcyclohexane to nitrogen. During the bypassing, the reactor was flushed with hydrogen on the feed/retentate side to keep the membrane under hydrogen atmosphere. To start the reaction, the reactor was slowly pressurized by closing the outlet of the reactor before switching the feed from the bypass to the reactor. During reaction, the permeation was regularly controlled by the bubble flow meter and in certain experiments an analysis was started on the Agilent 6890 series GC.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Permeation results in the different modules
Experiments in the modules were conducted at various temperatures and pressures. A different view on experiments with module size A are given in the previous publication [3] where high conversions of methylcyclohexane up to 90% are documented.
However, the hydrogen recovery was quite low with the smaller membrane area to catalyst mass (less than 50% hydrogen recovery). Fig. 2 summarizes the previous results [3] and shows that increase of the membrane area to catalyst mass ratio obtained by dilution of the catalyst (while keeping the bed height constant in module size A) slightly improves the hydrogen separation and conversion. Two data points are added in Fig. 2 in for the results obtained from module size B, which shown in advance the much higher hydrogen recovery obtained from the modification of the module size.

Data taken from [3].
In the present study an analysis of results is further performed in comparison to thermodynamic results from Schildhauer et al. [41] in Fig. 3. The conversion of methylcyclohexane sometimes exceeds the thermodynamic calculation for certain conditions, i.e. when a higher residence time was applied.

Besides the reported limitations with regard to the possible lowering of the flow rate in the setup and the dilution factor [3], the value of the accessible membrane area to catalyst mass seems far away from optimum. However, also other reasons could influence the overall module efficiency: These are the possible limitation of the transport towards the membrane, i.e. the concentration polarization effect, or an adsorption effect of organic species.
Experimental investigation of the issue of concentration polarization was done in the present study by applying two different pillar heights/catalyst bed heights of the membrane module size A, i.e. 2000 μm and 1000 μm, and the new module size B with 500 μm bed height. Influencing the diffusion coefficient and thus the mass transport of hydrogen through diffusion in the bed structure towards the membrane (see for reactions in microchannel reactors [42], [43]) was additionally performed in module size A with 1000 μm bed height. The experiments for the variation of the diffusive transport were conducted using mixtures of hydrogen and nitrogen as well as mixtures of hydrogen with helium. The results of varying the bed height and the diffusion coefficient for the non-reactive gas mixtures of hydrogen are shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5. Fig. 4 shows the calculated film effectiveness factor from the provided equations for different bed heights as function of the different overall feed flowrates. For Fig. 4 values of kg (see Eq. (6)) were calculated as 0.0125, 0.025 and 0.05 ms−1 for bed height of 2000, 1000 and 500 μm, respectively. The applied diffusion coefficient of hydrogen in nitrogen was DH2N2 = 2.5·10−5 m2 s−1. The values were calculated with the mean hydrogen partial pressure between inlet and outlet of the reactor.

Module size A with 2000 μm and 1000 μm bed height, module size B with 500 μm bed height.
The film effectiveness factor of 1000 μm and 2000 μm bed height in Fig. 4 might indicate that despite these small dimensions the bed height should have a significant influence on the hydrogen recovery factor and the hydrogen flux. Further, the same behavior should be found when comparing the hydrogen flux through the membrane in helium and nitrogen mixtures. Even though the diffusivity was changed by the diffusion coefficient in the mixture, no difference can be found in the hydrogen flux data with 1000 μm bed height in Fig. 5. Under these circumstances it is the most reasonable explanation that the concentration polarization is not only affected by diffusional transport. Since the gas velocity doubles from 2000 μm to 1000 μm bed height, the film effectiveness factor and the flux of hydrogen through the membrane could further be improved by convective effects.
An extraordinary exception in Fig. 5 seems to occur with the larger module size B having a bed height of 500 μm. Here the hydrogen flux is much smaller than expected. This is of course influenced by larger permeation of hydrogen as the membrane size increases, i.e. the driving force reduces over the membrane. However, even if the flow rate would be increased by a factor of four, which corresponds to the enlargement of the membrane, the trend of the hydrogen flux suggests that it will not exceed the flux of the 1000 μm module. Therefore, another explanation is obvious. Currently, the most reasonable explanation is a maldistribution of flow in the design of the distributor or an inhomogeneous filling in 500 μm slit size. Regardless of this observation, the larger module with less bed height does its job, i.e. the overall hydrogen recovery factor increases as demonstrated in Fig. 6.

The mass transfer coefficient kg in Fig. 4 was calculated by the diffusion coefficient divided by the bed height as a characteristic length. This explains the strong increase of the film effectiveness factor by lowering the bed height. However, the hydrogen fluxes are less pronounced in dependence of the bed height, especially for the comparison of 1000 μm and 2000 μm. Commonly, the calculation of kg shows good correlation for empty microchannels of typical laminar flow ([38], [39]). In case of the packed bed it may be doubtful to apply this assumption.

Better values could be achieved by calculating kg differently. By using the equations 7 and 8 to calculate an actual p* using the determined permeability of the membrane and the balance of the reactor to calculate an average pH2,rmean the actual driving force is represented and a mass transfer coefficient can be calculated. The values of π for equation 1 and for equation 7 were calculated from pure hydrogen permeation experiments done with the fresh membrane. The values of π are 2.08·10−3 and 2.14·10−3 mol s−1 m−2 Pa−0.5 at 350 °C for the 1000 and 2000 μm bed height in module size A, respectively. The determined values of kg are shown in Fig. 7.

This calculated kg from the actual driving force is in the same range as calculated by equation 6. The main difference is that it varies with total flow. These results show the opposite trend than reported by Boeltken et al. [38]. Their values of η decrease for higher flow rates. Again, the main difference is the packed bed in the present study versus the open microchannel in the study by Boeltken et al. [38].
The results of applying the new approach for determination of kg in the calculation of the effectiveness factors are shown in Fig. 8. It clearly shows that the differences between the effectiveness factors for different bed heights of 1000 μm and 2000 μm are much smaller and behave more similar to the measured fluxes. So, a new fit for a correlation with a packed bed and membrane for the mass transfer coefficient seems necessary. Itoh et al. treated a similar problem with a 2-dimensional model where the Peclet number influences the mass transfer [19]. Catalano and Sheintuch developed different approaches for calculation of a Sherwood number to assess the mass transfer coefficient [32], [37].

Fig. 8. Effectiveness factor using kg determined from the actual driving force for different bed height in module size A.
Regardless of the difference between the different assumptions, a smaller bed height improves the level of separation efficiency. Low hydrogen recovery in module size A is, however, not only be caused by mass transfer. All calculations show effectiveness factors larger than 0.6 or 0.7.
The permeance is calculated from experimental results of the reactive gas mixture/reaction experiments and compared in Fig. 9 as ratio versus ideal permeance of hydrogen at identical absolute pressure and temperature conditions. To calculate the permeance in the reactive mixture a hydrogen partial pressure needs to be applied. This was done by calculating the mean value between the outlet partial pressure derived from the GC measurement and the maximum hydrogen partial pressure, which is calculated from the conversion of methylcyclohexane. The low value of this ratio around 0.3 to 0.4 clearly indicates a further limitation apart from the diffusion and convective effects described above. Even if the applied calculation of the mean partial pressure overpredicts the actual driving force (partial pressure profile with Sievert’s law dependence) the much lower permeability under reaction conditions could not be explained by mass transport only. A reasonable explanation for this behavior is the discussed adsorption of organic molecules, which are present in the gas phase. During the reaction, unsaturated hydrocarbons are produced, such as toluene, which could adsorb as an intermediate on the membrane surface. This could of course lead to a decline in permeability of the membrane over time. Looking at our previous results [3], a serious decline of permeability was not observed. The necessary membrane area thus must be determined during reaction which requires further a more detailed modelling.

3.2. Comparison with simulation
A one dimensional isothermal plug flow reactor model was established with MATLAB to describe the module behavior. For the reaction kinetics a model from the study by Usman et al. [44] was used. Activation energy and pre-exponential factor were adjusted to the activity of the applied catalyst, for details see Appendix and [2].
The results can be divided into two sections. The first section is without reaction for validation of the model regarding separation. The second section deals with reaction and separation for a further scaling of the reactor.
The results of hydrogen recovery are shown for a 12 μm thick membrane in module size A over the total flow rate in Fig. 10. With the 1-D model no effects of any mass transfer limitation, i.e. concentration polarization is considered and the separation is thus slightly overpredicted. Applying the previously calculated effectiveness factors (see Fig. 8), the actual permeability of the membrane can be fitted very well, thus the new method to determine kG seems valid.

When including the reaction, a general trend for overestimation of the hydrogen recovery occurred for all measured data. This was already found in the calculation of the permeability of the membrane during reaction in Fig. 9. One may argue that hydrogen diffusivity in mixture with organic molecules is even lower than with nitrogen but no improvement of permeation was found compared to hydrogen/helium mixtures before (see Fig. 5). Thus this effect could not be ignored for correct prediction of the module performance.
To cope with the problem of a lower actual permeability of the membrane a correction factor was fitted as single multiplication factor. Its value was determined as 0.7. No other trend could be found or a correlation seemed to be valid to describe the results in a better way. In Fig. 11 the corresponding parity plot of the simulation including the correction factor is shown. The assumption that the decrease in permeability is caused by the presence of organic compounds could be feasible. Nevertheless, the total scattering of the permeation data is still high compared to the reaction data.

In Fig. 12 a scaling of the module size was investigated with included correction factor as function of the bed height for constant volume of catalyst. Towards the left side of the graph, i.e. less bed height (starting from 2000 μm) the hydrogen recovery increases strongly for higher membrane area. The conversion profits from very high hydrogen recovery rates below bed height of 500 μm. Concluding, for a constant reactor volume the highest membrane area to catalyst mass ratio is preferred. This is also true even when the actual permeability drops during reaction. A practical limitation is the depth of the bed structure because it needs to be filled with catalyst powder. Due to the observed effect of lower hydrogen flux than expected in module size B, the limit is probably near the bed height of 500 μm.

3.3. Reaction results in module size B (optimized system)
As described in the experimental section limitations of feed dosing and catalyst dilution occurred in the previous study [3] which also led to low hydrogen recovery factors. Thus, the module size B was of high interest for practical application to increase the overall hydrogen recovery factor during the dehydrogenation reaction while keeping the conversion at similar level. Further, 30 bar pressure were set as new maximum pressure in the setup and the housing of the module.
The hydrogen recovery obtained with module size B are plotted in comparison with the module size A in Fig. 2 as a function of the membrane area to catalyst mass. With the conditions shown at Fig. 2 the catalyst produces, at a conversion of around 90%, around four times more hydrogen than removed with the membrane. Thus, the total hydrogen recovery is too low. Increasing the membrane area should therefore improve the overall separation and thus catalyst AND membrane utilization. We estimated the separation for lower residence time in Fig. 12. However, technically we were only able to increase the membrane area by a factor of four (see Table 1). This increased the membrane area to catalyst mass ratio from 3.3·10−4 to 1.4·10−3m2 g−1 which is also about four times higher. Two data points on the right side represent the module B at fixed pressure of 9 bar. In Fig. 13 the results from module size B over absolute pressures are shown.

The redesigned module size B achieves much higher hydrogen recovery and the stability of the catalyst (not shown) was as good as reported previously. Much higher pressures did not result in a lower conversion as the separation of hydrogen is quite high. The maximum hydrogen recovery factor is a bit lower than simulated for 1 bar of hydrogen partial pressure on the permeate side, which can be result of the observed deviation of hydrogen flux in Fig. 5. Nevertheless, a very high utilization of the module components, i.e. membrane and catalyst, is reached. With higher pressures, also the application of a higher permeate pressure is feasible. For the concept of hydrogen storage a higher hydrogen partial pressure on the permeate side could be beneficial. Fig. 14 shows the experimental results with 1 and 3 bar permeate side hydrogen pressure as function of time on stream. This graph shows that a high hydrogen recovery is still feasible with 3 bar on permeate side.

4. Outlook and conclusion
Within this study, results from planar membrane reactor modules for dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane are presented. Geometry optimization was done for obtaining high conversion and a hydrogen recovery factor. To evaluate different module geometries, analysis was done by consideration of the film effectiveness factor, reaction experiments and module simulation with a 1-D model in MATLAB.
Tests with hydrogen and nitrogen showed small influence of a concentration polarization due to the overall tiny channel geometries. Influence of the bed height could thus be observed and a backward calculation of the gas mass transport coefficient seems more reasonable for calculation of the film effectiveness factor. Assuming pure diffusion like in an empty microchannel does not well fit. With the corrected mass transfer coefficient, however, the 1-D model still overpredicts the hydrogen transport through the membrane under reactive conditions but fits the permeation experiments with hydrogen/nitrogen mixture. Thus, the adsorption of hydrocarbons on the membrane surface is supposed to hinder the hydrogen permeation. Including a single correction factor in our 1-D simulation for the reaction experiments led to a relative good agreement with our set of experimental data.
The enlarged membrane area in module size B led to high hydrogen recovery and methylcyclohexane conversion. For pressures up to 30 bar almost constant conversion was possible while the hydrogen recovery increased significantly. Thus, only diffusion in palladium remains the rate determining step. It was even possible to increase the hydrogen permeate pressure to 3 bar which is positive for the hydrogen usage. However, even though the module size B with 500 μm bed height was a good compromise for catalyst and membrane utilization, the module behaved not as expected in the analysis of the film effectiveness. It could be possible that the issue of inhomogeneous catalyst filling and a possible maldistribution in the module holder has lowered the overall performance of the module. This has to be analyzed further.
To further improve the simulation also a closer look to the influence of the gas composition is necessary. For that, the presence of organic hydrocarbons on the permeability should be studied.

Examine the content within the supplied document to determine if it pertains to any form of propane dehydrogenation, including both Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH) and Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH). If the document discusses either of these processes in the context of converting propane to propylene, please continue to assess the main scientific contributions as outlined in the subsequent steps.
1. Identify the catalyst that represents the main scientific contribution in the document.
2. Extract and detail the following information for this catalyst:
    - Name
    - Type: Metal, Metal Oxide, Single Atom, Alloy, Others
    - Composition Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - If the Type is "Alloy":
        - Structure Type: Nanoparticulate Alloys, Intermetallic Compounds, Single-atom Alloys, Others
        - Preparation Method: Impregnation Methods, Heat Treatment, Surface & Support Methods, Solution-Based Methods, In Situ Synthesis, Chemical Methods, Physical Methods, etc.
    - Active Species Element(s) (chemical symbols)
    - Promoter Element(s) (chemical symbols, if any)
    - Support Material: Silica Oxide, Aluminum Oxide, Oxides, Carbides, Zeolites, Others
    - Conversion (%): Specify type (e.g., single-pass conversion, propane conversion, overall conversion)
    - Selectivity (%)
    - Stability (if in h-1 or convert to h-1)
    - Deactivation Rate(s) (value and units)
    - Propane Production Rate (value and units)
    - Propylene Yield (%)
    - Feed Composition and Ratio(s)
    - Propane Partial Pressure
    - Reaction Temperature (value and units)
    - Inlet Flow Rate (value and units)
    - Catalyst Loading or Gas Hourly Space Velocity (GHSV) (value and units)
3. Determine how the manuscript increases selectivity, conversion, and stability, focusing on improvements in catalyst preparation method, structural composition, process conditions, or reactor design.
4. Describe the specific performance enhancements (selectivity, conversion, stability) and summarize the advancement in one sentence.
5. Convert the stability to an hourly rate (h-1) if not already in that unit.
6. Identify whether the catalyst is utilized for Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH), a process that does not involve oxidation, or for Oxidative Propane Dehydrogenation (ODH), where an oxidative process is integral. Clarify the distinction between PDH, where propane is dehydrogenated to propylene without the presence of oxygen or other oxidizing agent, and ODH, which involves the oxidation of propane as a part of the dehydrogenation process to propylene.
7. Identify the feed gas composition utilized with the catalyst.
8. Determine if the feed gas contains an oxidizing agent.
