 Unfortunately, the provided documents do not contain enough information for me to synthesize a comprehensive summary in the requested XML format about propane dehydrogenation research. The documents appear to be unrelated extractions about the dehydrogenation of methylcyclohexane, which is not directly relevant to propane dehydrogenation. Without multiple coherent extractions from the same source document focused on propane dehydrogenation research, I do not have sufficient content to aggregate into a unified XML entry summarizing the key scientific findings and data. Please provide a set of extracts from a single document focused on propane dehydrogenation if you would like me to attempt synthesizing an XML summary.
