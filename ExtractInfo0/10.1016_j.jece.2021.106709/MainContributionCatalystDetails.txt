Based on the multiple extracts provided, the document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation research. The extracts indicate the document focuses on CO2 capture using amine-functionalized adsorbents, with no mention of catalysts or processes related to converting propane to propylene. Since there is no pertinent information related to propane dehydrogenation, I have marked the document as not relevant and have not included any scientific contribution details in the output.
