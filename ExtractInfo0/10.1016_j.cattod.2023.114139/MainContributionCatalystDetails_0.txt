 Based on my analysis, the document does not seem to be relevant to propane dehydrogenation. The document discusses oxidation of soot particles over metal-doped vanadium catalysts in a dielectric barrier discharge plasma reactor. It does not mention anything related to conversion of propane to propylene.
