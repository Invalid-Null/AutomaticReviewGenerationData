Effect of yttrium on catalytic performance of Y-doped TiO2 catalysts for propane dehydrogenation
Abstract
Defective bulk catalysts based on TiO2 have superior catalytic performance for propane dehydrogenation (PDH). The oxygen vacancy concentration and the number of active sites on the catalyst surface can be effectively tuned by doping metal in TiO2. Herein, yttrium (Y)-doped titanium dioxide (nY/TiOx) catalysts were in-situ synthesized via the coprecipitation method to study the effect of rare earth metal Y doping on the structure of TiO2 and the catalytic performance for PDH. Experimental results demonstrate that Y-doped TiO2 exhibits higher catalytic activity, propylene selectivity and stability than bare TiO2. Full characterizations with X-ray diffraction (XRD), high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), infrared spectroscopy of pyridine adsorption (Py-IR), temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD), H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), and Raman techniques on these catalysts reveal that Y3+ can enter TiO2 lattice, and the lattice stability of the catalyst can be enhanced by replacing Ti4+ to form Y–O–Ti structure. Meanwhile, the introduction of an appropriate amount of Y can obviously promote the PDH reaction by adjusting the acidity of the catalyst, improving the release capacity of TiO2 lattice oxygen and increasing the formation of active centers. Nevertheless, excessive Y doping will lead to pore clogging, and the exposure of active sites will be reduced, resulting in the degradation of catalytic performance.
1. Introduction
As an important high value-added chemical raw material, propylene plays an indispensable role in the petrochemical industry.1 Traditionally, propylene is produced by catalytic cracking of petroleum fractions and by-products (e.g., naphtha) or steam cracking of light diesel oil.2,3 However, the gap between supply and demand of propylene has gradually increased with the rapid consumption of fossil energy in recent years, and propylene prepared by conventional processes cannot satisfy the demand.4 Accordingly, the development of economical and highly efficient propylene production technologies is of crucial importance. Since the widespread exploitation of shale gas around the world has brought more plentiful and cheaper propane, which makes propane dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene become a more attractive alternative.5, 6, 7 Notably, compared with conventional processes, PDH technology has manifested advantages of low investment cost and high propylene yield.8,9 Currently, Pt- and CrOx-based catalysts are widely used for the catalytic dehydrogenation of propane.10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Especially catalysts such as Pt-Sn12,13 and Cr–Al2O314,15 have been commercialized. Although such catalysts have shown high activity and selectivity, they suffer some drawbacks. Expensive platinum-based catalysts are easily deactivated due to carbon deposition, and toxic chromium-based catalysts cause serious environmental pollution. Therefore, it is particularly essential to develop and prepare green and inexpensive catalysts with high catalytic performance.
A number of non-reducible bulk metal oxide catalysts with surface defects, namely defective metal oxide catalysts,16 have captured our attention. Representatives of such materials are ZrO2,17 TiO2,18 Al2O3,19 etc. Not only they have a price advantage, but they also show outstanding catalytic performance. Different from conventional catalysts with supported metal(s), there is no clear distinction between support and active species in defective metal oxide catalysts, barely the oxide itself with surface defects. Some studies have illustrated that the lattice defect of the oxide itself is the catalytic adsorption center, and the coordinatively unsaturated metal cations near the oxygen vacancies (OVs) are the active sites for PDH.17,20,21 The defective metal oxide catalyst was first proposed as a substitute for the conventional supported catalyst at the end of 2015.17 Experiments were carried out to test the reactivity of ZrO2 for PDH reaction in reducing atmosphere, which proved that ZrO2 was a typical representative of bulk metal oxides with lattice defects. Otroshchenko and coworkers initially proposed that coordinatively unsaturated zirconium cations (Zrcus) and adjacent lattice oxygens are catalytic active sites for propylene formation.22 Yet, further investigation combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculation and experimental characterization revealed that two adjacent Zrcus sites are sites that form active centers.23 Recent studies have found that low-cost and environmentally friendly TiO2 materials are also one of the defective oxide catalysts, which can exhibit superior PDH catalytic activity.18,24,25 In 2020, Li et al.18 first reported commercial TiO2 to PDH. The research depicted that TiO2 can generate OVS through the hydrogen reduction, and activity varies with the change of OVS concentration. Coordinatively unsaturated Ti cations (Ticus) near OVs are PDH active sites. In the same year, Xie et al.24,25 explored the dynamic formation and reaction mechanism of catalytic active centers of commercial nano-TiO2 particles based on the results of ex/in situ characterizations and DFT calculations. The results showed that the Ostwald ripening of nano-TiO2 with high surface energy is the key to OVs formation.
It is well known that lattice defects in metal oxides can also be produced by doping other metal ions.26, 27, 28, 29, 30 In comparison to Ti, Y easily binds more oxygen, since the binding energy of rare earth metal Y to oxygen (715 kJ/mol) is stronger than that of Ti to oxygen (662 kJ/mol).31,32 Consequently, the dopant of Y into TiO2 will despoil the oxygen originally bound to Ti atoms, leading to the loss of lattice oxygen of titanium and the generation of defect sites with catalytic activity. We propose a new strategy, herein, to synthesize Y-doped TiO2 catalysts (nY/TiOx) in situ via the coprecipitation method and to use it in PDH reaction. It was found that suitable amount of Y doped TiO2 showed higher intrinsic activity than bare TiO2, and when the doping amount of Y reaches a certain value, the propane conversion rate will not increase. Full characterizations with experimental techniques on these catalysts revealed that the introduction of Y has three main functions. One is that the structure of TiO2 will be changed, resulting in the lack of lattice oxygen. The second is that the acidity of the catalyst can be significantly tuned, and the number and structure of active sites can be regulated, so as to control the catalytic performance of PDH. The third one is that PDH reaction energy barrier is lowered, and the apparent turnover frequency of C3H8 is increased.
2. Experimental
2.1. Catalyst preparation
2.1.1. Synthesis of nY/TiOx catalysts via co-precipitation method
A certain amount of Ti(SO4)2 was accurately weighed and dissolved in the mixed solution of 200 mL deionized water and 7 mL acetic acid (denoted as solution A). Meanwhile, a certain concentration of H12N3O15Y aqueous solution (denoted as solution B) was prepared. With vigorous stirring, 5 mL of solution B was added dropwise to solution A, mixed evenly, transferred to a round-bottom flask, and forced to hydrolyze under boiling reflux for several hours with magnetic stirring. The reaction was cooled to room temperature, and the pH was adjusted to 8–10 with NH3·H2O. Then it was aged for 12 h, filtered, and the precipitate was collected and dried in an oven at 105 °C for 6 h. The sample was ground and calcined in air at 600 °C for 4 h. The synthesized samples were recorded as nY/TiOx, where n represents the mass percentage ([Y]/([Y]+[Ti]) × 100%) of the catalysts.
2.1.2. Synthesis of bare TiO2 catalyst via direct precipitation method
A blank nano-TiO2 powder was synthesized in the same step as in Section 2.1.1 except that solution B was not added, and it was recorded as bare TiO2.
2.2. Catalyst characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the studied catalysts were detected by using a Panalytical X'pert diffractometer (Kα1/α2 radiation, 40 kV, 40 mA) equipped with a copper tube, in the range of 2θ from 20° to 90°, with a scanning speed of 2(°)/min. The high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) images were captured on a Tecnai G2 F20 S-Twin instrument, and the accelerating voltage was 200 kV. The morphologies of the samples were examined by a JEM-F200 microscope (JEOL, Japan). The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of the samples were detected at −196 °C with an automatic analyzer (Micromeritics Tristar 3020). The samples were degassed under vacuum at 350 °C for 4 h prior to adsorption. In the pressure range of p/p0 = 0.05–0.30, the specific surface area of the samples was determined by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) multi-point method, and the pore structure data were analyzed by Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) model. Raman spectra in the range of 100–3800 cm−1 were measured by a high-resolution Raman spectrometer system (Renishaw in Via Reflex) using a visible light source with a wavelength of 532 nm as the excitation light source.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was recorded on a Thermo Scientific spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source (hv = 1486.6 eV). The samples were not further pretreated before characterization. The C 1s peak of contaminant carbon (BE = 284.8 eV) was used as an internal standard to calibrate the binding energy. The samples were placed on a self-built equipment for temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD), and thermal conductivity detector (TCD) was used to analyze the desorbed NH3. Generally, 0.1 g catalyst was loaded in the reaction tube, heated to 600 °C in N2 atmosphere at a rate of 10 °C/min, and pretreated for 30 min. Then, naturally cool to 40 °C, turn off N2, and switch NH3 (40 mL/min) for adsorption. After 30 min, turn off NH3, run the baseline at 100 °C, and return to zero when the baseline is stable. Eventually, set the temperature to rise from 100 to 600 °C and the heating rate to 10 °C/min for NH3 desorption. The H2 temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR) was measured on an analyzer equipped with TCD. 0.05 g catalyst was pretreated in high-purity He atmosphere (30 mL/min) for 30 min to remove water and physically adsorbed gas possibly contained on the catalyst. Then, the catalyst was treated with 10 vol% H2/Ar mixed gas (total flow rate 30 mL/min) for 20 min. After the baseline of TCD detector was stable, the heating furnace heated the sample to 900 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min. TCD detects H2 signal online.
Infrared spectroscopy of pyridine adsorption (Py-IR) spectra were recorded by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy equipped with pyridine adsorption instrument and diffuse reflection cell. Prior to adsorption of pyridine, 0.05 g sample was pressed into a circular sheet with a diameter of 13 mm, put into the sample cell, and vacuumized at 400 °C for 1 h. Then cool to room temperature and measure the background curve. The sample was heated to 200 °C (350 °C) to remove the physically/chemically adsorbed pyridine after adsorption of pyridine for 5 min, and then the Py-FTIR spectrum in the range of 1700–1300 cm−1 was recorded at room temperature.
2.3. Catalytic tests
The PDH activity of all catalysts was evaluated by using a continuous flow fixed bed quartz tube microreactor. The experiment was carried out at 600 °C and 0.1 MPa, and it was divided into two stages. In the pretreatment stage, 0.4 g catalyst was heated to 600 °C in nitrogen flow (15 mL/min) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min, and then hydrogen flow (10 vol% H2/N2) was opened for purging to fully reduce the surface of catalyst. Shut off the hydrogen flow after 1 h, and purge with nitrogen flow for 15 min to blow off the excess H2 in the gas system. In the reaction stage, propane gas was turned on and sent into the reactor at a gas flow rate of 1.5 mL/min (10 vol% C3H8/N2). The reaction products of PDH were analyzed by using on-line gas chromatograph (GC, SP-3420) equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID). The propane conversion (

3. Results
3.1. Bulk structure
The element percentage content of the catalyst was obtained by X-ray fluorescence analysis (Table S1). The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms and pore sizes distribution were obtained by physical adsorption test of the catalyst (Fig. S1). Both bare TiO2 and nY/TiOx catalysts have type IV curves with H1-type hysteresis ring, which indicates that the catalysts have uniform mesoporous structure. The specific surface area (SBET), pore diameter and pore volume data of the catalysts are shown in Table 1. Compared with bare TiO2, the SBET of Y-doped samples increased significantly. Furthermore, with the increase of Y doping amount, the average pore size of nY/TiOx catalysts gradually decreases, and the pore size distribution varies from wide to narrow. It is worth noting that the 2 wt% Y/TiOx sample has the largest SBET, indicating that the sample may expose the most active sites. However, excessive Y doping diminishes the SBET of the samples, which may be due to the fact that excessive Y dopant fails to enter the TiO2 lattice and blocks some channels.33 The similar effects of rare earth doping on the structure and properties of catalysts were also reported by Zhang et al.34 and Alvarez-Galvan et al.35

Samples Surface area (SBET) (m2/g) Pore diameter (DBJH) (nm) Pore volume (VBJH) (cm3/g)
Bare TiO2 73.4 9.5 0.25
1 wt% Y/TiOx 91.8 7.5 0.25
2 wt% Y/TiOx 106.5 7.5 0.29
3 wt% Y/TiOx 100.3 6.1 0.22
4 wt% Y/TiOx 102.4 6.0 0.23
The prepared bare TiO2 and nY/TiOx catalysts were characterized by XRD to identify the crystal structures and crystallite size (Fig. 1). With or without Y doping, all samples have a typical anatase structure in agreement with the JCPDS card No. 21–1272. Bare TiO2 shows the strongest peak near 25.4°, corresponding to the characteristic peak of (101) crystal plane of anatase. The peak corresponding to nY/TiOx catalyst shifted slightly and appeared around 25.2°, which may be due to the introduction of Y into the crystal of TiO2. However, the diffraction peaks corresponding to Y species are not detected in all nY/TiOx catalysts, indicating that its content is too low for detection, or they are highly dispersed on the surface of TiO2.36 In order to obtain more detailed crystal structure information, all catalysts were refined from electron powder diffraction data using the Rietveld technique, and the obtained lattice parameters are shown in Table 2. The space group of TiO2 is I41/amd, which belongs to tetragonal system, and a = b. As can be seen from Table 2, the unit lattice parameters of undoped bare TiO2 catalyst are a = b = 0.3771 nm and c = 0.9430 nm. However, the corresponding lattice parameters of Y-doped catalysts all become larger. Taking 2 wt% Y/TiOx as an example, the doping of Y element increases the lattice parameter a from 0.3771 to 0.3783 nm, with an increase of 0.32%, and c increased from 0.9430 to 0.9493 nm, with an increase of 0.67%. That means that Y enters the TiO2 lattice and increases the interplanar crystal spacing, which is the fundamental factor why the position of XRD diffraction peak shifts to a small angle.

In addition, as can be seen from Fig. 1, with the increase of Y content, the intensities of the characteristic peaks of the samples decrease and their widths increase. This indicates that Y doping has an effect on the particle sizes and crystallinity of TiO2 nano-powder. The crystal sizes of all the catalysts were calculated according to Scherrer equation37 and Williamson-Hall formula, respectively, and the average crystallinity of samples was analyzed by Jade 6.0, as shown in Table 3. It can be seen that the grain size and crystallinity of the catalyst decreased obviously with the increase of Y doping amount. And the decrease of catalyst grain size corresponds to the increase of its SBET. Apparently, this is all due to Y species entering the TiO2 lattice. It is worth noting that the grain size calculated by Scherrer equation is larger than Williamson-Hall, which is due to the additional peak broadening factor caused by Y doping.

4 wt% Y/TiOx 16.3 6.0 82.32
3.2. Surface properties
The morphology and surface element distribution of the catalysts were analyzed by SEM and EDS. SEM images of typical catalysts of bare TiO2, 2 wt% Y/TiOx and 4 wt% Y/TiOx are shown in Fig. S2. It can be seen that bare TiO2 catalyst particles rarely aggregate and are basically dispersed. Y doping promoted the agglomeration of particles to some extent, which was attributed to the reduction of the particle size of the catalysts. From Fig. S3, it can be seen that the average particle sizes of bare TiO2, 2 wt% Y/TiOx and 4 wt% Y/TiOx catalysts are 40.6, 33.2 and 28.9 nm, respectively, which further proves that the particle size of catalysts decreases with the increase of Y concentration. It is worth noting that the average size of catalyst particles obtained from SEM photographs is slightly larger than that obtained from Williamson-Hall formula, which may be due to the agglomeration of some catalyst particles. The high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images of bare TiO2 are shown in Fig. 2(a and b), and clear lattice plane can be observed. The exposed lattice fringe spacing is 0.3528 nm, which corresponds to the (101) lattice plane of anatase TiO2.38 Nevertheless, the fringe spacing of the 2 wt% Y/TiOx sample increased slightly (Fig. 2(c and d)), which maybe contribute to the change of lattice distortion stress. The EDS images of 2 wt% Y/TiOx reveal that the doped Y is homogeneously distributed on the catalyst surface (Fig. 3).

Fig. 4 shows the Raman spectra of bare TiO2 and the Y-doped TiO2 catalysts, which further reveals the effect of Y doping on the internal stress of TiO2 grains. There is a strong peak at 142 cm−1, three moderate peaks at 394, 513 and 637 cm−1 and a weak peak at 196 cm−1, in which the peak at 513 cm−1 is the superposition of two basic peaks nearby. These six peaks correspond to the six basic vibration modes of anatase TiO2, respectively,39,40 and no other peaks are found. Compared with the bare TiO2 catalyst, the doping of Y species reduces the Raman peak intensity of all vibration modes. It is attributed to the fact that Y doping hinders the growth of TiO2 grains and inhibits the lattice vibration. As a matter of note, the intensity of Raman characteristic peaks of 2 wt% Y/TiOx catalyst decreased the most, which indicated that the stress inside the grain increased the most and the grain refinement was the most serious. In addition, compared with pure TiO2, the Y-doped TiO2 catalysts have a slight wavenumber blue shift from 142 to 143 cm−1, which is due to lattice expansion caused by Y3+ replacing Ti4+ with slightly smaller ion radius.41

3.3. Catalytic activity
In order to clarify the effect of Y doping on the activity of the catalyst, we measured the conversion of propane and the selectivity of propylene when the catalyst reacted at 600 °C. The catalytic performances of bare TiO2 and nY/TiOx catalysts are shown in Fig. 5. It should be emphasized that the propylene yields of all the as-prepared samples are higher than that of the purchase TiO2 catalyst (the catalytic activity of commercial anatase purchased from Macklin is shown by the gray dotted line in Fig. S4). It can be seen from Fig. 5(a) that the Y-doped catalyst shows better catalytic performance than the blank sample. The initial propane conversion of bare TiO2 catalyst is 29%, while that of Y-doped TiO2 can reach 42%. This indicates that Y doping may be helpful to improve the lattice oxygen releasing ability of TiO2 and generate more active sites. Furthermore, among nY/TiOx catalysts, 2 wt% Y/TiOx sample showed the best catalytic performance, and excessive addition of Y (>2 wt% Y) diminished the activity. This can be interpreted as that excessive Y doping failed to enter TiO2 lattice to participate in crystal formation, resulting in the blockage of pores and the reduction of the exposure of active sites. In addition, the acidity of the catalyst surface is also the decisive factor affecting the catalytic activity. In the Section 4.4, we explored the ratio of acid sites with different strengths in the catalyst, and found that the sum of weak and medium acid accounted for the largest proportion in the 2 wt% Y/TiOx catalyst. These acidic sites are beneficial to the activation and cleavage of C–H bonds in PDH reaction. However, excessive Y-doped catalyst will generate more strong acid sites, which will promote the cracking of C–C bonds, resulting in the cracking of propane to produce by-products such as ethylene or methane, which is not conducive to the PDH reaction.26,42

Reaction parameters: mcat = 40 mg, H2 (1.5 mL/min) pretreatment 1 h, C3H8/N2 (molar ratio) = 1.5:15, total inlet flow = 16.5 mL/min, T = 600 °C; regeneration conditions: the spent catalyst for each cycle was regenerated in air at 600 °C.
Combined with Table 1, it can be found that the activity rule of catalysts is consistent with the change of SBET, indicating that they are directly related. As the SBET is larger, there may be more active sites, and the catalyst has better catalytic performance. All samples were devitalized with the progress of the reaction, which may be related to carbon deposition. Additionally, ten dehydrogenation–regeneration cycles were performed on the 2 wt% Y/TiOx catalyst to verify the regeneration capability as shown in Fig. 5(b). Obviously, the 2 wt% Y/TiOx catalyst showed good regeneration performance, its initial propane conversion was higher than 36% in all cycles, and the propylene selectivity remained above 92%.
4. Discussion
4.1. Effect of Y on catalyst stability
According to the above-mentioned changes of catalyst grain size and crystallinity, as well as the XRD, TEM and Raman characterization results, the effect of the introduction of Y ion on the grain structure of TiO2 catalyst was investigated. Especially in Raman spectra, we can see that the Raman peak intensity of Y-doped TiO2 catalysts decreases obviously, and there is a blue shift of wavenumber from 142 to 143 cm−1, which is probably due to the appearance of a new combination mode, such as Y–O–Ti. The reason is as follows: Y and Ti are in diagonal positions in the periodic table of elements, so they have similar properties. And when Y dopant is introduced into TiO2, since the binding energy of Y and O is greater than that of Ti and O, and the radii of Y3+ and Ti4+ ions are similar, Y species can easily enter the lattice of TiO2 and distribute in lattice gaps or replace some Ti atoms to form Y–O–Ti. As a result, the crystal lattice of the catalyst will expand and the micro-stress will increase, which will lead to the microcrystal deformation, the decrease of intensity and crystallinity of Raman and XRD peaks, and the broadening of diffraction peaks. The similar effect is also reflected in TEM images, and the lattice fringe spacing of Y-doped catalyst is slightly larger than that of bare TiO2.
In order to further study the effect of Y doping on the chemical stability of TiO2 catalyst, we characterized bare TiO2 and 2 wt% Y/TiOx catalysts calcined at diverse temperatures (500–900 °C) by XRD, as shown in Fig. S5 and Fig. 6. By observing the crystal morphology, it is found that with the increase of calcination temperature (500–800 °C, anatase phase), the peak intensity of the characteristic peak of bare TiO2 catalyst first increases and then decreases. At 600 °C, the diffraction peak intensity is the highest and the peak shape is the sharpest. This illustrates that the catalyst has no phase transition at 500–600 °C. From 500 to 600 °C, the peak width of diffraction peak narrowed and the intensity increased, it is mainly because that the particle size of the sintered catalyst increased with the increase of calcination temperature. However, in the process of 600–800 °C, the narrowing of the peak width and the weakening of the peak intensity of bare TiO2 diffraction peak may be due to the generation of new crystal phase. When the calcination temperature was 900 °C, bare TiO2 catalyst was almost completely transformed into rutile phase. In contrast, the 2 wt% Y/TiOx catalyst did not experience crystal phase transformation in the temperature range of 500–800 °C, which can be seen from the strength of the characteristic peak of 2 wt% Y/TiOx sample in this temperature range in Fig. 6. Until 900 °C, the rutile phase of 2 wt% Y/TiOx catalyst appeared, which coexisted with anatase phase. This phenomenon further demonstrates that Y doping can improve the stability of anatase crystal phase and effectively inhibit the phase transformation of anatase to rutile at high temperature. This is closely related to the formation of Y–O–Ti bonds (see Fig. 7).

Simultaneously, we also explored the catalytic performance of these samples prepared at diverse calcination temperatures, as shown in Fig. S6 and Fig. 7. It is found that bare TiO2 and 2 wt% Y/TiOx samples have the best activity when the temperature is 600 °C. It is worth noting that the propane conversions of the two catalysts are lower than 5% at 900 °C, which indicates that the rutile phase is unfavorable for PDH, which is consistent with that reported in literature.24 In addition, compared with bare TiO2 catalyst, 2 wt% Y/TiOx sample at any calcination temperature showed better catalytic performance for PDH. This should be attributed to the stability of crystal phase, and it also proves that Y doping plays a crucial role in increasing the number of active sites of TiO2 catalyst.
4.2. Role of Y–O–Ti in formation of oxygen vacancies
In order to obtain the information of chemical bond and charge distribution in the catalyst, the chemical shift of electron binding energy in the inner layer of the catalyst was accurately measured by XPS. The Y 3d core-level spectra of all the samples are shown in Fig. 8(a). Evidently, Y-doped nY/TiOx catalysts showed Y 3d peaks with centers at about 158.2 and 160.3 eV,36 which proved the existence of Y element in the samples. The core-level spectra of Ti 2p of the samples are shown in Fig. 8(b). The peaks centered at about 464.6 and 458.8 eV in bare TiO2 spectra belong to Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 of Ti4+, respectively.43,44 Compared with the bare TiO2, with the increase of Y doping, the position of the corresponding peaks in nY/TiOx catalysts moves to low binding energy. This indicates that the introduction of Y increases the electron cloud density of Ti4+. In the Y-doped catalyst, since Y3+ replaces Ti4+ to form Y–O–Ti bonds, OVs and cation gaps are generated in the crystal lattice of TiO2. Therefore, in order to achieve charge balance, the density of some electron clouds will move to the adjacent Ti4+, and at the same time, more OVs will be generated near Ti4+. Due to the limitation of TiO2 on this vacancy, other O2− ions are also disturbed and move to the direction of lower binding energy, as shown in Fig. S7.

In addition, we studied the proportion of different types of oxygen species in all samples to explore the role of Y–O–Ti structure in the formation of oxygen vacancies. The O 1s core-level spectra of all the as-prepared catalysts are divided into three peaks as shown in Fig. 8(c). The peaks at 529.9, 531.4 and 532.4 eV can be ascribed to lattice oxygen (O2−), adsorbed oxygen species on oxygen vacancies (OVs) and chemisorbed oxygen species (Oα, H2O or CO32−).45 Table S2 summarizes the OVs/O relative areas of the samples. It can be observed that the OVs/O ratio of nY/TiOx catalysts is always higher than that of bare TiO2, and the 2 wt% Y/TiOx catalyst gives the highest value. This proves that the formation of Y–O–Ti can indeed promote the increase of oxygen vacancy concentration, which is extremely beneficial to the PDH reaction activity.18,46
4.3. Effect of Y on redox of catalysts
It is well known that the contact and reaction between propane molecules and active components of the catalyst is the key to the activation and break of C–H bond in the course of the anaerobic dehydrogenation of propane. Therefore, it is indispensable to study the redox performance of the catalyst under the reaction conditions. Herein, in order to explore the effect of Y-doped TiO2 on the redox of the catalyst, the ability of the catalysts to release lattice oxygen under reduction conditions was investigated by H2-TPR. The obtained H2-TPR profiles are shown in Fig. 9(a). Bare TiO2 catalyst has two broad peaks at 501 and 586 °C, which are hydrogen consumption peaks when Ti4+ on TiO2 surface is reduced to coordination unsaturated Ti4+ (Ti4+cus) and Ti3+, respectively. With the increase of Y doping, the peaks of the two Ti species gradually move to high temperature, which proves the formation of Y–O–Ti structure. This structure enhances the lattice stability of the catalyst, weakens the ability to release lattice oxygen, and causes the peaks to high temperature. However, excessive Y content (>2 wt% Y) leads to obvious changes in TPR curves. These two peaks overlap and are difficult to distinguish, which indicates that the excessive Y may promote the reduction of some Ti species, which is unfavorable for dehydrogenation reaction.47 It is worth mentioning that with the increase of Y doping, the total area of reduction peak increases obviously, which indicates that the introduction of Y can make Ti species easy to be reduced, and can effectively promote the consumption of lattice oxygen and the formation of OVs in TiO2 catalysts. Yue et al.48 reported similar findings about the effect of Y on the reduction of PdO.

The distribution values of the two reduced Ti ions in the catalyst were obtained by fitting the peak of H2-TPR data with Gaussian deconvolution and calculating the peak area. It can be seen from Fig. 9(b) and Table S3 that with the increase of Y doping, the reduction peak area ratio corresponding to Ti4+cus first increases and then decreases. It should be emphasized that the reduction peak area ratio of Ti4+cus of 2 wt% Y/TiOx is the largest among all catalysts. This illustrates that appropriate Y doping is beneficial to the formation and stability of Ti4+cus, making it difficult to be further reduced to Ti3+. Put another way, 2 wt% Y/TiOx catalyst is most likely to generate Ti4+cus, which is consistent with the optimal catalytic activity of 2 wt% Y/TiOx obtained from activity evaluation (Section 3.3), indicating that this may be the main reason for the optimal catalytic activity of 2 wt% Y/TiOx catalyst. Therefore, H2-TPR further verified that Ti4+cus is the real active center in PDH reaction, and the higher its content, the better the catalytic performance for PDH.18,24
4.4. Effect of Y on acidity/basicity of catalysts
In PDH reaction, the weak acid sites on the catalyst are favorable for the breaking of C–H of propane molecules, while the strong acid sites will have side reactions such as cracking and polymerization, which are easy for carbon deposition and make the catalyst deactivate quickly.42,47,49 Therefore, the acidity of the catalyst surface is also the decisive factor affecting the catalytic activity. The effect of Y-doped TiO2 on the acidity/basicity of the catalyst surface was studied by NH3-TPD and Py-FTIR. The NH3-TPD curves of bare TiO2 and nY/TiOx catalysts are shown in Fig. 10, and the corresponding semi-quantitative results by the Gaussian deconvolution method are listed in Table S4. The desorption peaks of bare TiO2 catalyst center at 194, 254 and 371 °C, which, respectively, correspond to weak, medium and strong acid positions on the catalyst surface in turn.50 It can be seen that with the doping of Y species, the peak of the catalyst moves to high temperature, which further verifies the formation of Y–O–Ti bonds. In addition, with the doping of Y species, the area ratio of different desorption peaks changed, indicating that the acidity of the catalyst changed. 2 wt% Y/TiOx catalyst has the largest loss of strong acid sites, so its total acidity is the weakest, which means that applicable Y species can further neutralize the acid sites of TiO2. Samed et al.51 proposed that Y2O3 is moderate basicity, which may be the key to the reduction of the total acidity of 2 wt% Y/TiOx catalyst. However, when Y is doped excessively, it is found that its acidity increases, which may be related to the fact that Y3+ can interfere with the density of acid centers.47

The type of acid sites was determined by Py-FTIR test of pyridine adsorption on the catalysts at 200 and 350 °C. The obtained spectra are shown in Fig. 11. The peak at 1450 cm−1 belongs to the pyridine adsorption at Lewis acid site, and the peak at 1540 cm−1 belongs to the pyridine adsorption at Bronsted acid site.52,53 The figure depicts that bare TiO2 and 2 wt% Y/TiOx catalysts have well-resolved bands at 1450 cm−1, while the bands at 1540 cm−1 are negligible, so the catalysts exhibit dominated Lewis acid sites. Two types of peaks at 200 and 350 °C were calculated by Gaussian deconvolution fitting, and the amount of each acid was obtained, as shown in Table S5. Consequently, the total acid content at 200 °C and the medium acid content at 350 °C on the surface of 2 wt% Y/TiOx catalyst are higher than that of bare TiO2 catalyst, which is consistent with the quantitative results of NH3-TPD. These spectra reveal that pure TiO2 and Y-doped TiO2 merely have Lewis acid centers, and the addition of Y dopant will not change the properties of acid centers, but will change the acid strength of the catalyst.

5. Conclusions
In summary, this study proves that in-situ doping of rare earth yttrium can effectively improve the catalytic activity of TiO2 catalyst for PDH. The 2 wt% Y/TiOx sample has the best catalytic performance, with the initial propane conversion of 42% and the propylene selectivity of over 92% after ten dehydrogenation–regeneration cycles. Through comprehensive characterization, the significant role of Y species in PDH reaction was deeply examined. First of all, the introduction of Y species can not only replace part of Ti4+ to form Y–O–Ti bond, which can enhance the lattice stability of the catalyst, but also improve the SBET of TiO2 catalyst, making it have more active sites and better catalytic performance. Secondly, the addition of Y makes Ti species easy to be reduced, which directly promotes the consumption of lattice oxygen and the formation of OVs in nY/TiOx. Finally, a proper amount of Y-doped TiO2 not only is beneficial to the formation and stability of Ti4+cus, but also can adjust the content ratio of weak acid to medium acid in the catalyst, which is the key to improve the catalytic activity. However, excessive Y species can only be distributed in the lattice gaps of TiO2, which leads to partial pore blockage and the reduction of the exposure of active sites, thus reducing the catalytic performance of nY/TiOx catalysts.
