1. Introduction
Catalytic dehydrogenation of propane to propylene has particularly drawn wide attention in recent years, due to the growing demand of propylene [1,2]. Over the past several decades, CrOx/Al2O3 [[3], [4], [5]] and Pt-Sn based catalysts [[6], [7], [8]] were demonstrated as efficient catalysts in direct dehydrogenation (DDH) of propane to propylene. However, chromium is toxic that inevitably produces pollution to the environment. While, platinum is a noble metal, its high price and low availability limit its wide application. And the exploitation of an environmental-friendly catalyst system with both high catalytic performance and low cost for the DDH reaction is very necessary.
Up to now, nanocarbon materials as metal-free catalysts have been widely used in catalysis, owing to their high surface area, stable structure, tunable nanoscale dimension, and abundant functional groups [[9], [10], [11]]. Recently, carbon nanotubes [12,13], nanodiamond [14,15] and ordered mesoporous carbon [16] are reported to be efficient catalysts in oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) reactions, and the oxygenated functional groups, especially CO groups, are regarded as the active sites. To further improve their catalytic performance, metal oxide and/or carbide have been used as promoters for preparation of carbon composites [17,18]. While, our group found that ordered mesoporous carbons prepared by organic–organic self-assembly methods were robust catalysts for DDH of propane to propylene, exhibiting high catalytic activity comparable with the industrial catalysts [[19], [20], [21], [22]]. Zhao and co-workers [[23], [24], [25]] reported that N-doped carbon nanotubes were good catalysts for DDH of ethylbenzene to styrene. However, the preparation of these nanocarbon materials is high cost, time-consuming, and low yield, which is unfavorable for industrial application. And thus the development of a much cheap and easy available nanocarbon catalyst with abundant oxygen-containing groups and porous structure for the dehydrogenation reaction is still a great challenge.
Currently, biomass-derived nanocarbons have attracted increasing attentions due to their nontoxicity, environmental friendliness combined with high surface area, rich porous structures and numerous functional groups, which have been widely used in adsorption, separation, catalysis and electrode materials [26,27]. However, little research has been focused on the exploitation of biomass-derived porous carbons for DDH of propane to propylene so far. Castanea mollissima is a popular nut in the East and Southeast Asia. In 2010, about 1.959 million tonne of castanea mollissima was produced in the world according to the Food and Agriculture organization of the United Nations [26]. And a large amount of castanea mollissima shell (CMS) is produced simultaneously, which is inedible to humans and serves little economic purpose. So, it is quite significant to make good use of this biomass waste. Several reports have indicated that the CMS could be used as dye extracts [28,29], adsorbents [30], and electrode materials [31], though the large-scale use of the CMS is still a great challenge. To the best of our knowledge, there is no research on the utilization of CMS derived carbons as metal-free catalysts in DDH reactions.
Herein, a series of porous carbons were prepared from CMS by a simple alkali activation method. The obtained nanocarbon catalysts were used in DDH of propane to propylene, exhibiting high catalytic activity, selectivity and stability. The excellent catalytic performance was attributed to the rich oxygen-containing groups, high surface area and hierarchical porous structure of the CMS-derived carbons. This study demonstrated the flexible utilization of biomass waste for the DDH of propane to propylene.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and activation procedure
The CMS used in this study was obtained from a local farmer market in Henan, China. The castanea mollissima shell-derived carbon (CMSC) was prepared by an alkali activation method (Scheme 1). Firstly, the dried CMS (powder) was placed into a tubular furnace and heated to 400 °C under nitrogen flow (60 mL min−1) at 10 °C min−1, and then maintained at 400 °C for 1 h. During the activation process, the pre-carbonized sample was impregnated with the KOH solution at the KOH/C mass ratio of 3:1–1:1, and the mixture was dried at 110 °C for 12 h. After that, the sample was transferred into a tubular furnace, heated to 600, 700 and 800 °C at 10 °C min−1 and kept for 1 h under N2 (60 mL min−1). Finally, the activated carbon particles were washed by distilled water until the pH 7.0, which was denoted as CMSC-x-y (x represents the ratio of KOH/C, y represents the calcination temperature). And the CMS calcined without KOH at 400 and 700 °C were named as CMSC-400 and CMSC-700, respectively.

2.2. Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed on a Jeol JSF-7500L at 5 kV and a Jeol JEM 2100F at 200 kV, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation (λ = 0.15418 nm) at 40 kV and 40 mA. The textural properties of the porous carbon were characterized by N2 sorption technique at −196 °C on a Quantachrome NOVA 2000e sorption analyzer. Prior to each measurement, the sample was degassed at 200 °C for 6 h in vacuum. The specific surface area was calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) method, and the total pore volume (Vtotal) was obtained from the adsorbed amount at P/P0 = 0.99. The Raman spectra were tested on a SR-500I-A-1f1 Raman spectrometer with λ = 532 nm. Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis was carried out on a TA SDT Q600 instrument with a step of 10 °C min−1 (N2, 100 mL min−1) using α-Al2O3 as the reference. Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) experiments were conducted on a Quantachrome CHEMBET-3000 chemisorption analyzer. Before the test, 0.1 g sample was treated at 300 °C in He (20 mL min−1) for 2 h. Then the pretreated sample was cooled to room temperature and followed heating to 950 °C (heating rate, 10 °C min−1) in He (20 mL min−1). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments were performed on a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer (Al Kα X-ray source, 1486.6 eV). Every spectrum was determined by C 1s (284.8 eV).
2.3. Catalytic testing
The catalytic reaction was carried out in a fixed-bed flow microreactor at atmospheric pressure. The reactor was a quartz tube of 5 mm i.d. and 20 cm length, which was packed with 200 mg of catalyst (sieve fraction 450–900 μm, length of catalyst bed ≈ 2 cm) at 600 °C. The gas reactant contained C3H8 and N2 (C3H8/N2 molar ratio = 1:19, total flow rate = 20 mL min−1). The outlet gases were analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC, SP-6890) equipped with a FID detector. And the main byproducts are methane, ethane and ethylene for all the tested nanocarbons. Propane conversion and propylene selectivity were calculated as follows [15,16]:

where Ni represents the carbon atomic number in the product (

2.4. Kinetic tests
The kinetic results were obtained from the catalytic testing results, and testing conditions were shown in Section 2.3. The kinetic parameters were calculated at a low C3H8 conversion (<15%). The apparent activation energy (Ea) was obtained from the Arrhenius equation:

versus 1/T).
3. Results and discussion
Porous carbons derived from castanea mollissima shell are prepared by a simple alkali activation method. During the alkali activation process, KOH would react with the carbon atoms as: C + 6KOH → 2K + 3H2 + 2 K2CO3, followed by decomposition of K2CO3 and/or reaction of K/K2CO3/CO2 with carbon atoms, and thus, producing many nanopores in the prepared nanocarbons [[32], [33], [34]]. To make clear the influence of calcination temperature and alkali/C ratio on the catalyst properties, a series of CMSCs were prepared, and their physicochemical properties are characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM, XPS, TG, He-TPD, Raman spectroscopy and nitrogen sorption techniques.
3.1. Structure and textural properties
The XRD patterns of the CMSCs are shown in Fig. 1. Clearly, two broad diffraction peaks at 2θ = 24.0° and 43.8° can be observed in all the samples, which are attributed to the (002) and (100) planes of pseudographitic carbon with amorphous and disordered character [31,35]. Obviously, the intensities of these diffraction peaks are so weak, suggesting the presence of a small part of graphitic carbon. Furthermore, an obvious increase of the low-angle scatter can be observed in the CMSC-x-y, indicating that many pores are successfully introduced into the carbon materials after KOH-activation [32,33].

The surface morphologies and porous structures of the CMSC-700 and CMSC-3-y can be directly observed by SEM images (Figs. 2 and S1). From Fig. 2a and b, it can be observed that the CMS carbonized without KOH is composed of a number of bulk particles. And no obvious pores can be observed in the CMSC-700. After activation with KOH, many macropores ranging from a few hundred nanometers to several micrometers can be observed in the CMSC-3-700 (Fig. 2c and d). This is attributed to the reaction between carbon atoms and KOH at high temperature [32,33], resulting in a loose structure with plenty of pores. The SEM images of the CMSC-3-600 and CMSC-3-800 (Fig. S1) show many macropores and mesopores, which is similar to those seen in CMSC-3-700. This result is in good accordance with the XRD patterns in Fig. 1.

The TEM images of the CMSC-3-700 at different magnifications are shown in Fig. 3. From the low-magnification TEM image (Fig. 3a), it can be seen that the CMSC-3-700 is composed of many blocks. And these blocks are random accumulation, resulting in a number of meso/macropores. Deep magnification further reveals the meso-/macropores ranging from several nanometers to dozens of nanometers (Fig. 3b and c). The high-resolution TEM image of CMSC-3-700 is shown in Fig. 3d, illustrating the presence of many micropores [34,35]. This result demonstrates that the CMSC samples activated by KOH possess hierarchically micro-/meso-/macroporous structures. And the hierarchical porous structures and interconnections of the carbon catalysts could provide more active sites, which would be beneficial for the catalytic reactions.

The N2 sorption isotherms and the pore size distribution curves of the CMSCs are shown in Fig. 4. And the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 1. It is seen that the CMSC-700 sample possesses small surface area (87 m2/g) and low pore volume (0.11 cm3/g), indicating a non-porous structure. As to the CMSC-x-y, the adsorption volumes increase sharply. And all the CMSC-x-y possess isotherms of both type I and IV, suggesting the coexistence of micro-/mesopores [35,36]. Their pore size distribution curves calculated by NLDFT method exhibit three narrow peaks centered at approximately 1.4, 1.8 and 2.6 nm, respectively. Noticeably, the N2 uptake at low pressure region (P/P0 < 0.1) of the isotherm indicates the presence of many micropores. Also, the pore size distribution curves of CMSCs do not show a complete distribution at the small pore diameter limit, suggesting the existence of abundant micropores. It is noticeable that the KOH/C ratio and calcination temperature could make great influence on the micropores and mesopores of the CMSCs. At low activation temperature (lower than 700 °C), the micropores increase with increasing activation temperature. However, when the calcination temperature is higher than 700 °C, many micropores would be transformed into mesopores due to the collapse of micropores and enhanced orientation during carbonization process [33,34]. Similarly, at low KOH/C ratio (lower than 2.0), the surface area and pore volume of micropores increase with increasing KOH/C ratio. When the KOH/C ratio is higher than 3.0, the surface area and pore volume of micropores decrease, while, the mesopores increase obviously. This is because a part of micropores are transformed into mesopores, resulting in low micro-surface area and enhanced meso-surface area. Furthermore, the total surface area and total pore volume of the CMSCs increase with the ratio of KOH/C and the calcination temperature rise (Fig. 4c and Table 1). And all the samples possess high surface areas over 850 m2/g.

Raman spectroscopy is an efficient technique to characterize the structure of the carbon materials. In general, two obvious bands named D band and G band can be observed in the carbon materials. The D band (∼1350 cm−1) and G band (∼1590 cm−1) correspond to the disordered carbon and the E2g mode of sp2-bonded carbon atoms in graphitic layers, respectively [37,38]. And the values of the ID/IG can be used to characterize the structural quality of the carbon materials. Fig. 5a shows the Raman spectra of the CMSC-x-700. Obviously, the values of ID/IG ratios are similar, indicating that the ratio of weightKOH/weightcarbon has small effect on the structure order of the CMSCs. From Fig. 5b, the ID/IG values increase with the calcination temperature, with 0.81, 0.95 and 0.97 to the CMSC-3-600, CMSC-3-700 and CMSC-3-800, respectively. This may be caused by the increased reaction between KOH and carbon atoms with elevated calcination temperature, resulting in many disordered carbon atoms, defects and nanopores [37,38].

The XPS spectra of the CMSC-3-y are shown in Figs. 6 and S3. And the corresponding data is shown in Table S1. The XPS survey spectrum of the raw CMSC-3-y reveals the main compositions of C and O (Fig. S3a). And the oxygen concentrations of the CMSC-3-600, CMSC-3-700 and CMSC-3-800 are about 9.1, 6.9 and 6.3%, respectively. Fig. 6 shows the high-resolution O 1s XPS spectra of the CMS-3-y. And every spectrum can be fitted into four main peaks, corresponding to CO (O1, BE = 531.0–531.8 eV), COOH (O2, BE = 532.2–532.8 eV), COH and/or COC groups (O3, BE = 533.5 eV), and adsorbed water (O4, BE = 535.0–536.2 eV), respectively [39,40]. The corresponding O1 concentrations are 1.05, 1.34 and 0.71% for CMSC-3-600, CMSC-3-700 and CMSC-3-800, respectively. This is caused by the continuous decomposition of the oxygenated functional groups with the increase of calcination temperature. The high-resolution XPS C 1s spectra of the CMSC-3-y (Fig. S3b–d) can be devoted into five peaks, corresponding to CC and CH (C1, 284.8 eV), COC and/or COH (C2, 286.1 eV), CO (C3, 287.0–288.0 eV), COOH (C4, 288.9 eV) and a π → π* peak (C5, BE = 290.2 eV) [40]. Obviously, the oxygenated functional groups decrease with the elevated calcination temperature, further confirming the decomposition of the oxygenated functional groups at high calcination temperature.

Fig. 6. The high-resolution XPS O1s spectra of the CMSCs.
Carbon materials, especially biomass-derived carbons, contain many surface oxygenated groups, such as OH, COOH, and CO. And these groups, especially carbonyl (CO) groups, play the important roles in the propane dehydrogenation reactions [[19], [20], [21]]. Fig. 7 depicts the TG curves of the CMSC-400 and CMSC-3-y, and all the experiments are carried out in N2 with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The TG curves show a weight loss of 22.8, 9.0, 8.2 and 3.7% from 400 to 950 °C for CMSC-400, CMSC-3-600, CMSC-3-700 and CMSC-3-800, respectively. And the thermal degradations of the CMSCs are multistage processes, which can be divided into four stages [41,42]. The first stage (from room temperature to 400 °C) corresponds to the evaporation of adsorbed water. In Fig. 7, only a slight weight loss can be observed for all these four samples, suggesting the presence of a small amount of adsorbed water. The weight loss from 400 to 600 °C (second stage) can be assigned to the degradation of carboxylic and hydroxyl groups. Obviously, only the CMSC-400 shows an obvious weight loss (13.95%), indicating the existence of a number of carboxylic and hydroxyl groups in the pretreated sample. The third stage (from 600 to 700 °C) is attributed to the thermal degradation of lactone, phenol, and anhydride. Noticeably, the TG curves of CMSC-3-600 and CMSC-3-700 are similar in this temperature region, indicating the existence of similar amounts of lactone, phenol and anhydride groups. When the temperature is higher than 700 °C (fourth stage), a continuous weight loss is assigned to the decomposition of carbonyl or quinines. As to the CMSC-3-800 sample, no obvious weight loss can be observed from 400 to 950 °C, due to the decomposition of most of oxygenated functional groups after calcination at 800 °C.

Fig. 7. The TG curves of the CMSC samples.
Fig. 8 shows the He-TPD profiles of CMSC samples. All the samples possess four main peaks, the peaks at around 400–550 °C can be assigned to the decomposition of carboxylic acid functional groups [[43], [44], [45]]. The peaks centered at 550–700 °C are attributed to the carboxylic anhydrides and lactones [43,44]. The peaks at higher temperature over 700 °C are assigned to the decomposition of carbonyl and quinine groups [43,45]. From Fig. 8, the CMSC-400 sample shows the highest signal, suggesting the presence of a large number of oxygenated functional groups. After calcination with KOH at higher temperature (over 600 °C), many functional groups such as carboxylic and hydroxyl groups, are decomposed, resulting in a decrease of the desorption signal. However, the highly stabled oxygenated functional groups such as CO, are maintained. When the calcination temperature is up to 800 °C, most of the oxygenated functional groups would be decomposed. The CMSC-3-800 shows the lowest signal, suggesting the decomposition of most of the oxygenated functional groups. This phenomenon is consistent with the XPS (Fig. 6) and TG results (Fig. 7).

3.2. The performance of the catalysts
The propane dehydrogenation experiments were carried out in a fixed-bed tubular reactor. The exit gas contained target product propylene and three kinds of by-products (methane, ethane and ethylene). Fig. 9a and c shows the catalytic activity and selectivity of CMSCs at varied reaction temperatures. Obviously, the catalytic activities of these catalysts increase with the reaction temperature. In comparison with the CMSC-x-700 samples, The CMSC-700 shows very low catalytic activity (Fig. 9a and b) with the initial propane conversion of 5.2% and propylene selectivity of 89.7% at 600 °C, while the catalytic activities of the KOH-activated CMSC-x-700 samples enhance sharply. Noticeably, the catalytic activities of the CMSC-x-700 increase with the ratio of weighKOH/weightcarbon rise. And the initial catalytic activity of CMSC-3-700 (41.3%) is a little higher than that of the CMSC-1-700 (30.5%) and CMSC-2-700 (33.5%) at 600 °C. Typically, the CMSC-3-700 exhibits the catalytic activity of 24.7% and selectivity of 93.5% after 10 h time-on-stream, which is comparable to that of the previously reported HNO3-activated OMCs [21] and B- and P-doped OMCs [22,46], and much higher than that of the pristine OMCs [20].

Fig. 9c and d shows the catalytic performance of the CMSC-3-y. It is observed that the CMSC-3-600 and CMSC-3-700 show high initial catalytic activity of 36.3% and 41.3% at 600 °C, respectively. While the CMSC-3-800 exhibits a relative low initial catalytic activity of 19.7% with the propane selectivity of 95.3%. After 600 min, the catalytic activities of the CMSC-3-600, CMSC-3-700 and CMSC-800 show a small decrease with the final conversions of 23.1%, 24.7% and 13.4%, respectively.
3.3. Discussion
It is known that the catalytic activity of the nanocarbon catalysts in dehydrogenation reaction is correlated with their oxygenated functional groups and porous structures [[12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]]. The CO groups are Lewis base and could activate the CH bond of the C3H8 as the electron donor [[19], [20], [21], [22]]. While, the rich porous structure and large surface area of the nanocarbon catalysts are favor of the mass transport and could provide more accessible active sites, which are good for the catalytic reaction [19,20]. Fig. 10 shows the Arrhenius plots of the CMSCs, and the corresponding apparent activation energy (Ea) are shown in Table 2. It is shown that the Ea values of the CMSCs are similar to each other, suggesting that the active sites of CMSCs are identical [47]. These results are in good accordance with the specific activities in Table 2, further confirming that the catalytic performance are correlated with the oxygenated functional groups and porous structures of the nanocarbons.

As proved by SEM (Fig. 2a and b) and N2 sorption analysis (Fig. 4a and Table 1), the CMSC-700 possesses a small surface area of 87 m2/g that many active sites are unexposed. Thus, the CMSC-700 exhibits really low catalytic activity. After activation by KOH, a large number of pores are successfully introduced into the carbon materials. The SEM (Figs. 2 and S1), TEM (Fig. 3) and N2 sorption results (Figs. 4 and S2) demonstrate the presence of numerous micro-/meso-/macropores in the CMSCs-x-700. The specific activities of the CMSCs are listed in Table 2. From this table, it can be seen that the specific activities of CMSCs follow: CMSC-3-600 > CMSC-1-700 ≈ CMSC-2-700 ≈ CMSC-3-700 > CMSC-3-800. While the propane conversions of CMSCs follow: CMSC-3-700 > CMSC-3-600 > CMS-2-700 > CMSC-1-700 > CMSC-1-700 > CMSC-3-800 > CMSC-700. This is due to the presence of different oxygenated functional groups and porous structures in the CMSCs. The CMSC-3-700 possesses the highest surface area (SBET = 1400 m2/g) and pore volume (Vtotal = 0.89 cm3/g) than that of the CMSC-1-700 (SBET = 975 m2/g, Vtotal = 0.62 cm3/g) and CMSC-2-700 (SBET = 1234 m2/g, Vtotal = 0.81 cm3/g), and thus, exhibiting the best catalytic activity. However, the specific activity of CMSCs are various with the calcination temperature (CMSC-3-600 > CMSC-3-700 > CMSC-3-800), which are probably due to the presence of different concentrations of oxygenated functional groups. The XPS spectra (Fig. 6), TG curves (Fig. 7) and He-TPD results (Fig. 8) show a continuous decrease of the oxygenated functional groups with elevated activation temperature. At relative low temperature of 700 °C, the main active sites (CO) are maintained. When the activation temperature is up to 800 °C, most of the oxygenated functional groups would be decomposed, which is negative for the catalytic reaction.
As to the CMSC-3-600 and CMSC-3-700, the surface oxygenation groups amounts of CMSC-3-700 is a little lower than that of CMSC-3-600 (Fig. 4 and Table S1). But the surface area and pore volume of CMSC-3-700 are much higher than that of the CMSC-3-600. So, more active sites would be exposed onto the surface of CMSC-3-700. Thus, the CMSC-3-700 exhibits higher catalytic activity as compared to the CMSC-3-600. So, it can be concluded that the nanocarbon catalysts possessed both high surface area and abundant oxygenated functional groups present good catalytic performance in propane dehydrogenation.
During the DDH reaction, many side reactions including isomerization, cracking and hydrogenolysis, would be occurred at high reaction temperature, leading to the formation of coke [1,11]. And the coke accumulation would block the pores of catalysts, resulting in a decrease of the surface area and pore volume. As to the Cr- and Pt-based catalysts, they would deactivate quickly in DDH reaction due to the formation of coke, resulting in sharp decreases of the surface area and pore volume [1,5]. So, the loss of surface area and pore volume of CMSCs after 10 h time-on-stream must be attributed to the coke. However, only a slight decrease of the surface area and the pore volume can be observed in the CMSCs after 10 h time-on-stream (Table 1), demonstrating good stability of the prepared carbon catalysts. Especially, the surface area and pore volume of CMSC-3-700 decrease from 1400 to 1266 m2/g and 0.89–0.74 cm3/g, respectively. This can be attributed to its hierarchical porous structure and large surface area that are beneficial for mass transport, avoiding hot spots and local transport limitations [19,20]. Fig. S2 shows the nitrogen sorption isotherms and the corresponding pore size distribution curves of the CMSCs after 10 h time-on-stream. And all the sorption isotherms of the used CMSC catalysts are similar to the original ones, further confirming the high stability of these nanocarbon catalysts. Also, the carbon balance over CMSCs on 10 h time-on-stream remains stable at around 100% (Fig. S4), indicating the carbon deposition on the CMSCs does not obviously occur.
The noble metal and metal oxide catalysts are either costly and scarce, or detrimental, and have been troubled by coking and cracking over the long term in DDH reaction. As a metal-free catalyst, the CMSC exhibits high catalytic activity and good stability combined with nontoxicity and much low cost, which represents a promising alternative to metal and metal oxide catalysts for DDH of propane to propylene.
4. Conclusion
Castanea mollissima shell-derived carbon materials with rich porous structure and abundant surface oxygen-containing groups have been prepared by a simple alkali activation method, and used as metal-free catalysts for DDH of propane to propylene, exhibiting high catalytic activity, selectivity and stability. The oxygen-containing groups, especially CO groups are believed to be the active sites in this reaction. The high surface area and rich porous structure of the catalysts are favorable to the mass transport and could supply more active sites, which are responsible for the high catalytic performance. As a result, the CMSC-3-700 exhibited the best catalytic activity with 24.7% propane conversion and 93.5% propylene selectivity after 600 min time-on-stream. It is revealed that castanea mollissima shell-derived carbon could be used as a promising catalyst in direct dehydrogenation of propane.
