 Unfortunately there is insufficient information provided in the document to extract all the requested details about a propane dehydrogenation catalyst. The document focuses on computational modeling rather than experimental results for a specific catalyst. Here is the relevant information I could extract:

The document examines propane dehydrogenation reaction mechanisms computationally using density functional theory calculations for single Pt atoms supported on boron nitride. However, it does not provide experimental data on an actual catalyst preparation, composition, performance metrics, or process conditions. While it provides some theoretical insights, there are no measurable improvements to selectivity, conversion, or stability claimed for a real catalytic system.
